Nursing courses usually take three years and are 4,600 hours in length, which is split 50%/50% between theory and clinical placements as set out as a requirement of the NMC. Graduate courses are provided and are two years in length.

Two of the world's foremost HIV experts, Luc Montagnier and Vittorio Colizzi, supported the medics' case, and reaction to their convictions was swift, with a number of appeals from scientific and human rights organizations, and various official condemnations of the verdict along with diplomatic initiatives.|$|E
25|$|Coronary {{catheterization}} {{is performed}} in a catheterization lab, usually located <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>hospital.</b> With current designs, the patient must lie relatively flat on a narrow, minimally padded, radiolucent (transparent to X-ray) table. The X-ray source and imaging camera equipment are {{on opposite sides of}} the patient's chest and freely move, under motorized control, around the patient's chest so images can be taken quickly from multiple angles. More advanced equipment, termed a bi-plane cath lab, uses two sets of X-ray source and imaging cameras, each free to move independently, which allows two sets of images to be taken with each injection of radiocontrast agent. The equipment and installation setup to perform such testing typically represents a capital expenditure of US$2–5 million (2004), sometimes more, partially repeated every few years.|$|E

25|$|Louisville Metro EMS {{utilizes}} {{two levels}} of care providers. EMT-Basics (referred to as technicians or EMTs) and EMT-Paramedics (usually just called paramedics) have drastically different scopes of practice but all exist to provide care and transportation to the sick and injured. A technician specializes in ambulance operation and basic life support care as well assistance to advanced providers. Most technicians have an initial six months of training receiving at least 110 hours of formal classroom training, often reaching or exceeding 120 or 168 hours, with some training institutions requiring initial unspecified numerous clinical hours <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>hospital.</b> Basic Emergency Medical Technicians are required to pass skills training and are required to challenge the National Registry of Emergency Medical Technicians exam to become NREMT certified. Paramedics use complex diagnostics, perform medical procedures, and administer medications and additional advanced care that would otherwise only be provided by an emergency physician. Paramedics in Kentucky generally have three years of initial training including at least 750 hours of internship and clinical instruction in addition to about 1200 hours of formal, classroom instruction. An increasing number of paramedics possess at least an associates degree, many have bachelor's degrees.|$|E

2500|$|The CDC {{does not}} {{recommend}} that health-care facilities regularly {{test for the}} Legionella pneumophila bacteria. Scheduled microbiologic monitoring for Legionella remains controversial because its presence is not necessarily evidence of a potential for causing disease. The CDC recommends aggressive disinfection measures for cleaning and maintaining devices known to transmit Legionella, but does not recommend regularly-scheduled microbiologic assays for the bacteria. However, scheduled monitoring of potable water <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>hospital</b> might be considered in certain settings where persons are highly susceptible to illness and mortality from Legionella infection (e.g. hematopoietic stem cell transplantation units, or solid organ transplant units). [...] Also, after an outbreak of legionellosis, health officials agree that monitoring is necessary to identify the source and to evaluate the efficacy of biocides or other prevention measures.|$|E

On the Criterion DVD and laserdisc, this chapter is referenced as [...] "2 minutes, 42 seconds." [...] The film was considerably darker than most of Woo's previous films, depicting a police force nearly helpless to stop the influx of gangsters in the city, and the senseless slaughter of innocents. As a result, it did not match the success of his other films.|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} {{the application of}} a multi-agent system for the distributed diagnosis of infections <b>within</b> <b>an</b> <b>hospital.</b> Diagnosing infections <b>within</b> <b>an</b> <b>hospital</b> is <b>a</b> complex task that may require to collect data (e. g. analysis results, details on patient's clinical history, diagnosis hypotheses) from several information sources (such as, for example, analysis laboratories, hospital wards. These sources act autonomously and they often have a partial knowledge about patients health, their clinical history, and medical information in general. As a natural consequence, this may lead a single entity (e. g., a specialist) to formulate incorrect diagnosis. In such a context, to obtain a correct diagnosis on the basis of information coming from di#erent sources, a coordination mechanism is needed for the integration of collected data into a final diagnosis which should be compatible both with patient's anamnesis and other knowledge (possibly distributed over the system) related to the clinical case. In the paper we face this problem by using abduction, which is a reasoning mechanism for formulating hypotheses in the case of incomplete knowledge, suitably etended to a multi-agent setting. In particular, we first apply ALIAS abductive agents to distributed diagnosis and show how the coordination mechanisms provided by such system are well suited when composing several (possibly partial) diagnosis into a final response, which is consistent with the knowledge of involved agents (i. e., hospital entities or specialist doctors). In {{the second part of the}} paper, we extend basic ALIAS coordination mechanisms towards probabilistic abduction. In this way, several (possibly partial) diagnosis obtained by probabilistic abductive reasoning can be merged into a final set of abductive diagnosis, [...] ...|$|R
