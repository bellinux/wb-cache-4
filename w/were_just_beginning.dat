Several of the actors who were cast as college students, including Hulce, Karen Allen, and Kevin Bacon, <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>beginning</b> their film careers, although Matheson had appeared as one of the vigilante cops in the second Dirty Harry film, Magnum Force, released in 1973.|$|E
5|$|When Megh passed near Socotra, {{residents}} <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>beginning</b> {{to return}} after the previous cyclone, and many had to evacuate again. Additional heavy rainfall and high winds lashed the island, which destroyed 500homes and damaged another 3,000. The consecutive storms damaged 785fishing boats, left 80% {{of the roads}} impassible, and caused an island-wide power outage. Megh killed 18people on Socotra and injured another 60. The heavy damage on the island prompted nearby countries and international organizations to deliver relief goods and medical teams. Later, Megh brought torrential rainfall and high waves to northern Somalia, killing livestock and damaging schools. The storm's final landfall in Yemen marked little rainfall or effects.|$|E

5|$|About 30 {{houses in}} San Pablo, Laguna were either {{demolished}} by strong winds or by falling coconut trees. Elsewhere, in Zambales, {{a woman was}} killed after she was struck by lighting. In Lucena City, a farmer was swept away via floods and two boys died due to fallen trees. The resort city of Legaspi suffered severe damage because hundreds of dwellings were destroyed, forcing many residents to seek shelter in schools or churches. Along {{the east coast of}} Luzon, seven people perished when hit by falling coconut trees in Quezon. Meanwhile, three casualties occurred in a fire in the province of Sorsogon. A total of 15 people drowned in the town of Sexmoan. The nearby towns of Macabebe and Masantol saw two drownings each. In the city of Manila or the provinces of Batangas, Quezon, Laguna, and Cavite, 34,000 people were displaced. Overall, damage totaled $42 million (1983 USD). Infrastructure damage totaled $31 million. However, damage to crops totaled to only $9.4 million since residents <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>beginning</b> to replant fields.|$|E
5|$|Lützow {{was posted}} {{missing in action}} {{following}} combat on 24 April 1945 while attempting to intercept an attack by United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) Martin B-26 Marauder medium bombers near Donauwörth. According to Stockert, an examination of U.S. records by Mr. Hirst indicates that Lützow's Me262 crashed near Schrobenhausen. The USAAF flew three attacks against the oil terminals at Schrobenhausen, south of Neuburg an der Donau, that day. On their second mission, 22 B-26 bombers escorted by 16 Republic P-47 Thunderbolt fighter aircraft, <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>beginning</b> their bomb run at 3:25pm, when they came under attack by four Me262s. Two P-47s came diving down from their top cover position {{to fend off the}} attacking jets. In this account, one Me262 pilot noticed {{that he was about to}} come under attack and attempted to dive away. Unable to recover from this dive, the American pilots observed the Me262 crashing into a small hill. This Me262 may have been piloted by Lützow.|$|E
5|$|By the 1994 NBA All-Star Game, {{speculation}} as {{to whether}} or not the Timberwolves would remain in Minneapolis following the 1994–95 season became an issue. On February 11, 1994, NBA commissioner David Stern announced that he and his representatives would serve as mediators in an effort to resolve issues related to the debt owed on the Target Center, the Timberwolves home arena. The Timberwolves ownership was seeking a public or private entity to purchase the $73 million remaining on the arena's mortgage, otherwise the team would be sold and in all likelihood moved from Minnesota. Although mediation talks <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>beginning</b> to keep the team in place, by the following week it was revealed that ownership had met with representatives from San Diego, Nashville and New Orleans to discuss the potential relocation of the franchise. By late February, New Orleans emerged as the likely city for the team to relocate to if a deal could not be reached to keep the team in Minneapolis. This became the case after the potential ownership group Top Rank signed a letter of intent to purchase the team and move it to New Orleans if debt issues at the Target Center were not resolved.|$|E

25|$|Such a {{tower was}} {{certainly}} an effective protection against surprise attacks by smaller marauding gangs {{and the local}} population. Often a castle was vulnerable just through {{the absence of a}} few able-bodied men whilst they were out hunting or working in the fields. Even without supplies the remaining castle residents could hold out in the bergfried until the return of their menfolk and were protected from abuse and rape. The safe refuge of the bergfried was certainly very welcome at a time when state and social structures <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>beginning</b> to take shape.|$|E

She {{would be the first}} woman to be sent over in that capacity, all the woman agents before her having been sent as couriers.

25|$|Although railroads <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>beginning</b> {{to see the}} {{advantages}} that autoracks delivered in the 1960s, most North American railroads were reluctant to invest in such specially built equipment. The Trailer Train Company, organized by the Pennsylvania Railroad and the Norfolk and Western Railway in 1955, stepped in to ease the railroads' financial burden a bit. Trailer Train purchased the flat cars from the rail car manufacturers, and the railroads that wanted to operate autoracks, purchased the racks that were installed on those flat cars. Such cars were easily spotted at trackside due to the reporting marks identifying Trailer Train on the flat car portion {{of the car and}} the railroad's logo (usually much larger) in the upper portion of the rack.|$|E

For over a year, the Navy—stretched thin to cover its worldwide commitments at a period when new ships <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>beginning</b> to join the fleet in any number—was to fight and fight again in the Solomon Islands {{in one of the}} most bitterly contested campaigns of history, wresting air and sea control from the Japanese and providing the Marine Corps and the Army with every possible support as they gained ground inch by inch on the myriad islands. Assigned the Destroyer Squadron 21 (DesRon21), O'Bannon played a valiant part in these endeavors, winning a Presidential Unit Citation.|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} days of the modern {{evolutionary}} synthesis, scientists <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>beginning</b> to blend the new science of population genetics with Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection. Working within this new framework, Wright focused on the effects of inbreeding on small relatively isolated populations. He introduced the concept of an adaptive landscape in which phenomena such as cross breeding and genetic drift in small populations could push them away from adaptive peaks, which in turn allow natural selection to push them towards new adaptive peaks. Wright thought smaller populations were more suited for natural selection because [...] "inbreeding was sufficiently intense to create new interaction systems through random drift but not intense enough to cause random nonadaptive fixation of genes." ...|$|E
500|$|The General Board, {{whose main}} {{concern was the}} {{integrated}} operation of the United States , pushed for the design to provide more scouting capabilities for fleet operations.

500|$|Thayer's close {{observation}} led him {{to notice}} what scientists such as Edward Bagnall Poulton <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>beginning</b> to describe. This was that many animals were [...] "painted" [...] the opposite way to how painters create the appearance of solidity in figures. A canvas is flat, and areas of uniform color painted on a canvas also appear flat. To make a body appear to have depth and solidity, the artist paints in shadows on the body itself. The top of an animal's back, facing the sky, remains bright, while it must become darker towards its underside. Thayer was excited to realize that by reversing such shading, nature could and did make animals appear flat. He was so passionate about this [...] "concealing coloration" [...] theory that he called it his [...] "second child". Poulton had noticed countershading in certain caterpillars, {{but he had not}} realized that the phenomenon was widespread, and he championed Thayer's theory in a 1902 article in Nature.|$|E
