6000|$|... "Hi! Hi! Hi!" [...] {{he joined}} his robust yell to mine, {{and for a}} moment we made the canyon bellow. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>stopped</b> for breath the echoes bayed at us from the {{opposite}} walls.|$|E
6000|$|... "Let us run!" [...] said Lettie, {{and joining}} hands we raced wildly along, with a flutter and a breathless laughter, till {{we were happy}} and forgetful. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>stopped</b> we exclaimed at once, [...] "Hark!" ...|$|E
5000|$|The play {{ends with}} A, B, and C debating about the happiest moment in their life. A has the last word, saying, [...] "That's the happiest moment. When it's all done. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>stop.</b> <b>When</b> <b>we</b> can stop." ...|$|R
60|$|All this I see as I sit in {{the little}} stern-gallery {{mentioned}} just now. Evening slowly steals upon the landscape and changes it before me, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>stop</b> to set some emigrants ashore.|$|R
60|$|My aunt {{sits with}} my hand in hers all the way. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>stop</b> a little way short of the church, to put down Peggotty, whom we have brought on the box, she gives it a squeeze, and me a kiss.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, thanks. It mainly needed rest, and I {{must confess}} that I didn't find it {{altogether}} a drawback <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>stopped</b> {{at the bottom}} of the big crag. I should have had to go up if I hadn't been lame." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{had nothing}} {{whatever}} {{to do with}} the horses or the trip, except to help rub them down <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>stopped,</b> and to drive home," [...] replied Ralph, almost indignant that George should think even for a moment that he would have countenanced such a thing.|$|E
6000|$|... "This malapert boy, general, {{wished to}} force {{his way into}} your tent, and <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>stopped</b> him, {{and told him that}} he must apply to the {{lieutenant}} of the guard if he had aught of importance which he wished to communicate to you, he began to shout like one possessed." ...|$|E
5000|$|She {{has created}} roles in Bintley's Metamorphosis, The Snow Queen and Earth {{as part of}} Homage to The Queen, Bruce's Symphony in Three Movements and in Mr. Worldly Wise, Two-Part Invention, <b>When</b> <b>We</b> <b>Stop</b> Talking, Masquerade and most {{recently}} Wayne McGregor's Qualia, [...] "Infra", and [...] "Limen", Robert Garland's Spring Rites, Alastair Marriott's Tanglewood, Liam Scarlett's Despite and Wheeldon's DGV.|$|R
6000|$|... "You see, Philip, we {{have plenty}} of time, as we travel at a snail's pace, and in the evening <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>stop,</b> to think over the affair in every light. I always put myself in the {{position}} of the Vicomte de Tulle, and consider what steps I should take to ensure success in my next attempt to carry off Mademoiselle de Pointdexter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In the morning," [...] replied Vittorio, [...] "before we set out, {{there will}} be coffee or tea, and bread and butter, with eggs. Then, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>stop</b> at noon, {{you will have a}} second breakfast of mutton chops, fried potatoes, fried fish, omelets, and other such things. Then, at night, when the day's journey is done, you will have dinner." ...|$|R
60|$|And she did {{sleep until}} {{we reached the}} city. It was about seven o'clock in the morning, I think, when we began to steam slowly by the wharves and piers. I now wished the city were twenty miles further on. I knew that <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>stopped</b> I should have to wake up poor Corny.|$|E
60|$|He cantered away. We {{tried to}} look at each other's faces, and at Bill's {{expression}} in the darkness, but he neither spoke nor stirred until he threw down the reins <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>stopped</b> before the station. The passengers quickly descended from the roof; the Expressman was about to follow, but Bill plucked his sleeve.|$|E
60|$|We had {{proceeded}} {{about a mile}} when {{we heard}} some one behind us calling To-mar by name, and <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>stopped</b> and looked around, we saw a woman running rapidly toward us. As she approached nearer I {{could see that she}} was a very comely creature, and like all her sex that I had seen in Caspak, apparently young.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{you have}} an object; your aims are {{definite}} and you know, more or less, how to carry them out. We others, who have no purpose in life, spend our time in amusements that leave us dissatisfied. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>stop</b> to think, <b>we</b> feel that we might do something better, but we don't know what it is. The outlook is blank." ...|$|R
5000|$|Only <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>stop</b> perceiving {{to think}} about what we have seen or heard, only then do we assess its truth-value. If we are really [...] "into" [...] the fiction - [...] "transported", in the psychologists' term - we are, as Immanuel Kant pointed out long ago, [...] "disinterested". We respond aesthetically, without purpose. We don't judge the truth of what we're perceiving, even though if <b>we</b> <b>stop</b> being transported and think about it, we know quite well it's a fiction.|$|R
6000|$|She turned with a {{question}} graver in her look than usual, and he said: [...] "Yes, we might help them oftener if we could remember that their misery was going on all the time, like some great natural process, day or dark, heat or cold, which seems to <b>stop</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>stop</b> thinking of it. Nothing, for us, at least, exists unless it is recalled to us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why," [...] says he, [...] "Master Captain, {{and what}} if I did? Do you mean to impeach the honor of Captain Leach? I did show it to him one day <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>stopped</b> along the beach for water, if you must be told; but I can promise you that not another soul but {{yourself}} has seen it since I gave King Coffee my written receipt for it." ...|$|E
6000|$|Now I {{made up my}} mind if she {{was going}} to keep up this sort of thing Jone and me would change {{carriages}} <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>stopped</b> at the next station, for comparisons are very different from poetry, and if you try to mix them with scenery you make a mess that is not fit for a Christian. But I thought first I would give her a word back: ...|$|E
60|$|When we {{had risen}} from our knees and stood for a little while, the priest took my left hand in his right, and I, by {{direction}} of my guide, gave my right hand to my wife. And so in a line, the priest leading, we circled round the table in rhythmic measure. Those who supported us moved behind us, holding the crowns over our heads, and replacing them <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>stopped.</b>|$|E
60|$|We {{do indeed}} put a {{prohibition}} upon our trade <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>stop</b> up the stream, and dam up the channel of its consumption, {{by putting a}} slight upon the wearing it, and, as it were, voting it out of fashion; for if you once vote your goods out of wear, you vote {{them out of the}} market, and you had as good vote them contraband.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{pleasant}} {{to me to}} talk English, too," [...] Dick said, [...] "though {{it is only a}} few months since I last spoke it. Now, {{the best thing you can}} do is to try and get off to sleep again. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>stop</b> you shall have breakfast. I am sure you must want something. You have had nothing since you ate a mouthful or two, in my room, before starting." ...|$|R
3000|$|Therefore, one {{question}} that arises is <b>when</b> should <b>we</b> <b>stop</b> the checking routine? In[33], it is proved {{that for the}} cases where all task activations are simultaneously released at t= 0, the worst case load will occur again in multiples of H [...]...|$|R
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>stopped</b> the operation, he {{attended}} to Lucy, whilst I applied digital pressure {{to my own}} incision. I laid down, while I waited his leisure to attend to me, for I felt faint and a little sick. By and by he bound up my wound, and sent me downstairs to get {{a glass of wine}} for myself. As I was leaving the room, he came after me, and half whispered.|$|E
60|$|He was an {{extraordinarily}} chilly devil. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>stopped</b> I {{could hear his}} teeth chattering again. I don’t know what came over me, I {{had a sort of}} nervous fit, was incapable of finding my pockets, let alone the latchkey. I had the illusion of a narrow streak of light {{on the wall of the}} house as if it had been cracked. “I hope we will be able to get in,” I murmured.|$|E
60|$|One {{afternoon}} {{at a little}} village there was a look of festival; the bells were ringing, everybody was hurrying to the church, and <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>stopped</b> {{at the door of}} the inn my brother came to the carriage-window and said he was afraid that we should not find it easy to proceed at once, for a mission priest was holding a station, and no one seemed able to attend to anything else.|$|E
40|$|I proffer {{a defense}} Reid’s Philosophy of Common Sense. I address the initial {{implausibility}} that greets most {{all of us}} <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>stop</b> to consider the prospects for common sense as guide to knowledge and inquiry. I argue that this initial implausibility is based upon a misapprehension of what Reid understands by common sense. I address the justification of common sense. I argue that common sense is justified, even if we cannot give a reason for it. I present an expansion and refinement of Reid’s notion of common sense as what we must take for granted...|$|R
6000|$|... "True," [...] replied Mr. George; [...] "but, then, {{they are}} usually not so sociable there as they are up on the banquette. Besides, {{the noise of the}} wheels on the hard gravel roads is so loud there that we cannot hear very well. Then, moreover, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>stop</b> to change horses, the hostlers and postilions come out, and our coachman and {{conductor}} often {{have a great deal of}} amusing conversation with them, which we can hear from the banquette; but we could not hear it, or see the process of harnessing and unharnessing, from the interior, nor even very well from the coupé." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of all created shiftlessness, this beats everything! Why couldn't we {{have taken}} in enough wood to last the ten miles farther to the {{terminus}} <b>when</b> <b>we</b> last <b>stopped?</b> And why in thunder, with all this firing up, can't we go faster?" ...|$|R
60|$|We {{came to the}} end of the stage, {{and still}} the lost trace was not recovered. I looked at him anxiously <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>stopped</b> to change, but I knew by his yet graver face as he stood {{watching}} the ostlers that he had heard nothing. Almost in an instant afterwards, as I leaned back in my seat, he looked in, with his lighted lantern in his hand, an excited and quite different man.|$|E
6000|$|... 'It was {{not like}} a ghost,' said Rose. 'You know I had come down for the bank-holiday, {{and went back to}} finish my quarter at the art embroidery. Well, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>stopped</b> at the North Westhaven station, I saw a man, woman, and child get in, and it struck me that the boy was Master Michael and the woman Louisa Hall. I think she looked into the {{carriage}} where I was, and I was going to ask her where she was taking him.' ...|$|E
60|$|The sight, as will {{easily be}} supposed, was best at a distance, and, indeed, I {{had enough of}} it. As for my two midshipmen, they were almost frightened out of all their resolutions of going any farther in this horrible place; and <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>stopped</b> they came mighty seriously to me, and begged, for God's sake, not to venture any farther upon the faith of these Spaniards, for that they would {{certainly}} carry us all into some mischief or other, and betray us.|$|E
5000|$|Three {{years after}} his death, the {{magazine}} [...] "Poézi Prolétèr" [...] (No.2), directed by Katalin Molnar and Christophe Tarkos, published in 1998 an article on Wolman including several of his texts gathered under the title [...] "Introduction of the word". Although at times often seen as a side-kick of Guy Debord, he is now regarded, along with Robert Filliou, {{as one of the}} more influential artists of his day. Wolman, however, who started a decade before Filliou, did not subscribe to Filliou's [...] "genius without talent", but rather said that [...] "genius is what <b>we</b> all have <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>stop</b> improving one thing in order to make something else. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> only refuse to have talent" [...] (1964).|$|R
25|$|An {{increase}} in the RD temperament leads us to seek out those behaviors or substances {{that will allow us}} to remain in a pleasant physical and/or mental state, attributing to the fact that we humans are hedonistic individuals, seeking to avoid pain and embracing pleasurable stimuli. Our pleasure and reward systems in the brain are hyper-activated, which makes us display continuous approach behaviors to the reward in question. Our neuro-circuity is as such that <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>stop</b> having access to such pleasurable objects of desire, we then experience negative consequences (withdrawal symptoms). Addictive behaviors then arise to alleviate such negative consequences and the cycle continues.|$|R
40|$|The propagandization of a Net Generation adds {{nothing to}} our {{understanding}} of the digital behaviour of young people. Indeed, it is becoming increasingly obvious that the whole concept of a Net Generation rests on incorrect assumptions. Hence, arguments based on a Net Generation are not only irrelevant and misleading but precarious as well. Precarious in the sense that they are mobilized as a decisive means of engineering change, not least in education policy. Only <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>stop</b> thinking in terms of the Net Generation can we form a more astute vision of when the deployment of digital learning aids will have a realistic chance of success...|$|R
