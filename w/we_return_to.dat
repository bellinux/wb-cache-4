5|$|The total {{incompetence}} of the D.C. {{government in}} Washington, DC, {{has become an}} embarrassment to our entire Nation. This experiment in home rule is a disaster. All of us who serve in this Chamber, well over 95% of us, have held other positions in government. We have been mayors. We have been township trustees, State legislators, and the rest. I am convinced, Mr. Speaker, that there are well over 2,000 township trustees in my congressional district who with one arm tied behind their backs, could blindfolded {{do a better job}} of directing this city than the city council of D.C. It is high time that this experiment in home rule that has proven to be a disaster for our nation be terminated, that <b>we</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> some sort of logical government whereby the rest of us can function in this city.|$|E
500|$|Walter Jackson Bate {{states that}} the poem has [...] "always puzzled readers [...] But finding the poem so elusive, <b>we</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> it only after we know the others far better. If we had hope to use them as keys, we {{discover}} they do not quite fit the lock. Meanwhile they have given us a standard hard to equal. Hence we either feel a disappointment about the 'Ode to Psyche' or else, remembering the care Keats supposedly gave it, we once more put the poem aside for future consideration." [...] However, he also states that [...] "The modern, respectful attitude toward this ode is deserved. But the itch for novelty has encouraged a few critics {{to suggest that the}} poem, in some dark but fundamental way, has more to it as a whole than do the later odes." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Letters That Cross in the Mail" [...] was {{the first}} song {{recorded}} for the album. Streisand claimed that the inspiration behind the track was simple: it is [...] "about love and the postal service". Santopietro wrote that Holmes' love for of [...] "big band sound" [...] and [...] "a full symphonic orchestra" [...] {{is evident in the}} production. Following her cover of [...] "All in Love Is Fair" [...] in 1974, seventh track [...] "You and I" [...] is Streisand's second cover of a Stevie Wonder song. Taken from his 1972 studio album Talking Book, she called the pop song [...] "immediately [...] touch" [...] and considered Wonder [...] "brilliant" [...] for his work on it. Written by Howard Dietz and Ralph Rainger, Streisand's cover of Libby Holman's [...] "Moanin' Low" [...] appears as the eighth song. In order to place focus on the lyrics during the song, the production contains [...] "octave leaps" [...] while Streisand [...] "changes timbre frequently and quickly between loud and soft sections and high and low pitches". Ninth track [...] "A Child Is Born" [...] features a simplistic piano arrangement accompanied solely by Streisand's vocals; Columbia Records executive reacted to the track's new genre for the singer, stating, [...] "You could put Barbra in front of a rock band or a symphony orchestra, she would still be Barbra Streisand, not compromising, not uncomfortable". [...] "Widescreen", the album's closing track, was inspired by the singer's love of film; according to author Patrick E. Horrigan, it specifically explains [...] "how the movies, dark and dreamlike, seduce us into believing that life can be fulfilling, then let us down as soon as <b>we</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> the light of day". It was also the last of four tracks written by Holmes and has a production consisting of [...] "synthesized electronics".|$|E

2500|$|Chief Red Shirt was lionized by the British {{press and}} photographed by reporters {{wherever}} he went. His handsome features and stately bearing caused reporters {{to hang on}} his every word and he became the most quoted Wild Wester celebrity of Cody’s trip to England. Red Shirt explained to a reporter from Sheffield: “I started from my lodge two moons ago knowing nothing, and had I remained on the Native Reservations, I should have been as a blind man. [...] Now I can see a new dawn. I have seen the great houses (ships) which cross the mighty waters, the great villages which have no end where the pale faces swarm like insects in the summer sun. Our people will wonder at these things when <b>we</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> the Native Reservation {{and tell them what}} we have seen.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Guitarist Wacław [...] "Vogg" [...] Kiełtyka {{commented on}} the album, [...] "Extreme and groove — I think that's {{the best way to}} {{describe}} our new album. This time we feel that we have something totally crushing and huge. Blood Mantra is the most heavy and mature album we ever did in our career. I cannot wait to start to play songs live because riffs are soo deep and powerful." [...] He also stated, [...] "We flirt with various tempos mixing death metal with grindcore and almost outright black metal atmosphere together with more, so to speak, 'crowd-puller' beats verging on groovy, almost stoner-rock climates. There are also a few more modern metal rhythmic riffs where <b>we</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> the climate of Organic Hallucinosis album. I'm certain that the very fact we are again, after 9 years, in Hertz studio will evoke the spirit of that album. The vocals sound very promising. Rasta [...] is a much more experienced vocalist compared to the Carnival Is Forever album times. And his voice sounds more powerful and deeper." ...|$|E

And the Great Spirit speaks to me {{sometimes}} since I have been here. [...] When I {{was in the}} Great Spirit Lodge (Westminster Abbey) where the kings are buried, I laid my face upon my hands. [...] The words of the preacher I did not know, but they sounded like the softy winds through a leafy forest and my eyelids were heavy. [...] Then I heard soft music and sweet voices, and a great cloud came down towards me, and when it nearly touched me, it opened and I saw {{in a blaze of}} light the girls with wings and they beckoned me. [...] And I was so certain that what I saw was that, I called out to my young men who were with me ‘Come and see what this is,’ and the young men replied, “You have been dreaming.’ But what I saw was true, for when I looked around the great lodge afterwards, I saw on the walls the same girls with wings as I saw in my dreams. [...] Our people will wonder at these things, when <b>we</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> the Native Reservation and tell them what we have seen.” ...|$|E
