The main designer was Jerzy Rudlicki (the letter [...] "R" [...] in the designation for his name). The prototype R-VIII was flown in March, 1928. It was fitted with a [...] Farman 12We <b>W-engine,</b> but in tests proved to be underpowered. In July 1928 the second prototype was completed with a more powerful [...] Lorraine-Dietrich 18Kd engine. In August 1928 it flew in the Aviation Contest of the Little Entente and Poland. It achieved the best result in trials of carrying a payload (1024 kg to an altitude of 5000 m).|$|E
