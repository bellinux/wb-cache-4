5|$|The {{plan for}} the battle was {{straightforward}} for both sides.

25|$|The band {{recorded}} and completed their Terry Date-produced album, tentatively titled Eros, in 2008, {{and it was}} expected to be released in early 2009.

25|$|Because of its {{distinct}} {{culture and}} beautiful landscapes, Brittany has inspired many French artists since the 19th century. The Pont-Aven School, which started {{to emerge in}} the 1850s and lasted until the beginning of the 20th century, had a decisive influence on modern painting. The artists who settled in Pont-Aven <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> away from the Academic style of the École des Beaux-Arts and later from Impressionism when it began to decline. Among them were Paul Gauguin, Paul Signac, Marc Chagall, Paul Sérusier and Raymond Wintz. Before them, Brittany had also been visited by Academic and Romantic painters like Jean Antoine Théodore de Gudin and Jules Achille Noël who were looking for dramatic seascapes and storms.|$|E

25|$|Bismarck's {{eight years}} in Frankfurt were marked by changes in his {{political}} opinions, detailed in the numerous lengthy memoranda, which he sent to his ministerial superiors in Berlin. No longer {{under the influence of}} his ultraconservative Prussian friends, Bismarck became less reactionary and more pragmatic. He became convinced that to countervail Austria's newly restored influence, Prussia would have to ally herself with other German states. As a result, he grew to be more accepting of the notion of a united German nation. He gradually came to believe that he and his fellow conservatives had {{to take the lead in}} the drive toward creating a unified nation in order to keep from being eclipsed. He also believed that the middle-class liberals wanted a unified Germany more than they <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> the grip of the traditional forces over society.|$|E
25|$|The {{death of}} the 11 {{soldiers}} turned public opinion against {{the peace process and}} boosted the popularity of its main opponent, Álvaro Uribe. In an Ipsos poll, Santos' approval fell from 40% to 29% compared to November 2014, pessimism in the peace process increased 16 points to 69% during the same period and former President Uribe's favourable image increased from 41% to 57%. Nevertheless, only 27% of respondents in the poll <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> off dialogues and launch a military offensive. For a skeptical public, the FARC's attack was sign that their ceasefire had been deceitful and only heightened frustration with a peace process which had recorded no formal agreement since May 2014. However, according to the Conflict analysis resource centre (Cerac), the attack on the soldiers was the only severe violation of the ceasefire, given that the FARC had generally complied with their ceasefire up to that point, resulting in the lowest levels of violence in the conflict since 1984.|$|E

He did his national service in the Royal Army Medical Corps, serving from 1955 until 1957. At the same time, he took up acting, studying at the Rose Bruford College of Speech and Drama, Sidcup in 1956 where he met his first wife.

25|$|Isabella {{first came}} to Genoa City to {{distract}} Paul Williams {{as a favor to}} Michael Baldwin (Christian LeBlanc), who <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> up Paul and his wife, Christine. Isabella approached Paul at his office with a case against her husband, which he took. Paul gave Isabella shelter, and the two were drawn to each other. Upon the ending of the case, Isabella's past as a call girl came out, but Paul forgave Isabella for lying, and they became even closer. Isabella was keen on leaving the city after the case was over, but both Michael and Paul had their reasons for keeping her in town. Isabella was surprised to learn that she was pregnant with Paul's child. Paul's marriage took another hit when Christine returned home to find him passionately kissing Isabella. However, Isabella didn't want Paul, and she decided to tell Michael that she was carrying his child after a night of passion that they had. Michael reluctantly agreed to pay for her expenses and went along with all of her demands, while Paul became closer to his ex-wife, Lauren Fenmore (Tracey E. Bregman). Paul found out that he was the father of Isabella's child and decided to raise his son with her. Both Michael and Mary Williams (Carolyn Conwell), Paul's mother, were not happy to learn the truth. Mary did her best to break up the couple, and Paul eventually realized that he couldn't be one happy family with Isabella and their baby.|$|E

500|$|Fincher was {{concerned}} that bands experienced in writing film scores {{would be unable to}} tie the movie's themes together, so he sought a band which had never recorded for film. He pursued Radiohead, but ultimately chose the breakbeat producing duo Dust Brothers to score the film. The duo created a post-modern score that included drum loops, electronic scratches, and computerized samples. Dust Brothers performer Michael Simpson explained the setup: [...] "Fincher <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> new ground with everything about the movie, and a nontraditional score helped achieve that."
