Later that month, after Miers had faced intense criticism, Laura Bush questioned whether the charges were sexist in nature.|$|E

5|$|In March 1888, Riley {{traveled}} to Washington, D.C. {{where he had}} dinner at the <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>with</b> {{other members of the}} International Copyright League and President of the United States Grover Cleveland. Riley made a brief performance for the dignitaries at the event before speaking about the need for international copyright protections. Cleveland was enamored by Riley's performance and invited him back for a private meeting during which the two men discussed cultural topics. In the 1888 Presidential Election campaign, Riley's acquaintance Benjamin Harrison was nominated as the Republican candidate. Although Riley had shunned politics for most of his life, he gave Harrison a personal endorsement and participated in fund-raising events and vote stumping. The election was exceptionally partisan in Indiana, and Riley found the atmosphere of the campaign stressful; he vowed never to become involved with politics again.|$|E
5|$|Roosevelt was {{receiving}} many letters from supporters {{urging him to}} run, and Republican office-holders were organizing on his behalf. Balked on many policies by an unwilling Congress and courts in his full term in the White House, he saw manifestations of public support he believed would sweep him to the <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>with</b> a mandate for progressive policies that would brook no opposition. In February, Roosevelt announced he would accept the Republican nomination if it was offered to him. Taft felt that if he lost in November, {{it would be a}} repudiation of the party, but if he lost renomination, it would be a rejection of himself. He was reluctant to oppose Roosevelt, who helped make him president, but having become president, he was determined to be president, and that meant not standing aside to allow Roosevelt to gain another term.|$|E
5|$|Early {{work was}} {{promising}} {{and by the}} fall of 1976 the project was building momentum. Fans organized a mail campaign that flooded the <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>with</b> 400,000 letters, influencing President Gerald Ford to rechristen the Space Shuttle Constitution to Enterprise. Bryant and Scott's proposal became the first accepted by the studio in October; Roddenberry immediately stopped work on other projects to refocus on Star Trek, and the screenwriters and producers were swamped with grateful fan mail. By the start of 1977 the project's official title was changed to Star Trek—The Motion Picture (a title reapplied to the eventually released 1979 film). The elation was short-lived; the first draft of the completed script was not finished until March 1, 1977, and pressure was mounting for Paramount to either begin production or cut its losses and cancel the project. Producer Jerry Isenberg began scouting filming locations and hired designers and illustrators to complement the script.|$|E

Kramer told Petrelis he was giving a speech at the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual & Transgender Community Center on the upcoming Tuesday night, as a last-minute substitute for the scheduled speaker, writer Nora Ephron.

25|$|The Wye River Memorandum was a {{political}} agreement negotiated to implement the Oslo Accords, completed on 23 October 1998. It was signed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat. It was negotiated at Wye River, MD (at the Wye River Conference Center) and signed at the <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>with</b> President Bill Clinton as the official witness. On 17 November 1998, Israel's 120-member parliament, the Knesset, approved the Wye River Memorandum {{by a vote of}} 75-19.

It was the first time since 1968 that a candidate won the <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>with</b> under 50% of the popular vote.

25|$|Kent State/Cambodia Incursion Protest, Washington, D.C.: A {{week after}} the Kent State {{shooting}}s, on May 4, 100,000 anti-war demonstrators converged on Washington, D.C. to protest the shooting {{of the students in}} Ohio and the Nixon administration's incursion into Cambodia. Even though the demonstration was quickly put together, protesters were still able to bring out thousands to march in the Capital. It was an almost spontaneous response to the events of the previous week. Police ringed the <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>with</b> buses to block the demonstrators from getting too close to the executive mansion. Early in the morning before the march, Nixon met with protesters briefly at the Lincoln Memorial but nothing was resolved and the protest went on as planned.|$|E
25|$|While not overtly political, {{the film}} {{documents}} {{that the federal}} government of the United States under the Presidency of George W. Bush joined the auto-industry suit against California in 2002. This pushed California to abandon its ZEV mandate regulation. The film notes that Bush's chief of staff Andrew Card had recently been head of the American Automobile Manufacturers Alliance in California and then joined the <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>with</b> Dick Cheney, Condoleezza Rice, and other federal officials who were former executives or board members of oil and auto companies. By failing to increase mileage standards in a meaningful way since the 1970s and now interfering in California, the federal government had again served short-term industry interests at the expense of long-range leadership on issues of oil dependency and cleaner cars.|$|E
25|$|On July 29, Garfield {{met with}} his Cabinet for the only time during his illness; the members were under strict {{instruction}} from the doctors not to discuss anything upsetting. Garfield became increasingly ill {{over a period of}} several weeks due to infection, which caused his heart to weaken. He remained bedridden in the <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>with</b> fevers and extreme pains. Garfield's weight dropped from over two hundred pounds (90.7 kilograms) to 135 pounds (61.2 kilograms) as his inability to keep down and digest food took its toll. Because of his inability to digest food, nutrient enemas were given in an attempt to extend his life. Blood poisoning and infection set in and for a brief period the President suffered from hallucinations. Pus-filled abscesses spread all over Garfield's body as the infections raged.|$|E
