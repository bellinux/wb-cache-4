5|$|Walsh {{identified}} drinks as {{the central}} Diageo business, and began selling off assets that did not fit this model. He sold Pillsbury to General Mills in 2001 for $10.1 billion, and Burger King to the private equity firm Texas Pacific Group in 2002 for $1.5 billion. He suggested {{that he would have}} liked to have sold Burger King earlier, but was worried about Diageo's capacity to handle both transactions simultaneously. In a strategy to bolster Diageo's drinks sales, in 2001 he acquired the Seagram drinks business from Vivendi Universal in conjunction with Pernod Ricard for $8.2 billion, an action that was later credited with refocusing and re-energising Diageo. At the time, analysts suggested that Walsh had overpaid, and that Pernod Ricard had gained control of the better brands. Despite having entered into an alliance with Pernod in order to avoid regulatory issues, Diageo was still forced to divest the Malibu Rum brand after acquiring Captain Morgan. Walsh defended the deal on the basis of efficiency savings and the fact that the deal was almost entirely financed by the sale of Pillsbury. Of the acquisition he says:We moved in on that Seagram deal and forced their hand very quickly while our competitors were still trying to get their act together. If you look at what <b>we</b> <b>paid</b> it will go down in history as the bargain of the century. It was an $8.1bn total price of which our part was about $5.6bn and it was at economic profit break even at the end of year two. It’s produced phenomenal returns. If you look at Pernod’s Allied Domecq acquisition, it is 30 per cent higher in multiple terms and you’re not getting as good a collection of brands.|$|E
25|$|The 1950-51 side under Freddie Brown...was full of inexperienced {{players and}} <b>we</b> <b>paid</b> the penalty. I'm sure {{if we had}} {{selected}} one or two solid players such as Jack Robertson, Dennis Brookes, Jack Ikin and Bill Edrich we would have won the Ashes - in spite of once again being caught on a glue-pot at Brisbane. Two Tests were lost by a very small margin and we won the last. In addition Denis Compton was a complete failure in the Tests, scoring only 53 runs in four matches. In spite of the critics the bowling proved adequate and Freddie Brown did a grand job {{in view of the}} shortcomings of the side. To me the annoying part was that we had players in England who could have won the series for us.|$|E
500|$|The Honoured Dead Memorial, a {{sandstone}} edifice {{commissioned by}} Cecil Rhodes and designed by Sir Herbert Baker, was erected {{to commemorate the}} defenders who fell during the Siege. Twenty-seven soldiers are entombed in the memorial, which was made from stone quarried in the Matopo Hills in Zimbabwe. [...] It bears an inscription by Rudyard Kipling: [...] "This for a charge to our children in sign of the price <b>we</b> <b>paid,</b> The price that <b>we</b> <b>paid</b> for freedom that comes unsoiled to your hand; Read, revere and uncover, here are the victors laid, They who died for their City, being sons of the land". Long Cecil, the gun manufactured in the De Beers workshops during the Siege, is mounted on the stylobate (facing the Free State), surrounded by shells from the Boer Long Tom.|$|E

According to Madden, the Oakland victory in the Heidi Game [...] "was kind of {{the start of the}} Raiders being a great team. One of the things we were doing was getting these fantastic come-from-behind things...We didn't even know about the Heidi thing until we read about it the next day." [...] Namath noted, [...] "When I remember that game, it brings to mind the revenge factor we had against them going into the championship game. <b>We</b> <b>paid</b> them back then", to which Madden chuckled, [...] "He's full of crap." ...|$|E
500|$|In Game 1 of the Eastern Division Finals, the Celtics met the Syracuse Nationals, {{who were}} led by Dolph Schayes. In Russell's first NBA playoff game, he {{finished}} with 16 points and 31 rebounds, along with a reported 7 blocks. (At the time, blocks were not yet an officially registered statistic.) After the Celtics' 108–89 victory, Schayes quipped, [...] "How much does that guy make a year? It would be to our advantage if <b>we</b> <b>paid</b> him off for five years {{to get away from}} us in the rest of this series." [...] The Celtics swept the Nationals in three games to earn the franchise's first appearance in the NBA Finals.|$|E
500|$|Ahead of a March2011 {{friendly}} against United States, Chapman unexpectedly {{withdrew from}} the England squad and quit international football. The decision, related to Chapman's family commitments, {{was reported to have}} left England's World Cup preparations in disarray. Hope Powell praised Chapman as [...] "a wonderful servant to England over the years". Chapman later confirmed she had been unhappy about a perceived lack of support with childcare costs and arrangements while on international duty. At the 2011 World Cup, Powell stressed that the FA had tried hard to accommodate Chapman's requirements: [...] "Katie was away with us in 2009 when <b>we</b> <b>paid</b> for her family to come along {{but at the end of}} the day there is not a bottomless pit of money in the women's game." ...|$|E

[...] Another survivor, Francis Webster, was quoted as having said, [...] "Was I sorry that I chose to come by hand cart? No. Neither then nor any minute of my life since. The price <b>we</b> <b>paid</b> to become acquainted with God was a privilege to pay and I am thankful that I was privileged to come in the Martin Hand Cart Company."

500|$|When Azerbaijan officially awarded no {{points to}} Dina Garipova of Russia, despite Garipova having {{reportedly}} come {{second in the}} country's phone poll, the Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev ordered an inquiry. The Russian Foreign Affairs Minister Sergei Lavrov claimed that the result had been falsified, and stated that [...] "this outrageous action will not remain without a response". He promised a co-ordinated response with his Azerbaijani counterpart Elmar Mammadyarov. Simultaneously, the Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko claimed that his own country having received no points from Russia showed that the result must have been falsified. In June 2013, UK entrant Bonnie Tyler also claimed she overheard Russians complaining that Azerbaijan did not [...] "give us the ten points <b>we</b> <b>paid</b> for." [...] Event supervisor Sietse Bakker said the claims were being investigated by the European Broadcasting Union as well.|$|E
500|$|Within the Labour Party, Livingstone {{was aligned}} with the hard left. Historian Alwyn W. Turner noted that Livingstone's entire {{approach}} to politics revolved not simply around providing public services, but in trying to change society itself; in his words, {{he wanted to get}} away from the concept of [...] "old white men coming along to general management committees and talking about rubbish collection." [...] Biographer John Carvel, a journalist from The Guardian, remarked that Livingstone's political motivation was a [...] "fundamental desire... for a more participative, cooperative society", leading him to oppose [...] "concentrations of power and... exploitation in all its forms – economic, racial and sexual." [...] However, Livingstone has also described his approach to fiscal policy as [...] "monetarist": [...] "I was a monetarist right from the beginning when I was leader of the GLC. <b>We</b> <b>paid</b> down debt every year.

500|$|A {{number of}} Milan players {{who had played}} in the 2005 final were delighted with the victory after they lost two years previous. Kaká claimed victory was all the sweeter as a result: [...] "What {{happened}} then was strange, just six minutes when we played not so good and <b>we</b> <b>paid</b> for that." [...] Milan midfielder Gennaro Gattuso echoed his teammates sentiments: [...] "The defeat two years ago will stay me for a lifetime, {{but this is a}} different story. It's our turn to celebrate now." [...] Striker Filippo Inzaghi, who missed the final in 2005, was delighted to have scored the goals that won the final for Milan: [...] "I've scored quite a few times in Europe, but scoring in the Champions League final is something special." [...] Milan President and owner Silvio Berlusconi was equally delighted about the success, adding that [...] "the fortune we lacked in Istanbul we had with us tonight." ...|$|E
500|$|The Sunderland Echo was {{launched}} {{with an initial}} investment of £3,500, raised by donations of £500 each from Storey and his business partners. Those joining the venture were Quaker banker Edward Backhouse, shipbroker and MP Edward Temperley Gourley, shipbuilder and MP Sir Charles Palmer, newspaper editor Richard Ruddock, rope-maker Thomas Glaholm and draper Thomas Scott Turnbull. Lack of experience—only Ruddock had previous knowledge of newspaper management—and over-optimistic estimates of costs meant that the initial funds were quickly exhausted. Storey later admitted: [...] "In our childlike, simple ways, we thought this might be sufficient, but {{in a few months}} all the money was gone, so <b>we</b> <b>paid</b> in another £3,500 and that soon went too." [...] As the prospect of any great financial success receded, Ruddock, Gourley and Palmer withdrew from the project. Storey, however, remained dedicated to the idea, and took on their shares. A further £7,000 in investment from Storey enabled the remaining partners to abandon the [...] "wheezing flat-bed press" [...] and, in July 1876, the Echo moved to new premises at 14Bridge Street, Sunderland.|$|E

We glanced at the orchestra and supper-room as we hurried past—we just recognised them, and that was all. We bent our steps to the firework-ground; there, at least, we should not be disappointed. We reached it, and stood rooted to the spot with mortification and astonishment. That the Moorish tower—that wooden shed with a door in the centre, and daubs of crimson and yellow all round, like a gigantic watch-case! That the place where night after night we had beheld the undaunted Mr. Blackmore make his terrific ascent, surrounded by flames of fire, and peals of artillery, and where the white garments of Madame Somebody (we forget even her name now), who nobly devoted her life to the manufacture of fireworks, had so often been seen fluttering in the wind, as she called up a red, blue, or party-coloured light to illumine her temple! ...|$|E

500|$|In January 2007, it was {{reported}} that May and England defender Glen Johnson were caught at a B store in Dartford, Kent, attempting to steal bathroom fittings. They both received £80 fines. Johnson described the incident as [...] "comical" [...] because it was a misunderstanding — [...] "Ben was doing up his bathroom so we went to B and found one of those sets where you get everything in one box. But he wanted a seat with a slow-close lid, so we took out the seat and put in another one. What we didn't know was that the new seat was £2.35 more expensive. We went through the till, paid for it and then the security guard stopped us and said he had been watching on CCTV. We just burst out laughing. Where's Jeremy Beadle then? But he said, 'No, this is serious, the police are on their way.' The police turned up and they were laughing. I said to the security guard, 'Can we not just pay the £2.35?'" [...] He said, 'No, this is a serious offence.' So the police gave us two options: go to court and fight it out, or pay an on-the-spot fine. We couldn't be bothered going to court so <b>we</b> <b>paid</b> the fine but doing that made us look guilty".|$|E
500|$|Stump and Wentz met up for {{the first}} time in several years in early 2012 for a writing session. Wentz reached out to Stump after he penned his letter, as he too felt he was in a dark place and needed a {{creative}} outlet. He was at first reluctant to approach Stump, likening the phone call to reconnecting with a lover after years of acrimony. [...] "I know what you need – you need your band," [...] Wentz told Stump. [...] "I think it's kind of weird that we haven't really seen each other this year. <b>We</b> <b>paid</b> for each other's houses and you don't know my kid," [...] Wentz remarked. The result, [...] "three or four" [...] new songs, were shelved with near immediacy, with the two concluding that [...] "it just wasn't right and didn't feel right." [...] Several months later, the two reconvened and wrote tracks that they felt truly represented the band in a modern form. The band decided that if a comeback was in order, it must represent the band in its current form: [...] "We didn't want to come back just to bask in the glory days and, like, and collect a few checks and pretend ... and do our best 2003 impersonation," [...] said Stump. Afterwards, the quartet held an all-day secret meeting at their manager's home in New York City where they discussed ideas and the mechanics of getting together to record. Trohman was the last to be contacted, through a three-hour phone call from Stump. As Trohman was arguably the most excited to begin other projects, he had a list of stipulations for rejoining the band. [...] "If I'm not coming back to this band writing music [...] then I don't want to," [...] he remarked. Stump supported Trohman's ambition saying Trohman [...] "needed to be writing more." ...|$|E
