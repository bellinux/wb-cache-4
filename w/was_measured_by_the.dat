5|$|The {{distance}} to Beta Pictoris {{and many other}} stars <b>was</b> <b>measured</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Hipparcos satellite. This was done by measuring its trigonometric parallax: the slight displacement in its position observed as the Earth moves around the Sun. Beta Pictoris was found to exhibit a parallax of 51.87 milliarcseconds, a value which was later revised to 51.44 milliarcseconds when the data was reanalyzed taking systematic errors more carefully into account. The {{distance to}} Beta Pictoris is therefore 63.4 light years, with an uncertainty of 0.1 light years.|$|E
5|$|The 26th Infantry's initial {{attack on}} 13 October {{provided}} important insight {{on the nature}} of the fighting; American infantry had been ambushed by German defenders using sewers and cellars, forcing the advancing American infantry to clear each opening before continuing down streets, while Sherman tanks found it impossible to maneuver to suppress enemy fire. German civilians were cleared as the 26th Infantry advanced; no Germans were allowed to remain in the Americans' rear. Success in Aachen <b>was</b> <b>measured</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> number of houses captured, as the advance proved to be sluggish; in order to cope with the thick walls of the older buildings in the city, the 26th Infantry Regiment used howitzers at point blank range to destroy German fortifications. The howitzer created passageways that allowed infantrymen to advance from building to building without having to enter the city's streets, where they could be pinned down by enemy fire. Sherman tanks were ambushed, as they entered intersections, by concealed German anti-tank guns. Soon thereafter, American tanks and other armored vehicles would advance cautiously, often shooting buildings ahead of the accompanying infantry to clear them of possible defenders. Pinned on the surface by Allied aircraft, German infantrymen would use sewers to deploy behind American formations to attack them from the rear. German resistance was fierce, as they launched small counterattacks and used armor to halt American movements.|$|E

Within a few years oil tanks below the waterline were considered indispensable parts of the underwater armor scheme employed in American dreadnoughts.|$|E

The middlemen leased large tracts of land from the landlords on long leases with fixed rents, which they then sublet as they saw fit. They would split a holding into smaller and smaller parcels so as {{to increase the amount of}} rent they could obtain. Tenants could be evicted for reasons such as non-payment of rents (which were high), or a landlord's decision to raise sheep instead of grain crops. A cottier paid his rent by working for the landlord.|$|E
2500|$|The deputy barmasters {{whom the}} chief barmaster {{appointed}} were experienced local men. Some {{of them were}} yeoman farmer/miners and others local gentlemen. [...] The deputy barmasters actually ran the system. It was they who initiated much {{of the business of}} the Court. It was they, in administering the rules, who determined whether a miner should have a particular mine or whether another should lose one. Their duties required {{them to be able to}} read, write and keep account of granting and removing title to mines and of ore production and the duties levied on it. As ore was brought from a mine, it <b>was</b> <b>measured</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> dish and the barmaster collected each 13th dish, a royalty or duty known as lot. This was the barmaster's reckoning. A further duty of sixpence a load (9 dishes) was paid by the merchants who bought the ore from the miners. This second duty was called cope.|$|E
2500|$|Further {{evidence}} for domain general statistical learning was suggested {{in a study}} run through the University of Cornell Department of Psychology concerning visual statistical learning in infancy. [...] Researchers in this study questioned whether domain generality of statistical learning in infancy would be seen using visual information. After first viewing images in statistically predictable patterns, infants were then exposed to the same familiar patterns in addition to novel sequences of the same identical stimulus components. Interest in the visuals <b>was</b> <b>measured</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> amount of time the child looked at the stimuli in which the researchers named “looking time.” All ages of infant participants showed more interest in the novel sequence relative to the familiar sequence. In demonstrating a preference for the novel sequences (which violated the transitional probability that defined the grouping of the original stimuli) {{the results of the}} study support the likelihood of domain general statistical learning in infancy.|$|E

2500|$|The Dutch {{units of}} {{measurement}} used today {{are those of the}} metric system. Before the 19th century, a wide variety of different weights and measures were used by the various Dutch towns and provinces. Despite the country's small size, {{there was a lack of}} uniformity. During the Dutch Golden Age, these weights and measures accompanied the Dutch to the farthest corners of their colonial empire, including South Africa, New Amsterdam and the Dutch East Indies. Units of weight included the pond, ons and last. There was also an apothecaries' system of weights. The mijl and roede were measurements of distance. Smaller distances were measured in units based on parts of the body – the el, the voet, the palm and the duim. Area <b>was</b> <b>measured</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> morgen, hont, roede and voet. Units of volume included the okshoofd, aam, anker, stoop, and mingel. [...] At the start of the 19th century the Dutch adopted a unified metric system, but it was based on a modified version of the metric system, different from the system used today. In 1869, this was realigned with the international metric system. These old {{units of measurement}} have disappeared, but they remain a colourful legacy of the Netherlands' maritime and commercial importance and survive today in a number of Dutch sayings and expressions.|$|E

60|$|From 1819 to 1883 Egypt {{ruled the}} Soudan. Her rule was not kindly, wise, or profitable. Its {{aim was to}} exploit, not to improve the local population. The miseries of the people were aggravated rather than lessened: but they were concealed. For the rough {{injustice}} of the sword there were substituted the intricacies of corruption and bribery. Violence and plunder were more hideous, since they were cloaked with legality and armed with authority. The land was undeveloped and poor. It barely sustained its inhabitants. The additional burden of a considerable foreign garrison and a crowd of rapacious officials increased {{the severity of the}} economic conditions. Scarcity was frequent. Famines were periodical. Corrupt and incapable Governors-General succeeded each other at Khartoum with bewildering rapidity. The constant changes, while they prevented the continuity of any wise policy, did not interrupt the misrule. With hardly any exceptions, the Pashas were consistent in oppression. The success of their administration <b>was</b> <b>measured</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Ministries in Egypt by the amount of money they could extort from the natives; among the officials in the Soudan, by the number of useless offices they could create. There were a few bright examples of honest men, but these, by providing a contrast, only increased the discontents.|$|E
60|$|Day {{after day}} the papers {{were full of}} the facts, and it was weeks before the {{editorial}} homilies ceased. From time to time, fresh details and unexpected revelations, wise guesses and shameless fakes, renewed {{the interest of the}} original fact. There were days when there was nothing about it in the papers, and then days when it broke out in vivid paragraphs and whole lurid columns again. It was not that the fraud was singular in its features; these were common to most of the defalcations, great and small, which were of daily fame in the newspapers. But the doubt as to the man's fate, and the enduring mystery of his whereabouts, if he were still alive, were qualities that gave peculiar poignancy to Northwick's case. Its results in the failure of people not directly involved, were greater than could have been expected; and the sum of his peculations mounted under investigation. It was all much worse than had been imagined, and in most of the editorial sermons upon it the moral gravity of the offence <b>was</b> <b>measured</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> amounts stolen and indirectly lost by it.

60|$|Then {{machinery}} {{came into}} the lives of men, and steam power, and there began that change of scale which is going on still to-day, making an ever-widening separation of master and man and an ever-enlarging organization of industry and social method. Its most striking manifestation was at first the substitution of organized manufacture in factories for the half-domestic hand-industrialism of the earlier period; the growth of the fortunes of some of the merchants and manufacturers to dimensions comparable with the wealth of the great landowners, and the sinking of the rest of their class towards the status of wage-earners. The development of joint-stock enterprise arose concurrently with this to create a new sort of partnership capable of handling far greater concerns than any single wealthy person, as wealth <b>was</b> <b>measured</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> old scale, could do. There followed a great development of transit, culminating for a time in the coming of the railways and steamships, which abolished the isolation of the old towns and brought men at the remotest quarters of the earth into business competition. Big towns of the modern type, with half-a-million inhabitants or more, grew up rapidly all over Europe and America. For the European big towns are as modern as New York, and the East End and south side of London scarcely older than Chicago. Shopkeeping, like manufactures, began to concentrate in large establishments, and big wholesale distribution to replace individual buying and selling. As the need for public education under the changing conditions of life grew more and more urgent, the individual enterprise of this school-master and that gave place to the organized effort of such giant societies as (in Britain) the old National School Society and the British School Society, and at last to State education. And one after another the old prosperous middle-class callings fell under the stress of the new development.|$|E
