500|$|The {{game was}} sent to Nintendo of America for testing. The sales manager disliked it for being too {{different}} from the maze and shooter games common at the time, and Judy and Lincoln expressed reservations over the strange title. Still, Arakawa adamantly believed {{that it would be}} big. American staffers asked Yamauchi to change the name, but he refused. Arakawa and the American staff began translating the storyline for the cabinet art and naming the other characters. They chose [...] "Pauline" [...] for the Lady, after Polly James, wife of Nintendo's Redmond, Washington, <b>warehouse</b> <b>manager,</b> Don James. The name of [...] "Jumpman", a name originally chosen for its similarity to the popular brands Walkman and Pac-Man, was eventually changed to [...] "Mario" [...] in likeness of Mario Segale, the landlord of the original office space of Nintendo of America. These character names were printed on the American cabinet art and used in promotional materials. Donkey Kong was ready for release.|$|E

Along {{with many}} other Australian Flying Corps personnel, {{including}} Colonel Watt, Major King, and Captain Les Holden, Malley returned to Australia aboard the troopship Kaisar-i-Hind, disembarking in Sydney on 19June. He subsequently toured the country to promote the Peace Loan. On 24August, while travelling from Melbourne to Sydney to commence his series of demonstration flights around New South Wales, Malley crashed his Avro 504K during takeoff from Benalla, Victoria. He was uninjured but {{had to return to}} Melbourne and eventually made his way north by train. Resuming his aerial program, he was reported on 17September as having [...] "thrilled" [...] lunch-time crowds in Sydney the previous day with [...] "three daring spiral dives" [...] over Hyde Park. Malley was discharged from the AIF on 4October 1919, and commissioned a captain in the Commonwealth Military Forces Reserve on 1July 1920. He rejoined Malley's as a <b>warehouse</b> <b>manager</b> in 1921. In May that year, he served with Les Holden and other veteran pilots as a pall-bearer at Watt's funeral in Randwick. On 25January 1922, Malley married Phyllis Kathleen Dare in Mosman. The union would produce one son, Maldon. Malley was acknowledged as both a source and a reviewer by F.M. Cutlack in the latter's volume on the Australian Flying Corps, first published in 1923 as part of the official history of Australia in the war.|$|E

2500|$|Miyamoto {{imagined}} many {{characters and}} plot concepts, but eventually {{settled on a}} love triangle between a gorilla, a carpenter, and a girl. He meant to mirror the rivalry between comic characters Bluto and Popeye for the woman Olive Oyl, although Nintendo could not gain the rights to a Popeye adaptation. Bluto evolved into an ape, a form Miyamoto claimed was [...] "nothing too evil or repulsive". This ape would be the pet of the main character, [...] "a funny, hang-loose kind of guy." [...] Miyamoto also named [...] "Beauty and the Beast" [...] and the 1933 film King Kong as influences. Donkey Kong {{marked the first time}} that the formulation of a video game's storyline preceded the actual programming, rather than simply being appended as an afterthought. Miyamoto had high hopes for his new project, but lacked the technical skills to program it himself; instead, he conceived the game's concepts, then consulted technicians on whether they were possible. He wanted to make the characters different sizes, move in different manners, and react in various ways. However, Yokoi viewed Miyamoto's original design as too complex. Yokoi suggested using see-saws to catapult the hero across the screen; however, this proved too difficult to program. Miyamoto next thought of using sloped platforms and ladders for travel, with barrels for obstacles. When he asked that the game have multiple stages, the four-man programming team complained that he was essentially asking them to make the game repeat, but the team eventually successfully programmed the game. When the game was sent to Nintendo of America for testing, the sales manager disapproved of its vast differentiation from the maze and shooter games common at the time. When American staffers began naming the characters, they settled on [...] "Pauline" [...] for the woman, after Polly James, wife of Nintendo's Redmond, Washington, <b>warehouse</b> <b>manager,</b> Don James. The playable character, initially [...] "Jumpman", was eventually named for Mario Segale, the warehouse landlord. These character names were printed on the American cabinet art and used in promotional materials. The staff also pushed for an English name, and thus it received the title Donkey Kong.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} role of strategic alignment {{in the success of}} data warehouse implementation. Data warehouse technology is inherently complex, requires significant capital investment and development time. Many organizations fail to realize the full benefits from it. While failure to realize benefits has been attributed to numerous causes, ranging from technical to organizational reasons, the underlying strategic alignment issues have not been studied. This research confirms, through two case studies, that the successful adoption of the data warehouse depends on its alignment to the business plans and strategy. The research found that the factors that are critical to the alignment of data warehouses to business strategy and plans are (a) joint responsibility between data <b>warehouse</b> and business <b>managers,</b> (b) alignment between data warehouse plan and business plan, (c) business user satisfaction, (d) flexibility in data warehouse planning and (e) technical integration of the data warehouse. In the case studies, the impact of strategic alignment was visible both at implementation and use levels. The key findings from the case studies are that a) Senior management commitment and involvement are necessary for the initiation of the data warehouse project. The awareness and involvement of data <b>warehouse</b> <b>managers</b> in corporate strategies and a high level of joint responsibility between business and data <b>warehouse</b> <b>managers</b> is critical to strategic alignment and successful adoption of the data warehouse. b) Communication of the strategic direction between the business and data <b>warehouse</b> <b>managers</b> is important for the strategic alignment of the data warehouse. Significant knowledge sharing among the stakeholders and frequent communication between the data <b>warehouse</b> <b>managers</b> and users facilitates better understanding of the data warehouse and its successful adoption. c) User participation in the data warehouse project, perceived usefulness of the data warehouse, ease of use and data quality (accuracy, consistency, reliability and timelines) were significant factors in strategic alignment of the data warehouse. d) Technology selection based on its ability to address business and user requirements, and the skills and response of the data warehousing team led to better alignment of the data warehouse to business plans and strategies. e) The flexibility to respond to changes in business needs and flexibility in data warehouse planning is critical to strategic alignment and successful adoption of the data warehouse. Alignment is seen as a process requiring continuous adaptation and coordination of plans and goals. This research provides a pathway for facilitating successful adoption of data warehouse. The model developed in this research allows data warehouse professionals to ensure that their project when implemented, achieve the strategic goals and business objectives of the organization...|$|R

40|$|On a daily basis, {{thousands}} of employees suffer from severe occupational accidents worldwide. These accidents not {{only lead to}} negative consequences for the {{physical and mental health}} of employees, but also to high costs for companies and the society as a whole. A large share of these accidents take place in warehouses. Prior research has demonstrated the critical role of leadership, and especially safety-specific transformational leadership (SSTL), in reducing warehouse accidents. Yet several important questions concerning SSTL remain: What effects does SSTL have on outcomes other than safety, and what determines whether leaders display SSTL behaviors? To answer these questions, this research studies the relationship between SSTL of <b>warehouse</b> <b>managers</b> and not only occupational accidents, but also quality and productivity. Moreover, it investigates the managers {{who are most likely to}} display SSTL. Data from 87 <b>warehouse</b> <b>managers</b> and 1233 employees were used to test the conceptual model. The results suggest that the dispositional prevention focus of the manager (one of two possible motivational strategies that people deploy) positively relates to SSTL, and that SSTL negatively relates to occupational accidents. Furthermore, SSTL and its identified negative relationship with occupational accidents does not appear to have detrimental impact on productivity or quality. These results extend existing models of SSTL and safety, and can help companies to reduce the number of accidents and the associated costs by selecting and developing safety-specific transformational leaders...|$|R

40|$|The {{warehousing}} {{industry is}} extremely important to businesses and {{the economy as a}} whole, and while {{there is a great deal}} of literature exploring individual operations within warehouses, such as warehouse layout and design, order picking, etc., there is very little literature exploring warehouse operations from a systems approach. This study uses the Theory of Constraints (TOC) to develop a focused resource management approach to increasing warehouse capacity and throughput, and thus overall warehouse performance, in an environment of limited warehouse resources. While TOC was originally developed for reducing operational bottlenecks in manufacturing, it has allowed companies in other industries, such as banking, health care, and the military, to save millions of dollars. However, the use of TOC has been limited to case studies and individual situations, which typically are not generalizable. Since the basic steps of TOC are iterative in nature and were not designed for survey research, modifications to the original theory are necessary in order to provide insight into industry-wide problems. This study further develops TOC 2 ̆ 7 s logistics paradigm and modifies it for use with survey data, which was collected from a sample of <b>warehouse</b> <b>managers.</b> Additionally, it provides a process for identifying potentially constrained key warehouse resources, which served as a foundation of this study. The findings of the study confirm that TOC 2 ̆ 7 s methods of focused resource capacity management and goods flow scheduling coordination with supply chain partners can be an important approach for <b>warehouse</b> <b>managers</b> to use in overcoming resource capacity constraints to increase warehouse performance...|$|R

Having cheap labor {{gives them an}} important competitive advantage. “If we cannot keep our overhead down, we cannot compete with them. Doing less with more is what we should do” (interviewee 9). Having customers who expect more (interviewees 5, 9) calls for customized services that require proper planning and strategy development. The business trend toward more customized demands, order consolidation and big fluctuation in demand are examples of factors influencing operations planning approaches. Several interviewees (4, 8, 9, 12, 15) raise the concern of slow movers, calling them {{one of the main}} cost drivers. Having said that, <b>warehouse</b> <b>managers</b> need an up-dated assortment of goods; “It is probably the easiest one to say {{but one of the most}} difficult ones to handle” (interviewee 4). As another aspect of modern business, e-commerce has been growing significantly during the past decade, and this trend will continue in the future. It is important to explore how this change can influence warehouses and their operations. In the words of interviewee 2, “instead of having major flows going to the bigger distributers, you actually need to start sending smaller parcels to customers. So, more and more, warehouses find that this is a different way of doing work; … and there will still be a flow to normal stores.” He continues, “Many <b>warehouse</b> <b>managers</b> may have thought about it but only a few have really adapted to this new way of distributing things”; the nature of material flow has changed and warehouses need to take the responsibility of sending goods to end customers in addition to shops and distribution centers.|$|R
