50|$|Existing <b>water</b> <b>twister</b> {{systems are}} fixed in their {{capacity}} to absorb energy. For AAG there is a variable energy dissipation by the <b>water</b> <b>twister.</b> There is an actual moving plate inside the <b>water</b> <b>twister</b> that adjusts how much resistance to the water is generated. Initially there was an underestimation of the forces involved inside the <b>water</b> <b>twister</b> {{because it is a}} three-dimensional flow field. Internal plates that take the force of the water weren't strong enough and finding a solution has taken some time.|$|E
50|$|Permanent and expeditionary {{land based}} systems usually consist of two arresting engines located {{on either side}} of the runway. The arresting engines apply braking force to reels holding the {{purchase}} tapes, which in turn slow the aircraft and bring it to a stop. The two most common methods used by land based arresting engines to apply the braking force are the rotary friction brake and the rotary hydraulic (<b>water</b> <b>twister)</b> systems. The rotary friction brake is simply a hydraulic pump coupled to the reel which applies a graduated pressure to multi-disc brakes mounted on the reel. The rotary hydraulic system is a turbine inside a water/glycol filled housing coupled to the reel. The turbulence generated in the water/glycol mixture by the turbine during the arrestment provides the resistance to slow the reel and stop the aircraft. Once the aircraft is released from the cable, the tapes and cable are retracted by an internal combustion engine or electric motor installed on the arresting engine.|$|E
50|$|To date, {{that site}} has {{executed}} more than 1,200 dead load arrestments. Testing {{has been delayed}} {{four and a half}} years due primarily to a serious problem with the <b>water</b> <b>twisters,</b> discovered early in 2012.|$|R
50|$|It {{will replace}} the MK 7 {{hydraulic}} arresting gear which is in use on the the ten Nimitz-class aircraft carriers. The AAG is designed for {{a broader range of}} aircraft, including UAVs, while reducing manpower and maintenance. Rotary engines which use simple energy-absorbing <b>water</b> turbines (or <b>twisters)</b> coupled to a large induction motor provide finer control of the arresting forces.|$|R
50|$|In July 2011, Six Flags {{introduced}} the Flash Pass at Six Flags White Water, {{and was the}} first water park in the world to feature the virtual queue system for their water rides. Six Flags White Water was the testing park of the new system and with huge success, nine more Six Flags water parks will be adding the system in 2012. For the 2013 season, White <b>Water</b> added Typhoon <b>Twister,</b> a five-story bowl slide.|$|R
5000|$|Carnival Breeze has {{the same}} design as her sisters, with a [...]4 mile {{exterior}} promenade, cantilevered whirlpools, and a 23750 sq ft wellness facility. Other features are the WaterWorks aqua park with a 300 ft-long corkscrew <b>water</b> slide called <b>Twister</b> and another called The Drainpipe, an indoor/outdoor caf√© with live entertainment venue called Ocean Plaza, {{and a range of}} staterooms including deluxe ocean views with two bathrooms, some of which have five berths. The ship's godmother is Tracy Wilson Mourning, a motivational speaker and founder of the Honey Shine girls' empowerment charity.|$|R
