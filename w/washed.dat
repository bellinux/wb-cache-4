5|$|As {{most of the}} livable land in West Virginia is in {{the flood}} plain, the high river {{flooding}} caused heavy damage, wrecking many small rural towns and washing out miles of roadways. A total of 43bridges were destroyed and another 80 were damaged. Near Moorefield, the bridge carrying U.S. Route 220 was closed, but was reopened after emergency repairs. In Paw Paw, a flooded river <b>washed</b> a swept up building into a bridge, washing it away. Much of Pendleton County became isolated after 18bridges were <b>washed</b> out and roads were covered by mudslides. The Cheat River destroyed 110 of the 132houses in Albright, and <b>washed</b> away a trailer park in Rowlesburg. The flooding downed thousands of trees, which were carried into houses and recreation areas to cause additional damage. Agriculture losses were heavy after the floods <b>washed</b> away the topsoil and left behind miles of debris. Many farm structures were <b>washed</b> away, {{and hundreds of thousands}} of chicken or turkeys were killed. Statewide, at least 8,968houses were damaged, and another 4,000 were destroyed, which left nearly 2,600people homeless. In addition, the floods damaged or destroyed 711businesses. Agriculture damage was estimated at $97million, and damage to the United States Forest Service in the state was estimated at $3.9million. Statewide damage totaled nearly $700million, and 38people were killed in West Virginia. This made it the most damaging flood in the state's history, according to then-Governor Arch A. Moore, Jr.|$|E

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{investigated the}} effect of contingent food deliveries on grooming movements in rats. The grooming sequence was divided into three topographically distinct behaviors: paw <b>washing,</b> face <b>washing,</b> and body <b>washing.</b> The first experiment found that rates of paw <b>washing</b> and body <b>washing</b> increased reliably under a food contingency, but face <b>washing</b> did not. A second experiment replicated these findings, and, in addition, showed that the average duration of paw <b>washing</b> and body <b>washing</b> decreased in length when followed by food. Placing a contingency on face <b>washing,</b> however, produced {{an increase in the}} rate of paw <b>washing</b> but no increase in face <b>washing.</b> It was concluded that, on the one hand, paw <b>washing</b> and body <b>washing</b> may be influenced by operant contingencies {{in the same way as}} behaviors such as lever pressing. On the other hand, increases in paw <b>washing</b> under the face <b>washing</b> contingency suggested that increases in the rate of grooming movements may occur by means other than operant relations...|$|R

Between Jiwani and Gwadar, Phet's rains <b>washed</b> away a bridge and damaged several portions of the Makran Coastal Highway, while also halting service for Pakistan Railways. Ten hours of rainfall in Gwadar flooded the port, damaging dozens of boats and launches. Throughout the town, Phet wrecked around 10,000houses. The storm flooded coastal neighborhoods, inundating the Pakistan Broadcasting Corporation building which temporarily lost its capability for FM broadcasting. For five days, the town and other coastal locations were without power or natural gas due to the storm. Elsewhere, the rains filled and <b>washed</b> away irrigation dams, and swept away fishing boats. Heavy rainfall also caused power outages in Hyderabad. Along the Sindh coast, the storm wrecked around 3,000houses made largely of straw. Residual storm flooding damaged around 180,000bags of wheat weighing millions of tons.|$|E

50|$|The Liquid Nitrogen <b>Wash</b> is {{especially}} favorable {{when combined with}} the Rectisol <b>Wash</b> Unit. The combination and advantageous interconnections between a Rectisol <b>Wash</b> Unit and a Liquid Nitrogen <b>Wash</b> lead to smaller equipment and better operability. The gas coming from the Rectisol <b>Wash</b> Unit {{can be sent to}} the Liquid Nitrogen <b>Wash</b> at low temperature (directly from the methanol absorber without being warmed up). Since part of the purified gas is reheated in the Rectisol <b>Wash</b> Unit, small fluctuations in flow and temperatures can easily be compensated leading to best operability. To improve the hydrogen recovery, an integrated hydrogen recycle from the Liquid Nitrogen <b>Wash</b> to the Rectisol <b>Wash</b> Unit can be installed, which uses the already existing recycle compressor of the Rectisol <b>Wash</b> Unit to recycle the hydrogen-rich flash gas from the Liquid Nitrogen <b>Wash</b> back into the feed gas of the Rectisol <b>Wash</b> Unit. This leads to extremely high hydrogen recovery rates without any further equipment.|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis was to compare the efficiency of counter-current and co-current filter cake <b>washing</b> techniques. Filter cake <b>washing</b> is a common unit operation which {{is used in the}} chemical process industry for improving the recovery of the liquid phase or for purifying the solid phase of the filter cake. Counter-current displacement <b>washing</b> is more difficult to arrange and it requires additional process equipment but the advantage of counter-current method is that the consumption of <b>wash</b> water that is required for achieving certain filter cake purity may be considerably decreased when compared to the co-current <b>washing</b> method. This is true especially for materials that are difficult to <b>wash.</b> The literature part of this thesis consists of a review of filter cake <b>washing</b> in general, including the basic principles of co-current and counter-current techniques, and a description of the structure and operation of a horizontal vacuum belt filter, which is the equipment considered in the experimental part of this thesis. Also the most common cake <b>washing</b> models are introduced. The experiments were performed by <b>washing</b> wheat apatite filter cakes in a laboratory scale vacuum filter by using both co-current and counter-current <b>washing</b> methods. The main results of these tests were the <b>washing</b> curves that relate the purity of the filter cake to the amount of <b>wash</b> liquid used. Comparison between the obtained <b>washing</b> curves showed that both <b>washing</b> methods could be efficiently applied for achieving good <b>washing</b> results. The differences between the <b>wash</b> liquid consumptions in the co-current and counter-current <b>washing</b> methods were found to be surprisingly small but this is most probably explained by the relatively good <b>washing</b> characteristics of the apatite cakes. The <b>washing</b> models introduced in the literature part were compared with the results obtained from the experiments and it was found out that the studied cake <b>washing</b> processes could be describe...|$|R
