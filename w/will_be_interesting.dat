25|$|Gap Junctions {{have been}} {{observed}} in various animal organs and tissues where cells contact each other. From the 1950s to 1970s they were detected in crayfish nerves, rat pancreas, liver, adrenal cortex, epididymis, duodenum, muscle, Daphnia hepatic caecum, Hydra muscle, monkey retina, rabbit cornea, fish blastoderm, frog embryos, rabbit ovary, re-aggregating cells, cockroach hemocyte capsules, rabbit skin, chick embryos, human islet of Langerhans, goldfish and hamster pressure sensing acoustico-vestibular receptors, lamprey and tunicate heart, rat seminiferous tubules, myometrium, eye lens and cephalopod digestive epithelium. Since the 1970s gap junctions have continued {{to be found in}} nearly all animal cells that touch each other. By the 1990s new technology such as confocal microscopy allowed more rapid survey of large areas of tissue. Since the 1970s even tissues that were traditionally considered to possibly have isolated cells such as bone showed that the cells were still connected with gap junctions, however tenuously. Gap junctions appear to be in all animal organs and tissues and it <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>interesting</b> to find exceptions to this other than cells not normally in contact with neighboring cells. Adult skeletal muscle is a possible exception. It may be argued that if present in skeletal muscle, gap junctions might propagate contractions in an arbitrary way among cells making up the muscle. At least in some cases {{this may not be the}} case as shown in other muscle types that do have gap junctions. An indication of what results from reduction or absence of gap junctions may be indicated by analysis of cancers or the aging process.|$|E

He added that, [...] "hile Bow Wow's more mature stance suits him well, it <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>interesting</b> {{to see how}} his younger fans and mainstream R radio react to the teenage MC's new image.

[...] He felt that Tom Quinn's exit was his favourite moment in the first two episodes, and that Adam is [...] "just [...] cold" [...] as Tom. He also praised the character development, stating [...] "character development is excellent in this season. Danny receives great moments as he is brought into the spotlight from his feelings for Zoe to his conflicted feelings about things he does in the name of Queen and Country, but Danny doesn't break and let his emotions become a crutch like Tom did (when Tom wanted a sleeper agent not to the job MI-5 wanted the sleeper to do)." [...] Blackwell concluded by saying [...] "sometime MI-5 fails as a show this season, but it still reaches levels of greatness.

500|$|Coffin's first {{jobs were}} to design small flower gardens {{such as the}} {{suburban}} garden she designed for Edward Sprague in 1906 in Flushing, Queens. Noted for its original design, it was situated on a modest lot measuring 150 feet by 300 feet (45 m by 91 m), typical of the new suburban developments being built on Long Island at the time. A few years later, she wrote about the Sprague garden in Country Life in America and Elsa Rehmann also discussed it in her 1918 book The Small Place: Its Landscape Architecture. Coffin argued that a [...] "moderately well-to-do" [...] homeowner could create and maintain a substantial and elaborate garden for a modest expenditure, {{comparable to that of}} a mid-range car. She promoted the idea that even the most featureless lot could be beautified through good design: [...] "We certainly cannot create a magnificent view, but we can plan and plant beautiful screens and backgrounds that <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>interesting</b> at all seasons of the year. We may not easily be able to construct a picturesque diversity at ground level, but we can plant so as to have much height and variety in our flower and shrub groups." ...|$|E

[...] The Guardian likewise gave it four stars out of five, stating, [...] "The game's most compelling aspect is its almost RPG-like popularity engine, which encourages you to see every slight kink in the road as a means to show off. If driving like a hooligan without having to face any consequences – in cars you'll never be able to afford – sounds appealing, then you'll love Forza Horizon.
