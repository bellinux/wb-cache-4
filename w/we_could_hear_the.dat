500|$|Strawberry Field was {{the name}} of a Salvation Army children's home just around the corner from Lennon's {{childhood}} home in Woolton, a suburb of Liverpool. Lennon and his childhood friends Pete Shotton, Nigel Walley and Ivan Vaughan used to play in the wooded garden behind the home. One of Lennon's childhood treats was the garden party held each summer in Calderstones Park, near the home, where a Salvation Army band played. Lennon's aunt Mimi Smith recalled: [...] "As soon as <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> Salvation Army band starting, John would jump up and down shouting, 'Mimi, come on. We're going to be late.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|.....sometimes without warning, a heavy {{thunderstorm}} high on {{the mountain}} changed it into a roaring, tearing monster. [...] At night, after a storm, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> giant rocks being pushed and crushed together by its force. [...] Trees, loosened by the flood, crashed into the water to be swept downstream.|$|E
2500|$|An American {{break-out}} {{was achieved}} with Operation Cobra and the encirclement of German {{forces in the}} Falaise pocket {{at the cost of}} British losses with the diversionary Operation Goodwood. On the early morning of 18 July 1944, Operation Goodwood began with British heavy bombers beginning carpet bombing attacks that further devastated what was left of Caen and the surrounding countryside. A British tank crewman from the Guards Armoured Division later recalled: [...] "At 0500 hours a distant thunder in the air brought all the sleepy-eyed tank crews out of their blankets. 1,000 Lancasters were flying from the sea in groups of three or four at [...] Ahead of them the pathfinders were scattering their flares and before long the first bombs were dropping". A German tankman from the 21st Panzer Division at the receiving end of this bombardment remembered: [...] "We saw little dots detach themselves from the planes, so many of them that the crazy thought occurred to us: are those leaflets?...Among the thunder of the explosions, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> wounded scream and the insane howling of men who had [...] driven mad". The British bombing had badly smashed the German front-line units; e.g. tanks were thrown up on the roofs of French farmhouses. Initially, the three British armoured divisions assigned to lead the offensive, the 7th, 11th and the Guards, made rapid progress and were soon approaching the Borguebus ridge, which dominated the landscape south of Caen by noon.|$|E
60|$|The roar increased, and <b>we</b> <b>could</b> {{distinctly}} <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> shouting.|$|R
6000|$|... 'What are you whining about?' Fred began, {{and then}} he broke off {{suddenly}} and listened. <b>We</b> <b>could</b> both <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> man's footsteps as he moved about.|$|R
60|$|We came foaming down {{abreast of}} the skiff, so close that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> above <b>the</b> wind the voices of Big Alec and his mate as they shouted at us with all the scorn that {{professional}} watermen feel for amateurs, especially when amateurs are making fools of themselves.|$|R
60|$|Hans hissed {{long and}} venomously. <b>We</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> great beast quaking in his cage.|$|E
60|$|And {{from afar}} <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> {{soldiers}} singing 'Two Lovely Black Eyes,' {{as they drove}} the remnant of the rioters within doors.|$|E
60|$|This {{illumination}} was {{but as the}} lightning's flash, {{and then}} <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> angry hum of the bullets as they swarmed above our heads.|$|E
6000|$|... "This won't do, lads," [...] said Jack, {{after a few}} minutes' breathless suspense, {{during which}} <b>the</b> only sound <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> was <b>the</b> beating of our own hearts; [...] "we have allowed the fire to get too low, and we've {{forgotten}} to adopt our friend the trader's advice, and make two fires." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know what}} {{the end of it}} was, but I rather fancy they were taken. The frigate {{followed}} them, gaining fast; and, later on, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> guns in <b>the</b> distance." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Aye, aye, sir!' {{said the}} mate, and putting his helm hard down the boom swung across, and the Maria darted {{off like a}} scared seabird into the fog. Looking back {{there was nothing but}} a dim loom to show where we had left <b>the</b> great vessel. <b>We</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear,</b> however, <b>the</b> hoarse {{shouting}} of orders and the bustle of men.|$|R
6000|$|And {{from afar}} <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> {{soldiers}} singing [...] "Two Lovely Black Eyes," [...] {{as they drove}} the remnant of the rioters within doors.|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> men {{working on}} the broken propellers, and from the {{port-hole}} we {{could see that the}} vessel was drifting lazily toward the south.|$|E
60|$|It {{was quite}} dark, and the lamps were lighted in the houses. <b>We</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> throb of the fan-house engines, {{and the soft}} whirr of the fan.|$|E
6000|$|Whenever {{we came to}} a {{full stop}} it was as if all nature ceased breathing, for <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> lightest whisper amid the foliage, and when the flight had {{continued}} in such fashion for an hour or more, Simon Kenton said as we stood side by side listening intently for some token of the villains: ...|$|R
60|$|Oh! now we knew, {{they were}} open also to another soul. <b>We</b> <b>could</b> see nothing save the Altar and <b>the</b> Effigy, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> only <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> slow chant {{of the priests}} and priestesses and the snake-like hiss of the rushing fires. Yet we knew that our hearts were as an open book to One who watched beneath the Mother's {{shadowing}} wings.|$|R
50|$|In 2008 {{except for}} the opening credits, no big changes were made on {{graphics}} and sounds. The 2008 edition had refreshed graphics: the fields with questions and answers were navy-blue and blue (earlier black) and smaller than in first edition of Milionerzy, and the field with won prize was blue (earlier brown and navy-blue). Also some sound effects and music <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> in <b>the</b> background when player answers a question, changed.|$|R
60|$|But in {{the evenings}} the place was quite deserted, and so lonely that at times we fancied that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> wolves howling in the forest of St. Pierre.|$|E
60|$|Yet, when we fetched up, {{through the}} {{darkness}} <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> seas breaking on the solid shore astern, and so near was it that we shortened the skiff's painter.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{saw them}} {{both within the}} minute. Would to God <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> shout of noisy Dudley, Madam Heathcote: his cry cheereth the heart, in a moment awful as this!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Does Dr. Watson live here?" [...] asked a clear {{but rather}} harsh voice. <b>We</b> <b>could</b> not <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> servant's reply, {{but the door}} closed, and some one began to ascend the stairs. The {{footfall}} was an uncertain and shuffling one. A look of surprise passed over the face of my companion as he listened to it. It came slowly along the passage, {{and there was a}} feeble tap at the door.|$|R
60|$|Once on {{the floor}} above I halted to whisper in Archie's ear that {{which was to be}} done in case Hiram {{returned}} before these unwelcome visitors had departed, and meanwhile <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> voices on <b>the</b> outside, as if those who awaited the opening of the door were discussing among themselves the cause of Master Lord's delay in giving them entrance.|$|R
6000|$|... "After that we {{said very}} little. We sat at {{opposite}} sides of the fire, waiting for him, and you played on the floor. The harvesters trooped by, and there was a fiddle; and when it stopped, long stillness, and then a step. It was not Adam. You fell asleep, and <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> nothing but <b>the</b> sea. There was a harvest moon.|$|R
60|$|I was silent, {{and then}} we both started apart. Behind us <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> sound of {{footsteps}} rapidly approaching, soft quick footsteps, muffled and almost noiseless upon the spongy turf. We stood still.|$|E
60|$|Between us and {{the mouth}} of the gulley rose, or rather sank, a sheer precipice that was {{apparently}} three or four hundred feet in depth, and at its foot <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> sound of water.|$|E
60|$|For a while, as we ascended, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> dog barking furiously, then, presently, just as {{we reached}} the upper landing, we heard a loud curse, a scramble, and then a piteous whine quickly smothered.|$|E
60|$|And yet {{had it been}} daylight, they are, it seems, such exact marksmen, that if {{they could}} have seen but the least part of any of us, they would have been sure of us. We had, {{by the light of the}} moon, a little sight of them as they stood pelting us from the shore with darts and arrows, and having got ready our fire-arms, we gave them a volley, and <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> by <b>the</b> cries of some of them, that we had wounded several; however, they stood thus in battle array on the shore till break of day, which we suppose was that they might see the better to take their aim at us.|$|R
6000|$|He {{also had}} the very young man's craving to be criticised, and we made it our custom to oblige each other. We did not know then that what we meant, when we asked for [...] "criticism," [...] was encouragement. We thought that we were strong--one does at the {{beginning}} of the battle, and that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> bear to <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> truth.|$|R
60|$|Clang, clang, clang, {{we passed}} {{right under the}} thumping levers of another vast machine, and so came at last to a wide tunnel, in which <b>we</b> <b>could</b> even <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> pad, pad, of our shoeless feet, and which, save for the {{trickling}} thread of blue {{to the right of}} us, was quite unlit. The shadows made gigantic travesties of our shapes and those of the Selenites on the irregular wall and roof of the tunnel. Ever and again crystals in the walls of the tunnel scintillated like gems, ever and again the tunnel expanded into a stalactitic cavern, or gave off branches that vanished into darkness.|$|R
60|$|It {{was one of}} {{the wildest}} and roughest nights of the year. Both the carriage-windows were {{streaming}} with raindrops, and <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> wind howling across the open country, and whistling mournfully among the leafless trees.|$|E
6000|$|Night {{closed in}} swiftly. Through the dark <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> low swish {{of the rising}} river, and Burton, with a sly twinkle in his eye, remarked, [...] "For a {{semi-arid}} country, {{this is a pretty}} wet rain." ...|$|E
60|$|From without we saw {{hundreds}} of guardsmen {{pouring into the}} courtyard, and along the lower corridor from which I had found {{my way to the}} armory <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> clank of metal and the shouting of men.|$|E
60|$|We crawled {{from the}} tent, but as yet could see nothing, whilst the yak began to low in a terrified manner. But if <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not see <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> and feel. <b>The</b> booming and {{cracking}} had ceased, and {{was followed by}} a soft, grinding noise, the most sickening sound, I think, to which I ever listened. This was accompanied by a strange, steady, unnatural wind, which seemed to press upon us as water presses. Then the dawn broke and we saw.|$|R
60|$|Ada and I conversed {{with these}} young ladies {{and found them}} wonderfully like their father. In the {{meanwhile}} Mr. Jarndyce (who had been rubbing his head to a great extent, and hinted at {{a change in the}} wind) talked with Mrs. Skimpole in a corner, where <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not help <b>hearing</b> <b>the</b> chink of money. Mr. Skimpole had previously volunteered to go home with us and had withdrawn to dress himself for the purpose.|$|R
60|$|The sudden roar of an {{explosion}} split the air. The floor seemed to heave under our feet, and the windows fell in with a crash, letting in the cold night air. <b>We</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> distinctly now <b>the</b> shrieks and groans from below. It {{seemed to me that}} the roadway was suddenly strewn with the bodies of prostrate men. I sprang back into the room, we all looked at one another in horror. I think that for my part I expected to see the walls close in upon us.|$|R
