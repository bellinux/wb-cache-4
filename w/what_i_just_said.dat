6000|$|His friend, at the fire, {{watched a}} moment the empty portion of the other room, then walked across to give the door a light push that all but closed it. [...] "It's rather odd," [...] he remarked as he came back--"that's quite <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>said</b> to him. But he won't treat her to comedy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Both my unhorsing, sir, and my rescue, {{were the}} result of <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>said,</b> our habit of keeping an eye on our neighbours. A Welshman was on the point of attacking Captain Alwyn, when he was engaged with two others in front. I struck the man down but, as I did so, a Welshman sprang on to my horse, behind, and pinned my arms to my side; while four others rushed at me." ...|$|E
6000|$|Then do {{they not}} see that when the Welsh {{mountains}} were ground down, the Silurian strata, being uppermost, would be ground down first, and would go to make the lower strata of the great New Red Sandstone Lowland; and that being sandy, they would make the sandstones? But wherever they were ground through, the Lower Cambrian slates would be laid bare; and their remains, being washed away by the sea the last, would be washed on {{to the top of}} the remains of the Silurians; and so (as in most cases) the remains of the older rock, when redeposited by water, would lie on the remains of the younger rock. And {{do they not}} see that (if <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>said</b> is true) these slates would grind up into red marl, such as is seen over the west and south of Cheshire and Staffordshire and far away into Nottinghamshire? The red marl must almost certainly have been black slate somewhere, somewhen. Why should it not have been such in Snowdon? And why should not the slates in the roof be the remnants of the very beds which are now the marl in the fields? ...|$|E

60|$|When the {{darkness}} had come again, I bade him good night--first mechanically repeating <b>what</b> <b>I</b> had <b>just</b> <b>said,</b> almost {{in the same}} words.|$|R
6000|$|... "Will {{you tell}} me what there is in the letter?" [...] he asked--passing, as you see, entirely over <b>what</b> <b>I</b> had <b>just</b> <b>said</b> to him.|$|R
5000|$|... "I don't fit in anywhere, man. I really don't. I don't {{agree with}} {{anything}} either, not even <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>said,</b> so I think {{you see the}} fucking problem here." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "You have {{a better}} chance of {{stopping}} a serial killer than a serial thief in comedy," [...] said comedian David Brenner. [...] "If we could protect our jokes, I'd be a retired billionaire in Europe somewhere - and <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>said</b> is original." ...|$|E
50|$|It {{is written}} {{from the point}} of view of a man who has passed on, and hes sort of looking down wishing that he had been a {{different}} person, and having a lot of regrets and wishing he hadnt had the negative effect on the people in his life and err... I dont know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>said...</b>|$|E
60|$|If I am {{called upon}} to reword <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have <b>just</b> <b>said,</b> <b>I</b> shall repeat my words, and show strong grounds and reasons to {{indicate}} that he governs Oude now {{as much as he}} ever did.|$|R
6000|$|My {{young lady}} {{continued}} {{to look at me}} in confusion and mistrust, and the result of her reflexion on <b>what</b> <b>I</b> had <b>just</b> <b>said</b> was to make her suddenly break out: “Look here, sir—what’s the matter with him?” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Miss Carmina {{is no more}} {{my niece}} than she is your niece. Carry your mind back to <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have <b>just</b> <b>said.</b> <b>I</b> {{mentioned}} a medical student who was an irresistible man. Miss Carmina's father was that man." ...|$|R
5000|$|As Colbert himself {{explains}} it: I'm {{speaking a}} completely self-sufficient, standalone essay, hopefully comedic... The bullet points excerpt parts of what I said, or comment on <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>said.</b> And the bullet points {{end up being}} their own character. Sometimes they're reinforcing my argument, sometimes they're countermanding my argument. It's a textual addition of jokes or satire to the verbal essay I'm doing at the moment.|$|E
3000|$|Emmy: “I’ll spit {{something}} {{out and the}} teacher is like, ‘I don’t understand. Can you restate that?’ I’ll have {{to sit there and}} figure out how to reword <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>said</b> without sounding like an idiot.” [...]...|$|E
40|$|In its General Theory, Keynes wrote “The {{importance}} of money flows from {{it being a}} link between the present and the future. ” (L’importance de la monnaie vient du fait qu’elle est un lien entre le present et le futur). Paraphrasing Keynes, I would say, the {{importance of}} historical studies of money and monetary policies flows from it being {{a link between the}} past and the future. The subject sounds complex and it is. Yet, policy mistakes in the field of money and exchange rates, especially between the two world wars, had consequences that went far beyond anything one could imagine in terms of destructions of the economies and even the mankind itself. Studying the history of money in depth is therefore not only a matter of knowledge but also an indispensable tool to understand {{what is going on in}} the present and avoid the future mistakes and their uncontrollable consequences. Four years ago, <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>said</b> might have sound out of touch to some ears. No more. The deep financial crisis we have been experiencing in the developed countries of the west refreshed the memories of those who thought that with the Great Moderation (a prolonged period of low inflation and growth nearing its potential level) monetary history had stopped. Studying the history of money and drawing the lessons from the past for the present and the future...|$|E
60|$|It {{would have}} been useless and cruel to have said to him <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have <b>just</b> <b>said</b> here. <b>I</b> put as bright a face on it as I could, {{and asked if he}} {{proposed}} to follow Mr. Sebright's advice.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear Cristel, <b>I</b> know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> owe to {{your kind}} {{interest}} in me on that occasion!" [...] Before I could say a word of apology for having wronged her by my suspicions, she insisted on an explanation of <b>what</b> <b>I</b> had <b>just</b> <b>said.</b>|$|R
60|$|Is {{all this}} sentiment? Remember <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>just</b> now: by well-used sentiment, and well-used sorrow, great nations live.|$|R
6000|$|... "Did {{you hear}} <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>just</b> now?" [...] asked Midwinter, incredulously. [...] "You can't--surely, you can't have been {{attending}} to me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are very}} good to me, Ned. Forgive me <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>just</b> now. And <b>I</b> think I {{understand}} about Terence--poor dear old Terence." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Exactly <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>just</b> now," [...] Hunterleys rejoined. [...] "If {{you are in}} earnest, and I have {{no doubt}} that you are, I should clear out." ...|$|R
5000|$|He {{must have}} {{acquired}} a certain notoriety since in 1636 Marin Mersenne included a fugue {{of him in}} his Harmonie universelle and praised {{the quality of his}} compositions: [...] "The notes which follow show more clearly <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have <b>just</b> <b>said,</b> and contain a fugue composed by Sieur Coffin, {{one of the oldest and}} best disciples of Du Caurroy.|$|R
6000|$|I {{tried to}} speak to him of Euneece, and to tell him <b>what</b> <b>I</b> had already related to yourself. He was in no humor to listen to me. [...] "Keep it for a fitter time," [...] he answered; [...] "and think of <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have <b>just</b> <b>said</b> to you." [...] With that, he left me, on his way to Philip's room.|$|R
60|$|Let {{it not be}} supposed, from <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have <b>just</b> <b>said,</b> that <b>I</b> am {{detailing}} any mystery, or penning any romance. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> {{have described}} in the Frenchman, was merely {{the result of an}} excited, or perhaps of a diseased intelligence. But of the character of his remarks at the periods in question an example will best convey the idea.|$|R
6000|$|... "Your {{assurance}} is {{more than}} kind, M. de Belle-Isle," [...] he said with perfect courtesy, [...] "but I can only repeat <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>just</b> now, that <b>I</b> will not fight M. de Stainville." ...|$|R
60|$|Those Circensian games, {{and indeed}} all the public spectacles, are fresh proofs of <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>just</b> now; {{that if a}} bad people earn bad {{government}}, still a bad government makes a bad people.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{are right}} there; I wonder the idea {{did not occur}} to me. Well, <b>I</b> retract <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>just</b> now; so far you have told me nothing to justify the epithet you {{bestowed}} on yourself.' ...|$|R
5000|$|... (GN 2) In Matthew 3, it reads: [...] "Behold, {{the mother}} of the Lord and his brethren said to him, 'John the Baptist is baptizing unto the {{remission}} of sins; let us go and be baptized by him.' But He said to them, 'Wherein have I sinned that I should go and be baptized by him? Unless <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have <b>just</b> <b>said</b> is (a sin of?) ignorance.'"(Jerome, Against Pelagius 3.2") ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You shall {{marry the}} Princess {{because you have}} been able to break the enchantment, but I will have my revenge. You shall have a son, who will never be happy until he finds out that his nose is too long, and if you ever tell anyone <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have <b>just</b> <b>said</b> to you, you shall vanish away instantly, and no one shall ever see you or hear of you again." ...|$|R
6000|$|It was so prettily and innocently {{said that}} even the governess was touched--for a moment. [...] "Shall I prove to you that I am your friend?" [...] she proposed. [...] "I advise you not to go back yet to your aunt--and I will tell you why. Mrs. Gallilee bears malice; she is a {{thoroughly}} unforgiving woman. And I {{should be the first}} to feel it, if she knew <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have <b>just</b> <b>said</b> to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course I do!" [...] Out it came {{in those}} words, before I could stop it. Was there {{something}} unbecoming to a young lady in saying <b>what</b> <b>I</b> had <b>just</b> <b>said?</b> Mrs. Staveley {{seemed to be more}} amused than angry with me. She took my arm kindly, and led me along with her. [...] "My dear, you are as clear as crystal, and as true as steel. You are a favorite of mine already." ...|$|R
6000|$|He guided Thekla's happy little {{fingers to}} the {{fastening}} of the belt, and then, laying his hand on hers, said gravely, [...] "Thekla, never speak of <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>just</b> now--not even to the mother. Remember, it is thy husband's first secret." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't," [...] {{repeated}} Abner. [...] "It's {{nothing to}} me. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> said about myself is different, for {{it might make}} some difference to you. But nothing you could say of yourself would make any change in me. <b>I</b> stick to <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>just</b> now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I did {{not mean}} exactly that by <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>just</b> now. <b>I</b> generalized. But since you ask me, I may tell you that such help {{has been given to}} revolutionary activities, more or less consciously, in various countries. And even in this country." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Seth, lad," [...] said Adam, {{taking no}} {{notice of the}} sarcasm against himself, [...] "thee mustna take me unkind. I wasna driving at thee in <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>just</b> now. Some 's got one way o' looking at things and some 's got another." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I find a shade over my eyes {{keeps them}} too hot {{at this time}} of the year," [...] rejoined Magdalen, {{steadily}} matching the housekeeper's composure. [...] "May I ask whether you heard <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>just</b> now on the subject of my errand in this house?" ...|$|R
