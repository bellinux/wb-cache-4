40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the veracity of}} two important, yet untested, premises underlying the interpretation of hierarchical variation in <b>workpaper</b> review performance. Prior research has argued that auditors at different hierarchical levels structure their knowledge of <b>workpaper</b> errors differently, and that these differences in knowledge structure give rise to hierarchical variation {{in the ability of}} auditors to identify mechanical and conceptual <b>workpaper</b> errors. This study directly examines the way in which audit firm managers, seniors and staff auditors structure their knowledge of audit <b>workpaper</b> errors and finds variation across hierarchical levels. These differences in knowledge structure were found to be associated with variation in <b>workpaper</b> review performance as they related to the identification of conceptual errors, but not, as proposed in prior research, mechanical <b>workpaper</b> errors. These results guide future research efforts aimed at improving <b>workpaper</b> review performance. Copyright (c) 2010 The Author. Accounting and Finance (c) 2010 AFAANZ. ...|$|R

Since SAS 94 requires auditors to consider an auditee’s use of IT controls during audit planning, this study seems highly relevant. Using archived audit <b>workpaper</b> documentation, our results show that IT control strength assessments are inversely associated with control risk assessments, audit hours, and fees. Results also show that both the control risk and IT control strength assessments have similar influence on hours and fees...|$|R

40|$|There is {{widespread}} {{recognition in the}} accounting literature that properly directed audit effort is critical to an effective and efficient engagement. Auditors assess the risks of managerial misstatements and use these risks to plan audit procedures. Prior studies examining the linkage between assessed risk and audit effort report weak and conflicting results. The unobservable nature of the audit process necessitates the use of proxies to capture assessed risks and audit effort. This study utilizes proprietary audit <b>workpaper</b> data to obtain better measurement of assessed risks and effort. These improved measurements provide stronger evidence on whether changes in assessed risks will affect the nature, timing, and extent of audit testing. This linkage is examined first using OLS and then an instrumental variables approach to address potential simultaneity in determining the nature, timing, and extent of substantive effort. In contrast to prior research, results suggest that auditors vary the nature, timing, and extent of substantive effort in response to assessed auditee risks...|$|R

40|$|Structured as an essay, this <b>workpaper</b> aims {{to present}} sui generis {{one point of}} view on the {{relationship}} between two models of the social-human typology in the context of globalization: homo oeconomicus and homo academicus. Being only a starting point for futher research into a tripartite structure, the paper preliminary presents views on views of MAN’s multivalent positions between vocation and the adaptation to globalization flows, the dilemmas and paradoxes between the oeconomicus and academicus models which I consider inherent into a higher education’s biography in a globalized world. Developed from hypothesis to conclusion, the assertion that homo academicus is deeply involved in mundus academicus, while homo oeconomicus stimulates in a global manner the whole mundus academicus, generates various approaches in which the economic and the academic either mingle or dissociate, but the conjunction or disjunction cases unavoidably lead to outlining the postulate that no architecture on a world academic map is built without „Development through Innovation and Innovation through Education” and that leads to an absolutely justified interrogation in the globalized present: Will homo academicus be able to adapt to the values of homo oeconomicus, sell its know-how and produce conveniently?...|$|R

It shows the violent beginning of the first episode of blizzard (9 - 12 th of December 2012), which came after {{the first decade of}} a gentle December. It had consequences for the transport of Botoșani county (shuting down the traffic routes in the East and North of the county and in a proportion of 75 percent {{in the rest of the}} county) and also it affected the central and East part of Suceava county. Apart from transports, these episodes of blizzard leaded to blocking in case of old persons, deprived of power, and because of the traffic routes, lack medical crews to give them first aid, closing the schools, shops (lack of input raw materials supply) etc. What is desirable to point out more in this article, apart from the risks mentioned earlier, it is the synoptic context, who favored the production of these two episodes of blizzard, amount of precipitation fallen on the average and maximum speed of the wind, temperature, maximum and minimum felt of the human body (cooling index) and the climatic risks resulted...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} aims to show an {{analysis}} of relationship between gross fixed capital formation and economic growth in Romania, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary for the period 2003 - 2009. For this, the statistical connection analysis method is applied. The used variables are: the economic growth (gross domestic product - GDP) – considered dependent variable and the gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) – considered independent variable. This <b>workpaper</b> uses the quarterly of GDP and GFCF, considering the period from {{the last quarter of}} 2003 until the last quarter of 2009. That analysis indicates the relation between those two indicators separately for each country in order to draw a conclusion regarding the role of GFCF to the growth and development of the Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) countries and as well as its contribution to the formation of GDP. Using this data, we apply the correlation analysis to verify the existence of the connection between two macroeconomic indicators. The obtained results show a direct and strong connection between economic growth and gross fixed capital formation, relation which is expressed by correlation coefficient with a level very close to the value of 1 for Romania, Bulgaria, Czech Republic and Poland. The conclusion is that the level of the between gross fixed capital formation may influence in the positive way the economic growth, in Romania, Bulgaria, Czech Republic and Poland. ...|$|R
40|$|An {{inherent}} {{aspect of}} an audit {{is the level}} of task complexity that junior auditors (staff and senior level associates) endure on a daily basis. This complexity directly impacts an auditor’s ability to form an appropriate problem representation, which in turn impacts judgment performance. One of the key components of this process is having sufficient knowledge for purposes of problem representation; without it, the auditor’s problem representation and ultimately judgment performance are negatively impacted. Conversely, audit teams can positively influence the conciseness of problem representation and performance by way of effective task-specific knowledge transfer. Knowledge transfer in the audit field occurs during three distinct phases: when an auditor reviews prior and/or current year workpapers; when an auditor requests help; and/or during the <b>workpaper</b> review process. For purposes of efficiency and increasing (i. e. improving) problem representation, prior to any deleterious effects, it’s critical that the audit profession understand how to maximize the knowledge transfer as soon as possible after the auditor’s initial assignment of the task. Because auditors commonly will immediately refer to audit programs in the current year documentation in the electronic audit file to gain an understanding of the task, maximizing the knowledge transfer within the electronic audit file is critical to increasing auditor judgment performance. I propose utilizing media richness theory to establish an increased media rich transfer of knowledge via the electronic audit file from the audit managers (expert) to junior auditors (novice). Procedure screens within the electronic audit file would likely be categorized as “written, formal” mediums within the media richness theory, because the source of information is impersonal. However, if audit firms can successfully transform the transfer of information within the audit files from being solely formal document screens to also incorporate personal source characteristics, they will successfully increase the information richness, which will allow for a more successful transfer of knowledge and subsequently the ability for the auditor to more effectively form a problem representation...|$|R

40|$|Chitin is an {{important}} reinforcing component in load-bearing structures in many organisms such as insects and crustaceans (i. e. shrimps, lobsters, crabs etc.). It is of increasing interest for use in packaging materials {{as well as in}} biomedical applications. Furthermore, biological materials may inspire the development of new man-made material concepts. Chitinmolecules are crystallized in extended chain conformations to form nanoscale fibrils of about 3 nm in diameter. In the present study, novel materialshave been developed based on a new type of chitin nanofibers prepared from the lobster exoskeleton. Improved understanding about effects of chitin from crustaceans and chitin material preparation on structure is provided through Atomic Force Microscopy(AFM) (paper I&II), Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy(STEM) (paper I&II), X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Intrinsic Viscosity, solid state 13 C Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) (paper II), Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy(FE-SEM) (paper I, II, III, IV & V), Ultraviolet-Visible Spectrophotometryand Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) (paper III). The presence of protein was confirmed through colorimetric method(paper I & II). An interesting result from the thesis is the new features of chitin nanofiber including small diameter, high molar mass or nanofiber length,and high purity. The structure and composition of the nanofibers confirms this (paper I & II). Furthermore, the structure and properties of the corresponding materials confirm the uniqueness of the present nanofibers: chitin membrane (I & II), polymer matrix composites (III),and hydrogels (paper IV). Improved mechanical properties compared with typical data from the literature were confirmed for chitin nanofiber membranes in paper II, chitin-chitosan polymer matrix composites in paper III, and chitin hydrogel in paper IV. Mechanical tests included dynamic mechanical analysis and uniaxial tensile tests. Mechanical properties of chitin hydrogels were evaluated based onrheological and compression properties (paper IV). The values were the highest reported for this kind of chitin material. Furthermore, the relationships between materials structure and properties were analyzed. For membranes and polymer matrix nanocomposites, the degree of dispersion is {{an important}} parameter. For the hydrogels, the preparation procedure is very simple and has interesting practical potential. Chitin-binding characteristics of cuticular proteins areinteresting fornovel bio-inspired material development. In the present <b>work(paper</b> V), chitin nanofibers with newfeaturesincluding high surface area and low protein content were combined with resilin-like protein possessing the chitin-binding characteristics. Hydrated chitin-resilin nanocomposites with similar composition as in rubber-like insect cuticles were prepared. The main objective was to improve understanding on the role of chitin-binding domain on mechanical properties. Resilin is a rubber-like protein present in insects. The exon I (comprising 18 N-terminal elastic repeat units) together with or without the exon II (a typical cuticular chitin-binding domain) from the resilin gene CG 15920 found in Drosophila melanogasterwere cloned and the encoded proteins were expressed as soluble products in Escherichia coli. Resilin-like protein with chitin-binding domain (designated as ResChBD) adsorbedin significant amount to chitin nanofiber surface andprotein-bound cuticle-like soft nanocomposites were formed. Although chitin bindingwas taking place only in proteinswith chitin-binding domain, the global mechanical behavior of the hydrated chitin-resilin nanocomposites was not so sensitive to this chitin-resilin interaction. In summary, chitin is an interesting material component with high potential as mechanical reinforcement in a variety of nanomaterials. The present study reports the genesisof novel chitin nanofibers and outlines the basic relationships between structure and properties for materials based on chitin. Future work should be directed towards both bio-inspired studies of the nanocomposite chitin structures in organisms, as well as the industrial applications of chitin waste from the food industry. Chitin nanofibers can strengthen the properties of materials, andprovide optical transparency as well as biological activities such as antimicrobial properties. QC 20141110 </p...|$|R
