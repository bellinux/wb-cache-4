500|$|A keen cyclist, in 2009 Everest {{collaborated with}} cyclewear brand Rapha {{to develop a}} bespoke suit that could be worn while cycling; what he called [...] "bespoke active wear". Priced at £3,500, the three-piece suit was made of blended wool, using {{nanotechnology}} to repel water and dirt. It combined the functionality of classic cycling clothing with the elegance of bespoke tailoring. Its features included a high button fastening to keep the jacket closely fitted to the body, a lapel pocket for an MP3 player and pleats at the shoulders and center back to allow extra fabric when the rider <b>was</b> <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> the bicycle. The jacket design was incorporated into Rapha's ready-to-wear collection in 2010. In collaboration with bicycle saddle manufacturer Brooks England during 2010, he developed a cycling jacket; under Brooks' John Boultbee clothing label. The resulting 'Criterion Mk.1 cycling jacket', which used water and sweat-resistant materials, was shown at the Bread and Butter street and urban fashion fair, Berlin, in January 2011.|$|E
2500|$|Macoun was {{involved}} in a controversial play early in the 1991–92 season. [...] Attempting to defend against Pat LaFontaine of the Buffalo Sabres, Macoun slashed at his opponent, however since LaFontaine <b>was</b> <b>bent</b> <b>over,</b> Macoun's stick hit him in the face. [...] LaFontaine suffered a broken jaw and lost several teeth, however Macoun was not suspended for the incident as the league ruled there had been no intent to injure. [...] The Sabres were outraged by the decision.|$|E

5000|$|Running ropes (stranded ropes) <b>are</b> <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> sheaves and drums. They are {{therefore}} stressed mainly by bending and secondly by tension.|$|R
50|$|If {{a player}} <b>is</b> <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> or on his knees, usually to win or protect the football, and an {{opponent}} knocks him over from behind.|$|R
60|$|He rowed away. Presently the old judge {{came out}} of his faint and looked up piteously into the {{sympathetic}} face that <b>was</b> <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> him.|$|E
60|$|She {{pressed the}} little hand that she held between hers, {{and looked up}} into the face that <b>was</b> <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> hers. Lucy never forgot that look.|$|E
60|$|He {{knew it was}} {{a tornado}} even before it hit him. Everything was silent. He <b>was</b> <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> his whetstone, the reins between his knees, absorbed in his work.|$|E
60|$|The board {{immediately}} began to write. By this time all heads, {{with the exception of}} Mr. Barton's, <b>were</b> <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> the table and following the pencil.|$|R
5000|$|A pancake spin is a {{difficulty}} variation on a sit spin {{in which the}} free leg is canted towards the body and upper body <b>is</b> <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> it, forming the illusion of the skater's body as a pancake.|$|R
6000|$|Not only Parker's {{head but}} the others <b>were</b> <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> the counter. Dr. Duchesne uttered a few words in a tone inaudible {{to the rest of}} the company. There was a {{profound}} silence, broken at last by Abe Wynford's voice:-- ...|$|R
60|$|But Thomas Cole wasn't listening. He <b>was</b> <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> the schematics, {{an intense}} frown on his {{weathered}} face. His long fingers moved restlessly over the schematics, tracing wiring and terminals. His lips moved as he calculated.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked up}} quickly. Something {{in the pale}} face which <b>was</b> <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> her told that now, if ever, was {{the time for a}} woman to forget herself, and to cheer, to inspire those around her.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, what do {{you think}} of it? What would you do in my place--eh, Philip! What can he want of it, eh?' said Mr. Edmonstone, tormenting his riding-whip, and looking up to study his nephew's face, which, with stern gravity in every feature, <b>was</b> <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> the letter, as if to weigh every line. 'Eh, Philip?' {{repeated}} Mr. Edmonstone, several times, without obtaining an answer.|$|E
5000|$|... "You guys <b>are</b> getting <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> and they're {{not using}} Vaseline." ...|$|R
50|$|To {{the left}} of the booth, there is a screen in front of which sit actors in chairs; the one {{directly}} in front of the screen <b>is</b> <b>bent</b> <b>over,</b> studiously following his script, while others are slightly to {{the left of}} him.|$|R
60|$|There was a rush, a shout; all faces <b>were</b> <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> the precipice. The girl hung by her chained wrist: {{the officer}} was gone. There was a moment's awful silence; and then Amyas heard his body {{crashing}} through the tree-tops far below.|$|R
60|$|Her head <b>was</b> <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> her plate. She {{seemed to}} be {{listening}} to the music--or was there something there which she did not wish me to see? I could not tell. The waiter intervened with another course. When she spoke to me again, her tone was almost cold, but it troubled me very little. There was a softness in her eyes which she could not hide.|$|E
60|$|Even in its position, {{as well as}} in {{the objects}} of which it was composed, the pile wore an ominous and startling aspect; its crooked outline, {{expanding}} towards the top, <b>was</b> <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> fearfully in the direction of the doorway; it seemed as if a single hand might sway it in its uncertain balance, and hurl it instantly in one solid mass to the floor.|$|E
60|$|We turned, and {{at first}} saw nothing save the great curtain of fire that rose from the abyss of the volcano, whereof, as I have told, the crest <b>was</b> <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> by the wind like {{the crest of a}} {{breaking}} billow. But presently, as we watched, in the depths of this red veil, Nature's awful lamp-flame, a picture began to form as it forms in the seer's magic crystal.|$|E
50|$|More than 600 postholes {{were found}} in the excavations. Their {{arrangement}} indicated that small circular structures were built using saplings as uprights. It was assumed that the tops of the poles <b>were</b> <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> to meet in the middle, and covered with palm leaf thatching.|$|R
2500|$|One figure {{depicts a}} man {{lying on the}} ground, emaciated; another shows a {{pregnant}} woman clutching her bulging stomach, while behind her a meek child stands wide-eyed. One frail figure <b>is</b> <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> with hands clasped in prayer, contrasted by a man whose arms are extended to the sky in salvation." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 11. 3-5. Whose fame Over {{his living}} head like heaven <b>is</b> <b>bent,</b> An early but {{enduring}} monument. These phrases {{are not very}} definite. When fame is spoken of as being <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> Byron's head, we must conceive of fame as taking a form cognizable by the senses. I think Shelley means to assimilate it to the rainbow; saying substantially--Fame is like an arc <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> Byron's head, as the arc of the rainbow <b>is</b> <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> the expanse of heaven. The ensuing term 'monument' applies rather to fame in the abstract than to any image of fame as an arc.|$|R
60|$|As {{the beam}} of {{moonlight}} widened, the figures of the toiling men grew clear. One was clinging {{to the top of}} a tall stanchion in a grotesque monkey-like attitude, trying to cut loose the awning, for a knife sparkled in his hand. Another crouched on the deck with folds of the canvas in his arms. Miguel <b>was</b> <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> the wheel. The tenseness of his pose and his hard-set face suggested heavy muscular strain.|$|E
60|$|There he sat, a huge figure, {{clad in a}} great wolfskin. Besides him lay a great club. Across {{his knee}} was a spear round which he was binding sinews that {{tightened}} under his muscular hand. His head <b>was</b> <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> his task. His matted hair had fallen over his eyes. He did not see me till I was close {{beside him on the}} sanded floor of the cave. I gave a slight cough.|$|E
6000|$|The Easy Chair {{no longer}} interrupted, and the unreal editor, having made his point, went on after {{the manner of}} preachers, when they are also editors, to make it over again, and to repeat himself pitilessly, unsparingly. He did not observe that the Easy Chair had shrunk forward until all its leathern seat was {{wrinkled}} and its carven top <b>was</b> <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> its old red back. When he stopped at last, the warehouse agent asked in whisper, ...|$|E

50|$|Only if the {{recipient}} {{was a small}} child could he or she practicably be punished over the knee of the applicant. Otherwise the child would <b>be</b> <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> an object such as a chair.

50|$|To avoid snags and pulls, {{remove any}} jewelry that may {{catch in the}} fabric’s weave, and wear {{clothing}} free of large buckles or other objects which may snag the textile.

60|$|She went forward, {{and thrust}} {{her hand into}} his {{breeches}} pocket. He smoked steadily, making no resistance, talking to his nephew. Her hand groped about in his pocket, and then drew out his leathern purse. Her colour was bright in her clear cheeks, her eyes shone. Brangwen's eyes were twinkling. The nephew sat sheepishly. Anna, in her finery, sat down and slid all the money into her lap. There was silver and gold. The youth could not help watching her. She <b>was</b> <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> the heap of money, fingering the different coins.|$|E
6000|$|An elderly lady in widow's {{black was}} {{kneeling}} beside a man groaning in mortal agony, fanning away the flies already gathering about his face. He wore {{the uniform of}} a Union sergeant,--dusty and splotched and torn. A small Testament was clasped convulsively in {{the fingers of his}} right band. The left sleeve was empty. Virginia lingered, whelmed in pity, thrilled by a wonderful womanliness of her who knelt there. Her face the girl had not even seen, for it <b>was</b> <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> the man. The sweetness of her voice held Virginia as in a spell, and the sergeant stopped groaning that he might listen: ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{read these}} words {{over and over}} again: I felt that an {{explanation}} belonged to them, and was unable fully to penetrate their import. I was still pondering the signification of [...] "Institution," [...] and endeavouring to make out {{a connection between the}} first words and the verse of Scripture, when the sound of a cough close behind me made me turn my head. I saw a girl sitting on a stone bench near; she <b>was</b> <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> a book, on the perusal of which she seemed intent: from where I stood I could see the title--it was [...] "Rasselas;" [...] a name that struck me as strange, and consequently attractive. In turning a leaf she happened to look up, and I said to her directly-- ...|$|E
60|$|It was {{an awkward}} mix-up. The sled was upside down and jammed between a tree-trunk and a huge rock, and {{they were forced to}} {{unharness}} the dogs in order to straighten out the tangle. The two men <b>were</b> <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> the sled and trying to right it, when Henry observed One Ear sidling away.|$|R

50|$|Lucy sees Mrs. Jessel {{sitting at}} what was once Anna's tea party table. There is a {{flashback}} demonstrating that Mrs Jessel was a very strict ballet teacher: a girl leaves the ballet class and Jessel later finds her dead in Anna's room; Anna <b>is</b> <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> the girl, drinking her blood. It is revealed that the Jessels are vampires.|$|R
