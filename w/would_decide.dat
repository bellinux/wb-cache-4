5|$|Due to time constraints, some {{plot points}} of Asellus story were removed. During those events, Asellus was {{supposed}} to visit Dr. Nusakan's clinic, Bio Research Lab, Lambda Base, and Furdo's Workshop {{so that she would}} find her true identity so that she <b>would</b> <b>decide</b> to live as a human being or as a mystic. These quests were also intended to affect her scenario's ending.|$|E
5|$|Ali {{ordered that}} if he died from the wound, Ibn Muljam had to be {{executed}} in retaliation. Otherwise, if he survived, he <b>would</b> <b>decide</b> on how to treat him. Ali died two days later on 21 Ramadan 40/30 January 661 (or 19 Ramadan 40/28 January 661) {{at the age of}} 62 or 63, and Ibn Muljam was killed in retaliation (Qisas) by Hasan ibn Ali, in accordance to Ali's instruction.|$|E
50|$|Until the 20th century, {{traditional}} {{choice of}} law rules {{were based on the}} principle that legal rights vest automatically at legally significant and ascertainable times and places. For example, a dispute regarding property <b>would</b> be <b>decided</b> by the law of the place the property was located. Disputes in tort <b>would</b> be <b>decided</b> by the place where the injury occurred.|$|R

5|$|Each Poor Law Union {{employed}} {{one or more}} relieving officers, {{whose job}} it was to visit those applying for assistance and assess what relief, if any, they should be given. Any applicants considered to be in need of immediate assistance could be issued with a note admitting them directly to the workhouse. Alternatively they might be offered any necessary money or goods to tide them over until the next meeting of the guardians, who <b>would</b> <b>decide</b> on the appropriate level of support {{and whether or not}} the applicants should be assigned to the workhouse.|$|E
5|$|In 1572, Sigismund II Augustus, {{the last}} {{king of the}} Jagiellonian dynasty, died without any heirs. The {{political}} system was not prepared for this eventuality, as there was no method of choosing a new king. After much debate {{it was determined that}} the entire nobility of Poland and Lithuania <b>would</b> <b>decide</b> who the king was to be. The nobility were to gather at Wola, near Warsaw, to vote in the royal election.|$|E
5|$|In May 2011, it was {{reported}} that Dot's estranged half-sister, Rose, would join the series, played by Polly Perkins. Reports stated that Dot and Rose fell out when the latter had an affair with the former's husband, Charlie, but Dot <b>would</b> <b>decide</b> to track Rose down after suffering a bout of hypochondria, feeling it is time to put things right, however, Rose will not be pleased to see Dot again after so many years.|$|E

5|$|Napoleon had {{calculated}} that Kutuzov, expecting reinforcements from Russia {{to defend its}} political allies, would withdraw toward Vienna; he envisioned that his and Kutuzov's armies would engage in a great battle at Vienna, and that this battle <b>would</b> <b>decide</b> the war. Consequently, Napoleon drew divisions from four of the other seven corps of the Grande Armée {{to create a new}} VIII Corps. This corps was to secure the north shore of the Danube, block any of the Austrian or Russian groups from reinforcing one another and, more importantly, prevent Kutuzov from crossing the river and escaping to Russia.|$|E
5|$|On 7 February, several {{news outlets}} {{reported}} that JAL <b>would</b> <b>decide</b> {{to keep its}} alliance with American Airlines and end talks with Delta. Inamori and ETIC officials, according to the reports, decided that switching alliances from Oneworld to Skyteam would be too risky and could hinder JAL's ability to turn around quickly. Two days later, JAL officially announced that they would strengthen their partnership with American, including a joint application for antitrust immunity on transpacific routes. The airline would also fortify its relationship with other partners in the Oneworld alliance.|$|E
5|$|Ralf Schumacher {{was passed}} {{fit in the}} days leading up to the race. At the {{previous}} race, he had suffered a serious crash at the Sainte Devote corner and he sustained a three-inch gash on his left calf which required stitches. The Williams team had their test driver Bruno Junqueira ready to replace Ralf Schumacher should the latter have been not ready to race. Ralf Schumacher said that he <b>would</b> <b>decide</b> after the event's first free practice sessions whether he would compete.|$|E

5|$|Saavedra {{settled in}} San Juan in 1814. He {{had a new}} son, Pedro Cornelio, and {{maintained}} a simple life growing grapes. He awaited the final decision of Posadas, but the supreme director had a political crisis at the time. The Spanish king Ferdinand VII {{had returned to the}} throne and demanded the colonies to return to their former organization, the royalists at Upper Peru were still a threat, and José Gervasio Artigas opposed Buenos Aires as well, because of its high centralism. As a result, Carlos María de Alvear became the new supreme director, who <b>would</b> <b>decide</b> the final fate of Cornelio Saavedra.|$|E
5|$|The tribe was {{represented}} by Charles A. Hobbs of Washington, D.C. The tribe argued that the Menominee Termination Act did not extinguish treaty rights, but instead had two purposes; to terminate federal supervision of the tribe and to transfer to the state general criminal and civil jurisdictionwhich had already been accomplished by Public Law 280 and that law expressly preserved hunting and fishing rights. In {{the event that the}} court <b>would</b> <b>decide</b> that the hunting and fishing rights were extinguished, then the tribe should receive compensation for the loss of the rights.|$|E
5|$|Ultimately, the four-game {{series was}} split with two wins for each team, and the Tigers {{maintained}} a two-game lead {{with only three}} games remaining for each club. The Tigers lost two of their next three games to the Chicago White Sox, whereas the Twins swept the Kansas City Royals in a three-game series leaving both teams tied with an 86–76 record. A tiebreaker game <b>would</b> <b>decide</b> {{the winner of the}} Central division while the loser would be eliminated from playoff contention. Prior to the 2009 season, home field advantage in a tiebreaker game was decided by a series of coin tosses held {{towards the end of the}} regular season that <b>would</b> <b>decide</b> the home teams of all possible tiebreakers. A rule change following the 2008 season altered this process, leaving the site determined on a series of performance-based criteria beginning with the head-to-head record between the two teams that were tied. Therefore, the Twins took home-field advantage in this game, by virtue of winning the season series against the Tigers 11–7. The game was the third MLB tie-breaker in as many seasons, a record number for the league.|$|E

5|$|Vizzini’s {{support for}} the DC was not a secret. During the crucial 1948 {{elections}} that <b>would</b> <b>decide</b> on Italy’s post-war future, Vizzini and Genco Russo sat {{at the same table}} with leading DC politicians, attending an electoral lunch. In the course of the start of the Cold War, the 1948 elections were a triumph for the Christian Democrats, who would govern Italy with up and downs for the next 45 years in different coalitions. One of its main aims was to keep the Italian Communist Party – the biggest communist party in a NATO member state – away from power.|$|E
5|$|Before Animaniacs was {{put into}} {{production}} in 1991, various collaboration and brainstorming efforts were thought up to create both the characters and premise of the series. For instance, ideas that were thrown out were Rita and Runt being the hosts of the show and the Warners being duck characters that senior producer Tom Ruegger drew in his college years. After the characters from the series were created, they were all shown to executive producer Steven Spielberg, who <b>would</b> <b>decide</b> which characters would make it into Animaniacs (the characters Buttons and Mindy were chosen by Spielberg's daughter). The characters' designs came from various sources, including caricatures of other writers, designs based on early cartoon characters, and characters that simply had a more modern design.|$|E
5|$|Davies {{reacted to}} his deselection by announcing {{that the people}} of Merthyr, not the local Labour Party, <b>would</b> <b>decide</b> his future. If {{physically}} fit he would contest the next election as an Independent Socialist. Friends advised him not to risk humiliation; no deselected candidate in recent times had won election against the party machine, and Davies would, they predicted, get no more than 1,000 votes. Within a few days of the deselection meeting Wilson called a snap general election, which gave the Merthyr party little time to find their new candidate. They chose Tal Lloyd, an Amalgamated Engineering Union (AEU) official, a long-serving councillor and a former mayor, on the moderate wing of the Labour Party, and a strong supporter of Wilson.|$|E

Huff had been close to dropping out but ended the session with the fifth fastest time.|$|R
60|$|The {{temptation to}} stop {{for a few minutes}} in Tafelberg for a visit with his old friend Herr Kramer was strong, but fear that he might be {{recognized}} by others, who would not guard his secret so well as the shopkeeper of Tafelberg <b>would,</b> <b>decided</b> him to keep on his way. So he flew through the familiar main street of the quaint old village at a speed that was little, if any less, than fifty miles an hour.|$|R

5|$|In February 1946, the NHL officially {{stated that}} the trophy {{was to go to}} the team that allowed the fewest number of goals during the regular season. The goaltender playing the most games for that team would be awarded the Trophy. Manager Tommy Gorman of the Montreal Canadiens stated that if the trophy was awarded to his team, {{management}} <b>would</b> <b>decide</b> which of the Habs' two goaltenders (Paul Bibeault and Bill Durnan) would receive the trophy. However, at a banquet that October, NHL President Clarence Campbell indicated that while the league was considering changing the voting methods of the Calder, Hart, and Lady Byng Trophies, the criteria for the Vezina were not actually changing.|$|E
5|$|The Republicans {{nominated}} Andrew T. Wood, {{a lawyer}} from Mount Sterling, who had failed in earlier elections for Congress and state attorney general. Concurrently with the gubernatorial election, the state's voters <b>would</b> <b>decide</b> whether to ratify a proposed new constitution {{for the state}} in 1891. The divided Democrats had taken no stand on the document {{as part of their}} convention's platform, and Wood spent much of the campaign trying to get Brown to declare his support for or opposition to it. About six weeks before the election, Brown, sensing strong public support for the new constitution, finally came out in favor of it. For the remainder of the race, Wood touted an alleged conspiracy between Brown and the Louisville and Nashville Railroad to thwart meaningful corporate regulations, but the issue failed to gain much traction.|$|E
5|$|With 100 {{percent of}} precincts reporting, initial counts from the {{election}} had Murphy leading by about 60 votes out of over 150,000 cast. Columbia County's Board of Elections amended its tally the following day, reducing Murphy's lead to 25 votes. The lead alternated {{between the two}} candidates throughout early recanvassing; {{at one point the}} New York State Board of Elections had listed the election at a zero-vote margin, with each candidate having exactly 77,225 votes. By April 2, Tedisco was ahead by 12 votes. He resigned the position of Assembly Minority Leader on April 5 in preparation for a transition to Congress, and was replaced by Brian Kolb the following day. On April 7, Tedisco was ahead by 97 votes. The close tally meant that absentee ballots <b>would</b> <b>decide</b> the race.|$|E
