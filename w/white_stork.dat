5|$|Predators of {{the tree}} sparrow include a variety of accipiters, falcons and owls, such as the Eurasian sparrowhawk, common kestrel, little owl, and {{sometimes}} long-eared owl and <b>white</b> <b>stork.</b> It {{does not appear to}} be at an increased risk of predation during its autumn moult, despite having fewer flight feathers at that time. Nests may be raided by Eurasian magpies, jays, least weasels, rats, cats and constricting snakes such as the horseshoe whip snake.|$|E
5|$|Strandzha is {{situated}} on Via Pontica, the second-largest bird migratory route in Europe. The bays and estuaries along the Black Sea coast are a wintering destination for some birds. There are 269 avian {{species in the}} park, including populations of global importance of white-backed woodpecker, semi-collared flycatcher, olive-tree warbler and sombre tit, as well as populations of European importance of Egyptian vulture, <b>white</b> <b>stork,</b> black stork, Eurasian eagle owl and four eagle species.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian tree sparrow's untidy nest {{is built}} in a natural cavity, a hole in a {{building}} or the large nest of a European magpie or <b>white</b> <b>stork.</b> The typical clutch is five or six eggs which hatch in under two weeks. This sparrow feeds mainly on seeds, but invertebrates are also consumed, particularly during the breeding season. As with other small birds, infection by parasites and diseases, and predation by birds of prey take their toll, and the typical life span is about two years.|$|E
40|$|Mating {{calls of}} animals are often {{detected}} by unintended receivers which use sexual signals {{to obtain information}} about the signaller. We investigated whether <b>white</b> <b>storks</b> Ciconia ciconia can eavesdrop mating calls of moor frogs Rana arvalis. <b>White</b> <b>storks</b> are dependent on moor frog abundance in early breeding season. Interspecific eavesdropping by predators is common and well documented in tropical anurans, whereas it is less known in temperate zone. We compared the frequency of approaches of <b>white</b> <b>storks</b> to loudspeakers when frog calls and the song thrush Turdus philomelos songs were simultaneously played back using the later as controls. The loudspeaker broadcasting the calls of male moor frogs clearly attracted <b>white</b> <b>storks</b> at 22 out of 84 nests. The bird songs attracted <b>white</b> <b>storks</b> in only one case. In 19 cases birds left the nest for unknown reasons which were considered as potential foraging movements. The results of this field experiment report a new case of eavesdropping on acoustic signals showing that advertisement calls of temperate moor frogs are an important stimulus for <b>white</b> <b>storks.</b> Communication usually involves the provision of informa-tion by a sender to a receiver. The provision of information is not accidental but occurs only because it benefits the sender (Marler 1977). However, animals can also produce stimuli that are used by other animals to the sender’...|$|R

5|$|The {{black stork}} has {{a wider range}} of calls than the <b>white</b> <b>stork,</b> its main call being a chee leee, which sounds like a loud inhalation. It makes a hissing call as a warning or threat. Displaying males produce a long series of wheezy raptor-like {{squealing}} calls rising in volume and then falling. It rarely indulges in mutual bill-clattering when adults meet at the nest. Adults will do so as part of their mating ritual or when angered. The young clatter their bills when aroused.|$|E
5|$|Foraging {{for food}} takes place mostly in fresh water, though the black stork may look for food {{on dry land}} at times. The black stork wades patiently and slowly in shallow water, often alone or in a small group if food is plentiful. It has been {{observed}} shading the water with its wings while hunting. In India, it often forages in mixed species flocks with the <b>white</b> <b>stork,</b> woolly-necked stork (Ciconia episcopus), demoiselle crane (Grus virgo) and bar-headed goose (Anser indicus). The black stork also follows large mammals such as deer and livestock, presumably to eat the invertebrates and small animals flushed by their presence.|$|E
5|$|Predators of {{the corn}} crake on its European {{breeding}} grounds include feral and domestic cats, introduced American mink, feral ferrets, otters and red foxes, and birds including the common buzzard and hooded crow. In Lithuania, the introduced raccoon dog has also been recorded taking corn crakes. When chicks are exposed by rapid mowing, they may be taken by large birds including the <b>white</b> <b>stork,</b> harriers and other birds of prey, gulls and corvids. At undisturbed sites, nests and broods are rarely attacked, which {{is reflected in the}} high breeding success.|$|E

5|$|The {{black stork}} {{is a member}} of the genus Ciconia, or typical storks, a group of seven extant species, characterised by {{straight}} bills and mainly black and white plumage. The black stork was long thought to be most closely related to the <b>white</b> <b>stork</b> (C. ciconia). However, genetic analysis via DNA–DNA hybridization and mitochondrial cytochrome b DNA by Beth Slikas in 1997 found that it was basal (an early offshoot) in the genus Ciconia. Fossil remains have been recovered from Miocene beds on Rusinga and Maboko Islands in Kenya, which are indistinguishable from the white and black storks.|$|E
5|$|The {{black stork}} prefers more wooded areas than the better-known <b>white</b> <b>stork,</b> and breeds in large marshy {{wetlands}} with interspersed coniferous or broadleaved woodlands, but also inhabits hills and mountains with sufficient networks of creeks. It usually inhabits ponds, rivers, edges of lakes, estuaries and other freshwater wetlands. The black stork does inhabit more agricultural {{areas in the}} Caspian lowlands, but even here it avoids close contact with people. Its wintering habitat in India comprises reservoirs or rivers with nearby scrub or forest, which provide trees that black storks can roost in at night. In southern Africa it is found in shallow water in rivers or lakes, or swamps, but is occasionally encountered on dry land.|$|E

5|$|Unlike the {{closely related}} <b>white</b> <b>stork,</b> the black stork is a shy and wary species. It is seen singly or in pairs, usually in marshy areas, rivers or inland waters. It feeds on amphibians, small fish and insects, {{generally}} wading slowly {{in shallow water}} stalking its prey. Breeding pairs usually build nests in large forest trees—most commonly deciduous but also coniferous—which {{can be seen from}} long distances, as well as on large boulders, or under overhanging ledges in mountainous areas. The female lays two to five greyish-white eggs, which become soiled over time in the nest. Incubation takes 32 to 38 days,with both sexes sharing duties, and fledging takes 60 to 71 days.|$|E
25|$|Although colonial {{breeding}} {{is common}} amongst storks, the maguari stork differs in that courting {{takes place in}} congregations before established breeding pairs remove themselves to each of their nesting sites; whereas similar species such as the <b>white</b> <b>stork</b> and the oriental <b>white</b> <b>stork</b> court directly at the nest. These nuptial congregations in the maguari stork occur at freshwater marshes {{that have already been}} flooded with rainwater to a depth of about 20cm and are the venue either for the formation of new pair-bonds in young individuals or for the reunion of mates from previous years. In the latter case however, it is unknown whether both mates enter the courtship assembly together or locate each other after each having migrated there separately.|$|E
25|$|There are a {{wide variety}} of birds, such as the tawny owl, the long-eared owl, the eagle owl, hawks, and short-toed eagles. Other birds of prey have been recorded, as well as a growing number of ravens, crows and magpies {{migrating}} into Ljubljana and Maribor where they thrive. Other birds include black and green woodpeckers and the <b>white</b> <b>stork,</b> which nests mainly in Prekmurje.|$|E

25|$|Fossils of the extinct Pleistocene stork Ciconia maltha {{discovered}} in North America appear morphologically intermediate between the maguari stork and <b>white</b> <b>stork</b> and may therefore represent a common ancestral link {{between these two}} species that inhabit different continents. Ciconia maltha was probably highly dispersive and could have extended its range to Venezuela from North America during the Pliocene, part {{of the range of}} the extant maguari stork.|$|E
25|$|This stork may be {{especially}} vulnerable in the llanos of Venezuela. Its population declined strongly there in recent past decades starting from 1977 and less than 5000 individuals were estimated {{to live in this}} region through most of the 1980s. A potentially effective conservation strategy to help protect this stork's natural habitat in the llanos is the expansion and maintenance of cattle ranches in the savanna grassland matrix in preference to crop cultivation; because such ranches are similar in vegetation structure to natural grasslands. Another potentially useful conservation measure is the deployment of artificial nesting platforms to encourage nesting of maguari storks, as has been done for the <b>white</b> <b>stork</b> in Europe. Despite its relatively unthreatened overall status, the maguari stork should deserve closer global population monitoring to better safeguard it from future potential large-scale declines across its entire range.|$|E

50|$|West Nile virus (WNV) {{is mainly}} a bird {{infection}} that is transmitted between birds by mosquitos. Migrating birds {{appear to be}} important in spread of the virus, the ecology of which remains poorly known. On 26 August 1998, a flock of about 1,200 migrating <b>white</b> <b>storks</b> that had been blown off course on their southward journey landed in Eilat, in southern Israel. The flock was stressed as it had resorted to flapping flight to return to its migratory route, and a number of birds died. A virulent strain of West Nile virus was isolated from the brains of eleven dead juveniles. Other <b>white</b> <b>storks</b> subsequently tested in Israel have shown anti-WNV antibodies. In 2008 three juvenile <b>white</b> <b>storks</b> from a Polish wildlife refuge yielded seropositive results indicating exposure to the virus, but the context or existence of the virus in Poland is unclear.|$|R

500|$|The Eurasian {{tree sparrow}} reaches {{breeding}} maturity {{within a year}} from hatching, and typically builds its nest in a cavity in an old tree or rock face. Some nests are not in holes as such, but are built among roots of overhanging gorse or similar bush. Roof cavities in houses may be used, and in the tropics, the crown of a palm tree or the ceiling of a verandah {{can serve as a}} nest site. [...] This species will breed in the disused domed nest of a European magpie, or an active or unused stick nest of a large bird such as the <b>white</b> <b>stork,</b> white-tailed eagle, osprey, black kite or grey heron. It will sometimes attempt to take over the nest of other birds that breed in holes or enclosed spaces, such as the barn swallow, house martin, sand martin or European bee-eater.|$|E
500|$|Migration {{takes place}} from early August to October, {{with a major}} exodus in September. Some of the Iberian populations, and also those in {{southern}} Africa, are essentially non-migratory, though they may wander freely in the non-breeding areas. A broad-winged soaring bird, the black stork is assisted by thermals of hot air for long-distance flight, although is less dependent on them than is the <b>white</b> <b>stork.</b> Since thermals only form over land, the black stork, together with large raptors, must cross the Mediterranean at the narrowest points, and many black storks travel south through the Bosphorus, {{as well as the}} Sinai and Gibraltar. The trip is around [...] via the western route and [...] via the eastern route, with satellite tracking yielding an average travel time of 37 and 80 days respectively. The western route goes over the Rock of Gibraltar or over the Bay of Gibraltar, generally on a southwesterly track that takes them to {{the central part of the}} strait, from where they reach Morocco. Many birds fly around the Sahara next to the coast. About 10% of the western storks choose the passage Sicily – Cap Bon, Tunisia.|$|E
500|$|The {{committee}} {{keeps the}} list of species it considers under review and, from time to time, makes changes. These are usually because species have increased in frequency and no longer meet the numerical criteria for inclusion. A species is removed if {{it has more than}} 150 records in the preceding ten years, with ten or more in at least eight of those years. Different criteria were used in a review in 2006 (see below). [...] There have been three major [...] "purges" [...] of species since the committee's formation. The first was soon after the committee's formation, in 1963, when 16 species were removed: red-crested pochard, snow goose, pectoral sandpiper, Mediterranean gull, Sabine's gull, melodious warbler, icterine warbler, yellow-browed warbler, northern goshawk, golden eagle, red kite, Kentish plover, crested tit, bearded tit, marsh warbler and Dartford warbler. Records of the last eight species had been considered only outside their [...] "normal" [...] British range (e.g. crested tits outside Scotland, and red kites outside Wales). The second was in 1982, when ten further species were removed: Cory's shearwater, purple heron, <b>white</b> <b>stork,</b> buff-breasted sandpiper, Richard's pipit, tawny pipit, Savi's warbler, aquatic warbler, serin and common rosefinch. Savi's warbler was re-admitted to the committee's list in 1998, due to declining numbers of occurrences. Thirdly, in 2006, a further 17 species were dropped from the list: ferruginous duck, Wilson’s petrel, great white egret, black kite, red-footed falcon, American golden plover, white-rumped sandpiper, white-winged black tern, alpine swift, red-rumped swallow, red-throated pipit, subalpine warbler, greenish warbler, dusky warbler, Radde's warbler, Arctic redpoll and rustic bunting. Their selection was based on different criteria from those previously used: more than 200 records in Britain ever, and more than 100 occasions in the last decade.|$|E
50|$|A {{decline in}} {{population}} began in the 19th century due to industrialisation and changes in agricultural methods. <b>White</b> <b>storks</b> no longer nest in many countries, and the current strongholds of the western population are in Portugal, Spain, Ukraine and Poland. In the Iberian Peninsula, populations are concentrated in the southwest, and have also declined due to agricultural practices. A study published in 2005 found that the Podhale region in the uplands of southern Poland had seen an influx of <b>white</b> <b>storks,</b> which first bred there in 1931 and have nested at progressively higher altitudes since, reaching 890 m (3000 ft) in 1999. The authors proposed that this was related to climate warming and the influx of other animals and plants to higher altitudes. <b>White</b> <b>storks</b> arriving in Poznań province (Greater Poland Voivodeship) in western Poland in spring to breed did so some 10 days earlier in {{the last twenty years}} of the 20th century than {{at the end of the}} 19th century.|$|R
