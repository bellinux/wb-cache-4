40|$|AbstractThe paper {{deals with}} quality {{measures}} of <b>whole</b> <b>sets</b> of rules extracted from data, as a counterpart to {{more commonly used}} measures of individual rules.

Then three particular approaches to extending ruleset quality measures from classification to general rulesets are discussed. The paper also recalls the possibility to measure the dependence of classification rulesets on parameters of the classification method by means of ROC curves, and proposes a generalization of ROC curves to general rulesets. Finally, the approach is illustrated on rulesets extracted with four important rules extraction methods from the well-known iris data...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{deals with}} quality {{measures}} of <b>whole</b> <b>sets</b> of rules extracted from data, as a counterpart to {{more commonly used}} measures of individual rules. This research has been motivated by increasingly frequent extraction of non-classification rules, such as association rules and rules of observational logic, in real-world data mining tasks. The paer sketches the typology of rules extraction methods and of their rulesets, and recalls that quality measures for <b>whole</b> <b>sets</b> of rules have been so far used only {{in the case of}} classification rulesets. It then proposes three possible ways how such measures can be extended to general rulesets.

Finally, a brief illustration on rulesets extracted by means of the method GUHA is given. ...|$|R

25|$|More {{than any}} other feature in the test, content {{response}} can be controlled consciously by the subject, and may be elicited by very disparate factors, which {{makes it difficult to}} use content alone to draw any conclusions about the subject's personality; with certain individuals, content responses may potentially be interpreted directly, and some information can at times be obtained by analyzing thematic trends in the <b>whole</b> <b>set</b> of content responses (which is only feasible when several responses are available), but in general content cannot be analyzed outside of the context of the entire test record.|$|E
25|$|As {{mentioned}} earlier, the cooperatives {{had very}} mixed success; {{and the majority}} were converted into individual private holdings during the 1980s.

The preferences {{of the people involved}} at that point clearly went contrary to the intent of the original reform. But the <b>whole</b> <b>set</b> of changes was not a reversion to the pre-reform agrarian structure. In fact, the conversions left Peru with a far less unequal pattern of landownership than it had prior to the reform and with a much greater role for family farming than ever before in its history.|$|E

Car 5248 was taken out of service in 2004 due to cracked truck bolsters. While 5282 and 5319 were completely destroyed and subsequently scrapped in the late 1990s, the other cars were stored out of service for parts until they were scrapped in 2013 {{with the rest of the}} NYCTA-operated cars.|$|E
25|$|Measure {{theory was}} {{developed}} in successive stages during the late 19th and early 20th centuries by Émile Borel, Henri Lebesgue, Johann Radon, and Maurice Fréchet, among others. The main applications of measures are in {{the foundations of the}} Lebesgue integral, in Andrey Kolmogorov's axiomatisation of probability theory and in ergodic theory. In integration theory, specifying a measure allows one to define integrals on spaces more general than subsets of Euclidean space; moreover, the integral with respect to the Lebesgue measure on Euclidean spaces is more general and has a richer theory than its predecessor, the Riemann integral. Probability theory considers measures that assign to the <b>whole</b> <b>set</b> the size 1, and considers measurable subsets to be events whose probability is given by the measure. Ergodic theory considers measures that are invariant under, or arise naturally from, a dynamical system.|$|E
25|$|Inspired by {{colonies of}} insects such as ants and bees, {{researchers}} are modeling {{the behavior of}} swarms of thousands of tiny robots which together perform a useful task, such as finding something hidden, cleaning, or spying. Each robot is quite simple, but the emergent behavior of the swarm is more complex. The <b>whole</b> <b>set</b> of robots {{can be considered as}} one single distributed system, in the same way an ant colony can be considered a superorganism, exhibiting swarm intelligence. The largest swarms so far created include the iRobot swarm, the SRI/MobileRobots CentiBots project and the Open-source Micro-robotic Project swarm, which are being used to research collective behaviors. Swarms are also more resistant to failure. Whereas one large robot may fail and ruin a mission, a swarm can continue even if several robots fail. This could make them attractive for space exploration missions, where failure is normally extremely costly.|$|E

25|$|Texas Instruments v. Fairchild: In {{their legal}} wars, Texas Instruments {{focused on their}} largest and most technologically {{advanced}} competitor, Fairchild Semiconductor. Their cases hindered not the production at Fairchild, but the sale of licenses for their technologies. By 1965, the planar technology of Fairchild became the industry standard, but the license to patents of Hoerni and Noyce was purchased by less than ten manufacturers, {{and there were no}} mechanisms to pursue unlicensed production. Similarly, the key patents of Kilby were bringing no income to Texas Instruments. In 1964, the patent arbitration awarded Texas Instruments the rights to four of the five key provisions of the contested patents, but both companies appealed the decision. The litigation could continue for years, if not the defeat of Texas Instruments in the dispute with Sprague in April 1966. Texas Instruments realized that they could not claim priority for the <b>whole</b> <b>set</b> of key IC patents, and lost interest in the patent war. In the summer of 1966, Texas Instruments and Fairchild agreed on the mutual recognition of patents and cross-licensing of key patents; in 1967 they were joined by Sprague.|$|E

25|$|As in {{all other}} Trading Card Games, booster packs are the primary avenue of card {{distribution}}. In Konami's distribution areas, five or nine random cards are found in each booster pack depending on the set and each set contains around one hundred different cards. However, in Upper Deck's areas, early booster packs contained a random assortment of nine cards (rarity and value varies), with the <b>whole</b> <b>set</b> ranging around one hundred and thirty cards. To {{catch up with the}} Japanese meta game, two or more original sets were combined into one. Now, more recent Upper Deck sets have simply duplicated the original set. Some booster sets are reprinted/reissued (e.g. Dark Beginnings Volume 1 and 2). This type of set usually contains a larger number of cards (around 200 to 250), and they contain twelve cards along with one tip card rather than the normal five or nine. Since the release of Tactical Evolution, all booster packs that have a Holographic/Ghost Rare card, will also contain a rare, meaning if you receive a Holofoil card in a pack you will still receive 1 Rare card and 7 Common cards. Current sets have 100 different cards per set. There are also special booster packs that are given to those who attend a tournament. These sets change each time there is a different tournament and have fewer cards than a typical booster pack. There are eight Tournament Packs, eight Champion Packs, and 10 Turbo Packs.|$|E
