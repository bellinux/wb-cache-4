40|$|It is not {{an unusual}} {{complaint}} that in patients with atopic dermatitis, psoriasis vulgaris or hand eczema, using <b>warm</b> <b>water</b> causes pain and/or itching of the injured skin. In using <b>warm</b> <b>water,</b> there are some patients with injured skin who do not complain of pain and/or itching and ordinary patients with skin injured as much as former who complain of pain and/or itching. This made us think {{that there must be}} a difference in the <b>warm</b> <b>water</b> used by these patients. Usually we get <b>warm</b> <b>water</b> from gas instantly heated water or from electrically heated stored water. In patients using <b>warm</b> <b>water</b> from gas instantly heated water the complaints were more frequent than in patients using <b>warm</b> <b>water</b> from electrically heated stored water. Residual chlorine in water is well known to be the main factor worsening skin disease. Therfore, residual chlorine levels in gas instantly heated water and electrically heated stored water were measured at same temperature (40 ℃). Levels of the former were 67. 5 ～ 77. 5 % and that of the latter were 12. 5 - 31. 7 % of tap water. Then this significant difference in the levels of residual chlorine was thought to be a cause for the difference of complaints between patients using <b>warm</b> <b>water</b> from gas instantly heated water and patients using <b>warm</b> <b>water</b> from electrically heated stored water...|$|R

The aim {{of this study was to}} compare effect of Entonox and <b>warm</b> <b>water</b> on labor pain in pregnant women referred to Khorramabad Assali hospital. Materials and Methods: This controlled clinical trial study, carried out on 150 pregnant women in active phase of first stage of delivery selected by simple sampling including three groups of Entonox (first experimental group, 50 cases), <b>warm</b> <b>water</b> (second experimental group, 50 cases) and routine method (control, 50 cases). The pain score measured with Visual analog scale (VAS). Pulse oximetry was used to determine oxyhamoglobin saturation(SaO 2) and heartbeat rate during these methods. Results: The results showed that the mean of pain score in Entonox method was significantly lower than <b>warm</b> <b>water</b> method (p < 0. 001). Labor progress was higher in Entonox method than <b>warm</b> <b>water</b> method and this difference was significant(p= 0. 005). The means of mother’s pulse rate in response to pain was significantly lower in Entonox method than <b>warm</b> <b>water</b> method(p< 0. 001). The mean of mothers’ SaO 2 in Entonox method was significantly higher than <b>warm</b> <b>water</b> method (p < 0. 001).

The large El Niño event of 1997 – 98 resulted in a significant discharge of <b>warm</b> <b>water</b> toward the higher latitudes within {{the interior of the}} Pacific Ocean. The exchange of anomalous <b>warm</b> <b>water</b> volume with the Northern Hemisphere appears to be blocked under the intertropical convergence zone, consistent with most current ideas on the time-mean tropical–subtropical exchange. Little of the <b>warm</b> <b>water</b> dis-charged northward across 5 ° and 8 °N during the 1997 – 98 El Niño event could be traced as far as 10 °N. To the south, however, these anomalous volumes of <b>warm</b> <b>water</b> were visible {{at least as far as}} 20 °S, primarily in the longitudes around 130 °– 160 °W.

The aimed {{of this study was}} to compare the effectivity of tepid sponge bath with 32 oC and 37 oC <b>warm</b> <b>water</b> on decreasing body temperature at toddler with fever. Method: A quasy experimental pre post test design was used in this study. The population was toddler who had body temperature ≥ 38 oC which treated in anggrek pediatric room dr.

There were 26 respondents recruited by using purposive sampling technique and divided into two group, each of 13 respondents received tepid sponge bath with 32 oC and others received tepid sponge bath with 37 oC <b>warm</b> <b>water.</b> The independent variable was tepid sponge bath and dependent variable was body temperature. Data were collected by using digital termometere and noted in respondent observation, then analyzed by using Paired t-Test and Mann Withney U-Test. Result: The result showed that there was an effectivity on decreasing body temperature by giving tepid sponge bath with 32 oC and 37 oC <b>warm</b> <b>water</b> with significance level p= 0. 000 and there was a difference decreasing body temperature among both of them with significance level p= 0. 016.
