50|$|A {{stationary}} {{package of}} yarn {{is used to}} supply the weft yarns in the rapier machine. One end of a rapier, a rod or steel tape, carries the <b>weft</b> <b>yarn.</b> The {{other end of the}} rapier is connected to the control system. The rapier moves across the width of the fabric, carrying the <b>weft</b> <b>yarn</b> across through the shed to the opposite side. The rapier is then retracted, leaving the new pick in place.|$|E
5000|$|The {{simplest}} shuttles, {{known as}} [...] "stick shuttles", {{are made from}} a flat, narrow piece of wood with notches on the ends to hold the <b>weft</b> <b>yarn.</b> More complicated shuttles incorporate bobbins or pirns.|$|E
5000|$|Woolen is a soft, short-staple, {{carded wool}} yarn {{typically}} used for knitting. [...] In traditional weaving, woolen <b>weft</b> <b>yarn</b> (for softness and warmth) is frequently {{combined with a}} worsted warp yarn for strength on the loom.|$|E
50|$|Using {{specialist}} weaving {{software from}} Pointcarre the illustrators artwork first {{needs to be}} calibrated for the jacquard loom, taking into consideration the weave construction and warp and <b>weft</b> <b>yarns.</b> The warp yarns are 2/30NE Cotton {{in black and white}} end-on-end, and the <b>weft</b> <b>yarns</b> are 1/10NM Flax and Linen (we need the yarn information from the linen mill).|$|R

40|$|Enzymatic {{hydrolysis}} {{of cotton}} fabrics with different <b>weft</b> <b>yarns</b> has been studied. The <b>weft</b> <b>yarns</b> used were commercial cotton yarns {{produced by the}} carded, combed, open-end, air-jet and core-spun systems. The effects of cellulases hydrolysis on different fabrics were investigated by measuring the weight loss, the amount of glucose released and the breaking load of <b>weft</b> <b>yarns.</b> The {{results showed that the}} weight loss and concentration of glucose in hydrolysis vary with the increase of yarn hairiness. Loss of breaking load in shorter treatment times was related to hairiness of weft yams but in longer enzymatic hydrolysis times, strength loss was affected by the amount of glucose released. Key Words: enzymatic hydrolysis, cellulase, spinning system, open-end, core-spu...|$|R
50|$|Weft ikat uses resist-dyeing for the weft yarns. The {{movement}} of the weft yarns in the weaving process means precisely delineated patterns {{are more difficult to}} weave. The <b>weft</b> <b>yarn</b> must be adjusted after each passing of the shuttle to preserve the pattern.|$|E
5000|$|Kad/Ekdhoti: A single {{shuttle is}} used for weaving of weft. The colours of the warp yarn is {{different}} from that of the <b>weft</b> <b>yarn.</b> It has a narali border and simple buttis like paisa, watana, etc. Kad is also a form of lungi and is used by male Maharashtrians.|$|E
50|$|A {{shuttle is}} a tool {{designed}} to neatly and compactly store a holder that carries the thread of the <b>weft</b> <b>yarn</b> while weaving with a loom. Shuttles are thrown or passed {{back and forth through}} the shed, between the yarn threads of the warp in order to weave in the weft.|$|E
40|$|Small {{fragment}} of yellowed woven wool fabric.; Very tattered and dirty. Some areas are {{held together by}} only a few warp yarns. Loose sections have twisted away {{from the direction of}} the rest of the fabric and have become twisted back onto another section. In two of these areas the loose warp and <b>weft</b> <b>yarns</b> have become partially felted to the rest of the fabric. Many of the <b>weft</b> <b>yarns</b> are abraded...|$|R
50|$|The sheen and softer feel of sateen is {{produced}} through the satin weave structure. Warp yarns are floated over <b>weft</b> <b>yarns,</b> for example four over and one under. (In a weft-faced satin or sateen, the <b>weft</b> <b>yarns</b> are floated over the warp yarns.) Standard plain weaves use a one-over, one-under structure. The long floats produce a surface that is smooth {{to the touch}} and reduces light scattering to increase shine. This weave structure is more susceptible to wear than other weaves.|$|R
40|$|Redesigning the cross-striped fabrics {{obtained}} through {{the association of}} <b>weft</b> <b>yarns</b> with different weave and/or lengthwise density on the cross stripes consists {{in the fact that}} no modifications are brought to the yarns from the warp system, and the <b>weft</b> <b>yarns</b> preserve their initial yarn setting. The mass modification is obtained only by using yarns with different lengthwise density, depending on thedesign theme. The proposed method offers the possibility to obtain, on the same warp, a diversity of cross-striped fabrics withdifferent lengthwise density, weave or length (width) ...|$|R
50|$|In weft ikat it is {{the weaving}} or <b>weft</b> <b>yarn</b> that carries the dyed patterns. Therefore, the pattern only appears as the weaving proceeds. Weft ikats are much slower to weave than warp ikat because the weft yarns must be {{carefully}} adjusted after each passing of the shuttle to maintain {{the clarity of the}} design.|$|E
5000|$|Damask ( [...] ; دمشق) is a {{reversible}} {{figured fabric}} of silk, wool, linen, cotton, or synthetic fibres, with a pattern formed by weaving. Damasks are woven with one warp yarn and one <b>weft</b> <b>yarn,</b> usually with the pattern in warp-faced satin weave {{and the ground}} in weft-faced or sateen weave. Twill damasks include a twill-woven ground or pattern.|$|E
5000|$|An air-jet loom is a {{shuttleless}} loom {{that uses a}} jet of air to propel the <b>weft</b> <b>yarn</b> through the shed. It {{is one of two}} types of fluid-jet looms, the other being a water-jet loom, which was developed previously. [...] Fluid-jet looms can operate at a faster speed than predecessor looms such as rapier looms, but they are not as common.|$|E
5000|$|In Europe {{between the}} fourteenth and seventeenth centuries woven pieces called [...] "tapestries" [...] took {{the place of}} {{paintings}} on walls. The Unicorn in Captivity {{is part of a}} series consisting of seven tapestry panels known as The Hunt of the Unicorn by Franco Flemish from this time period. Much of the art at the time in history was used to tell common folktales that also had a religious theme. As Mark Getlein wrote, [...] "Tapestry is a special type of weaving in which the <b>weft</b> <b>yarns</b> are manipulated freely to form a pattern or design {{on the front of the}} fabric...Often the <b>weft</b> <b>yarns</b> are of several colors and the weaver can use the different-colored yarns almost as flexible as a painter uses pigment on canvas." ...|$|R
40|$|Tapestries are {{produced}} by weaving on a loom where closely spaced, highly twisted yarns, known as warp yarns, are stretched and fixed in one direction. Less dense yarns are woven transverse to the warp yarns to produce the pattern; these are known as the <b>weft</b> <b>yarns.</b> On completion the tapestry is hung s...|$|R
30|$|The {{mechanical}} tests {{were performed on}} a Lloyd LR 5 K Plus electronic tensile strength machine according to EN ISO 2062 Standard. The breaking strength and elongation of warp and <b>weft</b> <b>yarns</b> at fracture were tested. Twenty samples were used for each test, and the test results were evaluated with SPSS 16.0 statistical analysis program.|$|R
50|$|Bobbinet tulle is {{constructed}} by {{warp and weft}} yarns in which the <b>weft</b> <b>yarn</b> is looped diagonally around the vertical warp yarn to form a hexagonal mesh which is regular and clearly defined. Bobbinet netting has a characteristic diagonal fabric appearance, is diagonally stable and slideproof, durable, sheer, the lightest bobbinet weighing no more than 6 g per m2 and has a high strength to weight ratio.|$|E
50|$|A beater is a weaving tool {{designed}} {{to push the}} <b>weft</b> <b>yarn</b> securely into place. In small hand weaving such as Inkle weaving and tablet weaving the beater may be combined with the shuttle into a single tool. In rigid heddle looms the beater is combined with the heddles. Beaters appear both in a hand-held form, and {{as an integral part}} of a loom.|$|E
5000|$|Satin is a weave that {{typically}} has a glossy surface and a dull back. The satin weave {{is characterized by}} four or more fill or weft yarns floating over a warp yarn or vice versa, four warp yarns floating over a single <b>weft</b> <b>yarn.</b> Floats are missed interfacings, where the warp yarn lies {{on top of the}} weft in a warp-faced satin and where the <b>weft</b> <b>yarn</b> lies on top of the warp yarns in weft-faced satins. These floats explain the even sheen, as unlike in other weaves, the light reflecting is not scattered as much by the fibres, which have fewer tucks. Satin is usually a warp-faced weaving technique in which warp yarns are [...] "floated" [...] over weft yarns, although there are also weft-faced satins. If a fabric is formed with a satin weave using filament fibres such as silk, nylon, or polyester, the corresponding fabric is termed a satin, although some definitions insist that the fabric be made from silk. If the yarns used are short-staple yarns such as cotton, the fabric formed is considered a sateen.|$|E
40|$|Small {{fragment}} of woven tapestry with linen warp. The tapestry <b>weft</b> <b>yarns</b> are linen and a coarse brown wool. A very {{small amount of}} red weft appears near one edge.

50|$|The Ghiordes knot (Turkish: Gördes düğümü) or Turkish knot {{is one of}} the two most-used knots {{employed}} in knotted-pile carpets. In the Ghiordes knot, the colored <b>weft</b> <b>yarn</b> passes over the two warp yarns, and is pulled through between them and then cut to form the pile. The Turkish knot has a symmetrical structure. The Ghiordes knot is the knot used in the oldest surviving pile carpets, the fragments found in Pazyryk kurgan burial mounds, in the Altai of Central Asia.|$|E
50|$|Weft {{patterns}} are popularly {{referred to as}} Sapma continuous weft patterns and Tigma discontinuous weft patterns in Bhutan.The continuous weft {{patterns are}} very similar to those featured in other textile throughout South and Southeast Asia. The <b>weft</b> <b>yarn</b> is inserted between intervals of the warp yarn to create continuous weft patterns.The discontinuous weft patterns motifs resemble embroidery are indigenous to Bhutan. Colored pattern yarns are knotted individually to the weft yarns to create geometric motifs which are usually combination of multiple pattern motifs.|$|E
5000|$|The loch is {{recorded}} in 1604-1608 as being {{well known to}} many weavers in the neighbourhood due to the abundance of reeds that grew there {{and the fact that}} they were used for making pirns. In 1874 it {{is recorded}} that the loch margin had an edging of water-lilies (Nymphaea species). A pirn was a weaver’s spool for holding his <b>weft</b> <b>yarn</b> in the shuttle, originally made from a quill or hollow reed, in later times they were made from wood.|$|E
50|$|The fibre used to {{make the}} fabric is {{traditionally}} worsted wool, but may also be cotton, texturised polyester, or a blend. Gabardine is woven as a warp-faced steep or regular twill, with a prominent diagonal rib on the face and smooth surface on the back. Gabardine always has many more warp than <b>weft</b> <b>yarns.</b>|$|R
30|$|Skewness is a known fabric defect {{which occurs}} in both woven and {{knitting}} fabrics. Skewness is created when {{the pattern is}} distorted across the fabric width. In other words, it is a condition resulting when <b>weft</b> <b>yarns</b> are angularly displaced from a line perpendicular to the fabric selvage, usually, due to uneven distribution of tension (ASTM-International 2006; Lee 1989).|$|R

The selvedge is very damaged. The <b>weft</b> <b>yarns</b> along the edge are all broken so {{it is impossible to}} be sure how many ribs there were...|$|R
50|$|A reed {{is part of}} a loom, and {{resembles a}} comb. It is used to push the <b>weft</b> <b>yarn</b> {{securely}} into place as it is woven, it also separates the warp threads and holds them in their positions, keeping them untangled, and guides the shuttle as it moves across the loom. It consists of a frame with lots of vertical slits. The reed is securely held by the beater. Floor looms and mechanized looms both use a beater with a reed, whereas Inkle weaving and tablet weaving do not use reeds.|$|E
5000|$|When {{the end of}} a color {{boundary}} is reached, the <b>weft</b> <b>yarn</b> {{is wound}} back from the boundary point. Thus, if the boundary of a field is a straight vertical line, a vertical slit forms between the two different color areas where they meet. For this reason, most kilims can be classed as [...] "slit woven" [...] textiles. The slits are beloved by collectors, as they produce very sharp-etched designs, emphasizing the geometry of the weave. Weaving strategies for avoiding slit formation, such as interlocking, produce a more blurred design image.|$|E
50|$|The {{housing for}} the rapiers must take up as much space as {{the width of the}} machine. To {{overcome}} this problem, looms with flexible rapiers have been devised. The flexible rapier can be coiled as it is withdrawn, therefore requiring less storage space. If, however, the rapier is too stiff then it will not coil; If it is too flexible, it will buckle. Rigid and flexible rapier machines operate at speeds ranging from about 200 to 260 ppm, using up to 1,300 metres of <b>weft</b> <b>yarn</b> every minute. They have a noise level similar to that of modern projectile looms. They can produce a wide variety of fabrics ranging from muslin to drapery and upholstery materials.|$|E
