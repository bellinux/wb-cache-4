The 1927 Nordic, 1941 Nordic and 1941 Alpine World Skiing Championships were held in Cortina as well, although the 1941 Nordic championships were withdrawn by the FIS in 1946.

5|$|Canada {{launched}} several bids to {{host the}} <b>Winter</b> <b>Olympics</b> in Banff, with the first bid for the 1964 <b>Winter</b> <b>Olympics,</b> which were eventually awarded to Innsbruck, Austria. Canada narrowly lost a second bid, for the 1968 <b>Winter</b> <b>Olympics,</b> which were awarded to Grenoble, France. Once again, Banff launched a bid {{to host the}} 1972 <b>Winter</b> <b>Olympics,</b> with plans to hold the Olympics at Lake Louise. The 1972 bid was controversial, as environmental lobby groups strongly opposed the bid, which had sponsorship from Imperial Oil. Bowing to pressure, Jean Chrétien, then the Minister of Environment, the government department responsible for Parks Canada, withdrew support for the bid, which was eventually lost to Sapporo, Japan. When nearby Calgary hosted the 1988 <b>Winter</b> <b>Olympics,</b> the cross-country ski events were held at the Canmore Nordic Centre Provincial Park at Canmore, Alberta, located just outside the eastern gates of Banff National Park on the Trans-Canada Highway.|$|E
5|$|During {{the process}} of the Lillehammer bid for the 1992 <b>Winter</b> <b>Olympics,</b> the International Olympic Committee had not {{specified}} that it was necessary with an indoor speed skating rink. Calgary had used the indoor Olympic Oval during the 1988 <b>Winter</b> <b>Olympics,</b> but Albertville, who were awarded the 1992 <b>Winter</b> <b>Olympics,</b> had opted for the outdoor L'anneau de vitesse. In its bid, the speed skating events were planned held at Stampesletta, an outdoor track and field stadium in Lillehammer. Only after Lillehammer had been awarded the 1994 <b>Winter</b> <b>Olympics</b> was it decided that an indoor venue would have to be built for the games.|$|E

5|$|Freestyle {{skiing is}} one of the six skiing {{disciplines}} contested at the Winter Olympic Games, and one of the youngest. In 1924, the first <b>Winter</b> <b>Olympics</b> featured Nordic skiing disciplines (cross-country skiing, ski jumping, and Nordic combined), while alpine skiing was first contested in 1936. Only at the 1992 <b>Winter</b> <b>Olympics,</b> in Albertville, France, were freestyle skiing events first held as official medal events. Before that, freestyle skiing was contested at the 1988 <b>Winter</b> <b>Olympics</b> as a demonstration sport, consisting of events {{for both men and women}} in three variants: moguls, aerials and ski ballet. In Albertville, moguls was the first-ever official freestyle skiing medal event; aerials and ski ballet were also held but still as demonstration events. The growing popularity of aerials convinced the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to add this freestyle discipline to the 1994 <b>Winter</b> <b>Olympics</b> official program. Moguls and aerials have thus been contested at every Winter Games since. Ski cross inclusion in the <b>Winter</b> <b>Olympics</b> program was approved at an IOC Executive Board meeting in November 2006, and the first events were held at the 2010 <b>Winter</b> <b>Olympics.</b>|$|E
5|$|Kenya first {{competed in}} the Summer Olympics at the 1956 Games in Melbourne, Australia.

5|$|Skeleton {{is one of}} the Olympic sport {{disciplines}} contested at the Winter Olympic Games. It {{was introduced}} at the 1928 <b>Winter</b> <b>Olympics</b> in St. Moritz – the birthplace of skeleton – {{in the form of a}} men's event contested over four runs. Dropped from the 1932 and 1936 <b>Winter</b> <b>Olympics</b> program, skeleton returned in 1948, when St. Moritz hosted again the <b>Winter</b> <b>Olympics,</b> but was discarded from the following Games in Oslo. After 54 years of absence from the Olympic program, skeleton was reinstated as an official medal sport at the 2002 <b>Winter</b> <b>Olympics</b> in Salt Lake City, featuring individual events for men and women.|$|E
5|$|The 1992 <b>Winter</b> <b>Olympics</b> {{were the}} last Winter Games to be run before the {{introduction}} of more strenuous qualification standards.
