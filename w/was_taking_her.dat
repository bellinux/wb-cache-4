5|$|The plaintiff, Helen Palsgraf, <b>was</b> <b>taking</b> <b>her</b> {{daughters to}} the beach in August 1924. As two men {{attempted}} to board a train before hers, one (aided by railroad employees) dropped a package that exploded, causing a large coin-operated scale on the platform to hit her. After the incident, she began to stammer, and subsequently sued the railroad, arguing that its employees had been negligent while assisting the man, {{and that she had}} been harmed by the neglect. In May 1927 she obtained a jury verdict of $6,000, which the railroad appealed. Palsgraf gained a 3–2 decision in the Appellate Division, and the railroad appealed again. Cardozo wrote for a 4–3 majority of the Court of Appeals, ruling that there was no negligence because the employees, in helping the man board, did not have a duty of care to Palsgraf as injury to her was not a foreseeable harm from aiding a man with a package. The original jury verdict was overturned, and the railroad won the case.|$|E
5|$|Sunday, August 24, 1924, was a {{warm summer}} day in Brooklyn, and Helen Palsgraf, a 40-year-old janitor and housekeeper, <b>was</b> <b>taking</b> <b>her</b> two daughters, Elizabeth and Lillian, aged 15 and 12, to Rockaway Beach. Having paid the {{necessary}} fare, {{they were on the}} platform at the East New York station of the LIRR on Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn, when a train, not theirs, pulled in. As it began to move again, two men raced for the train, and one made it without incident, as the doors had not closed. The other, a man carrying a package, leapt aboard, {{with the help of a}} platform guard pushing him from behind as a member of the train's crew pulled him into the car. But in the process, the man lost the package, which dropped and exploded, for it apparently contained fireworks. Either the force of the explosion or the panicking of those on the platform caused a tall, coin-operated scale to topple onto Helen Palsgraf. No one was hurt enough to spend the night in the hospital, though several people, Palsgraf among them, were listed as injured.|$|E

[...] It did so during a scene in the film just as Heidi's paralyzed cousin Clara <b>was</b> <b>taking</b> <b>her</b> first, slow steps. According to sportswriter Jack Clary, [...] "The football fans were indignant when they saw what they had missed. The Heidi audience was peeved at having an ambulatory football score intrude on one of the story's more touching moments. Short of pre-empting Heidi for a skin flick, NBC could not have managed to alienate more viewers that evening." ...|$|E

500|$|While {{collaborating with}} The Flaming Lips on their {{remake of the}} Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, Cyrus began working with Wayne Coyne on her fifth studio album. She claimed that she <b>was</b> <b>taking</b> <b>her</b> time {{to focus on the}} music, and that the album would not be {{released}} until she felt it was ready. Coyne compared his collaborative material with Cyrus to the catalogs of Pink Floyd and Portishead, and described their sound as being [...] "a slightly wiser, sadder, more true version" [...] of Cyrus' pop music output. During most of the time she was recording of the album, she was in a romantic relationship with actor Patrick Schwarzenegger. Cyrus also worked on the films The Night Before (2015) and A Very Murray Christmas (2015) during this period; both roles were cameos. Reports began to surface in 2015 that Cyrus was working on two albums simultaneously, one of which she hoped to release at no charge. This was confirmed by her manager who claimed she was willing to end her contract with RCA Records if they refused to let her release a free album. Cyrus was the host of the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards, and gave a surprise performance of a new song [...] "Dooo It!" [...] (2015) during the show's finale. Immediately following the performance, Cyrus announced that her fifth studio album, Miley Cyrus & Her Dead Petz (2015), was available for free streaming on SoundCloud. The album was written and produced primarily by Cyrus, and has been called experimental and psychedelic, with elements of psychedelic pop, psychedelic rock, and alternative pop.|$|E

They are unable to keep {{themselves}} entertained and take their frustrations out on Meg as usual. But, having dealt with their abuse for years, Meg finally turns on them, starting with Chris for mistreating her with hurtful comments. Tired of her outburst, Lois tries to tell Meg that she is simply taking her own problems out on everyone else, but Meg brings up Lois's past and tells her that she is [...] "the furthest thing from" [...] the perfect mother. Meg also informs Lois that when she turns eighteen, she is considering never seeing her again. Lois is reduced to tears and profusely apologizes to Meg. Meg then confronts Peter who, unable to comprehend her insults, thinks that his daughter's argument is amusing until she calls him a [...] "waste of a man." [...] Within moments, Peter, Lois and Chris turn their abusive criticisms on each other. Peter then runs away to his room crying, leaving Meg and Brian to discuss what just happened. Despite Brian complimenting her for standing up for herself, Meg concludes that her family cannot survive without a [...] "lightning rod" [...] to absorb its dysfunction, and that her enduring her family's antagonism helps keep them together. She then decides to apologize to her family and lies that she <b>was</b> <b>taking</b> <b>her</b> own problems out on everyone, restoring their egos and original opinions. Stewie then breaks the fourth wall by telling the audience about the dangers of drugs: [...] "Tonight's Family Guy was a very special episode about drug use, but the simple fact is, it's no laughing matter. To learn more about drugs, visit your local library. There's probably a guy behind there who sells drugs." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sylvia Plath's {{most famous}} book of poetry is called Ariel. It is named so because she {{considered}} the poem {{to be the}} best in the book. Many readers know that the title of the poem was changed to [...] "The Horse" [...] for the less discerning newspaper readers and think the poem Ariel is simply about her riding a wild horse. Others, however, such as , consider Plath's earlier childhood fascination with The Tempest's character Ariel and view the poem as talking about creativity and the dangerous direction her creativity <b>was</b> <b>taking</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E

2500|$|All was {{not going}} well at this point. Mathieu said [...] "I was managed to such mimicry of my idol that I thought I {{was not able to}} do {{anything}} else. It was instantly one of the biggest disappointments of my life." [...] Stark then abandoned the Piaf direction he <b>was</b> <b>taking</b> <b>her.</b> The Olympia performance convinced a skeptical Paul Mauriat to work with Mireille, and songwriter André Pascal joined forces to develop her into a successful act. Together they wrote new modern material for her: Mon crédo, Viens dans ma rue, La première étoile and many other hit songs. Her first album En Direct de L'Olympia, on the Barclay label, was released in 1966. Highly acclaimed, along with the singles and EP's from it, the album made her a star outside France.|$|E

Subsequently Borel injured an elderly woman who was walking in the streets {{with her husband and}} shot and wounded two brothers who were crossing his path. The shots he fired at Rodolphe Incorvala, once again {{through an open}} window, were eventually lethal. He later died in a hospital.

2500|$|In {{the spring}} of 2005, Bright {{received}} a call from Joe Galante, chairman of Sony BMG Nashville, when Galante was meeting with Clive Davis. They called Bright to see if he would be interested in producing that year’s American Idol winner, Carrie Underwood. Bright had seen Underwood on the show, but never dreamed that he would ever have an opportunity to be her producer. Galante said [...] "I want you to meet her — if she likes you, you'll make a record". [...] Bright flew to Kansas City with Galante to meet Underwood. Two weeks later, Bright and Underwood were in the studio making Some Hearts. [...] Bright was unaware that a battle had ensued because Clive Davis wanted another producer, but Galante wanted Bright. Underwood liked Bright, and they developed a good working relationship. She said of Bright, [...] "He'll say [...] 'try something different there' [...] but he doesn't tell me how to sing". [...] Bright was given one month to produce her first album from beginning to end. At the time, Underwood was on the road with the American Idol Tour, so Bright had to go to wherever she <b>was,</b> <b>taking</b> <b>her</b> microphone and special equipment to local studios in San Francisco and Seattle to finish her vocal tracks. Davis wanted to hedge his bet on Underwood by having her album include pop as well as county songs, but Underwood did not like the pop material. Davis insisted that production of the album be split to where Dann Huff produced the pop songs, and Bright did the country. [...] The final product, Some Hearts, released in 2005, won three Grammy Awards and Underwood won a Grammy for Best New Artist. The album became the best-selling solo female debut album in country music history and as of 2016, had sold 8 million copies. He also produced Underwood’s NBC Sunday Night Football intro/theme songs. The first was [...] "Waiting all day for Sunday night" [...] which was replaced in 2016 using a new tune based on Underwood's country song [...] "Somethin' Bad", but with new lyrics and other changes to fit the show.|$|E
