40|$|Concerns {{regarding}} {{adult literacy}} {{have been a}} common feature in UK educational policy and in the media {{since at least the}} 1970 s, with a series of initiatives aimed at improving adults’ literacy skills. Previous research has explored these initiatives, identifying a range of attitudes towards and perceptions of adult literacy. For some, literacy is about social justice and the easing of poverty (Hamilton and Hillier, 2006). For others, it is linked to prosperity and economic success, both of the individual and of the nation as a <b>whole.</b> <b>Notions</b> of what actually constitutes literacy have differed over time, ranging from simply having the ability to sign one’s name (Gardner, 2004) or {{to be able to read}} and write with confidence, to the decoding of icons and the manipulation of documents in electronic formats. (Smith, 2005). Other writers have acknowledged a more diverse concept of ‘literacies’ recognising a broader range of forms literacy might take (Mannion et. al., 2007). My interest in what it means to be literate has grown out of this earlier work, and through analysis of policy documents and interviews with literacy teachers and learners, my doctoral research aims to investigate how literacy is currently perceived and conceptualised by teachers, learners and policy-makers within adult literacy education in England, and to identify the factors that influence these perceptions. Early analysis of the data has identified a fairly rigid discourse of employability and functionality within current literacy education policy compared to a much more diverse response from practitioners and learners. Interview data, while acknowledging the link between literacy and employment and the ability to function in everyday life, present a broad range of issues such as independence, autonomy, empowerment, social inclusion and the development of critical awareness as factors involved in literacy. Relationships between literacy and technology, along with literacy and numeracy have also been acknowledged by interview participants...|$|R

The various responses to this crisis of baselines will to a significant extent determine the future direction of nature conservation.

If Adonis was connected with the fall of leaves in autumn and the return of flowers in spring, the process of thought was quite different. It is a process of thought which springs up spontaneously in all children and young artists; it springs up spontaneously in all healthy societies.

I persist in the belief that, though a refuse of the persecuted and from neglect degenerating Jew-Christians may have sunk into the mean and carnal notions of their unconverted brethren respecting the Messiah, no proper sect of Ebionites ever existed, but those to whom St. Paul travelled with the contributions of the churches, nor any such man as Ebion; unless indeed it was St. Barnabas, who in his humility may have so named himself, while soliciting relief for the distressed Palestine Christians;--"I am Barnabas the beggar." [...] But I will go further, and confess my belief that the (so-called) Ebionites of the first and second centuries, who rejected the 'Christopædia', and whose Gospel commenced with the baptism by John, were orthodox Apostolic Christians, who received Christ as the Lord, that is, as Jehovah 'manifested in the flesh'. As to their rejection of the other Gospels and of Paul's writings, I might ask:--"Could they read them?"

I let him have his funeral, though I object to funerals and to the practice of sepulture. I consented to a monument, although there is, to me, no more bitterly ridiculous outcome of human vanity than the blocks raised to tell posterity that John Smith, or Jane Jackson, late of this parish, was born, lived, and died worth enough money to pay a mason to distinguish their bones from those of the unrecorded millions. To gratify Jansenius I waived this objection, and only interfered to save him from being fleeced and fooled by an unnecessary West End middleman, who, as likely as not, would have eventually employed the very man to whom I gave the job. Even the epitaph was not mine. If I had had my way I should have written: [...] "HENRIETTA JANSENIUS WAS BORN ON SUCH A DATE, MARRIED A MAN NAMED TREFUSIS, AND DIED ON SUCH ANOTHER DATE; AND NOW WHAT DOES IT MATTER WHETHER SHE DID OR NOT?"

40|$|AbstractAs for {{extending}} real-valued continuous functions or continuous pseudometrics on a subspace to the <b>whole</b> space, <b>notions</b> of z -, C∗ -, C -, P - and Pγ -embeddings are known. As {{a cardinal}} generalization of z -embedding, Blair defined in 1985 {{the notion of}} zγ -embedding with γ≥ω, where zω -embedding coincides with z -embedding. On the other hand, since Pω -embedding equals C -embedding, Pγ -embedding can be also regarded as a cardinal generalization of C -embedding. Recently Ohta asked if a cardinal generalization of C∗ -embedding can be defined so that this property plus Uω -embedding is equal to Pγ -embedding, and it is itself equals C∗ -embedding in case γ=ω. In this paper, we give a cardinal generalization of C∗ -embedding, called (P∗) γ -embedding, and answer this problem. As a characterization of (P∗) γ -embedding, we show that (P∗) γ -embedding naturally admits its description by using continuous maps from a subspace into the hedgehog with γ spines. We also give a new extension-like property called weak zγ -embedding, with which z - (respectively C∗ -, C - or Uω -) embedding equals zγ - (respectively (P∗) γ -, Pγ - or Uγ -) embedding...|$|R
5000|$|In the Ottoman Empire, a millet was a {{separate}} {{court of law}} pertaining to [...] "personal law" [...] under which a confessional community (a group abiding {{by the laws of}} Muslim Sharia, Christian Canon law, or Jewish Halakha) was allowed to rule itself under its own laws. Despite frequently being referred to as a [...] "system", before the nineteenth century the organization of what are now retrospectively called millets in the Ottoman Empire was far from systematic. Rather, non-Muslims were simply given a significant degree of autonomy within their own community, without an overarching structure for the 'millet' as a <b>whole.</b> The <b>notion</b> of distinct millets corresponding to different religious communities within the empire would not emerge until the eighteenth century. Subsequently, the existence of the millet system was justified through numerous foundation myths linking it back to the time of Sultan Mehmed II (r. 1451-81), although it is now understood that no such system existed in the fifteenth century. After the Ottoman Tanzimat (1839-76) reforms, the term was used for legally protected religious minority groups, similar to the way other countries use the word nation. The word millet comes from the Arabic word millah (ملة) and literally means [...] "nation". The millet system has been called an example of pre-modern religious pluralism.|$|R
40|$|This study (Ethical {{contradictions in}} the social {{responsibilities}} in librarianship/library science) intends to be a critical analysis of some ethical contradictions even in the same ethics and {{in the social}} responsabilities {{in the field of}} librarianship/library science. It shows evidences {{on the fact that the}} professionals of the documental information (PDIs, included librarians) which works were analized that they only show an analysis of the ethical phenomenon exclusively from philosophy, or from a social science, or from philosophy and combined with a social science, but in all the cases none of them include an analysis from the natural sciences such as biology or neuropsicology. Such exclusion is considered here as generator of epistemological biases, flaws and fallacies. It is underpinned, according to the evidences and proofs provided from evolutive biology and neuropsychology, that morality cannot be prescribed culturally, but that it is already innate to humans, and to non human primates, and that in such a case that could be prescribed, it should be done so only after people have a more complete, critical and integral understanding of human nature in general and particularly about its moral innate features. To bridge that gap, here it is intended to approach the ethical phenomenon in the social responsabilities from a conceptual analysis of a critical, integral, and evolutionary materialistic type that intends to cover and triangulate in an analytical <b>whole</b> <b>notions</b> of the phenomenon from the humanities (i. e. philosophy, literature); social sciences (i. e. library science, sociology) and natural sciences (i. e. biology, neuropsychology). This analysis not only does not evade the conflicting and contradictory character around this phenomenon like other partialized and aparently "neutral" approaches analysed here, but also puts it in evidence, demystifies it, and puts it in the context in which it is manifested so that by taking it from such material reality, human nature, it could be analysed if it may be possible or not to create prescriptive ethical codes. It also proposes that the PDIs should take social responsibilities towards the political transformation of society looking for the socialization of humankind, for the humanization of society, for the social equality, for justice, for democracy and for civil liberties in favor of the dominated classes and making a common front of resistance along with all the rest of the thinking humanity to the domination of the ruling classes; not as an ethical precept, but as a foundation from the evolution of the human nature where the communal and cooperative features of human life it is found in this study as the most ancient, abundant and determinant in the history of terrestrial life, and human life.
