After her surgery, Liz reassures the dental staff that the anesthesia is having no effect on her and can take herself home. In the lobby, Liz sees her former boyfriends Drew Baird (Jon Hamm), Dennis Duffy (Dean Winters), and Floyd DeBarber (Jason Sudeikis), and is moved that they came back so that she not be alone on Valentine's Day. Liz is hallucinating, however, and the people she sees as Drew, Dennis, and Floyd are actually the three Jamaican women who are dental assistants at the oral surgeon's office. One of them calls Jack, Liz's boss, asking if he could come pick up Liz and take her home. Jack had just spent the night with Avery, <b>who</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> the phone call was made up by Jack as an excuse to end the date, but when he invites her to come along, she is impressed by his kindness to Liz.|$|E

At the end of March, they crossed the Rhine and entered Germany, engaging in dangerous house-to-house, town-after-town fighting to clean out German soldiers; {{during the first week}} of April, they crossed the Kocher River, and by the end of the month reached the Danube. During his time in combat, Benedetto narrowly escaped death several times. The experience made him a pacifist; he would later write, [...] "Anybody <b>who</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> war is romantic obviously hasn't gone through one," [...] and later say, [...] "It was a nightmare that's permanent. I just said, 'This is not life. This is not life.'"

Regarding the theme of homosexuality, Koda said in an interview: [...] "I'm the type of person <b>who</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> [...] it doesn't matter what sex the other person is. No matter who they are, it doesn't change the 'I love this person' feeling, does it?" [...] The video for [...] "Taboo" [...] portrayed homosexuality and other [...] "taboo" [...] subjects to deliver Koda's message of [...] "there really {{is no such thing as}} a taboo". [...] She also said of [...] "Taboo"'s themes, [...] "Instead of trying stuff out and experiencing it, we put up a 'No' sign, we never try to break the taboos" [...] and [...] "Sometimes we shouldn't retreat into safety, we should have courage to do things. Those are the feelings kin the song." [...] Such themes are also present in her music videos: she has incorporated her [...] "sexy" [...] image into her videos since [...] "Crazy 4 U" [...] through sexually charged dances and skin-baring outfits.

500|$|Tesla never married, {{explaining}} that his chastity was {{very helpful to}} his scientific abilities. He once said in earlier years that he felt he could never be worthy enough for a woman, considering women superior in every way. His opinion had started to sway in later years when he felt that women were trying to outdo men and make themselves more dominant. This [...] "new woman" [...] was met with much indignation from Tesla, who felt that women were losing their femininity by trying to be in power. In {{an interview with the}} Galveston Daily News on 10 August 1924 he stated, [...] "In place of the soft voiced, gentle woman of my reverent worship, has come the woman <b>who</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> her chief success in life lies in making herself as much as possible like man—in dress, voice and actions, in sports and achievements of every kind... The tendency of women to push aside man, supplanting the old spirit of cooperation with him in all the affairs of life, is very disappointing to me". Although he told a reporter in later years that he sometimes felt that by not marrying, he had made too great a sacrifice to his work, Tesla chose to never pursue or engage in any known relationships, instead finding all the stimulation he needed in his work.|$|E
500|$|The human lineage that {{remained}} in Africa eventually evolved into anatomically modern humans with modern-sized brains by about 200,000 years ago, and became common about 100,000 years ago, {{but did not}} become behaviourally modern until about 50,000 years ago. Citing the paleoanthropologist Richard Klein, Wade posits that such a great change must have been because of a neurological change, and was therefore genetic. This [...] "genetic revolution", as Wade calls it, facilitated the emergence of language and thus the ability to share thoughts and innovations. Wade discusses the evolutionary origins of language in chapter three, First Words. He references Noam Chomsky's theory of [...] "universal grammar" [...] – a term that refers to both the hard-wiring {{of the brain that}} allows children to learn grammatical rules, and the underlying grammatical similarities of all human languages. Wade cites a number of evolutionary psychologists for an explanation, including Robin Dunbar, who argues that language evolved because it was a more efficient way of establishing social bonds than grooming; Geoffrey Miller, who suggests that speech was a signal of intelligence and thus evolved through sexual selection; and Steven Pinker, <b>who</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> the ecological niche of humans required the sharing of knowledge. Wade writes that the genetic basis of language is linked to the FOXP2 gene, as it shows signs of significant change in humans but not in chimpanzees, and that mutations of it cause severe speech disorders.|$|E
