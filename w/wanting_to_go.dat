Sean wakes up and tells them about the hunting paraphernalia, crying about <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> home before he dies. Wes and Lauren turn the Jeep right side up, load him back in the car, then push the Jeep down the hilly road as a thunderstorm hits. Using the downward momentum and occasionally pushing, they arrive near the buildings. While Lauren is exploring the building with the trap, the bear swings at her through a window sending her back against the trap, which impales her back. She returns to the vehicle where the bear rips off the tailgate and drags away Sean's body.|$|E
5|$|Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) brings Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) {{along to}} a dinner party hosted by his friend Gavin Volure (Steve Martin). Gavin becomes {{intrigued}} by Liz and invites her to spend the weekend with him, which she accepts. She wonders how the relationship between them will work, as he is agoraphobic. Gavin explains his daily routines to Liz, and also discloses that due to his phobias, he cannot be intimate with women. Liz starts to think that maybe a relationship with Gavin could work. As Liz gets ready to leave, Gavin admits {{to her that he}} is not agoraphobic, and that he is under house arrest for arson, fraud, embezzlement, and racketeering. This shocks Liz, and when she returns to New York, she tells Jack about it. Jack feels awful for investing NBC page Kenneth Parcell's (Jack McBrayer) money with Gavin, after Gavin told him he was forming a new company and interested Jack to be part of it. Later, Gavin escapes from house arrest and shows up at the 30 Rock studios. There, he tells Liz that {{he was on his way}} to the Canada–US border but came back to bring her with him. After Liz refuses to go with him, and not <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to prison, Gavin climbs to the top of the TGS with Tracy Jordan set and threatens to jump. Jack tries to talk Gavin out of jumping, distracting him in the process, resulting in Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) tackling Gavin down.|$|E

The story explored the reaction from Westview residents, most notably anti-LBGT activist and head of the Senior Prom parent volunteers Roberta Blackburn, who launches an effort to stop the couple from attending the prom by forming a protest outside the school. When a group of students led by Summer Moore supporting LBGT couples attending the prom plan a counter-protest, principal Nate Green defuses the situation by calling a school assembly and announces that gay couples will be allowed to attend the prom, and that he will not have intolerance at Westview High School be a policy issue during his tenure.|$|E
25|$|Modifications of the {{above-ground}} Artery {{which was}} in service until its demolition in 2003 included an additional interchange for the Massachusetts Turnpike (Mass Pike) extension which was completed in 1965, the removal of several on and off-ramps and the reworking in the late 1980s of the Tobin Bridge interchange. The Central Artery North Area (CANA) project placed the above ground ramps from the Artery underground into the City Square Tunnel in Charlestown and resulted in a reworking of the interchange at the north end, placing the northbound offramp from the east side to the west side, and eliminating dangerous weaving across the lanes of the Charlestown High Bridge which required traffic coming from Storrow Drive and <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to Charlestown to cross three lanes of traffic in only {{a tenth of a}} mile.|$|E

25|$|Decatur came to {{love the}} sea and sailing in a {{roundabout}} manner. When Stephen was eight years old, he developed a severe case of whooping cough.

It was decided that Stephen Jr. would accompany his father aboard a merchant ship on his next voyage to Europe.

In the days following young Stephen's return he was jubilant about his adventure on the high sea and spoke of <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> sailing often. His parents had different aspirations, especially his mother who had hopes that Stephen would one day become an Episcopal clergyman, and tried to discourage the eight-year-old from such jaunty ambitions, fearing such would distract Stephen from his studies.|$|E
25|$|In the Town of Poughkeepsie, {{just after}} the {{northern}} terminus of NY9D, 9 passes another distressed mall, South Hills and its healthier, newer counterpart, the Poughkeepsie Galleria. A mile further north, NY113 swings to the west at a cloverleaf interchange near the IBM plant, once the region's major employer. Entering the city of Poughkeepsie, at Sharon Drive, 9 returns to expressway status once again. Two miles (3.2km) north of Sharon, the highway connects to the US44/NY55 concurrency at an interchange {{in close proximity to}} the Mid-Hudson Bridge. This creates some unusual left exits, as traffic from 44/55 east <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> north on 9 is routed into a U-turn south of the highway, and likewise northbound drivers on 9 must get turned around to go west over the river. The limited-access highway comes to an end at the intersection with NY9G near Marist College.|$|E

As he is leaving Husk apologizes to him for being unable to remember what happened between them, he claims he knew it was too good to last. Before he leaves she arranges a date at a local coffee shop, but the city is attacked by self-replicating energy bots built by Maximilian Frankenstein so he and Manuel Endque could escape the Grey Academy. The X-Men defeat the robots, and half the coffee shop has been destroyed. Endque was found by the X-Men having been severely beaten by Toad on Frankenstein's orders, Toad seemingly now working for Frankenstein, <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> someplace nobody can hurt them. Endque passes on a message to Husk that Toad left because he knew even if things went well between them one day she'd wake up and see him for what he really was. Husk breaks down in tears.|$|E

Returning to the present, they find the culprit, Yuki, who had borrowed Haruhi's power to change everyone's memories except Kyon's, giving him the choice of which world he would rather live in. Kyon questions himself about his choice and thinks to himself that a normal world without the SOS Brigade and Haruhi Suzumiya would be calm and peaceful and thinks Yuki was tired of everything she had to do like monitoring Haruhi's behavior and protecting Kyon, but finally decides that his original world was more interesting and fun. Kyon tries to install the program into Yuki but is stabbed by Ryoko, who had retained her psychotic behavior. Before Ryoko can finish him off, he is rescued by future counterparts of Yuki, Mikuru and himself. He wakes up a few days later in a hospital, where the world is back to normal, but almost everyone believes Kyon had been in a coma since December 18 after falling down the stairs. When Yuki mentions to Kyon how the Data Integration Thought Entity would punish her for her actions, Kyon tells her to let them know that if they ever try such a thing, he can tell Haruhi about him being John Smith and have her alter reality so the organization would cease to exist. As December 24 comes and his everyday life returns, Kyon decides there is still time before he has to go back in time to save himself and decides to join in on the Christmas party.|$|E

500|$|The {{producers}} {{learned from}} an ex-MI5 officer {{that it is}} common for intelligence gatherers who spend most of their work listening in to other people {{to fall in love with}} civilians through just their voices. This story was the basis of Ruth <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> out with John in [...] "Love and Death". Khoury based [...] "Outsiders" [...] on Internet security. He already became intoned with the area, as he once worked with an internet company. Although the story is dramatised, Khoury did research on what was feasible, such as if one man and a laptop could theoretically bring Britain to its knees. Also in the episode, the G algorithm is based on an actual computer programme. [...] "Frequently Asked Questions" [...] deals with interrogation and torture. Walters realised that torture is counterproductive as the suspects can say anything the interrogators want to hear, but rationalises that Adam is an expert in that field. To get the interrogation as true as possible, the producers consulted with ex-Army advisors who were trained in questioning terror suspects. As the episode was first broadcast, a prison abuse scandal in Iraq was put on the news. In response to this, Kudos director Stephen Garrett stated [...] "Spooks is really well researched and sometimes we look like we're ahead of the game. It's just we know stuff that's happening, and it'll come out in the news a bit later on."
