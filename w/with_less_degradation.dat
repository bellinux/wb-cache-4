We {{have studied the}} molecular mechanisms of invadopodium formation in metastatic carcinoma cells. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor kinase inhibitors blocked invadopodium formation {{in the presence of}} serum, and EGF stimulation of serum-starved cells induced invadopodium formation. RNA interference and dominant-negative mutant expression analyses revealed that neural WASP (N-WASP), Arp 2 / 3 complex, and their upstream regulators, Nck 1, Cdc 42, and WIP, are necessary for invadopodium formation. Time-lapse analysis revealed that invadopodia are formed de novo at the cell periphery and their lifetime varies from minutes to several hours. Invadopodia with short lifetimes are motile, whereas long-lived invadopodia tend to be stationary. Interestingly, suppression of cofilin expression by RNA interference inhibited the formation of long-lived invadopodia, resulting in formation of only short-lived invadopodia <b>with</b> <b>less</b> matrix <b>degradation</b> activity.

Ballast degradation {{is influenced by}} several factors including the amplitude and number of load cycles, gradation of aggregates, track confining pressure, angularity and fracture strength of individual grains. The degraded ballast is usually cleaned on track, otherwise, fully or partially replaced by fresh ballast, depending on the track settlement and current density. The use of composite geosynthetics {{at the bottom of}} recycled ballast layer is highly desirable to serve the functions of both drainage and separation of ballast from subballast. Construction of the rail track also requires appropriate improvement of the subgrade soils to achieve an adequately stiff surface layer prior to placing the ballast and subballast.

To overcome this problem, a combination of Model Predictive Control (MPC) and anadaptive input disturbance predictor is proposed. This combination predicts the wave disturbance force by using a predictive model of the input disturbance and then compensating for the predicted disturbance within the MPC framework. This has the advantages of MPC and the adaptive model, and avoids the complicated robust tuning of a state observer which is commonly used within the MPC framework to reject output disturbances.

Video streaming applications are increasingly being deployed in Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs). However, robust streaming of video over WMNs poses many challenges due to varying nature of wireless networks. Bit-errors, packet-losses and burst-packet-losses are very common in such type of networks, which severely influence the perceived video quality at receiving end. Therefore, a carefully-designed error recovery scheme must be employed. In this paper, we propose an interactive and ubiquitous video streaming scheme for Scalable Video Coding (SVC) based video streaming over WMNs towards heterogeneous receivers. Intelligently taking the benefit of path diversity, the proposed scheme initially calculates the quality of all candidate paths and then based on quality of path it decides adaptively the size and level of error protection for all packets in order to combat the effect of losses on perceived quality of reconstructed video at receiving end.

Extraction of polysomes from expanded leaves required the inclusion of ethyleneglycol-bis(2 -aminoethyl ether) tetraacetic acid (EGTA, a divalent cation chelator with a high affinity for Ca 2 +, Cu 2 +, and Zn 2 +). EGTA also improved isolation of polysomes from unexpanded leaves. Addition of 25 mm Ca 2 +, Cu 2 +, or Zn 2 + to extracts from young leaves precipitated polysomes, and density gradient profiles of polysome preparations from the cation treatments mimicked profiles from expanded leaves which were extracted without EGTA. Polysome precipitation by Ca 2 + was prevented by EGTA. Endogenous Ca 2 + was present in unexpanded leaves in sufficient concentrations (25 mm) to cause some precipitation of polysomes during extraction, and this cation increased by 60 % in expanded leaves. Cu 2 + and Zn 2 + were not present in amounts sufficient to cause polysome precipitation.

My analysis revealed that phytochrome loss results in dramatically reduced biomass production, especially in high order phyABDE mutant that lacks four out of five phytochromes. This is caused, at least partly, by impaired photosynthesis in phytochrome mutants, including reduced chlorophyll level and less CO 2 uptake. Furthermore, cell wall synthesis and protein levels, major dry biomass constituents, are also repressed in phytochrome-depleted plants. Interestingly, these mutants accumulate more daytime sucrose and starch than wild type does, possibly due to their retarded growth in light. Further metabolic profiling reveals that these phytochrome mutants over-accumulate sugars, organic acids and amino acids. The sizable increase in raffinose and proline suggests a possible link to stress tolerance. Indeed, ABA and salt responses are significantly reduced in phytochrome mutants at both seedling and adult stages. These mutants are also more resistant to prolonged darkness, <b>with</b> <b>less</b> chlorophyll <b>degradation</b> in dark and higher survival rates. Collectively, this thesis shows that phytochromes have a novel role in plant resource management, controlling the allocation of resources for growth, switching the metabolism between growth and stress-coping states based on the availability of light from the environment. It brings new interest into phytochrome research in Arabidopsis, suggesting possible application of such knowledge to crop studies in the future...|$|R
