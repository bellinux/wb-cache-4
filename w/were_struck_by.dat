5|$|Although Herod's {{renovation}} of the Second Temple was initiated in late 1st century BCE, excavations beneath the street near the arch revealed three oil lamps of a type common {{in the first century}} CE and 17 identifiable coins, several of which <b>were</b> <b>struck</b> <b>by</b> Valerius Gratus, Roman procurator of Judea, in the year 17/18 CE. This means that the arch and nearby sections of the Western Wall were constructed after this date.|$|E

5|$|In 1831, {{the first}} gold dollar was minted, at the private mint of Christopher Bechtler in North Carolina. Much {{of the gold}} then being {{produced}} in the United States came from the mountains of North Carolina and Georgia, and the dollars and other small gold coins issued by Bechtler circulated through that region, and were now and then seen further away.

It was given to benefit the Civil Rights Congress (CRC), which was funding the defendants' legal expenses. Hundreds lined the roads leaving the performance grounds and threw rocks and bottles at the departing vehicles without interference by the police. Over 140 people suffered injuries, including Potash, whose eyes <b>were</b> <b>struck</b> <b>by</b> glass from a broken windshield. The trial was suspended for two days while Potash recovered from his injuries.|$|E
5|$|On a clear, {{sunny day}} in July 1964, {{a group of}} six boys went {{swimming}} in the Roundout Creek at a park in Rosendale Village.

Two of the boys, Gary Schmitt and Ronald Morelli, died. Ronald Morelli was the son of Albert Morelli, who served as Rosendale's fire chief. Albert Morelli was part of the team that put out the fire at Reid's Village Inn.|$|E
5|$|A {{hurricane}} {{was first}} {{seen by the}} ship Addie Barnes on August19 in the western Atlantic Ocean, about midway between the southeastern Bahamas and Bermuda. It headed northwestward, causing heavy rains and damage to the Outer Banks of North Carolina, but remained offshore. It turned northeastward and made landfall near Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone. Several vessels <b>were</b> <b>struck</b> <b>by</b> the hurricane. The American brig Bainbridge capsized in the storm off Hatteras early on August21 {{with the loss of}} 80lives. The sole survivor was picked up by the South Boston on the evening of August22. The ship American Congress encountered this hurricane on August22 off Georges Bank. On August23, the Minor was wrecked {{on the south side of}} St Paul Island, off the northeastern tip of Nova Scotia. Two ships, including the Ashburton recorded a barometric pressure of , the lowest in relation to the storm.|$|E

5|$|Around an {{hour after}} the start of the race, three {{children}} <b>were</b> <b>struck</b> <b>by</b> car driven by one of the race officials on a side road from Quarter Bridge Road, near the finish line. None sustained serious injuries; two of them had cuts dressed, while the third rushed back to watching the racing. Another, more serious, accident occurred on the Snaefell Mountain Railway, which had been transporting people up the mountain to watch the racing. A tramcar that had been descending the railway had broken down, and a second car had stopped close behind it. A third tram, on rounding the bend above them, was unable to stop in time and collided into the rearmost car, which was then propelled into {{the car in front of}} it. Minor injuries were sustained by some of the passengers, though none were serious.|$|E
5|$|Dazzle's {{effectiveness}} {{was highly}} uncertain {{at the time}} of the First World War, but it was nonetheless adopted both in the UK and North America. In 1918, the Admiralty analysed shipping losses, but was unable to draw clear conclusions. Dazzle ships were attacked in 1.47% of sailings, compared to 1.12% for uncamouflaged ships, suggesting increased visibility, but as Wilkinson had argued, dazzle was not attempting to make ships hard to see. Suggestively, of the ships that <b>were</b> <b>struck</b> <b>by</b> torpedoes, 43% of the dazzle ships sank, compared to 54% of the uncamouflaged; and similarly, 41% of the dazzle ships were struck amidships, compared to 52% of the uncamouflaged. These comparisons could be taken to imply that submarine commanders did have more difficulty in deciding where a ship was heading and where to aim. However, the ships painted in dazzle were larger than the uncamouflaged ships, 38% of them being over 5000 tons compared to only 13% of uncamouflaged ships, making comparisons unreliable.|$|E
5|$|In 1965, Robert McSpadden and Bill Dickinson, both music {{teachers}} in the Cincinnati Public Schools, founded the Cincinnati All-City Boy Choir, where they <b>were</b> <b>struck</b> <b>by</b> how the discipline they established for {{the boys in the}} choir carried over into their academic studies. They conceived the idea of a school where basic education was combined with intensive attention to children with artistic talents. With the support of Waldrip and Tom Murray, director for the west-central division of Cincinnati elementary schools, they pushed for $119,000 as part of a tax levy referendum in May 1973; the measure was defeated. The school was approved with a drastically reduced budget of $27,000 plus $9,850 from the Board of Education’s general fund. They turned to private funding and won a $292,000 grant from J. Ralph Corbett, one of the city's foremost philanthropists for the arts, and $24,500 for a piano lab from the Baldwin Piano Company, which had manufactured pianos in Cincinnati since 1891.|$|E

50|$|Some {{people believe}} that, for various reasons, large cities cannot <b>be</b> <b>struck</b> <b>by</b> tornadoes. More than 100 tornadoes have struck {{downtown}} areas of large cities in recorded history.

5|$|Near Channel Point, the cyclone {{brought a}} storm surge of , barely surpassing the highest astronomical tide {{in a few}} areas. In some cases, waves over topped sand dunes but no damage took place. Roughly 10-15% of trees in open areas were snapped or uprooted by high winds. Only two {{structures}} sustained direct wind damage while several others <b>were</b> <b>struck</b> <b>by</b> downed trees. Damage was more widespread in Darwin where roughly 15,000 homes, 60% of the city's residences, were left without power. Approximately 1,500 trees were downed in the city, falling on roads, homes and power lines. In the days following the storm's passage, the Adelaide and Katherine rivers continued to rise, of which the former exceeded minor flood levels. In the harbour, seven vessels washed ashore, each sustaining minor damage. Losses caused by the storm was placed at A$1.3million (US$1.1million).|$|E
5|$|On September 1 and 2, Florida Power Company {{received}} {{help from}} Gulf Coast companies to return power to 170,000 customers before the assisting companies' home areas <b>were</b> <b>struck</b> <b>by</b> the hurricane. Power was restored to most areas by September 4, with an exception being St. George's Island; service {{was expected to}} be restored after several additional days. More broadly, owners of heavily damaged homes in the state faced new regulations on coastal construction in the state, which went into effect {{less than a month after}} the storm. The new rules entailed more rigorous study of factors such as a property's prior history and surrounding buildings before approval to rebuild a demolished structure would be granted. Governor Graham preliminarily advised that houses more than halfway destroyed not be rebuilt. Recovery efforts after Hurricane Elena continued to a small degree for years after its passage; for example, beach replenishment at Indian Rocks Beach in Pinellas County began in the summer of 1990.|$|E
5|$|On the Allied right, Eugene's Prussian and Danish {{forces were}} desperately {{fighting}} the numerically superior {{forces of the}} Elector and Marsin. The Prince of Anhalt-Dessau led forward four brigades across the Nebel to assault the well-fortified position of Lutzingen. Here, the Nebel was less of an obstacle, but the great battery positioned {{on the edge of}} the village enjoyed a good field of fire across the open ground stretching to the hamlet of Schwennenbach. As soon as the infantry crossed the stream, they <b>were</b> <b>struck</b> <b>by</b> Maffei's infantry, and salvoes from the Bavarian guns positioned both in front of the village and in enfilade on the wood-line to the right. Despite heavy casualties the Prussians attempted to storm the great battery, whilst the Danes, under Count Scholten, attempted to drive the French infantry out of the copses beyond the village.|$|E

5|$|Originally, the Crusaders {{intended}} {{to relieve the}} beleaguered Christian stronghold of Acre, but Louis had been diverted to Tunis. The French King and his brother Charles of Anjou, who had made himself King of Sicily, decided to attack the emirate to establish a stronghold in North Africa. The plans failed when the French forces <b>were</b> <b>struck</b> <b>by</b> an epidemic which, on 25August, took the life of King Louis himself. By the time Edward arrived at Tunis, Charles had already signed a treaty with the emir, and there was little else to do but return to Sicily. The crusade was postponed until next spring, but a devastating storm {{off the coast of}} Sicily dissuaded Charles of Anjou and Louis's successor Philip III from any further campaigning. Edward decided to continue alone, and on 9May 1271he finally landed at Acre.|$|E
5|$|A {{dispatch}} {{from the}} Associated Press to Mexico City reported that 20,000 citizens from villages in Durango, Sinaloa, Nayarit, and Jalisco evacuated {{due to the}} threat of flooding and high winds from Naomi. The damage from Naomi in Mexico was moderate, although no monetary figures have ever been released. The Associated Press dispatch also reported that Naomi was responsible for knocking out communications over a large area in Mazatlán as well as downing power lines and damaging houses. At least 2000 people were reported homeless in Durango due to the hurricane. The hurricane also caused damage to Highway 15 between Mazatlán and Tepic. Although the highway reopened soon afterward, some areas that <b>were</b> <b>struck</b> <b>by</b> the hurricane were still rough. Naomi's most notable impact in Mexico involved the Lázaro Cárdenas Dam on the Nazas River, which was not complete by the time the hurricane hit. The dam, upriver from Gómez Palacio and Torreón, was feared to break down from the water being built up behind it, influenced by the hurricane. The two options were to either open the dam, saving Torreón by inundating Gómez Palacio, or risk inundating both towns by keeping the dam closed. The decision was made harder by the fact that, if the dam was released and no rain fell to refill the basin behind the dam, the farms would have insufficient water for agricultural growth. Photography from the Environmental Science Services Administration's Automatic Picture Transmission based on the ESSA-6 weather satellite showed that the clouds from Naomi responsible for the rain had almost moved over the area near the dam. Based on the images, the authorities decided to gamble on the dam to successfully hold up, and it managed to hold back the waters without breaking. The hurricane caused four drowning deaths and $16 million in damage in Sinaloa.|$|E
5|$|Alarmed by {{the actions}} of the Temeraires crew, Campbell met with Vice-Admiral Sir Andrew Mitchell the {{following}} day and informed him of the mutineers' demands. Mitchell reported the news to the Admiralty while Campbell returned to Temeraire and summoned the crew on deck once more. He urged them to return to duty, and then dismissed them. Meanwhile, discipline had begun to break down among the mutineers. Several of the crew became drunk, and some of the officers <b>were</b> <b>struck</b> <b>by</b> rowdy seamen. When one of the marines who supported the mutiny was placed in irons for drunken behaviour and insolence, a crowd formed on deck and tried to free him. The officers resisted these attempts and as sailors began to push and threaten them, Campbell gave the order for the marines to arrest those he identified as the ringleaders. The marines hesitated, but then obeyed the order, driving the unruly seamen back and arresting a number of them, who were immediately placed in irons. Campbell ordered the remaining crew to abandon any mutinous actions, and deprived of its leaders, the mutiny collapsed, though the officers were on their guard for several days afterwards and the marines were ordered to carry out continuous patrols.|$|E
