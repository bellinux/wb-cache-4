5|$|Theobald {{called a}} church council at London in June 1160, which dealt partly {{with the issues}} of the papal schism; his health was poor and he had to be taken to the council in a litter. A further cause of {{distress}} to Theobald <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> saw as the ingratitude of Becket, who did not visit the ailing archbishop.|$|E
5|$|Chris sets up {{a camera}} in his room to capture the creature. When he reviews the tape he finds no {{evidence}} of the Evil Monkey, and goes ahead with his plans on capturing him. The family is taken aback when Chris proves it is real by capturing the monkey, and showing it to them, but he turns {{out not to be}} evil after all. The monkey then explains himself to the Griffins for being here. He reveals that he got home from work one day and caught his wife cheating on him with another monkey. He went through a deep depression after the divorce, which costed him his job, and all his money was gone, meaning that he lost his house, so he moved into Chris's closet just until he finally got back on his feet, and has lived there for 9 years. He also reveals that the face he makes at Chris <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> makes when thinking, and he was really trying to talk with Chris this whole time (pointing at him was his only way of trying to start a conversation with him). In addition, the trembling was due to a copper deficiency. The monkey apologizes to Chris for unintentionally terrorizing him and wishes to start over. Chris is at first unconvinced, but when the monkey helps him write a book report, he is surprised to receive a passing grade, and the two become great friends.|$|E

25|$|One of the {{elements}} that Winnicott considered could be lost in childhood <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> called {{the sense of being}} for him, a primary element, of which a sense of doing is only a derivative. The capacity for being the ability to feel genuinely alive inside, which Winnicott saw as essential to the maintenance of a true self was fostered in his view by the practice of childhood play.|$|E

25|$|Scott {{was driven}} to a beach cottage, where the rope around his ankles was {{loosened}} sufficiently to enable him to make steps. Ross and his partners walked him into the house, {{one of the men}} leading him on a nylon leash, another holding his handcuffs. Ross and his partners had made the house a virtual prison; the windows were covered with thick nylon straps forming a mesh, to prevent escape. The two doors to the room where he was held were guarded. His captors also took his shoes and fitted the room with motion detectors. According to Shupe and Darnell's (2006) account of court testimony, Scott demanded that he be allowed to leave, and asked Ross whether he would try to make him change his religious beliefs. Ross was said to have replied that that <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was paid to do. When Scott threatened Ross with criminal prosecution, Ross was said to have threatened Scott that he would handcuff him to the bed frame.|$|E

500|$|A {{couple of}} months later, British record {{producer}} Ken Nelson was chosen, producing all but one song on Parachutes. He was introduced to Coldplay by his manager Pete Byrne (who gave him {{a copy of the}} band's Fierce Panda-distributed debut single in 1999). Nelson has claimed that, as soon as he heard vocalist Chris Martin's voice on the song [...] "Bigger Stronger", he [...] "realised that he was something special". Nelson was offered the job while Coldplay were performing in Liverpool with English indie rock band Gomez (whose debut album, Bring It On, <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had produced at the time).|$|E
500|$|The {{directors}} cast Nielsen for {{his ability}} to play like [...] "a fish in water", saying [...] "You could have cast funny people and done it with everybody winking, goofing off, and silly... we wanted people to be oblivious to the comedy." [...] For Nielsen, Airplane! marked a shift from dramatic roles to deadpan comedy. When it was suggested his role in Airplane! was against type, Nielsen protested that he had [...] "always been cast against type before", and that comedy <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> always wanted to do. The same directors cast Nielsen in a similar style, in their TV series Police Squad!. The series introduced Nielsen as Frank Drebin, the stereotypical police officer modelled after serious characters in earlier police series.|$|E
500|$|Gabe Bartalos {{performed}} the make-up effects. [...] Trimark contacted Bartalos {{to produce a}} sample. [...] Bartalos's early efforts were not to his liking, and he pushed the design in a more grotesque direction, as that <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> wanted to see on the screen as a horror fan. [...] Bartalos's design impressed Trimark, and he got the account. [...] Applying the make-up took three hours, and taking it off took another 40 minutes. [...] Davis described the experience as [...] "not a pleasant sensation". [...] To pass the time while the make-up was being applied, Davis said he had bizarre conversations with Bartalos, with whom he got along well. [...] Davis was conscious {{of the need to}} stay relaxed and not move, and he channelled his confidence that the make-up effects were properly applied into his acting.|$|E

500|$|In 1994, {{suspicion}} {{of foul play}} by the Benetton team (who were eventually found to {{have been responsible for}} some technical violations {{over the course of the}} season) was said to have troubled Ayrton Senna that season. For example, in the words of his then teammate, Damon Hill, Senna had chosen to spend a bit of time at the first corner of the Aida circuit following his retirement from the Pacific Grand Prix. After listening to Schumacher's Benetton B194 as it went past, Senna [...] "concluded that there <b>was,</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> regarded, as unusual noises from the engine". The FIA subsequently issued a press release setting out action that it required teams to take prior to the German Grand Prix, given that various cars were found to have an advanced engine management systems emulating launch and traction control.|$|E
500|$|Brownlee denied {{absolutely}} MacMillan's claims. [...] He {{said that}} there had been no sexual activity between him and MacMillan, likening their relationship instead to that of an uncle and his favourite niece. [...] To claims that he had induced MacMillan to move to Edmonton and arranged a position for her in the Attorney General's office, he asserted [...] "in the thirteen years I have been in public life I have never promised any person in this Province a position." [...] He denied having convinced MacMillan to move to Edmonton and stated that he had not even known that she had done so until Christopher Pattinson, Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) for Edson, told him. [...] He further claimed that his sex life with Mrs. Brownlee <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> would consider normal for a husband and wife (which was corroborated by his wife).|$|E
500|$|Hoppus {{considered}} {{the music on}} the album wide-ranging, commenting, [...] "We tried to capture the energy and not worry so much about all the knobs." [...] This includes songs he felt sounded like the group circa 1999, [...] "super-fast late-Nineties-punk-rock-sounding songs," [...] {{as well as more}} progressive songs [...] "that are like nothing we have ever done before." [...] Overall, he {{considered the}} record [...] "really rich with sing-along melodies and sing-along choruses," [...] which <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> preferred most when listening to bands. Feldmann considered the music not a [...] "huge departure" [...] from the band's usual sound, as hoped to make a [...] "classic Blink record." [...] To familiarize himself, he listened to all of the band's catalogue prior to recording. Lisa Worden, music director at Los Angeles radio station KROQ, compared its sound to the second Blink-182 album, Dude Ranch, and commented, [...] "It sounds like Blink but it's not anything that we've heard before. For fans of the band, they're going to be super happy with it." ...|$|E

While reading the script, he told Gowariker that some of his character's dialogue <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> would usually say. At the time, Chopra described the film as the [...] "most difficult and important" [...] in her career. She found playing twelve characters equivalent to performing in twelve different films. She had to have a different look for each of them but had very little time to prepare and establish each character on screen, since each character had [...] "one song and about two scenes". Since all the characters except one were between ages eighteen and twenty-four, Chopra found it difficult to make every character look distinct. She said that there were not many options other than changing her hair and the characters' outfits to portray them. As a result, she chose to work on her body language and experimented with her voice and accent to make the characters distinct from one another, describing it as [...] "a real test".|$|E
500|$|Lord of Scoundrels is {{typically}} {{classified as a}} Regency romance novel, though its story {{is set in the}} post-Regency era of 1828. It features a strong female heroine, a characteristic that Chase has become known for including in her romances. The author explains that [...] "for most of history, and in too many cases today, women are considered (and too often consider themselves) lesser beings who do not matter. In my books, the women are not lesser, and they do matter. In other words, I make the world the way I think it should be". Romantic fiction scholars have identified Jessica Trent as a [...] "feminist heroine" [...] with whom the [...] "alpha male hero" [...] has met his match. Chase inverts many qualities typical of the archetypical romantic hero and heroine. Near the end of the story, Jessica is the one who initiates consummation of their marriage, by seducing Dain. Afterwards, Jessica promptly falls asleep, causing her husband to seethe [...] "that <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was supposed to do".|$|E
500|$|After {{six days}} of testimony, closing {{arguments}} were given: Smith's lasted two hours and fifteen minutes and emphasized the discrepancies in MacMillan's story. [...] MacLean's was a relatively brief forty minutes, in which {{he argued that the}} improbable and fantastic nature of his client's tale was evidence that she could not possibly have invented it. [...] Ives then instructed the jurors, and defined [...] "seduction" [...] as [...] "inducing a woman to part with her virtue ... may be by any artful device that brings about her consent." [...] After four hours and forty minutes the jury returned and announced its finding that Brownlee had seduced MacMillan in October 1930 when he had partially penetrated her, and that both she and her father had suffered damages in the amounts claimed. [...] Ives immediately announced that he strongly disagreed with the jury's findings, and that [...] "the evidence does not warrant them". [...] On July2, he issued his written ruling, overturning the jury's verdict and dismissing the action; his reason for doing so <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> viewed as the lack of damage being demonstrated by the plaintiffs. [...] According to Ives, even if the facts had been exactly as MacMillan had described, {{as a matter of law}} the plaintiffs could not claim damages without a pregnancy or an illness.|$|E
