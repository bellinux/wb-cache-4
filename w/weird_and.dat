He is frequently found to be peering into Jules' kitchen window, unnoticed by Jules and/or the gang until he says something. By season 4 he {{is considered one of the}} gang, appearing in most episodes and accompanying the group wherever they go, although still generally standing outside Jules' window instead of in the kitchen with the others. His behaviour is often <b>weird</b> <b>and</b> creepy, and details of his otherwise normal and successful life (that he is a millionaire neurosurgeon, former all-state track star, with an adult son in the Marines and a daughter attending law school) are slowly revealed as the series progresses.|$|E

500|$|Critics {{have offered}} many {{readings}} {{of the influence of}} <b>weird</b> <b>and</b> horror fiction on True Detective narrative, often examining the influence of Robert W.

Allusions to The King in Yellow can be observed in the show's dark philosophy, its recurring use of [...] "Carcosa" [...] and [...] "The Yellow King" [...] as motifs throughout the series, and its symbolic use of yellow as a thematic signature that signifies insanity and decadence. Pizzolatto was accused of plagiarizing Ligotti because of close similarities between lines in True Detective and text from Ligotti's nonfiction book The Conspiracy Against the Human Race (2010)—accusations Pizzolatto denied, while acknowledging Ligotti's influence.|$|E

Analyzing {{the evolution of the}} lyrics through successive drafts, Wilentz writes that there are numerous failures, [...] "about deputies asking him his name... lines about fathers going down hugging one another and about their daughters putting him down because he isn't their brother". Finally Dylan arrives at the right formula.|$|E
