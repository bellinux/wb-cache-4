She {{ended up having}} an {{arranged}} marriage oddly enough and I remember going to her wedding {{and it was one}} of the only weddings that I've EVER been to, besides my own mother's, and it was the biggest party, the most fun ever. So <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> 'Bounce', you know I don't actually drink or smoke so I thought I don't wanna do a video in a club like poppin' bottles and all this stuff, although the song's about partying. I [...] do a celebration... and it made me think of that experience with my mother's friend going to an Indian wedding and having the most crazy and amazing time and I though I wanna do an Indian wedding! And I wanna do it in India! And I wanna do it properly...and I put an elephant in there for good luck." ...|$|E
500|$|Lukather {{achieved}} notability in the 1970s and 1980s {{as one of}} {{the most}} sought-after session guitarists in Los Angeles, playing with a wide range of artists from Aretha Franklin to Warren Zevon. He has performed on over 1,500 records spanning 36years. Music journalist Jude Gold noted, [...] "It's hard to name a guitarist who has had a more prolific and fulfilling career than Steve Lukather." [...] Lukather credits fellow Toto members David Paich and Jeff Porcaro for getting him exposure in the industry—although he lamented in an April 2011 interview that opportunities for session musicians have curtailed in recent years: [...] "There is no 'session guy' thing any more—not like it was. It's not like the old days <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> 25 sessions a week. All the studios are gone. The budgets are gone. The record companies are all gone." [...] His own output as a session musician has slowed along with the rest of the industry—as of 2009, Lukather stated he was only doing a few sessions a year.|$|E

[...] "When I do the dances, {{it reminds me}} of my younger years <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> similar dances during the Cultural Revolution," [...] a retired driver in her mid-60s told the Los Angeles Times in 2014. [...] "I feel the same kind of spirit and emotions." [...] Another woman, whose troupe used the [...] "red songs" [...] written during that era, was more political. [...] "The can always remind us what the Chinese leaders did for us to have a good life today and how they fought hard for the ordinary people in China." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1989 {{he started}} Evil Angel, {{to sell his}} own films. The origin of the company's name goes back to when Stagliano {{was working as a}} stripper: [...] "There was another guy in one of my shows named John. So this MC started calling me Evil John to {{differentiate}} us. This was <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> Dracula and chains. At the same time I had a girlfriend who called herself Angel when she did strip shows. She was a very nasty girl and I suggested that she call herself Evil Angel. She didn't, but I loved the name and wound up using it for my company." ...|$|E
2500|$|Morrison {{concluded}} recording in the summer, when {{he recorded}} {{the rest of}} the songs for the album. Four songs were not used from this session, including the future singles [...] "Real Real Gone" [...] and [...] "Tore Down a la Rimbaud". Neither Knopfler nor Herbie Armstrong were able to produce the guitar tone Morrison wanted, so engineer Jim Stern suggested Chris Michie: [...] "I got the call <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> a session in San Francisco. Van's producer Jim Stern said 'Can you get to the Plant [...] in twenty minutes?' I said 'Yeah.' I walked into the studio with my gear as the band and Van were doing ... basic tracks. I was set up and playing {{before the end of the}} song 'She Gives Me Religion'". [...] Michie later added lead guitar overdubs to [...] "Cleaning Windows" [...] and [...] "Aryan Mist". Knopfler's contributions still featured on the final release, but are not as audible as Michie's.|$|E

2500|$|Von Teese has {{appeared}} {{on a number of}} best-dressed lists and frequents the front row of fashion shows, particularly Christian Dior, Vivienne Westwood, Jean Paul Gaultier, and Marc Jacobs, labels she is often seen wearing. Speaking of her love of Gaultier, Von Teese has said, [...] "Jean Paul Gaultier, John Galliano, and Vivienne Westwood were the first designers that really made an impact on me. Jean Paul has {{a lot of the same}} obsessions that I do, like corsetry, ballet-peach satin and silks, black silk velvet, bullet bras and girdles. When I was a teenager, I would look for 1930s peach satin lingerie pieces to try to get his look for less, because there was no way I could afford his things back then. It was a dream come true to meet him and become friends with him. I met him the first time <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> my first fashion pictorial, which was for Flaunt magazine, and it was a huge story of me wearing the most important pieces from his haute couture archives, and that was a dream!" ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{a display}} of Parker's work ethic, work on the next Tame Impala album Lonerism had already started before Innerspeaker was even {{released}}. Lonerism was released on 5 October 2012 to widespread critical acclaim, winning many Album of the Year awards {{from the likes of}} NME Magazine, Rolling Stone Magazine and Triple J. Lonerism marks an extension of Parker's music, featuring synths and poppier melodies, and also a more lavish, lush and expansive sound. Commenting on the new-found sound, Parker said that [...] " [...] will be the kind of music that I felt as though I wanted to make during Innerspeaker, but I felt that it {{was too much of a}} jump. Back <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> Innerspeaker, I felt like I should make an album with only guitars, and use no synths, because I felt like it was a compromise to what we do. But I now know that it's not." [...] At the ARIA Music Awards of 2015 he won two trophies, Engineer of the Year and Producer of the Year, for his work on Tame Impala's Currents (July 2015); the group won three further categories at the ceremony: Album of the Year, Best Group and Best Rock Album.|$|E

6000|$|For a time Guy of Gisbourne stared upon Robin {{as though}} bereft of wits; but his wonder quickly passed to a wild rage. [...] "Art thou indeed Robin Hood?" [...] cried he. [...] "Now <b>I</b> <b>am</b> glad to meet thee, thou poor wretch! Shrive thyself, for thou wilt {{have no time}} for shriving <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>done</b> with thee."

5000|$|Of his feats, Engels described: [...] "I don't regard my {{marathon}} year as torture.

I don't always feel like running, but <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>done,</b> <b>I</b> take a shower, have some physiotherapy for an hour, and that wraps up my day." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{am afraid}} I {{must be at}} bottom, what a cheerful Indian critic has dubbed me, 'a faddling hedonist,' for this {{description}} of the brother's motives gave me somewhat of a shock. I should have preferred to think he had chosen the life for its own sake, and not for ulterior purposes; and this shows how profoundly I was out of sympathy with these good Trappists, even <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> my best to sympathise. But to the cure the argument seemed decisive.|$|E
6000|$|... “Thanks. Now I {{want you}} to listen. I’m not going to defend my {{commercial}} character. I’ve taken up a good many risky deals and put them through, fighting the men who meant to down me as best I could; but all my business hasn’t been a raid on somebody else’s property. In fact, you can’t play the bold pirate too often. Very well; now and then, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> an innocent trade, I wanted a respectable associate {{as a kind of}} guarantee, and asked your father to stand in. He’s known as a straight man, and my having him helped to disarm suspicion; I’ll admit that I found him useful in that respect. I hope I’ve said enough to satisfy you?” ...|$|E
6000|$|Frank Beard {{has been}} here this evening, of course since I posted my this day's letter to you, and has {{told me that you}} are not at all well, and how he has given you {{something}} which he hopes and believes will bring you round. It is not to convey this insignificant piece of intelligence, or to tell you how anxious I am that you should come up with a wet sheet and a flowing sail (as we say at sea when we are not sick), that I write. It is simply to say what follows, which I hope may save you some mental uneasiness. For I was stricken ill <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> [...] "Bleak House," [...] and I shall not easily forget what I suffered under the fear {{of not being able to}} come up to time.|$|E
6000|$|Then the Count turned, {{after looking}} at my face attentively, {{and said in a}} soft whisper, [...] "Yes, I too can love. You yourselves can tell it from the past. Is it not so?

6000|$|... "I {{tell you}} <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{old enough to}} judge for myself, Cynthia," [...] said he, [...] "and I intend to judge for myself.

6000|$|Then Lady Carbury {{spoke out}} her mind. 'Felix, I think you must <b>be</b> a fool. <b>I</b> have given over ever expecting {{that you would}} do {{anything}} to please me.

6000|$|... "Two months ago," [...] says Buckingham Skinner, [...] "I {{was doing}} well down in Texas with a patent {{instantaneous}} fire kindler, made of compressed wood ashes and benzine. I sold loads of 'em in towns where they like to burn niggers quick, without having to ask somebody for a light. And just <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> the best they strikes oil down there and puts me out of business. 'Your machine's too slow, now, pardner,' they tells me. 'We can have a coon in hell with this here petroleum before your old flint-and-tinder truck can get him warm enough to perfess religion.' And so I gives up the kindler and drifts up here to K.C. This little curtain-raiser you seen me doing, Mr. Pickens, with the simulated farm and the hypothetical teams, ain't in my line at all, and I'm ashamed you found me working it." ...|$|E
60|$|Some hostesses, of course, {{will forgive}} anything, even unto pavonicide (is {{there such a}} word?), {{as long as one}} is nice-looking and {{sufficiently}} unusual to counterbalance some of the others; and there are others--the girl, for instance, who reads Meredith, and appears at meals with unnatural punctuality in a frock that's made at home and repented at leisure. She eventually finds her way to India and gets married, and comes home to admire the Royal Academy, and to imagine that an indifferent prawn curry is for ever an effective substitute for all that we have been taught to believe is luncheon. It's then that she is really dangerous; but at her worst she is never quite so bad as the woman who fires Exchange and Mart questions at you without the least provocation. Imagine the other day, just <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> my best to understand half the things I was saying, being asked by one of those seekers after country home truths how many fowls she could keep in a run ten feet by six, or whatever it was!

6000|$|... "I {{was frightened}} once," [...] says the surgeon. [...] "It was <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> dispensary work. One night I had {{a call from}} some very poor people, and {{gathered}} from the few words they said that their child was ill. When I entered the room I saw a small cradle in the corner. Raising the lamp I walked over and putting back the curtains I {{looked down at the}} baby. I tell you it was sheer Providence that I didn't drop that lamp and set the whole place alight. The head on the pillow turned and I saw a face looking up at me which seemed to me to have more malignancy and wickedness than ever I had dreamed of in a nightmare. It was the flush of red over the cheekbones, and the brooding eyes full of loathing of me, and of everything else, that impressed me. I'll never forget my start as, instead of the chubby face of an infant, my eyes fell upon this creature. I took the mother into the next room. 'What is it?' I asked. 'A girl of sixteen,' said she, and then throwing up her arms, 'Oh, pray God she may be taken!' The poor thing, though she spent her life in this little cradle, had great, long, thin limbs which she curled up under her. I lost sight of the case and don't know what became of it, but I'll never forget the look in her eyes." ...|$|E
