50|$|The {{fish feed}} on {{plankton}} such as copepods. They are preyed on by California halibut, rock bass, <b>white</b> <b>croakers</b> {{and other large}} predators. Humans catch them for food or use them as bait. The eggs are at risk from shore birds such as the whimbrel and the marbled godwit, which probe the sand with their beaks. The eggs are also sought by sandworms, ground squirrels, a species of isopod, and certain beetles and flies.|$|R
50|$|These {{fish can}} be caught on almost {{any kind of}} animal bait that is fished from piers or jetties in sandy or sandy mud areas. In fact, they are so easily hooked that most anglers {{consider}} them a nuisance of the worst sort. If a person desires to fish specifically for <b>white</b> <b>croakers</b> a tough, difficult-to-steal bait, such as squid, is recommended. When hooked, they put up little or no fight.

50|$|The {{body of the}} <b>white</b> <b>croaker</b> is {{elongate}} {{and somewhat}} compressed. The head is oblong and bluntly rounded, with a mouth that is somewhat underneath the head. The color is incandescent brownish to yellowish on the back becoming silvery below. The fins are yellow to white. The <b>white</b> <b>croaker</b> {{is one of five}} California croakers that have mouths located under their heads (subterminal). They can be distinguished from the California corbina and yellowfin croaker by the absence of a single fleshy projection, or barbel, {{at the tip of the}} lower jaw. The 12 to 15 spines in the first dorsal fin serve to distinguish white croakers from all the other croakers with sub-terminal mouths, since none of these has more than 11 spines in this fin.|$|E

50|$|Since 1997, the EPA has {{implemented}} a control program with three major elements: public outreach and education, fish monitoring, and enforcement. The fish monitoring program involves sampling both {{fish in the}} ocean and fish in retail markets. The MSRP and EPA completed the ocean fish sampling program in July 2007. EPA utilized the data to update the risk assessments for the site. EPA and the public are currently awaiting the State of California to update the existing fish advisory based on the recent data. EPA continues to sample white croakers at local markets. The first phase effort started in 2004. Finally, EPA {{is working with the}} local county health departments on marketplace inspection.

40|$|Mitochondrial (mt) DNA {{population}} structure was examined by using {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} analysis (RFLP) among 149 <b>white</b> mouth <b>croakers</b> (Micropogonias furnieri) sampled from six {{locations in the}} Brazilian coast. Heterogeneity tests revealed no differentiation in mtDNA haplotype frequencies within the region between 23 °S and 34 °S (P= 0. 263), but significant heterogeneity was detected between north and south of 23 °S (P< 0. 003). Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) indicated a low FST value (0. 008, P= 0. 180) among south-central localities (23 - 34 °S), but a significant level of population subdivision (FST = 0. 322, P< 0. 003) between north and south-central localities. UPGMA analysis of mtDNA sequence divergence revealed differentiation between <b>white</b> mouth <b>croakers</b> collected from north and south of 23 °S.

The {{majority of the}} fish (95 %) were parasitized by metazoan. Twenty-eight species of parasites were collected. The nematodes were the 40. 5 % {{of the total number}} of parasites specimens collected. Dichelyne elongatus was the most dominant species. Lobatostoma ringens, Pterinotrematoides mexicanum, Corynosoma australe, D. elongatus, and Caligus haemulonis showed a positive correlation between the host's total length and parasite prevalence and abundance. The monogenean P. mexicanum had differences in the prevalence and abundance in relation to sex of the host. The mean diversity in the infracommunities of M. furnieri was H= 0. 499 ± 0. 411, with correlation with the host's total length and without differences in relation to sex of the host. One pair of ectoparasites showed positive covariation, and two pairs of endoparasites showed positive association and covariation between their prevalences and abundances, respectively. Negative association or covariations were not found.

40|$|The {{fate and}} {{distribution}} of DDA [2, 2 -bis(4 -chlorophenyl) acetic acid, CAS No. : 83 - 05 - 6], a water-soluble DDT [1, 1, 1 -trichloro- 2, 2 -di(4 -chlorophenyl) ethane, CAS No. : 50 - 29 - 3] metabolite and its potential role in environmental surveillance and biomonitoring was investigated. An analytical method for urinary DDA detection using pentafluorobenzyl bromide derivatization in human urine was developed (LOQ 10 ppb). Repeat of a 1946 human oral DDT study showed rapid DDA excretion in urine. Urine biomonitoring of Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS) program applicators demonstrated significantly higher DDA levels during spraying season (59 µg/L) than 1 -month post-season (11 µg/L) and indicated low DDT exposure. DDA levels of applicators {{were similar to those}} of general U. S. population during earlier periods of DDT use. DDE does not form DDA. DDA analysis is sensitive, specific and technically simple and adaptable for measurement of low level DDT exposures in applicators or residents where DDT is used in IRS. DDA is a fecal chemical biomarker of DDT exposure in chickens based upon DDT feeding studies (10 to 3000 ppm) in White Leghorn and ISA Brown hens.. Dose-dependent, rapid DDA excretion was observed. Blood and egg yolk DDTs (DDT/DDE/DDD) reflected body burden. Chlortetracycline HCl (~ 20 mg/kg drinking water) showed gut microflora contributed to DDA formation. Chicken feces from previous IRS treated areas indicated low background levels of DDTs and DDA. Chickens may be used as a sentinel species in monitoring current environmental DDT exposure. DDTs are present in the sediments of Southern California Bight (SCB). Only ~ 10 % of total DDTs discharged into the SCB are accounted for using available monitoring data (sediment, water, and biota). DDE is the dominant contaminant and analysis of <b>white</b> <b>croakers</b> and gull and brown pelican feces yielded no evidence of current DDT exposure based upon DDA residues. DDA was detected in SCB sediment (up to 76 µg/kg dry weight). DDT and DDD levels at the primary wastewater outfall indicated substantial potential for DDT transformation to DDA. Still culture of SCB sediment revealed rapid DDA formation following DDT fortification. DDA formation may be important in the natural recovery of SCB and provide important insight into resolution of the DDT mass balance...|$|R
40|$|The stomach {{contents}} of 18 Guiana dolphins stranded or accidentally caught by fishing around Norte Bay of Santa Catarina Island between 1990 and 2006 were examined. The small population of Guiana dolphins studied showed a varied diet, and prey was caught disproportionately. The stomach {{contents of}} these dolphins consisted of 448 prey remains coming from 18 species and 10 families. Their diet primarily consisted of fish, but also shrimp and squid. The most important species were cutlass fish (Trichiurus lepturus) and <b>white</b> mouth <b>croaker</b> (Micropogonias furnieri), which together comprised 75 % {{of the total}} biomass. Although prey size ranged widely from 1. 4 to 92. 8 cm, a prevalence of prey smaller than 20 cm was observed. There was a predominance of prey living in moderate or large schools.

One fish may eat many of these organisms, causing the DDT and PCBs to accumulate in fish tissue. Fish-eating birds, marine mammals and birds of prey that feed on both, accumulate more of the toxins. Since 1985, fish consumption advisories and health warnings have been posted in southern California because of elevated DDT and PCB levels. Bottom-feeding fish are particularly at risk for high contamination levels. Consumption of <b>white</b> <b>croaker,</b> which has the highest contamination levels, should be avoided.

Furthermore, the internal structure of gels set at 40 °C was regular and compact in both 1 -step and 2 -step heating gels. A regular, dense and compact gel network with thick strands was formed in gels set at 50 °C. Thus, it was concluded that the non-covalent thermal aggregation of <b>white</b> <b>croaker</b> surimi protein during setting could form a fine and compact gel network with thick strands and this gel network was maintained or reinforced by non-covalent bonding during subsequent heating at 80 °C for 20 min under the inhibition of the polymerization and degradation of MHC...|$|E

40|$|The gel-forming {{ability of}} the lean-fish (<b>white</b> <b>croaker)</b> surimi on the {{addition}} of vegetable oils or triglycerides were investigated. Addition of oils to fish surimi alter the softness of fish paste. However, effects of the adding varying levels of rice, soybean and olive oils were not only in decreasing, but also in increasing the gel strength of <b>white</b> <b>croaker</b> surimi after {{the addition of a}} few %(W/W) of the oils. Breaking strengths (BS) of these heat-induced gels significantly increased to 1. 12 times when rice oil was mixed at 2 % concentration of the surimi, 1. 19 times when soybean oil was mixed at 2 %, and 1. 20 times when olive oil was mixed at 4 %. BS of each heat-induced gel declined with increasing levels of vegetable oils, i. e. 4 %, 6 % and 8 %. A similar study was also employed using the triglycerides, trilinolein, triolein and tristearin. Effects of these triglycerides were evidently relative to the concentrations in the gels. The addition of less than 4 ～ 5 % of three types of triglyceride except tripalmitin gave a significantly higher BS value than that of the control <b>white</b> <b>croaker</b> surimi gel, but excessive addition decreased the BS value. Only tripalmitin showed decreasing effect on the BS value of the gel at all concentrations tested. These results suggest that some triglycerides (trilinolein, triolein and tristearin) in vegetable oils show reinforcing and obstructing (softening) effects on the thermally induced gel-forming {{ability of the}} lean-fish surimi. 長寿高齢化社会への移行に伴い，咀嚼嚥下の容易な魚肉練り製品が求められている。魚肉練り製品を柔らかく，しかも食塊形成し易い性状にするために植物油の添加が有効である。本報告は，この植物油の効果がトリグリセリドの種類と量によって生じる事を示した。シログチの塩ずり身にトリパルミチン，トリステアリン，トリオレイン，トリリノレインをそれぞれ最大で魚肉の８％まで添加し加熱ゲルを形成させたところ，トリパルミチンは添加濃度に依存しすり身ゲルの強度を 25 %まで低下させたが，他のトリグリセリドは，極少量添加（トリステアリンとトリリノレインでは 1 %，トリオレインでは 2 %）で一旦ゲル強度の増強効果を示した後、それ以上の添加で軟化効果を発現した。これらの結果から，すり身への種々の植物油添加が魚肉ゲルを軟化させる効果は，植物油中トリグリセリド成分の種類と量により決定されると考えられた...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} gel-forming characteristics of <b>white</b> <b>croaker</b> protein itself. This study was carried out under the inhibition of the polymerization and degradation of myosin heavy chain (MHC) by ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and leupeptin. The heat-induced gels were prepared by preheating at temperatures in the range of 30 - 80 °C for 20 min or 2 h and then heating at 80 °C for 20 min and were evaluated in terms of gel strength. In order to investigate the behavior of proteins, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out. Folin method was used to clarify the degradation of proteins by protease. Suwari occurred during preheating at 40 and 50 °C and it contributed to gel-strengthening effect of the 2 -step heating gels preheated at 50 °C, indicating that non-covalent bonding reinforced the gel during setting and subsequent heating at 80 °C even under the inhibition of the polymerization and degradation of MHC. The gel strength of 2 -step heating gels was not affected by preheating temperature for 20 min, except for the gel preheated at 50 °C under the inhibitory condition. Those gel strength values were similar to that of the gel heated directly at 80 °C for 20 min. The maximum gel strength was obtained at 50 °C. This suggests the gel-forming ability of <b>white</b> <b>croaker</b> protein itself. At temperature above 60 °C, the gel strength decreased with preheating time, though the degradation of MHC was suppressed, indicating that non-proteolytic modori contributes to the weakening of gel of <b>white</b> <b>croaker</b> surimi...|$|E

These categories represent two of four major types of marine sportfishing; the others are fishing from party boats and from piers and jetties. Probability sampling plans employing fisherman interviews were used in obtaining the basic data for the surveys. Shoreline surveys were supplemented by aerial progressive counts of fishing poles. Private boat sportfishing activities during 1964 were estimated at 2. 8 million man hours (mh) of fishing. The catch of almost 1 million fish was composed primarily of five species, Pacific bonito, California halibut, <b>white</b> <b>croaker,</b> sand bass, and kelp bass. A 12 -month survey, 1965 – 66, revealed that surf fishermen expended an estimated 1. 7 million mh of effort in taking 0. 5 million fish. More fishing effort was expended from the bay shoreline, 869, 557 mh, than from the open coast, 776, 732 mh. The catch in each area was markedly different. <b>White</b> <b>croaker,</b> queenfish, and smelt (jack and top) were the most significant species in inland bays, while for the open coast, barred surfperch, opaleye, and California corbina were most important.
