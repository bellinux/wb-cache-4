5|$|The Lowell System {{combined}} large-scale mechanization with {{an attempt}} to improve the stature of its female workforce and workers. A few girls who came with their mothers or older sisters were as young as ten years old, some were middle-aged, but the average age was about 24. Usually hired for contracts of one year (the average stay <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>four</b> years), new employees were given assorted tasks as spare hands and paid a fixed daily wage while more experienced loom operators would be paid by the piece. They were paired with more experienced women, who trained them {{in the ways of}} the factory.|$|E
5|$|The sejm {{comprised}} two chambers, {{with varying}} numbers of deputies. After the 1569 Union of Lublin, the Kingdom of Poland {{was transformed into}} the federation of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and the numbers of sejm participants were significantly increased with {{the inclusion of the}} deputies from Lithuanian sejmiks. The deputies had no set term of office, although in practice it <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>four</b> months long, from their election at a regional sejmik, to their report on the next sejmik dedicated to hearing and discussing the previous sejm's proceedings (those sejmiks were known as relational or debriefing). Deputies had parliamentary immunity and any crimes against them were classified as lèse-majesté.|$|E

5|$|When Hitler {{asked for}} a pretext for the {{invasion}} of Poland in 1939, Himmler, Heydrich, and Heinrich Müller masterminded a false flag plan code-named Operation Himmler. It involved a fake attack on the German radio station at Gleiwitz on 31 August 1939. Heydrich masterminded the plan and toured the site, which <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>four</b> miles from the Polish border. Wearing Polish uniforms, 150 German troops carried out several attacks along the border. Hitler used the ruse {{as an excuse to}} launch his invasion.|$|E
5|$|When he {{examined}} Tom McLaury's body, Mathews found twelve buckshot wounds {{from a single}} shotgun blast {{on the right side}} under his arm, between the third and fifth ribs. The wound <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>four</b> inches across. The nature and location of the wound indicated that it could not have been received if Tom's hands were on his coat lapels as the Cowboys later testified. Both Virgil and Wyatt stated that Holliday had shot Tom, which the coroner's exam supported.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the fact}} that Scotland {{probably}} had about {{one quarter of the}} population of England, it had three times the number of witchcraft prosecutions, at an estimated 4,000 to 6,000 over the entire period. This <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>four</b> times the European average. The overwhelming majority were in the Lowlands, where the Kirk had more control, despite the evidence that basic magical beliefs were very widespread in the Highlands. Persecution of witchcraft in Orkney differed from the mainland with most trials taking place before 1650. Large series of trials included those in 1590–91 and the Great Scottish Witch Hunt of 1597, which took place across Scotland from March to October. At least 400 people were put on trial for various forms of diabolism. The exact number of those executed {{as a result of these}} trials is unknown, but is believed to be about 200. Later major trials included hunts in 1628–31 and 1649–50. Probably the most intense witch-hunt was in 1661–62, which involved some 664 named witches in four counties.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Flying Pigeon was the country's biggest bike manufacturer, selling 3 million cycles in 1986. Its 20-kilo black single-speed models were popular with workers, {{and there was}} a waiting list of several years to get one, and even then buyers needed good guanxi (connections) in {{addition}} to the purchase cost, which <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>four</b> months' wages for most workers.|$|E

Even so, the novel maintains its interest on the reader throughout, partly because of the originality of its approach.|$|E

25|$|When the 501 was {{introduced}} in 1951, its cost of approximately DM15,000 <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>four</b> times the average German's earnings. It was also much heavier than expected and underpowered with a development of BMW's pre-war twolitre six. Delays in receiving and setting up equipment caused production of the 501 to be delayed until late 1952, with body construction, originally expected to be done in-house, being done by Karosserie Baur in Stuttgart {{for more than a}} year.|$|E
25|$|The telescope's {{delays and}} cost {{increases}} {{can be compared}} to the Hubble Space Telescope. When Hubble formally started in 1972, it then had an estimated development cost of $300 million (or about $1 billion in 2006 constant dollars), but {{by the time it was}} sent into orbit in 1990, the cost <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>four</b> times that. In addition new instruments and servicing missions increased the cost to at least $9 billion by 2006.|$|E

25|$|The engine did however have {{a second}} brief lease of life in sportscar racing, when the FIA {{announced}} plans to transition towards using 3.5L F1-style engines in Group C in the early 1990s. In 1990 Spice Engineering adapted its existing Group C design to take a 3.5L DFZ instead of the previously used 3.3L DFL engine. However the new engine caused significant problems due to vibration, {{which resulted in the}} breakage of components and a significant increase in running costs - Gordon Spice estimated that the DFZ-powered car <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>four</b> times more expensive to run than the DFL-engined one.|$|E
25|$|In February and March 1940, Peierls and Frisch co-authored the Frisch–Peierls memorandum, which Peierls typed. This short {{paper was}} the first to {{establish}} that an atomic bomb could be created from a small amount of fissile uranium-235. Based on the information at hand, they calculated that less 1kg would be required. The true figure for the critical mass <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>four</b> times as large; but until then it had been assumed that such a bomb would require many tons of uranium, and consequently was impractical to build and use. They went on to estimate the size of the explosion, and its physical, military and political effects.|$|E

25|$|On 1 July 1799, Racoon recaptured the West Indiaman Benjamin and Elizabeth, {{which had}} been sailing from Grenada to London, and which two French {{privateer}}s had just captured. Benjamin and Elizabeth <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>four</b> leagues off Dungeness during a foggy night, when two French privateer luggers came up and boarded her. The captain, mate, and two seaman resisted but were overwhelmed. The privateers threw the captain overboard, though he was already severely wounded. One lugger picked him up. The privateers also shot the mate and one seaman at point-blank range after they were already wounded and had surrendered (both were expected to survive). Racoon, {{which had been}} escorting the West India convoy, heard the shooting and came up after the privateer vessels had left. She was able to recapture Benjamin and Elizabeth within minutes. Shortly afterwards the fog cleared slightly and Racoon saw the privateers, {{one of which was}} about 3-400 yards away. Racoon immediately fired a broadside, and when the smoke cleared, the lugger had disappeared completely, apparently sunk. The second privateer disappeared as the fog came back in.|$|E

[...] Goldstone was educated at King Edward VII School in Johannesburg and subsequently undertook a six-year legal studies course at the University of the Witwatersrand, from which he graduated in 1962 with a BA LLB cum laude.|$|E
