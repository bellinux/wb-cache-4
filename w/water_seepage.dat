5|$|At the Canning Dam {{and indeed}} all dams, care {{had to be}} taken to prevent <b>water</b> <b>seepage</b> between the {{foundation}} rock and the structure of the dam. At the Canning in addition to cutting back the foundation to solid unfractured rock, a cut-off trench was sited near the upstream face of the dam, down stream which a rock filled drain containing open jointed pipes was provided to intercept any seepage between the rock face and the concrete of the dam. The inclusion of an internal drainage system was considered innovative at the period. Near vertical tubular 8 in (200mm) cut-off drains were provided at five-foot (1.52 m) intervals along the dam to relieve internal seepage through the concrete.|$|E

Almost immediately, railroad engineers realized that the unstable nature of shale through which the tunnel was bored, ground <b>water</b> <b>seepage,</b> and the isolated location of the tunnel meant repairs would be frequent and costly. The tunnel was originally braced by wooden beams when it opened to rail traffic in January 1888, but these eventually proved inadequate, and were replaced in 1902 by brick and reinforced concrete. Constant deterioration of the supports meant that large-scale reconstruction of the tunnel was needed in 1912, 1918, 1944 and 1947.|$|E

5|$|Around the 1880s, San Francisco wine dealers were {{purchasing}} {{wine from}} Napa Valley vintners at low prices (sometimes around 15 to 18 cents per gallon). The dealers had facilities to store and age wines that most Napa Valley vintners lacked, and thus {{were able to}} purchase wine from the vintners at low prices. Because of this, Bourn began a campaign to build the cooperative winery; {{he was in his}} early 30s at the time. He created a business partnership with another businessman, E. Everett Wise, who was of a similar age. Bourn then asked for support within the Napa County wine industry. Bourn met with Henry Pellet, president of the St. Helena Vinicultural Club, who endorsed the idea and encouraged his associates to do the same. Bourn and Wise ended up gathering enough support from the local wine industry, and they hired George Percy and Frederick F. Hamilton of the San Francisco architectural firm Percy & Hamilton to design the Greystone Cellars, along with Italian stonemasons to build the façades, and the Ernest L. Ransome firm to handle concrete work. The plans involved the use of new materials and technology of the time, including the relatively new Portland cement. The cement was used as mortar and also poured over the iron reinforcing rods built within the first and second floor elevations. The heavy timber construction of the third floor provided structural support for not only that floor's cask, barrel and bottle aging space but also for the gravity-flow crushing area located on the floor above. The architects planned for the cellars to hold two million gallons of wine at a time, with thirteen tunnels in the hillside behind the building to hold another million gallons. Those tunnels collapsed due to effects of <b>water</b> <b>seepage</b> and of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake.|$|E

40|$|Soil extractions are {{possibly}} useful {{tools to}} estimate the trace metal concentration in soil and <b>seepage</b> <b>water.</b> In order to use these tools {{it is necessary to}} compare the extraction concentration with the concentration of the naturally and undisturbed <b>seepage</b> <b>water.</b> Potential effects on metal trace element concentration from lysimeter outflow due to lysimeter building material components were investigated by comparing lysimeter outflow concentrations with concentrations of surface near groundwater. Some lysimeters could not be used for further investigation. Finally we selected lysimeters with 16 different soils for further examinations, which lasted up to 3 years. 43 trace elements were analysed in 340 <b>seepage</b> <b>water</b> samples and 53 soil samples. To get a realistic picture of the variability of the trace element concentration of <b>seepage</b> <b>water</b> pouring from unpolluted soils it is useful to determine the median of the analysed samples. The median concentrations could be used as background values. They are all below the limits of the German soil protection decree. The <b>seepage</b> <b>water</b> concentrations of a lysimeter may vary about one decade. The investigations of these unpolluted soils show that there is no obvious correlation between the concentrations of the eluation methods. A comparison of these concentrations with the median of the concentrations from the <b>seepage</b> <b>water</b> likewise shows no direct correlations. Only soil samples below 60 cm depth could be used for this comparison. The concentrations calculated according to the formulas of the DIV V 19735 agree within the same decade with those of the analysed samples. In view of the great variety of <b>seepage</b> <b>water</b> concentrations the soil saturation extract is most similar to the <b>seepage</b> <b>water.</b> (orig.)

This study aimed to determine if the toxicity of a typical saline <b>seepage</b> <b>water</b> was solely due to its major ion constituents; and determine which major ions were the leading contributors to the toxicity. Standardised toxicity tests using two tropical freshwater species Chlorella sp. (alga) and Moinodaphnia macleayi (cladoceran) were used to compare the toxicity of 1) mine and synthetic seepage water; 2) key major ions (e. g. Na, Cl, SO 4 and HCO 3); 3) synthetic <b>seepage</b> <b>water</b> that were modified by excluding key major ions. For Chlorella sp., the toxicity of the <b>seepage</b> <b>water</b> was not solely due to its major ion concentrations because there were differences in effects caused by the mine seepage and synthetic seepage. However, for M. macleayi this hypothesis was supported because similar effects caused by mine seepage and synthetic seepage.

25|$|In 2009, {{as a part}} of {{the ongoing}} {{restoration}} work, the ASI and AKTC, after months of manual work using hand-tools, removed from the roof a thick layer of cement concrete that had been exerting pressure of about 1,102 tons on the structure. The cement concrete was originally laid in the 1920s to prevent <b>water</b> <b>seepage,</b> and led to a blockage in water passages. Subsequently, each time there was leakage, a fresh layer of cement was added, leading to an accumulated thickness of about 40cm; this has now been replaced with a traditional lime-based roof layer. In the next phase, similar treatment was given to the tomb's first chabutra (plinth), which was originally paved with large blocks of quartzite stone, some weighing over a 1,000kg. In the 1940s, an uneven settlement in the lower plinth had been corrected by covering it with a layer of concrete, adding to the disfigurement of the original Mughal flooring, which matched with that at the West Gate.|$|E

Another aim was to evaluate the data and to optimize sampling and analysis.
