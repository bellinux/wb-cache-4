40|$|Quality sex {{education}} {{for young people}} is crucial for promoting {{the development of their}} sexual knowledge, maturity, self-confidence, communication skills, and <b>well-rounded</b> <b>personalities.</b> However, much {{sex education}} appears to be anchored in Blooms' lowest levels of thinking namely Remembering, Comprehension and some in Application. Bloom's top three levels namely Analysis, Evaluation and Creating, exhibit the sorts of thinking that a meaningful adulthood requires, especially in all kinds of human relationships, and in personal management skills. So, helping to elevate young people's thinking skills to these higher levels may assist this development. In order to help young people develop higher level thinking skills in sexuality education, a variety of educational activities using Bloom's Revised Taxonomy are suggested here to guide the teacher and/or parent.

40|$|Traditional liberal {{education}} has provided one-size-fits-all schooling, followed by neoliberal {{policies in the}} past 30 years, resulting in losing the purpose of education to build <b>well-rounded</b> <b>personalities</b> and to ensure quality education for all. Instead, the ideal today is the homo economicus able to further personal goals on self-interest, and the global divide {{between the haves and}} have-nots has increased. The research problem rises from the alternative view to the purpose of education, to fostering the learner’s full human growth, and focuses on holistic education as expressed in the ethics of care theory of Nel Noddings and my life experiences in four diverse learning cultures. Meta-analysis and auto-ethnography were used as research methods. Noddings’ work on the care phenomenon was studied with meta-analysis. Auto-ethnography based on my educational experiences from four different cultures was employed to spot the holistic education interrelationships with the care theory of Noddings. Noddings’ themes of care are interwoven into holistic education via inquiry, dialogue, response and reflection. These and the auto-ethnographic data correspond with the conceptual framework of holistic education created from relevant theory in the study, connecting the physical, intellectual, emotional, social, creative, and spiritual, into interconnectedness and self-actualization. The author’s voice lends insightful support to Noddings’ propositions of care into the development of a holistic individual, emphasizing equality, purposefulness and meaning of education...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{article focuses}} on {{discourse}} as a complex special characteristics and functions, academic and communication strategies. The interaction of an individual occurs in the definite communicative environment, definite social sphere of communication. Educational discourse is pragmatic and institutional one. The general purpose of the educational discourse under consideration is to study the establishing of conditions for development of <b>well-rounded</b> <b>personalities</b> in their psychophysical, social and personal characteristics. Language is considered both as a means and aim of teaching. The arguments first propose that the modern educational discourse is the crossroads of anthropology, contemporary approaches to studying language and culture comprises knowledge of classical literature. Second, global approach to English determines new teaching strategies: to teach international, generally received language, to adopt it {{to the needs of}} your society and to save its unicity. The third matter under consideration is classical English literature as an important component of a total language arts and the way it provides a language model. At last literature shows the dynamic interrelation between language and society, economic and political conditions in Britain and the whole world during the centuries. The methods of theoretical, lingua-cultural, qualitative analyses are used. The conclusion is drawn on the matter of the English classical literature as not only the wealth of sociolinguistic knowledge but also a means of recording changes in English, the way of studying/teaching language and forming aesthetical and moral values, a means of forming tolerance that is important in the modern multicultural world...|$|R

40|$|The {{student nurse}} must be shaped into a true {{professional}} practitioner. This is a continuous process {{which has its}} roots in the person’s experiences which led her to join the nursing profession. Professionalization of the student nurse includes three essential elements. The first important aspect is that she must attain professional nursing expertise as this is a prerequisite of professional status. This includes a strong knowledge base and vocational proficiency. Secondly, she must develop into a good leader. Leadership can be nurtured by requiring independent work through group discussions and by allowing students to manage and control their own affairs in the nurses’ residence. Finally the professional nurse should have a <b>well-rounded</b> <b>personality</b> characterised by integration, an own identity and self-discipline. Here nursing role models are very important and the student should be provided with opportunities to share her opinions and to use her own initiative...|$|E
40|$|Editor’s note: I {{have one}} of these posters. Willard Waterman signed it when he was at the Cincinnati convention. I have the pen he used. There were two types of comedy {{competing}} for listener attention during the Golden Age of Radio- vaudeville comedy and character corn-edy- and most comedy performers on the air couId be placed firmly into on e camp or the other. A few performers straddled both- Jack Benny comes immediately to mind- but it was very rare for a radio character to move from one style to another. One who did, and with out-standing success, was Throckmorton P. Gildersleeve. Today, The Great GiIdersleeve {{is one of the most}} fondly remembered of radio’s comedic fig-ures- an earnest, well-meaning fellow who often found himself the unfortunate victim of his own pomposity. As delineated by Harold Peary and Willard Waterman over the programs sev-enteen-year run, GiIdy emerged as a figure of great depth. This was a testament not just to the actors who played the part, but also to the writ-ers who gave him words, and to the supporting cast who gave him a believable, textured setting. Throckmorton P. Gildersleeve hadn’t always been such a <b>well-rounded</b> <b>personality.</b> When he first appeared on the scene in the late 1930 ’s, he was merely one in a long parade of exagger-ated comic types to emerge from the typewriter of the vaudevilie-influenced former cartoonist Don Quinn.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to clarify the {{thoughts}} of five population groups concerning the selection and evaluation of a secondary school principal, in Indiana. The following four questions were used as a basis for the study. 1. Is there a difference of opinion between what the superintendent and the school board members look for in an applicant's credentials, and the qualifications a teacher perceives as necessary for the position of principal? 2. Is there a clear-cut pattern of undergraduate majors among the group of principals? 3. Do the five population groups studied agree or disagree concerning what is important when evaluating a principal? 4. Is there a difference of opinion regarding the principals most important function as seen by the five groups questioned?The randomly selected participants, which included students, teachers, principals, superintendents, and school board members, were chosen from the eight counties in East Central Indiana as follows: Blackford, Delaware, Grant, Henry, Jay, Madison, Randolph, and Wayne. The study was conducted entirely by mail. The potential school board members, superintendents, and principals were asked to take part in the study. In addition,, principals were asked to select a teacher and a student who would be representative of the faculty and student body. At this point, pre-tested questionnaires were sent out to each of the five populations. No attempt was made to identify the individual respondents; however, the questionnaires were separated into one of five responding categories. First, answers to questions were compared within the various occupational categories to determine if a consensus of opinion existed among those persons within that group. For example, do the school board members agree on items which are important in selecting a principal. Second, the responses were compared between groups. For example, do teachers and superintendents agree or disagree on those items of importance in principal evaluation. In order that a comparison could be made, the multiple-choice answers were assigned a numerical value of one-to-four. Questions having mean scores of one were considered very important in the selection or evaluation process. All five populations participated in principal evaluation, but the student category was not asked to answer questions on principal selection. After all mean scores were figured, a composite, using all categories, was developed using the most important and least important items in principal selection as seen by all responding groups. The same procedure was used to develop a composite for principal evaluation. Items which were seen as important in the selection of a principal are given in the paragraphs which follow. Respondents rated the applicant's willingness to work with assistants and other subordinates now in the system as extremely important when selecting a principal. Also receiving a high rating was the applicant's awareness of current educational trends and ideas. Sincerity and a pleasing personality received high marks, as did an understanding of community problems. Completion of a one-year principal internship program received a 1. 4 composite score, as did the applicant's ability to emphasize a total school program. A mean score of 1. 5 was given to the applicant's plans and steps for improving the school. The paragraphs which follow summarize those points that are considered to be of least importance when selecting a principal. Being a native of the city was definitely not considered important in a principal's selection. In addition, two rather unrelated items, being interested in advancement beyond the principalship, and having previous experience as a coach received a low rating of (3. 9). The marital status of the applicant seemed to be of little concern with a composite mean score of (3. 3). Four items received equally low scores of 3. 2, they are as follows: The applicant's position on the salary scale was not important. Is the applicant presently an assistant in the system? Has the applicant written articles for professional journals?Has the candidate been a member of a teacher union?Findings concerning the question of principal evaluation follow. A principal is expected to know his job and have the confidence and respect of his subordinates. He should be a self-starter who is able to complete his work with a minimum of supervision. The principal must have an interest in the student body. He is expected to have a friendly, well-informed office staff. The principal is expected to keep conversations confidential while being firm and fair in his decisions. He should have a positive attitude. Finally, he should encourage his teachers to continue educational growth beyond the minimum requirements needed for the job. Those items which were not considered of significance in evaluating a principal included: dressing in the latest styles, and holding each of the departmental budgets to the same amount as was spent the previous year. Two points were clearly important to those questioned with regard to principal selection. First, an applicant should have demonstrated his leadership ability. Second, he should have a <b>well-rounded</b> <b>personality</b> which can help in working with various groups he will meet as a school principal. No definite pattern of undergraduate major appears to have existed in this study; however, it is interesting to examine the high percentage of principals having either a social studies or physical education background. The educational leadership, skill in public relations, coordination of school activities, and reception to new ideas were all considered important in principal evaluation. Finally, all groups placed performance in meeting requirements of the job high on the list of priorities for a principal. Thesis (Ed. S. ...|$|E
