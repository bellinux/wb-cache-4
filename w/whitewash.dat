5|$|England {{dominated}} the 2004 series and claimed the first English <b>whitewash</b> in the Wisden Trophy's history. England won each Test comfortably, as the West Indian bowlers {{struggled to get}} wickets. Only Chris Gayle and Dwayne Bravo had bowling averages lower than 30. This <b>whitewash</b> meant that England had won seven consecutive Tests {{for the first time}} in 75 years. The series was the beginning of a run that would see England win the Ashes the following year.|$|E

40|$|In {{peer-to-peer}} {{file sharing}} network, {{it is hard}} to distinguish between a legitimate newcomer and a whitewasher. This makes <b>whitewashing</b> a big problem in peer-to-peer networks. Although the problem of <b>whitewashing</b> can be solved using permanent identities, it may take away the right of anonymity for users. In this paper, we a have proposed a novel algorithm to avoid this problem when network uses free temporary identities. In this algorithm, the initial reputation is adjusted according to the level of <b>whitewashing</b> in the network...|$|R

5|$|He {{ended the}} 2006–07 Ashes with {{a century and}} two fifties, totalling 229 runs at 45.80 at a strike rate of over 100 as Australia regained the Ashes with a 5–0 <b>whitewash.</b> It was an {{inconsistent}} series; aside from three scores mentioned, Gilchrist failed to pass one in his other three innings. Between Ashes series, Gilchrist had averaged only 25 with one Test century.|$|E
5|$|In the 2007 competition, the African XI {{suffered}} a 3–0 <b>whitewash,</b> losing {{the first two}} matches by 34 and 31 runs respectively. Despite half-centuries from AB de Villiers, Justin Kemp and Shaun Pollock in the final ODI {{they went on to}} lose by 13 runs.|$|E

5|$|The 1984 series {{began with}} Andy Lloyd being {{hit on the}} head, {{resulting}} in his being hospitalised. This {{would prove to be}} a common theme throughout the series, as the English batsmen struggled to cope with the West Indies bouncers. Whenever England threatened, a West Indian player would step up and take control of the match, as when Gordon Greenidge scored 214 after an England declaration to win the second Test. The series was decided at Leeds, where the West Indies gained an unassailable 3–0 lead. The final Test at The Oval saw the West Indies record the only <b>whitewash</b> by a visiting nation in a five Test series. This was the fifth <b>whitewash</b> in Test cricket and the first to be inflicted on England in England.|$|E
5|$|Gilchrist won {{a silver}} medal at the 1998 Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur, the only time cricket {{has been in the}} Commonwealth Games. The matches did not have ODI status, and after winning their first four fixtures, Australia lost the final to South Africa, Gilchrist making 15. He then scored 103 and ended with 190 runs at 63.33 as Australia took a rare 3–0 <b>whitewash</b> on Pakistani soil.|$|E
5|$|Success at the World Cup was {{followed}} by a defeat by Sri Lanka in the final of the Aiwa Cup in August 1999,. Gilchrist was the most successful batsman and wicket-keeper of the tournament, with 231 runs at 46.20. While the Test players battled against Sri Lanka, Gilchrist led Australia A in a limited overs series against India A in Los Angeles. He then scored 60 runs at 20.00 as the Australians completed a 3–0 <b>whitewash</b> of Zimbabwe in October.|$|E

5|$|The {{principal}} {{landmark in}} Middlewich is the Anglican parish church of St Michael and All Angels, parts of which {{date back to}} the 12th century, although the majority was built during the 14th, 15th and 16th centuries. There was a general remodelling of the church during the 19th century, which included removing the <b>whitewash</b> from its interior to reveal the sandstone appearance seen today. The church was the site of fierce fighting in the first and second Battles of Middlewich during the English Civil War.|$|E
5|$|Two home series {{followed}} in the 2001–02 season, a fully drawn (0–0) three match series against New Zealand and a <b>whitewash</b> over South Africa 3–0. Gilchrist scored 118 in the First Test against New Zealand and an unbeaten 83 in the Third Test in Perth as the Australians held on for a draw with three wickets intact. However, Gilchrist did little in the triumph over South Africa, failing to pass 35. He ended the summer Tests with 353 runs at 50.42.|$|E
5|$|Allegations of {{research}} misconduct or improprieties have received substantial press coverage. Professor David Baltimore, a Nobel Laureate, became {{embroiled in a}} misconduct investigation starting in 1986 that led to Congressional hearings in 1991. Professor Ted Postol has accused the MIT administration since 2000 of attempting to <b>whitewash</b> potential research misconduct at the Lincoln Lab facility involving a ballistic missile defense test, though a final investigation into the matter has not been completed. Associate Professor Luk Van Parijs was dismissed in 2005 following allegations of scientific misconduct and found guilty of the same by the United States Office of Research Integrity in 2009.|$|E
40|$|Recent work {{exploring}} the racialization of place tends {{to focus on}} the racialization of marginalized group space. This paper shifts attention toward the racialization of dominant group space, namely, the creation and maintenance of white places. Using the case study of the software workplace, I argue that white places are formed through a process of <b>whitewashing,</b> which simultaneously denies race and superimposes white culture. <b>Whitewashing</b> wields language and invisibility to deny race and promote a particular kind of multiculturalism, while cloaking the workplace in a culture of informality and business politics. The <b>whitewashed</b> workplace, like a <b>whitewashed</b> wall, is seen as colorless rather than white as white culture becomes universalized as high-tech culture. I draw my findings from in-depth interviews on workplace satisfaction, relationships, culture and diversity with black, Asian and white employees in Seattle-area software firms...|$|R

5|$|In the 2007 competition, the Asian XI {{recorded}} a 3–0 <b>whitewash</b> of the Africans – winning {{the first two}} matches by 34 and 31 runs (respectively), the latter helped by Dilhara Fernando recording ODI career best bowling figures of 4/36. In the final match, the Asians fell to 72/5, but following centuries from Mahela Jayawardene (107) and Mahendra Singh Dhoni (139*) – the latter being the highest individual score ever recorded in an Afro-Asia Cup match – they posted a score of 331/8. Despite half-centuries from three of the African batsmen, however, the Asian XI won by 13 runs.|$|E
5|$|Karthik {{was given}} more {{opportunities}} at international level in late-2006 during the ODI tour of South Africa, after Yuvraj Singh was sidelined {{with a knee}} injury, and Karthik was given a spot purely as a batsman following the poor form of Suresh Raina and Mohammad Kaif. Karthik had opened the batting for Tamil Nadu in the previous season in the Ranji Trophy, {{as well as for}} South Zone in the Duleep Trophy. Playing in three of the ODIs, Karthik himself struggled, with 42 runs at an average of 14.00, and a top score of 17 as South Africa took a 50 <b>whitewash.</b>|$|E
5|$|The 1985–86 {{series in}} the West Indies ended in another <b>whitewash</b> with the West Indies winning each Test comfortably, the closest match being a seven wicket victory. Like the {{previous}} series the English batsmen provided little resistance against the West Indian bowlers with only Gower averaging above 30. Poor performances from Botham and Mike Gatting's injury ensured an easy series win for the West Indies. England’s attitude also {{played a part in}} their defeat with big players such as Gower and Botham showing a certain reluctance to net training. The then chairman of selectors Peter May questioned the team's attitude and called for greater resolve, a view that seemed to be shared by the general public at the time.|$|E

5|$|In response, Bangladesh lost Tamim Iqbal for a duck in {{the first}} over, giving debutant Ajmal Shahzad his first ODI wicket from his third ball of the match. Bresnan removed the other Bangladeshi opener in the 10th over, {{the first of his}} four wickets in the match. This wicket brought {{together}} Mushfiqur Rahim and Aftab Ahmed, who both played aggressively, putting on 56 together in the next ten overs, but when Aftab Ahmed was run out looking for a non-existent run, Bangladesh started to struggle. Rahim and Shakib Al Hasan both fell after making good starts and the required run rate started to rise, making a Bangladeshi victory look improbable. Slow scoring between Naeem Islam and Mahmudullah took victory further away, and Bangladesh eventually finished 45 runs short of their target, granting England a series <b>whitewash.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the semi-finals, now best-of-11, Higgins took 73 {{minutes to}} <b>whitewash</b> Murphy 6–0, scoring breaks of 58, 114, 57, 89, and {{completing}} the victory {{with a total}} clearance of 144, the highest break so far. The time of 73 minutes was only two minutes slower than the quickest best-of-11 match—the semi-finals of the 1993 International Open between Hendry and Dave Harold—and Higgins outscored Murphy 566–72. In the first three frames, Murphy managed to score a total of 10 points. In the fourth, Murphy broke down on a break of 50 before Higgins fluked a yellow, enabling {{him to make a}} 57 break. He then fortuitously snooked Murphy on the pink, which Higgins potted to make it 4–0. An 89 break extended Higgins' lead, before he finished the match with a 144 break. Higgins attributed his performance to a shortening of his cue.|$|E
5|$|Playing {{his first}} Test in the West Indies since his debut series, Kohli scored 200 {{in the first}} Test at Antigua to ensure an innings-and-92-run win for India, their biggest win ever outside of Asia. It was his first double hundred in {{first-class}} cricket and the first made away from home by an Indian captain in Tests. India went on to wrap the series 2–0 and briefly top the ICC Test Rankings before being displaced by Pakistan at the position. He scored another double hundred–211 at Indore in the third Test against New Zealand–as India's 3–0 <b>whitewash</b> victory saw them regain the top position in the ICC Test Rankings. In the subsequent ODI series, Kohli set up two wins for India batting second with unbeaten knocks of 85 at Dharamsala and 134-ball 154 at Mohali, his second highest ODI score. He then made 65 in the series-deciding fifth game at Visakhapatnam which India won.|$|E
