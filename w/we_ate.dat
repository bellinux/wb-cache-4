500|$|Although she {{has been}} criticised by SNP {{politicians}} for taking a [...] "Blairite" [...] stance on public services, The Guardians Peter Hetherington has described Lamont as [...] "rooted to older [...] party values, with a deep commitment to fairness". Her politics were heavily influenced by her inner city upbringing and her career in teaching. Her childhood experience was something she addressed in an emotional speech to delegates at the 2013 Scottish Labour Party Conference: [...] "I saw in my upbringing the beauty of our land and felt both the warmth of community and the harshness and brutality at times {{of trying to make}} a living here. I had the privilege to grow up in a family of love, but one where my mother always reminded me that what <b>we</b> <b>ate,</b> what we wore, where we lived, was all the product of the sweat of my father's brow earned at sea. And I respected that." ...|$|E
500|$|Acting Mayor Feinstein, Supervisor Carol Ruth Silver, and Milk's {{successor}} Harry Britt {{condemned the}} jury's decision. When {{it was announced}} over the police radio in the city, someone sang [...] "Danny Boy" [...] on the police band. A surge {{of people from the}} Castro District walked again to City Hall, chanting [...] "Avenge Harvey Milk" [...] and [...] "He got away with murder". Pandemonium rapidly escalated as rocks were hurled at the front doors of the building. Milk's friends and aides tried to stop the destruction, but the mob of more than 3,000 ignored them and lit police cars on fire. They shoved a burning newspaper dispenser through the broken doors of City Hall, then cheered as the flames grew. One of the rioters responded to a reporter's question about why they were destroying parts of the city: [...] "Just tell people that <b>we</b> <b>ate</b> too many Twinkies. That's why this is happening." [...] The chief of police ordered the police not to retaliate, but to hold their ground. The White Night riots, as they became known, lasted several hours.|$|E

500|$|For Stampede, {{the members}} went to drummer Vinnie Paul's Texas home studio, for a {{recording}} process draped in a relaxed, pressure-free atmosphere, {{surrounded by the}} obligatory cocktails, good eats and familial brotherhood. [...] "We were doing it at my house solely. <b>We</b> <b>ate,</b> drank and BBQed together, which made the brotherhood that happened, come through in the music," [...] Paul said. The band members lived in bungalows on the grounds and turned Paul's house into a studio. Drums were recorded downstairs and guitars were recorded upstairs, with video screens in each room so the members could see one another while tracking. [...] "It’s a broad, diverse album that covers rock, heavy metal and Southern rock ground. That is {{the main thing that}} I like about it: it’s not so focused on one thing," [...] Paul said. The high ceilings at the Paul home allowed {{for the creation of a}} big, booming sound. They also were able to work at their own natural pace. [...] "We slept there, so if one of us just came up with an idea, we could jump on it," [...] guitarist Tom Maxwell said.|$|E
2500|$|Jones {{grew up in}} a {{house on}} Foxdenton Lane, {{surrounded}} by two farms and their fields and commented that one of her earliest memories is of [...] "cows looking in the window as <b>we</b> <b>ate</b> our tea". As a child she was talkative, and later recounted that her priest would say to her: [...] "I'm praying you can concentrate just a bit more". Jones suffers from [...] "wristphobia" [...] (fear of [...] wrists), which she believes possibly developed from viewing imagery of Christ's crucifixion and stigmata as a child.|$|E

2500|$|Rav and Samuel debated how to {{interpret}} the report of [...] that the Israelites complained: [...] "We remember the fish, which <b>we</b> <b>ate</b> in Egypt for free." [...] One read [...] "fish" [...] literally, while the other read [...] "fish" [...] to mean the illicit intercourse that they were [...] "free" [...] to have {{when they were in}} Egypt, before the commandments of Sinai. Rabbi Ammi and Rabbi Assi disputed the meaning of the report of [...] that the Israelites remembered the cucumbers, melons, leeks, onions, and garlic of Egypt. One said that manna had the taste of every kind of food except these five; while the other said that manna had both the taste and the substance of all foods except these, for which manna had only the taste without the substance.|$|E
2500|$|Hansen {{obtained}} his bachelor's {{degree in}} animal science from UW in 1934. While {{at the university}} {{he was in the}} Epsilon Delta Chapter of Sigma Nu fraternity. He was a UW trustee from 1946 to 1966 and was the trustee board president from 1955 until 1962, when he resigned to run for governor. From 1943-1951, he was a Teton county commissioner. He opposed enlarging park lands in Wyoming at the expense of ranchers, who would lose revenue from hunting and guiding if private holdings came under government ownership. As owner of the Spring Gulch Ranch, Hansen was active in several agricultural and ranching groups, having served from 1953-1955 as president of the influential interest group, the Wyoming Stockgrowers Association. He was {{also a member of the}} American National Cattlemen's Association. Ironically, Hansen never tasted beef until he was a student at UW. [...] "Beef is what we produced. <b>We</b> <b>ate</b> deer and elk," [...] he later recalled.|$|E
2500|$|As {{recently}} as the 1970s, most animals were fed local crops, and the animals’ wastes were returned to the fields as fertilizer. Today most U.S. animals are fed crops grown hundreds of miles away, making it “uneconomical” to return the manure. The solution? Require CAFO owners to treat their wastes, just as municipalities must do with human wastes. Further, if <b>we</b> <b>ate</b> less meat, less waste would be generated and less synthetic fertilizer {{would be needed to}} grow animal feed. Eating meat from animals that are range-fed on perennial grasses would be ideal. The explosive growth in the production of ethanol as a biofuel is greatly aggravating nitrogen pollution. Several studies have suggested that if mandated U.S. ethanol targets are met, the amount of nitrogen flowing down the Mississippi River and fueling the Gulf of Mexico dead zone may increase by 30 to 40 percent. The best alternative would be to forgo the production of ethanol from corn. If the country wants to rely on biofuels, it should instead grow grasses and trees and burn these to co-generate heat and electricity; nitrogen pollution and greenhouse gas emissions would be much lower." ...|$|E

After the Leaves <b>we</b> <b>eat</b> and the Staples <b>we</b> <b>eat,</b> this manual describes well-known tropical fruits banana, pineapple, citrus, coconut and mango and local favourites such as kavika, nandau and wi. The fruits <b>we</b> <b>eat</b> discusses the value of fruits, and their taste, smell, texture and nutritional qualities. Some 27 fruits are described, illustrated together with their respective uses and common preparations. Another chapter compares their composition and nutritional value, before a concluding glimpse at the future and potential of fruits in the Pacific are briefly set out. Compiled by the Secretariat of the Pacific Community, this is a useful booklet for people {{working in the field}} of food and nutrition, health, agriculture and extension or education.

He gets it, and then the cannibals eat him. The Frenchman asks for three girls. He has crazy sex with them, and then suffers {{the fate of the}} German. The Russian demands: [...] "Hit me hard, right on my nose!" [...] The chief is surprised, but hits him. The Russian pulls out a Kalashnikov and shoots all the cannibals.
