40|$|Five foliar {{insecticide}} treatments (Esteem, Provado, Applaud, Assail, and Danitol + Lorsban) {{were evaluated}} for their control of early <b>woolly</b> <b>whitefly</b> infestations in lemons. Esteem and Applaud are insect growth regulators {{that should have}} little impact on whitefly parasitoids. The impact of Provado and Assail on whitefly parasitoids is not certain, but at high rates may be detrimental, while Danitol + Lorsban will be especially harmful to parasitoids. The impact of these insecticides on <b>woolly</b> <b>whitefly</b> could not be fully determined in this trial due {{to the effectiveness of}} parasitoids, Eretmocerus comperei or E. dozieri (exact species not certain), on controlling the whiteflies in this test. However, other research (not reported here) has indicated that all of the insecticide treatments evaluated have good activity against <b>woolly</b> <b>whitefly.</b> Because parasitoids can be extremely effective in mitigating woolly whiteflies populations during the early phases of colonization, it is recommended that chemical control not be utilized until <b>woolly</b> <b>whitefly</b> colonies are common. However, previous experiences suggest that allowing <b>woolly</b> <b>whitefly</b> populations develop extremely high populations should be avoided...|$|E
40|$|Four foliar {{insecticides}} (Esteem, Provado, Applaud and Assail) and one soil {{systemic insecticide}} (Admire) were evaluated for their control of <b>woolly</b> <b>whitefly</b> in lemons. These insecticides {{were chosen for}} evaluation because they have demonstrated efficacy to other whitefly species and {{have little or no}} impact on whitefly parasitoids. Admire was injected with a single shank about 5 -in deep around each tree approximately at the tree’s drip line. All of the foliar insecticides were effective in controlling <b>woolly</b> <b>whitefly.</b> Admire also appeared to have efficacy, but due to inconsistent data on one sample date more testing should be conducted. Six weeks after the beginning of this test, whitefly parasitoids, Eretmocerus comperei or E. dozieri (exact species not certain) reduced the whitefly population across all treatments. Within two more months, no live whiteflies could be found in the test grove, and as of July 15, 2002, there was still no detectable <b>woolly</b> <b>whitefly</b> activity...|$|E

40|$|Eight foliar {{insecticide}} treatment regimes (single applications of Esteem, Danitol + Lorsban, Applaud, Provado and Prev-am, and two applications of Applaud, Provado, and Prev-Am) were evaluated for management of <b>woolly</b> <b>whitefly</b> infestations in grapefruit. All {{of these products}} demonstrated efficacy in mitigating <b>woolly</b> <b>whitefly</b> populations. Danitol + Lorsban {{appeared to be the}} best knock-down treatment evaluated, but Provado and Prev-Am also demonstrated good activity. For sustained control, all of the treatments were effective; however, Prev-Am required an additional application to achieve equivalent control. Soil injections of 16 and 32 fl-oz/ac of Admire were very effective against WWF, and there were no detectable differences between the two rates. The Admire appeared to require about 27 days after injection to demonstrate consistent activity...|$|E
40|$|Esteem was {{evaluated}} for its efficacy towards <b>woolly</b> <b>whitefly</b> in grapefruit and Minneola tangelos. Esteem was efficacious, {{but because of}} spray coverage problems on large trees, failed to offer complete control.

40|$|M- 96 - 015 did {{not appear}} to {{effectively}} control <b>woolly</b> <b>whitefly</b> but does appear to kill citrus mealybug. However, as with other insecticides coverage is a problem. The real benefit of M- 96 - 015 towards citrus mealybug would occur if it prevented their spread. However, {{we were not able to}} measure this in this study. As with previous trials, M- 96 - 015 is an effective citrus thrips material...|$|E
40|$|Five foliar {{insecticide}} treatments (Esteem, two {{rates of}} Provado, two rates of Applaud, Prev-am, and Danitol + Lorsban) were evaluated for their control of <b>woolly</b> <b>whitefly</b> infestations in grapefruit. All {{of these products}} demonstrated efficacy in mitigating <b>woolly</b> <b>whitefly</b> populations. Danitol + Lorsban was the best knock-down treatment evaluated, but for sustained control, Esteem appeared to be most effective. Applaud demonstrated good activity, but the rate we tested {{may be a little}} low; the 1. 0 lb/ac rate should be evaluated. Provado at 19 oz/ac was a good treatment, while the 10 oz/ac rate appears to be sub-par. Prev-am is a oil based contact material and demonstrated good initial activity. Soil injections of 16 and 32 oz/ac of Admire were very effective against WWF, and there were no detectable differences between the two rates. Previous experiments with soil injections of Admire in citrus suggested that as much as six weeks needs to pass before the trees have enough time to adequately take up the Admire from the soil. However, these data suggest that smaller trees, about 10 ft tall, may require as little as two weeks to pick up the material...|$|E

40|$|Calesinae is a {{small group}} of chalcidoid wasps that, for species with known host associations, are parasitoids of whiteflies (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae). Prior to this study, Cales {{diversity}} included one species in the Neotropical region (Cales noacki, introduced from South America into citrus growing regions of North America, the Mediterranean and tropical Africa for biological control of <b>woolly</b> <b>whitefly),</b> and two species from Australia (Cales spenceri and Cales orchamoplati). The morphological study emphasizes the likely plesiomorphic Australian species, and includes a description of a new species from New Zealand reared from the whitefly Asterochiton pittospori. Cales shares many characteristics with Aphelinidae, though additional studies of character systems across Chalcidoidea are needed to determine the likely sister taxon. 	Studies of the Neotropical Cales fauna reveal far greater diversity than previously thought. Twenty-one new species are described, and a neotype is designated for C. noacki, which is redescribed based on specimens molecularly determined to be conspecific with the neotype. The Neotropical Cales fauna is very morphologically conserved, so species cannot always be determined based on morphology alone. Therefore, species boundaries are established using combined evidence from morphology, biogeography, 28 S-D 2 - 5 rDNA and a 390 bp fragment of the cytochrome oxidase c subunit I (COI) gene. A molecular phylogeny and separate identification keys to male and female species are provided. 	The molecular phylogenetic studies of Cales revealed that two molecularly distinct but morphologically cryptic species were introduced into California for control of <b>woolly</b> <b>whitefly</b> in citrus. The most common of the two was determined to be C. noacki, which molecularly matched specimens from Chile, and the second was newly described as Cales rosei, which did not molecularly match any of the specimens collected from Central or South American. We employ multivariate analyses of fore wing shape combined with biological control importation and release records to infer the likely source locality for C. rosei. The analyses support a Chilean origin of C. noacki. In addition, the wing shapes of molecularly-determined C. rosei specimens most closely matched biological control specimens collected near Buenos Aires, Argentina, indicating that this is the likely source locality for this species...|$|E
