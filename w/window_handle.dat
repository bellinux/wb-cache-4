2500|$|Windows XP {{introduced}} a new filter called the Video Mixing Renderer 7 (VMR-7 or sometimes just referred to as VMR). The number 7 was because VMR-7 only used DirectDraw version 7 to render the video {{and did not have}} the option to use GDI drawing. The main new feature of VMR-7 was the ability to mix multiple streams and graphics with alpha blending, allowing applications to draw text and graphics over the video and support custom effects. It also featured a [...] "windowless mode" [...] (access to the composited image before it is rendered) which fixed the problems with access to the <b>window</b> <b>handle.</b> VMR-7 was only officially released for Windows XP.|$|E

50|$|A <b>window</b> <b>handle</b> {{is a short}} {{length of}} {{material}} that attaches to a window in order to aid rotation of the hinge and therefore opening and closing of the window. It often contains holes allowing the window to be fastened into place onto a spike at a distance preferred by the operator of the device allowing for outside air to circulate into the room, removing {{the need for the}} operator to have to hold the handle permanently at that distance in order to enjoy this benefit.|$|E
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of June 2007 Graeme found some major design issues in the source base. This prevented fpGUI from being truly useful in real applications. After numerous prototypes the fpGUI project was completely rewritten. Past experience helped a lot and new design ideas were implemented. The code base ended up being much simpler with a cleaner design. One of the major changes was that all widgets were now based on a multi-handle (windowed) design. Each widget now has a <b>window</b> <b>handle.</b> Other GUI toolkits that follow a similar design are GTK, Xt and FLTK to name a few. GUI toolkits that follow the opposite design are toolkits like the latest Qt and MSEgui.|$|E

50|$|Windows Vista {{introduces}} Mandatory Integrity Control to set integrity {{levels for}} processes. A low integrity process can not access {{the resources of}} a higher integrity process. This feature {{is being used to}} enforce application isolation, where applications in a medium integrity level, such as all applications running in the standard user context can not hook into system level processes which run in high integrity level, such as administrator mode applications but can hook onto lower integrity processes like Windows Internet Explorer 7 or 8. A lower privilege process cannot perform a <b>window</b> <b>handle</b> validation of higher process privilege, cannot SendMessage or PostMessage to higher privilege application windows, cannot use thread hooks to attach to a higher privilege process, cannot use Journal hooks to monitor a higher privilege process and cannot perform DLL-injection to a higher privilege process.|$|E
40|$|This Paper a new socket class which {{supports}} both TCP and UDP communication. But it provide s some advantages {{compared to other}} classes that you may find here or on some other Socket Programming papers. First of all, this class doesn't have any limitation like {{the need to provide}} a <b>window</b> <b>handle</b> to be used. This limitation is bad if all you want is a simple console application. So this library doesn't have such a limitation. It also provides threading support automatically for you, which handles the socket connection and disconnection to a peer. It also features some options not yet found in any s ocket classes that I have seen so far. It supports both client and server sockets. A server socket can be referred as to a socket that can accept many connections. And a client socket is a socket that is connected to server socket. You may still use this c lass to communicate between two applications without establishing a connection. In the latter case, you will want to create two UDP server sockets (one for each application). This class also helps reduce coding need to create chat - like applications and IPC (Inter - Process Communication) between two or more applications (processes). Reliable communication between two peers is also supported with TCP/IP with error handling. You may want to use the smart addressing operation to control the destination of the da ta being transmitted (UDP only). TCP operation of this class deals only with communication between two peers...|$|E

Upon initialization, it sets up a separate execution environment, takes over the CPU, and encapsulates Windows as the lowest priority iRMX task.

50|$|In the XVI—XIX centuries {{the best}} {{furniture}} {{was made of}} Ceylon ebony. The wood was preferred for making door and <b>window</b> <b>handles,</b> table-ware shanks, while the cutting was used for knitting needles and hooks or razor handles making. Today the wood is perfectly used in handmade artwork and for producing some parts of musical instruments (for example, grand piano keys, necks, string holders and tripods for instruments), turnery (including chess pieces), knife hafts, brush holders and chopsticks. Also {{it is good for}} mosaic wooden inlay.|$|R
5000|$|The message-passing {{architecture}} {{allows the}} core API to manage many system functions by sending messages on {{all sorts of}} events, like window creation, painting needed, moving, etc. By default, the associated <b>window</b> <b>handling</b> function gets a [...] "first pass" [...] at the message, and then calls the DefWindowProc function, which handles default actions for all the messages. In this way, all windows can behave the same way when dragged, etc., unless specifically overridden by the user. Major window management policies can be redefined by merely re-implementing DefWindowProc, rather than making changes throughout the system.|$|R

50|$|The {{fundamental}} communications {{mechanism in}} the Microwindows API is the message. A message {{consists of a}} well-known message number, and two parameters, known as wParam and lParam. Messages are stored in an application's message-queue, and retrieved via the GetMessage function. The application blocks while waiting for a message. There are messages that correspond to hardware events, like WM_CHAR for keyboard input or WM_LBUTTONDOWN for mouse button down. In addition, events signaling window creation and destruction WM_CREATE and WM_DESTROY are sent. In most cases, a message {{is associated with a}} window, identified as an HWND. After retrieving the message, the application sends the message to the associated <b>window's</b> <b>handling</b> procedure using DispatchMessage. When a window class is created, its associated message handling procedure is specified, so the system knows where to send the message.|$|R

40|$|A Nitpicker’s {{guide to}} a minimal-complexity secure GUI Malware such as Trojan Horses and spyware {{remain to be}} {{persistent}} security threats that exploit the overly complex graphical user interfaces of today’s commodity operating systems.

We describe our approach of kernelizing the window server and present the deployed security mechanisms and protocols. Our implementation comprises only 1, 500 lines of code while supporting commodity software such as X 11 applications alongside protected graphical security applications. We discuss key techniques such as client-side <b>window</b> <b>handling,</b> a new floating-labels mechanism, dragand-drop, and denial-of-service-preventing resource management. Furthermore, we present an application scenario to evaluate the feasibility, performance, and usability of our approach. ...|$|R
50|$|Palm OS and 16-bit Windows use {{a similar}} scheme for memory management, but the Palm and Windows {{versions}} make programmer error more difficult. For instance, in Mac OS, to convert a handle to a pointer, a program just de-references the handle directly, {{but if the}} handle is not locked, the pointer can become invalid quickly. Calls to lock and unlock handles are not balanced; ten calls to HLock are undone by a single call to HUnlock. In Palm OS and <b>Windows,</b> <b>handles</b> are an opaque type and must be de-referenced with MemHandleLock on Palm OS or Global/LocalLock on Windows. When a Palm or Windows application is finished with a handle, it calls MemHandleUnlock or Global/LocalUnlock. Palm OS and Windows keep a lock count for blocks; after three calls to MemHandleLock, a block will only become unlocked after three calls to MemHandleUnlock.|$|R
