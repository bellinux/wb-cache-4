40|$|I analyze how {{representative}} institutions affect policymaker preferences {{over the}} level of the domestic exchange rate. In the first chapter, I use cross-country survey data to test whether firm managers have strong concerns about the volatility and value of the exchange rate. I find that exchange rate volatility is a far more consistent concern for managers than the value of the domestic currency. In the second chapter, I develop a theory which argues that policymakers in autocratic settings are more likely than those in democracies to maintain misaligned exchange rates and that the direction of preferred misalignment will depend on the political power of the tradables sector. The cross-county regression analysis supports the claims that democracies {{are more likely to have}} equilibrium exchange rates and that autocracies with small tradables sectors are more likely to have overvalued currencies. In the final substantive chapter, I provide strong evidence that East Asian governments have manipulated the <b>weights</b> <b>of</b> <b>currencies</b> in their exchange rate basket policies in pursuit of maintaining the competitiveness of their currencie...|$|E
40|$|In May 2007, Kuwait {{unilaterally}} {{abandoned the}} dollar peg, adopted in 2003 {{as a first}} step towards the monetary integration of GCC countries, to return to the previous basket peg system. The decision was motivated by the need to limit the inflationary pressures resulting from prolonged depreciation of the dollar against major currencies. Given the importance the anti-inflationary objective had in this choice, the work focuses on the peculiarities of Kuwait’s economy, justifying and reviewing the price dynamics in the light of re-pegging to the basket, in the belief that its composition has been affected by inflationary trends. To this end, an econometric model "Auto-Regressive Moving Average" is proposed to define the <b>weights</b> <b>of</b> <b>currencies</b> in the basket and the estimate shows that Euro’s has increased during the period, consistent with the goals against inflation.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the changes caused by the implementations of currency basket peg and floating exchange regime on domestic foreign exchange market dynamics through the estimation of weights for the reserve currencies in the currency basket. Elasticity coefficients of Turkish Lira against seven currencies were estimated for two sampling periods (1995 : 01 - 1999 : 07 and 2002 : 01 - 2008 : 01) using generalized vector autoregression method. The study focuses on Turkish economy. The scope of the study represents a quite new field of investigation which is analyzed only to a limited extent in the literature. The main contribution of the study was that the study extended the empirical model which was taken as a basis in the majority of the studies on currency basket and the analyses which estimated using vector autoregression method whose sampling was limited to Asia countries, using generalized impulse response normalization approach. The findings obtained from the first period support the <b>weights</b> <b>of</b> <b>currencies</b> in announced basket of currencies.

40|$|In July 2005 the Chinese {{government}} announced a {{switch to a}} new exchange rate regime. The new exchange rate regime is set with reference to a basket <b>of</b> <b>currency.</b> But the numerical <b>weights</b> <b>of</b> each <b>currency</b> in the basket are unannounced. Under economic and political pressures, China adjusted his exchange rate regime, which {{is no longer a}} peg to the US dollar. Subsequently, with the appreciation of the Chinese Yuan, China allowed a movement of the exchange rate up to 3 % within any given day. Perhaps, the new exchange rate policy has an impact on the imports and exports, even other countries' exchange rate policy, the international imbalance and financial market. We argue that China is not really conducting the basket <b>of</b> <b>currency</b> policy after the reform. The Chinese government released the composition <b>of</b> basket <b>currencies</b> and the determinant <b>of</b> <b>currency</b> <b>weights.</b> But the exact weights are still unknown. The methodology and results of this paper are easily summarized. First of all, we use the technique introduced by Frankel and Wei (1994) to estimate the currency weights. We find that the Euro and Japanese Yen are insignificant in the basket in terms <b>of</b> numeraire <b>currency,</b> the Swiss Franc and Special Drawing Rights. The results from Ordinary Linear Square show that China's exchange rate regime remains a peg to the US dollar tightly, because the <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> the US dollar is in exceed of 0. 9. Then, following the regression results, we do F-test, rolling and recursive regression for the basket currencies. Moreover, we use Kalman Filter and Smooth method to test the significance of coefficient <b>of</b> each <b>currency.</b> We find that there is a slight decline of the coefficient, but it has no economic influence. Furthermore, we use Structural Break and Outlier method to test the significance of the coefficient <b>of</b> the <b>currencies.</b> The results show that the US dollar peg is still strong. That's to say, although China is conducting the new exchange rate regime gradually, the exchange rate policy is not a perfect peg to a basket <b>of</b> <b>currency...</b>|$|R

On the one hand, the automatic component of the adjustment of the exchange rate of dirham: slipping according to the inflation differential between Morocco and its partners has been abandoned; domestic inflation has been stabilized at a level comparable to that of developed economies. On the other hand, the substitution <b>of</b> European national <b>currencies</b> by the euro, synonymous with a decrease in the variety <b>of</b> <b>currencies</b> used in the composition of the basket, the tradeoff between stabilizing the debt burden and maintaining external competitiveness vis-à-vis European trade partners, have led the monetary Moroccan authorities to diversify the composition of the basket by introducing new currencies outside the European area, it is the British Pound and perhaps Franc Switzerland. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{methodology}} of {{building up a}} dollar index capturing the appropriate <b>weights</b> <b>of</b> different <b>currencies</b> <b>of</b> trading partners has been challenged. This paper tries to suggest a methodological improvement. The authors employ multivariate statistical techniques to identify appropriate financial and economic weights based on variables that are more relevant and attempts to use those variables to suggest an alternative dollar index that would gauge more accurately the movements in the currency market. Cronbach's (1951) alpha {{is also used to}} estimate {{the internal consistency of the}} proposed index's components. Our proposed index is based on 12 indicators. We calculate the average inter-item correlation, and alpha reliability coefficient. By calculating the inter-item correlations among the 12 component variables, we study the variables in the expected direction, and statistically significant relationships at the 0. 05 level. We then remove the variable which has statistically insignificant relationship. The process works as follows: first, we aggregate the 12 objective indicators to construct a dollar index with equal weight, then, for constructing the dollar index we choose the appropriate weights by allowing them to be determined by the statistical procedure of principal components to determine the weights for an index of the variables. alternative dollar index; currency index; multivariate statistical analysis; international finance; currency movements; financial weights; economic weights; variables. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper conducts an econometric {{examination}} {{on changes}} in foreign exchange policies of China and Asia before and after China's policy changes in July 2005. Foreign exchange policies in China and Asia are {{an important component of}} global issues connected with international finance. Before July 2005, policies in China and some other Asian countries were based on de facto, fixed exchange rates systems against the U. S. dollar (dollar-peg). A rise in the current-account surplus and massive currency intervention in China triggered pressure from other countries and international organizations on China to change its foreign exchange policies. In July 2005, China responded by allowing the yuan to appreciate against the dollar. At the time of the policy changes, the official statement mentioned discarding the dollar-peg and adopting reference to a basket value. Several patterns exist in the foreign exchange policies of emerging Asian countries other than China. Dollar-peg systems were also adopted by Hong Kong (before the Asian Currency Crisis) and Malaysia (from September 1998). Singapore adopted a basket system (the weighted average value <b>of</b> the <b>currencies</b> <b>of</b> its main trading partners) even before the Asian Currency Crisis. After the Asian crisis, several countries including Thailand and Korea adopted flexible exchange rate regimes. Interventions, though differing in scale, were also carried out in an effort to stabilize values against the dollar. This report rigorously estimates the <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> basket <b>currencies</b> and examines how the foreign exchange policies of countries other than China were altered before and after China's policy changes. The results show that the foreign exchange policies adopted by China after the July 2005 reform are in no way a basket system; they are instead a crawling peg —gradual appreciation— against the dollar. The degree of appreciation and volatility <b>of</b> most other <b>currencies</b> <b>of</b> emerging Asian economies after the reform has been larger than that of the yuan. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new concept}} – the global roles <b>of</b> <b>currencies.</b> The concept combines the domestic and international (cross-border) use <b>of</b> <b>currencies</b> and therefore captures the overall importance <b>of</b> different <b>currencies</b> in a globalised economy. The measure <b>of</b> a <b>currency’s</b> global role {{is based on the}} size and stage of development of the underlying economy, as well as the size and stage of development of its financial markets and the scope of financial instruments available in this currency. The paper applies the concept to 22 <b>currencies</b> <b>of</b> advanced and emerging economies. The results confirm the well-known ranking for the leading currencies – in particular the US dollar and the euro – but give considerably greater <b>weight</b> to <b>currencies</b> <b>of</b> emerging economies than the results obtained from the international debt market, which has so far been used as the basis for measuring the international role <b>of</b> <b>currencies</b> in capital markets. The paper also discusses this established measure in detail, arguing that in view of financial globalisation, an indicator based on currency shares in the international debt market alone re{{presents a}} decreasing share of international financial market activity, as this market excludes government debt, other domestic debt and equities, which are in- creasingly of interest to international investors. The paper also presents an empirical application of the new global concept to examine cross-border portfolio holdings in debt and equity markets across advanced and emerging economies. It finds that the global role indicator is positively correlated with such holdings and, especially for emerging economies, fares better than the established international debt market indicator. The findings suggest a positive relationship between domestic financial development and international financial integration.

In this paper, we propose a gold price index that enables market participants to separate {{the change in the}} ‘intrinsic’ value of gold from changes in global exchange rates. The index is a geometrically weighted average of the price of gold denominated in different currencies, with weights that are proportional to the market power of each country in the global gold market. Market power is defined as the impact that a change in a country’s exchange rate has on the price of gold expressed in other currencies. We use principal components analysis to reduce the set of global exchange rates to four currency ‘blocs’ representing the U. S. dollar, the euro, the commodity currencies and the Asian currencies, respectively. We estimate the <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> each <b>currency</b> bloc in the index in an error correction framework using a broad set of variables to control for the unobserved intrinsic value.
