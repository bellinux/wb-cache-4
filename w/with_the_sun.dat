5|$|Hemingway wrote {{more books}} about bullfighting: Death in the Afternoon was {{published}} in 1932 and The Dangerous Summer was published posthumously in 1985. His depictions of Pamplona, beginning <b>with</b> <b>The</b> <b>Sun</b> Also Rises, helped to popularize the annual running of the bulls at the Festival of St. Fermin.|$|E
5|$|Less {{favorable}} oppositions during late autumn 2008 in the Northern Hemisphere {{still had}} Vesta at a magnitude of from +6.5 to +7.3. Even when in conjunction <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun,</b> Vesta {{will have a}} magnitude around +8.5; thus from a pollution-free sky it can be observed with binoculars even at elongations much smaller than near opposition.|$|E
5|$|Most short-period comets {{belong to}} the Jupiter family—defined as comets with semi-major axes smaller than Jupiter's. Jupiter family comets are thought to form in the Kuiper belt outside the orbit of Neptune. During close {{encounters}} with Jupiter their orbits are perturbed into a smaller period and then circularized by regular gravitational interaction <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> and Jupiter.|$|E
50|$|Johnson {{became a}} force with Phoenix as he {{averaged}} 14.0 {{points per game}} in his {{three and a half}} seasons <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Suns,</b> becoming a clutch three-point shooter as he averaged 39.3% from the three-point arc during his tenure <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Suns.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>Suns</b> having 23 {{different}} players getting {{playing time}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> team {{at one point}} or another in the season, it tied <b>the</b> 1996-97 Phoenix <b>Suns</b> season for most amount of players to play at least one game <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Suns</b> in a single season. That mark would then be matched once again next season, although for different reasons.|$|R
50|$|In March 2009, Majstrovich signed <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Kalamunda Eastern <b>Suns</b> for <b>the</b> 2009 SBL season. In November 2009, he re-signed <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Suns</b> for <b>the</b> 2010 season.|$|R
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the Solar System's {{existence}} the orbits of comets are unstable and eventually dynamics dictate that a comet must either collide <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> or a planet or else be ejected from the Solar System by planetary perturbations.|$|E
5|$|Temperatures on {{the surface}} have been {{estimated}} to lie between about −20°C <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> overhead, dropping to about −190°C at the winter pole. Typical daytime and nighttime temperatures are −60°C and −130°C respectively. This estimate is for 6 May 1996, very close to perihelion, although details vary somewhat with the seasons.|$|E
5|$|Along <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun,</b> the {{gravitational}} influence of Jupiter has {{helped shape the}} Solar System. The orbits {{of most of the}} system's planets lie closer to Jupiter's orbital plane than the Sun's equatorial plane (Mercury is the only planet that is closer to the Sun's equator in orbital tilt), the Kirkwood gaps in the asteroid belt are mostly caused by Jupiter, and the planet may have been responsible for the Late Heavy Bombardment of the inner Solar System's history.|$|E

5|$|As he {{indicated}} in the title, Kepler thought he had revealed God's geometrical plan for the universe. Much of Kepler's enthusiasm for the Copernican system stemmed from his theological convictions about {{the connection between the}} physical and the spiritual; the universe itself was an image of God, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> corresponding to the Father, the stellar sphere to the Son, and the intervening space between to the Holy Spirit. His first manuscript of Mysterium contained an extensive chapter reconciling heliocentrism with biblical passages that seemed to support geocentrism.|$|E
5|$|Earth is {{estimated}} to have formed 4.54billion years ago from the solar nebula, along <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> and other planets. The moon formed roughly 20million years later. Initially molten, the outer layer of the Earth cooled, resulting in the solid crust. Outgassing and volcanic activity produced the primordial atmosphere. Condensing water vapor, {{most or all of}} which came from ice delivered by comets, produced the oceans and other water sources. The highly energetic chemistry is believed to have produced a self-replicating molecule around 4billion years ago.|$|E
5|$|Following {{completion}} and registration, the Rudyard Kipling began fishing {{off of the}} coast of Ireland and Great Britain. In May 1934, the trawler was sold to The Sun Steam Trawling Co Ltd. On 10 May, her registry from Hull was closed and on 16 May, she was registered in the English port town of Fleetwood, where her new owners were based. The Rudyard Kipling remained <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> Steam Trawling Co Ltd. {{for the rest of}} her career.|$|E

50|$|On February 19, 2015, Thornton was traded, {{along with}} a 2016 first-round pick, to <b>the</b> Phoenix <b>Suns</b> in {{exchange}} for Isaiah Thomas. He completed <b>the</b> 2014-15 season <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Suns</b> playing in just nine games. He did not manage game time in 18 of a possible 27 games <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Suns,</b> largely thanks to an Achilles' tendon injury and being a non-rotation player on a non-playoff team.|$|R
50|$|On January 18, Barbosa {{signed a}} second 10-day {{contract}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Suns.</b> He'd {{make his first}} home debut <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Suns</b> in over 4 years a day later in a 117-103 blowout victory against the Denver Nuggets. During his second 10-day contract, Barbosa's best performance came on January 24 at home against the Washington Wizards, where he would score 10 points against them.|$|R
5|$|From {{at least}} the 4th Dynasty of Ancient Egypt, the Sun was worshipped as the god Ra, portrayed as a falcon-headed divinity surmounted by the solar disk, and {{surrounded}} by a serpent. In the New Empire period, the Sun became identified with the dung beetle, whose spherical ball of dung was identified <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun.</b> In {{the form of the}} Sun disc Aten, the Sun had a brief resurgence during the Amarna Period when it again became the preeminent, if not only, divinity for the Pharaoh Akhenaton.|$|E
5|$|Hale–Bopp became {{visible to}} the naked eye in May 1996, and {{although}} its rate of brightening slowed considerably during the latter half of that year, scientists were still cautiously optimistic that it would become very bright. It was too closely aligned <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> to be observable during December 1996, but when it reappeared in January 1997 it was already bright enough to be seen by anyone who looked for it, even from large cities with light-polluted skies.|$|E
5|$|In an {{animated}} segment of this episode, Tyson discusses {{the life and}} vision of the 16th-century Italian philosopher Giordano Bruno (voiced by Seth MacFarlane) {{as the person who}} championed a much more expansive understanding of the Earth's place in the universe, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> being just one star among all the others. Later, he presents the history of the Universe on Carl Sagan's Cosmic Calendar. The episode ends with Tyson's brief speech about Carl Sagan's life and career, and how Sagan inspired him to become an astrophysicist.|$|E
50|$|On October 29, 2016, Eddie was reacquired by the Austin Spurs. On January 25, 2017, he {{was traded}} to the Windy City Bulls in {{exchange}} for Hollis Thompson. On March 19, 2017, Eddie signed a 10-day contract <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Phoenix <b>Suns.</b> He made his debut for <b>the</b> <b>Suns</b> later that day, playing 29 minutes and scoring 13 points with two three-pointers in a 112-95 loss to the Detroit Pistons. On March 29, 2017, he signed a second 10-day contract <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Suns.</b> He parted ways <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Suns</b> following <b>the</b> expiration of his second 10-day contract.|$|R

5|$|In the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of 1906, {{the lion}} and sun motif in {{the flag of}} Iran was {{described}} as a passant lion that holds a saber in its paw and <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> in its background. A decree dated September 4, 1910 specified the exact details of the logo, including the lion's tail ("like an italic S"), the position {{and the size of the}} lion, his paw, the sword, and the sun.|$|E
5|$|In total 283 magical spells, {{also known}} as utterances, were carved and the signs painted blue {{on the walls of}} the corridor, antechamber, and burial chamber of Unas' pyramid. They {{constitute}} the most complete rendition of the Pyramid Texts existing today. These spells were intended to help the king in overcoming hostile forces and powers in the Underworld and thus join <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> god Ra, his divine father in the afterlife. By writing the texts {{on the walls of the}} pyramid internal chambers, the architects of Unas' pyramid ensured that the king would benefit from their potency even if the funerary cult was to cease.|$|E
5|$|Kepler was {{the first}} to devise a system that {{described}} correctly the details of the motion of the planets <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> at the center. However, Kepler did not succeed in formulating a theory behind the laws he wrote down. It was left to Newton's invention of celestial dynamics and his law of gravitation to finally explain the motions of the planets. Newton also developed the reflecting telescope.|$|E
50|$|On October 24, <b>the</b> <b>Suns</b> claimed veteran swingman John Wetzel off of waivers {{from the}} Atlanta Hawks. Wetzel would play {{sparingly}} throughout the season, averaging 6.7 minutes in 37 regular season games, and 2.5 minutes in two playoff games. Wetzel had played for <b>the</b> <b>Suns</b> from 1970 to 1972, and would spend his final season <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Suns</b> {{before retiring in}} August 1976. Wetzel would later become an assistant coach <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Suns</b> from 1979 to 1987, before becoming the team's head coach for the 1987-88 season.|$|R
50|$|On July 7, 2017, Jones {{would play}} his first ever NBA Summer League game <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Phoenix <b>Suns.</b> Under <b>the</b> event, he {{recorded}} 7.3 points and 3.5 rebounds in 21.2 minutes {{of action for}} the six games he played <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Suns</b> there.|$|R

5|$|The {{earliest}} scientific {{models of}} the Universe were developed by ancient Greek and Indian philosophers and were geocentric, placing Earth at {{the centre of the}} Universe. Over the centuries, more precise astronomical observations led Nicolaus Copernicus to develop the heliocentric model <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> at the centre of the Solar System. In developing the law of universal gravitation, Sir Isaac Newton built upon Copernicus's work as well as observations by Tycho Brahe and Johannes Kepler's laws of planetary motion.|$|E
5|$|The {{observation}} {{of a total}} solar eclipse of May 29, 1919, helped to confirm Einstein's theory of general relativity. By comparing the apparent distance between stars in the constellation Taurus, with and without the Sun between them, Arthur Eddington stated that the theoretical predictions about gravitational lenses were confirmed. The observation <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> between the stars was only possible during totality since the stars are then visible. Though Eddington's observations were near the experimental limits of accuracy at the time, work in the later half of the 20th century confirmed his results.|$|E
5|$|Torchwood is a British {{science fiction}} drama {{television}} programme, {{part of the}} long-running Doctor Who franchise, which began airing in 2006 on BBC Three. The series explores several themes in its narrative, in particular LGBT themes. Various characters are portrayed as sexually fluid; through those characters, the series examines homosexual and bisexual relationships. Although {{the nature of their}} sexual flexibility is not explicitly discussed, the characters offer varying perspectives on orientation, <b>with</b> <b>The</b> <b>Sun</b> describing all of the characters on Torchwood as bisexual.|$|E
