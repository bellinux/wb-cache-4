40|$|La orden de Montesa fue una orden religiosa militar creada en el siglo XlV. Una amplia zona del norte de la provincia de Castellón se denominó Maestrazgo de Montesa. Y es en estas tierras donde se encuentra una de las iglesias renacentistas más importantes de las tierras valencianas: la parroquial de Vistabella del Maestrazgo, construida a {{principio}}s del siglo XVII. Un exhaustivo levantamiento gráfico arquitectónico realizado tanto con métodos tradicionales, como con modernas tecnologías con escáner 3 d, ha permitido hallar el canon que rige el edificio, ya partir de éste, establecer las proporciones del mismo. Dicho canon o módulo, basado en el palmo valenciano, relaciona las partes entre sí y éstas con el todo, principio plasmado ya por Vitrubio en la antigua Roma y por Alberti en el quattrocento italiano. Esto evidencia que en el edificio no aparecen sólo formas y ornamentos renacentistas, sino también estructuras espaciales, todo ello fruto de la madurez, del conocimiento y de la asimilación del lenguaje del clasicismo que poseía el arquitecto autor de la obra. The Order of Montesa was {{a military}} religious arder founded in the fourteenth century. In {{the north of the}} province of Castellón a wide area was called "el Maestrazgo de Montesa".

A thorough graphical architectural survey, which includes not only traditional methods of analysis, but also modern 3 D scanner technologies, has allowed us to identify the canon governing the building, and from this to determine the proportions of this building. This canon or standard unit of measurement, which is based on the Valencian span, connects the different parts of the building with each other and these with the whole. This principie <b>was</b> <b>already</b> <b>embodied</b> by Vitruvius in ancient Rome and by Alberti in the Italian Quattrocento.

30|$|Another {{important}} delineation in {{the concept}} of economic resilience, and resilience in general, is the distinction between inherent and adaptive resilience (Tierney 2007; Cutter 2016). Inherent resilience refers to resilience capacity already built into the system or that can be “pre-positioned in advance of the disaster, such as the ability to utilize more than one fuel in an electricity generating unit, the workings of the market system in offering price signals to identify scarcity and value, and established government policy levers. Adaptive resilience is exemplified by actions devised after the disaster strikes, such as undertaking conservation that was not previously thought possible, changing technology, devising market mechanisms where they might not have previously existed (for example, reliability premiums for electricity or water delivery), or devising new government post-disaster assistance programs. It is important to realize that a good amount of resilience <b>is</b> <b>already</b> <b>embodied</b> in the economy at various levels (for example, a firm’s ability to substitute inputs, market signals for reallocating resources), and that policies should be designed to capitalize rather than obstruct or duplicate this capacity. At the same time, policy should also be geared to rewarding both types of resilience.|$|R

By the first week in July delegates were referring to a total at Boston that was edging toward 20.000. Maximum strengths for the forces both in Massachusetts and New York were finally established on 21 and 22 July, when solid information was on hand.

40|$|The {{controversy}} between optimists and pessimists {{that followed}} and keeps dividing the economists {{is the result}} of the absence in the dominating economic theory of an analytical framework able to deal properly with out-of-equilibrium processes as is the one through which a technological restructuring of production takes place. This theory looks in fact at capital as a stock of physical goods into which free capital has <b>been</b> <b>already</b> <b>embodied,</b> and which <b>is</b> divided into fixed capital goods (structures and machinery) and working capital (which includes wage goods). The Neo-Austrian representation of the process of production introduced by Hicks puts into the shade the argument of fixed vs. circulating capital that has characterized the controversy, to shift the focus on the real issue at stake in the technological restructuring process, that is, ‘that investment at cost is not the same as investment of output capacity’. It allows re-establishing the classic analysis of the wage fund as the economic beginning of a production process. Focusing on the coordination problems involved in phase of restructuring, the paper confirms the Ricardo’s intuition as well as the analytical advance by Hicks, and shows that the so called technological unemployment is not a temporary mechanical problem due to the characteristics of technology but a more general problem due to market behaviours and policies...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} microgenesis {{refers to the}} {{development}} on a brief present-time scale of a percept, a thought, an object of imagination, or an expression. It defines the occurrence of immediate experience as dynamic unfolding and differentiation in which the ‘germ' of the final experience <b>is</b> <b>already</b> <b>embodied</b> {{in the early stages}} of its development. Immediate experience typically concerns the focal experience of an object that is thematized as a ‘figure' in the global field of consciousness; this can involve a percept, thought, object of imagination, or expression (verbal and/or gestural). Yet, whatever its modality or content, focal experience is postulated to develop and stabilize through dynamic differentiation and unfolding. Such a microgenetic description of immediate experience substantiates a phenomenological and genetic theory of cognition where any process of perception, thought, expression or imagination is primarily a process of genetic differentiation and development, rather than one of detection (of a stimulus array or information), transformation, and integration (of multiple primitive components) as theories of cognitivist kind have contended. My purpose in this essay is to provide an overview of the main constructs of microgenetic theory, to outline its potential avenues of future development in the field of cognitive science, and to illustrate an application of the theory to research, using visual processes in reading as an example...|$|R

40|$|Risks {{associated}} with incentive misalignment {{are liable to}} seriously jeopardize the effectiveness of bank resolution, when not properly contained. This Article considers the management of misaligned incentives between regulators that are found in a vertical relationship of public governance. Using the EU legal framework of bank resolution as its case study, this Article explores {{the effectiveness of the}} quasi-enforcement powers of the Single Resolution Board (SRB) and, where relevant, of the European Banking Authority (EBA) as an incentive realignment legal technique. Two principal difficulties are identified: on the one hand, the problematic interinstitutional dynamic of the SRB and the EBA and, on the other hand, the exposure of these two EU agencies to legal contestation. Although this Article questions the wisdom of enforcement avoidance as an optimal long-term strategy, its purpose is not to defend enforcement as a means for incentive realignment, but rather, to warn of the obstacles lying ahead should the SRB and the EBA decide to go down that path. The key message of this Article is that, if there is a case to be made for EU agency enforcement action as a means for incentive realignment, further medium and long-term reform will be required to (a) improve the effectiveness of the enforcement powers of the EU agencies, (b) ameliorate instances of bank nationalism, which is traditionally a major source of regulatory misalignment in Europe, and (c) strengthen the incentive-based elements that <b>are</b> <b>already</b> <b>embodied</b> into the EU system of financial regulation...|$|R

Using examples from three qualitative research projects around young people, policing, and crime prevention, the chapter argues we need a new way of thinking about youthful vulnerabilities as embodied in ways that make them impossible to pin down, and therefore effectively ‘remedy’.

60|$|Here Shakespeare, {{with his}} wonted tact, {{makes use of}} a vulgar superstition, of a type in which mortal presentiment <b>is</b> <b>already</b> <b>embodied,</b> to make a common ground on which the hearer and Lady Macbeth may meet. After this prelude we are {{prepared}} to be possessed by her emotion more fully, to feel in her ears the dull tramp of the blood that seems to make the raven's croak yet hoarser than it is, and to betray the stealthy advance of the mind to its fell purpose. For Lady Macbeth hears not so much the voice of the bodeful bird as of her own premeditated murder, and we are thus made her shuddering accomplices before the fact. Every image receives the color of the mind, every word throbs with the pulse of one controlling passion. The epithet fatal makes us feel the implacable resolve of the speaker, and shows us that she is tampering with her conscience by putting off the crime upon the prophecy of the Weird Sisters to which she alludes. In the word battlements, too, not only is the fancy led up to the perch of the raven, but a hostile image takes the place of a hospitable; for men commonly speak of receiving a guest under their roof or within their doors. That this is not over-ingenuity, seeing what is not to be seen, nor meant to be seen, is clear to me from what follows. When Duncan and Banquo arrive at the castle, their fancies, free from all suggestion of evil, call up only gracious and amiable images. The raven was but the fantastical creation of Lady Macbeth's over-wrought brain.|$|R

40|$|Two {{perceptions}} of the marginality of home economics are widespread across educational and other contexts. One is that home economics and those who engage in its pedagogy are inevitably marginalised within patriarchal relations in education and culture. This is because home economics is characterised as women's knowledge, for the private domain of the home. The other perception is that only orthodox epistemological frameworks of inquiry {{should be used to}} interrogate this state of affairs. These perceptions have prompted leading theorists in the field to call for non-essentialist approaches to research in order to re-think the thinking that has produced this cul-de-sac positioning of home economics as a body of knowledge and a site of teacher practice. This thesis takes up the challenge of working to locate a space outside the frame of modernist research theory and methods, recognising that this shift in epistemology is necessary to unsettle the idea that home economics is inevitably marginalised. The purpose of the study is to reconfigure how we have come to think about home economics teachers and the profession of home economics as a site of cultural practice, in order to think it otherwise (Lather, 1991). This is done by exploring how the culture of home economics is being contested from within. To do so, the thesis uses a 'posthumanist' approach, which rejects the conception of the individual as a unitary and fixed entity, but instead as a subject in process, shaped by desires and language which are not necessarily consciously determined. This posthumanist project focuses attention on pedagogical body subjects as the 'unsaid' of home economics research. It works to transcend the modernist dualism of mind/body, and other binaries central to modernist work, including private/public, male/female,paid/unpaid, and valued/unvalued. In so doing, it refuses the simple margin/centre geometry so characteristic of current {{perceptions of}} home economics itself. Three studies make up this work. Studies one and two serve to document the disciplined body of home economics knowledge, the governance of which works towards normalisation of the 'proper' home economics teacher. The analysis of these accounts of home economics teachers by home economics teachers, reveals that home economics teachers are 'skilled' yet they 'suffer' for their profession. Further,home economics knowledge is seen to be complicit in reinforcing the traditional roles of masculinity and femininity, thereby reinforcing heterosexual normativity which is central to patriarchal society. The third study looks to four 'atypical'subjects who defy the category of 'proper' and 'normal' home economics teacher. These 'atypical' bodies are 'skilled' but fiercely reject the label of 'suffering'. The discussion of the studies is a feminist poststructural account, using Russo's (1994) notion of the grotesque body, which is emergent from Bakhtin's (1968) theory of the carnivalesque. It draws on the 'shreds' of home economics pedagogy,scrutinising them for their subversive, transformative potential. In this analysis, the giving and taking of pleasure and fun in the home economics classroom presents moments of surprise and of carnival. Foucault's notion of the construction of the ethical individual shows these 'atypical' bodies to be 'immoderate' yet striving hard to be 'continent' body subjects. This research captures moments of transgression which suggest that transformative moments <b>are</b> <b>already</b> <b>embodied</b> in the pedagogical practices of home economics teachers, and these can be 'seen' when re-looking through postmodemist lenses. Hence, the cultural practices ofhome economics as inevitably marginalised are being contested from within. Until now, home economics as a lived culture has failed to recognise possibilities for reconstructing its own field beyond the confines of modernity. This research {{is an example of how}} to think about home economics teachers and the profession as a reconfigured cultural practice. Future research about home economics as a body of knowledge and a site of teacher practice need not retell a simple story of oppression.

A more plausible candidate is kind-based object individuation that <b>already</b> <b>embodies</b> essentialist modes of thinking and that is present in infants and nonhuman primate...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A {{technique}} is presented for computing a finite over-approximation {{of a language}} of terms, modulo rewriting. The language is represented by an arbitrary term grammar. The approximation is a term grammar as well, and it <b>already</b> <b>embodies</b> rewriting, i. e. its language includes all the original terms and all their possible rewritings. We propose this technique to statically verify cryptographic protocols, expressed in process calculi involving non-free term algebras. As an example, we establish the forward secrecy of a Diffie-Hellman–based protocol. ...|$|R
40|$|Jacques Offenbach used {{a number}} of {{strategies}} to define {{the identity of the}} Théâtre des Bouffes Parisiens and the emergent genre of opérette. Central to this self-positioning were attempts to situate the theatre and its products within the context of eighteenth-century comic opera in general and opéra comique in particular. This was achieved by the promotion of eighteenth-century works at the Bouffes-Parisiens and by Offenbach’s judicious moves to locate his new works {{in the context of the}} past. During the first three years of the life of the Bouffes Parisiens (1855 - 58), Offenbach attempted to mount four key works from the ‘long’ eighteenth century: Rousseau’s Le devin du village, Pergolesi’s La serva padrona, Mozart’s Der Schauspieldirektor and Rossini’s Il signor Bruschino. Of these, the Rossini and Mozart both reached the stage, in versions that required varying degrees of modification. Le devin du village most likely fell foul of the imperial administration since it belonged to the repertory of the Académie Impériale de Musique, and Gevaert’s attempts to rework La serva padrona were diverted to the Opéra-Comique where the work was presented in 1862. When Offenbach announced his competition for composers of new opérettes in 1856, he took the opportunity to write the history of opéra comique according to his own understanding and preferences. In his diagnosis of various phases of the development of the genre he emplotted its history in a way that stressed the inflation of the genre from its origins to the recent première of Meyerbeer’s L’etoile du nord (1854), and that traced a progressive distancing of the genre from what Offenbach thought were its eighteenth-century origins. He called for a revival of the spirit of the works of Monsigny, Dalayrac and Grétry in the works of the competitors for his prize. This spirit <b>was</b> of course <b>already</b> <b>embodied</b> in those works currently in the repertory of the Bouffes Parisiens, and in emplotting the history of opéra comique in this fashion, he was claiming a legitimacy for opérette by allying it with the country’s national lyric genre. <br/...|$|R
40|$|The Singapore Court of Appeal (the Court of Appeal) has in MFM Restaurants Pte Ltd v Fish 2 ̆ 6 Co Restaurants Pte Ltd {{rejected}} Lord Hoffinann 2 ̆ 7 s {{assumption of}} responsibility test (articulated in The Achilleas) to determine whether damages are too remote in a contractual claim. The Court of Appeal, however, retained {{assumption of responsibility}} as a concept to explain the orthodox test for remoteness as embodied in Hadley v Baxendale. To that extent, it expressly accepted Lord Hoffmann 2 ̆ 7 s approach in The Achilleas {{in so far as}} the concept of assumption of responsibility <b>is</b> <b>already</b> incorporated or <b>embodied</b> in both limbs of the Hadley test. Two questions arise from this decision and form the scope of this comment. First, what is the actual disagreement between the Court of Appeal 2 ̆ 7 s more 2 ̆ 2 orthodox 2 ̆ 2 approach, and Lord Hoffmann 2 ̆ 7 s approach? Secondly [...] depending on the answer to the first question [...] can 2 ̆ 2 assumption of responsibility 2 ̆ 2 as a concept justify the Hadley test without it being the test in fact? If the scope of disagreement between the Court of Appeal and Lord Hoffmann is less than fundamental, and assumption of responsibility as a concept can explain the existing orthodox test without subverting it, then the approach adopted by the Court of Appeal may well give effect to Lord Hoffmann 2 ̆ 7 s approach in The Achilleas in a more practically feasible way...|$|R
