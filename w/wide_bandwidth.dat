25|$|Fast scan amateur {{television}} has gained popularity as hobbyists adapt inexpensive consumer video electronics like camcorders and video cards in PCs. Because of the <b>wide</b> <b>bandwidth</b> and stable signals required, amateur television is typically {{found in the}} 70cm (420–450MHz) frequency range, though there is also limited use on 33cm (902–928MHz), 23cm (1240–1300MHz) and higher. These requirements also effectively limit the signal range to between 20 and 60miles (30–100km).|$|E
25|$|Although their damping {{had been}} reduced as much as possible, spark {{transmitters}} still produced damped waves which had a <b>wide</b> <b>bandwidth,</b> creating interference with other transmitters. Around 1920 they became obsolete, superseded by vacuum tube transmitters which generated continuous waves at a single frequency, which could also be modulated to carry sound. Tesla's resonant transformer continued {{to be used in}} vacuum tube transmitters and receivers, and is a key component in radio to this day.|$|E
50|$|The optical {{parametric}} amplifier has a <b>wider</b> <b>bandwidth</b> than a -amplifier, {{which in turn}} has a <b>wider</b> <b>bandwidth</b> than an optical parametric oscillator because of white-light generation even one octave wide. Therefore, a subband can be selected and fairly short pulses can still be generated.|$|R

50|$|For lowest loss (and <b>widest</b> <b>bandwidth),</b> the {{preselector}} is tuned {{using the}} lowest inductance and highest capacitance (and the lowest , or least selectivity) for the desired frequency. The <b>wider</b> <b>bandwidth</b> allows interference through from more nearby frequencies, but reduces {{the need to}} retune the preselector while tuning the receiver, since any one low-inductance setting for the preselector will pass many nearby frequencies.|$|R
25|$|They hunt {{their prey}} using scent, passive hearing, and echolocation. Their main calls have a <b>wide</b> <b>bandwidth</b> and are multiharmonic, with a peak {{amplitude}} of 27 to 28kHz. They also make shorter pulsed, frequency modulated calls. The bats enter torpor {{in cold weather}} and stay in their roosts for up to 10 {{days at a time}} before emerging to feed. They may also enter daily torpor when roosting alone. However, they are capable of remaining active even in subzero temperatures when necessary.|$|E
25|$|An {{advantage}} of parabolic antennas {{is that most}} of the structure of the antenna (all of it except the feed antenna) is nonresonant, so it can function over a wide range of frequencies, that is a <b>wide</b> <b>bandwidth.</b> All that is necessary to change the frequency of operation is to replace the feed antenna with one that works at the new frequency. Some parabolic antennas transmit or receive at multiple frequencies by having several feed antennas mounted at the focal point, close together.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the largest}} {{applications}} of the Tesla coil circuit was in early radio transmitters called spark gap transmitters. The first radio wave generators, invented by Heinrich Hertz in 1887, were spark gaps connected directly to antennas, powered by induction coils. Because they lacked a resonant circuit, these transmitters produced highly damped radio waves. As a result, their transmissions occupied an extremely <b>wide</b> <b>bandwidth</b> of frequencies. When multiple transmitters were operating {{in the same area}} their frequencies overlapped and they interfered with one another, causing garbled reception. There was no way for a receiver to select one signal over another.|$|E

500|$|These are of {{interest}} because they can accomplish tasks a Foster network cannot. [...] For example, the usual passive Foster impedance matching networks can only match the impedance of an antenna with a transmission line at discrete frequencies, which limits the bandwidth of the antenna. [...] A non-Foster network could match an antenna over a continuous band of frequencies. [...] This would allow the creation of compact antennas that have <b>wide</b> <b>bandwidth,</b> violating the Chu-Harrington limit. [...] Practical non-Foster networks are an active area of research.|$|E
500|$|A simple tee {{circuit of}} {{resistors}} {{can be used}} as a power divider as shown in figure 18. [...] This circuit can also be implemented as a delta circuit by applying the Y-Δ transform. [...] The delta form uses resistors that are equal to the system impedance. [...] This can be advantageous because precision resistors of the value of the system impedance are always available for most system nominal impedances. [...] The tee circuit has the benefits of simplicity, low cost, and intrinsically <b>wide</b> <b>bandwidth.</b> [...] It has two major drawbacks; first, the circuit will dissipate power since it is resistive: an equal split will result in [...] insertion loss instead of [...] [...] The second problem is that there is [...] directivity leading to very poor isolation between the output ports.|$|E
500|$|The branch-line coupler {{consists}} of two parallel transmission lines physically coupled together with two or more branch lines between them. [...] The branch lines are spaced λ/4 apart and represent sections of a multi-section filter design {{in the same way}} as the multiple sections of a coupled line coupler except that here the coupling of each section is controlled with the impedance of the branch lines. [...] The main and coupled line are [...] of the system impedance. [...] The more sections there are in the coupler, the higher is the ratio of impedances of the branch lines. [...] High impedance lines have narrow tracks and this usually limits the design to three sections in planar formats due to manufacturing limitations. [...] A similar limitation applies for coupling factors looser than low coupling also requires narrow tracks. [...] Coupled lines are a better choice when loose coupling is required, but branch-line couplers are good for tight coupling and can be used for [...] hybrids. [...] Branch-line couplers usually do not have such a <b>wide</b> <b>bandwidth</b> as coupled lines. [...] This style of coupler is good for implementing in high-power, air dielectric, solid bar formats as the rigid structure is easy to mechanically support.Matthaei et al., pp.809–811Räisänen and Lehto, p.127 ...|$|E

2500|$|Several {{characteristics}} of the magnetron's output make radar use of the device somewhat problematic. The first of these factors is the magnetron's inherent instability in its transmitter frequency. This instability results not only in frequency shifts from one pulse to the next, but also a frequency shift within an individual transmitted pulse. The second factor is that {{the energy of the}} transmitted pulse is spread over a relatively wide frequency spectrum, which requires the receiver to have a correspondingly <b>wide</b> <b>bandwidth.</b> This <b>wide</b> <b>bandwidth</b> allows ambient electrical noise to be accepted into the receiver, thus obscuring somewhat the weak radar echoes, thereby reducing overall receiver signal-to-noise ratio and thus performance. [...] The third factor, depending on application, is the radiation hazard caused by the use of high power electromagnetic radiation. In some applications, for example a marine radar mounted on a recreational vessel, a radar with a magnetron output of 2 to 4 kilowatts is often found mounted very near an area occupied by crew or passengers. In practical use these factors have been overcome, or merely accepted, and there are today thousands of magnetron aviation and marine radar units in service. [...] Recent advances in aviation weather avoidance radar and in marine radar have successfully replaced the magnetron with semiconductor microwave oscillators, which have a narrower output frequency range. [...] These allow a narrower receiver bandwidth to be used, and the higher signal to noise ratio in turn allows a lower transmitter power, reducing exposure to EMR.|$|E
2500|$|In some applications, {{generally}} {{those that}} are cost-sensitive or that require great durability, mirrors are made from a single, bulk material such as polished metal. For technical applications such as laser mirrors, the reflective coating is typically applied by vacuum deposition on the front surface of the substrate. This eliminates refraction and double reflections, also called [...] "ghost reflections" [...] (a weak reflection {{from the surface of}} the glass, and a stronger one from the reflecting metal), and reduces absorption of light by the mirror. Technical mirrors may use a silver, aluminium, or gold coating (the latter typically for infrared mirrors), and achieve reflectivities of 90–95% when new. A protective transparent overcoat may be applied to prevent oxidation of the reflective layer. Applications requiring higher reflectivity or greater durability, where <b>wide</b> <b>bandwidth</b> is not essential, use dielectric coatings, which can achieve reflectivities as high as 99.999% over a narrow range of wavelengths.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{single and}} dual band EBG {{structures}} for <b>wider</b> <b>bandwidth</b> are proposed. In {{each of the}} discussed EBGs, a metallic patch of regular geometry is chosen for the unit element. The patch is further modified by cutting slots to get extra inductance and capacitance which results into lower cut-off frequency and larger bandwidth. The proposed EBG structures are compared with the standard mushroom type EBG with respect to surface wave attenuation. The - 20 dB cut-off frequencies and bandwidths of the various EBGs are compared. The effect of unit element size, gap between unit elements and via diameter on the transmission response is presented. Among the discussed EBGs, the swastika type structure is compact, single band and has <b>wider</b> <b>bandwidth.</b> The square patch with a single disconnected loop type slot EBG and the Fractal EBG are dual band.

2500|$|Natterer's bat is nocturnal and insectivorous. It emerges at dusk to {{hunt for}} insects and uses {{echolocation}} to find prey and orient itself at night. Like many other species of bat, it emits sounds at too high a frequency for most humans to detect and then interprets the echoes created {{in order to build}} a [...] "sound picture" [...] of its surroundings. The frequencies used by this bat species for echolocation lie between 23–115kHz and have most energy at 53kHz. The individual signals have an average duration of 3.8 ms. The <b>wide</b> <b>bandwidth</b> of its frequency-modulated search signals enables it to detect prey only a few centimetres from vegetation and it does not use vision, olfaction or sounds emitted by its prey for this purpose. The bat feeds on the wing and it mostly catches insects in flight but it is also able to feed on prey items such as spiders and caterpillars dangling close to foliage on silken threads.|$|E
