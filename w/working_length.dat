50|$|There {{have been}} a number of {{progressive}} iterations to the mechanical preparation of the root canal for endodontic therapy. The first, referred to as the standardized technique, was developed by Ingle in 1961, and had disadvantages such as the potential for loss of <b>working</b> <b>length</b> and inadvertent ledging, zipping or perforation. Subsequent refinements have been numerous, and are usually described as techniques. These include the step-back, circumferential filing, incremental, anticurvature filing, step-down, double flare, crown-down-pressureless, balanced force, canal master, apical box, progressive enlargement, modified double flare, passive stepback, alternated rotary motions, and apical patency techniques.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} electronic apex locators {{operated on}} the direct current principle. A problem with these devices was that conductive fluids such as hemorrhage, exudate, or irrigant in the canal would permit current flow {{and therefore a}} false reading. Newer devices are impedance-based, using alternating current of two frequencies;these measure and compare two electrical impedances that change as the file moves apically. The benefit is that these devices are much less affected by fluidconductive media in the canal. The impedance type apex locators have been demonstrated to be 80 to 95% accurate in identifying the apical foramen. Therefore after obtaining a reading, 1 to 2 mm is subtracted as the corrected <b>working</b> <b>length.</b>|$|E

Standardized conventional radiographic and phosphor-plate digital images were taken of 20 extracted permanent mandibular molars with 06 K-files placed in the distal root canal either 2 mm short or flush with the apical foramen. Similar images were obtained from mandibles with teeth that demonstrated large (n = 10) or small (n = 10) periapical lesions. Four evaluators ranked the clarity of the digital image with that of the radiograph. Results were analyzed by using the 2 -sided sign test, ordinal logistic regression, and the κ test. Results. The perceived clarity of an endodontic file tip, at any position, and of a small or large periapical lesion was significantly (P <. 01) less on all digital images compared with conventional films.

Representative metal thicknesses range from 18 gauge (.0478 inch) up to 1/8 inch (.125 inch). The heavier the wall, the more durable and resistant it will be to dents, also, the more energy that it will absorb during heat-up and the more that it will release during cool-down. To take a typical example, consider an autoclave with an 8 ft internal diameter and a <b>working</b> <b>length</b> of 40 ft. If the interior wall is made of 11 gauge (.1196 inch) steel, then it will weigh well over five tons. Heating just the wall itself to an operating temperature of [...] in one hour will take some 90 kilowatts of power. At typical demand charges, that will cost approximately $2,000 (for the month) in addition to the energy charge (for each cycle). Reducing the wall thickness to 18 gauge will drop this expense by approximately 60 percent. For a saving of $13,000 a year, the average autoclave operator can live with a lot of dents.|$|E
