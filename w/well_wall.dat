50|$|The {{problem of}} street dogs in general spotted into light in 2012 after an {{incident}} {{that resulted in the}} death of a prominent person. Some street dogs killed the Wall Street-billionaire Professor Botyo Tachkov, {{one of the most famous}} American scientists with numerous achievements. A Pernik-born student and teacher of the prominent Columbia University, teacher in some German universities as <b>well,</b> <b>Wall</b> Street broker and president of a Wall Street investment bank, worker in the US Department of State, the United Nations and the World Bank, writer of about a dozen of scientific books that are present in the world's significant libraries, holder of the Eleonore Roosevelt, Fulbright awards, included in Who's Who in America and the Industry and Finance, he emigrated to the United States in 1962 by asylum because of his denial to serve the Bulgarian communist agencies. Unluckily, in his last years he had returned to teach in Bulgaria where he suffered a brutal death at the age of 87. When walking down the district Malinova dolina in Sofia, near the American College where he was teaching, he was attacked by about 20 street dogs, which ate his left foot and his eyes, making him blind according to the doctors. Though he survived, he died in the hospital after intensive care and an unsuccessful surgery 10 days later. Considering his complicated past, it is also suggested that his death may be an intentionally prompted murder. The urn containing his ash is kept at the place for the most famous Bulgarians in the Sofia Central Cemetery. After the investigation in 2012, 4 of the 23 caught dogs in Malinova Dolina were killed by the authorities in Sofia, the rest 19 were closed in a dog camp in Seslavtsi from where they could be adopted and some Austrians wanted to adopt the dogs that killed Botyo Tachkov. The mayor declared that sometimes dogs are adopted and the adopters cast them on the streets again.|$|E

To {{meet the requirements of}} cementing job, additives such as fluid loss agent (FLA) are used to improve performance of the cement slurry (Dugonjić-Bilić et al. 2011). FLA can control the loss of water from the cement slurry to porous formations and thus prevent the cement slurry from dehydrating. During the past few decades, various FLA including inorganic granular materials, modified natural polymers and synthetic polymers have been developed (Amani et al. 2012). Among them, synthetic polymers were widely studied due to satisfactory performance under complicated formation environment.|$|E

Then, it slides along the bore hole bottom line and its axis line is a circle of a radius ρ + a, where ρ is the radius of the bore hole axis T and a is the system clearance. In sliding, the DS is subjected to action of gravity (f gr), contact (f cont), and friction (f fr) forces. In consequence of these forces, the DS can be compressed in some segments of its length where it can begin to buckle without losing its contact with the <b>well</b> <b>wall.</b> It is necessary to predict the critical states of the DS and to construct the modes of its stability loss.|$|E

Collision and friction between drill string and <b>well</b> <b>wall,</b> displacement response on the drill bit and other boundary conditions were considered in this simulated modeling. By using finite element analysis software ANSYS, the dynamic characteristics of horizontal section of drill string were calculated and discussed.

The calculated {{results show that the}} installation positions of stabilizers have remarkable effects on the dynamic characteristics of drill string. It will change the lateral vibration and whirling motion of drill string remarkably. Furthermore, the reasonably installation of the stabilizers can decrease the amplitudes of lateral vibration and transient torque. Those results may provide some guidance for the vibration analysis of drill string system...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Zhoushen Well X 1 is a {{deep and}} {{exploration}} well, there are some difficulties in drilling fluids treating: The borehole is large, the open hole is long and the rock density proportion is high in the overlying strata. So the drilling fluids must have good suspended and sand carrying; there are brown mudstone, gypsum mudstone and light gray fine sandstone in the lower strata, swelling and hole shrinkage always happen. So the key point is ensuring <b>well</b> <b>wall</b> stability and preventing swelling and hole shrinkage. The drilling fluids must have strong Calcium-tolerance and good compatibility with formation for coping the swelling and hole shrinkage of the high conductivity mudstone in the deep well section. Because well temperature is high in the lower section, the stability of anti-high temperature is very important. The drilling fluids must have prevention against high temperature denseness ability and good rheological property...|$|E

However it is unlikely that equilibrium obtains because of the high water velocity (order of 100 m/s) near the well giving no time for bubble nucleation. Flashing and hence mineral deposition are therefore not at all likely in the crack but can occur within the well from the crack horizon upwards. In the case of a multitude of fine cracks giving the same total flow, streamline conditions prevail over the flow path with the flash front a meter or so from the well, hence deposition is a possibility...|$|E

40|$|Daylight use in an atrium is {{particularly}} beneficial {{as the natural}} light can illuminate potentially dark core areas and decrease energy consumption from electric lighting. This study has investigated, for overcast sky conditions, the horizontal daylight levels in spaces adjoining atria and the vertical daylight levels on atrium well walls in atria. The daylight levels in the rooms and on the walls were derived from scale model measurements, theoretical calculations and predictions from the lighting simulation package Radiance. A comparison of measured data and modelling has validated Radiance simulations of atrium daylighting. The simulations show generally good agreement with theory while some limitations in the calculations used in determining the daylight factors in rooms with large widow area to total wall area ratios were observed. The average daylight levels in rooms displayed a linear relationship with the vertical daylight levels on the <b>well</b> <b>wall.</b> In terms of the well geometry and well façades (decided by the ratio of window area to solid wall area) and well surface reflectance, the variations of daylight level in the adjoining rooms have been analysed and some conclusions and design strategies for supporting preliminary design decisions are presented...|$|E

40|$|Domain {{walls in}} {{equilibrium}} phase transitions propagate in a preferred direction {{so as to}} minimize the free energy of the system. As a result, initial spatio-temporal patterns ultimately decay toward uniform states. The absence of a variational principle far from equilibrium allows the coexistence of domain walls propagating in any direction. As a consequence, persistent patterns may emerge. We study this mechanism of pattern formation using a non-variational extension of Landau’s model for second order phase transitions. PACS numbers: 05. 70. Fh, 42. 65. Pc, 47. 20. Ky, 82. 20 Mj – 2 – Second order phase transitions, such as in ferromagnets or liquid-vapor systems, are manifestations of spontaneous symmetry breaking occurring near thermal equilibrium. The coexistence of broken symmetry states beyond the transition point gives rise to spatial patterns consisting of domain walls or fronts separating regions of different phase. The dynamics of domain walls near thermal equilibrium, are dictated by a variational principle, namely, the minimization of the free energy. As a consequence, initial spatio-temporal patterns ultimately decay toward the stationary homogeneous states of lowest free energy. Front structures are commonly observed in far-from-equilibrium systems as <b>well.</b> <b>Wall...</b>|$|E

3000|$|... [...]), a lithological {{description}} of rock chips and a thorough search for published laboratory data will likely provide decent first-order estimates. Especially in intensely fractured intervals, the rock mass strength will {{be dominated by}} the rock mass characteristics, such that a first-order estimate of intact strength and stiffness will be sufficient as a starting point. Therefore, armed with a detailed {{description of}} the borehole or <b>well</b> <b>wall</b> from wireline log data (fracture density, in particular), one can assess rock mass strength and elastic modulus, important for a wide range of modelling scenarios (e.g. McClure and Horne 2013 and references therein) and stimulation strategies (Cipolla et al. 2008). We recommend that this simple, yet well-established, engineering method be used to characterise geothermal reservoirs worldwide to empirically establish its validity under reservoir and small diameter wellbore conditions. A possible technique would be to measure reservoir deformation during stimulation using distributed deformation measurements in wellbores using fibre optic technology as has been used for rock slope deformation monitoring (e.g. Moore et al. 2010). We also recommend that core and wellbore characterisation be undertaken such that fracture frequency, orientation, infilling and roughness for natural fractures are collected at a resolution that allows computation of the rock mass strength and stiffness criteria. Finally we recommend that wireline techniques, such as gamma ray (Bigelow 1992), be used to explore the possibility of identifying clay infilling signatures for joint condition assessment (as in Meller and Ledésert 2017).|$|E
