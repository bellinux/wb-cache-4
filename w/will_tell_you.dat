For us, however, the BlackBerry UI is showing its age, and ultimately, beautiful hardware aside, this device is essentially exactly the same as every other BlackBerry.|$|E
5|$|When making observations, {{scientists}} {{look through}} telescopes, study images on electronic screens, record meter readings, and so on. Generally, on a basic level, they {{can agree on}} what they see, e.g., the thermometer shows 37.9 degrees C. But, if these scientists have different ideas about the theories {{that have been developed}} to explain these basic observations, they may disagree about what they are observing. For example, before Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, observers would have likely interpreted the image at left as five different objects in space. In light of that theory, however, astronomers <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that there are actually only two objects, one in the center and four different images of a second object around the sides. Alternatively, if other scientists suspect that something is wrong with the telescope and only one object is actually being observed, they are operating under yet another theory. Observations that cannot be separated from theoretical interpretation are said to be theory-laden.|$|E

Three years of work on the lower Ormeau Road, Portadown and parts of Fermanagh and Newry, Armagh and in Bellaghy and up in Derry.

500|$|Some bookmakers {{made the}} Yankees a 15-to-1 Series favorite, while others, like New York's top betting commissioners, thought the teams were evenly matched. One New York Times writer found [...] "little {{justification}} for installing either team as the favorite". Regardless of the odds, players from both teams were confident of victory. Hornsby said, [...] "We're {{going to come}} through winners. We have the better pitching staff, the better hitters and the greater experience. That's {{what it takes to}} win. ...

Microsoft intended the rules to be [...] "flexible", and, because it was unilateral, the license was legally unable to reduce rights. However, machinima artists, such as Edgeworks Entertainment, protested the prohibitions on extending Microsoft's fictional universes (a common component of fan fiction) and on selling anything from sites hosting derivative works. Compounding the reaction was the license's statement, [...] "If you do any of these things, you can expect to hear from Microsoft's lawyers who <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that you have to stop distributing your items right away." ...|$|E

500|$|Pound's {{education}} {{began in}} a series of dame schools, some of them run by Quakers: Miss Elliott's school in Jenkintown in 1892, the Heathcock family's Chelten Hills School in Wyncote in 1893, and the Florence Ridpath school from 1894, also in Wyncote. His first publication was on 7 November 1896 in the Jenkintown Times-Chronicle ("by E. L. Pound, Wyncote, aged 11 years"), a limerick about William Jennings Bryan, who had just lost the 1896 presidential election: [...] "There was a young man from the West, / He did what he could for what he thought best; / But election came round, / He found himself drowned, / And the papers <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> the rest." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} critical acclaim, with critics highlighting Ellen Pompeo's performance, Washington's {{direction and}} McKee's writing.

500|$|The {{first draft}} of the book was {{finished}} in April 2008. In a newsletter sent out that month, Paolini said he was busy [...] "chewing [...] way through the editing, {{which has been a}} surprisingly enjoyable experience this time around." [...] The hardest part of editing was having to excise material that he spent days and weeks working on. [...] "However, as most any writer <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> just because you spent ten days slaving over a certain scene is no reason to keep it in the final manuscript. The only question that matters is whether the scene contributes to the book as a whole," [...] he said. Michelle Frey, executive editor at Alfred A.

500|$|Because of {{his many}} {{absences}} from home, on parliamentary and other business, Richard Cobden was a somewhat remote figure to his daughters, although his letters indicate that he felt warmly towards them and that he wished to direct their political education. In later years they would all acknowledge his influence over their ideas. Both parents impressed on the girls their responsibilities for the poor in the local community; Jane Cobden's 1864 diary records visits to homes and workhouses. She and her younger sister Anne, at the ages of 12 and 10 respectively, taught classes in the local village school. [...] The girls were encouraged by their father to contribute what money they possessed to relieve local poverty: [...] "Do not keep the money... as you have now made up your minds {{to give it to}} poor sufferers, let your own neighbours have it.

Then how I saw how the European Union was developing, it was very obvious that what they had in mind was not democratic. ... And the way that Europe has developed is that the bankers and the multinational corporations have got very powerful positions, and if you come in on their terms, they <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> what you can and cannot do. And that is unacceptable. My view about the European Union has always been not that I am hostile to foreigners, but that I am in favour of democracy ...
