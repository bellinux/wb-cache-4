All elements other than {{hydrogen and helium}} today account for only 2% {{of the mass of}} atomic matter in the universe. Helium-4, by contrast, makes up about 23% of the universe's ordinary matter—nearly all the ordinary matter that is not hydrogen.|$|E
5|$|Nielsen briefly {{appeared}} on the World Wrestling Federation program {{in the summer of}} 1994 on WWF Monday Night Raw; capitalizing on Frank Drebin. Nielsen (and George Kennedy) were hired as sleuths to unravel the mystery of The Undertaker who had disappeared at January's Royal Rumble event. At SummerSlam 1994, in a Naked Gun parody, they <b>were</b> <b>hot</b> on the case (in fact, they were standing on a case). Although they did not find The Undertaker, the case had been closed (the literal case had been shut) and thus, they solved the mystery. In 1990, Nielsen appeared as a Frank Drebin character in advertisements in the United Kingdom for Red Rock Cider.|$|E
5|$|Three {{practice}} sessions—two on Friday and a {{third on}} Saturday—were held before the Sunday race. The Friday morning and afternoon sessions lasted ninety minutes each; the third, one-hour session was held on Saturday morning. Conditions <b>were</b> <b>hot</b> and sunny for the Friday practice sessions. Several drivers went off the track due to the track being dusty. Rosberg recorded the fastest lap of the first session {{with a time of}} 1 minute and 41.175 seconds, ahead of McLaren teammates Hamilton and Button. Kubica was fourth-fastest; Massa and Vettel were fifth and sixth. Webber, Michael Schumacher, Alonso and Rubens Barrichello rounded out the session's top-ten drivers. Bruno Senna's left-side view mirror became detached from his Hispania F110, which grazed the Brazilian driver's helmet, and was run over by Sébastien Buemi heading into turn 12, which caused the session to be stopped to allow marshals to clear the track of debris.|$|E
50|$|Conversely, {{participants}} in televised batsu games are often criticized as faking their distress, because the humor lies {{only in their}} reaction to the punishment and therefore the punishment need not exist. An oft-discussed example of this <b>is</b> the <b>hot</b> water baths—the participants claim that the water <b>is</b> extremely <b>hot,</b> {{but it does not}} need to <b>be</b> <b>hot</b> for the participants to provide a funny reaction. As such, participants will often try to convince the viewers that the water <b>is</b> <b>hot</b> through various means (having an audience member stick his hand in the water, for example, or breaking character by saying that the water <b>is</b> <b>hotter</b> than it <b>was</b> during rehearsal). Generally speaking, the punishments are real rather than faked (the water <b>is</b> <b>hot,</b> the wasabi <b>is</b> spicy), but they are maintained at a level of preventing injuries.|$|R

Richmond got their revenge in an intensely physical clash in the 1973 VFL Grand Final and went back-to-back in 1974 with a strong win against a resurgent North Melbourne.|$|E

In 1967 the Casa de las Américas in Havana held a Festival de la canción de protesta (protest songs). Much of the effort was spent applauding causes that would annoy the U.S. government. Tania Castellanos, a filín singer and author, wrote ¡Por Angela! in support of Angela Davis. César Portillo de la Luz wrote Oh, valeroso Viet Nam.

He and Lee traded notes across the lines from June 5 to 7 without coming to an agreement, and when Grant formally requested a two-hour cessation of hostilities, {{it was too late for}} most of the unfortunate wounded, who were now bloated corpses.

25|$|The Grand Trunk Pacific dock stood {{just north}} of Colman Dock {{at the foot of}} Marion Street. The {{original}} dock was built in 1910 as the largest wooden pier on the West Coast. It was not there for long. On July 30, 1914, it was swept away by an explosion and massive fire. The cause has never been determined. Five people died and 29 more were injured. The flames <b>were</b> <b>hot</b> enough to scorch several parts of Colman Dock, but the fire department managed to contain the fire largely to the one pier. A replacement dock was promptly built, and survived until 1964, when it was replaced by waiting area for automobiles boarding ferries at the new ferry terminal.|$|E

25|$|On April 22, Powell {{repeatedly}} banged {{his head}} into the iron walls of his cell aboard the Saugus. Whether this was a suicide attempt (as his jailers believed) or not, it deeply alarmed military officials. A canvas padded hood, with only a slit for the mouth and nostrils, was fashioned. Powell and all the other prisoners aboard the monitors were forced to wear them 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to prevent any further suicide attempts. Only Mary Surratt and Dr. Mudd were not required to wear the hoods. Powell cried when the hood was placed on him. The hoods <b>were</b> <b>hot,</b> claustrophobic, and uncomfortable, and in the humid confines of the monitors in the steaming Washington summer the prisoners suffered immensely. On June 6, Hartranft ordered them removed—except for Powell's.|$|E
25|$|The light {{construction}} and hollow {{nature of the}} structures allowed the jet fuel to penetrate far inside the towers, igniting many large fires simultaneously over a wide area of the impacted floors. The fuel from the planes burned at most for a few minutes, but {{the contents of the}} buildings burned over the next hour or hour and a half. It has been suggested that the fires might not have been as centrally positioned, nor as intense, had traditionally heavy high-rise construction been {{standing in the way of}} the aircraft. Debris and fuel would likely have remained mostly outside the buildings or concentrated in more peripheral areas away from the building cores, which would then not have become unique failure points. In this scenario, the towers might have stood far longer, perhaps indefinitely. The fires <b>were</b> <b>hot</b> enough to weaken the columns and cause floors to sag, pulling perimeter columns inward and reducing their ability to support the mass of the building above.|$|E
25|$|Kilkenny {{retained}} the Leinster Cup in 1958. However, in a {{change to the}} format of the championship, they were beaten by Tipperary in the All-Ireland semi-final. A third consecutive Leinster title was captured in 1959. However, the All-Ireland final against Waterford ended in a draw. The replay saw a young Eddie Keher make his debut. However, victory went to Waterford. A National League victory in 1962 gave Kilkenny the impetus to recapture the provincial trophy in 1963. In the All-Ireland final Waterford fought back from being 11-points down. However, ‘the Cats’ won by two points. Victory in the Leinster final in 1964 allowed Kilkenny a straight passage into the All-Ireland final where they <b>were</b> <b>hot</b> favourites to retain the title. Tipp. However, had other ideas and captured the title with a fourteen-point victory. Two years later in 1966 Kilkenny won the National League once again. This was later followed by another provincial title and an appearance in the championship decider. Once again, Kilkenny were red hot favourites over a youthful Cork side. However, youth trumped experience as Cork emerged as the victors. 1967 saw Kilkenny win another Leinster title before lining out in their fourth All-Ireland final of the decade. An ageing Tipp team provided the opposition; however, Kilkenny got goals at vital times and secured a famous victory. It was Kilkenny’s first triumph over Tipp in the championship since 1923.|$|E

According to Martin, [...] "a lot of beautiful young women read for Shae. [...] But there's another dimension to Shae as well. She's not as practiced and hardened at this as a more seasoned pro. There's still a girl next door quality to her, a sense of vulnerability, playfulness, and, yes, innocence. [...] All of our Shaes <b>were</b> <b>hot</b> as hell. But only a handful of them captured that other quality, maybe three out of twenty, and Sibel was the standout.
