500|$|In May, The Unquestionable Truth (Part 1) was released. Sammy Siegler {{took over}} {{drumming}} duties {{for the band}} {{for much of the}} album, which featured a more experimental sound, described by Allmusic writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine as [...] "neo-prog alt-metal". At Durst's insistence, the album was released as an underground album, without any advertising or promotion. Borland disagreed with the decision, suggesting that it was [...] "self-sabotage": [...] "Maybe he was already unhappy with the music, and he didn't really <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> out there." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{deciding}} the band's next single, Ray Davies pushed for [...] "Come Dancing" [...] {{to be released}} rather than [...] "Don't Forget to Dance," [...] which had been suggested by the record company as the first single from State of Confusion. The UK branch of Arista Records approved this decision, releasing 7-inch and 12-inch versions of the new single on 19 November 1982 with [...] "Noise" [...] as the B-side. However, Clive Davis initially had reservations; Davies recalls that Davis [...] "didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> out {{because it was too}} much of an English subject matter". Davis also thought it was just a [...] "ditty" [...] and did not have enough substance to be a single.|$|E
500|$|When {{composing}} {{tracks for}} Meet Miley Cyrus, Cyrus was originally very apprehensive {{in regards to}} adding [...] "See You Again" [...] to the album. [...] "I'm not sure about this song. I don't think I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> on the album. I don't really like it that much. It's just O.K.", she said. However, she was convinced to record it and, once {{she listened to the}} finished product, she changed her mind. She thought it was odd, but in a positive light, and decided to include it on her debut album. Cyrus says [...] "See You Again" [...] is a dance song with a special meaning to her. The song was remixed by Rock Mafia for the release of Cyrus' second studio album Breakout (2008).|$|E

500|$|The opening {{episode of}} Sense and Sensibility {{features}} the moment Willoughby seduces Eliza, a young schoolgirl. Davies told Carey and Claire Hill from the Western Mail {{that he wanted}} [...] "to do justice" [...] to Willoughby's back story, {{saying that it is}} [...] "quite interesting and steamy stuff like a lot of underage sex that goes on and is just talked about. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> on the screen." [...] Davies elaborated on this further in an interview with The Independent's Peter Chapman, saying that the seduction and abandonment of a schoolgirl in the novel needed dramatising. He believed readers [...] "hardly notice" [...] the moment, which he felt was very important. The writer noted that the series was [...] "more overtly sexual" [...] than previous adaptations of Austen's works and added, [...] "The novel is as much about sex and money as social conventions." [...] Davies also included a duel between Colonel Brandon and Willoughby in his screenplay, an event that was absent from Lee's film adaptation of the novel.|$|E
2500|$|Roger Salazar, a California Democratic Party {{spokesman}} {{also was}} quoted as saying - [...] "They <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> off onto some massive conspiracy theory... The governor's office is trying to play up the nefarious angle to deflect attention from their own incompetence [...] accidentally posting the recording on its own Web site. And from the recordings themselves." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Not {{to protect}} himself, but to protect her," [...] Peck said, also {{noting that the}} {{decision}} to publish it was made not long after the death of Alice Lee, who had long handled Harper Lee's affairs. [...] "You just don't know how that decision was made... If he had to, he would have flown down to talk to her. I have no doubt." [...] Later in the article, which was posted in The Wall Street Journal, he said, “To me, it was an unedited draft. Do you want to put that early version out there or do you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> in the University of Alabama archives for scholars to look at?” ...|$|E
5000|$|After {{hearing all}} of the fine musicians in the area, he felt {{there was a need}} to form a group because most of them “weren’t playing any jazz, which is the reason they started playing in the first place.” He felt the desire to start a “world-class big band and <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> in a tavern, a beer joint.” ...|$|R

6000|$|The {{end of it}} {{was bound}} to come. Even in Mariposa {{some of the people}} must have thought so.

2500|$|From April to August 2011, RT ran {{a half-hour}} primetime show Adam vs. the Man, hosted by former Iraq War Marine veteran and {{high-profile}} anti-war activist Adam Kokesh. David Weigel writes that Kokesh defended RT's [...] "propaganda" [...] function, saying [...] "We're {{putting out the}} truth {{that no one else}} wants to say. I mean, if you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> in the worst possible abstract, it's the Russian government, which is a competing protection racket against the other governments of the world, going against the United States and calling them on their bullshit." [...] The conservative media watchdog Accuracy in Media criticized Kokesh's appearance on RT, writing RT uses Americans like Kokesh to make propaganda points.|$|E
2500|$|Sean Watkins {{began his}} tenure with Nickel Creek playing mandolin, but later {{switched}} to guitar. The band has released three albums and a CD composed of their hits (called Reasons Why: The Very Best) {{and won a}} Grammy for This Side – a coveted trophy that Watkins reportedly put {{on top of his}} toilet at home. Explaining the somewhat odd situation, Watkins said that [...] "it seems like a humble place. I didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> out in plain view of my house. I didn't feel like displaying it right when you walk in. It's a nice crown for the porcelain." [...] In addition to playing with Nickel Creek, Watkins has released 4 solo albums.|$|E
2500|$|After a year's hiatus, Bale {{returned}} in 2004 to play Trevor Reznik, {{the title character}} in the psychological thriller The Machinist. Bale gained attention for his devotion to the role and for the lengths to which he went to achieve Reznik's emaciated, skeletal appearance. He went without proper rest for prolonged periods, and placed himself on a crash diet of generally coffee and apples, which reduced his weight by 63 pounds (...) {{in a matter of}} months. By the end of filming Bale weighed only 121 pounds (...) , a transformation he described as [...] "very calming mentally" [...] which drew comparisons to Robert De Niro's alternate weight-gaining regimen for his role as Jake LaMotta in the 1980 film Raging Bull. Bale claimed that he had not worked {{for a period of time}} before he was cast in the film: [...] " [...] just hadn't found scripts that I'd really been interested in. So I was really dying for something to arrive. Then when this one did, I just didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> down. I finished it and, upon the kind of revelation that you get at the end, I immediately wanted to go back and re-visit it, to take a look at what clues I could have gotten throughout". The Machinist was a low-budget production, costing roughly US$5million to produce, and was given only a limited US release. It was well received, with the review tallying website Rotten Tomatoes reporting that 77% of the critics' reviews tallied were positive.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the topic}} of Sheila and Lauren's [...] "cat fights", Brown said: [...] "People like cat fights because we {{can get away with}} what you can't get away with in {{everyday}} life. You're living vicariously through me. There might be someone that [...] you just might <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> to someday, and you can't, but you can turn on the TV and see Sheila do it, and get away with it. Being mean and evil and fighting {{and by the end of}} the day, you're spent." [...] On {{the topic of}} Sheila [...] "terrorizing" [...] both Genoa City and Los Angeles while on both soaps, Brown said: [...] "You know, I came to L.A. to start a new life. And well they just didn't make it that easy for me, did they? So I might've shot a gun once or twice again, but it wasn't my fault. You know what, people get what they deserve, they really do. I might've poisoned someone by accident, but he never should've talked to me like that. You just don't do that. Anyway, people get what they deserve, and I think a lot of them have what's coming to them, and I'm not sure I'm done yet." [...] About Sheila's personality, Brown said: [...] "Sheila's just evil. There's nothing bitchy about what she does, [...] it's very straightforward. She's manipulative but never in a bitchy way, in a way to get things accomplished, and get things done the way she wants to. When being nice and being diplomatic and when being all those things don't work any longer, she snaps." [...] On Sheila's relationship with Stephanie Forrester, Brown said: [...] "Stephanie made my life miserable. So anyway, I shot Stephanie. I did. Stephanie felt she could be a better provider for my child than I could. And you know what, you don't keep a mother like Sheila away from her child, you just don't do that. And Stephanie couldn't stop me." [...] Brown also added that, [...] "To be a good villain, you have to make the character real for you." ...|$|E
2500|$|Since its {{inception}} the religion has had involvement in socio-economic development beginning by giving greater freedom to women, promulgating {{the promotion of}} female education as a priority concern, and that involvement was given practical expression by creating schools, agricultural coops, and clinics. The religion entered a new phase of activity when a message of the Universal House of Justice dated 20 October 1983 was released. Bahá'ís were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the Bahá'í teachings, {{in which they could}} become involved in the social and economic development of the communities in which they lived. Worldwide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bahá'í socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482. The modern Brazilian Bahá'í community has members and activities and external interests in issues affecting the religion. And the community continues programs of outreach. In 1986 the Brazilian Society of Physicians for Peace was formed on the initiative of a number of Bahá'í physicians (some 120 medical professionals attend the convocation.) In 2002 the National Spiritual Assembly prepared a list of some 44 names of national religious leaders, theologians, and religious academics, and then sent the letter Letter to the World's Religious Leaders out by mail or personal delivery. As a second step, some 330 copies of the letter were sent to the local Spiritual Assemblies in Brazil, for distribution to local religious leaders. [...] "In Brazilian society, religious divisions are a problem," [...] said Roberto Eghrari, secretary of external affairs for the Brazilian National Spiritual Assembly. [...] "There are tensions between evangelical groups and other Christian denominations, and between Christians and Afro-based religious groups. So we believe the distribution of this message is very timely, that {{it has the potential to}} bring new understandings." [...] Mr. Eghrari said religious leaders have acted with much appreciation. Several groups had indicated a desire for some kind of collaboration or follow-up on the message with the Brazilian Baha'i community. [...] "It is not just a matter of people reading the message. They <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> into action." ...|$|E
