50|$|This missal {{had been}} {{owned by the}} Legh family since at least 1508. It is the only known nearly {{complete}} copy of the earliest edition of a missal according to the Sarum Rite still in existence. When the family moved from the house in 1946, the missal went with them, and was held for safe-keeping in the John Rylands Library in Manchester. In the late 2000s the National Trust acquired it, and {{it was decided to}} return it to Lyme Park. To celebrate this the décor of the library was restored to the way it had been during the 19th century. This included re-graining of its ceiling, reproducing velvet for the upholstery and curtains, and re-papering the room with replica <b>wallpaper,</b> <b>based</b> on its original design.|$|R
5000|$|Opening in 2004, Spinball Whizzer {{featured}} a loose pinball machine theme. The name was a pun on the song [...] "Pinball Wizard" [...] by The Who. In 2010, {{it was announced}} that Spinball Whizzer would be receiving a Sonic the Hedgehog re-brand as part of a partnership with Japanese video game company Sega. The roller coaster was therefore given a red and blue track repaint; new decoys, signage and audio, including songs from the games (with the station announcements done by Sonic's voice actor Roger Craig Smith). The ride re-opened to the public as Sonic Spinball on 13 February 2010 during the park's February half term event. A Sonic-themed room was also made available at the Alton Towers Hotel, which featured various playable Sonic games and <b>wallpaper</b> <b>based</b> on Sonic the Hedgehog 4: Episode I.|$|R

The theater was gutted by fire in 1818, and his decorations survive only in written descriptions. The following year, he helped Chalgrin decorate a full-scale wood, stucco and canvas mockup of the proposed Arc de Triomphe. In 1811, he painted Romulus and Remus above {{the doors of the}} Sénat at the Palais du Luxembourg for the baptism of Napoléon François Charles Joseph Bonaparte. From 1800 to 1814, he created designs for the Manufacture de Sèvres. Then, from 1814 to 1816, he collaborated with Merry-Joseph Blondel in creating a collection of <b>wallpapers</b> <b>based</b> on the theme of Cupid and Psyche, from a story by Jean de La Fontaine. In 1816, taking advantage of a peaceful period, he visited London, where King George III commissioned him to create decorations for a celebration at Carlton House.|$|R

40|$|Almost all source {{material}} in Papyrus {{is derived from}} recordings {{of a variety of}} paper, from notepaper to large sheets of wallpaper. I recorded much of this material during the creation of a soundtrack for a theatre production of The Yellow <b>Wallpaper,</b> <b>based</b> on the novel by Charlotte Perkins Gilman. A site-specific production of the theatre adaptation was directed by Rob Drummer and performed at the Manchester Museum in May 2008. While composing the soundtrack I was fascinated by the intricate sonic details present in the closely recorded paper and was keen to explore their potential further in a standalone acousmatic concert work. As a result, Papyrus explores the wide variety of spatial motions, trajectories and perspectives which can be created through the manipulation of this seemingly simple and lifeless material. Through the course of the work the sounds of paper gather energy and they form increasingly animated behaviours within a changing abstract landscape. There are four sections, each one seemingly revealed through a metaphorical ‘tearing’ of the wallpaper. This work exists independently of the theatre soundtrack. However the transformations in this piece reflect the behaviour of the woman behind the wallpaper in the novel: a development from hypnotic creeping in the shadows to ‘mechanical and ugly movements’ in a ‘twisting and twisted dance. ...|$|R

Peppermint Six has also moved to the Gnome Search Tool which has a more intuitive user interface, and finer grained control of search criteria. The new <b>Wallpaper</b> Manager (<b>based</b> on Nitrogen) now makes wallpaper management a breeze. Linux Mint’s USB creation tools “mintstick” are now included by default, making the creation of LiveUSBs from isohybrid ISO images, and the formatting of USB sticks, as simple as it gets.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this project {{is to build a}} computational model based on crystallographic groups to perceive real-world near-periodic patterns. Symmetry or near-symmetry is a pervasive phenomena in both natural and man-made environments. A computational model for symmetry is particularly pertinent to robotics and computer vision research where we are studying how a man-made intelligent being can perceive and interact with the chaotic real world in the most effective manner. Being able to reason about symmetries is the first step towards minimizing redundancy and capturing the essential degrees of freedom of a problem, and can often lead to drastic reductions in computation. Our computational model for periodic pattern perception is based on the solution to Hilbert’s 18 th problem: there is a finite number of symmetry groups for all possible periodic patterns in each  -dimensional space. When  ¢¡¤ £ there are seven frieze groups, and when ¥¡§ ¦ there are 17 <b>wallpaper</b> groups. <b>Based</b> on these mathematical proofs we are able to construct a computationally tractable framework to automatically classify all types of periodic patterns. Being able to tolerate departures from perfect symmetry reflects one’s level of sophistication in perception. To this end, we study the combination of group theory with statistical learning theory and geometric model selection in various applications where near-periodic patterns dominate (see projects below and Figure 1). Symmetry Group Classification for Real World Near-periodic Patterns (Euclidean version...|$|R
5000|$|The {{look of the}} President's Dining Room {{was defined}} by its {{wallpaper}}. The wallpaper was a 1960 reproduction of paper printed by Zuber et Cie in France {{some time in the}} early to mid 1800s. It was discovered in a London antique shop by Kennedy friend and socialite Brooke Astor. Known as [...] "Scenes of Revolutionary America", the wallpaper depicts various events in the American Revolutionary War. The <b>wallpaper</b> is <b>based</b> on an 1834 wallpaper printed by Zuber, [...] "Scenic America", which depicted various American landscapes and which Kennedy had hung in the Diplomatic Reception Room. ("Scenic America", in turn was derived from engravings made by Engelmann in the 1820s.) To match the colors of the wallpaper, window draperies of blue and green silk damask were hung in the room. Their design was a copy of an early 1800s design found in a book. These were topped by window treatments of green silk with gold bullion fringe. A Hereke rug from Turkey, in a similar color style, covered the floor. A mantel made of plaster mixed with other materials, installed over the fireplace in the east wall in 1952, was retained. Designed about 1815 by Robert Welford in Philadelphia, the mantel is inscribed with Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry's famous message, issued after the Battle of Lake Erie in 1813: [...] "We have met the enemy, and they are ours". The room was lit with an Empire style chandelier, manufactured in the 1700s by Waterford Crystal and purchased in London by banker and art collector Chester Dale. It was given to the White House in 1948.|$|R
30|$|A more {{specific}} focus on linguistic knowledge {{is found in}} the work of (Dearman and Truong 2012). Vocabulary Wallpaper is an interactive application for a mobile phone which incorporates vocabulary learning as a live wallpaper using the user’s location to display relevant vocabulary (for example, nouns and verbs), linked to where the user is in their day to day activities (for example, a coffee shop or a supermarket). Dearman and Truong stated that the Vocabulary <b>Wallpaper</b> application was <b>based</b> on the notion of microlearning, which occurs in the brief pervasive learning opportunity windows, for example, when users are waiting in a queue in a coffee shop or in a lift at a hotel. The EK develops on the valuable work of Lee, Doh, Ogata, Dearman and Truong, which showed that context-aware environments can support object-specific vocabulary training. We propose that as well as more traditional exercises, everyday real world tasks can be augmented by technology in an almost invisible way to engage users in learning by doing which goes beyond the word level.|$|R
40|$|Pattern {{design is}} a {{territory}} {{which has been}} widely explored by many during {{a long period of}} time. With this project I hope to shine a new light on wallpaper design, the area on which I’ve applied my patterns to. The inspiration for this wallpaper collection originated in a past project in which I experimented with weaving strips of paper together in different ways. During this time I found myself curious to investigate how this kind of weaving could be applied to textiles, wallpapers, etc. My main focus in this project has been about creating interesting patterns in which unexpected motifs are woven together. I’ve also touched on the subject of creating a kind of conceptual wallpaper constructed by weaving strips of <b>wallpaper</b> together. I <b>based</b> my patterns on a series of drawings that I created during the course leading up to this project. For example, one of the four patterns consists of books where the pages has been cut to strips and then been woven together. The final result conists of a wallpaper sample book in which I’ve collected all four patterns in three colourways each. For some added value I included two types of handwowen wallpapers in my collection book, as to give a sense of what might come next...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this essay}} is to examine how {{people living in the}} Swedish {{countryside}} looked upon changes in the interiors through modernization in 1850 - 90. For the first time, there was an abundance of objects available in stores in the countryside {{that the majority of the}} population had money buy. Many novelties were introduced in the interior decoration of ordinary peoples´ homes. This study focuses on the introduction and use of <b>wallpaper</b> and is <b>based</b> on a questionnaire about wallpaper sent from the Nordiska museet, National museum of Culture history in Sweden, to people all over Sweden in 1948. 148 people responded to the questions about use and attitudes toward wallpaper during the second half of the 19 th century. My theoretical perspective is cultural diffusion, the spread of cultural items, more specific the diffusion of innovations from larger to smaller places, often influenced by social elites, hierarchical diffusion, and between individuals, contagious diffusion. The analytical perspective used for the analysis is based on the concepts of basic and variable modernity, initiated by the historian Sven-Eric Liedman. Basic modernity describes the structural modernization in society as a whole within the fields of economy, technology and natural sciences. The variable modernity represents the different attitudes, likes and dislikes, opinions, viewpoints and cultural differences every individual possesses, the attitudes that decide how and if the modernity is received in each household. My intent has been to ascertain the factors that made production and distribution of relatively cheap wallpaper all over Sweden possible, pinpoint the most important driving forces for creating an interest in wallpaper within the villages, discover how wallpaper was introduced in the individual homes of farmers and how wallpaper was received. The use of wallpaper in the interiors has been examined in order to find out if, and how the modernization affected and was affected by the way people were living their lives within the home...|$|R
