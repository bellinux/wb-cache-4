25|$|Such {{moments in}} life are just as memorable as when one is {{appointed}} to prominent positions. When my comrades took farewell to me, I was equally moved as I had ever been when I was given an important office. What I thought most about <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had finished my duties towards the people, the Party and the state. This memory is very precious to me.|$|E
25|$|If I {{knew what}} I know now I {{probably}} would have switched. At the time I had already been playing two or three years, {{and it seemed like}} I had been playing a long time. I thought I’d never be able to change the way I played. The reality of the situation <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> hadn’t been playing very long at all, and I probably could have spent {{the same amount of time}} learning to play right handed. I did have a go at it, but I just didn’t have the patience. It seemed impossible to me. I decided to make do with what I had, and I made some plastic fingertips for myself. I just persevered with it.|$|E
500|$|.....I {{wanted to}} eat of the fruit of all {{the trees in the}} garden of the world... And so, indeed, I went out, and so I lived. My only mistake <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{confined}} myself so exclusively to the trees of what seemed to me the sun-lit side of the garden, and shunned the other side for its shadow and its gloom.|$|E

6000|$|... "I don't {{indulge in}} pumpkin pies myself, for two reasons," [...] he said. [...] "One reason <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>I</b> to eat {{pumpkins}} I {{would become a}} cannibal, and the other reason <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> never eat, not being hollow inside." ...|$|R
500|$|He told Rose: [...] "And look, I'm on bail for a murder. I know I'm stupid, but I'm {{not that}} stupid. There's helicopters, police photographers everywhere. All I {{could think about}} <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> didn't want to lose my bail." [...] He said he had first learned of Blakelock's death when he heard cheering in the {{apartment}} he was staying in, {{in response to a}} news report about it.|$|E
500|$|In 2001, Chabon {{reflected}} {{on the success of}} his first novel by saying that while [...] "the upside <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was published and I got a readership, ... downside ... was that, emotionally, this stuff started happening and I was still like, 'Wait a minute, is my thesis done yet?' It took me a few years to catch up." [...] In 1991, Chabon published A Model World, a collection of short stories, many of which had been published previously in The New Yorker.|$|E
500|$|To all the praise, Youngblood responded, [...] "I don't {{consider}} myself tough, I {{consider myself}} a nut {{for some of the}} things I did". Youngblood concluded, [...] "I wasn’t the biggest guy, I certainly wasn’t the strongest and I wasn’t the fastest either. [...] But I think one of my biggest assets <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had an undeniable determination to be the best that has ever {{put his hand on the}} ground, I had a genuine desire to be great." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Say {{the word}} at once {{if it has}} to <b>be</b> said,--so <b>that</b> <b>I</b> may know what it <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have to contend with.

If there be none, say so." ...|$|R

"'It is not finished,' he said, 'and what I {{have written}} does not {{altogether}} satisfy me; {{but you can}} judge from what you have heard how it <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> think of <b>that</b> lady, and how impossible it <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> can in any way banish her from my mind, or willingly from my vision.' ...|$|R
500|$|A small copy of {{the ring}} was made for Victoria, who wrote in a letter, [...] "The Archbishop had (most awkwardly) put the ring on the wrong finger, and the {{consequence}} <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had the greatest difficulty {{to take it off}} again, which I at last did with great pain". In fact, the ring had been sized to fit the queen's little finger instead of her ring finger due to a misunderstanding by the jewellers. It was left to the Crown upon her death in 1901 and is on display at the Tower of London.|$|E
500|$|Vargas Llosa {{also built}} {{an image of}} the regime with the troubled {{historical}} events. With regard to the historical accuracy of the book, Vargas Llosa has said [...] "It's a novel, not a history book, so I took many, many liberties. The only limitation I imposed on myself <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was not going to invent anything that couldn't have happened within the framework of life in the Dominican Republic. I have respected the basic facts, but I have changed and deformed many things {{in order to make the}} story more persuasiveand I have not exaggerated." ...|$|E
500|$|Regarding the band's reunion, Lytle noted, [...] "The bargain I {{made myself}} {{regarding}} the 'brief reunion and couple of shows' situation <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> wasn't gonna {{talk too much}} about it. I was just gonna stew on it, and then do it. That's {{the good thing about}} festivals. No need for me to sell anything here. Get in, rock out, get paid, get out. There are just going to be a few shows. Festival-type thingies. Perhaps the odd 'warm up gig' in someone's hair salon or something. Money was a motivating factor (resurfacing my indoor tennis court, oil change for my 4×4 Ferrari) but the idea of playing and hanging out with each other is something all of the guys are pretty stoked about." ...|$|E

"Sane, when <b>I</b> believe <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{have seen}} and {{experienced}} {{a great number of}} things which I know it to <b>be</b> quite impossible <b>that</b> <b>I</b> should have seen or experienced.

My idea <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> shall do so before long, in comfort. My idea also <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> she will <b>be</b> the last to complain of any discomfort which may arise from my straitened circumstances at present. My idea <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> preparing for myself a happy and independent life. My idea also is,--and <b>I</b> assure you <b>that</b> of all my ideas {{this is the one}} to which I cling with the fondest assurance,--that I will do my very best to make her life happy when she comes to grace my home." ...|$|R
500|$|When Anderson first {{wrote the}} episode, {{she did not}} hint that Scully and Mulder had had sex. Spotnitz and the {{production}} crew, however, felt it was natural to suggest that Scully and Mulder's relationship may have evolved into a romantic one. The idea of heart chakra crop circles was included because Anderson wanted [...] "whatever Mulder was involved in that took him away from me, away from Washington, to somehow tie into what it <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was going through—the journey that I was going through". As such, Anderson dedicated {{much of her time}} researching both crop circles and heart chakras, but she later gave additional credit to Spotnitz, who she noted was also heavily involved during the researching process.|$|E
500|$|On July 29, 1966, Dylan crashed his 500cc Triumph Tiger 100 {{motorcycle}} {{near his}} home in Woodstock, New York, and was thrown to the ground. Though the extent of his injuries was never disclosed, Dylan said that he broke several vertebrae in his neck. Mystery still surrounds the circumstances of the accident since no ambulance was called to the scene and Dylan was not hospitalized. Dylan's biographers have written that the crash offered Dylan the chance to escape the pressures around him. Dylan confirmed this interpretation in his autobiography: [...] "I had been in a motorcycle accident and I'd been hurt, but I recovered. Truth <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{wanted to get out of}} the rat race." [...] Dylan withdrew from public and, apart from a few appearances, did not tour again for almost eight years.|$|E
500|$|When, {{several years}} after its passage, the 1873 law became a {{political}} issue, some {{of those involved in}} enacting it, including Sherman and Linderman, stated that there had been no intent to end bimetallism in the elimination of the authority for private citizens to have silver bullion coined into dollars. They argued that the 1853 legislation had ended the practice of having bullion struck into smaller-denomination coins; the 1873 act simply rectified an omission and eliminated a coin with a low mintage that did not circulate. They were not always consistent in their denials: Boutwell wrote in his memoirs that [...] "in 1873 I had come to believe that it was wise for every nation to recognize, establish, and maintain the gold standard... hence it <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> determined to abandon the idea of a double [...] standard.|$|E

500|$|Christian Scientists {{call this}} [...] "the fall in Lynn," [...] {{and see it}} as the birth of their religion. Decades later Eddy wrote that, on the third day after the fall, she had been helped by reading a certain Bible passage. In several editions of Science and Health she {{identified}} it as Mark 3, but later said that it had been Matthew 9:2–8, a passage about Jesus healing the paralytic at Capernaum: [...] "As I read, the healing Truth dawned upon my sense; and the result <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> rose, dressed myself, and ever after was in better health than I had before enjoyed." [...] The physician who treated her at the time, Alvin M. Cushing, swore in an affidavit in 1907 that the injury had not been a serious one, and that Eddy had responded to morphine and a homeopathic remedy; she had not said anything to him about a miraculous healing.|$|E
500|$|Cannon {{was awarded}} the Heisman Trophy as the nation's most {{outstanding}} player in 1959. He had 598 rushing yards, and although he scored only six touchdowns in total, his performance on Halloween night and his defensive play throughout the season was enough to convince voters. [...] "The thing that clinched the Heisman for me <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> made a play or two in a big game", he later explained. He received the award from Vice President Richard Nixon during a ceremony on December 9 at the Downtown Athletic Club in New York City. Cannon was the second player from the SEC to win the trophy, following Georgia's Frank Sinkwich in 1942. He received {{more than five times}} as many first-place votes as the runner-up. Cannon was also a repeat winner of nearly every award he won the previous season, including unanimous All-America recognition. Shortly after the 1959 season, the LSU football team retired Cannon's number 20 jersey. It was the only jersey retired by the team until Tommy Casanova's was also retired in 2009.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "All Is Full of Love" [...] was {{directed}} by Chris Cunningham. Björk was impressed by Cunningham's original music videos for IDM musicians Autechre, Squarepusher, and Aphex Twin, and by his clear lines, science fiction inclinations, and discordant imagery. This resulted in the singer contacting him to meet at his London office; she brought Chinese Kama Sutra {{as a guide to}} what she wanted. Cunningham had also associated the track with sex upon hearing it, but could not {{figure out how to make}} the video explicit yet broadcastable. Regarding this, the singer confessed, [...] "I think the only thing I said <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> thought it was very white [...] and I'm trying to describe some sort of a heaven. But I wanted also to have the other level there, there would be lust, it wouldn't be just clean". She complemented saying she mentioned that the video should be [...] "white" [...] and [...] "frozen", and then it [...] "melts because of love" [...] and [...] "making love".|$|E

"Will you deign {{to allow}} me, mejuffrouw," [...] he said, [...] "at any rate {{to tell you}} one certain, {{unvarnished}} truth, which mayhap you will not even care to believe, and <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would give my life--the few chances, <b>that</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> still have of it--to obliterate from your mind {{the memory of the}} past few days." ...|$|R

500|$|The raid {{did not go}} as planned. Standard {{procedure}} was to line up the patrons, check their identification, and have female police officers take customers dressed as women {{to the bathroom to}} verify their sex, upon which any men dressed as women would be arrested. Those dressed as women that night refused to go with the officers. Men in line began to refuse to produce their identification. The police decided to take everyone present to the police station, after separating those cross-dressing in a room {{in the back of the}} bar. Maria Ritter, then known as Steve to her family, recalled, [...] "My biggest fear <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would get arrested. My second biggest fear was that my picture would be in a newspaper or on a television report in my mother's dress!" [...] Both patrons and police recalled that a sense of discomfort spread very quickly, spurred by police who began to assault some of the lesbians by [...] "feeling some of them up inappropriately" [...] while frisking them.|$|E
500|$|Paul Newman's character, Luke, is a {{decorated}} war veteran who is sentenced to serve {{two years in}} a Florida rural prison. He constantly defies the authorities of the facility, becoming a leader among the prisoners, as well as escaping multiple times. While the script was being developed, the leading role was initially considered for Jack Lemmon or Telly Savalas. Newman asked to play the leading role after hearing about the project. In order to develop his character, he traveled to West Virginia, where he recorded local accents and surveyed people's behavior. George Kennedy turned in an Academy Award-winning performance {{as the leader of the}} prisoners, Dragline, who fights Luke, and comes to respect him. During the nomination process, worried about the box office success of Camelot and Bonnie and Clyde, Kennedy invested US$5,000 in trade advertising to promote himself. Kennedy later stated that thanks to the award his salary was [...] "multiplied by ten the minute (he) won," [...] also adding [...] "the happiest part <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> didn't have to play only villains anymore." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Listen to the Rain on the Roof" [...] {{was written}} by series creator Marc Cherry and series writer Jeff Greenstein and {{directed}} by Larry Shaw. Cherry's decision to advance the storylines by six months for the third season premiere came {{as a response to}} the series' problematic second season. Cherry stated that he regretted most of the second season, as scheduling problems made it difficult to plan the season's storylines. [...] "One of the problems I had with Season 2 <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had to keep going with the previous year's stuff," [...] he explained. [...] "I learned you have to go back to square one to build up the tension again." [...] The cast also expressed disappointment in the second season; James Denton considered leaving the show and Marcia Cross confessed: [...] "I've been at Marc's door plenty of times [...] going, 'You've got to be kidding.'" [...] Cherry stated that the six-month time jump would help the storylines develop quicker, as the second season's storylines lagged. He added: [...] "And I'm going to work much harder to criss-cross all the women's stories so that their lives bump up against each other." ...|$|E
