5|$|One {{can also}} {{calculate}} auto fatalities per driver's license. From 1990 to 2009, this number {{has also been}} improving: from 1 death per 3,745 driver's licenses in 1990 to 1 per 6,200 driver's licenses in 2009. Crowded, traffic-choked Northeastern cities including Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Boston, Providence, Philadelphia, Newark, Hartford, New Haven, Springfield and Worcester, Massachusetts, <b>were</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have car accidents. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration through its Fatality Analysis Reporting System stated that auto fatalities {{continue to be the}} leading cause of death for young adults.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} tournament ended, the ICC {{announced}} that the World Cups in 2015 and 2019 would contain ten teams; the Associate countries, who <b>were</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> miss out in a tournament with fewer teams strongly objected, and, led by Ireland, urged the ICC to reconsider. In June the decision was reversed. After the World Cup Ireland played Pakistan, England, and Scotland in ODIs but lost each match. A further ODI against Sri Lanka was rained off. In all, Ireland played 12ODIs in 2011, winning four.|$|E
5|$|By the show's tenth {{anniversary in}} 1979, 9 million American {{children}} under the age of six were watching Sesame Street daily. Four out of five children had watched it over a six-week period, and 90% of children from low-income inner-city homes regularly viewed the show. According to a 1993 survey conducted by the US Department of Education, out of the show's 6.6 million viewers, 2.4 million kindergartners regularly watched it. 77% of preschoolers watched it once a week, and 86% of kindergartners, first-, and second-grade students had watched it once a week before starting school. The show reached most young children in almost all demographic groups, most significantly economically disadvantaged children; 88% of children from low-income families and 90% of both African-American and Latino children watched the show before entering kindergarten. Over 80% of children from all minority language groups watched it before starting school. Children from the poorest communities <b>were</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be regular viewers, as were younger children. Children whose parents did not read to them regularly were less likely to be regular viewers, and children of highly educated parents stopped viewing earlier than children from disadvantaged households.|$|E

5|$|Clan chieftains, like clan chiefs, may {{wear their}} own {{personal}} crest within a plain circlet inscribed with their own motto or slogan. Clan chieftains may also wear two small eagle feathers (unlike the chief's three). On certain occasions real eagle feathers may be worn behind the crest badge. If a clan chieftain {{is a member of}} the British Peerage or a feudal baron they are permitted to wear the appropriate coronet or baronial chapeau above the circlet on their crest badge. Recently feudal barons have taken to wearing two eagle feathers behind their armiger's badge but there is no ancient tradition of this and it is solely based upon the fact that anciently feudal barons <b>were</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have been chiefs or chieftains. If the feudal baron is a member of a clan it is advisable to consult the clan chief on clan customs and traditions. The Lord Lyon only gives guidance and not governance on the wearing of feathers and recommends consulting with a clan chief who approves the number of feathers worn by members of the clan.|$|E
5|$|Storms <b>were</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> {{occur in}} May, {{followed}} by December. Out of all recorded storms in the database, only one cyclone {{was reported in}} the month of March; the 1908 March hurricane, as well as one tropical storm in February, which was the 1952 Groundhog Day Storm. In addition, only three tropical or subtropical cyclones formed in April ndash& a subtropical storm in 1992, Tropical Storm Ana of 2003, and Tropical Storm Arlene of 2017. A hurricane in 1938, a tropical storm in 1951, a subtropical storm in 1978, and Hurricane Alex of 2016 occurred in January. Of all cyclones during the off-season, Hurricane Lili in 1984 lasted the longest, for a total of 12 days. Hurricane Epsilon, which formed in November, maintained hurricane status for five days in December 2005, longer than any other storm in December; the previous record was two and a half days, set by Hurricane Lili in 1984. Additionally, Hurricane Alice in 1954–1955 and Tropical Storm Zeta in 2005–2006 were the only recorded cyclones to have spanned two calendar years.|$|E

25|$|Examination of {{mitochondrial}} DNA lineages {{showed that}} the neolithic culture (Austronesian) had been evolving within Island Southeast Asia (ISEA) {{for a longer period}} than previously believed. Per co-author Dr Oppenheimer, from the Oxford University School of Anthropology, population migrations <b>were</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have been driven by climate change—the effects of the drowning of a huge ancient peninsula called Sundaland, that extended the Asian landmass as far as Borneo and Java.|$|E

The cavalry alae ("wings") and the larger ships all had their medical officers, the medici alarum and the medici triremis respectively.|$|E
25|$|The {{nature of}} the Majapahit empire and its extent is subject to debate. It may have had limited or entirely {{notional}} influence {{over some of the}} tributary states, including Sumatra, the Malay Peninsula, Kalimantan, and eastern Indonesia, over which authority was claimed in the Nagarakretagama. Geographical and economic constraints suggest that rather than a regular centralised authority, the outer states <b>were</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have been connected mainly by trade connections, which were probably a royal monopoly. It also claimed relationships with Champa, Cambodia, Siam, southern Burma, and Vietnam, and even sent missions to China.|$|E

25|$|There is {{a strong}} {{correlation}} between the type and age of a household's family structure and homeownership. As of 2006, married couple families, which also have the highest median income of any household type, <b>were</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> own a home. Age played a significant role as well with homeownership increasing with the age of the householder until age 65, when a slight decrease becomes visible. While only 43% of households with a householder under the age of thirty-five owned a home, 81.6% of those with a householder between the ages of 55 and 64 did.|$|E
25|$|The {{resolution}} further {{specified that}} the army would go to battle only when the Congress {{and the people of}} India asked it to. It did not however, specify the army was to interact with the Japanese forces. This resolution was circulated among the Indian PoWs, followed by tour of the mainland camps by Mohan Singh and Fujiwara. The PoW headquarters was subsequently dissolved and the staff were transferred to Mohan Singh's supreme command. On 9 May, Singh began recruiting for the INA. The process involved identifying units that <b>were</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> come up with volunteers. These units were transferred to Neesoon and Bidadary, while the other units were shipped away to other camps.|$|E
25|$|A {{study from}} Leeds University and {{published}} in Molecular Biology and Evolution, examining mitochondrial DNA lineages, suggested that humans had been occupying the islands of Southeast Asia {{for a longer period}} than previously believed. Population dispersals seem to have occurred {{at the same time as}} sea levels rose, which may have resulted in migrations from the Philippine Islands to as far north as Taiwan within the last 10,000 years. The population migrations <b>were</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have been driven by climate change – the effects of the drowning of an ancient continent. Rising sea levels in three massive pulses may have caused flooding and the submerging of the Sunda continent, creating the Java and South China Seas and the thousands of islands that make up Indonesia and the Philippines today.|$|E

25|$|The {{number of}} murders dropped to 594 in 2007, 12 {{fewer than the}} {{previous}} year. One-third of the 2007 murders were stabbings and another third were by firearm. In 2007, there were 190 stabbings and 188 shootings. Handguns were used in two-thirds of all firearm murders. Seventy-four youths were accused of murder, down 11 from the previous year. About eighty-four percent of murders were done by someone known to the victim. Male victims of homicide <b>were</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be killed by an acquaintance, someone known to them through a criminal relationship, or a stranger. Female victims of homicide were most frequently killed by a current or former intimate partner, or another family member. The province with the highest crime rate was Manitoba while the lowest crime rates occurred in Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland and Labrador.|$|E
25|$|Murtagh (2003) {{investigated}} {{retention and}} attrition of L2-Irish in Ireland with second level school students. At Time 1, {{she found that}} most participants were motivated instrumentally, yet the immersion students <b>were</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be motivated integratively {{and they had the}} most positive attitudes towards learning Irish. Immersion school students {{were also more likely to}} have opportunities to use Irish outside the classroom/school environment. Self-reports correlated with ability. She concludes that the educational setting (immersion schools, for example) and the use of the language outside the classroom were the best predictors for L2-Irish acquisition. Eighteen months later, Murtagh finds that the majority of groups 1 and 2 believe their Irish ability has attrited, the immersion group less so. The results from the tests, however, do not show any overall attrition. Time as a factor did not exert any overall significant change on the sample's proficiency in Irish (Murtagh, 2003:159).|$|E
25|$|The {{legalization of}} {{sterilization}} {{was followed by}} a steady increase in the popularity of the procedure, both among the Puerto Rican population and among physicians working in Puerto Rico. Though sterilization could be performed on men and women, women <b>were</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> undergo the procedure. Sterilization was most frequently recommended by physicians because of a pervasive belief that Puerto Ricans and the poor were not intelligent enough to use other forms of contraception. Physicians and hospitals alike also implemented hospital policy to encourage sterilization, with some hospitals refusing to admit healthy pregnant women for delivery unless they consented to be sterilized. This has been best documented at Presbyterian Hospital, where the unofficial policy for a time was to refuse admittance for delivery to women who already had three living children unless she consented to sterilization. There is additional evidence that true informed consent was not obtained from patients before they underwent sterilization, if consent was solicited at all.|$|E
