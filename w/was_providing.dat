5|$|When World War I began, Macmillan {{looked for}} peace {{activism}} {{on the part}} of NUWSS. Instead, she found a majority of British women were in favour of helping the men win the war. Her pacifism was not at all passive—soon after hostilities broke out, she travelled to Flushing, Netherlands on a mission of mercy. By late October 1914 she <b>was</b> <b>providing</b> food for refugees from the fall of Antwerp.

5|$|After {{the rest}} day, Australia {{proceeded}} to reach 460/7Keith Miller making 74before Bradman declared, setting England {{a target of}} 596 midway through the afternoon. The hosts reached 106/3 at stumps on the fourth day, but then collapsed on the final morning to be all out for 186, handing Australia a 409-run victory. Cyril Washbrook and Tom Dollery top-scored for England with 37 apiece. Ernie Toshack had the pick of the figures with 5/40 while Lindwall took 3/61. Although Toshack had the better figures, commentators credited Lindwall with orchestrating the England collapse; {{at the start of}} the innings he bowled at leading English batsmen Len Hutton at great pace before dismissing him. Hutton had appeared very unsettled by Lindwall and played meekly. He was severely criticised for his timid manner and was controversially dropped for the following match as the selectors thought he <b>was</b> <b>providing</b> a poor example to the junior members of the team. The Australians were very pleased with this decision, which they believed to be wrong, as they regarded Hutton as their most formidable opponent. The match set a new record for the highest attendance at a Test in England.|$|E

5|$|As part of No.9 Group's {{contribution}} to the Admiralty Islands campaign, No.73 Wing took up garrison duties at Los Negros commencing in March 1944. Its complement of combat squadrons was again Nos.76, 77 and 79 Squadrons, supported by No.49 Operational Base Unit, No.114 Mobile Fighter Sector, No.27 Air Stores Park and No.26 Medical Clearing Station, among other ancillaries, with total ground staff numbering approximately 900. The fighters' primary duty <b>was</b> <b>providing</b> air cover for Allied shipping; they also carried out bomber escort, ground attack and anti-shipping missions in the region. In mid-April, the wing escorted the largest Allied convoy in the South-West Pacific to that date, 80 ships carrying 30,000 personnel, from Finschhafen to Aitape. Completing its garrison work in the Admiralties that June, No.73 Wing was disbanded at Los Negros on 29August 1944. Its combat units were all eventually transferred to other formations under No.10 Operational Group (later renamed the Australian First Tactical Air Force). Nos.76 and 77 Squadrons joined another Kittyhawk unit, No.82 Squadron, at No.81 Wing on Noemfoor under Steege's command, while No.79 Squadron was withdrawn to Darwin in November to re-equip with new Spitfires before joining No.80 Wing and returning to the Pacific at Morotai in March 1945.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, the Caliphate's fiscal basis had shrunk {{dramatically}} {{after so many}} tax-paying provinces had been lost from the central government's control. The caliphal government was now increasingly reliant on the revenue of the Sawad and the other areas of lower Iraq, which were witnessing a rapid decline in agricultural productivity due to the disruption of the civil wars and neglect of the irrigation network. In the reign of Harun al-Rashid (786–809) the Sawad had provided an annual revenue of 102,500,000 dirhams, {{more than double the}} revenue of Egypt and three times that of Syria; by the early 10th century it <b>was</b> <b>providing</b> {{less than a third of}} that figure. The situation was further exacerbated by the fact that in the remaining provinces, semi-autonomous governors, grandees and members of the dynasty were able to establish virtual latifundia, aided by the system of muqāṭa'a, a form of tax farming in exchange for a fixed tribute, which they often failed to pay. To maximise their revenue from the territory remaining to them, the Abbasids increased the breadth and complexity of the central bureaucracy, dividing the provinces into smaller tax districts as well as increasing the number of the fiscal departments (dīwāns), allowing for close oversight of both revenue collection and the activities of the officials themselves.|$|E
5|$|During {{the fifth}} season, the Syndicate {{discovered}} that Covarrubias had betrayed them and <b>was</b> <b>providing</b> information to Mulder. Covarrubias was infected with black oil during her {{betrayal of the}} Syndicate, and Syndicate scientists used her to test a vaccine they had been working to create. While the Syndicate-developed vaccine proves ineffective, Covarrubias' infection is ultimately cured by an effective vaccine stolen from a Russian shadow-government group by Alex Krycek. In the following season, Covarrubias is discovered by FBI agent Jeffrey Spender (Chris Owens) at a decontamination chamber. She begs him to help her escape the facility, addressing him by name as well as giving him information about the whereabouts of his mother, Cassandra. Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea), a former Syndicate agent now acting alone, is also present at the facility. He declines to help the pair, and leaves Covarrubias for dead.|$|E

5|$|Edward {{took the}} crusader's cross in an {{elaborate}} ceremony on 24June 1268, {{with his brother}} Edmund and cousin Henry of Almain. Among others who committed themselves to the Ninth Crusade were Edward's former adversaries – like the Earl of Gloucester, though de Clare did not ultimately participate. With the country pacified, the greatest impediment to the project <b>was</b> <b>providing</b> sufficient finances. King LouisIX of France, who {{was the leader of}} the crusade, provided a loan of about £17,500. This, however, was not enough; the rest had to be raised through a tax on the laity, which had not been levied since 1237. In May 1270, Parliament granted a tax of a twentieth, in exchange for which the King agreed to reconfirm Magna Carta, and to impose restrictions on Jewish money lending. On 20August Edward sailed from Dover for France. Historians have not determined the size of the force with any certainty, but Edward probably brought with him around 225knights and altogether fewer than 1000men.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{development}} of vaccines in the mid-1950s, mass vaccination campaigns took place in many countries. In the US, after a campaign promoted by the March of Dimes, the annual number of polio cases fell dramatically; the last outbreak was in 1979. In 1988 the World Health Organisation along with others launched the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, and by 1994 the Americas were declared {{to be free of}} disease, followed by the Pacific region in 2000 and Europe in 2003. At the end of 2012, only 223 cases were reported by the World Health Organisation. Mainly poliovirus type 1 infections, 122 occurred in Nigeria, one in Chad, 58 in Pakistan and 37 in Afghanistan. Vaccination teams often face danger; seven vaccinators were murdered in Pakistan and nine in Nigeria at the beginning of 2013. In Pakistan, the campaign was further hampered by the murder on 26 February 2013 of a police officer who <b>was</b> <b>providing</b> security.|$|E
5|$|In January 1944, No.77 Squadron {{took part}} in the two largest raids mounted by the RAAF to that time, each {{involving}} over seventy aircraft attacking targets in New Britain. It was subsequently assigned to Los Negros in the Admiralty Islands, under the control of No.73 Wing, along with Nos.76 and 79 Squadrons. No.77 Squadron's ground party went ashore at Los Negros on 6March, {{in the middle of a}} firefight with Japanese forces. Fourteen of the squadron's Kittyhawks arrived a week later, and another ten on 28March. Their primary duty <b>was</b> <b>providing</b> air cover for Allied shipping, though no Japanese aircraft were encountered; they also flew ground-attack missions in support of US troops on Manus Island. Following the capture of the Admiralties, which completed the isolation of Rabaul, No.77 Squadron remained with No.73 Wing on garrison duty at Los Negros from May to July 1944.|$|E

5|$|The German {{raids on}} Nauru {{affected}} the Australian and New Zealand economies {{and were the}} greatest success achieved by German raiders in the Pacific Ocean during World War II. It took ten weeks to resume phosphate shipments from Nauru, {{and the loss of}} ships and damaged infrastructure led to a significant decline in output. The resulting phosphate shortages forced the introduction of fertilizer rationing in New Zealand from July 1941. Komets bombardment of the island also interfered with phosphate consignments to Japan, which caused the Japanese government to threaten to reduce the aid it <b>was</b> <b>providing</b> to Germany. The success of the attacks on Nauru led to rumours in Australia and New Zealand that the raiders had been aided by treachery in the islands. Several investigations were conducted into the rumours and proved them to be unfounded.|$|E
5|$|With Britain's {{declaration}} of war on the German Empire on 4 August 1914, the government {{took control of the}} railways under the Regulation of the Forces Act 1871. Day-to-day operations were left in the control of local management, but movements necessary for the war were coordinated by a committee of general managers. The Great North of Scotland's main role <b>was</b> <b>providing</b> a relief route when the Highland Railway route south to Perth was congested, on one Sunday conveying twenty-one troop specials from Keith to Aberdeen. Timber from the forests of the north of Scotland were carried from sidings at Kemnay, Knockando and Nethy Bridge. A total of 609 staff left to serve in the war, and a memorial to the 93 who died in action was erected at the offices in Aberdeen. Services were maintained until 1916, when staff shortages reduced services, although no lines were closed.|$|E
5|$|Late on January 1, 2009, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) {{reported}} that {{an area of}} deep atmospheric convection had persisted for the last 48hours about 730km (455mi), to the southeast of Manila in the Philippines. Deep convection was developing over the northern quadrant of a weak low level circulation center. A subtropical ridge of pressure was helping to guide the disturbance and <b>was</b> <b>providing</b> good outflow as well as low to moderate vertical wind shear. However, as the disturbance was moving into {{a higher level of}} vertical wind shear the depression was not expected to develop into a significant tropical cyclone within 48 hours. During the next 48 hours the disturbance gradually developed, with the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) and the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) reporting early on January 3 that it had become the first tropical depression of the season, with the name Auring being assigned to the depression by PAGASA whilst it was located about 140km (85mi) east of Surigao City on the Philippine island of Mindanao. This came after the low level circulation center had started to consolidate as deep convection was being fueled by a poleward diffluence despite being in an area of strong vertical wind shear. Over {{the next couple of days}} as Auring moved towards the east, dry air started to wrap in to its low level circulation center which started to weaken the depression after it had peaked with winds of 45km/h, (30mph) 10-min sustained and a peak pressure of 1006 hPa/Mbar. As the baroclinic zone approached the depression late on January 5, PAGASA downgraded the depression to an area of low pressure as the baroclinic zone was approaching the depression, as vertical wind shear had increased and outflow became hindered. However the JMA continued to issue warnings on the depression until early the next morning when the depression was declared dissipated by the JTWC and the JMA.|$|E
