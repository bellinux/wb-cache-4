5|$|This {{is a list}} of {{counties}} in <b>Wyoming.</b> There are 23 {{counties in}} the U.S. state of <b>Wyoming.</b> There were originally five counties in the <b>Wyoming</b> Territory: Laramie and Carter, established in 1867; Carbon and Albany established in 1868; and Uinta, an annexed portion of Utah and Idaho, extending from Montana (including Yellowstone Park) to the Wyoming-Utah boundary. On July 10, 1890, <b>Wyoming</b> was admitted to the Union with thirteen counties in it. Ten more counties were created after statehood.|$|E
5|$|Abrahams Creek is {{the main}} source of {{flooding}} in West <b>Wyoming,</b> Forty Fort, and Swoyersville. Sheet flooding can occur when the creek floods over Eighth Street. There is a flood protection project for the creek in West <b>Wyoming.</b> This protection is capable of withstanding 100 year floods. The Slocum Dam, which is upstream of West <b>Wyoming,</b> also helps to reduce flooding on the creek. However, localized flooding and ponding frequently affect its lower reaches. The creek has been experienced extensive modifications, such as narrowing and riprap installation, in The Hollow to accommodate West Eighth Street.|$|E
5|$|Idaho Territory {{was created}} from Dakota Territory, Nebraska Territory, and Washington Territory on March 4, 1863. Initially, the {{territory}} included all of modern-day Idaho and Montana, {{and most of}} <b>Wyoming.</b> On May 26, 1864, Montana Territory was split from Idaho Territory, {{and most of the}} <b>Wyoming</b> portion was reassigned to Dakota Territory. The portion east of the 111th meridian was split off as part of the new <b>Wyoming</b> Territory on July 25, 1868, giving Idaho Territory its final borders.|$|E

5|$|Many of {{the large}} {{ranching}} outfits in <b>Wyoming</b> were organized as the <b>Wyoming</b> Stock Growers Association (the WSGA) and gathered socially as the Cheyenne Club in Cheyenne, <b>Wyoming.</b> Comprising some of the state's wealthiest and most influential residents, the organization held {{a great deal of}} political sway in the state and region. The WSGA organized the cattle industry by scheduling roundups and cattle shipments. The WSGA also employed an agency of detectives to investigate cases of cattle theft from its members' holdings.|$|E
5|$|Shoshone National Forest {{forms the}} eastern {{boundary}} of Yellowstone National Park and the northeastern and eastern entrances {{to the park}} are both accessed by way of designated scenic roadways. A federally designated National Scenic Byways All-American Road, the Beartooth Highway (U.S. Highway 212), weaves through the forest and serves as the northeastern entranceway to Yellowstone National Park. Chief Joseph Scenic Byway (<b>Wyoming</b> Highway 296) connects Cody, <b>Wyoming</b> with the Beartooth Highway and follows the old trail in which Chief Joseph and the Nez Perce tribe attempted to flee the U.S. Cavalry in 1877. South of there, Buffalo Bill Cody Scenic Byway (US 14/16/20) heads west from Cody, <b>Wyoming,</b> passes through the forest and crosses Sylvan Pass as it enters Yellowstone. Lastly, the <b>Wyoming</b> Centennial Scenic Byway (US 26/287) heads northwest from Dubois, <b>Wyoming,</b> over Togwotee Pass and enters Jackson Hole and Grand Teton National Park. Though the Beartooth Highway {{is the only one}} of these four roads that is a National Scenic Byway, all four of them have been designated <b>Wyoming</b> State Scenic Byways by the state of <b>Wyoming.</b>|$|E

5|$|Although most Chinese {{workers in}} 1880 were {{employed}} in the coal mines around <b>Wyoming</b> and Sweetwater County, the Chinese in Rock Springs worked mostly in occupations outside of mining. In addition to Chinese laborers and miners, a professional gambler, a priest, a cook, and a barber resided in the city. In Green River, <b>Wyoming,</b> there was a Chinese doctor. Chinese servants and waiters found work in Green River and in Fort Washakie. In Atlantic City, Miner's Delight, and Red Canyon, <b>Wyoming,</b> Chinese gold miners were employed. However, {{the majority of the}} 193 Chinese residing in Sweetwater County by 1880 worked in the coal mines or on the railroad.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{formation}} of the United States Numbered Highways, the U.S. relied on an informal network of roads, organized by various competing interests, collectively called the auto trail system. The surveyors of most trails chose either South Pass in <b>Wyoming</b> or a southern route through New Mexico to traverse the Rocky Mountains. Both options were less formidable than the higher mountain passes in Colorado, but left the state without a transcontinental artery. When the planners of the Lincoln Highway also decided to cross the Rockies in <b>Wyoming,</b> officials pressed for a loop to branch from the main route in Nebraska, enter Colorado, and return to the main route in <b>Wyoming.</b> While the Lincoln Highway was briefly routed this way, the loop proved impractical and was soon removed.|$|E
5|$|Famous {{landmarks}} {{along the}} southern route included Ayres Natural Bridge and Register Cliff, {{one of a number}} of locations along the trail in <b>Wyoming</b> where settlers carved their names.|$|E

5|$|On 1 February, <b>Wyoming</b> steamed out of New York to {{join the}} annual fleet {{maneuvers}} off Cuba, before returning to New York on 14 April. On 12 May, she left port to help guide a group of Navy Curtiss NC flying boats as they made the first aerial transatlantic crossing. The battleship was back in port by 31 May. She then took on a crew of midshipmen for a training cruise off the Chesapeake Bay and Virginia Capes. After finishing the cruise, <b>Wyoming</b> entered dry dock at the Norfolk Navy Yard on 1 July for a modernization for service in the Pacific. Her secondary battery was reduced to sixteen 5-inch guns. After emerging from the shipyard, she became the flagship of BatDiv 6 of the newly designated Pacific Fleet. On 19 July, <b>Wyoming</b> {{and the rest of}} the Pacific Fleet departed the east coast, bound for the Pacific. The ships transited the Panama Canal later that month, and reached San Diego, California on 6 August.|$|E
5|$|On 14 February 1925, <b>Wyoming</b> again {{passed through}} the Panama Canal {{to return to the}} Pacific. There, she joined fleet {{exercises}} off California. She then proceeded to Hawaii, where she remained from late April to early June. She visited San Diego on 1822 June, and then returned to the east coast via the Panama Canal, arriving in New York on 17 July. A cruise to Cuba and Haiti followed, after which <b>Wyoming</b> returned to the New York Navy Yard for an overhaul that lasted from 23 November to 26 January 1926. During this period, then-Commander William F. Halsey, Jr. came aboard as the ship's executive officer; he served on <b>Wyoming</b> until 4 January 1927.|$|E
5|$|On 14 October, New York {{collided}} with a U-boat and sank it. The collision nevertheless damaged her screws, which forced Rodman to transfer his flag from New York to <b>Wyoming</b> while the former was in dock for repair. On 21 November, after the Armistice with Germany ended the war, <b>Wyoming</b> and an Allied fleet of some 370 warships met the High Seas Fleet in the North Sea and escorted it into internment in Scapa Flow. On 12 December, <b>Wyoming,</b> now the flagship of Rear Admiral William Sims, the new BatDiv 9 commander, left Britain for France. There, she rendezvoused off Brest, France with , which was carrying President Woodrow Wilson to the peace negotiations in Paris. <b>Wyoming</b> then returned to Britain two days later before departing for the US, arriving in New York on 25 December. She remained there through the new year, and on 18 January 1919, she became the flagship of BatDiv 7, flying the flag of Rear Admiral Robert Coontz.|$|E
