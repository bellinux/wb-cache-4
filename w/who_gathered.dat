5|$|Many American {{newspapers}} criticized Missouri for the Haun's Mill massacre and the state's {{expulsion of}} the Latter Day Saints. Illinois accepted Mormon refugees <b>who</b> <b>gathered</b> {{along the banks}} of the Mississippi River, where Smith purchased high-priced, swampy woodland in the hamlet of Commerce. Smith also attempted to portray the Latter Day Saints as an oppressed minority, and unsuccessfully petitioned the federal government for help in obtaining reparations. During the summer of 1839, while Latter Day Saints in Nauvoo suffered from a malaria epidemic, Smith sent Brigham Young and other apostles to missions in Europe, where they made numerous converts, many of them poor factory workers.|$|E
5|$|Nothhelm (sometimes Nothelm; died 739) was {{a medieval}} Anglo-Saxon Archbishop of Canterbury. A {{correspondent}} of both Bede and Boniface, it was Nothhelm <b>who</b> <b>gathered</b> materials from Canterbury for Bede's historical works. After his {{appointment to the}} archbishopric in 735, he attended to ecclesiastical matters, including holding church councils. Although later antiquaries felt that Nothhelm {{was the author of}} a number of works, later research has shown them to be authored by others. After his death he was considered a saint.|$|E

5|$|On February 5, 1981, 150 police raided four gay bathhouses in Toronto, Ontario: the Club Baths, the Romans II Health and Recreation Spa, the Richmond Street Health Emporium, and The Barracks. The Richmond Health Emporium was {{so badly}} damaged in the raid {{that it never}} reopened. Nicknamed Operation Soap, the raid {{resulted}} in the arrests of 268 men. There was an immediate and angry response from both {{the gay and lesbian}} community and over 3,000 people gathered in protest. A second demonstration which took place on February 20, included over 4,000 people <b>who</b> <b>gathered</b> at Queen's Park and marched to Metro Toronto Police's 52 Division.|$|E
5|$|The Skagen Painters were {{a close-knit}} group of mainly Danish artists <b>who</b> <b>gathered</b> each summer {{from the late}} 1870s in the fishing village of Skagen in the far north of Jutland, {{painting}} the local fishermen and their own family life and celebrations. Peder Severin Krøyer (1851–1909), {{who was born in}} Stavanger, Norway, but brought up in Copenhagen, first arrived in Skagen in 1882 and returned almost every summer. He had already gained a reputation for his paintings of the fishermen in Hornbæk on the north coast of Zealand and had been influenced by the Impressionist movement during his travels to France. In Skagen, {{he became one of the}} central and most enthusiastic members of the artistic community.|$|E

5|$|Apart {{from a few}} {{inscriptions}} and fragments, texts {{written by}} people who actually knew Alexander or <b>who</b> <b>gathered</b> information from men who served with Alexander were all lost. Contemporaries who wrote accounts of his life included Alexander's campaign historian Callisthenes; Alexander's generals Ptolemy and Nearchus; Aristobulus, a junior officer on the campaigns; and Onesicritus, Alexander's chief helmsman. Their works are lost, but later works based on these original sources have survived. The earliest of these is Diodorus Siculus (1st century BC), followed by Quintus Curtius Rufus (mid-to-late 1st century AD), Arrian (1st to 2nd century AD), the biographer Plutarch (1st to 2nd century AD), and finally Justin, whose work dated {{as late as the}} 4th century. Of these, Arrian is generally considered the most reliable, given that he used Ptolemy and Aristobulus as his sources, closely followed by Diodorus.|$|E
5|$|At around 6a.m., {{a passing}} {{labourer}} saw women's items near a water-filled pit. One {{of the items}} was a woman's shoe with blood on it. He raised the alarm. He and others {{were able to use}} a rake to find a body in the pit– that of Mary Ashford. Two workers from a nearby factory found a series of footprints on the newly harrowed field near the pit, showing that {{a man and a woman}} had travelled together, almost up to the pit, and that the man returned alone. Ashford was known to many of those <b>who</b> <b>gathered</b> around the pit, as was the fact that she had gone to Tyburn the previous evening. The local mill owner, who took charge, went to Tyburn to discover with whom Ashford had left the party. Daniel Clarke, the landlord, began to ride towards Castle Bromwich to try to locate Thornton, and encountered him almost at once. When Clarke told Thornton of Ashford's death, Thornton stated that he was with her until 4a.m., and at Clarke's request went with him to Tyburn.|$|E
5|$|The day of 14 August {{witnessed}} heavy {{deployment of}} security forces, which used {{tear gas and}} birdshot against hundreds-to-thousands of protesters <b>who</b> <b>gathered</b> in several locations throughout the country. Many shops were closed in response to Tamarod's call for a general strike. Opposition activists and media reported over 60 demonstrations throughout the country. The opposition and several citizens accused authorities of cutting Internet connections. The government blocked a website covering the protests, but activists and citizen journalists provided live coverage on social media websites, and Anonymous targeted a government website. At least twenty protesters were arrested and ten injured, two critically, activists said. The tightened security measures have succeeded in preventing large-scale protests in Manama. On 15 and 16 August, smaller protests occurred in several locations which police dispersed without injuries.|$|E

5|$|The format {{remained}} largely unchanged from previous series. Housemates were incarcerated in the Big Brother House with no contact {{to and from}} the outside world. Each week, the housemates took part in a compulsory task that determined the amount of money they were allocated to spend on their shopping; if they passed, they received a luxury budget and they were allocated a basic budget if they failed. Housemates were instructed to nominate two fellow housemates for eviction each week. This compulsory vote was conducted in the privacy of the Diary Room and housemates were not allowed to discuss the nomination process or influence the nominations of others. On Day 68, Big Brother changed the rules to allow housemates to discuss nominations until further notice. The two or more housemates <b>who</b> <b>gathered</b> the most nominations per week faced a public vote and the housemate receiving the most votes was evicted from the House on the Friday and interviewed by Davina McCall. Housemates could voluntarily leave the House at any time and those who broke the rules could have been ejected by Big Brother.|$|E
5|$|For Mint Chief Engraver Frank Gasparro, the {{opportunity}} to put Eisenhower on a coin was the fulfillment of a longtime dream. On June 19, 1945, Gasparro {{had been one of}} more than 4 million people <b>who</b> <b>gathered</b> in New York to watch a parade celebrating the Allied victory in Europe. Although Gasparro, then an assistant engraver at the Mint, only saw a glimpse of General Eisenhower, he stepped back from the crowd and drew the general's features. That sketch served as the basis of his design for the obverse. Gasparro consulted with the late president's widow, Mamie Eisenhower, as to the designs of both sides of the coin; the former First Lady was presented with a galvano (a metallic model used in the coin design process) by Brooks and Gasparro on January 1, 1971. Gasparro wrote in 1991 that he had six weeks to complete the work beginning in mid-November 1970, that his extensive research into eagles over the years was a great help in creating the reverse, and that his sketches were adopted without change. The chief engraver was not given full freedom of design; he was instructed to have the layout of the obverse resemble that of the Washington quarter.|$|E
5|$|Man-eaters {{have been}} a {{particular}} problem in recent decades in India and Bangladesh, especially in Kumaon, Garhwal and the Sundarbans mangrove swamps of Bengal, where some healthy tigers have hunted humans. Because of rapid habitat loss attributed to climate change, tiger attacks have increased in the Sundarbans. The Sundarbans area had 129 human deaths from tigers from 1969 to 1971. In the 10 years prior to that period, about 100 attacks {{per year in the}} Sundarbans, with a high of around 430 in some years of the 1960s. Unusually, in some years in the Sundarbans, more humans are killed by tigers than vice versa. In 1972, India's production of honey and beeswax dropped by 50% when at least 29 people <b>who</b> <b>gathered</b> these materials were devoured. In 1986 in the Sundarbans, since tigers almost always attack from the rear, masks with human faces were worn {{on the back of the}} head, on the theory that tigers usually do not attack if seen by their prey. This decreased the number of attacks only temporarily. All other means to prevent attacks, such as providing more prey or using electrified human dummies, worked less well.|$|E

5|$|The end of {{the eighteenth}} century was a time of great hope for {{progressive}} reformers such as Wollstonecraft. Like the revolutionary pamphleteer Thomas Paine and others, Wollstonecraft was not content to remain on the sidelines. She sought out intellectual debate at the home of her publisher Joseph Johnson, <b>who</b> <b>gathered</b> leading thinkers and artists for weekly dinners, and she traveled extensively, first to be a part of the French revolution and later to seek a lost treasure ship for her lover in what was then exotic Scandinavia, turning her journey into a travel book, Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark. After two complicated and heart-rending affairs with the artist Henry Fuseli and the American adventurer Gilbert Imlay (with whom she had an illegitimate daughter, Fanny Imlay), Wollstonecraft married the philosopher William Godwin, one of the forefathers of the anarchist movement. Together, they had one daughter: Mary Shelley, the author of Frankenstein. Wollstonecraft died at the age of 38 due to complications from this birth, leaving behind several unfinished manuscripts. Today, she is most often remembered for her political treatise A Vindication of the Rights of Woman and is considered a foundational feminist philosopher.|$|E

25|$|The {{disciples of}} Jesus play {{a large role}} in the search for the {{historical}} Jesus. However, the four Gospels use different words to apply to Jesus' followers. The Greek word ochloi refers to the crowds <b>who</b> <b>gathered</b> around Jesus as he preached. The word mathetes refers to the followers who remained for more teaching. The word apostolos refers to the twelve disciples, or apostles, whom Jesus chose specifically to be his close followers. With these three categories of followers, John P. Meier uses a model of concentric circles around Jesus, with an inner circle of true disciples, a larger circle of followers, and an even larger circle of those <b>who</b> <b>gathered</b> to listen to him.|$|E
