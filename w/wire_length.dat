2500|$|Republic {{addressed}} the problems by fitting a rearwards-sliding canopy {{that could be}} jettisoned in an emergency, a pressurized ignition system, and new all-metal control surfaces. The deficient maintenance access to the Double Wasp radial on the B-series subtypes {{had to wait until}} the P-47C introduced a new engine mount. While the engineers worked frantically to get their [...] "dinosaur" [...] to fly right, the USAAF ordered 171 P-47Bs. An engineering prototype P-47B was delivered in December 1941, with a production prototype following in March 1942, and the first production model provided in May. Republic continued to improve the design as P-47Bs were produced, and although all P-47Bs had the sliding canopy and the new General Electric turbosupercharger regulator for the R-2800-21 engine, features such as all-metal control surfaces were not standard at first. A modification on the P-47B, also required for the early marks of the U.S. Navy's Grumman F4F Wildcat and Grumman F6F Hellcat was the radio mast behind the cockpit that was slanted forward to maintain the originally designed antenna <b>wire</b> <b>length</b> in spite of the new sliding canopy.|$|E

Introduction Timing skew in clock distribution trees is caused both by non-uniformities in buffer propagation delay and <b>wire</b> <b>lengths.</b> Many commercial parts exist for solving the problem of non-uniform buffer delays.

50|$|Thus, {{the time}} delay through a wire {{increases}} with {{the square of}} the <b>wire's</b> <b>length.</b> This is true, to first order, for any wire whose cross-section remains constant along the <b>length</b> of the <b>wire.</b>|$|R

E.g., for the first pass, excess <b>wire</b> <b>length</b> may typically be given a high cost, while design violations such as shorts, adjacency, etc. are given a low cost. In later passes, the relative ordering of costs is changed so that violations are high-cost, or may be prohibited absolutely.|$|E

40|$|Using {{the most}} recent data on the {{connectivity}} of the C. elegans neural network, we find optimal two-dimensional positions of interneurons that minimize the total <b>wiring</b> <b>length</b> provided that the positions of motor and sensory neurons are fixed. The rationale behind fixing motor and sensory neurons is the following: while positions of motor and sensory neurons can {{be influenced by the}} locations of muscles and sensory organs they are attached to, the main function of interneurons is to connect other neurons, and their placement could try to minimize the <b>wiring</b> <b>length.</b> Solutions for l 1, l 2 and squared l 2 -norm were obtained. For the Euclidean norm l 2, the relative and absolute difference between the real and optimal total <b>wiring</b> <b>lengths</b> is minimal among these functions of distance. Additional network constraints were discussed such as assignment of different weights to electrical or chemical connections, fixation of "tail" interneurons, minimal interneural distance limitation, and others. These constraints were compared by their influence on the optimal positions of interneurons...|$|R
5000|$|In 1827, Georg Ohm {{published}} a different law, {{stating that the}} current varies directly with voltage (V) and inversely with the <b>wire's</b> <b>length,</b> not its square root; that is, [...] Ohm's law is now considered the correct law and Barlow's false.|$|R
50|$|Good city {{planning}} practice promotes alternative modes of transport, {{as opposed to}} a dependence on personal vehicles. It promotes affordable public transport. It promotes medium to high-density residential development along with complementary social amenities, convenience shopping, recreation and public services in compact, walkable mixed-use settlements. These compact communities have shorter pipe <b>lengths,</b> <b>wire</b> <b>lengths,</b> cable lengths and road lengths per capita. More people share gardens, shops and transit stops.|$|R
50|$|The problem {{commonly}} {{arises in}} physical design of electronic circuits. In modern high-density integrated circuits wire routing is performed by wires which consist of segments running horizontally in one layer {{of metal and}} vertically in another metal layer. As a result, the <b>wire</b> <b>length</b> between two points is naturally measured with rectilinear distance. Although the routing of a whole net with multiple nodes is better represented by the rectilinear Steiner tree, the RMST provides a reasonable approximation and <b>wire</b> <b>length</b> estimate.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{systems can}} then {{optimize}} the design by experimentally swapping {{the positions of}} equivalent parts and logic gates to reduce the <b>wire</b> <b>length.</b> After each movement, the associated pins in the netlist must be renamed.|$|E
5000|$|The typical digital {{propagation}} delay of a resistive wire {{is about half}} of R times C; since both R and C are proportional to <b>wire</b> <b>length,</b> the delay scales as the square of <b>wire</b> <b>length.</b> Charge spreads by diffusion in such a wire, as explained by Lord Kelvin in the mid nineteenth century. [...] Until Heaviside discovered that Maxwell's equations imply wave propagation when sufficient inductance is in the circuit, this square diffusion relationship was thought to provide a fundamental limit to the improvement of long-distance telegraph cables. That old analysis was superseded in the telegraph domain, but remains relevant for long on-chip interconnects.|$|E
50|$|To first order, the {{resistance}} of a wire on an integrated circuit is directly proportional, or linear, according to the <b>wire's</b> <b>length.</b> If a 1 mm <b>length</b> of the <b>wire</b> has 100 ohms resistance, then a 2 mm length will have 200 ohms resistance.|$|R
40|$|Many current designs {{contain a}} large number of {{standard}} cells intermixed with larger macro blocks. The range of size in these “mixed block ” designs complicates the placement process considerably; traditional methods produce results that are far from satisfactory. In this paper we extend the traditional recursive bisection standard cell placement tool Feng Shui to directly consider mixed block designs. On a set of recent benchmarks, the new version obtains placements with <b>wire</b> <b>lengths</b> substantially lower than other current tools. Compared to Feng Shui 2. 4, the placements of a Capo-based approach have 29 % higher <b>wire</b> <b>lengths,</b> while the placements of mPG are 26 % higher. Run times of our tool are also lower, and the general approach is scalable...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} layout generation for datapath cells. It specifically deals with {{the final phase of}} transistor placement for near-custom quality datapath layout. The paper describes an important improvement to our earlier approach by addressing the routability and manufacturing issues. Both of these problems are considered in the final post-processing step, which modifies the computed placement by applying a series of geometry-invariant transformations, such as component mirroring and swapping. The metrics for these transformations include <b>wiring</b> <b>length</b> minimization and the minimization of the number of wells. The new results indicate that the previously reported results of geometric placement, already within acceptable area overhead, can be further improved in terms of <b>wiring</b> <b>length</b> and the number of wells...|$|R
5000|$|RF {{feedback}}, or ‘backlash current’, {{can be an}} issue. RF feedback can {{be minimized}} by selecting a <b>wire</b> <b>length</b> that causes the low feed-point impedance at a current loop to occur at the transmitter. [...] Alternately, a remote tuner can be fed with feedline, and the tuner located on the antenna.|$|E
5000|$|Shorter interconnect: The average <b>wire</b> <b>length</b> is reduced. Common figures {{reported}} by researchers {{are on the}} order of 10-15%, but this reduction mostly applies to longer interconnect, which may affect circuit delay by a greater amount. Given that 3D wires have much higher capacitance than conventional in-die wires, circuit delay may or may not improve.|$|E
50|$|A {{three-dimensional}} {{integrated circuit}} (3D-IC) has two or more layers of active electronic components that are integrated both vertically and horizontally into a single circuit. Communication between layers uses on-die signaling, so power consumption is much lower than in equivalent separate circuits. Judicious use of short vertical wires can substantially reduce overall <b>wire</b> <b>length</b> for faster operation.|$|E
50|$|Wire wrap {{was used}} for {{assembly}} of high frequency prototypes and small production runs, including gigahertz microwave circuits and super computers. It is unique among automated prototyping techniques in that <b>wire</b> <b>lengths</b> can be exactly controlled, and twisted pairs or magnetically shielded twisted quads can be routed together.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} {{improvements}} to recursive bisection based placement. In contrast to prior work, our horizontal cut lines are {{not restricted to}} row boundaries; this avoids a “narrow region” problem. To support these new cut line positions, a dynamic programming based legalization algorithm has been developed. The combination of these has improved the stability and lowered the <b>wire</b> <b>lengths</b> produced by our Feng Shui placement tool. On benchmarks derived from industry partitioning examples, our results are close {{to those of the}} annealing based tool Dragon, while taking {{only a fraction of the}} run time. On synthetic benchmarks, our <b>wire</b> <b>lengths</b> are nearly 23 % better than those of Dragon. For both benchmark suites, our results are substantially better than those of the recursive bisection based tool Capo and the analytic placement tool Kraftwerk. 1...|$|R
40|$|The recent {{popularity}} of 3 D IC technology stems from its enhanced performance capabilities and reduced <b>wiring</b> <b>length.</b> However, {{the problem of}} thermal dissipation is magnified {{due to the nature}} of these layered technologies. In this paper, we develop techniques to reduce both the local and global congestions of 3 D circuit designs in order to alleviate thermal issues. Our approach consists of two phases. First, we use a multilevel min-cut based approach with a modified gain function in order to minimize the local congestion. Then, we perform simulated annealing to reduce the circuit’s global congestion. Experimental results show that our local congestion is reduced by an average of over 44 % and global congestion is reduced by over 16 %. Moreover, we only see an 11 % increase in the <b>wiring</b> <b>length</b> and the number of vias required. 1...|$|R
50|$|The {{anticipated}} inductance of {{the power}} line for the intended installation of the EUT also {{plays a role in}} identifying the correct type of LISN needed for testing. For example, a connection in a building will often use 50 µH inductor, whereas in automobile measurement standards a 5 µH inductor is used to emulate a shorter typical <b>wire</b> <b>length.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{communications}} cables, transposition is used {{to reduce}} coupling between circuits in the same cable. The principal measure is the pitch or lay length, the distance over which the pairs of a circuit are twisted. By twisting, the wires become longer than the cable. The stranding factor indicates the relationship of single <b>wire</b> <b>length</b> to cable length; it amounts to with communication cables about 1.02 to 1.04.|$|E
50|$|Another {{application}} domain is {{in electronic}} design automation. In standard cell design methodology, typically standard cells {{have the same}} height, and their placement is arranged {{in a number of}} rows. In this context, graph bandwidth problem models the problem of placement of a set of standard cells in a singe row with the goal of minimizing the maximal propagation delay (which is assumed to be proportional to <b>wire</b> <b>length).</b>|$|E
