50|$|As well as farming {{the village}} earned its income from {{coprolite}} digging. Coprolite is the fossilised dung of pre-historic creatures, which when ground and treated with sulphuric acid produces a superphosphate fertiliser. To extract {{it a long}} trench was dug {{on one side of}} a field. The overlaying clay was then dug out until the nodule bed was reached. If the depth of clay to be removed was more than eight to nine feet, the trench was made in two or three steps and as the nodules were taken out, so the trench was re-filled with the earth already removed. The nodule bed was shovelled into barrows and taken to the <b>washing</b> <b>mill.</b> This consisted of a circular iron trough with a pivot in the centre to which a set of travelling rakes was attached, these being dragged round by horses and a constant stream of water was kept running through the trough until the clay washed off. The dirty water then was drained off and the nodules carted away. The coprolite was worth about £3 a ton in 1890, yielding some 300 tons per acre. A good fossil digger could earn as much as £2 a week. This industry has also died out.|$|E
40|$|Because {{the waste}} {{production}} is inevitable {{in almost all}} industries, the elimination of these wastes is a requirement in terms of environmental regulations and welfare of all the creatures in the future. In this study, {{the use of the}} waste pumice stones of a denim <b>washing</b> <b>mill</b> is intended to eliminate the pollutant by a waste material and obtain economic benefits by converting it to the adsorbent. The pollutants in the effluents obtained from three different localisations of waste water treatment system of the same factory were removed through the adsorption. The experimental studies were carried out in three different steps; characterisation of adsorbent before and after adsorption; adsorption isotherm studies and biological oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD) measurements. Characterisation studies showed that the waste pumice has almost the same structural properties with unused one except the existence of some organic residues coming from washing process. The results of adsorption studies conducted at the adsorbent concentrations changing from 5 to 35 g/l revealed that the decolourisation was initial dye-concentration dependent. According to the BOD and COD measurements, the supernatants obtained at the end of adsorption could be assumed as somewhat polluted and this result indicates that the organic impurities other than indigo were also removed through the adsorption...|$|E

40|$|The work {{describes}} various {{physical and}} chemical treatments to eliminate the deleterious effects of impurities in phosphogypsum on the delayed setting time and impaired strength development behaviour of cement to which it was added as a set regulator. The physical treatments included <b>washing,</b> <b>milling,</b> and ultrasonic treatment of the material, while the chemical treatments dealt with acidic and basic additions to the phosphogypsum during the washing stage. It was found that chemical treatment with a milk of lime solution, which is often recommended in literature, was ineffective in reducing set retardation. Treatment with ammonium hydroxide or sulphuric acid was more effective in this regard. Intergrinding phosphogypsum with slaked lime improved its effectiveness in reducing set retardation, {{but the use of}} unslaked lime was less effective and also resulted in marked reductions in compressive strengths.

40|$|A {{step-wise}} {{treatment of}} Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) incinerator fly ash including <b>washing,</b> <b>milling</b> and sintering {{was investigated in}} order to manufacture ceramic materials with improved physical, mechanical and environmental properties and, possibly, to reduce the power input of the sintering process. An interpretation of the test results based on the microstructure of sintered products and sintering kinetic modeling was also attempted to identify the densification mechanisms. It was found that <b>milling</b> of <b>washed</b> fly ash represents a basic step for manufacturing high-density ceramic materials with very high compressive strengths (up to 500 N/mm(2)). A significant reduction in the power input of the sintering process (reduction of firing temperature from 1210 degrees C for washed fly ash to 1140 degrees C for milled-washed fly ash) is also achieved. A dense, well-sintered microstructure is formed through an intermediate-stage, liquid-phase sintering mechanism controlled by liquid-phase diffusion and grain shape accommodation. Such a microstructure is able to strongly immobilise heavy metals, thus giving good environmental properties to sintered product. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|This work {{aimed at}} {{analyzing}} quartz lumps rejected {{from a major}} metallurgical grade silicon producer and at studying the effect of several processing techniques over its purification. The final objective was to enable {{the use of these}} lumps as a raw material for silica glass production. Chemical analyses using ICP-MS technique were conducted {{to understand the nature of}} the chemical impurities in the rejected lumps, aiming to identify rather if the impurity was inside or outside the quartz lattice. The processing procedures were divided in two steps, the first consisting of only a physical treatment and the second one consisting of a chemical treatment. The physical treatment consisted of <b>washing,</b> <b>milling</b> (and separating the material by its particle size) and magnetic separation. This treatment reduced most of the impurities present in quartz, purifying over 90 % of the Fe contamination and over 60 % of the Al contaminations, but it was incapable of producing a powder with similar chemistry to commercial raw materials. The chemical treatment was conducted using two different acid mixtures (dilute HC 1 and dilute HC 1 + HF). Interesting results were obtained using the HF containing mixtures. These mixtures were able to produce a powder with commercial purity (with Al impurities lower than 50 ppm). This treatment was also able to reduce lattice impurities. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V.
