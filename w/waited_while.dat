5|$|The Royal Navy assumed {{control of}} her the {{following}} day and sailed her to Wilhelmshaven where she <b>waited</b> <b>while</b> the Allies decided on the disposition of the captured ships. She was allocated to Britain {{at the end of}} 1945 and arrived at Portsmouth on 7 January 1946 where she was allocated the pennant number of R38, later H40. The ship was initially used to familiarize the British on her high-pressure boilers until October when she was used as accommodation ship in Southampton. Hans Lody was arrived at Sunderland under tow on 17 July 1949 to be broken up.|$|E
5|$|For a {{year and}} a half, Polish patriots <b>waited</b> <b>while</b> {{planning}} an insurrection. On March 24, 1794 in Kraków, Tadeusz Kościuszko declared {{what has come to be}} known as the Kościuszko Uprising. On May 7, he issued the Proclamation of Połaniec (Uniwersał Połaniecki), granting freedom to the peasants and ownership of land to all who fought in the insurrection. Revolutionary tribunals administered summary justice to those deemed traitors to the Commonwealth. After initial victories at the Battle of Racławice (April 4), the capture of Warsaw (April 18) and the Wilno (April 22)the Uprising was crushed when the forces of Russia, Austria and Prussia joined in a military intervention. Historians consider the Uprising's defeat to have been a foregone conclusion in face of the superiority in numbers and resources of the three invading powers. The defeat of Kościuszko's forces led in 1795 to the third and final partition of the Commonwealth.|$|E
5|$|In January 1945 a trainload of 250 Jews who {{had been}} {{rejected}} as workers at a mine in Goleschau in Poland arrived at Brünnlitz. The boxcars were frozen shut when they arrived, and Emilie Schindler <b>waited</b> <b>while</b> an engineer from the factory opened the cars using a soldering iron. Twelve people were dead in the cars, and the remainder were too ill and feeble to work. Emilie took the survivors into the factory and cared for them in a makeshift hospital {{until the end of}} the war. Schindler continued to bribe SS officials to prevent the slaughter of his workers as the Red Army approached. On 7 May 1945 he and his workers gathered on the factory floor to listen to British Prime Minister Winston Churchill announce over the radio that Germany had surrendered, and the war in Europe was over.|$|E

25|$|The crew {{remained}} on the ice for several more weeks, and when the ice pack broke up they used Endurances three lifeboats to reach Elephant Island. Twenty-two men <b>waited</b> <b>while</b> Shackleton and five others {{took one of the}} lifeboats, the James Caird, and sailed to South Georgia to obtain rescue {{for the rest of the}} crew. Shackleton arrived at the whaling station on South Georgia Island two weeks later, but because the whaling ships were not equipped to penetrate Antarctic sea ice it took Shackleton three months before he successfully approached Elephant Island in August 1916 and rescued the rest of his crew on his third attempted rescue mission.|$|E
25|$|The Great Kantō {{earthquake}} of September 1, 1923, devastated Yokohama. Clarence Griffin {{was found}} barely breathing by shocked Scouts as they helped with rescue {{work in the}} aftermath of the destruction. Relocating to Kobe he recovered from his injuries; however, being financially ruined by the quake, he soon left Japan. At the same time, both St. Joseph College and the troop was temporarily relocated to Kobe where Scouting activities were continued without interruption under the leadership of Bro. Janning. The College and the troop <b>waited</b> <b>while</b> Yokohama was being rebuilt after the devastation. The school, and with it, the Scout Troop returned to Yokohama in 1925.|$|E
500|$|At Dundee, Lewis {{raised the}} issue and two {{solutions}} to improving the range were considered. The Mk.

IIIB, which used a second transmitter that broadcast a signal that mixed with the main one to cancel it out during the end of the pulse. He believed this would reduce the minimum range to only [...] Two copies of the IIIA entered tests in May 1940 and demonstrated little improvement, with the range reduced to only , but at the cost of significantly reduced maximum range of only [...] Tests of the IIIB <b>waited</b> <b>while</b> the AI team moved from St Athan to Worth Matravers in May, and were eventually overtaken by events. Development of both models was cancelled in June 1940.|$|E
30|$|A filler is {{an object}} or action used {{to fill a}} wait time. Gilliland et al. (1946) explain that {{customers}} fill their wait times with mental and physical activities that divert attention from the wait itself.

500|$|Ray Winstone plays George [...] "Mac" [...] McHale, a British agent whom Jones worked {{alongside}} in World War II, but has now {{allied with}} the Soviets to resolve financial problems. The character acts as a spin on Sallah and René Belloq – Jones's friend and nemesis, respectively, in Raiders of the Lost Ark. Spielberg cast Winstone as he found him [...] "one of the most brilliant actors around", having seen Sexy Beast. Winstone tore his hamstring during filming. [...] "I keep getting these action parts as I’m getting older", he remarked. Like John Hurt, Winstone wished to see the script prior to committing to the film. In interviews on British TV Winstone {{explained that he was}} only able to read the script if it was delivered by courier, who <b>waited</b> <b>while</b> he read the script, and returned to the U.S. with the script once Winstone had read it. His reasoning for wanting to read the script was, [...] "If I'm gonna be in it, I want to be in it." [...] He gave suggestions to Spielberg, including the idea of Mac pretending to be a double agent. He also stated that once filming was completed he had to return the script, such was the secrecy about the film. He was later presented with a copy of the script to keep.|$|E
2500|$|Luxembourg <b>waited</b> <b>while</b> Namur was {{put into}} a state of defence before decamping on 8 July, {{following}} William III towards Nivelles. News arrived at Versailles that William was planning the recapture of Namur as soon as the Allied commander could assemble his army. Louis wrote to Luxembourg, urging him to [...] " [...] … march with speed … and fight him before he can establish his trenches [...] … [...] " [...] On 1 August William moved to Halle. William, like Louis, also sought battle, and on 3 August he surprised and attacked Luxembourg near the village of Steenkerque. The issue was not completely decisive – both sides could claim a victory of sorts – but William left the field in French hands, thus ending the Allied threat to Namur. Little of note happened in the remainder of the campaign before they went into winter quarters.|$|E
2500|$|Wang's {{sighting}} {{was the key}} to {{the discovery}} of Mallory's body 24 years later in the same general area, though Wang's reported description of the body he found, face up, with a [...] "hole in cheek", is not consistent with the condition and posture of Mallory's body, which was face down, its head almost completely buried in scree, and with a golf-ball-sized puncture wound on his forehead. The 2001 research expedition discovered Wang's campsite location and made an extensive search of its surroundings. Mallory's remained the only ancient body in the vicinity. Some argue it must have been Mallory, not Irvine, that Wang had found in 1975, despite the variations in body posture. Zhang said that Wang had only been gone about 20 minutes but he had <b>waited</b> <b>while</b> dozing in his sleeping bag, so Wang's stroll could have been of longer duration. Conrad Anker now believes Wang did indeed find Irvine and not Mallory.|$|E

2500|$|One {{afternoon}} of November, 1868, in the Park at Hawarden, I {{was standing by}} Mr. Gladstone holding his coat on my arm while he, in his shirt sleeves, was wielding an axe to cut down a tree. Up came a telegraph messenger. He took the telegram, opened it and read it, then handed it to me, speaking only two words, namely, 'Very significant', and at once resumed his work. The message merely stated that General Grey would arrive that evening from Windsor. [...] This, of course, implied that a mandate {{was coming from the}} Queen charging Mr. Gladstone with the formation of his first Government. [...] I said nothing, but <b>waited</b> <b>while</b> the well-directed blows resounded in regular cadence. [...] After a few minutes the blows ceased and Mr. Gladstone, resting on the handle of his axe, looked up, and with deep earnestness in his voice, and great intensity in his face, exclaimed: My mission is to pacify Ireland. He then resumed his task, and never said another word till the tree was down.|$|E
