5|$|Absolutely. There's a {{song called}} 'Army of Me,' <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> a 'Fighter 2.0.' There is a new {{generation}} of fans from a younger demographic that might not have been with me all the way but that watch me on the show now. I feel like every generation should be able to enjoy and have their piece of 'Fighter' within. This time, the way it musically came together it just felt right for this time and this generation. There's {{always going to be a}} fighter in me getting through some obstacle and some hurdle. All these 6-year-olds who know me from pushing my button and turning around in a big red chair who weren't around for the actual 'Fighter,' this is my chance to recharge it, rejuvenate it and do something modernized for them.|$|E

500|$|The episode's main villain, the human-bat hybrid, was {{inspired}} by the 1970s comic book villain, Man-Bat, one of the arch-nemeses of Batman. During the filming of the episode, live bats were used; the type of bat used in [...] "Patience" [...] was the Egyptian Fruit Bat. Furthermore, the episode was the first to test Doggett's skepticism of paranormal activity. As Robert Patrick explained, [...] " [...] is where it starts to toy with my willingness to believe in the paranormal and strange happenings. You've got a guy that's a bat, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> out of the norm." ...|$|E

500|$|Captain America's shield, {{which serves}} as both a {{defensive}} tool and a weapon, came in four types: metal, fiberglass, rubber, and computer graphics (CG). Prop master Barry Gibbs specified that [...] "We had the 'hero shield,' which was made of aluminum, for our beauty shots [...] close-up work. We then created a lighter shield that was aluminum-faced with a fiberglass back, for use on a daily basis.... And then we had a stunt shield made of polyurethane, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> a synthetic rubber... and we made an ultrasoft one we put on [...] back, so {{that if there were}} an accident, it wouldn't hurt him." [...] Visual effects supervisor Christopher Townsend said Evans [...] "would practice swinging the practical shield so he knew the arc and the speed at which he should move. We would take the shield from him and shoot the scene with him miming it. Then we would add in a CG shield".|$|E
500|$|Writer and supervising {{producer}} Brad Kern {{reflected on}} the show's cancellation, saying, [...] "Ten years later, everybody you talk to... they all love the show. I {{think that was the}} biggest disappointment about the show not coming back. We knew we were doing something special." [...] Told of the show's success in the TV Guide [...] "Save Our Shows" [...] poll, Sandy Grushow said, [...] "Obviously I'm happy and not entirely surprised", but added, [...] "You can't dismiss a season's worth of ratings." [...] Kim Manners, director on {{nearly a third of the}} Brisco episodes, said working on the series gave him an opportunity to grow creatively. He told writer Joe Nazzaro, [...] "It really woke me up as a director, almost spiritually", and that directing for Brisco was a large contributing factor to his success as a regular director on The X-Files. Manners said, [...] "When they didn't give it a second year, I was devastated", adding that he wished Cuse would have made a feature film based on Brisco. Considering the show's short life, Cuse later commented, [...] "If the show could have survived into a second season, I think it could have ended up running for actually a long time. Some shows just sort of fall through the cracks in the right away and they kind of stay on the air long enough to aggregate an audience. I think if circumstances had been different, Brisco could have had a much longer life." [...] Cuse also said the Friday night time slot hurt Briscos chances of building an audience, saying, [...] "We were on at 8 p.m. on Friday night, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> a death slot– I mean people do still go bowling– few shows have succeeded in that slot." ...|$|E
2500|$|Filling part of {{the void}} left by Minor Threat's hiatus, The Faith quickly {{became one of the}} most popular bands in D.C., and {{naturally}} signed with Ian MacKaye's Dischord label. After recording a demo in December 1981, the band released a split LP with fellow D.C. hardcore band, Void. It was released by Dischord Records, a local independent label founded by MacKaye's elder brother Ian MacKaye and Jeff Nelson of Minor Threat. The first pressing of the record sold out in two weeks. It featured the song [...] "You're X'd," [...] which addressed the straight edge philosophy popularized by Minor Threat and S.O.A. And at the same time it was a strong critic to the people that did not take the straight edge movement seriously and only pretended to follow it in order to sympathise with other people. The Faith members stated that they felt rather frustrated and angry because [...] "people tend to compare the two sides of the record <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> dumb, we would have reviewed it as two separate bands—not comparing—instead of saying 'Oh, Void is so crazy and The Faith is just boring typical hardcore.'" [...] "Our approaches to music were so different that there isn’t much point in comparing the two sides…they are never close enough to compare, only to contrast and to complement." ...|$|E

When the GNP-based aerogels are devoted to electrical applications (e.g., electrodes for batteries and supercapacitors, electrolysis cells, etc.), such type of chemical cross-linking results are extremely convenient.|$|R
50|$|The {{title of}} the short story {{comes from the fact that}} all {{redundancy}} - and vowels - had been removed from our language in order for the information volume to shrink. Finally the sum of all human knowledge (<b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> finite) <b>was</b> compressed by means of subatomic processes and stored away in a drawer-sized box.

[...] Film critic Mark Kermode has opined that it is [...] "deeply, deeply problematic at the very best of times" [...] and is not as interesting as earlier exploitation films such as The Last House on the Left.

5000|$|Allen {{talked to}} cinematographer Gordon Willis about how fun {{it would be}} to shoot the film in black and white, Panavision aspect ratio (2.35:1) because it would give [...] "a great look at New York City, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> one of the {{characters}} in the film".

50|$|A popular {{project of}} Soulseek Records is the Massacre, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> like a musical game of telephone.

After the release of The One Minute Massacre Volume 1, the label created 3 more Volumes, {{all in the same}} fashion. It was a popular concept, especially being that it was a free-for-all project in which many musicians could participate. Spinoffs of the original idea include the 24 Hour Massacre (same concept, except the entire album is created in a timespan of 24 hours, resulting in an intense time-based challenge) and the One Second Massacre (same concept, except each artist creates one second and passes it on. As of January 2006, this project has reached nearly 10 minutes of material.) Several other releases not associated with Soulseek Records have picked up on similar ideas.|$|E
