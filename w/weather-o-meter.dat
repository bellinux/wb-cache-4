40|$|More {{than one}} million road signs are {{installed}} over thousands of kilometers of highways in India. It {{is a matter of}} great concern that there is no strategy to assess their deterioration in terms of quality of retro reflective sheets under natural outdoor weathering and artificial accelerated weathering. The work reported in this paper is focused on how fast the deterioration of reflective sheets of different colors is occurring under natural weathering conditions in India. The deterioration is simulated with artificial weathering under Xenon-Arc chamber with known parameters of weather prevailing in India. This study will help in evaluating the performance of retro-reflective sheets in hours in <b>weather-o-meter</b> to same level of deterioration in the field in terms of days. Data for co-efficient of retro-reflectivity was collected for White, Yellow, Red, Orange, Green, and Blue Type III reflective sheets over a period of seven years in natural weather conditions of Delhi. The best-fit curves technique was adopted to predict the life of retro reflective sheets of different colors in terms of days/months to reach its minimum allowable level. The higher values of R 2 for all colors indicate that there is a strong relationship between deterioration and age of reflective sheets in terms exposure in months/days, similarly the R 2 values were also found high when the exposure was made in <b>weather-o-meter</b> for few hours. It means that weather conditions in <b>weather-o-meter</b> are exactly being stimulated with prevailing weather conditions in Delhi. The study concludes that over a period of seven years the deterioration of blue color sheet is maximum and deterioration of green color sheet is minimum. This conclusion is also evident from physical parameters such as appearance of signs installed in India. The signs with blue base normally need early replacement in comparison to the signs made out of green sheet for National Highways. The parameters, which were set in <b>weather-o-meter,</b> need the exposure of different hours for different colors of sheets for achieving minimum allowable level of reflectivity as per ASTM standard. The tentative results indicate that reduction of retro reflectivity after 124 months outdoors could be achieved in 90 hours exposure in <b>weather-o-meter.</b> The deterioration varies from color to color and the exposure hours are different for different colours of sheets. This is due to difference in the properties of the pigments used in reflective sheets...|$|E
30|$|Wood blocks {{measuring}} 140 (longitudinal)[*]×[*] 25 (radial)[*]×[*] 9 (tangential) mm {{were cut}} from the sapwood of air-dried sugi (Cryptomeria japonica D. Don). The radial surface of each block was smoothed with a wood planer and then exposed to artificial sunlight from a xenon arc light source (0.51  W/m 2 at 340  nm) in a <b>weather-o-meter</b> (Ci 4000, Atlas, USA) with a black panel temperature of 65  °C and chamber temperature of 38  °C. After a 500 -h exposure (no rain), 15 -µm-thick cross sections used for Raman measurement (Fig.  1) were prepared on a sliding microtome.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT：In this study, self-actuated {{photocatalyst}} that {{titanium dioxide}} doped {{by more than}} two transition metal was coated PU foam. The antibacterial and antifungal activity of self-actuated photocatalyst coated PU foam was characterized without light. The antibacterial property of self-actuated photocatalyst coated PU foam was shown to be reduced more than 96 %, and the antifungal property was shown to be reduced more than 99. 9 %. The durability of self-actuated photocatalyst coated PU foam tested by <b>Weather-O-meter</b> showed the 7 % reduction of formaldehyde decomposition from 96. 5 % before test to 89. 8 % after test. The observation of surface of PU foam coated with self-actuated photocatalyst showed that th...|$|E
30|$|Fading {{of museum}} {{textiles}} {{has been investigated}} using different laboratory fading simulations {{and the results were}} analyzed using different instrumental techniques such as spectrocolorimetric measurements, chromatography, or mass spectrometry. Crews (1987) examined the fading rates of wool dyed with some of the natural dyes by artificially fading the samples with a <b>weather-O-meter.</b> Whitmore and Cass (1988) and Ye et al. (2000) investigated the fading of silk samples dyed with traditional Japanese or Chinese dyes by exposing the samples in ozone. Grosjean et al. (1987) examined the ozone fading of alizarin and Grosjean et al. (1988) of indigo deposited on Teflon membrane, the degradation product was analyzed using the mass spectrometry analysis. Colombini et al. (2007) examined the degradation of flavonoid yellow dyes such as weld, fustic, and dyer’s broom using GC-MS and the degradation pathway was proposed.|$|E
40|$|Various uncompounded ethylene–propylene–diene (EPDM) {{elastomers}} were photo-oxidized using standard <b>Weather-O-Meter</b> (WOM) {{aging and}} oxygen absorption measurements during UV irradiation. The {{influence of the}} type and amount of diene on the UV stability was investigated. FTIR (ATR) measurements of the carbonyl absorbance after WOM aging were comparable with {{the outcome of the}} oxygen absorption tests. Both techniques showed a decrease in UV stability with increasing diene content. In addition, EPDM containing 5 -ethylidene- 2 -norbornene (ENB) as the third monomer showed a higher UV stability compared to EPDM containing dicyclopentadiene (DCPD) as the third monomer. Furthermore, a linear relation was found between the carbonyl absorbance after WOM aging and the third monomer content for DCPD- and ENB-containing EPDM samples with comparable ethylene/propylene (C 2 /C 3) ratio. The microhardness (International Rubber Hardness Degree) and the Young's modulus of the various EPDMs as function of the WOM irradiation time showed a maximum. This maximum is the result of parallel photo-crosslinking and chain-scission reactions, the latter being dominant in the later stages of the oxidation process. Combining the results from the FTIR measurements with the Young's modulus showed that DCPD-containing EPDM has a higher propensity to crosslinking reactions compared to ENB-containing EPDM...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{significant}} progress having been achieved {{in recent years}} to improve wood’s durability, additional developments are still necessary to increase its color stability. ZnO and CeO 2 nanoparticles were compared to UV absorbers (Tinuvin 477 DW, 292 and 5151) commonly used to stabilize the wood products color. Nanoparticles, with concentrations in the range 1 to 2 wt%, and UV absorbers, using concentrations advised by the manufacturer, were dispersed in a waterborne UV curable polyurethane/polyacrylate resin. Dispersions were carried out with a high speed mixer at 2, 500 RPM with micro glass beads or not, depending on the form of the nanoparticles. Nanocomposite coatings were aged with a <b>weather-o-meter</b> (CI 3000 + - Atlas) according ASTM G 155. Color variations were measured with a colorimeter (BYK Gardner – Color Guide 45 / 0) working with the CIE L*a*b* system. The aim {{of the present study was}} to assess the effects of inorganic UV absorbers on the stabilization of color under indoor conditions. Results showed that nanoparticles (ZnO, CeO 2) absorbed UV light frequencies in a manner similar to common organic molecules. Their efficiency was better at medium durations of light exposure, for which they could achieve the action of organic absorbers. Finally, the simultaneous use of both absorbers seems to create a protective synergy when degradation is due to UV energy alone...|$|E
