40|$|The {{adhesion}} of wet fibers {{is usually}} {{explained by the}} presence of capillary forces, which keep the swollen fibers together. These bonds are due to the free water present outside the wall of the swollen fibers. However, what happens when the free water is being removed and the tensile <b>strength</b> of the <b>wet</b> web continues to increase is not well understood. Tensile strength's measurements of refined fibers in presence of polyelectrolytes and mineral particles suggest that no enhancement of bonding occurs between the fibers when the free water is gone. The addition of microfibrils tends to enhance the <b>wet</b> web <b>strength.</b> This indicates strongly that fiber entanglement due to mechanical interactions may be the major interaction responsible for keeping the swollen fibers together in the transient region where neither capillary forces nor hydrogen bonding dominate. The interactions between fibers, precipitated calcium carbonated (PCC) and retention aids, revealed that the <b>wet</b> web <b>strength</b> of PCC-filled handsheets is detrimental in the presence of flocculated PCC particles, while no detrimental effect is observed in the presence of stable PCC particles. Friction generated by the deposition of small and/or single particles on the fiber surface can explain their enhancement of strength, whereas bigger particles may prevent the entanglement of fibers. Finally, the addition of polyelectrolytes to swollen fibers reduces the <b>wet</b> web <b>strength.</b> The presence of an additional polymer layer results in an increased electrosteric repulsion between fibers, which decreases the friction between fibers. This reduction of friction makes the fibers slide more easily over each other, resulting in poor <b>wet</b> web <b>strength...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Recent {{studies suggest}} that the {{tendency}} of many fault gouge minerals to take on adsorbed or interlayer water may strongly influence their frictional strength. To test this hypothesis, triaxial sliding experiments were conducted on 15 different single-mineral gouges with various water-adsorbing affinities. Vacuum dried samples were sheared at 100 MPa, then saturated with water and sheared farther to compare dry and <b>wet</b> <b>strengths.</b> The coefficients of friction, µ, for the dry sheet-structure minerals (0. 2 - 0. 8), were related to mineral bond strength, and dropped 20 - 60 % with the addition of water. For non-adsorbing minerals (µ = 0. 6 - 0. 8), the strength remained unchanged after saturation. These results confirm that the ability of minerals to adsorb various amounts of water is related to their relative frictional strengths, and may explain the anomalously low strength of certain natural fault gouges...|$|R

40|$|Soy-based {{adhesives}} {{have attracted}} much attention recently because they are environmentally safe, low cost, and readily available. To improve the gluability and water resistance of soy-based adhesives, we prepared an enzyme-treated soy-based adhesive modified with an epoxy resin. We investigated the <b>wet</b> shear <b>strength</b> of plywood bonded with the modified adhesive using the boiling-water test. Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance analysis were used to characterize the reaction between epoxy groups and –NH 2 groups in the modified soy-based adhesives. FTIR analysis confirmed the cross-linking structure in the cured adhesives. Viscosity and the solid content of soy-based adhesives gradually increased with the increasing amount of epoxy resin, but {{had little effect on}} its operability. <b>Wet</b> shear <b>strength</b> of plywood samples increased as the amount of epoxy resin was increased, whereas the inverse trend was observed regarding the water absorption of cured adhesives. Compared to an unmodified adhesive, the addition of 30 % of epoxy resin increased the <b>wet</b> shear <b>strength</b> of plywood samples by 58. 3 % (0. 95 MPa), meeting the requirement of the Chinese National Standard for exterior plywood. Differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetric analysis showed the improved thermostability of the cured adhesives after curing at 160 °C. These results suggest that epoxy resin could effectively improve the performance of enzyme-treated soy-based adhesives, which might provide a new option for the preparation of soy-based adhesives with high gluability and water resistance...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis was to identify the effects of different factors on the tension and tension relaxation of wet paper web after high-speed straining. The study was motivated by the plausible connection between wet web mechanical properties and wet web runnability on paper machines shown by previous studies. The mechanical properties of wet paper were examined using a fast tensile test rig with a strain rate of 1000 %/s. Most of the tests were carried out with laboratory handsheets, but samples from a pilot paper machine were also used. The tension relaxation of paper was evaluated as the tension remaining after 0. 475 s of relaxation (residual tension). The tensile and relaxation properties of wet webs {{were found to be}} strongly dependent on the quality and amount of fines. With low fines content, the tensile strength and residual tension of wet paper was mainly determined by the mechanical interactions between fibres at their contact points. As the fines strengthen the mechanical interaction in the network, the fibre properties also become important. Fibre deformations caused by the mechanical treatment of pulp were shown to reduce the mechanical properties of both dry and wet paper. However, the effect was significantly higher for wet paper. An increase of filler content from 10 % to 25 % greatly reduced the tensile strength of dry paper, but did not significantly impair <b>wet</b> web tensile <b>strength</b> or residual tension. Increased filler content in wet web was shown to increase the dryness of the wet web after the press section, which partly compensates for the reduction of fibrous material in the web. It is also presumable that fillers increase entanglement friction between fibres, which is beneficial for <b>wet</b> web <b>strength.</b> Different contaminants present in white water during sheet formation resulted in lowered surface tension and increased dryness after wet pressing. The addition of different contaminants reduced the tensile strength of the dry paper. The reduction of dry paper tensile strength could not be explained by the reduced surface tension, but rather on the tendency of different contaminants to interfere with the inter-fibre bonding. Additionally, <b>wet</b> web <b>strength</b> was not affected by the changes in the surface tension of white water or possible changes in the hydrophilicity of fibres caused by the addition of different contaminants. The spraying of different polymers on wet paper before wet pressing had a significant effect on both dry and <b>wet</b> web tensile <b>strength,</b> whereas <b>wet</b> web elastic modulus and residual tension were basically not affected. We suggest that the increase of dry and <b>wet</b> paper <b>strength</b> could be affected by the molecular level interactions between these chemicals and fibres. The most significant increases in dry and <b>wet</b> paper <b>strength</b> were achieved with a dual application of anionic and cationic polymers. Furthermore, selectively adding papermaking chemicals to different fibre fractions (as opposed to adding chemicals to the whole pulp) improved the wet web mechanical properties and the drainage of the pulp suspension...|$|R

Paper sheet experiments {{were performed to}} evaluate the influence of different polymers at macroscopic level {{on the development of}} bonding and strength in paper. The main objectives of the work were: 1) to further the understanding on the development of tensile properties of paper from a wet sheet to a dry paper and on the mechanisms of action of different strength additives 2) to resolve the specific interactions of certain polymers with cellulose and 3) to relate the molecular and microscopic level phenomena to the development of bonding and strength in paper. Adsorption of polymers was highly dependent on the {{interactions between}} cellulose and the polymers {{as well as on the}} adsorption conditions. The dispersing or aggregating effects of polymers on cellulose fibrils were observed at molecular and microscopic levels in model systems and on the surfaces of cellulose fibres. The adsorption of polymers also affected hydration and viscoelastic properties of the fibril/polymer layer. Polymer adsorption, when carefully considered, can provide an easy control over stabilization, compatibilization, and water affinity of fibrillar cellulosic materials. The development of tensile properties of paper upon drying was characteristic for each polymer and adsorption condition. The increased dispersion and plasticization of cellulose fibrils on fibre surfaces by carboxymethyl cellulose and xyloglucan influenced the development of fibre bonding and paper strength during drying. In addition, the development of drying tension showed differences between polymers, thus it could be possible to utilize additive-specific drying conditions to attain the desired end properties of a paper product.
