[...] May later stated to a USAF {{accident investigation board}} that his [...] "Tally 2" [...] call meant that he saw two helicopters but {{did not mean that}} he was confirming Wickson's identification of them as Hinds. Neither F-15 pilot had been informed that U.S. Army Black Hawks participating in OPC often carried auxiliary fuel tanks mounted on wings nor had either been instructed in the paint scheme that Iraqi Hind helicopters used, light brown and desert tan, which was different from the dark green color used by the Black Hawks. Wickson later stated that, [...] "I had no doubt <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> him that he was a Hind[...] [...] [...] The Black Hawk did not even cross my mind." ...|$|E
500|$|According to the singer, she {{had written}} several songs prior {{to the release of}} Truth Serum. She confessed that both the writing and {{recording}} process of the EP was very emotional, and that the vocals of the songs were taken from her demos. Truth Serum is a concept record that details Lo's [...] "most intense" [...] relationship from beginning to end. That approach was unintentional, as Lo realized that the tracks talked about the relationship after she had picked them for the EP. She explained; [...] "I didn't plan to write it that way, but <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the songs that I had when I was picking ones for the EP, I was like, 'Oh my god, here it is'. I didn't really figure out {{that it was going to}} be the full story right there until I looked and listened". Concerning the title of the EP, the singer decided to call it Truth Serum after she had picked the songs for it; she said in an interview that [...] "when you look at the songs, it's all about honesty and I'm really giving up a lot of myself in these songs; I'm not filtering anything. I felt that kind of speaks a lot for how truthful the EP is".|$|E
2500|$|Many of {{the songs}} on the album were written by A.C. Newman and Destroyer {{frontman}} Dan Bejar. Newman recalled that he thought [...] "'How could we lose?' You could just take some interesting elements and put them together. Even taking myself out of the picture, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the band I just thought, 'This band's got to be great.' I thought, 'Okay, everyone can hate my songs, they can dismiss them.' But I have the most confidence in Dan's songs because I'm totally outside of him, looking in. I'm just a fan of him." ...|$|E

2500|$|Uncharted 2 also {{received}} praise from other developers. [...] producer Gordon Van Dyke stated [...] "Uncharted 2 is an amazing-looking game. But we're reaching {{that level of}} quality. It's {{going to be hard}} for any game to be able to make a claim that they look better... to even be close, to me is quite an honour as a developer. The one thing I did was, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> their game I was like, damn them! What have they done to the rest of us? I was looking for something where I could say, okay, that we're doing better." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ellison {{graduated}} in 1981 from the University of Detroit Jesuit High School and Academy, {{where he was}} active in sports and a senator in the student government. At the age of 19, while attending Wayne State University in Detroit, Ellison converted from Catholicism to Islam, later giving the following explanation: [...] "I can't claim that I was the most observant Catholic at the time [...] I had begun to really look around and ask myself about the social circumstances of the country, issues of justice, issues of change. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> my spiritual life, and I looked at what might inform social change, justice in society... I found Islam." ...|$|E
2500|$|His {{colleague}} Alfréd Rényi said, [...] "a mathematician is {{a machine}} for turning coffee into theorems", and Erdős drank copious quantities (this quotation is often attributed incorrectly to Erdős, but Erdős himself ascribed it to Rényi). After 1971 {{he also took}} amphetamines, despite the concern of his friends, one of whom (Ron Graham) bet him $500 {{that he could not}} stop taking the drug for a month. Erdős won the bet, but complained that during his abstinence, mathematics had been set back by a month: [...] "Before, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> a piece of blank paper my mind was filled with ideas. Now all I see is a blank piece of paper." [...] After he won the bet, he promptly resumed his amphetamine use.|$|E
