There are three basic styles of wedge anchors: fully threaded, partial threaded and the full-bodied <b>wedge</b> <b>anchor.</b> As shown in the figure, tightening the bolt results in a wedge being driven up against a sleeve. This jams the end of the bolt, and provides the strength. Many different manufacturers provide a variation on this theme, usually depending on the condition of the concrete, and the type of load. If a mechanical anchor fails, it is usually in the form of pulling out a wedge of concrete, and for this reason, proper design looks at the depth of embedment and ensures that the bolts are not spaced too closely.|$|E
40|$|This {{engineering}} note documents {{design calculations}} {{done for the}} bayonet feed can platform installed at the far west end of the assembly hall. The platform is mounted off of a cast concrete wall directly south of where the shielding block wall is stacked. A summary of the loading, reaction forces and stresses is shown on the page 3. As can be seen, the calculated stresses are very small, maximum value = 2540 psi. The material used is structural steel tubing, ASTM A 500 Gr. B, with a minimum yield strength of 46 ksi and minimum ultimate tensile strength of 58 ksi. The reaction forces for the upper two members will be carried together by a 1 / 2 -inch mounting plate. The mounting plate {{is attached to the}} wall by four 1 / 2 -inch Hilti wedge anchors. The allowables for each <b>wedge</b> <b>anchor</b> are 2400 lbs. tensile, 1960 lbs. shear. The major reaction load for the top members is a combined 3627 lbs. tensile load which can easily be handled by the four bolt pattern. Some small moment reactions not listed on the summary page add negligible (400 lbs.) force couples to the axial loading. The bottom members are also attached to a mounting plate that is bolted to the wall. See page 15 for Hilti <b>wedge</b> <b>anchor</b> data...|$|E
40|$|Even though {{limited to}} the outer {{concrete}} layer of structures, pull-out tests have been {{proved to be a}} reliable technique for the in situ estimation of concrete strength. The most studied post-installed <b>wedge</b> <b>anchor,</b> the CAPO test, is not widely used due to the complexity of its use. A simplified procedure, resembling the CAPO test, the Zykon technology, has been used in Italy for more than 20 years with substantially unsatisfactory results, mainly for tensile stress states and for high stress gradients. In both the cases, the calibrations curve, relating the pull-out load to concrete strength, is related to unstressed concrete, which is troublesome when applied to in-service structures, i. e. with not vanishing stress states. A new post-installed <b>wedge</b> <b>anchor</b> is discussed in this paper that, based on a careful choice of all the technical details, has been proved to be reliable for all stress states since: i) the drilling and expansion procedure avoids much of the uncertainties that affect the commonly used procedure; ii) the calibration of the procedure has been performed on up to 6 classes of concrete and considering 5 different stress distributions (medium and low compression, vanishing stress states, inhomogeneous compressive stresses and inhomogeneous tensile stresses). The correlation curves are nonlinear, as for pre-installed inserts, and depend on the stress state, with statistical scattering never exceeding 7 - 8 % of the average values. A theoretical analysis fits rather well the test data and provides explanation to several aspects of pull-out tests...|$|E
40|$|Tightening {{screws and}} <b>wedge</b> <b>anchors</b> {{to the correct}} torque is {{important}} for various construction tasks. This thesis presents an effort to select the right torque by means of computer vision. The suggested method makes use of a Hough transform for circles to detect such an object. Selection {{of one of the}} circles found by the Hough transform is done with help of a self simi-larity measure based on the object’s invariance to rotation. The result of detection is used to classify <b>wedge</b> <b>anchors</b> of two different groups. These can be distinguished by cross-like markings engraved in the anchors of one class. Classification is based on the Hough transform for lines, which was extended to detect orthogonal, crossing lines. A short evaluation on still im-ages demonstrates that the approach works. The overall rate of classification achieved with this method is 0. 61, which is too low for real-world application. Additional suggestions for improving the concept conclude this thesis...|$|R

50|$|Erection {{drawings}} {{are used}} to guide the steel erector on the construction site ("in the field") as to where and how to erect the fabricated steel members. These drawings usually show dimensioned plans to locate the steel members, and they often also show details with specific information and requirements, including all work that must {{be done in the}} field (such as bolting, welding or installing <b>wedge</b> <b>anchors).</b> Since the erection drawings are intended for use in the field, they contain very little specific information about the fabrication of any individual steel member; members should already be completed by the time the erection drawings are used.|$|R
40|$|A {{new type}} of postinstalled <b>wedge</b> <b>anchor</b> (B 15 G) is presented. A refined {{geometry}} of the anchor bolt and a careful choice of all the technical details allow the insert to work also in tensile stress states and to avoid much of the practical uncertainties that affect the commonly used procedures. The calibration of the procedure has been performed on 3 classes of concrete and for 5 stress distributions (medium and low compression, vanishing stress states, inhomogeneous compressive stresses, and inhomogeneous tensile stresses). It {{has been found that}} the correlation curves, pull-out force versus compressive strength, are not linear and depend on the stress state; besides, the statistical scattering of the calibration tests never exceeds 7 - 8 % of the average values...|$|E
40|$|The {{scope of}} the paper {{is to provide a}} {{short-term}} evaluation of some commercially available FRP tendon-anchor systems for application in prestressed concrete structures. Ten FRP tendon-anchor systems were stressed and subjected to sustained load for a period of three days to determine ease of installation, mechanical performance and anchor seating losses. The FRP tendons used aramid, carbon, and glass fibres embedded in epoxy or vinyl ester resin (except for one case). Anchors were of the wedge (or spike) and potted type. A minimum of two tests were conducted for each system at a load level equal to 65 % of the manufacturer's specified ultimate tendon strength. Collected data included load, strain, and displacement readings during both initial stressing and three-day sustained load. In most cases, anchorage devices permitted the stressing of the FRP tendons at the desired load level. Among wedge-type anchors, plastic and aluminium wedges had questionable performance, whereas steel wedges (in direct contact with the tendon or using a metal sleeve between tendon and wedge) showed good performance. Regardless of wedge material (plastic, aluminium, or steel), grit application to the wedge internal surface was highly beneficial. The spike anchor presented some installation difficulties. Resin potted anchors worked well and were easy to install. For the one case considered (<b>wedge</b> <b>anchor),</b> it was determined that retensioning produces early failure and anchor-zone temperatures between - 40 degrees C and + 60 degrees C have no effect on system performance. Anchor seating losses during short-term use are in general small and could become insignificant depending on the length of the tendon. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd...|$|E
25|$|In most cassettes, the {{magnetic}} tape {{is attached to}} each spool with a leader, usually made of strong plastic. This leader protected the weaker magnetic tape from the shock occurring when the tape reached the end. Leaders can be complex: a plastic slide-in <b>wedge</b> <b>anchors</b> a short fully opaque plastic tape to the take-up hub; one or more tinted semi-opaque plastic segments follow; the clear leader (a tintless semi-opaque plastic segment) follows, which wraps almost {{all the way around}} the supply reel, before splicing to {{the magnetic}} tape itself. The clear leader spreads the shock load to a long stretch of tape instead of to the microscopic splice. Various patents have been issued detailing leader construction and associated tape player mechanisms to detect leaders. Cassette tape users would also use spare leaders to repair broken tapes.|$|R
40|$|The {{tensioning}} of carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) rods for {{prestressed concrete}} applications or posttensioning repair and strengthening has been met with mixed success. This is {{primarily because of}} limitations inherent {{in the use of}} traditional <b>wedge</b> <b>anchors</b> typically used for steel tendons. Recently, an integrated sleeve-wedge anchorage has been successfully developed specifically for CFRP rods. This paper presents a numerical simulation of the newly developed anchorage by using ABAQUS. The three-dimensional (3 D) finite-element (FE) model, which considers material nonlinearity, uses hexagonal elements for the barrel, CFRP rod, and tetrahedral elements for the integrated sleeve wedge. The simulated barrel surface strains are shown to compare well with optically measured strains; however, the numerical results are shown {{to be sensitive to the}} mechanical properties of the anchorage and CFRP rod and especially the transverse elastic modulus of the CFRP rod. Finally, the simulated strain distributions throughout the anchorage as well as the distribution of CFRP rod confining pressure are presented. Such strain and pressure distributions enable insights into the inner workings of the anchorage to be achieved. © 2011 American Society of Civil Engineers. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

50|$|When peace returned, Camden grew rapidly. The Megunticook River {{provided}} excellent {{water power}} sites for mills. In addition to sawmills and gristmills, by 1858 {{the town had}} carriage factories, sash and blind factories and blacksmith shops. There were six shipyards, launching ten to twelve vessels annually. By 1886, the town also made foundry products, railroad cars, woolens and paper mill feltings, <b>anchors,</b> <b>wedges,</b> plugs and treenails, planking, powder kegs, excelsior, mattresses, powder, tinware, oakum, wool rools, boots and shoes, leather, flour and meal, corn brooms and barrels. Camden was second only to nearby Rockland in the lucrative manufacture of lime, excavated at quarries and processed in kilns before being shipped to various ports around the United States until 1891, when Rockport was set off as a separate town. As the 19th century came to an end, Camden {{was very much a}} shipbuilding town with the H.M. Bean Yard launching the largest four-masted schooner Charlotte A. Maxwell and the first six-master ever built-the George W. Wells.|$|R
40|$|Erosion and {{sedimentation}} is a prevalent water-quality {{issue in}} many Piedmont streams in Georgia (Landers and others, 2002). Typically, concentrations of suspended sediment {{are determined by}} collecting water samples and making physical measurements of sediment mass per unit volume in a laboratory setting. Particle-size distributions of individual samples also are typically per-formed in a laboratory. The U. S. Geological Survey is con-ducting an ongoing research project in Rockdale County, Georgia, and is using state-of-the-art instrumentation {{in an attempt to}} develop surrogate in situ, real-time measure-ments of particle-size and suspended-sediment concentra-tions in streamwater. The ultimate goal is to use in situ, real-time particle-size- and suspended-sediment concentra-tion measurements for computing continuous sediment loads. Instrumentation installed in the Yellow River near Mil-stead, Georgia, includes the Sequoia LISST™- 100 (Laser In-Situ Scattering and Transmissiometery) size distribution sensor (Fig. 1) and the SonTek® Argonaut-Shallow Water (SW) velocity meter 1 (Fig. 2). The LISST™- 100 is designed to report real-time in situ measurements of particle-size distribution (Gartner and others, 2001). The Argonaut-SW is a bottom-mounted, acoustic Doppler meter that is designed to report water velocity utilizing two vertically oriented beams and water-surface elevation using a third beam. The instrumented site is characterized by gradually-sloping, nonvegetated granite bedrock that controls flow of the river from baseflow to flood conditions. The grad-ual slope of the granite bedrock presented design and in-stallation obstacles to locating the instruments at the proper depth and outside of an area of recirculating back-flow. Site installation was designed to protect the instru-mentation from potentially-damaging flow-transported de-bris, premature wear, and vandalism, and to allow removal of the sensor for periodic maintenance during low to high baseflow conditions (Wagner and others, 2000). To meet these requirements, a polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe “de-ployment” tube was assembled and attached with steel <b>wedge</b> <b>anchors</b> bolted into the granite bedrock. ________ Figure 1. Sequoia LISST™- 100 before deployment at study site. The deployment tube was raised approximately 10 cen-timeters off the streambed to ensure that the LISST™- 100 would only measure entrained particles in the primary flow and not be skewed by larger sediments transported within the variable flow zone resulting from the bedrock channel. The LISST™- 100 sensing tip was exposed ap-proximately 10 centimeters beyond the end of the de-ployment tube such that the sensor would not be fouled by the collection of fine sediment within the interior of the deployment tube. To prevent excessive strain on the LISST™- 100 data cable, a light-gauge wire tether was connected to the instrument casing and anchored to the bedrock streambed. The degree of exposure of the sensor from the deployment tube end could be adjusted by chang-ing the length of the wire tether. The Argonaut-SW was designed to use Doppler tech-nology to measure stream velocity. The instrument func-tions by measuring the Doppler shift in reflected acoustic energy from entrained sediment particles within the water column. In order to use the Argonaut-SW to produce a surrogate for sediment concentrations, data compiled from the reflectivity function within the velocity computation are compared to actual sediment concentrations (Gray and others, 2003) measured from traditionally collected sam-ples. In theory, a larger measured reflectance will corre-spond to a greater sediment concentration. Sponsored by: Georgia Environmental Protection Division U. S.

40|$|In {{the process}} of {{developing}} a new <b>wedge</b> anchorage to <b>anchor</b> prestressed CFRP rods, five different anchorage designs were manufactured. These designs have led to a constantly increased ultimate failure load of the prestressing system and an eventual load level above 95 % of the ultimate failure load of the rod was achieved. If 100 % efficiency is achieved the anchorage does not reduce the capacity of the system, but failure is then governed by the capacity of the rod itself, which is considered favourable and required by several guidelines. In the process seven different failure modes were identified: soft slip, power slip, cutting of fibres, crushing of rod, bending of fibres, frontal overload and intermediate rupture. In this paper the failure modes are discussed further. The failures are documented with explanatory figures and their backgrounds are found in the theory. Suggestions are given on how these failures can be avoided in theory and practice. From the experiences gained in the project, it is concluded that it is a challenging task to create a fully mechanical anchorage for CFRP tendons and that the failure margins are small between a successful and an unsuccesful anchorage system.

40|$|What is {{the proper}} {{material}} and procedure for filling single-strand tendon stressing pockets? As {{the first line of}} defense for the corrosion protection of the stressing anchorage, a quality stressing pocket patch is essential for the long-term durability of the post-tensioning system. A premixed cementitious non-shrink grout described in the following and applied correctly to a well-prepared surface is required for filling single-strand tendon stressing pockets. A product best suited as a patch material is a high-quality premixed cementitious chloride-free non-shrink grout, mixed with limited amount of water per manufacturers’ recommendation for use as repair material. These repair grouts are designed specifically for filling concrete voids in vertical and overhead applications and are suitable for filling single-strand stressing pockets. All major cementitious material suppliers have prepackaged non-shrink grouts. The key to a quality stressing pocket patch is the use of the right patch material, the recommended surface preparation, and the proper mixing and application. These repair grouts must be mixed, applied, and cured per the manufacturer’s recommendations. Stressing pockets should be free from all PT coating, grease, form release agents, dirt, loose concrete, debris, or any deleterious material. Although it is accepted practice to place a small amount of PT coating or grease on the tip of the pocket former that is inserted into the <b>anchor</b> <b>wedge</b> cavity (particularly with standard nonencapsulated anchorages), any portion of the pocket former that comes into contact with the surrounding concrete should be free from all PT coating, grease, and form release. The inside surface of the pocket former recess should be cleaned with a wire brush or similar to ensure the proper bond of the patch material; a bonding agent may be applied. The recess must be immediately protected with filling material. An inspection of the surface preparation and filling of the anchorage pockets is highly desirable...|$|R
