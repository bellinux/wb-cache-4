5|$|Her musical {{influences}} {{were better}} expressed on Sol-Angel and the Hadley St. Dreams, when she considered herself mature {{and was able}} to write and produce songs as she wished, <b>without</b> <b>worrying</b> <b>about</b> the expectations of others. Knowles's lyrics tackle relationships, world issues, and deceased friends, with her second album focusing on events in her life, such as marriage, divorce, and parenthood. The album touched upon a variety of genres including pop-soul, psychedelic soul, electronica, and R.|$|E
5|$|Once in Vanilla Studios, {{the group}} began {{performing}} cover songs {{from a variety}} of genres, such as rockabilly, rock and roll, rhythm and blues, and reggae. In contrast to previous rehearsal sessions, the band kept these rehearsals private, and did not allow hangers-on to attend. This seclusion allowed the band to rebuild their confidence <b>without</b> <b>worrying</b> <b>about</b> the reaction from outsiders, who were familiar with the band's punk rock musical style.|$|E
5|$|As a child, Dalton felt {{jealous of}} boys {{for the freedom}} they enjoyed. They could travel alone <b>without</b> <b>worrying</b> <b>about</b> their {{reputation}} and were often bribed to attend school, while girls were, in her opinion, educated reluctantly. One of her teachers {{thought it would be}} wasteful for her to study algebra, as she already had sufficient education for a housewife. As a young woman, she felt that women lived on a higher moral level than men. She saw polygamy as a way to allow more women to marry the few good men, arguing that it gave more women the opportunity to marry. She also considered it ironic that prostitution was tolerated but polygamy was considered depraved.|$|E
25|$|The algebra of throws is {{commonly}} {{seen as a}} feature of cross-ratios since students ordinarily rely upon numbers <b>without</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> their basis. However, cross-ratio calculations use metric features of geometry, features not admitted by purists. For instance, in 1961 Coxeter wrote Introduction to Geometry without mention of cross-ratio.|$|R

Nunzio plans on becoming a priest as well, as the easy life of a priest <b>without</b> <b>worries</b> <b>about</b> the future appeals to him.|$|R
50|$|Brockworth was {{the third}} {{in a series of}} rural villages located along an old Roman road {{following}} a more-or-less straight line to the inland port city of Gloucester. Its original semi-remote location made it ideal for the location of an aircraft factory (now the Gloucester Business Park) where aeroplanes could be built and tested <b>without</b> <b>worries</b> <b>about</b> noise. Land availability also made the area ideal for a flight test airfield.|$|R
5|$|Alan Brigman was the {{technical}} director and co-producer. He and Mike Woodroffe developed a game creation system, Adventure Graphic Operating System (AGOS) II, which facilitated {{the development of}} Simon the Sorcerer and enabled the team {{to focus on the}} gameplay and story <b>without</b> <b>worrying</b> <b>about</b> {{the technical}} aspects. The system allowed the developers to input text commands on a separate monitor, and the engine could be ported to other platforms. Other features of the engine included translating actions performed by the mouse into text commands (a sentence parser carries them out), the loading of data as-needed, and functions could be implemented by the simple addition of commands. The game was built as a database, which contained tables for rooms and objects. These tables contained animation code and information about what is supposed to happen. Alan Cox was also involved {{in the development of the}} AGOS engine, which is based on AberMUD.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{religious}} references in the series, Nakamura stated she used only her personal knowledge and {{some aspects of}} modern society, such as yakuza and blogging, which were {{not intended to be}} critical but were added because they fit the story. Similarly, secondary characters were only introduced in the series if a chapter needed a new character to introduce a topic. The themes of the chapters were created before the situations and jokes. However, if Nakamura had a specific theme, she created several jokes and then connected them to form a story. When creating a simpler chapter as compared to the more elaborate, thematic ones, she wrote <b>without</b> <b>worrying</b> <b>about</b> creating jokes and situations in advance. With the help of her four assistants, on average she took between ten days and two weeks to make a complete chapter.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{was known}} for {{fostering}} {{the development of new}} writers <b>without</b> <b>worrying</b> <b>about</b> maximizing profits, and for printing works on principle, even if he knew they would make little money. His risky publication of Joel Barlow's Advice to the Privileged Orders (1792), for example, sold 600 copies and barely broke even. He was also instrumental {{in the creation of the}} female professional writer, a role that began opening to women only at the end of the 18th century in Britain. By nurturing the writings of Anna Laetitia Barbauld, Charlotte Smith, Mary Hays, Mary Wollstonecraft, and Maria Edgeworth, he gave women the opportunity to demonstrate that they could be both successful and significant authors. Additionally, he published works promoting women's equality, such as Hays's An Appeal to the Men of Great Britain (1798), which called for an end to the tyrannical rule of men over women; Johnson's Analytical Review reviewed the work extensively and approvingly.|$|E
50|$|Health Department {{regulations}} prevent {{human service}} agencies from allowing pets in homeless shelters. Unfortunately this prohibition can prevent {{people in need}} of services, who also happen to own pets, from receiving needed temporary shelter. In response to this need, the SPCA provided dog houses and material to construct dog runs to Shelter Outreach Plus so their homeless clients can comfortably utilize their services <b>without</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> their pets.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A {{reversible}} watermarking {{scheme for}} relational databases is proposed {{in this paper}} to achieve lossless and exact authentication of relational databases via expansion on data error histogram. This reversible watermarking scheme possesses the ability of perfect restoration of the original attribute data from the untampered watermarked relational databases, thus guaranteeing a “clear and exact ” tampered-or-not authentication <b>without</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> causing any permanent distortion to the database. In this scenario, only the secret key owner possesses the capability to exactly restore the database’s original state. Simulations demonstrate the scheme’s security and feasibility for low-correlated data in typical databases...|$|R
5|$|In January 1942 it {{was decided}} that the limit of {{long-range}} aircraft endurance should be the crew’s limits, (due to extreme aircrew fatigue seriously effecting efficiency) not the fuel supply of the aircraft. De la Ferté decided, on 7 January, sorties should not exceed 14 hours, which reduced flying hours by four per mission. This was despite the entry of the very long-range Liberators in June 1941. The Liberator Mk I had a stated Air Ministry range of 2,720 miles, but crew endurance methods now meant it would be airborne for just 2,240. De la Ferté wrote to the Ministry arguing the Liberator should be used for reconnaissance work, rather than bomb load for the solitary squadron being accepted at that time. The Liberator would assist in closing the 'Mid-Atlantic Gap' which U-boats could operate in <b>without</b> <b>worrying</b> <b>about</b> air interdiction. After replacing Bowhill in 1941, de la Ferté had issued a directive on 12 June 1941 to use Wellingtons and Whitleys as an interim solution to unrestricted submarine warfare now practised by the Germans. Their uneconomical operational cost meant immediate replacement of these medium-range machines was pressing. Some Avro Lancasters and Halifaxes, with some difficulty, were seconded from Bomber Command.|$|E

25|$|Stamp {{collecting}} is {{a popular}} hobby. Collecting {{is not the same}} as philately, which is defined as the study of stamps. It is not necessary to closely study stamps in order to enjoy collecting them. Many casual collectors enjoy accumulating stamps <b>without</b> <b>worrying</b> <b>about</b> the details. The creation of a valuable or comprehensive collection, however, may require some philatelic knowledge.|$|E

40|$|The {{theory of}} {{exchange}} rate regimes {{does not provide}} clear cut preference as to which regimes should be preferred. Fixed and floating exchange rate regimes {{each has its own}} advantages and disadvantages. Under fixed exchange rates, the country’s export and service sector are stable because the businessmen need not <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> the fluctuation of the currency, and thereby influencing the amount of profit made. Moreover, <b>without</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> the fluctuation {{of the value of the}} currency, businessmen can make beautiful enterprise to do business. The implication is that it creates muchneeded jobs and revenue for the country. In this paper we will prove theoretically that in short, fixed exchange rates can provide greater insulation of output in the face of nominal shocks. At the same time, floating exchange rates are better at absorbing real shocks...|$|R

25|$|Males of {{some species}} {{are able to}} {{immobilize}} females and force copulation. In pigs and boars, males grab females and maneuver the pelvis to lift the vaginal opening and facilitate copulation. The stimulation following intromission causes the female to be immobilized.

25|$|Stamp {{collecting}} {{is generally}} accepted {{as one of}} the areas that make up the wider subject of philately, which is the study of stamps. A philatelist may, but does not have to, collect stamps. It is not uncommon for the term philatelist to be used to mean a stamp collector. Many casual stamp collectors accumulate stamps for sheer enjoyment and relaxation <b>without</b> <b>worrying</b> <b>about</b> the tiny details. The creation of a large or comprehensive collection, however, generally requires some philatelic knowledge and will usually contain areas of philatelic studies.|$|E

5000|$|Early AAN results led to {{opposition}} from senior leaders, who regarded their comments as reality checks. Some senior officers suggested that using technologies from 20 {{years in the}} future was the equivalent of introducing supersonic aircraft into a 1920 wargame, not completely unreasonable given the exponential rate of technology improvement. The 20 year target, and the associated [...] "History of the Future" [...] document, was intended to allow examination of concepts <b>without</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> budget, but the interaction between leadership and gamers educated all in what was realistic. This lesson might be quite important for intelligence personnel doing longer-term estimates. As a result, the AAN wargame has been restructured to forecast a 10- to 15-year future and, in 2000, the name of the series was changed to the Transformation wargame.|$|R

25|$|Designer Anne Cole, {{described}} as a godmother of swimwear in the USA, was originator of this style. She scored what would be her biggest hit in 1998 when her label introduced the tankini. A two-piece suit with a top half that covered more of a woman's torso than a standard bikini top, the suit was an instant hit with customers. Variations of the tankini, made of spandex-and-cotton or Lycra-and-nylon, have been named camkini, with spaghetti straps instead of tank-shaped straps over a bikini bottom, and even bandeaukini, with a bandeau worn as the top. Tankinis {{come in a variety}} of styles, colors and shapes, some include features such as integrated push-up bras. It is particularly popular as children's beachwear, and athletic outfit good enough for a triathlon.

25|$|The {{revelations of}} several {{problems}} with skin gambling during June and July 2016 highlighted {{the nature of}} gambling as a significant problem for eSports. Todd Harris of Hi-Rez Studios, a developer of several eSports games, believed that these events signaled {{the end of an}} era where eSports went mostly unregulated, requiring publishers and tournament operators to exert tighter control on their games to reduce gambling problems. Psyonix, the developers of Rocket League, announced plans to bring a similar loot-drop and trading system to their game as with CS:GO, but purposely opted not to use the Steamworks API to manage player inventory, seeking to avoid a similar situation with gambling that happened with CS:GO. Brendan Greene, the lead for PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, believed that by mid-2017, Valve had put enough safeguards in place to use the Steam marketplace to manage the trading and selling of cosmetic items for Battlegrounds <b>without</b> <b>worrying</b> <b>about</b> skin gambling.|$|E
25|$|The couple faced another hurdle when Brenda {{wanted to}} publish {{an article about}} the alarm of her {{pregnancy}} but Dylan objected, arguing that it was very personal. Typical of their relationship, Brenda and Dylan were once again reconciled after another dispute. In addition, Brenda was the victim of an armed robbery at the Peach Pit.

Things get more serious when Brenda {{spends a lot of time}} with Dylan <b>without</b> <b>worrying</b> <b>about</b> the limitations imposed by her parents. The latter invited her to a trip to Mexico and Brenda agrees, despite the formal prohibition of her father. The trip will be punctuated by a dispute and a passage at the customs where Brenda will realize that she does not have her passport and is therefore forced to phone her parents. When Brenda's parents are aware of her trip to Mexico with Dylan, the girl's father formally banned her from seeing him again. But she refuses to break and hides her relationship with Dylan.|$|E
500|$|In December 2002, {{publisher}} Activision signed Stainless Steel to a multi-game contract, {{the first}} title {{of which was}} revealed to be Empires in February 2003.
