40|$|The <b>wavelengths</b> {{of several}} <b>constant</b> hues over four illuminants (D 95, D 65, D 50, A) {{are derived from}} several sets of {{published}} data. In the plane of wavelength and reciprocal illuminant color temperature (MK 21), the <b>wavelengths</b> of <b>constant</b> hues plot straight approximately parallel lines whose mean slope is about 878. Parallel lines give invariant <b>wavelength</b> ratios, hence <b>constant</b> hues in this plane are near-invariant wavelength ratios across illuminants. As recently demonstrated, the complementary <b>wavelengths</b> to a <b>constant</b> hue (across illuminants) represent the complementary constant hue; these complementary wavelengths also plot a near-parallel line to the first constant hue. To confirm and further define the constant slope of these lines, it is shown that complementary wavelength pairs, per CIE data, can only plot parallel straight lines at the angle of 878 6 1. In summary, near-parallel sloping lines represent constant hues at near-invariant wavelength ratios. This mechanism of color constancy is shown {{to relate to the}} well-known theory of relational color constancy from invariant cone-excitation ratios. In the visual process, the latter ratios are presumably the source of the former (invariant wavelength ratios). 12 page(s...|$|R

40|$|In known interferometers, mode-jump-free tunable {{semiconductor}} lasers {{are used}} increasingly. However, {{they have the}} disadvantage that the resonance wavelength heavily depends on the operating parameters. The task of the present invention is therefore to implement an interferometric measuring process and a laser interferometer arrangement suitable for its implementation in order to effectively avoid this dependence - compared {{with the state of}} the art - even if the operating conditions change drastically. The task of the invention is solved by at least two control interferometers (2, 3) graduated in cascades in relation to each other with relation to the control section (28, 37), and that, if a suitable signal threshold (46 a, 47 b, 46 b, 47 a) is exceeded or undershot, switchover takes place to the next successive control interferometer with the shorter or longer control section.

Though the detection of object sound signal and sound direction in the multiple sound field is the fundamental acoustic measurement, the high-performance measuring method has not been devel-oped yet. This paper proposed the multi-microphone sys-tem using Genetic algorithm for estimating the multiple sound direction. Though several estimation methods of the sound direction have been reported until now, the estimable angle number is limited to at most 3 angles. This system is composed of three-dimensionally spaced microphone array and FIR filter based on <b>wavelength</b> <b>constant</b> matrix that is linked for it. The wavelength con-stant matrix is formulated in order to accurately give the relationship between microphone output and individual sound wave at the origin. Under the condition of know-ing the sound direction, this system can detect the indi-vidual sound wave in the multiple sound field. Detection error {{in this case is}} dependent on the accuracy of the sound direction. This fact indicates that the sound direc-tion can be estimated, if the detection error is made to be correspondent to the fitness in Genetic algorithm. The computer simulation based on this idea showed that pro-posed method was fundamentally valid for the detection of sound direction up to the 6 angles of 3 sound sources until now. 1...|$|E
