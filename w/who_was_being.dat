5|$|Boniface {{clashed with}} Henry's half-brothers, the Lusignans, {{who arrived in}} England in 1247 and competed for lands and {{promotions}} with the queens' Savoy relatives. Boniface's quarrel with Aymer de Valence over a hospital in Southwark led to the archbishop's palace at Lambeth being plundered and one of Boniface's functionaries being kidnapped. The dispute with Aymer was only settled in early 1253. Boniface was once more absent from England from October 1254 to November 1256, {{and spent most of}} that time in Savoy where he attempted to help his brothers rescue their eldest brother Thomas <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>being</b> held captive at Turin.|$|E
5|$|On the November 28 {{episode of}} Raw, Maria interviewed then-Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff, {{and asked him}} {{whether or not he}} {{thought he was going to}} be fired. He then booked her in a match with Kurt Angle out of spite, and Maria was laid out with the Angle Slam. As a result, one week later, Maria testified in the trial against Bischoff, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>being</b> fired because of his {{controversial}} actions as General Manager.|$|E
5|$|The TNA X Division Championship was {{defended by}} then-champion Petey Williams against Kaz {{in the opening}} contest of the telecast. Williams was {{accompanied}} by Rhaka Khan and Scott Steiner. The duration of the bout was 15 minutes and 19 seconds. Williams wore a protective face mask due to a broken orbital bone. Khan and Steiner interfered in the bout several times. Kaz was legitimately busted open during the match after Williams bashed {{him in the face}} with a steel pipe. Williams won the encounter after performing his signature Canadian Destroyer maneuver by slamming Kaz head-first into the mat to retain the TNA X Division Championship. Abyss returned after this match by aiding Kaz <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>being</b> attacked by Khan, Steiner, and Williams.|$|E

5|$|The U.S. Constitution's Fifth Amendment {{gives an}} {{individual}} suspected of crime a {{right not to}} be forced, by police or other government officials, into giving up evidence that would show {{he or she was}} guilty of a crime. Based on this constitutional prohibition against self-incrimination and to prevent coerced testimony by police or other government officials, the Supreme Court ruled in Miranda v. Arizona that an individual <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>being</b> held by police and was not free to leave had to be told of his/her right to remain silent. After Berghuis, a subsequent case, Salinas v. Texas, considered a suspect who was not being held against his will by police officers, but who had instead agreed to accompany officers and discuss a case upon their request. It extended Berghuis by ruling that in such a situation and prior to any arrest, the individual was not required to be explicitly told about his/her right to remain silent under the Fifth Amendment.|$|E
5|$|The prisoners found A and B wings {{unsupervised}} as {{the prison}} officers had already evacuated, {{and began to}} free other prisoners who were still locked in their cells. The prison officer {{in charge of the}} first landing of C wing was ordered to evacuate, {{and with the help of}} three other officers evacuated the 73 Rule 43(a) prisoners being held there, being fearful for the safety of the prisoners who were regarded as sex offenders. Due to rioting prisoners entering the wing, the officers were unable to evacuate a further seven Rule 43(a) prisoners who were being held on the second landing. Rioting prisoners also gained access to E wing, where the Rule 43(a) prisoners had been left locked in their cells after the prison officers evacuated. A number of these Rule 43(a) prisoners were attacked by rioting prisoners. One such prisoner was Derek White, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>being</b> held on remand on charges of indecent assault and buggery. White later died in North Manchester General Hospital on 3 April after being admitted suffering from head wounds, a dislocated shoulder and chest pains.|$|E
5|$|The two princes {{had been}} in dispute over who should marry Irene Dushmani, the only {{daughter}} of Lekë Dushmani, prince of Zadrima. In 1445, the Albanian princes {{had been in}}vited to the wedding of Skanderbeg's younger sister, Mamica, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>being</b> married to Muzaka Thopia. Irene entered the wedding and hostilities began. Dukagjini asked Irene to marry him, but Zaharia, who was drunk, saw this, and assaulted Dukagjini. Some princes attempted to stop the fight, but only more people became involved. Several people died or got injured before peace was established. Neither of the two antagonists had suffered any physical damage, but after the event Dukagjini was morally humiliated.|$|E

5|$|Through 1866, Greeley editorialized that Davis, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>being</b> held at Fortress Monroe, should {{either be}} set free or put on trial. Davis's wife Varina urged Greeley to use his {{influence}} to gain her husband's release. In May 1867, a Richmond judge set bail for the former Confederate president at $100,000. Greeley {{was among those who}} signed the bail bond, and the two men met briefly at the courthouse. This act resulted in public anger against Greeley in the North. Sales of the second volume of his history (published in 1866) declined sharply. Subscriptions to the Tribune (especially the Weekly Tribune) also dropped off, though they recovered during the 1868 election.|$|E
5|$|When Richard I, King Henry's son, became king in 1189, Coutances absolved Richard for his {{rebellion}} against {{his father and}} invested him as Duke of Normandy. He then accompanied Richard to Sicily as the king began the Third Crusade, but events in England prompted Richard to send the archbishop back to England to mediate between William Longchamp, the justiciar whom Richard had left {{in charge of the}} kingdom, and Prince John, Richard's younger brother. Coutances succeeded in securing a peace between Longchamp and John, but further actions by Longchamp led to the justiciar's expulsion from England, replaced in his role by Coutances, even though he never formally used the title. He remained in the office until late 1193, when he was summoned to Germany by the king, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>being</b> held in captivity there. Coutances became a hostage for the final payment of Richard's ransom on the king's release in February 1194.|$|E
5|$|Bird {{elected to}} {{not to make}} a pit stop and {{maintained}} the lead at the lap-21 restart, ahead of Félix da Costa. Piquet chose to make his pit stop immediately after racing resumed. Bird pulled away from Félix da Costa <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>being</b> held up by the delayed Vergne. He chose to remain on the circuit with a strategy to conserve his car's electrical energy usage which was being followed by both Jaguar drivers. Bird made his pit stop {{at the end of the}} 25th lap and it appeared that he would rejoin the race in the lead but technical problems with his second car caused him to search for different reset proceducres, lose one minute and 27 seconds and rejoin the circuit one lap down in 15th position. An electrical issue was discovered on Evans' second car during his pit stop and his team elected to retire him on the same lap to prevent further damage. Frijns led the field for one lap before making his pit stop on the 26th lap. Buemi took over the first position from Frijns with di Grassi in second place and Heidfeld third. Di Grassi closed to within less than two seconds behind Buemi with ten laps of the race left with the latter reacting by extending his advantage to 2.5 seconds. Rosenqvist set the race's fastest lap on lap 36, competing a circuit of one minute and 2.947 seconds, which earned him one championship point.|$|E

5|$|While Cranmer was {{following}} Charles through Italy, {{he received a}} royal letter dated 1 October 1532 informing {{him that he had}} been appointed the new Archbishop of Canterbury, following the death of archbishop William Warham. Cranmer was ordered to return to England. The appointment had been secured by the family of Anne Boleyn, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>being</b> courted by Henry. When Cranmer's promotion became known in London, it caused great surprise as Cranmer had previously held only minor positions in the Church. Cranmer left Mantua on 19 November and arrived in England at the beginning of January. Henry personally financed the papal bulls necessary for Cranmer's promotion to Canterbury. The bulls were easily acquired because the papal nuncio was under orders from Rome to please the English in an effort to prevent a final breach. The bulls arrived around 26 March 1533 and Cranmer was consecrated as archbishop on 30 March in St Stephen's Chapel. Even while they were waiting for the bulls, Cranmer continued to work on the annulment proceedings, which required greater urgency after Anne announced her pregnancy. Henry and Anne were secretly married on 24 or 25 January 1533 {{in the presence of a}} handful of witnesses. Cranmer did not learn of the marriage until a fortnight later.|$|E
5|$|Sebastian Vettel's {{dominant}} run was derailed in Abu Dhabi {{when his}} car {{was found to have}} insufficient fuel after qualifying and he was subsequently moved {{to the back of the}} grid. As Lewis Hamilton led the race away from the start, Vettel started from pit lane and took advantage of a chaotic opening corner that saw Nico Hülkenberg, Paul di Resta, Romain Grosjean and Bruno Senna tangle; Hülkenberg was forced out, while di Resta and Grosjean pitted with damage. Vettel began to round up the HRTs, Marussias and Caterhams, but his early progress came at the expense of his front wing endplate when he made contact with Senna at Turn 8 switchback. He chose not to pit for the time being, as the race was interrupted by the intervention of the safety car. Nico Rosberg, who had been forced to pit with damage to his front wing, was in the process of overtaking Narain Karthikeyan as Karthikeyan's car began to fail and the Indian quickly slowed. Rosberg, caught unawares by Karthikeyan's troubles, was launched over the back of the HRT and into the barrier. During the safety car period, Vettel was forced to pit when he swerved to avoid Daniel Ricciardo and crashed into the polystyrene bollard marking the start of the DRS zone, further damaging his wing. Red Bull Racing took the opportunity to pit him early, with the downside being that Vettel would have to do 42 laps on the soft tyre when supplier Pirelli predicted they could only do 36. Meanwhile, Hamilton suffered another mechanical failure while leading the race, and was once again forced out, handing the lead to Kimi Räikkönen while Fernando Alonso inherited second. Vettel began to work his way through the field again, but was forced to make a second stop when his tyres started losing grip. He was saved by the second appearance of the safety car moments later, brought about when di Resta forced Sergio Pérez wide; as Pérez rejoined the circuit, he cut back across the front of Grosjean and the two made contact, which in turn forced Grosjean into the path of Mark Webber. Grosjean and Webber retired, whilst Pérez was given a stop-go penalty. When racing resumed, Räikkönen began to rebuild his lead over Alonso, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>being</b> harried by Jenson Button; Button himself was being harried by Vettel in fourth. Button and Vettel's duel allowed Alonso to break free, and he started chasing down Räikkönen in the last five laps. Räikkönen held on to secure his – and Lotus F1's – first victory of the season. Alonso was second, while Vettel caught and passed Button to complete the podium, keeping a ten-point championship lead in the process. With both Alonso and Vettel finishing on the podium with him, Räikkönen's win was not enough to keep him in contention for the World Drivers' Championship, leaving the title to be fought out between Alonso and Vettel over the final two races of the season.|$|E
