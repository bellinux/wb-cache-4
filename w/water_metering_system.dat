40|$|To design water {{distribution}} network infrastructure, water utilities formulate daily demand profiles and peaking factors. However, {{traditional methods of}} developing such profiles and peaking factors, necessary to carry out {{water distribution}} network modelling, are often founded {{on a number of}} assumptions on how top-down bulk water consumption is attributed to customer connections and outdated demand information that does not reflect present consumption trends; meaning infrastructure is often unnecessarily overdesigned. The recent advent of high resolution smart <b>water</b> <b>meters</b> allows for a new novel methodology for using the continuous 'big data' generated by these meter fleets to create evidence-based water demand curves suitable for use in network models. To demonstrate the application of the developed method, high resolution water consumption data from households fitted with smart <b>water</b> <b>meters</b> were collected from the South East Queensland and Hervey Bay regions in Australia. Average day (AD), peak day (PD) and mean day maximum month (MDMM) demand curves, often used in water supply network modelling, were developed from the herein created methodology using both individual end-use level and hourly demand patterns from the smart meters. The resulting modelled water demand patterns for AD, PD and MDMM had morning and evening peaks occurring earlier and lower main peaks (AD: 12 %; PD: 20 %; MDMM: 33 %) than the currently used demand profiles of the regions' water utility.

40|$|Driven by the {{information}} age, {{a paradigm shift}} is starting {{to occur in the}} urban water planning and management field, mainly due to the introduction of advanced metering and communications technologies. This chapter explores the potential role of intelligent water metering systems, and the smart application of resultant data sets for the future of water planning and management in the built environment. Intelligent water meters essentially perform three functions; they automatically and electronically capture, collect and communicate up-to-date water usage readings on a real-time (or nearly real-time) basis. To translate this data into useful information, a comprehensive intelligent <b>water</b> <b>metering</b> <b>system</b> is required, which integrates high-resolution metering (e. g., 0. 01 ?l; 5 ?sec), communication technologies (e. g., GPRS) and information management systems, in order to provide real-time information on how, when and where water is being consumed for the customer and water business. This chapter seeks to promote the uptake and application of intelligent water metering systems by examining the benefits and drivers of, and barriers to, intelligent metering. Specifically, it presents applicable examples of where intelligent metering systems can significantly enhance current activities in terms of citywide urban planning, infrastructure planning, water demand management and customer satisfaction.

40|$|This study aims {{to reduce}} Non-revenue water (NRW) in the {{municipality}} of Keetmanshoop, Namibia. The main objectives of this thesis are {{to implement the}} water loss management plan in Keetmanshoop, and research the impacts of prepaid <b>water</b> <b>meters</b> on <b>water</b> tariffs and unpaid water bills in other municipalities in Namibia. NRW consists mostly of leaks in the water distribution system, overflows from <b>water</b> reservoirs, <b>metering</b> errors, <b>water</b> thefts and illegal connections. This research aims to reduce those losses by water distribution network management, improving water finances, locating leaks and repairing them and gathering other information to help solve these issues. On the other hand, unpaid bills are a significant problem in the municipality of Keetmanshoop, and this thesis includes research on prepaid <b>water</b> <b>meters</b> in other Namibian municipalities. Prepaid <b>water</b> <b>meters</b> are one solution to increase income in water sector by forcing users to pay their water use beforehand and thus reducing the need for tariff increase. This research aims {{to answer the question}} if prepaid <b>water</b> <b>meters</b> could be the solution for Keetmanshoop water sector. The thesis is divided into two sections. The first section focuses on prepaid <b>water</b> <b>meters</b> and the other section describes the case in Keetmanshoop and discusses the current issues in the municipality. Methods used in this project included literature survey, semi-structured interviews, observation and analysis on the water distribution system. The research included field work in Keetmanshoop between June 24 th and August 23 rd, 2013. The theory part of the thesis describes the factors affecting Non-revenue water and the methods used to reduce it. The results of this study reveal that non-revenue water in Keetmanshoop is around 33 % (July 2012 - June 2013). The results of this thesis also show that prepaid <b>water</b> <b>meters</b> have not been sufficient enough for the other municipalities that were studied. Because of this, the prepaid <b>water</b> <b>meter</b> <b>system</b> is not recommended for Keetmanshoop.

40|$|Advanced <b>water</b> <b>metering</b> {{is part of}} a {{much larger}} {{movement}} towards smart networks and intelligent infrastructure. However, where advanced metering technology is focused more towards the need to obtain meter readings without human intervention {{in other parts of the}} world, in South Africa and other developing countries, advanced <b>water</b> <b>metering</b> (in the form of prepaid <b>meters</b> or <b>water</b> management devices) has been developing along a parallel path, driven by the need to provide services to previously unserved communities and deal with the problems caused by rapid urbanisation. In this report, conventional <b>water</b> <b>metering</b> is defined as <b>systems</b> using <b>water</b> <b>meters</b> that display their readings on the meters themselves and advanced <b>water</b> <b>metering</b> as <b>systems</b> that add additional components or functionality to a <b>metering</b> <b>system.</b> Advanced <b>metering</b> has the potential to provide substantial benefits if appropriately applied. However, compared with conventional <b>metering,</b> these <b>systems</b> are considerably more expensive and complicated, and often rely on technology that is still being developed. Advanced <b>metering</b> <b>systems</b> therefore carry a higher risk of failure, poor service delivery and financial losses unless the system is implemented with careful design and thorough planning. This report describes a number of case studies of the application of advanced metering in South Africa. The case studies were evaluated according to the evaluation framework described in Appendix A and their detailed evaluations are included in each relevant chapter. Evaluations were done in four areas: technical, environmental, social and economic. The technical evaluation is based on the systems complying with the relevant national metering standards and good metering practice, the environmental evaluations on battery disposal and water savings and the social evaluation on broad socio-economic indicators. It should be recognised that social issues are particularly complex and that no general evaluation framework can accurately predict whether an advanced <b>metering</b> <b>system</b> will be accepted by a particular community. The economic evaluations were based on reductions of the current system cost and not absolute values. Economic performance indicators included the effective surplus (income minus expenses over averaged over the meter service life) and capital repayment period.

40|$|This report {{provides}} information about environmental programs during the calendar year of 2010 at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory (SLAC), Menlo Park, California. Activities that overlap the calendar year - i. e., stormwater monitoring covering the winter season of 2010 / 2011 (October 2010 through May 2011) are also included. SLAC is a federally-funded {{research and development}} center with Stanford University as the M&O contractor. Under Executive Order (EO) 13423, Strengthening Federal Environmental, Energy, and Transportation Management, EO 13514, Federal Leadership in Environmental, Energy, and Economic Performance, and DOE Order 450. 1 A, Environmental Protection Program, SLAC effectively implements and integrates the key elements of an Environmental Management System (EMS) to achieve the site's integrated safety and environmental management system goals. For normal daily activities, SLAC managers and supervisors are responsible for ensuring that policies and procedures are understood and followed so that: (1) Worker safety and health are protected; (2) The environment is protected; and (3) Compliance is ensured. Throughout 2010, SLAC continued to improve its management systems. These systems provided a structured framework for SLAC to implement 'greening of the government' initiatives such as EO 13423, EO 13514, and DOE Orders 450. 1 A and 430. 2 B. Overall, management systems at SLAC are effective, supporting compliance with all relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. During 2010, there were no reportable releases to the environment from SLAC operations. In addition, many improvements in waste minimization, recycling, stormwater management, groundwater restoration, and SLAC's chemical management system (CMS) were continued. The following are among SLAC's environmental accomplishments for 2010. To facilitate management and identification of future potential greenhouse gases (GHG) reduction opportunities, SLAC voluntarily completed GHG inventories for calendar year (CY) 2008 and CY 2009 and submitted the results to The Climate Registry. A Lead Management Plan was completed to reduce the potential of lead impacting the environment, and two large legacy tube-trailer modules, each containing 38 tubes of compressed ethane, were reused or recycled by an outside contractor, resulting in hazardous waste avoidance and cost savings of approximately $ 100, 000 in transportation and disposal costs. SLAC continues to make progress on achieving the sustainability goals of EOs 13423 and 13514, which include, {{but are not limited}} to reductions in the use of water, energy, and fuel, building to green standards and reductions in GHG emissions. Phase I of the SLAC Advanced Metering project for electrical and natural gas systems was completed. Phase I included the design of the metering system and purchase of the enterprise software. The planning, design, and installation of an advanced <b>water</b> <b>metering</b> <b>system</b> for select buildings, landscape, and process systems were completed. In addition, the last major onsite chiller containing a Class I ozone-depleting substance was taken out of service, and SLAC continued to replace conventional vehicles with electric vehicles. In 2010, there were no radiological impacts to the public or the environment from SLAC operations. The potential doses to the public were negligible and far below the regulatory and SLAC administrative limits. No radiological incidents occurred that increased radiation levels to the public or released radioactivity to the environment. In addition to managing its radioactive wastes safely and responsibly, SLAC worked to reduce the amount of waste generated. SLAC shipped 2, 891 cubic feet of low-level radioactive waste, half of which was legacy waste, to appropriate treatment and disposal facilities for low-level radioactive waste. SLAC also continued its efforts to reduce the inventory of materials no longer needed for its mission by permanently removing 125 sealed radioactive sources from the inventory. Ninety-seven of the sealed sources were returned to the manufacturer, and 28 were sent to Energy Solutions for processing before being sent to the Nevada Test Site for burial. In addition, 87 concrete blocks which had been stored in an area known as the Bone Yard were surveyed for potential surface contamination and volumetric activation prior to off-site release. Based on the comprehensive measurements, all 87 blocks were qualified for release and were disposed of as ordinary materials at a landfill. In 2010, the SLAC Environmental Restoration Program personnel continued work on site characterization and evaluation of remedial alternatives at four sites with volatile organic compounds in groundwater and several areas with polychlorinated biphenyls and low concentrations of lead in soil...|$|E

40|$|The use of {{residential}} secondary or dual water systems for irrigation purposes {{is common in}} the western United States where water supplies are scarce. While the use of non-potable water in secondary systems has successfully curtailed demands on potable systems, experience has shown that overall water use actually increases {{with the introduction of}} a secondary supply because users commonly pay a fixed fee and have unlimited water use. While <b>water</b> <b>metering</b> and billing effectively reduce water use, there are two main obstacles to the widespread installation of <b>meters</b> in secondary <b>systems.</b> The first obstacle is that standard residential <b>water</b> <b>meters</b> do not normally function in debris-filled secondary <b>water.</b> <b>Metering</b> mechanisms can clog or be degraded by suspended debris of both organic and inorganic nature in the water. By way of innovative meter designs or filtration, a few secondary systems have had success <b>metering</b> their secondary <b>water.</b> Other systems have experimented with possible debris-resistant meters but have had little success. In addition to the physical limitations of <b>water</b> <b>meters,</b> secondary <b>systems</b> face economic obstacles from the increased expense of <b>metering.</b> Since secondary <b>water</b> is intended to be an inexpensive alternative to potable water for outdoor irrigation, any cost increase due to the expense of meters, filtration, meter reading, etc., interferes with the main objective of a secondary system. A system-specific economic analysis is necessary to determine the financial feasibility of the implementation of metering in any secondary system. The objective of this research is to identify feasible ways for <b>metering</b> secondary <b>water</b> <b>systems.</b> An overall analysis is made of the performance, benefits, and drawbacks of each technological approach. Approximate costs and design requirements of these technologies are identified, thereby allowing water suppliers to determine the economic feasibility of metering.

The specific objectives were to investigate the drivers for the installation of Prepaid Water Meters(PPWMs), to investigate stakeholder involvement and their perceptions of PPWMs. The study also analysed the impacts of PPWMs on residents in the selected towns. Individual PPWMs in Usakos Town and communal standpipes PPWMs in the three townâ€™s informal settlements were studied. Purposive sampling method was used to identify customers that use PPWMs. Methods usedto collect data included focus group discussions, household surveys, interviews with key informants and observations. A total of 321 household questionnaires investigating household/water user perceptions on service delivery, access and reliability, affordability of water and water use changes were administered. The study found out that the PPWMs were installed to recover costs as a result of poor revenue collection efficiency, illegal water connections and high debts of the water users. The study also found out that customers were not consulted before the introduction of the PPWMs. Although most of the respondents stated that PPWMs had a number of problems, such as the availability of tokens to top up credit, the majority preferred PPWMs to postpaid meters. The study established that the PPWMs were considered unreliable and are non-functional most of the time with along cycle time for repairs between weeks to a month. The impact on the quality of life of standpipes prepaid users was said to be positive, for example, because water was perceived to be affordable and more accessible tothe PPWMs system.

(Engineering Management) Abstract: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the optimal point at which domestic <b>water</b> <b>meters</b> are to be replaced in order to minimize apparent water losses while ensuring efficient use of financial resources. A literature review was undertaken to review the existing body of knowledge in relation to the accuracy of <b>water</b> <b>meters,</b> the effects of ageing on <b>water</b> <b>meter</b> accuracy, the impact of <b>water</b> <b>meter</b> inaccuracies on apparent water losses, as well as <b>water</b> <b>meter</b> replacement strategies. A <b>water</b> <b>meter</b> management database was analysed using the relative meter error method to determine if a relationship exists between domestic <b>water</b> <b>meter</b> age, total registered volume and accuracy. The volume of apparent water losses caused by inaccuracies due to domestic <b>water</b> <b>meter</b> age and total registered volume was determined. The net present value chain (NPVCn) method was used to determine the optimal domestic <b>water</b> <b>meter</b> replacement period. This study found no absolute relation between <b>water</b> <b>meter</b> age and total registered volume. This is probably the reason why several authors and water boards suggest a meter lifespan either by age or total registered volume and not both. A relationship was found to exist between <b>water</b> <b>meter</b> age and accuracy as well as between total registered volume and accuracy. The trend line of the median relative meter error moved from over-registration to under-registration as <b>water</b> <b>meter</b> age increased. The trend line of the median relative meter error decreased was however found to increase from under-registration to over-registration as the total registered volume increased. The average volume of apparent losses due to meter inaccuracies was determined to be 1. 8 kl per meter/per month. This figure, when considering the number of meters in the municipality, amounted to 2. 8 % of the municipality’s total system input volume and 7. 8 % of the non-revenue water. The optimal <b>water</b> <b>meter</b> replacement period of the municipality was determined using the NPVCn method to be at 9, 12 and 16 years and total registered volumes of 3 971, 5 162 and 6 750 kl at 10 %, 8 % and 6 % real discount rates, respectively...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} several {{proposed and}} existing smart utility <b>meter</b> <b>systems</b> {{as well as}} their communication networks to identify the challenges of creating scalable smart <b>water</b> <b>meter</b> networks. Network simulations are performed on 3 network topologies (star, tree and mesh) to determine their suitability for smart <b>water</b> <b>meter</b> networks. The simulations found that once a number of nodes threshold is exceeded the network’s delay increases dramatically regardless of implemented topology. This threshold is at a relatively low number of nodes (50) and the use of network topologies such as tree or mesh helps alleviate this problem and results in lower network delays. Further simulations found that the successful transmission of application layer packets in a 70 end node tree network can be improved by 212 % when end nodes only transmit data to their nearest router node. The relationship between packet success rate and different packet sizes was also investigated and reducing the packet size with a factor of 16 resulted in either 156 % or 300 % increases in the amount of successfully received packets depending on the network setup.

40|$|The {{subject of}} the {{bachelor}} thesis is the processing of water consumption analysis {{in the area of}} building faculty. The bulk of the work is devoted to the evaluation of the data obtained by the smart <b>metering</b> <b>system,</b> which is currently only installed on the billing <b>water</b> <b>meter</b> number 2 located on Veveří Street. The Faculty of Civil Engineering is very interested in new trends and possibilities to more effectively measure water consumption. The conclusion of the thesis deals with the appropriate design of the alarm values of consumption and the possible counting of other <b>water</b> <b>meters</b> in the area and associated faster and more transparent information about the water consumption values. An integral part of the work and water consumption are general information on the need for water for which there are no up-to-date comprehensive methodologies to accurately determine it. Analyzing already measured data seems to be the most accurate way of determining it. Part of the thesis is also a chapter focused on the development of water consumption in our country as well as in comparison with abroad. At present, there is a decreasing trend in water needs that began in the 1990 s...|$|R

Mueller Systems is a provider of innovative water infrastructure products and services and technologically advanced <b>metering</b> <b>systems</b> for <b>water</b> and electric systems. In addition to the Mi.Net System, the City installed approximately 18,000 Mueller <b>Systems</b> <b>water</b> <b>meters</b> throughout the City in 2014. A portion of the residential meters are Mueller Systems' 420 Remote Disconnect Meter (RDM), a fully integrated remote disconnect meter designed to enable the City to remotely manage water services through the Mi.Net System. The City also offers its constituents tools to manage their water consumption by implementing Mi.Data™, Mueller Systems' consumer portal that provides information about water usage and improved communication between households and the City.|$|R

The two-way AMI system is hosted and supported by Mueller and helps the city monitor, manage and streamline the meter-reading process. Weatherford also used Mi.Hydrants to overcome transmission problems caused by steel meter boxes and large distances between some meters. The improved leak detection, consumer information, and billing accuracy afforded by the upgrade of the city's <b>metering</b> <b>system</b> resulted in better conservation and fewer consumer complaints about usage and billing.

50|$|Meters can be prepaid or postpaid, {{depending}} on the payment method. Most mechanical type <b>water</b> <b>meters</b> are of the postpaid type, as are electromagnetic and ultrasonic <b>meters.</b> With prepaid <b>water</b> <b>meters</b> the user purchases and prepays for a given amount of water from a vending station. The amount of water credited is entered on media such as an IC or RF type card. The main difference is whether the card needs a contact with the processing part of the prepaid <b>water</b> <b>meter.</b> In some areas a prepaid <b>water</b> <b>meter</b> uses a keypad as the interface for inputting the water credit.|$|R
