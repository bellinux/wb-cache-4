25|$|Historians {{are fairly}} certain that Findláech was ruling before 1014 because the Orkneyinga Saga reads {{that before the}} Battle of Clontarf, Jarl Siguðr of Orkney fought a battle with the Scots, who were led by a Jarl Finnlekr (i.e. Findláech the Mormaer). An Irish princess called Eithne made a banner for Siguðr, which had on it a raven. The saga records that Siguðr later brought the banner to Clontarf, where he was killed. If <b>we</b> <b>believe</b> <b>this,</b> then Findláech would be ruler quite a bit before 1014.|$|E
500|$|The {{arguments}} of the bill's opponents attracted little support in the Senate. The Eisenhower administration, the Alaska territorial government and mainstream religious groups were all {{in favor of the}} bill. The Alaska Presbyterian Church gave the bill its unanimous support, issuing a statement declaring: [...] "As Christian citizens of Alaska <b>we</b> <b>believe</b> <b>this</b> is a progressive measure for the care and treatment of the mentally ill of Alaska. We deplore the present antiquated methods of handling our mentally ill." [...] It also urged the National Council of Churches to mobilize support for the bill. An overwhelming majority of senators of both parties were also supportive.

500|$|On October 4, 2011, 20th Century Fox Television {{released}} a statement saying: [...] "23 seasons in, The Simpsons is as creatively vibrant as ever and beloved by millions around the world. <b>We</b> <b>believe</b> <b>this</b> brilliant series can and should continue, but we cannot produce future seasons under its current financial model. We are hopeful that we can reach {{an agreement with the}} voice cast that allows The Simpsons to go on entertaining audiences with original episodes for many years to come." [...] One of the problems was that The Simpsons was possibly worth more cancelled than on the air. A 17-year-old syndication deal with local TV stations prohibits Fox from selling the show to cable networks. As long as The Simpsons still produces new episodes, Fox cannot break this deal. In the mean time, cable networks have grown to become just as big a market as the local TV stations. Another consideration was that Fox's parent company News Corp was having meetings discussing the possibility of a cable channel that would only air The Simpsons episodes. Analysts consider a cancellation and subsequent second-run deal that includes cable networks to be worth $750 million. On this issue, Jean commented in an interview with TV Guide that [...] "It's a big company, and there are definitely people whose interests would have been better served by ending it. Those interests were superseded because we're still valuable to the network in terms of our ratings." ...|$|E

500|$|In January 2012, {{when asked}} if the game would be {{available}} on Nintendo's Wii U console, Crystal Dynamics global brand director Karl Stewart responded there are no plans to have the game available on that platform. According to Stewart, {{the reason for this is}} that [...] "it would not be right" [...] for the game to simply be ported, as the developers built the game to be platform-specific before the Wii U was announced, and goes on to mention that if they started building the game for the platform [...] " [...] would build it very differently and [...] would build it with unique functionality."

500|$|On October 18, 2016, an {{anonymous}} woman sued Michael Jackson's Estate, MJJ Productions and MJJ Ventures, alleging {{she had been}} sexually-abused by Jackson when she was 12-15, from 1986-1989 in Jackson's Encino home, hotels, the [...] "Smooth Criminal" [...] set, the [...] "Moonwalker" [...] movie set, {{in the back of}} his limousine, his Neverland Ranch, and an apartment/condo he nicknamed [...] "The Hideout". She provided letters, love notes allegedly written by Jackson, multiple gifts apparently given by Jackson, a jacket he supposedly gave to her after an Album photo-shoot, checks given to her from 1990-1993 totaling $920,000 sent from Michael Jackson, MJJ Ventures, and MJJ Productions—coming directly from Jackson's back-accounts, and a 1993 Santa Barbara PD letter alleging that the Police Department concluded she [...] "knew all about Child Abuse" [...] to come in and speak to them, regarding their investigation. Her complaint alleges that she never considered her emotional/psychological injuries to be a result of her sexual activities with Jackson until she reflected on those experiences for the first time in September 2016, and that even if she had wanted to she could not possibly come forward earlier because she was threatened with physical harm if she ever told anyone, told that she would get in trouble with law enforcement and go to jail if she did, and that Jackson made her promise not to tell anyone. A lawyer for the Businesses dismissed the allegations saying, [...] "This is yet another attempt to hit the lottery by suing the estate of Michael Jackson more than seven years after Michael's death and close to 30 years after these incidents supposedly occurred. <b>We</b> <b>believe</b> <b>this</b> claim was created from whole cloth and is without any merit.

6000|$|Now it is {{well known}} to even the merely {{decorative}} painter that no color can be brilliant which is laid over one of a corresponding key, and that the best ground for any given opaque color will be a comparatively subdued tint of the complemental one; of green under red, of violet under yellow, and of orange or brown therefore under blue. We apprehend accordingly that the real value of the brown ground with Titian was far greater than even with Rubens; it was to support and give preciousness to cool color above, while it remained itself untouched as the representative of warm reflexes and extreme depth of transparent gloom. <b>We</b> <b>believe</b> <b>this</b> employment of the brown ground to be the only means of uniting majesty of hue with profundity of shade.

Alas! there was not the virtue in her statesmen {{to respond to this}} greatness in the hero.

Not thus, but as the old Hebrews thought of it, as a glorious and a divine universe, in which the Spirit of God, the Lord and Giver of life, creates eternal melody, bringing for ever life out of death, light out of darkness, letting his breath go forth that new generations may be made, and herein renew the face of the earth.|$|E
