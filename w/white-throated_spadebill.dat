50|$|The <b>white-throated</b> <b>spadebill</b> (Platyrinchus mystaceus) {{is a tiny}} {{passerine}} bird in {{the tyrant}} flycatcher family. It lives in the tropical Americas.|$|E
50|$|Protected species include white-necked hawk (Buteogallus lacernulatus), oncilla (Leopardus tigrinus), black-cheeked gnateater (Conopophaga melanops), rufous gnateater (Conopophaga lineata), buff-throated purpletuft (Iodopleura pipra), {{blue-crowned motmot}} (Momotus momota), {{scalloped}} antbird (Myrmeciza ruficauda), spot-winged wood quail (Odontophorus capueira), rusty-margined guan (Penelope superciliaris), golden-spangled piculet (Picumnus exilis), <b>white-throated</b> <b>spadebill</b> (Platyrinchus mystaceus) and plain xenops (Xenops minutus).|$|E
50|$|<b>White-throated</b> <b>spadebills</b> are solitary active birds, {{difficult}} to see as they move rapidly through the undergrowth in search of small arthropods, their mainstay food. These are taken with a sudden upward-darting sally flight and audible bill-snap from under the foliage, or less often from mid-air. This species occasionally joins mixed-species feeding flocks.|$|R
50|$|The {{subspecies}} Platyrinchus mystaceus insularis occurs only in Trinidad, Tobago and in Venezuela, {{other forms}} differing in {{the brightness of}} the underparts or the crown colour. The taxonomy of this species is uncertain, with some dubious subspecies, but also the possibility that what is usually treated as the <b>white-throated</b> <b>spadebill</b> consists of more than one species.|$|E
50|$|Other birds {{observed}} in the park include the rufous-tailed jacamar (Galbula ruficauda), squirrel cuckoo (Piaya cayana), southern beardless tyrannulet (Camptostoma obsoletum), purple-throated euphonia (Euphonia chlorotica), grey-headed tanager (Eucometis penicillata), barred antshrike (Thamnophilus doliatus), pale-breasted thrush (Turdus leucomelas), toco toucan (Ramphastos toco), <b>white-throated</b> <b>spadebill</b> (Platyrinchus mystaceus), sepia-capped flycatcher (Leptopogon amaurocephalus), silver-beaked tanager (Ramphocelus carbo), planalto tyrannulet (Phyllomyias fasciatus), bananaquit (Coereba flaveola) and red-eyed vireo (Vireo olivaceus).|$|E
50|$|The <b>white-throated</b> <b>spadebill</b> breeds from Costa Rica through South America {{to western}} Ecuador, Brazil, and northeastern Argentina. It also occurs on both Trinidad and Tobago. This bird was {{recently}} {{found to be}} far more common on the Amazonian slope of the Colombian Cordillera Oriental than it was believed in the 20th century. It is not rare in its wide range, and thus not considered a threatened species by the IUCN.|$|E
5000|$|The adult <b>white-throated</b> <b>spadebill</b> is 3.8 in (9.7 cm) long, weighs 0.33 oz (9.3 g), and has large {{eyes and}} a very short tail. The large head is distinctively marked, with a long {{yellowish}} supercilium, blackish ear coverts, yellow eyering, and a black stripe down {{each side of the}} neck. The crown has a concealed yellow crest, which is erected as a fan by the singing male. The upperparts are dark olive brown, and the underparts are buff apart from the white throat. The bill is black above and brown below, and is very broad and flat, hence the English and scientific names [...] "spadebill" [...] and Platyrinchus.|$|E
5000|$|Nine-primaried oscines make up much {{of almost}} every Neotropical mixed-species feeding flock. Namely, these birds are from {{families}} such as the cardinals, Parulidae (New World [...] "warblers"), and in particular Emberizidae (American [...] "sparrows") and Thraupidae (tanagers). Other members of a Neotropic mixed feeding flock may come {{from most of the}} local families of smaller diurnal insectivorous birds, and can also include woodpecker, toucans, and trogons. Most Furnariidae do not participate in mixed flocks, though there are exceptions such as Synallaxis spinetails and some species of the woodcreeper subfamily - e.g. those mentioned above or the lesser woodcreeper - are common or even [...] "core" [...] members. Among the tyrant flycatchers there are also some species joining mixed flocks on a somewhat regular basis, including the sepia-capped flycatcher, eared pygmy tyrant, <b>white-throated</b> <b>spadebill,</b> and Oustalet's tyrannulet.|$|E
