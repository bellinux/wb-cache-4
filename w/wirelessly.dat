5|$|The SIII's Li-ion 2,100mAh {{battery is}} said to have a 790-hour standby time or 11hours of talk time on 3G, {{compared}} to 900hours in standby and 21hours of talk time on 2G. Built into the battery is near field communication (NFC) connectivity, which allows users to share map directions and YouTube videos quickly using Wi-Fi Direct (through Android Beam), and perform non-touch payments at shops that employ specially equipped NFC cash registers. The battery can be <b>wirelessly</b> charged using a special charging pad (sold separately) that utilizes magnetic resonance to produce a magnetic field through which electricity could be transferred.|$|E
5|$|Each {{battery-powered}} vehicle, or AGV, {{is made up}} of two platforms. Riders sit on {{the upper}} platform, which provides three degrees of freedom. A lower platform provides omnidirectional lateral movement. Unlike previous ride designs, the trackless system and the wheel and motor configurations allow movements diagonal to a rider's perspective. The vehicles use a dead reckoning system developed by Frog AGV to navigate their way through the environment, allowing a vehicle to cross another's path. Each vehicle features a built-in controller, which <b>wirelessly</b> communicates with a central ride-system controller. Movement commands are issued by the ride-system controller, and executed by the vehicles' controllers. A specially-designed battery and charge system allow the vehicles to be quickly charged while docked at the loading and unloading platforms.|$|E

25|$|Wiltshire Police are {{the first}} to give every officer a PDA and {{personal}} computer under a £3million pound venture to make the police more efficient by reducing paperwork and keeping officers on the streets instead of at the police station. Their equipment allows them to write and submit electronic reports <b>wirelessly,</b> to take pictures of crime or criminals and submit them to nearby officers and to receive emails or reports on local crimes, criminals and collisions that they are attending.|$|E
25|$|Communication {{cooperation}} {{on the road}} includes car-to-car, car-to-infrastructure, and vice versa. Data available from vehicles are acquired and transmitted to a server for central fusion and processing. These data {{can be used to}} detect events such as rain (wiper activity) and congestion (frequent braking activities). The server processes a driving recommendation dedicated to a single or a specific group of drivers and transmits it <b>wirelessly</b> to vehicles. The goal of cooperative systems is to use and plan communication and sensor infrastructure to increase road safety.|$|E
25|$|Based on inspections, on 30 October the {{government}} decided {{that there was}} a problem with SDU voting machines because within a radius of 10 metres the machines could be <b>wirelessly</b> monitored, so that these machines could not guarantee anonymity of voting to a sufficient degree. These machines, which are in use in 35 municipalities, including Amsterdam, have to be improved or replaced with an alternative before the elections. Many municipalities, including Amsterdam, decided to switch to the traditional pen and red pencil method of voting instead of the SDU machines. Machines made by Nedap are still in use.|$|E
25|$|The Internet allows greater {{flexibility}} in working hours and location, {{especially with the}} spread of unmetered high-speed connections. The Internet can be accessed almost anywhere by numerous means, including through mobile Internet devices. Mobile phones, datacards, handheld game consoles and cellular routers allow users to connect to the Internet <b>wirelessly.</b> Within the limitations imposed by small screens and other limited facilities of such pocket-sized devices, the services of the Internet, including email and the web, may be available. Service providers may restrict the services offered and mobile data charges may be significantly higher than other access methods.|$|E
25|$|Assistive {{listening}} devices include FM, infrared, and loop assistive listening devices. This type {{of technology}} allows people with hearing difficulties {{to focus on}} a speaker or subject by getting rid of extra background noises and distractions, making places like auditoriums, classrooms, and meetings much easier to participate in. The assistive listening device usually uses a microphone to capture an audio source near to its origin and broadcast it <b>wirelessly</b> over an FM (Frequency Modulation) transmission, IR (Infra Red) transmission, IL (Induction Loop) transmission, or other transmission methods. The person who is listening may use an FM/IR/IL Receiver to tune into the signal and listen at his/her preferred volume.|$|E
25|$|Biocompatible {{microchip}} implants that utilize RFID {{technology are}} being routinely implanted in to humans. The first reported experiment with RFID implants {{was conducted by}} British professor of cybernetics Kevin Warwick who had an RFID chip implanted in his arm by his general practitioner George Boulos in 1998. In 2004 the 'Baja Beach Clubs' operated by Conrad Chase in Barcelona and Rotterdam offered implanted chips to identify their VIP customers, who could in turn use it to pay for service. In 2009 British scientist Mark Gasson had an advanced glass capsule RFID device surgically implanted into {{his left hand and}} subsequently demonstrated how a computer virus could <b>wirelessly</b> infect his implant and then be transmitted on to other systems.|$|E
25|$|The Minimed Paradigm series' RF link also {{supports}} a continuous blood glucose sensor {{known as the}} Paradigm REAL-Time Continuous Glucose Monitor that <b>wirelessly</b> provides an interstitial glucose value every 5 minutes on the pump screen. The Medtronic REAL-Time System {{was the first to}} link a continuous monitor with an insulin pump system. In the Minimed 530G with Enlite (in the US) or Paradigm Veo (in other countries), the pump can enter a low glucose suspend mode stopping all insulin delivery (bolus and basal insulin) if interstitial glucose values fall below the hypoglycemia threshold. In the Minimed 640G insulin pump series, low glucose suspend mode can also be entered based on predicted hypoglycemia.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{hearing aids}} include {{wireless}} hearing aids. One hearing aid can transmit {{to the other}} side so that pressing one aid's program button simultaneously changes the other aid, so that both aids change background settings simultaneously. FM listening systems are now emerging with wireless receivers integrated with the use of hearing aids. A separate wireless microphone can be given to a partner to wear in a restaurant, in the car, during leisure time, in the shopping mall, at lectures, or during religious services. The voice is transmitted <b>wirelessly</b> to the hearing aids eliminating the effects of distance and background noise. FM systems have shown to give the best speech understanding in noise of all available technologies.|$|E
25|$|A metamaterial-based device <b>wirelessly</b> {{converts}} a 900MHz microwave {{signal to}} 7.3 volts of direct current (greater {{than that of}} a USB device). The device can be tuned to harvest other signals including Wi-Fi signals, satellite signals, or even sound signals. The experimental device used a series of five fiberglass and copper conductors. Conversion efficiency reached 37 percent. When traditional antennas are close to each other in space they interfere with each other. But since RF power goes down by the cube of the distance, the amount of power is very very small. While the claim of 7.3 volts is grand, the measurement is for an open circuit. Since the power is so low, there can be almost no current when any load is attached.|$|E
25|$|In electronics, {{a remote}} control is a {{component}} of an electronic device used to operate the device <b>wirelessly</b> from a distance. For example, in consumer electronics, {{a remote control}} {{can be used to}} operate devices such as a television set, DVD player, or other home appliance, from a short distance. A remote control is primarily a convenience feature for the user, and can allow operation of devices that are out of convenient reach for direct operation of controls. In some cases, remote controls allow a person to operate a device that they otherwise {{would not be able to}} reach, as when a garage door opener is triggered from outside or when a Digital Light Processing projector that is mounted on a high ceiling is controlled by a person from the floor level.|$|E
25|$|In November 2013, Jawbone {{announced}} the UP24 and a software update. With similar dimensions to the UP, UP24 features {{the ability to}} sync <b>wirelessly</b> via Bluetooth to the updated app. UP24 has as a 7-day battery life (depending on use) and the previous 3.5mm connector {{was replaced by a}} 2.5mm connector. The software provided more real-time information to help motivate users. The app also suggests goals based on user's habits. Live notifications are provided on the UP24 so users will get push notifications when they get close to their goals. A new activity log gives a snapshot of a user's day and when the UP24 last synced. The 3.0 app also will automatically analyze sleep data from the previous night if users forget to press the button for sleep mode, and lets users edit sleep/wake times.|$|E
25|$|The Zune 80 was {{announced}} on October 2, 2007, {{along with the}} smaller Zune 4 and Zune 8 to compete with Apple's iPod nano line. These were {{to be known as}} the second generation of Zune devices. The Zune 80 featured a 3.2inch screen, while the Zune 4 and 8 come with an 1.8inch screen. Both come with a new touchpad-style input device ("squircle") and new software. Additional file support for H.264 and MPEG-4 formats was also included, whereas the older Zune 30 requires these formats to be transcoded to WMV prior to sync. The ability to sync <b>wirelessly</b> (automatically if connected to a power supply), podcast support, and an upgraded song-sharing licensing became available on all models. The new software also allowed a Zune device to communicate with other Zune devices to share pictures and songs. A free firmware update added the new software features to the original Zune 30, and was released on November 13, 2007.|$|E
