5|$|To perform {{gas metal arc}} welding, {{the basic}} {{necessary}} equipment is a welding gun, a wire feed unit, a welding power supply, a welding electrode <b>wire,</b> <b>and</b> a shielding gas supply.|$|E
5|$|A related process, {{flux-cored}} {{arc welding}} (FCAW), uses similar equipment but uses wire {{consisting of a}} steel electrode surrounding a powder fill material. This cored wire is {{more expensive than the}} standard solid <b>wire</b> <b>and</b> can generate fumes and/or slag, but it permits even higher welding speed and greater metal penetration.|$|E
5|$|Aware of {{the time}} constraints, Otway decided he could wait no longer, and the reduced {{battalion}} headed for the battery and joined up with Major Smith's reconnaissance party just outside the village of Gonneville en Auge. The reconnaissance party had cut a way through the barbed <b>wire,</b> <b>and</b> marked four routes through the minefield. Otway divided his men into four assault groups, and settled down to await {{the arrival of the}} three gliders.|$|E
40|$|Dimensionality is an {{important}} factor to govern the electronic structures of semiconductor nanocrystals. The quantum confinement energies in one-dimensional quantum <b>wires</b> <b>and</b> zero-dimensional quantum dots are quite different. Using large-scale first-principles calculations, we systematically study the electronic structures of semiconductor (including group IV, III-V, and II-VI) surface-passivated quantum <b>wires</b> <b>and</b> dots. The band-gap energies of quantum <b>wires</b> <b>and</b> dots have the same scaling with diameter for a given material. The ratio of band-gap-increases between quantum <b>wires</b> <b>and</b> dots is material-dependent, and slightly deviates from 0. 586 predicted by effective-mass approximation. Highly linear polarization of photoluminescence in quantum wires is found. The degree of polarization decreases with the increasing temperature and size...|$|R
50|$|The <b>wired</b> <b>AND</b> {{function}} can {{be achieved}} by simply tying gate outputs together to a common-collector pull-up resistor. The <b>wired</b> <b>AND</b> function below is achieved by using open collector TTL gates. This is commonly called Dot OR.|$|R
40|$|Periodic {{arrays of}} 150 and 175 nm-wide GaAs–AlAs quantum <b>wires</b> <b>and</b> quantum dots were investigated, {{fabricated}} by electron beam lithography, and SiCl 4 /O 2 reactive ion etching, {{by means of}} reciprocal space mapping using triple axis x-ray diffractometry. From the x-ray data the lateral periodicity of <b>wires</b> <b>and</b> dots, and the etch depth are extracted. The reciprocal space maps reveal that after the fabrication process the lattice constant along the growth direction slightly increases for the <b>wires</b> <b>and</b> even more so for the dots...|$|R
5|$|Beaches {{were blocked}} with {{entanglements}} of barbed wire, {{usually in the}} form of three coils of concertina wire fixed by metal posts, or a simple fence of straight wires supported on waist-high posts. The wire would also demarcate extensive minefields, with both anti-tank and anti-personnel mines on and behind the beaches. On many of the more remote beaches this combination of <b>wire</b> <b>and</b> mines represented {{the full extent of the}} passive defences.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{competition}} from other materials, copper remains the preferred electrical conductor in nearly all categories of electrical wiring except overhead electric power transmission where aluminium is often preferred. Copper wire is used in power generation, power transmission, power distribution, telecommunications, electronics circuitry, and countless types of electrical equipment. Electrical wiring {{is the most important}} market for the copper industry. This includes structural power wiring, power distribution cable, appliance wire, communications cable, automotive <b>wire</b> <b>and</b> cable, and magnet wire. Roughly half of all copper mined is used for electrical <b>wire</b> <b>and</b> cable conductors. Many electrical devices rely on copper wiring because of its multitude of inherent beneficial properties, such as its high electrical conductivity, tensile strength, ductility, creep (deformation) resistance, corrosion resistance, low thermal expansion, high thermal conductivity, ease of soldering, malleability, and ease of installation.|$|E
5|$|Imaginative spectators {{would climb}} {{the church and}} watch a {{football}} game from the rooftop however they have now been deterred from doing so with the installation of security measures such as barbed <b>wire</b> <b>and</b> anti-climb paint. In addition, {{the introduction of the}} 'all-seater' ruling following the Taylor Report has meant that spectators no longer resort to climbing nearby buildings for a glimpse of the event as a seat is guaranteed with a purchased ticket.|$|E

5|$|In April 1999, {{on the eve}} of the retrial of {{the federal}} case, Keating entered a plea agreement. He {{admitted}} to having committed four counts of <b>wire</b> <b>and</b> bankruptcy fraud by extracting nearly $1 million from American Continental Corp. while already anticipating the collapse that happened weeks later. The federal prosecutors dropped all other charges against him and his son, Charles Keating III. He was sentenced to time served.|$|E
5|$|In {{southern}} Florida, {{damage was}} mostly limited to moderate wind gusts; in Miami-Dade County, gusty winds knocked out several traffic lights along U.S. 1, the only route {{to and from}} the Florida Keys. A man died in Ft. Lauderdale when he stepped on a downed electrical <b>wire</b> <b>and</b> was electrocuted. Also, 100,000homes in Miami Dade County were without electric power.|$|E
5|$|The border clearers' {{task was}} aided unofficially by German civilians {{from both sides}} of the former border, who {{scavenged}} the installations for fencing, <b>wire</b> <b>and</b> blocks of concrete to use in home improvements. Much of the fence was sold to a West German scrap-metal company. Environmental groups undertook a programme of re-greening the border, planting new trees and sowing grass seed to fill in the clear-cut area along the line.|$|E

5|$|The {{village of}} Villy lies about one {{kilometer}} {{to the northwest}} of ouvrage La Ferté. Villy itself was fortified {{with more than a}} dozen blockhouses, along with networks of barbed <b>wire</b> <b>and</b> tank obstacles. The blockhouses were primarily prepared, reinforced firing positions and did not necessarily possess fixed armament.|$|E
5|$|There {{is limited}} {{industrial}} activity — the major industries are household, tailoring, embroidery, plastic <b>wire</b> <b>and</b> metal manufacturing. Cauvery Basin Refinery, {{a subsidiary of}} Chennai Petroleum Corporation Limited (CPCL) is near Nagapattinam. Established in 1993, {{it is a major}} contributor to the economy of the town. The development of industries is constrained by the town being linear and by the applicability of Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) regulations that prevent large-scale construction and industrial buildings.|$|E
5|$|To {{find the}} shape of the minimal surface bounded by some {{arbitrary}} shaped frame using strictly mathematical means can be a daunting task.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we suggest a novel {{approach}} to realize ATM-based mixed <b>wired</b> <b>and</b> wireless access network by optical microwave generation techniques with inherent support of both interface types. The physical principle is explained and an analytical expression describing the transfer behavior under idealized and non-ideal conditions is derived and discussed. As a result we show that all modulation schemes for the <b>wired</b> <b>and</b> wireless channels are possible. Further we turn to practical aspects and demonstrate how to implement mixed <b>wired</b> <b>and</b> wireless access, and finally we point out some realization aspects...|$|R

5|$|World War I saw great {{changes in}} the use of cavalry. The mode of warfare changed, and the use of trench warfare, barbed <b>wire</b> <b>and</b> machine guns {{rendered}} traditional cavalry almost obsolete. Tanks, introduced in 1917, began to take over the role of shock combat.|$|E
5|$|A team {{of doctors}} and {{surgeons}} at the Fifteenth Scottish Hospital in Cairo worked extensively on Smith, putting his jaw back together with a complicated assembly of bandage, plaster, nuts, bolts and <b>wire,</b> <b>and</b> rebuilt his face through skin grafts and other reconstructive surgery. In March 1944, after about five months' convalescence, he was passed fit for flying. He turned down the offer of a posting home to Southern Rhodesia as an instructor and, after a refresher course in Egypt, travelled to Corsica to rejoin No. 237 Squadron, which was by now flying Spitfire Mk IXs.|$|E
5|$|According to a survivor, Nada Požega from Slavonia, the {{children}} were forced {{to go to church}} to pray, and were required to greet others with the Ustaše greeting Spremni (Ready) or the Nazi salute Heil Hitler. Those children that failed to do so were punished by the Ustaše guards with either a beating or solitary confinement. Požega further stated the nuns did not treat {{the children}} with sympathy or care. Another survivor, Mihajlo Veljić, recalled that the barracks were fenced with barbed <b>wire,</b> <b>and</b> that they slept on the floor covered with straw. He stated that the Ustaše tried to convert the children to Catholicism. He personally feared a nun, Sister Mercedes, but all the children feared Pulherija.|$|E
40|$|Rogue Access Point (RAP) is {{a network}} {{vulnerability}} phenomenon of improper usage of wireless Access Point unknown to an organizational network engineer. Once it {{is inside the}} subnet or Local Area Network (wired structure) {{then we need to}} rectify of its availability. The process of rectifying can be classified into passive monitoring, using visualization and traffic characteristic. We prefer traffic characteristic scanning where a packet capturing can become one of the best tools to differentiate between <b>wired</b> <b>and</b> wireless network. Our main concentration is time stamping as a value added to packet capturing for <b>wired</b> <b>and</b> wireless differentiation. The time stamping is done at two point inbound inside subnet focusing on a PAYLOAD and its ACK using network test bed measured by finding an average of 100 PAYLOAD-ACK pairs. The test show about 16 to 56 percent differences between <b>wired</b> <b>and</b> wireless g mode and 15 to 26 percent differences between <b>wired</b> <b>and</b> wireless n mode. As a result, it shows that there is more delay on wireless than the <b>wired</b> <b>and</b> easier for us to detect RAP existence in wired network...|$|R
