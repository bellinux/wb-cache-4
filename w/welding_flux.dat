5|$|GMAW {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular welding methods, {{especially}} in industrial environments. It is used extensively by the sheet metal industry and, by extension, the automobile industry. There, the method is often used for arc spot welding, thereby replacing riveting or resistance spot welding. It is also popular for automated welding, in which robots handle the workpieces and the welding gun to speed up the manufacturing process. GMAW can be difficult to perform well outdoors, since drafts can dissipate the shielding gas and allow contaminants into the weld; flux cored arc welding is better suited for outdoor use such as in construction.

5|$|To {{supply the}} {{electrical}} power necessary for arc welding processes, {{a variety of}} different power supplies can be used. The most common welding power supplies are constant current power supplies and constant voltage power supplies. In arc welding, the length of the arc {{is directly related to the}} voltage, and the amount of heat input is related to the current. Constant current power supplies are most often used for manual welding processes such as gas tungsten arc welding and shielded metal arc welding, because they maintain a relatively constant current even as the voltage varies. This is important because in manual welding, it can be difficult to hold the electrode perfectly steady, and as a result, the arc length and thus voltage tend to fluctuate. Constant voltage power supplies hold the voltage constant and vary the current, and as a result, are most often used for automated welding processes such as gas metal arc <b>welding,</b> <b>flux</b> cored arc welding, and submerged arc welding. In these processes, arc length is kept constant, since any fluctuation in the distance between the wire and the base material is quickly rectified by a large change in current. For example, if the wire and the base material get too close, the current will rapidly increase, which in turn causes the heat to increase and the tip of the wire to melt, returning it to its original separation distance.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Submerged arc welding, {{because of}} its {{inherent}} benefits such as higher metal deposition rate, good strength of the joint and good surface appearance, is extensively used in the fabrication of pressure vessels, pipe lines and off-shore structures. <b>Welding</b> <b>flux</b> constitutes {{nearly half of the}} cost in SAW process. Over the years, development of better <b>welding</b> <b>flux</b> compositions in terms of mechanical properties and productivity, which are economically cost effective too, has caught the eye of many researchers.

40|$|The {{traditional}} <b>welding</b> <b>flux</b> {{development has}} been by cost, material, time and labour intensive experiments. The extensive and expensive trial and error experimentation is needed because {{it is often difficult}} to know a priori how the flux ingredients interact to determine the operational characteristics of the flux and the final performance of the welded structure. The limitation of the traditional approach includes: (1) long lead-time (2) expensive experiments in terms of materials and energy consumption and labour requirements (3) the flux developed can not be guaranteed to be optimal and (4) inability to identify and quantify direct and interaction effects of flux ingredients. These constraints are due to the paucity of statistical modelling tools in <b>welding</b> <b>flux</b> technology. Since prediction models are derived from designed experiments, flux researchers need other methods by which flux experiments may be designed. This paper discusses a statistical modelling tool known as mixture experiment which has the potential to revolutionize <b>welding</b> <b>flux</b> development technology. Mixture design is discussed but not fully developed. The procedure of mixture experiment, analytical model forms and the sequence of model fitting are discussed.

Significant oxygen contamination promotes fluorine contamination and suppresses classical thermal sensitization, even in Type 304 steels.
