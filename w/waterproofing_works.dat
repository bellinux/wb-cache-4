40|$|Background: Construction {{painters}} {{have not}} been studied well {{in terms of their}} hazards exposure. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the exposure levels of total volatile organic compounds (TVOCs) for painters in the construction industry. Methods: Activity-specific personal air samplings were carried out in three waterproofing activities [polyurethane (PU), asphalt, and cement mortar] and three painting activities (epoxy, oil based, and water based) by using organic-vapor-monitor passive-sampling devices. Gas chromatograph with flame ionization detector could be used for identifying and quantifying individual organic chemicals. The levels of TVOCs, by summing up 15 targeted substances, were expressed in exposure-index (EI) values. Results: As arithmetic means in the order of concentration levels, the EIs of TVOCs in <b>waterproofing</b> <b>works</b> were 10. 77, 2. 42, 1. 78, 1. 68, 0. 47, 0. 07, and none detected (ND) for indoor PU-primer task, outdoor PU-primer task, outdoor PU-resin task, indoor PU-resin task, asphalt-primer task, asphalt-adhesive task, and cement-mortar task, respectively. The highest EI for painting works was 5. 61 for indoor epoxy-primer task, followed by indoor epoxy-resin task (2. 03), outdoor oil-based-spray-paint task (1. 65), outdoor water-based-paint task (0. 66), and indoor oil-based-paint task (0. 15). Assuming that the operations were carried out continuously for 8 hours without breaks and by using the arithmetic means of EIs for each of the 12 tasks in this study, 58. 3 % (7 out of 12) exceeded the exposure limit of 100 % (EI >  1. 0), while 8. 3 % (1 out of 12) was in 50 – 100 % of exposure limit (0. 5  > EI >  1. 0), and 4 tasks out of 12 were located in less than 50 % of the limit range (EI <  0. 5). Conclusion: From this study, we recognized that construction painters are exposed to various solvents, including carcinogens and reproductive toxins, and the levels of TVOC concentration in many of the painting tasks exceeded the exposure limits. Construction workers need to be protected from chemical agents during their painting works by using personal protective devices and/or work practice measures. Additional studies should focus on the exposure assessment of other hazards for construction workers, in order to identify high-risk tasks and to improve hazardous work environments...|$|E
5000|$|After the {{building}} was left empty for around nine years, the hotel was purchased by Gloucester City Council in 2011.

25|$|In the {{following}} investigation, {{it was discovered}} that the tent had not been fireproofed. Ringling Bros. had applied to the Army, which had an absolute priority on the material, for enough fireproofing liquid to treat their Big Top. The Army had refused to release it to them. The circus had instead waterproofed their canvas using an older method of paraffin dissolved in gasoline and painted onto the canvas. The <b>waterproofing</b> <b>worked,</b> but as had been repeatedly shown it was horribly flammable. Circus management was found to be negligent and several Ringling executives served sentences in jail. Ringling Brothers' management set aside all profits for the next ten years to pay the claims filed against the show by the City of Hartford and the survivors of the fire.|$|R
40|$|AbstractMan-made {{products}} containing 95 … 96 % of amorphous nanostructured silica {{were studied}} {{for the purpose}} of their usage as modifiers for cement mortars. These products are “belaya sazha (carbon white) ” BS 120 (BS) obtained by means of hydrochemical synthesis and amorphous silicon dioxide (ADK) produced from rice husk being thermally treated at 800 оС. Morphological properties and pozzolanic activity of the modifiers were analyzed. Nanostructured material BS is formed from corpuscular nanoscaled particles that are merged into aggregates. Lamellar and flaky ADK particles consist of coalesced nanoscaled granules. The authors explain improving the performance properties of nanomodified cement mortars: increase of durability, water resistance and adhesion indices, reduction of water adsorption and decrease of shrinkage deformation while hardening. Development of mortar formula for <b>waterproofing</b> <b>work</b> is the practical application of the research findings...|$|R

Currently, the station is undergoing extensive reconstruction and restoration. On April 4, 2013, the old South Ferry station was reopened in order to provide service for South Ferry and was connected to Whitehall Street to keep the free transfer. The new station reopened on June 27, 2017, at which time the old station closed again.|$|R
40|$|The {{existing}} {{stock at}} this time in our country is, in general, described by the old buildings built before 1990. Their degradation, from waterproofing protection point of view, noticeable by infiltrations of water, both {{at the level of the}} superstructure (roof, and the default thermal-hydro isolation) and infrastructure (walls), is a result of multiple causes. Some of these causes were: deficient work of hydro isolation, thereby understanding the failure in implementing details, the use of materials with poor technical characteristics or savings regarding use of materials, improperly qualified or unqualified personnel for such activities. Intervention on buildings that have such problems, in order to ensure the requirements and criteria for specific performance of the <b>waterproofing</b> <b>work,</b> should pursue aspects of analysing the current situation, diagnose the causes of infiltrations, determining solutions and how to remedy those works, in order to comply with the specifications of the quality Law 10 / 1995 and the general requirement of waterproofing isolation...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe paper {{considers}} {{the possibility of}} furfural hardening by oligomeric acid, which is both a hardener and a direct participant in processes of polymerization and polycondensation. Low viscosity furfural-based binders, which gelling time is 40 - 60 minutes were developed. They {{can be used to}} produce highly filled materials having high physical and mechanical properties and chemical resistance to water and aggressive acidic media. Use of the developed binder as a protective compound for concrete structures is very promising. The coating partially contacts with the concrete surface forming insoluble phosphates. Thus, the protected structure becomes <b>waterproof</b> and can <b>work</b> in an aggressive environment for a long time...|$|R
5000|$|The Coca Cola Project, {{initiated}} in early 2009 and completed {{at the end}} of 2011, began when the artist bought one ton of Coca-Cola at a large supermarket. He then proceeded to construct a [...] "kitchen" [...] in his studio, and during this time made numerous sketches and conducted various related experiments. At the end of 2009, the artist decided to move the operation to Dandong, Liaoning Province, a city that borders North Korea. It is at this location where the artist employed ten workers who together fabricated ten iron vessels within a site structure. The structure was built using over ten tons of lumber and featured <b>waterproof</b> canopies. <b>Working</b> on the project uninterruptedly for over one and a half years, which totaled more than 6000 man-hours, the artist and his team ultimately cooked 127 tons of Coca Cola and extracted 40 cubic meters of cooked residue. What astonished the artist was that during the process of extraction, a range of groups—which included public security, firefighters, border control, and environmental organizations—all came to investigate, inspect and collect evidence, which ultimately led to the artist incurring fees and fines.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Tannery {{effluent}} treatment plant sludge is a by-product of leather-making industry in which chrome compounds {{are the most common}} used materials. The aim of this work was to investigate the effects and feasibility in the use of tannery sludge ash as a partial or totally replacement of usual mineral filler such as CaCO 3 in manufacture of waterproofing membranes. The effects of sludge ash on the morphology and mechanical properties of membranes were investigated. Leaching tests were carried out in order to guarantee that the fulfillment of “filler function ” was done in respect with environmental criteria. The results in terms of performances and leaching tests indicate that tannery sludge ash could be used as total replacement of CaCO 3 for <b>waterproofing</b> membranes. This <b>work</b> has to be intended as the first step of a study whose final goal is to find an effective, industrially applicable, way to improve recycling capabilities of tannery {{effluent treatment}} plant sludge in systems like roofing and waterproofing membranes thus solving an economical and environmental problem...|$|R

The factory was begun {{in conjunction with a}} local foundation and provides skills and jobs for 'at risk women', generally women who would otherwise be involved in prostitution or illegal drug use.In addition to the socially ethical elements of the Páramo business model it has committed to minimising it's environmental impact, all of the products are designed to be robust and repairable to last a very long time. To this end there is a policy of not using fabrics like Nylon which is not as chemically stable as Polyester in the main construction of any waterproof garments. Because of the Nikwax technologies employed none of the cleaning or treatment products used to produce or maintain Páramo products are environmentally persistent or toxic. Páramo does not use any fluro-carbons, either as a DWR treatment or as a <b>waterproof</b> barrier.Páramo also <b>works</b> with The World Land Trust on conservation efforts and carbon offsetting of all aspects of its operations.|$|R
40|$|Proyecto de Graduación (Licenciatura en Ingeniería Ambiental) Instituto Tecnológico de Costa Rica, Escuela de Química, 2014. The Instituto Costarricense de Acueductos y Alcantarillados has a {{wastewater}} treatment plant for “Las Lomas” urbanization in Buenos Aires, Puntarenas. This plant is a single facultative pond which presents microalgae overproduction that generates {{a reduction in the}} effluent quality, causes operational problems and also does not comply with the national legislation. Therefore, current facultative pond was evaluated by major design parameters for facultative ponds, to recommend a potential solution for improvement to optimize the treatment of wastewater. Evaluation of the current facultative pond, based on average daily flow of 40 m 3 /day and 50 m 3 /day maximum daily, resulted in major problems, such as, L/A ratio, the surface loading rate and, most importantly, the detention time. Subsequently, the actual area required for treatment of this wastewater was calculated, based on the maximum daily flow, is 725 m 2. Then, different scenarios were evaluated in the same way. It was evaluated: two ponds in series (the first facultative and the second one a maturation pond); two ponds in series (the first facultative and the second a macrophyte pond) and three ponds (two facultative in parallel and one a maturation pond). Then, was calculated the approximate cost to implement these proposal (including all costs of removing sludge, lagoon <b>waterproofing,</b> structural <b>work,</b> mechanical installation and other indirect and additional costs), which resulted in required an investment of $ 78. 400, 00; $ 118. 300, 00 y $ 90. 100, 00 for the proposals 1, 2 and 3, respectively. When evaluating all alternatives from a technical, environmental and economic point of view, the proposal is recommended to upgrade the system by using two ponds in series (the first facultative and the second one a maturation pond) instead of the existing one.

40|$|Unbearable Lightness was {{a public}} artwork of 110 LED {{scrolling}} text boxes distributed throughout the canopy of a large, mature tree, located in a high traffic location in a major Brisbane Parkland. The work was a major commission for the Southbank Corporation Public Art Program and was exhibited during the three months around Christmas and New Year 2003. Each text module displayed individual LED scrolling messages developed during collaboration with locally based hypertext writer, Linda Carolli. Set {{during the time of}} the highly contentious Invasion of Iraq, the texts posed open questions around the themes of lightness, thinness and emptiness with the aim of promoting contentions of hope in a time of painful impotence for concerned citizens. [...] - The text modules were positioned in sympathy with the position of major constellations in the night sky at that time whilst the design alluded to Martin Luther’s original Christmas tree envisaged as a mixture of ‘stars’ seen via a tree. The tree was further outlined and highlighted with blue spotlights set within its crown. The project required the design, networking and ruggedisation of the <b>work’s</b> <b>waterproof</b> electronic modules – assisted by an electronic designer. These modules were later re-purposed into a range of other works and formats. [...] - Set within the context of major antiwar protests of that era, the project sought to foster private reflection amongst its viewers whilst also calling upon the power of their personal and collective imagining as a method for retaining positive and critical mindsets in the face of such painful social and political adversities. The work became a strong focus of attention within the park and generated nightly debate and enthusiastic spoken reading sessions. ...|$|R
