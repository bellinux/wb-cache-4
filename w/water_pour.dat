The living-family room and the kitchen-dining room in the east end of the house are large, laid out for frequent entertaining and family gatherings. The living room has a series of glass picture doors. The tin roof of the house extends beyond the porch. When it rains, it’s possible to sit on the patio and watch the <b>water</b> <b>pour</b> down without getting wet. Under a gravel border around the house, a concrete gutter channels the water into the cistern for irrigation. In hot weather, a terrace directly above the cistern is a little cooler than the surrounding area.|$|E
500|$|Though the {{maneuvers}} were otherwise unremarkable, {{they proved}} a valuable learning {{tool for the}} Americans, who got a chance not only to experience British methods, but the violent conditions of the North Sea, as well. As Admiral Rodman noted upon returning from the exercise, [...] "I have seen the largest battleships apparently sucked under until only the superstructures on the upper deck were visible when they would slowly rise from their submergence and the <b>water</b> <b>pour</b> off their decks as it might from some huge turtle... to the surface." ...|$|E

60|$|The fall tore a great {{hole in the}} vessel's side. Into {{this the}} <b>water</b> <b>poured</b> at once.|$|R
60|$|It {{took the}} colour out of Alan's face even {{to tell what}} followed. For there were still two men lying {{impotent}} in their bunks; and these, seeing the <b>water</b> <b>pour</b> in, and thinking the ship had foundered, began to cry out aloud, and that with such harrowing cries that all who were on deck tumbled one after another into the skiff and fell to their oars. They were not two hundred yards away, when there came a third great sea; and at that the brig lifted clean over the reef; her canvas filled for a moment, {{and she seemed to}} sail in chase of them, but settling all the while; and presently she drew down and down, as if a hand was drawing her; and the sea closed over the Covenant of Dysart.|$|E
60|$|The {{three men}} dropped the handles and ran {{at full speed}} towards the shore, while loud shouts to Dick to follow came from the crowd of men {{standing}} on the slope. But the boy grasped the handles, and with lips tightly closed, still toiled on. Slowly the bucket ascended, for Red George was a heavy man; then suddenly the weight slackened, and the handle went round faster. The shaft was filling, the water had reached the bucket, and had risen to Red George's neck, so that his weight was {{no longer on the}} rope. So fast did the <b>water</b> <b>pour</b> in, that it was not half a minute before the bucket reached the surface, and Red George sprang out. There was but time for one exclamation, and then the great wave struck them. Red George was whirled like a straw in the current; but he was a strong swimmer, and at a point where the valley widened out, half a mile lower, he struggled to shore.|$|E
5000|$|... ==Bigger lake== Lake Akdoğan (Akdoğan Gölü) is at [...] Its {{elevation}} {{with respect}} to sea level is 2149 m and its maximum depth is 21 m. Its surface area is about 11 km2 [...] It is fed by the snow from the mountains and its excess <b>water</b> <b>pour</b> to İskender creek.|$|E

50|$|In 1906, the St. John's River levee broke, and <b>water</b> <b>poured</b> into Visalia {{from the}} north, which helped cause the floods of 1906.|$|R
5000|$|Fuente (Fountain) de la Gran Vía {{in which}} royal figures with a {{connection}} to either Logroño or La Rioja are represented in bronze. Because the figures are placed looking towards the public and so large torrents of <b>water</b> <b>pour</b> down behind them, the fountain {{is commonly known as}} the one with [...] "wet backs".|$|E
50|$|On July 15, 1926, Connecticut Light and Power Company's {{board of}} {{directors}} approved a plan to create the first large-scale operation of pumped storage facilities in the US. By creating the lake and pumping it full {{of water from the}} Housatonic River, then letting the <b>water</b> <b>pour</b> down the penstock and into a turbine, the utility could produce electricity.|$|E
5000|$|... 1) Damaha Dhunga :- Damaha dhunga is {{naturally}} mysterious and amazing {{in its own}} way. Anyone who hit this stone with small one by offering flowers to it, water pours from it same like tears from eyes. According to Hindu mythology, if one plead a wish while offering flower to this stone, if drops of <b>water</b> <b>pour</b> from the stone, {{it is said that}} the wish you made gets fulfilled.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} earned its nickname {{because when}} it rains <b>water</b> <b>pours</b> over the woman's face on the facade, running down her cheeks like tears.|$|R

60|$|Mr. Raymond Greene seemed {{rather to}} resent having cold <b>water</b> <b>poured</b> upon his melodramatic imaginings. He turned to Elizabeth, who had {{remained}} silent during the brief colloquy.|$|R
50|$|The Rainbow-shaped Vasilashko Lake (Bulgarian: Дъговидното Василшко езеро) is {{situated}} in a separate small cirque under the Tipits Peak at 2,215 m. With depth of 10.4 m, it is second in the group and ninth in Pirin. It is not very large: its surface is only 10.9 decares (165x106 m). The lake has a shape of an irregular pentagonal, whose eastern side is curved as a rainbow. Its <b>water</b> <b>pour</b> into the Fish Lake under the ground.|$|E

60|$|Anyway, the <b>water</b> <b>poured</b> in {{at every}} seam. But {{not for a}} moment,--even with two miles of water {{between them and the}} steamer,--did the rowers pause for that.|$|R
60|$|It was no easy task. The {{schooner}} {{having lost}} {{part of her}} headway, tossed and pitched dreadfully, and once the <b>water</b> <b>poured</b> over me in a perfect deluge.|$|R
60|$|Sometimes a dam proves a {{very white}} {{elephant}} on their hands. The site {{is not well}} chosen, or the stream difficult, and the restrained <b>water</b> <b>pours</b> round the ends of their dam, cutting them away. They build the dam longer at once; but again the <b>water</b> <b>pours</b> round on its work of destruction. So they keep on building, an interminable structure, till the frosts come, and they must cut their wood and tumble their houses together in a desperate hurry to be ready when the ice closes over them.|$|R
50|$|Two fountains {{were the}} centerpieces of the Gardens of Versailles, both {{taken from the}} myths about Apollo, the sun god, the emblem of Louis XIV, and both symbolizing his power. The Fontaine Latone (1668-70) {{designed}} by André Le Nôtre and sculpted byGaspard and Balthazar Marsy, represents {{the story of how}} the peasants of Lycia tormented Latona and her children, Diana and Apollo, and were punished by being turned into frogs. This was a reminder of how French peasants had abused Louis's mother, Anne of Austria, during the uprising called the Fronde in the 1650s. When the fountain is turned on, sprays of <b>water</b> <b>pour</b> down on the peasants, who are frenzied as they are transformed into creatures.|$|E
50|$|They then notice water {{dripping}} {{from the ceiling}} pipe of a nearby room. To check the problem, the boy beagle brings a ladder and Oswald climbs. Thinking of it more fun to create mischief than to help his friend, however, the boy beagle kicks and knocks down the ladder. Thus Oswald grabs and hangs onto the ceiling pipe which is very brittle. As a result, the pipe breaks, and large quantities of <b>water</b> <b>pour</b> in and flood the house. The girl beagle was frightened by this and therefore takes shelter inside a grandfather clock. After the clock was submerged, she tries to come out but could {{not because of the}} enormous pressure exerted by the flood. Oswald then comes and tries to bail her out.|$|E
5000|$|If {{there is}} a hand washing basin provided, perform Temizu: take the dipper in your right hand and scoop up <b>water.</b> <b>Pour</b> some onto your left hand, then {{transfer}} the dipper to your left hand and pour some onto your right hand. Transfer the dipper to your right hand again, cup your left palm, and pour water into it, from which you will take the water into your mouth (never drink directly from the dipper), silently swish it around in your mouth (do not drink), then quietly spit it out into your cupped left hand (not into the reservoir). Then, holding {{the handle of the}} dipper in both hands, turn it vertically so that the remaining water washes over the handle. Then replace it where you found it.|$|E

50|$|The {{most famous}} fountains of the Renaissance, at the Villa d'Este in Tivoli, were {{located on a}} steep slope near a river; the {{builders}} ran a channel from the river to a large fountain at top of the garden, which then fed other fountains and basins on the levels below. The fountains of Rome, built from the Renaissance through the 18th century, took their water from rebuilt Roman aqueducts which brought water from lakes and rivers at a higher elevation than the fountains. Those fountains with a high source of water, such as the Triton Fountain, could shoot water 16 ft in air. Fountains with a lower source, such as the Trevi Fountain, could only have <b>water</b> <b>pour</b> downwards. The architect of the Trevi Fountain placed it below street level to make {{the flow of water}} seem more dramatic.|$|E
40|$|Abroad and in Russia {{there exist}} the {{practices}} of discharge of liquids, which maintain radionuclides in reservoirs. In order to ensure radiation protection of environment and population such discharge {{must be carried out}} under control. For carrying out of the control it is necessary to determine the value of acceptable discharge of radionuclides into reservoir with consideration of specific conditions and to supervise the actual value of discharge. The value of acceptable discharge of radionuclide into reservoir depends on such parameters as its volume and rate of the <b>water</b> <b>pour</b> off...|$|E
