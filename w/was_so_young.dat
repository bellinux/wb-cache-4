5|$|Cooper {{agreed to}} take on Weinstein, who decided to redevelop his Probe {{published}} short story into a script for the animated Star Trek. Cooper addressed the script to D.C. Fontana, who had recently left the show. When it arrived at the production office, it was forwarded to Fontana unread, who sent it back to Cooper as {{she had left the}} show. The script was subsequently resubmitted by Weinstein under his agent's name for the second season of the show. Producer Lou Scheimer contacted Weinstein and informed him that they wanted to purchase the script if the ending could be modified, which Weinstein agreed to. Weinstein was 19 at the time and staying in the dormitory at the University of Connecticut, and Scheimer was surprised to find out that Weinstein <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>young.</b>|$|E
25|$|Sportwereld <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>young</b> and {{so small}} for the big Ronde that we wanted. We had bitten off more than we could chew. It was hard, seeing a band of second-class riders riding across Flanders, {{scraping}} {{up a handful of}} centimes to help cover the costs. The same happened in 1914. No van Hauwaert, no Masselis, no Defraeye, no Mosson, no Mottiat, no Van Den Berghe, all forbidden to take part by their French bike companies.|$|E
500|$|Finding it {{difficult}} {{to keep up with}} both her schoolwork and her passion, she dropped out of Los Angeles High School in 1921 to pursue a full-time acting career. Reflecting on her decision, Wong told Motion Picture Magazine in 1931: [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>young</b> when I began that I knew I still had youth if I failed, so I determined to give myself 10years to succeed as an actress." ...|$|E

500|$|Historian Will Jacobs {{suggests}} the Silver Age ended in April 1970 {{when the man}} who had started it, Julius Schwartz, handed over Green Lantern — starring one of the first revived heroes of the era [...] — to the new-guard team of Denny O'Neil and Neal Adams in response to reduced sales. John Strausbaugh also connects the end of the Silver Age to Green Lantern. He observes that in 1960, the character embodied the can-do optimism of the era. [...] However, by 1972 Green Lantern had become world weary; [...] "Those days are gone – gone forever – the days I was confident, certain ... I <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>young</b> ... so sure I couldn't make a mistake! Young and cocky, that was Green Lantern. Well, I've changed. I'm older now ... maybe wiser, too ... and a lot less happy." [...] Strausbaugh writes that the Silver Age [...] "went out with that whimper." ...|$|E
500|$|With {{the release}} of Tool's {{follow-up}} single [...] "Prison Sex", the band again became the target of censorship. The song's lyrics and video dealt with child abuse, which sparked controversial reactions; Keenan's lyrics begin with: [...] "It {{took so long to}} remember just what happened. I <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>young</b> and vestal then, you know it hurt me, but I'm breathing so I guess I'm still alive ... I've got my hands bound and my head down and my eyes closed and my throat wide open." [...] The video was created primarily by guitarist Adam Jones, who saw it as his [...] "surrealistic interpretation" [...] of the subject matter. And while some contemporary journalists praised the video and described the lyrics as [...] "metaphoric", the American branch of MuchMusic asked Keenan to represent the band in a hearing. It deemed the music video too graphic and obscene, and MTV stopped airing it after a few showings.|$|E
2500|$|After Michael had {{sketched out}} his {{ideas for the}} shoot at {{a meeting with the}} {{production}} company and his brothers, Stein and producer John Diaz had a feeling he would skip the actual shoot, so they rented a wax dummy of Michael from Madame Tussaud's museum in Nashville. [...] " [...] was put through the wringer," [...] Stein says. [...] "Its head ended up in the salad bowl at lunch one day." [...] The dummy was ultimately used in three separate sequences, including the ending sequence that shows {{the rest of the group}} standing in a shot similar to the album cover. The television show PM Magazine later discovered the dummy had been used through a close analysis of the video. [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>young</b> and naïve, I just figured this is what they normally do in music videos," [...] recalls Paula Abdul, who eventually became the choreographer.|$|E
6000|$|... "But why can't it be, Fan? You <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>young,</b> {{and your}} {{feelings}} may change. And {{he is my}} brother--would you not like to have me for a sister?" ...|$|R
6000|$|O, {{it is for}} my true love [...] The woods their rich apparel wear-- [...] O, it is for my own true love, [...] That <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>young</b> and fair.|$|R

2500|$|She {{raised her}} three {{children}} with Birley at Pelham cottage. [...] Her eldest son Rupert, who was born on 20 August 1955, studied at Eton College and Christ Church, Oxford. [...] In 1986, he disappeared {{off the coast of}} Togo in West Africa, where he was presumed drowned. [...] "There really is nothing worse than losing a child – and there is something special about your first-born", she said, adding that, [...] "Because I <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>young</b> when Rupert was born ... we were more like good friends than mother and son." [...] Her second son Robin (b. 19 February 1958) is a businessman, whose face was disfigured as a child when he was mauled by a tigress at John Aspinall's private zoo. Having let him go near the pregnant tigress, Lady Annabel said, [...] "It was my own fault. I was, am, angry with myself." [...] Her first daughter India Jane (b. 14 January 1961), the granddaughter of society portrait painter Sir Oswald Birley, is an artist.|$|E
2500|$|The infanta was {{received}} at the Ducal Palace of Vila Viçosa {{at the beginning}} of May 1785, and on , the couple received a nuptial benediction at the palace chapel. At the same time, John's sister, the Infanta Mariana Victoria, was married to the Infante Gabriel, also of the Spanish royal family. An assiduous correspondence between John and Mariana at that time reveals that the absence of his sister weighed upon him and, comparing her to his young wife, he wrote, [...] "She is very smart and has a lot of judgment, whereas you have rather little, and I like her a lot, but for all that I cannot love her equally." [...] John's young bride was little given to docility, requiring at times the correction of Queen Maria herself. Furthermore, the difference in their ages (John being 18 years old) made him uncomfortable and anxious. Because Carlota <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>young,</b> the marriage had not been consummated, and John wrote, [...] "Here's to the arrival of the time when I shall play a lot with the Infanta. The way these things go, I think six years from now. Better that she be a bit more grown up than when she came." [...] The consummation waited until [...] In 1793, Carlota gave birth to the first of nine children: Teresa, Princess of Beira.|$|E

6000|$|... "I don't {{know how}} to begin what I want to say. I am not fit to advise any one. I <b>am</b> <b>so</b> <b>young,</b> and <b>so</b> very ignorant of the world." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Always with a smack of the dominie. Moreover, he <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>young.</b> I {{thought him}} as ancient as Dr. Lucas, and, behold, he is a brisk youth, without a grey hair." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, he is gone, Betty, but {{you must}} not be sad while you <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>young.</b> Wait until you are old like I am. How long have you known Lew Wetzel?" ...|$|R
60|$|LORETTA. [Still moaning.] Oh, why did I? [NED {{somewhat}} stiffens.] I <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>young.</b> I did {{not know}} the world then.|$|E
6000|$|At {{those times}} one doesn't think of justice. He <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>young,</b> so frank. Wouldn't {{it have been}} nobler to give your life for his? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Are {{you going}} to have a child?' he asked incredulous. It seemed, to look at her, impossible, she <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>young</b> and so far in spirit from any child-bearing.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{can call}} every one by name," [...] said Bo-Peep, confidently; [...] "for though I <b>am</b> <b>so</b> <b>young</b> a shepherdess I am fond of my sheep and {{know all about}} them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{you know}} we <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>young,</b> that now we have not her to judge for us, we must only do little things that we are quite sure of, or we shall get wrong." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. You see, Marian's {{position}} {{is a very}} difficult one. She <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>young</b> and <b>so</b> good looking that she is very much observed; and it seems so strange her being without her husband." ...|$|R
60|$|Leon. When love did of {{my heart}} {{possession}} take, I <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>young,</b> my soul was scarce awake: I cannot tell when first I thought you fair; But sucked in love, insensibly as air.|$|E
6000|$|LORETTA. Yes, of course, Billy. We {{were with}} each other so much [...] . If I had only known [...] . There {{was no one to}} tell me [...] . I <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>young</b> [...] . [Breaks down crying.] ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{might have}} done no such thing. I gave you my opinion. Elfride Swancourt may have loved you once, no doubt, but it was when she <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>young</b> that she hardly knew her own mind.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Paul Overt met her eyes, {{which had}} a cool morning-light that would have half-broken his heart if he hadn't <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>young.</b> [...] "Alas I don't know him. I only admire him at a distance." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{find him}} charming," [...] {{repeated}} Madame, [...] "though he <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>young,</b> which <b>is</b> a fault that will mend," [...] and she fixed her eyes upon her daughter's {{face with a}} look of interrogation.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! madame," [...] she sobbed, [...] "is it not cruel {{that one}} should die like this! I <b>am</b> <b>so</b> <b>young.</b> I have seen so little of life. It is not just, madame--it is not just!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How could I know he'd do that? I {{paid the}} captain a goodish lump o' tin {{to take him}} on a long voyage, and I thought he <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>young</b> that he'd forget the old place." ...|$|E
6000|$|I could {{scarcely}} share this view: holding desertion under arms for an unpardonable fault in honour. But for all I <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>young,</b> I was wiser than say my thought. [...] "Dear, dear," [...] says I, [...] "the punishment is death." ...|$|E
6000|$|Her tone went to Serviss's heart. She <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>young</b> {{to be so}} bitter; but {{he could}} think of nothing at the moment which would not add to her chagrin, for was not his own {{interpretation}} of her quite as hard to bear? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I cannot {{see why you}} <b>are</b> <b>so</b> fond of Lord Worthington," [...] said Alice. [...] "His manners are good; {{but there}} is nothing in him. Besides, he <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>young.</b> I cannot endure his conversation. He has begun to talk about Goodwood already." ...|$|R
6000|$|His name is George, {{generally}} speaking. [...] "Call me George!" [...] {{he says to}} the heroine. She {{calls him}} George (in a very low voice, because she <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>young</b> and timid). Then he is happy.|$|R
6000|$|... "You didn't {{think the}} winner <b>was</b> to <b>be</b> <b>so</b> <b>young,</b> I suppose, Aunt?" [...] said Arthur. [...] "Couldn't you find {{something}} else for this girl, and save that grim-looking gown {{for one of the}} older women?" ...|$|R
