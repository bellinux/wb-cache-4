25|$|Observations of {{homeotic}} mutations led to {{the formulation}} of the ABC model of flower development by E. Coen and E. Meyerowitz. According to this model, floral organ identity genes are divided into three classes: class A genes (<b>which</b> <b>affect</b> sepals and petals), class B genes (<b>which</b> <b>affect</b> petals and stamens), and class C genes (<b>which</b> <b>affect</b> stamens and carpels). These genes code for transcription factors that combine to cause tissue specification in their respective regions during development. Although developed through study of A. thaliana flowers, this model is generally applicable to other flowering plants.|$|R

5|$|Battles are turn-based {{and take}} place on grid-based maps. Victory is {{achieved}} when an enemy base is captured or all enemies are defeated.

5|$|Of these precepts, Mahavira is most {{remembered in}} the Indian traditions for his teachings of ahimsa (non-injury) {{as the supreme}} ethical and moral virtue. Mahavira taught that the {{doctrine}} of non-injury must cover all living beings, and causing injury to any being in any form creates bad karma <b>which</b> <b>affects</b> one's rebirth and future well-being and suffering. According to Mahatma Gandhi, Mahāvīra was the greatest authority on Ahimsa.|$|E

5|$|The P. rebeli {{developmental}} rate shows great {{phenotypic plasticity}} (changing its developmental rate {{in response to}} changes in the environment), as it develops very quickly in the lab and in the Pyrenees and Southern Alps.

5|$|The most {{important}} geographical {{factors that influence}} the climate of Argentina are latitude, elevation, and distance from the sea. With Argentina extending from 22oS to 55oS, {{there are differences in}} the amount of incoming solar radiation and the amount of daylight received in each season, <b>which</b> <b>affects</b> temperature. Thus, temperatures decrease from north to south due to the differences in latitudes.|$|E
5|$|A patient's genome {{may include}} an {{inherited}} or random mutation <b>which</b> <b>affects</b> {{the probability of}} developing a disease in the future. For example, Lynch syndrome is a genetic disease that predisposes patients to colorectal and other cancers; early detection can lead to close monitoring that improves the patient's chances of a good outcome. Cardiovascular risk is indicated by biological markers and screening can measure the risk that a child will be born with a genetic disease such as Cystic fibrosis. Genetic testing is ethically complex: patients may not want the stress of knowing their risk. In countries without universal healthcare, a known risk may raise insurance premiums.|$|E

5|$|After {{a period}} of time and under the {{appropriate}} environmental conditions, the dikaryotic mycelia may enter the reproductive stage of the life cycle. Fruit body formation is influenced by external factors such as season (<b>which</b> <b>affects</b> temperature and air humidity), nutrients and light. As fruit bodies develop they produce peridioles containing the basidia upon which new basidiospores are made. Young basidia contain a pair of haploid sexually compatible nuclei which fuse, and the resulting diploid fusion nucleus undergoes meiosis to produce basidiospores, each containing a single haploid nucleus. The dikaryotic mycelia from which the fruit bodies are produced is long lasting, and will continue to produce successive generations of fruit bodies as long as the environmental conditions are favorable.|$|E
5|$|Ever 17 is {{a visual}} novel {{in which the}} player reads the game's story.

The whole plot is not revealed in just one ending; instead, the player has to play through the game multiple times, with each playthrough revealing new information. After playing through the game once, the player is able to fast-forward past text to decision points; they can also choose to start from a point further into the game, so {{that they do not have}} to go back to the beginning of the game for each playthrough.|$|E
5|$|In Age of Empires III: The Asian Dynasties, {{the three}} new civilizations must build a Wonder to advance from age to age, instead of {{advancing}} from the Town Center. Unlike previous Age of Empires games, the player does not achieve victory {{by building a}} wonder. Players can choose from a selection of wonders, each having benefits unique to their civilization. Once built, this wonder provides an initial bonus of units or resources, while continuing to provide a benefit to the player's civilization. This initial bonus becomes larger, depending on which age is being advanced to. Since the wonder is a building, players can assign different numbers of villagers to build it, <b>which</b> <b>affects</b> the speed of advancement. Wonders that are destroyed cannot be rebuilt.|$|E

These genes are expressed in certain regions of the developing flower and are responsible for development of organs in those regions. Agamous is a C class gene, a transcription factor responsible for activating genes involved in stamen and carpel development.|$|R
5|$|In the remakes, after {{selecting}} a character, the player {{can change the}} character's starting abilities with five magical seeds, given at the tavern. Also, each character has a personality trait <b>which</b> <b>affects</b> {{the growth rate of}} their abilities. The Hero's personality is determined by the player's choices and actions during a dream sequence {{at the start of the}} game, while other characters' personalities are determined by their status at the end of the character generation process. Most personalities are available to both male and female characters, while a few are exclusive to male or female characters. A character's personality can be temporarily changed by equipping certain accessories, or permanently changed by using certain consumable books.|$|E
