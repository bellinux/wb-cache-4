50|$|The <b>white-collared</b> <b>swift</b> (Streptoprocne zonaris) is a {{resident}} breeding bird from central Mexico, the Greater Antilles and Trinidad south to Peru, northern Argentina and southeastern Brazil.|$|E
50|$|The white-naped swift is huge for a swift, {{measuring}} 20.5 - 25 cm long, being some 20% {{larger than}} its more common {{and much more}} widespread cousin, the <b>white-collared</b> <b>swift.</b> Weight in the species can vary from 115 to 225 g with a reported average weight of 175 g. The adults are brown-black, glossed blue on the back, and have a white crescent on the nape. The tail is fairly squared off, but can be held in a minorly notched way when flying. The more widespread <b>white-collared</b> <b>swift</b> is similar, sometimes measuring nearly as large. The white-collar, however, has a complete white collar (whereas the White-nape has no white on the underside) and has a strongly notched tail.|$|E
50|$|<b>White-collared</b> <b>swift</b> is {{a massive}} and {{powerful}} species, 20 - 22 cm long, and weighing 90 - 125 g. It is the largest species of swift in its range exceed in southwestern Mexico, where it may co-exist with its slightly larger cousin, the white-naped swift, {{which is one of}} the two largest swifts in the world. The <b>white-collared</b> <b>swift</b> has a wingspan of 45 to 55 cm. It has a very slightly forked tail, which often appears square. The adults are black, glossed blue on the back, and have a white collar, broader and duller on the breast than the hindneck. Young birds are duller than adults, and the collar is reduced or absent.|$|E
50|$|The cave's Spanish name Sótano de las Golondrinas means Basement of the Swallows, {{owing to}} the many birds which live in holes on the cave walls. These are mostly <b>white-collared</b> <b>swifts</b> (vencejos in Spanish) and green parakeets (periquillo quila), but actual {{swallows}} are in fact rarely found here.|$|R
5000|$|This is {{a highly}} gregarious species, with flocks of 100 or more birds, and often in company with other swift species. It has a powerful, fast and direct flight, and will ascend {{thermals}} to great heights. <b>White-collared</b> <b>swifts</b> are known to attain or exceed flying speeds of 70 to 100 kph mph despite their relatively large size. This noisy swift has a screeching chee-yar! call, which may be given in chorus by a flock. A flock will also make a [...] "wooshing" [...] sound as their wings beat against the wind.|$|R
50|$|Wei-Assipu-tepui has {{a maximum}} {{elevation}} of around 2400 m. Its summit plateau is highly dissected and generally inclined south-southwest (towards the Brazilian side). The rocky summit is partially forested, with flowering plants {{of the genus}} Bonnetia featuring prominently. It also hosts a number of carnivorous plants, including Heliamphora glabra, Heliamphora nutans, and the natural hybrid between the two. The various rock cavities of Wei-Assipu-tepui are home to nesting colonies of <b>white-collared</b> <b>swifts</b> (Streptoprocne zonaris) and oilbirds (Steatornis caripensis). For the latter species, Wei-Assipu-tepui is the easternmost recorded locality in mainland South America, and the first known nesting site in Brazil. The mountain's summit supports {{a greater variety of}} herpetofauna than the less vegetated plateaus of nearby Roraima-tepui, Kukenán-tepui, Yuruaní-tepui, and Ilú-tepui. Day temperatures of 17 °C have been recorded on the summit plateau, falling to 12 °C overnight, with slightly lower values in the more sheltered caves.|$|R
50|$|Migratory {{bird species}} include swallow-tailed kite (Elanoides forficatus), plumbeous kite (Ictinia plumbea), blue ground dove (Claravis pretiosa), dark-billed cuckoo (Coccyzus melacoryphus), <b>white-collared</b> <b>swift</b> (Streptoprocne zonaris), Sick's swift (Chaetura meridionalis), black jacobin (Florisuga fusca), black-throated mango (Anthracothorax nigricollis), white-rumped monjita (Xolmis velatus), yellow-browed tyrant (Satrapa icterophrys), rusty-margined flycatcher (Myiozetetes cayanensis), {{streaked}} flycatcher (Myiodynastes maculatus), piratic flycatcher (Legatus leucophaius), fork-tailed flycatcher (Tyrannus savana), white-winged becard (Pachyramphus polychopterus), red-eyed vireo (Vireo olivaceus), lined seedeater (Sporophila lineola) and sooty grassquit (Tiaris fuliginosus).|$|E
5000|$|The lesser violetear {{belongs to}} the order Apodiformes. Hummingbirds share this order with the swifts, such as the <b>white-collared</b> <b>swift.</b> The name Apodiformes {{is derived from the}} Greek words [...] "a pous," [...] meaning [...] "without foot." [...] While apodiforms do in fact have feet, they are quite small and their legs are short and {{relatively}} weak. Many birds in this order cannot walk, and thus rarely if ever land on the ground since quick escape from predators is virtually impossible. For this reason members of this order spend a majority of their time in the air.|$|E
50|$|<b>White-collared</b> <b>swift</b> feeds {{in flight}} on flying insects, {{including}} beetles, bees and flying ants. This species breeds in April to May, {{early in the}} wet season to correspond with a peak number of insect prey, building a cup nest out of mud, moss and reguritated, grounded insect parts (the same matter that is later fed to the nestlings), each nest measuring 120 - 170 mm in diameter with a depths of 30 - 90 mm. Nests are located on ledges and nooks along the cave walls. Two eggs are laid and the nesting stage ends when young become independent of their parents at 45-55 days. In Mexico, their only verified predators are Virginia opossums, which raid and eat the young in nests, and peregrine falcons, which are known to wait near colony entrances to pick off birds as they first fly off.|$|E
40|$|Descriptions and {{illustrations}} {{are given}} for three {{new species of}} the chewing louse genus Dennyus on Brazilian Swifts. They and their type hosts are: D. pichorimi ex Streptoprocne biscutata seridoensis (Biscutate Swift) from the State of Rio Grande do Norte, D. pascoliae ex Streptoprocne zonaris zonaris (<b>White-collared</b> <b>Swift)</b> {{from the state of}} Minas Gerais, D. malagonensis ex Cypseloides senex (Great Dusky Swift) also from Minas Gerais. Thes e lice are the first published records of Dennyus species from Brazil. A key for the identificatio n of the Dennyus subgenera, and a table listing species of Dennyus recorded in other countrie s from hosts occurring in Brazil are given...|$|E
