5|$|The Navy's {{experience}} in this war <b>was</b> <b>encouraging</b> in that it had won but also cautionary in that the enemy {{had one of the}} weakest of the world's modern fleets. Also, the Manila Bay attack was extremely risky in which the American ships could have incurred severe damage or run out of supplies, as they were 7,000 miles from the nearest American harbor. That would {{have a profound effect on}} Navy strategy and American foreign policy for next several decades.|$|E
5|$|At {{the first}} {{race of the}} season in Melbourne, Webber {{qualified}} in 7th place and held that position for {{the early part of the}} race, managing to finish in 13th position after the RB3 suffered from a throttle-related malfunction and a jammed fuel flap. At the , he again out-qualified his more experienced teammate Coulthard and finished tenth, which <b>was</b> <b>encouraging</b> for the team in such a new and radical car. Bahrain was also going well for both drivers, who were running in sixth and seventh positions, until both cars retired due to mechanical malfunctions.

5|$|Myers {{was already}} {{concerned}} in 1891 that Europe {{was much more}} advanced in balloon technology than the United States. He sent a letter of concern to the national newspapers claiming that {{if any of the}} European military powers wanted to they could annihilate New York City or any major city in northeastern United States. Newspapers printed his concerns that the next big war would be fought in the sky. Myers pointed out that Germany, France, England, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Russia, Italy and China all had aeronautical apparatus, schools of practice, and secret experimental construction plants making state-of-the-art propeller power driven airships for war. He pointed out as early as October 1890 Commandant Charles Renard was in possession of a motor that could drive La France dirigible airship twenty-eight miles an hour and such an airship or a war airship twice that size traveling at forty-five miles an hour could totally destroy any major city in America without difficulty because of its speed. He <b>was</b> <b>encouraging</b> the government to recognize this and to prepare properly against this potential threat.|$|E
