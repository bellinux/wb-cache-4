5|$|The Navy's {{experience}} in this war <b>was</b> <b>encouraging</b> in that it had won but also cautionary in that the enemy {{had one of the}} weakest of the world's modern fleets. Also, the Manila Bay attack was extremely risky in which the American ships could have incurred severe damage or run out of supplies, as they were 7,000 miles from the nearest American harbor. That would {{have a profound effect on}} Navy strategy and American foreign policy for next several decades.|$|E

At the , he again out-qualified his more experienced teammate Coulthard and finished tenth, which <b>was</b> <b>encouraging</b> for the team in such a new and radical car.

5|$|Myers {{was already}} {{concerned}} in 1891 that Europe {{was much more}} advanced in balloon technology than the United States.

He <b>was</b> <b>encouraging</b> the government to recognize this and to prepare properly against this potential threat.|$|E
