25|$|From the 16th century, all pencils {{were made}} with leads of English natural graphite, but modern pencil lead is most {{commonly}} a mix of powdered graphite and clay; it was invented by Nicolas-Jacques Conté in 1795. It is chemically unrelated to the metal lead, whose ores had a similar appearance, hence {{the continuation of the}} name. Plumbago is another older term for natural graphite used for drawing, typically as a lump of the mineral without a <b>wood</b> <b>casing.</b> The term plumbago drawing is normally restricted to 17th and 18th century works, mostly portraits.|$|E
500|$|Tipu's Tiger or Tippu's Tiger is an {{eighteenth-century}} automaton or mechanical toy {{created for}} Tipu Sultan, the [...] {{ruler of the}} Kingdom of Mysore in India. The carved and painted <b>wood</b> <b>casing</b> represents a tiger savaging a near life-size European man. Mechanisms inside the tiger and man's bodies make one hand of the man move, emit a wailing sound from his mouth and grunts from the tiger. In addition a flap {{on the side of}} the tiger folds down to reveal the keyboard of a small pipe organ with 18 notes.|$|E
50|$|He {{was buried}} with Elizabeth of York under their effigies in his chapel. Her tomb was {{opened in the}} 19th century. The <b>wood</b> <b>casing</b> of her lead coffin {{was found to have}} been removed to create space for the interment of her great-great-grandson James VI and I.|$|E
5000|$|... 1930 - During {{the year}} 1929, work was begun on an {{addition}} to Lee High School. This addition consists of twelve rooms, {{one of which is}} {{to be used as a}} junior high assembly. The high school session room will not be crowded now, since the junior high will have its own room. The new addition is built entirely of non-inflammable material except <b>wood</b> <b>casings</b> and furniture. A new Chemistry Laboratory was built over the old lunch room, now the new office. All equipment in the laboratory is of the latest type. This room will accommodate a very large class, even larger than the Chemistry class of 1930.|$|R
50|$|The {{founder of}} the factory at this site was Ebenezer Wood (1792-1880). Wood brought several {{innovations}} to pencil manufacturing, {{such as the use}} of the circular saw and octagonal and hexagonal forms for <b>wood</b> pencil <b>casings.</b> The hexagonal form has since become common for pencils.|$|R
50|$|The {{storage shed}} is a ca. 1900 small frame building, {{approximately}} eight feet wide by twelve feet deep, facing east {{with a single}} vertical wood plank door {{in the center and}} simple straight stock <b>wood</b> <b>casings</b> on the east facade. The building rests on a concrete block foundation, having been relocated to this site {{from the center of the}} cemetery near the pump. The shed is covered with narrow wood clapboard siding and wood corner boards. A single four-pane fixed wood window is located on the north and south facades also with simple straight stock casings; there are no openings on the west facade. The building has a gable roof, with the gable facing east, made of asphalt shingles. There is a vent pipe on the north half of the roof. The shed is in good condition.|$|R

5000|$|There {{were three}} [...] "revisions" [...] of the Prophet-5 between 1978 and 1984. The first, Revision 1, {{is the least}} common, with 182 units having been produced. Revision 1 Prophet-5s were {{primarily}} hand-assembled by Smith and Bowen, and housed in a koa <b>wood</b> <b>casing.</b> Revision 2, which was mass-produced in quantities over 1,000, saw the addition of cassette patch storage (with a memory of up to 40 patches) and a walnut casing. By Revision 3.3, the memory storage had expanded to 120 patches. However, Revision 3 also introduced new circuitry that increased the stability but decreased {{the warmth of the}} Prophet-5. Revision 3 is the most common version. Inclusive of all revisions, approximately 6,000 units were produced.|$|E
5000|$|The {{configuration}} {{is a small}} rectangular, two-story {{box with}} a flat roof. An early addition was created on {{the northwest corner of}} the house. Materials chosen for the construction of the home are contextual with the landscape. The house's lower level walls are composed of dark brown colored bricks. [...] This forms a [...] "base" [...] on which the main level appears to float. The main level is covered with redwood heartwood siding, installed vertically and stained to mimic weathered driftwood. There are large sections of glass windows and doors. The windows and doors have thin metal sashes and <b>wood</b> <b>casings.</b> A tall trim board separates the lower level from the main level between the brick walls and wood siding. The roof appears like a flat plane. The roof is supported by wood rafters spaced 10 ft on center. The rafters continue through the tops of the walls and support wide overhanging eaves. The owners used the roof as a roof-top deck for viewing the lake.|$|R
50|$|By the 1870s the oyster, green turtle, {{and fishing}} {{industries}} had also grown on the island. By the 1890s lumber production {{was making a}} profit of almost $900,000, and the Faber Mill alone produced <b>wood</b> for <b>casing</b> {{more than a third}} of a million pencils. The town grew as well, and by 1895 there were more than 50 households back living on the island.|$|R
5000|$|Little Mac {{has been}} {{featured}} {{in a number of}} merchandise items and collectibles. As part of a [...] "boxing challenge" [...] held by Nintendo at its Nintendo World store in Rockefeller Plaza, Nintendo awarded, in part, a training sweatshirt similar to Little Mac's. Nintendo also released a pair of Little Mac-signed green boxing gloves on Amazon.com, which were contained in a <b>wood</b> frame and <b>casing.</b> The band [...] "Game Over" [...] created a song called 'Little Mac's Confession', which follows Little Mac's [...] "crushing KO" [...] against Mr. Dream.|$|R
50|$|Manufacturers who mass-produce wood {{products}} use automated spray systems, {{allowing them to}} paint materials {{at a very high}} rate with a minimum of personnel. Automated spray systems usually incorporate a paint-saving system which recovers paint not applied to the products. Commonly, linear spray systems are for products which are lying flat on a conveyor belt and then fed into a linear spray system, where automated spray guns are stationed above. When the material is directly below the guns, the guns begin to paint the material. Materials consist of lineal parts usually less than 12 in wide, such as window frames, <b>wood</b> moulding, baseboard, <b>casing,</b> trim stock and any other material that is simple in design. These machines are commonly used to apply stain, sealer, and lacquer. They can apply water- or solvent-based coatings. In recent years ultraviolet-cured coatings have become commonplace in profile finishing, and there are machines particularly suited to this type of coating.|$|R
5000|$|The University of Pittsburgh {{acquired}} the former Masonic Temple on December 23, 1993 for $8.5 million ($ in [...] dollars). [...] A two-year, $16 million ($ in [...] dollars) {{renovation of the}} structure and its adaptation {{for use by the}} University departments began in November 1998 and was completed in February 2000. During the initial design process, a study was performed to evaluate the architectural and historic significance of each major area of the building. As a result, four main lobbies, the ballroom and three main entrances, and portions of several two-story spaces on the third and fifth floors were kept and restored. Special attention was given to restore the Masonic Temple’s original historic condition. As such, approximately 95% of the existing historical light fixtures were rewired, retrofitted with energy-efficient lamps, refinished, and rehung in their original locations. Nearly all of the original <b>wood</b> doors, window <b>casings</b> and baseboards were refinished and reinstalled. Five new automatic elevators were installed and original bronze and stainless steel cabs were retrofitted to two of the new elevator platforms. Approximately 100 original bronze door hardware sets were modified to ADA compliance, refinished and reinstalled. One thousand square feet of marble flooring originally from Pennsylvania Hall (the previous home of Pitt’s medical school since torn down) was utilized in vestibules, corridors, elevator lobbies and cabs. Marble from the Masonic Temple’s original marble restroom stalls was also recycled for use in these areas. The building was decorated and furnished in a color scheme of primarily blues, mauves and burgundy to complement the mahogany woodwork.|$|R
