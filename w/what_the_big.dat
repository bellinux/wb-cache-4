500|$|On April 12, 1995, {{two weeks}} after Selena's death, George W. Bush, {{governor}} of Texas at the time, declared her birthday, April 16, Selena Day in the state. He said Selena represented [...] "the essence of south Texas culture." [...] Some European Americans in Texas wrote {{to the editor of}} the Brazosport Facts during April and May, asking <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> deal was; some were offended that Selena Day fell on Easter Sunday. Others said, [...] "Easter is more important than Selena Day", and that they believed people should let Selena rest in peace and continue with their lives. Mexican Americans in Texas wrote vociferously to the newspaper. Some said others were too critical of Selena Day, and should not have responded so rudely.|$|E
500|$|Early {{practice}} speeds approached [...] NASCAR had mandated {{before the}} qualifier that {{the holes in}} the cars' restrictor plates be reduced by , later conceding that the rule may have affected some teams more than others. According to Gilliland, [...] "They threw a curveball at us this morning with the restrictor plate and (engine builder) Doug Yates wasn't worried at all. He put the super-tune on it and the thing ran great." [...] Earnhardt called the reduction in speed unnecessary: [...] "The track is safe... I don't feel (the late change in plate size) is a very fair situation for everybody. Once you're up around the 190s, what's two miles an hour? I don't see <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> deal is. The speed average is up because the corner speed remains better with the new asphalt. As far as running in a straight line, we're no faster than we've always run here." [...] Despite the mandated change, NASCAR did not schedule an additional practice session.|$|E
500|$|J. Edawrd Keyes of Newsday {{said that}} {{producers}} {{were able to}} deliver a concert [...] "that was the visual and sonic equivalent of washing down a pound of sugar with 27 cans of soda." [...] Keyes added that, despite Cyrus' charisma, it was evident the show and the dual-persona arrangement (considering {{that there were no}} major divergences between them) was an evident strategy to extend marketing and receive more profits. Peter Hartlaub of the San Francisco Chronicle believed Cyrus was a fair singer and commented, [...] "It was relatively wholesome, musically tolerable and certainly had plenty of production value. Some adults may have walked away wondering <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> fuss was about, but none of the kids looked the least bit disappointed." [...] Jane Stevenson of the Canadian Online Explorer noted the differences between Hannah Montana and Cyrus, stating that Cyrus was the [...] "marginally tougher cookie of the two singers" [...] and that audiences received two concerts for the price of one. An uncredited review from The Palm Beach Post stated, [...] "Both halves [...] were enjoyable and lively, set apart by Cyrus’ preternaturally assured stage presence, {{in and out of the}} wig." [...] It also stated that the Hannah Montana set was more satisfying due to the quality of the songs and more energy. Geoff Edgers of The Boston Globe wrote, [...] "Of course, most of the mainly tweener fans in the arena weren't splitting [...] musical hairs. They ate up the spectacle of the show, with its costume changes, giant video screens, and sparklers." ...|$|E

2500|$|Jim Parsons' {{portrayal}} of Sheldon has received widespread acclaim, {{and is often}} cited as {{the main reason for}} the program's success by critics and fans alike. James Chamberlin of IGN wrote: [...] "It's hard to imagine <b>what</b> <b>The</b> <b>Big</b> Bang Theory would be if it weren't for Jim Parsons' great {{portrayal of}} Sheldon Cooper".

2500|$|There is {{skepticism}} that core self-evaluations contribute any {{predictive value}} above <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> Five personality traits – agreeableness, conscientiousness, extraversion, neuroticism, openness) – {{are able to}} predict. [...] Some argue that trait indicators of core self-evaluations {{are the same as}} various conceptualizations of the neuroticism component of the Big Five. [...] Although it is true that some definitions of neuroticism include all four CSE traits, the Big Five does not refer explicitly to self-esteem in the description of neuroticism, nor is self-esteem one of the facets of neuroticism in their model. [...] Therefore, the conceptualization of neuroticism in the Big Five is more narrow than in core self-evaluations. [...] Additionally, no existing neuroticism scales measure self-esteem. [...] Furthermore, measures of neuroticism include only descriptive questions and do not contain an evaluative component.|$|E

2500|$|The first {{models with}} Abernethy’s {{corporate}} strategy [...] "in the business world's toughest race — the grinding contest against the Big Three automobile makers" [...] were the cars introduced for the 1965 model year. They were called the [...] "Sensible Spectaculars," [...] {{with the new}} Ambassador billed as [...] "a whole new horizon in size, style, stunning performance" [...] for 1965. The 1965 models were a major makeover of the completely new platform that had just been introduced in 1963. American Motors' new cars included the stretched and more luxurious Ambassadors, {{as well as new}} convertibles for the large models. New styling, the more powerful engines, as well as numerous comfort and sports-type options were now emphasized. Abernethy even switched the automaker's advertising agency to promote [...] "a better luxury and sports car image". However, Abernethy had his critics, who contended that AMC [...] "had its great success when it was doing <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> Three weren't doing".|$|E
2500|$|Rowan Moore of The Guardian {{questioned}} if it {{was going}} to be anything more than a folly, or whether it would be as eloquent as the Statue of Liberty. He speculated that the project might mark the time when society stops using large iconic projects as a tool for lifting areas out of deprivation. He questioned its ability to draw people's attention to Stratford after the Games, in a similar manner to the successes of the Angel of the North or the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao. He also questioned the piece's ability to strike a chord like the Angel, which he believed had at least [...] "created a feelgood factor and sense of pride" [...] in Gateshead, or whether it would simply become one of the [...] "many more unloved rotting wrecks that no one has the nerve to demolish". He postulated that the addition of stairs and a lift made Orbit less succinct than Kapoor's previous successful works, while ultimately he said [...] "hard to see <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> idea is, beyond the idea of making something big".|$|E
2500|$|Dickson {{found another}} usage, {{referring}} to a high foul ball that travels a great distance, usually behind home plate. In Stephen King's 1980 short story [...] "The Monkey", anthologized five years later in Skeleton Crew, the protagonists' father recalls days watching sandlot games during his own childhood, when he [...] "was too small to play, but he sat far out in foul territory sucking his blueberry Popsicle and chasing <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> kids called 'Chinese home runs'". Dickson wrote to King, who told him two years later that he had first heard the term when learning to play baseball in his own childhood, {{during a time when}} he lived, briefly, in Stratford, Connecticut. After he returned to his native Maine in 1958, the same year the Giants and Dodgers moved west, he recalled hearing it again. [...] "In both cases", he told Dickson, [...] "a Chinese home run was a foul ball, usually over the backstop". Dickson concluded from his correspondence that that use may well be limited to New England. All three definitions submitted to the online Urban Dictionary in the early 21st century are in accord with this usage.|$|E

It was a brown post, stout and agreeable; the smooth leg of it held the sunlight, while its neck, grooved by hitching-straps, tickled one's fingers. Carol had never been awake to the earth except as a show of changing color and great satisfying masses; she had lived in people and in ideas about having ideas; but Hugh's questions made her attentive to the comedies of sparrows, robins, blue jays, yellowhammers; she regained her pleasure in the arching flight of swallows, and added to it a solicitude about their nests and family squabbles.|$|E
60|$|It is {{impossible}} to restrain a note of sharp urgency from what one {{has to say about}} these developments. The Tanks remove the last technical difficulties in our way to decisive victory and a permanent peace; they also afford a reason for straining every nerve to bring about a decision and peace soon. At the risk of seeming an imaginative alarmist I would like to point out the reasons these things disclose for hurrying this war to a decision and doing our utmost to arrange the world's affairs so as to make another war improbable. Already these serio-comic Tanks, weighing something over twenty tons or so, have gone slithering around and sliding over dead and wounded men.
