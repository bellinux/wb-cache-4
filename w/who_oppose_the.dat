5|$|Brenton came up {{with the}} idea to show an episode dealing with a Muslim hero set out to stop a group of Islamic terrorists. Brenton and the {{producers}} researched elements of Islam in order to provide a balanced view towards the religion, as well as the nature of the plot and to show Muslims in the episode <b>who</b> <b>oppose</b> <b>the</b> extremists among their religion. Although much of the episode was set in Birmingham, it was filmed entirely in London. The episode sees the introduction of regular character Ruth Evershed (Nicola Walker), and the return of Christine Dale (Megan Dodds), who first appeared in the first episode and returned so that the character's role can be expanded.|$|E

She convinces Cloud to join the group to keep a closer eye on him after noticing his personality has changed, and she follows him in pursuit of the game's antagonist, Sephiroth. Unable to keep him from being manipulated by Sephiroth, she helps him recover after his mind becomes fractured, and they realise their mutual feelings for one another, working together to defeat Sephiroth.|$|E

25|$|The town can {{be roughly}} {{divided into three}} geographies: the village has a small-town atmosphere, much of Route 20A is heavily commercialized, and the {{majority}} of the town's area is farmland. One of the main issues faced by the community today is urban sprawl. The increasing presence of big-box stores on Route 20A has been welcomed by some residents, who appreciate the convenience of nearby retailers, and discouraged by others, <b>who</b> <b>oppose</b> <b>the</b> suburbanization of the small town.|$|E
25|$|Proponents {{and opponents}} have been both criticized for overstating the {{benefits}} or overstating the risks, and understating the other, respectively.

Researchers <b>who</b> <b>oppose</b> <b>the</b> practice state this as well. According to a 2013 Congressional Research Service report on fluoride in drinking water, these gaps in the fluoridation scientific literature fuel the controversy.|$|E

25|$|Following the , for {{the next}} half {{millennium}} Berber Ifriqiya enjoyed self-rule (1048−1574). The Fatimids were Shi'a, specifically of the more controversial Isma'ili branch. They originated in Islamic lands far to the east. Today, and for many centuries, the majority of Tunisians identify as Sunni (also from the east, but <b>who</b> <b>oppose</b> <b>the</b> Shi'a). In Ifriqiyah, {{at the time of}} the Fatimids, there was disdain for any rule from the east regardless if it was Sunni or Shi'a. Hence the rise in medieval Tunisia (Ifriqiya) of regimes not beholden to the east (al-Mashriq), which marks a new and a popular era of Berber sovereignty.|$|E
25|$|Those <b>who</b> <b>oppose</b> <b>the</b> posting of the {{ten commandments}} on public {{property}} argue that it violates the establishment clause of the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. In contrast, groups like the Fraternal Order of Eagles who support the public display {{of the ten}} commandments claim that the commandments are not necessarily religious but represent the moral and legal foundation of society, and are appropriate to be displayed as a historical source of present-day legal codes. Also, some argue like Judge Roy Moore that prohibiting the public practice of religion {{is a violation of}} the first amendment's guarantee of freedom of religion.|$|E
25|$|Supporters of {{the bombings}} {{generally}} assert that they caused the Japanese surrender, preventing massive casualties {{on both sides}} in the planned invasion of Japan: Kyūshū was to be invaded in October 1945 and Honshū five months later. It was thought Japan would not surrender unless there was an overwhelming demonstration of destructive capability. Those <b>who</b> <b>oppose</b> <b>the</b> bombings argue it was militarily unnecessary, inherently immoral, a war crime, or a form of state terrorism. Critics believe a naval blockade and conventional bombings would have forced Japan to surrender unconditionally. Some critics believe Japan was more motivated to surrender by the Soviet Union's invasion of Manchuria and other Japanese-held areas.|$|E

25|$|There is a {{small amount}} of middle ground between those who term the events a coup and those who call them a constitutionally-sound {{succession}} of power. On the one hand, several supporters of Zelaya's removal, including Acting Honduran President Roberto Micheletti and the top army lawyer, have admitted that sending Zelaya out of the country was illegal, although they argue it was justified by the need to prevent violence. Micheletti said forcing deposed President Manuel Zelaya to leave the country, instead of arresting him, was a mistake. On the other hand, a fraction of those <b>who</b> <b>oppose</b> <b>the</b> events consider the arrest warrant against Zelaya to be legal, although they say he was denied a fair trial.|$|E

Thus, the session starting on 1 September was moved to the Brussels hemicycle. Parliament was expected to move back to Strasbourg for the session starting on 22 September but had to remain in Brussels for that session as well as safety inspections dragged on. The event was greeted with joy by those <b>who</b> <b>oppose</b> <b>the</b> Parliament's presence in Strasbourg, and mocked by eurosceptics who wore hard hats to the first plenary in Brussels after the incident (if Parliament had been sitting at the time, the collapsing ceiling would have hit members of the eurosceptic parties).|$|E

These include the Birmingham Six (cleared in 1991 of planting an IRA bomb which killed 21 people in 1974), the Guildford Four (cleared in 1989 of murdering five people in another 1974 IRA bombing), Stephen Downing (a Derbyshire man who was freed in 2001 after serving 27 years for the murder of a woman in a churchyard) and Barry George (who was freed in 2007 when his conviction for the 1999 murder of TV presenter Jill Dando was quashed on appeal).|$|E
