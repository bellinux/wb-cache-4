500|$|The episode's {{opening scene}} depicts a fire fight during the Gulf War. This sequence, which took {{two days to}} film, was shot on a dry expanse of land located an hour outside of Los Angeles. This area had been {{selected}} due to its resembles to an Iraqi desert. Series' co-executive producer Michelle MacLaren said: [...] "We [...] were {{way out in the}} desert and <b>we</b> <b>drove</b> around this corner of these hills and I felt like we had entered another country. It was so desolate, and there were these stone buildings that looked like a bomb had gone off in them. It was perfect." [...] To add authenticity to the shoot, several of the extras used during this scene were former US military personnel.|$|E
500|$|I {{remember}} {{not just}} because it was a win, but also because it was a big fight right into the last night. Fabrizia reminded me the other night that we had a problem with the brake pads, so we lost a lot of time. We finished three days rallying (with one day to go), night and day, 32 seconds in front of Ari Vatanen. <b>We</b> <b>drove</b> the last special stage for the night, came back to the hotel and I could not sleep at all, four hours {{in front of me and}} no sleep. Then I arrive at the special stage, it's about 42km long, and I look at Fabrizia and I said [...] "OK, we forget everything, and we are at the first stage of the rally again, because one of us will crash." [...] And so Ari hit a rock, and we won the rally.|$|E
500|$|In [...] "The Quarterback", Rachel is devastated {{with the}} loss of Finn. Michele, who in real life was dating Cory Monteith, had asked to {{postpone}} this episode until everyone was ready. Rachel doesn't appear in this episode until the very end where she states, [...] "Before Finn, I used to sing alone, {{this was one of the}} songs we would sing when <b>we</b> <b>drove</b> around together." [...] She sings [...] "Make You Feel My Love". Later in the episode, she states that Finn was her person and that they were always going to be together. Later in the season, it is revealed that she got a tattoo of Finn's name (despite telling Kurt that she chickened out when they went to the tattoo shop). Rachel hires Santana to be her publicist, which leads her to take on a charitable cause with a local rescue kennel. She performs with Mercedes and Santana on stage for the benefit, Broadway Bitches, but the publicity stunt goes wrong when the dogs pull her down and drag her for several blocks. Despite this, Santana reassures her and they discuss the next step in their campaign. Rachel lands the lead on the Broadway show, Funny Girl. Santana offers to be Rachel's understudy when Rachel is stuck in Los Angeles for a television show audition. Before the opening, she suffers from a bout of self-doubt, but performs after Santana gives her a pep talk. Lee Paulblatt, a Fox Television executive, sees Rachel perform, and is so impressed, he informs her wants to cast her in an upcoming, untitled television pilot. He has her meet with the famed screenwriter, Mary Halloran, who will be creating the script. After the first meeting, Rachel is confused by Mary's ideas and idiosyncratic behavior. Rachel has the group review Mary's script, and everyone agrees it is terrible (except Brittany). Rachel meets with Mary and tells her that the lead character does not sound like her. Mary points out that television viewers want anti-heroes, but Rachel responds by singing, and Mary, uncharacteristically, is moved and made happy by the performance. She agrees to redo the script, but warns Rachel that the network will never make a pilot from it. Eventually, the network loves the script and calls Rachel, and she moves to LA to start shooting her pilot.|$|E
60|$|Monreale {{you have}} heard of--with its cloisters and cathedral: <b>we</b> often <b>drove</b> there.|$|R
6000|$|... "Who don't know {{anything}} of us, {{and where it}} comes from; or think how <b>we</b> two <b>drove</b> miles across the moor to-night in the rain that it might reach 'em in time?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> now <b>drove</b> on in silence, our horse {{actually}} arching {{his neck}} as he thumped through the snow. Drifts {{had begun to}} form across the road, but through these he bravely plunged.|$|R
2500|$|In his autobiography, Schmeling himself {{confirmed}} the public's {{reaction to the}} outcome, recounting his ambulance ride to the hospital afterward: [...] "As <b>we</b> <b>drove</b> through Harlem, there were noisy, dancing crowds. Bands had left the nightclubs and bars and were playing and dancing on the sidewalks and streets. The whole area was filled with celebration, noise, and saxophones, continuously punctuated by the calling of Joe Louis' name." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "The {{soldiers}} on the hill with the pack-horses began to fire on us. About this time all the Indians had got their horses and guns and bows and arrows and war-clubs and they charged the soldiers {{in the east and}} north on top of the hill. Custer was farther north than these soldiers were then. He was going to attack {{the lower end of the}} village. <b>We</b> <b>drove</b> nearly all that got away from us down the hill along the ridge where another lot of soldiers were trying to make a stand." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "We {{picked up}} the girls {{and went to the}} beach. I had a shot behind the shed. While the girls were {{drinking}} I was trying to OD. <b>We</b> <b>drove</b> around with them. I was asleep most the time. Beckett told me he dropped them off at home. I remember waking up and seeing the girls and then later I asked Beckett where we were and he said Victoria, on the main road somewhere. And I went off my head. I told him to go home, {{get the fuck out of}} here. Then I saw him walking out of the bush. He had blood all over him. Told me he cut his finger." ...|$|E

60|$|Then {{the storm}} died away, in faint and far-off murmurs; and we broke, as it were, from the trance, to find ourselves, not lost, but here among the living. <b>We</b> then <b>drove</b> quietly to Berne.|$|R
6000|$|We possessed {{an ancient}} low-hung [...] "Surrey," [...] a vehicle admirably fitted for an invalid, {{and in this}} {{conveyance}} with a stout mare as motive power <b>we</b> often <b>drove</b> away into the country of a pleasant afternoon, sometimes into Gill's Coulee, sometimes to Onalaska.|$|R
2500|$|On 11 April 1939 the Foreign Policy Committee {{decided that}} the {{question}} of Russia's potential as an ally should be referred to the Chiefs of Staff. Chatfield said that it was clear the political arguments against a Russian alliance outweighed any possible military benefits and that the Chiefs of Staff should only report on Russia's military capability. On 24 April 1939 the Chiefs of Staff submitted their report and rated Russia's military effectiveness low. The next day Chatfield gave the Cabinet Committee on Foreign Policy a summary of this report: [...] "Russia, although a great Power for other purposes, was only a Power of medium rank for military purposes...Her assistance would be of considerable, though not of great, military value". On 16 May 1939 Lord Halifax said that the political reasons for not allying with Russia were stronger than the strategic reasons for such an alliance. Chatfield responded: [...] "...if for fear of making an alliance with Russia <b>we</b> <b>drove</b> that country into the German camp we should have made a mistake of vital and far-reaching importance".|$|E
2500|$|On May 15, 1939, Antonina Pirozhkova {{was awakened}} by four NKVD agents {{pounding}} upon the door of their Moscow apartment. Although surprised, she agreed to accompany them to Babel's dacha in Peredelkino. Babel was then placed under arrest. According to Pirozhkova: [...] "In the car, {{one of the men}} sat in back with Babel and me while the other one sat in front with the driver. 'The worst part of this is that my mother won't be getting my letters', and then he was silent for a long time. I could not say a single word. Babel asked the secret policeman sitting next to him, 'So I guess you don't get too much sleep, do you?' And he even laughed. As we approached Moscow, I said to Babel, 'I'll be waiting for you, it will be as if you've gone to Odessa... only there won't be any letters....' He answered, 'I ask you to see that the child not be made miserable.' [...] "But I don't know what my destiny will be." [...] At this point, the man sitting beside Babel said to me, [...] "We have no claims whatsoever against you." [...] <b>We</b> <b>drove</b> to the Lubyanka Prison and through the gates. The car stopped before the massive, closed door where two sentries stood guard. Babel kissed me hard and said, [...] "Someday we'll see each other..." [...] And without looking back, {{he got out of the}} car and went through that door.|$|E
60|$|I was {{punctual}} to my appointment. <b>We</b> <b>drove</b> {{together to}} the asylum.|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> {{alternately}} <b>drove</b> {{ahead at}} full speed, and stopped to take breath. The Indians fired at random now and then, {{hoping that the}} sound of our footsteps might serve as guide; but they inflicted no more injury on us by shooting, than we did on them while we refrained from discharging our weapons.|$|R
500|$|... "Our {{first trip}} by car took {{us over the}} famed Chapleau Road, the scenery and unique {{loneliness}} {{of which have been}} often reported in magazines. And surely its condition not long after it had opened to travel, when <b>we</b> first <b>drove</b> it in June 1951, was unforgettable. One trip over its 145 miles was almost guaranteed to shorten your life" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I was hurried {{through the}} hall and into the vehicle, again obtaining that {{momentary}} glimpse of trees and a garden. Mr. Latimer followed closely at my heels, and took his place opposite to me without a word. In silence <b>we</b> again <b>drove</b> for an interminable distance with the windows raised, until at last, just after midnight, the carriage pulled up.|$|R
60|$|As <b>we</b> <b>drove</b> off I {{found myself}} alone with Mrs. Cooke's niece {{on the seat}} behind.|$|E
60|$|Benjamin {{looked a}} little sadly at my flushed face as <b>we</b> <b>drove</b> to Major Fitz-David's house.|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>drove</b> on in {{the same}} {{direction}} as before. When we had started he turned to me.|$|E
60|$|But I {{also saw}} {{that we were}} stuck hard and fast, and that though our {{position}} was better than theirs, every shot that <b>we</b> fired <b>drove</b> us with the recoil more firmly aground. I at once gave orders that all firing except with muskets should be stopped; so there we lay aground {{for more than half}} an hour, answering the pirate's fire with our flintlocks.|$|R
60|$|How long we {{struggled}} there hand to hand, stumbling {{now over}} the lifeless forms of our comrades, and again finding our way checked by the dead {{bodies of the}} savages, I cannot say; but certain it is that <b>we</b> finally <b>drove</b> {{the last of the}} hated foe over the stockade, and gave Thayendanega's boasting braves such a lesson as they would not need to have repeated for many days.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{just what}} I expected. You see <b>we</b> have <b>drove</b> in here, and there's been just current enough to drift us on till the lower {{branches}} touched the bottom or {{caught in a}} snag; the water ain't flowing half a mile an hour now, and I reckon when the water begins to drop, which {{will be in a}} few days, if it holds fine, there won't be no current to speak of." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>drove</b> {{as far as}} Yair with Mr. and Mrs. Theobald. The lady read after dinner--and read well.|$|E
60|$|The first {{question}} that I put, as <b>we</b> <b>drove</b> {{from the station}} to the house, related naturally to her father.|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>drove</b> {{off down}} the avenue in {{complete}} silence. When we had turned the corner Eve gave a little sigh.|$|E
60|$|My dear {{girl was}} {{to arrive at}} five o'clock in the afternoon. How to help myself through the {{intermediate}} time better than by taking a long walk along the road by which she was to come, I did not know; so Charley and I and Stubbs--Stubbs saddled, for <b>we</b> never <b>drove</b> him after the one great occasion--made a long expedition along that road and back. On our return, we held a great review {{of the house and}} garden and saw that everything was in its prettiest condition, and had the bird out ready as {{an important part of the}} establishment.|$|R
5000|$|... "At its heart, it is {{the true}} story of someone who epitomised a certain sort of person that this country {{produced}} in the 19th century. There was a fantasy of chivalric empire, run by Britons who were gentlemen and played the game. Of course the reality was that our empire was no better than any other. We were busy conniving in the extermination of tribes, robbing natives of their land and <b>we</b> sent <b>droves</b> of brilliant young men, brought up with the chivalric fantasy, to enforce what was in many cases a visibly corrupt system ... But Fitzroy's morality was iron. He said no. And it destroyed him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It ain't your blame--it's blood! It ain't a {{week ago}} ez the kimpany passes me over a hoss. 'Three-quarters Morgan,' sez they. Sez I: 'Wot's the other quarter?' Sez they: 'A Mexican half-breed.' Well, she was a fair sort of hoss. Comin' down Heavytree Hill last trip, <b>we</b> meets a <b>drove</b> o' Spanish steers. In course she goes wild directly. Blood!" ...|$|R
60|$|Our {{search for}} the little Armantine was less prosperous. Cecile could not ride, nor could even walk {{a quarter of a}} mile without nearly dying of fatigue; nay, the jolting of the coach as <b>we</b> <b>drove</b> along the road would have been insupportable to her but for her longing to see her little one. <b>We</b> <b>drove</b> till it was {{impossible}} to get the coach any farther, and still the farm was only just in sight.|$|E
60|$|The {{direction}} in which <b>we</b> <b>drove</b> took us (as well as I could judge) toward the great northern suburb of London.|$|E
60|$|At the {{appointed}} hour <b>we</b> <b>drove</b> out three miles, and {{assembled in the}} handsome garden {{in front of the}} Emperor's palace.|$|E
6000|$|From {{this point}} <b>we</b> descended, and <b>drove</b> along an ugly, dusty avenue, {{with a high}} brick wall on one side or both, till we reached the gate of Florence, into which we were {{admitted}} with as little trouble as custom-house officers, soldiers, and policemen can possibly give. They did not examine our luggage, and even declined a fee, as we had already paid one at the frontier custom-house. Thank heaven, and the Grand Duke! ...|$|R
60|$|To {{some of my}} readers, no doubt, this wedding trip {{will seem}} a lunatic, extravagant fantasy on my part; but Zulime {{declared}} herself grateful to me for having insisted upon it, and for three days <b>we</b> walked and <b>drove</b> by daylight or by moonlight amid these grandiose scenes, absorbing with eager senses the sounds, sights and colors which we might never again enjoy, returning {{now and then to}} a discussion of our future.|$|R
60|$|During {{this long}} and hurried but {{intensely}} interesting and delightful journey we came upon, at different times, almost every species of animal, plant, and tree peculiar to the African continent. Oftentimes <b>we</b> passed by <b>droves</b> and herds of elephants, deer, buffalo, giraffes, antelopes, and zebras; we saw rhinoceroses, alligators, leopards, lions, apes of several kinds, and smaller monkeys innumerable. We also saw great numbers of birds--some curious {{on account of}} their habits and form, others beautiful and bright as the rainbow.|$|R
