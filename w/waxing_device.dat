50|$|It {{was once}} {{believed}} that in 1912, {{he brought a}} <b>wax</b> cylinder recording <b>device,</b> which he had borrowed from his friend Charles Edison, {{to the home of}} former President Teddy Roosevelt, and convinced Roosevelt to speak into it. However, this pivotal event occurred on March 4, 1913, according to Allen Koenigsberg's latest published research. Thus began Vincent's private collection of voice recordings of notable individuals and witnesses to history.|$|R
40|$|Although {{lateral flow}} assays (LFAs) are {{currently}} being used in some point-of-care applications (POC), they cannot still be extended to {{a broader range of}} analytes for which higher sensitivities and lower detection limits are required. To overcome such drawbacks, we propose here a simple and facile alternative based on the use of delay hydrophobic barriers fabricated by wax printing so as to improve LFA sensitivity. Several wax pillar patterns were printed onto the nitrocellulose membrane in order to produce delays as well as pseudoturbulence in the microcapillary flow. The effect of the proposed <b>wax</b> pillar-modified <b>devices</b> was also mathematically simulated, corroborating the experimental results obtained for the different patterns tested afterwards for detection of HIgG as model protein in a gold nanoparticle-based LFA. The effect of the introduction of such wax-printed pillars was a sensitivity improvement of almost 3 -fold compared to the sensitivity of a conventional free-barrier LFA.

40|$|The {{morphological}} {{and chemical}} nature of ultrafine iron catalyst particles (3 - 5 nm diameters) during activation/FTS was studied by HRTEM, EELS, and Moessbauer spectroscopy. With {{the progress of}} FTS, the carbide re-oxidized to magnetite and catalyst activity gradually decreased. The growth of oxide phase continued and average particle size also increased simultaneously. The phase transformation occurred in a ''growing oxide core'' manner with different nano-zones. The nano-range carbide particles did not show fragmentation or attrition as generally observed in micrometer range particles. Nevertheless, when the dimension of particles reached the micrometer range, the crystalline carbide phase appeared to be sprouted {{on the surface of}} magnetite single crystal. In the previous reporting period, a design and operating philosophy was developed for an integrated wax filtration system for a 4 liter slurry bubble column reactor to be used in Phase II of this research program. During the current reporting period, we have started construction of the new filtration system and began modifications to the 4 liter slurry bubble column reactor (SBCR) reactor. The system will utilize a primary <b>wax</b> separation <b>device</b> followed by a Pall Accusep or Membralox ceramic cross-flow membrane. As of this writing, the unit is nearly complete except for the modification of a moyno-type pump; the pump was shipped to the manufacturer to install a special leak-free, high pressure seal...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Paper-based devices present {{low-cost}} and are versatile, {{making them}} very attractive for clinical analysis. To manufacture those <b>devices</b> <b>wax</b> patterns are printed on paper surface and upon heating the wax permeates {{through the entire}} thickness of the paper, creating hydrophobic barriers that delimit test areas. Antibodies produced in rabbits against canine distemper virus (CDV) were physically adsorbed {{on the surface of}} gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and incubated with CDV viral antigens, forming the immunocomplex. Anti-CDV antibodies were immobilized into the microchannels by physical adsorption, forming the test region. The test solution containing conjugated AuNPs was applied {{at the bottom of the}} microchannel and it was eluted with a phosphate buffer solution 0. 01 M pH 7. 4. When the solution containing the AuNPs reached the test zone the recognition of antigens contained on the immunocomplex occurred with the consequent development of a red line, which represents a positive outcome for the test. This method demonstrated the success of physical immobilization of antibodies on AuNPs and the physical immobilization of antibodies on cellulose’s surface. This colorimetric assay brings simplicity and versatility to clinical analyses, presenting potential for CDV diagnosis...|$|R
40|$|Hydroxyapatite is a calcium {{phosphate}} intensively proposed as a bone substitution material {{because of its}} resemblance to the constituents of minerals present in natural bone. Since hydroxyapatite’s properties are mainly adequate for nonload bearing applications, different solutions are being tested for improving these properties and upgrading them near the target values of natural bone. On the other hand, starch (a natural and biodegradable polymer) and its blends with other polymers have been proposed as constituents in hydroxyapatite mixtures due to the adhesive, gelling, and swelling abilities of starch particles, useful in preparing well dispersed suspensions and consolidated ceramic bodies. This article presents the perspectives of incorporating starch and starch blends in hydroxyapatite materials. Based {{on the role of}} starch within the materials, the review covers its use as (i) a polymeric matrix in hydroxyapatite composites used as adhesives, bone cements, bone <b>waxes,</b> drug delivery <b>devices</b> or scaffolds and (ii) a sacrificial binder for fabrication of porous hydroxyapatite scaffolds. The suitability of these materials for bone reconstruction has becomes a reachable aim considering the recent advancements in ceramic fabrication and the current possibilities of controlling the processing parameters...|$|R
40|$|In the 1930 s, University of Western Ontario surgeon, Dr Edwin Seaborn {{recorded}} {{a series of}} interviews with members of the Saugeen First Nation to learn about their medical practices. Seaborn used a <b>wax</b> cylinder recording <b>device</b> owned by the medical school. One interview dealt with the death of Shawnee war chief Tecumseh, as told by the grandson of an eye witness to the event. British, Canadian and First Nations 2 ̆ 7 forces retreated eastward up the trail by the Thames River in October 1813. Tecumseh insisted they turn to fight the advancing Americans. The night before the Battle of the Thames, Tecumseh slept in a large barn on Lemuel Sherman 2 ̆ 7 s farm in Thamesville. A hole was made in the wall of the barn so that Tecumseh 2 ̆ 7 s horse could be haltered beside him. Most of the barn was used as a hospital. Later the victorious Americans would use the barn for the same purpose. General Proctor and his officers stayed in the farm house. At daybreak on the 5 th October 1813, before the men had eaten, Proctor moved into position at Moraviantown. American mounted troops quickly broke through and routed the British line of regulars, who immediately fled leaving Tecumseh 2 ̆ 7 s force to fight alone. Tecumseh was killed and his body allegedly mutilated. Despite conflicting accounts of Tecumseh 2 ̆ 7 s death, it was quickly assumed into American mythology with a frieze painted into the Rotunda of the Capitol and an iconic sculpture displayed at the Smithsonian Institution. Bragging rights claiming responsibility were used by the successful presidential campaign of William Henry Harrison and the unsuccessful one of Richard Johnson. Tecumseh Sherman, later a leading union civil war general, was named for the slain hero. Searching for Tecumseh 2 ̆ 7 s grave became an obsession of 19 th century America. Seaborn 2 ̆ 7 s recording presents a relatively unknown account of Tecumseh 2 ̆ 7 s death from the aboriginal perspective. It describes the chief fighting with 2 ̆ 7 a long knife 2 ̆ 7 on a bridge to his right and his left. Tecumseh 2 ̆ 7 s lance snapped close to his grip and he fell after 2 ̆ 7 a long knife 2 ̆ 7 was run through his shoulder from behind. The witness hid in the water by 2 ̆ 7 turning himself into a turtle 2 ̆ 7 under a log. He saw Americans take the body of another warrior to a tree and mutilate it. This record contradicts the self serving account of Col. Richard Johnson that is depicted in the Capitol but it is consistent with evidence that Tecumseh 2 ̆ 7 s body was secretly protected by succeeding aboriginal generations until it reached its final resting place on Walpole Island. Sharing sacred stories demonstrates a special level of trust between aboriginal people and the white medical community of the early 20 th century. The Sherman barn represents one of the first hospitals in Western Ontario. Artifacts collected by Seaborn including the wax cylinders and the Sherman barn boards used to halter Tecumseh 2 ̆ 7 s horse probably remain in collections in London, Ontario...|$|R
