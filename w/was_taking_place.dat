5|$|By October 1906, Charles Parham {{was invited}} to speak {{for a series of}} {{meetings}} at Azusa Street but was quickly un-invited. Parham had personality conflicts with Seymour and wanted to be the chief authority figure of the movement that <b>was</b> <b>taking</b> <b>place,</b> but the presiding leaders of the Apostolic Faith Mission were slow to make any changes to their methods or leadership.|$|E
5|$|During {{the last}} years of Heraclius's life, it became evident that a {{struggle}} <b>was</b> <b>taking</b> <b>place</b> between Heraclius Constantine and Martina, who was trying to position her son Heraklonas in line for the throne. When Heraclius died, he devised the empire to both Heraclius Constantine and Heraklonas to rule jointly with Martina as Empress.|$|E
5|$|In {{the last}} eight weeks of the war the bombing {{intensified}} until British bombing operations were suspended in late April 1945. By this time, most of the German airfields were under threat from the advancing Allied ground forces and the mass surrender of the Nachtjagd <b>was</b> <b>taking</b> <b>place.</b>|$|E

40|$|This article {{analyses}} whether industrial upgrading <b>is</b> <b>taking</b> <b>place</b> in {{firms in}} the Fiji garment industry. The research findings shows that 'industrial upgrading' <b>is</b> <b>taking</b> <b>place</b> only in Fijian owned garment firms and not in foreign Australian, New Zealand and Chinese owned garment firms. The Fiji owned garment firms are the most dynamic and a trajectory of industrial upgrading <b>is</b> <b>taking</b> <b>place</b> as they <b>are</b> shifting from half-package production networks to full-package networks...|$|R
50|$|The {{violence}} {{towards the}} black {{soldiers of the}} 5th USCC continued throughout the night and into the next day. Several soldiers concluded that the battle must still <b>be</b> <b>taking</b> <b>place.</b> In fact, Breckinridge rode to the field convinced that skirmishes <b>were</b> <b>taking</b> <b>place.</b>|$|R
5|$|The comic and science-fiction {{bookshop}} Forbidden Planet {{was established}} at No. 23 in 1978 {{before moving to}} New Oxford Street and becoming an international chain. When Douglas Adams attempted to attend a signing for the first The Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy book in October 1979, the queue to the shop was so long that Adams thought a demonstration <b>was</b> <b>taking</b> <b>place</b> elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Examination of peat cores and pollen records {{indicates}} that soil erosion (suggesting clearance of woodland for agricultural purposes) <b>was</b> <b>taking</b> <b>place</b> in 3470 BC (the early Neolithic era); much later, from 2460 BC, evidence of arable cultivation exists. As the climate became damper, peat expanded its coverage {{at the expense}} of woodland, and post-glacial sea level changes left raised beaches around the coastline 18–45metres above the present sea-level, especially between Harris and A'Bhrideanach; Bronze Age artefacts, such as barbed-and-tanged arrowheads typical of the Beaker People, have been found in the machair which replaced it.|$|E
5|$|On a rainy Sunday of 1951, {{the crowd}} left Les Corts stadium after a 2–1 win against Santander by foot, refusing to catch any trams, and {{surprising}} the Francoist authorities. The reason was simple: {{at the same}} time, a tram strike <b>was</b> <b>taking</b> <b>place</b> in Barcelona, receiving the support of blaugrana fans. Events like this made CF Barcelona represent {{much more than just}} Catalonia and many progressive Spaniards saw the club as a staunch defender of rights and freedoms.|$|E
50|$|Spatial {{distance}} is the physical distance {{at which the}} events <b>are</b> <b>taking</b> <b>place</b> from each other. If the event, such as a graduation, <b>is</b> <b>taking</b> <b>place</b> down the street it is being processed on a low level. If the graduation <b>is</b> <b>taking</b> <b>place</b> in another state, then it is processed on a high level. When an event is located far from a person, it is viewed more abstractly. Likewise, when events are at a near location they are viewed more concretely.|$|R

5|$|Piye made various {{unsuccessful}} {{attempts to}} extend Egyptian {{influence in the}} Near East, then controlled by Assyria. In 720BC, he sent an army {{in support of a}} rebellion against Assyria, which <b>was</b> <b>taking</b> <b>place</b> in Philistia and Gaza. However, Piye was defeated by Sargon II and the rebellion failed. In 711BC, Piye again supported a revolt against Assyria by the Israelites of Ashdod and was once again defeated by the Assyrian king Sargon II. Subsequently, Piye was forced from the Near East.|$|E
5|$|The Galileo images {{also led}} to the {{discovery}} that space weathering <b>was</b> <b>taking</b> <b>place</b> on Ida, a process which causes older regions to become more red in color over time. The same process affects both Ida and its moon, although Dactyl shows a lesser change. The weathering of Ida's surface revealed another detail about its composition: the reflection spectra of freshly exposed parts of the surface resembled that of OC meteorites, but the older regions matched the spectra of S-type asteroids.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese convoy arrived off Waga Waga at 8:15pm on 29 August, {{and began}} landing troops and supplies. While this <b>was</b> <b>taking</b> <b>place</b> the {{warships}} shelled Allied positions around Gili Gili and by 11:30pm, had completed their landing. The shelling was not significant, however, and no casualties resulted from it. Throughout 30 August, the Australians carried out patrolling operations while the Japanese laid {{up in the}} jungle in preparation for an attack that night.|$|E

5|$|After a quick {{visit to}} Venezuela and Panama, in April 1948 Castro {{traveled}} {{to the city of}} Bogotá, Colombia where the Pan-American Conference <b>was</b> <b>taking</b> <b>place.</b> Fidel's Cuban student group along with others attempted to organize the 1948 Pan-American Students Conference in opposition, sponsored by the government of Argentine President Juan Perón. Instead the assassination of popular leftist leader Jorge Eliécer Gaitán Ayala led to widespread rioting that {{came to be known as}} the Bogotazo. Leaving 3000 dead, the riots revolved around clashes between the governing Conservatives – backed by the army – and leftist Liberals with support from socialists. Along with his fellow Cuban visitors, Castro joined the Liberal cause by stealing guns from a police station, but subsequent police investigations concluded that neither Castro nor any of the other Cubans had been involved in the killings.|$|E
5|$|Afterwards {{came the}} Bataan Death March, {{which was the}} forcible transfer, by the Imperial Japanese Army, of 60,000 Filipino and 15,000 American prisoners of war after the three-month Battle of Bataan in the Philippines during World War II. The death toll of the march is {{difficult}} to assess as thousands of captives were able to escape from their guards (although many were killed during their escapes), {{and it is not}} known how many died in the fighting that <b>was</b> <b>taking</b> <b>place</b> concurrently. All told, approximately 2,500–10,000 Filipino and 300–650 American prisoners of war died before they could reach Camp O'Donnell.|$|E
5|$|At first, Innocent {{took the}} side of the monks, and lifted Pica's excommunication. While the newest appeal <b>was</b> <b>taking</b> <b>place,</b> Pica and a number of his supporters, who had {{traveled}} to Rome to appeal in person, died in Rome in 1200, and some of the monks alleged this was by poison administered on the orders of Savaric. Meanwhile, Innocent had changed his mind, and reinstalled Savaric as abbot, ordering some English clergy to judge the specifics of the case, and allot the revenues of the abbey between Savaric and the monks. Savaric then attempted to secure more control over other monasteries in his diocese, but died before he could set the plans in motion.|$|E

5|$|Capital {{and energy}} of urban enterprisers {{affected}} {{the development of}} mining and metallurgy during the earlier Commonwealth period. There were several hundred hammersmith shops {{at the turn of}} the 17th century. Great ironworks furnaces were built in the first half of that century. Mining and metallurgy of silver, copper and lead had also been developed. Expansion of salt production <b>was</b> <b>taking</b> <b>place</b> in Wieliczka, Bochnia and elsewhere. After about 1700 some of the industrial enterprises were increasingly being taken over by land owners who used serf labor, which led to their neglect and decline in the second half of the 17th century.|$|E
5|$|General Bell {{had been}} the manager {{of one of the}} coal mines in Cripple Creek where the strike <b>was</b> <b>taking</b> <b>place.</b> It wasn't any {{surprise}} to Haywood that soldiers seemed to be working {{in the interests of the}} employers; he had seen that situation before. But when the Colorado legislature acknowledged the complaints of organized labor and passed an eight hour law, the Colorado supreme court declared it unconstitutional. So the WFM took the issue to the voters, and 72 percent of the state's voters approved the referendum. But the Colorado government ignored the results of the referendum.|$|E
5|$|Hananu's revolt {{coincided with}} Turkish revolts against the French {{military}} presence in the Anatolian cities of Urfa, Gaziantep and Mar'ash. It also was related to Barakat's revolt in Antioch, which was captured and held by Arab guerrillas for a week starting on 13 March 1920. The French Air Force bombarded Antioch for 17 days until the rebels withdrew to Narlija. On 18 April, taking advantage of the diversion of French forces to Gaziantep where a major battle between French and Turkish forces <b>was</b> <b>taking</b> <b>place,</b> Hananu decided to attack the French garrison at Harim. With fifty of his irregulars, Hananu stormed the town. As word of his attack spread to nearby villages, his forces subsequently swelled to 400.|$|E

5|$|Historians have {{questioned}} the competence of the senior Allied officers. Muirhead-Gould had been hosting a dinner party {{on the night of}} the attack, and one of the main guests was the senior United States Navy officer in Sydney Harbour, Captain Howard Bode of USS Chicago. Both officers were sceptical that any attack <b>was</b> <b>taking</b> <b>place.</b> Muirhead-Gould arrived aboard HMAS Lolita at approximately midnight, an action he described as attempting to learn about the situation. But members of Lolitas crew later recounted that when Muirhead-Gould came aboard he immediately chastised the patrol boat's skipper and crew, and quickly dismissed their report. Junior officers on Chicago provided similar descriptions of Bode's return on board, and members of both crews later claimed that Muirhead-Gould and Bode were intoxicated. It was only after the destruction of HMAS Kuttabul that both officers began to take the attack seriously.|$|E
5|$|However, John I {{married a}} {{daughter}} of Sigismund I of Poland, Isabella, who in 1540 bore him a son. Already dying, the king took an oath from his barons to evade the treaty of Oradea, and his counselor, George Martinuzzi, had the infant John II Sigismund elected as king (15401571). Ferdinand I sent troops to take Buda, but they withdrew upon the advance of the Ottoman army. On August 29, 1541 Suleiman I summoned the Hungarian lords to his camp, and while the reception <b>was</b> <b>taking</b> <b>place,</b> his troops occupied {{the capital of the}} kingdom. At the same time the sultan assigned the territories of the kingdom east of the Tisa to Queen Isabella and her son in return for an annual tribute.|$|E
5|$|International {{attitudes to}} the {{federation}} were critical, {{particularly from the}} Afro-Asian bloc in the United Nations. At {{a time when most}} colonial powers were rushing their colonies towards independence, the federation seemed to its opponents to be an unwelcome obstacle. In Britain, Labour grew more critical, and African nationalists in the federation itself became more vocal, dissatisfied with the liberalisation that <b>was</b> <b>taking</b> <b>place,</b> and demanding faster moves towards African advancement. The Governor of Northern Rhodesia, Sir Arthur Benson, wrote a secret letter to his superiors in Britain, highly critical of Welensky and the federation; this letter remained undiscovered until 1958, when Huggins revealed it to Welensky.|$|E
