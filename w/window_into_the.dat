25|$|As in his {{commentary}} on the Tanakh, Rashi frequently illustrates {{the meaning of the}} text using analogies to the professions, crafts, and sports of his day. He also translates difficult Hebrew or Aramaic words into the spoken French language of his day, giving latter-day scholars a <b>window</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> vocabulary and pronunciation of Old French.|$|E
25|$|Pamuk's {{international}} reputation {{continued to}} increase when he published Benim Adım Kırmızı (My Name is Red) in 1998. The novel blends mystery, romance, and philosophical puzzles in a setting of 16th century Istanbul. It opens a <b>window</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> reign of Ottoman Sultan Murat III in nine snowy winter days of 1591, inviting the reader to experience the tension between East and West from a breathlessly urgent perspective. My Name Is Red has been translated into 24 languages and in 2003 won the International Dublin Literary Award, the world's most lucrative literary prize.|$|E

25|$|By {{wearing a}} flat diving mask, humans can see clearly under water. The scuba mask's flat window {{separates}} the {{eyes from the}} surrounding water by a layer of air. Light rays entering from water into the flat parallel window change their direction minimally within the window material itself. But when these rays exit the <b>window</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> air space between the flat window and the eye, the refraction is quite noticeable. The view paths refract (bend) {{in a manner similar}} to viewing fish kept in an aquarium. Linear polarizing filters decrease visibility underwater by limiting ambient light and dimming artificial light sources.|$|E
25|$|The Founding of Lesbos: twentyone hexameters were {{quoted by}} Parthenius {{under the title}} Lesbou ktisis. The author's name was not given but modern {{scholars}} attribute the verses to Apollonius since it has some clear affinities with the Jason/Medea story. It deals with the Lesbian princess, Peisidice, who betrayed her countrymen and her parents by opening the city gates to the man she loved, Achilles. Her reward was not the marriage she had anticipated but rather death by stoning {{at the hands of}} the Argives. It can be argued that Peisidice's viewpoint dominates the poem and that, as with Argonautica, epic material has been used unconventionally as a <b>window</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> female psyche.|$|E
25|$|Thirty new train units (named DT3) {{were ordered}} {{and have been}} {{delivered}} for U3 operations. Those trains are designed to operate without a driver, controlled by an ATC system from Siemens, and will provide the passengers with an unobstructed view from the front <b>window</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> tunnel. A normally locked drivers panel exists at every front window which enables service employees to drive DT3 units by hand if required. As with all Nuremberg subway trains, these units consist of two carriages and are half the platform length. They can be run as a single unit (short train) or coupled as double unit (long train), depending on passenger numbers. For {{the first time in}} a Nuremberg subway train, the two carriages of a unit are built with an accessible gangway. This is intended to improve passenger distribution in the train as many stations in the system have their exits at the very ends of the platform and therefore often the first and the last carriages of a 4 carriage (long) train are rather full, while the two middle carriages are relatively empty.|$|E

The style of the throne is similar to Busabok Mala Throne on the porch outside. The throne was built {{during the reign of}} King Rama IV, in order for the palace women to attend important ceremonies through the window but behind a screen, separating them from men arriving from the outside.|$|E

In November 2009, U.S. President Barack Obama, wrote that her blog [...] "provides the world a unique <b>window</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> realities of daily life in Cuba" [...] and applauded her efforts to [...] "empower fellow Cubans to express themselves through the use of technology." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{office and}} {{warehouse}} of the Scranton branch office were sets {{on the production}} company's office in Van Nuys, California, although a real office {{was used in the}} show's first season. For episodes in season two and beyond, scenes set in the parking lot made use of the exterior of the production company's office building. Since the stage set had no windows, writer Jennifer Celotta's office was dressed to look like Michael Scott's when the script called for him or someone else to look out the <b>window</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> parking lot.

500|$|The small Philadelphia {{panel is}} painted with oil on {{parchment}} (vellum); a reconstructed red vermilion border surrounds the image– it {{is similar to}} those seen in contemporary illuminated manuscripts. [...] It gives the illusion of the viewer looking through a <b>window</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> landscape. The parchment measures the image measures [...] Underneath are five wood supports; the parchment is glued to one, and four smaller pieces, added at a later date, frame the image. The parchment is unusually thick and has a thin insoluble layer of primer. The wooden frames were primed in {{a thick layer of}} white, which overlaps the parchment in places. The borders were gilded at some time; technical analysis found particles of gold leaf on the lower border. The Turin panel is painted on two oak panels joined with a band of parchment or cloth, on a ground of chalk and animal glue.|$|E
500|$|Chris Martins of The A.V. Club {{awarded the}} album a B+ rating, {{feeling that it}} [...] "offers a new <b>window</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> {{obfuscated}} Patton oeuvre". Martins also compared the record to California and felt {{that it would be}} greatly enjoyed by fans of Patton's various side projects. Writing for The Boston Globe, James Reed described Mondo Cane as [...] "offbeat for sure but not off-putting", adding that [...] "language is no barrier with music this lovely". Sputnikmusic's Tyler Monro rated the album three-and-a-half out of five, feeling that it would be, in theory, a bad idea. However, Monro felt that, on listening to the album, it was [...] "his best work in close to a decade", describing it as [...] "a summer-time staple and a faithful reminder that Mike Patton can sing but sadly little else". Writing for PopMatters, John Garratt rated the album seven out of ten, writing [...] "even if this album is a genre exercise, it’s still a very fine one". Garrat felt that [...] "Deep Down" [...] was the album's best song, adding that it [...] "feels like it was written just for Mike Patton to sing".|$|E
500|$|Tower Ridge is {{the longest}} of the north face's four main ridges, with around 600 metres of ascent. It is not {{technically}} demanding (its grade is Difficult), and most pitches can be tackled unroped by competent climbers, but it is committing and very exposed. Castle Ridge (Moderate), the northernmost of the main ridges, is an easier scramble, while Observatory Ridge (Very Difficult), the closest ridge to the summit, is [...] "technically the hardest of the Nevis ridges in summer and winter". Between the Tower and Observatory Ridges are the Tower and Gardyloo Gullies; the latter {{takes its name from}} the cry of [...] "garde à l'eau" [...] (French for [...] "watch out for the water") formerly used in Scottish cities as a warning when householders threw their slops (and worse) out of a tenement <b>window</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> street. The gully's top wall was the refuse pit for the now-disused summit observatory. The North-east Buttress (Very Difficult) is the southernmost and bulkiest of the four ridges; it is as serious as Observatory Ridge but not as technically demanding, mainly because an [...] "infamous" [...] rock problem, the 'Man-trap', can be avoided on either side.|$|E
