5|$|A {{prototype}} for the Kinetoscope {{was shown to}} a convention of the National Federation of Women's Clubs on May 20, 1891. The first public demonstration of the Kinetoscope {{was held at the}} Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences on May 9, 1893. Instrumental to the birth of American movie culture, the Kinetoscope also had a major impact in Europe; its influence abroad was magnified by Edison's decision not to seek international patents on the device, facilitating numerous imitations of and improvements on the technology. In 1895, Edison introduced the Kinetophone, which joined the Kinetoscope with a cylinder phonograph. Film projection, which Edison initially disdained as financially nonviable, soon superseded the Kinetoscope's individual exhibition model. Many of the projection systems developed by Edison's firm in later years <b>would</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> Kinetoscope name.|$|E
5|$|A {{regional}} {{transit authority}} {{was formed in}} the early 1990s to build and operate a light rail system that <b>would</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> bus tunnel within Downtown Seattle. The authority, later named Sound Transit, gained voter approval in November 1996 to build a $3.9billion system between Seattle–Tacoma International Airport, Downtown Seattle, and the University District. In 1998, Sound Transit found that the rails in the tunnel {{would need to be}} replaced at a cost of up to $110 million and require a full closure for two years. The plan would also require the purchase of new hybrid electric buses to replace the Breda fleet, as the electrical systems were incompatible. Convention Place station would have to be abandoned as it was too shallow to support a northern extension under Interstate 5.|$|E

5|$|Air Marshal Philip Joubert de la Ferté, {{commander-in-chief}} of RAF Coastal Command agreed {{this was}} the probable route. He expected the Germans to make an attempt anytime after the 10 February. Unfortunately, the Air Ministry and the three RAF commands, RAF Coastal Command, RAF Bomber Command and RAF Fighter Command, believed the Germans <b>would</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> darkness for the longest and most dangerous {{part of the journey}} through the straits and would leave in daylight. The far from adequate forces at their disposal, they believed, would be best used at night. Most of RAF Bomber Command was ordered to stand down accordingly. Such an order made it totally unprepared to strike in daylight hours on 12 February.|$|E
5|$|From its inception, users <b>would</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> {{newsgroup}} {{to discuss}} {{the quality of the}} episode, as well as to talk about continuity errors and trivia. They would also discuss cultural references, usually related to pop culture. Another common topic is freeze frame gags, which are jokes that can only be seen when the viewer tapes the episode and freezes the image. All of these many discussions were compiled and submitted to The Simpsons Archive, which contains at least 330 episode guides as well as other guides. The newsgroup also provides The Simpsons Archive with information on the characters and the setting, as well as a compilation of articles about the show and interview with its cast and crew.|$|E

5|$|In February and March 2011, Japan's Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism {{sponsored}} {{a test of}} the route by shipping roof tiles to Europe via the Trans-Siberian. The tiles were transported by ship from Hamada, Shimane to Vladivostok, then by the railway to Moscow. The transit time was expected to be 30 days, in comparison with the 50 days on average it takes to ship cargo by ship from Hamada to ports in western Russia. If successful, the ministry <b>would</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> results of the test to encourage other Japanese companies to utilize the Trans-Siberian over the sea route.|$|E

Diệm claimed that the American media was seeking to bring him down and he introduced new restrictions on press freedom and political association.

5|$|The Australian Government is {{planning}} to sell the Hornets and associated spare parts after the type is retired from RAAF service. In August 2017 the Canadian Government initiated discussions to purchase a number of Australian F/A-18s to augment the Royal Canadian Air Force's fleet of similar McDonnell Douglas CF-18 Hornets {{in the event that}} a planned purchase of Super Hornets does not proceed. A Canadian delegation also visited Australia that month to inspect RAAF Hornets. An article in Australian Aviation stated that it is unclear whether Canada <b>would</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> aircraft operationally or as a source of spare parts. The Canadian Government lodged a formal expression of interest to purchase Australian F/A-18s on 29 September 2017. A response from the Australian Government is expected by the end of 2017.|$|E
