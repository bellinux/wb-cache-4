Upon sealing at temperatures compatible with other SOFC materials (generally {le} 900 C), these glasses transform to glass-ceramics with desirable thermo-mechanical properties, including coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE) over 11 x 10 {sup - 6 }/C. The long-term (>four months) stability of CTE under SOFC operational conditions (e. g., 800 C in <b>wet</b> <b>forming</b> gas or in air) has been evaluated, as have weight losses under similar conditions. The dependence of sealant properties on glass composition are described in this report, as are experiments to develop glass-matrix composites by adding second phases, including Ni and YSZ.

A total of 160 one-day-old male broiler chickens were randomly allocated to 4 treatments with 4 pens per treatment and 10 chickens per pen, in a fully randomized 2  ×  2 factorial arrangement, two feeding arrangement; providing feed ad libitum (Full Fed) or FR by 50 % between days 6 to 12, and feed in either <b>wet</b> or dry <b>form</b> (<b>wet</b> <b>form,</b> 1. 2  g water per 1  g dry feed). Body weight and feed intake of broiler chickens were determined at d 0, 21, and 42, and feed conversion ratio (FCR) was calculated. At d 42, two birds per replicate were euthanised for determination of carcass weight, organ weight and length, and also for blood parameters, which included high density lipoprotein (HDL), low density lipoprotein (LDL), total cholesterol and triglycerides (TG). The broilers fed <b>wet</b> <b>form</b> irrespective of FR throughout had superior body weight gain and carcass weight compared with birds fed dry diets at d 22 and 42 (P <  0. 05). The <b>wet</b> <b>form</b> with FR significantly showed lower FCR compared with the <b>wet</b> <b>form</b> and ad libitum at d 1 to 21 (P <  0. 05).

The aim {{of the present study was}} to identify a serum microRNA (miRNA) expression profile specific for dry and <b>wet</b> <b>forms</b> of AMD. Material/Methods: Serum miRNA expression was first screened using TaqMan ® Human MicroRNA Array A (Applied Biosystems). An extensive, self-validated, individual, quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) study was then performed on a cohort of 300 AMD patients (150 <b>wet</b> <b>form</b> and 150 dry form) and 200 controls.

40|$|The {{stabilisation}} of aqueous suspensions of {{lead zirconate titanate}} (PZT) powder with a lignosulphonate polyelectrolyte was {{studied as}} a function of pH and lignosulphonate dosage. Suspension stability (as indicated by sedimentation behaviour, zeta potential magnitude, and apparent viscosity) increased with increasing pH. At each pH examined, maximal suspension stability was achieved using an optimal amount of lignosulphonate that corresponded to monolayer adsorption onto the PZT particles. The optimal amount decreased with increasing pH {{as a result of the}} expanding conformation and increasing degree of dissociation of the lignosulphonate molecules. Although the zeta potential of PZT particles in lignosulphonate-free suspensions was reasonably large at pH 9. 2, there was insufficient electrostatic repulsion for stabilisation of suspensions. The adsorption of lignosulphonate at this pH marginally increased the zeta potential magnitude but markedly increased the suspension stability, indicating that the stabilisation mechanism was a combination of electrostatic and steric stabilisation. Stable suspensions of the PZT powder suitable for ceramic <b>wet</b> <b>forming</b> processes were achieved under conditions of high pH with an optimal lignosulphonate dosage of ∼ 0. 2 - 0. 3 wt%. 8 page(s...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Nanozirconia ceramics have great potential {{to be used in}} a range of applications from dental implants to petrochemical valves due to their enhanced mechanical properties and superior hydrothermal ageing resistance. Unlike conventional ceramic components that are normally produced in large quantities with low costs using various conventional dry forming or <b>wet</b> <b>forming</b> methods, industry scale processing of nanoceramics has not yet been achieved. Concentration and granulation of nanostructured 3 mol% yttria stabilised zirconia via a spray freeze drying (SFD) technique was investigated to determine whether large scale dry forming of nanoceramics would be possible. Commercial nanosuspension with a primary particle size of 16 nm was concentrated to 55 wt% solids content using an electrosteric dispersant, β-alanine, whilst retaining low viscosities of ~ 20 mPa s at a 200 s- 1 shear rate. The nanosuspensions concentrated using the β-alanine also displayed good ageing resistance and it has been proven that a large scale vacuum assisted rotary evaporator can be used to perform concentration in industry.

40|$|Pressure casting is a forming method {{which has}} been known for a long time. This forming {{technique}} has been accepted more and more in the sanitary ware production over the last fifteen years due its clearly higher productivity as compared with plaster mould slip casting. However the application of pressure casting in the field of non-clay ceramics is very limited and under development. A laboratory pressure casting machine was used for casting of aqueous silicon nitride slips. Several commercial polymethylmethacrylate materials were applied as the filtering and moulding material. The penetration of fine powder particles into the mould was avoided by partially flocculation of the slips. With the partially flocculated slips lower green densities were reached (maximum 54 per cent) compared with pressure cast deflocculated slips (maximum 63 per cent). In both cases the slip pressure was varied in the range 1 MPa - 3 MPa and it did not significantly influenced the green density. The bending strength of the sintered samples was between 700 and 800 MPa and it is consequently lower than the strength of dry pressed samples. Large pores because of a inhomogeneous distribution of the polyacrylate binder were detected as defects in the microstructure. Further research work is necessary to show the principle benefit of this <b>wet</b> <b>forming</b> method to advantage also for the non-clay ceramic powders...|$|E
40|$|This is {{a review}} of acid {{aluminum}} phosphate for the binding and coating of materials. The acid aluminum phosphate {{in the form of}} a solution obtained by dissolving aluminum hydroxide in phosphoric acid, with a P/Al molar ratio of 23, is effective for the binding of fibrous or particulate materials. Porous ceramic articles are made using this binder by <b>wet</b> <b>forming,</b> followed by heat treatment. The binder resides at the junction of the adjacent fibers in the porous fibrous ceramic article. No free binder was observed in fibrous or particulate articles. The porosity is 45 %– 90 % in fibrous articles, and is 25 %– 82 % in particulate articles. Porosity above 61 % in particulate articles is attained by adding carbon particles and subsequent removal of them by combustion. The binder proportion is 3 – 10 wt % in fibrous articles, and is ∼ 0. 1 wt % in particulate articles. Porous ceramic articles made using a silica binder instead of the acid aluminum phosphate binder are inferior in permeability, mechanical properties and creep resistance, and exhibit a wider pore size distribution. Free silica binder was observed in articles made with the silica binder. The acid aluminum phosphate with a P/Al ratio of 12 or 23 is also effective for coating materials, particularly graphite for the purpose of oxidation protection.
