5000|$|In 1920s, the <b>Winkler</b> <b>process</b> was {{developed}} to gasify coal in a fluidized bed, using oxygen. It was not commercially successful. The first large scale commercial implementation, in the early 1940s, was the fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) process, which converted heavier petroleum cuts into gasoline. Carbon-rich [...] "coke" [...] deposits on the catalyst particles and deactivates the catalyst in less than 1 second. The fluidized catalyst particles are shuttled between the fluidized bed reactor and a fluidized bed burner where the coke deposits are burned off, generating heat for the endothermic cracking reaction.|$|E
40|$|After {{fluidized}} bed technology was first {{applied in the}} <b>Winkler</b> <b>process</b> for coal gasification in 1930 's, then the development of {{fluidized bed}} technology growths very fast. In the recent years, fluidized bed technology has been applied in various industrial processes such as fluid catalytic cracking, gas-solid reaction, drying, particle classification and separation, dedusting, waste treatment, bioprocess etc. The rapid permeation of fluidization technique in Malaysia {{in the production of}} chemicals, petroleum and petroleum product, medicine, foods, pharmaceuticals, nuclear, polymers, fertilizer, powder, plastics, metals from their ores and separation, new fine and conventional materials as well as conservation of energy, and disposal of waste and environmental protection etc. has demonstrated its viability in present and future technology of our growing economic construction. However, our expectation to improve the efficiency of the processes has created the need for fresh innovations of the equipment and processes involved, which need adequate understanding of fundamentals. This paper shows several applications of fluidized bed technology in industrial processes and explains {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the process, which offers innovation touch to obtain better result...|$|E
40|$|The {{capacity}} of pluripotent {{embryonic stem cells}} to differentiate into any cell type in the body makes them invaluable {{in the field of}} regenerative medicine. However, because of the complexity of both the core pluripotency network and the process of cell fate computation it is not yet possible to control the fate of stem cells. We present a theoretical model of stem cell fate computation that is based on Halley and <b>Winkler’s</b> Branching <b>Process</b> Theory (BPT) and on Greaves et al. ’s agent-based computer simulation derived from that theoretical model. BPT abstracts the complex production and action of a Transcription Factor (TF) into a single critical branching process that may dissipate, maintain, or become supercritical. Here we take the single TF model and extend it to multiple interacting TFs, and build an agent-based simulation of multiple TFs to investigate the dynamics of such coupled systems. We have developed the simulation and the theoretical model together, in an iterative manner, with the aim of obtaining a deeper understanding of stem cell fate computation, in order to influence experimental efforts, which may in turn influence the outcome of cellular differentiation. The model used is an example of self-organization and could be more widely applicable to the modelling of other complex systems. The simulation based on this model, though currently limited in scope in terms of the biology it represents, supports the utility of the Halley and <b>Winkler</b> branching <b>process</b> model in describing the behaviour of stem cell gene regulatory networks. Our simulation demonstrates three key features: (i) the existence of a critical value of the branching process parameter, dependent on the details of the cistrome in question; (ii) the ability of an active cistrome to “ignite” an otherwise fully dissipated cistrome, and drive it to criticality; (iii) how coupling cistromes together can reduce their critical branching parameter values needed to drive them to criticality...|$|R
5000|$|Winkler {{first began}} {{translating}} Quebec {{literature in the}} late 1980s. Although he never studied translation, he has since translated over 25 works including novels, poetry and essays. He {{is a member of}} the Literary Translators' Association of Canada. Carmine Starnino describes Winkler as [...] "one of Canada's most gifted and highly decorated practitioners." [...] <b>Winkler</b> describes the <b>process</b> of translation as “a constant quest for perfect pitch” and a “sophisticated word game”. A successful translation, in his words, gives readers “some sense of what it’s like to be in another culture’s skin”. His translations have been described as [...] "seamless" [...] and [...] "wonderful". [...] Sheila Fischman, his spouse, is also an award-winning translator. He describes her as the “doyenne of Canadian literary translation”.|$|R

The basic {{nutritional}} aspects and {{parameters of}} freshwater and marine algal food products are described. Blue-green algae (Spirulina pacifica, S. platensis), green algae (Chlorella pyrenoidosa), red algae (Palmaria palmata, Porphyra tenera), and brown algae (Eisenia bicyclis, Hizikia fusiformis, Laminaria japonica, Undaria pinnatifida) {{were used for}} this purpose. The ash content, total nitrogen, dietary fibers, and in vitro digestibility of the above-mentioned algal species were studied. The total nitrogen contents were analysed using a modified <b>Winkler?s</b> methodin the <b>process,</b> higher nitrogen contents were observed in freshwater algae than in marine ones. For the analysis of dietary fiber contents, the instrument Ankom 220 Fibre Analyser was used. The marine brown algae species were generally assigned higher contents of dietary fiber than the freshwater algal products. The results of the dietary fiber analysis differed with the methodologies used...|$|R
