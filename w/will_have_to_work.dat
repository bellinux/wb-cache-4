5|$|Jim's plan {{to drive}} home from Philadelphia to see his {{daughter}} CeCe's ballet recital hits a snag when a major investor says he is backing out. Jim asks his wife Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) to record the recital with her phone, which she agrees to do. During {{the opening of the}} recital, she stops recording to take a phone call informing her that she has been chosen to paint an important public mural. In her excitement, she messes up the recording and fails to record any of CeCe's appearance. Jim calls her that evening to tell her the investor backed out, and his group <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> long hours to make up the lost funds. He asks her to send him her recording of the recital as a way to cheer him up, and Pam confesses that she did not tape it. She tries to make light of the mishap by making self-deprecating remarks and pointing out that they can get recordings of the recital from other attendees, but he becomes frustrated at her, scolding her and starting a fight over his new job, the time he spends away from the family, and the sacrifices they are making to get their new life to work. After he hangs up, Pam breaks down in tears. A previously unseen boom operator named Brian (Chris Diamantopoulos) enters into the shot and comforts her, and tells the crew to stop filming.|$|E
25|$|The key {{assumption}} underpinning Black's {{thinking is}} that because people are living longer they <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> longer - hence {{the need for more}} effective intervention when working people fall ill, so that they can remain in the workforce instead of retiring on medical grounds or going onto benefits.|$|E

50|$|Ken Luckey as Will: Born {{and bred}} in Pacific Shores, easy-going Will grew up idolizing his father, the town Police Chief. Following his dad {{into the family}} business, <b>Will</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> hard <b>to</b> prove himself worthy of {{becoming}} a police officer. Most people in town think his father is a hard ass, but Will's much more easygoing. Although he's done some dating amongst the locals, <b>Will</b> <b>has</b> yet <b>to</b> find the right woman for him, and is beginning to doubt if she'll ever come along.|$|R

25|$|As a {{transition}} {{is made to}} stage four, feelings will become prevalent at this time, so dealing with those feelings {{will be an important}} aspect of the intervention. While managing the feelings, the counselor must allow the client(s) to express his or her story, and explore feelings and emotions through active listening and validation. Eventually, the counselor <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> carefully to respond to the client using challenging responses in order to help him or her work past maladaptive beliefs and thoughts, and to think about other options.|$|E
25|$|Matthew Sykes (Caan), {{a police}} detective, loses his partner Bill Tuggle (Brown) in a shootout; the detectives {{had been trying}} to stop two Newcomer criminals murdering another Newcomer named Porter at a grocery, in what {{appeared}} to be a robbery. The next day, Sykes' superior Captain Warner (McCarthy), informs his squad that they <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with the newly promoted Newcomer detective Sam Francisco (Patinkin). Although biased, Sykes enlists to work with Francisco to investigate a similar homicide with a Newcomer named Warren Hubely, feeling that if he investigates that crime, he will also find opportunities to investigate his partner's death (which he is officially forbidden to do).|$|E
25|$|The Dodd–Frank Act {{has several}} {{provisions}} that {{call upon the}} Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to implement several new rules and regulations that will affect corporate governance issues surrounding public corporations in the United States. Many of the provisions put in place by Dodd–Frank require the SEC to implement new regulations, but intentionally do not give specifics as to when regulations should be adopted or exactly what the regulations should be. This will allow the SEC to implement new regulations over several years and make adjustments as it analyzes the environment. Public companies <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> to adopt new policies in order {{to adapt to the}} changing regulatory environment they will face over the coming years.|$|E

25|$|The Baker's Wife and Cinderella meet again, and the Baker's Wife makes {{a desperate}} grab for her shoes, almost {{succeeding}} before Cinderella flees. The Baker {{and his wife}} reunite, now with {{three of the four}} items. The Baker admits that they <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> together to fulfill the quest ("It Takes Two"). Jack arrives with a hen that lays golden eggs and attempts to buy Milky White back, but the cow suddenly keels over dead as midnight chimes. Again, the characters exchange morals ("Second Midnight"). The Witch discovers that the Prince has been visiting Rapunzel and begs Rapunzel to stay with her so she can protect her from the outside world ("Stay with Me"). When Rapunzel refuses, the Witch angrily cuts off Rapunzel's hair and banishes her to a desert. The Mysterious Man gives the Baker the money to buy another cow. Jack encounters Little Red Ridinghood, who is now sporting a wolf skin cape and a knife for protection, and tries to impress her by telling her about the kingdom of the Giant. When she refuses to believe him, he is goaded into returning once again to the Giant's home to steal a magic harp.|$|E
500|$|The {{relationship}} between the Greek Americans and the African Americans is fraught with prejudice. For example, during the Depression, Desdemona is shocked and humiliated that she <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> in the Black Bottom, a predominantly black neighborhood. When African Americans are beaten or taken advantage of by whites, the characters in Middlesex [...] "suddenly are nearsighted" [...] to the racial prejudice. Despite being in the United States for only 10years and having experienced racism herself, she can, Zecker noted, [...] "recite at heart the slights at blacks as lazy, dirty, sexually promiscuous, and incapable of self-help." [...] She and other whites, including immigrant whites, feel rage because they are [...] "convinced they were somehow forced out of Detroit following 1967." [...] While walking through the neighborhood, a group of African-American men loafing {{in front of a}} barbershop wolf-whistle to Desdemona and make lascivious comments, thus confirming the racial stereotype.|$|E
500|$|In April 2007, the Prime Minister's {{annual salary}} {{increased}} to S$3.1 million (US$2.05 million), {{about five times}} that of the then President of the United States George W. Bush who earned US$400,000. The annual entry-level salary for ministers increased from $1.2 million to $1.6 million, and was projected to rise to 88% of the private sector benchmark by the end of 2008. Almost half of ministers' pay packages was made up of an individual performance bonus decided by the Prime Minister, and a variable bonus component based on the country's prevailing gross domestic product and capped at eight months of each minister's annual salary. The pay increases were justified by the Government {{on the grounds that the}} salaries had to keep pace with those in the private sector to attract the best talent and to avoid corruption. Teo Chee Hean, the Minister for Defence and minister in charge of the civil service, was reported as saying: [...] "We don't want pay to be the reason for people to join [...] But we also don't want pay to be the reason for them not to join us, or to leave after joining us." [...] The increases sparked much debate both in and out of Parliament, with many people seeing ministerial pay as already being too high. During a Parliamentary debate on the issue, Nominated Member of Parliament Thio Li-ann said: [...] "It would be a sad indictment of my generation if no one came forward to serve without excessive monetary inducement, as to be bereft of deep convictions is to be impoverished indeed." [...] On 11 April 2007, the Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong told Parliament: [...] "To make it quite clear why I am doing this, and also to give me the moral standing to defend this policy with Singaporeans, I will hold my own salary at the present level for five years. The government will pay me my full salary, because that is the way the system <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>work,</b> but for five years, whatever the increase in the salary above its present level, I will donate to suitable good causes." [...] The following day, it was clarified that the Prime Minister had decided to do so a while ago, and that he had not been influenced by pressure arising from the announcement of the ministerial pay rise.|$|E

He spends several months there, despite an early run-in with his employer John Bickersdyke, made more comfortable by the presence of Psmith on the scene, and eventually succumbs to the lure of sunshine and cricket, leaving his job to join his brother Joe in a match at Lord's. Psmith's father Mr Smith, seeing Mike's talent, decides to hire him as estate manager, paying for him to study at Cambridge first.|$|R

The wind is in your favour, because you <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> tack <b>to</b> <b>work</b> up the bay and, if you make pretty long tacks, they won't suspect you, when you start across, until you have got pretty well away and, with this breeze, there will be no chance of their {{catching}} you before you are under our guns." ...|$|R
