500|$|The Hands {{also became}} close friends of Cornish {{resident}} Louis Dow, a Dartmouth College professor. Frances Hand spent {{increasing amounts of}} time with Dow while her husband was in New York, and tension crept into the marriage. Despite speculation, however, {{there is no evidence}} that she and Dow were lovers. Hand regretted Frances' long absences and urged her to spend more time with him, but he maintained an enduring friendship with Dow. He blamed himself for a lack of insight into his wife's needs in the early years of the marriage, confessing his [...] "blindness and insensibility to <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> and to your right to your own ways when they differed from mine". Fearing he might otherwise lose her altogether, Hand came to accept Frances' desire to spend time in the country with another man.|$|E
500|$|Frankie {{begins to}} hear their tiny voices calling to her and, though World tries to {{distract}} her from it, she finally discovers her friends. World finally becomes upset and scolds Frankie of planning to leave him alone in the toy box forever. She calms him down enough to befriend and unshrink the gang, but Mr. Herriman bursts in, having gotten into the toy box and somehow past the gang's obstacles, and harshly scolds World before preparing to take the gang home and leave World. World's world falls to pieces until it's nothing but a white void. World becomes angry and unstable and turns into a chimera-like creature to attack them all (made of the remaining refuse of his world). The gang manages to escape the toy box. Frankie climbs out as well and tries to convince everyone to let World out of the box. Herriman finally yields and releases World from the box, due to a realization of his long misjudgement of Frankie and newfound appreciation for her during her absence. World gets happy already and shouts that he's free and everyone is really confused, Frankie's answer is: [...] "Well, {{think of it this}} way: Imagine if you were able to have anything you wanted, except one thing, but that one thing is <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> more than anything else. For him, that thing is a friend. That's all he wanted; that's {{what he was trying to}} protect. So I brought him here. Here he can have all the friends in the world! I mean come on, isn't friendship what Foster's is all about?" [...] Instantaneously Bloo shouts, [...] " [...] No, it's all about me!" [...] promptly Herriman slaps him with a glove, to the delight of everyone else.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{early media}} reports {{attributed}} the shootings to {{a desire for}} revenge {{on the part of}} Harris and Klebold for bullying that they received, subsequent psychological analysis indicated Harris and Klebold harbored serious psychological problems. According to Dave Cullen, Harris, who conceived the attacks, was a [...] "cold-blooded, predatory psychopath" [...] and an intelligent, charming liar with [...] "a preposterously grand superiority complex, a revulsion for authority and an excruciating need for control". In Cullen's assessment, Harris lacked remorse or empathy for others, and sought to punish them for their perceived inferiority. According to Principal Frank DeAngelis, Harris was [...] "the type of kid who, when he was in front of adults, he'd tell you <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> to hear." ...|$|E

2500|$|After 1965, Brown's bandleader and {{arranger}} was Alfred [...] "Pee Wee" [...] Ellis. Ellis credits Clyde Stubblefield's {{adoption of}} New Orleans drumming techniques, {{as the basis}} of modern funk: [...] "If, in a studio, you said 'play it funky' that could imply almost anything. But 'give me a New Orleans beat' – you got exactly <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>wanted.</b> And Clyde Stubblefield was just the epitome of this funky drumming." [...] Stewart states that the popular feel was passed along from [...] "New Orleans—through James Brown's music, to the popular music of the 1970s." [...] Concerning the various funk motifs, Stewart states: [...] "This model, it should be noted, is different from a time line (such as clave and tresillo) in that it is not an exact pattern, but more of a loose organizing principle." ...|$|E
2500|$|Due to cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel's use of de-focussing {{and soft}} wipes {{in the digital}} grade, Warner Bros. asked {{director}} David Yates to add more colours to the film. Yates didn't want to lose the [...] "very European look" [...] of the film, but after retouching the picture, he said, [...] "It's not <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>wanted,</b> but we're happy with it." [...] After five minutes of watching the film, the studio were pleased with the changes. In an interview with Total Film, Yates said that [...] "the choice of angles, the extreme close-ups, [...] the pacing of the scenes" [...] made the film [...] "incredibly rich". The palette and lighting was heavily inspired by the Dutch painter Rembrandt. Half-Blood Prince is the only film in the series to be nominated for the Best Cinematography accolade at the Academy Awards.|$|E
