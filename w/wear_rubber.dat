2500|$|The Oregon years saw an {{increased}} emphasis on Rajneesh's prediction that the world might be destroyed by nuclear war or other disasters sometime in the 1990s. Rajneesh had said as early as 1964 that [...] "the third and last war {{is now on the}} way" [...] and frequently spoke of the need to create a [...] "new humanity" [...] to avoid global suicide. This now became the basis for a new exclusivism, and a 1983 article in the Rajneesh Foundation Newsletter announcing that [...] "Rajneeshism is creating a Noah's Ark of consciousness... I say to you that except this there is no other way", increased the sense of urgency in building the Oregon commune. In March 1984, Sheela announced that Rajneesh had predicted the death of two-thirds of humanity from AIDS. Sannyasins were required to <b>wear</b> <b>rubber</b> gloves and condoms if they had sex, and to refrain from kissing, measures widely represented in the press as an extreme over-reaction since condoms were not usually recommended for AIDS prevention because AIDS was considered a homosexual disease at that stage.|$|E

The older species of the oak, ash, and elm trees in the 407 hectare grove are about 70-80 years old, but even the younger ones are older than 50 years. The grove is so isolated that red deer are only found here in the Bereg forests; there are about 50 of them, and some have capital antlers. Wild boars and roes, as well as black storks and wild cats can often be seen here. There are also vipers living here, so it is recommended to <b>wear</b> <b>rubber</b> boots when walking in the forest. Outside Lónya a hunting lodge is waiting for the hunters.|$|E
