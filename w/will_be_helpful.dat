25|$|However, {{many times}} there are methodological {{problems}} in these tests. Unconditional risk questions in cross-sectional studies are used consistently, leading to problems, as they {{ask about the}} likelihood of an action occurring, but does not determine {{if there is an}} outcome, or compare events that haven't happened to events that have. Concerning vaccines, perceptions of those who have not been vaccinated are compared to the perceptions of people who have been. Other problems which arise include the failure to know a person's perception of a risk.

2500|$|Viral vectors {{proved to}} be more {{successful}} in transfecting cells as their life cycles require them to transfer their own genes to the host cells with high efficiency.

2500|$|Evolutionary psychologists John Tooby and Leda Cosmides were {{puzzled by}} {{the fact that in the}} US race is one of the three {{characteristics}} most often used in brief descriptions of individuals (the others are age and sex). They reasoned that natural selection would not have favoured the evolution of an instinct for using race as a classification, because for most of human history, humans almost never encountered members of other races. Tooby and Cosmides hypothesized that modern people use race as a proxy (rough-and-ready indicator) for coalition membership, since a better-than-random guess about [...] "which side" [...] another person is on <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>helpful</b> if one does not actually know in advance.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{examples}} from auditory perception research <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>helpful</b> {{in explaining the}} fact that our perceptual faculties naturally enhance and supplement our conscious experience. First, there is the [...] "cocktail party phenomenon" [...] (Moray, 1959). When someone is engaged in conversation with a group of people in a noisy room, but then they suddenly hear something or hear their name from across the room, when they were completely inattentive to the input before, that is the cocktail party phenomenon. This phenomenon also occurs with words associated with danger and sex. Although people may be inattentive to a portion of their environment, when they hear specific [...] "trigger" [...] words, their auditory capacities are redirected to another dimension of perceptual awareness. This shows that we do process information outside of our immediate conscious experience. Similar to visual perception, auditory perception also enhances and supplements our experience by searching out and extracting meaningful information from our environment.|$|E
