5|$|The Alcathoe bat (Myotis alcathoe) is a European bat in {{the genus}} Myotis. Known only from Greece and Hungary {{when it was}} first {{described}} in 2001, its known distribution has since expanded to Spain, England, Sweden, and Azerbaijan, among other countries. It is similar to the <b>whiskered</b> <b>bat</b> (Myotis mystacinus) and other species and is difficult to distinguish from them. However, its brown fur is distinctive and it is clearly different in characters of its karyotype and DNA sequences. Although some genetic data suggest that it is related to Geoffroy's bat (Myotis emarginatus), other analyses do not support a close relationship between M.alcathoe and any other species.|$|E
500|$|The <b>whiskered</b> <b>bat</b> (Myotis mystacinus) {{and similar}} species in Eurasia (collectively known as [...] "whiskered bats") are {{difficult}} to distinguish from each other; for example, the distantly related Brandt's bat (Myotis brandtii) was not recognized as distinct from M.mystacinus until the 1970s. Small, unusual M.mystacinus-like bats were first recorded in Greece in the 1970s, {{but it was not}} until the advent of genetic studies that these bats could be confirmed as representing a distinct species, named Myotis alcathoe. In 2001, the species was described by German zoologists Otto von Helversen and Klaus-Gerhard Heller on the basis of specimens from Greece and Hungary. Although it also differs from other whiskered bats by morphological characters, Myotis alcathoe is most clearly distinct in its genetics, including DNA sequences and the location of the nucleolus organizer regions. Two studies used microsatellite markers on European whiskered bats: the first one used western European samples and recovered three well-defined species clusters for M. alcathoe, M. brandtii and M. mystacinus; the other one, conducted in Poland, suggesting a high level of hybridization with other whiskered bats that would further complicate attempts to identify M.alcathoe morphologically.|$|E
2500|$|In North America, P.destructans {{has been}} found to infect at least eleven species of bats, of which it has caused {{diagnostic}} symptoms of white-nose syndrome in the endangered Indiana bat (Myotis sodalis), the endangered gray bat (Myotis grisescens), the little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus), the northern long-eared bat (Myotis septentrionalis), the big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus), the tri-colored bat (Perimyotis subflavus), and the eastern small-footed bat (Myotis leibii).

5|$|Myotis alcathoe is the {{smallest}} European Myotis species. The fur is brownish on the upperparts, with a reddish tone in old specimens, and a slightly paler gray-brown below. Younger animals may be completely gray-brown. The brown fur distinguishes adult M.alcathoe from other <b>whiskered</b> <b>bats,</b> but juveniles cannot be unambiguously identified {{on the basis of}} morphology. M.alcathoe is similar to Daubenton's bat (Myotis daubentonii) and M.emarginatus in color. On the upper side of the body, the hairs are 6 to 8mm long and have dark bases and brown tips. The hairs on the lower side of the body are only slightly paler at the tip than at the base.|$|R

5|$|Von Helversen and Heller {{argued that}} none of the old names now {{considered}} synonyms of M.mystacinus could apply to M.alcathoe, because these names all have their type localities in western or central Europe. However, the more recent discovery of M.alcathoe further to the west renders it possible that an older name may be discovered. In addition, Russian researcher Suren Gazaryan has suggested that the name caucasicus Tsytsulina, 2000 (originally proposed for a subspecies of M.mystacinus from the Caucasus) may prove to be applicable to M. alcathoe; in that case, the species would be renamed Myotis caucasicus. The species may have remained undetected in Germany for so long because bat researchers did not sample its preferred habitats and would dismiss unusual-looking <b>whiskered</b> <b>bats</b> as being abnormal M.mystacinus or M.brandtii.|$|R

50|$|Serotine bats mainly use {{buildings}} for summer roosts, especially those older buildings with high gables and cavity walls, and often occur in churches; modern buildings are used infrequently. The roost is normally accessed {{at or near}} the gable apex or the lower eaves. The serotine bat is hardly ever found in trees, which were the most likely pre-human roost sites, and the species seems to be very oriented towards using buildings. The roost is sometimes shared with pipistrelles or brown long-eared bats, and this species has also been recorded associating with Natterer's <b>bats,</b> <b>whiskered</b> <b>bats</b> and noctule bats. Only a few serotine bats have been found in winter, but it seems likely that most hibernate in buildings in cavity walls and disused chimneys. There are a few records of them being found in the coldest parts of caves, either in roof crevices or in accumulations of boulders.|$|R

40|$|Toxic metals are bioaccumulated by insectivorous mammals but {{few studies}} (none from Britain) have {{quantified}} residues in bats.

40|$|During {{late summer}} and early autumn in {{temperate}} zones of the Northern Hemisphere, thousands of bats gather at caves, mainly {{for the purpose of}} mating. We demonstrated that this swarming behavior most probably leads not only to breeding among bats of the same species but also interbreeding between different species. Using 14 nuclear microsatellites and three different methods (the Bayesian assignment approaches of STRUCTURE and NEWHYBRIDS and a principal coordinate analysis of pairwise genetic distances), we analyzed 375 individuals belonging to three species of <b>whiskered</b> <b>bats</b> (genus Myotis) at swarming sites across their sympatric range in southern Poland. The overall hybridization rate varied from 3. 2 to 7. 2 %. At the species level, depending on the method used, these values ranged from 2. 1 - 4. 6 % in M. mystacinus and 3. 0 - 3. 7 % in M. brandtii to 6. 5 - 30. 4 % in M. alcathoe. Hybrids occurred in about half of the caves we studied. In all three species, the sex ratio of hybrids was biased towards males but the observed differences did not differ statistically from those noted at the population level. In our opinion, factors leading to the formation of these admixed individuals and their relatively high frequency are: i) swarming behaviour at swarming sites, where high numbers of bats belonging to several species meet; ii) male-biased sex ratio during the swarming period; iii) the fact that all these bats are generally polygynous. The highly different population sizes of different species at swarming sites may also play some role. Swarming sites may represent unique hybrid hotspots, which, as there are at least 2, 000 caves in the Polish Carpathians alone, may occur on a massive scale not previously observed for any group of mammal species in the wild. Evidently, these sites should be treated as focal points for the conservation of biodiversity and evolutionary processes...|$|R
