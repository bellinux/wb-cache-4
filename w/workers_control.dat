40|$|While Chinese {{experiments}} with participative management practices in industry comprise {{perhaps the most}} radical and massive such effort in the modern world, they are still among the least understood in the West. The present article {{is an effort to}} define more clearly the boundaries of worker participation in China and the limits of <b>worker</b> <b>control.</b> Through brief, but strategic comparisons with forms of <b>worker</b> <b>control</b> in different political and economic settings, and through critical scrutiny of the various participative forms employed in China, this article attempts to sketch out the configuration of participation and control in Chinese collective forms, and to place them in a broader context of organizations exhibiting "collectivist-democratic" features. We offer (1) an examination of the political considerations which have shaped these experiments; (2) an account of Party organization and how its control is exercised; (3) an outline of the limits on <b>worker</b> <b>control</b> imposed by China's industrial planning system; and (4) a description and critical analysis of the major participative forms employed in Chinese industry from 1956 to the present...|$|R
50|$|Anarchy was an anarchist monthly {{magazine}} {{produced in}} London from March 1961 until December 1970.

The magazine included articles on anarchism and reflections on current events from an anarchist perspective, e.g. <b>workers</b> <b>control,</b> criminology, squatting.|$|E
50|$|In Apoica flavissima nests, workers {{appear to}} have {{behavioral}} control. This {{may be caused by}} the low relatedness between females or the distinct morphological caste differences. Workers have been observed to behaviorally police the queen's reproductive output by biting and harassing her. In large nests with multiple queens, workers have even been known to remove queens from the nest. These conflicts indicate that the <b>workers</b> <b>control</b> the reproductive output of the nest.|$|E

40|$|Studies of sex-ratio {{conflict}} in the eusocial Hymeno-ptera (ants, bees and wasps) have provided the most rigorous tests of kin selection theory. The hymeno-pteran haplodiploid system of sex determination gener-ally renders workers {{more closely related to}} their sisters than to their brothers, whereas queens are equally related to their sons and daughters. Kin selec-tion theory therefore predicts that resource allocation into male or female reproductives is a source of queen– worker (i. e. parent–offspring) conflict. Under the tra-ditional assumption of <b>worker</b> <b>control,</b> sex ratios should evolve towards female bias, shifting away from the optimum of the queen, an even sex ratio. Three decades of research on sex-ratio conflict largely supported <b>worker</b> <b>control,</b> but recent studies have revealed queen...|$|R

5000|$|In July 2015, {{researchers}} {{announced that}} a vaccine trial in Guinea had been completed that appeared to give protection from the virus. The vaccine, rVSV-ZEBOV, had shown 100% efficacy in individuals, but more conclusive evidence was needed regarding its capacity to protect populations through [...] "herd immunity" [...] The vaccine trial employed [...] "ring vaccination", a technique that was also used in the 1970s to eradicate smallpox, in which health <b>workers</b> <b>control</b> an outbreak by vaccinating all suspected infected individuals within the surrounding area.|$|E
5000|$|On 26 January 1918, the {{day after}} {{assuming}} executive power, Lenin wrote Draft Regulations on Workers' Control, which granted <b>workers</b> <b>control</b> of businesses with more than five workers and office employees, and access to all books, documents and stocks, and whose decisions were to be [...] "binding upon {{the owners of the}} enterprises". Governing through the elected soviets, and in alliance with the peasant-based Left Socialist-Revolutionaries, the Bolshevik government began nationalising banks and industry, and disavowed the national debts of the deposed Romanov royal régime. It sued for peace, withdrawing from World War I, and convoked a Constituent Assembly in which the peasant Socialist-Revolutionary Party (SR) won a majority.|$|E
5000|$|Marxists further {{argue that}} due to {{economic}} inequality, the purchase of labor cannot occur under [...] "free" [...] conditions. Since capitalists control {{the means of production}} (e.g., factories, businesses, machinery) and <b>workers</b> <b>control</b> only their labor, the worker is naturally coerced into allowing their labor to be exploited. Critics argue that exploitation occurs even if the exploited consents, since the definition of exploitation is independent of consent. In essence, workers must allow their labor to be exploited or face starvation. Since some degree of unemployment is typical in modern economies, Marxists argue that wages are naturally driven down in free market systems. Hence, even if a worker contests their wages, capitalists are able to find someone from the reserve army of labor who is more desperate.|$|E

30|$|The ideal job {{variable}} {{may be an}} evaluative {{measure of}} job satisfaction, i.e., one that encompasses meaningful work and creativity at work, rather than the day-to-day satisfaction/dissatisfaction with the work one does. Therefore, this dimension may in part be reflective of older <b>worker’s</b> <b>control</b> over their work.|$|R
5000|$|Alternately, in Schweickart’s model, <b>workers</b> <b>control</b> the workplace, {{but they}} do not [...] "own" [...] the means of production. Productive {{resources}} are regarded as the collective property of the society. Workers run the enterprise, use its capital assets as they see fit, and distribute the profits among themselves. Here, societal [...] "ownership" [...] of the enterprise manifests itself in two ways: 1) All firms pay tax on their capital assets, which goes into society's investment fund. In effect, workers rent capital assets from society. 2) Firms are required to preserve the value of the capital stock entrusted to them. This means that a depreciation fund must be maintained to repair or replace existing capital stock. This money may be spent on capital replacements or improvements, but not to supplement workers' incomes.|$|E
5000|$|In October 2011, the Saudi Labour Ministry put a [...] "ceiling" [...] on {{the number}} of guest workers at 20% of the Saudi population, {{requiring}} a reduction of foreign population by up to three million over several years.In March 2013, a campaign was initiated to [...] "get rid of its illegal foreign <b>workers,</b> <b>control</b> the legal ones", and lower native-born Saudi unemployment. Approximately one million Bangladeshis, Indians, Filipinos, Nepalis, Pakistanis and Yemenis left between the campaign's beginning and the deadline (November 4, 2013), with authorities planning to expel another one million illegal foreigners in 2014. Ethiopians were a particular target of the campaign, with thousands expelled. Various Human Rights entities have criticised Saudi Arabia's handling of the issue. Prior to this workers were sometimes not hired or expelled as a way of registering Saudi disapproval of the workers' country. Saudi Arabia expelled 800,000 Yemenis in 1990 and 1991 during the Gulf War due to Yemen's support for Saddam Hussein against Saudi Arabia, and cut the number of Bangladeshis allowed to enter Saudi in 2013 after the Bangladeshi government cracked down on the Islamist Jamaat-e Islami party there.|$|E
5000|$|While IMG members largely {{remained}} in the Labour party, including Charlie van Gelderen, International marked a break from deep entrism. Its first issue claimed that [...] "The Week was brought out in the expectation that a mass left would arise in the Labour party once labour was in power. Its main function was that of an organiser and co-ordinator ... but {{this will be a}} by-product of the main function of International: the creation of a firm marxist core in the labour movement." [...] Its campaigning was focussed on broader initiatives such as the Vietnam Solidarity Campaign and Russell Tribunal, in which Ernie Tate was prominent and in which the RSL and Socialist Labour League did not work, the Institute for <b>Workers</b> <b>Control</b> and the Revolutionary Socialist Students Front, in which Peter Gowan and Murray Smith were active. The agitational work of The Week was carried on in The Black Dwarf and in Socialist Woman, launched in 1969. The Group gained some public prominence when Tariq Ali, who had joined in April 1968, was widely publicised in the media as a leader of protests against the Vietnam War.|$|E
40|$|This is {{the first}} paper to {{identify}} the correlates of workplace managers' perceptions of {{the health and safety}} risks faced by workers {{and the degree to which}} <b>workers</b> have <b>control</b> over those risks. The risks workers face and the control they have over those risks are weakly negatively correlated. Managerial risk ratings are positively associated with both injury and illness rates, but not with absence rates. The control rating is also positively associated with injury and illness rates, but it is negatively correlated with absence rates. Workers are more likely to be exposed to health and safety risks when their workplace is performing poorly and where it has been adversely affected by the recession. Union density is positively associated with risks but is not associated with <b>worker</b> <b>control</b> over risks. Having on-site worker representatives dealing with health and safety is linked to lower risks than direct consultation between management and employees over health and safety. However, there is no evidence that particular types of health and safety arrangement are related to <b>worker</b> <b>control</b> over health and safety risks...|$|R
