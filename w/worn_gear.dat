40|$|Effective {{repair of}} worn big gear has large {{influence}} on ensuring safety production and enhancing economic benefits. A kind of intelligent repair welding method was put forward mainly {{aimed at the}} big gear restriction conditions of high production cost, long production cycle and high- intensity artificial repair welding work. Big gear repair welding mechanism was designed in this paper. The work principle and part selection of big gear repair welding mechanism was introduced. The three dimensional mode of big gear repair welding mechanism was constructed by Pro/E three dimensional design software. Three dimensional motions can be realized by motor controlling ball screw. According to involute gear feature, the complicated curve motion on curved gear surface can be transformed to linear motion by orientation. By this way, the repair welding on <b>worn</b> <b>gear</b> area can be realized. In the design of big gear repair welding mechanism control system, Siemens S 7 - 200 series hardware was chosen. Siemens STEP 7 programming software was chosen as system design tool. The entire repair welding process was simulated by experiment simulation. It provides a kind of practical and feasible method for the intelligent repair welding of big <b>worn</b> <b>gear.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|With the {{continuous}} development of national economy, big gear was widely applied in metallurgy and mine domains. So, big gear {{plays an important}} role in above domains. In practical production, big gear abrasion and breach take place often. It affects normal production and causes unnecessary economic loss. A kind of intelligent test method was put forward on worn big gear mainly aimed at the big gear restriction conditions of high production cost, long production cycle and high- intensity artificial repair welding work. The measure equations transformations were made on involute straight gear. Original polar coordinate equations were transformed into rectangular coordinate equations. Big gear abrasion measure principle was introduced. Detection principle diagram was given. Detection route realization method was introduced. OADM 12 laser sensor was selected. Detection on big gear abrasion area was realized by detection mechanism. Tested data of unworn gear and <b>worn</b> <b>gear</b> were led in designed calculation program written by Visual Basic language. Big gear abrasion quantity can be obtained. It provides a feasible method for intelligent test and intelligent repair welding on worn big gear. ...|$|E

Using the laser scanning measuring system, through the reverse digital, point cloud pre-processing technology, matched 3 D CAD model of the impaired standard involute gear. Through point cloud alignment theory and method of gear damage, made the alignment analysis for the CAD model before wear and after, and the quantitative analysis of wear layer is achieved.

40|$|The {{challenging}} {{issue for}} mechanical industry {{is to develop}} fast & reliable fault diagnosis systems before total breakdown of machine. Fault diagnosis & classification of faults of mechanical systems is a difficult task. It improves productivity & reduces cost of production. This paper presents an approach for classification of commonly observed faults in gears of mechanical system. These faults include <b>weared</b> <b>gear,</b> gear with one tooth broken & gear with crack on one tooth. The Power Spectral Density (PSD) of the vibration signals of faulty gears is used to construct feature vectors. Principle component analysis (PCA) is used to reduce the dimensions of feature vector. The Routine checkup of the machine generates Known fault vectors. The ISODATA (Iterative Self Organizing Data Analysis Technique) [1] classifies fault vectors along with newly collected fault vector. If the fault {{is different from the}} previously identified fault a new fault cluster is created else new fault belongs to one of previously identified fault clusters...|$|R
