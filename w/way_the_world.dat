5|$|Mr. Bean {{often seems}} unaware of basic {{aspects of the}} <b>way</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> works, and the {{programme}} usually features his attempts at what would normally be considered simple activities, such as going swimming, using a television set, interior decorating, or going to church. The humour largely comes from his original (and often absurd) solutions to problems and his total disregard for others when solving them, his pettiness, and occasional malevolence.|$|E
25|$|According to the theory, {{accommodation}} is {{the process}} of reframing one's mental representation of the external world to fit new experiences. Accommodation can be understood as the mechanism by which failure leads to learning: when we act on the expectation that the world operates in one way and it violates our expectations, we often fail, but by accommodating this new experience and reframing our model of the <b>way</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> works, we learn from the experience of failure, or others' failure.|$|E
25|$|While Ethical Culturists {{generally}} {{share common}} beliefs {{about what constitutes}} ethical behavior and the good, individuals are encouraged {{to develop their own}} personal understanding of these ideas. This does not mean that Ethical Culturists condone moral relativism, which would relegate ethics to mere preferences or social conventions. Ethical principles are viewed as being related to deep truths about the <b>way</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> works, and hence not arbitrary. However, it is recognized that complexities render the understanding of ethical nuances subject to continued dialogue, exploration, and learning.|$|E

25|$|The Norton Anthology {{followed}} {{in the footsteps of}} similar ventures devoted to women's literature and African-American literature. It was greeted with an enthusiastic reception. Booklist gave it a starred review. It was noted in, among other places, The Boston Globe, Smithsonian, the American Book Review, World Literature Today, Literal, and NPR’s On Point with Tom Ashbrook. Erica Jong said “Ilan Stavans has spread a feast of Latino literature before us.” Cornel West called it ”an instant classic.” And Felipe Fernández-Armesto of University of Notre Dame stated: “Imaginatively conceived, painstakingly executed, stunningly broad, profoundly stirring, endlessly engaging, this book can change the <b>way</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> thinks about America and the way Americans think about themselves.” However, it was criticized for its subjective approach, including few authors born in Central America.|$|E

500|$|The title [...] "The Holy Bible" [...] {{was chosen}} by Edwards to reflect an idea, {{according}} to Bradfield, that [...] "everything on {{there has to be}} perfection". Interviewed at the end of 1994, Edwards said: [...] "The way religions choose to speak their truth to the public has always been to beat them down [...] I think that if a Holy Bible is true, it should be about the <b>way</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> is and that's what I think my lyrics are about.

500|$|Putnam has {{clarified}} {{that his}} real target in this argument was never skepticism, but metaphysical realism. Since realism {{of this kind}} assumes {{the existence of a}} gap between how man conceives the world and the <b>way</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> really is, skeptical scenarios such as this one (or Descartes' Evil demon) present a formidable challenge. Putnam, by arguing that such a scenario is impossible, attempts to show that this notion of a gap between man's concept {{of the world and the}} way it is, is in itself absurd. Man cannot have a [...] "God's eye" [...] view of reality. He is limited to his conceptual schemes. Metaphysical realism is therefore false, according to Putnam.|$|E
500|$|Miller also {{aimed to}} imbue the novel {{with a sense}} of anxiety, {{especially}} concerning the decisions Jean-Baptiste must take. Commenting on fiction in general in an interview with Lorna Bradbury for The Daily Telegraph, Miller stated that [...] "a novel is a collection of anxieties held together, more or less well, more or less interestingly, by the chicken wire of plot". Bradbury goes on to state [...] "that is absolutely the case with Pure, which details multiple counts of insanity as the panic-inducing business of razing the cemetery takes hold". Of Pure specifically, Miller stated that [...] "I'm interested in what anxiety does to people", [...] "in what happens when they can't respond the <b>way</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> expects them to. What happens when our sense of ourselves falls away under the pressure of circumstances? What's left? That's a very interesting place to be." ...|$|E

Gaiman eventually agreed to write a Marvel comic in August 2001, although he was not sure what it would contain. When the September 11, 2001 attacks occurred, Gaiman decided {{that he did not want}} planes, skyscrapers, bombs or guns in his comic. [...] "I didn't want it to be a war story, and I didn't want to write a story in which might made right – or in which might made anything." [...] On a trip to Venice soon after, Gaiman was struck by how the [...] "past seemed very close at hand"; he returned from the trip knowing the story he wanted to tell. The time was chosen because [...] "it was a nice place to set the story. It gave me America and it gave me a lot of things that I wanted in terms of the <b>way</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> was changing. It also gave me the sense of wonder and magic." ...|$|E
500|$|Introspectively, {{the world}} of {{conscious}} experience seems to have considerable structure. [...] Immanuel Kant asserted that {{the world as we}} perceive it is organized according to a set of fundamental [...] "intuitions", which include object (we perceive the world as a set of distinct things); shape; quality (color, warmth, etc.); space (distance, direction, and location); and time. Some of these constructs, such as space and time, correspond to the <b>way</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> is structured by the laws of physics; for others the correspondence is not as clear. Understanding the physical basis of qualities, such as redness or pain, has been particularly challenging. David Chalmers has called this the hard problem of consciousness. Some philosophers have argued that it is intrinsically unsolvable, because qualities ("qualia") are ineffable; that is, they are [...] "raw feels", incapable of being analyzed into component processes. Other psychologists and neuroscientists reject these arguments. For example, research on ideasthesia shows that qualia are organised into a semantic-like network. Nevertheless, {{it is clear that the}} relationship between a physical entity such as light and a perceptual quality such as color is extraordinarily complex and indirect, as demonstrated by a variety of optical illusions such as neon color spreading.|$|E

Daughter of an important parliamentarian father (a former government minister), and a Flaubert-quoting mother, Paloma has a penchant for absurdism. She regards her sister's scholarship as [...] "cold and trivial" [...] and deems her mother's culture as conventional and useless. Paloma herself values Japanese works, and reads manga, haiku, and tanka. She keeps two diaries, one called [...] "Journal of the Movement of the World" [...] to record her observations of the world around her, and the other called [...] "Profound Thoughts" [...] to record her many and wide-ranging reflections on art, poetry, people and herself. She is introspective, and truly kind, though she tries her best to avoid the inquisition of others. She understands many facets of the world that are unseen by others, and deeply [...] understand the <b>way</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> works, and the many perils and pitfalls of adulthood and the many hypocrisies of modern society, and therefore resolves in not an all melodramatic way, to commit suicide. However, a drastic plot twist {{at the end of the}} tale opens to her an amazing new truth: beauty, that provides meaning to our lives.|$|E

500|$|Through continual reinvention, his {{influence}} broadened and extended. Biographer Thomas Forget added, [...] "Because he {{has succeeded in}} so many different styles of music, {{it is almost impossible to}} find a popular artist today that has not been influenced by David Bowie." [...] In 2000, Bowie was voted by other music stars as the [...] "most influential artist of all time" [...] in a poll by NME. Alexis Petridis of The Guardian wrote that Bowie was confirmed by 1980 to be [...] "the most important and influential artist since the Beatles". Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph stated that Bowie had [...] "one of the supreme careers in popular music, art and culture of the 20th century" [...] and [...] "he was too inventive, too mercurial, too strange for all but his most devoted fans to keep up with". The BBC's Mark Easton argued that Bowie provided fuel for [...] "the creative powerhouse that Britain has become" [...] by challenging future generations [...] "to aim high, to be ambitious and provocative, to take risks". Easton concluded that Bowie had [...] "changed the <b>way</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> sees Britain. And the way Britain sees itself". Annie Zaleski of Alternative Press wrote, [...] "Every band or solo artist who's decided to rip up their playbook and start again owes a debt to Bowie".|$|E
500|$|Then little-known newsman Dan Rather {{reported}} {{live from}} {{the second floor of}} a building in Texas City during the storm, an act that would be imitated by later reporters. This marked the first live television broadcast of a hurricane. Rather also alerted the public of the size of Carla in a way that [...] "literally changed the <b>way</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> sees hurricanes", according to a fellow reporter. Broadcasting live at the Weather Bureau Office in Galveston, Rather asked a meteorologist to draw an outline of the Gulf of Mexico on a transparent sheet of plastic. He then held the map over the black and white radar screen, which put the size of Carla into perspective, saying that Carla was the size of the Gulf of Mexico. CBS was so impressed with Rather's work that he was offered the position of correspondent. Throughout Texas, Carla destroyed 1,915homes, 568farm buildings, and 415other buildings. Additionally, 50,723homes, 5,620farm buildings, and 10,487other buildings suffered damage. There were 460injuries according to the American Red Cross, though the Monthly Weather Review listed a slightly higher number, 465. The storm caused 34fatalities in Texas. Causes of death include 20people drowning, eight from tornadoes, four electrocutions, and one heart attack. Overall, damage in the state was [...] "conservatively" [...] estimated at $300million. A breakdown of damage indicates $200million incurred to property and $100million to crops, mostly from unharvested rice and lesser impact to cotton and citrus.|$|E
500|$|In 2005 David Crane {{published}} a new Scott biography {{in which he}} comes to the conclusion that Scott is possibly the only figure in polar history except Lawrence Oates [...] "so wholly obscured by legend". According to Barczewski, he goes some way towards an assessment of Scott [...] "free from the baggage of earlier interpretations". What has happened to Scott's reputation, Crane argues, derives from the <b>way</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> has changed since the [...] "hopeless heroism and obscene waste" [...] of the First World War. At the time of Scott's death, people clutched at the proof he gave that the qualities that once made Britain great were not extinct, but with the knowledge what lay only two years ahead, the ideals of duty, self-sacrifice, discipline, patriotism and hierarchy associated with his tragedy take on a different and more sinister colouring. Crane's main achievement, according to Barczewski, is the restoration of Scott's humanity, [...] "far more effectively than either Fiennes's stridency or Solomon's scientific data." [...] Daily Telegraph columnist Jasper Rees, likening the changes in explorers' reputations to climatic variations, suggests that [...] "in the current Antarctic weather report, Scott is enjoying his first spell in the sun for twenty-five years". The New York Times Book Review was more critical, pointing out Crane's support for Scott's account regarding the circumstances of the freeing of the Discovery from the pack ice, and concluded that [...] "For all the many attractions of his book, David Crane offers no answers that convincingly exonerate Scott from a significant share of responsibility for his own demise." ...|$|E

[...] For 15-year-old rockers in the white neighborhoods of 1979 Chicagoland, ... the chance to yell [...] "disco sucks" [...] meant more than simply a musical style choice.

500|$|Much of {{the game}} {{takes place in the}} Time-Twisting Machine, which allows the {{characters}} to travel to different periods in time. The levels that take place in the Middle Ages are populated by wizards, rams, knights and frogs that transform into princes upon being kissed. The prehistoric levels take place in a Jurassic swamp and feature a Tyrannosaurus hatchling that can be mounted and ridden, restless pterodactyls and a gigantic triceratops that pursues Crash throughout the level. The Arabian levels take place on the rooftops and are overrun with swordsmen, scorpions and genies who seek to stuff Crash into their lamps. The Egyptian levels are set during the heyday of the Great Pyramids and are populated by mummies, pyramid construction crews, scarabs and cobras; in addition to the various enemies, the tombs are also overrun with traps. The future levels take place in [...] "Neo York", a city under Cortex's rule that features laser cannons, robots, flying saucers, force fields and moving platforms. The [...] "Lost Highway" [...] levels, in which Crash pilots a motorcycle, take place in a 1950s America highway, where Crash must race against Cortex's hot rodders to win Crystals, avoiding construction barricades and cops along the <b>way.</b> <b>The</b> <b>World</b> War I levels take place in the skies of Europe and alternatively feature Crash and Coco as the player character. In these levels, Cortex's fleet of dirigibles must be shot down to obtain the Crystal. The Atlantis levels feature Crash in scuba gear who must find the Crystals in the Atlantean ruins, which are rife with sharks, depth charges and poisonous blowfish. Another water-themed group of levels take place during the Golden Age of Piracy and feature Coco as the player character, who must ride a jetski and gather the Crystals {{on the surface of the}} water, avoiding pirates and water mines as she does so. The Great Wall of China levels feature Coco as the player character and are played riding on the back of a tiger cub while avoiding doddery pan carriers and Chinese dragons.
