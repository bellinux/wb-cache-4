5|$|Morphological {{studies have}} been {{inconclusive}} about the evolutionary relationships of the tasselled <b>wobbegong,</b> but overall have gauged it {{to be among the}} more derived <b>wobbegong</b> (Orectolobidae) species. A 2009 phylogenetic analysis based on mitochondrial and nuclear DNA found otherwise, that this species was in fact basal to all other wobbegongs except the northern <b>wobbegong</b> (O. wardi). This result supports the synonymization of Eucrossorhinus with Orectolobus. Molecular clock estimation placed the speciation of the tasselled <b>wobbegong</b> at 11–6 Ma, coinciding with a period of significant geological rearrangement and the formation of coral reef habitats in the region.|$|E
5|$|Dutch {{ichthyologist}} Pieter Bleeker originally {{described the}} tasselled <b>wobbegong</b> in an 1867 volume of Archives Néerlandaises des Sciences Exactes et Naturelles. His account {{was based on}} two Indonesian specimens, one caught off Waigeo and the other off Aru. He gave it the name dasypogon, from the Greek dasys ("hairy") and pogon ("beard"), and assigned it to the genus Crossorhinus (a synonym of Orectolobus). In 1908, Charles Tate Regan created the new genus Eucrossorhinus for this species, derived from the Greek eu ("good"), krossoi ("tassel") and rhinos ("nose"). Regan subsequently reconsidered the main trait he used to separate Eucrossorhinus (the spacing of {{the fourth and fifth}} gill slits) and synonymized it with Orectolobus. Later authors have placed the tasselled <b>wobbegong</b> either in its own genus or in Orectolobus. Other common names for this species are bearded <b>wobbegong</b> and Ogilby's <b>wobbegong.</b>|$|E
5|$|During the day, {{the solitary}} tasselled <b>wobbegong</b> can {{generally}} be found lying inside caves or under ledges with its tail curled. Individual sharks tend to remain within a local area and have favored resting spots. While resting, it opportunistically ambushes nearby fishes and invertebrates, and also lures in prey by waving its tail {{to mimic the}} appearance of a small fish. At night, it emerges and actively forages for food. This species is aplacental viviparous, though little is known of its life history. The tasselled <b>wobbegong</b> has been reported to bite and kill humans unprovoked; attacks may result from people accidentally disturbing the shark or being misperceived as prey. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species as Near Threatened, as outside of Australia it is threatened by fisheries and habitat degradation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Wobbegongs</b> {{are well}} camouflaged with a {{symmetrical}} pattern of bold markings which resembles a carpet. Because of this striking pattern, <b>wobbegongs</b> and their close relatives are {{often referred to}} as carpet sharks. The camouflage is improved by the presence of small weed-like whisker lobes surrounding the <b>wobbegong's</b> jaw, which help to camouflage it and act as sensory barbs. <b>Wobbegongs</b> make use of their relative invisibility to hide among rocks and catch smaller fish which swim too close, typical of ambush predators.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Wobbegongs</b> are {{generally}} not dangerous to humans. However, they have bitten people who accidentally stepped on them in shallow water or scuba divers who have poked or touched them. Unprovoked, they may also bite divers, surfers, or snorkellers who swim near their hiding spots. [...] <b>Wobbegongs</b> are very flexible and can easily bite a hand holding onto their tail.|$|R
5|$|Orectolobiformes: They are {{commonly}} referred to as the carpet sharks, including zebra sharks, nurse sharks, <b>wobbegongs,</b> and the whale shark.|$|R
5|$|The tasselled <b>wobbegong</b> {{has little}} {{economic}} value, though its attractive skin is occasionally used for leather. In Australian waters, {{it is not}} fished and faces minimal threats. However, elsewhere in its range it may be negatively affected by extensive fishery activity and habitat degradation from pollution, blast fishing, and coral removal. Because of these concerns, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Least Concern.|$|E
25|$|Several turtle {{species and}} the frogmouth catfish have tongue {{extensions}} that lure prey {{to a position}} where they become an easy catch. In caudal luring the predator uses tail movements to attract prey. This form of mimicry is used by several snake and lizard species, as well by as the tasselled <b>wobbegong</b> shark.|$|E
25|$|As {{shown in}} the picture, Japanese painter Kawahara Keiga made a pencil drawn and water colored {{painting}} of the broadnose sevengill shark between 1823 and 1829 and is displayed at the Naturalis Biodiversity Center but no further information about this is known. In the 1860s, Swiss-Australian painter Frederick Schoenfeld also painted the shark in a work he made along with the ornate <b>wobbegong.</b>|$|E
50|$|This 13000 gal L tank houses shark {{species that}} inhabit {{tropical}} reef habitats, including blacktip reef sharks, brownbanded bamboo sharks, Port Jackson sharks, and <b>wobbegongs.</b> Interpretive panels on shark biology and conservation accompany the reef.|$|R
5|$|Some seabed–dwelling {{species are}} highly {{effective}} ambush predators. Angel sharks and <b>wobbegongs</b> use camouflage {{to lie in}} wait and suck prey into their mouths. Many benthic sharks feed solely on crustaceans which they crush with their flat molariform teeth.|$|R
50|$|Northern <b>wobbegongs</b> are {{excellent}} aquarium sharks {{due to their}} small (30 inch) adult size. They can be successfully reared in 135 gallon aquaria, but sharks in general tend to do better in aquaria 180 gallons or more in volume.|$|R
25|$|Sharks inhabit all {{the coastal}} waters and estuarine {{habitats}} of Australia's coast. There are 166 species, including 30 species of requiem shark, 32 of catshark, six of <b>wobbegong</b> shark, and 40 of dogfish shark. There are three species {{from the family}} Heterodontidae: the Port Jackson shark, the zebra bullhead shark and the crested bullhead shark. In 2004, there were 12 unprovoked shark attacks in Australia, of which two were fatal. Only 3 species of shark pose a significant threat to humans: the bull shark, the tiger shark and the great white shark. Some popular beaches in Queensland and New South Wales are protected by shark netting, a method that has reduced the population of both dangerous and harmless shark species through accidental entanglement. The overfishing of sharks has also significantly reduced shark numbers in Australian waters, and several species are now endangered. A megamouth shark was found on a Perth beach in 1988; very {{little is known about}} this species, but this discovery may indicate the presence of the species in Australian coastal waters.|$|E
500|$|With several {{records of}} {{apparently}} unprovoked attacks on people, the tasselled <b>wobbegong</b> {{has a reputation}} beyond other wobbegongs for aggressive behavior. Gilbert Whitley even wrote in 1940 that it [...] "attacks and generally kills the natives" [...] of Papua New Guinea. Though Whitley's claim is questionable, this species is certainly capable of inflicting severe wounds. Conversely, the tasselled <b>wobbegong</b> is also an ecotourism attraction and many divers have approached it without incident. Given this shark's cryptic appearance and poor vision, humans should exercise caution to avoid accidentally harassing it or causing it to mistake a hand or foot for prey. This species adapts well to captivity and is occasionally found in the home aquarium trade.|$|E
500|$|The tasselled <b>wobbegong</b> {{feeds on}} bony and {{cartilaginous}} fishes, crustaceans, and cephalopods. Its capacious mouth allows sizeable prey to be swallowed, with one documented {{case of a}} [...] long individual consuming a [...] long brownbanded bamboo shark (Chiloscyllium punctatum). During daytime, this species is an opportunistic ambush predator. It preys upon schooling nocturnal fishes such as squirrelfishes, soldierfishes, and sweepers that often shelter in the same cave. Tiny fishes and crustaceans have been seen settling atop the resting wobbegong's head, attracting larger fishes that are in turn attacked by the <b>wobbegong.</b> Observations in captivity have further revealed that this species seems to engage in active luring behavior. When it perceives food nearby, it begins to slowly wave its tail back and forth; its caudal fin resembles a small fish, complete with a dark eyespot at the base. The shark typically rests with its head elevated, which places it {{within striking distance of}} any prey drawn by its tail.|$|E

40|$|Demersal {{elasmobranchs}} are ecologically important mesopredators {{but little}} is known about their population connectivity or dispersal patterns. Here we use a comparative approach based on mitochondrial DNA and nuclear amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers to examine spatial genetic structure and dispersal in three closely related demersal elasmobranchs from eastern Australia: Orectolobus halei, Orectolobus maculatus, and Orectolobus ornatus. We found evidence of significant spatial genetic structure, possibly indicating regional philopatry in <b>wobbegongs.</b> The molecular data also indicate that dispersal in <b>wobbegongs</b> may be sex-biased. This represents the first genetic study of dispersal and population connectivity in codistributed demersal sharks. It provides insights into the ecology of dispersal behaviours with implications for conservation management of demersal species. 10 page(s...|$|R
50|$|Most carpet sharks feed on {{the seabed}} in shallow to medium-depth waters, {{detecting}} and picking up molluscs and crustaceans and other small creatures. The <b>wobbegongs</b> tend to be ambush predators, lying hidden on the seabed until prey approaches. One has been observed swallowing a bamboo shark whole.|$|R
500|$|The {{range of}} the tasselled <b>wobbegong</b> {{encompasses}} the continental shelf of northern Australia from Ningaloo Reef {{in the west to}} Bundaberg in the east, as well as New Guinea, Waigeo, and the Aru Islands. Additional records from Malaysia are unconfirmed. This common bottom-dweller inhabits coral reefs, perhaps exclusively, in both inshore and offshore waters from the intertidal zone to around [...] deep. It is most often encountered in reef channels and faces, or atop coral heads.|$|E
500|$|The {{tapeworm}} Parachristianella monomegacantha is a known parasite of the tasselled <b>wobbegong.</b> This {{species has}} been observed being attended by cleaner shrimp (Leander urocaridella, Stenopus hispidus) and bluestreak cleaner wrasse (Labroides dimidiatus). Reproduction is presumably aplacental viviparous like other wobbegongs, with the developing embryos sustained by yolk. There is a report of mating being observed inside a cave at night. Newborns measure approximately [...] long. Size at sexual maturity is uncertain; one recorded male {{was found to be}} adult at [...] long.|$|E
500|$|The tasselled <b>wobbegong</b> (Eucrossorhinus dasypogon) is {{a species}} of carpet shark in the family Orectolobidae and {{the only member of}} its genus. It inhabits shallow coral reefs off {{northern}} Australia, New Guinea, and adjacent islands. Reaching [...] in length, this species has a broad and flattened body and head. Its most distinctive trait is a fringe of branching dermal flaps around its head, which extends onto its chin. The fringe, along with its complex color pattern of small blotches and reticulations, enable it to camouflage itself against the reef environment.|$|E
50|$|A {{spiracle}} is a {{small hole}} found behind each eye. These can be tiny and circular, such as found on the nurse shark (Ginglymostoma cirratum), to extended and slit-like, such as found on the <b>wobbegongs</b> (Orectolobidae). Many larger, pelagic species, such as the mackerel sharks (Lamnidae) and the thresher sharks (Alopiidae), no longer possess them.|$|R

500|$|The {{pectoral}} and pelvic fins {{are large}} and rounded. The dorsal fins are short-based and fairly tall; the first is slightly larger than the second and originates over the latter quarter of the pelvic fin bases. Behind the pelvic fins, the body rapidly tapers to the short caudal peduncle. The anal fin originates behind {{the midpoint of the}} second dorsal fin and is no more than half its size. The caudal fin is short, with no lower lobe and an upper lobe bearing a strong ventral notch near the tip. This species has a mosaic-like dorsal color pattern consisting of numerous small, dark blotches and lines on a gray- or yellow-brown background; there may also be darker bands. The pattern extends to the underside of the tail and the ventral pectoral and pelvic fin margins. The ventral surface is otherwise white. The tasselled <b>wobbegong</b> is reliably known to reach a length of [...] Most authors consider an older record of a [...] long individual to be erroneous.|$|E
500|$|The tasselled <b>wobbegong</b> {{is a very}} broad, {{moderately}} flattened shark. The head is {{wider than}} long, with a distinctive fringe of branching dermal lobes running almost continuously from the snout tip to {{the origins of the}} pectoral fins, including a [...] "beard" [...] on the chin. The nostrils bear long, branching barbels, and have grooves surrounding them and connecting them to the mouth. There are tubercles above the eyes but not elsewhere, and behind the eyes are larger spiracles. The large mouth is positioned ahead of the eyes, almost {{at the end of the}} head. There are furrows on the lower jaw extending from the mouth corners and along the jaw median. There are 23–26 upper and 19 lower tooth rows; each tooth has a single slender, pointed cusp. The three upper and two lower rows of symphysial (central) teeth are especially long and fang-like. The five pairs of gill slits are short.|$|E
2500|$|The Cape Byron Marine Park {{has more}} than 530 {{recorded}} fish species. However, there are several species which are in decline and or threatened which are protected under the Fisheries Management Act 1994. These include the Bleekers devil fish (Paraplesiops bleekeri), estuary cod (Epinephelus coioides), threatened black cod (Epinephelus daemelii) and the giant Queensland groper (Epinephelus lanceolatus). The spotted <b>wobbegong</b> (Orectolobus maculatus) and banded <b>wobbegong</b> (Orectolobus ornatus) have been recorded to be in decline while the great white shark (Carcharhinus carcharias) has been listed as vulnerable under the Fisheries Management Act 1994. The Grey nurse shark (Carcharius taurus) has also been listed under the Fisheries Management Act 1994 (NSW DPI 1994) [...] as an endangered species and defined by the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Act 1999 [...] as critically endangered with fears that there are less than 500 remaining in NSW waters.|$|E
25|$|Various phylogenetic studies, {{based on}} morphology, have {{concluded}} that the blind shark lineage represents the sister taxon to the <b>wobbegongs.</b> Blind shark fossils have been found in Late Cretaceous period (99.665.5 Ma) deposits from Europe, as well as in Pliocene epoch (5.32.6 Ma) deposits from Chile and Peru.
