25|$|The SEC {{formally}} investigated whether Brunson's {{offer and}} its publication violated federal securities laws, including the anti-fraud {{provisions of the}} Securities Exchange Act of 1934. As part of its investigation, the SEC subpoenaed documents and testimony from Brunson's lawyers. However, Brunson, who invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and declined to testify in the investigation, directed his lawyers to withhold certain documents and not to testify on critical aspects of the offer, under the attorney-client privilege and <b>work</b> <b>product</b> doctrine. The subpoena enforcement action sought to set aside these privileges on various legal grounds, including the crime-fraud exception, and to compel Brunson's firm to provide the requested documents and testimony.|$|E
500|$|The {{rights to}} Buddha and its {{associated}} recordings were {{the subject of a}} legal dispute between the band and Secor in later years. According to Secor, he and the band had a gentleman's agreement: he would pay for the costs of recording and manufacturing the tape, and in exchange would receive half of all the profits from it. Raynor contends that the oral agreement was that Secor would invest $1,000 and when that money was recouped, the band would have complete ownership of the <b>work</b> <b>product.</b> Secor helped the band sign to Cargo Music in 1994, as he had connections at the label; he felt that by helping the briskly growing band sign a deal he could build his own label, Filter, in the wake of Blink's success. According to Secor, he attempted to contact the band to discuss the rights to the tape, but would only receive comments such as [...] "Oh, let me call my manager and I'll call you right back." [...] Secor asserted he should have the rights to the master tapes, as he financed the entire production. Cargo Music began calling and making threats, and Secor had no money to fight back with, as they had no written contract. In 1996, the band signed a joint-venture deal with major label MCA Records, who also began making calls to Secor. [...] "Try going up against that," [...] Secor remarked in 2001.|$|E

[...] "When our earlier opinion gives a statutory provision concrete meaning, which Congress elects not to amend during the ensuing 3½ decades," [...] he wrote, [...] "our duty to respect Congress' <b>work</b> <b>product</b> is strikingly similar to the duty of other federal courts to respect our work product." ...|$|E

2500|$|Editors {{who fail}} to comply with Wikipedia {{cultural}} rituals, such as , may implicitly signal that they are Wikipedia outsiders, increasing the odds that Wikipedia insiders may target or discount their contributions. Becoming a Wikipedia insider involves non-trivial costs: the contributor is expected to learn Wikipedia-specific technological codes, submit to a sometimes convoluted dispute resolution process, and learn a [...] "baffling culture rich with in-jokes and insider references". Editors who do not log in are in some sense second-class citizens on Wikipedia, as [...] "participants are accredited {{by members of the}} wiki community, who {{have a vested interest in}} preserving the quality of the <b>work</b> <b>product,</b> on the basis of their ongoing participation", but the contribution histories of anonymous unregistered editors recognized only by their IP addresses cannot be attributed to a particular editor with certainty.|$|E
2500|$|Critics of {{publicly}} editable wiki systems {{argue that these}} systems could be easily tampered with by malicious individuals ("vandals") or even by well-meaning but unskilled users who introduce errors into the content. While proponents argue that the community of users can catch malicious content and correct it. Lars Aronsson, a data systems specialist, summarizes the controversy as follows: [...] "Most people, when they first learn about the wiki concept, assume that a Web site that can be edited by anybody would soon be rendered useless by destructive input. It sounds like offering free spray cans next to a grey concrete wall. The only likely outcome would be ugly graffiti and simple tagging, and many artistic efforts would not be long lived. Still, it seems to work very well." [...] High editorial standards in medicine and health sciences articles, in which users typically use peer-reviewed journals or university textbooks as sources, {{have led to the}} idea of expert-moderated wikis. Some wikis allow one to link to specific versions of articles, which has been useful to the scientific community, in that expert peer reviewers could analyse articles, improve them and provide links to the trusted version of that article. Noveck points out that [...] "participants are accredited by members of the wiki community, who {{have a vested interest in}} preserving the quality of the <b>work</b> <b>product,</b> on the basis of their ongoing participation." [...] On controversial topics that have been subject to disruptive editing, a wiki may restrict editing to registered users.|$|E

In an inspection, a <b>work</b> <b>product</b> is selected for review and a team is gathered for an inspection meeting to review the <b>work</b> <b>product.</b> A moderator is chosen to moderate the meeting. Each inspector prepares for the meeting by reading the <b>work</b> <b>product</b> and noting each defect. In an inspection, a defect is any part of the <b>work</b> <b>product</b> that will keep an inspector from approving it. For example, if the team is inspecting a software requirements specification, each defect will be text in the document which an inspector disagrees with.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the process}} of {{performing}} configuration management, configuration items (or work products) may be assigned a baseline so as to establish them as having a certain status.
