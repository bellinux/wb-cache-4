25|$|Texas Instruments v. Sprague: On April 10, 1962, Lehovec {{received}} a patent for isolation by p-n junction. Texas Instruments immediately filed {{a court case}} claiming that the isolation problem was solved in their earlier patent filed by Kilby. Robert Sprague, the founder of Sprague, considered the case hopeless and <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> up the patent rights, was convinced otherwise by Lehovec. Four years later, Texas Instruments hosted in Dallas an arbitration hearing with demonstrations of the Kilby's inventions and depositions by experts. However, Lehovec conclusively proved that Kilby did not mention isolation of components. His priority on the isolation patent was finally acknowledged in April 1966.|$|E
25|$|On 7 August the Soviets {{attempted}} {{to relieve the}} pocket by launching a surprise counter offensive at Boguslav, halfway between Kiev and Uman. For a while it seemed as the entire German flank <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> way and prompt a suspension of operations at Uman. The Luftwaffe tipped the balance back in the Axis favour. Kurt Pflugbeil's Fliegerkorps V conducted rolling attacks on the attacking Soviet 26th Army. In two days 148 motor vehicles and 48 Soviet tanks were destroyed which stopped the attack. Rolling attacks were used in turn against the trapped Soviet armies. On 10 August Luftflotte 2 destroyed another 300 vehicles and 54 tanks. Fliegerkorps V claimed 420 motor vehicles, 58 tanks and 22 artillery batteries. The battle ended with 79,220 soldiers of the two armies dead, and 103,054 captured, although a large number were civilians that had been rounded up.|$|E

25|$|Ruault {{was soon}} {{reinforced}} to 25,000 men, a force considerably outnumbering the besiegers. By 3 October the Austrian bombardment began to noticeably taper off. On 3 October, the citizen captain Charlemagne Ovigneur continued {{to serve his}} gun {{even though he knew}} his house was burning and his wife <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> birth. On 4 October, Saxe-Teschen's wife, Maria Christina, Duchess of Teschen appeared in the Austrian camp and the bombardment was redoubled. By this time, Saxe-Teschen became aware of Brunswick's retreat as well as the increasing numbers of French troops opposing him. On 6 October the Austrian commander directed that the heavy siege guns be removed from the batteries. By this time 60,000 shot and shell had been fired into Lille. The Austrians evacuated the trenches on 8 October and withdrew almost unmolested {{in the face of a}} weak pursuit led by Félix Marie Pierre Chesnon de Champmorin. The inhabitants of Lille emerged from their town and, in their rage at the destruction, leveled the Austrian siege works. The victory was celebrated throughout France and caused many men to enlist in the armies.|$|E

[...] "Alright George," [...] MacArthur replied, [...] "but if he doesn't come back, I'm going to send his name in to Washington recommending him for a Congressional Medal of Honor."

500|$|The {{reception}} of the music video was mixed, with many critics noting its dark theme. James Montgomery of MTV reviewed the video stating:,"There's seemingly no bottom to the inky depths Rihanna plumbs in her brand-new 'Russian Roulette' video, a dark, claustrophobic descent that's creepier than anything she's ever done before (including the 'Disturbia' video)". Katy Hall from The Huffington Post commented that the video comes from a pretty dark place and tells more depressing story than Lady Gaga's [...] "Bad Romance". According to Daniel Kreps from Rolling Stone, {{there is a lot}} of imagery that is influenced by the altercation of Rihanna and Chris Brown from February 2009, including a speeding car that approaches Rihanna while she stands alone at night– [...] "a moment that seems to mirror the events immediately following the assault". Megan Masters from E! Online commented that the video [...] "portrays [...] "some seemingly real emotion with her bouncing back-and-forth between writhing around a padded cell." [...] Simon Vozick-Levinson from Entertainment Weekly supported the dark imagery used in the video, explaining, [...] "What, you thought Rihanna <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> 'Russian Roulette' a video full of sunshine and rainbows and peppy choreography? Her first single from Rated R is a song about violence".|$|E
500|$|Khánh {{participated in}} the 1963 South Vietnamese coup that deposed Diệm, playing a minor role, {{although}} he {{claimed to be a}} key player. Khánh expected a large reward, but the junta instead sidelined him, excluding him from the twelve-man Military Revolutionary Council. In mid-December he was moved from the II Corps in the central highlands to the command of the I Corps based around Huế and Da Nang in the far north of the Republic of Vietnam. This, it was speculated, was to keep him far away from Saigon in an attempt to stop him from involving himself in politics. This was contrary to Khánh's request for a transfer to the IV Corps in the Mekong Delta close to Saigon, where most of the fighting was taking place. In an interview with journalist Robert Shaplen, Khánh made no attempt to hide his annoyance at not being given a more important job. With respect to the 1963 coup that overthrew and killed Diệm, he cryptically commented [...] "It is too soon yet to tell the whole story, but someday I will tell it to you". The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) also reported that Khánh was motivated by a suspicion that Minh's junta knew he was untrustworthy and <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> him an overseas government post to sideline him completely.|$|E

500|$|After {{being formed}} and {{finishing}} {{third in the}} seventh series of The X Factor in 2010, One Direction were signed to Syco Music. Recording for their debut studio album, Up All Night, began in January 2011. In February 2011, the boy band and other contestants from the series participated in the X Factor Live Tour. After the tour concluded in April 2011, the group continued working on their debut album. [...] "Moments" [...] was written by Ed Sheeran and Si Hulbert, and produced by Hulbert. In an April 2012 interview with news.com.au, Sheeran said that he wrote the track [...] "years ago." [...] In 2011, Sheeran met One Direction's Harry Styles at his [...] "guitarist's friend's house". The group were putting their debut studio album together at the time. Sheeran had a CD with him of 40 songs that he <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> to publishers. As the boy band {{did not have enough}} songs for their album, Sheeran told Styles, [...] "Here's a CD. If you want one of these songs, have it." [...] The song ended up on the deluxe edition of the album. Sheeran acknowledged that he was happy with the outcome, [...] "It was a song I was never going to use. To have it on a multi-platinum selling album is quite nice." [...] During the album's UK launch in late 2011, member Louis Tomlinson referred to the song as his favourite track on the album. Niall Horan also commented, [...] "getting to write and record with Sheeran on our album was an honour." ...|$|E
500|$|Some of {{the cast}} was not happy with Fincher's {{exacting}} ways and perfectionism. Some scenes required upwards of 70 takes. [...] Gyllenhaal was frustrated by the director's methods and commented in an interview, [...] "You get a take, 5 takes, 10 takes. Some places, 90 takes. But there is a stopping point. There's {{a point at which}} you go, 'That's what we have to work with.' But we would reshoot things. So there came a point where I would say, well, what do I do? Where's the risk?" [...] Downey said, [...] "I just decided, aside from several times I wanted to garrote him, that I <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> him what he wanted. I think I'm a perfect person to work for him, because I understand gulags". Fincher responded, [...] "If an actor is going to let the role come to them, they can't resent the fact that I'm willing to wait as long as that takes. You know, the first day of production in San Francisco we shot 56 takes of Mark and Jake – and it's the 56th take that's in the movie". Ruffalo also backed up his director's methods when he said, [...] "The way I see it is, you enter into someone else's world as an actor. You can put your expectations aside and have an experience that's new and pushes and changes you, or hold on to what you think it should be and have a stubborn, immovable journey that's filled with disappointment and anger." ...|$|E

2500|$|Shane Warne {{also thought}} very highly of Hooper's {{footwork}} and, in 2008, named him {{among the top}} 100 cricketers of his time, citing in particular his ability to disguise his dances down the track. [...] Warne felt that determining when a batsman <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> the charge {{was one of the}} most important things for a spinner, and that Hooper was the best at making it indeterminable. [...] "During the 1995 series," [...] he wrote, [...] "this really nagged away at me, because I couldn't spot any of the usual clues even though I knew there had to be a sign that would give him away. [...] On a number of occasions, I stopped at the point of delivery to see if he was giving anything away with his footwork. [...] Most batsmen would be looking to get out of their ground at that point, whereas Hooper just stayed set. [...] In the end, after watching him closely time after time, I managed to crack it. [...] When he wanted to hit over the top, he just looked at me instead of tapping his crease as usual and looking down. Of course, my knowing what he was going to do did not always stop him from doing it." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1996 Coppola {{was charged}} in the 1977 killing of John [...] "Johnny Cokes" [...] Lardiere. According to authorities, Lardiere was {{released}} for 26 hours from prison to spend the Easter holidays with his family. The reason for his sanctioned killing aren't fully known, but is speculated that he had turned against the mob and <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> the FBI information on the mob's influence on garbage hauling. Another story has it that Lardiere got into a heated argument with Ralph [...] "Blackie" [...] Napoli, a caporegime in the Philadelphia crime family and his death was ordered. When Lardiere {{got out of his}} car at a Bridgewater, New Jersey motel, Coppola {{was standing in front of}} him with a [...]22 automatic pistol, complete with a silencer. When Coppola squeezed the trigger, the gun jammed. Lardiere was both amused and annoyed by the man and allegedly said [...] "What're you gonna do now, tough guy?". Coppola responded by pulling up his pant leg, and removing a [...]38 revolver from an ankle holster and shooting Lardiere four times. When police arrived at the crime scene, they knew immediately it was a mob hit. The shooter had left behind his weapons and a hat. In 1996 Lucchese crime family mobster Thomas [...] "Tommy" [...] Ricciardi who had been arrested on murder and extortion charges, decided to cooperate with authorities. He told the FBI that Lardiere's killer was Michael Coppola. Ricciardi told police that he heard the entire story of Lardiere's murder from Coppola while talking about mob murders with Michael Taccetta at a party in 1983.|$|E
2500|$|The cast was {{announced}} between March and August 2014, with Idris Elba being announced to voice Shere Khan during early stages and Bill Murray eventually confirmed {{as the voice}} of Baloo in August 2014. Between then, Scarlett Johansson, Ben Kingsley, and Christopher Walken were confirmed to play Kaa, Bagheera, and King Louie. Favreau decided to cast Johansson to play Kaa, originally a male character, as he felt the original film was [...] "a little too male-oriented." [...] Favreau and Marks noticed the lack of female characters in the 1967 film version and wanted to address that by featuring Raksha's character more prominently, as in Kipling's tales. Lupita Nyong'o was cast as Raksha as Favreau believed her voice imbued the emotion required for the role, [...] "Lupita has tremendous depth of emotion in her performance. There's an emotional underpinning she brings, and a strength, and we wanted that for this surrogate mother. Much of that comes from her voice." [...] Favreau also decided to change King Louie from an orangutan to a Gigantopithecus {{due to the fact that}} orangutans are not native to India, where the story takes place. His character was given a slight alteration from the 1967 film and was partly inspired by Marlon Brando's character Colonel Kurtz in Apocalypse Now, as well as incorporating Walken's own physical mannerisms. In regards to Louie's changes, Favreau stated, [...] "We created this looming figure that was trying to extract the secret of fire from Mowgli. And also this gave Mowgli the idea that if he had fire, he could have power over Shere Khan, whether it was good or bad. So there was aLord of the Rings aspect to that; the fire was almost like the ring in that <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> someone ultimate power, but corrupt them as well as create destruction." [...] The film is dedicated to Garry Shandling, who voiced a porcupine in the film and died of a heart attack before the film's release.|$|E
