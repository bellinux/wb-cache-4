Executives often sensed what they <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> before they could explain why.

He added [...] "there was a grain of truth in the beginning, but then it all snowballed into some big silly thing". When asked, in 2010, about giving a song to Minogue, he stated that it would be [...] "amazing".|$|E

500|$|The soundtrack started being {{composed}} before production {{had even}} begun, {{and is a}} notable departure from the band's previous works, as Daft Punk put more emphasis on orchestral elements rather than relying solely on synthesizers. [...] "Synths are a very low level of artificial intelligence," [...] explained member Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo, [...] "whereas you have a Stradivarius that will live for a thousand years. We knew {{from the start that}} there was no way that we <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this film score with two synthesizers and a drum machine." ...|$|E
500|$|Chester Bennington {{stated in}} an {{interview}} with MTV News, which referred to Linkin Park's new style as being less technical and more organic: [...] "When it came to doing things that felt very much like older Linkin Park, like mixing hip-hop with a rock chorus, [...] felt like, if we <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it, we need to really {{do it in a way}} that felt natural and felt original and felt like it was something we hadn't done in the past... there are hip-hop songs on the album—'Wretches and Kings', 'When They Come for Me'—they're like nothing the band have tried before: snarling, raw, dark and...strangely organic." ...|$|E

It {{was going to be}} John making a {{political}} statement, but a very commercial one as well ... I always thought that 'Imagine' was like the national anthem." [...] Lennon described his working arrangement with Ono and Spector: [...] "Phil doesn't arrange or anything like that— and Phil will just sit in the other room and shout comments like, 'Why don't you try this sound' or 'You're not playing the piano too well'...

500|$|Following his retirement, Cross {{attacked}} US {{foreign policy}} on Iraq, calling the plans [...] "fatally flawed" [...] shortly after General Sir Mike Jackson—Chief of the General Staff {{at the time}} of the invasion and also recently retired—called the same plans [...] "intellectually bankrupt". In a 2009 interview, Cross praised the planning for the invasion and the removal of Saddam Hussein, but said that he [...] "was very keen that we thought through carefully the postwar aspects of what we <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> once the military campaign was over. And I think it's now very public knowledge that that was not well handled. It was not well thought through, it was not well executed. And we lived with the consequences of that." ...|$|E

They didn't tell me they <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this, but they told Jon to hold my hand and not let it go. Then he did, and I lost it. Every single one of those tears were absolutely real. She wants to stay with all of her heart. She does not want to leave, but she knows she has to."

Then one guy looked at us and said, 'But we need a hit song.' And we said, 'But you've got eleven songs, and if you can't find a hit in one of them then you're shit out of luck because that's what we're giving you.' So we're like saying to them, 'Right, you write the fucking hit song and we'll record it.' That shut the guy up {{and that was the last}} time we had any kind of meetings like that!" ...|$|E
500|$|On {{the early}} experience, Richards said, [...] "The amazing {{thing is that}} {{although}} Mick and I thought these songs were really puerile and kindergarten-time, every one that got put out made a decent showing in the charts. That gave us extraordinary confidence to carry on, because at the beginning songwriting was something we <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> in order to say to Andrew , 'Well, at least we gave it a try...'" [...] Jagger said, [...] "We were very pop-orientated. We didn't sit around listening to Muddy Waters; we listened to everything. In some ways it's easy to write to order... Keith and I got into the groove of writing those kind of tunes; they were done in ten minutes. I think {{we thought it was}} a bit of a laugh, and it turned out to be something of an apprenticeship for us." ...|$|E
500|$|Anthony Mackie {{said the}} Russo {{brothers}} relied on minimal use of computer-generated imagery, stating, [...] "The Russos, {{what they did}} that was so great was, they wanted to stay with live action, which is a dying art form. If they can build it, they built it. If we could do it, we did it. They wanted to do as little CGI as possible. That's why the movie looks so great." [...] Nevertheless, six special effects companies are involved in creating the visual effects of the film, including Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), Scanline VFX, Lola VFX, Luma Pictures, Whiskytree and The Embassy, with previsualization completed by Proof. The film contained 2,500 visual effects shots, with 900 worked on by ILM. The film featured extensive use of digital doubles. Russell Earl, ILM visual effects supervisor, said, [...] "The character that we did the most work on was Falcon. We knew we <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> CG wings. We also did some shots with wires and some with stunt doubles and head replacement. And we needed a very good digital double." ...|$|E

500|$|On February 4, 2008 a {{re-recording}} of [...] "You Should've Killed Me When You Had the Chance" [...] {{was posted}} on the band's Myspace. The album was reissued on February 19.

In addition to these bonus tracks, is a bonus DVD with footage of A Day to Remember's performance in Ocala, two music videos, as well as behind the scenes footage of recording and commentary on the re-release. The re-release came about after Victory asked the band whether or not if they <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> a new album. Commenting about Victory's inquiry about a new album, Woodard [...] "We weren't {{ready to do it}} , so they asked if, you know, we were interested in doing a re-release with new artwork and adding some new songs." ...|$|E
500|$|Accordingly, one of {{the main}} events was the Intercontinental Championship match between Bret Hart and Davey Boy Smith, brothers-in-law in real life as Smith was married to Diana Hart, Bret's sister. On {{television}} broadcasts leading up to SummerSlam, interviews with Diana and her mother Helen portrayed the family as being torn apart by the upcoming match. Bruce Hart publicly supported Smith, while Owen Hart sided with his brother Bret. Diana stated that she did not know who she wanted to win the match, as she had close ties to both men. She ultimately stated that she simply hoped that neither wrestler would get hurt. Prior to the match, Smith was hospitalized with a legitimate staph infection in his knee, which he suffered during a match with Mike Sharpe on July 20 in Worcester, Massachusetts (the fact was revealed by his wife Diana years later on the Hart & Soul documentary); despite the concerns about his health, he decided to wrestle the match as planned. Bret Hart later revealed {{in an interview that he}} doubted the legitimacy of the injury and that he believed Davey Boy in fact had a drug problem and that in the two months prior to their match he could not contact him to sort out what they <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> at Wembley, and when they finally got to the stadium Smith revealed that he had not slept in over 48 hours. However, Hart also stated that as bad as Smith's personal issues were, he [...] "sucked it up" [...] and hit every spot in the match.|$|E
