For all investigations which depend on reasoning would be carried out by transposing these characters and by a species of calculus.|$|E
500|$|The Guardians Andrew Pulver {{was less}} enthusiastic, calling the film {{a mix of}} [...] "wafer-thin psychodrama" [...] and [...] "plot-generator dialogue". Times Richard Corliss said the action was let down by [...] "inert" [...] drama, {{describing}} the film as [...] "45 minutes of awesome encased in 90 minutes of yawnsome." [...] Justin Chang of Variety criticized it as loud and lacking the nuance and subtlety of del Toro's previous films. The New Yorkers Anthony Lane's verdict read as [...] "It is possible to applaud Pacific Rim for the efficacy of its business model while deploring the tale that has been engendered—long, loud, dark, and very wet. You might as well watch the birth of an elephant." [...] The San Francisco Chronicles Mike LaSalle reacted extremely negatively by stating [...] "If {{this is the best}} <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> terms of movies—hoif something like this can speak to the soul of audiences—maybe we should just turn over the cameras and the equipment to the alien dinosaurs and see what they come up with… Director Guillermo del Toro, who gave us Pan's Labyrinth not too many years ago, used to be known as an artistic and discerning filmmaker, despite his affection for blockbuster action and grotesqueness. But too often he gets lost in his computer…Why go to the movies to look at somebody else's computer after looking at your own all week?… The actors can't make Pacific Rim any better. They can only relieve some of the pain." [...] Slant Magazines Ed Gonzalez, who said the film lacked poignancy, compared it to a video game: [...] "a stylish but programmatic ride toward an inevitable final boss battle". The Wraps Alonso Duralde criticized the choice to set most battles at night or during the rain, feeling it detracted from the action, and said the comic relief actors—Day, Gorman, and Perlman—stole the film from the less interesting leads. Jordan Hoffman of Film.com identified Hunnam as the weak link in the cast, calling him a [...] "charisma black hole". Giles Hardie of The Sydney Morning Herald was particularly critical of the film, awarding the action sequences [...] "five IQ points out of five" [...] as he described the film as an hour and twenty minutes of fight sequences vaguely connected by ten minutes of story.|$|E
2500|$|When S4 becomes empty, we {{know that}} our graph has minimum degree five. If the graph is empty, {{we go to the}} final step 5 below. Otherwise, Wernicke's Theorem tells us that S5 is nonempty. Pop v off S5, delete it from the graph, and let v1, v2, v3, v4, v5 be the former neighbors of v in {{clockwise}} planar order, where v1 is the neighbor of degree at most 6. We check if v1 is adjacent to v3 (which <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> constant time due to the degree of v1). There are two cases: ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{writing for}} season one, Vernon Chatman, a {{consulting}} producer for the series, would assist in outlining and [...] "weighing in" [...] on scripts, while Neely would write all the scripts himself. During season one, Neely said his staff would make each episode encapsulate various genres, stating [...] "We're {{trying to tell}} as many different things as <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> a quarter-hour." [...] Since season two, with the episodes being 22 minutes, the series employs six to eight writers per episode. In their writing room, the crew discusses a given episode synopsis and create a detailed, 22-page outline, which gets sent to the network for notes. After the network approves of the outline and the crew is satisfied with it, the outline gets made into a script, which also goes through the network for notes. According to Neely in the Huffington Post interview, {{at the height of}} production of the second season, the production crew was working on six or seven episodes simultaneously, all at various stages of completion.|$|E
2500|$|The House of Lords (Lord Porter, Lord Normand, Lord Oaksey, Lord Reid and Lord Radcliffe) {{unanimously}} {{found that}} there was no negligence, although most considered it a close call based on whether the reasonable person would foresee this as anything more than an extremely remote risk. [...] Most of the Lords agreed that the key issue was that of making the key question one of determining the fact of what the reasonable person would have in mind regarding assumption of this risk. [...] Facts may be determined by judges, but may also be determined by lesser mortals in juries. [...] This was not considered to be a point of law, which is the province of judges. [...] In this case the risk was considered (just) too remote for the reasonable person, in spite of the observation by Lord Porter that hitting a ball out of the ground was an objective of the game, [...] "and indeed, one which the batsman would wish to bring about". The Lords believed there were policy implications in terms of the message of what liability would have meant in creating restrictions in what <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> our everyday lives in an urbanised modern society.|$|E

50|$|Writing {{about six}} years after the {{discovery}} of quantum indeterminacy, Hobart explicitly does not endorse strict logical or physical determinism, and he explicitly does endorse the existence of alternative possibilities, i.e., that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> otherwise <b>in</b> the same circumstances.

"It {{would be}} very pleasant," [...] said he to Rollo, [...] "for us to stop at those towns, and ramble about during the day, {{and then in the}} evening set sail again, {{provided}} we could be at liberty to land at our pleasure, to ramble about unmolested wherever we wished to go, as <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> America." ...|$|E

"From {{what you}} say, sir," [...] said Adams, thoughtfully, {{after they had}} sat down, [...] "it {{seems to me that}} if <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> nothing <b>in</b> the matter o' workin' out our salvation, and have nothin' to do but sit still an' receive it, we can't be to blame if we don't get it." ...|$|R

"I believe I am the senior," [...] one of {{the captains}} said; [...] "but I should imagine that Lord Beresford's {{commission}} would, for the time, rank just {{as if it had}} been signed by our own authorities.

It is better that we should retreat, which <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> an orderly manner, and thus join the main body before we give the enemy battle. Or, if the sultan should attempt to pursue us, he can not keep his army together in doing so. They will necessarily become divided into detachments on the road, and then we can turn and destroy them in detail, which will be a much surer mode of proceeding than for us to attack them in the mass." ...|$|E

"The matter {{would be}} serious, assuredly," [...] the king said, [...] "and would cause so great a trouble to the {{citizens}} of London that it would be well that some means should be taken to prevent it.

6000|$|... "Well, look here, I {{want you}} and Sam to {{set to work}} and wash these clothes at once.

We must see to-morrow what <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> the way of rigging her out properly, but for to-day we must manage with these things.

6000|$|... "We can cut off {{the tops}} of the trees and then bind in some of the {{branches}} for a roof," [...] said Snap. [...] "Over those branches we can bind others, with strips of bark between. We can cut the trees higher {{on one side of the}} circle than on the other, so the snow and rain can run off. Then we can bind in brushwood and bark for the sides, between the trees, leaving one spot open for a rough sort of chimney, which we'll have to build up of flat rocks. It won't make as nice a cabin as the other was, but it is the best <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> this wintry weather, and I think, with a good fire going, we can make it fairly comfortable inside." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Soldiers," [...] he said, [...] "we {{have been}} outwitted. My impi is afar, {{and that of}} Hafela is at our gates. Yonder in the valley, though we be few, we can defend {{ourselves}} till succour reaches us, which already messengers have gone out to seek. But first we must give time for the women and children, the sick and the aged, to withdraw with food and cattle; and this <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> one way only, by keeping Hafela at bay till they have passed the archway, all of them. Now, soldiers, {{for the sake of}} your own lives, of your honour and of those you love, swear to me, in the holy Name which we have been taught to worship, that you will fight out this great fight without fear or faltering." ...|$|E
