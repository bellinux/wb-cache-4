25|$|The song Hop Hop has {{political}} tones.

Tarkan explained in the interview that the song examines these problems and encourages people to unite, no matter what color our skin is or what religion <b>we</b> <b>follow.</b>|$|E

500|$|According to lead {{designer}} Chris Avellone, Planescape: Torment {{was inspired}} by books, comics, and games, including Archie Comics, The Chronicles of Amber, The Elementals and Shadowrun. The game's 1997 outline also makes references to The Lord of the Rings to describe some characters. While working on Planescape: Torment, Avellone was simultaneously working on Fallout 2. In an interview from 2007, he says that Fallout 2 helped him rethink the possibilities of dialogue in Planescape: Torment (and in later games he was involved with, including Neverwinter Nights 2). Producer Guido Henkel commented on taking liberties with the AD rules by simplifying them: [...] "I think we still take the AD rules very seriously and <b>we</b> <b>follow</b> those rules. We just take the liberty of removing some of the 'overhead'." ...|$|E
500|$|The next day, Calafia duels with King Amadis, and Radiaro duels with Esplandián. With Leonorina, his betrothed, looking on, Esplandián masters Radiaro with {{a flurry}} of weapon thrusts. Calafia and Amadis trade blows until he disarms her and knocks her helmet off. Both Calafia and Radario {{surrender}} to the Christians. While being held prisoner, Calafia acknowledges the astonishing beauty of Leonorina, daughter of the Constantinople emperor and the intended bride of Esplandián, and resolves not to interfere with their union. She accepts Christianity as the one true faith, saying, [...] "I have seen the ordered order of your religion, and the great disorder of all others, I have seen that {{it is clear that}} the law which you follow must be the truth, while that which <b>we</b> <b>follow</b> is lying and falsehood." [...] She marries Talanque, a large and handsome knight who fought with her outside the city gate; similarly, her sister Liota marries Maneli, Talanque's companion in arms. The women return to California with their husbands to establish a new dynasty complete with both sexes, as a Christian nation.|$|E
500|$|In an August 30, 2009 Detroit Free Press article, several {{current and}} former players on the 2008 and 2009 teams {{speaking}} anonymously said Michigan frequently violated the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) off-season 8-hour-per-week and in-season 20-hour-per-week practice limit. Rodriguez denied all of the allegations {{at a press conference}} the next day; [...] The New York Times quoted him as saying [...] "We know the rules, and <b>we</b> <b>follow</b> the rules." [...] The University of Michigan Athletic Department's compliance office notified both the NCAA and the Big Ten Conference of its intentions to investigate itself. [...] Unlike the University of Michigan basketball scandal where all of the participants had left the school by the time the investigation completed and punishment was handed down, many of the athletes involved in this scandal are still students at the University of Michigan; failure to cooperate with the investigation might result in the NCAA revoking the athletes eligibility to participate in athletic competitions. In November, the university revealed its finding that the team failed to file the proper paperwork to document the team's training schedule.|$|E

500|$|Fodor {{has made}} many and varied criticisms of holism. He {{identifies}} the central problem {{with all the}} different notions of holism as {{the idea that the}} determining factor in semantic evaluation is the notion of an [...] "epistemic bond". Briefly, P is an epistemic bond of Q if the meaning of P is considered by someone to be relevant for the determination of the meaning of Q. Meaning holism strongly depends on this notion. The identity of the content of a mental state, under holism, can only be determined by the totality of its epistemic bonds. And this makes the realism of mental states an impossibility:If people differ in an absolutely general way in their estimations of epistemic relevance, and if <b>we</b> <b>follow</b> the holism of meaning and individuate intentional states by way of the totality of their epistemic bonds, the consequence will be that two people (or, for that matter, two temporal sections of the same person) will never be in the same intentional state. Therefore, two people can never be subsumed under the same intentional generalizations. And, therefore, intentional generalization can never be successful. And, therefore again, there is no hope for an intentional psychology.|$|E
500|$|... "Harvest Festival" [...] was {{the first}} episode of the season written and {{produced}} separately from the second season. The previous six episodes from the third season were filmed almost immediately after the second season ended {{as part of an}} early shooting schedule to accommodate Poehler's pregnancy. Series co-creator Michael Schur described it as a particularly empowering episode for the Leslie Knope character: [...] "When you see this episode [...] it makes you love her even more. This episode is about Leslie being noticed for the incredible hard work she does." [...] Schur also said he believed the subplot with April and Andy was one that several young people in their situation have faced in real life: [...] "Andy is put into a situation {{that a lot of people}} have been put into in our lives and he does the exact wrong thing you can do. And that's sort of the template for them going forward is what's the wrongest thing you can do? That's sort of how <b>we</b> <b>follow</b> them." [...] Chris Pratt said he believed the conflict provided strong romantic and comedic potential for the characters: [...] "There definitely will be conflict in their relationship [...] there's still a lot of room for comedy in there, because we have good writers." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{public and}} {{academic}} {{reaction to the}} decision was negative. Thomas Poole considered that the Law Lords had failed in their duty {{as members of the}} judiciary: [...] "where old principles no longer fit contemporary constitutional and moral standards, why should <b>we</b> <b>follow</b> them? Surely the judicial task is to rework things like neo-imperial texts and outdated legal attitudes to the prerogative in order to cure obvious injustices and to vindicate a modern conception of the rule of law". Margit Cohn agreed, writing on the legitimate expectation issue that [...] "It is difficult to accept that a public statement made by a Secretary of State, followed by the promulgation of an order that removed the previous prohibition to return, could not have created at least some sort of expectation". Cohn further described the case as an [...] "unfortunate regression" [...] from the GCHQ case, where judges had been willing to debate legitimate expectation in a similarly politically sensitive situation. [...] T.T. Arvind went further, drawing parallels with the judicial response to the Zong Massacre to argue that the decision, despite its formalist rhetoric, was in reality a pragmatic one which abandoned centuries of settled constitutional jurisprudence in relation to the limited scope of the Royal Prerogative.|$|E

500|$|The idea of {{parallel}} lives has been explored before in {{films such as}} Run Lola Run (1998) and Sliding Doors (1998) which influenced Van Dormael's writing. Unlike any of those, Mr. Nobody has philosophical underpinning inspired by scientific tomes on chaos theory and the butterfly effect, pigeon superstition, and the space-time continuum. Van Dormael stated, [...] "My starting point was a 12-minute short I made in 1982 called È pericoloso sporgersi. A kid runs behind a train with two possible choices: to go with his mother or with his father. From there <b>we</b> <b>follow</b> two possible futures. I started one version {{based on the fact}} that a woman jumps or doesn't jump on a train. Then Sliding Doors by Peter Howitt came out, followed by Run Lola Run by Tom Tykwer. I had to find something else. And that's when I realised that the story I was trying to tell was not binary, that I was above all interested by the multiplicity and complexity of choices. With this screenplay I wanted to make the viewer feel the abyss that is the infinity of possibilities. Beyond this, I wanted to find a different way of telling a story. I wanted the gaze of the child on his future to meet the gaze of the old man he has become on his past. I wanted to talk about complexity through cinema, which is a simplifying medium. While reality around us is more and more complex, the information is more and more succinct, political speeches are more and more simplistic. What interests me is complexity. Not the simple answers, which are reassuring but bound to be false." ...|$|E
500|$|The Guardian and the Evening Times {{highlighted}} the Star Stories parody as the [...] "pick of the day". Martin Skeggs of The Guardian commented, [...] "There's everything you {{ever wanted to}} know about the world's number one film star, including how he was introduced to Scientology (John Travolta whacked him over the head with a shovel), the time he met Nicole Kidman and asked her if she would mind sitting down to make him look taller". He characterized the parody as, [...] "A toned down version of real life, then." [...] Barry McDonald of the Evening Times described the episode as [...] "equally cruel and sidesplittingly hilarious". He commented, [...] "This is as close to must-watch television as you're likely to get and a testament to the quality of comedy writing on display." [...] In a later review of the program for the Evening Times when it was shown again on re-runs, McDonald wrote, [...] "I don't care if it's been shown several times before, {{this is one of the}} shows which you just have to see again." [...] Anila Baig of The Sun {{highlighted the}} show as [...] "Best Spoof", and wrote, [...] "pint-sized Hollywood superstar Tom Cruise [...] is subjected to some serious mocking. <b>We</b> <b>follow</b> his film career, his marriages to Nicole Kidman and Katie Holmes (portrayed as a robot) and how everything in his life has been shaped by his belief in Scientology. The show is as crude as ever". Stephen Milton of The Sun described the parody of Cruise's appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show as [...] "the best gag in the whole episode". Aidan Smith of Scotland on Sunday wrote favorably of the show, and noted, [...] "Fearlessly, in view of how paranoid Scientologists are, the latest target was Tom Cruise. I especially liked the scene where the tiny screen giant winched himself, Mission Impossible-style, on to Nicole Kidman while she slugged from a tinnie like a good Sheila." ...|$|E
