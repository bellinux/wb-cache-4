25|$|Another species {{commonly}} {{confused with}} the <b>white</b> <b>wood</b> aster is Schreber's aster (Eurybia schreberi). Schreber's aster is typically found on moister soils, though {{it can also be}} found on mesic sites. While much of their ranges overlap, Schreber's aster is not found south of Virginia or Tennessee. Schreber's aster can also be distinguished by the more numerous teeth on the leaves, typically numbering 15 to 30 per side to the <b>white</b> <b>wood</b> aster's 6 to 15 per side. The leaves are wider on Schreber's aster with broader sinuses at the bases. The flower stalks are also densely hairy on the <b>white</b> <b>wood</b> aster, while they are only sparsely haired on Schreber's aster. Lastly, the clones of E. schreberi have sterile rosettes, while those of E. divaricata do not.|$|E
25|$|Several {{different}} {{plants are}} superficially {{quite similar to}} the <b>white</b> <b>wood</b> aster, but close examination as well as knowledge of the plants' differing habitats and ranges can readily distinguish them. The most similar species is the mountain wood aster (Eurybia chlorolepis), which was previously considered conspecfic with E. divaricata. E. chlorolepis differs in having flower stalks that are longer than 1.5cm, while those of E. divaricata are shorter than this. The involucres of the mountain wood aster are generally between 6.5 and 9mm in length, while those of the <b>white</b> <b>wood</b> aster are normally from 4.2 to 6.5mm long, but in rare cases they may be as long as 7.5mm. The mountain wood aster almost always has more rays than the <b>white</b> <b>wood</b> aster: the former usually has 12 to 16, but occasionally as few as 10, while the latter generally has 5 to 10 and never more than 12. The rays are also longer on the mountain wood aster at 17 to 18mm in most cases, while the <b>white</b> <b>wood</b> aster's are generally only 10 to 15mm. Lastly, E. chlorolepsis is present only from southern Virginia south to Georgia in the Appalachian Mountains at altitudes of , while E. divaricata can be found from southern Canada south to Alabama, meaning their ranges only overlap in the southern United States, and there only at high elevations.|$|E

25|$|Eurybia divaricata (formerly Aster divaricatus), {{commonly}} known as the <b>white</b> <b>wood</b> aster, is an herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It occurs in the eastern United States, primarily in the Appalachian mountains, though it is also present in southeastern Canada, but only in about 25 populations in the provinces of Ontario and Quebec. In the U.S. it is abundant and common, but in Canada it is considered threatened due to its restricted distribution. It can be found in dry open woods as well as along wood-edges and clearings. The species is distinguished by its flower heads that have yellow centers and white rays that are arranged in flat-topped corymbiform arrays, emerging in the late summer through fall. Other distinguishing characteristics include its serpentine stems and sharply serrated narrow heart-shaped leaves. The <b>white</b> <b>wood</b> aster is sometimes used in cultivation in both North America and Europe due to it being quite tough and for its showy flowers.|$|E
25|$|Traditional {{masks are}} most {{commonly}} carved from wood, with various types used. The harvesting of this wood often falls under certain customs related to {{when and how}} the trees may be cut. The most common traditional wood is “zompantle” also called “palo bofo” or “colorín” (Erythrina coralloides) a plant of the legume family which yields a soft <b>white</b> <b>wood</b> often use for more artistic objects and {{has been associated with}} ritual since pre Hispanic times. It is never used to utilitarian items. Other common woods include red cedar and “ayacahuite” (Pinus ayacahuite), both favored for their ability to resist insect infestation. Red cedar masks are most commonly found in the Sierra de Puebla, Papantla area, Chiapa de Corzo and among the Zoques in Chiapas. Poplar wood is commonly used because it can be worked thin and does not splinter. Masks of this wood are most commonly found for the pascola dances of the Mayos and Yaquis. The hardest woods used for masks are mesquite and avocado. Mezquite masks are found in Hidalgo, Zacatecas and the northwest of the country, with avocado wood ones found in the State of Mexico. Copal wood in used mostly in Michoacán and Oaxaca but can be found in Sonora and other states.|$|E

5000|$|White Pines Forest State Park {{is located}} in {{what was once a}} part of the Sauk leader Black Hawk's {{territory}} and encompasses an area once known as <b>White</b> Pines <b>Woods.</b> <b>White</b> Pines State Park nearly became an Illinois State Park as early as 1903, when the state established its first state park at Fort Massac. Members of the Oregon, Illinois Woman's Council started the process by lobbying the Illinois legislature to set aside <b>White</b> Pines <b>Woods</b> as a state park. In 1903 the Illinois legislature appropriated US$30,000 for the purchase of <b>White</b> Pines <b>Woods,</b> the southernmost stand of virgin, native white pine trees in the state. The move was stalled when then-Illinois Governor Richard Yates vetoed the measure, citing costs. After 1903 and before 1927 (when the state park was established), the [...] "Pines Woods Bill" [...] was introduced several times without success. The designation of Starved Rock State Park in 1912 reportedly frustrated the supporters of White Pines Woods' designation as a state park.The influential Friends of Our Native Landscape included the area around the Rock River between Dixon and Oregon on a list of 20 places in Illinois that should be designated state parks.
