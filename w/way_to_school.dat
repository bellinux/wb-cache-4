25|$|Parallel {{to these}} {{efforts in the}} {{education}} sector, other sectors (for example, certain aspects of housing and municipal services) in Egypt are planning to decentralize decision-making and spending, now nationwide (without a pilot stage in limited governorates), in a phased approach.

In addition to administrative and financial decentralization, there is an increasing emphasis on involving elected local popular councils (which exist at governorate and district level) in the horizontal oversight of expenditure and planning across the decentralizing sectors, and as they come on stream in the decentralization process. Within the education sector, as of late 2009 plans are being made to decentralize certain lines of funding and planning for capital equipment and infrastructure, in all governorates, all the <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>school</b> level in the case of smaller units of capital equipment, or levels higher than the school for items such as new infrastructure.

The United Nations has several times warned from the devastating effects of the attacks on children, who form 56% percent of the population, and who are bearing the brunt of violence and a significant proportion of the injured who are severely maimed. Schools are currently focusing on providing psychological and mental health support to the students, before resuming teaching core subjects. The head of Gaza's mental health program, has said that half of the population will suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of the crisis. The UN states that according to reports by the consultancy company Near East Consulting, about 96 percent of Gaza residents feel depressed and disheartened.

500|$|In Morning, a lady {{makes her}} way to church, {{shielding}} herself with her fan from the shocking view of two men pawing at the market girls. The scene is {{the west side of}} the piazza at Covent Garden, indicated by a part of the Palladian portico of Inigo Jones's Church of St Paul visible behind Tom King's Coffee House, a notorious venue celebrated in pamphlets of the time. Henry Fielding mentions the coffee house in both The Covent Garden Tragedy and Pasquin. At the time Hogarth produced this picture, the coffee house was being run by Tom's widow, Moll King, but its reputation had not diminished. Moll opened the doors once those of the taverns had shut, allowing the revellers to continue enjoying themselves from midnight until dawn. The Mansion House with columned portico visible in the centre of the picture, No. 43 King Street, is attributed to architect Thomas Archer (later 1st Baron Archer) and occupied by him at the date of Hogarth's works. It was situated on the north side of the piazza, while the coffee house was on the south side, as depicted in Hogarth's original painting. In the picture, it is early morning and some revellers are ending their evening: a fight has broken out in the coffee house and, in the mel√©e, a wig flies out of the door. [...] Meanwhile, stallholders set out their fruit and vegetables for the day's market. Two children who should be making their <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>school</b> have stopped, entranced by the activity of the market, in a direct reference to Swift's A Description of the Morning in which children [...] "lag with satchels in their hands". Above the clock is Father Time and below it the inscription Sic transit gloria mundi. The smoke rising from the chimney of the coffee house connects these portents to the scene below.|$|E
