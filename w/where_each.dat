5|$|Although many of {{the coins}} bear {{the name of a}} moneyer, there is no {{indication}} of the mint <b>where</b> <b>each</b> coin was struck. As a result, the number and location of mints used by Offa is uncertain. Current opinion is that there were four mints, in Canterbury, Rochester, East Anglia and London.|$|E
5|$|During formal occasions, {{four people}} are {{required}} to properly fold the flag, <b>where</b> <b>each</b> person holds one of the sides.

5|$|Electronic Arts' 1983 game Worms? is an {{interactive}} implementation of Paterson's worms, <b>where</b> <b>each</b> time a worm has {{to turn in}} a way that it lacks a rule for, it stops and lets the user choose a direction, which sets that rule for that worm.|$|E

(2) Signalling structures: the {{standard}} signalling theory <b>where</b> after <b>each</b> stage both players are {{informed of the}} previous moves played, was extended to deal with general signalling structure <b>where</b> after <b>each</b> stage each player gets a private signal that may depend on the moves and on the state.|$|R

5|$|In Super Smash Bros., up to {{four players}} can play in {{multiplayer}} (Versus) mode, with the specific rules of each match being predetermined by the players. There are two match types that can be chosen: Time, where {{the person with the}} most KOs {{at the end of the}} set time wins; and stock, <b>where</b> <b>each</b> player has a set number of lives and are eliminated from play when their lives are depleted.|$|E
5|$|Motifs and {{arrangements}} of figures extend along the lower panels {{from one to}} the next, {{to the extent that the}} separations between panels are ignored with the intersections cutting figures in two. This is particularly evident on the lower register <b>where</b> <b>each</b> panel division intersects figures, so that parts of figures are painted on two adjoining panels; whereas Christ and St Michael are enclosed within the single central panel, giving emphasis to the iconography.|$|E

5|$|The group {{stage was}} held at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco, California. The group stage was played in a best of one double {{round-robin}} format, <b>where</b> <b>each</b> team played every other team in their group twice, with the top two teams from each of the four groups advancing to the knockout stage.|$|E
5|$|Voronoi or Dirichlet tilings are tessellations <b>where</b> <b>each</b> tile {{is defined}} as the set of points closest to one of the points in a {{discrete}} set of defining points. (Think of geographical regions <b>where</b> <b>each</b> region {{is defined as}} all the points closest to a given city or post office.) The Voronoi cell for each defining point is a convex polygon. The Delaunay triangulation is a tessellation that is the dual graph of a Voronoi tessellation. Delaunay triangulations are useful in numerical simulation, in part because among all possible triangulations of the defining points, Delaunay triangulations maximize the minimum of the angles formed by the edges. Voronoi tilings with randomly placed points can be used to construct random tilings of the plane.|$|E

5|$|A {{classic example}} of a random walk {{is known as the}} simple random walk, which is a {{stochastic}} process in discrete time with the integers as the state space, and is based on a Bernoulli process, <b>where</b> <b>each</b> iid Bernoulli variable takes either the value positive one or negative one. In other words, the simple random walk takes place on the integers, and its value increases by one with probability, say, , or decreases by negative one with probability , so index set of this random walk is the natural numbers, while its state space is the integers. If the , this random walk is called a symmetric random walk.|$|E
5|$|A random {{assemblage}} of fish merely using some localised resource {{such as food}} or nesting sites is known simply as an aggregation. When fish come together in an interactive, social grouping, then they may be forming either a shoal or a school depending {{on the degree of}} organisation. A shoal is a loosely organised group <b>where</b> <b>each</b> fish swims and forages independently but is attracted to other members of the group and adjusts its behaviour, such as swimming speed, so that it remains close to {{the other members of the}} group. Schools of fish are much more tightly organised, synchronising their swimming so that all fish move at the same speed and in the same direction. Shoaling and schooling behaviour is believed to provide a variety of advantages.|$|E

5|$|A {{total of}} 18 teams {{were invited to}} {{participate}} in the 1994 Giro d'Italia, of which 17 participated.

5|$|According to Herodotus, the Persian commanders were {{concerned}} {{that they would not}} be able to defeat the Ionian fleet and, therefore, would not be able to take Miletus. So they sent the exiled Ionian tyrants to Lade, <b>where</b> <b>each</b> tried to persuade his fellow citizens to desert to the Persians. This approach was initially unsuccessful, but in the week-long delay before the battle, divisions arose in the Ionian camp. These divisions led to the Samians secretly agreeing to the terms offered by the Persians, but remained with the other Ionians for the time being.|$|E
5|$|Also during 1956, the Fantasyland Depot, a new {{station with}} a Medieval theme and {{consisting}} of a covered platform with no station building, was created for the DRR in the Fantasyland section. By the time this new station was added, the DRR's system of having one train assigned to a single station and using sidings to pass trains stopped at stations was abandoned and replaced by the current system <b>where</b> <b>each</b> train stops at every station along the railroad's route. Fantasyland Depot was removed by July 1966 when the It's a Small World attraction, originally built for the 1964 New York World's Fair, was installed.|$|E
