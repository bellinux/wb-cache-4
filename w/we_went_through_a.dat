40|$|Abstract. A major {{challenge}} in normative multiagent systems (NMAS) is how norms can be effectively applied to their entities and easily managed. These tasks are arduous because norms are usually written for general purposes, hindering {{a more precise}} regulation. In this paper, <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>an</b> operational approach to implement regulative norms in multiagent systems. In our approach, abstract norms are embodied with domain values according to agents’ current contexts. Thus, we try {{to bridge the gap}} between the theoretical work on norms and practical normative systems providing a solution to implement concrete regulative norms in NMAS. The rationale of the approach is described via a motivating example from the domain of international supply-chains...|$|R
60|$|On quitting Liddes, the road, {{or rather}} path, for it had dwindled to that, led through a valley that had some low meadows; {{after which the}} ascents became more decided, though the course had always been upward. The {{vegetation}} gradually grew less and less, the tree diminishing to the bush, and finally disappearing altogether, while the grasses became coarse and wiry, or were entirely superseded by moss. <b>We</b> <b>went</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> hamlet or two, composed of stones stained apparently with iron ore, and, as the huts were covered with the same material, instead of lending the landscape a more humanized air, they rather added to its appearance of sterile dreariness.

And yet how unlike in that something ethereal in its aspect, as of a nave in a cloud cathedral, its far-stretching shining floors and walls and columns, pure white and pearl-gray, faintly touched with colors of exquisite delicacy. And over it all was the roof of white or pale gray glass tinged with golden-red--the roof which I had seen from the outside when it seemed to me like a cloud resting on the stony summit of a hill.|$|E

The road passes {{directly}} through one of them, {{and the other is}} high up on the rocks exactly above it. The valley is so narrow, and the banks are so steep, that there is no other possible place for the road except through the lower castle. The road has to twist and twine about, too, just before it comes to the castle gates, and after it goes away from them on the other side, so that every thing that passes along has some guns or other pointing at them from the castle for more than a mile. I don't see how any enemy could possibly get into France this way.|$|E

But the speechless aunt, I gathered, didn't approve--having doubts of my religiosity. Whenever we were estranged we could keep apart for days; and to begin with, every such separation was a relief. And then I would want her; a restless longing would come upon me. I would think of the flow of her arms, of the soft, gracious bend of her body. I would lie awake or dream of a transfigured Marion of light and fire. It was indeed Dame Nature driving me on to womankind in her stupid, inexorable way; but I thought it was the need of Marion that troubled me. So I always went back to Marion at last and made it up and more or less conceded or ignored whatever thing had parted us, and more and more I urged her to marry me....|$|E

'Just as I {{was falling}} asleep last night, I heard a horse's tramp {{on the grass}} and a knock at the door, and there, when I came out, was a fine-looking dark man, mounted on a black horse, and he told me to get ready in all haste, for a lady was in great want of me. As soon as I put on my cloak and things, he took me by the hand, and I was sitting behind him before I felt myself stirring. [...] "Where are we going, sir?" [...] says I.

I was now alone, and walked up to the women, when I found two; one, a lady, in dress and manner, and the other a person that I have always supposed was her servant. The first was in white; the last in a dark calico. They were both under thirty, judging from their looks; and the lady was exceedingly well-looking They were much alarmed; and, as I came up, the lady asked me if I would hurt her. I told her no; and that no person should harm her, while she remained with us. This relieved her, and she was able to give an account of her errand on the field of battle. Our looks, half intoxicated, and begrimed with the smoke of a battle, as we were, certainly were enough to alarm her; but I do not think one of the three would have hesitated about fighting for a female, that they thus found weeping, in this manner, in the open field. The maid was crying also. Simeon Grant, and Southard, did make use of some improper language, at first; but I brought them up, and they said they were sorry, and would go all lengths, with me, to protect the women. The fact was, these men supposed we had fallen in with common camp followers; but I had seen too much of officers' wives, in my boyhood, not to know that this was one.|$|E
40|$|Market share {{attraction}} {{models are}} useful tools for analyzing competitive structures. The models {{can be used}} to infer cross-effects of marketing-mix variables, but also the own effects can be adequately estimated while conditioning on competitive reactions. Important features of attraction models are that they incorporate that market shares sum to unity and that the market shares of individual brands are in between 0 and 1. Next to analyzing competitive structures, attraction models are also often considered for forecasting market shares. The econometric analysis of the market share attraction model has not received much attention.

There were two dusty and tattered banners hanging on the wall, and the attendant promised to make us laugh by something that he would tell us about them. The joke was that these two banners had been in the battle of Bunker Hill; and our countrymen, he said, always smiled on hearing this. He had discovered us to be Americans by the notice we took of a mural tablet in the choir, to the memory of a Lieutenant-Governor Clarke, of New York, who died in Chester before the Revolution. From the chapter-house he ushered us back into the nave, ever and anon pointing out some portion of the edifice more ancient than the rest, and when I asked him how he knew this, he said that he had learnt it from the archaeologists, who could read off such things like a book.
