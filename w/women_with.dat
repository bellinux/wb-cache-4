5|$|Most of {{the women}} who {{reported}} homosexual activity had not experienced it more than ten times. Fifty-one percent of women reporting homosexual experience had only one partner. <b>Women</b> <b>with</b> post-graduate education had a higher prevalence of homosexual experience, followed by <b>women</b> <b>with</b> a college education; the smallest occurrence was among <b>women</b> <b>with</b> education no higher than eighth grade. However, Kinsey's methodology was criticized.|$|E
5|$|The {{numbers of}} <b>women</b> <b>with</b> SCI giving birth and having healthy babies are increasing. Around {{a half to}} two-thirds of <b>women</b> <b>with</b> SCI report {{they might want to}} have children, and 14–20% do get {{pregnant}} at least once. Although female fertility is not usually permanently reduced by SCI, there is a stress response that can happen immediately post-injury that alters levels of fertility-related hormones in the body. In about half of women, menstruation stops after the injury but then returns within an average of five months—it returns within a year for a large majority. After menstruation returns, <b>women</b> <b>with</b> SCI become pregnant at a rate close to that {{of the rest of the}} population.|$|E
5|$|<b>Women</b> <b>with</b> Lynch {{syndrome}} {{should begin}} to have annual biopsy screening {{at the age of}} 35. Some <b>women</b> <b>with</b> Lynch syndrome elect to have a prophylactic hysterectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy to greatly reduce the risk of endometrial and ovarian cancer.|$|E

5|$|As {{measured}} on women undergoing in vitro fertilization, a longer menstrual cycle length {{is associated with}} higher pregnancy and delivery rates, even after age adjustment. Delivery rates after IVF have been estimated to be almost doubled for <b>women</b> <b>with</b> a menstrual cycle length of more than 34 days compared with <b>women</b> <b>with</b> a menstrual cycle length shorter than 26 days. A longer menstrual cycle length is also significantly associated with better ovarian response to gonadotropin stimulation and embryo quality.|$|E
5|$|Common {{problems}} {{women experience}} post-SCI are pain with intercourse and difficulty achieving orgasm. Around half of <b>women</b> <b>with</b> SCI {{are able to}} reach orgasm, usually when their genitals are stimulated. Some women report the sensation of orgasm {{to be the same}} as before the injury, and others say the sensation is reduced.|$|E
50|$|Nearly 15 {{million women}} in the U.S. earn too little to cover basic living {{expenses}} for their families, despite working in full-time, year-round jobs. Education is one proven strategy for raising incomes.

5|$|Compared {{with the}} options {{available}} for treating sexual dysfunction in men (for whom results are concretely observable), those available for women are limited. For example, PDE5 inhibitors, oral medications for treating erectile dysfunction in men, {{have been tested}} {{for their ability to}} increase sexual responses such as arousal and orgasm in women—but no controlled trials have been done in <b>women</b> <b>with</b> SCI, and trials in other women yielded only inconclusive results. In theory, women's sexual response could be improved using a vacuum device made to draw blood into the clitoris, but few studies on treatments for sexual function in <b>women</b> <b>with</b> SCI have been carried out. There is a particular paucity of information outside the area of reproduction.|$|E

5|$|Genetic {{disorders}} {{can also}} cause endometrial cancer. Overall, hereditary causes contribute to 2–10% of endometrial cancer cases. Lynch syndrome, an autosomal dominant genetic disorder that mainly causes colorectal cancer, also causes endometrial cancer, especially before menopause. <b>Women</b> <b>with</b> Lynch syndrome have a 40–60%risk of developing endometrial cancer, higher than their risk of developing colorectal (bowel) or ovarian cancer. Ovarian and endometrial cancer develop simultaneously in 20% of people. Endometrial cancer nearly always develops before colon cancer, on average, 11years before. Carcinogenesis in Lynch syndrome comes from a mutation in MLH1 and/or MLH2: genes that participate {{in the process of}} mismatch repair, which allows a cell to correct mistakes in the DNA. Other genes mutated in Lynch syndrome include MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2, which are also mismatch repair genes. <b>Women</b> <b>with</b> Lynch syndrome represent 2–3% of endometrial cancer cases; some sources place this as high as 5%. Depending on the gene mutation, <b>women</b> <b>with</b> Lynch syndrome have different risks of endometrial cancer. With MLH1 mutations, the risk is 54%; with MSH2, 21%; and with MSH6, 16%.|$|E

5|$|<b>Women</b> <b>with</b> {{a family}} history of endometrial cancer are at higher risk. Two genes most {{commonly}} associated with some other women's cancers, BRCA1 and BRCA2, do not cause endometrial cancer. There is an apparent link with these genes but it is attributable to the use of tamoxifen, a drug that itself can cause endometrial cancer, in breast and ovarian cancers. The inherited genetic condition Cowden syndrome can also cause endometrial cancer. <b>Women</b> <b>with</b> this disorder have a 5–10%lifetime risk of developing endometrial cancer, compared to the 2–3%risk for unaffected women.|$|E
5|$|A 2004 {{analysis}} of data from 53 studies involving 83,000 <b>women</b> <b>with</b> breast cancer reported no increased risk among women who had had either an induced or spontaneous abortion.

5|$|However, the {{examination}} of daily moods in <b>women</b> <b>with</b> measuring ovarian hormones may indicate a less powerful connection.
