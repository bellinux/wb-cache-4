500|$|Coincidentally Larry Hama, then {{an editor}} at Marvel, had begun to design {{characters}} and background for a series concept he was pitching that would be entitled Fury Force, about a team of futuristic super-soldiers affiliated with S.H.I.E.L.D., an existing Marvel Universe property combining military and science fiction genre elements. As Hama tells it, he got the job of writing for the series because Marvel had asked every other available creator to write it {{and no one else}} would. Unable to find other writing work, he later said that, [...] "If they had asked me to write Barbie, I <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>that,</b> too." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Any {{other man}} <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>that</b> before,” said Mrs. Wayne. “Still, I suppose Tony cannot help it, {{and he seems}} {{contented}} now.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing {{short of}} one of those big cannon <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>that,</b> Jack. Well, we shall see in the morning what damage is done." ...|$|E
60|$|And doubtless Reddy <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> just <b>that</b> {{thing but}} for the wisdom of sly old Granny.|$|R
6000|$|... "'I {{never made}} {{promises}} {{to any one}} but to you,' she answered; 'and I <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>that</b> if I <b>had</b> not liked you so much.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think you}} ought to search all the rivers--you <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to <b>do</b> <b>that</b> barefoot. He must have fallen in somewhere, or fallen down some place." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He shipped {{before the}} mast {{for the sake}} of being on the same ship as I was," [...] she said, with quivering lip; [...] "it is not every man who <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>that,</b> and I—I—" ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was useless}} {{for me to}} argue against his purpose, {{whatever}} that might be, for the fellow was determined, and even though I had gone {{down on my knees}} to him he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>that</b> which he said.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, {{that was}} an affair! Hadn't you and I been aboard, the ship never <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>that.</b> We are the very {{offspring}} of luck! There was the affair of the wreck off Madagascar--there are bloody currents in the Pacific, too, I find, Miles." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You made me go {{off with}} him in the night, like a--like a--! Oh, Tetchen, was that {{treating}} me as though I had been your own? <b>Would</b> you <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>that</b> for your own child?" ...|$|R
6000|$|BROADBENT. He {{has joined}} the Tariff Reform League. He <b>would</b> never <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>that</b> if his mind had not been weakened. [Beginning to declaim] He has fallen a victim to the arts of a {{political}} charlatan who-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That word," [...] said Douglas, [...] "is enough--I go. This only let me say, {{that not}} for wealth or title <b>would</b> I <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>that</b> which I <b>have</b> done--Mary Stewart will not, and the Queen cannot, reward me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I don't believe {{anyone but}} an Irishman <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>that.</b> I expect you'll {{have to wait}} till little brother amoeba gets grown up before you'll find a reader. He don't seem to take much stock of things just at present. Well, Herr Professor, what are the prospects?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{all very}} well talking," [...] said Mr. Damer, {{bringing}} up his donkey nearly alongside that of Mr. Ingram, and ignoring his daughter's presence, just as he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>that</b> of his dog; [...] "but you must admit that political power is more equally distributed in England {{than it is in}} America." ...|$|E
60|$|It wasn't that Whitefoot minded {{hunting for}} food. He <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>that</b> anyway, {{even though he}} had had close at hand a store-house with plenty in it. But he would have felt easier in his mind. He would have had the {{comfortable}} feeling that if the weather turned so bad that he could not easily get out and about, he would not have to go hungry.|$|E
5000|$|If {{you catch}} up with another boat {{and you want to}} pass it to leeward, you may not sail above your proper course i.e. you shall not luff higher than you <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> if <b>that</b> boat wasn't there (Rule 17) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear," [...] he said, [...] "I {{want you}} to think--of your husband--of Everard. He was a soldier once for a short time, was he not? What {{do you think he}} <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> now <b>that</b> this terrible war has come?" ...|$|R
50|$|He was {{transferred}} to Raspberry Dorm due to a violent incident involving a teacher. He did not get expelled as Azusa believed Nagisa <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>that</b> without a good reason, so talked the teachers into letting him stay.|$|R
60|$|Old Cheeseman {{one night}} walked in his sleep, put his hat on over his night-cap, {{got hold of}} a fishing-rod and a cricket-bat, and went down into the parlour, where they {{naturally}} thought from his appearance he was a Ghost. Why, he never <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>that</b> if his meals had been wholesome. When we all begin to walk in our sleeps, I suppose they'll be sorry for it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{bring up}} that old affair!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "What I did then {{could not be}} helped. When we had our talk about the sister with whom you had fallen in love, I had no idea she was Sylvia Raynor, the {{daughter}} of my hostess. When I discovered the truth, I had to drop the whole affair. Any person of honor <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>that.</b> I could not help its being funny, you know." ...|$|E
6000|$|The Duchess {{looked at}} her from head to foot. Perhaps it was with an impulse to treat her {{impertinence}} as she <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>that</b> of a dependant; but the old lady never forgot herself: she only shrugged her shoulders and said, with studied politeness, 'When I unfortunately interrupted your consultation with this eminent physician, it was {{to ask you a}} question regarding this English family. Will you do me the honour to enter my cabinet?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{say what}} I think. But you <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>that.</b> And {{though you are}} not industrious, you are far too active and too clever for such a life. Now you are {{probably}} in earnest as to the future.' ...|$|R
60|$|A latent {{power in}} the man, or boy, was {{revealed}} by the circumstance <b>that</b> Somerset <b>did</b> not feel, as he <b>would</b> ordinarily <b>have</b> <b>done,</b> <b>that</b> {{it was a matter}} of profound indifference to him whether this gentleman-photographer were a likeable person or no.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, Aunt Mary is very anxious. Oh, I <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> {{anything}} <b>that</b> you <b>had</b> not vexed {{them now}} and killed this poor dear pretty thing!' said Constance, stroking down the glossy feathers of the still warm victim, and laying them against her cheek, almost tearfully.|$|R
60|$|Here was {{the single}} {{essential}} detail of my letter answered three days after I had mailed my inquiry. I might have saved myself the trouble and the postage--and {{a few years ago}} I <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>that</b> very thing, for I would have argued that my sudden and strong impulse to write and ask some questions of a stranger on the under side of the globe meant that the impulse came from that stranger, and that he would answer my questions of his own motion if I would let him alone.|$|E
60|$|Prince K---, sitting sadly {{alone in}} his study, was told by his alarmed {{servants}} that a mysterious young man had forced {{his way into the}} hall, refused to tell his name and the nature of his business, and would not move from there till he had seen his Excellency in private. Instead of locking himself up and telephoning for the police, as nine out of ten high personages <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>that</b> evening, the Prince gave way to curiosity and came quietly to the door of his study.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ginger, dear--I'm afraid {{this address}} {{is going to}} give you rather a shock, and I'm feeling very guilty. I'm running away, and I haven't even stopped to say good-bye. I can't help it. I know it's weak and cowardly, but I simply can't help it. I stood it for a day or two, and then I saw that it was no good. (Thank you for leaving me alone and not coming round to see me. Nobody else but you <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>that.</b> But then, nobody ever has been or ever could be so {{understanding}} as you.)" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Quite {{right of}} her,” said Mrs. Yonelet with vague approval; “it’s what any girl of spirit <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done.</b> Still, <b>that</b> {{was a year}} or two ago, I believe; Bertie is older now, and so is Teresa. Naturally she must be anxious to see him settled.” ...|$|R
50|$|At the Final Tribal Council, Lacina voiced her {{frustration}} to Vlachos for swearing on his badge {{and going back}} on his word, and said she <b>would</b> <b>have</b> never <b>done</b> <b>that.</b> However, she ultimately cast her vote for Vlachos to win, which he did in a 8-1 vote.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{sure they}} <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>that,</b> father, seeing {{how well you}} do for them, and what good money the Venture earns. Why, I have heard you say she returns her value every two years. So that they might well have gone without a fortnight's {{earnings}} without murmuring." ...|$|R
60|$|A compact heavy rock, not laminated, with an irregular, angular, highly crystalline, fracture; it abounds with {{distinct}} crystals of glassy feldspar, and the crystalline feldspathic base is mottled {{with a black}} mineral, {{which on}} the weathered surface is seen to be aggregated into small crystals, some perfect, but the greater number imperfect. I showed this specimen to an experienced geologist, and asked him what it was; he answered, as I think every one else <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done,</b> <b>that</b> it was a primitive greenstone. The weathered surface, also, of the banded variety in Figure 4, strikingly resembles a worn fragment of finely laminated gneiss.|$|E
60|$|Frank {{afterward}} {{confessed that}} his first impulse was to run toward the door, and he was never quite certain why {{he did not do}} so, but he stood still holding up the lantern, while his heart throbbed painfully and his flesh seemed to creep. The bent figure was unnaturally still, but when the schooner lurched and the table slanted it fell forward a little farther, all in one piece--which was how he thought of it--and as a heavy sack <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done.</b> <b>That</b> was too much for Frank, and clambering up the steps he ran back to Harry in breathless haste.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay! that's the rub! But I've {{not seen}} one whom I could mate with her--let alone {{one who would}} keep up the old house. Giles <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>that</b> passably, though he were scarce worthy of the wench, even without--" [...] An {{expressive}} shake of the head denoted the rest. [...] "And now if he ever come home at all, 'twill be as a foul-mouthed, plundering scarecrow, like the kites of men-at-arms, who, if they lose not their lives, lose all that makes an honest life in the Italian wars. I would have writ to Edmund Burgess, but I hear his elder brother is dead, and he is driving a good traffic at York. Belike too he is wedded." ...|$|E
6000|$|He <b>would</b> even <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>that,</b> [...] But men said: [...] "Get out!" [...] and the State remarked: [...] "Scat!" [...] I mention these {{incidents}} merely to show [...] That the vengeance he took was uncommonly low. [...] Revenge, at the best, is {{the act of}} a Siou, [...] But for trifles-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{are drawing}} in upon her fast," [...] he said, [...] "but she is {{travelling}} well, too; {{much better than}} I should <b>have</b> thought she <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> with <b>that</b> rig. I think she has got a better wind than we have. She has only made one short tack in {{for the last two}} hours." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{instant he}} {{presented}} himself, Jonas {{got up from}} his chair, and swearing a great oath, caught it in his grasp, as if he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> felled Tom {{to the ground with}} it. As he most unquestionably <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done,</b> but <b>that</b> his very passion and surprise made him irresolute, and gave Tom, in his calmness, an opportunity of being heard.|$|R
