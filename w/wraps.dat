They include fully <b>wrapped,</b> partially <b>wrapped</b> and non-uniformly <b>wrapped</b> concrete cylinders. The non-uniformly <b>wrapped</b> concrete cylinders provided higher compressive strengths and strain for FRP-confined concrete, in comparison with conventional fully <b>wrapping</b> arrangements.

5|$|A {{second major}} cause of {{morbidity}} and mortality in the North Atlantic right whale is entanglement in fishing gear. Right whales ingest plankton with wide-open mouths, risking entanglement in any rope or net fixed in the water column. Rope <b>wraps</b> around their upper jaws, flippers and tails. Some are able to escape, but others remain tangled. Whales can be successfully disentangled, if observed and aided. In July 1997, the U.S. NOAA introduced the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan, which seeks to minimize whale entanglement in fishing gear and record large whale sightings in an attempt to estimate numbers and distribution.|$|E

40|$|The <b>wrapping</b> {{of columns}} with Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP) sheets {{has become a}} common {{technique}} for the protective hardening of reinforced concrete columns against blast pressure effects. FRP <b>wrap</b> provides added strength and ductility, resulting in an economical solution to harden existing columns subject to blast threats. This paper investigates the effectiveness of FRP <b>wrapping</b> on typical reinforced concrete columns subject to various blast pressures and with different <b>wrapping</b> configuration. Single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) analyses of the unwrapped and <b>wrapped</b> columns are carried out with FWrapSDOF, a proprietary SDOF analysis code for simulating the response of FRP <b>wrapped</b> columns to blast loading. The SDOF results are compared with the actual test results of unwrapped and <b>wrapped</b> columns subject to various blast pressures and with different <b>wrapping</b> configuration. This is to evaluate the fidelity of SDOF analyses for FRP <b>wrapped</b> reinforced concrete columns...|$|R

We propose a novel <b>wrapped</b> skew Gaussian process which enriches the class of 	<b>wrapped</b> Gaussian process. The <b>wrapped</b> skew Gaussian process enables more flexible marginal distributions than the symmetric ones 	arising under the <b>wrapped</b> Gaussian process and it allows straightforward interpretation of parameters. We clarify that replication through time enables criticism of 	the <b>wrapped</b> process in favor of the <b>wrapped</b> skew process.|$|R

40|$|Esophageal {{squamous}} cell carcinoma (ESCC) is a highly aggressive cancer whose underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. The natural antisense transcript (NAT) <b>WRAP</b> 53 regulates p 53 expression and <b>WRAP</b> 53 protein is a component of telomerase. NATs play key roles in carcinogenesis, and although <b>WRAP</b> 53 is known to increase cancer cell survival, its role in ESCC clinicopathology is unknown. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate <b>WRAP</b> 53 expression in ESCC and to correlate it with clinicopathological characteristics. <b>WRAP</b> 53 mRNA and protein expression was measured by quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blotting, respectively, in 4 ESSC cells lines and in 45 paired ESCC and non-neoplastic esophageal mucosa tissues. To correlate <b>WRAP</b> 53 protein expression with clinicopathological characteristics, immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed on 134 ESCC and 85 non-neoplastic esophageal mucosa tissues. Expression of <b>WRAP</b> 53 was detected in all ESCC cell lines and was upregulated in the ESCC tissues compared with the corresponding non-neoplastic tissues (P< 0. 01). More cells expressed <b>WRAP</b> 53 protein in the ESCC tissues than in the non-neoplastic tissues (P< 0. 01). Overexpression of <b>WRAP</b> 53 was significantly correlated with tumor infiltration depth (P =  0. 000), clinical stage (P =  0. 001), and lymph node metastasis (P =  0. 025). <b>Wrap</b> 53 expression was not correlated with age, gender, or tumor differentiation. This report indicates increased expression of <b>WRAP</b> 53 in ESCC and that <b>WRAP</b> 53 overexpression is correlated with tumor progression. <b>WRAP</b> 53 may play a significant role in ESCC; accordingly, <b>WRAP</b> 53 could be a useful biomarker for ESCC...|$|R
