According to him, [...] "It was always Steve's intention that the narrator be a nod to his beloved Jacques Cousteau." [...] Kenny described Cousteau's voice as [...] "very dispassionate, very removed, very flatline, even when he’s describing something miraculous and beautiful." [...] At first, {{they found that the}} narrator [...] "just sounds bored," [...] so they decided that he [...] "has to sound a little fun and playful."

500|$|When George Lucas first {{approached}} Steven Spielberg for Raiders of the Lost Ark, Spielberg recalled, [...] "George said if I {{directed the}} first one then I would have to direct a trilogy. He had three stories in mind. It turned out George did not have three stories in mind and <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> up subsequent stories." [...] Spielberg and Lucas attributed the film's tone, which was darker than Raiders of the Lost Ark, to their personal moods following the breakups of their relationships (George with his wife, and Spielberg with his girlfriend). In addition, Lucas felt [...] "it {{had to have been}} a dark film. The way Empire Strikes Back was the dark second act of the Star Wars trilogy." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Freedom" [...] was {{directed}} by Sean De Sparengo, and filmed in London in July 2011. It took one day to film, and is primarily set in an underground club with red lighting, reminiscent of that featured in the group's 2002 single [...] "Freak like Me". De Sparengo commented on the concept and visual attributes of the video, saying: [...] "One {{of the interesting things}} for the concept for this video is that we knew <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> everything look incredibly beautiful. It was about making a video where the Sugababes felt like they were {{at the top of their}} game." [...] The video made its premiere in August 2011. A [...] clip was uploaded to the Sugababes official VEVO channel on YouTube. Daily Mirror praised the band's appearance in the video.|$|E
500|$|Prop master Rob Smith {{created the}} shapeshifter device and later regretted its design. He {{had joined the}} series during its second season, and had to quickly {{manufacture}} props while working under time and budget constraints. He explained, [...] " [...] first episode <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the shape-shifter device, {{the thing that you}} put into your mouth and it transforms one person into another person. I was brand new here and I wasn’t happy with the way that turned out, and it came back in about 5 or 6 episodes. Every time it came back I was like, ‘Oh, I wish I could have that time over again to redo this one." [...] He added, [...] "A lot of the time, I [...] actually see [...] on set, so I watched the episode to see how everything comes together." ...|$|E
500|$|Due to its low budget, Becoming Jane {{was filmed}} on a [...] "tight" [...] {{schedule}} of eight weeks from March to May 2006. Jarrold observed however that because Ecosse {{was not a}} film studio, he had more creative freedom. Bernstein stated of filming, [...] "We recreated a world that Jane Austen lovers can recognise and associate with. But hopefully we can also take them into areas and places like the boxing club, the cricket game and the fair that do not feature in Jane Austen's fiction. They are sort of seedy and dangerous areas that are not normally associated with Austen." [...] Jarrold found filming [...] "very difficult. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it work in the locations that we had as efficiently as possible." [...] Filming outdoors was often so cold that Hathaway turned blue and had difficulty saying her lines; Automated Dialogue Replacement in post-production helped correct this by re-dubbing her lines.|$|E

500|$|Filming {{began in}} New York in October 1986. Madonna {{would ask for}} five minutes to study the script for the scene they were filming. For example, before {{a scene in which}} she needed to appear out of breath, she did a series of push-ups before going on set. Dunne {{observed}} that [...] " [...] likes her first take best. I think my best is around fourth. She always says, 'You got it, you got it,' and she was driving me crazy just like her character would. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a compromise as to which take is the best." [...] Madonna wanted Foley to give her proper direction on set, but he preferred her to be her real self, rather than the persona in her music videos. Regarding her acting abilities, Foley stressed on the fact that Madonna was very uptight and into every detail, determined to have the correct portrayal. [...] "That's probably why it wasn't so good. In Desperately Seeking Susan, when she didn't know what she was doing, she was being natural and at her best." ...|$|E
500|$|The 2001 film Legally Blonde {{marked a}} turning point in Witherspoon's career; she starred as Elle Woods, a fashion-merchandising major who decides to become a law student in order to follow her ex-boyfriend to Harvard Law School. Witherspoon said about the role, [...] "When I read Legally Blonde, I was like, 'She's from Beverly Hills, she's rich, she's in a sorority. She has a great boyfriend. Oh yeah, she gets dumped. Who cares? I still hate her.' So <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> sure she was the kind of person you just can't hate." [...] Legally Blonde was a box-office hit, {{grossing}} US$96 million domestically. Witherspoon's performance earned her praise from critics, as the press began referring to her as [...] "the new Meg Ryan". Roger Ebert commented, [...] "Witherspoon effortlessly animated this material with sunshine and quick wit", and Salon.com noted that [...] "she [...] delineates Elle's character beautifully". Meanwhile, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer concluded, [...] "Witherspoon is a talented comedian who can perk up a scene just by marching in full of pep and drive and she powers this modest little comedy almost single-handedly." [...] For her work, Witherspoon garnered her second Golden Globe Best Actress nomination and an MTV Movie Award for Best Comedic Performance.|$|E
500|$|In 1880, an Australian side captained by Billy Murdoch toured England. The {{tourists}} {{had difficulty}} finding good opponents; most county sides turned them down, although Yorkshire played two unofficial matches against them. There {{was a lot}} of bad will, exacerbated by the Australians' arrival in England at short notice, to some extent unexpectedly. [...] This was heightened by an English perception that the Australians came frequently to maximise their profits; at the time, professionalism was frowned upon. [...] In his autobiography Lord Harris wrote, [...] "They asked no-one's goodwill in the matter, and it was felt this was a discourteous way of bursting in on our arrangements; and the result was they played scarcely any counties and were not generally recognised ... We felt <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a protest against too frequent visits". Harris initially shunned the team and tried to avoid correspondence and meetings with them. An attempt to arrange a game against an English XI for the Cricketers' Fund was turned down, and public advertisements in the newspapers were shunned. W.G. Grace was sympathetic to the Australians and felt that they were not to blame for the riot. He attempted to arrange a game for them at Lord's, but was rebuffed by the Marylebone Cricket Club, who gave the excuse that the ground was not available.|$|E

500|$|The Sex Pistols {{film was}} {{completed}} by Temple, who received sole credit for the script after McLaren had his name taken off the production. Finally released in 1980, The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle still largely reflects McLaren's vision. It is a fictionalised, farcical, partially animated retelling of the band's history and aftermath with McLaren in the lead role, Jones as second lead, and contributions from Vicious (including his memorable performance of [...] "My Way") and Cook. It incorporates promotional videos shot for [...] "God Save the Queen" [...] and [...] "Pretty Vacant" [...] and extensive documentary footage as well, much of it focusing on Rotten. In Temple's description, he and McLaren conceived it as a [...] "very stylised...polemic". They were reacting {{to the fact that}} the Pistols had become the [...] "poster on the bedroom wall of the day where you kneel down last thing at night and pray to your rock god. And that was never the point.... The myth had to be dynamited in some way. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> this film in a way to enrage the fans". In the film, McLaren claims to have created the band from scratch and engineered its notorious reputation; much of what structure the loose narrative has is based on McLaren's teaching a series of [...] "lessons" [...] to be learned from [...] "an invention of mine they called the punk rock".|$|E
500|$|Although Salman Khan was {{initially}} signed {{for the lead}} role, he later withdrew due to creative differences with the director. Shah Rukh Khan (who had originally declined due to a scheduling conflict with Karan Johar's Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna) was later confirmed as Kabir Khan. Khan accepted the role partly because he used to play hockey in college: [...] "I feel hockey as a sport has been monstrously neglected in our country. I used {{to play the game}} during college. In fact, I was quite a good hockey player. So the role was a lot like going back to my past." [...] Some media sources called the actor's role offbeat, since it departed from his usual romantic image and included neither lip synched songs nor a single female lead. Casting of the 16 actresses as the hockey players took over six months. Amin described the process as [...] "very, very difficult" [...] and [...] "very strenuous because the requirement was they had to play – and act". A four-month training camp was held where the girls learned the rules of the game, took acting lessons and followed a strict diet; safety precautions were also taken. According to Amin, [...] "Learning hockey is very tricky unlike, say, football. You {{have to know how to}} hold the stick, how to manoeuvre it, so it doesn't look fake on screen ... For those who were originally players, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> sure they were able to act as well. The dialogue was weighty; it isn't frivolous. It has to be delivered with a certain tone, in a certain manner". The actors, including Khan and the rest of the supporting cast, participated in a number of rehearsals and script readings before principal photography began.|$|E

A young widow who lives with her daughter Julie, Natalie lost her husband Mitch {{when he was shot}} down over Kosovo in 1998. She first appears in [...] "Mr. Monk and the Red Herring" [...] (3.10).

2500|$|Of {{filming the}} moment in which Rebecca pushes Paul, Hall said [...] "The way Stefan Dennis (who plays Paul) and I {{interpreted}} it and acted it was we had to satisfy ourselves {{that it was one}} of those random and instantaneous mistakes people make. When we worked on the scene <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it look like she had a moment of fury that caused her to do that." [...] Hall knew that viewers would be surprised at Rebecca being the culprit and she herself was surprised by the fan's reactions. Some women questioned how Rebecca could do such a thing to Paul, even though he cheated on her and lied to her. Hall thought that someone could get [...] "so fed up" [...] that they made a rash decision that is not something they thought they could ever do. In September 2010, Rebecca's confession and explanation for the night she pushed Paul was broadcast. The episode initially saw Declan Napier (Erin Mullally) admit to Kate Ramsay (Ashleigh Brewer) that he was responsible to protect his mother. Hall added that [...] "the ramifications of Rebecca pushing Paul over the mezzanine are far-reaching".|$|E
2500|$|At {{the close}} of the band's tour in support of Light Grenades (2006), the band entered an {{extended}} hiatus. Vocalist Brandon Boyd noted, [...] "It's not that we were burned out being in a band or being in this band; I think that we, collectively, were feeling like if we didn't step away from this monster that we created then it would begin to consume us. [...] We had to plant some roots, lest we start to write songs about living on a tour bus. So we had to fall in love, we had to fall out of love, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> homes." [...] Guitarist Michael Einziger elaborated further, [...] "It just got to this point where we had been going strong for such {{a long period of time}} that we really accomplished all of our goals. [...] It was like, 'Ok, well what do we do now?' Obviously there are lots of things to do but I think we wanted to take some time, each of us personally, to explore a little bit and find out what the rest of the world was like."
