5000|$|Many {{children}} act {{out with}} aggression and have difficulty attaching and bonding because of deep-rooted fears. <b>When</b> <b>a</b> <b>child’s</b> needs are not {{met in a}} consistent, appropriate way, the child views the world as unsafe and trusts no one.

5|$|The Oubangui {{people of}} west Africa plant a tree <b>when</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> is born.

Rama took the sandalwood paste and put a Tilaka himself on his forehead and Tulsidas' forehead before disappearing.|$|E
5|$|Reading is {{considered}} to be a key element of vocabulary development in school-age children. Before children are able to read on their own, children can learn from others reading to them. Learning vocabulary from these experiences includes using context, as well as explicit explanations of words and/or events in the story. This may be done using illustrations in the book to guide explanation and provide a visual reference or comparisons, usually to prior knowledge and past experiences. Interactions between the adult and the child often include the child's repetition of the new word back to the adult. <b>When</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> begins to learn to read, their print vocabulary and oral vocabulary tend to be the same, as children use their vocabulary knowledge to match verbal forms of words with written forms. These two forms of vocabulary are usually equal up until grade 3. Because written language is much more diverse than spoken language, print vocabulary begins to expand beyond oral vocabulary. By age 10, children's vocabulary development through reading moves away from learning concrete words to learning abstract words.|$|E

25|$|In this stage, Piaget {{believed}} {{that the process of}} thinking and the intellectual development could be regarded {{as an extension of the}} biological process of the evolutionary adaptation of the species, which has also two on-going processes: assimilation and accommodation.
