An approach to benchmarking is innovation benchmarking, which is a concept used to describe what factors that contribute to a benchmarking success.

Measuring innovation can be difficult, and it is therefore important to find the right variables and using the right performance metrics to be able to analyze the best practice.

I argue that attentiveness to sticky slopes is important for three reasons. First, awareness of the prospect of a sticky slope can be important in long-term social movement strategizing. Where social movements are in pursuit of a cluster of related political ends, they will want to choose their tactics carefully so as to minimize the degree that their past accomplishments can be turned against them. Second, when deployed by legal actors, sticky slope arguments sometimes do not play true causal roles, but instead act as a mask for other, less tolerable justifications. Unmasking sticky slope logic can force legal policymakers to be more explicit about the rationales and implications of their decision. Third, sticky slopes reveal how prior victories are themselves sites of social conflict and controversy over meaning, which social movements will <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> their preferred ends...|$|E

40|$|The late {{historian}} Robin Evans, {{takes up}} the debate symbolised between Wblfflin, proposing that meaning is directly accessible through {{the form of a}} building, and Wittkower, arguing that meaning lies behind the form of architecture, in other texts and ideas.

He concludes that architecture, in its singular artistic physicality "suspends our disbelief in the ideal", offering a world that does not reflect culture, in all its fullness, but rather supplements culture 2 ̆ 7 s incompleteness. Architecture, like art is able to resolve that which in society and in other fields remains a contradiction, giving a picture (albeit fictional) of a harmonious and unified order.

Hagia Sofia is an architecture, observed and described in an almost devotional manner, as though addressing the architecture of the church is equivalent to a pious person addressing the church itself, and more significantly, addressing the Divine figure of God, through the architecture of the church.

40|$|Just {{over a year}} ago, in one of {{the first}} posts that {{appeared}} on this site (and one of the very first commentaries I had written for any blog), I directed readers to five short pieces worth checking out that had one thing in common: they were about China but not by China specialists per se. One was a London Review of Books essay by Pankaj Mishra, who we’ve gone on to link to or quote often and who will be represented in our China in 2008 : A Year of Great Significance, via a commentary on Tibet that first appeared on The Guardian’s lively and wide-ranging “Comment is Free” site. Now, in today’s New York Times Sunday Magazinehe has yet another piece likely to interest readers of this blog, which focuses mainly on the novelist Yu Hua (still best-known in the West as the author of To Live, which became a Zhang Yimou film), but features a cameo appearance by historian and “new left” cultural critic Wang Hui. Since the LRB essay alluded to above was devoted largely to Wang Hui (a close friend of Yu Hua’s), this latest publication of Mishra’s (which has the catchy title of “The Bonfire of China’s Vanities”) can be read as a kind of more literary-minded sequel to that earlier overview of intellectuals trends in the PRC. It is also interesting for what Yu Hua has to say to Mishra about various issues “China Beat” has addressed before, from the legacy of 1989 to recent upsurges in virulent nationalism. Readers who come away from “Bonfire of China’s Vanities” wanting to know more about Yu Hua or Wang Hui might <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> the following readings: a New Left Review essay on Dushu, the periodical that Wang formerly edited, and thisinterview with Yu Hua.

An interesting discussion of contemporary youthful nationalism to place beside the comments in Mishra’s piece is this Evan Osnos New Yorker article to which we’ve directed readers before...|$|E
40|$|The {{traditional}} {{theory of}} public finance {{has made a}} strong case for a major role for fiscal decentralization. This case is based on an improved allocation of resources in the public sector. And it has four basic elements. First, regional or local governments {{are in a position to}} adapt outputs of public services to the preferences and particular circumstances of their constituencies, as compared to a central solution which presumes that one size fits all. Second, in a setting of mobile households, individuals can seek out jurisdictions that provide outputs well suited to their tastes, thereby increasing the potential gains from the decentralized provision of public services (Tiebout 1956). Third, in contrast to the monopolist position of the central government, decentralized levels of government face competition from their neighbors; such competition constrains budgetary growth and provides pressures for the efficient provision of public services. And fourth, decentralization may encourage experimentation and innovation as individual jurisdictions are free to adopt new approaches to public policy; in this way, decentralization can provide a valuable Alaboratory for fiscal experiments. However, this basic economic rationale for decentralization of the public sector is not quite so simple and compelling as it appears. Some of the more recent literature provides, first, a thoughtful and provocative critique of the traditional view of fiscal decentralization, and, second, some new approaches that reveal its dark side, especially in practice. There is emerging, in short, a broader perspective on fiscal decentralization that raises some serious questions about its capacity to provide an unambiguously positive contribution to an improved performance of the public sector. My purpose in this paper is twofold. First, I want to review the basic theory of fiscal decentralization. There are some loose ends to the traditional argument that open up some intriguing issues. Second, I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> some of new literature on fiscal discipline in multilevel government. This literature has focused attention on some basic and destructive forces that can undermine the economic performance of a relatively decentralized public sector. I find it helpful to begin by revisiting a Decentralization Theorem that I formulated long ago. As a point of departure, I want to explain briefly why I introduced the proposition and the rationale for its particular form and proof. Fiscal Decentralization, Public Finance...|$|E

40|$|In {{thinking}} about Rancière and Law, as this collection exhorts us to do, I have turned {{my attention to}} one of the most well-known areas of Rancière’s writings, the Rights of Man. In “Who is the Subject of the Rights of Man?” (Rancière 2004 b), Rancière aimed a broadside at the rights-scepticism which can be traced in much of critical theory to the writings of Hannah Arendt (on the left), and an older tradition on the right exemplified by Edmund Burke and Jeremy Bentham. Rancière’s writings and thought cover a wide range of areas, but it is the famous focus on rights which interests me here, as it brings to bear the problematisation of the ‘subject’ which Rancière develops in his writings. Rancière does not take an ontological view of the subject. Rancière’s writings on human rights attempt to get out of an ontological trap he sees being promulgated in relation to them (Rancière 2004 b, p. 302). These writings on rights and the subject illustrate Rancière’s conception of politics as a process, which emphasises a dynamic staging of conflicts and the impossibility of stepping outside that discussion and conflict. My starting point is Daniel Defoe’s Robinson Crusoe. This eighteenth century piece of literature is key for the discussion about the subject of human rights, and the paradoxes which those rights contain. This novel was used in United Nations debates to justify parts of the drafting of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR). In basing the subject of human rights in part on the eponymous hero of the same novel, the drafting committee (advertently or inadvertently) constructed a vision of the human subject which conflated the figures of man and citizen. The subject of human rights was not a natural man, but intimately connected and indivisible from the society in which he was living. I connect Arendt’s critique of the right to have rights to these debates at the United Nations, illustrating how they lend support to Arendt’s criticisms of human rights. I then outline Rancière’s counter-critique of Arendt, and his defence of politics and rights. I show how Rancière’s distinction between politics and the police envisions a subject which is created through ‘dissensual’ acts. These acts of ‘dissensus’ are the very divisions, the strife or the conflict which constitutes the stage on which politics occurs (Rancière 2009, pp. 114 - 115, 122). Rancière’s subject does not need to act politically in an existing public sphere where individuals recognise each other as equal and distinct. Rather, the acts they commit help contest the very meaning of rights and politics; a politics which always entails the verification of equality as such. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> the consequences of this processual politics. I use Rancière’s writings on politics and his defence of rights to illustrate how, in his schema, political subjects can be formed and new subjects hitherto unrecognised can be created through dissensual acts. I argue that in Rancière, any judgment on the quality of a political act, and the subject it can create, is necessarily made ex post facto. Rancière’s separation of politics from ethics forces us to avoid pre-judgments of the political nature of acts. This carries the risk that the reader of Rancière will interpret only the acts they are already sympathetic towards as ‘political’ and dissensual. The political remains in the eye of the beholder. As a result, this processual politics must be supplemented with a later judgment to be able to differentiate between potential political acts. In treating Rancière as a serious thinker of modernity and of rights, we need a way to distinguish between an act which is, for example, carried out by racists or those who oppress rights, and an act carried out by a demonstrator or as an act of resistance against hegemony. I argue that it is possible, following Rancière, to conceive of both as acts of dissensual politics potentially giving rise to political subjects. This in turn highlights the key issue for me in relation to Rancière’s thought. How can we distinguish between the quality of actors who act politically, without falling back on a presumed political sphere (as in Arendt) or modern liberal political philosophy? I conclude that a stronger questioning of the types of judgment needed to differentiate between political acts is required to avoid Rancière’s thought being used to justify forms of action the reader finds sympathetic...|$|E

5000|$|Staniford is {{traveling}} to Europe {{because of his}} “irresolute mood” and he believes that “Europe is the place for American irresolution.” [...] Staniford <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> move to California or Colorado when he returns. He {{has a great deal}} of money but due to a bad business venture has lost much of it. He has many talents, but he <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> the land and operate a farm in the West. Dunham {{is traveling}} to Europe to see a somewhat long lost love of his, Miss. Hibbard. Dunham had proposed to Miss Hibbard but she had declined and left for Europe. A few weeks later she wrote to Dunham asking for him to take her back and marry. Both Staniford and Dunham are still in wonder as to why Lydia is on the ship. They think that Lydia lives in a boring town where nothing exciting ever happens, so what could have possibly occurred to force her to travel to Europe at such a young age? After having some conversation with Lydia they are both confused and amused as to how Lydia is so proper and intelligent.|$|R
40|$|In this {{treatise}} Proclus discusses ten {{problems on}} providence and fate, foreknowledge of the future, human responsibility, evil and punishment (or seemingly absence of punishment), social and individual responsibility for evil, and the unequal fate of different animals. These problems, he admits, had been discussed {{a thousand times}} in and outside philosophical schools. Yet, as he put it: we too have to discuss them, not because we imagine that the philosophers before us have said anything valuable, but because our soul desires 'to speak and hear about these problems and <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> itself and to discuss as it were with itself and {{is not willing to}} take arguments about these issues only from authorities outside'. Proclus exhorts his readers: we are to use his treatise as an opportunity to investigate these problems for ourselves 'in the secret recess of our soul' and 'exercise ourselves in the solutions of problems'. In fact, it makes no difference whether what we discuss has been said before by philosophers, so long as we express what corresponds to our own views. This exhortation may be the best presentation of the translation of this wonderful treatise from late antiquity. nrpages: viii, 183 status: publishe...|$|R
