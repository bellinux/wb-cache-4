5|$|After the {{conclusion}} of The Land of Gorch, Henson and his team had {{learned a great deal}} from being involved <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>production.</b> They gained institutional knowledge about adapting and quickly creating a television program within a seven-day period.

They were later able to use these skills and relationships on Henson's next television venture, The Muppet Show.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{red-headed}} myzomela {{is widely}} distributed, {{it is not}} abundant within its range. The largest recorded population was 5.5 birds per hectare or 2.2 per acre at Palmerston in the Northern Territory. The peak abundance of the species in the mangroves around Darwin Harbour during the mid-dry and early wet season coincided <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>production</b> of young and the flowering of the yellow mangrove (Ceriops australis).|$|E
5|$|Asmara Moerni was {{directed}} by Rd Ariffien, a former journalist who had {{been active in the}} nationalist and labour movements before turning to theatre. He had joined Union Films– the company behind Asmara Moerni– in 1940, making his debut with Harta Berdarah (Bloody Treasure). Union's head Ang Hock Liem produced, while the story was written by journalist Saeroen, who had joined Union after commercial success on Albert Balink's Terang Boelan (Full Moon, 1937) and <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>production</b> house Tan's Film.|$|E
5|$|Bakshi had {{selected}} {{a number of}} songs from his own record collection for the film's soundtrack, which were not used in the film due to {{the high costs of}} licensing the songs. The film was initially scored by singer Dan Hicks, who became involved <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>production</b> of the film in 1974. Because of the delay of the film's release, Hicks' label released the material from these sessions under the title It Happened One Bite. When the film was released in 1982, it had been rescored by John Madara.|$|E

5|$|Compounding matters was {{the fact}} that the {{supposedly}} deceased actors had signed contracts <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>production</b> which ensured that they would not appear in any type of media, motion pictures, or commercials for one year following the film's release. This was done in order to promote the idea that Cannibal Holocaust was truly the recovered footage of missing documentarians. During the subsequent court proceedings, questions arose as to why the actors were in no other media if they were alive as Deodato claimed.|$|E
5|$|HBO did {{not make}} a {{decision}} for four months after the pilot was delivered. In March 2010, HBO's decision to greenlight the series including the pilot was announced, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>production</b> of the series scheduled to start June 2010. HBO however demanded extensive reshoot of the pilot, and wanted all the scenes from Morocco scrapped. A cameo appearance by George RR Martin as a Pentoshi nobleman at Daenerys's wedding filmed in Morocco was therefore also cut. In all 90 percent of the pilot was re-shot in 2010, with some cast changes and a different director.|$|E
5|$|Heartstrings, {{like the}} first record, was very much {{influenced}} by film, and is recognized for its cinematic quality.

Howling Bells along <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>production</b> team watched Paris, Texas and Blue Velvet, in an effort to replicate the mood, emotion, and atmosphere of these two films in particular. Other films that {{played a significant role in}} the making of Heartstrings include, Badlands, Bonnie and Clyde, Klute, , Nashville, Pleasantville, The Last Picture Show, and Vivre sa vie.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to their Flying Dutchman recordings and subsequent Arista recordings, Winter in America utilized a sparse production quality and {{small number of}} sessions musicians. A small supporting line-up, featuring drummer Bob Adams and bassist Danny Bowens, contributed on a few cuts. Adams and Bowens, who studied with Scott-Heron at Lincoln University, arrived from the Pennsylvania-based college {{on the last day}} of recording on October 15, 1973. Scott-Heron and Jackson handled most of the vocals, songwriting, and instrumentation, and they were assisted by Williams <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>production.</b>|$|E
5|$|Steel was {{produced}} in bloomery furnaces for thousands of years, but its large-scale, industrial use only began after more efficient production methods were devised in the 17th century, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>production</b> of blister steel and then crucible steel. With {{the invention of the}} Bessemer process in the mid-19th century, a new era of mass-produced steel began. This was followed by the Siemens-Martin process and then the Gilchrist-Thomas process that refined the quality of steel. With their introductions, mild steel replaced wrought iron.|$|E
5|$|The {{commercialization of}} hip-hop dance {{continued}} into the 1990s and 2000s <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>production</b> of several television shows and movies such as The Grind, Planet B-Boy, Rize, StreetDance 3D, America's Best Dance Crew, Saigon Electric, the Step Up film series, and The LXD, a web series. Though the dance is established in entertainment, including mild representation in theater, it maintains a strong presence in urban neighborhoods {{which has led to}} the creation of street dance derivatives Memphis jookin, turfing, jerkin', and krumping.|$|E

5|$|The {{government}} exerts {{greater control}} over broadcast media than print media, especially due to finance and licensing. The Swiss Broadcasting Corporation, whose name was recently changed to SRG SSR, is charged <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>production</b> and broadcast of radio and television programmes. SRG SSR studios are distributed throughout the various language regions. Radio content is produced in six central and four regional studios while the television programmes are produced in Geneva, Zürich and Lugano. An extensive cable network also allows most Swiss to access the programmes from neighbouring countries.|$|E
5|$|The pre-Code horror cycle was {{motivated}} by financial necessity. Universal in particular buoyed itself <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>production</b> of horror hits such as Dracula (1931) and Frankenstein, then followed those successes up with Murders in the Rue Morgue (1932), The Mummy (1932), and The Old Dark House (1932). Other major studios responded with their own productions. Much like the crime film cycle, however, the intense boom of the horror cycle was ephemeral, and had fallen off {{at the box office}} {{by the end of the}} pre-Code era.|$|E
5|$|Thornton {{signed a}} {{contract}} with CMH Records to release the album. Following a contractual dispute, Fanatik J was released from the project. The album's production was completed by the One-Watt Sun production team based upon three completed vocal recordings and older unfinished recordings.
