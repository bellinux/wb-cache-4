In July 2012, Lynsey is strangled by an unseen person in similar circumstances to Silas' victims. When Silas demands to see Texas in relation to possible information on Lynsey's murder, Texas visits him {{in the mental health}} institution where he is serving his sentences. Silas taunts Texas by explaining how he killed her sister India. He tells Texas that another young woman will die the following day. Texas visits him again a few days later, and tells Silas that she is no longer frightened of him. Silas warns her that another copycat killing will soon occur. He explains that to prevent this he will tell her the identity of the killer if she gives him India's ring. Texas agrees and he tells her that the killer is Will Savage (James Atherton). Texas snatches the ring back, angering Silas. When on a routine appointment at the hospital, Silas fakes a heart attack. He escapes and visits Lynsey's body in the mortuary. Silas sees an apparition of Lynsey who he compliments, telling her she played a good game. Lynsey taunts him saying his game is over as he did not get to what he most wanted as someone else killed her. Silas tells her his game is not over. Silas kidnaps Texas in her flat and leads Texas to believe he will kill her before telling her that he will bide his time and then kill her, this way she will be living in fear of him. Silas then boards a bus, full of young women <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> a hen party.|$|E

To Armstrong it came as no surprise—the room was full of veterans of Project Gemini, the only people who could fly the lunar missions. Slayton talked about the planned missions and named Armstrong to the backup crew for Apollo 9, which at that stage was planned to be a medium Earth orbit test of the Lunar Module-Command/Service Module combination.

At 09:05, German observers reported that WN-61 was lost, and that one machine gun was still firing from WN-62. 150 men, mostly from G/16, having reached the top hampered more by minefields than by enemy fire, continued south to attack the WN-63 command post {{on the edge of}} Colleville. Meanwhile, E/16, led by Second Lieutenant John M. Spalding and Captain Robert L. Sheppard V, turned westward {{along the top of the}} bluffs, engaging in a two-hour battle for WN-64. His small group of just four men had effectively neutralized this point by mid-morning, taking 21 prisoners—just in time to prevent them from attacking freshly landing troops.
