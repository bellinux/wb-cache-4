As I got further into the Cope and Marsh story, and I liked the two less and less as people—which is different from liking them as characters, of course—I wanted to have a character in the book for the readers to root for, and neither of the scientists could fill that role. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> Knight had met Cope just before Cope died, I became convinced that he was the character I needed.|$|E

2500|$|The 16 year–old actress Lacey Turner {{was cast}} in the role. Turner had {{originally}} gone to audition for {{a part in the}} Miller family, but was given the part of Stacey instead. Commenting on her role, Turner said [...] "I was speechless <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> I had been cast as Stacey Slater especially as I knew I would be working with Jessie Wallace who is my favourite actress. I've watched the show since I was about four years old, and I used to live in a house that backed onto the EastEnders set so I used to watch them filming all the time. I always dreamt of being on the show and so I can't believe that I've fulfilled my greatest ambition!" [...] She added, [...] "I'm not like Stacey at all although I love playing her!

Initially Green was skeptical saying, [...] "I didn't know too much about them , but <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> [...] Interscope Records was involved, that was an alliance I didn't hesitate to make." [...] The Pussycat Dolls version was recorded around March adding two verses from rapper Busta Rhymes. Lead singer Nicole Scherzinger admitted that two records sounded identical. [...] "I had [...] version as a guide. But ours is just a bit fresher." [...] This song was initially offered to both Sugababes and Paris Hilton, but both declined. In 2006, Hilton claimed that she was presented with the track, but was not impressed with it, commenting. [...] "I think I did hear the song, but not in the format that we all came to know and love.

Mrs. Lynde doesn't know whether to approve of our enterprise or not. She inclines to, when she remembers that Mr. and Mrs. Allan are in favor of it; but the fact that village improvement societies first originated in the States is a count against it. So she is halting between two opinions and only success will justify us in Mrs. Lynde's eyes. Priscilla is going to write a paper for our next Improvement meeting, and I expect it will be good, for her aunt is such a clever writer and no doubt it runs in the family. I shall never forget the thrill it gave me <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> Mrs. Charlotte E. Morgan was Priscilla's aunt. It seemed so wonderful that I was a friend of the girl whose aunt wrote 'Edgewood Days' and 'The Rosebud Garden.'" ...|$|E
