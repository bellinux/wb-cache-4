2500|$|Just as Miller was {{disembarking}} from Cedar {{to return}} to King and Winge, at 16:50 on 25 October, Sophia sent out a wireless message: [...] "Ship Foundering on Reef. [...] Come at Once." [...] Ledbetter immediately prepared to steam out to the reef. [...] He signaled Miller on King and Winge to follow him with two blasts of the whistle, but Miller did not at first understand the signal. [...] Ledbetter then drove Cedar alongside King and Winge and shouted out to Miller: [...] "I am going out there to try to locate him. [...] If the snow should [...] clear up, you come out and relieve me." [...] Miller replied: [...] "I <b>will</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>an</b> hour to find them." ...|$|E

Rav Zeira taught {{that all the}} nations are uncircumcised {{in each of the}} first four ways, and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in heart, in that their hearts do not allow them to do God's will. And Rav Zeira taught that in the future, God will take away from Israel the uncircumcision of their hearts, and they will not harden their {{stubborn}} hearts anymore before their Creator, as [...] says, [...] "And I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I <b>will</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>an</b> heart of flesh," [...] and [...] says, [...] "And you shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{march of}} the athletes showed a clear example of CCTV proudly {{emphasizing}} a cultural particularity that NBC strained to contain {{within the bounds of}} the acceptable. When the athletes entered the stadium, CCTV [...] pointed out that the banners carrying the names of the countries were written by brush in Chinese and English, reflecting another Chinese cultural particularity. NBC described the arrangement not as an expression of Chinese cultural pride, but in pragmatic terms that covered a sense of dismissiveness. [...] As the athletes began marching into the stadium, Bob Costas explained why Guinea followed Greece: [...] "There is no alphabet here. So if you're expecting one nation to follow another, the way they generally do at an opening ceremony, think again." [...] Matt Lauer added [...] "You're out of luck. So we're going to have the graphics {{at the bottom of the}} screen which <b>will</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>an</b> idea, if you look to the right, which countries are approaching the tunnel." [...] In this way, the NBC commentators' coverage intoned that China was not doing things the way they were generally done, and as a viewer, you might be [...] "out of luck" [...] if not for the graphics that NBC provided.|$|E
