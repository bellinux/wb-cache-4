500|$|By 1980, [...] "Captain Jack" [...] had mostly {{disappeared}} from Joel's concert setlists. Nevertheless, he always played it in Philadelphia, {{because he never}} forgot the role the song and the city played in his early career. A version recorded at The Spectrum in July 1980 was used on his live album, Songs in the Attic. Joel wrote, [...] "'Captain Jack' plays with much more power and conviction when a roaring Philadelphia audience sets off a kind of internal explosion and the adrenaline screams through our veins ... <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>play</b> 'Captain Jack', we are actually committing an act of pure brutality." [...] Timothy White of Rolling Stone did not like this version, calling it [...] "grating".|$|E
500|$|... "Sweet Sacrifice" [...] {{was written}} by Amy Lee and Terry Balsamo while the {{production}} was handled by Dave Fortman. It was recorded in Record Plant Studios, Los Angeles, mixed by Dave Fortman at Ocean Way Studios, Los Angeles and mastered by Ted Jensen at Sterling Sound, New York. The programming was done by DJ Lethal. Talking about The Open Door, Lee said that lot of people expected the new songs on the album to be similar with [...] "My Immortal" [...] (2003) before adding that [...] "'Weight of the World', 'Sweet Sacrifice' and 'All That I'm Living For' are so amazing to me because of the adrenaline. Especially <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>play</b> them live." [...] She further revealed the inspiration behind the song, ...|$|E
500|$|Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson said in {{his press}} conference: [...] "The game will be {{competitive}}. Prestige comes into it, pride comes into it, so it is always competitive <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>play</b> Arsenal." [...] He {{wanted to use the}} game as a means of preparing his team for their UEFA Champions League third qualifying round game against Dinamo București the following Wednesday. Ferguson was concerned about the state of his squad, with several first team players injured. He was irked that senior players Cristiano Ronaldo and Gabriel Heinze were absent, on duty for their respective national teams at the Summer Olympics: [...] "Apparently, it's supposed to be for amateurs, and money earned is put in trust, but we will be paying their wages while they are away so I don't know what that's all about." ...|$|E

500|$|In April 1844, Verdi took on Emanuele Muzio, {{eight years}} his junior, as a pupil and amanuensis. He {{had known him}} since about 1828 as another of Barezzi's protégés. Muzio, who in fact was Verdi's only pupil, became {{indispensable}} to the composer. He reported to Barezzi that Verdi [...] "has a breadth of spirit, of generosity, a wisdom." [...] In November 1846, Muzio wrote of Verdi: [...] "If you could see us, I seem more like a friend, rather than his pupil. We are always together at dinner, in the cafes, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>play</b> cards...; all in all, he doesn't go anywhere without me at his side; in the house {{we have a big}} table and we both write there together, and so I always have his advice." [...] Muzio was to remain associated with Verdi, assisting in the preparation of scores and transcriptions, and later conducting many of his works in their premiere performances in the US and elsewhere outside Italy. He was chosen by Verdi as one of the executors of his will, but predeceased the composer in 1890.|$|E
500|$|According to Neil Finn, [...] "It (Time on Earth) doesn't {{sound like}} any one {{particular}} Crowded House album, {{but it has}} elements of Crowded House... {{in as much as}} Nick and I make a sound together <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>play</b> and always did. I think there's a lot of heart and spirit in the album which is connected with the loss of our dear friend Paul but also an attempt to try and make sense of it and move forward. And as such, it seemed the most obvious and {{best way to do that}} was to be playing music again with each other, Nick and I. I want to be in a band and what other band could it be." [...] Crowded House's leader, Neil Finn has indicated that, as the album began life as a solo project, its sound is generally different from Crowded House, though similar in parts, indicating that no one album by the group sounds like this one. As the album is dedicated to Hester and attends to his death, much of the album has a mournful tone, however this has been received well by critics, with some indicating that [...] "fortunately, Finn is a master at expressing ambiguity, (both) lyrically and musically". Finn has said of the song [...] "People Are Like Suns", that [...] "Part of it is the idea that people burn brightly and then they fade out. Also, when I wrote it, I was reading Ian McEwan's novel Saturday, which begins with a man on his balcony watching his plane go down, so the first lines borrow something from that image." ...|$|E
2500|$|Commenting on the {{upcoming}} tour, guitarist Brad Delson stated: [...] "Our fans {{know how much}} love we put into our live show. They know how much we enjoy the connection <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>play</b> a fan favorite on stage. The emotional and sonic content of this new batch of songs {{is going to bring}} a whole new dimension to the show." ...|$|E

25|$|But {{there was}} such a {{bittersweet}} feeling. Eddie had really changed. Paul was on his last legs. Watch the clip of us doing the song on Ed Sullivan we're not together. Eddie is off by himself. There was no more group. Sure enough, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>played</b> the Copa that week, Eddie left between shows. He didn't come back.|$|R
2500|$|Several unnamed Chelsea {{players were}} {{quoted as saying}} Grant's methods were [...] "25 years behind the times" [...] and [...] "Chelsea deserve a bigger coach than him. Grant {{does not have the}} quality to coach a team like this. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>play</b> big opponents we will suffer because of him." [...] At least one of Grant's staff told friends that they {{considered}} leaving the club.|$|E
2500|$|... "It's {{always a}} nice feeling. Sometimes {{you hear it}} on the streets or someone has it on their mobile phone or something… it's a nice feeling! Actually, I did an {{interview}} {{about a year ago}} with a newspaper from America and they talked about how much it's been used in sports in America… which I didn't know so much about. Apparently it has been used a lot and it was nice to hear. The ironic thing, though, is that the song was actually written for the fans. It was over six minutes long and was never meant to be a hit or anything like that. It was meant to be an opening for the 'live' show. We were putting out our third album and we wanted a really 'grand' opening for the show. So, I had that 'riff' tucked away in a drawer since my college years and I took it out, found a tempo for it, wrote lyrics, {{and it turned out to}} be a great opening for that album and for the show, as well. Nowadays, we don't rehearse it, but <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>play</b> it live, it is still just so amazing! It does communicate so well with the audience and we really love playing it." ...|$|E

On stage, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>played</b> these songs, they felt mysterious and magic. That's not for rent.|$|R
5000|$|... "In 1972 {{the band}} scored {{a huge hit}} with 'Seaside Shuffle,' which got to No. 2 in the UK charts {{under the guise of}} Terry Dactyl and the Dinosaurs. In those days it was weird. Anything with a {{commercial}} edge was frowned on, so we went under different names, apart from <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>played</b> the blues." ...|$|R
6000|$|At length, {{rising to}} her knees and looking up the green slope, she cried out: [...] "Oh, Johnnie, there's the old thorn tree!

6000|$|... "I'd {{like to see}} {{you take}} a kick like that. It was nearly on the touch-line. Still, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>play</b> you, we shan't need to convert any of our tries. We'll get our thirty points without that. Perhaps you'd like to scratch?" ...|$|E

500|$|Prior to its release, the Kinks {{performed}} [...] "You Really Got Me" [...] in some {{of their}} early concerts. It was a crowd favourite, with Ray Davies later claiming to feel a connection with the crowd as he performed the song.

60|$|I won the toss {{and after}} {{examining}} the wicket {{decided to take}} first knock. As a rule <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>play</b> the wit at first flows free, but on this occasion I strode to the crease in an almost eerie silence. David had taken off his blouse and rolled up his shirt-sleeves, and his teeth were set, so I knew he would begin by sending me down some fast ones.|$|E
60|$|And {{the house}} is always crowded <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>play.</b> Our fine speeches always fall on {{sympathetic}} ears, our brave deeds are noted and applauded. It is so different in the real performance. So often we play our parts to empty benches, or if a thin house be present, they misunderstand, and laugh at the pathetic passages. And when our finest opportunity comes, the royal box, in which HE or SHE should be present to watch us, is vacant.|$|E
5000|$|The {{song was}} the first time that former members of Cold Chisel had collaborated since the band's demise. Barnes said, [...] "When Ian Moss played guitar on it in the studio, it was all so Chisel-esque that it made the hairs stand up on the back of our necks <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>played</b> it back.

60|$|This for the un{{fortunate}}. But {{with the}} fortunate also, even those whom the inspector loves, {{it may not}} be altogether well. It is concluded that in such a state of society, supposing it to be financially sound, the level of comfort will be high. It does not follow: there are strange depths of idleness in man, a too-easily-got sufficiency, {{as in the case of}} the sago-eaters, often quenching the desire for all besides; and it is possible that the men of the richest ant-heaps may sink even into squalor. But suppose they do not; suppose our tricksy instrument of human nature, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>play</b> upon it this new tune, should respond kindly; suppose no one to be damped and none exasperated by the new conditions, the whole enterprise to be financially sound--a vaulting supposition--and all the inhabitants to dwell together in a golden mean of comfort: we have yet to ask ourselves if this be what man desire, or if it be what man will even deign to accept for a continuance. It is certain that man loves to eat, it is not certain that he loves that only or that best. He is supposed to love comfort; it is not a love, at least, that he is faithful to. He is supposed to love happiness; it is my contention that he rather loves excitement. Danger, enterprise, hope, the novel, the aleatory, are dearer to man than regular meals. He does not think so when he is hungry, but he thinks so again as soon as he is fed; and on the hypothesis of a successful ant-heap, he would never go hungry. It would be always after dinner in that society, as, in the land of the Lotos-eaters, it was always afternoon; and food, which, when we have it not, seems all-important, drops in our esteem, as soon as we have it, to a mere pre-requisite of living.|$|E
