50|$|<b>Window</b> <b>films</b> {{filter out}} over 99% of UV rays to 380 nm, {{reducing}} the main factor in fading. However, additional {{factors such as}} solar heat, visible light, humidity, and {{presence or absence of}} chemical vapors also contribute to fading. Therefore, the greatest protection from fading is offered by tinted or metallised <b>window</b> <b>films</b> that reject large levels of heat and visible light, in addition to UV.|$|E
50|$|With a low VLT, {{the primary}} benefit of factory tint {{is to provide}} privacy for {{passengers}} and personal items. Unlike <b>window</b> <b>film,</b> factory tint, depending on the car manufacturer and year, does not provide the same ultraviolet (UV) protection or heat reduction qualities. <b>Window</b> <b>film</b> offers 99% UV protection against both UVA and UVB rays. Factory tint provides protection against UVB rays because UVB rays cannot penetrate any kind of glass including non tinted glass.|$|R
50|$|Under certain conditions, <b>window</b> <b>film</b> will exhibit iridescence. This {{phenomenon}} usually {{occurs at}} night, when {{the source of}} illumination within a building is fluorescent lighting. The amount of iridescence may vary from almost imperceptible to very visible. It most frequently occurs when the film is constructed with scratch resistance protection. When iridescence does occur in <b>window</b> <b>film,</b> {{the best way to}} stop it is to prevent the fluorescent light from illuminating the film or to use an alternative type of light.|$|R

50|$|Heating {{and cooling}} systems have energy costs, and <b>window</b> <b>films</b> {{can be used}} to {{increase}} building insulation.Modern windows with low-solar-gain glass do not need retrofit films, but since most of the existing windows do not have a low solar heat gain, <b>window</b> <b>films</b> {{make a lot of sense}} as a retrofit energy improvement. They can provide thermal comfort and are one of the most cost-competitive and environmentally-friendly energy improvements, especially in hot and mixed climates.|$|E
5000|$|Heat {{rejection}} {{films are}} normally {{applied to the}} interior of flat glass windows {{to reduce the amount}} of infrared, visible light, and ultraviolet (UV) radiation entering windows. Such films are usually dyed or metalized (which can be transparent to visible light) to convert incoming solar radiation to infrared radiation, which is then rejected back through the glass to the exterior. Modern window film technology has created ceramic <b>window</b> <b>films</b> which are non-metallic and do not contain dyes that can result in discoloration. The ceramic and metallic <b>window</b> <b>films</b> usually cost 10-15 percent more than regular window film but can reduce energy transmission by as much as 80 percent. [...] Ceramic <b>window</b> <b>films</b> cost slightly more but provide a substantial increase in blocking UV rays and ability to control heat transfer.|$|E

5000|$|Daylight Redirecting <b>Window</b> <b>Film</b> (DRF) {{applied to}} windows is {{relatively}} new alternative to Light shelves. DRF {{is applied to the}} upper section of a window (clerestory or daylighting position). The principle method of light redirection is by Total Internal Reflection (TIR) of light transmitted through the microscopic elements of the film. When sunlight or skylight penetrates the film, internal microscopic [...] "louvers" [...] redirect the incoming light upward to the ceiling, where the typical ceiling redistributes the diffuse daylight deeper into the space. As <b>window</b> <b>film</b> does not alter the architectural nature of the building, Daylight Redirecting Film is an elegant and easy upgrade.|$|R
40|$|This {{article is}} about the {{developing}} parameters and relationships for selecting a proper glass <b>window</b> applied with <b>film</b> as building envelopes for buildings located in a hot climate based on its thermal performances. Thermal comfort of the occupants sitting near the glass window is the thermal performance {{that needed to be}} considered besides the heat transmission in selecting a proper type of glass to use as a glass window for the building. The predicted percentage of dissatisfied (PPD) is chosen as a thermal comfort index. 45 types of film and 1280 glass <b>windows</b> with <b>film</b> are investigated in this study. It can be shown that the thermal comfort index is dependent on the optical properties (total transmittance and total absorptance) and the overall heat transfer coefficient of glass <b>windows</b> with <b>film.</b> Glass <b>window</b> with <b>film</b> which has high transmittance shall have more discomfort due to solar radiation effect. Glass <b>window</b> with <b>film</b> which has high absorptance shall have more discomfort due to surface temperature effect. The discomfort from the surface temperature effect for double pane glass <b>window</b> with <b>film</b> is also dependent on the glass thickness other than the absorptance and the change in overall heat transfer coefficient. Expressions for predicting the performance of the glass <b>windows</b> with <b>film</b> in terms of thermal comfort are developed...|$|R

The making and development process of the Sales Information System is using waterfall method.   Waterfall method consists of user requirement, analysis, design, implementation, and testing. Entity Relationship Diagram, Data Flow Diagram and Flowchart are also used in the Information System design. The output of this application design is a desktop application that can help user to control the set-up of <b>window</b> <b>film,</b> manage payment bill, and manage document in accounting in faster and more accurate way. The information system can be developed later using web-based system so that the development and maintenance can be done easier...|$|R

50|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, the most {{successful}} ceramics tint in the market was made using Titanium Nitride(TiN). During the same period, Japanese <b>window</b> <b>films</b> manufacturers figured that Antimony Tin Oxide(ATO) could be added to <b>window</b> <b>films</b> to achieve higher visible light transmission(VLT) at lower cost, as compared to TiN, given the same heat reduction. However, the early ATO films production technology was relatively unstable {{and it was only}} until 1999, that production breakthrough was truly achieved for ATO films. During the early 2000s, most of the Japanese Antimony Tin Oxide films were procured by FilmTack's associated companies in Singapore.|$|E

50|$|In {{order to}} assist in keeping the glass {{attached}} to the security window film, and the frames, Shatter Safe Security <b>Window</b> <b>Films</b> recommend that the glass must {{be attached to the}} window frame (not the gasket) so that the edge of the film becomes {{an integral part of the}} glass and the frame. There are two common methods of accomplishing this. One is wet glaze utilizing a Building Compound adhesive more commonly known as Dow Corning 995.
