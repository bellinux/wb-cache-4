5|$|When casting for {{the role}} of Dorothy, Warner Bros. {{declined}} to audition any actresses younger than the age of 30; Jennifer O'Neill's agent, who had developed a fondness for the script, convinced the studio to audition his client, who was only 22 at the time. O'Neill auditioned {{for the role}}, albeit hesitantly, not wanting to perform any nude scenes. O'Neill got the role and Mulligan agreed to find a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> film work without blatant nudity.|$|E
5|$|The {{approach}} to Battle Mountain and P'il-bong {{was much more}} difficult from the east, the American-held side, than from the west, the North Korean side. On the east side there was no road climbing halfway to the top; {{from the base of}} the mountain at the edge of the Haman valley the only <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> ascent was by foot trail. Climbers took two to three hours to reach the top of P'il-bong from the reservoir area, and required from three to four hours to get on top of Battle Mountain from the valley floor. The turnaround time for supply trains to Battle Mountain was six hours. Often a dispatch runner required eight hours to go up Battle Mountain and come back down. In some places the trail was so steep that climbers had to set up ropes to hold along the side of the trail. North Korean night patrols constantly cut telephone lines. The wire men had a difficult and dangerous job trying to maintain wire communication with units on the mountain. Food, water and ammunition were frequently short for the units at the tops of the peaks.|$|E
25|$|In turn, 20th Century Fox {{handed the}} project to William Dozier and his {{production}} company, Greenway Productions. ABC and Fox were expecting a hip and fun—yet still serious—adventure show. However, Dozier, who had never before read comic books, concluded, after reading several Batman comics for research, that the only <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> show work was {{to do it as}} a pop-art campy comedy. Originally, espionage novelist Eric Ambler was to have scripted a TV movie that would launch the television series, but he dropped out after learning of Dozier's campy comedy approach. Eventually, two sets of screen tests were filmed, one with Adam West and Burt Ward and the other with Lyle Waggoner and Peter Deyell, with West and Ward winning the roles.|$|E

She stated that she believed the education system in the United States needs to be improved, {{as there is a}} link between the quality of education and the crime rate. She also believed that too much money has been diverted away from the juvenile court system and that the government should find some <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> juvenile courts work effectively, so as to prevent problems in troubled children and adolescents before these problems are exacerbated by the time they reach adulthood.|$|E
25|$|In February 2009, the Griffiss Local Development Corporation (GLDC) {{hired an}} {{engineering}} firm {{to complete the}} design work needed to begin work on widening the final two-lane section of NY825 to four lanes. The company hoped that completing the project's design would make the project eligible for federal stimulus funding. The New York State Department of Transportation (NYS DOT) had completed 40% of the necessary design work; however, it lacked the funds needed to complete the plans and build the highway. As a result, GLDC saw hiring an outside firm to finish the project layout and receive federal stimulus funding as the most feasible <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> project a reality. The remaining design work was estimated to cost between $400,000 and $500,000 while the actual construction cost was set at approximately $7million.|$|E
25|$|As Swigert and Haise {{watch the}} Moon pass beneath them, Lovell laments his lost chance of walking on its surface, then turns their {{attention}} to the business of getting home. With Aquarius running on minimal electrical power, the crew suffers freezing conditions, and Haise contracts a urinary infection and a fever. Swigert suspects Mission Control is withholding their inability to get them home; Haise angrily blames Swigert's inexperience for the accident; and Lovell quickly squelches the argument. When carbon dioxide approaches dangerous levels, ground control must quickly invent a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> Command Module's square filters work in the Lunar Module's round receptacles. With the guidance systems on Aquarius shut down, the crew must make a difficult but vital course correction by manually igniting the Lunar Module's engine.|$|E

25|$|Maps of {{the area}} {{indicate}} Mission Hill development began before the Fenway and Longwood Medical Area. Huntington Avenue, {{now one of the}} main connections to the rest of Boston, once stopped at the intersection of Parker Street, near the present-day site of the Museum of Fine Arts. Up until that time, Mission Hill was connected via Parker Street (a man-made raised passage between the Stony Brook and the Muddy River - both which formed a tidal flat into the Charles River) all the way to Boylston Street in the Back Bay. Part of what was once Parker Street is now called Hemenway Street. The once main intersection of Parker Street and Huntington Avenue has been traffic-engineered, cutting the straight-line road in two and forcing traffic to first turn onto Forsyth <b>Way</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> connection. Many other streets leading into Mission Hill were also realigned and/or renamed at Huntington Avenue (including Longwood Avenue/McGreevey Way, Smith/Shattuck Street, Vancouver Street, and Palace Road/Worthington Street), limiting both pedestrian and vehicular access.|$|E
25|$|The small air {{arm of the}} Argentine Navy (Armada Republica Argentina; ARA) was in {{the middle}} of the {{transition}} from the A-4Q Skyhawk to the new Super Etendard. Only five of the Etendard's anti-ship Exocet missiles had been delivered at the time of the conflict, at which point an arms embargo prevented the delivery of further shipments. Additionally, the required programming for the missiles to interact with the Etendard's computers had not been completed by French engineers when the conflict broke out. France, being an ally of the United Kingdom, recalled all technicians, which left Argentine scientists and electronic engineers to figure out a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> missiles take input from the plane's computers. Navy pilots, particularly those of the 3rd Naval Fighters Squadron flying A-4Qs were the only ones trained in bombing warships. Air Force pilots trained during April against the two Argentine Type 42 destroyers, similar to those of the British Fleet, and according to the Naval officers all the sorties were shot down, causing great concern to the High Command until the successful May 1 strikes which proved that aircraft could survive.|$|E

This entailed the use of non-standard methods and technologies; for Shearsmith, the <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> episode successful as a recreation [...] "was to use as much equipment as possible from the period". The whole filming process took only two days, with the cast taking minimal breaks between shoots.

[...] Molenda intercepted a pass thrown by Grange on the opening drive of the game and made a second interception of a pass thrown by Earl Britton later in the first quarter.

500|$|Development of Spyro: Year of the Dragon spanned {{about ten}} {{and a half}} months, from November 1999 to September 2000; the {{development}} team was influenced {{by a host of}} other games, including Doom and Crash Bandicoot. Among the new features touted before the game's release was [...] "Auto Challenge Tuning", which Insomniac CEO Ted Price described as [...] "invented to even out the gameplay difficulty curve for players of different abilities". The levels were made much larger than those in Spyro 2, so that more areas for minigames could be added; to prevent player confusion on where to go next, these areas were designed to load separately from the main hubs. Price stated that the addition of critters was a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> game more enjoyable and varied, instead of just adding more moves for Spyro. The game was named [...] "Year of the Dragon" [...] simply because it was released during 2000, the year of the Dragon in the Chinese zodiac.|$|E
500|$|In March 2009, Lions Gate Entertainment {{entered into}} a co-production {{agreement}} for The Hunger Games with Nina Jacobson's production company Color Force, which had acquired worldwide distribution rights to the novel a few weeks earlier. The studio, which had not made a profit for five years, raided the budgets of other productions and sold assets to secure a budget of $88,000,000 – one of its largest ever – for the film. Collins' agent Jason Dravis remarked that [...] "they [...] had everyone but the valet call us" [...] to help secure the franchise. Intending the film to have a PG-13 rating, Collins adapted the novel for film herself, in collaboration with screenwriter Billy Ray and director Gary Ross. The screenplay remains extremely faithful to the original novel, with Ross saying he [...] "felt the only <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> film really successful was to be totally subjective" [...] in its presentation of events, echoing Collins' use of first person present in the novel.|$|E

500|$|Lawrence {{saw that}} such a {{particle}} accelerator would soon become too long and unwieldy for his university laboratory. In pondering a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> accelerator more compact, Lawrence decided to set a circular accelerating chamber between the poles of an electromagnet. [...] The magnetic field would hold the charged protons in a spiral path as they were accelerated between just two semicircular electrodes connected to an alternating potential. [...] After a hundred turns or so, the protons would impact the target as a beam of high-energy particles. [...] Lawrence excitedly told his colleagues that he had discovered a method for obtaining particles of very high energy {{without the use of}} any high voltage. He initially worked with Niels Edlefsen. Their first cyclotron was made out of brass, wire, and sealing wax and was only four inches (10cm) in diameter—it could literally be held in one hand, and probably cost $25 in all.|$|E

However, Disney {{struggled}} with creating a believable, multi-dimensional adaption of the fairy tale's title character, who was intended to be a villain. In the story, she is described as [...] "a woman, dressed in garments of white gauze, which looked like millions of starry snow-flakes linked together.
