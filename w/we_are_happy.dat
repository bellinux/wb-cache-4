2500|$|With the {{agreement}} signed on between on March 9 Afghanistan and the United States began a six-month transition from American to Afghan {{control of the}} Parwan Detention Facility north of Kabul and just outside Bagram, the largest US military base in the country. The US military handed control of the prison housing more than 3,000 Taliban fighters and terrorism suspects to the Afghan authorities in small ceremony on September 10, 2012, at which 16 prisoners, all wearing matching gray sweaters, were released. Army Col. Robert M. Taradash, who has overseen the prison, represented coalition forces. [...] "We transferred more than 3,000 Afghan detainees into your custody... and ensured that those who would threaten the partnership of Afghanistan and coalition forces will {{not return to the}} battlefield," [...] said Col Robert Taradash, the only US official at the ceremony. [...] "Our Afghan security forces are well trained and <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>happy</b> that today they are exercising their capability in taking the responsibility of prisoners independently and guarding the prisoners," [...] said acting Defence Minister Enayatullah Nazari. [...] "We are taking the responsibility from foreign forces." [...] "Now, the Bagram prison is converted to one of Afghanistan's regular prisons where the innocents will be freed {{and the rest of the}} prisoners will be sentenced according to the laws of Afghanistan," [...] a statement by Afghan President Hamid Karzai said, who didn't attend the ceremony. No one from the American Embassy or the State Department was present. Also top American commanders were absent on the ceremony. American officials say the transfer agreement calls for the Afghan government to continue to hold some detainees even if there is not a formal legal case against them, reviewing their cases administratively rather than judicially. The Americans say it is impossible to build legal cases against all prisoners arrested in battlefield conditions. Afghan news media reported that a dispute over this practice led to a falling-out between Karzai and General John R. Allen, the American military commander in Afghanistan, over the weekend and apparently prompted the downgraded American presence at the ceremony.|$|E
