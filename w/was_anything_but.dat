Jolliffe replied by giving a radio speech (written {{with the assistance of}} Lister Sinclair) that accused Drew of running a political Gestapo in Ontario. In the speech excerpt below, Jolliffe alleged that a secret department of the Ontario Provincial Police was acting as a political police – spying on the opposition and the media.|$|E
5|$|As {{the period}} of Sovietization and Stalinism began, the PZPR <b>was</b> <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> united. The most {{important}} split among the communists occurred before the union with PPS, when the Stalinists forced Gomułka out of the PPR's top office and suppressed his native communist faction. The PZPR had become divided into several factions, which espoused different views and methods and sought different degrees of the Polish state's distinction and independence from the Soviet Union. While the official ideology, the Russian version of Marxism, was new to Poland, the communist regime continued, in many psychologically and practically important ways, the precepts, methods and manners of past Polish ruling circles, {{including those of the}} Sanation, the National Democracy, and the 19th century traditions of cooperation with the partitioning powers.|$|E
5|$|For testing purposes, a {{new engine}} {{consisting}} of six Armstrong Siddeley Viper jet engines blowing across the outer rim of an impeller was designed {{under the name}} PV-704, PV stood for Private Venture. The PV-704 was a stop-gap design built into a bunker-like building behind the Avro Experimental Test facility. It was intended to test various Project 1794 concepts and provide the USAF with test data to show {{the viability of the}} concept. The original plan to initially test the Viper Engine Rig was to have continued into free flight testing. Unfortunately, testing <b>was</b> <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> smooth; the test model suffered from hazardous oil leaks, resulting in three fires. It eventually got to the point that staff were afraid of the machine, even when safely ensconced in a booth constructed of bullet-proof glass and quarter-inch-thick steel. A final, disastrous and nearly lethal engine test in 1956 which involved a Viper jet engine running wild, convinced Frost that a less dangerous test vehicle was necessary.|$|E

5|$|While {{he tried}} to {{consolidate}} his rule over Mosul, Hasan showed himself conspicuously loyal to the Abbasid regime, and refused to support the revolt of Mu'nis al-Khadim against the Caliph al-Muqtadir in 932. Mu'nis succeeded in overthrowing and killing al-Muqtadir, {{but over the next}} few years the Abbasid government all but collapsed, until in 936 the powerful governor of Wasit, Muhammad ibn Ra'iq, assumed the title of amir al-umara ("commander of commanders") and with it de facto control of the Abbasid government. The Caliph al-Radi was reduced to a figurehead role, while the extensive civil bureaucracy was cut down dramatically both in size and power. Ibn Ra'iq's position <b>was</b> <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> secure, however, and soon a convoluted struggle for control of his office, and the Caliphate with it, broke out among the various local rulers and the Turkish and Daylamite military chiefs, which ended in 946 with the ultimate victory of the Buyids.|$|E
25|$|In his {{personal}} life, Milan <b>was</b> <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> a faithful husband, {{having an affair}} with most notably Clara Frewen (sister in law of Lord Randolph Churchill and aunt to Winston Churchill) among others, while Queen Natalija was greatly influenced by Russian sympathies. In 1886, the couple, mismatched both personally and politically, separated after eleven years of marriage.|$|E

25|$|The defense {{tried to}} {{convince}} the jury that Simpson was not physically capable of carrying out the murders, saying that Goldman was a fit young man who put up a fierce struggle against his assailant. Simpson was a 46-year-old former professional football player with chronic arthritis. He had scars on his knees from old football injuries. But Clark produced into evidence an exercise video that Simpson made {{a few months before}} the murders titled O.J. Simpson Minimum Maintenance: Fitness For Men, which showed that, despite some physical conditions and limitations, Simpson <b>was</b> <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> frail.|$|E
25|$|Much of the {{knowledge}} about the daily activities of the convent comes from seven volumes of diaries that were meticulously kept by convent scribes. These diaries cover {{over a hundred years}} of convent history, from 1851 to 1971; they are handwritten in French and entitled Annales de Singapour. From their observations, it is known that life within the convent walls <b>was</b> <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> sedate. Apart from daily chores, the nuns also had to organise and attend mass, grade papers, maintain the buildings and the grounds as well as raise money to support their activities.|$|E
25|$|Early {{reports of}} torpedo action {{included}} some dud hits, heard as a dull clang. In a few instances, Mark14s would strike a Japanese ship and lodge in its hull without exploding. The contact pistol {{appeared to be}} malfunctioning, though the conclusion <b>was</b> <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> clear until running depth and magnetic exploder problems were solved. The experience of Dan Daspit (in Tinosa) was {{exactly the sort of}} live-fire trial BuOrd had been prevented from doing in peacetime. It was now clear to all at Pearl Harbor the contact pistol was also defective. Ironically, a direct hit on the target at a 90 degree angle, as recommended in training, would usually fail to detonate; the contact pistol functioned reliably only when the torpedo impacted the target at an oblique angle.|$|E

25|$|When Charles Gustav, De la Gardie's brother-in-law, {{ascended to}} the throne, {{it meant a}} return to the public for De la Gardie. In August 1654, he became {{governor}} of Västergötland, Dalsland and Halland and in December that year he was made chancellor of Uppsala University. In 1655, he was for the second time chosen for the office of General-Governor of Livonia. He also became Lieutenant General of the Swedish troops in Ingria, Estonia and Livonia, which meant that he commanded troops in the wars against Poland and Russia. It appears that De la Gardie <b>was</b> <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> a splendid military commander, as he received much more complaints than praise from the king for his actions in that area. During negotiations with Poland, De la Gardie was the prime Swedish representative. He took part in the deliberations leading to the Swedish-Polish Treaty of Oliva in 1660.|$|E
25|$|The 17th century, {{called the}} 'Great Century' by the French, <b>was</b> <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> {{great for the}} {{inhabitants}} of the Southern Netherlands. During this period, this region went through a succession of wars and destruction, exacerbated by large armies traversing the region at the whim of the great powers. In 1695, nearly forty years after the Battle of the Dunes of 1658, France began its policy of territorial expansion. This expansion resulted in the gradual annexation of Spanish possessions to France's north. Wars were fought and alliances made and broken, and fortresses continuously changed hands. The Nine Years' War had been raging since 1688. Opposing France was a large European coalition, the Grand Alliance, with its head as William III of Orange, leader of the Netherlands, and soon to be king of England. Alongside William stood Spain, Sweden, the Holy Roman Empire as well several electors, among them Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria, governor of the Spanish Netherlands.|$|E
25|$|On 16 April 1979, BBC2 {{adopted the}} world's first computer-generated ident, with the logo being drawn live {{every time it}} was played. This version of the 2 had orange double lines either side and the 2 itself was cream double lined. This stripy 2 had been used on {{promotions}} and holding slides for years prior to its launch, {{and now it was}} part of a bigger branding package. For the first few years of the ident, it would be accompanied by a fanfare as it scrolled onto the screen. There were versions of the ident where the ident scrolled on, scrolled off and remained static. The clock used alongside this high tec 3D ident, <b>was</b> <b>anything</b> <b>but.</b> The old clock filmed from the NODD room survived, with a new 2D logo and sporting black and orange colours. However, in 1980, BBC2 got its own electronic clock including 3D legend and centre dot.|$|E

25|$|The {{answer to}} the appellant's action lay in the navy's offer of an {{alternative}} post to the appellant immediately prior to his resignation. Given {{the background of the}} appellant's case, the Navy could not be faulted for not returning the appellant to his original post. In the particular circumstances, however, the law clearly placed a duty on the employer to consult fully with the employee affected and to share information to enable him to make informed decisions. The navy, noted Cameron, had not fulfilled that responsibility: Explaining the job offer <b>was</b> <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> superfluous, since it was an entirely new position, and in addition the appellant's subjective condition of suspicion, demoralisation and depression, which was evident to those dealing with him, was materially relevant to how the navy was required by fairness to deal with him. His condition meant that an unexplained offer of a new post was likely to be rejected. The lack of explanation, follow-up and elucidation did not constitute fair dealing. The navy had breached its common-law duty to treat Murray fairly, thus rendering his resignation a constructive dismissal.|$|E
25|$|For {{the first}} eleven seasons of their {{existence}} in the NBA, the Suns had no official mascot, but some years later this mascot was born by accident. A messenger for Eastern Onion, a singing telegram service, came to the Coliseum during a home game dressed as a gorilla. As he left, Coliseum security suggested he do a few dances underneath the basket during a timeout and the fans loved it. So did the messenger, who kept coming to games until he was officially invited {{to be part of}} the team. And this is how this mascot was accidentally born. The messenger, a quiet young man named Henry Rojas, <b>was</b> <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> quiet in his costume. An early attempt was made involving a sunflower costume, but it never caught on. Given a Suns warm-up jacket, Rojas shed his shyness, and turned into an entertainment beast, dancing, joking with fans and, in general, enjoying himself to the fullest. Nowadays, the Suns Gorilla is one of the most famous mascots in the NBA.|$|E
25|$|Since its birth, pop-folk {{scene is}} {{dominated}} by female singers - atrractive women, famous for their high-heeled, big-breasted, short-skirted appearances. However, Aca Lukas has slowly but successfully created his path {{to the image of}} the biggest Serbian male music star. Despite drugs addiction, gambling problems and many criminal involvements, such as weapon possession, he has made more than ten concerts in Belgrade, all of them visited by 15 to 25 thousands of people. His most popular songs are Lična karta, Dođi gore, Daleko si, Miris tamjana, Ne pitaj me, Šta učini crni gavrane, Zapišite mi broj, Kuda idu ljudi kao ja... On the other hand, the path of Seka Aleksić <b>was</b> <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> slow. Despite the failure of her debut album Idealno tvoja (2002) she has recorded another one, fully embracing Turkish melos. Soon enough she had song Crno i zlatno, the hit of the year, fighting then popular songs of Indira Radić. In the years to come, her success followed with albums Dođi i uzmi me (Iskoristi moje mane, Za ljubav mobilna, Baš mi se sviđa tvoja devojka, Svi tvoji milioni...), Kraljica - best-selling album of Serbia in 2007. (Kraljica, Aspirin, Boli stara ljubav, Poslednji let, Impulsi...) and Slučajni partneri (Rođena s vukovima, Ja nisam nešto slatko, Nije za mene, Ja tuđe usne ljubim...) and singles Soba 22, Mamurna, Chivas... She is often called The Princess of Pop-folk.|$|E
