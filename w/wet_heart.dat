As all living organisms exist to praise God, human destruction of other living things prevents the earth's natural and subtle means of praising God. The Qur'an acknowledges that humans {{are not the only}} all-important creatures and emphasizes a respect for nature.

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} to investigate the combined effects of hypertension and streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus in the rat. Accordingly, four groups of rats were studied: Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY), diabetic WKY, spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and diabetic SHR, respectively. The mean arterial blood pressure was increased in hypertensive animals compared to normotensive animals. The base excess in the diabetic rats was {{higher than that of}} normoglycemic animals. An elevated glucose concentration was found in the blood and urine of streptozotocin-treated rats. Ketone bodies were detected in the urine and blood of the diabetic rats. Mortality rates after treatment were not different among the four groups. In separate experiments, isolated working hearts of the various groups were set up and analyzed. For the maximal left ventricular pressure (mm Hg) the following values were formed: 110. 0 +/- 2. 6, 93. 6 +/- 2. 7, 93. 4 +/- 3. 0, and 87. 5 +/- 2. 4, respectively. The <b>wet</b> <b>heart</b> weights, dry heart weights, and body weights of the diabetic rats were lower than those of normoglycemic animals. The <b>wet</b> <b>heart</b> weight/body weight ratio, however, was increased by diabetes and hypertension (0. 43 +/- 0. 01, 0. 47 +/- 0. 01, 0. 47 +/- 0. 01, and 0. 54 +/- 0. 02, respectively). There {{were no significant differences between}} the water content of the hearts from the four different groups.

40|$|We {{present the}} structure, {{properties}} {{and use of}} European silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) wood, which {{is known for its}} uncoloured heartwood, medium density,relatively good mechanical properties {{and the fact that it}} can be used for a great variety of products. The value and usefulness of fir wood are reduced due to low resistance against decay and deterioration, and frequent occurrence of <b>wet</b> <b>heart,</b> and ring shakes. The properties of fir wood are comparable to those of Norway spruce (Picea abies Karst.). Fir is favoured where resin is not desired, where durability against acids and bases is important, and for water constructions. We present some examples of wooden constructions in archaeological or historical objects in Slovenia. The dendrochronologically dated wood was up to 500 years old. In the past centuries, fir was used more frequently than Norway spruce. On the cellular level, the wood of fir consists of tracheids and parenchyma cells. In Slovenia, several studies of wood formation have been conducted e in recent years, which are important for a better understanding of the physiology of trees and quality of wood as material. Secondary phloem, which is particularly important for the survival of trees, has been studied as well. We review some main results of such studies...|$|E
40|$|Background. Recently, a {{successful}} result with a rapid two-stage arterial switch operation (ASO) was reported {{for patients with}} transposition of the great arteries (TGA) with low left ventricular pressure. In this procedure, the interval between pulmonary arterial banding and ASO was approximately 1 week. This successful result indicates {{the possibility of a}} nonsurgical ventricular preparation procedure using an obstructing balloon catheter prior to ASO. Methods and Results. A SF atrioseptostomy catheter was inserted directly into the main pulmonary artery in six lambs aged 20 to 38 days. After the chest was closed, the balloon was inflated twice a day for a period of 2 to 2. 5 hours. This procedure was performed for 4 consecutive days. After the final inflation, the ratio of right ventricular weight to total ventricular weight was compared with that in an age-matched control group. After the final inflation, the peak systolic right ventricular pressure and the percentage of peak systolic right ventricular to peak systolic aortic pressure rose to 85. 6 ± 4. 7 mm Hg (mean± 1 SD) and 79. 6 ± 8. 6 %, respectively. The percentages of the right ventricular weight to the total ventricular weight were significantly higher after the balloon inflation than those in the control group in terms of <b>wet</b> <b>heart</b> weight (29. 5 ± 1. 2 % versus 23. 0 ± 1. 0 %o; P<. 0001) and dry heart weight (27. 0 ± 2. 0 % versus 21. 0 ± 1. 1 %; P<. 0001).

40|$|Objective: The {{incidence}} of childhood obesity in North America {{and around the}} world has risen significantly over the past decade leaving clinicians constantly searching for effective weight loss strategies. Despite the growing popularity or carbohydrate restricted diets, consequences of long term use remain widely unknown. The objective of the current investigation is to evaluate the effects of LCHF diets on heart size and cardiac glycogen content in young mice. Methods: Young mice (age 21 d, n = 24) and mature mice (age 84 d, n = 18) were placed on either a LCHF diet, a WD diet or a control diet for 12 weeks. Activity levels, body weight, and glucose values were measured during the investigation. At the competition of the dietary intervention, <b>wet</b> <b>heart</b> weights were measured to compute the heart weight-to-tibia length ratio, cross sectional area was calculated and sections of cardiac tissue were stained with periodic acid and Schiff reagent to visualize glycogen. Results: No differences in activity levels or glucose measures were noted between groups. Mice following the LCHF diet displayed a smaller heart weight-to-tibia length ratio when compared to controls. The trend was observed in both young (p = 0. 012) and mature (p = 0. 024) mice. No differences in cross sectional area were detected. Cardiac tissue from mice consuming the LCHF diet had a reduced percentage of total area stained positive for glycogen when compared to mice following the WD diet (p = 0. 016). Conclusions: A LCHF diet can lead {{to the development of a}} smaller heart in young and mature mice. Alterations in intercellular cardiac glycogen content may contribute to differences observed in heart weight. Cardiac restricted diets should be recommended with caution as long term cardiac developmental impairments are unknown...|$|E

40|$|We {{developed}} a technique for in vitro determination of arteriolar densities. Hearts, obtained from anesthetized rats and perfused by the Langendorff method, were fully dilated with adenosine and were arrested with an elevated potassium concentration. After a stabilization period, the hearts were perfused with a buffered fixative for some minutes {{to obtain a}} nonvital vasculature. After fixation, perfusion was switched back to control for some minutes. The hearts were then perfused with a medium containing a low concentration of microspheres: either pollen grains [Urtica dioica (15. 4 microns), Betula (23. 5 microns), or Phleum pratense (36. 5 microns) ] or polystyrene microspheres (15 microns). The perfusion was switched back to the standard medium after flow {{had been reduced to}} between 83 and 57 % of control flow. Microscopic observations of microsections revealed that the percentages of arterioles embolized by one microsphere were 64 % for the 15. 4 -microns, 74 % for the 15 -microns, 78 % for the 23. 5 -microns, and 72 % for the 36. 5 -microns microspheres. The percentages of arterioles embolized with two microspheres were 20, 15, 15, and 16 %, respectively. The arteriolar densities were calculated from the total fractional reduction in coronary flow, the amount of microspheres injected, the <b>wet</b> <b>heart</b> weight, and the degree of occupancy, which corrects for the multiple embolization of the arterioles. The arteriolar densities in the rat hearts were 162. 4 +/- 54. 9 mg- 1 (N = 6) for polystyrene microspheres of 15 microns, 161. 5 +/- 81. 1 mg- 1 (N = 15) for 15. 4 -microns microspheres, 31. 6 +/- 7. 8 mg- 1 (N = 9) for 23. 5 -microns microspheres, and 13. 0 +/- 2. 4 mg- 1 (N = 8) for 36. 5 -microns microsphere...|$|E
40|$|Investigations {{into the}} {{mechanism}} of severe, subacute ethanol induced cardiomyopathy in the rat were performed in animals that were severely intoxicated for 48 hours. This treatment produced increases in cardiac wet weight, dry weight and protein content. Determination of cardiac DNA content and water content showed {{that the increase in}} heart size resulted from hypertrophy and not hyperplasia nor edema.;In a time effect study of intracellular events it was found that cardiac ornithine decarboxylase activity was enhanced after eight hours of intoxication and remained elevated through 24 hours. RNA content was elevated by eight hours and remained high through the 48 hour intoxication period. These changes were followed by increases in cardiac protein (16 hours) and this measure continued to increase through the remainder of the period of intoxication. <b>Wet</b> <b>heart</b> weights were significantly elevated by 24 hours and continued to increase through 48 hours. Enhanced activition of ornithine decarboxylase was shown to be a major contributor to the initiation of the hypertrophic response as the selective inhibitor of this enzyme, difluoromethylornithine, abolished the increases in all measured cardiac parameters.;The role of activation of cardiac dollarβdollar-adrenoceptors {{in the development of the}} hypertrophy was assessed through the use of a number of antagonists. Treatments which incorporated antagonism of both dollarβdollar-adrenoceptor subtypes found in the heart suppressed the increases in cardiac parameters, whereas treatments with specific antagonists of dollarβ 1 dollar- or dollarβ 2 dollar-adrenoceptor subtypes, given alone, were ineffective. Additionally, cardiac membrane stabilization, a property often possessed by dollarβdollar-adrenoceptor antagonists, was unable to abolish the increases in measured parameters.;Severe, subacute, ethanol intoxication produced a number of lesions of the myocardium. These included focal necrosis, thrombi with necrosis, infiltration of inflammatory cells, mitochondrial degeneration, contracture and dehiscence of the intercalated discs. Determination of creatine kinase showed no significant level of myocyte rupture. Treatment with D,L-propranolol, in doses which suppressed the development of the cardiac hypertrophy, did not alter the development of myocardial lesions, suggesting a dissociation between the two phenomena...|$|E

Whether these training‐induced adaptations persist following detraining is undetermined. Twelve male Wistar rats (~ 230 g) were exercised at 80 – 85 % of their VO 2 max for 30 min day− 1, 4 days week− 1 for 4 weeks (TR; n = 6), followed by 4 weeks of detraining (DTR; n = 6). Twelve untrained rats acted as controls (CTRL). Exercise training significantly enhanced VO 2 max (11. 34 mL kg− 1 min− 1) and <b>wet</b> <b>heart</b> weight (29 %) above CTRL (P < 0. 05). Echocardiography revealed that exercise training increased LV mass (~ 32 %), posterior and septal wall thickness (~ 15 %), ejection fraction and fractional shortening (~ 10 %) compared to CTRL (P < 0. 05).

Detraining removed the stimulus for c‐kitpos eCSC activation (640 ± 98 per 106 cardiomyocytes) and resultant cardiomyocyte hyperplasia (0. 4 ± 0. 3 % BrdUpos/ 0. 2 ± 0. 2 % Ki 67 pos cardiomyocytes).

In the absence of exogenous lactate, hearts release lactate into the perfusate. At lactate concentrations of 0. 2 mM and greater, the heart takes up lactate. The best fit for lactate uptake plotted against exogenous lactate concentration is a rectangular hyperbola with a maximal rate of 220 mumol/ 2 h per <b>heart</b> (<b>wet</b> wt. about 1 g). Uptake is half-maximal at about 1. 3 mM-lactate. The stimulation of protein synthesis also exhibits a rectangular-hyperbolic dependence on exogenous lactate concentration, with maximal stimulation being about 38 %.

We stimulated endogenous lactate production by perfusion with 2 -cyanocinnamate (an inhibitor of mitochondrial pyruvate transport) at concentrations up to 70 microM. Cardiac outputs, intracellular pH and the concentrations of phosphocreatine and the adenine nucleotides were not altered.

40|$|A two-site enzyme {{immunoassay}} is described {{which does not}} suffer from artifacts inherent in previous assays and has the necessary high sensitivity to determine the endogenous levels of nerve growth factor (NGF) in the sympathetic nervous system and its target organs. Monoclonal and affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies against mouse NGF (mNGF) were covalently linked to glass beads as the first site and coupled to the enzyme beta-galactosidase as the second site. Detection of the fluorescent beta-galactosidase reaction product permitted the determination of 0. 01 - 0. 02 fmol of mNGF per assay. The recovery of mNGF added to homogenates varied between 50 % and 100 %, depending on the tissue. Rat superior cervical and stellate ganglia were found to contain (mean +/- SEM) 25 +/- 4 and 19 +/- 3 ng of NGF per g wet weight, respectively, and the densely innervated submandibular gland, heart atrium, and iris contained 0. 5 +/- 0. 1, 1. 0 +/- 0. 1, and 1. 9 +/- 0. 3 ng of NGF per g <b>wet</b> weight, respectively. <b>Heart</b> ventricle and skeletal muscle, which are poorly innervated by the sympathetic nervous system, did not contain detectable levels of NGF (less than 0. 3 ng/g wet weight).

40|$|Background and aim: Cardiovascular {{diseases}} with vascular calcification {{represent a}} common clinical problem for human {{patients with chronic}} kidney disease (CKD) and those having undergone renal transplantation. Preliminary studies verified that mycophenolic acid (MPA) has an inhibitive effect on the calcification of smooth muscle cells in vitro. The {{aim of this study}} is to verify the anti-calcifying impact of MPA in the animal model. MPA is a noncompetitive and reversible inhibitor of the inosinmonophosphate-dehydrogenase, which prevents proliferation of T- and B lymphocytes. In addition to the immunosuppressive characteristics of MPA, an anti-calcifying effect on the cardiovascular system could be suspected. Methods: In order to induce CKD in the animal model, nephrectomies were conducted in two steps. During the first operation 75 % of the right kidney was nephrectomised by ligature. During the second operation the left kidney was completely removed and the osmotic pump with MPA was subcutaneously implanted into the back. Three days later a high phosphate diet was induced to all animals, because a high level of phosphate in the diet is necessary to develop a calcification. Female DBA/ 2 mice were split into four groups. The animals of the control group had no nephrectomies, only two sham operations without any medication were done. In the solvent group two operations were carried out, without MPA. In the low dose and a high dose MPA group nephrectomies were carried out. To the low dose MPA group 3 mg/kg body weight/per day of MPA was given. The high dose MPA group received 30 mg/kg body weight/per day of MPA. In both cases MPA was administered in a solvent. Blood samples were taken at the beginning and at the end of the trial. The level of parathyroid hormone was measured with ELISA. A parathyroid hormone dysbalance may point to a disturbance of the calcium and phosphate metabolism. In addition alkaline phosphatase, urea, total cholesterol, calcium and inorganic phosphate were analyzed with dry chemistry. The right kidney and the heart were examined histologically with hematoxylin, von Kossa and alizarin red S staining. In addition the <b>heart</b> <b>wet</b> weights and the calcium content of the hearts were measured biochemically and histomorphometricly. Results: A renal failure was successfully induced by nephrectomy and high phosphate diet. In the solvent group an increase of parathyroid hormone and urea was detected. All four groups showed the development of secondary hyperparathyroidism, while the calcium and inorganic phosphate metabolism was disturbed. Urea and inorganic phosphate in blood plasma were decreased in both MPA groups compared to the solvent group. Furthermore, the heart was significantly calcified in the solvent group than in the control group (alizarin red S staining, <b>heart</b> <b>wet</b> weight, histomorphometry, biochemical calcium content). In the low dose MPA group, the biochemical calcium content of the heart was lower compared to the solvent group. In the high dose MPA group all measurements showed a decrease in cardiac calcification compared with the solvent and with the low dose MPA group. Conclusion: MPA has anti-calcifying properties, since it decreases the calcium content in the myocardium, as shown in the animal model. This finding could have a beneficial impact on the therapy of cardiovascular diseases...|$|R
40|$|In {{arterial}} hypertension, coronary flow reserve, {{expressed by}} the difference between autoregulated and maximal coronary flow, is frequently impaired. Previous experimental and clinical investigations using acetylcholine as a stimulus {{for the production of}} endothelium-derived relaxing factor suggested that an impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation, presumably caused by a decreased formation of nitric oxide (NO), may account for this microvascular dysfunction. However, so far no study has been performed that quantifies the formation of NO within the coronary circulation of hypertensive hearts to assess its role in setting coronary vascular tone in the hypertensive heart. We therefore quantified NO formation within the coronary circulation of constant flow-perfused, isolated hearts from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR, 16 th to 26 th week), as a model for hypertensive heart disease, and from the normotensive control strain (Wistar-Kyoto, WKY) using the oxyhemoglobin technique. Coronary perfusion pressure and vascular resistance were almost 30 % higher in SHR compared with WKY hearts. Intracoronarily applied NO decreased coronary vascular resistance by maximally 45 % of resting values in a concentration-dependent manner in both groups. The bradykinin-induced decrease in coronary vascular resistance and the parallel increase in NO release were comparable in SHR and WKY hearts and fell within the vasodilator range of exogenously applied NO. Moreover, basal release of NO normalized to <b>heart</b> <b>wet</b> weight was 50 % higher in SHR compared with WKY hearts. Rates of basal NO release were correlated inversely with changes in coronary perfusion pressure and vascular resistance in both groups (r = -. 85 and -. 84, respectively, P <. 05).

40|$|Haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) is a gadoid {{fish species}} that {{deposits}} dietary lipid {{mainly in the}} liver. The fatty acid (FA) beta-oxidation activity of various tissues was evaluated in juvenile haddock fed graded levels of lipid. The catabolism of a radiolabelled FA, [1 -(14) C]palmitoyl-CoA, through peroxisomal and mitochondrial beta-oxidation was determined in the liver, red and white muscle of juvenile haddock fed 12, 18 and 24 % lipid in the diet. There was no {{significant increase in the}} mitochondrial or peroxisomal beta-oxidation activity in the tissues tested as the dietary lipid level increased from 12 to 24 %. Peroxisomes accounted for 100 % of the beta-oxidation observed in the liver, whereas mitochondrial beta-oxidation dominated in the red (91 %) and white muscle (97 %) of juvenile haddock. Of the tissues tested, red muscle possessed the highest specific activity for beta-oxidation expressed on a per mg protein or per g wet weight basis. However, white muscle, which forms over 50 % of the body mass in gadoid fish was the most important tissue in juvenile haddock for overall FA catabolism. The total lipid and FA composition of these tissues were also determined. This study confirmed that the liver was the major lipid storage organ in haddock. The hepatosomatic index (HSI; 10. 0 - 15. 2 %) and lipid (73. 8 - 79. 3 % wet wt.) in the liver increased significantly as dietary lipid was increased from 12 to 24 % lipid.

40|$|Introduction: Chronic {{intermittent}} hypoxia {{is considered}} as a preconditioning status in cardiovascular health to inducing resistance to the low oxygen supply. Diabetic cardiomyopathy leads to inability of the heart to effective circulation of blood preventing of consequent tissue damages so; {{the aim of this}} study was elucidation of effect of chronic exposure to hypoxia on Cardiac fibrosis and expression of GLUT 4 in experimental diabetic cardiomyopathy. Methods: A total number of 30 rats were randomly divided into three groups; 1 : Normoxia control group (NN, n= 10). 2 : Normoxia diabetic group (ND, n= 10) that took fat diet for 2 weeks then were injected by streptozotocin (37 mg/kg) and 3 : Hypoxia diabetic group (HD, n= 10) : that were exposed to chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) (altitude ≈ 3400 m, 14 % oxygen for 8 weeks). After hypoxia challenge, plasma metabolic parameters including: fasting blood glucose (FBS), triglyceride (TG) and total cholesterol (TC) were measured by colorimetric assay. Cardiac expression of GLUT 4 protein and cardiac collagen accumulation were determined in the excised left ventricle by western blotting, and Masson trichrome staining respectively. Results: Based on resultant data, FBS, TG and TC were significantly (P< 0. 05) decreased in HD vs. ND. Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA) were also significantly attenuated after exposed to CIH in HD group compared to ND group (P< 0. 05). Significant increase in packed cell volume and hemoglobin concentration was observed in HD group compared to ND group (P< 0. 05). Comparison of <b>heart</b> <b>wet</b> weight between three groups showed a significant difference (P< 0. 05) with lower amount in HD and ND versus NN. Myocardial fibrosis was significantly more pronounced in ND when compared to NN. Eight weeks exposure to hypoxia ameliorated this increase in HD group. Intermittent hypoxia significantly increased GLUT 4 protein expression in HD compared to ND group (P< 0. 05). Conclusion: Data suggested that CIH might potentiate to improve glucose homeostasis and cardiac tissue structural damages created in type 2 diabetes (T 2 D) ...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to investigate the}} effect of exogenous sulfhydryl compound administration on the toxicity of doxorubicin in mice. Pretreatment of CDF 1 mice with a pharmacologic dose (2, 000 mg/kg) of n-acetyl-l-cysteine 1 h before doxorubicin (20 mg/kg, i. p.) decreased lethality from 100 % (n = 44) to 37. 7 % (n = 53), P less than 0. 001. Variation in the timing and dose of n-acetylcysteine significantly diminished its protective activity. Pretreatment with n-acetylcysteine also significantly reduced long-term mortality in animals receiving multiple doses of doxorubicin; 10 wk after the third of three doxorubicin doses (5 mg/kg, i. p.) administered at 2 -wk intervals, survival in the n-acetylcysteine pretreated group was 51. 4 % (n = 35) compared with 16. 7 % (n = 30) for animals receiving saline before doxorubicin, P less than 0. 01. In this experiment, n-acetylcysteine pretreatment also diminished doxorubicin-related losses in total body weight and <b>heart</b> <b>wet</b> weight by 55. 2 % (P less than 0. 05), and 60. 9 % (P less than 0. 02), respectively, compared with animals pretreated with saline. N-acetylcysteine pretreatment also ablated electron microscopic evidence of doxorubicin cardiomyopathy without alleviating morphological features of its toxic effects on the liver or small intestinal mucosa. The cardioprotective action of n-acetylcysteine may be partially explained by the 429 +/- 60 % increase in cardiac nonprotein sulfhydryl content (P less than 0. 01) that was measured one hour after n-acetylcysteine administration; nonprotein sulfhydryl concentration in the liver {{at the same time}} was insignificantly different from control levels. Treatment with n-acetylcysteine also increased the nonprotein sulfhydryl content of P 388 leukemia cells nearly threefold; however, it did not after the chemotherapeutic activity of doxorubicin against this murine tumor. Whereas n-acetylcysteine blocked doxorubicin cardiac toxicity, it did not affect the uptake or metabolism of doxorubicin in the heart or liver. These results suggest that the concentration of free sulfhydryl groups in the heart {{may play a role in}} the development of doxorubicin cardiac toxicity and that augmenting cardiac nonprotein sulfhydryl group content with n-acetylcysteine may provide a means to enhance the chemotherapeutic index of doxorubicin...|$|R
40|$|Adenosin-triphosphate (ATP) was {{obtained}} from the skeletal muscle of rabbits and dogs with Lohmann's method as Ba-salt. Before use this was changed to Na-salt which was proved to be pure chromatographically. Using this Na-salt as substrate observation on ATP ase activity were carried out in tissues of the liver, spleen, heart, kedney, duodenum and skeletal muscles as well as in blood and bone marrow of rabbits. Chemical analysis proved that various organs and tissues gave myosin ATP-ase activity showing the values specific to each organ, i. e. about 10 γPi per 100 mg. of <b>wet</b> tissues of <b>heart</b> muscle, liver, spleen, kidney and duodenum, 6 γPi per 100 mg. in bone marrow, quite a low value of about 1 γPi per 100 mg. in circulating blood. In every organ the activity of mitochondrial ATP-ase was as low as 0. 9 - 10. 3 γ Pi per 100 mg., quite lower than that of myosin ATP-ase; and as for the differences between the values of myosin and mitochondrial ATP-ases in each organ, {{it was found that the}} difference was smallest in peripheral blood and greatest in the heart tissue. As for the practical application in the histochemical study, frozen slices of formalin fixation are thought to be the simplest and best. According to their reactions against activating agents (cysteine) and inhibitory agents (PCMB), ATP-ase acn be divided into four types. The first type is of the typical ATP-ase which is demonstrable only in the frozenslices of cardiac and skeletal muscles, and detected especially in the region of anisotropic disk. This reaction is inhibited by PCMB and reactivated by cysteine. The second type is of those found in frozen slices of basillar part of epithelial cells of renal urinary tubules, liver parenchymal cells and biliary tubules and mooth muscle of duodenel wall. This reaction is inhibited by PCMB but not reactivated by cysteine. The third type is of those appear at the brush border of epithelial cells of renal urinary tubules of paraffin sections. This reaction is markedly inhibited by cysteine but stands unaffected by PCMB. The fourth type is of those detectable in various portions of tissues such as the smooth muscle of arterial media and intima as well as various viscera. The reaction remins unaffected either by cysteine or PCMB in both the frozen and the paraffin sections. The reaction of blood cells is the one that rightly belongs to this type. Reactions observable in paraffin sections are the enzyme actions mainly belonging to the third and the fourth types; and it is believed the reaction due to phosphomoesterase (Ⅲrd tpye) and the unknown enzymes other than true ATP-ase (Ⅳth type). In the case of the slices embedded in methacryleric resin all activities excepting that of the brush border of epithelial cells of renal urinary tubules are lost. The ATP-ase activity of leukocytes is found chiefly in the cytoplasm and it is detected in matured cells to a marked degree...|$|R
40|$|A rat {{model to}} assess {{interventions}} to reduce cardiotoxicity of anthracyclines is of interest. The model {{should be able}} to induce significant myocardial damage rapidly {{but at the same time}} allow for measurement of protective interventions. A proposed model includes an in vivo model where rats are treated with repeated intraperitoneal injections of an anthracycline for a relatively short period of time. Effects on physiological variables of cardiotoxicity are subsequently assessed in an ex vivo isolated rat heart model (Langendorff), and effects on biochemical variables by measurement of heat shock proteins (HSP) in myocardial tissue. A model with these elements was tested in this thesis. The model was designed to include a pilot study to assess whether pre-treatment with morphine, an opioid, could reduce cardiotoxicity of the anthracycline doxorubicin. The use of morphine as an analgesic is established in human cancer treatment, and opioids have been reported to induce protection against ischemia and oxidative stress in animal models. Proposed mechanisms of cardiotoxicity of anthracycklines include elements of oxidative stress and impaired calcium homeostasis. Thus, morphine could represent an intervention to reduce cardiotoxicity of anthracyclines. Doxorubicin (DOX), an anthracycline, was administered to female Wistar rats (n = 16) every second day in a dose of 3 mg/kg for 11 days intraperitonealt. A subgroup of rats (n = 8) received pre-treatment with morphine (MO) 3 mg/kg 60 minutes prior to DOX (MO-DOX), while the other eight rats received saline (SAL) of identical volume (SAL-DOX). In the MO-DOX group, 6 out of 8 rats died prior to the end of the protocol, while the remaining two animals were moribund and therefore put to death before end of the protocol to collect tissue for analysis of HSP. The remaining animals (SAL-DOX) were tested in an isolated rat heart model (Langendorff) to measure physiological parameters. Due to loss of the intervention group, a group of animals (n = 5) with no treatment with MO, DOX or SAL were used as control (control hearts) for reduction in physiological parameters. The SAL-DOX group showed a significant reduction (40 - 60 %) in physiologic parameters compared to control hearts irrespective of flow mode (pressure regulated or volume regulated perfusion) in the isolated rat heart model. Furthermore, this group showed a trend for higher (40 %) coronary perfusion pressure, an index of coronary resistance during volume regulated perfusion. Analysis of HSP demonstrated no significant differences in the HSP expression except from HSP 94 which only gave positive results in the SAL-DOX treated group. We also analyzed content of DOX (2. 7 + 0. 8 nmol/g wet weight) and the major metabolite doxorubicinol (0. 14 + 0. 1 nmol/g <b>wet</b> weight) in <b>hearts</b> from SAL-DOX group, respectively. The results demonstrate that the present model can be used for rapid induction of cardiotoxicity in rats, and this has been reported by others. The cardiotoxicity can be measured irrespective of flow mode in the isolated rat heart model, and treatment results in significant accumulation of doxorubicine and its major metabolite in heart tissue. Treatment with doxorubicine in this protocol upregulates expression of HSP 94, but not other HSPs. Pre-treatment with morphine increased mortality when combined with doxorubicine. The results of the pilot study are in conflict with recent [...] ...|$|R

Hypnea cervicornis Ã uma espÃcie de alga marinha vermelha encontrada no nordeste do Brasil da qual foi isolada a lectina H. cervicornis aglutinina (HCA), um polipeptideo que contÃm 90 resÃduos de aminoÃcidos (9193 Da) que se ligam especificamente a glicoproteÃnas do tipo mucina. O objetivo do presente trabalho foi estudar as atividades antiinflamatÃria e antinociceptiva, ainda nÃo exploradas, da HCA. Foram utilizados camundongos Swiss albinos (20 - 35 g) ou ratos Wistar (150 - 250 g). Para o estudo da atividade antiinflamatÃria da HCA, os ratos foram injetados e. v. somente com a lectina nas doses de 10 - 2; 10 - 1; 1 e 10 mg/Kg (peritonite) ou a dose de 1 mg/Kg em associaÃÃo com 5 mg/mL de mucina (1 mg/Kg). ApÃs esse procedimento, os animais foram avaliados nos modelo de peritonite induzida Cg (quimiotÃtico direto) ou por fMLP (quimiotÃtico indireto). HCA (10 - 1; 1 e 10 mg/Kg) inibiu a peritonite induzida por Cg e por fMLP. Observamos que na peritonite induzida por Cg: A administraÃÃo conjunta de HCA (1 mg/Kg) com mucina inibiu sua atividade antiinflamatÃria (p< 0, 05), sugerindo participaÃÃo do sÃtio lectÃnico nesta atividade; o aquecimento de HCA a 100 oC, por 10 minutos, inibiu seu efeito antiinflamatÃrio, indicando a importÃncia de sua estrutura; a microscopia intravital mostrou que a HCA (10 mg/Kg) reduziu o rolamento e adesÃo de leucÃcitos; a lectina induziu a produÃÃo de Ãxido nÃtrico (NO, reaÃÃo de Griess) no soro; Aminoguanidina e L-Nitro-Arginina inibiram a atividade da HCA; HCA nÃo reduziu as concentraÃÃes de citocinas TNF-&# 945; e IL- 1 no peritÃnio. A pressÃo {{arterial}} e o leucograma dos animais nÃo foram alterados pela administraÃÃo de HCA. A lectina nÃo age diretamente sobre neutrÃfilos, pois nÃo inibiu a quimiotaxia {{in vitro}} induzida por agente quimiotÃtico (MIP- 2). No edema de pata induzido por Dextrana ou Cg, HCA (1 mg/Kg) inibiu significativamente (p< 0, 05) apenas o edema de pata induzido por Cg. O efeito antiedematogÃnico da HCA foi prevenido pela administraÃÃo conjunta com mucina. HCA reduziu as contorÃÃes induzidas por Ãcido acÃtico e seu efeito antinociceptivo foi prevenido pela administraÃÃo conjunta com mucina. HCA diminuiu somente a segunda fase do teste da formalina. No teste da placa quente, HCA nÃo apresentou efeito. A lectina tambÃm nÃo alterou a atividade locomotora. A toxicidade sub-crÃnica foi avaliada pelo tratamento de ratos com HCA (1 mg/kg), durante sete dias consecutivos, atravÃs de vÃrios parÃmetros: funÃÃes do rim (peso Ãmido, dosagem de creatinina e urÃia) e do fÃgado (peso Ãmido, avaliaÃÃo da cinÃtica da aspartato amino transaminase e alanina amino transaminase), coraÃÃo (peso Ãmido), estÃmago (peso Ãmido e avaliaÃÃo visual de possÃveis lesÃes), variaÃÃo de massa corporal dos animais tratados e leucograma. Os resultados obtidos nÃo mostraram qualquer alteraÃÃo dos parÃmetros avaliados, demonstrando que a HCA nÃo apresenta nenhuma toxicidade nos animais. Em conjunto, esses dados revelam que a HCA apresenta atividade antiinflamatÃria e antinociceptiva que supostamente podem ser explicadas por bloqueio direto competitivo com carboidratos ligantes de selectinas e/ou indireto, via produÃÃo de NO, que diminuem o rolamento e adesÃo de leucÃcitos sobre o endotÃlio. Lectins are (glyco) proteins that can recognize and reversibly bind to carbohydrates or other substances derived from sugars. They are found throughout animal and vegetal kingdoms. Hypnea cervicornis is {{a species of}} marine red algae found in Northeast of Brazil from which was isolated the lectin Hypnea cervicornis aglutinin (HCA), a polypeptide containing 90 amino acid residues (9193 Da) that binds especifically to mucin-type glycoprotein. The objective of this work was to study the anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive activities of HCA not yet known. Albine Swiss mice (20 - 35 g) and Wistar rats (150 - 250 g) were used. For the study of HCA anti-inflammatory activity, the rats were injected (i. v.) with lectin alone in the doses of 10 - 2; 10 - 1; 1 e 10 mg/Kg (peritonitis) or a dose of 1 mg/Kg associated to 5 mg/mL of mucin (1 mg/Kg). Following this procedure, the animals were evaluated in the peritonitis model induced by Cg (direct neutrophil chemoatractant) or by fMLP (indirect neutrophil chemoatractant). HCA (10 - 1; 1 and 10 mg/Kg) inhibited Cg- and fMLP-induced peritonitis. In Cg-induced peritonitis it was observed that: the administration of HCA (1 mg/Kg) in association with mucin inhibited its anti-inflammatory activity (p< 0. 05), suggesting {{the participation of the}} lectin site on this mechanism; heating HCA at 100 oC, for 10 minutes, inhibited its anti-inflammatory effect, indicating the importance of its structure for that mechanism; the intravital microscopy showed that HCA reduced the rolling and adhesion of the leucocytes; the lectin induced the production of nitric oxide (NO Griess reaction) in serum; aminoguanidine and L-Nitro-arginin inhibited the HCA activity; HCA did not reduce the concentrations of TNF-&# 945; and IL- 1 in the peritoneum. The arterial pressure and the leukogram of the animals were not altered by the administration of HCA. The lectin does not act directly on neutrophils because it did not inhibit the in vitro chemotaxis induced by MIP- 2, a chemotactic agent. In the carragenan (Cg) - or dextran-induced paw edema, HCA (1 mg/Kg) inhibited significantly (p< 0. 05) only the Cg-induced paw edema. The antiedematogenic effect of HCA was prevented when it was administered in association with mucin. HCA reduced the writhes induced by acetic acid and its antinociceptive effect was prevented by the association with mucin. HCA only decreased the second phase of formalin test. In the hot plate, HCA did not show any effects. The lectin did not alter the motor coordination. The HCA subcronic toxicity was evaluated treating rats with a dose of 1 mg/Kg during seven days and analys of several parameters: kidney functions (wet weight, creatinin and urea serum concentrations), liver functions (wet weight, kinetic of serum aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase), <b>heart</b> (<b>wet</b> weight) stomach (wet weight and visual evaluation of possible lesions), variation of body weight of treated animals and leukogram. The results showed no alterations of the evaluated parameters suggesting that HCA seems to be well tolerated by animals. The results taken together reveal that HCA presents anti-inflammatory and nociceptive activities which could be explained by direct competitive blockage with a common selectin carbohydrate ligand and/or indirectly, via NO production, which decrease of rolling and adhesion of leukocytes to endothelium...|$|R

O objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar a atividade antiinflamatÃria e antinociceptiva da Lectina de sementes de Lonchocarpus sericeus (LSL). Para tal, utilizamos camundongos Swiss albinos (25 - 35 g). No estudo da atividade antiinflamatÃria, LSL (3 ou 10 mg/kg; e. v.; 15 minutos) inibiu a migraÃÃo (rolamento e adesÃo de neutrÃfilos) para a cavidade abdominal de animais estimulados com carragenina (Cg), e este efeito parece estar relacionado com a reduÃÃo dos nÃveis de citocinas (TNF-&# 945; and IL- 1 &# 946;) e quimiocinas (MIP- 1 &# 945; [CCL 3], KC [CXCL 1]) por esta lectina. O efeito inibitÃrio da LSL sobre a migraÃÃo de neutrÃfilos, parece tambÃm envolver o aumento nos nÃveis sistÃmicos de Ãxido nÃtrico (NO), pois LSL (10 mg/kg; e. v.) foi capaz de aumentar os nÃveis de NO no soro de animais, e o prÃ-tratamento de camundongos com aminoguanidina (inibidor da Ãxido nÃtrico sintase induzida) foi capaz de reverter o efeito aniinflamatÃrio desta lectina sobre a migraÃÃo de neutrÃfilos. Ainda em relaÃÃo Ã atividade antiinflamatÃria, LSL foi capaz de inibir a migraÃÃo de neutrÃfilos para a cavidade peritoneal de animais imunizados e estimulados com ovoalbumina (OVA), porÃm, esta mesma lectina foi ineficaz em inibir a migraÃÃo de neutrÃfilos {{in vitro}} estimulada por MIP- 2, demonstrando entÃo um papel indireto da LSL (reduÃÃo de citocinas e quimiocinas) na inibiÃÃo da migraÃÃo. No estudo da atividade antinociceptiva, LSL (10 ou 100 mg/kg; e. v.; 15 minutos) reduziu as contorÃÃes abdominais induzidas por Ãcido acÃtico e diminuiu somente a segunda fase do teste da formalina, demostrando uma atividade sobre a dor inflamatÃria. No teste da placa quente, LSL nÃo apresentou efeito. Para avaliar a dor inflamatÃria realizaram-se estudos de atividade antihipernociceptiva. Assim, LSL (3 ou 10 mg/kg; e. v.; 15 minutos) inibiu a hipernocicepÃÃo mecÃnica induzida por administraÃÃo intraplantar de carragenina e ovalbumina (animais imunizados) mas nÃo a induzida por prostaglandina E 2 (PGE 2). Este efeito foi correlacionado ao bloqueio do influxo de neutrÃfilos, sugerido pela reduÃÃo dos nÃveis de mieloperoxidase (MPO) nas patas de animais prÃ-tratados com LSL (3 ou 10 mg/kg; e. v.; 15 minutos) e estimulados com carragenina. Este efeito antihiperalgÃsico parece tambÃm depender da reduÃÃo dos nÃveis de citocinas (TNF-&# 945; and IL- 1 &# 946;) e quimiocinas (MIP- 1 &# 945; [CCL 3], KC [CXCL 1]), uma vez que LSL (3 ou 10 mg/kg; e. v.; 15 minutos) reduziu os nÃveis destes mediadores no tecido da pata de animais estimulados com Cg (intraplantar). Em relaÃÃo a uma possÃvel atividade central, LSL (10 mg/kg; e. v.) nÃo alterou a atividade motora e nem provocou depressÃo nos animais. A toxicidade aguda foi avaliada pelo tratamento de camundongos com LSL (10 mg/kg; e. v.), durante sete dias consecutivos, atravÃs de vÃrios parÃmetros: funÃÃes do rim (peso Ãmido, dosagem de urÃia) e do fÃgado (peso Ãmido, avaliaÃÃo da cinÃtica da aspartato amino transaminase e alanina amino transaminase), coraÃÃo (peso Ãmido), estÃmago (peso Ãmido e avaliaÃÃo visual de possÃveis lesÃes), variaÃÃo de massa corporal dos animais tratados e leucograma. Os resultados obtidos nÃo mostraram qualquer alteraÃÃo dos parÃmetros avaliados, demonstrando que a LSL nÃo apresenta nenhuma toxicidade nos animais. Em conclusÃo, a atividade antiinflamatÃria e antinociceptiva da LSL estÃ associada com a inibiÃÃo da migraÃÃo de neutrÃfilos, que provavelmete Ã reflexo da inibiÃÃo da liberaÃÃo de citocinas e quimiocinas e do aumento na liberaÃÃo de NO. Adicionalmente, esta lectina nÃo apresenta efeitos centrais nem toxicidade agudaLectins are non-immune (glyco) proteins that can recognize and reversibly bind to carbohydrates or other substances derived from sugars. Lonchocarpus sericeus seeds (LSL) shows a molecular mass of 23555 Â 15 Da and a a-metyl glucopyranoside and N-acetyl-glucosamine binding specificity. The {{aim of this}} work was to evaluate the antinoceptive and antiinflammatory activity of lectin from Lonchocarpus sericeus seeds (LSL). To do so, we used swiss mice (25 - 35 g). In the antiinflammatory activity studying, LSL (10 or 100 mg/kg; i. v.; 15 minutes) inhibited the migration (neutrophil rolling and adhesion) to the peritoneal cavities of animals stimulated with carrageenan (Cg), and the effect seems {{to be related to}} the cytokines (TNF-a and IL- 1 b) and chemokines (MIP- 1 a [CCL 3], KC [CXCL 1]) level reduction induced by this lectin. The LSL inhibitory effect on the neutrophil migration seems to be also related to the nitric oxide (NO) systemic levels increasing. LSL was effective on the NO increasing on animalsâ serum. The pretreatment of mice using aminoguanidin (nitric oxide reduced synthase inhibitor) reversed the antiinflammatory effect of lectin on the neutrophil migration. Still referring to the anti-inflammatory activity, LSL was effective on inhibiting the neutrophil migration to the peritoneal cavities of animals immunized and stimulated with ovalbumin (OVA), but the lectin was unable to inhibit an in vitro neutrophil migration induced by MIP- 2, showing an indirect action of LSL (cytokines and chemokines) on the migration inhibition. In the antinoceptive study, LSL (3 or 10 mg/kg; i. v.; 30 minutes) reduced abdominal contortion induced by acetic acid and only decreased the second phase of formalin test, showing an activity on the inflammatory pain. In the hot plate test LSL didnât show any effects. To evaluate the anti-inflammatory pain, we did a study based on the anthihypernociceptive activity. Thus, LSL (10 or 100 mg/kg; i. v.; 15 minutes) inhibited the mechanical hypernociception induced by carrageenan and ovalbumin (immunized animals) intraplantarly administration, but not induced by prostaglandin E 2. (PGE 2). This effect was correlated to the block of neutrophil influx, suggested by the reduction of myeloperoxidase (MPO) levels on animalâs paws pretreated with LSL (3 or 10 mg/kg; i. v.; 15 minutes) and stimulated with carregeenan. This antihyperalgesic effect seems to be highly dependent of the cytokines (TNF-a and IL- 1 b) and chemokines (MIP- 1 a [CCL 3], KC [CXCL 1]) level decreasing, since LSL (10 or 100 mg/kg; i. v.; 15 minutes) reduced these mediatorsâ levels on animalâs paws pretreated with Cg (intraplantar). Corresponding to the possible central activity, LSL (10 mg/kg; i. v.) did not alter the motor activity and not provoked depression on animals. LSL acute toxicity was evaluated by treating the rats with LSL (10 mg/kg; i. v.) during seven days analyzing several parameters of the animals: kidney functions (wet weight, urea dosage), liver functions (wet weight, kinetic evaluation of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase), <b>heart</b> (<b>wet</b> weight) stomach (wet weight and visual evaluation of possible lesions), variation in body weight of treated animals and leukogram. The obtained results didnât show any alteration on the evaluated parameters suggesting that LSL doesnât show any toxicity on animals. In conclusion, the antinoceptive and antihyperalgesic activity of LSL are associated to the inhibition of the neutrophil migration; it is probably a reflection of an inhibition on cytokines and chemokines free flowing and for the increasing of NO free flow. Additionally, this lectin doesnât show acute toxicity and central effect...|$|R
