60|$|If {{we find a}} tiger, and we get a good shot--or perhaps {{many good}} shots--at him, and he falls wounded or {{apparently}} dead, we must still {{be very careful about}} approaching him, for he is very hard to kill. Often, <b>when</b> <b>pierced</b> with many balls, a tiger is considered to have breathed his last, he springs up all of a sudden, seizes one of his hunters in his great jaws, tears him with his claws, and then falls back dead.|$|E

60|$|His motions plainly denoted his extreme exhaustion. In most land animals {{there are}} certain valves or flood-gates in many of their veins, whereby when wounded, the blood is in some degree at least {{instantly}} shut off in certain directions. Not so with the whale; one of whose peculiarities it is, to have an entire non-valvular structure of the blood-vessels, so that <b>when</b> <b>pierced</b> even by so small a point as a harpoon, a deadly drain is at once begun upon his whole arterial system; and when this is heightened by the extraordinary pressure of water at a great distance below the surface, his life {{may be said to}} pour from him in incessant streams. Yet so vast is the quantity of blood in him, and so distant and numerous its interior fountains, that he will keep thus bleeding and bleeding for a considerable period; even as in a drought a river will flow, whose source is in the well-springs of far-off and indiscernible hills. Even now, when the boats pulled upon this whale, and perilously drew over his swaying flukes, and the lances were darted into him, they were followed by steady jets from the new made wound, which kept continually playing, while the natural spout-hole in his head was only at intervals, however rapid, sending its affrighted moisture into the air. From this last vent no blood yet came, because no vital part of him had thus far been struck. His life, as they significantly call it, was untouched.|$|E

50|$|However, {{the legend}} says that {{coat of arms}} was granted by King Władysław Łokietek to a peasant soldier (and his family) after the Battle of Płowce (1331) in which the Polish armies {{defeated}} the 40,000-strong force of the Teutonic Knights with minimal casualties. The man fought with great courage and only fell in battle <b>when</b> <b>pierced</b> by three spears in the abdominal region which caused his bowels to fall out.

50|$|Pressurized flow of latex {{has been}} studied in {{multiple}} Asclepias species {{as a form of}} defense in addition to the secondary metabolites stored in the latex. In order to augment the defense of the plant some non-articulated laticifer cells contain highly pressurized stores of latex. It has been noted that pressure may be produced by the osmotic uptake of water into the laticifer cell resulting in a turgid cell. <b>When</b> <b>pierced</b> the cell bursts and latex travels quickly through the canal system to stop the herbivore. A desert species, Bursera schlechtendalii, pressurizes the canals right where leaves attach to the stem so that when a grazer eats a leaf latex shoots out. This process is termed the “squirt gun” defense.|$|E

50|$|Adams' {{official}} citation reads:M/Sgt. Adams, Company A, distinguished {{himself by}} conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity {{above and beyond}} the call of duty in action against an enemy. At approximately 0100 hours, M/Sgt. Adams' platoon, holding an outpost some 200 yards ahead of his company, came under a determined attack by an estimated 250 enemy troops. Intense small-arms, machine gun, and mortar fire from 3 sides pressed the platoon back against the main line of resistance. Observing approximately 150 hostile troops silhouetted against the skyline advancing against his platoon, M/Sgt. Adams leaped to his feet, urged his men to fix bayonets, and he, with 13 members of his platoon, charged this hostile force with indomitable courage. Within 50 yards of the enemy M/Sgt. Adams was knocked to the ground <b>when</b> <b>pierced</b> in the leg by an enemy bullet. He jumped to his feet and, ignoring his wound, continued on to close with the enemy when he was knocked down 4 times from the concussion of grenades which had bounced off his body. Shouting orders he charged the enemy positions and engaged them in hand-to-hand combat where man after man fell before his terrific onslaught with bayonet and rifle butt. After nearly an hour of vicious action M/Sgt. Adams and his comrades routed the fanatical foe, killing over 50 and forcing the remainder to withdraw. Upon receiving orders that his battalion was moving back he provided cover fire while his men withdrew. M/Sgt. Adams' superb leadership, incredible courage, and consummate devotion to duty so inspired his comrades that the enemy attack was completely thwarted, saving his battalion from possible disaster. His sustained personal bravery and indomitable fighting spirit against overwhelming odds reflect the utmost glory upon himself and uphold the finest traditions of the infantry and the military service.|$|E
5000|$|The Posleen {{are broken}} up into two {{distinct}} elements, the 'Normals' and the 'God Kings'. While these share similar physical characteristics (resistance to {{biological and chemical}} weapons, highly efficient metabolisms, armored body structures etc.), the 'God Kings' are also blessed with enhanced intelligence that makes them the leaders of their less intelligent brethren, {{as well as a}} crest on their necks that expands like certain lizards. In battle, God Kings ride on personal fighting vehicles called Tenar, which are not only heavily armed (usually with plasma cannons and hypervelocity missiles) but also contain communications equipment, a sensor array and tactical displays. The quality of Tenar and their systems varies due to personal preference on the part of their owners and on their owner's wealth. Tenar resemble flying saucers and use anti-grav technology to fly; they can not only hover close to the ground but fly at significant altitudes. A tenar can sense and track isolated weapons fire and respond automatically making it very dangerous to snipe a God King; however, once a certain amount of weapons fire is present in the environment, the [...] "noise" [...] keeps the tenar from being able to keep track and can no longer identify specific threats. However, even in this case, tenar have anti-air capabilities that make conventional aircraft useless. Flying anything from a helicopter to an F-22 in the line of sight of a Tenar is suicide and hugging the ground just leaves an aircraft open to mass fire from the normals. Tenar are durable but contain very volatile energy cores, which explode quite powerfully <b>when</b> <b>pierced,</b> usually killing many nearby normals and potentially other tenar as well. In addition to his Tenar, many God Kings carry swords with mono-molecular blades. A God King will lead a [...] "fief" [...] of several hundred normals whom he essentially owns, he is also responsible for outfitting them at his own expense. God Kings get their starts by working for a higher ranking God King who will set them up with a simple tenar and a small and barely equipped fief in return for subservience. In the novel Yellow Eyes, it is shown that they lack skill in dealing with certain unreasonable Terran problems (i.e. soldier ant swarms and other deep jungle hazards).|$|E
