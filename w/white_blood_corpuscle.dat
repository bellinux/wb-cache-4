40|$|Researching {{into the}} {{condition}} of dispersion of blood-platelets in blood-vessels, the following results were obtained. 1) In {{the case of a}} normal rabbit, an injection of adrenalin caused a remarkable increase of blood-platelets as well as of <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>corpuscles,</b> but after. splenectomy, this increase did not occur. 2) When atropin was injected, the number of blood-platelets decreased proportion-ately with the decrease of the <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>corpuscles.</b> 3) An increase of blood-platelets was also demonstrable after administration of milk, presenting a condition which bore a resemblance to leucocytosis by digestion. But after splenectomy, administration of milk did not induce the increase of <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>corpuscles.</b> In this case the number of blood-platelets also tended to decrease. 4) After the operation of cutting the vagus nerves at the cervix, <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> corpus-cles as well as blood-platelets decreased in the peripheral blood-vessels, and in the spleen, the blood-platelets of the veins showed a greater increase than those of the arteries; this indicated that there was some difference from normal conditions. In this case, no increase of <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>corpuscles</b> and of blood-platelets by digestion was observed in the peripheral vessels. The quantitative relation of these <b>blood</b> <b>corpuscles</b> in the splenic vessels remains constant (Namely, there are more <b>blood</b> <b>corpuscles</b> in the veins than in the arteries,) not only in the normal condition but also after cutting vagus nerves. 5) After cutting the cervical cord, a remarkable decrease of <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>corpuscles</b> and of blood-platelets in the peripheral vessels was observed, and the splenic arteries and veins showed some difference from their normal condition, namely, there were more blood-platelets and red <b>blood</b> <b>corpuscles</b> in the splenic veins than in the splenic arteries. In this case the changes by digestion, which were so remarkable in normal conditions, did not occur in any blood vessels. In fine, it was concluded that the blood-platelets and <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>corpuscles</b> undergo a common numerical change, and that the division of the former platelet is modified by the abnormal function of the autonomic nervous system...|$|R

40|$|The {{study of}} the defense {{mechanisms}} in invertebrates started with marine animals. The first report on the cellular defense in invertebrates was the observation of phagocytosis in starfish larvae and Daphnia (Metchnikoff, 1884). It was suggested that phagocytes {{play a significant role}} in the defense mechanisms of all evolutionary stages of animals starting from unicellular animals to mammals. The study of hemolysins in the horse-shoe crab by Noguchi (1903) was the first study on the humoral immunity of invertebrates. Since 1960, there was a renewed interest in the study of defense mechanisms in invertebrates, which was suggested to be because of two reasons: (1) to find out those mechanisms in invertebrates that are also discovered in vertebrates and (2) the development of intensive mariculture requires better knowledge of the factors that may lead to mortality of the crustaceans and mollusc due to failure of their defense systems. Marine invertebrates served as experimental materials for phylogenetic study of defense mechanisms in Animal Kingdom from late 191 h century to the beginning of 20 lh century (Mori, 1990). Among invertebrates, the defense systems of molluscs and insects are being studied extensively in order to understand the basics of invertebrate inullune system. During the past three decades, there has evolved a considerable interest in how the molluscs defend themselves against the invaders. Immunity of molluscs is comprised of cell-mediated immunity and humoral mechanisms. The cell-mediated immunity is the function of hemocytes, while humoral immunity is provided by the serum factors. There are many evidences, which suggest that these two are interrelated (Cheng, 1990). Hemolymph in invertebrates is analogous to blood in vertebrates.

It is a randomized controlled clinical trial. Materials and Methods: A total of 50 healthy controls, 50 chronic generalized gingivitis, and 50 chronic generalized periodontitis patients were selected. Hemoglobin levels (Hb), erythrocyte count red blood cell, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), mean corpuscular volu e (MCV), mean corpuscular Hb (MCH) and MCH concentration (MCHC), gingival index, plaque index, probing pocket depth, and clinical attachment level were recorded. Intergroup comparison of blood parameters is by one-way ANOVA. Intergroup pair wise comparison of the three groups is by Newman–Keuls multiple post-hoc procedures. Karl Pearsons's correlation coefficient method is used for correlation between different parameters for three groups.

6000|$|Section 66. Through {{connective}} tissues {{wander the}} phagocytes, {{cells that are}} difficult to distinguish, if really distinct, from the <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>corpuscles.</b> These cells possess a remarkable freedom; they show an initiative of their own, and seem endowed with a subordinate individuality. They occur in great numbers in a tissue called, botryoidal tissue (Figure XIV.), which occurs especially in masses and patches along the course of the alimentary canal, in its walls. The tonsils, swellings {{on either side of the}} throat, are such masses, and aggregates occur as visible patches, the Peyer's patches, on the ileum. It also constitutes the mass of the vermiform appendix and the wall of the sacculus rotundus; and in the young animal the [...] "thymus gland," [...] ventral to the heart, and less entirely, the [...] "thyroid gland," [...] ventral to the larynx, are similar structures, which are reduced or disappear as development proceeds. It is evident that in these two latter cases the term [...] "gland" [...] is somewhat of a misnomer. The matrix of botryoidal tissue is a network of stretched and hollowed connective tissue cells-- it is not a secretion, as cartilage matrix appears to be. During digestion, the phagocytes prowl into the intestine, and ingest and devour bacteria, that might otherwise give rise to disease. In inflammation, we may note here, they converge from all directions upon the point wounded or irritated. They appear to be the active agents in all processes of absorption (see osteoclasts under bone), and for instance, migrate into and devour the tissue of the tadpole's tail, during its metamorphosis to the adult frog.|$|R

40|$|After {{making clear}} the {{influence}} of some sympathetic poisons upon the coagulative components, consequently, upon the blood coagulability, {{it was able to}} apprehend that the autonomic nerve system may have a close relation to the formation of each component, and also, having compared the action of other sympathetic poisons with those of adrenalin, it was brought to light that tyramin, when large doses are injected, acts upon the blood coagulation, quite dfferently from the case with adrenalin, and the action of tetrahydro-β-naphthylamin (β-T) manifests a still less analogous effect. 1) Adrenalin, when injected intravenously in small doses in a rabbit i. e. 0. 001 - 0. 01 mg per kg shortens the coagulation time to one-half or one-third of the former duration, iucreases fibrinogen and thrombin, and decreases antithrombin. By increasing of the dose, the shortening after small dose changes to a lengthening, which later is followed by a shortening after a medium dose as 0. 01 mg, while after a large dose (i. e. 0. 03 - 0. 05 mg) comes to a lengthening only. As for coagulative components it decreases fibrinogen and thrombin, and increases antithrombin in these doses. The effects of adrenalin on the clotting time take no corresponding course with those on body temperature but consist with a part of those on the number of <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>corpuscles.</b> Farther the addition of various amounts of adrenalin to the blood-plasma does not give any influence upon the clotting time. On the other hand there is a welldefined parallelism between both the curves of change in the amount of coagulative components, and the lengthening or shortening of the coagulation time. The action of adrenalin, therefore, seems principally due to the change of the quantity of coagulative elements in the blood. Secondly, from the cercumstances that the action of adrenalin in small doses on the coagulative components is reversed by the preliminary disposition of atropin (or yohimbin), I am led to a conclusion that adrenalin in small doses hastenes the coagulation by stimulating the accelerative fibres of the sympathic nerve, while in larger doses, retards it by irritating its inhibitory fibres. 2) Experimenting on a rabbit, tyramin given intravenously in small doses (i. e. 0. 005 - 0. 01 g) quickens the coagulation time of blood having no direct action on the blood with added tyramin. Fibrinogen and thrombin increases when small doses are injected, while fibrinogen decreases, and antithrombin increases with large doses. 3) By injecting β-T in large doses (i. e. 0. 01 - 0. 03 g) it retards the coagulation time, and decreases fibrinogen and thrombin, and increases antithrombin, but with small doses (i. e. 0. 003 - 0. 005 g) it hastenes, though the change of those coagulative components are similar but uncertain. 4) On the process of clotting, tyramin in large doses as well as β-T appear to be acted upon from some other unknown cause than by stimulating the sympathetic nerve, as adrenalin does...|$|R

It has long since been known that the rate of corpuscle sedimentation is being accelerated in schizophrenics. A simple physical cause that <b>blood</b> <b>corpuscles</b> are flat and numerous can explain this phenomenon. It is said that there is an antisphering substance among the factors controlling the thickness and roundness of <b>blood</b> <b>corpuscles.</b> Yet it has not been determined whether this substance {{on the surface of the}} blood of schizophrenics is large or small. <b>Blood</b> <b>corpuscles</b> are said to lose their peculiar disc-shape and to be completely destroyed at the pH of 9. 2 when the antisphering substance is removed from the surface of <b>blood</b> <b>corpuscles.</b> The lower the pH is the better is the absorption of this substance on the surface of blood corpuscles; and it seems that the more this substance attaches itself to <b>blood</b> <b>corpuscles</b> the greater is the degree of flatness and in this connection it is interesting to note that the pH of schizophrenic blood is low in low in general. On the other hand, however, sphericity is increased at the time when the acidity of blood is increased due to a sudden movement of acidic substances immediately after ECT. Again in the case of coma of insulin treatment, blood tends to be alkaline and even then an increase in the sphericity of corpuscles is indicated.

The muscular wall of the ventricle, {{which is responsible for}} pumping blood out of the heart, can be [...] thick. The aorta, an artery, can be [...] thick. Their resting heart rate is 60 to 140 beats per minute (bpm), as opposed to the 60 to 100 bpm in humans. When diving, their heart rate will drop to 4 to 15 bpm to conserve oxygen. Like toothed whales, they have a dense network of blood vessels (rete mirabile) which prevents heat-loss. Like in most mammals, heat is lost in their extremities, so, in baleen whales, warm blood in the arteries is surrounded by veins to prevent heat loss during transport. As well as this, heat inevitably given off by the arteries warms blood in the surrounding veins as it travels back into the core. This is otherwise known as countercurrent exchange. To counteract overheating while in warmer waters, baleen whales reroute blood to the skin to accelerate heat-loss. They have the largest <b>blood</b> <b>corpuscles</b> (red and <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> cells) of any mammal, measuring [...] in diameter, as opposed to human's [...] <b>blood</b> <b>corpuscles.</b>|$|R
