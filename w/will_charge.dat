This unit is {{wired in series}} with the load. Diodes (D2, D3, D4 and D5) form a bridge which generates pulsed DC. R1 and C1 form a circuit with a time constant. As the voltage increases from zero (at the start of every halfwave) C1 <b>will</b> <b>charge</b> up. When C1 is able to make Zener diode D6 conduct and inject current into the SCR, the SCR will fire. When the SCR conducts then D1 will discharge C1 via the SCR. The SCR will shut off when the current falls to zero when the supply voltage drops {{at the end of}} the half cycle, ready for the circuit to start work on the next half cycle. This is an example of a Leading Edge Dimmer.|$|E

25|$|Bell Canada usage-based billing: On October 28, 2010, the CRTC {{handed down}} its final {{decision}} on how wholesale customers can be billed by large network owners. Under the plan which starts within 90 days, Bell {{will be able to}} charge wholesale service providers a flat monthly fee to connect to its network, and for a set monthly usage limit per each ISP customer the ISP has. Beyond that set limit, individual users will be charged per gigabyte, depending on the speed of their connections. Customers using the fastest connections of five megabits per second, for example, will have a monthly allotment of 60 GB, beyond which Bell <b>will</b> <b>charge</b> $1.12 per GB to a maximum of $22.50. If a customer uses more than 300 GB a month, Bell will also be able to implement an additional charge of 75 cents per gigabyte. In May 2010, the CRTC ruled that Bell could not implement its usage-based billing system until all of its own retail customers had been moved off older, unlimited downloading plans. The requirement would have meant that Bell would have to move its oldest and most loyal customers. The CRTC also added that Bell would be required to offer to wholesale ISPs the same usage insurance plan it sells to retail customers. Bell appealed both requirements, citing that the rules do not apply to cable companies and that they constituted proactive rate regulation by the CRTC, which goes against government official policy direction that the regulator only intervene in markets after a competitive problem has been proven. In Thursday's decision, the CRTC rescinded both requirements, thereby giving Bell the go-ahead to implement usage-based billing. This ruling according to Teksavvy handcuffs the competitive market. This has been asked by Stephen Harper and Parliament to have the decision reviewed. According to a tweet by Industry Minister Tony Clement, unless the CRTC reverses this decision, the government will use its override power to reverse the decision.|$|E

[...] This led founder Samuel Goldwyn, Jr. to remark: [...] "The fact that Columbia is distributing the Care Bears sequel {{is typical of the}} greed of the big studios. Someone else has to go in and prove something works, then a studio <b>will</b> <b>charge</b> in."

Having held a five-week public consultation with residents in the autumn of 2008, Johnson decided to remove the 2007 Western Extension from the congestion charging zone beginning on January 4, 2011, to increase the basic charge to , and also to introduce an automated payment system called Congestion Charging Auto Pay (CC Auto Pay), which <b>will</b> <b>charge</b> vehicles {{based on the number of}} charging days a vehicle travels within the charging zone each month, and the drivers of these vehicles will pay a reduced [...] daily charge.|$|E
