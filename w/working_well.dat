5|$|Although {{the main}} story ends here, the {{introduction}} of the Broken Steel DLC creates a new choice with the ending, in that the Lone Wanderer can send one of their radiation-immune companions into the chamber to input the code. Furthermore, the game remains open-ended from this point onwards, with the Wanderer surviving the radiation they were subjected to, and recovering two weeks later to the news that the purifier is <b>working</b> <b>well</b> and supplying clean water {{to the people of the}} waste, or has been having an adverse effect on life thanks to {{the introduction of}} the modified FEV. Sarah Lyons does not survive if sent into the chamber in the Broken Steel ending.|$|E
5|$|As {{with his}} {{previous}} collaborations with Bryan Singer on The Usual Suspects, Superman Returns and X2, editor and composer John Ottman edited the film without a temp track, noting if {{the film was}} <b>working</b> <b>well</b> without music, it was becoming a strong product. Since Valkyrie drew its inspirations from previous World War II films like The Great Escape (1963), Where Eagles Dare (1968), Patton (1970), and Midway (1976), filmmakers initially had a cut where title cards introduced characters and their roles. When the cut was test screened with an American audience, the title cards were removed due to complaints that {{there were too many}} characters to follow.|$|E

5|$|Early on {{the morning}} of 3February, Terra Nova arrived {{unexpectedly}} in the Bay of Whales. She had sailed from New Zealand on 29November 1910 and had arrived in McMurdo Sound early in January. After landing Scott and his main party there, Terra Nova had taken a party of six men, led by Victor Campbell, eastward to King Edward VII Land. This group intended to explore this then-unknown territory, but had been prevented by sea ice from approaching the shore. The ship was sailing westward along the Barrier edge in search of a possible landing place when it encountered Fram. Scott had previously speculated that Amundsen might make his base in the Weddell Sea area, {{on the opposite side of}} the continent; this proof that the Norwegians would be starting the race for the pole with a 60 nautical mile advantage was an alarming prospect for the British. The two groups behaved civilly towards each other; Campbell and his officers Harry Pennell and George Murray Levick breakfasted aboard Fram, and reciprocated with lunch on the Terra Nova. Amundsen was relieved to learn that Terra Nova had no wireless radio, since that might have imperilled his strategy to be first with the news of a polar victory. He was worried, however, by a remark of Campbell's that implied that Scott's motorised sledges were <b>working</b> <b>well.</b> Nevertheless, he offered the British party a site alongside Framheim as a base for the exploration of King Edward VII Land. Campbell turned the offer down, and sailed for McMurdo Sound to inform Scott of Amundsen's whereabouts.|$|E

25|$|Even though {{functional}} units often {{perform with}} a high level of efficiency, their level of cooperation with each other is sometimes compromised. Such groups may have difficulty <b>working</b> <b>well</b> with each other as they may be territorial and unwilling to cooperate. The occurrence of infighting among units may cause delays, reduced commitment due to competing interests, and wasted time, making projects fall behind schedule. This ultimately can bring down production levels overall, and the company-wide employee commitment toward meeting organizational goals.|$|E
25|$|Management of the {{boarding}} school was an ongoing source of contention in Stockbridge. Martin Kellogg had been leading the school, to which Edwards and Woodbridge objected. They requested {{that a new}} teacher be sent, and Gideon Hawley arrived in February 1752 to teach the Mohawks and Oneidas (the resident Mahicans were still taught at Woodbridge's school). However, Kellogg {{was supported by the}} Williamses and Joseph Dwight, and so refused to abandon his post, resulting in a battle for control. In April, Timothy and other supporters of Edwards met to encourage the few remaining students' families that they should remove their children from Kellogg's classes. In response, Dwight presented a report to the General Court, stating that Kellogg's methods had been <b>working</b> <b>well,</b> until Edwards and Woodbridge interfered, and tried to get Edwards removed as minister. A rare point of agreement between the two camps was that the ginseng craze was drawing many of the Mohawks away. Timothy had been elected to the General Court, and so was able to refute this testimony, as well as to inform Edwards of the proceedings. This feud continued through Edwards' stay in Stockbridge. In addition to being elected as a representative, Timothy, by then known to the Native Americans as Solohkuwauneh, was made a Justice of the Peace in 1752, at the recommendation of Edwards. Timothy later made a judge of both probate and of Common Pleas, in 1761. Unfortunately, his historic docket was later destroyed by a fire in 1846.|$|E

500|$|However, {{because of}} the number of times that a Star Trek film was {{announced}} in the 1970s, the Paramount executives decided that they could not lose face once more by making an announcement, only to potentially reverse the decision in several months time. Because of this, production continued on Phase II for a further five months after the decision was made that it would not go into production. By November, Livingston and Roddenberry were no longer <b>working</b> <b>well</b> together. They had each re-drafted [...] "In Thy Image" [...] themselves, and presented these versions to Eisner. The Paramount executive's response was that Roddenberry's version was suited for television, and Livingston's was better for a motion picture – and better overall. Collins was assigned to combine certain elements of Roddenberry's version into Livingston's and to complete that draft by the end of the month.|$|E

500|$|In 1988, Kim Deal of the Pixies and Tanya Donelly of Throwing Muses became {{good friends}} {{when the two}} bands toured Europe together. Deal and Donelly spent time playing guitar and {{drinking}} beer, and shared musical ideas with each other. During the tour, and later in Boston—the hometown of both groups—the two friends often went clubbing together. On one outing at a Sugarcubes concert, dance music was playing between sets, and the two drunkenly decided to write and record some dance songs. They envisioned an [...] "organic dance band" [...] that would consist of Deal on bass, Donelly on guitar, and two drummers; they recorded Donelly's composition [...] "Rise" [...] with Throwing Muses' David Narcizo, and planned to do other originals, {{as well as a}} cover of Rufus and Chaka Khan's [...] "Tell Me Something Good".
