5|$|It is {{possible}} to mimic this asymmetry in the laboratory in model bilayer systems. Certain types of very small artificial vesicle <b>will</b> <b>automatically</b> make themselves slightly asymmetric, although the mechanism by which this asymmetry is generated {{is very different from}} that in cells. By utilizing two different monolayers in Langmuir-Blodgett deposition or a combination of Langmuir-Blodgett and vesicle rupture deposition it is also possible to synthesize an asymmetric planar bilayer. This asymmetry may be lost over time as lipids in supported bilayers can be prone to flip-flop.|$|E

5|$|Several {{private and}} public motor {{carriers}} such as Frito-Lay, United Parcel Service, and Werner Enterprises, have voluntarily implemented electronic on-board recorders to ensure drivers are {{in compliance with the}} federal regulations, to reduce the errors and hassles associated with paper log books, and to improve driver retention and recruitment. EOBRs automatically record the driving time and cannot be easily forged. Any violation of the HOS <b>will</b> <b>automatically</b> be recorded and reported to the company. The FMCSA is considering making EOBRs mandatory for all motor carriers.|$|E
5|$|Link also enters {{this mode}} when {{attacked}} by wandering monsters. Whenever the player traverses the various environments of Hyrule, enemy silhouettes appear and pursue him. Of the three random creatures that appear, {{there are three}} types which correspond to the relative difficulty of the monsters in battle mode: a small, weak blob denoting easy enemies, a large, strong biped denoting harder enemies, and a Fairy, which will put Link on a single screen with a free Fairy to refill his health. This separate method of traveling and entering combat {{is one of many}} aspects adapted from the role-playing video game genre. Stepping onto particular spots in the overworld map <b>will</b> <b>automatically</b> switch the game to a side-scrolling mode for an enemy encounter or item pickup.|$|E
5|$|The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess is an action-adventure game {{focused on}} combat, exploration, and puzzle-solving. It uses the basic control scheme {{introduced}} in , including context-sensitive action buttons and L-targeting (Z-targeting on the Wii), {{a system that}} allows the player to keep Link's view focused on an enemy or important object while moving and attacking. Link can walk, run, and attack, and <b>will</b> <b>automatically</b> jump when running off of or reaching for a ledge. Link uses a sword and shield in combat, complemented with secondary weapons and items, including a bow and arrows, a boomerang, and bombs. While L-targeting, projectile-based weapons can be fired at a target {{without the need for}} manual aiming.|$|E

5|$|The village {{stretches}} primarily along {{a single}} carriageway road known as The Street. The north-eastern end of The Street is a designated Conservation Area. The lack of development stems from its position within the Kent Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) and a Site of Nature Conservation Interest, which influences local planning laws and limits permission to build new housing. All development is subject to {{a high level of}} scrutiny; any development that would adversely affect the natural beauty of the landscape <b>will</b> <b>automatically</b> be resisted, and large-scale development proposals must be accompanied by an environmental impact assessment. The last major development was that of the residential cul-de-sac Draysfield.|$|E
5|$|To {{minimize}} the hazards along this portion, a command center staffed with emergency response vehicles and tow trucks on standby monitors cameras along the tunnels and viaducts in the canyon. Traffic signals {{have been placed}} at strategic locations to stop traffic {{in the event of}} an accident, and variable message signs equipped with radar guns <b>will</b> <b>automatically</b> warn motorists exceeding the design speed of one of the curves. The USDOT makes provision for bicycles, which are usually prohibited along Interstate Highways, along the freeway corridor in Glenwood Canyon.|$|E
5|$|When {{the main}} attacking Japanese force has been located, the player must send all {{available}} air units to engage them in combat. Air combat takes place over real time, and may {{take up to}} a minute of travel time once launched from an aircraft carrier. Aircraft will run out of fuel over time and will crash if not refuelled at a carrier. The game contains elements of arcade gameplay, which <b>will</b> <b>automatically</b> enable once the player comes {{into contact with the}} enemy. The arcade sequences involves the player utilising an anti-air machine gun in order to shoot down Japanese aircraft. The game ends once all four Japanese aircraft carriers have been destroyed.|$|E

5|$|Dan's {{health is}} {{determined}} by a health bar, which reduces when Dan is hit. It will deplete completely if Dan drowns or falls from a great height. If Dan runs out of health, the game will end. Dan can extend his maximum health by collecting Life Bottles, which <b>will</b> <b>automatically</b> refill his health bar if it drops to zero. Also hidden throughout the game are Life Vials and Life Fountains that replenish Dan's health and fill any empty Life Bottles Dan has. In each level, there is a hidden Chalice of Souls, which can be collected if the player dispatches enough enemies (some Chalices are awarded via other means). If the player clears a level with a Chalice in hand, Dan is warped to the Hall of Heroes, where he can speak to a hero who will give him rewards, such as weapons. If the player finishes the game with all the Chalices, the true ending is revealed.|$|E
5|$|During battle, players cast spells {{using an}} {{assigned}} Persona: each spell drains a character's Spell Point meter. Each Persona has different elemental strengths and weaknesses, and different Personas {{can be used}} for defense, healing or elemental attacks. While a Persona is originally quite weak, if it is used enough, it will achieve a higher rank, with Rank 8 being the highest possible. As the Persona's rank is raised, that Persona is able to cast more powerful spells. In addition to individual actions, the player can align characters to trigger a Fusion Spell: when two or more party members use a certain sequence of spells, they <b>will</b> <b>automatically</b> summon multiple Personas to generate a powerful attack. During battles, both characters and Personas earn experience points. The player has the option to activate an Auto-battle option, having combat play out without player interaction.|$|E
5|$|If the Bismarck {{has been}} intercepted or {{compromised}} by Royal Navy ships, the game <b>will</b> <b>automatically</b> shift to an arcade sequence {{which will give}} the player an opportunity to defend the ship against a British attack, or alternatively, if playing as the British, the sequence is utilised in order to destroy the Bismarck. The feature can be displayed at any time, though it is automatically enabled if either side comes into conflict. The interface of the feature is split into three sections; {{the upper part of}} the screen shows a view of the ocean in front of the ship and any hostile ship in the vicinity. The middle section contains buttons and icons which are used to control ship movement and to fire weapons. The lower part of the screen displays a diagrammatic representation of the ship from the side chosen (Bismarck or Royal Navy ships); the diagram will change colours once the ship receives damage from shelling.|$|E

5|$|Session Attacks are {{combination}} {{attacks that}} can be triggered by targeting an enemy's weakness. If another party member possesses a Session Skill linking {{to the type of}} attack used, they <b>will</b> <b>automatically</b> perform a pursuit attack, which may then trigger another attack and so on. For example, if one party member attacks with an ice attack, another party member with an Ice-Elec skill will follow up with an electrical attack. Session Attacks may also be carried out by the enemy if they target a party member's weakness. By building up a special meter through attacks, players can earn SP which can be used to trigger Performance attacks, which can be earned through Unity and by completing side-stories. These are called Duo Attacks which are performed by a partner's Mirage. Dual Attacks, on the other hand, can be triggered during a Session Attack to extend the combo at random times. Additionally, party members can learn Ad-lib Performances which may randomly activate while performing certain skills.|$|E
5|$|Similar to Capcom's various Street Fighter titles, X-Men vs. Street Fighter is a 2D {{fighting}} game {{in which}} players control various characters to engage in one-on-one combat, attempting to knock out the opponent by depleting their health. It is the first formal installment in the Marvel vs. Capcom series and features dual-character selection and tag team battles. Instead of the typical best-of-three round format, matches consist of a single round. Players select two characters {{at the beginning of}} a match, each sporting their own life gauge. Players control one character at a time, while the other awaits off-screen. The starting character can tag in the off-screen character at any time during the fight. The dormant character will also slowly recover a portion of their vitality while the current character is fighting. If one character loses all of their vitality, then the tag partner <b>will</b> <b>automatically</b> come into play. The match continues until both characters on either team are defeated. If the timer runs out before either team is knocked out, then the player with the most remaining health is declared the winner.|$|E
5|$|The game {{also has}} a {{competitive}} mode, where two players compete against each other to the finish line, as either Sonic or Tails, in a split-screen race through three of the regular levels and a special stage. After one player finishes one of the regular levels, the other player must finish the zone within 60 seconds, or the level ends instantly. In the regular levels, players are ranked in five areas (score, time, rings held {{at the end of}} the level, total rings collected, and the number of item boxes broken). The player with wins in the most number of categories wins the level. In the Special Stage, players compete to obtain the most rings. The mode ends when all stages have been completed, or if a player loses all their lives, in which their opponent <b>will</b> <b>automatically</b> win.|$|E

5|$|The goal of {{each level}} {{is to protect}} Baby Mario, who rides on Yoshi's back. If Yoshi is hit by an enemy or obstacle, Baby Mario will float off into a bubble and a timer will start {{counting}} down. If the player fails to recover Baby Mario before the counter reaches zero, Baby Mario will be taken away by Koopas and Yoshi will lose a life. The timer can recover up to ten seconds, and Yoshi can collect stars {{to increase the amount}} of time on the counter. However, if Yoshi falls into a bottomless pit, gets crushed, or comes into contact with spikes or lava, he <b>will</b> <b>automatically</b> lose a life. In some areas, players can collect a Starman that transforms Baby Mario into Super Baby Mario. During these areas, players take control of Baby Mario who, for a short period, is invincible, can run on walls and ceilings, and can float using his cape. Additionally, some areas transform Yoshi into various vehicles, such as a helicopter or digger, allowing him to reach otherwise inaccessible areas for a short amount of time.|$|E
5|$|The promotional {{phase of}} the {{gameplay}} mainly deals with the idol conversing with various other characters and doing events, {{some of which are}} necessary to progress the game. There are also times when the player is given choices that directly affect the idol. Over the course of a conversation, text progression pauses when the player is given multiple responses to choose from. Depending on which choice is made will effect how well or poorly the communication is received, which results in either bad, normal or good memories. A bad memory will decrease an idol's enthusiasm, which is displayed at certain points throughout gameplay by a horizontal bar in the top-left of the lower screen. An idol's enthusiasm ranges from blue to yellow and finally to red as enthusiasm increases. A normal memory will reward the player with a heart point, used later during auditions. A good memory will reward the player with two heart points and increased enthusiasm. If the player chooses to take the day off, an idol's enthusiasm <b>will</b> <b>automatically</b> increase. Days off also give the idol the chance to either stay at home, or go out into town and meet with other characters. The player can check on days off if there are any presents fans have sent the idols, which contain in-game items.|$|E
