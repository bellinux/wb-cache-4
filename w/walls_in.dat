5|$|After the Battle of Edington in 878, Alfred {{established}} {{a network of}} fortified settlements, called burhs, in Wessex to protect his people and territory against Viking attacks, and when Æthelred accepted Alfred's lordship the burhs were extended into Mercia. One of the burhs was Worcester, where Æthelred worked with its bishop and used the standing Roman <b>walls</b> <b>in</b> the town's defences. Over the next two generations Worcester was transformed from an ecclesiastical settlement to a town with a diverse population of craftsmen.|$|E

5|$|By the 17th century, {{coastal erosion}} had {{undermined}} the castle's <b>walls.</b> <b>In</b> 1627, Charles I {{announced that he}} would repair the fortification but instead the ruins were dismantled in 1631 by Sir John Oglander. A new fortification, Sandown Fort was built in its place, positioned further inland, but the possible remains of the foundations of the original castle are still visible along the shore at low tide.|$|E
5|$|In 359, Julian {{restored}} seven forts {{and town}} <b>walls</b> <b>in</b> the middle Rhine, including Bonna (Bonn) and Bingium (Bingen), obliging his new tributary Alamanni {{to provide the}} supplies and labour needed. He then crossed the Rhine, marched through {{the territory of the}} tributaries and devastated the lands of the other kings who had fought at Strasbourg, including Westralp. All were forced to submit and return the thousands of Roman civilians they had abducted and enslaved during the years of easy plunder.|$|E

5|$|On August 29th 2005, flood {{walls and}} levees catastrophically failed {{throughout}} the metro area. Many collapsed well below design thresholds (17th Street and London Canals). Others collapsed {{after a brief}} period of overtopping (Industrial Canal) caused “scouring” or erosion of the earthen levee <b>walls.</b> <b>In</b> eastern New Orleans, levees along the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway failed in several places because they were built with sand and erodible materials instead of clay, an obvious construction flaw.|$|E
5|$|Seeds {{and fruit}} form the major {{component}} of the diets of pigeons and doves. In fact, the family {{can be divided into}} the seed-eating or granivorous species (subfamily Columbinae) and the fruit-and-mast-eating or frugivorous species (the other four subfamilies). The granivorous species typically feed on seed found on the ground, whereas the frugivorous species tend to feed in trees. There are morphological adaptations {{that can be used to}} distinguish between the two groups: granivores tend to have thick <b>walls</b> <b>in</b> their gizzards, intestines, and esophagi whereas the frugivores tend to have thin <b>walls.</b> <b>In</b> addition, fruit-eating species have short intestines whereas those that eat seeds have longer ones. Frugivores are capable of clinging to branches and even hang upside down to reach fruit.|$|E
5|$|Sheila's {{mental health}} {{continued}} to decline, with episodes of banging {{her head against}} <b>walls.</b> <b>In</b> 1983, her family doctor referred her to Dr. Hugh Ferguson, the psychiatrist who had treated June.

She was admitted to St Andrew's Hospital, a private psychiatric facility in Northampton, where {{she was diagnosed with}} schizoaffective disorder, although Ferguson said this diagnosis was a mistake and that she was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia.|$|E

5|$|St. Illtyd's church predates the Age of the Saints {{in early}} Welsh Christianity and thus {{by its very}} {{existence}} provides evidence of continuity with sub-Roman Christianity. The churchyard contains three ancient relics, a pillar and two inscribed stones; one dates from Saint Samson's time. The grounds also include a 13th-century gatehouse, a monks' pigeon-house, ruined <b>walls</b> <b>in</b> a garden area, and mounds near the vicarage.|$|E

5|$|The common {{element to}} both church and palazzi {{interior}} design was the stucco work. Stucco {{is an important}} component of the Baroque design and philosophy, as it seamlessly combines architecture, sculpture, and painting in three-dimensional form. Its combination with trompe l'oeil ceilings and <b>walls</b> <b>in</b> Baroque illusionistic painting confuses reality and art. While in churches the stucco could represent angels and putti linked by swags of flowers, in a private house it might represent the owner's favourite foods or musical instruments.|$|E

5|$|The {{deterioration}} of the Ming military position in the steppe transitional zone gave rise to nomadic raids into Ming territory, including the crucial Ordos region, on a level unprecedented since the dynasty's founding.

5|$|The dining room, on {{the other}} hand, saw {{extensive}} remodeling in 1895. The room size was increased by {{the construction of a}} bay window, parquet floor was installed, and the room was decorated in cherry woodwork, with a gilt and crystal chandelier and sconces. The only original item remaining left in the room was the fireplace mantel. The Pink Room, named for the pink damask which covered the <b>walls</b> <b>in</b> 1895, the library, the Best Chamber (Daisy Grubb's bedroom), was also extensively remodeled.|$|E

5|$|Though major {{locations}} held up {{well against}} the earthquake, most villages did not. From Qeshm Island came reports of power outage and minor damage; 100 houses {{in all of}} Qeshm were damaged between 30 and 50 percent.

5|$|Warcraft {{requires}} {{players to}} collect resources, and to produce buildings and units {{in order to}} defeat an opponent in combat. Non-combatant builders deliver the resources to the Town Center from mines, from which gold is dug, and forests, where wood is chopped. As both are limited resources which become exhausted during the game, players must collect them efficiently, and also retain forests as defensive <b>walls</b> <b>in</b> the early game when combat forces are small.|$|E
5|$|A {{distinct}} feature {{noted in}} the entire temple complex is the stucco style embellishments built with brick masonry and finished with plaster. The motifs crafted are of floral (lotuses) and geometric designs, on the <b>walls,</b> <b>in</b> the niches and on arches. Apart from paintings on the walls, the niches in the interior parts of the shrines have 300 well crafted images of deities. The profusion of paintings and images on {{the internal and external}} faces of the temple was considered an auspicious feature, instead of leaving the wall surfaces blank. However, the images and murals on the outer walls of the temple have since been demolished.|$|E
