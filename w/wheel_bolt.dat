5000|$|Other {{changes were}} {{in store for}} the Plymouth Duster. Simpler single-piston slider-type disc brake {{calipers}} were introduced for 1973 (standard on 318-powered cars and with power-assist on 340 models), replacing the Kelsey Hayes four-piston calipers. Disc brake-equipped Dusters now had the more-common 5-lugs on 4.5" [...] <b>wheel</b> <b>bolt</b> pattern. All 340 and some 318 engine-equipped cars received the simplified 8.25" [...] rear axle assembly (with wheel bearings riding directly on the axle shaft and endplay being taken by C-clips); these axles also featured the 5-on-4.5" [...] <b>wheel</b> <b>bolt</b> pattern. (This axle assembly replaced the 8.75" [...] "drop-out" [...] arrangement seen on some 1966-1972 A-bodies). The 225-powered cars retained the 5-lugs on 4" [...] pattern on vehicles with the standard drum brakes. A three speed Torque Flight automatic along with a manual transmission was offered with the 225 slant six. All models received larger front wheel bearings and increased spindle diameter. Electronic ignition became standard across the board.|$|E

The corpse was taken to the Swann Inn, Pendlebury where an inquest was held. A juror {{recognised}} the body as that of Harry Stokes, advising that he was [...] "not a man but a woman". Harry’s body was inspected by two women who confirmed it was that of a woman.|$|E
5000|$|Axles were Dana 44 {{front and}} 9¼" [...] or 8 1/4" [...] Chrysler {{corporate}} rear. AWD models (1973-1979) were {{equipped with the}} full-time version of the Dana 44 that had no provision for locking hubs and had a front wheel bearing design with a somewhat dubious reputation. In 1980 when the part-time 4WD system was introduced, the front Dana 44 was equipped with a more conventional front wheel bearing design and automatic locking hubs. Late in the 1984 model year the Dana 44 was switched to a CAD (Center Axle Disconnect) version. The CAD Dana 44 was vacuum actuated by a switch on the transfer case and powered by engine vacuum. The CAD Dana 44 was carried on {{until the end of}} Ramcharger production in 1993. The vacuum switch on the transfer case would occasionally fail and either leave the CAD engaged or not engage the CAD at all. Limited slip differentials were available for the 9¼" [...] rear axle. The AWD versions used a 5 on 4½" [...] <b>wheel</b> <b>bolt</b> circle and the part-time 4WD models used a 5 on 5½" [...] bolt circle. Two wheel drive models used the 5 on 4.5" [...] <b>wheel</b> <b>bolt</b> circle and in 1985 changed to the 5 on 5.5" [...] pattern.|$|E

50|$|The BMW M3 {{utilised}} a widened {{and heavily}} redesigned {{variation of the}} coupe body style, therefore the M3 shares few body parts with other E30 models. The M3 suspension is also significantly different from regular E30 models, including 5 lug <b>wheel</b> <b>bolts.</b>|$|R
50|$|An MSO (McLaren Special Operations) {{version of}} the 650S is offered in a limited {{production}} run of 50 vehicles. Offered with matte carbon, exclusive MSO colours, Papaya Spark, Agrigan Black and Sarigan Quartz. It features unique and lightweight alloy wheels. These are 4 kg lighter than the standard alloys, helped {{by the fact that}} titanium <b>wheel</b> <b>bolts</b> are used.|$|R
50|$|The E30 M3 {{differed}} from the standard E30 by having a 5x120 <b>wheel</b> <b>bolt</b> pattern. The E30 M3 had increased caster angle through major front suspension changes. The M3 had specific solid rubber offset control arm bushings. It used aluminium control arms and the front strut tubes were changed to a design similar (bolt on kingpins and swaybar mounted to strut tube) to the E28 5-series. This included carrying over the 5 series front wheel bearings and brake caliper bolt spacing. The rear suspension was a carry over from the E30.|$|E
5000|$|... 2007: Both engines were retuned {{for more}} power while {{retaining}} the same fuel economy. The 2.2 L Ecotec was now rated at [...] with the 2.4 L Ecotec rated at [...] Other changes include a new console, new {{steering wheel and}} new radio head unit that features an audio input jack. In addition, all models except the LS and LT1 now used a 5x110 <b>wheel</b> <b>bolt</b> pattern. The LS and LT1 retained the standard 4x100. In addition, the 2007 model year marked {{the introduction of a}} new 32-bit computer that replaced the 16-bit unit from 2006.|$|E
5000|$|In 1990, Chevrolet {{introduced}} a high-performance {{variant of the}} GMT400 under the Super Sport emblem called the 454SS. It was available only as a 2WD half-ton regular cab short box in Onyx Black only with a garnet red interior. The 454SS was powered by a 454 cuin L V8 producing [...] and 385 lbft Nm. A 3-speed automatic transmission (Turbo Hydra-Matic 400) and 3.73 rear axle ratio added to the truck's performance. The axle itself is unique, being a 14-bolt semi-floating unit which uses standard Chevrolet 5 on 5-inch wheels—the only factory-produced 14-bolt axle with such a <b>wheel</b> <b>bolt</b> pattern. The suspension was also upgraded with 32 mm Bilstein gas-filled shock absorbers, a 32 mm front stabilizer bar, and 12.7:1 fast-ratio steering gear assembly.|$|E
50|$|The primary {{advantage}} of wheel studs over <b>wheel</b> <b>bolts</b> is greater ease for tire changes by creating {{the ability to}} lift both the wheel and tire onto the studs creating the ability to hold and locate the assembly during tire changes {{rather than trying to}} hold up the wheel and tire while lining up the holes to insert a <b>bolt.</b> Many <b>wheels</b> that use <b>bolts</b> also have one or more small locator pins to assist this: the wheel is lifted onto the pins, then the bolts inserted. Once the bolts are tightened and the wheel is fully installed, the pins have no further function whilst the vehicle is being driven.|$|R
50|$|To restart, {{the driver}} simply takes his {{foot off the}} brake and presses the accelerator. In ECO mode, the clutch was {{disengaged}} when the accelerator pedal was released for maximum economy, so the car freewheels as much as possible, with the clutch re-engaging {{as soon as the}} accelerator pedal or brake pedal is touched. The 3L also has only four <b>wheel</b> <b>bolts</b> and alloy brake drums at the rear, along with many aluminium suspension components.|$|R
5000|$|Two-wheeled skates: {{there are}} also other lesser seen two-wheeled skate arrangements. Some {{resemble}} inline skates but with 2 very large <b>wheels</b> <b>bolted</b> in at an angle from the outside rather than a center-balanced row of 4 smaller wheels underneath of inline skates. Others resemble freeline skates in {{that they have a}} small squarish platform, but with 2 medium-sized wheels on either side, somewhat between a freeline skate and roller skates (but with inline-skate-styled wheels).|$|R
5000|$|The {{redesigned}} WJ 1999 Grand Cherokee shared just 127 {{parts with}} its predecessor (mostly fasteners). The spare tire was relocated {{from the side}} of the cargo compartment to under the floor. The two heavy pushrod V8 engines were replaced by Chrysler's then-new PowerTech. New V8 engine produced less torque than the old pushrods, but was lighter, offered better fuel economy, and provided similar on road performance figures (the 23-gallon fuel tank was replaced with one of a 20.5-gallon capacity). The Inline 6 engine was also updated in 1999. A redesign of the intake manifold added [...] While other Jeep vehicles used the Mopar 5 x 4.5 bolt circle, this was the first Jeep following the 1987 Chrysler buyout to receive a wider <b>wheel</b> <b>bolt</b> pattern: - 5 x 5 - (metric 5 x 127mm). Models include 1999-2009 Grand Cherokee, 2006-2009 Grand Cherokee SRT-8, WK 2005 - 2010, WK2 2011 - 2016.|$|E
5000|$|Chrysler's new {{electronic}} ignition system was standard equipment on all engines, and starter motors were revised for faster engine cranking. The K-frame was modified {{to accommodate a}} new spool-type engine mount that limited engine roll to 3°. The upper ball joints were upgraded to the larger B-body units. Along with these chassis changes, the <b>wheel</b> <b>bolt</b> pattern on Darts with disc brakes was enlarged from 4 in to the 4.5 in pattern common to the larger B- and C-body Chrysler-built passenger cars. Darts with 4-wheel drum brakes continued with the smaller bolt pattern. The standard rear axle was still the 7¼" [...] unit, but the heavy-duty option was now an 8¼" [...] item rather than the previous 8¾" [...] rear axle. Standard rear axle ratios were 2.76:1 with automatic transmission and 3.23:1 with manual, though other ratios were available. Vent wings were deleted from the Swinger but not from the 4-door sedans. A new [...] "Quiet Car" [...] package was available, consisting of extra sound insulation, premium exhaust hangers and an exhaust resonator.|$|E
5000|$|The KB Centuras {{sold and}} {{assembled}} in Australia {{not only had}} a 1,981 cc version of the 4-cylinder Simca engine but were also available with Australian-made 6-cylinder pushrod 3,523/4,014 cc hemi engines and BorgWarner 3-speed automatic and 3- or 4-speed manual gearboxes. The four offered 122 hp (SAE), the sixes 142/167 hp (SAE) respectively. The KB series was sold in XL and GL trims, the latter having more equipment, including tachometer, clock, low fuel light (rare for 1975), rear bumper overriders, console (no storage) and optional vinyl roofs. There were no rear demister fitted, although a Smiths unit was fitted by some dealers. The KB model's European pedigree was obvious, with instrumentation in the opposite order and steering column controls on opposite sides. All KB GL spec cars came equipped with a tachometer, however it was optional on XL spec cars (whereas later KC cars only gained a tachometer through special order, {{or as part of}} the Sports option package) Interior flow ventilation was improved over the larger Valiant models, as the Centura had two face-level ventilation outlets. Although the A55 6 cylinder Centura Sports Package was fitted to some vehicles ( [...] included body stripes, styled wheels, woodgrain instrument cluster with tachometer, clock and Boca Raton cloth trim), it was common to see dealer fitted options including the styled road wheel option, and stencilled side stripes and bonnet black outs. The sixes also came with larger brakes (60 mm ventilated front discs and 25.4 mm rear finned drums) and a tandem brake reservoir. The six-cylinder Hemi cars used a 5-stud <b>wheel</b> <b>bolt</b> pattern, and the early 4-cylinder cars used a 4-stud <b>wheel</b> <b>bolt</b> pattern and only featured solid unventilated brake discs. Later 4-cylinder cars shared the same brakes and stud pattern as the 6 cylinder cars, and thus the same wheels. All Centura models were factory fitted with rack-and-pinion steering, however there was no power steering option. Steering could be heavy, so correct tyre fitment and pressures were a must. Factory / dealer fitted air, with the unit located below the heater controls was available but seldom optioned. Very few Centura's left the dealership with e33 engine code although a few examples do exist. One owned by a previous valiant production worker who ordered the option from new, it is now a sought after collectors item.|$|E

50|$|Early Sevilles {{produced}} between April 1975 (a {{total of}} 16,355) to {{the close of}} the 1976 model year were the first Cadillacs to use the smaller GM <b>wheel</b> <b>bolt</b> pattern (5 lugs with a 4.75 in bolt circle; the 2003-2009 XLR also uses this pattern). The first Sevilles shared only a strict minority of components with the engineering starting point, the GM X-Body. The rear drums measured 11 in and were similar to the ones used with the Nova 9C1 (police option) and A-body (Chevelle, Cutlass, Regal, LeMans) intermediate station wagons. Starting with the 1977 model year, production Sevilles used the larger 5 lug — 5 inch bolt circle common to full-size Chevrolet passenger cars (1971-76), Cadillacs, Buicks, Oldsmobiles, Pontiacs, and 1/2 ton Chevrolet/GMC light trucks and vans. It also received rear disc brakes, a design which would surface a year later as an option on the F-body Pontiac Trans Am. 1975-76 models had a mandatory vinyl top {{due to the fact that}} the roof section was originally tooled up in two parts; the rear section around the C-pillar was pressed especially for Cadillac, and a regular X-body sedan roof pressing was used for the forward parts. Due to customer demand, a painted steel roof was offered beginning in 1977, which required a new full roof stamping. 1977 Seville production increased slightly to 45,060 vehicles. The following year, production increased to 56,985 cars and ended up being the peak production year for the first generation Seville.|$|E
5000|$|The {{rear-wheel drive}} K {{platform}} was based closely {{on the very}} similar 4th generation GM X platform, and 2nd generation F-bodies of the 1970s, all of which shared many components (control arms, springs, steering linkage and associated steering gear) in common. The K platform stretched the X platform to 114.3 inch wheelbase, but also improved isolation from sources of structure borne vibration in the drivetrain and suspension. While automobiles built on these three platforms had different bodies, they shared the same unibody construction technology using a separable elastomer isolated front subframe assembly, a design which first appeared in GM vehicles on the 1st generation X platform in 1962 on the Chevy II. Automobiles built on these three platforms (F, K, and X) also shared front and rear suspension systems, with tunings engineered to each application. The front suspensions used unequal length A-arms, coil springs damped with tubular hydraulic shock absorbers, ball joints, elastomer bushings, and recirculating ball steering boxes differing in ratios that were specific to the application. The rear suspension design used a live axle (solid axle - which was a GM corporate 10 bolt differential with an 8.5" [...] ring gear) located by leaf springs (shared with the 1968-74 and 1975-79 X platform) damped with tubular hydraulic shock absorbers. Rear disc brakes were standard equipment in 1977 - this design later ended up with some 1979-81 Pontiac Trans Ams with the WS6 option. At {{the same time the}} rear disc brakes were made standard equipment the front brakes received a modified steering knuckle which used a 12-inch disc brake rotor (shared with the GM B platform station wagons and C/D platform except limousines and commercial chassis) - the <b>wheel</b> <b>bolt</b> pattern was changed from the GM 5 x 4.75 (used with Chevrolets and lower end BOP automobiles) to the 5 on 5 bolt pattern used {{with the rest of the}} Cadillac RWD lineup (also with higher end BOP automobiles and Chevrolet/GMC 1/2 ton light duty trucks, vans, and SUVs).|$|E

5000|$|In the UK, some {{semi-trailer}} trucks {{have eight}} tires on three axles on the tractor; these {{are known as}} six-wheelers or [...] "six leggers", with either the center or rear axle having single wheels which normally steer {{as well as the}} front axle and can be raised when not needed (i.e. when unloaded or only a light load is being carried; an arrangement known as a TAG axle when it is the rear axle, or mid-lift when it is the center axle). Some trailers have two axles which have twin tires on each axle; other trailers have three axles, of which one axle can be a lift axle which has super-single wheels. In the UK, two <b>wheels</b> <b>bolted</b> to the same hub are classed as a single wheel, therefore a standard six-axle articulated truck is considered to have twelve wheels, even though it has twenty tires. The UK also allows semi-trailer truck which have six tires on two axles; these are known as four-wheelers.|$|R
40|$|Due to a need of {{more compact}} bogies, the brake discs can be {{mounted on the}} railway <b>wheels,</b> <b>bolted</b> through the <b>wheel</b> web. Thus, the wheels are drilled and have {{multiple}} areas of contact with the brake discs.

40|$|Early {{failures}} {{occurred with}} two sizes of wheel bolts used for attaching front wheels and dual rear wheels to heavy truck hubs. Failure resulted in fracture of the bolts, {{and was a}} response to the material and process specification which produced a steel microstructure highly susceptible to hydrogen-assisted stress cracking. The microstructure resulted from an alloy steel that was carburized, heat treated, and then zinc plated. This combination of material and processing produced a high-strength SAE Grade 8 bolt (equivalent to an ISO 10. 9 grade) with a hard, brittle case and an anodic zinc coating. A slight misalignment of the <b>wheel</b> <b>bolt</b> coupled with a ball seat mounting design for the wheel nuts created a combined axial and bending stress that exceeded the threshold for hydrogen-assisted stress cracking...|$|E
40|$|The {{automotive}} component {{manufacturing sector}} is experiencing fierce competitions. To enable improvements in production efficiency, the authors introduced single step injection forging {{as an alternative}} to conventional multisteps forging processes for manufacturing automobile fasteners, being enabled by a dedicated tool-design to achieve combined material-flows and hence, a complex component-form. To assist in this, a feasibility study was conducted, including comparisons of conventional multisteps forging with injection forging, through FE simulations, experimental validation of the injection forging process, as well as detailed examinations {{of the quality of the}} parts formed. The simulations were focused mainly on the forming of a <b>wheel</b> <b>bolt.</b> Axi-symmetric models were developed to analyse forging force and energy requirements, resulting forming-errors and tool stresses for each process. Injection forging tests were carried out in a factory environment with the aim of verifying the FE results and of confirming process and tool-design feasibility. Based on the results from these studies, the feasibility of replacing multisteps forging with injection forging was confirmed. It was established that injection forging may demand higher a forming force in its single step but it would consume less energy. Also, there is less chance of developing flow faults during injection forging, which is critical for the forming of the automotive fasteners. Nevertheless, due to the complex material-flow in injection forging and large die-deflections, a dedicated tool-design for compensating for forming-errors and for enhancing tool-life has to be enabled for the forging production applications...|$|E

40|$|With {{the goal}} of {{understanding}} how to mitigate the safety hazard of splash and spray around heavy vehicles, a computational study of the aerodynamics and spray dispersion about a simplified trailer wheel assembly has been completed. A tandem dual slick (TDS) wheel model that neglects complex geometric features such as brakes, <b>wheel</b> <b>bolts</b> and <b>wheel</b> cutouts but with the same dimensions as an actual trailer wheel assembly was used. A detailed simulation of the wheels alone demonstrated that the flow field is both unsteady and complex, containing a number of vortical structures that interact strongly with spray. Preliminary simulations with fenders and fairings demonstrated that these devices prevent the ballistic transport of drops larger than approximately 0. 1 mm, but the fine mist speculated {{to be responsible for}} visibility reduction is unaffected. This work suggests that to use computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to design and evaluate spray mitigation strategies the jet or sheet breakup processes can be modeled using an array of injectors of small (< 0. 01 mm) water droplets; however the choice of size distribution, injection locations, directions and velocities is largely unknown and requires further study.

50|$|Multi-jackbolt {{tensioners}} {{are used}} in several hydro applications, including turbine couplings, blade <b>bolts,</b> turbine <b>wheel</b> to shaft <b>bolting,</b> pelton turbine nozzles, servo piston nuts, bearing housings, and ball valves. Multi-jackbolt expansion bolts provide additional benefit for shaft couplings, because they generate both radial and axial forces, creating the interference fit necessary. MJTs can also easily achieve the high preloads required on Kaplan turbine crossheads and servo piston rods.|$|R
5000|$|Large 28", 700 B or 700 C {{wheels are}} typical, {{providing}} a smoother ride than 26" [...] wheels. On traditional Dutch city bikes, extremely thick spokes add carrying strength. To discourage theft, {{the front and}} back <b>wheels</b> use axle <b>bolts</b> instead of quick-releases. European city bikes are used in bike-friendly areas for short distances with sturdy tires. These features are suited to riding without tools or quick-release wheels.|$|R
