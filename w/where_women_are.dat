She received criticism for not covering her head in a nation <b>where</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> forbidden from publicly not doing so, though Obama was defended for being a foreigner and thus not having to submit to Saudi Arabia's customs, even being praised in some corners. Obama was neither greeted nor acknowledged by King Salman during the encounter.|$|E
5|$|The {{plots of}} the unmade serials also vary. A theme of a {{civilisation}} <b>where</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> dominant was proposed twice—once for The Hidden Planet, and again for The Prison in Space. In some cases, elements of unmade serials were adapted, or were {{moved from one}} serial to another; for example, Song of the Space Whale {{was intended to be}} the introduction of Vislor Turlough until it was repeatedly set back, causing Mawdryn Undead to be Turlough's first appearance.|$|E
5|$|Women have {{traditionally}} been disadvantaged {{in terms of economic}} and social status and power, which in turn reduces their access to the necessities of life including health care. Despite recent improvements in western nations, women remain disadvantaged with respect to men. The gender gap in health is even more acute in developing countries <b>where</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> relatively more disadvantaged. In addition to gender inequity, there remain specific disease processes uniquely associated with being a woman which create specific challenges in both prevention and health care.|$|E

25|$|Violence {{against women}} is a {{widespread}} global occurrence with serious public health implications. This {{is a result of}} social and gender bias. Many societies in developing nations function on a patriarchal framework, <b>where</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> often viewed as a form of property and as socially inferior to men. This unequal standing in the social hierarchy has led women to be physically, emotionally, and sexually abused by men, both as children and adults. These abuses usually constitute some form of violence. Although children of both sexes do suffer from physical maltreatment, sexual abuse, and other forms of exploitation and violence, studies have indicated that young girls are far more likely than boys to experience sexual abuse. In a 2004 study on child abuse, 25.3% of all girls surveyed experienced some form of sexual abuse, a percentage that is three times higher than that of boys (8.7%).|$|E
25|$|In 2000 Googoosh sang in public, {{away from}} her homeland, {{for the first time}} after 21 years of silence. The Googoosh Comeback Tour was a series of concerts {{starting}} in July 2000. Having previously left Iran, <b>where</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> forbidden to perform, amidst spectacular media attention, she began with a sold out concert at the Air Canada Centre in Toronto on 29 July 2000 and eventually brought the tour to a conclusion in Dubai on 21 and 24 March 2001 {{on the occasion of the}} Iranian New Year, Nowruz. Her concert in Dubai was considered a homecoming for her and thousands of Iranians crossed the Persian Gulf to hear her. The two Dubai concerts held special importance: it was the tour finale, and Googoosh was rumored to be planning to return to Iran. Therefore, many people believed it might be their last chance to see her. She later claimed that she felt like singing at home. As seen below, the concerts were aimed at cities with large concentrations of Iranian immigrants.|$|E
25|$|On {{the evening}} of 17 July 2008, a woman was {{approached}} by Ghazni Province police officers {{in the city of}} Ghazni outside the Ghazni governor's compound. She was holding two small bags at her side while crouching on the ground. This aroused the officer's suspicion, raising concerns that she might be concealing a bomb under her burqa. Previously, a shopkeeper had noticed a woman in a burqa drawing a map, which is suspicious in Afghanistan <b>where</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> generally illiterate. There had also been a report that a Pakistani woman in a burqa with a boy were traveling in Afghanistan urging women to volunteer for suicide bombing. She was accompanied by a young boy that she said was her adopted son. She said her name was Saliha, that she was from Multan in Pakistan, and that the boy's name was Ali Hassan. Discovering that she did not speak either of Afghanistan's main languages, Pashtu or Dari, the officers regarded her as suspicious. She told the police she was looking for her husband, needed no help, and started to walk away. She was arrested and taken to the police station for questioning. She initially claimed the boy was her stepson, Ali Hassan. (The woman was not identified as Siddiqui until after hospitalized and fingerprinted. She subsequently admitted he was her biological son when DNA testing proved the boy to be Ahmed.|$|E

25|$|Feminism in Mexico {{is often}} divided {{chronologically}} into peak periods followed by lulls: the Revolutionary period (1915-1925), the Second Wave (1968-1990, peaking in 1975-1985), and the post-1990 period. While feminism {{may be defined}} as a set of organized philosophy and activity aimed at creating, defining, and protecting political, economic, cultural, and social equality in women’s rights and opportunity, Marta Lamas and other feminists caution that the women's movement in Mexico can not be equated with the feminist movement. Lamas, a leading Mexican feminist, laments that the Mexican feminist movement has always been weak and has struggled in the modern era to move beyond Mexico City's middle class to working-class and rural women. In the Revolutionary period where a broader spectrum of women from throughout Mexico were seeking suffrage, the movement lacked sophistication and focus, evident in the fact that Mexican women did not gain the vote until 1953. Women's equality demands, per Lamas, stem from a situation <b>where</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> juggling between household commitments and underpaid jobs. As most Mexican women in the upper and middle classes are provided with domestic help, women are more accepting of traditional gender roles. For many Mexican women, assisting other women through benevolent organizations and charitable works is in-line with their traditional view of womanhood, whereas a radical approach might meet with disdain or even violence.|$|E

500|$|Atwell, who portrayed Carter in , , and the Agent Carter short film, {{expressed}} interest in reprising the role for the series in October 2013; ABC Entertainment president Paul Lee confirmed her involvement in January 2014. Carter is the first female character to headline a standalone story {{as part of the}} Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), ahead of popular comic characters such as Black Widow and Captain Marvel. Unlike other major Marvel heroes, Carter does not have any superpowers, instead the writers [...] "always said her superpower is the fact that other people underestimate her. And she often uses that to her advantage, because she doesn’t have superstrength." [...] Atwell said it was [...] "thrilling" [...] to explore [...] "the backdrop of this male-dominated world, <b>where</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> still in the workforce, unspoken for and struggling to find a place outside the home" [...] and how it affects Carter, who must deal with this along with the missions she receives. For Carter's costumes, though some vintage pieces were used, most of her outfits were custom made to accommodate the scripted action scenes. Costume designer Giovanna Ottobre-Melton gave the outfits an [...] "hourglass style with strength in the tailoring and defined shoulders, but not overly exaggerated." [...] For the character's tactical gear, World War II underground military looks were referenced. Gabriella Graves portrays a young Carter.|$|E
