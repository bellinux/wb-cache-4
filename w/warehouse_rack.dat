40|$|Abstract: In a {{traditional}} unit-load <b>warehouse,</b> <b>racks</b> {{are arranged to}} create parallel picking aisles, perhaps {{with one or more}} orthogonal cross aisles to reduce travel dis-tances for order pickers. We have argued that these de-signs are based on a number of unspoken assumptions, and that by relaxing them we can create warehouses with significantly improved performance. To illustrate, we have introduced warehouse designs with two innovations: diagonal cross aisles and picking aisles having different orientations. One of our designs promises to improve productivity by approximately 20 percent for warehouses of reasonable size. In this paper we also present details associated with the application of these new aisle designs and our on-going work on this topic. 1. The Traditional Unit-Load Warehouse: Unit-loa...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a new test to determine flexibility of beam-to-column connectors used in conventional pallet racking systems. In this study, {{two different ways}} were used to find the flexibility of a connector. The connector developed was tested using the conventional cantilever method [Bajoria, KM. Three dimensional progressive collapse of <b>warehouse</b> <b>racking,</b> PhD Thesis, University of Cambridge, UK 1986], and then also using a newly proposed double cantilever method. To verify the results obtained from both the tests, a full scale frame test was carried out. In the double cantilever test the connector is subjected to three types of forces namely moment, shear and the axial pull by the beams, thereby giving behavior close to practical usage of connectors. Non-linear finite element analysis of both the tests and also of the full scale test were carried out using ANSYS [ANSYS 7. 0 —User's Manual, ANSYS Inc., 2005] software. The results obtained from the double cantilever test were found to match well with the full scale frame test.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} Bachelor's thesis titled Evaluation of Fire Safety of <b>Rack</b> <b>Warehouses</b> in Region Vysočina is to {{evaluate}} the protection of <b>rack</b> <b>warehouses</b> in region Vysočina, compare the existing situation with legislation and technical regulations, and draft measures for successful suppression of fire in a <b>rack</b> <b>warehouse</b> for a firefighting crew commander. The thesis {{is divided into two}} main parts, the theoretical part and the effective part. This thesis also contains another part, where there were outlined two research questions and introduced the research methodology, which describes the procedure of obtaining results. In the theoretical part, there is a brief outline of the history of storage and its development. There are also explained main terms related to warehouses and storage, and there is also mentioned the basic division of warehouses. Furthermore, there is also described the burning process, course of fire and its particular stages. Last chapters of the theoretical part are dedicated to fire safety and applicable regulations, description and function of fire safety equipment, that are installed in warehouses chosen for assessment. Warehouses assessed in this work were selected intentionally and according to predetermined criteria, like for example rack storage of material, area, height and installed fire safety protection equipment. In this thesis, there can be found elaboration of the assessment of five <b>rack</b> <b>warehouses</b> in region Vysočina, which meet the conditions mentioned above, and which also provided detailed information. Results of this research are divided into two parts, when each part brought an answer to one important question. In the first part, there are stated results of guided interviews with professionals in the field of warehouse design, which provided answers to one of the research questions, and that was whether <b>rack</b> <b>warehouses</b> in region Vysočina were protected against occurance of fire in accordance with valid legislation and technical regulations. This comparison simultaneously represented one of the aims of this thesis. After the evaluation of obtained information, we can say that the researched warehouses are protected against the occurance of fire with the sufficient and appropriate means, and we can even consider some fire safety elements to be oversized. While processing guided interviews with commanders and chiefs of the squads located at firefighting brigade stations in region Vysočina, it was possible to answer the second research question outlined in the resulting effective part of this Bachelor's thesis. According to the results of the research, the firefighting brigade chiefs do not have enough information from warehouse owners to fight the fire successfully. From 24 interviewed crew commanders and chiefs, 15 consider provided information insufficient. As a complication while fighting the fire, they mention confusing state of operational cards, and also the fact the the information stated in these cards are not adjusted regularly. In the case of fire emergency, in a very short time, the firefighting brigade has to orientate in a large amount of information that are not stated in the operational card. This card is very voluminous and becomes confusing. While firefighting, the presence of the contact person is always important. On the basis of all information obtained during guided interviews with crew commanders and chiefs, there was created a methodological tool, so one of the objectives of this thesis, to help the crew commanders to make firefighting easier, was fulfilled. This tool will be offered to complete the firefighting documentation for the fire brigade stations in the region that cooperated during the process of obtaining data for this Bachelor's thesis.

In this thesis it is shown, how this safety requirement led to bilevel OCPs and their numerical solution. Bilevel OCPs are an extension of classical OCPs. Hereby, for the optimization of a control variable of the primary problem, an additional constraint has to be considered, which depends on the optimal solution of a secondary OCP.

Consequently, enhanced fire growth and heat transfer, coupled with inadequate water spray distribution caused by the excessive storage heights, resulted in uncontrollable fire spread, and subsequent total destruction of the site. To evaluate and demonstrate the capability of the in-place sprinkler system to protect the structure and contents for the mandate storage height, a study was conducted to compare heat transfer conditions in the area above the racks for the design storage height, and for the actual storage height reported prior to the fire. The study involved experimental determination of fire growth and mass loss rate dynamics for parallel panels of heavy grade cardboard, simulating stacked boxes.

There are many factors affects the storage assignment. For example, order picking method, size and layout of the storage system, material handling system, product characteristics, demand trends, turnover rates and space requirements. Selecting appropriate storage assignment policies (i. e. random, dedicated or class-based) and routing methods (i. e. transversal, return or combined) with regards to above factors is a possible solution to tackle this problem. However, the efficiency of these policies is interdependent. This paper aims to present a simulation study of a real case regarding storage assignment problem of a manual-pick and multi-level <b>rack</b> <b>warehouse.</b> Performance of the case is measured in terms of travel distance and order retrieval time.

40|$|The {{object of}} the {{investigation}} is a rack stacker-crane (RSC) attending a rack section storing {{a wide range of}} cargoes. The purpose is to determine how the cargoes should be arranged in rack in order to increase the capacity of the stacker-crane. The carried out analysis of the duration of the working cycle phases of the RSC has revealed that a considerable portion of the operation of the RSC is spent on the motion between the areas of storing the cargoes of various types. A principle of forming zones for storing the cargoes of various kinds has been suggested to permit decreasing the distance between the above storage zones. A comparative analysis of the known methods of solving the zoning problem has been made, and a new zoning problem solution method considering the peculiar features of a volume-planning solution of the storage section, the speed characteristics of the RSC and the frequency characteristics of the cargoes has been suggested, the method being 10 to 15 % more efficient than the known methods. A system of criteria used for estimating the operating capacity of the RSC has been proposed. A required minimum of data required for the rack-RSC model has been revealed, and information structures completely describing all the components of the modeled system have been created.

Outside the building, heat fluxes were measured at a total of 20 locations in front of the building and on the two sides. The heat flux metres were located at different distances from the building and different heights. Videos were recorded from 4 cameras around the building and an infrared camera. The images allowed to time events such as the appearance and propagation of smoke, the collapse of the roof and stacks and to determine the shape and size of the flames. The fire was set by a burner located beneath the third rack towards the rear of the building. The heat release rate from the fire was deduced from the measurement of the total mass loss. The influence of a number of parameters on the longitudinal fire propagation along the racks, the lateral propagation from one rack to another and the shape and height of the flame once the roof collapsed was investigated. These parameters were the stockage compacity, the thickness of the roof and the number of rack shelves. The most important results will be presented and compared where appropriate to previous work, in particular to studies on fire propagation in warehouses [eg. 2] Thermal effects of fire warehouses on their surroundings have been less studied and will be analysed here in some details. In particular, the measured heat fluxes will be compared with the values predicted by the in-house tool FNAP.
