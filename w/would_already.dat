5|$|Queen Cersei, and {{her twin}} brother, Jaime Lannister, are {{watching}} as the dead body of Jon Arryn, The Hand of The King is tended to by the Silent Sisters. They discuss whether he revealed any dangerous information regarding {{the two of them}} to anyone before his death. Jaime assures his sister that if Arryn had spoken to anyone, they <b>would</b> <b>already</b> have been executed.|$|E
5|$|Another claim {{involved}} alien invasion. In December 2010, an article, {{first published}} in examiner.com and later referenced in the English-language edition of Pravda claimed, citing a Second Digitized Sky Survey photograph as evidence, that SETI had detected three large spacecraft due to arrive at Earth in 2012. Astronomer and debunker Phil Plait noted that by using the small-angle formula, one could determine that if the object in the photo were as large as claimed, {{it would have had}} to be closer to Earth than the Moon, which would mean it <b>would</b> <b>already</b> have arrived. In January 2011, Seth Shostak, chief astronomer of SETI, issued a press release debunking the claims.|$|E
5|$|Instead, the {{argument}} considers the entire collection (jumla) of contingent things, {{the sum total}} of every contingent thing that exists, has existed, or will exist. Avicenna argues that this aggregate, too, must obey the rule that applies to a single contingent thing; in other words, it must have something outside itself that causes it to exist. This cause has to be either contingent or necessary. It cannot be contingent, though, because if it were, it <b>would</b> <b>already</b> be included within the aggregate. Thus the only remaining possibility is that an external cause is necessary, and that cause must be a necessary existent.|$|E

5|$|On December 17, 1851, Henry Clay {{submitted}} {{a letter of}} resignation of his seat in the U.S. Senate, to be effective September 1 of the following year (1852). Clay's announcement came while the Kentucky General Assembly was in session. This was intentional. The majority of the Assembly was Whig, and Clay {{knew that if he}} resigned while the Assembly was in session, the majority would elect a Whig to be his successor. By contrast, if he had waited until September 1 to announce his resignation the Assembly <b>would</b> <b>already</b> have closed its session, and Governor Powell, a Democrat, would appoint a temporary successor until the legislature convened again two years later.|$|E
5|$|The main {{character}} designer for the game, Tetsuya Nomura, had also worked on both Final Fantasy VII and Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children. The Tsviets were designed {{with the idea}} of creating a sense of balance for the warriors with which players <b>would</b> <b>already</b> be familiar; primarily Vincent, Cloud Strife and Sephiroth. Nomura initially had doubts when designing Shelke's ordinary clothes {{for the end of the}} game, but he felt it was important for her to appear out of uniform so as to indicate she was truly free from Deepground. The character of G was based on the Japanese singer and actor Gackt, who wrote and performed the two theme songs of the game, and voiced G in the Japanese-language version of the game. Hideki Imaizumi, the producer of Crisis Core, liked the mysterious role of G so much, he decided to expand his character in that game. The character of Lucrecia Crescent, who features briefly in an optional quest in the original game, was redesigned so as to give her a similar appearance to her son, Sephiroth, based on portraits from guidebooks and in fan-art. Reeve Tuesti was also redesigned, as he only appears briefly in the original game as himself rather than through Cait Sith.|$|E
5|$|Each Surface overworld had a {{specific}} theme: the forest overworld revolved around landforms altering gameplay, the volcano overworld focused around {{changing the rules}} of gameplay, while the desert overworld was themed around duality between past and present. The first areas, the Sealed Grounds and Faron Woods, were created so players could be eased into the game's mechanics and navigation. While the forest areas were made to be mostly flat, the Eldin Volcano overworld was made with height differences in mind to provide a greater challenge. Elements in the volcano terrain included areas of lava, and slopes where Link's sprinting ability would become necessary for reaching new areas. For the Lanayru Desert, the team created three different overworld zones due to its unique time shifting mechanics, triggered with Time Shift stones: this shifting between different zones was inspired by similar systems in Ocarina of Time and Twilight Princess. The portable Time Shift stones were one of many ideas included in the desert overworld as they did not fit with the forest or volcano environments. A difficult feature to include naturally was the remnants of Lanayru's Ancient Civilization, which used electricity to power both its technology and citizens. Enemy types that recurred in all Surface-based overworld areas were given slightly altered designs so they would be unique to each overworld. The Silent Realms were created as a new mechanic, filled with enemies {{that could not be}} defeated and relying on Link's sprinting ability rather than his weapons or items. While they had experimented with indestructible enemies in Phantom Hourglass and Spirit Tracks, but this time it was changed by restricting Link's options and actions. They also created a time limit for added strategy, as knowledge of the areas where the Spirit Realms were located was key to completing them. This was also why they were set up in areas players <b>would</b> <b>already</b> be familiar with. They were originally in the form of special dungeons, but this was discarded in favor of the familiar areas.|$|E

5|$|Edwards' next {{fraudulent}} scheme involved forging {{letters to}} cotton brokers in New Orleans, {{and using the}} signatures obtained from their replies to forge letters to brokers in New York City, saying that the fake John Caldwell– Edwards' alias– had {{a large amount of}} cotton on deposit with the New Orleans brokers. Edwards used those letters to secure fraudulent loans from brokers on the security of the non-existent cotton. Two New York brokers– Brown Bros. & Co. and Jacob Little– gave Edwards bank drafts for $25,000 each. Edwards then cashed the drafts pretending to be Caldwell, but without attempting to disguise his appearance. Unluckily for Edwards, in September 1841 Brown Brothers was informed by the New Orleans brokers that there was no cotton on account for Caldwell, and this prompted the bankers to offer a reward for information on the forger. The police began to search for the forger of the letters, but were unsuccessful until Edwards attempted to distract their attention to an acquaintance, Alexander Powell, who happened to look much like him. Edwards sent an anonymous letter to the New York police, stating that the forger they were hunting was sailing to England, as Powell was about to do. Edwards assumed that by the time the police acted, Powell's ship <b>would</b> <b>already</b> have sailed. The ship was delayed and the police were able to catch Powell, who told them that Edwards was their forger.|$|E

50|$|The {{hostilities}} <b>would</b> resume <b>already</b> in {{the spring}} of 1673 as the Sejm never ratified the treaty. In 1676 it was revised with the Treaty of Żurawno (today in Zhuravno, Zhydachiv Raion).|$|R
25|$|It was {{suggested}} that the disqualified Joyce could remain in ministerial office for three months in accordance with , which could give {{time for him to}} be re-elected in a by-election. However, constitutional experts consider that, even if s 64 could apply, the three-month grace period would run from ministerial appointment following the general election of July 2016 and so <b>would</b> <b>already</b> have expired.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} plans {{called for}} one patient tower, {{but this was}} amended to include two because of cost savings analysis. UK Healthcare would save $10 to $12 million by constructing the second patient tower instead of adding it in on a later date. It is also advantageous because the construction plans and cranes <b>would</b> <b>already</b> be in place and that disruptions would be minimal.|$|E
25|$|Though {{most of the}} Constitution's framers {{supported}} the right of individual States to regulate alcohol, some - such as Richard O'Connor - believed Section 113 to be unnecessary because the States <b>would</b> <b>already</b> have this power despite Section 92. Furthermore, O'Connor was concerned that by the specific inclusion of Section 113 (and Section 112), the police power of the States {{would be limited to}} the powers which were specifically enumerated.|$|E

50|$|Poland, {{which already}} had a smaller {{population}} and thus a smaller military budget and army than Germany, was further disadvantaged because Poland was unsure whether the war <b>would</b> start <b>already,</b> and its armed forces were not fully mobilized by 1 September.|$|R
25|$|The Philippine {{government}} {{is planning to}} buy anti-aircraft guided missiles from Israel. The surface-to-air missiles or multiple launch rocket systems were being offered by Rafael Advanced Defense Systems Ltd. and Israel Military Industries Ltd., both based in Israel. Defense Secretary Voltaire Gazmin was planning to go to Israel next week to forge {{an agreement with the}} prospective suppliers. “If you have an agreement this would hasten the procurement process, say in three to six months you <b>would</b> <b>already</b> have the weapons. The agreement gives you the leeway to access all the information you want know about a particular weapon you want to procure”.|$|E
25|$|The {{press in}} Russia {{has offered a}} number of {{alternatives}} to Litvinenko's demise. As one example, Russian state television has taken the view that if Litvinenko knew any important secrets, he <b>would</b> <b>already</b> have made them public during his six-year-long stay in the United Kingdom. According to this view, {{he was not an}} important person and not worth a loud political scandal. Also a suspicious simultaneousness between the deaths of the so-called oppositionals and big international summits with Russian participation was noted, along with the question who could be interested in worsening Russia's and Putin's image in front of them.|$|E
25|$|The 1970s {{and early}} 1980s were {{a time of}} {{transition}} for typewriters and word processors. At one point in time, most small-business offices would be completely 'old-style', while large corporations and government departments <b>would</b> <b>already</b> be 'new-style'; other offices would have a mixture. The pace of change was so rapid that it was common for clerical staff {{to have to learn}} several new systems, one after the other, in just a few years. While such rapid change is commonplace today, and is taken for granted, this was not always so; in fact, typewriting technology changed very little in its first 80 or 90 years.|$|E
5000|$|The GDR {{would also}} {{participate}} in the conference suggested by Stalin, besides the FRG. The GDR would be recognized by the western side by that fact, and Stalin <b>would</b> have <b>already</b> achieved one of his goals, without having given up anything.|$|R

25|$|In the {{political}} life of Spain, the king <b>would</b> <b>already</b> {{be familiar with}} the various political leaders in a professional capacity, and perhaps less formally in a more social capacity, facilitating their meeting following a General Election. Conversely, nominating the party leader whose party maintains a plurality and who are already familiar with their party manifesto facilitates a smoother nomination process. In the event of coalitions, {{the political}} leaders would customarily have met beforehand to hammer out a coalition agreements before their meeting with the king. Once appointed, the President of the Government forms an administration whose ministers are appointed and removed by the king on the president's advice. No minister may take up his appointment until after they give their oath of office to obey the constitution with loyalty to the king.|$|E
25|$|The {{site was}} {{probably}} constructed {{between the first}} and second century BCE. Notes by Martins Sarmento and from recent explorations show that the Monte de São Romão was a favoured location for rock art engravings of the Atlantic Bronze Age, in the beginning of the first millennium BCE; it is not known when or why this first group left. Numerous early engraved rock surfaces were destroyed when many boulders were cut to build the ramparts and family compounds as the Castro settlement grew. Little is known of the beginnings of the Castro occupation, as no structures from the late Bronze Age have been found. Pottery from the early Iron Age has been found, when the settlement <b>would</b> <b>already</b> have been fortified. The majority of the ruins visible today have been dated from the second Iron Age, especially the last two centuries BCE.|$|E
25|$|Before {{arriving}} at the camp, inmates would spend several days {{in the custody of}} the Gestapo and SP UGB, where they were tortured and beaten. By the time they were transferred from these detention centers to Banjica, some of the prisoners <b>would</b> <b>already</b> have displayed signs of serious mutilation. Throughout the camp's operation, guards would regularly beat and mistreat prisoners. The camp was notorious for its brutality and executions were frequent and random. Inmates were expected to follow the standard rules of conduct that were implemented in other German camps. These rules prohibited singing, speaking loudly, having conversations on political subjects, possessing writing utensils and paper, and all other personal belongings. The infraction of any of these rules would result in execution. Despite this, imprisoned anti-fascists defied the Germans by singing Partisan songs, shouting their support for Tito and Stalin, and by holding lectures, discussions, one-act plays, recitals, and even folk-song and dance performances on the campgrounds.|$|E
