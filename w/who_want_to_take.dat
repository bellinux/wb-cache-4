25|$|There {{are over}} 100 million street {{children}} worldwide. Most {{of the children}} living in institutions {{around the world have}} a surviving parent or close relative, and they most commonly entered orphanages because of poverty. It is speculated that, flush with money, orphanages are increasing and push for children to join even though demographic data show that even the poorest extended families usually take in children whose parents have died. Experts and child advocates maintain that orphanages are expensive and often harm children's development by separating them from their families {{and that it would be}} more effective and cheaper to aid close relatives <b>who</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> in the orphans.|$|E

25|$|Fred Tupper (Neil Crone)– The local loudmouth and {{the host}} of a talk show on the local radio station, he often equates Muslims to terrorists <b>who</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> over the country. However, at times he finds himself in the awkward {{position}} of siding with the Muslim community, as evidenced in the first season. A flashback episode revealed that his distrust of Muslims stems more from an unpleasant encounter with Baber than from any deeply held prejudices. His radio rants are primarily a ratings-grabbing persona; while he can be a blowhard jerk on and off the air, he treats pretty much everyone with equal condescension (not just Muslims). By season 3, it is revealed that his objectionable comments {{have more to do with}} habit and keeping ratings up, than any active dislike of Muslims. In fact, when he believes he is dying, he is downright friendly to everyone (including Muslims) and almost declares his love to Fatima. She graciously allows him his dignity when he claims it is in fact her hummus that he loves. Fred Tupper is also a divorcee.|$|E

25|$|The first track, «Babilla» (Puerto Rican jargon for Courage), {{serves as}} the album's intro, and its concept {{is similar to the}} one in his {{previous}} studio album, Desahogo, being a relief to all that annoys him, mentioning Donald Trump's xenophobia, sexual video games, religion and people <b>who</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> advantage with his music. «Sentimiento» (Spanish for Feeling) talks about a beautiful and attractive woman who wants a sincere romantic relationship and getting married instead of money and luxury. «Se Escapa» (Spanish for She Escapes) is about respecting and taking care of one's girlfriend in order to not lose her. «Moriré» (Spanish for I Will Die) is a romantic ballad about dying for a woman if she is no longer interesed in one's feelings after a long relationship, using a lot of analogies centered in animals and nature. «El Silencio Mata» (Spanish for Silence Kills) talks about a woman who suffers of domestic violence but needs to talk to someone about that, although she's too scared to denounce his own spouse. «El Corazón Se Pone Bruto» (Spanish for The Heart Gets Stupid) is a moralizing reggaeton about thinking before acting and encouraging the use of preservative, telling two stories about girls that are attracted to men they recently know, both with terrible endings (one girl ends pregnant and the other contracting AIDS). «La Prueba de Farmacia» (Spanish for Pharmacy Test) tells the story about a pregnant teenager who tries to convince her mother that her boyfriend will take care of her whatever happens. «Angelina» tells the story about a low class single mother who have to work as a stripper in order to earn enough money to feed her baby after being abandoned by her boyfriend. «Agua» is about Vico's detention in late 2002 because of porting heroin in his car, complaining about the police and Puerto Rican justice. The term agua (literally water in Spanish) is used in the song as a Puerto Rican jargon referring to the police.|$|E

On the third day of the trial, the courtroom descended into chaos as Monsieur M'Barek burst into tears then jumped to his feet pointing at Shaftesbury's family. He attempted to blame the Ashley-Cooper family for the peer's death, claiming that they were the guilty ones.

500|$|The U.S. {{frequently}} {{uses its}} economic power {{in order to}} punish other countries. [...] One of the ways the U.S. does this is by holding back on exporting food. [...] Reasons for the punishment of another country vary; however, they {{can be broken down}} into two main groups: Foreign containment objective and market development/humanitarian objectives. [...] The foreign containment objective tends to punish those countries who are threatening to the U.S. [...] An example of such a threat would be countries under other forms of government. [...] More examples related to the containment objective would be no aid to communist countries, socialist governments, countries who support radical regimes, regimes with an inadequate democracy who are too weak to be anti-communist (effectively), and countries who will not accept U.S. agreements. [...] An example of market development and humanitarian objectives would fall under a category of countries that are trying to compete with the U.S. economically. [...] The U.S. will execute foreign aid punishments to countries trying to nationalize property of U.S. companies, countries <b>who</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> over functions by U.S. companies, and countries trying to initiate nationalistic economic policies.|$|E
