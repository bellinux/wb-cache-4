40|$|Background: The rubber hand {{illusion}} (RHI) {{has been}} widely used to investigate the bodily self in healthy individuals. The aim {{of the present study}} was to extend the use of the RHI to examine the bodily self in <b>eating</b> <b>disorders.</b> Methods: The RHI and self-report measures of <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> psychopathology (EDI- 3 subscales of Drive for Thinness, Bulimia, Body Dissatisfaction, Interoceptive Deficits, and Emotional Dysregulation; DASS- 21; and the Self-Objectification Questionnaire) were administered to 78 individuals <b>with</b> an <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> and 61 healthy controls. Results: Individuals <b>with</b> an <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> experienced the RHI significantly more strongly than healthy controls on both perceptual (i. e., proprioceptive drift) and subjective (self-report questionnaire) measures. Furthermore, both the subjective experience of the RHI and associated proprioceptive biases were correlated <b>with</b> <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> psychopathology. Approximately 20 % of the variance for embodiment of the fake hand was accounted for by <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> psychopathology, <b>with</b> interoceptive deficits and self-objectification significant predictors of embodiment. Conclusions: These results indicate that the bodily self is more plastic in people <b>with</b> an <b>eating</b> <b>disorder.</b> These findings may shed light on both aetiological and maintenance factors involved in <b>eating</b> <b>disorders,</b> particularly visual processing of the body, interoceptive deficits, and self-objectification...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study {{examined}} whether sexual and physical abuse, bullying by peers, and ethnicity-based discrimination {{are associated with}} an increased risk for developing binge <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> in black women and in white women and whether any increase in risk is specific for the development of binge <b>eating</b> <b>disorder.</b> METHOD: A community sample of 162 women <b>with</b> binge <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> and 251 healthy and 107 psychiatric comparison subjects was interviewed for exposure to the risk factors under investigation. RESULTS: White subjects <b>with</b> binge <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> reported significantly higher rates of sexual abuse, physical abuse, bullying by peers, and discrimination than healthy comparison subjects. Only rates of discrimination were significantly higher in white women <b>with</b> binge <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> than in matched psychiatric comparison subjects.

The 2001 survey showed that 84% of OA members identified as binge eaters, 15% as bulimic, and 1% as anorexic. The 1981 survey had found that 44.5% of OA members identified as binge eaters, 40.7% as bulimic, and 14.8% as anorexic. The survey also found an increase in the percentage of males in OA from 9% in 1981 to 16% in 2001. Both figures are generally in line with estimates made by the American Psychological Association that the male to female ratio of those <b>with</b> <b>eating</b> <b>disorders</b> ranges from 1:6 to 1:10. The researcher stated that the typical OA member in Washington was white and highly educated. The typical OA member surveyed in 2001 worked in a full-time capacity and homemakers only comprised 6% of the 2001 OA population, in contrast to 30% of those surveyed in 1981. This reflects the trend for increasing numbers of females to be employed outside of the home. Further, 80% of the 2001 participants had attained a college degree, compared to 59% of those surveyed in 1981. The percentage of OA members who were divorced or separated had risen from 10% in 1981 to 21% in 2001, also reflecting trends amongst the general population.|$|E

40|$|Anorexia nervosa is {{a serious}} and {{life-threatening}} mental health issue which needs to be given more attention. Qualitative research on parents’ experience in caring for a child <b>with</b> an <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> is lacking around the world, and is almost non-existent in New Zealand. Parents of a child <b>with</b> an <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> have a huge and difficult role in caring for their child. Resources and facilities for treating <b>eating</b> <b>disorders</b> {{around the world are}} limited, and support for carers is minimal, which means the distressing experience of caring for a child <b>with</b> an <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> can become more difficult to manage. By giving parents in New Zealand an opportunity to voice their experiences, others may be educated about anorexia nervosa and the experiences of parents. A qualitative approach was employed in this project to explore the experiences of parents in caring for a child <b>with</b> an <b>eating</b> <b>disorder.</b> Twelve parents of nine daughters suffering from anorexia nervosa consented to participate in this research and were interviewed. Interviews were recorded, transcribed and analysed using phenomenological approaches. Descriptive, interpretative and hermeneutic phenomenological methods were drawn on to provide a detailed and in-depth explanation of what it is like for a parent to care for a child <b>with</b> an <b>eating</b> <b>disorder.</b> Analysis revealed that the parents experienced three stages during the struggle for the salvation of their child, which I have labeled the insidious stage, the tenacious stage and the recovery stage. Across the stages it was apparent that the battle against the <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> was never-ending, and full of uncertainty, contradiction and emotion. So coping was essential for the physically, emotionally and psychologically exhausted parents. The findings from this research can help raise awareness in society, assist in nationwide education around <b>eating</b> <b>disorders</b> and contribute to improving parents’ experiences of caring for a child <b>with</b> an <b>eating</b> <b>disorder.</b> This research has established a good foundation for understanding the experiences of New Zealand parents, regarding {{what it is like to}} care for a child <b>with</b> an <b>eating</b> <b>disorder...</b>|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Many {{risk factors}} have been implicated for <b>eating</b> <b>disorders,</b> {{although}} {{little is known about}} those for binge <b>eating</b> <b>disorder.</b> METHODS: A community-based, case-control design was used to compare 52 women <b>with</b> binge <b>eating</b> <b>disorder,</b> 104 without an <b>eating</b> <b>disorder,</b> 102 <b>with</b> other psychiatric disorders, and 102 with bulimia nervosa. RESULTS: The main risk factors identified from the comparison of subjects <b>with</b> binge <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> <b>with</b> healthy control subjects were certain adverse childhood experiences, parental depression, vulnerability to obesity, and repeated exposure to negative comments about shape, weight, and <b>eating.</b> Compared <b>with</b> the subjects with other psychiatric <b>disorders,</b> those <b>with</b> binge <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> reported more childhood obesity and more exposure to negative comments about shape, weight, and eating.
