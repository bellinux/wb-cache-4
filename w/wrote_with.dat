5|$|Adolphe Adam was {{a popular}} writer of ballet and opera music in early 19th-century France. He <b>wrote</b> <b>with</b> great speed and {{completed}} Giselle in about two months. The music {{was written in the}} smooth, song-like style of the day called cantilena. This style is well known to music lovers from Bellini's opera Norma and Donizetti's Lucia di Lammermoor.|$|E
5|$|Hama {{wrote out}} page-by-page plots {{for all of}} the issues he <b>wrote,</b> <b>with</b> most pages having four to six panels. He worked very closely with the artists in {{plotting}} the book, and wrote the series spontaneously, never knowing how an issue would end until he got to the last page.|$|E
5|$|In {{his early}} career Whitehead wrote {{primarily}} on mathematics, logic, and physics. His most notable work in these fields is the three-volume Principia Mathematica (1910–13), which he <b>wrote</b> <b>with</b> former student Bertrand Russell. Principia Mathematica {{is considered one}} of the twentieth century's most important works in mathematical logic, and placed 23rd in a list of the top 100 English-language nonfiction books of the twentieth century by Modern Library.|$|E

5|$|Most of Leonardo's {{writings}} are in mirror-image cursive. While secrecy {{is often}} suggested {{as the reason}} for this style of writing, it may have been more of a practical expediency. Since Leonardo <b>wrote</b> <b>with</b> his left hand, it was probably easier for him to write from right to left.|$|E
5|$|The intense {{international}} exchange produced several cosmopolitan humanist scholars, including Francisco de Holanda, André de Resende and Damião de Góis, {{a friend of}} Erasmus who <b>wrote</b> <b>with</b> rare independence on the reign of King Manuel I. Diogo and André de Gouveia made relevant teaching reforms via France. Foreign news and products in the Portuguese factory in Antwerp attracted the interest of Thomas More and Dürer to the wider world. There, profits and know-how helped nurture the Dutch Renaissance and Golden Age, especially after {{the arrival of the}} wealthy cultured Jewish community expelled from Portugal.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} cast {{was listed}} in {{the first edition of}} The Country Wife, as was standard practice, and modern scholars have suggested that this information throws light on Wycherley's intentions. Wycherley <b>wrote</b> <b>with</b> the original actors in mind, tailoring the roles to their strengths. Also, since the audience consisted mostly of habitual playgoers, authors and directors could use the associations of an actor's previous repertoire to enrich or undercut a character, effects familiar on television and in the cinema today.|$|E

5|$|With Field Marshal Montgomery's Memoirs as her guide, Manning found battle scenes {{easier to}} write in the second volume of the trilogy, The Battle Lost and Won. After a slow start, Manning <b>wrote</b> <b>with</b> {{certainty}} and speed; the book was completed in a record seven months, and published in 1978. The book follows the Pringles as Rommel and the Afrika Korps approach Alexandria, where Guy is teaching. Egypt remains a place of privilege and sexual exchange for the non-combatants and the Pringles' marriage slowly disintegrates.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps the most-quoted anecdote {{concerning}} Hardee was that, on 9 October 1986 {{his house}} was searched by the police – who were looking for crumbs – two days after he and others stole Freddie Mercury's £4,000 40th birthday cake. No crumbs were found at the house as he had already by then donated the cake to a local nursing home. He used this incident {{as the title of}} his 1996 autobiography I Stole Freddie Mercury's Birthday Cake which he <b>wrote</b> <b>with</b> John Fleming. In another encounter with the police, Hardee was once questioned by Special Branch officers after being found on the balcony outside government minister Michael Heseltine's hotel room, wearing nothing but a pair of socks and a leather coat containing £5,200 in cash and a pack of pornographic playing cards. He had mistaken the room for that of a friend.|$|E
5|$|The production’s incredible. The beat {{is just so}} {{constant}} and powerful. That was the first song that I <b>wrote</b> <b>with</b> Dimitri and Maya. I felt like I’d found my sound. And I was kind {{of looking at it}} like an outfit. So it was, ‘if this was an outfit, what would this song need now?’ So we had the pretty dress, which was the chorus. We had the lovely shoes, which was the verse. ‘But what do we need to really set this song off? A big, fancy, bow in the hair would really set this song off.’ So when I got to the middle eight I wanted to go really erratic, almost like taTu on All The Things She Said. I wanted it to be proper fucked up and crazy – hands in the air.|$|E
