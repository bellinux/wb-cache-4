5|$|The {{music video}} begins with Vives <b>waking</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> seeing {{two women in}} the bed with him. He remembers being seduced by them when he was drunk the night before. Realizing this, he packs his {{belongings}} and leaves the house. He is seen driving a car until it runs out fuel which forces him to travel by foot where he eventually arrives at a town. In another house, a woman (played by Fabián) wakes up recalling the events of her abusive husband (played by Zamora). She enters a church and says a prayer. Later, Vives is seen hanging out with two men at an outdoor bar when he spots the woman whom he immediately becomes smitten with. Afterwards, he {{and the two men}} are fishing on a boat when Vives sees the woman again. He begins having illusions of him and the woman having a happy life together which drives him insane in his room. That night, the woman finds her husband making love to another woman in a car. Upon discovering this, she leaves the house. At the same time, the town is holding a festival where Vives is celebrating with the townsfolk. The video concludes with him and the woman seeing each other once more and they decide to go out together.|$|E
25|$|The DI and VFX for Guzaarish {{was done}} by Prime Focus, a global Visual Entertainment Services group, who had {{previously}} collaborated with Sanjay Leela Bhansali on many films including 'Black' and 'Saawariya'.The look of the film was designed to move with the narrative. The first scene shows Sophia D'Souza <b>waking</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> taking care of Ethan, for which the shafts of light have been enhanced and colors desaturated but the skin tones maintained. From the skies, to the wall colouring, {{every part of the}} movie has been enhanced in some way. The VFX team was throughout in the sets right from when the film was being shot.|$|E
25|$|This mandapam is {{used for}} the {{distribution}} of free food everyday to all those who visit the temple. It is located 2 mins walk from the Southern premises of the temple property. This mandapam serves to validate the values that are mentioned in the ancient Tamil epic of Manimekalai. The epic is set in both the harbour town of Kaveripattinam, the modern town of Puhar in Tamil Nadu, and in Nainativu, a small sandy island of the Jaffna Peninsula. The story follows the following plot: The dancer-courtesan Manimekalai is pursued by the amorous Cholan prince Udyakumaran, but rather wants to dedicate herself to a religious celibate life. The sea goddess Manimekala Theivam (Manimekalai Devi) puts her to sleep and takes her to the island Manipallavam (Nainathivu). After <b>waking</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> wandering about the island Manimekalai comes across the Dharma-seat, which was placed there by Lord Indra, on which Buddha had taught and appeased two warring Naga princes. Those who worship it miraculously know their previous life. Manimekalai automatically worshiped it and recollects what has happened in her previous life. She then meets the guardian goddess of the Dharma seat, Deeva-Teelakai (Dvipa Tilaka) who explains her the significance of the Dharma seat and lets her acquire the magic never-failing begging bowl (cornucopia) called Amurta Surabhi (”cow of abundance”), which will always provide food to alleviate hunger. As such, devotees and visitors are welcomed to enjoy a traditional meal after visiting the temple.|$|E

500|$|In 1985, Patrick Duffy {{announced}} his intentions {{to leave the}} show which left Pamela and Bobby permanently disconnected from each other. When Duffy initially left Dallas in 1985, {{it was assumed that}} Pamela and Bobby's relationship had finally ended after a brief reconciliation during that season. However, the actor returned to the show the following season after the ratings began to fall. Leonard Katzman said, [...] "Without Bobby we lost the white knight to J.R. and the Romeo to Victoria Principal's Juliet. With Patrick back we can return to the family drama that made the show." [...] The entire previous season was written off as a dream, with Pamela <b>waking</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> finding Bobby alive in the shower.|$|E
500|$|The cantata in six {{movements}} {{opens with}} a sequence of alternating arias and recitatives leading to a chorus and a concluding chorale. The chorale tune, known as [...] "", appears in the first movement, played by the organ, and musical motifs of the arias are derived from it, providing an overall formal unity to the composition. Bach scored the work for two vocal parts (alto and tenor), a four-part choir, and a Baroque chamber ensemble of recorders, strings and continuo. In the alto recitative (movement 4), accompanied by all instruments, Bach creates the images of sleep, of <b>waking</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> of funeral bells, the latter in the recorders and pizzicato of the strings.|$|E
500|$|The book {{includes}} an editor's note, a brief section providing legal advice for American Occupy activists, and five sections written by Chomsky himself. Occupy opens with an editor's note written by Greg Ruggiero, {{in which he}} explains the basics to Chomsky's views on the Occupy movement, drawing quotes from his various public speeches {{in order to do}} so. Ruggiero also discusses Occupy's success in the United States, stating that it has helped to change media discussions by introducing terms like [...] "the 99%" [...] into popular discourse and also by bringing national attention to the plight of the impoverished. He remarks that the protest movement has not only helped to highlight the [...] "heartlessness and inhumanity" [...] of the socio-political system, but that it has also helped to provide solidarity with those [...] "being crushed" [...] under that system. Suggesting reasons for the movement's success, he optimistically describes the manner in which [...] "People are <b>waking</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> coming out." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Customer Loyalty" [...] {{received}} largely positive {{reviews from}} television critics. James Poniewozik of Time magazine {{concluded that it}} [...] "showed the stakes behind its characters' paper-pushing lives {{in a way it}} hasn't since Michael Scott left Scranton." [...] He called the first half a [...] "wacky ensemble show", but said that the last part featured elements that allowed the audience to [...] "all but hear the old machinery [...] <b>waking</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> sliding into place". Poniewozik stated that Jim and Pam's fight was [...] "believable in its arc and its parameters" [...] and that both characters were presented in a way in which their plights were understandable. Ally Serrigran of Hollywood.com wrote that the [...] "episode was one worth tuning in for." [...] She felt that, for fans of the show who had left when Steve Carell departed, [...] "Customer Loyalty" [...] was the right episode for them {{to come back to the}} series. She called the fight between Jim and Pam [...] "jarring in and of itself". Mark Perigard of the Boston Herald commented on the fight between Jim and Pam, writing that it [...] "felt just like the kind of argument that two real people would have." [...] Brett Harrison Davinger of the California Literary Review wrote that the episode was [...] "fine" [...] and was composed of [...] "several small storylines, all of which worked". Davinger called the ending [...] "odd" [...] but [...] "effective".|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} starts {{off with a}} blue monitor screen with an eye showing the {{inscription}} [...] "Welcome". The video progresses inside a blue space ship-style room with Madonna lying prostrate in {{what seems to be}} a scientific experiment. The imagery cast in this section of the video have drawn comparisons to hermeticism. The video progresses into a sequence of dreams, containing varied surrealistic, mystic, new age, Sufi and Egyptian imagery and symbolism. Such include a scene in which Madonna lies on a rotating sunflower, and images of a woman with long hair, an alchemist-type man holding a cube with Madonna's face on each side as well as rotating Sufi dancers. The dream sequence progresses with unusual clips, including Madonna in a pool with half-visible skulls. A scene in which Madonna, dressed in a light dressing gown, gives birth to doves, can also be seen; the image has been compared to the work of René Magritte and Kahlo's 1932 painting My Birth. Suddenly, she floats down a corridor in a white gown and appears in a black-and-white projection in a cinema-like room. As the music gets more dramatic, the dream grows intense, with images of skulls and scars appearing, and the singer can be seen wading through space. A scene in which Madonna's eyes are replaced with her mouth and her mouth with an eye precedes the ending, influenced by the work of Kahlo; the final shots show Madonna <b>waking</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> looking out.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the second}} episode of series sixteen, Hammond {{suggested}} {{that no one}} would ever want to own a Mexican car, since cars are supposed to reflect national characteristics and so a Mexican car would be [...] "lazy, feckless, flatulent, overweight, leaning against a fence, asleep, looking at a cactus with a blanket with a hole in the middle on as a coat." [...] Hammond finished with the remark [...] "I'm sorry, but can you imagine <b>waking</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> remembering you're Mexican?!" [...] Following complaints, the BBC defended the broadcast of this segment on the grounds that such national stereotyping was a [...] "robust part" [...] of traditional British humour.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the top of}} he social {{structure}} of Paris was the nobility, led by the King and his court. [...] Both Louis XVIII and Charles X lived in the Tuileries Palace, and used the Chateau of Saint-Cloud as their main secondary residence. The ancient and decayed Tuileries was not a comfortable residence; [...] it had no basement or sewers, {{and the lack of}} modern plumbing made it foul-smelling; [...] one noblewoman, the Countess of Boigne, [...] reported that [...] "one is almost suffocated climbing the staircases of the Pavillon de Flore and crossing the corridors of the second floor." [...] The Kings did not carry on the elaborate social protocols and festivities of their predecessors; [...] both had lived many years in exile, and they were used to a simpler life. [...] The formal and grand ceremony of the King's <b>waking</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> going to bed was replaced by a simple ceremony each evening at nine clock, when the King gave {{the order of the day}} to the commander and captains of the King's guards. [...] The King had to live within a household budget, fixed at the beginning of each year; twenty five million livres for Louis XVIII and twenty million for Charles X.|$|E
2500|$|Album of the Year was {{released}} in 1997 and featured yet another new guitarist, Jon Hudson, who was a former roommate of Billy Gould. The album debuted much higher than expected in some countries (for example, in Germany, the album debuted at No.2 and stayed in the chart for 5 months). In Australia, Album of the Year went to No.1 and was certified Platinum. The album charted in many countries in Europe. To date, Album of the Year has sold around 2 million copies worldwide. [...] The singles [...] "Ashes to Ashes" [...] and [...] "Last Cup of Sorrow" [...] had minimal success (notably, the music video for [...] "Last Cup of Sorrow", which featured actress Jennifer Jason Leigh, {{was inspired by the}} Alfred Hitchcock film Vertigo).

Rolling Stone magazine wrote in their original review [...] " [...] are floundering around desperately, groping for a sense of identity and direction in a decade that clearly finds them irrelevant", while Pitchfork Media stated [...] "Album Of The Year leaves one feeling like <b>waking</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> finding last night's used condom -- sure, the ride was fun while it lasted, but what remains is just plain icky.

2500|$|Ellen Burstyn {{was still}} in the midst of filming The Exorcist when Warner Bros. {{executives}} expressed interest in working with her on another project. Burstyn later recalled, [...] "It was early in the woman's movement, and we were all just <b>waking</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> having a look at the pattern of our lives and wanting it to be different… I wanted to make a different kind of film. A film from a woman's point of view, but a woman that I recognized, that I knew. And not just myself, but my friends, what we were all going through at the time. So my agent found Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore… When I read it I liked it a lot. I sent it to Warner Brothers and they agreed to do it. Then they asked who I wanted to direct it. I said that I didn't know, but I wanted somebody new and young and exciting. I called Francis Coppola and asked who was young and exciting and he said 'Go look at a movie called Mean Streets and see what you think.' It hadn't been released yet, so I booked a screening to look at it and I felt that it was exactly what…Alice needed, because [...] was a wonderful script and well written, but for my taste it was a little slick. You know – in a good way, in a kind of Doris Day–Rock Hudson kind of way. I wanted something a bit more gritty." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Doesn't Really Matter" [...] was {{notably the}} first video {{directed}} by Joseph Kahn to incorporate themes of Japanese culture, which Kahn subsequently used in videos such as Britney Spears' [...] "Toxic" [...] and Mariah Carey's [...] "Boy (I Need You)." [...] Jackson had previously included Japanese {{themes in the}} music video for [...] "If," [...] voted among the [...] "Best Female Videos" [...] of the nineties. Britney Spears was inspired to work with Joseph Kahn for [...] "Stronger" [...] after Jackson's [...] "Doesn't Really Matter" [...] video, which also pays homage to Jackson's [...] "Miss You Much" [...] and [...] "The Pleasure Principle" [...] videos during choreographed chair routines. Mariah Carey's [...] "Boy (I Need You)" [...] video, which featured Cam'ron and was also directed by Kahn, was considered a [...] "clear extension of Janet's [...] "Doesn't Really Matter" [...] for its similar settings and usage of Japanese culture. Jessica Simpson's [...] "Irresistible" [...] video includes similar opening scenes, consisting of aerial views of a futuristic Japanese city at night, and similar outdoor environments. Simpson revealed Jackson to be an influence, saying [...] "I absolutely adore her and she is such a sweetheart." [...] Ciara's [...] "Get Up," [...] directed by Kahn, uses similar elements of an advanced city, also opening and ending with the lead star <b>waking</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> falling into bed as the lights dim.
