With music it's so much about the vibe and the energy and you know when things are working and when they’re not. When you're working with someone for the first time, there's a kind of shyness that everybody has, so with Benny it was more challenging because of that but <b>we</b> <b>figured</b> it out and by the end I felt like I knew him very well.|$|E

40|$|Attacks on {{cryptographic}} protocols {{are often}} subtle {{and hard to}} find. This is certainly true {{in the context of}} pro-tocol design. It is also true in the context of protocol analysis: researchers continue to announce new flaws discovered in protocols that have been repeatedly scru-tinized using a variety of methods. Read another way, however, this means that attacks are all too easy to find; much harder to find is a protocol that is free of attack. Still, once we have discovered an attack, it is clear that we’ve got one. If <b>we</b> <b>figure</b> a way for an attacker to follow the protocol specification yet still learn a secret key, then we have an attack.

Though there are familiar faces that serve as important characters in Xenosaga, others are more like self-parodies, so we don't really want Xenogears fans to overreact. Like movies, sometimes you have the director of the movie or friend of the leading actor appearing as cameos, so it's similar to that.|$|E

500|$|Paul McCartney is {{credited}} as providing [...] "celery and carrot" [...] {{on the track}} [...] "Receptacle for the Respectable". McCartney {{is alleged to have}} performed a similar role over thirty years earlier, chewing celery to form the percussion track of The Beach Boys song [...] "Vegetables" [...] from the album Smiley Smile. The Super Furry Animals had met the ex-Beatle at the NME Awards when a drunk Ciaran persuaded him to let them remix some Beatles material, resulting in 2000's Liverpool Sound Collage album. The band asked him to [...] "return the favour" [...] and appear on Rings Around the World, recording his part over the phone. Huw Bunford has said of McCartney's contribution: [...] "He took it with good nature. You kind of see how far you can go sometimes ... <b>we</b> <b>figured</b> we already had a bass and singers so we really didn't need any more musicians. So <b>we</b> <b>figured</b> he could crunch vegetables". [...] Former Velvet Underground member John Cale, a [...] "sort of childhood hero" [...] of Rhys's, also makes an appearance on the album, playing piano on the song [...] "Presidential Suite". The Super Furry Animals had met Cale in Cardiff when they acted as his backing band for a song which appeared on the film Beautiful Mistake. They originally asked him to arrange strings for [...] "Presidential Suite" [...] but Cale turned them down reasoning that he would simply do what the band do: hum a melody to someone who could write the music down for him.|$|E

[...] "And Jackie and I agreed we shouldn't challenge anybody or cause trouble—or we'd both {{be out of the}} big leagues, just like that. <b>We</b> <b>figured</b> that if we spoke out, we would ruin things for other black players." [...] After his rookie season, Doby again pursued time on the basketball court and appeared with the Paterson Crescents of the American Basketball League after signing a contract in January 1948.

500|$|Green Day also co-headlined a [...] "shared bill" [...] {{with fellow}} Californian pop-punk band Blink-182 on the Pop Disaster Tour from April to June 2002. The two bands traded off {{headlining}} positions throughout the tour, as Blink-182 was experiencing higher record sales at the time, while Green Day had experienced mainstream success {{for a longer}} period of time.

500|$|Bannings of Candide lasted {{into the}} twentieth century in the United States, where it has long been {{considered}} a seminal work of Western literature.

[...] Bassist Pete Wentz added that the band had not {{originally}} intended for the song to be released as a single either. [...] "'Beat It' seemed like a song that would be cool and that we could do our own take on", he said.

500|$|Filming {{began in}} February 2005; the crew filmed for ten {{hours a day}} for thirty-one days. The eleven-year-old Palmer had to follow the United States' child labor laws, which necessitated {{spending}} at least three hours a day at school, one on recreation, and one at lunch. Nevertheless, Palmer appeared in almost every scene, about which Ganis commented, [...] "I honestly don't know how <b>we</b> <b>figured</b> it out, but we did". To get the filming done on time, Atchison storyboarded the scenes ahead of time and chatted with cinematographer David Mullen, the production designer Warren Young, and Glenn Farr to compile a list of scenes. This way, the filming team began each day knowing what shots they would take, their order, and the performances scheduled for each day. Most of the filming took place in South Los Angeles, which Atchison picked as the filming location due to their low budget. Scenes were also filmed at the University of Southern California, Hollywood Palladium—which stood in for the Grand Ballroom of the Washington, D.C. Hyatt Hotel—and Venice High School.|$|E
