5|$|Hydrocarbon {{exploration}} {{in deep water}} occasionally results in significant environmental degradation resulting mainly from accumulation of contaminated drill cuttings, but also from oil spills. While the oil gusher involved in the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico originates from a <b>wellhead</b> only 1500meters below the ocean surface, it nevertheless illustrates the kind of environmental disaster that can result from mishaps related to offshore drilling for oil and gas.|$|E

50|$|Due to {{the cost}} of {{excavating}} individual glory holes, typically each glory hole will contain several <b>wellheads.</b> Locating multiple <b>wellheads</b> within a single glory hole is made possible by the use of directional drilling.|$|R
50|$|<b>Wellheads</b> {{control the}} {{production}} of oil or gas from the well, {{and can be used}} for water injection. They are mounted on production guidebases, which are the upper endpoint of the well casing at the seabed. A well head can be directly connected to a subsea manifold or indirectly via other <b>wellheads,</b> which may be arranged in groups called a subsea template. Most diving work on <b>wellheads</b> and manifolds is installation and maintenance.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] Xmas {{trees and}} <b>wellheads</b> are {{supplied}} by Vetco. The four original pre-drilled wells (though one {{has since been}} side-tracked) on the South side of the well bay use slightly smaller <b>wellheads</b> than the rest because {{they were part of}} the original template before the platform was put in place.|$|R

25|$|In October, 2013, Husky Energy and Government of Newfoundland & Labrador {{announced}} {{an agreement to}} amend the White Rose Development. White Rose {{is the name of}} an oil field offshore Newfoundland. The announcement included the news that this oil resource could be exploited by installing a gravity based 'wellhead platform' structure over the western section of the oil field on the ocean floor in approximately 120 metres of water. To support this billion dollar <b>wellhead</b> platform construction project, Husky announced that it would be establishing a graving dock facility on the Northside Peninsula at Argentia to support the construction of the concrete base of the <b>wellhead</b> platform. Construction of the graving dock began in late 2013 and was finished in early 2015. However, in December 2014, Husky announced that, due to declining oil prices, the decision to construct the Concrete Gravity Base (CGS) had been deferred.|$|E

25|$|A {{gigajoule}} (GJ) is {{a measure}} approximately equal to half a barrel (250lbs) of oil, or 1 million BTUs, or 1000cu ft of gas, or 28m3 of gas. The energy content of gas supply in Canada can vary from 37 to 43 MJ per m3 depending on gas supply and processing between the <b>wellhead</b> and the customer.|$|E
25|$|Shortly thereafter, Alberta's Legislature {{passed the}} Gas Resources Conservation Act, which gave Alberta {{greater control over}} natural gas at the <b>wellhead,</b> and {{empowered}} the Conservation Board to issue export permits. This {{led to the creation}} of the Alberta Gas Trunk Line, which gathered gas from wells in the province and to delivered it to exit points.|$|E
25|$|In the 19th century, {{natural gas}} was usually {{obtained}} as {{a by-product of}} producing oil, since the small, light gas carbon chains came out of solution as the extracted fluids underwent pressure reduction from the reservoir to the surface, similar to uncapping a soft drink bottle where the carbon dioxide effervesces. Unwanted natural gas was a disposal problem in the active oil fields. If {{there was not a}} market for natural gas near the <b>wellhead</b> it was prohibitively expensive to pipe to the end user.|$|E
50|$|Subsea {{manifolds}} are structures {{mounted on}} the seabed where pipelines and connections to <b>wellheads</b> are connected to control the flow of product from the wells to their next destination. They will include valves and control mechanisms for the valves, and diving work mostly involves inspection and maintenance work, but can also include installation and repair, and connecting in new <b>wellheads.</b>|$|R

25|$|A ram blowout {{preventer}} {{is a large}} valve that can seal off a <b>wellhead</b> by using ram-types employing steel cut off rams to seal the borehole. During drilling or well interventions, the valve may be closed if overpressure from an underground zone causes formation fluids such as oil or natural gas to enter the wellbore and threaten the rig. In 1922, James Smither Abercrombie collaborated with Harry S. Cameron {{with the idea of}} creating a mechanically operated ram-type {{blowout preventer}}. A patent was issued in January 1926.|$|E
25|$|An annular blowout {{preventer}} {{is a large}} valve that uses a wedge to seal off a <b>wellhead.</b> It has a donut-like rubber seal, known as an elastomeric packing unit, reinforced with steel ribs. During drilling or well interventions, the valve may be closed if overpressure from an underground zone causes formation fluids such as oil or natural gas to enter the wellbore and threaten the rig. The annular {{blowout preventer}} was invented by Granville Sloan Knox in 1946 who received a patent on September 9, 1952.|$|E
25|$|In its March 1949 report, the Dinning Commission {{supported}} {{the principle that}} Albertans should have first call on provincial natural gas supplies, and that Canadians should have priority over foreign users if an exportable surplus developed. Alberta accepted {{the recommendations of the}} Dinning Commission, and later declared it would only authorize exports of gas in excess of a 30-year supply. Shortly thereafter, Alberta's Legislature passed the Gas Resources Conservation Act, which gave Alberta greater control over natural gas at the <b>wellhead,</b> and empowered the Oil and Gas Conservation Board to issue export permits.|$|E

25|$|In {{fighting}} {{a fire at}} a directly vertical spewing <b>wellhead,</b> high explosives, such as dynamite were {{used to create a}} blast wave that pushes the burning fuel and local atmospheric oxygen away from the well. (This is a similar principle to blowing out a candle.) The flame is removed and the fuel can continue to spill out without igniting. Generally, explosives were placed within 55 gallon drums, the explosives surrounded by fire retardant chemicals, and then the drums are wrapped with insulating material with a horizontal crane being used to bring the drum as close to the burning area as possible.|$|E
25|$|Natural-gas {{processing}} {{begins at}} the well head. The composition of the raw natural gas extracted from producing wells depends on the type, depth, and location of the underground deposit and the geology of the area. Oil and natural gas are often found {{together in the same}} reservoir. The natural gas produced from oil wells is generally classified as associated-dissolved, meaning that the natural gas is associated with or dissolved in crude oil. Natural gas production absent any association with crude oil is classified as “non-associated.” In 2009, 89 percent of U.S. <b>wellhead</b> production of natural gas was non-associated.|$|E
25|$|The {{completion}} {{of this project}} was a spectacular technological achievement. In {{the first three years}} of construction (1956–58), workers installed 3,500 kilometres of pipe, stretching from the Alberta-Saskatchewan border to Toronto and Montreal. Gas service to Regina and Winnipeg commenced in 1957 and the line reached the Lakehead before the end of that year. In late 1957, during a high pressure line test on the section of the line from Winnipeg to Port Arthur (today called Thunder Bay), about five and a half kilometres of pipeline blew up near Dryden. After quick repairs, the line delivered Alberta gas to Port Arthur before the end of the year, making the entire trip on its own <b>wellhead</b> pressure.|$|E
50|$|A well bay {{is an area}} of an oil {{platform}} where the Christmas trees and <b>wellheads</b> are located. It normally consists of two levels, a lower where the <b>wellheads</b> are accessed and an upper where the Xmas Trees are accessed often along with the various well control panels, which will have pressure gauges and controls for the hydraulically actuated valves, including downhole safety valve and annular safety valve. On a platform with a drilling package, the well bay will be located directly below it to facilitate access for drilling and well interventions.|$|R

25|$|The IPL line {{fundamentally}} {{changed the}} pricing of Alberta oil {{to make it}} sensitive to international rather than regional factors. The <b>wellhead</b> price reflected {{the price of oil}} at Sarnia, less pipeline tolls for shipping it there. IPL is by far the longest crude oil pipeline in the western hemisphere. Looping, or constructing additional lines beside the original, expanded the Interprovincial system and allowed its extension into the American midwest and to upstate New York. In 1976, it was 3,680 kilometres through an extension to Montreal. Although it helped assure security of supply in the 1970s, the extension became a threat to Canadian oil producers after deregulation in 1985. With Montreal refineries using cheaper imported oil, there was concern within the industry that a proposal to use the line to bring foreign oil into Sarnia might undermine traditional markets for Western Canadian petroleum.|$|E
25|$|The {{water supply}} for the canal {{originates}} {{to the south}} of Wendover in surface springs and artesian wells near <b>Wellhead</b> Farm and the grade II* listed church of St Mary, which is constructed of flint rubble and blocks of stone. Much of it dates from the fourteenth century, although it was heavily restored in 1839 and 1869. The water flows northwards through the town, past a former water mill, which was operational until 1923, but was converted into a house between 1929 and 1931. It enters Wendover Basin, the start of the canal, where the flow is monitored by a gauging station. Records of the flows exist for the period between 1841 and 1897, and from 1963 onwards, making it the earliest known set of such records in the United Kingdom. The canal runs in a northerly direction, with a towpath on the western bank, and is crossed by a footbridge {{at the site of the}} branch line to Halton Camp. The start of a channel which connects the canal to Weston Turville reservoir is marked by a paddle on the towpath. The reservoir, which is a designated nature reserve, covers , and is used for fishing and by Aylesbury Boat Club for sailing.|$|E
500|$|Shots {{of the oil}} {{refinery}} seen in the episode were filmed at a thermal energy station situated in Port Moody, British Columbia.
