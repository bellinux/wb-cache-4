As such, voltage stability may become a concern in certain periods for power system operation particularly in weaker areas of the network. Thus, it is of importance to consider the AC constraints for optimal wind generation planning (long term) in order to decrease the possibility of a <b>wind</b> <b>capacity</b> allocation that requires costly remedies from the power system operation perspective (short term). In this work, a procedure is proposed for <b>wind</b> <b>capacity</b> allocation with the aim of benefiting from the potential of an optimal <b>wind</b> <b>capacity</b> allocation for enhancing the voltage stability margin. The procedure is based on a multi operating conditions voltage stability constrained optimal power flow. The <b>wind</b> <b>capacity</b> target is set and the loadability margin is tracked. The results will show the applicability of the proposed procedure and will emphasize the effects of the pattern of <b>wind</b> <b>capacity</b> allocation on the loadability margin.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the benefits of}} optimal spatial diversification of <b>wind</b> <b>capacity</b> as an option to reduce wind curtailment and, therefore, to increase the utilization of <b>wind</b> <b>capacity.</b> <b>Wind</b> generation concentrated at sites with the highest energy capture, once aggregated, does not utilize the installed <b>wind</b> <b>capacity</b> at the highest possible rate due to wind curtailment. Contrary to the expectations, wind generation at sites with lower energy capture but with wind generation patterns that minimize wind curtailment results in a higher utilization of installed <b>wind</b> <b>capacity.</b> Such a configuration requires an optimization scheme to model power system flexibility and wind generation and to allocate capacity {{with the objective of}} maximizing the utilization of <b>wind</b> <b>capacity,</b> defined by the term “effective capacity factor”, CFE, (i. e. average system wide wind generation less curtailment, divided by installed capacity.) In order to measure the benefits of optimal spatial configuration of <b>wind</b> <b>capacity,</b> a base-case configuration is defined which approximates the dominant trend in the wind industry. In the base-case configuration, capacity is allocated to sites in the order of their energy capture (capacity factor) until the capacity limit for the selected sites are reached. The improvement of CFE in the optimal configuration over the base-case configuration is then used as a measure to quantify and illustrate the benefits of optimal spatial diversification. The results of this study show that the CFE of the installed <b>wind</b> <b>capacity</b> in the system improves by 2 % to 4 % in the optimally diversified configuration at low levels of wind penetration (10 % to 20 %) and subject to moderate to strict power system generation constraints. For medium levels of wind penetration (20 % to 30 %), there is no observed benefits since ramping complications fade away at higher levels of penetration. At high levels of penetration (25 % to 40 %), the minimum generation level constraint results in 5 % to 10 % CFE improvement in the optimally diversified configuration. Storage is modeled in the system, as an alternative method of comparing the optimal and basecase configurations. The storage capacity that would be saved by optimally diversifying the <b>wind</b> <b>capacity</b> is determined for different levels of <b>wind</b> <b>capacity</b> installations and subject to varying levels of power system flexibility. Power system generation flexibility is modeled by two key parameters of minimum generation level and ramping capability. The benefits of optimal configuration over the business-as-usual base-case configuration are significant at low and high levels of wind penetration whereas the benefits are almost absent at medium levels of wind penetration. This is explained by the role that the key parameters of the generation fleet play at different levels of penetration...|$|R

40|$|Global {{primary energy}} demand {{is likely to}} {{increase}} by half between 2015 and the middle of the 21 st century, which will require new energy capacity to cover growth in consumption. Current primary energy supply is dominated by fossil fuels. These sources are limited in quantity and are unevenly distributed on our planet. Additionally, burning fossil fuels creates a negative externality, causing global warming. The international community has agreed, that increased use of fossil fuels to tackle future energy deficit is unsustainable in the long run. Wind power is an unlimited, clean energy resource, which in theory could partly solve the problem of energy shortage.

40|$|The {{installed}} capacity and the grid access request for renewables is anticipated to continue {{rising in the}} EU and US in the coming years. The scarcity of reactive power and synchronous inertia are two inherent consequences of high penetration of renewables in the power system. This raises voltage security concerns, and may endanger rotor angle and frequency stability. In order to foresee these challenges, {{it is essential to}} carry out extensive planning and operation studies. Thus, new methodologies and innovative metrics are required to ensure secure and reliable operation of power systems. In this thesis, a multi-operating condition AC voltage stability constraint optimal power flow framework has been presented for transmission system planning. This framework captures multiple wind and demand operating conditions within an optimal power flow tool. The voltage stability constrained optimal power flow was applied to <b>wind</b> <b>capacity</b> allocation. It was shown that the capacity allocation pattern affects steady state voltage stability and the total allocated <b>wind</b> <b>capacity.</b> This indicates that a well-chosen allocation of <b>wind</b> <b>capacity</b> is not only in line with the trend of renewables integration in power systems but also enables limiting the occurrence probability of insecure operating points that may require costly remedies. A procedure for <b>wind</b> <b>capacity</b> allocation has been presented based on the finding on the effects of the pattern of <b>wind</b> <b>capacity</b> allocation on voltage stability. This benefits from the potential of an optimal <b>wind</b> <b>capacity</b> allocation for enhancing the voltage stability margin. Unit commitment was employed {{to take into account the}} reduction of the available reactive power sources at each operating condition for <b>wind</b> <b>capacity</b> allocation. By setting the <b>wind</b> <b>capacity</b> target and tracking the loadability margin, it was shown how the risk for a reduction in loadability margin may increase with allocation of wind generation. This procedure showed that specific locations in the system are favored for capacity allocation. It also identified weak areas in the network that experience a reduction in the loadability margin as a result of the allocation of the <b>wind</b> <b>capacity.</b> The methodology can help system operators prioritize network access and investment in the network to enhance the integration of renewables. Further, this thesis focused on the power system frequency aspect of renewables integration. Synchronous inertia acts as a means of immediate frequency support in power imbalances. Renewables often inject power into the network through power electronic converters. As such, synchronizing torque and synchronous inertia are not available in the power from renewables. Reduced levels of synchronizing torque raise concerns on rotor speed behavior under power imbalance events. The interaction of generators has been investigated by deriving the synchronizing torque coefficient matrix from the multi-machine Heffron-Philips model. It was shown that the reactive power output of the generators can be used to control the elements of the synchronizing torque coefficient matrix. It was identified that the varying levels of synchronizing torque affect the rate of change rotor speed of generators following a loss of generation event. Furthermore, the effect of rotor speed deviation due to synchronizing torque was presented from the system frequency perspective. This provides a foundation for system operators to establish strategies that benefit from the synchronizing torque coefficient matrix characteristics for controlling the frequency behavior...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAccommodating {{variable}} wind power poses a critical challenge for electric power {{systems that are}} heavily dependent on combined-heat-and-power (CHP) plants, {{as is the case}} for north China. Pumped hydro storage (PHS) and electric boilers (EBs) are two of the strongest technological options under discussion in China to address this challenge, but rigorous quantitative analyses of their effectiveness rooted in actual system data are lacking. An improved unit-commitment based power system chronological simulation is applied to evaluate potential benefits from PHS and EBs in West Inner Mongolia (WIM), where CHP capacity is projected to increase to 33. 8 GW by 2020. A business-as-usual (BAU) reference model assumes deployment of 20 GW of <b>wind</b> <b>capacity.</b> Compared to BAU, expanding <b>wind</b> <b>capacity</b> to 40 GW would allow for a reduction in CO 2 emissions of 33. 9 million tons, but at a relatively high cost of US$ 25. 3 /ton, reflecting primarily high associated curtailment of wind electricity (20. 4 %).

Our analysis uses data from two different electric grids in the US with similar levels of installed <b>wind</b> <b>capacity</b> but with large differences in wind and load forecast accuracy, due to geographic characteristics.
