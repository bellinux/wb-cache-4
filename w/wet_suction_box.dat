40|$|The {{underlying}} {{motives of}} the research undertaken here are twofold: to obtain {{a deeper understanding of}} the dewatering mechanisms at the forming section of a papermaking machine and to develop numerical models that describe the flow through forming fabrics. More comprehensive knowledge of dewatering in the forming section allows suggestions to be made for improvements that reduce the amount of energy used in the process without affecting the quality of the end product.   The objective of this thesis is to answer the following questions: How and why does rewetting occur at the high vacuum <b>suction</b> <b>boxes?</b> How does the structure of the forming fabric affect dewatering at the forming section? Is it possible to create accurate numerical models for forming fabrics, and can these be used to predict the dewatering behaviour of new types of fabrics?   Laboratory and pilot studies simulating high vacuum <b>suction</b> <b>boxes</b> were performed together with numerical modelling of the flow of air and water through both the forming fabric and the paper sheet.   The conclusion drawn from the pilot study is that rewetting significantly lowers the dryness of the paper sheet exiting the <b>suction</b> <b>boxes.</b> The phenomenon is extremely rapid and is most likely driven by capillary forces. The high speed at which this rewetting occurs makes it difficult to impede by placing the <b>suction</b> <b>boxes</b> closer to the couch pick-up: the solution is more likely to be the use of new and improved designs of the forming fabric. The structure of the forming fabric has been shown to affect the dewatering rate at certain conditions of vacuum dewatering, and can possibly be connected partly to the fact that fibres penetrate the surface of the fabric to varying degrees and partly to the flow resistance of the different fabric structures. Numerical models of high accuracy can be constructed and used to predetermine how new fabric designs would affect dewatering at the forming section.   This thesis quantifies aspects of dewatering such as rewetting and the influence of the forming fabric. Understanding these dewatering aspects further provides for the potential enhancement of energy efficiency in the forming section, and thereby the entire papermaking process. The forming fabric can play an important role in improving energy efficiency: rewetting after the high vacuum <b>suction</b> <b>boxes</b> occurs more rapidly than was previously known, so its design might be the only possible way of impeding it. The forming fabric can also improve the rate of dewatering: it is therefore likely that its design will be important in the next stage of developing energy efficiency and thereby play a part in achieving a more sustainable future.

40|$|In {{previous}} studies {{it has been}} corroborated that rewetting occurs after <b>suction</b> <b>boxes</b> and couch rolls. A certain amount of water is left in the forming fabric after the suction zone, resulting in external rewetting which decreases the dry content of the web with 3 - 5 % - units. In the present work different super absorbents with high absorption capacity were used with the intension to absorb the water left in the forming fabric after a suction pulse before it flowed back into the web. First the possibility of reducing rewetting was investigated in laboratory scale. A super absorbent was placed underneath the forming fabric and the web in a laboratory <b>suction</b> <b>box</b> during a <b>suction</b> pulse. A number of different absorbents were tested and several of them did significantly reduce the rewetting of the web.

40|$|In {{previous}} studies on <b>suction</b> <b>box</b> dewatering, three mechanisms were identified that determine the dry {{content of a}} web, viz. web compression, displacement of water by air and rewetting. In the present work, {{the relative importance of}} the three mechanisms was investigated through direct measurement of the web deformation, the dry content changes during and after the suction pulse, the air flow through the fibre network and the saturation of the web after the suction pulse. Suction pressure, suction time and rewetting time were varied. The experiments were done with chemical and mechanical pulp webs of various grammages. It was found that a large web deformation took place during the suction pulse, particularly at its beginning. Compression dewatering was found to be the most dominant dewatering mechanism. Displacement dewatering started after most of the web compression had occurred. Its contribution to the increase in dry content was most pronounced for higher suction pressures, longer suction times and for chemical pulp webs. A surprisingly large expansion of the web was observed immediately after the suction pulse. This expansion was the effect of rewetting. This rewetting strongly reduced the dry content of the web if the web had not been immediately separated from the forming fabric {{at the end of the}} suction pulse. Under the conditions studied, the decrease in dry content amounted to the order of 3 to 6 %. Rewetting was smaller for longer suction times and higher suction pressures. A considerable air flow through the web occurred under these conditions. This air flow apparently moved water from the forming fabric into the <b>suction</b> <b>box,</b> thus making less water available for rewetting. Rewetting for mechanical pulp webs was more pronounced and took place faster than for chemical pulps. The use of a membrane on top of the web during <b>suction</b> <b>box</b> dewatering proved to be advantageous for reducing the air flow through the web. However, under the conditions investigated, the dry content could not be improved. Although the web compression was increased when using a membrane, especially at a higher suction pressure, rewetting after the suction pulse had an even larger negative impact on the dry content, which, as a result, was lower.

In unsaturated specimens sheared at a constant water content, a hardening stress-strain relationship and volumetric contractions are observed in the considered range of net mean stresses. The suction of the soil contributed little to the apparent cohesion. The angle of friction appeared to be independent of the suction.

However, grass-induced suction in the ground when it is subjected to wetting and drying are not yet well understood. In this study, a laboratory test program was conducted to investigate the magnitude and distribution of suction induced by Bermuda grass growing in silty sand. In total, four test boxes compacted with silty sand were prepared, three of which covered with Bermuda grass while one test box was left bare as control. All the four test boxes were subjected to wetting and drying in a plant room with temperature and humidity controlled. Under identical atmospheric conditions and initial soil density and water content, peak suction induced within the root zone in grassed soil was 1. 5 times higher than that in bare soil after 20 days of drying.

Thisthesis is aimed at studying the pressure distribution in bladeforming sections, which is commonly {{considered to be a}} keyquantity of the process. Previous work has provided insight into the physics ofdifferent devices employed in blade forming. However, there hasbeen a lack of models enabling studies of the effects of theinteraction between different components on the pressuredistribution. In the thesis, a model is presented for a genericblade forming section consisting of three blades. The positionsof two of the blades are fix, and in between them is located asuction box. The third blade is applied by a prescribed forceto the opposing wire, in a position facing the <b>suction</b> <b>box.</b> Themodel admits the study of the interaction between the pulsesfrom the different blades in the blade/counterbladeconfiguration, and between the pulses and one-sidedsuction. The wires are modelled as tensioned and perfectly flexibleEuler-Bernoulli beams of negligible mass. The suspension istreated like an inviscid fluid. Consideration is taken to theinfluence of fibre deposition on the permeability of thefabrics. By assuming the ratio between the length scales in thethickness direction and the machine direction to be small, aquasi one-dimensional model is obtained. For maximum flexibility, the model domain is divided intomodules. Each module is solved individually using a finitedifference based discretisation. The solutions for thedifferent modules are matched with each other iteratively. A comparison with published results for a single bladeindicates that the model can be used to obtain qualitativelycorrect predictions of the pressure distribution. New resultsinclude a series of calculations showing the non-trivialinteraction between the pressure pulses when the blades arepositioned successively closer together, the effects of suctionon the pressure pulse generated by a blade applied to theopposing wire, and how blades of modest curvature do notnecessarily stay in contact with the fabric along their fullwidth and the implication of this on the pressure gradient.

Field-measured and empirically-estimated infiltration parameters were compared. Field saturated hydraulic conductivity (Kfs) values were calculated with an inverse Green-Ampt equation using infiltration data measured in three vegetated filter plots located near Mead Nebraska. Also, three pedotransfer functions (PTFs) were used to empirically generate average Kfs values for each plot, based on percent sand, percent clay, and bulk density. Pedotransfer functions underestimated Kfs (10 to 99 percent) compared to field-measured values. Using VFSMOD to replicate actual field scenarios, more runoff (up to 62 percent) from the filter was predicted with the PTF Kfs input values than with the field-measured input Kfs values. These results were compared to data from overland flow studies performed on these plots in July 2004. Using the field-measured Kfs values resulted in the closest match for model water trapping predictions (in 2 of the 3 plots). Water trapping was more sensitive to Kfs than was sediment trapping, even at a higher sediment loading rate. Neither water trapping nor sediment trapping was sensitive to changes in <b>wetting</b> front <b>suction</b> or initial water content.

40|$|International audienceThe Callovo-Oxfordian (COx) {{claystone}} {{is considered}} in France {{as a possible}} host rock for the disposal of high-level long-lived radioactive waste at great depth. During the operational phase, {{the walls of the}} galleries and of the disposal cells will be successively subjected to desaturation induced by ventilation followed by resaturation once the galleries are closed. To better understand this phenomenon, a sound understanding of the water retention properties of the COx claystone is necessary. Following a previous study by the same group, this paper presents an investigation of microstructure changes in COx claystone under suction changes. Microstructure was investigated by means of mercury intrusion porosimetry tests on freeze-dried specimens previously submitted to various suctions. Along the drying path, the initial microstructure, characterised by a well-classified unimodal pore population around a mean diameter value of 32 nm, slightly changed with the same shape of the PSD curve and slightly moved towards smaller diameters (27 – 28 nm) at suctions of 150 and 331 MPa, respectively. The infra-porosity too small to be intruded by mercury (diameter smaller than 5. 5 nm) reduced from 4. 3 to 3. 3 %. Oven drying reduced the mean diameter to 20 nm and the infra-porosity to 1 %. Wetting up to 9 MPa suction leads to saturation with no significant change in the PSD curve, whereas <b>wetting</b> at zero <b>suction</b> gave rise to the appearance of a large pore population resulting from the development of cracks with width of several micrometres, together with an enlargement of the initial pore population above the mean diameter. The concepts describing the step hydration of smectites (by the successive placement within the clay platelets along the smectite faces of 1, 2, 3 and 4 layers of water molecules with respect to the suction applied) appeared relevant to better understand the changes in microstructure of the COx claystone under suction changes. This also allowed to better define the status of water in claystones and shales containing smectite, with a distinction made between the water adsorbed within the clay platelets, and the free inter-platelet water involved in hydromechanical couplings through changes in pore pressure and water transfers...|$|R

Now it has gained its reputation in the diagnostic work up of soft tissue tumors as well. In o ur study we assessed a total of 252 cases of soft tissue tumors by Fine Needle aspiration cytology {{during a period of}} two years 2009 - 2011 and the patients were followed up for biopsies for histopathological correlation. The initial diagnosis of many mass lesions, both superficial and deep - seated, can often be readily and safely assessed by FNAC. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: 1. To study the age, sex and site - wise distribution of soft tissue tumors. 2. To assess the role of Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology in diagnos ing various types of soft tissue tumors. 3. To assess the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and overall histological correlation percentage of Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology in diagnosing soft tissue tumors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Aspirations were done using a 22 gauge disposable needle and a 10 c. c disposable syringe for <b>suction.</b> <b>Wet</b> - fixed smears with isopropyl alcohol were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Dry - fixed smears were stained with May - Grunwald Giemsa were stud ied for cytological details and diagnosis. The excised surgical specimen and biopsies of the above cases were processed routinely and stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin. RESULTS: Total 252 cases were studied from Aug 2009 to July 2011 retrospectively. Out of these we received excised specimen and biopsies for 216 cases. Rema i ning 36 cases were excluded in our study as we could not trace the patient for biopsies. 180 were diagnosed as benign soft tissue tumors, while 36 were diagnosed as malignant on cytolog ical examination. The median age of benign soft tissue tumors was 35 years, while that of malignant soft tissue tumors was 40 years. Prevalence was highest in the age group of 21 - 40 years, during which majority were benign lesions. Soft tissue tumors were m ore common in the lower extremities with predominant benign tumors, while malignant tumors were more common in the trunk. Sex wise distribution showed a male: female ratio of 1. 18 : 1, indicating that they were more common in males. The most common tumors we re lipomas, followed by Hemangiomas and peripheral nerve sheath tumors. A comparative analysis was done between the cytology report and histopathology. CONCLUSION: Final evaluation of the results showed that the diagnostic accuracy of FNAC of soft tissue t umors according to the present study was 95. 37...|$|R
40|$|Climate change, {{which leads}} to more intense precipitation, {{combined}} with an increase of impervious surface, due to an increase of urbanization, has resulted in an increasing amount of stormwater entering the sewer system. This increase will lead to heavier loads on the existing sewer system, which in most cases already are overloaded, resulting in more frequent surface flooding causing damage to buildings and infrastructure. To improve this situation, there has lately {{been an increase in}} focusing on a sustainable stormwater management, which is based on Sustainable urban drainage systems, SUDS. One measure, which is considered used by multiple municipalities, is downspout disconnection. This measure is rarely used to day, and there is therefore little information about the effect of this measure. Usually the downspouts are connected to the sewer system and the surface water generated from the roof is therefore directly entering the sewer system. The runoff from the roof is usually generated very fast, and gives thus a great contribution to the amount of stormwater in the sewer system. This can easily be reduced by disconnecting the downspouts and lead the water to an appropriate infiltration surface. The effect of this measure is closely connected to the soils ability to infiltrate water, and it is therefore difficult to predict the reduction of stormwater without conducting field investigations. To be able to investigate the effect of downspout disconnection, and as a tool for making it easier to see if an area is suited for this measure or not, it has therefore ben established a MATLAB- model, in this thesis, which computes the amount of infiltrated water and the amount of generated runoff at each site. The MATLAB- model calculates with both using the Green-Ampt infiltration model and the Philip infiltration model, and was used to calculate the amount of infiltration and runoff at eleven sites in Oslo and four sites in Trondheim. In Oslo, the results showed a variation in the amount of infiltrated water. The best conditions for downspout disconnection was seen at site B 28, L 34, R 44, R 5 and S 75. At these sites it is suggested that the soil is capable to infiltrate the amount of generated stormwater without further measures. The sites in Trondheim showed all great conditions for infiltration, but because {{of the size of the}} infiltration area and the location, was site 3 and 4 preferred. To be able to see how different soil parameters affects the amount of infiltration, some simulations where done by changing some of the soil parameters. These simulations showed that the amount of infiltration is dependent on the soils saturated hydraulic conductivity, the initial soil moisture content and the <b>wetting</b> front capillary <b>suction</b> head. Because of this dependence, it is recommended that these parameters are measured at the site, and it is important that especially the Ksar- value is measured at multiple points at the site in order to obtain a representative value. By comparing the soil types at the sites and the ratio between the size of the roof area and the size of the infiltration area, the following is suggested. If the soil at the site is sandy and the infiltration area is one to twice as big as the roof area, it can be assumed that the infiltration capacity is good enough to infiltrate the amount of generated stormwater. Silty soil covers however a rather large range of Ksat- values depending on the percentage of silt in the soil, and the Ksat- value of the site should therefore be measured. Dependent on the soils ability to infiltrate water, it may be enough that the infiltration area is one to twice as big as the roof area, but this should be considered especially if the soils saturated hydraulic conductivity is of the lower value. The same yield also for a soil with a very high clay content. Whether this soil has a large enough infiltration capacity or not is dependent on the percentage of silt and sand fraction in the soil. The calculations done in this thesis shows also that for a site with a very high clay content, and thus a low Ksat- value, it is recommended to use an infiltration area three times or more, as big as the size of the roof area. The establishment of this model will help to develop downspout disconnection as a measure for stormwater managing, especially in residential areas. The results obtained in this thesis, shows that by disconnecting the downspouts from the sewer system, the reduction of amount of stormwater can be significant, where the soil properties are adequate. Downspout disconnection is therefore evaluated as a measure that should be considered in areas where stormwater management is a challenge...|$|R
