He spent Christmas that year on Crete with Muto, before his studies at Bryn Mawr came to an end in 1988 [...] He was awarded his degree on 15 May, after which Muto whisked him off for a holiday in Cancún, Mexico.|$|E
500|$|... "Thank you, mister President-elect, for {{inviting}} me to your inauguration gala. I {{would like to take}} a moment from this very public ceremony to speak of something very personal. It concerns a dear friend of mine who is no longer with us. His name is Ryan White. He was a hemophiliac who was diagnosed <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>AIDS</b> <b>virus</b> when he was eleven. He died shortly after turning eighteen, the very time most young people are beginning to explore life's wonderful possibilities. My friend Ryan was a very bright, very brave, and very normal young man who never wanted to be a symbol or a spokesperson for a deadly disease. Over the years, I've shared many silly, happy, and painful moments with Ryan and I was with him {{at the end of his}} brief but eventful journey. Ryan is gone and just as anyone who has lost a loved one to AIDS, I miss him deeply and constantly. He is gone, but I want his life to have meaning beyond his passing. It is my hope, President-elect Clinton, that you and your administration commit the resources needed to eliminate this awful disease that took my friend, and ended so many promising lives before their time. This song is for you Ryan". - Michael Jackson, January 1993.|$|E
2500|$|Attachment occurs <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> of <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> σ1 protein. This is a {{filamentous}} trimer {{protein that}} projects {{out of the}} outer capsid of the virus. There are two receptors for the virus on the host cell. There is the junctional adhesion molecule-A, which is a serotype-independent receptor {{as well as the}} sialic acid coreceptor. Viral proteins μ1 and σ3 [...] are responsible for attachment by binding to the receptors. After the attachment to the receptors, entry to the host cell occurs via receptor-mediated endocytosis through <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> of clathrin coated pits.|$|R
40|$|Although {{anti-virus}} software has significantly {{evolved over the}} last decade, classic signature matching based on byte patterns is still a prevalent concept for identifying security threats. Anti-virus signatures are a simple and fast detection mechanism that can complement more sophisticated analysis strategies. However, if signatures are not designed with care, they can turn from a defensive mechanism into an instrument of attack. In this paper, we present a novel method for automatically deriving signatures from {{anti-virus software}} and demonstrate how the extracted signatures {{can be used to}} attack sensible data <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> of <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> scanner itself. We study the practicability of our approach using four commercial products and exemplarily discuss a novel attack vector made possible by insufficiently designed signatures. Our research indicates that there is an urgent need to improve pattern-based signatures if used in anti-virus software and to pursue alternative detection approaches in such products...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{here the}} successful {{establishment of a}} reverse genetics system for rotavirus (RV), {{a member of the}} Reoviridae family whose genome consists of 10 – 12 segmented dsRNA. The system is based on the recombinant vaccinia virus T 7 RNA polymerase-driven procedure for supplying artificial viral mRNA in <b>the</b> cytoplasm. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> of helper <b>virus</b> (human RV strain KU) infection, intracellularly transcribed full-length VP 4 mRNA of simian RV strain SA 11 resulted in the rescue of the KU-based transfectant virus carrying the SA 11 VP 4 RNA segment derived from cDNA. In addition to the rescued transfectant virus <b>with</b> <b>the</b> authentic SA 11 VP 4 gene, three more infectious RV transfectants, into which silent mutation(s) were introduced to destroy both or one of the two restriction enzyme sites as gene markers in the SA 11 VP 4 genome, were also rescued <b>with</b> this method. <b>The</b> ability to artificially manipulate the RV genome will greatly increase the understanding of the replication and the pathogenicity of RV and will provide a tool for the design of attenuated vaccine vectors...|$|R

40|$|The plasma {{membrane}} {{of the mouse}} peritoneal macrophage has specific receptors which enable the cell to bind IgG or complement-coated sheep red cells and is also rich in a divalent cation-dependent adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) activity. L cells lack these macrophage membrane markers. The question of macrophage membrane receptor expression was investigated in DBA/ 2 mouse macrophage x mouse LMTK- cell hybrids produced <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> of Sendai <b>virus.</b> Three independent clones and one mass culture were isolated by their ability to grow in hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine (HAT) selection medium. These hybrids retained 85 – 100 % of the sum of two parent cells' chromosomes and expressed several genes derived from both parents, including glucose phosphate isomerase isozymes and H- 2 antigens. The hybrids displayed ATPase activity which was intermediate between that of the macrophage and L cell. The macrophage specific receptors for antibody or complement-coated red cells could not be demonstrated on hybrid cells. The selective absence of these receptors is probably because of a failure in gene expression rather than to loss of genes...|$|R
40|$|Homologous cytosol was {{introduced}} into 3 T 3 -L 1 cells by two different methods. Erythrocytes loaded with radiolabelled cytosolic proteins extracted from 3 T 3 -L 1 cells were fused <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> of Sendai <b>virus</b> to 3 T 3 -L 1 cells, {{which were then}} seeded to confluent and non-confluent cultures. Cytosolic proteins were also introduced into cells by the technique of scrape-loading. In confluent cells, injected cytosolic proteins were recovered largely (54 - 93 %) in a sedimentable (6 X 10 (6) gav. -min) fraction from recipient cells irrespective of the method of introduction or of radiolabelling of the injected proteins [(125 I]iodination, reductive methylation with NaB 3 H 4 and backbone labelling with L-[4, 5 - 3 H]leucine). The degradation of microinjected cytosolic proteins was in all cases inhibited by the lysosomotropic agent NH 4 Cl {{to a greater extent}} (32 - 75 %) than that observed for endogenous cytosolic (less than or equal to 19 %) proteins (labelled with L-[4, 5 - 3 H]leucine). In growing cells both endogenous total cell proteins and microinjected proteins were degraded at a slower rate than in confluent cell monolayers. The inhibition by NH 4 Cl of the degradation of both the endogenous and microinjected proteins is decreased compared <b>with</b> <b>the</b> inhibition observed in confluent monolayers. The results are discussed in terms of the cytoplasmic capacity to segregate microinjected homologous proteins before protein degradation can take place...|$|R
40|$|Background: Adenovirus {{serotype}} 5 (Ad 5) {{has many}} favourable characteristics for {{development as a}} gene therapy vector. However, the utility of current Ad 5 vectors is limited by transient transgene expression, toxicity and immunogenicity. The most promising form of vector is the high capacity type, which is deleted for all viral genes. However, these vectors can only be produced to relatively low titres and <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> of helper <b>virus.</b> Therefore a continuing challenge is the generation of more effective Ad 5 vectors that can still be grown to high titres. Our approach is to generate complementing cell lines to support the growth of Ad 5 vectors with novel late gene deficiencies. Results: We have used LoxP/Cre recombination mediated cassette exchange (RMCE) to generate cell lines expressing Ad 5 proteins encoded by the L 4 region of the genome, the products of which play {{a pivotal role in}} the expression of Ad 5 structural proteins. A panel of LoxP parent 293 cell lines was generated, each containing a GFP expression cassette under the control of a tetracycline-regulated promoter inserted at a random genome location; the cassette also contained a LoxP site between the promoter and GFP sequence. Clones displayed a variety of patterns of regulation, stability and level of GFP expression. Clone A 1 was identified as a suitable parent for creation of inducible cell lines because of the tight inducibility and stability of its GFP expression. Using LoxPtargeted...|$|R

Using LoxP-targeted, Cre recombinase-mediated insertion of an L 4 cassette to displace GFP from the regulated promoter in this parent clone, cell line A 1 -L 4 was generated. This cell line expressed L 4 100 K, 22 K and 33 K proteins at levels sufficient to complement L 4 - 33 K mutant and L 4 -deleted viruses. Conclusions RMCE provides a method for rapid generation of Ad 5 complementing cell lines from a pre-selected parental cell line, chosen for its desirable transgene expression characteristics. Parent cell lines can be selected for high or low gene expression, and for tight regulation, allowing viral protein expression to mirror that found during infection. Cell lines derived from a single parent will allow the growth of different vectors to be assessed without the complication of varying complementing protein expression...|$|R
