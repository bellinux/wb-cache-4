5|$|Gowing {{attempted}} to negotiate better {{conditions at the}} University of Kent that would allow more {{time to work on}} the books, but this was denied. She applied for a vacant chair in the History and Philosophy of Science at University College London in 1970, without success. Then, in February 1972, Sir Rudolf Peierls and Nicholas Kurti informed her that the University of Oxford had created a new chair in the history of science, {{the first of its kind}} in the university's long history. She did not expect to get the chair, but Peierls, Sir Frederick Dainton and Hugh Trevor-Roper were on the selection panel, and in the end offered the chair in the history of science to Gowing, a <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not have a degree in history or science.|$|E
5|$|According to Haga, the story's main {{theme was}} saving Elena from the curse and then {{returning}} to a normal life. The world design, narrative complexity and number of characters was {{kept to a minimum}} so players would have their attention directed upon the main characters' plight. When developing the characters, Haga wanted players to relate easily to Aeron, and he was developed to become not too outspoken or assertive. The character Elena was present from the beginning of development, but due to the negative feedback of testers, Elena needed to undergo a major overhaul, including redesigning her monster transformation so that players would sympathize better with her condition, and all the dialogue and cutscenes involving her being redone from scratch. As a result of these developments, the character was portrayed as a strong-willed <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not want to be a burden on Aeron despite her condition, in addition to helping him rather than just letting him handle the entire quest. Mavda and her husband were designed to contrast with the relationship between Aeron and Elena: while they looked odd, they were in fact a devoted couple similar to the main protagonists. Her design originated from the initial ideas for the game's merchant, who would have a large pack on their back. She was compared by Haga to cynical witches found in traditional European fairy tales.|$|E
25|$|Induced lactation, {{also called}} adoptive lactation, {{is the process}} of {{starting}} breastfeeding in a <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not give birth. This usually requires the adoptive mother to take hormones and other drugs to stimulate breast development and promote milk production. In some cultures, breastfeeding an adoptive child creates milk kinship that built community bonds across class and other hierarchal bonds.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} {{factors related}} to reproductive decision-making among HIV-infected women. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A sample of HIV-infected <b>women</b> (N= 104) <b>who</b> received care at an HIV clinic in the southern United States were interviewed about their reproductive decision-making. <b>Women</b> <b>who</b> became pregnant subsequent to HIV diagnosis were compared to <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not become pregnant, and <b>women</b> <b>who</b> underwent a sterilization procedure subsequent to HIV diagnosis were compared to <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not get sterilized. RESULTS: Compared to <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not get pregnant after receiving an HIV diagnosis, <b>women</b> <b>who</b> became pregnant {{were more likely to}} be young, single, diagnosed earlier in the epidemic and to have more recently used a noninjecting drug. Among <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not get pregnant, 63 % reported their diagnosis greatly affected that decision. Having a partner who wants more children was not associated with pregnancy. Compared to <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not get sterilized after learning their HIV status, <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> get sterilized tended to be Baptist and already had a prior live birth. Neither a woman's desire nor her partner's desire for more children was associated with sterilization. CONCLUSIONS: HIV is an important influence on HIV-infected women's reproductive choices, regardless of the decision being made. Reproductive counseling by HIV care providers needs to be sensitive to all the issues faced by these women...|$|R

At the age of 20, or in his late adolescent years, around 1755, he moved to Constantinople. In al-Jazzar's biography by Volney in Voyage, al-Jazzar fled Bosnia at the age of 16 because he raped his sister-in-law, while in Olivier's account, al-Jazzar fled at age 17 after stabbing a <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not accede to his desires. According to Olivier, he then began work as a sailor and drifted throughout Anatolia before selling himself to a Turkish slave trader. Al-Jazzar subsequently converted to Islam in Egypt.|$|E

25|$|Paul seizes this {{opportunity}} to give his sister a baby in a storyline that becomes known as the baby switch. He drugs Babe, puts her in a helicopter, and stages a helicopter crash near a river in the forest. When Babe awakens, Paul tells her that the helicopter crashed and her baby is dead. She loses consciousness again. When Adam Chandler and JR arrive at the scene and threaten Paul, should anything bad have happened to their heir, Paul twists his story around and tells them that it was Bianca's baby that fell into the river and that Babe's child survived. JR's family is elated that Babe's baby is alive, but Bianca's family is devastated by the news. In Llanview, Paul gives Kelly Babe's son (later known as Adam Chandler III, then Little Adam, and currently AJ), telling her that the boy's mother was a poor homeless <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not want a baby.|$|E

2500|$|Barnard's most {{successful}} fictional work written {{in her own}} right is The Persimmon Tree and Other Stories (1943). It was reissued by Virago in 1985, with the inclusion of three additional stories not previously published in book form. The title story, The Persimmon Tree, is one of Australia's most anthologised stories. The stories were published soon after the end of her relationship with Davison, and were seen by Barnard as some [...] "compensation for the hurt that was integral to their production". As Dever writes, [...] "stories such as ‘The Persimmon Tree’, ‘The <b>Woman</b> <b>Who</b> <b>Did</b> the Right Thing’ and ‘Beauty is Strength’ take as their themes the consequences of illicit love, rivalry between women and the withdrawal and stoicism sometimes demanded of injured lovers".|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To measure {{hot flashes}} by sternal skin {{conductance}} {{in an urban}} Mexican population and to determine variables associated with hot flash reporting and measurement. DESIGN: From June 1999 to August 2000, 67 perimenopausal women aged 40 to 65 years participated in interviews, anthropometric measures, and a 2 -h recording of sternal skin conductance. Changes in sweating were used to demonstrate the presence/absence of a hot flash. During the test, women were asked to report if they experienced a hot flash. RESULTS: During the study period, 10 women reported and demonstrated every hot flash, 24 women never reported or demonstrated a hot flash, 7 demonstrated hot flashes but did not report any of them, 7 reported hot flashes but did not demonstrate any of them, and 19 showed a mixture of responses. <b>Women</b> <b>who</b> demonstrated hot flashes by sternal skin conductance were measured in a warmer room, had more years of education, consumed more eggs as a child, recalled a heavier weight at age 18, and had a lower body mass index at interview compared with <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not demonstrate hot flashes by sternal skin conductance. <b>Women</b> <b>who</b> subjectively reported hot flashes were measured in a warmer room, {{were more likely to}} be postmenopausal, reported more frequent consumption of coffee, and spent fewer months breast-feeding their last child compared with <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not report the experience of hot flashes during the testing period. CONCLUSION: Room temperature explained part of the variation between <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> and did not demonstrate hot flashes via sternal skin conductance, between <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> and did not report the experience of hot flashes, and between <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> and did not demonstrate concordance in objective and subjective measures. In addition to room temperature, coffee intake, months spent breast-feeding the last child, and recalled weight at age 18 were important variables predicting hot flash experience...|$|R
2500|$|Sixty–five {{percent of}} Israeli women {{serve in the}} army, 25 percent opt out on {{religious}} grounds, the remainder are exempted for physical, emotional [...] or marital reasons. A law passed in 1978 made exemptions for women on religious grounds automatic upon the signing of a simple declaration attesting to the observance of orthodox religious practices. This legislation raised considerable controversy, and IDF officials feared that the exemption could be abused by any nonreligious <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not wish to serve and thus further exacerbate the already strained personnel resources of the IDF. Women exempted on religious grounds were legally obliged to fulfill a period of alternative service doing social or educational work assigned to them.

2500|$|The {{literary}} {{output of}} the Canadian-born author Grant Allen, who {{was brought up in}} Birmingham from the age of 13 and attended King Edward's School, was prodigious and varied even by Victorian standards. The Scottish critic Andrew Lang called him [...] "the most versatile, beyond comparison, of any man in our age". Allen {{is best known for his}} best-selling but controversial 1895 novel The <b>Woman</b> <b>Who</b> <b>Did,</b> whose tragic plot combined support for free love with opposition to the institution of marriage, and whose success scandalised Victorian society. He is also noted for innovations in detective fiction, creating independent-minded female detectives modelled on the feminist ideal of the New Woman in Miss Cayley's Adventures; and for playing with the conventions of the crime genre in An African Millionaire, where the criminal is the hero, and the short story [...] "The Great Ruby Robbery", where the culprit turns out to be the detective investigating the crime. Allen's incorporation of his own scientific preoccupations into novels such as the time travel-based The British Barbarians also made him an important early pioneer of science fiction. H. G.
