5|$|The {{earliest}} {{versions of}} the Varaha legend {{are found in the}} Taittiriya Aranyaka and the Shatapatha Brahmana. They narrate that the universe <b>was</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> primordial waters. The earth {{was the size of a}} hand and was trapped in it. The god Prajapati (the creator-god Brahma) in the form of a boar (varaha) plunges into the waters and brings the earth out. He also marries the earth thereafter. The Shatapatha Brahmana calls the boar as Emusha. The epic Ramayana and the Vishnu Purana - considered sometimes as the oldest of the Puranic scriptures - are the first to associate Varaha with Vishnu. Various Puranic scriptures including the Agni Purana, the Bhagavata Purana, the Devi Bhagavata Purana, the Padma Purana, the Varaha Purana, the Vayu Purana and the Vishnu Purana narrate the legend of Varaha with some variations.|$|E
5|$|Another tradition, {{related by}} R.C. MacLeod, told of certain events {{which took place}} after an heir to the clan's chiefship was born. The story related how at this time, there was much rejoicing at Dunvegan Castle, and since the infant's nursemaid was anxious {{to join in the}} festivities in the hall below, she left the infant alone in her room. When the baby awoke, crying of cold, no human help could hear him in his secluded room; however, a host of fairies {{appeared}} and wrapped the infant in the Fairy Flag. Meanwhile, the clansmen banqueting below demanded to see the child and the maid was ordered to bring him forth. When she brought out the baby, wrapped in the flag, everyone gazed in wonder at the child and the garb wrapped around him. The room <b>was</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> fairies' song which declared that the flag had the power to save the clan three times. When the song ended, and silence fell across the crowded room, the flag was taken from the infant and locked in a chest where it has ever since been preserved.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{importance}} of Syracuse, the sources report scant efforts from the Byzantines to aid the city. Ibn al-Athir reports that a few Byzantine vessels appeared before the city and were defeated without difficulty, but the main Byzantine fleet {{appears to have been}} occupied with ferrying building material for the erection of Emperor Basil I the Macedonian's Nea Ekklesia church in Constantinople. When the fleet eventually sailed, under the command of a certain Adrianos, it was so delayed by contrary winds at Monemvasia that news of the city's fall reached it there. Unchallenged thus in their control of the sea, the Arabs were able to destroy the fortifications (βραχιόλια) protecting the city's two harbours: the incessant bombardment succeeded in collapsing one of the towers of the seaward fortifications, along with the adjoining stretch of walls, forming a breach where the Arabs concentrated their attack. Nevertheless, the patrikios of the city rallied the defenders, and for twenty days they managed to hold the breach against superior numbers, so that the surrounding area <b>was</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> dead and wounded.|$|E

25|$|She renamed it the Théâtre Sarah Bernhardt, {{and began}} to {{renovate}} it to suit her needs. The facade was lit by 5,700 electric bulbs, 17 arc lights, and 11 projectors. She completely redecorated the interior, replacing the red plush and gilt with yellow velvet, brocade, and white woodwork. The lobby was decorated with life-sized portraits of her in her most famous roles, painted by Mucha, Louise Abbéma, and Georges Clairin. Her dressing room was a five-room suite, which, after the success of her Napoleonic play L'Aiglon, was decorated in Empire Style, featuring a marble fireplace with a fire Bernhardt kept burning year round, a huge bathtub that <b>was</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> flowers she received after each performance, and a dining room fitting 12 people, where she entertained guests after the final curtain.|$|E
25|$|The boat {{reached the}} water safely, with Lowe himself aboard to take charge. After Titanic sank he brought {{together}} Boats 10, 12, 14 and Collapsible D, transferred {{many of those}} aboard Boat 14 to the other lifeboats and took the boat back {{to the scene of}} the sinking to try to find survivors. Lifeboat #4 port was the only other lifeboat to rescue people from the sea. By the time Lowe's boat reached the scene of the sinking, the sea <b>was</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> bodies of hundreds of people who had died of hypothermia. Four men (the steward Harold Phillimore, the first class passenger William Fisher Hoyt, the third class passenger Fang Lang and a fourth unknown person, possibly the second class passenger Emilio Ilario Giuseppe Portaluppi) were pulled from the sea but most were already dead or dying. Hoyt died in the boat, while the other three survived.|$|E
25|$|Lavoisier's {{education}} <b>was</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{ideals of}} the French Enlightenment of the time, and he was fascinated by Pierre Macquer's dictionary of chemistry. He attended lectures in the natural sciences. Lavoisier's devotion and passion for chemistry were largely influenced by Étienne Condillac, a prominent French scholar of the 18th century. His first chemical publication appeared in 1764. From 1763 to 1767, he studied geology under Jean-Étienne Guettard. In collaboration with Guettard, Lavoisier worked on a geological survey of Alsace-Lorraine in June 1767. In 1764 he read his first paper to the French Academy of Sciences, France's most elite scientific society, on the chemical and physical properties of gypsum (hydrated calcium sulfate), and in 1766 he was awarded a gold medal by the King for an essay {{on the problems of}} urban street lighting. In 1768 Lavoisier received a provisional appointment to the Academy of Sciences. In 1769, he worked on the first geological map of France.|$|E

500|$|In January 2009, Krohn {{contacted}} {{organizers of}} the Conservative Political Action Conference and asked {{to speak at the}} event. Organizers were reportedly skeptical, but gave him a three-minute spot on a panel about grassroots activists. He delivered the speech, on February 27, 2009 and described the conservative principles outlined in his book. When the speech was over, the panel moderator said, [...] "Watch out, David Keene," [...] referring to the chairman of the American Conservative Union. The next day at the conference, William Bennett said, [...] "I used to work for Ronald Reagan and now I'm a colleague of Jonathan Krohn's!" [...] The speech attracted the attention of national media outlets, and became popular online. Sam Stein of The Huffington Post said of the speech, [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> type of rhetorical flow and emotional pitch one would expect from a seasoned hand.

500|$|The couple honeymooned at Oatlands Palace, the Duke of York's {{residence}} in Surrey. [...] Neither was {{well and the}} house <b>was</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Yorks' dogs and the odour of animals. [...] Nevertheless, the Princess wrote that Leopold was [...] "the perfection of a lover". [...] Two days after the marriage, they were visited by the Prince Regent at Oatlands; he spent two hours describing the details of military uniforms to Leopold, which according to Charlotte [...] "is a great mark of the most perfect good humour". [...] Prince Leopold and his wife returned to London for the social season, and when they attended the theatre, they were invariably treated to wild applause from the audience and the singing of [...] "God Save the King" [...] from the company. When she was taken ill at the Opera, there was great public concern about her condition. [...] It was announced that she had suffered a miscarriage.

500|$|The {{earliest}} {{description of}} carbon monoxide poisoning dates to at least 200 BC by Aristotle. Documented cases {{of carbon monoxide}} {{being used as a}} method of suicide date to at least 100 BC in ancient Rome. In the AD 350s, the Roman emperor Julian suffered from carbon monoxide poisoning in Paris, and later described it in his work Misopogon: [...] "though the winter weather prevailed and continually increased in severity, even so I did not allow my servants to heat the house, because I was afraid of drawing out the dampness in the walls; but I ordered them to carry in fire that had burned down and to place in the room a very moderate number of hot coals. But the coals, though there were not very many of them, brought out from the walls quantities of steam and this made me fall asleep. And since my head <b>was</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> fumes I was almost choked. Then I was carried outside." [...] This misunderstanding of the causes of carbon monoxide poisoning may have caused the death of Julian's successor, Jovian.|$|E

500|$|Saint-Just {{immediately}} {{exhibited the}} ruthless disciplinarianism {{for which he}} would be famous. Within a few months he was the commanding officer, at the rank of lieutenant-colonel. At local meetings he moved attendees with his patriotic zeal and flair: in one much-repeated story, Saint-Just brought the town council to tears by thrusting his hand into the flame of a burning anti-revolutionary pamphlet, swearing his devotion to the Republic. He had powerful allies when he sought {{to become a member}} of [...] his district’s electoral assembly, and he initiated correspondence with well-known leaders of the Revolution like Camille Desmoulins. In late 1790, he wrote to Robespierre for the first time, asking him to consider a local petition. The letter <b>was</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> highest of praise, beginning: “You, who uphold our tottering country against the torrent of despotism and intrigue; you whom I know, as I know God, only through his miracles...” Through their correspondence, the two developed [...] "a deep and mysterious friendship that would last until the day [...] died." ...|$|E
500|$|As a person, Kubrick was {{described}} by Norman Lloyd as [...] "a very dark, sort of a glowering type who was very serious". Marisa Berenson, who starred in Barry Lyndon fondly recalled: [...] "There was great tenderness in {{him and he was}} passionate about his work. What was striking was his enormous intelligence, but he also had a great sense of humor. He was a very shy person and self-protective, but he <b>was</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> thing that drove him twenty-four hours of the day." [...] Kubrick was particularly fond of machines and technical equipment, to the point that his wife Christiane once stated that [...] "Stanley would be happy with eight tape recorders and one pair of pants". Although Kubrick had obtained a pilot's license in August 1947, some have claimed that he later developed a fear of flying, stemming from an incident in the early 1950s when a colleague had been killed in a plane crash. Kubrick had been sent the charred remains of his camera and notebooks which, according to Duncan, traumatized him for life. Kubrick also had a strong mistrust of doctors and medicine, especially those he did not know, and on one occasion he had a dentist from the Bronx flown to London to treat him.|$|E
