60|$|She sighed heavily, {{and leaned}} towards me a little, {{so as to}} rest her {{shoulder}} against mine. I felt her trembling, and tried to spare her by speaking myself. She stopped me by a <b>warning</b> <b>pressure</b> of her hand, and then addressed Sir Percival one more, but this time without looking at him.|$|E
6000|$|Nettie {{would have}} {{snatched}} her hand free, {{but the man}} held it fast with a little <b>warning</b> <b>pressure,</b> and she went on with him, partly because his voice had been deferential and puzzlingly familiar, and also because {{it was evident that}} she could not get away. They went up a calle, where another band of roysterers came clamoring to meet them, until the man led her under an archway where a lamp was burning. Then he gravely dropped her hand, and Nettie gasped as she stared at him. He was burned to the color of coffee, his shoes were burst, and his garments, which had evidently never been intended to fit him, were mostly rags, but his face reminded her of the man she had met on board the “Aurania.” ...|$|E

40|$|The {{commercial}} {{availability of}} lightweight high pressure compressed air vessels {{has resulted in}} a lightweight firefighter's breathing apparatus. The improved apparatus, and details of its design and development are described. The apparatus includes a compact harness assembly, a backplate mounted pressure reducer assembly, a lightweight bubble-type facemask with a mask mounted demand breathing regulator. Incorporated in the breathing regulator is exhalation valve, a purge valve and a whistle-type low <b>pressure</b> <b>warning</b> that sounds only during inhalation. The pressure reducer assembly includes two pressure reducers, an automatic transfer valve and a signaling device for the low <b>pressure</b> <b>warning.</b> Twenty systems were fabricated, tested, refined through an alternating development and test sequence, and extensively examined in a field evaluation program. Photographs of the apparatus are included...|$|R

They're only samples o' {{dressmaking}} and jewelry that a vain, conceited shrimp of a feller up in Sacramento sends {{down here to}} get customers for. In course I'm to pay for 'em. In course he reckons I'm to do it. In course I calkilate to do it; but he needn't try to play 'em off as presents. He talks suthin' o' coming down here, sportin' hisself off on Flip as a fancy buck! Not ez long ez the old man's here, you bet!" [...] Thoroughly carried away by his fancied wrongs, it was perhaps fortunate {{that he did not}} observe the flashing eyes of Lance behind his lank and lustreless wig; but seeing only the figure of Lance as he had conjured him, he went on: [...] "That's why I want you to hang around her. Hang around her ontil my boy--him that's comin' home on a visit--gets here, and I reckon he'll clear out that yar Sacramento counter-jumper. Only let me get a sight o' him afore Flip does. Eh? D'ye hear? Dog my skin if I don't believe the d----d Injin's drunk." [...] It was fortunate that at that moment Flip reappeared, and, dropping on the hearth between her father and the infuriated Lance, let her hand slip in his with a <b>warning</b> <b>pressure.</b> The light touch momentarily recalled him to himself and her, but not until the quick-witted girl had revealed to her, in one startled wave of consciousness, the full extent of Lance's infirmity of temper. With the instinct of awakened tenderness came a sense of responsibility, and a vague premonition of danger. The coy blossom of her heart was scarce unfolded before it was chilled by approaching shadows. Fearful of, she knew not what, she hesitated. Every moment of Lance's stay was imperiled by a single word that might spring from his suppressed white lips; beyond and above the suspicions his sudden withdrawal might awaken in her father's breast, she was dimly conscious of some mysterious terror without that awaited him. She listened to the furious onslaught of the wind upon the sycamores beside their cabin, and thought she heard it there; she listened to the sharp fusillade of rain upon roof and pane, and the turbulent roar and rush of leaping mountain torrents at their very feet, and fancied it was there. She suddenly sprang to the window, and, pressing her eyes to the pane, saw through the misty turmoil of tossing boughs and swaying branches the scintillating intermittent flames of torches moving on the trail above, and knew it was there! ...|$|E

5000|$|The BSA Lightning was {{designed}} as the all-round sports machine of the 1960s, planned largely for export to the US market [...] to complement the touring Thunderbolt and the later development, the supersports Spitfire. Development of the engine aimed {{to make it more}} reliable, quieter and less prone to oil leaks, with top speed sacrificed to improve mid-range and rideability. Nevertheless, with twin carburettors the A65L could still reach 108 mph. Improvements included an oil <b>pressure</b> <b>warning</b> light, but this had a tendency to malfunction, so riders learned to ignore it.|$|R
50|$|Along with {{condition-based}} maintenance, {{planned maintenance}} comprises preventive maintenance, {{in which the}} maintenance event is preplanned, and all future maintenance is preprogrammed. Planned maintenance is created for every item separately according to manufacturers recommendation or legislation. Plans can be date-based, based on equipment running hours, or on the distance travelled by the vehicle. A good example of a planned maintenance program is car maintenance, where time and distance determine fluid change requirements. A good example of condition-based maintenance is the oil <b>pressure</b> <b>warning</b> light that provides notification that you should stop the vehicle because engine lubrication has stopped and failure will occur.|$|R

Australi Witness posted pictures online of what he {{claimed to be a}} bomb he was building and emailed the BBC claiming credit for the Curtis Culwell Center attack, and <b>warning</b> that a <b>pressure</b> cooker bomb would be detonated in a [...] "large Midwestern US city" [...] on September 11, 2015.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Tsunami, one of {{the most}} horrible {{disasters}} in the earth, the killer wave contains incogitable powerful energy rushing to the shore and coastline. Nowadays the best way for avoiding the tragedy is to use Tsunami Warning System (TWS) to forecast. How does it work based on remote sensing and GIS? This question attracts us to find answer and make discovery. We believe with the development of human culture and technology, TWS will be consummate one day. And at that time, people will not get so much loss as today by tsunami. Generally, in DART(Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis), the transmission of messages through seabed pressure gauges connected buoys and then transmitted via satellite to <b>warning</b> centers. <b>Pressure</b> gauge is very accurate, but it's so expensive that hinder the deployment and application. So scientists came up with the use of satellite to detect the tsunami. Unlike conventional observations, such as tide gauges，satellite can observe the Change in the sea surface height, far-flung trends of the tsunami wave and the profiles of the sea surface. These data can be used to checkup the experiments and research of tsunami warning model. In addition, satellite observations have also found tsunami caused by ocean dynamic phenomena (eg: wind and eddies). [1...|$|R
50|$|HCR {{is based}} on the premise that an operator’s {{likelihood}} of success or failure in a time-critical task is dependent on the cognitive process used to make the critical decisions that determine the outcome. Three Performance Shaping Factors (PSFs) - Operator Experience, Stress Level, and Quality of Operator/Plant Interface - also influence the average (median) time taken to perform the task. Combining these factors enables “response-time” curves to be calibrated and compared to the available time to perform the task. Using these curves, the analyst can then estimate the likelihood that an operator will take the correct action, as required by a given stimulus (e.g. <b>pressure</b> <b>warning</b> signal), within the available time window. The relationship between these normalised times and Human Error Probabilities (HEPs) {{is based on}} simulator experimental data.|$|R

Firstly, analysis the composition of early warning systems, and then propose the principles of rollover warning method based on suspension distortion perception; Secondly, establish the wheels sprung suspension force formula when the vehicle is cornering, take lateral load transfer rate as the rollover warning threshold and determine the size of wheel suspension <b>pressure</b> <b>warning</b> threshold when cornering; Finally, Taking a test vehicle for example, validated the rollover warning method. The simulation {{results show that the}} early warning method is capable of warning the vehicles that in the curve and has a rollover risk to avoid rollover, and improve the traffic efficiency in curve...|$|R
5000|$|In 1927, Schlink was co-author, with Stuart Chase, of the bestseller, Your Money's Worth, a <b>warning</b> about sales <b>pressure</b> and {{misleading}} advertising. The book {{called attention to}} the [...] "Consumers' Club", a small organization in White Plains, New York. Within two years, the club had members nationwide and was incorporated as Consumers' Research. Arthur Kallet, the secretary of the group, enlisted Schlink's aid as co-author of One Hundred Million Guinea Pigs in 1933. (The title referred to what was roughly the population of the United States at the time.) The book caused a stir, noting that some well-advertised products (including mouthwash and hair dyes) were sometimes useless and even dangerous. In 1934, he published a pamphlet with Mary Catherine Philips Discovering Consumers. His final book was Eat, Drink and be Wary in 1935. Schlink himself lived for sixty years after the book's publication and {{died at the age of}} 103.|$|R
50|$|All of this {{technology}} came {{at a very high}} price. At a time when the most expensive Cadillacs, the mid-sized Seville and full-sized Cadillac Fleetwood Series Seventy-Five limousine each listed for about US$16,000, the 6.9 listed for around $40,000, more than the Big Three but less than most Rolls-Royces. When the car was officially introduced into the North American market for the 1977 model year, the price was well past $40,000 and was $52,995 by the end of production. Though the 6.9 was undeniably a luxury car, the decor was rather austere compared to the sheer opulence available in a Rolls-Royce or full-sized Cadillac. The interior was identical to that in the less expensive models except for the push-pull suspension control knob just under the speedometer, a low suspension <b>pressure</b> <b>warning</b> and height adjustment indicator lights in the instrument cluster, and wood trim finished in burled walnut veneer on the dash and console. The rest of the W116 lineup was trimmed in striated zebrano veneer.|$|R
2500|$|The {{interior}} on the Fairlane/Torino was all new for 1968. A new dashboard featured four equally sized round pods centred {{around the}} steering wheel. However, the pods {{did not contain}} {{a full set of}} gauges; rather an assortment of warning lights along with the speedometer and fuel gauge. The fuel gauge and temperature warning lights were in the first pod, a [...] speedometer was located in the second pod from the left, alternator and oil <b>pressure</b> <b>warning</b> lights were in the third pod from the left and the fourth pod was blank. An optional tachometer was available, which would be located in the third pod, and an optional clock occupied the fourth pod. Ford offered many upholstery options, including a knitted vinyl option, called [...] "comfortweave." [...] This unique option allowed the vinyl to [...] "breathe" [...] unlike conventional vinyl, offering more comfort in hot weather. [...] Conforming to U.S. safety standards, there was much padding inside the Torino's interior, which also featured shoulder belts for front outboard passengers on all cars built after December 31, 1967.|$|R
40|$|The {{drive to}} improve flood <b>warnings</b> There is <b>pressure</b> {{to improve the}} {{performance}} of flood forecasting, warning and response systems (FFWRS) in Europe and elsewhere. The scientific community and politicians suspect that climate change generated by anthropogenic emissions of greenhouses gases is producing increased flood activity on the coast and inland. Global competition {{and the process of}} economic competition between European municipalities is leading to more development on floodplains. About 5 - 10 per cent of Western Europe’s population is estimated to live or work on floodplains and even more are exposed to flood risk because of recreational and transportational facilities which are flood prone (Handmer 2001). Not suprisingly the public and political acceptability of flooding and its consequences appears to be reducing as living standards rise. Many Europeans have more property to protect than previously and as the population becomes more graduate and articulate. A growing number of Europeans is becoming used to instant personal access to data and information, whether it be by mobile telephone, digital television, radio or the internet. The population is increasingly expecting rapid access to information including weathe...|$|R
50|$|The Yuba City bus {{disaster}} {{occurred on}} May 21, 1976 in Martinez, California. A 1950 Crown bus operated by Student Transportation Lines, Inc. had been chartered {{to carry the}} Yuba City High School a cappella choir from Yuba City to Miramonte High School in Orinda for a friendship day involving the choirs of the two schools. The accident occurred at 10:55 a.m., as the driver took the Marina Vista (exit 56) off-ramp from I-680 southbound from the Benicia-Martinez Bridge. The driver was unfamiliar with this bus, and mistakenly thought the low air <b>pressure</b> <b>warning</b> (for the air brakes) was a warning of low engine oil pressure. The driver left the freeway at the aforementioned off ramp, and the brakes failed {{due to lack of}} air pressure. The bus struck and mounted the bridge rail and left the elevated roadway, falling 21.6 feet. It landed upside down and crushed the roof {{to the bottom of the}} bus windows. Out of 52 passengers on board, twenty-eight students and an adult adviser were killed. All of the surviving passengers were injured, most critically. The driver survived the crash but was seriously hurt.|$|R
40|$|Wireless {{networks}} are being {{integrated into the}} modern automobile. The security and privacy implications of such in-car networks, however, are not well understood as their transmissions propagate {{beyond the confines of}} a car’s body. To understand the risks associated with these wireless systems, this paper presents a privacy and secu-rity evaluation of wireless Tire Pressure Monitoring Sys-tems using both laboratory experiments with isolated tire pressure sensor modules and experiments with a com-plete vehicle system. We show that eavesdropping is eas-ily possible at a distance of roughly 40 m from a passing vehicle. Further, reverse-engineering of the underlying protocols revealed static 32 bit identifiers and that mes-sages can be easily triggered remotely, which raises pri-vacy concerns as vehicles can be tracked through these identifiers. Further, current protocols do not employ authentication and vehicle implementations do not per-form basic input validation, thereby allowing for remote spoofing of sensor messages. We validated this experi-mentally by triggering tire <b>pressure</b> <b>warning</b> messages in a moving vehicle from a customized software radio at-tack platform located in a nearby vehicle. Finally, the paper concludes with a set of recommendations for im-proving the privacy and security of tire pressure monitor-ing systems and other forthcoming in-car wireless sensor networks. ...|$|R
