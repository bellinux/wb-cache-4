5|$|Although {{there were}} {{differences}} in season one, the current rules have applied in all subsequent seasons. One feature continued from season one <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> show opened: viewers were shown {{the biggest and most}} intense physical altercation of the season, and the program then went back to a time before it happened. This fight usually gives you an idea of {{who is going to be}} the baddest, or one of the baddest, girls in the house. This altercation draws in many viewers and keeps them wondering what will happen next.|$|E
5|$|The {{advance to}} the Blackett design <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> {{sighting}} head was aimed. Instead of dialling the parameters into the sight directly as in the CSBS, these inputs were dialled into a separate console. The console was equipped with repeaters {{for each of the}} aircraft instruments needed to operate the sight, like altitude and airspeed. The operator simply turned the dials on the console so their indicator arrows matched the readings on the instruments displayed in the same location, known as laying needle on needle. This eliminated the possibility that the numbers would not be changed as the bomber manoeuvred, but required so much manual working that a new crew member was introduced to operate the console, the bomb-aimer's mate.|$|E
25|$|Rev. Nielsen-Lund of the Norwegian Missionary Society (NMS), {{together}} with Malagasy porters and guides, traveled down to Fort Dauphin through Bara country (where they were twice imprisoned by different kings) {{for a second}} time {{at the request of the}} NMS, to identify the best way for the Hogstads, the first Lutheran missionaries to work in this area, to travel on their way down from the highlands. After only one day's rest in Fort Dauphin, he returned to the highlands by going straight north from Fort Dauphin to Vangaindrano, which <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> Hogstads then came down a year later.|$|E

25|$|To {{improve the}} {{calculation}} time, the Norden used a mechanical computer inside the bombsight {{to calculate the}} range angle of the bombs. By simply dialing in the aircraft's altitude and heading, along with estimates of the wind speed and direction (in relation to the aircraft), the computer would automatically, and quickly, calculate the aim point. This not only reduced the time needed for the bombsight setup but also dramatically reduced the chance for errors. This attack on the accuracy problem {{was by no means}} unique; several other bombsights of the era used similar calculators. It <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> Norden used these calculations that differed.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the biggest}} change to the {{previous}} Finnish ice class rules <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> structural requirements were determined. Instead of percentages and experience the minimum requirements were based on plastic deformation theory and pressure loads determined from observations of past ice damages in the Baltic Sea. The ships were divided into three areas (bow, midship, aft) and the pressure loads were calculated for each area {{as a function of}} the ship's displacement and engine output. The rules regarding rudders, engines and the propulsion system were also changed accordingly, and the propulsion system was to be designed so that its strength increased towards the engine. This minimized the repair costs as the parts most likely to break, the propeller blades, were also the easiest and cheapest to replace. Furthermore, a minimum power requirement was given so that the ice-strengthened ships would be powerful enough to follow the icebreakers and not slow down the traffic.|$|E
25|$|Errors in the {{original}} body and coffins counts quickly became apparent. Father John P. Chidwick, the Roman Catholic chaplain aboard the Maine {{at the time of}} its destruction, had overseen {{the original}} interments in February and March 1898. He now also oversaw the disinterment. Chidwick's records showed that there should have been 154 coffins, but only 151 were recovered. Additionally, Chidwick's list of the dead showed two unidentified bodies were unaccounted for. Several reasons for the discrepancies were offered: Clerical errors, errors made by the overburdened Chidwick, and more than one body in the same casket. Chidwick, Colon Cemetery officials, and Cuban authorities were convinced, however, that no bodies had been lost. Disinterment also revealed a new problem: At the time of burial, identified remains had a number painted on the exterior of the coffin that corresponded with a name on Chidwick's list of dead. But by the time of disinterment, the numbers on many of these coffins were unreadable. Identified remains thus became unidentified. Another problem <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> dead were buried. As bodies were buried at Colon Cemetery, the row and grave number was supposed to be noted for each casket. Unfortunately, the cemetery superintendent only noted which row each identified body was inâ€”not the actual grave number. This, too, made it sometimes impossible to determine in which grave identified remains laid. Some casket numbers were readable, however. Those bodies which still could be identified had their names painted on the exterior of the new coffin. The old coffins were burned.|$|E

500|$|Steve Kandell of New York {{magazine}} {{said the}} episode felt like [...] "a {{bit of a}} place-holder" [...] compared to other episodes in the season, but that [...] "Woman of the Year" [...] included amusing scenes and introduced new ways to mock bureaucracy [...] "without every feeling like the sly satire it secretly is". Kandell also said he enjoyed the jokes at Leslie's and Jerry's expense. Kona Gallagher of TV Squad said every character was at their best, and that he particularly enjoyed Ron's taunting of Leslie once it was made clear he was only joking. Gallagher said the [...] "only thing about this episode I didn't love" [...] <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> subplot involving Tom's investment with the nightclub ended, because she felt it [...] "started off strong, but kind of went nowhere."

2500|$|According to {{his cousin}} Erika Kopper, Ratzinger {{had no desire}} from {{childhood}} to be {{anything other than a}} priest. At the age of 15, she says, he announced {{that he was going to}} be a bishop, whereupon she playfully remarked: [...] "And why not Pope?". An even earlier incident occurred in 1932, when Michael Cardinal von Faulhaber, Archbishop of Munich, visited the small town in which the Ratzinger family lived, arriving in a black limousine. The future pope, then five years old, was part of a group of children who presented the cardinal with flowers, and later that day Ratzinger announced he wanted to be a cardinal, too. [...] "It wasn't so much the car, since we weren't technically minded", Georg Ratzinger told a reporter from the New York Times.

2500|$|The {{genesis of}} [...] "In the Midnight Hour" [...] was a {{recording}} session on May 12, 1965, at which Wexler {{worked out a}} powerful rhythm track with studio musicians Steve Cropper and Al Jackson of the Stax Records house band, including bassist Donald [...] "Duck" [...] Dunn. (Stax keyboard player Booker T. Jones, who usually played with Dunn, Cropper and Jackson as Booker T. & the M.G.'s, did not play on the studio sessions with Pickett.)

2500|$|... 1951: Columbia Masterworks: {{the company}} {{recorded}} a 3-LP album {{of what was}} then the standard performing version of Porgy and Bess â€“ the most complete recording made of the opera up to that time. It was billed as a [...] "complete" [...] version, but was complete only insofar as that <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> work was usually performed then. (Actually, nearly an hour was cut from the opera.) Because album producer Goddard Lieberson was eager to bring as much of Porgy and Bess as he felt was practical on records at the time, the recording featured more of Gershwin's original recitatives and orchestrations than had ever been heard before. The recording was conducted by Lehman Engel, and starred Lawrence Winters and Camilla Williams, both from the New York City Opera. Several singers who had been associated with the original 1935 production and the 1942 revival of Porgy and Bess were finally given a chance to record their roles more or less complete. The album was highly acclaimed as a giant step in recorded opera in its time. It was re-released at budget price on the Odyssey label in the early 1970s. It has subsequently appeared on CD on Sony's [...] "Masterworks Heritage" [...] CD series, and on the Naxos label as well. The album is not sung in as directly [...] "operatic" [...] a style as later versions, treading a fine line between opera and musical theatre.|$|E

2500|$|The famous Indianapolis {{definition}} of pornography by Dworkin and MacKinnon paralleled their Minneapolis ordinance. The first {{was rejected by}} the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit for several reasons. The ordinance did not use any of the accepted terms that the Supreme Court had developed over time for determining when material is obscene, including [...] "prurient interest", [...] "offensiveness", or [...] "local community standards". Another concern <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> women were depicted in the work. If women were referred to in the approved fashion stressing equality, the activity involved would be regardless of how sexually explicit it was. The Court also indicated that if women were referred to in a disapproving way depicting them as subversive or as enjoying humiliation, the activity would be unlawful regardless of the [...] "literary, artistic or political qualities of the work taken as a whole". Judge Frank Easterbrook said: [...] "We accept the premises of this legislation. Depictions of subordination tend to perpetuate subordination. The subordinate status of women in turn leads to affront and lower pay at work, insult and injury at home, battery and rape on the streets.... Yet this simply demonstrates the power of pornography as speech." [...] Conceptions of Democracy in American Constitutional Argument: The Case of Pornography Regulation by Frank Michelman, issued by Tennessee Law Review (vol. 56, no. 291, 1989) partially consented that [...] "pornography is political expression in that it promulgates a certain view of women's natures and thus of women's appropriate relations and treatment in society", but also concluded that the Indianopolis ordinance was precisely designed to suppress that particular view by censoring pornography. Minneapolis ordinance was struck down {{on the grounds that it}} was ambiguous and vague, however, despite of its failure the proposal influenced other communities across the United States.|$|E

30|$|Moreover, {{a mobile}} sink can balance the energy {{consumption}} and prolong {{the lifetime of}} the network. However, {{the use of a}} mobile sink introduces two new challenges in the data collection of IWSNs. <b>The</b> first one <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> mobile sinkâ€™s latest location <b>is</b> updated. <b>The</b> traditional <b>way</b> of this updating is that a mobile sink broadcasts the updated information on its location to the entire network. However, a frequent broadcast may lead to high overheads and shorten the lifetime of a network. Hence, it is challenging to find a suitable <b>way</b> to update <b>the</b> information of mobile sink with lower overheads. Another challenge <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> trajectory of a mobile sink is planned [28]. As <b>the</b> sensory data <b>are</b> delivered to a mobile sink through multi-hops, the sensor nodes around the mobile sink run out of energy very fast. Moreover, the number of transmission hops affects the transmission delay. Hence, the trajectory of a mobile sink affects the balance of energy consumption and transmission delay greatly.|$|R
