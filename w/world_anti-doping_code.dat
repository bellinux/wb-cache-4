The Court of Arbitration for Sport {{overturned}} his lifetime Olympic ban, deeming it non-compliant with the <b>World</b> <b>Anti-Doping</b> <b>Code,</b> and he competed in the 2012 London Olympics. He produced a ghost-written autobiography with writer Ken Scott, Race Against Me, in 2009. He is of Afro-Caribbean- Jamaican descent and has two sons with his partner Leonie Daley.|$|E
5|$|Track {{and field}} athletes are banned from ingesting or using certain {{substances}} by governing bodies for the sport, {{from the national}} to the international level. The IAAF's constitution incorporates the <b>World</b> <b>Anti-Doping</b> <b>Code</b> among other anti-doping measures. Practices such as blood doping {{and the use of}} anabolic steroids, peptide hormones, stimulants, or diuretics can give athletes a physical competitive advantage in track and field. The use of such substances in track and field is opposed on both ethical and medical grounds. Given that the sport functions by measuring and comparing athletes' performances, performance-enhancing substances create an uneven playing field — athletes who do not use doping substances have a disadvantage over rivals who do. Medically, the use of banned substances may have an adverse effect upon athletes' health. However, some exemptions are made for athletes who take banned substances for therapeutic use, and athletes are not sanctioned for usage in these cases, such as Kim Collins' failed drug test due to asthma medication.|$|E

5|$|The {{hearing was}} at last held in November, with a verdict {{expected}} in January 2012. This, however, was also {{subject to a}} delay. Finally, on 6 February 2012, the court spoke, overturning the Spanish federation's decision to clear Contador and assessing the rider a backdated two-year ban, from the date of his adverse test at the 2010 Tour de France. The backdated ban meant any results obtained {{from the time of}} that test to the time the court announced its verdict were to be vacated and awarded in turn to previously second-placed riders. This effectively made Michele Scarponi the new Giro champion and points winner, and it made José Rujano and Vincenzo Nibali into stage winners in this Giro. The decision was reminiscent of that handed down in the Alessandro Petacchi case from the 2007 Giro d'Italia. The court's ruling opinion was that the minute amount of clenbuterol found was probably not caused by a doping regimen, but that strict liability rules meant that Contador had nonetheless violated WADA's <b>World</b> <b>Anti-Doping</b> <b>Code.</b> The court held that the adverse finding itself was never in doubt, but merely how the substance had entered the athlete's body. This was not a matter under which they could exonerate him.|$|E

25|$|In June 2012, the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) accused Armstrong of doping and {{trafficking}} of drugs, {{based on}} blood samples from 2009 and 2010, and testimonies from witnesses including former teammates. Further, {{he was accused}} of putting pressure on teammates to take unauthorized performance-enhancing drugs as well. In October, USADA formally charged him with running a massive doping ring. It also sought to ban him from participating in sports sanctioned by WADA for life. Since all Olympic sports follow the <b>World</b> <b>Anti-Doping</b> <b>Code,</b> USADA's sanctions would have effectively ended Armstrong's competitive career. Armstrong chose not to appeal the ban, saying it would not be worth the toll on his family.|$|E

A third consecutive podium finish came at the 2012 IAAF World Indoor Championships, where he pipped Trell Kimmons to the bronze medal. Chambers was {{given the chance to}} return to the Olympic stage after the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) decided in favour of the World Anti-Doping Agency over the validity of British Olympic Association's (BOA) Olympic ban by-law. CAS agreed that the law was non-compliant with the <b>World</b> <b>Anti-Doping</b> <b>Code,</b> to which the BOA was signatory due to its connection with the International Olympic Committee. Chambers ran a 150m-straight best of 15.27 seconds at the Great City Games in May then won the 100m Olympic trial race, holding off emerging teenager Adam Gemili.

Mayo termed his use of prasterone as [...] "an honest mistake," [...] saying the prasterone was in an over-the-counter supplement {{and that he was}} unaware the supplement was banned by the NBA. Mayo is the seventh player to test positive for performance-enhancing drugs since the league began testing in 1999. Rashard Lewis, then with the Orlando Magic, tested positive for prasterone and was suspended 10 games {{before the start of the}} 2009-10 season. 2008 Olympic 400 meter champion Lashawn Merritt has also tested positive for prasterone and was banned from the sport for 21 months. Yulia Efimova, who holds the world record pace for both the 50-meter and 200-meter breaststroke, and won the bronze medal in the 200-meter breaststroke in the 2012 London Olympic Games, tested positive for prasterone in an out-of-competition doping test.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the <b>World</b> <b>Anti-doping</b> Agency (WADA) through the theoretical framework of meta-organizations {{that focuses on}} organizations that are themselves made up of organizations. The data are drawn from a unique case study based on interviews of WADA’s experts and documentary analysis. We analyzed WADA through two dimensions of meta-organizations, namely the organizational and strategic dimensions, which are themselves defined by two criteria each: the mission and scope as regards the strategic dimension, and the hierarchical stratification and the decision-making process for the organizational dimension. Our {{findings suggest that the}} <b>World</b> <b>Anti-doping</b> Agency can be apprehended through meta-organizational theory. However, the criterion of consensus decision-making process needs to be nuanced since {{it is not the only}} process used by WADA. The implications of our findings are twofold: first of all, we deepen our understanding of a specific international sport organization which is at the heart of current major sport issues and which is continuously evaluating its processes. Therefore WADA could benefit from our analysis to improve the way it works. Secondly, we enrich the literature on metaorganization’s theory, which has only been developed over the last few years...|$|R

This has promoted their unity for the collective enhancement of the Olympic and sports movement and will be accelerated under President Ricci Bitti, whilst maintaining the authority, independence and autonomy of the Federations. We will increase the scope of our representation and major common projects for the benefit of our members in a proactive and robust manner aimed at placing the summer Olympic IFs at the centre of decision-making in sport.|$|R
