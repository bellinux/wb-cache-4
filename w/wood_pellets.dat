At the time MESys was founded very few regulations existed which directly referred to <b>Wood</b> <b>Pellet</b> boilers in Maine and the surrounding regions. As a result, rules and regulations created to regulate the installation and use of cordwood and coal stoker boilers were frequently applied to pellet boilers.

40|$|This paper aims to {{understand}} the determinants of the adoption of <b>wood</b> <b>pellet</b> technology for home heating to identify possible strategies against the slow diffusion of <b>wood</b> <b>pellet</b> in Norway. A mail survey of 737 Norwegian households was conducted in 2008, involving <b>wood</b> <b>pellet</b> adopters and non-wood pellet adopters as respondents. An integrated model combining psychological factors (such as intentions, attitudes, perceived behavioral control, habits and norms), perceived <b>wood</b> <b>pellet</b> heating characteristics, and ecological and basic values is applied to predict the installation of a <b>wood</b> <b>pellet</b> stove retrospectively. Results from a path analysis gain empirical support for the proposed integrated model. <b>Wood</b> <b>pellet</b> heating adoption is mainly predicted by a deliberate decision process starting with the evaluation of heating system characteristics, mediated by attitudes and intentions. A lack of perceived behavioral control and behavioral lock-in pose relevant barriers to the adoption process. The influence of norms and values are indirect and only minor in the given market conditions. Therefore, focusing on values or norms should not be of highest priority at the moment, whereas improvement of the subjective evaluation of the functional reliability and the costs related to <b>wood</b> <b>pellet</b> heating should have first priority. The small but significant influence of habitual decision making indicates that presenting alternatives and increase decisional involvement could be other promising strategies to reduce cognitive lock-in in decision-making. <b>Wood</b> <b>pellet</b> heating Norwegian households Psychological model Values Technology characteristics Path analysis...|$|R

25|$|When {{solid biomass}} {{is already in}} a {{suitable}} form (such as firewood), it can burn directly in a stove or furnace to provide heat or raise steam. When solid biomass is in an inconvenient form (such as sawdust, wood chips, grass, urban waste wood, agricultural residues), the typical process is to densify the biomass. This process includes grinding the raw biomass to an appropriate particulate size (known as hogfuel), which, depending on the densification type, can be from , which is then concentrated into a fuel product. The current processes produce <b>wood</b> <b>pellets,</b> cubes, or pucks. The pellet process is most common in Europe, and is typically a pure wood product.

25|$|Forest {{products}} {{have always been}} a staple to the economy, comprising 1% of the total gross state output and 9% of total manufacturing as of 2013. In 2007 Windham County contained the largest concentration of kilns for drying lumber east of the Mississippi River. The decline of farms has resulted in a regrowth of Vermont's forests due to ecological succession. Today, most of Vermont's forests are secondary. The state and non-profit organizations are actively encouraging regrowth and careful forest management. Over 78% of the land area of the state is forested compared to only 37% forest in 1880s when sheep farming was at its peak and large amounts of acreage were cleared for grazing land. Over 85% of that area is non-industrial, private forestland owned by individuals or families. In 2013 73.054 million cubic feet of wood was harvested in Vermont. A large amount of Vermont forest products are exports with 21.504 million feet being shipped overseas plus an additional 16.384 million cubic feet to Canada. Most of it was processed within the state. In this century the manufacture of wood products has fallen by almost half. The annual net growth has been estimated at 172.810 million cubic feet. The USDA estimates that 8.584 billion cubic feet remain in the state. Forest products also add to carbon sequestration since lumber and timber used in houses and furniture hold carbon {{for long periods of time}} while the trees that were removed are replaced overtime with new growing stock. While <b>wood</b> <b>pellets</b> are replacing coal in European power plants reducing CO2 emissions by up to 90% and preventing mountaintop removal for coal mining.|$|E
