5|$|A {{new plan}} was {{put forward by}} West Sussex County Council in 1961. This {{proposed}} new neighbourhoods at Broadfield and Bewbush, both of which extended outside the administrative area of the then Urban District Council.

Further expansion at Bewbush was begun in 1974, although development there was slow. The two neighbourhoods were both larger than the original nine: together, their proposed population was 23,000. Work also {{took place in the}} area now known as Ifield West on the western fringes of the town.|$|E

5|$|According to Méliès's recollections, much of {{the unusual}} cost of A Trip to the Moon {{was due to the}} {{mechanically}} operated scenery and the Selenite costumes in particular, which <b>were</b> <b>made</b> <b>for</b> the film using cardboard and canvas. Méliès himself sculpted prototypes for the heads, feet, and kneecap pieces in terra cotta, and then created plaster molds for them. A specialist in mask-making used these molds to produce cardboard versions for the actors to wear. One of the backdrops for the film, showing the inside of the glass-roofed workshop in which the space capsule is built, was painted to look like the actual glass-roofed studio in which the film was made.|$|E
5|$|After the United States Congress {{proposed}} the Twenty-first Amendment to end prohibition in February 1933, plans <b>were</b> <b>made</b> <b>for</b> Conyngham {{to be returned}} to the Navy. On 27 May 1933, Conyngham arrived at the Philadelphia Navy Yard, and was decommissioned nine days later, on 5 June. Conyngham was transferred back to the Navy on 30 June. Later in 1933, the ship was renamed DD-58 in order to free the name Conyngham for a new destroyer of the same name. DD-58 remained in noncommissioned status until struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 5 July 1934. She was sold for scrap on 22 August in accordance with the London Naval Treaty.|$|E

On 1 November, Tucker was renamed DD-57 in order to free the name Tucker for a new destroyer of the same name. For a time, DD-57 served as a Sea Scout training ship at Sandy Hook, New Jersey. She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 24 October 1936. DD-57 was sold on 10 December and reduced to a hulk on 23 December.|$|E

5|$|Although it {{wound up}} being {{faithful}} to the comics, many designs <b>were</b> <b>made</b> <b>for</b> Spider-Man's costumes: one concept costume designer James Acheson became fond {{of the idea of}} having a red emblem over a black costume. Another, which would eventually lead to the final product, featured an enlarged logo on the chest and red stripes going down the sides of the legs. To create Spider-Man's costume, Maguire was fitted for the skintight suit, being covered with layers of substance to create the suit's shape. It was designed as a single piece, except for the mask. The webbing, which accented the costume, was cut by computer. The mask eye lenses were designed to have a mirror look.|$|E
5|$|Although {{students}} protested Bonfire's {{environmental impact}} since 1970, no changes <b>were</b> <b>made</b> <b>for</b> decades.

The tradition, Aggie Replant, has been repeated annually. The Replant organization became independent of Bonfire in 1994 when it gained its own Student Government Committee.|$|E
5|$|As {{preparations}} <b>were</b> <b>made</b> <b>for</b> the US tour, the Beatles {{knew that}} their music {{would hardly be}} heard.

Struggling {{to compete with the}} volume of sound generated by screaming fans, the band had grown increasingly bored with the routine of performing live. Recognising that their shows were no longer about the music, they decided to make the August tour their last.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the age of}} the bucentaurs, it is {{probable}} that for ceremonies in the Venetian Lagoon the doge was simply assigned a small galley from the Venetian fleet. As Venice's wealth increased due to its naval power, plans <b>were</b> <b>made</b> <b>for</b> a special ship to be built. This is evidenced by the promissioni – sacramental pledges spoken by the doges when they were sworn into office – of Reniero Zeno of 1252, Lorenzo Tiepolo of 1268 and Giovanni Soranzo of 1312 which mention the construction of a bucentaur in the Arsenale shipyard and naval depot.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{receiving}} considerable {{numbers of}} visitors - over 16,000 in 1955 - {{it was becoming}} increasingly impractical to maintain the castle, and calls <b>were</b> <b>made</b> <b>for</b> the State {{to take over the}} property. For several decades the owners, Philip and Jewell Magnus-Allcroft, declined these proposals and continued to run the castle privately. In 1986 Jewell finally agreed to place Stokesay Castle into the guardianship of English Heritage, and the castle was left to the organisation on her death in 1992.|$|E
