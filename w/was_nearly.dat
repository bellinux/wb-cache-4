5|$|Alfonsín {{began his}} term with many {{economic}} problems. The foreign debt <b>was</b> <b>nearly</b> 43billion dollars {{by the end}} of the year, and the country had narrowly prevented a sovereign default in 1982. During that year, the gross domestic product fell by 5.6%, and the manufacturing profits by 55%. Unemployment was at nearly 10%, and inflation <b>was</b> <b>nearly</b> 209%. It also appeared unlikely that the country would receive the needed foreign investment. The country had a deficit of $6.7billion. Possible solutions such as a devaluation of the currency, privatization of industry, or restrictions on imports, would probably have proven to be unpopular.|$|E

5|$|In 1946, {{the bridge}} <b>was</b> <b>nearly</b> {{destroyed}} after a live naval mine washed ashore {{close to the}} bridge during stormy weather. The mine briefly swept one of the pillars, but did not detonate.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} {{half of the}} 2010s, CGI <b>is</b> <b>nearly</b> {{ubiquitous}} in video, pre-rendered graphics <b>are</b> <b>nearly</b> scientifically photorealistic, and real-time graphics on a suitably high-end system may simulate photorealism to the untrained eye.|$|R
5|$|Maxwell's parents met {{and married}} when they were well into their thirties; his mother <b>was</b> <b>nearly</b> 40 when he was born. They had had one earlier child, a {{daughter}} named Elizabeth, who died in infancy.|$|E
5|$|The company grew {{consistently}} {{through the}} 1980s and 1990s, attaining a $1 billion market value by 1992. In 1993, the chain's revenue <b>was</b> <b>nearly</b> {{twice that of}} any other family restaurant.|$|E
5|$|Wilhelm <b>was</b> <b>nearly</b> 30 {{years old}} when he entered the major leagues, and pitched until he <b>was</b> <b>nearly</b> 50. He retired with one of the lowest career earned run averages, 2.52, in {{baseball}} history. After retiring as a player in 1972 Wilhelm held longtime coaching jobs with the New York Yankees and Atlanta Braves. He lived in Sarasota, Florida for many years, and died there in 2002.|$|E

5|$|According to Kotaku, a remastered {{version of}} Day of the Tentacle {{was in the}} works at LucasArts Singapore before the sale of LucasArts to Disney in 2012. Though never officially approved, the game used a pseudo-3D art style and <b>was</b> <b>nearly</b> 80% complete, {{according}} to one person close to the project, but was shelved {{in the days before}} the closure of LucasArts.|$|E
5|$|Although skull {{proportions}} varied, abelisaurid skulls {{were generally}} very tall and very short in length. In Carnotaurus, for example, the skull <b>was</b> <b>nearly</b> {{as tall as}} it was long. The premaxilla in abelisaurids was very tall, so {{the front of the}} snout was blunt, not tapered as seen in many other theropods.|$|E
5|$|Brezhnev {{lived at}} 26 Kutuzovsky Prospekt, Moscow. During vacations, {{he lived in}} his Gosdacha in Zavidovo. He was married to Viktoria Brezhneva (1908–1995).

5|$|Hurricane Gabrielle {{originated}} {{in a weak}} low- to mid-level trough that <b>was</b> <b>nearly</b> stationary a short distance off the southeastern coastline of the United States. A cut off low formed over Florida on September 9, and an associated surface low pressure system formed, that was soon designated Tropical Depression Eight. The storm gradually intensified, and made landfall on Florida before emerging into the Atlantic Ocean and accelerating northeastward, as it reached peak intensity as a minimal hurricane.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, {{his friend}} Lao She {{introduced}} him to the famous pingju opera performer Xin Fengxia, who had acted in one of Wu's plays and admired his talent. They married that year, {{despite the fact that they}} were from differing socioeconomic backgrounds; she had no formal education and <b>was</b> <b>nearly</b> illiterate, while he was from a prominent family of scholars. Wu helped her to study reading, writing, and calligraphy.|$|E
5|$|In 1963, three African-American {{students}} {{brought a}} case against the Mobile County School Board for being denied admission to Murphy High School. This <b>was</b> <b>nearly</b> {{a decade after the}} United States Supreme Court had ruled in Brown v. Board of Education (1954) that segregation of public schools was unconstitutional. The federal district court ordered that the three students be admitted to Murphy for the 1964 school year, leading to the desegregation of Mobile County's school system.|$|E

50|$|Air {{pressure}} variations do {{not affect}} pitch (the ratio {{of pressure to}} air density in an ideal gas is constant. Air pressure and density changes therefore cancel, and {{have no effect on}} the speed of sound; air <b>is</b> <b>nearly</b> an ideal gas, so there <b>is</b> <b>nearly</b> no effect).|$|R
5|$|In 1997, the {{property}} was sold and the Chana School <b>was</b> <b>nearly</b> demolished. Citizens formed the Chana School Foundation to save the building. It was relocated to City Park East in Oregon, Illinois and volunteers began the process of refurbishing the building in August 1998. Five years later, in September 2003, the school had its grand opening. Since then, it has operated as a museum to help illustrate 1880s education in the United States.|$|E
5|$|In a British survey, a {{hatching}} rate of 82% and a fledging rate of 78% gave an overall 58% nesting success, {{with an average}} 2.5 surviving young per pair. In contrast, a study in northwestern France found juvenile mortality <b>was</b> <b>nearly</b> 70%. The average lifespan is not recorded, although the maximum recorded age is 10.9 years.|$|E
5|$|Lisa del Giocondo {{spent her}} final years at Florence's Saint Orsola convent where she died on July 15, 1542, {{at the age}} of 63. In a {{scholarly}} account of their lives, Francesco <b>was</b> <b>nearly</b> 80 years old when he died in 1539. Lisa may have lived until at least 1551, when she would have been 71 or72.|$|E
50|$|Traffic shaping is the {{retiming}} (delaying) of packets (or frames) {{until they}} meet specified bandwidth and or burstiness limits. Since such delays involve queues that <b>are</b> <b>nearly</b> always finite and, once full, excess traffic <b>is</b> <b>nearly</b> always dropped (discarded), traffic shaping nearly always implies traffic policing as well.|$|R

Somebody <b>is</b> <b>nearly</b> knocked down and killed every two minutes. But there--the carriages are light, {{and the horses}} curiously aware creatures. They would never tread on one.|$|R

5|$|On June5, 1908, Sebree <b>was</b> <b>nearly</b> {{killed during}} a speed {{trial of the}} Tennessee {{off the coast of}} California.

Witnesses reported that Sebree and other officers had left the boiler room only 50 seconds earlier.|$|E
5|$|Populations {{of large}} land mammals such as caribou, moose, deer, elk, have been declining {{dramatically}} since the reintroduction of wolves. Species almost entirely gone {{that were once}} common in the area include the white-tailed jackrabbit, pygmy short-horned lizard, band-tailed pigeon and passenger pigeon. After exploitation of the Kootenay basin by fur trappers, the beaver population <b>was</b> <b>nearly</b> exterminated as well.|$|E
5|$|The European tour in 1959 commemorated {{the centennial}} of the Glee Club. In {{addition}} to a four-week concert tour, the group competed in the International Eisteddfod in Llangollen, Wales, one of the world's most significant choral competitions. The boat the club were travelling on <b>was</b> <b>nearly</b> a day late arriving, nearly missing the competition, and they performed having had only three hours sleep. Despite this, the club became the first American choir ever to win the male choir competition.|$|E
