Gardiner came downstairs on Sunday, and again {{yesterday}}, and is making very rapid strides towards perfect recovery. He even went out yesterday for a few minutes. So I don't mind leaving him in the least; and indeed {{he is going to}} Sidmouth himself, probably {{at the end of the}} week. I have seen him every day without one exception, and have learnt a very great deal from him. He has studied very closely school <b>work,</b> <b>condition</b> of the labourer, boys' homes, best method of dispensing charity, &c., and on all these points his advice has been really invaluable. I feel now that I am quite to all intents working the district. People ask me about their children coming to school. I know almost all the people in the village, and a good many out of it, and begin to understand, in a very small way, what a clergyman's life is. A mixture of sorrow and pleasure indeed! There are many very sad cases of hypocrisy, filthiness, and wickedness (as I suppose there are in every district); and yesterday I had a very hard-working and in one case most painful day.|$|E

40|$|Background: Physician {{jobs are}} {{associated}} with adverse psychosocial <b>work</b> <b>conditions.</b> We summarize research {{on the relationship of}} physicians' psychosocial <b>work</b> <b>conditions</b> and quality of care. Method: A systematic literature search was conducted in MEDLINE and PsycINFO. All studies were classified into three categories of care quality outcomes: Associations between physicians' psychosocial <b>work</b> <b>conditions</b> and (1) the physician-patient-relationship, or (2) the care process and outcomes, or (3) medical errors were examined. Results: 12 publications met the inclusion criteria. Most studies relied on observational cross-sectional and controlled intervention designs. All studies provide at least partial support for physicians’ psychosocial <b>work</b> <b>conditions</b> being related to quality of care. Conclusions: This review found preliminary evidence that detrimental physicians’ psychosocial <b>work</b> <b>conditions</b> adversely influence patient care quality. Future research needs to apply strong designs to disentangle the indirect and direct effects of adverse psychosocial <b>work</b> <b>conditions</b> on physicians as well as on quality of care.

40|$|Background: Retention {{of nursing}} staff remains an {{important}} issue for health care managers. Turnover research has focused primarily on motivational and social factors as keys to retention, whereas {{the role of the}} physical <b>work</b> <b>conditions</b> has received considerably less attention. However, work design theory suggests that physical <b>work</b> <b>conditions</b> may be an important factor in fostering retention among nursing staff. Purpose: The aim {{of this study was to}} integrate work design theory with turnover process models to explore the influence of perceptions of physical <b>work</b> <b>conditions</b> on the development of turnover intentions among nursing staff. Methods: Drawing on two samples of registered nurses working in cancer units in metropolitan hospitals in the southeastern United States, this study explores the impact of perceptions of physical <b>work</b> <b>conditions</b> on turnover intentions using ordinary least squares regression. Hypotheses are tested in Study 1 and replicated in Study 2. A measure of perceptions of physical <b>work</b> <b>conditions</b> is also developed and validated using exploratory (Study 1) and confirmatory (Study 2) factor analyses. Findings: Perceptions of physical <b>work</b> <b>conditions</b> explain variance in turnover intentions above than that explained by motivational and social factors. Specifically, employee perceptions of noisy <b>work</b> <b>conditions</b> are found to significantly increase turnover intentions, whereas perceptions that <b>work</b> <b>conditions</b> facilitate tasks were found to significantly reduce turnover intentions. Perceptions of temperature and health hazard did not show significant effects. Practice Implications: Results suggest that health care managers and scholars should re-examine the role of physical <b>work</b> <b>conditions</b> in the turnover process. Investments in upgrades that facilitate tasks may foster retention better than investments that simply improve employee comfort. Negative perceptions of <b>work</b> <b>conditions</b> may have no impact if they are considered a normal "part of the job," although negative perceptions of conditions that are viewed as under the organization's control may be important in creating a desire to leave...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Attempts to {{identify}} particular aspects of psychosocial <b>work</b> <b>conditions</b> {{as predictors of}} sickness absence remain inconclusive. A global measure has previously been suggested to be {{an efficient way to}} measure psychosocial <b>work</b> <b>conditions</b> in questionnaires. This paper investigates whether satisfaction with specific aspects of psychosocial <b>work</b> <b>conditions</b> explains sickness absence beyond its association with a global measure of psychosocial <b>work</b> <b>conditions.</b> Methods The participants were 13, 437 employees from 698 public service workplaces in Aarhus County, Denmark. 33 items from a questionnaire fell in groupings around six aspects of psychosocial work conditions: skill discretion, professionalism, management, decision authority, workload and cooperation. A global measure rating satisfaction with psychosocial <b>work</b> <b>conditions</b> on a scale from 0 to 10 was also included in the questionnaire. Individual ratings were aggregated to workplace scores. Analysis of variance and multiple linear regression was used to compare the average number of days of yearly sickness absence with different levels of satisfaction with six aspects of psychosocial <b>work</b> <b>conditions.</b> The covariates included were gender, age, occupation, size of workplace, contact to hospital, civil status and children below 13 living at home. Results Dissatisfaction with each of the six aspects of psychosocial <b>work</b> <b>conditions</b> was associated with an increase in sickness absence. When all aspects were simultaneously included in the model, only skill discretion and professionalism were negatively associated with sickness absence. When a global measure of satisfaction with psychosocial <b>work</b> <b>conditions</b> was also included in the model none of the specific aspects showed a statistically significant association with sickness absence. Conclusion Low global satisfaction with psychosocial <b>work</b> <b>conditions</b> is associated with increased levels of sickness absence. Including specific aspects of psychosocial <b>work</b> <b>conditions</b> in the model does not provide further information regarding the nature of this association. </p...|$|R

5000|$|The second {{experiment}} {{was necessary to}} manipulate expectations of coworker's productivity to rule out individual differences as a factor. The generation task employed is a modification of the first experiment. Unlike the first experiment, the participants {{were told that the}} task was related to intelligence to ensure that the task was perceived as meaningful. This was a two-by-two experiment in which coworker effort, either high or low, was crossed with <b>work</b> <b>condition,</b> group or individual; and the results showed support for the social compensation hypothesis. Coworker effort was manipulated using a confederate. When the experimenter momentarily left the room to retrieve a [...] "forgotten stopwatch," [...] a confederate said to the other participants that he thought the {{experiment was}} interesting, and that he was either going to work hard on the task or was not planning on working hard based on condition. Participants were willing to compensate for an underperforming coworker to avoid a negative group product due to perceived personal significance.|$|E
5000|$|The {{purpose of}} the final {{experiment}} was to test whether personal significance increases likelihood of social compensation and if perceived coworker's lack of ability, rather than lack of motivation, can lead to social compensation. This expanded the study one step further with a two-by-two-by-two design: Personal significance, high or low; <b>work</b> <b>condition,</b> alone or group; and coworker ability, low or high. The procedure of this experiment nearly matches that of the second, much like the procedure of the second nearly matches that of the first. In the first meaningfulness condition, a female undergraduate displaying an unprofessional demeanor, conducted the experiment. She informed the participants that she was conducting the experiment due to an [...] "incomplete" [...] earned in a class, and did not conduct the experiment seriously, demonstrating low meaning. In the second, the experimenter was a male graduate {{who appeared to be}} highly involved. In this situation, the participants were also told that the task relates to intelligence and is of the utmost importance. Coworker ability was manipulated using a confederate. As in the second experiment, the experimenter [...] "forgot the stopwatch" [...] and momentarily left the room. During this time a confederate either confessed to the other participants that he was not especially skilled or was skilled at tasks such as the given generation task. The results showed support for the social compensation hypothesis. In addition, it was found that social compensation is limited to tasks that have personal significance and that social compensation may occur due to different attributions than lack of motivation such as inability.|$|E

40|$|Although {{working hours}} are {{generally}} regarded as a major indicator of stress, little exploration has been done about how working hours influence stress with the relevant individual and job characteristics. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the relationships among perceived working hours, general stress, work centrality, job control, job demands, and <b>work</b> <b>condition</b> constraints for full-time employees in the United States and Korea. A self-administered questionnaire survey approach was used to collect data which were utilized to reflect six variables of this study. The sample size was 805 (U. S. : 397, Korea: 408). As the results from the measurement invariance test indicated that the measurement model was not invariant by country, statistical examinations were conducted separately for each country to test hypotheses. In the path analysis, for the U. S. sample, Job Demands was significantly associated with Perceived Working Hours. Job Demands and <b>Work</b> <b>Condition</b> Constraints were significantly related to General Stress. There was a significant relationship between <b>Work</b> <b>Condition</b> Constraints and Job Demands. There were significant mediation effects for the relationships between <b>Work</b> <b>Condition</b> Constraints and Perceived Working Hours via Job Demands and between <b>Work</b> <b>Condition</b> Constraints and General Stress via Job Demands. For the Korean sample, in the path analysis, Work Centrality and Job Demands were significantly associated with Perceived Working Hours. Job Demands, Job Control, and <b>Work</b> <b>Condition</b> Constraints were significantly associated with General Stress. There was a significant relationship between <b>Work</b> <b>Condition</b> Constraints and Job Demands. All the hypothesized mediation effects were significant: from Job Demands via Perceived Working Hours to General Stress, from <b>Work</b> <b>Condition</b> Constraints via Job Demands to Perceived Working Hours, and <b>Work</b> <b>Condition</b> Constraints via Job Demands to General Stress. It was found that this study overall supported the selected theories and related research. The significance of this study includes contributions to work-life/work-family balance studies that are an emerging research area in HRD, practical implications for sound work-settings, and cultural validations of the theories related to working hours and stress.
