5|$|After the {{departure}} of the Hohokam, groups of Akimel O'odham (commonly known as Pima), Tohono O'odham and Maricopa tribes began to use the area, as well as segments of the Yavapai and Apache. The O'odham were offshoots of the Sobaipuri tribe, who in turn <b>were</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the descendants of the formerly urbanized Hohokam.|$|E

5|$|Like other fairywrens, the red-winged fairywren is {{unrelated}} to the true wrens. Initially fairywrens <b>were</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{a member of the}} old world flycatcher family Muscicapidae or warbler family Sylviidae before being placed in the newly recognised Maluridae in 1975. More recently, DNA analysis has shown the family to be related to Meliphagidae (honeyeaters) and Pardalotidae (peep-wrens) in a large superfamily, Meliphagoidea.|$|E
5|$|On 18 May, the {{strength}} of the Arab Legion deployed around Latrun and Bab al-Wad was sufficient, and the road was blocked again. The Israeli general staff needed several days to assess the actual disposition of the Jordanian forces around Latrun and Jerusalem because these latter <b>were</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> at several locations in the country.|$|E
5|$|The Harry Potter {{books have}} also gained {{recognition}} for sparking {{an interest in}} reading among the young {{at a time when}} children <b>were</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> abandoning books for computers and television, although it is reported that despite the huge uptake of the books, adolescent reading has continued to decline.|$|E

5|$|An {{analysis}} of the invertebrate population in the canopy of Banksia woodland found that mites and ticks (Acari), beetles (Coleoptera) and ants, bees and wasps (Hymenoptera) predominated overall, with the three orders also common on B. ilicifolia, although outnumbered by thrips (Thysanoptera). More arthropods on B. ilicifolia {{might be related to}} a higher nutrient (potassium) level in the leaves. Lower overall numbers of invertebrates on Banksia species <b>were</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> related to the presence of insectivorous birds.|$|E
5|$|Both {{the climate}} and land of Palestine, {{where most of the}} Bible takes place, were well-suited to growing grapes, and the wine that the {{vineyards}} produced was a valued commodity in ancient times, both for local consumption and for its value in trade. Trade with Egypt was quite extensive. Jews were a wine-drinking culture well before the foundation of Rome. Vintage wines were found in the tomb of King Scorpion in Hierakonpolis. Archaeological evidence suggests that Semitic predecessors <b>were</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> responsible for the vintages that were found in the tomb. Vineyards were protected from robbers and animals by walls, hedges, and manned watchtowers.|$|E

5|$|Brolgas are {{widespread}} and often abundant in north and north-east Australia, especially north-east Queensland, and are common {{as far south}} as Victoria. They are also found in southern New Guinea and as rare vagrants in New Zealand and the northern part of Western Australia. The population in northern Australia is estimated at between 20,000 and 100,000 birds and in southern Australia, 1,000 birds. The numbers of individuals in New Guinea are unknown. Until 1961, Brolgas <b>were</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the only species of crane in Australia, until the Sarus Crane showed up.|$|E
5|$|East Lawn {{was laid}} {{out in front of}} the east window and was used for grand bazaars and fêtes until the early 20th century. A ha-ha was {{installed}} behind to keep cattle out of the grounds. To the south of the priory buildings the Long Terrace ran almost the full length of the grounds. It afforded access to the ruins via a flight of steps flanked by two carved demi-sea wolves, reflecting the coat of arms of the Chaloners. They <b>were</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> dragons by local people and the steps were referred to as the Dragon Steps.|$|E
5|$|Following World War II, a {{nationwide}} movement pressed {{to return to}} pre-war society {{as quickly as possible}} in the U.S. When combined with the increasing national paranoia about communism and psychoanalytic theory that had become pervasive in medical knowledge, homosexuality became an undesired characteristic of employees working for the U.S. government in 1950. Homosexuals <b>were</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> vulnerable targets to blackmail, and the government purged its employment ranks of open homosexuals, beginning a widespread effort to gather intelligence about employees' private lives. State and local governments followed suit, arresting people for congregating in bars and parks, and enacting laws against cross-dressing for men and women.|$|E
50|$|CU {{traits are}} {{relatively}} stable, though {{some studies suggest}} that they may decrease over time through effective treatment. Early intervention <b>is</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more effective because CU traits <b>are</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more malleable early in life.|$|R

5|$|Following the {{publication}} of Madsen's influential monograph, Allosauridae became the preferred family assignment, but it too was not strongly defined. Semi-technical works used Allosauridae {{for a variety of}} large theropods, usually those that were larger and better-known than megalosaurids. Typical theropods that <b>were</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> related to Allosaurus included Indosaurus, Piatnitzkysaurus, Piveteausaurus, Yangchuanosaurus, Acrocanthosaurus, Chilantaisaurus, Compsosuchus, Stokesosaurus, and Szechuanosaurus. Given modern knowledge of theropod diversity and the advent of cladistic study of evolutionary relationships, none of these theropods is now recognized as an allosaurid, although several, like Acrocanthosaurus and Yangchuanosaurus, are members of closely related families.|$|E
5|$|For a long time, {{bivalves}} <b>were</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> better {{adapted to}} aquatic life than brachiopods were, outcompeting and relegating them to minor niches in later ages. These two taxa appeared in textbooks {{as an example}} of replacement by competition. Evidence given for this included the fact that bivalves needed less food to subsist because of their energetically efficient ligament-muscle system for opening and closing valves. All this has been broadly disproven, though; rather, the prominence of modern bivalves over brachiopods seems due to chance disparities in their response to extinction events.|$|E
5|$|Highly {{combustible}} materials that leave little residue, such as wood or coal, <b>were</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> made mostly of phlogiston; non-combustible substances that corrode, such as iron, contained very little. Air {{did not play}} a role in phlogiston theory, nor were any initial quantitative experiments conducted to test the idea; instead, it was based on observations of what happens when something burns, that most common objects appear to become lighter and seem to lose something in the process.|$|E
50|$|Their {{sense of}} smell <b>is</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> poor, and their eyes are {{degenerated}} and vision <b>is</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> limited <b>to</b> the detection of light, but the shrew compensates by using echolocation and a fine sense of touch.|$|R
5000|$|This <b>is</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> due <b>to</b> {{increased}} sulfur containing substrate {{available to}} gut microbiota enabling increased volatile sulfur compound (VSC) release during gut fermentation (VSC <b>are</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the primary {{contributors to the}} odor of flatus and feces).|$|R
25|$|Late nineteenth century: Ahhotep I <b>was</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{the wife}} of Seqenenre Tao.

Ahhotep II <b>was</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{the wife of}} Amenhotep I. Some thought the coffin from the Deir el-Bahari cache belonged to the queen called Ahhotep II in this scheme.|$|R
5|$|In 1945, Glenn Seaborg, an American scientist, {{made the}} {{suggestion}} that the actinide elements, like the lanthanides, were filling an f sub-level. Before this time the actinides <b>were</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> forming a fourth d-block row. Seaborg's colleagues advised him not to publish such a radical suggestion as it would most likely ruin his career. As Seaborg considered he did not then have a career to bring into disrepute, he published anyway. Seaborg's suggestion was found to be correct and he subsequently {{went on to win the}} 1951 Nobel Prize in chemistry for his work in synthesizing actinide elements.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, Rosendo Pascual {{and colleagues}} {{described}} a jaw of Sudamerica. Because {{some of this}} jaw's features <b>were</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> incompatible with a multituberculate identity, they regarded gondwanatheres (including Ferugliotherium) as Mammalia incertae sedis. However, in 2009 Yamila Gurovich and Robin Beck argued {{in favor of a}} close relationship between gondwanatheres (including Ferugliotherium) and multituberculates. The controversy is partially due to disagreement over the assignment of two upper premolars and the jaw fragment described by Kielan-Jaworowska and Bonaparte in 1996; Gurovich and Beck identify these as Ferugliotherium, while Kielan-Jaworowska and others regard them as indeterminate multituberculates.|$|E
5|$|In the episode, alien time {{traveller}} the Doctor (Matt Smith) and {{his companions}} Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) and Rory Williams (Arthur Darvill) receive a distress call from a living Time Lord, though all {{other members of the}} Doctor's race <b>were</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> extinct. However, they discover that the call was bait to lure the Doctor to an asteroid outside the universe, where previously the energy of Time Lords' TARDISes has been consumed by an entity called the House (voiced by Michael Sheen). The matrix of the Doctor's TARDIS is removed and placed in the body of a woman named Idris (Suranne Jones), who proceeds to help them escape.|$|E
