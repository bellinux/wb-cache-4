40|$|Land {{application}} of biosolids is a desirable solution for smaller communities that utilize aerobic digestion. However, traditional aerobic digestion produces Class B biosolids at best which raises public concern regarding {{the fate of}} pathogens following land application. The main goal of this work was to determine a plan to help an aerobic digestion WWTP achieve improved pathogen destruction. An approach of studying {{the effect of a}} pre-treatment step prior to digestion was developed following site visits to eight aerobic digestion facilities in Ontario. The experimental phases of this work evaluated the effect of aeration rate, temperature and retention time on pathogen reduction in 12 setups. The four best conditions were carried out with digestion to evaluate the ultimate impact of pre-treatment on digestion. The results indicated that a micro-aerobic, highly reducing environment produces adverse conditions <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>pre-treatment</b> column which also impact subsequent digestion and resulted in decreased pathogens...|$|E
40|$|Currently {{most of the}} {{remotely}} monitored {{equipment at}} Royal Perth Hospital is hardwired, but is gradually being replaced with wireless systems {{with the development of}} cheaper and more reliable solutions. This thesis tests and compares two wireless systems and analyses which one best fits Royal Perth Hospital’s requirements. Thorough testing and comparison was required because once installed, the selected solution was required to be the main monitoring system used in the future. From there the selected system was installed and commissioned <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pre-Treatment</b> Plant of Haemodialysis. Commissioning of the chosen software entailed configuring the manufacturers Web Server with required sensor settings, alarm limits and email addresses. In addition to the installation, this thesis briefly investigates the possibility of a fully automated chlorine analyser for the Pre-Treatment Plant. This would create an excellent long term logging solution with the nurses no longer needing to hand test chlorine levels each day. Although the Web Server satisfied the hospitals needs in the short term, a longer term solution needed to be found. Perl script was created to communicate from the Web Servers data tables to Royal Perth Hospitals’ server. This script was able to transfer all required data and pass it through to the new server, Fully Automated Nagios. This new script allows for improved data viewing, emailing capabilities, and longer term data storage. This thesis summarises the work required to install, commission and configure a system that monitors pressures, temperature and contact switches, as well as educate the reader on the development, implementation and testing of such a system. Since the Technical Services Division has an ISO 9001 accredited QA system, as required a large part of this thesis focused {{on the development of the}} project details, such as the development of wiring diagrams, server templates, comment logs, bill of materials and most importantly, the complete service and operator manuals. Through the research and development of this thesis it was found that the project could be used to monitor other wards and so could be repeated in the future within Royal Perth Hospital and possibly Western Australian Health...|$|E
40|$|Declining {{population}} {{trends of}} breeding birds associated with mature {{forests of the}} eastern and central United States {{have been a major}} concern for conservationists and land managers. As a landscape-scale, long-term, manipulative experiment, the Hardwood Ecosystem Experiment (HEE) may provide important insights into factors associated with these declines. By employing various timber harvest practices, this project enabled me to compare the effects of uneven-aged management and even-aged management with unharvested control sites. I also quantified the characteristics of the breeding bird community at the HEE sites during the pre-treatment period alone. The harvests took place in winter 2008, allowing collection of 3 years of pre-treatment data and 2 years of post-treatment data. From 2006 - 2010, I observed 85 species of birds across 240 survey points, and a total of 32, 270 detections. Based on general habitat requirements, I chose 5 species to represent the early successional guild and 7 species for the mature forest guild. After making adjustments for differences in detectability, I used analysis of variance to compare the means of each species 2 ̆ 7 population in the management types. <b>Within</b> <b>the</b> <b>pre-treatment</b> data, there were no significant effects among the treatment types when the mean of the 3 years was used for the analysis. The bird communities were also similar to the nearby Hoosier National Forest, which provides further evidence that the pre-treatment data will be useful in detecting changes associated with the HEE treatments. With the exception of Brown-headed Cowbird (Molothrus ater, which had no significant effects) the other early successional species responded positively to the treatments. Indigo Bunting (Passerina cyanea) and Eastern Towhee (Pipilo erythrophthalmus) populations significantly increased in uneven- and even-aged management units, while Carolina Wren (Thryothorus ludovicianus) populations significantly increased in all 3 management types. Mature forest species had a much more varied response to treatments. Red-eyed Vireo (Vireo olivaceus), Scarlet Tanager (Piranga olivacea), Worm-eating Warbler (Helmitheros vermivorum), and Wood Thrush (Hylocichla mustelina) did not respond significantly to treatments. Acadian Flycatcher (Empidonax virescens) abundance increased pre- to post-treatment in control units and uneven-aged units, while Cerulean Warbler (Setophaga cerulea) abundance increased in even-aged and uneven-aged units. Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapilla) populations significantly declined in uneven-aged units, but remained stable in even-aged management units and control units. My results suggest that not all members of a species guild are likely to respond similarly to forest harvesting, and that management practices must be tailored to the species of concern. ...|$|E

30|$|Triticale {{and wheat}} straws were also pre-treated by aqueous-IL {{solutions}} {{and the results}} obtained were compared to pre-treatments using pure ILs [96, 97]. Fu et al. observed {{a strong correlation between}} cellulose digestibility, lignin removal and crystallinity index of cellulose for <b>the</b> <b>pre-treatment</b> of triticale straw in aqueous-[emim][CH 3 COO] solution [96]. Upon decreasing the water content (95 % to 0 % w/w), an increased amount of lignin was extracted simultaneously with a crystalline reduction of the cellulose. However, after pre-treatment performances (150 °C, 90  minutes) cellulose digestibility was substantially enhanced for aqueous-[emim][CH 3 COO] with 50 % water content (w/w) achieving the highest sugar yield (81.0 %), higher than that observed for pure [emim][CH 3 COO] (67.4 %). Therefore, <b>the</b> <b>pre-treatment</b> efficiency is higher for pure IL in respect to lignin removal and crystallinity reduction. Nevertheless, if <b>the</b> goal of <b>pre-treatment</b> is to enhance the digestibility of carbohydrates and maximise the release of fermentable sugars, <b>the</b> <b>pre-treatment</b> with aqueous-[emim][CH 3 COO] was demonstrated to be more efficient, since it retains more carbohydrates and subsequently enhances its digestibility [96]. Fu et al. provided a deeper study on <b>the</b> <b>pre-treatment</b> with aqueous-IL solutions performing an RSM statistical approach with wheat straw and [emim][CH 3 COO] as the biomass and IL chosen [97]. They studied <b>the</b> effects of <b>pre-treatment</b> temperature (130 - 170 °C), time (0.5 - 5.5  hour) and water content (0 - 100 %) on lignin removal and cellulose/xylan digestibility. The optimised conditions were determined to be 158 °C, 3.6  hours with 50.5 % water content (w/w) where 71.4 % of the fermentable sugars recovery was determined as the predicted value. In comparison with <b>the</b> <b>pre-treatment</b> with pure [emim][CH 3 COO], the temperature and time were found to also be beneficial for the digestibility of carbohydrates from <b>the</b> <b>pre-treatment</b> with aqueous-[emim][CH 3 COO]. In this study, lignin was largely extracted and the crystallinity reduced in pre-treatment with aqueous-[emim][CH 3 COO] leading to a significant enhancement of the enzymatic hydrolysis. However, it seems that a higher temperature and time of pre-treatment are preferable to achieve the same efficiency as pre-treatment with pure ILs [97]. Nevertheless, <b>the</b> results for <b>pre-treatment</b> with aqueous-IL solution were similar to that observed in pure IL pre-treatment, but with less intensity. Due to the lower usage and easier recycling of ionic liquids, as well as the reduced viscosity of <b>the</b> handling solution, <b>pre-treatment</b> with aqueous-IL mixture are potentially cost-effective. However, a more envisaged investigation is required, mainly about the acidic properties of water at high temperatures and its effect on biomass pre-treatment.|$|R

In the present study, for <b>the</b> proper <b>pre-treatment</b> of alkaline waste-waters, a package of alkalophilic bacteria is formulated to neutralise the alkaline pH of the industrial waste-waters. The developed microbial package is cost-effective as well as environmental friendly. Keywords—alkaline, alkalophilic bacteria, biological, pollutants, textile. T I...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown the {{effectiveness}} of Free Nitrous Acid (FNA) pre-treatment in enhancing sludge biodegradability and improving its methane production potential. FNA is regarded as an environmental friendly pre-treatment which can be easily applied when a source of nitrite is present in wastewater treatment plants. However, when nitrite is not available {{and needs to be}} purchased, this treatment can become less attractive due to the costs associated to nitrite. In order to overcome this possible limitation, two different strategies to optimize the use of nitrite during FNA treatment were investigated: i) Recovering NO 2 (-) after <b>the</b> <b>pre-treatment</b> is completed; and ii) Concentrating the sludge before FNA pre-treatment. Results show that recovering NO 2 (-) from the pre-treated sludge is not suitable due to the loss of soluble organic matter present in the supernatant after <b>the</b> <b>pre-treatment.</b> However, concentrating <b>the</b> sludge before <b>the</b> <b>pre-treatment</b> seems a good strategy to optimize the use of nitrite...|$|R
3000|$|Table  4 {{presents}} <b>the</b> <b>pre-treatment</b> (i.e., before 1985) sample averages of all predictors for {{the states}} with strong coverage (column 2), {{as well as for}} the synthetic control group (column 3), and for the full group of control states (column 4). As shown, prior to the passage of the first strong mandate to cover, new mothers in control states were already younger than in states where strong mandates to cover eventually passed. These mothers also earned lower wages on average and, were less educated, more likely to be married, less likely to have an abortion, less likely to participate in the labour market, less likely to be employed and less likely to have employer-provided health insurance coverage. <b>The</b> predictors’ <b>pre-treatment</b> values for <b>the</b> strongly treated states resemble <b>the</b> <b>pre-treatment</b> values of <b>the</b> synthetic control group (column 3) much more than <b>the</b> <b>pre-treatment</b> values for <b>the</b> full set of control states (column 4 [...]). Hence, the synthetic control group should be a better counterfactual for the treated groups. Tables for the white sample and for IL-MA-RI are similar but are not reported here in the interest of brevity.|$|R
