50|$|Despite {{consulting}} with many handwriting experts, some disagree with Grant's claims. Document examiner Janis Parker {{concluded that the}} suicide note was written by Kurt Cobain after spending two weeks examining the actual note. <b>When</b> <b>Dateline</b> NBC sent {{a copy of the}} note to four different handwriting experts, one concluded that the entire note was in Cobain's hand, while the other three said the sample was inconclusive. One expert contacted by the television series Unsolved Mysteries noted the difficulty in drawing a conclusion, given that the note being studied was a photocopy, not the original. But in the very same documentary two other experts found the writing, especially the last four lines, suspicious.|$|E
5000|$|Over several years, the Greenbergs visited many specialists, {{looking for}} an {{explanation}} for their daughter's strange condition, yet there was no diagnosis of any known genetic syndrome or chromosomal abnormality. [...] In 2001, <b>when</b> <b>Dateline</b> documented Brooke, she was still {{the size of a}} six-month-old infant, weighing just 13 lb (5.9 kg) at 30 inches (76 cm) tall. The family still had no explanation. Brooke's mother Melanie said, [...] "They specialists just said she’ll catch up. Then we went to the nutritionist, the endocrinologist. We tried the growth hormone…". The growth hormone treatment had no effect. Howard, Brooke's father, said, [...] "I mean, she did not put on an ounce, or she did not grow an inch... That’s when I knew there was a problem." [...] After the growth hormone administration failed, the doctors, unable to diagnose a known condition, named her condition Syndrome X.|$|E
25|$|The {{resulting}} inquiry led to {{the discovery}} of fabrication and plagiarism in a number of articles written by Blair. Some fabrications include Blair's claims to have traveled from New York to the city mentioned in the <b>dateline,</b> <b>when</b> he did not.|$|R
500|$|The {{ketogenic}} diet achieved {{national media}} exposure in the US in October 1994, <b>when</b> NBC's <b>Dateline</b> television programme reported {{the case of}} Charlie Abrahams, son of Hollywood producer Jim Abrahams. The two-year-old suffered from epilepsy that had remained uncontrolled by mainstream and alternative therapies. Abrahams discovered {{a reference to the}} ketogenic diet in an epilepsy guide for parents and brought Charlie to John Freeman at Johns Hopkins Hospital, which had continued to offer the therapy. Under the diet, Charlie's epilepsy was rapidly controlled and his developmental progress resumed. This inspired Abrahams to create the Charlie Foundation to promote the diet and fund research. A multicentre prospective study began in 1994, the results were presented to the American Epilepsy Society in 1996 and were published in 1998. There followed an explosion of scientific interest in the diet. In 1997, Abrahams produced a TV movie, ...First Do No Harm, starring Meryl Streep, in which a young boy's intractable epilepsy is successfully treated by the ketogenic diet.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the time}} Philip divided {{his time between}} several places in Spain (the {{construction}} of El Escorial had only recently been started). One of his favorite houses was La Casa del Bosque de Segovia, a mansion in the woods near Segovia. Of course, his voluminous correspondence used this place in the <b>dateline</b> <b>when</b> he sojourned there. There are therefore thousands of [...] "letters from the Segovia woods" [...] extant, but the two sets concerning the religious-policy question he sent subsequent to Egmont's visit from this place have become associated with their dateline in Dutch and English historiography.|$|R
5000|$|Although it {{had been}} in {{operation}} since 1997, the Hive gained broader awareness in 2001 <b>when</b> a <b>Dateline</b> NBC special The [...] "X" [...] Files aired. This investigation into the use and production of MDMA featured the Hive and its founder, who operated under the pseudonym 'Strike' (Hobart Huson). Strike was the founder and site designer of the Hive as well as the author of several popular books (Total Synthesis I and II, and Sources) instructing readers how to synthesize a variety of amphetamines, obtain equipment and chemicals, and avoid prosecution. He remained anonymous until Dateline's investigation and interviews revealed that Hobart Huson (owner of the Strike-recommended laboratory supplier [...] "Science Alliance") was the man behind Strike. The NBC program showed Huson/Strike at his office/chemical warehouse, complete with a stuffed bee sitting by his computer. The program led to Huson's arrest and imprisonment, but also spurred the site's growth. A person by the username 'Rhodium' and a small group of dedicated individuals actually ran the Hive and its sister site Rhodium.ws for most of the sites' lifespans.|$|R
