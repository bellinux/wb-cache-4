25|$|Birefringence is {{utilized}} in medical diagnostics. One powerful accessory used with optical microscopes {{is a pair}} of crossed polarizing filters. Light from the source is polarized in the X direction after passing through the first polarizer, but above the specimen is a polarizer (a so-called analyzer) oriented in the Y direction. Therefore, no light from the source <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>accepted</b> by the analyzer, and the field will appear dark. However areas of the sample possessing birefringence will generally couple some of the X-polarized light into the Y polarization; these areas will then appear bright against the dark background. Modifications to this basic principle can differentiate between positive and negative birefringence.|$|E
25|$|Since 4 April 2005, as per the Gender Recognition Act 2004, it is {{possible}} for transgender people to change their legal gender in the UK, allowing them to acquire a new birth certificate, affording them full recognition of their acquired sex in law for all purposes. Transgender people must present evidence to a Gender Recognition Panel, which considers their case and issues a Gender Recognition Certificate (GRC); they must have transitioned two years before a GRC is issued. It is not a requirement for sex reassignment surgery to have taken place, although such surgery <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>accepted</b> as part of the supporting evidence for a case where it has taken place. There is formal approval of medical gender reassignment available either on the National Health Service (NHS) or privately.|$|E
25|$|Whether the Western Rite survives in the Eastern Orthodox Church and <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>accepted</b> by the {{majority}} who follow the Byzantine Rite remains yet to be seen. In the meantime, the Byzantine Rite bishops who oversee Western Rite parishes and many who oversee no Western Rite parishes continue to declare the Western Rite members of their Church to be Orthodox Christians and regard them as fully in communion {{with the rest of}} the Church. Though there have been negative appraisals on both sides of the Western Rite issue, supporters of the Western Rite claim that there is nothing inherently divisive about having a separate liturgical practice, particularly since these churches remain under the pastoral care of their diocesan bishop rather than a Western Rite bishop. As yet, there are no schisms within the episcopacy of any Orthodox Church regarding the issue of Western Rite parishes.|$|E

25|$|While often formal, Seymour hides {{a twisted}} desire to save Spira by {{becoming}} Sin and destroying the world. This resulted from his father's treatment {{who had his}} wife and son exiled to the island of Baaj since Seymour was considered an abomination by the Guados. Afterwards, Seymour's mother gave her life in the Baaj Temple to become the fayth of the aeon Anima, believing that by sacrificing herself for Spira's temporary peace against Sin, her son <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>accepted</b> by Spira's people. At eighteen years of age, Seymour's exile was revoked and he soon killed Jyscal and took his position. He asks summoner Yuna to marry him, seemingly to further unite Spira, as they both have mixed parentage, being the offspring of a human and another race. When Yuna's guardians learn of Seymour's motives, they stand against him and kill him. Seymour's spirit is able to remain in the living world and become an unsent. Seymour later reveals his plans for Yuna – to have her turn him into the next Sin. His pyreflies are later absorbed by Sin. There, Seymour begins seeking a means to control the creature from within. During this process, he is confronted a final time by Yuna and her guardians, who manage to break their way inside the creature's body. However, he is defeated and is sent to the Farplane by Yuna.|$|E

After two years, Professor Adler was quietly let go. Seligman demanded an inquiry.

Many countries recognize U.S.-trained MDs as applicants for licensure, granting successful applicants [...] "unlimited" [...] practice rights. The American Osteopathic Association has lobbied the governments of other countries to recognize U.S.-trained DOs similarly to their M.D. counterparts, with some success. In over 65 countries, U.S.-trained DOs have unlimited practice rights. In 2005, after one year of deliberations, the General Medical Council announced that U.S.-trained DOs <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>accepted</b> for full medical practice rights in the United Kingdom.
