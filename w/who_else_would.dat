They wanted these new characters to be scientists, who {{would be interested in}} finding the island for their own personal reasons. They decided to create a character who would be interested in lost civilizations, and named her Charlotte Staples Lewis as a reference to C. S. Lewis, which Lost producer Damon Lindelof said was a clue to the direction the show would be taking during season four.|$|E

Ford said he loved the idea of introducing Indiana's father because it allowed him to explore another side to Indiana's personality: [...] "These are men who have never made any accommodation to each other. Indy behaves differently in his father's presence. <b>Who</b> <b>else</b> <b>would</b> dare call Indy 'junior'?" ...|$|E

During the casting of the [...] "freighter folk"the nickname that Losts producers Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse use to refer to Daniel, Charlotte, Miles and Frankfake names, occupations and scenes were temporarily assigned, to limit the leak of spoilers. In the initial casting call, Daniel was referred as [...] "brilliant mathematician" [...] "Russell".|$|E

500|$|After {{dinner the}} guests signed the {{visitors}} book, {{after which the}} prince—accompanied by Coventry, Williams and the two Somersets—received Lycett Green and the other accusers. After hearing {{what they had to}} say, the prince dismissed all except Coventry and Williams, and called for Gordon-Cumming, who told Edward that the accusation was [...] "foul and abominable"; the prince pointed out that [...] "there are five accusers against you". Gordon-Cumming then withdrew while the royal party discussed what the next steps would be. He returned after half an hour to find just the two courtiers, who urged him to sign a document that they had drafted. Under pressure, and still denying the accusations, Gordon-Cumming signed the document without knowing <b>who</b> <b>else</b> <b>would</b> sign it afterwards.|$|E
500|$|Santana (Naya Rivera), Brittany (Heather Morris), and Mercedes (Amber Riley) {{are worried}} because Coach Beiste (Dot-Marie Jones) has not left her abusive husband, Cooter (Eric Bruskotter), as she claimed. Beiste tells them that adult {{relationships}} {{are more complex}} and insists she is fine. Hockey player Rick [...] "The Stick" [...] (Rock Anthony) ridicules Puck for being seen in the dress; they agree to a fight outside the school. Rick gains the upper hand and Puck is thrown into a dumpster, but he emerges brandishing a switchblade. Coach Beiste breaks up the fight; in the locker room, Puck tells her that the knife is a fake stage prop, and she retorts {{that he could have}} gotten expelled. Puck replies that he is flunking out anyway and a failure, telling her that she does not {{know what it feels like}} to be worthless. He breaks down, and Beiste comforts him as he cries. At home, Beiste tells Cooter that she is leaving him, and removes her wedding ring. He asks <b>who</b> <b>else</b> <b>would</b> love her; she answers: [...] "Me". Back at the school auditorium, she joins Puck in singing [...] "Mean", tells him that she has arranged for him to retake a crucial test to graduate, and promises to help him pass. As the episode ends, Rachel and Tina sing [...] "Flashdance... What a Feeling", and board the glee club's bus to Nationals.|$|E
500|$|After Naomi Dorrit (Marsha Thomason) {{landed on}} the island in season three, the {{producers}} began to plan <b>who</b> <b>else</b> <b>would</b> be on the boat she came from. They wanted these new characters {{to be interested in}} finding the island for their own personal reasons. The team created consisted of Frank, Daniel Faraday, Charlotte Lewis and Miles Straume, referred to as the [...] "freighter folk". Their relationship with the survivors of Flight 815 formed the crux of the fourth season. Co-executive producer/writer Edward Kitsis had been pitching the name [...] "Lapidus" [...] for years, finally naming an unseen character in the fourteenth episode of the third season Rick Lapidus. Unsatisfied, Kitsis developed the character [...] "Frank Lapidus, Helicopter Pilot". According to producers Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse, Jeff Fahey [...] "was the first and only choice for the role". Cuse had enjoyed Fahey's roles in The Lawnmower Man and The Marshal, and he and Lindelof commended his [...] "intense eyes", stating that [...] "he has exactly the right sensibilities" [...] for the part. Fahey was offered the part without having to audition. At the time the producers began to consider him for the role, he had taken a break from acting and was living in Afghanistan, doing charity work and running an orphanage in Kabul. When Cuse contacted him about appearing in the show, Fahey was {{on the top of a}} mountain in Caracas, Venezuela during a rainstorm, having just opened an orphanage. He had never seen the series before, but the producers talked him through the first three seasons in an attempt to convince him to return to acting and accept the role. When he was cast, Fahey was unaware of whether he would be a guest star, or would develop into a regular. Focus on the character was diminished by the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike, which resulted in the fourth season being cut short. The latter half of the season did feature the character more predominately, however some stories planned for Frank and his fellow freighter folk had to be deferred to the fifth season.|$|E

6000|$|Cyril {{held her}} hand in his, and raised it tenderly to his lips. Elma looked at him, half surprised. Only her hand, how strange of him. Cyril read the unspoken thought, as she would have read it herself, and {{answered}} quickly, [...] "Never, Elma, now, till Guy has cleared himself of this deadly accusation.

5000|$|On May 18, 2009 it was {{revealed}} so far Sparks had recorded 30 songs for the album but would select songs that fit well with the first single [...] "Battlefield" [...] since that was now also the name for the album. Later in May during an interview with Digital Spy, Sparks revealed {{that she has been}} involved in writing songs for the album, in total contributing to about 12 of approximately 30 recorded songs. She also revealed that although the album had at that time produced no duets she was hopeful to collaborate with Leona Lewis for a powerful ballad.

6000|$|... "Yes; I believe I {{might do}} that," [...] Ozma returned; [...] "but Woot is quite right; {{we are not}} {{justified}} in inflicting upon anyone--man or dog--the form of a green monkey.

I thank Jeff Naughton, Marv Solomon and Tehshik Yoon for serving on my thesis committee. They provided valuable advice and feedback. I thank Tehshik in particular for making it to my defense despite his illness that day so I could avoid delaying my graduation...|$|R
