25|$|On a cold {{morning of}} February 1827, John left {{his home and}} went {{to look for work}} as a farm-servant. At 12, he found life at home {{unbearable}} because of the continuous quarrels with Antonio. Having to face life by himself {{at such a young age}} may have developed his later sympathies to help abandoned boys. After begging unsuccessfully for work, Bosco ended up at the <b>wine</b> <b>farm</b> of Louis Moglia. Although Bosco could pursue some studies by himself, he was not able to attend school for two more years. In 1830 he met Joseph Cafasso, a young priest who identified some natural talent and supported his first schooling. In 1835 Bosco entered the seminary at Chieri, next to the Church of the Immacolata Concezione. In 1841, after six years of study, he was ordained priest on the eve of Trinity Sunday by Archbishop Franzoni of Turin.|$|E

He was forced to sell the <b>wine</b> <b>farm</b> in 2001 to pay for medical bills that his insurer refused to pay. Later he moved to North Wales, where he continued to coach locally at Marchwiel & Wrexham and also NE Wales Development squads. [...] He was also involved with disabled cricket in Wales. Though he was not (as often erroneously stated) a full-time wheelchair user, he could only walk very slowly, so {{it was easier to}} get from A to B in the wheelchair, and for the days when he coached he used an electric scooter which was provided for him by the PCA. [...] He died after a brain haemorrhage in Jersey on 30 December 2005, leaving his third wife a widow.|$|E

The paradigm of sustainability consists of three broad areas namely: financial, environmental and social sustainability. These three areas have to be present within the organisation for it to be sustainable. The results of the study indicate that the paradigm within which the farmers manage their farms are not aligned with the emerging paradigm.
