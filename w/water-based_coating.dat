40|$|Abstract: <b>Water-based</b> <b>coating</b> {{systems are}} {{becoming}} increasingly popular among consumers due to their simple application and {{a wide range of}} colours. A common mistake made by users of these coating systems is neglecting of diagnostics of the corrosive environment and failing to eliminate the factors that cause corrosion aggressiveness. On the boundary of two different environments there can be corrosion products developed and dust particles deposited, which may cause, under certain circumstances, development of deeply hidden corrosion, and thus reduce the level of protection of the substrate. In order to provide long-term protection of the substrate the coating system must be able to eliminate the corrosion agents effectively. In addition to the requirements for aesthetic value set by the consumers, also environmental aspects {{must be taken into account}} in the long-term protection of the substrate...|$|E
40|$|We have {{prepared}} an aqueous physical gel consisting of negatively charged silica nanoparticles bridged by ABA triblock copolymers, {{in which the}} A blocks are positively charged and the B block is neutral and water-soluble.

Adding nanoparticles to a conventional coating could improve its UV-protecting properties, thus decreasing {{the need for}} maintenance of coated wood products. Wood products could thereby replace non-wood alternatives, which could result in lower environmental impacts. This paper describes an environmental evaluation carried out within the WoodLife project, in which we test whether the nanoparticles are toxic for the bacteria Vibrio fischeri, and use Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to map the environmental consequences of applying the coating on a wood product. This goes {{beyond the scope of}} most environmental evaluations of nanotechnologies, which tend to include either an assessment of the possible toxicity of the nanomaterial or an LCA. The toxicological testing indicates low ecotoxicity of the nanoparticles, but further development of suitable testing methods is warranted to enable a full ecotoxicological evaluation. The LCA shows that a wooden window frame with the new coating can be environmentally superior to plastic and aluminium window frames. However, the potential in part depends on variables such as recycling rates and disposal practices, which are highly uncertain for future products with long service lives...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} the synthesis and characterization of iron oxide-based multi-compartment colloids combining the chemical and physical properties of inorganic nanoparticles with different polymers. All colloids are synthesized in solution by template-free bottom-up approaches. In the first part an insight into the intrigued world of hematite nanoparticles is given. During the synthesis in aqueous solution the morphology can be adjusted to range from spherical to spindle-type shapes. Analyses concerning chemical composition of different species as well as selected physical properties are performed. In the further chapters, these nanoparticles are used as templates {{for the formation of}} more complex structures. Next, the coating of spherical and ellipsoidal hematite colloids with silica using different coating methods is presented. The chapter opens with detailed investigations of standard silica coating procedures focusing especially on the role of adhesion promoters during the silica deposition in organic media. Subsequently, a silica coating process is presented where highly functional, water-soluble hyperbranched polyalkoxysiloxanes are used. In a surfactant-free <b>water-based</b> <b>coating</b> procedure, the resulting hematite core silica shell nanoparticles are decorated with reactive groups on the surface. Asymmetric multi-compartment lemon- and dumbbell-shaped colloids are the main topic of the following part. Some of the monomers used for the asymmetric polymer coating, are hydrophobic in nature, but also water-soluble, functional monomers, e. g. N vinylcaprolactam, are used making the polymer shell more hydrophilic, reactive and responsive. Furthermore, structures described are used to deposit silica selectively on the free edges of the ellipsoids to obtain dumbbells. Finally, different methods of encapsulation of magnetic nanoparticles into PVCL microgels are discussed. One approach describes the grafting of polymer from the spherical hematite nanoparticle surface resulting in core-shell nanocomposites. Loading of sub- 10 nm FePt colloids by a solvent exchange method into microgels is the other subject here. For both hybrid material responsiveness to external stimuli is observed...|$|E

40|$|The present work shows a way {{to develop}} an {{industrial}} organic solvent-free process for lithium-ion battery electrodes manufacturing. The process uses a water-based slurry to cast the electrodes, using poly vinylidene-fluoride (PVDF) as a polymeric binder. The use of aqueous PVDF latex as a binder in positive electrodes is of difficult integration in existing production lines due to the low stability of lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO 2) in an aqueous environment. The use of electroless plating solves this issue by coating LiCoO 2 particles with a copper-based layer stable to water. The presence of copper {{on the surface of}} the powders is confirmed by means of SEM, XRF and conductivity measurements of the powders.

30|$|In summary, four {{approaches}} are depicted in Fig.  2. Cases a and b comprise dry processes with reactive precursors and a physical energy impact. Cases c and d comprise wet processes and {{are based on}} adsorption at room temperature. These approaches may be compared {{with respect to their}} effectivity in delaying the onset of hydrogen bubble formation in water films that are in contact with magnesium alloy surfaces, as illustrated in Fig.  6. Concerning the approaches based on dry processes, layer systems with a thickness of between 0.1 and 1  µm have been presented. Closed, dense and smooth, and integrally applied SiOxCyHz-type plasma polymer layers deposited in low pressure plasma showed superior effectivity compared to reaction layers formed locally by laser treatment in air. Tuning the composition of the gas phase and further optimizing the parameters guiding the energy impact during the laser treatment will contribute to increasing the performance of these layers. In comparison with PECVD or high-energy laser [22] processes the application of liquid formulations by dipping or spraying facilitates a less elaborate or milder surface functionalization, resulting in thinner layers allowing for instance the modification of nanostructured substrates [33, 34]. Concerning the approaches based on wet processes, the investigated natural biopolymer mixtures containing laccase and maltodextrin, as well as the synthetic amphiphilic polymers optimized for the application on aluminum alloys [35], showed multi-metal effectivity evidenced by a fast adsorption on AM 50 surfaces, resulting in layers with a thickness between 0.001 and 0.01  µm. Using an aqueous G 50 wb formulation revealed superior performance in suppressing the formation of hydrogen bubbles for time ranges of up to 20  min. That is a time-scale comparable to that required for the drying and hardening of <b>water-based</b> primer, <b>coating</b> or adhesive systems.
