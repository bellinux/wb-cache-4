5|$|In 2008, Selena's {{brother and}} former {{principal}} record producer A.B. Quintanilla III, known as A.B., {{was planning to}} quit music and leave the Kumbia All-Starz, the successor of Kumbia Kings. Their father and manager, Abraham Quintanilla, Jr., told A.B. {{that he did not}} want him to quit music, saying that his dream <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> children would continue in the music industry and never give up. In 2009, after performing to an enthusiastic crowd in Bolivia, A.B. decided to continue recording music.|$|E
5|$|In his High Court appeal Dietrich was {{represented}} by David Grace, QC. The main argument advanced on Dietrich's behalf <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> trial was a miscarriage of justice, since {{he did not have}} legal representation. He argued that he should have been provided with counsel at public expense, given the seriousness of the crime with which he was charged. Alternatively, he argued that the judge should have stayed or adjourned the trial until he was able to obtain counsel himself. His argument was based on the common law tradition that an accused is entitled to a fair trial.|$|E
5|$|One reason {{senators}} {{were reluctant}} to remove the President <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> successor would have been Ohio Senator Wade, the president pro tempore of the Senate. Wade, a lame duck who left office in early 1869, was a Radical who supported such measures as women's suffrage, placing him beyond the pale politically {{in much of the}} nation. Additionally, a President Wade was seen as an obstacle to Grant's ambitions.|$|E

5|$|Alexios {{deployed}} his smaller army {{in waiting}} near Bryennios's camp, and divided {{it in two}} commands. The left, which confronted Bryennios's strongest division, was commanded by himself and contained the Frankish knights {{to the right and}} the Immortals to the Franks' left. The right command was under Constantine Katakalon, and comprised the Chomatenoi and the Turks. The latter, according to the Alexiad, were given the role of flank guard (plagiophylakes) and tasked with observing and countering the Pechenegs. Conversely, on the extreme left Alexios formed his own flanking detachment (apparently drawn from among the Immortals), concealed from enemy view inside a hollow. Given his inferiority, Alexios was forced to remain on the defensive. His only chance at success <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> out-flankers, concealed by the broken terrain, would surprise and create enough confusion among Bryennios's men for him and his strong left wing to break through their lines.|$|E
5|$|Caliph Walid quickly re-confirmed Qutayba as governor, {{and even}} made his {{province}} independent {{from the governor}} of Iraq, but Qutayba's position was not secure: the Arab army was tired of constant campaigning and was still riven by factional rivalries, while Qutayba himself had alienated the most powerful Arab tribal groups. He was generally popular among the native Iranians, but {{the leader of the}} native auxiliaries, Hayyan an-Nabati, had secretly turned against him. Qutayba was completely unaware of the situation however, and began preparations for the campaign of 715, during which he intended to finally capture the Ferghana Valley and complete the subjugation of the Jaxartes valley. His only concern <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> old rival, Yazid ibn al-Muhallab, might be restored to the Caliph's favour after al-Hajjaj's death, and he took few precautions except for removing his family and belongings from Merv to Shash and placing a guard on the Oxus.|$|E
5|$|His {{retreating}} army were continuously harried by the Spartans {{under the}} command of Areus. By setting ambushes and occupying important positions along the Epiriote line of retreat, the Spartans were able to inflicted significant casualties on Pyrrhus' rearguard of Gauls and Molossians. In an attempt to counter the panic and crumbling morale of his rear which was engaging the Spartans, Pyrrhus sent his son Ptolemy to take command. By doing this, Pyrrhus' hope <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> son's presence would rally the rearguard and give him enough time to extricate the rest of his army from the narrow pass through which they were marching. The battle intensified around Ptolemy's position and he was set upon by a picked Spartan band led by Evaclus. In the fight that ensued, Ptolemy was slain and his remaining troops being overwhelmed by the triumphant Spartans. Upon hearing of his son's death and the disintegration of his rearguard, Pyrrhus charged the Spartans with his Molossian cavalry, killing Evaclus with his own hand before destroying the remainder of his picked Spartan troops. With the defeat of Evaclus' force, Pyrrhus was able to withdraw the rest of his army from Laconia.|$|E

50|$|At this time, he {{unseated}} {{his brother}} and became head of the Sakakibara clan. There are two explanations for this.

5|$|Kemp was {{considered}} {{the star of the}} 1992 Republican National Convention. In 1992 and 1993, Kemp {{was considered}} the favorite or co-favorite for the 1996 Presidential nomination. At the time of the 1994 mid-term elections, Kemp was widely anticipated to announce his candidacy for 1996, and his supporters wanted a formal announcement {{by the end of the}} year. In January 1995, Kemp's stated reason for not entering the 1996 Republican Party presidential primaries <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> personal beliefs were out of balance with the contemporary Republican political landscape: Kemp opposed term limits, he always preferred tax cuts to anything resembling a balanced budget amendment and, unlike most Republicans, favored federal incentives to combat urban poverty. In 1995, Gloria Borger noted Kemp was not in step with the 1994 Contract with America. Kemp also noted a distaste for the vast fundraising necessary for a Presidential campaign. Gergen stated that by 1996 the selection process had become so expensive, mean and personally invasive that it discouraged several top Republicans from running. In 1995, while the world awaited the campaign decision announcement by Colin Powell, Kemp had positive thoughts on the prospect of such a campaign.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Japanese {{forces were}} taking over Java and {{threatening}} the Allied headquarters at Bandung. On 5 March, the Allied command decided that several senior RAF and RAAF officers {{had to be}} evacuated from Bandung. Winckel {{was chosen as the}} pilot. He protested the decision, arguing that his lack of rest would hinder his chances of finding Bandung in the dark as he did not have any electronic aids. However, Winckel was seen {{to be one of the}} most experienced pilots because of his terrain knowledge as a flight instructor at Bandung and his recent refugee flights. Another factor <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> Lodestar, although it had been damaged in the attack on Broome, was considered the most suitable plane for the evacuation mission. Winckel flew to Java, where he managed to land his plane on a road lit by jeep headlights. He picked up fourteen passengers, refuelled the plane and successfully returned to Australia.|$|E
25|$|Investigations of the gunfight {{concluded}} {{that while it}} was Courtright who went for his pistol first, it was Short who ultimately outdrew and killed him. Courtright's inability to fire off a shot was due {{to a number of}} possible reasons; one <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> pistol got caught on his watch chain for a second as he drew it, and another <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> pistol broke when one of Short's bullets struck it and his thumb.|$|E

25|$|While Patterson sought publicity, Gimlin was {{conspicuous}} by his absence. He {{only briefly}} helped {{to promote the}} film and avoided discussing his Bigfoot encounter publicly for many subsequent years; he turned down requests for interviews.

Another factor <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> wife objected to publicity.|$|E
25|$|The {{most serious}} cause of {{discomfort}} in England <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> time {{was no longer}} his own.

At last, ashamed of misappropriating Casaubon's stores of learning, they asked him to refute the popular Annals of Baronius.|$|E
25|$|In October 2000, {{while doing}} an interview, Kenneth held Court TV {{reporter}} Maria Zone hostage by pressing a ballpoint pen into her throat.

After four hours of negotiation, Kimes removed the pen from Zone's throat. Negotiators created a distraction which allowed them to quickly remove Zone and wrestle Kimes to the ground.|$|E

25|$|After his death, al-Kindi's {{philosophical}} works quickly {{fell into}} obscurity {{and many of}} them were lost even to later Islamic scholars and historians. Felix Klein-Franke suggests a number of reasons for this: aside from the militant orthodoxy of al-Mutawakkil, the Mongols also destroyed countless libraries during their invasion. However, he says the most probable cause of this <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> writings never found popularity amongst subsequent influential philosophers such as al-Farabi and Avicenna, who ultimately overshadowed him.|$|E
25|$|An {{account of}} Nathan Hale's capture {{was written by}} Consider Tiffany, a Connecticut shopkeeper and Loyalist, and {{obtained}} by the Library of Congress.

After luring Hale into betraying himself by {{pretending to be a}} patriot himself, Rogers and his Rangers apprehended Hale near Flushing Bay in Queens, New York. Another story <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> Loyalist cousin, Samuel Hale, was the one who revealed his true identity.|$|E
