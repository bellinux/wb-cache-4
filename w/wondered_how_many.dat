5|$|On {{the same}} day the Red Sox won Game 3, The Boston Globes Dan Shaughnessy wrote that, as this win brought the Red Sox on the verge of winning a World Series, he <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> people in New England were {{thinking}} about loved ones who had spent their entire lives rooting for the Red Sox and hoping that one day, they would see the Red Sox win a World Series.|$|E
500|$|On the 20th {{anniversary of}} the match, Thomas {{recalled}} the goal as [...] "...the one people talk about. I donâ€™t mind, though. It's still my best ever." [...] He disclosed that his teammates never thought Wrexham had a chance of progressing into the fourth round, rather [...] "we just <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> {{they were going to}} score." [...] Cited {{as one of the greatest}} upsets in Cup history, commentator John Motson described the Wrexham-Arsenal tie as a [...] "giant killing which has stood the test of time." [...] In 2013, the match came top in a list of greatest ever FA Cup upsets, as voted for by ESPN viewers. It received 48.01% of the vote, with Sutton defeating Coventry coming in second (40.25%).|$|E
2500|$|Sling Shot: A {{bungee cord}} ride {{in which two}} riders sat in a seat and were {{strapped}} in while the ride was shot {{up in the air}} and supported by a bungee cord. Riders looped upside down. There are a few similar rides still standing in a handful of major amusement parks, the most common name being the Slingshot found at many Six Flags parks, but they are upcharge attractions (an additional charge to admission) due to insurance issues. At Action Park, the extra fee was only $5. This particular ride was open from 1993 to 1995. [...] "We often <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> whiplash cases came out of that ride", one former employee recalled.|$|E
60|$|Another of your fool's errands, Allan my boy, I said to myself. I <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> {{more you}} {{are destined to}} survive.|$|R
6000|$|... "There are {{twelve hundred}} men, women, and {{children}} here," [...] said Captain Lynch. [...] "I <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> {{will be here}} tomorrow morning." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{will add}} {{no more to}} this lest you should want to {{communicate}} with the artist; try another sheet. I <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> I'll keep wandering to.|$|R
60|$|This was downright generous of Mr. Cooke. We have all, no doubt, drawn {{our line}} {{between what is}} right and what is wrong, but I have often <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> of us with the world's indorsement across our backs {{trespass}} as little {{on the other side of}} the line as he.|$|E
60|$|Then {{and there}} he {{delivered}} a remarkably neat little oration--pat, well put together, and clearly delivered. So it came to pass that the Queen's health was best honoured by an American. We English were dazed. I <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> Englishmen not trained to addressing their fellows would have spoken half so fluently as the gentleman from 'Frisco.|$|E
6000|$|Yes, it was coming. And yet, in {{the face}} of it, Robert Walmsley was eagerly {{regarding}} a certain branch of the apple tree upon which he used to climb out of that very window. He believed he could do it now. He <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> blossoms there were on the tree--ten millions? But here was some one speaking again: ...|$|E
60|$|I <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> authors it {{will take}} to enchant our country from Maine to New Orleans, as every foot of ground is enchanted here in Scotland.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> of my ideals {{will be left}} to me," [...] sighed Joan. [...] "I {{always used}} to regard the Press as the modern pulpit." ...|$|R
60|$|Morales {{said nothing}} for a moment, and Appleby surmised that he was <b>wondering</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> of his men had {{remained}} loyal. Then he made a little impatient gesture.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, so soon, oh Holly!" [...] she said. [...] "I <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> {{minutes it}} would need to bring thee to thy knees. I have not seen a man kneel before me for so many days, and, believe me, to a woman's heart the sight is sweet, ay, wisdom and length of days take not from that dear {{pleasure}} which is our sex's only right.|$|E
60|$|The Bisons were prancing {{about the}} diamond, and their swaggering {{assurance}} was {{not conducive to}} hope for the Worcesters. I <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> of that vast, noisy audience, intent on the day's sport, even had a thought of what pain and toil it meant to my players. The Buffalo men were in good shape; they had been lucky; {{they were at the}} top of their stride, and that made all the difference.|$|E
6000|$|And by {{this time}} they were {{come up to the}} great iron gates in front of the house; and Tom stared through them at the rhododendrons and azaleas, which were all in flower; and then at the house itself, and <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> {{chimneys}} there were in it, and how long ago it was built, and what was the man's name that built it, and whether he got much money for his job? ...|$|E
50|$|The Canadian Association of Journalists {{publicly}} {{questioned the}} credibility and {{independence of the}} Victoria News, <b>wondering</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> stories Black Press kills behind the scenes because of advertising concerns.|$|R
6000|$|I {{was reading}} the second chapter of Malachi this morning by chance, and <b>wondering</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> clergymen ever read it, and took to heart the [...] "commandment for them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah!' said she, rousing {{herself with}} some effort, 'I <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> trees I should have saved from the slaughter. Did {{you go and}} condemn any of my pets?' ...|$|R
60|$|He <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> of {{the lofty}} foreheads and smiling lips of this {{pictorial}} pedigree could be credited as true reflections of their prototypes. Some were wilfully false, no doubt; many more so by unavoidable accident and want of skill. Somerset {{felt that it}} required a profounder mind than his to disinter from the lumber of conventionality the lineaments that really sat in the painter's presence, and to discover their history behind the curtain of mere tradition.|$|E
60|$|Between incumbencies of Finn maids {{from the}} North Woods, Germans from the prairies, {{occasional}} Swedes and Norwegians and Icelanders, Carol did her own work--and endured Aunt Bessie's skittering in {{to tell her}} how to dampen a broom for fluffy dust, how to sugar doughnuts, how to stuff a goose. Carol was deft, and won shy praise from Kennicott, but as her shoulder blades began to sting, she <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> millions of women had lied to themselves during the death-rimmed years through which they had pretended to enjoy the puerile methods persisting in housework.|$|E
60|$|Winston {{afterwards}} <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> miles {{he walked}} that night, for though the loghouse was not longer than thirty feet, the cold bit deep; {{but at last}} he heard a sigh as he glanced towards the stove, and immediately swung round again. When he next turned, Miss Barrington stood upright, a little flushed in face but otherwise very calm, and the man stood still, shivering {{in spite of his}} efforts and blue with cold. The wind had fallen, but the sting of the frost that followed it made itself felt beside the stove.|$|E
6000|$|... 234. I {{was reading}} the second chapter of Malachi this morning by chance, and <b>wondering</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> clergymen ever read it, and took to heart the [...] "commandment for them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Give us the [...] "Ganges Pilot"; you sang that in {{the square}} the night before El-Maghrib. By the way, I <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> of the chorus are alive to-night,' said Dick.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now you've baptized it, Polly, and it's {{as good as}} silver; {{for your}} tear shines in there like a great big diamond. <b>Wonder</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> {{it would take to}} fill it?" ...|$|R
60|$|Here was Youth, {{clean and}} wholesome, unsullied--the thing of glory and wonder {{for men to}} conjure with..... {{after it has been}} lost to them and they have turned middle-aged. And so well did we conjure, that Romance came and for an hour led us far from the man-city and its snarling roar. Bardwell, in a way, started it by quoting from Thoreau; but it was old Trefethan, bald-headed and dewlapped, who took up the {{quotation}} and for the hour to come was romance incarnate. At first we <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> Scotches he had consumed since dinner, but very soon all that was forgotten.|$|E
60|$|Life is {{a mixture}} of emotions, a jumble of joy and sorrow and reverence and mirth and flippancy, of right feeling and heresy. In the morning William Wetherell had laughed at Mr. Hopkins and the twenty {{thousand}} dollars he had put in the bank to defraud the people; but now he could have wept over it, and as he looked down upon the three hundred members of that House, he <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> of them represented their neighbors who supposedly had sent them here--and how many Mr. Lovejoy's railroad, Mr. Worthington's railroad, or another man's railroad.|$|E
60|$|It {{was plain}} {{to see that}} the human folk of this inner world had not {{advanced}} far in learning, and the thought that the ugly Mahars had so outstripped them was a very pathetic one indeed. I <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> ages it would take to lift these people out of their ignorance even were it given to Perry and me to attempt it. Possibly we would be killed for our pains as were those men of the outer world who dared challenge the dense ignorance and superstitions of the earth's younger days. But it was worth the effort if the opportunity ever presented itself.|$|E
6000|$|... "Give us the 'Ganges Pilot'; you sang that in {{the square}} the night before El- Maghrib. By the way, I <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> of the chorus are alive tonight," [...] said Dick.|$|R
5000|$|In John Betjeman's poem [...] "Shattered Image" [...] (1970), {{an accused}} child molestor <b>wonders</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> of his Tuinal - used, presumably, as a {{recreational}} depressant - {{it will take}} to kill himself.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, so you did. It is {{the name}} of the embalmer, I take it. A very {{conscientious}} worker he must have been. I <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> modern works will survive four thousand years?" ...|$|R
60|$|He <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> outcasts {{like him}} lay under this star-studded, velvety sky across the fifteen hundred miles of wild country between El Paso and {{the mouth of}} the river. A vast wild territory--a refuge for outlaws! Somewhere he had heard or read that the Texas Rangers kept a book with names and records of outlaws--three {{thousand}} known outlaws. Yet these could scarcely be half of that unfortunate horde which had been recruited from all over the states. Duane had traveled from camp to camp, den to den, hiding-place to hiding-place, and he knew these men. Most of them were hopeless criminals; some were avengers; a few were wronged wanderers; and among them occasionally was a man, human in his way, honest as he could be, not yet lost to good.|$|E
6000|$|Margaret <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> {{thousands}} of girls had been similarly placed, and pitied them. She {{thought of the}} atmosphere in which she lived, where {{it seemed to her}} every mother was possessed singularly and entirely of one aim, to marry her daughter as soon as possible to a man as rich as possible. Marrying well simply meant marrying money. Only a few days before her mother had come to her and said: [...] "Mrs. Fisher called and she was telling me about her daughter Alice. It seems Alice is growing very pretty and very popular. She said she was afraid Alice had taken, a liking to that Brandeth fellow, who's only a clerk. So Mrs. Fisher intends taking Alice to the seashore this summer, to an exclusive resort, of course, but one where there will be excitement and plenty of young gentlemen." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was almost}} a relief to turn back to that other outlook and watch the village life that was now {{beginning}} to wake in earnest. The procession of water-fetchers had formed itself in a long chattering line that stretched river-wards. Comus <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> {{tens of thousands of}} times that procession had been formed since first the village came into existence. They had been doing it while he was playing in the cricket-fields at school, while he was spending Christmas holidays in Paris, while he was going his careless round of theatres, dances, suppers and card-parties, just as they were doing it now; they would be doing it when there was no one alive who remembered Comus Bassington. This thought recurred again and again with painful persistence, a morbid growth arising in part from his loneliness.|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{a strange}} little girl you are!" [...] he said. [...] "I suppose I shouldn't be mad about {{you if you}} weren't that way. Sometimes I <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> women I have married." ...|$|R
60|$|Alda held up {{her hands}} in <b>wonder.</b> <b>How</b> <b>many</b> quarrels might {{have been going on}} at that moment, if three of the family at least had not {{exercised}} the forbearance she so little understood.|$|R
60|$|Jack sighed a long, hopeless sigh, {{and went}} away to fill the water-pails; but he remembered the doctor's name, and began to <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> years {{it would take to}} earn a hundred dollars.|$|R
