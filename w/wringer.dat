500|$|With Lana's boyfriend gone by season two, {{the door}} opened for Clark, but Welling stated he {{understood}} why the producers continued to keep Clark and Lana apart, even after Whitney's departure: [...] "There's the clich√© that television shows with a main love interest fail once they get it together." [...] After briefly being together {{at the beginning of}} the fifth season, Clark's upbringing was not enough to help him cope with the loss of Lana to Lex toward the end of season five. Welling admits that Clark had learned to let Lana make her own choices and not stand in her way, but his problem with her relationship with Lex was that Lex is a dangerous individual and it put Lana's safety in jeopardy. Apart from that, Clark had learned to walk the lonely road of a hero. His inability to cope with Lana moving on with Lex was carried over to season six. This season was the time the writers put Clark through an emotional <b>wringer</b> when they had Lana accept Lex's marriage proposal. For writer Kelly Souders, this presented Clark's worst fear: the woman he loved was marrying his worst enemy.|$|E

2500|$|GLaDOS {{was written}} {{with the intent}} of making her more {{understandable}} and empathetic to players, making her villainy more tragic. Kim Swift, team leader of Portal, described her growth in the game as her becoming more and more human. The two-hour total playtime for Portal allowed the writers enough time to let players get to know GLaDOS. Wolpaw commented that while GLaDOS did yell and fire rockets at the player, she fulfilled his desire for a villain who has not been [...] "done to death". He described her as both supportive and funny, while also sad and scared. One of his intentions was for players to believe that they are [...] "putting her through the <b>wringer</b> emotionally". The game was designed to have a clear beginning, middle, and end. Wolpaw stated that with each new part, GLaDOS' personality changed. She begins as a supportive, yet also increasingly sinister character, where she delivers exposition about the general Aperture mindset. However, once the player-character escapes, she begins to speak in first-person singular rather than first-person plural. She shows desperation due to her lack of control at this point, adding that more emotion begins to creep through her voice. After destroying the morality core, she becomes unhinged, featuring an almost human voice. This voice, described as sultry by Wolpaw, was originally to be used for turrets, but it did not work out. Because they liked it so much, they chose to use it for GLaDOS. Valve described GLaDOS' actions in Portal 2 as attempting to build a relationship with the player-character, {{and the only way to}} accomplish this is by testing her.|$|E

And that's it. John Barleycorn makes his appeal to weakness and failure, to weariness and exhaustion. He is the easy way out. And he is lying all the time. He offers false strength to the body, false elevation to the spirit, making things seem what they are not and vastly fairer than what they are.|$|R

25|$|The {{flexibility}} of rubber is appealing in hoses, tires and rollers for devices ranging from domestic clothes <b>wringers</b> to printing presses; its elasticity makes it suitable for {{various kinds of}} shock absorbers and for specialized machinery mountings designed to reduce vibration. Its relative gas impermeability makes it useful {{in the manufacture of}} articles such as air hoses, balloons, balls and cushions. The resistance of rubber to water and to the action of most fluid chemicals has led to its use in rainwear, diving gear, and chemical and medicinal tubing, and as a lining for storage tanks, processing equipment and railroad tank cars. Because of their electrical resistance, soft rubber goods are used as insulation and for protective gloves, shoes and blankets; hard rubber is used for articles such as telephone housings, parts for radio sets, meters and other electrical instruments. The coefficient of friction of rubber, which is high on dry surfaces and low on wet surfaces, leads to its use for power-transmission belting and for water-lubricated bearings in deep-well pumps. Indian rubber balls or lacrosse balls are made of rubber.|$|R
5000|$|Rolled glass (sometimes called [...] "table glass") is {{produced}} by pouring molten glass onto a metal or graphite table and immediately rolling it into a sheet using a large metal cylinder, similar to rolling out a pie crust. The rolling {{can be done by}} hand or by machine. Glass can be [...] "double rolled", which means it is passed through two cylinders at once (similar to the clothes <b>wringers</b> on older washing machines) to yield glass of a specified thickness (typically about 1/8" [...] or 3 mm). Glass made this way is never fully transparent, but does not necessarily have much texture. It can be pushed and tugged while molten to create certain effects. For distinct textures the metal cylinder can be imprinted with a pattern that is pressed into the molten glass as it passes through the rollers. The glass is then annealed. Rolled glass was first commercially produced around the mid-1830s and is widely used today. It is often called cathedral glass, but {{this has nothing to do}} with medieval cathedrals, where the glass used was hand-blown.|$|R

Ever fresh Novelgarbage, as of old, fodders the Circulating Libraries. (Moniteur of these months, passim.) The 'Cesspool of Agio,' now in the time of Paper Money, works with a vivacity unexampled, unimagined; exhales from itself 'sudden fortunes,' like Alladin-Palaces: really a kind of miraculous Fata-Morganas, since you can live in them, for a time. Terror is as a sable ground, on which the most variegated of scenes paints itself. In startling transitions, in colours all intensated, the sublime, the ludicrous, the horrible succeed one another; or rather, in crowding tumult, accompany one another.|$|R
6000|$|It was a {{perfectly}} appointed, small steam laundry, wherein the most modern machinery did everything that was possible for machinery to do. Martin, after a few instructions, sorted the great heaps of soiled clothes, while Joe started the masher and made up fresh supplies of soft- soap, compounded of biting chemicals that compelled him to swathe his mouth and nostrils and eyes in bath-towels till he resembled a mummy. Finished the sorting, Martin lent a hand in wringing the clothes. This was done by dumping them into a spinning receptacle that went {{at a rate of}} a few thousand revolutions a minute, tearing the matter from the clothes by centrifugal force. Then Martin began to alternate between the dryer and the <b>wringer,</b> between times [...] "shaking out" [...] socks and stockings. By the afternoon, one feeding and one, stacking up, they were running socks and stockings through the mangle while the irons were heating. Then it was hot irons and underclothes till six o'clock, at which time Joe shook his head dubiously.|$|E
6000|$|Quite {{naturally}} {{he found}} himself at a mangle, feeding starched cuffs. But as he fed he noticed figures printed in the cuffs. It was {{a new way of}} marking linen, he thought, until, looking closer, he saw [...] "$3.85" [...] on one of the cuffs. Then it came to him that it was the grocer's bill, and that these were his bills flying around on the drum of the mangle. A crafty idea came to him. He would throw the bills on the floor and so escape paying them. No sooner thought than done, and he crumpled the cuffs spitefully as he flung them upon an unusually dirty floor. Ever the heap grew, and though each bill was duplicated a thousand times, he found only one for two dollars and a half, which was what he owed Maria. That meant that Maria would not press for payment, and he resolved generously that it would be the only one he would pay; so he began searching through the cast-out heap for hers. He sought it desperately, for ages, and was still searching when the manager of the hotel entered, the fat Dutchman. His face blazed with wrath, and he shouted in stentorian tones that echoed down the universe, [...] "I shall deduct the cost of those cuffs from your wages!" [...] The pile of cuffs grew into a mountain, and Martin knew that he was doomed to toil for a thousand years to pay for them. Well, {{there was nothing left to}} do but kill the manager and burn down the laundry. But the big Dutchman frustrated him, seizing him by the nape of the neck and dancing him up and down. He danced him over the ironing tables, the stove, and the mangles, and out into the wash- room and over the <b>wringer</b> and washer. Martin was danced until his teeth rattled and his head ached, and he marvelled that the Dutchman was so strong.|$|E
6000|$|These {{were the}} Professor's talking seasons: most {{commonly}} {{he spoke in}} mere monosyllables, or sat altogether silent and smoked; while the visitor had liberty either {{to say what he}} listed, receiving for answer an occasional grunt; or to look round for a space, and then take himself away. It was a strange apartment; full of books and tattered papers, and miscellaneous shreds of all conceivable substances, [...] "united in a common element of dust." [...] Books lay on tables, and below tables; here fluttered a sheet of manuscript, there a torn handkerchief, or nightcap hastily thrown aside; ink-bottles alternated with bread-crusts, coffee-pots, tobacco-boxes, Periodical Literature, and Blucher Boots. Old Lieschen (Lisekin, 'Liza), who was his bed-maker and stove-lighter, his washer and <b>wringer,</b> cook, errand-maid, and general lion's-provider, and for the rest a very orderly creature, had no sovereign authority in this last citadel of Teufelsdrockh; only some once in the month she half-forcibly made her way thither, with broom and duster, and (Teufelsdrockh hastily saving his manuscripts) effected a partial clearance, a jail-delivery of such lumber as was not Literary. These were her Erdbeben (earthquakes), which Teufelsdrockh dreaded worse than the pestilence; nevertheless, to such length he had been forced to comply. Glad would he have been to sit here philosophizing forever, or till the litter, by accumulation, drove him out of doors: but Lieschen was his right-arm, and spoon, and necessary of life, and would not be flatly gainsayed. We can still remember the ancient woman; so silent that some thought her dumb; deaf also you would often have supposed her; for Teufelsdrockh, and Teufelsdrockh only, would she serve or give heed to; and with him she seemed to communicate chiefly by signs; if it were not rather by some secret divination that she guessed all his wants, and supplied them. Assiduous old dame! she scoured, and sorted, and swept, in her kitchen, with the least possible violence to the ear; yet all was tight and right there: hot and black came the coffee ever at the due moment; and the speechless Lieschen herself looked out on you, from under her clean white coif with its lappets, through her clean withered face and wrinkles, with a look of helpful intelligence, almost of benevolence.|$|E

The clothing was washed in revolving machines, in filtered water with pure soap, and rinsed five times. The <b>wringers</b> were centrifugal. The thermostatic control heater kept {{the water at}} all times less than 180 degrees, while the water filtering tanks removed the elements harmful to linens and other materials. The room next to that in which these tanks were located {{on the second floor}} was the store room, which contained barrels of starch, automobile tires, paper boxes, and almost a ton of twine. There was a large dryer, made especially for bath towels, which dried them by a hot air process. The flat work was protected in the mangles by canvas belts and aprons. Men's shirts were mended and the cuffs turned if worn along the fold. Stockings were dried and shaped at the same time on metal forms. A stiff collar required more steps {{in the process of being}} laundried than any other article. Two tanks, each of 1400 gallons capacity, contained soap flakes with the appropriate amount of water. These 2800 gallons lasted only two days at the most. The rough-dry work was done in a different part of the building, and the accounting for this department were kept separately. One person was employed for placing new satin ribbon of different colors in ladies' garments, and tying blankets with ribbon bows.|$|R

40|$|Thumb {{through the}} pages of a DeLorme {{gazetteer}} of any Great Plains state. and you will find small black diamonds, each with its own place-name, scattered throughout the large-scale maps. For those who are familiar with the area, the existence of some of the diamonds, supposedly marking the location of a community, can be confusing since these markers do not represent contemporary towns. Additionally, when you travel country roads in rural areas of the Great Plains you will stumble upon markers that identify a nearby post office, which, also no longer exists. What do these diamonds on the map represent? How does the occasional countryside post-office sign relate? Some studies, such as that of Geary County, Kansas, often mention 2 ÃÜ 2 names on the map like Wreford, Olson, and Moss Springs, which developed from slight concentrations of farms to include a post office and school, [that] never grew further, 2 ÃÜ 2 l but fail to go into more detail describing what such 2 ÃÜ 2 concentrations 2 ÃÜ 2 of people were like. My goal is to reveal the past communities that the cartographic diamonds in a gazetteer represent.
