500|$|According to Reynolds, Whitman's first-person narrator {{describes}} himself as [...] "me powerless-O helpless soul of me" [...] and identifies with the hermit thrush a [...] "'shy and hidden bird' singing of death with a [...] "bleeding throat'". The hermit thrush {{is seen as an}} intentional alter ego for Whitman, and its song as the [...] "source of the poet's insight". Miller writes that [...] "The hermit thrush is an American bird, and Whitman made it his own in his Lincoln elegy. <b>We</b> <b>might</b> <b>even</b> take the 'dry grass singing' as an oblique allusion to Leaves of Grass".|$|E
2500|$|Johnson became {{president}} upon {{the assassination of}} President Kennedy on November 22, 1963, and the goodwill generated by the incident gave him tremendous popularity. He enjoyed strong support against the bitterly divided Republicans; polls in January 1964 showed him leading Republican challengers Barry Goldwater 75% to 20% and Nelson Rockefeller 74% to 17%. However, Wallace had received over 100,000 letters and telegrams of support, nearly half from non-southerners, following his 1963 Stand in the Schoolhouse Door in defiance of {{a court order to}} integrate the University of Alabama, and he subsequently became [...] "Tennyson's Mordred, exposing the dark side of Camelot". He began a national speaking tour with a well-received lecture at Harvard on November 7, 1963, bringing him additional notoriety as he flirted {{with the idea of a}} national campaign. Wallace's charm and candor won over many of his critics; during a question and answer session at Harvard, a black man asserted his intention to run for president, to which Wallace smiled and responded, [...] "Between you and me both, we might get rid of that crowd in Washington. <b>We</b> <b>might</b> <b>even</b> run on the same ticket." [...] Meanwhile, Johnson forbade discussion of politics in the White House and refused to comment on whether he would run in the 1964 election, instead pursuing the late Kennedy's legislative agenda (most notably the Civil Rights Act of 1964), managing the Vietnam War, and declaring his own [...] "War on Poverty".|$|E
60|$|Short and sad and terrible--ay, <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>even</b> say tremendous--was the Whitebear's wild career.|$|E
30|$|Lack of Channel Statistics: In practice, <b>we</b> <b>might</b> not <b>even</b> {{have the}} {{explicit}} {{knowledge of the}} channel statistics. The solution should be self-learning to the dynamic propagation environment.|$|R
60|$|But {{although}} {{it is by no}} means probable that any of us will ever catch a sea-horse, <b>we</b> <b>might</b> get <b>even</b> stranger fish upon our hooks. If we had a very large hook, a long and strong line, and a tempting bait, it is just possible, if we were to go to exactly the right spot, and had extraordinary good fortune, that <b>we</b> <b>might</b> catch such a beauty as this.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{have brought}} you such {{a set of}} prizes! Red rubrics, red margins; and for the apparatus, I have brought a globe with all the {{mountains}} in high relief;--yes, and an admirable physical atlas, {{and a box of}} instruments and models for applying mathematics to mechanics. <b>We</b> <b>might</b> give <b>evening</b> lectures, and interest the young farmers.' ...|$|R
60|$|L. No; but of {{infinite}} interest. <b>We</b> <b>might</b> <b>even</b> {{come to know}} something about the making of diamonds.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why {{not start}} at once?" [...] De Brensault suggested. [...] "There {{is nothing to}} be gained by waiting. <b>We</b> <b>might</b> <b>even</b> leave to-morrow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Holt, listen," [...] {{finally said}} Lane, with more earnestness. [...] "We're friends--all boys {{of the service}} are friends. <b>We</b> <b>might</b> <b>even</b> become great pards, if we had time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{not saying}} aught against our {{doing all that}} is possible," [...] was my hot retort; [...] "but it is beyond reason to suppose <b>we</b> <b>might</b> help him <b>even</b> in the {{slightest}} degree." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In {{the same}} way, sir. There came a time, poor little thing, when her eyes looked glazed-like, and try her as <b>we</b> <b>might,</b> morning or <b>evening,</b> {{it was all}} the same--she noticed nothing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yet after all," [...] I said, [...] "even if we don't {{find the}} sphere at once, {{there is a}} chance for us. <b>We</b> <b>might</b> hold out. <b>Even</b> through the night. <b>We</b> <b>might</b> go down there again and make a fight for it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{may as well}} give it up, Sam. It {{is growing}} dark {{and there is no}} telling where this search would lead us. <b>We</b> <b>might</b> <b>even</b> get lost in the woods." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>even</b> now do business. I am most {{anxious to}} be of use to you. How long do you think, doctor, that this gentleman will in all {{probability}} live?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'We {{hold our}} own here, your Majesty,' Saxon answered. 'Methinks had we {{something}} after {{the nature of}} palisados or stockados, after the Swedish fashion, <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>even</b> make it good against the horse.' ...|$|E
5000|$|He also {{commented on}} people who saw {{religious}} or spiritual connotations in 2001:It's simply not there, religion and spirituality. Sufficiently advanced beings could be capable of things <b>we</b> <b>might</b> not <b>even</b> {{be able to understand}} — though these things would all make perfect sense to an advanced civilization, I suspect that these people to whom you refer are simply calling what they don't understand in my film [...] "god".|$|R
60|$|Might {{they not}} still {{open the way}} of freedom? If we acted in time, <b>might</b> <b>we</b> not <b>even</b> yet escape before the general alarm was sounded? We could at least try.|$|R
60|$|Such an {{inquirer}} <b>we</b> <b>might</b> then {{refer to}} the testimonies of Gen. Leith and of Capt. Pasley for Biscay and Asturias; of Mr. Vaughan (as cited by Lord Castlereagh) for the whole East and South; of Lord Cochrane (himself a most gallant man, and giving his testimony under a trying comparison of the Spaniards with English Sailors) for Catalonia in particular; of Lord W. Bentinck for the central provinces; and, for all Spain, <b>we</b> <b>might</b> appeal <b>even</b> to the Spanish military reports--which, by the discrimination of their praises (sometimes giving severe rebukes to particular regiments, &c.), authenticate themselves.|$|R
6000|$|... "If all {{turns out}} well," [...] {{retorted}} Chauvelin with {{a show of}} contempt, [...] "and if you will write the exact letter which I shall dictate, <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>even</b> give you that guarantee." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'In that case, <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>even</b> expect seventy,' {{he put in}} with a gasp of anticipation. 'Though I {{approached}} Rothschild {{first with}} my scheme on purpose, so that Israel and Judah might once more unite in sharing the promises.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do not {{misunderstand}} me," [...] Sir James went on, {{speaking a}} little more kindly. [...] "The money, after all, in comparison with what it was destined to purchase, is nothing. <b>We</b> <b>might</b> <b>even</b> count it a fair risk if it was lost." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then, major, I {{was furious}} with myself that I {{had not been}} taken prisoner, too. I {{should have been more}} troubled still if Captain Lindsay had not said that, in the first place, Tartar would have been lost if I had not come back {{straight}} to fetch him; and that, in the second place, it was not likely you {{would have been able to}} keep me with you had I been a prisoner, and <b>we</b> <b>might</b> not <b>even</b> have been shut up in the same fortress.|$|R
5000|$|As in Verne's novel, {{the main}} {{character}} is Hector Servadac, however, instead of being stranded on the comet while serving in the French Algerian army, his father is a supporter of a doomsday cult and Servadac is stranded on a splinter of the shattered Earth when the planet is destroyed by a comet. Roberts described the central metaphor as [...] "the trope that the world might end and that <b>we</b> <b>might</b> not <b>even</b> be sure it has happened. We surely wouldn't be wholly oblivious (this {{is the end of}} the world we're talking about, after all!) But <b>we</b> <b>might</b> not be wholly certain, either. There would be a lengthy transition period during which we would become increasingly convinced that something substantial had changed in our lives." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{they would}} but lie closer <b>we</b> <b>might</b> find safety, <b>even</b> should the cog founder. You will bear me out with good Master Witherton of Southampton that I {{have done all}} that a shipman might. It would be well that you should doff camail and greaves, Sir Nigel, for, by the black rood! it is like enough that we shall have to swim for it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, we don't {{care how}} small she {{is if we}} can only go in her; and you {{would be able to}} show us London, and <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>even</b> see the queen. Oh, do come up with us and ask father, Master Lirriper." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, but {{curtains}} inspire confidence," [...] Miss Allan decided. [...] "When {{the ball}} {{is in full swing}} it will be time to draw them. <b>We</b> <b>might</b> <b>even</b> open the windows a little. [...] . If we do it now elderly people will imagine there are draughts." ...|$|E
60|$|When, however, Pierre thus {{reminded}} me that <b>we</b> <b>might,</b> <b>even</b> at this eleventh hour, do something toward showing ourselves worthy of being called Minute Boys, although we really accomplished nothing more, then was I fired with the same desire that was in his mind.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Now, what's this? I {{am sorry}} to see anybody going the moment I've come,' expostulated the sergeant-major. 'I thought <b>we</b> <b>might</b> make an <b>evening</b> of it. There's a nine gallon cask o' [...] "Phoenix" [...] beer outside in the trap, and a ham, and half a rawmil' cheese; for I {{thought you might be}} short o' forage in a lonely place like this; and it struck me <b>we</b> <b>might</b> like to ask in a {{neighbour}} or two. But perhaps it would be taking a liberty?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nigel!" [...] cried Sir Simon Burley, hurrying up with consternation {{upon his}} face, [...] "Aylward {{tells me that}} there are not ten-score arrows left in all their sheaves. See! they are {{springing}} from their horses, and cutting their sollerets that they may rush upon us. <b>Might</b> <b>we</b> not <b>even</b> now make a retreat?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{seems to}} me that it would be far better to hold Jerusalem, only, with a strong force of {{fighting}} men; and for all the rest of the men capable of carrying arms to gather among the hills, and there to fight the Romans. When the legion of Cestius was destroyed we showed that, among defiles and on rocky ground, our active, lightly-armed men were a match for the Roman soldiers, in their heavy armor; and in this way I think that <b>we</b> <b>might</b> check <b>even</b> the legions of Vespasian. The women and the old men and children could gather in the cities, and admit the Romans when they approached. In that case they would suffer no harm; for the Romans are clement, when not opposed.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then please {{disappoint}} him," [...] he pleaded. [...] "I do {{not like}} your friend Mr. Bomford. He is an egotistical and ignorant person. We will go across the moors, we will climb our little hill. Perhaps <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>even</b> wait there until the sunset." ...|$|E
60|$|The fearful energy {{with which}} Maso uttered this solemn appeal, {{and a certain}} sincerity that marked his manner, and perhaps <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>even</b> say his character, {{in spite of the}} dissolute {{recklessness}} of his principles, served greatly to weaken the growing opinion in favor of his competitor.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is not necessary," [...] his {{companion}} answered. [...] "I {{have been to}} Somerset House. I have seen the will. One hundred thousand pounds she has, in her own right, unalienable. For the rest, let her guardian do what he will with it. With a hundred thousand pounds you can rest for a while. <b>We</b> <b>might</b> <b>even</b> give up----" ...|$|E
60|$|In the meantime, {{negotiations}} {{had been}} going on with Siam, between which state and Burma there was the bitterest enmity. It had been thought that Siam would have willingly grasped the opportunity to revenge itself for the many losses of territory that it had suffered at the hands of Burma. This there was no doubt {{that it would have been}} glad to do, but our occupation of several points on the coast of Tenasserim roused the fears of Siam, and inclined it to the belief that <b>we</b> <b>might</b> prove an <b>even</b> more dangerous neighbour than Burma.|$|R
5000|$|It was {{produced}} by Steve Mac, who says, [...] "Now Susan’s used to the studio and the recording process, this time round <b>we</b> <b>might</b> go <b>even</b> further down a traditional route of recording by getting a band together and rehearsing songs before {{we go into the}} studio to see what works, how she reacts with certain parts, and so we can change the arrangements that way. I think that’s going to work much better... With Susan it's very important she connects with the public and the public connect with her. She doesn’t want to sing anything that hasn’t happened to her or she can't relate to."Boyle included some Jazz numbers now she's [...] "a bit more content" [...] within herself. [...] "My next album has to have an element of surprise in it again. I'm hoping to make it better and a bit extra special." ...|$|R
