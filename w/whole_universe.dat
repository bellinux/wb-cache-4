5|$|In the episode, {{the mysterious}} {{character}} River Song (Alex Kingston) summons alien time traveller the Doctor (Matt Smith) and his companion Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) to Roman Britain in 102 AD, where underneath Stonehenge lies a fabled prison called the Pandorica that legend tells holds the most fearsome {{being in the}} <b>whole</b> <b>universe.</b> However, it is discovered that the Doctor has been put in a trap by an alliance of his greatest enemies to save the universe from cracks in time that were caused by the Doctor's space-time vessel the TARDIS. Amy's fiancé, Rory (Arthur Darvill), who had previously been erased from existence {{from one of the}} cracks in the universe, makes a return, though he is revealed to be an Auton duplicate outfitted with his consciousness.|$|E
5|$|The Chronologia {{developed}} into an even wider project, the Cosmographia, {{a description of}} the <b>whole</b> <b>Universe.</b> Mercator's outline was (1) the creation of the world; (2) the description of the heavens (astronomy and astrology); (3) the description of the earth comprising modern geography, the geography of Ptolemy and the geography of the ancients; (4) genealogy and history of the states; and (5) chronology. Of these the chronology had already been accomplished, the account of the creation and the modern maps would appear in the atlas of 1595, his edition of Ptolemy appeared in 1578 but the ancient geography and the description of the heavens never appeared.|$|E
25|$|Dunnington further elaborates on Gauss's {{religious}} views by writing: Gauss' religious consciousness {{was based on}} an insatiable thirst for truth and a deep feeling of justice extending to intellectual as well as material goods.

25|$|In December 1981, Guth read a {{paper from}} Moscow {{physicist}} Andrei Linde {{saying that the}} <b>whole</b> <b>universe</b> is within just one bubble, so nothing is destroyed by wall collisions. This conclusion was made using a Higgs field with an energy graph that was originally proposed by Sidney Coleman and Erick Weinberg. Guth discussed this with Linde, who had independently been working on bubble inflation, but without considering the flatness problem. Linde and Guth eventually exchanged papers on the subject.|$|E
25|$|Thomas Breuer in 1994 {{had proven}} that {{physical}} theories valid for the <b>whole</b> <b>universe</b> are impossible. Any theory will be wrong {{when applied to}} a system which contains the observer himself due to self-reference. This proves that the observer's own body does not follow the same physical laws {{as the rest of}} the universe. But other people from the observer's point of view will obey the usual physical laws, so conducting experiments on them would not indicate any divergence from the physical predictions.|$|E
25|$|Such a test as {{described}} by R. Plaga would mean that energy transfer is possible between parallel worlds. This does not violate the fundamental principles of physics because these require energy conservation only for the <b>whole</b> <b>universe</b> {{and not for the}} single parallel branches. Neither the excitation of the single ion (which is a degree of freedom of the proposed system) leads to decoherence, something which is proven by Welcher Weg detectors which can excite atoms without momentum transfer (which causes the loss of coherence).|$|E

25|$|Astrology (the {{operation}} of the stars): Hermes claims that Zoroaster discovered {{this part of the}} wisdom of the <b>whole</b> <b>universe,</b> astrology, and taught it to man. In Hermetic thought, {{it is likely that the}} movements of the planets have meaning beyond the laws of physics and actually hold metaphorical value as symbols in the mind of The All, or God. Astrology has influences upon the Earth, but does not dictate our actions, and wisdom is gained when we know what these influences are and how to deal with them.|$|E
25|$|In the {{original}} relative state formulation, Everett proposed {{that there is}} one universal wavefunction that describes the objective reality of the <b>whole</b> <b>universe.</b> He stated that when multiple subsystems interact, the total system becomes a superposition of these subsystems. This includes observers and measurement systems, which become part of one universal state (the wavefunction) that is always described via the Schrödinger Equation (or its relativistic alternative). That is, they become entangled such that one cannot define one without the other. Thus, each subsystems state can only be described relative to each subsystem with which it interacts (hence the name relative state).|$|E

Melkor, {{who was then the}} most powerful of the Ainur, broke the harmony of the music, until Ilúvatar began first a second theme, and then a third theme, which the Ainur could not comprehend since they were not the source of it.

500|$|Critics saw an [...] "undeniably" [...] Hindu {{connection}} between the film's story and the Vedic teaching of reverence for the <b>whole</b> <b>universe,</b> {{as well as the}} yogic practice of inhabiting a distant body by one’s consciousness and compared the film's love scene to tantric practices. [...] Another linked the Na'vi earth goddess Eywa to the concept of Brahman as the ground of being described in Vedanta and Upanishads and likened the Na'vi ability to connect to Eywa with the realization of Atman. [...] One commentator noted the parallel between the Na'vi greeting [...] "I see you" [...] and the ancient Hindu greeting [...] "Namaste", which signifies perceiving and adoring the divinity within others. [...] Others commented on Avatars adaptation of the Hindu teaching of reincarnation,—a concept, which another author felt was more accurately applicable to ordinary human beings that are [...] "a step or two away from exotic animals" [...] than to deities.|$|E
500|$|Chrysippus {{taught that}} ethics {{depended}} on physics. In his Physical Theses, he stated: [...] "for {{there is no}} other or more appropriate way of approaching the subject of good and evil on the virtues or happiness than from the nature of all things and the administration of the universe." [...] The goal of life, said Chrysippus, is to live in accordance with one's experience of the actual course of nature. A person's individual nature is part {{of the nature of the}} <b>whole</b> <b>universe,</b> and thus life should be lived in accordance with one's own human nature as well as that of the universe. Human nature is ethical, and humanity is akin to the Divine, emanating from the primal fire or aether, which, though material, is the embodiment of reason; and people should conduct themselves accordingly. People have freedom, and this freedom consists in emancipation from irrational desires (lust, riches, position in life, domination, etc.) and in subjecting the will to reason. Chrysippus laid the greatest stress on the worth and dignity of the individual, and on the power of will.|$|E

500|$|Used in {{the opening}} sequence, [...] "Die Another Day" [...] was played 13minutes into the film, where Bond is shown imprisoned and being {{tortured}} {{for over a year}} in a prison camp in Korea. Being a departure from the normal title sequence of the previous Bond films, Madonna faced difficulty in making the song blend with the theme of Die Another Day. Nevertheless, she understood the idea behind the opening scenes and tweaked the song accordingly. Some of the lyrics like [...] "I'm gonna destroy my ego ... Sigmund Freud ... Analyze this" [...] were derived from Madonna's interpretation of the film's storyline. She told an interviewer from Genre magazine that the lyrics were about [...] "destroying your ego, and it's juxtaposing the metaphor of, you know, the fight against good and bad, and it's set inside the <b>whole</b> <b>universe</b> of Bond". [...] "Die Another Day" [...] was never adapted into the main score of the film. The song was later added to the track list of American Life and was also featured on her third greatest hits album, Celebration (2009).|$|E
