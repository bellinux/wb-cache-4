The 1992 album Electric Tepee combined hard rock and light ambient pieces, while It is the Business of the Future to be Dangerous is almost devoid of the rock leanings. The Business Trip is {{a record of the}} previous album's tour, but rockier as would be expected from a live outing. The <b>White</b> <b>Zone</b> album was released under the alias Psychedelic Warriors to distance itself entirely from the rock expectancy of Hawkwind.|$|E
25|$|Amphidromus perversus perversus f. aureus Martyn, 1784 — It {{still have}} not been {{reported}} from a precise locality. It was based on three shells collected by Sir Joseph Banks, supposedly on Pulau Panaitan. The only Amphidromus found there, Amphidromus banksi Butot, is quite different and the actual locahty of aureus is still unknown. The shells have a wide, <b>white</b> <b>zone</b> below the suture as in the Amphidromus atricallosus complex and the lower parts of the whorls are yellow, with or without narrow, wavy, reddish-brown flammulations. The original specimens in the Natural History Museum {{appear to be a}} form of Amphidromus perversus, but the locality remains a mystery. Note: Martyn's work was invalidated by action of the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature, varietal names are not accorded legal status and the use of aureus is as a convenient term of reference.|$|E

Walking along a stream (the Conchitas, near Buenos Ayres), I noticed a broad white line skirting the low wet ground. This I found {{was caused by}} gossamer web lying in such quantities over the earth as almost to hide the grass ad thistles under it. The <b>white</b> <b>zone</b> was about twenty yards wide, and outside it only a few scattered webs were visible on the grass; its exact length I did not ascertain, but followed it for about two miles without finding the end. The spiders were so numerous that they continually baulked one another {{in their efforts to}} rise in the air. As soon as one threw out its lines they would become entangled with those of another spider, lanced out at the same moment; both spiders would immediately seem to know the cause of the trouble, for as soon as their lines fouled they would rush angrily towards each other, each trying to drive the other from the elevation. Notwithstanding these difficulties, numbers were continually floating off on the breeze which blew from the south.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} achieve a surface {{pretreatment}} of the bearing steel 100 Cr 6 (1 – 1. 5 wt. – % Cr) a laser-based process was used. The obtained modification may result in an optimization of the adhesive properties of the surface with respect to an anticorrosion polymer coating {{on the basis of}} PEEK (poly-ether-ether-ketone), which is applied on the steel surface by a laser melting technique. This work deals with the influence of the laser-based pretreatment regarding the surface microstructure and the micro-hardness of the steel, which has been examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), light microscopy and automated micro-hardness testing. The most suitable parameter set for the laser-based pretreatment leads to the formation of very hard <b>white</b> etching <b>zones</b> (WEZ) with a thickness of 23 μm, whereas this pretreatment also induces topographical changes. The occurrence of the <b>white</b> etching <b>zones</b> is attributed to near-surface re-austenitization and rapid quenching. Moreover, dark etching zones (DEZ) with a thickness of 32 μm are found at the laser path edges as well as underneath the <b>white</b> etching <b>zones</b> (WEZ). In these areas, the hardness is decreased due to the formation of oxides as a consequence of re-tempering...|$|R
