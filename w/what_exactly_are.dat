As Pierre Schaeffer writes in his Treatise on Musical Objects [...] "The concealment of the causes does not result from a technical imperfection, nor is it an occasional process of variation: it becomes a precondition, a deliberate placing-in-condition of the subject. It is toward it, then, that the question turns around; [...] "what am I hearing?... <b>What</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>are</b> you hearing" [...] -in the sense that one asks the subject to describe not the external references of the sound it perceives but the perception itself." ...|$|E
50|$|At a coral reef, {{creatures are}} minding their own {{business}} Beyond the reef a cuttlefish is eating crabs. After that, garden eels and razorfish act really smooth. After that, spider crabs start war. Meanwhile, humpback whales, blue whales, sunfish, blue sharks, sperm whales and whale sharks migrate. Then a bunch of spinner dolphins, yellowfin tuna, and manta rays swim for a long time. Far away, an Asian sheepshead wrasse is mating. Miles away, a sea otter is smashing clams. In Alaska, the humpback whales {{have made it to}} the feeding grounds. The scene cuts to netted sea animals including tuna, whale sharks, sailfish, sea turtles, and sunfish. Along the way the fishing boat has a hard time fighting the waves. Then a satellite shows the trash in the ocean. Underwater tons of trash is destroying a fur seal's home. The scene cuts to the 2 polar regions Arctic and Antarctica. Then divers are discovering the ocean, and one of them swims with a great white shark! At the end the narrator says we shouldn't ask what exactly is the ocean, we should ask <b>what</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>are</b> we.|$|E

40|$|Indeed, methodological {{pluralism}} is {{a cornerstone}} of the field. Thumbing through a typical issue of a personality journal will reveal a rich array of methods, including longitudinal and experimental designs; studies of typical and atypical populations; and {{a wide range of}} assessment procedures, including self-report scales, informant reports, projective tests, observational assessment, and DNA analyses. This methodological diversity reflects, and is in fact compelled by, the breadth and complexity of the substantive questions personality researchers seek to address. It is not surprising that a field that aims to understand everything from genetic to cultural influences on the person involves a wide range of methods. But <b>what</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>are</b> the most common methods in contemporary personality research? That is, {{what is the best way}} to characterize the personality approach to psychology? Despite lively discussions at conferences and in the halls of psychology departments about which methods are rising or falling in popularity, there have been virtually no systematic studies of this issue. 1 This raises the question: Does the reality match the stereotype? Do personality researchers actually use a diverse range of methods? <b>What</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>are</b> the research designs, assessment methods, and statistics in the methodological toolkit of the 21 st century personalit...|$|E

Today, gyro is the name given generically to any instrument that measures inertial angular rotation [e. g., MEMS (micro-machined electro-mechanical systems) gyros that measure angular rate based on the inertial properties of a vibrating mass, and optical gyros that measure angular rate based on the inertial properties of light].

The {{increased}} {{availability and}} robustness of sensors, the wide-spread {{use of the}} internet as a communication envi-ronment and the intensified adoption of semantic technologies foster the vision of embedding intelligence in physical objects. The race of realizing this vision is pervasive to a variety of research fields, most notably ambient intelligence and semantic web, and leads to the proliferation of several overlapping definitions and terminologies: smart products, semantic devices, semantic gadgets- to which we collectively refer to as smart objects. <b>What</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>are</b> smart objects?
