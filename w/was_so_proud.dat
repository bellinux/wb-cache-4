25|$|Randy Savage {{had been}} a heel since his WWF debut {{in the summer of}} 1985. He turned babyface in late 1987, after WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion The Honky Tonk Man claimed to be the {{greatest}} Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion. This led to a feud between Savage and Honky, leading to Savage's face turn. On October 3, 1987 edition of Saturday Night's Main Event, Savage challenged Honky for the title winning by disqualification. The title remained with Honky because a title cannot change hands by a DQ. Harley Race had won the 1986 King of the Ring tournament and <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>proud</b> about this that he called himself King Harley Race and wore a crown and cape to the ring. Jim Duggan did not agree with the fact and this placed Duggan and Race into a feud, with Duggan winning most of the matches. Jake Roberts also feuded with Honky Tonk Man after Honky hit a guitar on Roberts on an edition of Snake Pit, completing Roberts' babyface turn. A match was booked for Survivor Series featuring Savage, Roberts, Ricky Steamboat (whom Honky Tonk had defeated to win the Intercontinental Heavyweight Title), Brutus Beefcake and Duggan against Honky, Hercules, Danny Davis, Ron Bass and Race.|$|E

When I broke into the game, he was crawling {{on his hands and}} knees. Unless he's as old as I am. He probably is." ...|$|E

500|$|Ford played center, linebacker, {{and long}} snapper for the school's {{football}} team, {{and helped the}} Wolverines in two undefeated seasons and national titles in 1932 and 1933. The team suffered a steep decline in his 1934 senior year, however, winning only one game. Ford was the team's star nonetheless. After a game during which Michigan held heavily favored Minnesota (the eventual national champion) to a scoreless tie in the first half, assistant coach Bennie Oosterbaan later said, [...] "When I walked into the dressing room at halftime, I had {{tears in my eyes}} I <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>proud</b> of them. Ford and [...] Sweet played their hearts out. They were everywhere on defense." [...] Ford later recalled, [...] "During 25 years in the rough-and-tumble world of politics, I often thought of the experiences before, during, and after that game in 1934. Remembering them has helped me many times to face a tough situation, take action, and make every effort possible despite adverse odds." [...] His teammates later voted Ford their most valuable player, with one assistant coach noting, [...] "They felt Jerry was one guy who would stay and fight in a losing cause." ...|$|E
500|$|Hutchinson {{described}} Steiger's {{mother as}} [...] "plump, energetic and small, with long auburn hair". She {{had a good}} singing voice and nearly became a Hollywood actress, but after a leg surgery permanently impaired her walking ability, she gave up acting and turned to alcohol. As a result, she quit show business and moved away from Westhampton to raise her son. They moved through several towns, including Irvington and Bloomfield, before settling in Newark, New Jersey. Her alcoholism caused Steiger much embarrassment, and the family was frequently mocked by other {{children and their parents}} within the community. At the age of five he was sexually abused by a pedophile who lured him in with a butterfly collection. Steiger said of his troubled family background: [...] "If you had the choice of having the childhood you experienced, with your alcoholic mother and being the famous actor you are today, or having a loving, secure childhood and not being famous, which would you take? A loving, secure childhood in a New York minute". During the last 11 years of her life, Steiger's mother stayed sober and regularly attended Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. Steiger recalled: [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>proud</b> of her. She turned herself around. She came alive again".|$|E
500|$|It {{would be}} January 1997 until the band {{would be able}} to wrap up {{sessions}} for Dude Ranch, eventually amounting to five weeks of recording. For the final touches, Unwritten Law frontman Scott Russo donated a few vocal tracks to [...] "Josie", and Trombino let Blink-182 record a couple of jokes between songs using his sound-effects machine. The group contacted Fletcher Dragge of Pennywise to find someone to remix a few tracks from the album, and he suggested Donnell Cameron of Track Recording Studios. The band went in to Track and re-recorded Raynor's drum tracks for several songs. Hoppus recalled [...] "I remember when we finished Dude Ranch I <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>proud.</b> That {{was the first time we}} could take the time and whatever to make a good record." [...] Representatives from MCA dropped by on occasion and were excited by the material they heard. [...] "When we were in there mixing, the A person would come by," [...] remembered Cameron. [...] "I don't think the band really knew what they had but certainly the label knew they had so many good songs on the record." [...] DeLonge remembered it differently: [...] " [...] fucking hated pop-punk. They wanted nothing to do with it. They were into Pavement or whatever." [...] After production completed, the album was mastered by Brian Gardner at Bernie Grundman Mastering in Hollywood.|$|E

2500|$|Born in England {{and raised}} in Ireland, Lynott always {{considered}} himself to be Irish.

Rose Reyes, who worked with Fender in 2004 for a Texas Folklife and Austin tribute titled [...] "Fifty Years of Freddy Fender", said of the album, [...] "When he did Mexican standards at that point in his career, I expected it to be good because he's a perfectionist. But that record is so beautifully recorded; his voice is perfection. I <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>proud</b> it was coming back to his roots." ...|$|E

Over time, it grew up into Bono, explaining why Bono can help {{so many people}} through his humanitarian work while still seeming [...] "like such a piece of shit." [...] Bono's father says that even though Bono faked his newest record, Bono himself is over 80 courics in weight, and thus is still bigger than Randy's old record or any other feces in the world. At that moment, Randy finally produces a bowel movement so large it lifts him several feet off the toilet seat and is estimated to weigh more than 100 courics. Randy is hailed as the new record holder, as an institute member pulls the [...] "advertisement" [...] Emmy image off the screen and presents it to Randy by lodging it in his feces.|$|E
2500|$|Flyer was {{designed}} to be the fastest propeller-driven vessel in the Pacific Northwest, and was very fine-lined, that is, tall and narrow. [...] Captain Scott <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>proud</b> of his new ship that he rode on her as she was launched into the Willamette River. This proved to be a mistake. [...] Neither boilers nor engines had been installed in Flyer before launch, and without their weight deep in her hull to act as ballast, she simply flopped over in the water, and Captain Scott had to exit by climbing out a window. After that, another hull was built around her with the hope of making her a little less top–heavy, but this was imperfectly sealed, so water sloshed around in between the hulls {{for the rest of the}} vessel's operational life. Surprisingly, this did not affect the Flyers speed, although she did acquire a permanent list to port, or at least the hint of a list. Once finally completed, the company sent Flyer to Puget Sound and brought Bailey Gatzert around to the Columbia River to run with the Telephone.|$|E

2500|$|Teimuraz I’s {{literary}} works addresses {{a wide range}} of topics and includes his original poems as well as translations and adaptations from Persian. This king-poet had such a universal knowledge of Persian and Georgian literature and <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>proud</b> of his innovations into the Georgian poetry, that, in his old age, Teimuraz proclaimed himself the greatest poet of Georgia and thought himself superior to the celebrated medieval Georgian author Shota Rustaveli. Although no such claim has ever been accepted by the critics of Georgian literature, {{there can be no doubt}} that his courtly and rather mannered lyricism had a certain influence on the 17th-19th-century Georgian poetry. Educated at the Safavid court, he was proficiently fluent in Persian, and his poetic language was full of Persian imagery and allusions, loanwords, and phraseology. Commenting on his interest in Persian poetry, he wrote: [...] "The sweetness of Persian speech urged me to compose the music of verse." [...] During his first creative period, 1629–34, when he was relatively secure on his throne, Teimuraz translated and adapted from Persian the romances of Layla and Majnun (Georgian: ლეილმაჯნუნიანი, Leilmajnuniani), Yusuf and Zulaikha (იოსებზილიხანიანი, Iosebzilikhaniani), The Rose and the Nightingale (ვარდბულბულიანი, Vardbulbuliani), and The Candle and the Moth (შამიფარვანიანი, Shamiparvaniani).|$|E
