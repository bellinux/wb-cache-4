500|$|Arsenal captain Patrick Vieira {{revealed}} {{his intention to}} stay at the club, despite interest from Chelsea, who had been acquired by Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich in the summer. Manager Arsène Wenger used his press conference to look ahead to the new season and felt his team's chances were as good, if not better than Chelsea's: [...] "I can understand that we look a little bit poor and out of shape but what is important is what happens on the pitch and you will see that we look good. To <b>write</b> <b>us</b> off just because we haven't spent £100million is a bit easy." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{family was}} arrested during the Russian Revolution of 1917 and imprisoned first at Tsarskoye Selo and later at private residences in Tobolsk and Yekaterinburg, Siberia. The drastic change in {{circumstances}} and the uncertainty of captivity took its toll on Tatiana {{as well as on}} the rest of her family. [...] "She pines without work," [...] wrote her fellow nurse Valentina Chebotareva after receiving a letter from Tatiana on 16 April 1917. [...] "It is strange to sit in the morning at home, to be in good health and not to go to the change of bandages!" [...] Tatiana wrote Chebotareva. Tatiana, apparently trying to advocate for her mother, asked her friend Margarita Khitrovo in a letter on 8 May 1917 why their fellow nurses did not write to Tsarina Alexandra directly. Chebotareva wrote in her journal that, while she pitied the family, she could not write directly to the Tsarina because she blamed her for the Revolution. [...] "If anyone wishes to <b>write</b> <b>us,</b> let them write directly," [...] Tatiana wrote to [...] "my dear dove" [...] Chebotareva on 9 December 1917, after expressing concern for fellow nurses and a patient they had once treated together. Chebotareva's son, Gregory P. Tschebotarioff, noted the grand duchess's [...] "firm, energetic handwriting" [...] and how the letter [...] "reflected the nature which endeared her so much to my mother." ...|$|E
2500|$|During the Ten Days of Repentance between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, {{additional}} {{lines are}} {{inserted in the}} first, second, second to last, and last blessings of all Amidot. These lines invoke God's mercy and pray for inscription in the Book of Life. In many communities, when the chazzan reaches these lines during his repetition, he pauses and the congregation recites the lines before him. During the final recitation of the Amidah on Yom Kippur the prayer is slightly modified to read [...] "seal us" [...] {{in the book of}} life, rather than <b>write</b> <b>us.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Throughout {{the early}} years of SEIU 775 and into the 2006 state elections, Rolf gained {{attention}} for threatening to take on established Democrats and endorsing Republicans, at one point saying: [...] "For too long the labor movement has been considered the lap dog of one party rather than the watchdog for both parties. The time has passed where we can allow one party to <b>write</b> <b>us</b> off and the other to take us for granted." [...] Furthermore, he told The Seattle Times in 2006: [...] "Our members do not care about Democrat vs. Republican. It's not the union's role to be a subsidiary of either the Democratic Party or the Republican Party." ...|$|E

Javvers, who even for a collector, is a miraculously ignorant man, read these paragraphs, and swore he would have the thing at any price. Raided the dealers with enquiries.

6000|$|MY DEAR LADY TAYLOR,--Our new home, the Equator, trading schooner, rides at the buoy to-night, {{and we are}} for sea shortly. All your folk of the Roost held us for phantoms {{and things}} of the night from our first appearance; but I do wish you would try to believe in our {{continued}} existence, as flesh and blood obscurely tossed in the Pacific, or walking coral shores, and in our affection, which is more constant than becomes the breasts of such absconders. My good health does not cease to be wonderful to myself: Fanny is better in these warm places; {{it is the very}} thing for Lloyd; and in the matter of interest, the spice of life, etc., words cannot depict what fun we have. Try to have a little more patience with the fugitives, and think of us now and again among the Gilberts, where we ought to be about the time when you receive this scrap. They make no great figure on the atlas, I confess; but you will see the name there, if you look--which I wish you would, and try to conceive us as still extant. We all send the kindest remembrances to all of you; please make one of the girls <b>write</b> <b>us</b> the news to the care of R. Towns & Co., Sydney, New South Wales, where we hope to bring up {{about the end of the}} year--or later. Do not forget yours affectionately, ...|$|E

He is likely to be less careful now that it has been decided that Walter is dead. He is doubtless well {{aware of the fact that}} trustees have a year given them before proceeding to carry out the provisions of a will, and, therefore, for that time he will keep quiet. At the end of the year his solicitor will <b>write</b> <b>us</b> a courteous letter, asking when we shall be in a position to distribute the estate in accordance with the provisions of the will. We shall reply that we are not in a position to do so. Then, after a time, will come letters of a more and more peremptory character, and at last a notice that they are about to apply to the courts for an order for us to act upon the provisions of the will. About two years after the General's death the matter will probably come on. I may say that I have already sent checks to all the small legatees." ...|$|E
