40|$|Abstract: We present asystem called MOSES, {{which is}} amobile <b>work</b> <b>clearance</b> {{management}} system for complex and large-area industrial machines. Based on an extensive field study of current <b>work</b> <b>clearance</b> practices, we identified important challenges and developed several solutions. MOSES shows howanenterprise application, like anenterprise resource planning system, {{can be extended}} to improve occupational safety for maintenance personnel. The presented solution consists of awork clearance management extension for several existing enterprise resource planning systems and amobile <b>work</b> <b>clearance</b> management for mobile devices. The paper also describes a framework called Smart Data Off The Spot (SmartDOTS) for building nomadic distributed enterprise applications that supports data replication and synchronization from various enterprise applications. The framework allows the modelling of business data, so that device-, network and task-specific data replication, and context-dependent network selection can be modelled and automatically be executed by the SmartDOTS framework. This paper shows the design and implementation of aprototypical mobile <b>work</b> <b>clearance</b> system, which uses the SmartDOTS approach. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{computational}} {{methodology for}} dynamic analysis of multibody mechanical systems with imperfect cylindrical joints is presented and {{discussed in this}} <b>work.</b> <b>Clearance</b> and imperfections always exist in actual joints {{in order to ensure}} the correct relative motion between the connected bodies being the gap associated to them a result of machining tolerance, wear, and local deformations. Clearance at different joints is the source for impact forces, resulting in wear and tear of the joints, and consequently the degradation of the system performance. The model for cylindrical joints, presented in this work, is based on a thorough geometric description of contact conditions and on a continuous contact force model, which represents the impact forces. The existence of a clearance in a joint removes the four kinematic constraints associated with the ideal joint, and, hence, four extra degrees of freedom are introduced. When the journal reaches the bearing wall an impact takes place and contact forces control the dynamic of the joint...|$|E

40|$|Compliance with {{treatment}} of latent Tuberculosis infection in healthcare workers OrIgINAl ArTICle Healthcare workers (HCW) are {{at higher risk}} of exposure to tuberculosis than the general population, thus screening upon start of employment and periodically thereafter for latent tuberculosis (TB) infection is required for <b>work</b> <b>clearance</b> in healthcare institutions. Treatment of latent TB infection (lTBI) is recommended in HCW, especially those with conditions that {{increase the risk of}} progression to active tuberculosis but despite evidence of benefit, adherence to treatment remains suboptimal. We undertook a retrospective study of healthcare employees at a large, academic, tertiary care institution in the United States and found that only 73 % were compliant {{with treatment}} of lTBI. Side effects and duration of therapy were major reasons for lack of adherence. Closer follow up during the treatment course, and the use of alternative regimens such as the combination of isoniazid and rifapentine under direct observation for a shorter duration may improve compliance rates in healthcare workers in the future.

50|$|Generally, Collingwood had {{the better}} of the play early in the first quarter, attacking {{primarily}} through rebounds and turnovers. St Kilda won the clearances 12-6 throughout the quarter, and it was through that <b>clearance</b> <b>work</b> that St Kilda was able to build their late quarter recovery. Lenny Hayes was instrumental in St Kilda's <b>clearance</b> <b>work,</b> acting as third-man-up in the ruck contests and collecting ten disposals. All of the key statistics (contested possessions, inside-50s, tackles) except for clearances were fairly even through the quarter.|$|R
40|$|A {{computational}} {{methodology for}} dynamic analysis of multibody mechanical systems with joint clearance {{is presented in}} this <b>work.</b> <b>Clearances</b> always exist in real joints {{in order to ensure}} the correct relative motion between the connected bodies being the gap associated to them a result of machining tolerance, wear, and local deformations. Clearance at different joints is the source for impact forces, resulting in wear and tear of the joints, and consequently the degradation of the system performance. The model for planar revolute joints is based on a thorough geometric description of contact conditions and on a continuous contact force model, which represents the impact forces. It is shown that the model proposed here lead to realistic contact forces. These forces correlate well with the joint reaction forces of an ideal revolute joint, which correspond to a null joint clearance. The application to the analysis of a simple planar multibody system illustrates the use of the different models proposed. Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia (FCT...|$|R

40|$|Design of ExtraVehicular Activity (EVA) {{interfaces}} for International Space Station {{is important}} to successful assembly. This is highlighted by the recent rise in the estimate of time required for EVA during the assembly to 900 hours. The traditional method of evaluating EVA design is examination of mockups in neutral buoyancy testing. While effective, this is costly. Any tools for streamlining this process have positive cost and schedule implications for Station design. The human modelling software package Jack {{has been shown to}} be a useful tool in computer-aided design of space hardware requiring actuation in EVA. The package has been used to aid in the design of flight hardware for a Station Assembly Mission; evaluation was based on comparison of the computer simulations with neutral buoyancy simulations. When used to predict the feasibility of tasks, the software was found to be effective for reach and visibility evaluation. Some limitations have been encountered in prediction of <b>work</b> <b>clearances.</b> Another human simulator is currently being evaluated using the same hardware and comparisons to the same Neutral Buoyancy simulations. Preliminary results for ERGO, which is derived from robotics software, indicate similar strengths and weaknesses...|$|R
