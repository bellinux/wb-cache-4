40|$|Welcome to {{the third}} issue of the Gazette in 2007. As you will be aware, Norman Do, a {{contributor}} to the Gazette for many years, began his new Puzzle Corner with our first issue this year. Norman has assessed submissions for Puzzle Corner 1, and we have our first winner: our congratulations go to S. Krass from Dover Heights in NSW, who has won a $ 50 bookshop voucher! You can read some of the submitted solutions to Puzzle Corner 1 right after this issue’s Puzzle Corner. We are looking forward to your submissions again — send in your solutions to this issue’s problems by 1 September. There is a lot of good news in this issue. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>report</b> on this year’s successful ANZIAM conference in Fremantle, where the J. H.

40|$|In this diverse issue, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>report</b> on {{the high}} cost of {{diabetes}} quality improvement programs. Two studies using health information technology, including one that embedded a questionnaire and tool for bipolar disorder into an electronic health record to improve diagnosis, and another that collected in-formation about anxiety and depression for adolescents with a personal digital assistant. Other articles considered sources of disparities in screening for colorectal cancer in rural Georgia, and the character-istics of sepsis in HIV patients. Clinicians will likely find interesting how patients interpret and report provider reactions to interpersonal violence situations. We also have a review of the symptoms patients report in a community practice sample; breast cancer survivors ’ perspectives on acupuncture for treat-ing hot flashes; clinical reviews about Alzheimer disease and prasugrel; and several interesting brief case reports. (J Am Board Fam Med 2012; 25 : 263 – 265.) The care of patients with diabetes is significantly more expensive than most other patients.

40|$|Readers of {{this journal}} are {{familiar}} with the idea of stance in reading. As Rosenblatt (1978) showed, our response to literature can involve an efferent stance, in which we seek information, or an aesthetic stance, in which we respond to the text as an artwork. Others have id entified ways that individual readers develop their own stances toward a text, e verything from resistance to the idea of reading to deep immersion in which one ’s own life is played out in a fictional narrative. Although it is easy for us to see a novel o r a poem as an artwork, and to imagine different stances one might take t oward that work, it may be more dif-ficult to envision a computer system in su ch a way. Our language leads us away from conceiving of the computer as worth y of a stance when we say “it’s just a tool ” or “it’s only a bunch of 0 s and 1 s. ” Bu t our stance toward a technology may be all the more powerful because we do no t recognize it as such. When we think that we are simply operating a machine, w e cannot see the many ways that our psychological processes shape how we use and interpret it.

40|$|This report {{contains}} {{the results of}} work completed during the eighth year of the Full Waveform Acoustic Logging Consortium in the Earth Resources Laboratory at M. I. T. During the past year, {{we were able to}} accomplish many of the goals we had set out to do. We have concentrated our efforts in understanding logging in fractured and anisotropic media, so as to enable us to infer for the properties of the media from full waveform acoustic logs. For logging in fractured media, we have developed the theory of scattering of Stoneley wave by a horizontal fracture, as well as transmissions through the fracture and attenuation by the fracture. We have also developed the theory for the case when the fractures are small compared to the wavelength of the rock and we have an effective anisotropic medium. In the case of a horizontally layered medium such as a shale, we can invert for the degree of shear wave anisotropy using the Stoneley wave velocity. In the area of logging in permeable formations, we have developed a much sim plified theory that gives similar results as the Biot-Rosenbaum theory. We have also coded the latter for finite-difference modelling. We have developed an inversion algorithm which gives formation permeability from Stoneley wave phase velocity and attenuation. The algorithm gives good results when compared with core permeability measurements. On other related topics, in petrophysics <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>report</b> on the estimation of formation permeability from velocity anisotropy measurements. We have also extended our research away from the borehole to a crosshole situation. We have calculated the near and far field radiation pattern in the formation from a point source inside the borehole. This knowledge is critical in the application of diffraction tomography to crosshole measurements. The following is a summary of the papers in this report...|$|E
40|$|Please {{be on the}} {{look-out}} for {{the green}} alder sawfly, a new invasive defoliator of alder. It has been found at several locations in Alaska and one adult was identified from a photo taken in Clark County, Washington. We {{would like to have}} better records of where it occurs in Washington. So if you see any distinctly green sawfly larvae feeding this spring, please collect specimens and take photos. Live larvae would be preferred (keep in a sealed ziplock bag inflated with air). Adults can be put in vials with alcohol. Please contact me for information on where and how to send specimens. I’m also interested in reports of defoliation by other species of sawfly. Another species that feeds on alder is the striped alder sawfly. In fall 2009, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>report</b> of striped alder sawfly defoliation near Centralia. Sawflies resemble caterpillars of moths or butterflies, but they are actually wasps. One way to tell is that sawfly larvae have more than 5 pairs of prolegs (those sticky leg-like appendages on the abdomen). Thanks for your interest...|$|R
