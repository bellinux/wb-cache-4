25|$|North of the Danube, General of Cavalry Count Heinrich von Bellegarde's I Armeekorps {{was still}} distant. Feldzeugmeister Johann Kollowrat's II Armeekorps {{assembled}} on the Danube's north bank, opposite Regensburg, which was defended {{by a small}} French garrison. South of III Armeekorps, Feldmarschall-Leutnant Archduke Louis' V Armeekorps, minus Lindenau's division, had orders to contain Marshal François Joseph Lefebvre's Bavarian VII Corps near Abensberg. Feldmarschall-Leutnant Michael von Kienmayer's II Reserve Armeekorps, minus its cuirassier brigade, remained at Pfeffenhausen in support of Louis. Feldmarschall-Leutnant Johann von Hiller's VI Armeekorps was on the extreme left <b>wing.</b> <b>Hiller</b> posted Major Scheibler and 1,200 troops at Pfaffenhofen an der Ilm {{to look out for}} Marshal André Masséna's forces. At the beginning of the war, Feldmarschall-Leutnant Franz Jellacic's division was detached from Hiller in order to capture Munich and provide a link between Bavaria and the Tyrol. Hiller ordered Jellacic to rejoin him on 18 April, but the latter never arrived because Charles ordered him back to Munich. Jellacic's luckless command would continue its wanderings until being smashed at the Battle of Sankt Michael on 25 May.|$|R
25|$|On 10 April 1809, Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen's {{surprise}} {{invasion of}} the Kingdom of Bavaria put the Grande Armée of Emperor Napoleon I of France at a disadvantage. On 19 April, Charles failed {{to take advantage of}} his opportunities and Napoleon struck back with savage force against the Austrian left <b>wing</b> under <b>Hiller.</b> After battles on 20 and 21 April, Hiller's troops were driven into a headlong retreat to the southeast.|$|R
50|$|On June 19, 2014, former Red Wings {{assistant}} coach, Bill Peters, {{was hired}} as the new {{head coach of the}} Carolina Hurricanes. On July 15, 2014, the Red Wings hired Tony Granato as an assistant coach. On July 30, 2014, the Red <b>Wings</b> hired Jim <b>Hiller</b> and Andrew Brewer as assistant coaches.|$|R
25|$|The {{previous}} evening, Hiller's VI Armeekorps bivouacked at Mainburg. Though a road ran {{directly from}} Mainburg to Louis' left flank at Siegenburg, {{a distance of}} only 13 kilometers, Hiller elected to join his colleague by a roundabout march via Pfeffenhausen. Once he arrived, Hiller was authorized to take command of all three left <b>wing</b> corps. <b>Hiller</b> personally arrived in Siegenburg to confer with Archduke Louis around midday. Hearing troubling reports from the right flank, he sent Feldmarschall-Leutnant Karl von Vincent toward Rottenburg with the line brigades of Generals-Major Josef Hoffmeister and Nikolaus Weissenwolf, plus four squadrons of the Rosenberg Chevauxlegers Regiment # 6.|$|R
25|$|On the 6th, Bernadotte's Saxons reached Rötz near Cham {{in their}} march around {{the west side}} of Bohemia. Napoleon wanted the IX Corps to be at Passau on the 9th, with the {{possibility}} of being ordered from there to Linz. On 7 May, Archduke Charles left Budweis with his main army. He ordered Kollowrat to move from Plzeň (Pilsen) and guard his southern flank. On the 8th, the Austrian army commander ordered Kollowrat to menace the French supply line near Linz. Charles reunited with <b>Hiller's</b> <b>wing</b> on the north bank of the Danube on 16 May.|$|R
25|$|On 8 May, most of <b>Hiller's</b> <b>wing,</b> {{including}} Kienmayer's corps, {{crossed to}} the north bank of the Danube at Mautern an der Donau. Within a short time, d'Aspré's grenadiers {{crossed to the}} south bank again to assist in Archduke Maximilian of Austria-Este's short-lived defense of Vienna. Other defending forces were landwehr under Andreas O'Reilly von Ballinlough, a division led by Josef von Dedovich, and a brigade co-commanded by Armand von Nordmann and Joseph, Baron von Mesko de Felsö-Kubiny. At 3:00 AM on 12 April, d'Aspré led his five battalions in {{an attack on the}} French positions at the Lusthaus on Prater Island. The attack was repulsed by the defenders, but its real purpose was to cover the Austrian retreat to the north bank of the Danube, which was successfully carried out.|$|R
50|$|One Austrian brigade led by General-major Prince Louis Victor de Rohan became {{separated}} from Archduke John's army. Hoping to join Feldmarschall-Leutnant Johann von <b>Hiller's</b> <b>wing</b> of Archduke Charles' army in Italy, Rohan {{looked to the}} south. Starting from Landeck in the County of Tyrol on 10 November, he marched to the south. Missing both Hiller and Charles, he determined to cut his way to Venice. Seizing Bolzano on 18 November, he then marched his brigade south to Trento. Turning east into the Val Sugana and south into the Brenta River valley, the Austrians surprised the French garrison of Bassano on 22 November. Marching hard, the Austrians reached Castelfranco Veneto the next evening. On 24 November, Rohan's epic march {{came to an end}} in the Battle of Castelfranco Veneto when his troops were trapped between the divisions of Generals of Division Jean Reynier and Laurent Gouvion Saint-Cyr. After a brief struggle, 4,400 Austrian soldiers surrendered.|$|R
50|$|One Austrian brigade led by General-major Prince Louis Victor de Rohan-Guéméné became {{separated}} from Archduke John's army. Hoping to join Feldmarschall-Leutnant Johann von <b>Hiller's</b> <b>wing</b> of Archduke Charles' army in Italy, Rohan {{looked to the}} south. Starting from Landeck in the County of Tyrol on 10 November, he marched his men south. Missing both Hiller and Charles, he determined to cut his way to Venice. Seizing Bolzano on 18 November, he then marched his brigade south to Trento. From there, he turned east into the Val Sugana before swinging south into the Brenta River valley. Where the Brenta leaves the mountains, the Austrians surprised and ejected the French garrison of Bassano on 22 November. Marching hard, the Austrians reached Castelfranco Veneto the next evening. On 24 November, Rohan's epic march {{came to an end}} when his troops were trapped between the divisions of Generals of Division Jean Reynier and Laurent Gouvion Saint-Cyr.
