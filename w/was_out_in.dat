5|$|Hassett {{batted in}} a {{restrained}} manner, while Bradman attacked. The Australian captain was 31 and his deputy 13 as the tourists reached stumps at 1/63. Bradman did {{the majority of}} the scoring during the closing stages of the afternoon, adding 31 in a partnership of 50. On the third morning, play resumed in hot and humid conditions. In the second over delivered by Dick Pollard, the bowler made the second ball lift unexpectedly. Hassett was unable {{to get out of the}} way and edged the ball to Jack Crapp for 13. Bradman <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the same over and Australia were in trouble at 3/68, but they recovered after a middle-order counterattack took them to 458 early on the fourth day. Hassett then caught Bedser during England's second innings.|$|E
5|$|Marsden reappears on Albert Square in 2009 when Archie Mitchell (Larry Lamb) is murdered. She {{arrives on}} the scene when several people say they suspect Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks), but Marsden waits before {{questioning}} her, and questions the Mitchells first. She makes a televised appeal for witnesses and later interviews Phil, but he is provided an alibi by his girlfriend Shirley Carter (Linda Henry). A few days later, a red fingernail is found {{at the scene of}} the murder; Marsden visits the female locals, checking their hands. Seeing an upset Heather Trott (Cheryl Fergison), knowing that she is vulnerable and lives with Shirley, she talks to Heather about Christmas Day and Heather accidentally tells Marsden that Phil wasn't there. Marsden interviews Phil and later visits his home, asking to see the clothes he was wearing on Christmas Day. Shirley shows her a clean shirt; Marsden closes the laundrette, hoping anyone with blood-stained clothes will not be able to wash them. After a tip-off Marsden arrests Sam Mitchell (Danniella Westbrook); Sam accuses her mother, Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor), of the murder. Marsden confirms that she was there to talk to Peggy, questioning Peggy and Sam at the police station. Peggy is released without charge; however, Sam is detained for jumping bail. Marsden visits Janine, who insists that people will say anything to get her in trouble. She asks Janine why she <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the cold on Christmas Day, and asks if Janine knows where Archie's laptop as it had gone missing.|$|E
5|$|The next day, Bedser batted on in steady {{support of}} Edrich. The pair saw England to lunch without further loss, and 155 runs were added {{for the third}} wicket before Bedser <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the second session after almost three hours of batting. Bedser had struck eight fours and two sixes in a Test career best 79 before {{returning}} a catch to the off spin of Johnson. Edrich fell to Johnson after three further runs were added with the score at 426/4. He had batted for 314 minutes in compiling 111, with 13 fours and a six. With two new batsmen at the crease, Australia quickly made further inroads. Toshack bowled Crapp for five and after Compton and Yardley added 26 for the sixth wicket, the former edged Lindwall and Saggers had his first Test catch to leave England at 473/6. Playing in his first Test of the summer, Loxton then successively removed Cranston, Evans and Laker as England fell from 486/6 to 496/9. Miller then bowled the English skipper Yardley to end England's innings at 496. The home side had batted for 192.1 overs and lost their last eight wickets for the addition of 73 runs. Loxton took 3/55 while Lindwall and Johnson both took two. Australia lost the services of Toshack after he broke down with a knee injury. With Barnes injured, Hassett was moved from the middle order to open the innings with Morris. Bedser removed Morris for six with the new ball, to leave Australia at 13/1, before Bradman and Hassett saw the tourists to stumps at 63/1. Bradman did {{the majority of the}} scoring in the late afternoon, finishing unbeaten on 31 in a partnership of 40.|$|E

5|$|Trevor is Canadian, born {{just north}} of the border of the United States. He grew up with a {{physically}} abusive father and an emotionally abusive mother. Trevor had a brother, Ryan, who died prior to the game's events. Trevor's father abandoned him in a shopping mall, which he later burned down in retaliation. His father died when Trevor was 10. This upbringing combined with Trevor's violent temper led Trevor to be severely unhinged, leading to numerous fights at school, including an assault on a teacher. Trevor loved planes, and at some point entered the military as a pilot, but was quickly forced to leave after being reproved in a psychological evaluation. Later on, Trevor committed crimes, the first one being a small robbery that landed him in jail for six months (however, due to good behavior, he <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> four). He would continue his criminal ways, including using his piloting skills to become a smuggler. Trevor eventually met Michael Townley and both men realised that they wanted to earn money by performing large heists, and both men became successful in doing so. However, their partnership began to strain after Michael married a stripper named Amanda and started a family with her.|$|E
25|$|In the 2011/12 Ryobi Cup final in Adelaide, Bailey {{showed he}} {{is made of}} stern stuff; he scored 101 and <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the last over.

25|$|Flintoff {{enforced}} the follow on, {{and once}} again Mubarak <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> single figures to Hoggard, the total 10 for one. However, Tharanga and Sangakkara built Sri Lanka's largest partnership of the match thus far, both making half-centuries and sharing a stand of 109. Eventually both batsmen were caught by Jones off spinner Monty Panesar, with Sangakkara's innings lasting {{four and a half}} hours for 65 runs, but at this point England required seven wickets and had two days to do it in.|$|E
25|$|The MCC {{continued}} {{south into}} Victoria for another Country XI game, {{this time a}} one-day knockabout. The local team batted first and the off-spinner Peter Smith took another useful 6/43. Smith was ill {{during much of the}} tour and proved too slow in the air for first class cricket in Australia, so was used in the minor games to rest other players. Gibb (49) and Fishlock (41) opened again and Bill Edrich made 62 as they passed the Victorian Country XI total of 156 for a four wicket win, but carried on batting to 200/4, when Edrich <b>was</b> <b>out,</b> <b>in</b> order to gather some batting practice.|$|E
25|$|Crawshaw {{made his}} Wednesday debut on 1 September 1894, {{the opening day}} of the 1894–95 season, in a 1–3 away defeat at Everton. He made an {{immediate}} impact in the side missing only two matches that season and was called up for the England side before the season <b>was</b> <b>out.</b> <b>In</b> the following campaign Crawshaw was part of the Wednesday side which won the FA Cup, he played in all six ties, scoring in the 3–1 semi-final replay victory over Bolton Wanderers. However he did make an uncharacteristic mistake in the final against Wolves when an error allowed David Black to equalise before Wednesday went on to win 2–1 through two Fred Spiksley goals.|$|E

25|$|Mendis {{recorded}} {{a string of}} poor scores on New Zealand's tour of the island in 1984, only passing 20 once in six Test innings. By this time, however, he was established as {{the captain of the}} side, and still picked for the Test match in England that English summer. Mendis made his third Test century as Sri Lanka smashed 491 for 7 batting first amid the rain, and the first Test century by a Sri Lankan captain while in office. Sri Lanka drew that Test. A poor World Series Cup in 1984–85 followed, where Sri Lanka only won one out of ten ODIs, and Mendis <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> single figures four times.|$|E
25|$|Fredricks, Lewis, and Price {{all left}} in 1983, and were {{replaced}} by the returning Johnny Moore, Joe Blunt, and Clyde Brown. In 1986, the group split up, and a new lineup was constructed by Treadwell, consisting of new member Jonah Ellis and former members Ray Lewis, Billy Lewis, and Louis Price. The next year, more former members came in as replacements, making the group Moore, Billy and Ray Lewis, and Gene Jenkins (replaced shortly after by George Chandler, then John Thurston). Ray Lewis <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> 1988, {{and was replaced by}} Joe Cofie. In 1989, Billy Lewis left, and was replaced by the returning George Chandler, then Tony Jackson, Keith John, and finally Peter Lamarr in 1990.|$|E
25|$|In {{the next}} match against South Africa, Nitschke was {{prominent}} with both bat and ball as Australia batted first. After Villani <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the first over, Nitschke and new batsman Poulton counter-attacked. They brought up Australia's 50 in 33 balls, scoring 41 from 27 balls. Poulton was out for 39 after {{a stand of}} 58 runs in 37 balls, and Nitschke was eventually out for the top-score of 44 from 32 balls, including seven fours. This left the score at 3/101 after 11.2 overs, but Australia were unable to capitalise, and were bowled out for 155 in the last over after losing 6/16. Nitschke then took 2/21 from her four overs, removing Trisha Chetty and Susan Benade in the 11th and 13th overs as Australia completed a 22-run win. She was named the player of the match for her effort.|$|E

25|$|MacGregor {{also played}} in the Home Nations Championship in 1891 and 1893, missing the 1892 tournament as he <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> Australia with Lord Sheffield's cricket team in 1892, and in 1894 he played against England and Wales. His final {{appearance}} in an international game being between Scotland and England, decided at Hampden Park, Glasgow, in 1896. Although he began and finished his career in matches as a full back, MacGregor played mostly in those games as a centre three-quarter—those when the three three-quarter system was preferred. In {{the course of his}} career he appeared on several occasions for Middlesex. On one of these, when the four three-quarter system had come into vogue, he had for his colleagues Andrew Stoddart, Arthur Gould, and G. T. Campbell, all internationals. Despite such talented players all appearing in the same team, Yorkshire proved victorious.|$|E
25|$|His {{experience}} {{in the region and}} in particular his perceived Labour sympathies at that time led to Clement Attlee appointing him Viceroy of India on 20 February 1947 charged with overseeing the transition of British India to independence no later than 30 June 1948. Mountbatten's instructions emphasised a united India {{as a result of the}} transference of power but authorised him to adapt to a changing situation in order to get Britain out promptly with minimal reputational damage. Soon after he arrived, Mountbatten concluded that the situation was too volatile for even that short a wait. Although his advisers favoured a gradual transfer of independence, Mountbatten decided the only way forward was a quick and orderly transfer of independence before 1947 <b>was</b> <b>out.</b> <b>In</b> his view, any longer would mean civil war. The Viceroy also hurried so he could return to his senior technical Navy courses.|$|E
25|$|His form dropped {{slightly}} {{as he continued}} to make 40s and 30s but failed to convert to 50s and larger scores. He was given a chance to regain this lost form when Pakistan U19 toured England in August 2007. Godleman opened the innings with Alex Wakely and the two shared a relatively slow but prolific opening partnership which ended at 198 when Wakely departed for 112. Godleman fell soon after for 71 but England went on to amass 532 all out. Pakistan U19 were then bowled out for 214 and 260 resulting in England winning by an innings and 58 runs. The second test saw another good opening partnership of 95 and this time Godleman went on to make a U19 Test Match century, eventually being caught out on 115. He <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the second innings however for a duck as Pakistan {{went on to win the}} 2nd test by 3 wickets and level the series at 1–1.|$|E

25|$|Game 5 {{began with}} the unconventional, soulful singing of the {{national}} anthem by José Feliciano, drawing boos from some Detroit fans. When the game got underway, the Cardinals immediately scored three runs {{in the first inning}} off Mickey Lolich. In the fifth inning, Lou Brock doubled, and the Cardinals had a chance to break the game open, but Brock tried to score from second base on a single to left field. Brock <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> a collision with Bill Freehan at home plate, as Willie Horton's throw hit Bill Freehan's glove on the fly, and Brock elected not to slide. Brock later remarked that he never slid because no one had ever tried to throw him out at home. In the 7th inning, the Cardinals led, 3–2. Mickey Lolich led off for the Tigers in the 7th inning with a bloop single, and the Tigers loaded the bases for Al Kaline to slap a single into right field, driving in two runs. Cash drove in another run, and the Tigers led, 5–3, which proved to be the final score. Mickey Lolich pitched his second complete game victory.|$|E
25|$|Post tea-break, Sehwag and Dravid steadied the Indian innings {{further and}} carried forward to 278/1 along with Dravid, who, having come off 305 runs in Adelaide, {{had made a}} patient 49 from 89 balls with 5 boundaries. Steve Waugh gave himself an {{extended}} bowling spell, and against the run of play, produced a delivery which was well outside leg-stump, but Dravid aimed a shot to Damien Martyn at forward square leg, and it appeared that Dravid, who had faced a lot of short deliveries from Waugh, had not anticipated this delivery. Dravid's dismissal apparently did not hamper Sehwag's rapid progress, as he whipped a delivery to square-leg boundary with a flourish, off Brad Williams in the next over after the second wicket. However, Tendulkar was soon dismissed by Lee, trying to work a delivery in the legside fine. He was the third wicket to fall at 286/3. The Indian captain, Sourav Ganguly walked into the middle to join Sehwag, whose response to the two quick wickets was to just smash a MacGill delivery next over for a six above midwicket. However, Sehwag's approach hastened his end, as he <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the 78th over, bowled by Simon Katich, the next ball after he had hit a six.|$|E
25|$|The Australian captain Ricky Ponting {{brought on}} {{part-time}} spinner Michael Clarke to bowl the 11th over, and got immediate success, when Pietersen launched him to Matthew Hayden {{on the fifth}} ball, but England were still 101 for 3 after 11 overs. In the next over, the new batsman Michael Vaughan edged Andrew Symonds' ball to midwicket, and the pressure was suddenly on the English. With Trescothick out for 41 a bit later to an attempted sweep off Symonds, England were suddenly looking down a hole after a fine start, and Andrew Strauss and Paul Collingwood slowed the scoring, to see England 111 for 5 with six overs to play. However, a slog sweep from Collingwood to end the 15th over turned the match again, as it went away for six and England moved to 124 for 5. With Jason Gillespie being brought back, Collingwood led the charge, as England stole 17 runs off the 17th over and wrought control of the game again. Despite Andrew Strauss being bowled by Gillespie for 18, Collingwood hit another two boundaries {{towards the end of}} the over, to move onto 42 not out and the team score to 167 for 6. Vikram Solanki <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the next over for 9, caught by Hussey off McGrath, and on the last ball, Collingwood was caught by for 46. Still, England would be pleased with 179 for 8, the highest score on the Rose Bowl in Twenty20 matches.|$|E
