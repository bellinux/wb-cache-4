In describing his interactions with Iwakami and Shinbo while collaborating on the series, Urobuchi commented that [...] "neither one is the type to show their hand, they would always <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to make the next move." [...] In his effort to create a successful deconstruction of the magical girl genre, Urobuchi studied aspects of traditional magical girl media that were [...] "troubling or overlooked". He also stated that the development of the plot was heavily influenced by the character drawings he saw Aoki design. Other inspirations he credited for contributing to the series included horror fiction author Stephen King as well as previous projects that Shinbo directed such as Hidamari Sketch and Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha.|$|E

2500|$|The Soviet Union {{comprised}} over 150 different peoples, but Russians {{comprised the}} majority of the Red Army and Russian was the language of command. The Red Army had very few ethnic units as the policy was one of sliianie (blending) in which men from the non-Russian groups were assigned to units with Russian majorities. One of the few exceptions to this rule were the Cossack units together with the troops from the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, who however were few in number. The experience of combat tended to bind the men regardless of their language or ethnicity together with one Soviet veteran recalling: “We were all bleeding the same blood”. Despite a history of anti-Semitism in Russia, Jewish veterans serving in the frontovik units described anti-Semitism as rare, instead recalling a sense of belonging. During {{the first six months of}} Operation Barbarossa, the Wehrmacht and the SS had a policy of shooting all of the [...] "Asiatics" [...] (a term which was defined to include all Red Army personal who looked Asian), commissars, Jews and Georgians serving in the Red Army who were taken prisoner by German forces. For this reason, Georgians, Jews and the various Asian peoples like the Kalmyks, the Buryats, the Kazakhs, the Kyrgyz, etc. fought especially fiercely. During the war, the atheist propaganda was toned down and Eastern Orthodox priests blessed units going into battle, though chaplains were not allowed. However, Muslims from Central Asia, the Caucasus, the Volga and the Crimea were allowed to practice their religion discreetly, though like the Eastern Orthodox no chaplains were allowed. Most soldiers carried lucky talismans. Despite the official atheism, many soldiers wore crosses around their necks and crossed themselves in the traditional Eastern Orthodox manner before going into battle, through the British historian Catherine Merridale cautioned these were more [...] "totemic" [...] gestures meant to ensure good luck rather than expressions of real faith. One of the most popular talismans was the poem <b>Wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>Me</b> by Konstantin Simonov, which he wrote in October 1941 for his fiancee Valentina Serova. The popularity of <b>Wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>Me</b> was such that almost all ethnic Russians in the Red Army knew the poem by heart, and carried a copy of the poem together with photographs of their girlfriends or wives back home to reflect their desire to return to their loved ones.|$|E
