5|$|Data {{from the}} {{captured}} Zero had been {{transmitted to the}} U.S. Navy's Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) and Grumman Aircraft. After careful study, Roy Grumman decided that he could match or surpass the Zero in most respects, except in range, without sacrificing pilot armor, self-sealing tanks and fuselage structure. The new F6F Hellcat would compensate for the extra <b>weight</b> <b>with</b> additional power.|$|E
5|$|The Earth's {{crust is}} made of {{approximately}} 5% of heavy metals by <b>weight,</b> <b>with</b> iron comprising 95% of this quantity. Light metals (~20%) and nonmetals (~75%) make up the other 95% of the crust. Despite their overall scarcity, heavy metals can become concentrated in economically extractable quantities {{as a result of}} mountain building, erosion, or other geological processes.|$|E
5|$|Artificial {{climbing}} {{walls are}} used to simulate boulder problems in an indoor environment, usually at climbing gyms. These walls are constructed with wooden panels, polymer cement panels, concrete shells, or precast molds of actual rock walls. Holds, usually made of plastic, are then bolted onto the wall to create problems. The walls often feature steep overhanging surfaces, forcing the climber to employ highly technical movements while supporting much of their <b>weight</b> <b>with</b> their upper body strength.|$|E

5|$|In {{the solid}} state, flerovium is {{expected}} to be a dense metal due to its high atomic <b>weight,</b> <b>with</b> a density variously predicted to be either 22g·cm−3 or 14g·cm−3. The electron of the hydrogen-like flerovium ion (oxidized so that it only has one electron, Fl113+) {{is expected to}} move so fast that it has a mass 1.79 times that of a stationary electron, due to relativistic effects. For comparison, the figures for hydrogen-like lead and tin are expected to be 1.25 and 1.073 respectively. Flerovium would form weaker metal–metal bonds than lead and would be adsorbed less on surfaces.|$|E
5|$|Yttrium has {{no known}} {{biological}} role, {{though it is}} found in most, if not all, organisms and tends to concentrate in the liver, kidney, spleen, lungs, and bones of humans. Normally, as little as 0.5milligrams {{is found in the}} entire human body; human breast milk contains 4ppm. Yttrium can be found in edible plants in concentrations between 20ppm and 100ppm (fresh <b>weight),</b> <b>with</b> cabbage having the largest amount. With as much as to 700ppm, the seeds of woody plants have the highest known concentrations.|$|E
5|$|The average horse {{can carry}} up to {{approximately}} 30% {{of its body}} weight. While all horses can pull more than they can carry, the weight horses can pull varies widely, depending on the build of the horse, the type of vehicle, road conditions, and other factors. Horses harnessed to a wheeled vehicle on a paved road can pull as much as eight times their weight, but far less if pulling wheelless loads over unpaved terrain. Thus, horses that were driven varied in size and {{had to make a}} trade-off between speed and weight, just as did riding animals. Light horses could pull a small war chariot at speed. Heavy supply wagons, artillery, and support vehicles were pulled by heavier horses or a larger number of horses. The method by which a horse was hitched to a vehicle also mattered: horses could pull greater <b>weight</b> <b>with</b> a horse collar than they could with a breast collar, and even less with an ox yoke.|$|E

5|$|The diet {{of adult}} American {{alligators}} from central Florida lakes {{was dominated by}} fish, highly opportunistically based upon local availability. In Lake Griffin, fish made up 54% of the diet by <b>weight,</b> <b>with</b> catfish being most commonly consumed while in Lake Apopka, fish made up 90% {{of the food and}} mostly shad were taken and in Lake Woodruff the diet was 84% fish and largely consists of bass and sunfish. Unusually in these regions, reptiles and amphibians were the most important non-piscivore prey, mostly comprised by turtles and water snakes. In southern Louisiana, crustaceans (largely crayfish and crabs) were found to be present in the southeastern American alligators but largely absent in the southwestern American alligator which consumed a relatively high proportion of reptiles, although fish were the most recorded prey for adult American alligators and adult males consumed a large portion of mammals. In East Texas, diets were diverse and adult American alligators took mammals, reptiles, amphibians and invertebrates (i.e. snails) in often equal measure as they did fish.|$|E
5|$|The {{nestling}} period also {{varies by}} species size, with larger species having longer nestling periods. It is also affected by season {{and environmental factors}} and by competition with siblings in species with clutch sizes greater than one. Much {{of what is known}} about the nestling period of some species is dependent on aviary studies– aviary cockatiels can fledge after 5weeks and the large palm cockatoos after 11weeks. During this period, the young become covered in juvenile plumage while remaining in the hollow. Wings and tail feathers are slow to grow initially but more rapid as the primary feathers appear. Nestlings quickly reach about 80–90% of adult weight about two thirds of the time through this period, plateauing before they leave the hollow; they fledge at this <b>weight</b> <b>with</b> wing and tail feathers still to grow a little before reaching adult dimensions. Growth rate of the young, as well as numbers fledged, are adversely impacted by reduced food supply and poor weather conditions.|$|E
5|$|The valence {{electrons}} of moscovium fall into three subshells: 7s (two electrons), 7p1/2 (two electrons), and 7p3/2 (one electron). The first {{two of these}} are relativistically stabilized and hence behave as inert pairs, while the last is relativistically destabilized and can easily participate in chemistry. (The 6d electrons are not destabilized enough to participate chemically, although this may still be possible in the two previous elements nihonium and flerovium.) Thus, the +1 oxidation state should be favored, like Tl+, and consistent with this the first ionization potential of moscovium should be around 5.58eV, continuing the trend towards lower ionization potentials down the pnictogens. Moscovium and nihonium both have one electron outside a quasi-closed shell configuration that can be delocalized in the metallic state: thus they should have similar melting and boiling points (both melting around 400°C and boiling around 1100°C) due {{to the strength of}} their metallic bonds being similar. Additionally, the predicted ionization potential, ionic radius (1.5Å for Mc+; 1.0Å for Mc3+), and polarizability of Mc+ are expected to be more similar to Tl+ than its true congener Bi3+. Moscovium should be a dense metal due to its high atomic <b>weight,</b> <b>with</b> a density around 13.5g/cm3. The electron of the hydrogen-like moscovium atom (oxidized so that it only has one electron, Mc114+) is expected to move so fast that it has a mass 1.82 times that of a stationary electron, due to relativistic effects. For comparison, the figures for hydrogen-like bismuth and antimony are expected to be 1.25 and 1.077 respectively.|$|E
