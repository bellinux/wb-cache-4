Hit-Boy who had previously worked with Frank Ocean on Norwood's Human album returned to production on Two Eleven with the ballad [...] "White Flag", which discusses [...] "emotional defeat". However it was excluded from the final track listing. Norwood's collaboration with Drake was a song written by James Fauntleroy and produced by Noah [...] "40" [...] Shebib; however it failed to come to fruition. A press release from RCA Records announced that Breyon Prescott was overseeing the album with productions by the aforementioned producers as well as Mario Winans and writing from Ester Dean. Despite Prescott stating that Timbaland was in the studios crafting a song for the album, Norwood revealed on August 29, 2012, that the album was complete and that time didn't allow for her and the producer to work together.|$|E
