500|$|Diana, Princess of Wales was interred on a {{small island}} {{in the middle of}} the {{ornamental}} Round Oval lake, which was created by Teulon in 1868. The island was decided as the best place to lay her to rest because the water would, according to Spencer, [...] "act as a buffer against the interventions of the insane and ghoulish, the thick mud presenting a further line of defence. <b>We</b> <b>all</b> <b>agreed</b> that, with its beauty and tranquillity, this was the place for Diana to be". [...] The ground was consecrated by the Bishop of Peterborough prior to the burial. [...] Her burial place is marked with a white memorial plinth and urn.|$|E
500|$|After {{taking a}} pay cut to start the 1949 season, Feller pitched on Opening Day against the St. Louis Browns. During the game, he injured his {{shoulder}} and missed the rest of April. His performances were mixed {{in the rest of}} the season and he finished the year with a 15-14 record and a 3.75 ERA. Before the 1950 season, Feller suggested to Indians management he take {{a pay cut}}, and did so. Indians general manager Hank Greenberg said, [...] "He himself made the suggestion. In fact, he offered to take more than the 25 per cent maximum pay cut allowed. There was absolutely nothing to it. <b>We</b> <b>all</b> <b>agreed</b> quickly on the figure after Bob showed up yesterday." [...] In a win over the Detroit Tigers in the second game of a doubleheader, Feller became the 53rd pitcher to win 200 games. Throughout the year, players noted that his velocity had returned, and, winning games with finesse rather than power, he was again effective. He finished the year with 16 wins and a 3.43 ERA.|$|E
500|$|Shawn Roberts was {{originally}} going {{to audition for}} Chris Redfield before Miller accepted the role. He went to audition {{for the role of}} Albert Wesker, a role previously played by Jason O'Mara. Describing the character Roberts said, [...] " [...] Chairman of the Umbrella Corporation. He is in a position of power. He pretty much runs the world, and Alice is an annoyance. It's a whole process: I get to set and wardrobe gives me this big, long black jacket, and props comes over and gives me the dark glasses and the gloves. By the time you are all dressed you stand a little straighter, you walk a little differently.

500|$|In an {{interview}} following the airing of the episode, Podeswa stated about {{the scene in}} which Jon Snow is resurrected; [...] "I think just establishing {{the right amount of}} tension through the scene, so you really didn't know up until the last second which way it was going to go. That was the biggest thing, creating a sense of mystery and magic around the whole thing. We really wanted that scene to be very beautiful, but also fraught with tension. That's the main thing we were looking for." [...] Podeswa also compared how he shot the scene to The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp by Rembrandt, continuing, [...] "It had a very rich, textual, moody, atmospheric quality. I think we were all in that space for a long time for this scene — while we were shooting all the scenes involving Jon Snow's body, really, but particularly the one where he's resurrected." [...] In another interview Podeswa described how the resurrection would play out on screen, noting [...] "There was much discussion about what that actually was: There's this sense of rebirth and whether it should be a big moment or a small moment. We tried a lot of different things, but it really felt to me, and I think <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>agreed,</b> this first gasp of life, like what a baby has when it's born, is kind of what it needed to be. And I just thought he did that so great." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{tour of the}} United States faced various troubles. Ament {{said that}} the band and its crew had to [...] " [...] shows from the ground up, a venue {{everywhere}} we went." [...] In June 1995, the band was scheduled to play at San Francisco, California's Golden Gate Park in front of 50,000 people. Before the concert Vedder was forced to stay at a hospital after suffering {{from the effects of}} food poisoning. Vedder left the hospital to play the show, however {{he was not able to}} finish and ended up performing just seven out of twenty-one songs with the band. Neil Young filled in for Vedder for the rest of the show that day. Vedder said, [...] "That whole [...] thing was a blur based on some bad food. It was really, really bad. Looking back at it, it doesn't seem as intense as it was, but it was horrible. I just felt not human and looking back I should have got through that show somehow, and I think the fact that Neil [...] was there made me feel like I could get off the hook in some way and I did go out for a few songs." [...] Because of Vedder's health the band was forced to cancel the remaining dates of its tour of the United States. Some dates were reinstated while the rest were rescheduled for the fall. About canceling the dates, Vedder said, [...] "I think <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>agreed</b> that it had gotten insane, that it was no longer about the music." [...] Ament later said, [...] "We were so hardheaded about the 1995 tour. Had to prove we could tour on our own, and it pretty much killed us, killed our career." ...|$|E

2500|$|On-screen, Sam's {{marriage}} to Ricky ended following {{an affair with}} a yuppie named Clive (Sean Gallagher), and she took a job on a cruise ship. Commenting on her initial departure, Westbrook has said, [...] "My contract was up for renewal and I thought {{it was time for me}} to move on [...] As much as I enjoyed being in EastEnders [...] I was also well aware of the fact that I was in danger of being type-cast forever if I carried on playing Sam. The producers didn't have a problem with me leaving. It was felt that my character had done as much as she could in the space of three years, anyway. During that time Sam had, after all, been involved in a story about under-age sex, run off to Gretna Green to marry Ricky, been evicted from her home, become a squatter, tried her luck as a topless model, fought on a regular basis with Grant and Phil, and gone through a marriage break-up. I think <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>agreed</b> that the poor girl was in need of a break [...] In January 1993 I filmed my final scenes and Sam Mitchell, in true EastEnders style, waved goodbye to Albert Square from the back of a London taxi cab [...] Although the producers agreed that it was the right time for my character to move on, they wanted to keep the door open for her to return at a later date, as they knew how popular the Mitchell family were with viewers. I was really pleased that they decided not to kill the character off". Her departure scenes aired on 4 February 1993.|$|E

[...] After she recorded the vocals, McKee pulled Luke and Martin aside and told them her idea, to which they responded, [...] "Well why didn't you {{say that in the}} first place?". The chorus was rewritten, and the line [...] "Skin tight jeans" [...] was taken from the early [...] "trying me on" [...] version. When the final version was finished, McKee said, [...] "We were all so pumped that it had paid off. I remember Max sitting back and saying 'I wish we could bottle this feeling'. It was really magical." [...] Perry commented that even though the song was rewritten many times, she was [...] "so happy to finally get somewhere that <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>agreed</b> on" [...] after it was finished. During an interview in June 2010, Perry confirmed [...] "Teenage Dream" [...] as the second single from the album, and said that the song was about [...] "kind of like feeling that way when you were a teenager: really emotional, really invested..... It's intense being in love and being a teenager." [...] After confirming that [...] "Teenage Dream" [...] was also the title of the album, she explained that it was a throwback to her teenage years, as she thought back to her youth while contemplating marriage to her boyfriend Russell Brand. She added, [...] "To me, this year is pretty heavy. I am going to be getting married and putting out this record, and there is so much going on that it's nice to think of those young dreams." ...|$|E
