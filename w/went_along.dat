5|$|The {{above-mentioned}} migration {{was undertaken}} by {{a part of}} the Jastorf population, which probably included the tribes later called Bastarnae and Scirii in Greek written sources, noted because of their military exploits around Greece and Greek colonies in the later part of the 3rd century BC. Their route <b>went</b> <b>along</b> the Warta and Noteć rivers, then crossed Kujawy and Masovia, turned south along the Bug River and continued on to what today is Moldavia, where they settled and developed the Poienesti-Lukasevka culture. The route is marked by archeological findings, especially the characteristic bronze crown-shaped necklaces.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} Roseville Avenue station {{dates back}} to the opening of the Morris & Essex Railroad Station in 1856, when tracks were constructed through the Roseville district of Newark.

The station was designed with two platforms, one along each line, the Morris & Essex first made use of the Montclair Branch property in April 1868 after buying the Newark and Bloomfield Railroad.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Pacific War, remnants of the United States Asiatic Fleet fled to Australia, on orders from Washington. The S-boats from the Philippines were organized into a fighting force at Brisbane, and Admiral Ernest King ordered S-boats from the Atlantic Fleet to supplement the force in Australia. Christie <b>went</b> <b>along,</b> arriving in April 1942, {{just in time for the}} Battle of the Coral Sea. During the Solomon Islands campaign, he ordered his boats to patrol around harbors which, while being key points for shipping, also tended to be heavily patrolled by aircraft and anti-submarine craft. In step with then-current U.S. Navy submarine doctrine, he made capital ships the prime targets, rather than have his boats focus on merchant shipping.|$|E

5|$|Bagramyan was {{instrumental}} in the planning of two Soviet counter-offensives against the Germans, including the major push made by Soviet forces in December during the Battle of Moscow, and for this was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant General. In the same month, he was made the chief of staff of a military operations group that would oversee three Army Groups: the Southern, the Southwestern and Bryansk Fronts. In March 1942, he <b>went</b> <b>along</b> with Khrushchev and Timoshenko to Moscow to present the plans of a new counter-offensive in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv to Stalin. Stalin, impressed with his plan, approved the operation and on April 8, promoted Bagramyan as Chief of Staff of the Southwestern Front. On 12 May 1942, armies of the Southwestern Front attacked Kharkiv but the launch of the offensive came at an inopportune moment since they were attacking from the Barvenkovo Salient, a region that German forces were near closing.|$|E

Mandaba <b>went</b> <b>along</b> with the plan, but his allegiance remained with Bokassa. When Banza contacted his co-conspirators on 8 April 1969, informing them that they would execute the coup the following day, Mandaba immediately phoned Bokassa and informed him of the plan. When Banza entered Camp Kassaï on 9 April 1969, he was ambushed by Mandaba and his soldiers. The men had to break Banza's arms before they could overpower and throw him {{into the trunk of}} a Mercedes and take him directly to Bokassa. At his house in Berengo, Bokassa beat Banza nearly to death before Mandaba suggested that Banza be put on trial for appearance's sake.|$|E
5|$|Hayes {{took office}} {{determined}} {{to reform the}} system of civil service appointments, which had been based on the spoils system since Andrew Jackson was president forty years earlier. Sherman was not a civil service reformer, but he <b>went</b> <b>along</b> with Hayes's instructions. The foremost enemy of reform—and Hayes—was New York Senator Roscoe Conkling, and it was to Conkling's spoilsmen that Hayes first turned his attention. At Hayes's direction, Sherman ordered John Jay to investigate the New York Custom House, which was stacked with Conkling's appointees. Jay's report suggested that the New York Custom House was so overstaffed with political appointees that 20% of the employees were expendable.|$|E

To the south of the fort were three lines of defense. The lines went through the hills and were made of trenches and foxholes. The first line was supported by a second line about 0.33mi (0.5km) to the north, and a third line was planned to be built 0.25mi (0.4km) north of the second.|$|E
5|$|Takumi {{felt that}} the best way to write a mystery with a good climax is to reveal various clues, and then pull them {{together}} into one conclusion, and not have multiple possible endings. He said that the biggest challenge with that was to make the gameplay and story work together; the goal was to make the player feel like they have driven the story forward themselves, with their own choices, even though the game is linear. He only spent little time on writing a backstory for Phoenix before writing the first game's story, and instead made up dialogue and developed Phoenix's personality as he <b>went</b> <b>along.</b> He came up with the partner character Maya because he thought it would be more fun for players to have another character with them, giving them advice, than investigating on their own.|$|E
5|$|Thompson {{was sworn}} in as the Masten District City Councilman on January 4, 2001 after being {{appointed}} by the Democratic Committee. His east side district included 27% of Buffalo's African American population. The Buffalo City Council had a brief African-American majority during Thompson's appointed half term that ended following the subsequent elections in September and November 2001. After African-Americans lost their majority the council voted along racial lines by a 76 margin to shrink the common council from thirteen to nine members by eliminating the four at-large positions (three of which were held by African-Americans). The city voters endorsed the proposal by a 35,84919,036 margin which largely <b>went</b> <b>along</b> racial lines. Thompson retained his council position in the 2001, 2003 and 2005 elections. Thompson served as a John Edwards delegate at the 2004 Democratic National Convention.|$|E

5|$|Bessières and Nansouty led {{these men}} forward, through {{a hail of}} cannonballs and case-shot, with the carabiniers-à-cheval at the front. Finding a weaker spot in the Austrian line, they pierced it and stormed past the enemy {{infantry}} formed in squares, sabering the Georger Grenzer battalion as they <b>went</b> <b>along</b> their way. However, many of the French cavalry did not manage to penetrate through the formidable masses of Austrian infantry, so Nansouty was now commanding a much diminished force. Showing great skill in handling his men, Nansouty then wheeled right and charged Liechtenstein's artillery line. However, the Austrian cavalry promptly intervened, spearheaded by the Rosenberg chevaulegers and the Kronprinz cuirassier regiments, which caught the carabiniers-à-cheval in flank and repulsed them, pursuing {{them back to their}} lines. The costly repulse of Nansouty's division did not dishearten Bessières, who was preparing another rapid charge, now with the support of elements of the Guard cavalry. This charge never came, as the Marshal's horse was killed by a cannonball, with Bessières also hit and carried unconscious behind the lines. With his commander presumed dead, Nansouty did not know what the Emperor's orders were and thus promptly decided to pull back his men, to avoid further damage to his already battered division.|$|E
5|$|Despite its {{disappointment}} with the award of Paris Tribunal of Arbitration, Venezuela abided by it. However, {{half a century}} later the publication of an alleged political deal between Russia and Britain led Venezuela to re-assert its claims. In 1949, the US jurist Otto Schoenrich gave the Venezuelan government the Memorandum of Severo Mallet-Prevost (Official Secretary of the U.S./Venezuela delegation in the Tribunal of Arbitration), written in 1944 to be published only after Mallet-Prevost's death. This re-opened the issues, with Mallet-Prevost surmising a political deal between Russia and Britain from the subsequent private behaviour of the judges. Mallet-Prevost said that Martens had visited England with the two British arbitrators in the summer of 1899, and subsequently had offered the two American judges a choice between accepting a unanimous award along the lines ultimately agreed, or a 3:2 majority opinion even more favourable to the British. The alternative would have followed the Schomburgk Line entirely, and given the mouth of the Orinoco to the British. Mallet-Prevost said that the American judges and Venezuelan counsel were disgusted at the situation and considered the 3:2 option with a strongly worded minority opinion, but ultimately <b>went</b> <b>along</b> with Martens in order to avoid depriving Venezuela of valuable territory to which it was entitled.|$|E
5|$|New Jersey Route 163 {{originated}} as an {{alignment of}} U.S. Route 46 (co-signed with New Jersey State Highway Route 6). The alignment of 6 and 46 <b>went</b> <b>along</b> the {{alignment of the}} original State Highway Route 5 from the early 1920s, stretching from Newark to the bridge over the Delaware River at Delaware. The route was decommissioned when the 1927 renumbering occurred. After that renumbering, the route became State Highway Route 6, a co-designation to U.S. Route 46, which had been assigned the prior year. The two highway designations remained intact until the 1953 renumbering, when Route 6 was decommissioned in favor of using the U.S. 46 designation. U.S. Route 46 was realigned once again when the Portland-Columbia Toll Bridge opened in 1953, when the alignment of the highway was changed to head along former State Highway Route 8 (mostly New Jersey Route 94), where it ended at U.S. Route 611 and NJ 94, where its current terminus is located. After the realigning of the Delaware Bridge alignment, the route was renumbered to New Jersey Route 163. Two years later, the Delaware Bridge was swept away in floods caused by Hurricane Connie and Diane in 1955, which took out several other bridges over the Delaware.|$|E
