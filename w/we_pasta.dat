To determine the proton fraction in the inner crust, numerical simulations are carried out {{for a variety of}} densities and proton fractions. We conclude [...] -as others have before us using different techniques [...] -that the proton fraction in the inner stellar crust is very small. Given that the purported "nuclear pasta" phase in stellar crusts develops {{as a consequence of the}} long-range Coulomb interaction among protons, <b>we</b> question whether <b>pasta</b> formation is possible in such proton-poor environments. To answer this question, we search for physical observables sensitive to the transition between spherical nuclei and exotic pasta structures. Of particular relevance is the static structure factor S(k) [...] -an observable sensitive to density fluctuations. However, no dramatic behavior was observed in S(k).

40|$|In {{supernova}} cores and {{neutron star}} crusts, nuclei {{are thought to}} deform to rodlike and slablike shapes, which are often called nuclear <b>pasta.</b> <b>We</b> study the equilibrium properties of the nuclear pasta by using a liquid drop model with curvature corrections. It is confirmed that the curvature effect acts to lower the transition densities between different shapes. We also examine the gyroid structure, which was recently suggested as {{a different type of}} nuclear pasta by analogy with the polymer systems. The gyroid structure investigated in this paper is approximately formulated {{as an extension of the}} periodic minimal surface whose mean curvature vanishes. In contrast to our expectations, we find from the present approximate formulation that the curvature corrections act to slightly disfavor the appearance of the gyroid structure. By comparing the energy corrections in the gyroid phase and the hypothetical phases composed of d-dimensional spheres, where d is a general dimensionality, we show that the gyroid is unlikely to belong to a family of the generalized dimensional spheres.

New methodTo test rodents for orofacial motor impairments in a stress-free environment, <b>we</b> established the <b>pasta</b> gnawing test by measuring the biting noise of mice that eat a piece of spaghetti. Two parameters were evaluated, the biting speed and the biting peaks per biting episode. To evaluate {{the power of this}} test compared to commonly used limb motor and muscle strength tests, three mouse models of Parkinson’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Niemann-Pick disease were tested in the pasta gnawing test, RotaRod and wire suspension test. ResultsOur results show that the pasta gnawing test reliably displays orofacial motor deficits. Comparison with existing methodsThe test is especially useful as additional motor test in early onset disease models, since it shows first deficits later than the RotaRod or wire suspension test. The test depends on a voluntary eating behavior of the animal with only a short-time food deprivation and should thus be stress-free. ConclusionsThe pasta gnawing test represents a valuable tool to analyze orofacial motor deficits in different early onset disease models...|$|R
40|$|The Mycobacterium {{tuberculosis}} Ser/Thr kinase PknB {{has been}} implicated in the regulation of cell growth and morphology in this organism. The extracytoplasmic domain of this membrane protein comprises four penicillin binding protein and Ser/Thr kinase associated (PASTA) domains, which are predicted to bind stem peptides of peptidoglycan. Using a comprehensive library of synthetic muropeptides, we demonstrate that the extracytoplasmic domain of PknB binds muropeptides in a manner dependent {{on the presence of}} specific amino acids at the second and third positions of the stem peptide, and on the presence of the sugar moiety N-acetylmuramic acid linked to the peptide. We further show that PknB localizes strongly to the mid-cell and also to the cell poles, and that the extracytoplasmic domain is required for PknB localization. In contrast to strong growth stimulation by conditioned medium, we observe no growth stimulation of M. tuberculosis by a synthetic muropeptide with high affinity for the PknB <b>PASTAs.</b> <b>We</b> do find a moderate effect of a high affinity peptide on resuscitation of dormant cells. While the PASTA domains of PknB {{may play a role in}} stimulating growth by binding exogenous peptidoglycan fragments, our data indicate that a major function of these domains is for proper PknB localization, likely through binding of peptidoglycan fragments produced locally at the mid-cell and the cell poles. These data suggest a model in which PknB is targeted to the sites of peptidoglycan turnover to regulate cell growth and cell division...|$|R
40|$|Pasta is {{a product}} with a long history, but is also still being {{developed}} today. Producers want to use new raw materials to make pasta more nutritious, less allergenic, and less dependent on durum wheat. All have in common that new raw materials shall not compromise the desired texture properties of cooked pasta such as the “al dente” feeling. To facilitate {{the development of new}} pasta products, understanding the microstructure of pasta can be a tool. Water transforms and interacts with the microstructure during cooking and the outcome determines the texture. The main objective of this work was to analyse the interplay of microstructure and water, and how this is affected by the choice of raw materials. We combined light microscopy and Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to study the microstructure and water distribution of <b>pasta.</b> <b>We</b> improved the resolution of MRI to yield data in 3 D and were able to link MRI data to microstructure components such as fibre particles and the extent of starch gelatinisation. Monitoring microstructure transformations during cooking and warm-holding of pasta revealed that some transformations are not dependent on the raw materials used. Water ingress towards the core is regulated by starch gelatinisation, which holds true both during cooking and warm-holding. The extent of the continuous starch and protein transformation from core to surface in cooked pasta is mainly governed by the product geometry. Also, texture changes during warm-holding depended mainly on the amount of available water within and around the pasta after cooking. Nevertheless, raw materials are of importance: A higher protein content limited the degree of starch swelling within the gelatinised region in cooked pasta. Fibre particles can hinder water migration locally due to their perpendicular alignment against the direction of water ingress. Bran particles in particular do not absorb water during cooking, but redistribute it around the particles and create a strong variation in the degree of starch swelling. The severity of this effect correlated with bran particle size. This thesis provides a comprehensive overview over how local microstructure and raw material choice affect water distribution at different scales in the cooked product. </p...|$|R
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. September 2013. Major: Nutrition. Advisor: Joanne Slavin. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xii, 111 pages. Satiety {{is a complex}} process influenced {{by a number of}} properties in food such as physical form, macronutrient content, visual appeal, taste, pleasantness, smell and aftertaste. From past research, we already know that the liquid form of food produces a weaker satiety response compared to the solid form of food. On the other hand, {{little is known about the}} effects of different types of solid food (i. e. solid food in the form of an energy bar vs. solid food as part of a meal) on satiety and subsequent energy intake. The following work describes two intervention studies designed to help explain the influence of various properties of food on satiety. In the first study, we hypothesized that a 10 g dose of oat bran fiber or a 10 g dose of barley bran fiber in a breakfast bar would enhance satiety more than a control bar with 3 g of wheat fiber. We also hypothesized that consumption of the oat bran bar or barley bran bar for breakfast would reduce energy intake at an ad libitum lunch more than the wheat fiber breakfast bar. Secondary outcomes were to determine if the oat and barley bran fiber bars had any effect on gastrointestinal tolerance and colonic fermentation. Finally, we sought to determine if any of the fiber bars differed in their palatability ratings. Healthy women (n= 42) participated in this randomized double-blind, crossover study comparing satiety after they consumed three different breakfast bars: one with barley bran fiber, one with oat bran fiber and a bar with low amounts of wheat fiber (control). Women used 100 mm visual analog scales (VAS) to rate satiety for 4 hours after breakfast bar consumption. Satiety did not significantly differ among treatments nor did energy intake, colonic fermentation, and gastrointestinal tolerance. In the second study, we hypothesized that a high protein pasta would increase satiety and decrease mid-afternoon snacking more than a high fiber pasta or a control. We also investigated whether or not the added ingredients to the pasta would have any effect on gastrointestinal tolerance, food intake and palatability. Healthy men (n= 18) and healthy women (n= 18) participated in this randomized double-blind crossover study. Subjects consumed three different pastas (high protein, high fiber, or control) for lunch at noon and proceeded to rate satiety with VAS over a three-hour period. Ad libitum snacking was assessed at 3 : 00 pm and subjects rated any gastrointestinal symptoms and their food intake for the remainder of the evening. Once again, satiety did not significantly differ among the treatments, nor did gastrointestinal tolerance. A gender-treatment interaction was observed for food intake and men consumed significantly more calories after the high protein pasta compared to the high fiber and control <b>pasta.</b> <b>We</b> also found differences in palatability among the pastas, which suggests that hedonic properties of food may influence satiety ratings and subsequent food intake. The results from these two studies do not support a connection between the consumption of whole foods and satiety. Changing the satiating properties of whole foods by adding more protein or fiber was a limitation in both studies because it affected our palatability ratings. Other limitations that may have contributed to these null results are a short intervention time and too small a dose of fiber and protein...|$|R
