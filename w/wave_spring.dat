5000|$|<b>Wave</b> <b>spring</b> - {{the name}} applies to a {{multitude}} of wave shaped springs, washers and expanders, including linear springs, {{all of which are}} generally made with flat wire or discs which are marcelled according to industrial terms, usually by die-stamping, into a wavy regular pattern resulting in curvilinear lobes. Round wire wave springs exist as well. Types include : wave washer, single turn <b>wave</b> <b>spring,</b> multi-turn <b>wave</b> <b>spring,</b> linear <b>wave</b> <b>spring,</b> marcel expander, interlaced <b>wave</b> <b>spring</b> and nested <b>wave</b> <b>spring</b> amongst others.|$|E

50|$|A <b>wave</b> <b>spring,</b> {{also known}} as coiled <b>wave</b> <b>spring</b> or scrowave spring, is a spring made up of pre-hardened flat wire in a process called on-edge coiling ({{also known as}} edge-winding).

40|$|An {{analytical}} model for stamped ring <b>wave</b> <b>springs</b> is proposed, {{based on the}} theory for circular beams loaded normal to the plane of curvature. The model profits from the adoption of Castigliano's theorem {{as a tool for}} mathematical treatment. Closed-form expressions for both load—deflection and load—stress relationships are presented. Because of the particular shape of the spring in the undeformed configuration, the load—deflection curve is found to be appreciably bilinear in character. A similar but less pronounced behaviour is displayed also by the relationship between load and internal stresses. The analytical results are compared to earlier theoretical findings and are shown to correlate well with experimental measurements...|$|R

Galazi heard the thunder of their rush; he looked round, and as he looked, lo! the Slaughterer swept past him, running like a buck. Then Galazi, too, bounded forward, and the Wolf-Brethren sped down the hill, the length of four spears between them.|$|R

40|$|The {{combustor}} in the 8 -foot {{high temperature}} structures tunnel at the NASA-Langley Research Center has encountered cracking {{over a period}} of 50 - 250 tunnel tests within a limited range of the required operating envelope. A program was conducted which analyzed the failed combustor liner hardware and determined that the mechanism of failure was vibratory fatigue. A vibration damper system using <b>wave</b> <b>springs</b> located axially between the liner T-bar and the liner support was designed as an intermediate solution to extend the life of the current two-pass regenerative air-cooled liner. The effects of liner wall thickness, cooling air passage height, stiffener ring geometry, reflective coatings, and liner material selection were investigated for these designs. Preliminary layout design arrangements including the external water-cooling system requirements, weight estimates, installation requirements and preliminary estimates of manufacturing costs were prepared for the most promissing configurations. A state-of-the-art review of thermal barrier coatings and an evaluation of reflective coatings for the gasside surface of air-cooled liners are included...|$|R

Compared with nested wave springs, crest-to-crest wave springs have lower damping and a larger range for the linear stiffness due to a reduced level of contact. Dynamic compressive tests, subject to different static compression levels, are carried out to investigate the force-displacement hysteresis of individual wave springs. The stiffness is shown to increase up to 800...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} an improved experimental equation for representing <b>wave</b> <b>spring</b> behaviors. Wave springs were widely used for automobile automatic transmission {{and have to}} be precisely controlled. In fact an experimental equation was provided by mechanical design handbook. However the accuracy of the equation is not suitable. Therefore we tried to optimally modify correction factor K used in the equation without modifying the whole equation. For this different models of springs were manufactured to test and simulate. Theses results were analyzed and redefined correction factor K. To evaluate the proposed approach modified correction factor K was applied into various models and good agreement was obtained...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} merits of shape memory wave springs as {{powering}} elements of solid state actuators. Advantages and disadvantages of the wave construction {{in comparison to the}} traditional helical shape are presented and discussed by means of dimensionless functions. The main assets of the wave springs are the higher electrical resistance (leading to simpler electrical drives) and the lower cooling time (leading to enhanced working frequency). The wave geometry is also superior in purely mechanical terms to the helical counterpart when axial space is at a premium. A step-by-step design procedure is proposed, leading to the optimal <b>wave</b> <b>spring</b> meeting the multiphysics design specifications and constraints. A case study is finally reported, showing the application of shape memory wave springs to the design of a telescopic linear actuator...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWave springs are precise {{flat wire}} {{compression}} springs that fit into assemblies that other springs cannot since the overall lengths and operating heights of Wave springs {{are lower than}} those of conventional round Wire springs, they will often reduce the size of an assembly by as much as 50 %. Of course, this will also reduce the part weight and raw material cost of every spring produced. Wave springs operate as load bearing devices. They take up play and compensate for dimensional variations within assemblies. A virtually unlimited range of forces can be produced whereby loads build either gradually or abruptly to reach a predetermined working height. This establishes a precise spring rate in which load is proportional to deflection. Functional requirements are necessary for both dynamic and static spring applications. Special performance characteristics are individually built into each spring to satisfy a variety of precise operating conditions. Typically, a <b>wave</b> <b>spring</b> will occupy an externally small area for the amount of work it performs. The use of this product is demanded, but not limited to tight axial and radial space constraints. In this paper, a three dimensional finite element (FE) model for shock absorber spring is proposed. The present work deals the structural analysis for modelling the structural behaviour of wave springs. The design of spring in suspension system is very important. In this work a wave type of spring is designed and a 3 D model is created using Pro/Engineer. The model is also changed by changing the length of the spring. Structural analysis has been conducted on the <b>wave</b> <b>spring</b> by varying the spring material such as Structural steel and Beryllium Copper. For this analysis, loads are considered as bike weight, single person and two persons. Structural analysis is done to validate the strength. The present study makes an attempt to compare the results for selecting best material for springs...|$|E
