25|$|Mercati {{posed the}} {{question}} to himself, <b>why</b> <b>would</b> <b>anyone</b> prefer to manufacture artifacts of stone rather than of metal, a superior material? His answer was that metallurgy was unknown at that time. He cited Biblical passages to prove that in Biblical times stone was the first material used. He also revived the 3-age system of Lucretius, which described a succession of periods based {{on the use of}} stone (and wood), bronze and iron respectively. Due to lateness of publication, Mercati's ideas were already being developed independently; however, his writing served as a further stimulus.|$|E
500|$|The Terrible Towel is {{traditionally}} {{known as the}} first [...] "rally towel"; its popularity has spawned similar traditions for other teams. Fans of the Minnesota Twins cheer {{the team with the}} [...] "Homer Hanky" [...] during the playoffs. The Philadelphia Phillies have distributed white towels to fans during home games. During a 2006 playoff game against the Steelers, the Indianapolis Colts handed out blue towels to rally fans, however, Pittsburgh {{went on to win the}} game. In a 2000 preseason game, played in Mexico City, many fans that filled the 100,000 seat Aztec Stadium waved towels. Cope, glad that the Allegheny Valley School would receive a sizable donation from the proceeds, was later disappointed to learn the towels waved by the fans were [...] "knockoffs" [...] made by local artists, and therefore no proceeds would go to the school. In 2008, the NFL approved a white towel entitled the Trophy Towel, which will be sold to fans and given to the winning team of Super Bowl XLIII. Members of the Steelers criticized the idea, broadcaster Bill Hillgrove—who worked with Cope—called the idea [...] "a cheap imitation." [...] Steelers player Aaron Smith stated, [...] "It started here, so <b>why</b> <b>would</b> <b>anyone</b> else want to have a towel? Why not kazoos?" [...] During the 2010 Memorial Cup the host committee made up 8,000 yellow towels to represent the host team, the Brandon Wheat Kings, who played the Moncton Wildcats. Many fans brought the towels back for games after that. [...] Waving white rally towels has the unfortunate distinction of resembling surrender by waving a white flag (citation needed).|$|E
