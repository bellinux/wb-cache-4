25|$|It is the {{reasoned}} {{conclusion of}} this study... that the sense of guilt created by the Vietnam war {{in the minds of}} many Americans is not warranted and that the charges of officially, condoned illegal and grossly immoral conduct are without substance. Indeed, detailed examination of battlefield practices reveals that the loss civilian life in Vietnam was less great than in World War II and Korea and that concern with minimizing the ravages of the war was strong. To measure and compare the devastation and loss of human life caused by different <b>war</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> objectionable to those who repudiate all resort to military force as an instrument of foreign policy and may be construed as callousness. Yet as long as wars do take place at all it remains a moral duty to seek to reduce the agony caused by war, and the fulfillment of this obligation should not be disdained. I hope that this book may help demonstrate that moral convictions are not the exclusive possession of persons in conscience opposed to war, and that those who in certain circumstances accept the necessity and ethical justification of armed conflict also do care about human suffering.|$|E
500|$|At {{the start}} of the season, the Australian Board of Control had issued a {{directive}} calling on the umpires to [...] "get tough" [...] in enforcing the laws of cricket, and asked the state associations to [...] "back the umpires to the fullest extent". In the lead-up to the Test, Meckiff was the centre of media attention, and one report described him as cricket's [...] "bogey man". The South Africans were reportedly stunned by Meckiff's selection, giving the impression that they considered him an illegitimate bowler. Reaction in England was also hostile, ahead of Australia's forthcoming tour in the English summer of 1964. Colin Ingleby-Mackenzie wrote in the News of the World: [...] "there is no room in cricket for throwers. Let us hope that...the Australian selectors realise this...otherwise the throwing <b>war</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> waged in earnest".|$|E
500|$|This {{idea was}} not new, since William H. Seward, the former Secretary of State under the administrations of various presidents, among them Abraham Lincoln and Ulysses Grant, had {{stressed}} that a canal be built either in Honduras, Nicaragua or Panama {{and that the}} United States annex the Dominican Republic and purchase Puerto Rico and Cuba. The idea of annexing the Dominican Republic failed to receive {{the approval of the}} U.S. Senate and Spain did not accept the 160 million dollars which the U.S. offered for Puerto Rico and Cuba. Mahan made the following statement to the War Department: [...] "Having therefore no foreign establishments either colonial or military, the ships of war of the United States, in <b>war</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> like land birds, unable to fly far from their own shores. To provide resting places for them where they can coal and repair, {{would be one of the}} first duties of a government proposing to itself the development of the power of the nation at sea." ...|$|E

500|$|Johnson {{called his}} U.S.-based {{advisers}} to his Texas ranch for discussions on Christmas Day. Secretary of State Dean Rusk and Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara advised Johnson to reject Taylor's proposal. Johnson declined to act, stating that an escalation during the Christmas period would be inappropriate, {{as it would}} damage public morale. He also noted {{that because of the}} political instability in Saigon, the international community and the American public were unlikely to believe that the Vietcong were behind the attack, feeling that they would instead blame local infighting for the bombing. This was {{despite the fact that the}} Vietcong had already claimed responsibility. Johnson administration officials concluded four days after the bombing that the Vietcong were responsible. Johnson believed that it was too late to retaliate and that any action taken more than 36 hours after the event constituted unprovoked aggression. The State Department cabled Taylor and the embassy, saying that [...] "In view of the overall confusion in Saigon", public U.S. and international opinion towards an American air strike would be that the Johnson administration was [...] "trying to shoot its way out of an internal [...] political crisis". Johnson said to Taylor that [...] "Every time I get a military recommendation it seems to me that it calls for large-scale bombing. I have never felt that this <b>war</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> won from the air." [...] At the time, Johnson was reluctant to accede to his officials' calls for large-scale bombing of North Vietnam, a strategy that eventually became policy.|$|E

2500|$|The {{writings}} {{attributed to}} the Biblical prophets exhort all people to lead a righteous life. Kindness to the needy, benevolence, faith, compassion for the suffering, a peace-loving disposition, and a truly humble and contrite spirit, are the virtues which the Prophets hold up for emulation.

[...] "Learn to do good" [...] is the keynote of the prophetic appeal (Isa. 1:17); thus the end-time {{will be one of}} peace and righteousness; <b>war</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> no more (Isa. 2:2 et seq.).|$|E

2500|$|When he was {{a visible}} figure working against the rise of Nazism, Einstein had sought help and {{developed}} working relationships in both the West and {{what was to become}} the Soviet bloc. After World War II, enmity between the former allies became a very serious issue for people with international résumés. To make things worse, during the first days of McCarthyism Einstein was writing about a single world government; it was at this time that he wrote, [...] "I do not know how the third World <b>War</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> fought, but I can tell you what they will use in the Fourth— sticks and stones." [...] In a 1949 Monthly Review article entitled [...] "Why Socialism?" [...] Albert Einstein described a chaotic capitalist society, a source of evil to be overcome, as the [...] "predatory phase of human development" [...] With Albert Schweitzer and Bertrand Russell, Einstein lobbied to stop nuclear testing and future bombs. Days before his death, Einstein signed the Russell-Einstein Manifesto, which led to the Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs.|$|E
2500|$|Mrs. Ann Bowles and Mrs. Clara Phelps are Mildred's {{friends and}} {{representative}} of the anti-intellectual, hedonistic society presented in the novel. During a social visit to Montag's house, they brag about ignoring the bad things {{in their lives and}} have a cavalier attitude towards the upcoming war, their husbands, their children, and politics. Mrs. Phelps' husband Pete was called in to fight in the upcoming war (and believes that he'll be back in a week because of how quick the <b>war</b> <b>will</b> <b>be)</b> and thinks having children serves no purpose other than to ruin lives. Mrs. Bowles is a thrice married, single mother. Her first husband divorced her, her second died in a jet accident, and her third committed suicide by shooting himself in the head. She has two children who do not like or respect her due to her permissive, often negligent and abusive parenting; Mrs. Bowles brags that her kids beat her up, and she's glad she can hit back. When Montag reads Dover Beach to them, he strikes a chord in Mrs. Phelps, who starts crying over how hollow her life is.
