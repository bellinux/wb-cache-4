When {{the boys were}} six, they started school: King had to attend a school for African Americans and the other boy went to one for whites (public schools were among the facilities segregated by state law). King lost his friend because the child's father no longer wanted the boys to play together.|$|E

25|$|Previously, the Syrian plains {{were not}} {{considered}} as the homeland of Halaf culture, and the Halafians were seen either as hill people who descended from the nearby mountains of southeastern Anatolia, or herdsmen from northern Iraq. However, those views changed with the recent archaeology conducted since 1986 by Peter Akkermans, which have produced new insights and perspectives about the rise of Halaf culture. A formerly unknown transitional culture between the pre-Halaf Neolithic's era and Halaf's era was uncovered in the Balikh valley, at Tell Sabi Abyad (the Mound of the <b>White</b> <b>Boy).</b>|$|E
25|$|There {{were three}} or four camps {{under the name of}} Camp Farouk at that time in Afghanistan. I {{attended}} the open mainstream camp, not terrorist camps.

How would a <b>white</b> <b>boy</b> new to Islam, not understanding local customs or languages, largely uneducated in the ways of the world, get access to such supposedly secret camps planning acts of terror? The camps I attended were not al-Qaeda. I did not hear about such an organisation until my arrival in Guantanamo Bay.|$|E

25|$|On January 10, 1840, {{after several}} years of war and a major {{smallpox}} epidemic, three Comanche emissaries entered San Antonio and asked for peace, offering to send a large contingent of their leaders in 23 days to secure a new peace. They returned a <b>white</b> <b>boy</b> as a show of sincerity. Colonel Karnes received them, listened to their story, and agreed, but admonished them by saying that a lasting peace could be negotiated only when the Comanches gave up the Anglo captives that they held, estimated at thirteen. Albert Sidney Johnston, the Texas Secretary of War, had ordered San Antonio officials to take the Comanche delegates as hostages if they failed to deliver all captives. In March, Muguara, a powerful eastern Comanche chief, led 65 Comanches, including women and children, to San Antonio for peace talks.|$|E

[...] Infinite achieved very little commercial success and was largely ignored by Detroit radio stations. [...] The disappointment from this experience greatly influenced his lyrical style: [...] "After that record, every rhyme I wrote got angrier and angrier.

500|$|The Slim Shady LP was {{recorded}} at Studio 8 at 430 8 Mile Road in Ferndale, Michigan. [...] Eminem, who had idolized Dr. Dre since {{listening to his}} group N.W.A as a teenager, was nervous {{to work with him}} on the album: [...] "I didn't want to be starstruck or kiss his ass too much... I'm just a little <b>white</b> <b>boy</b> from Detroit. I had never seen stars, let alone Dr. Dre." [...] However, Eminem became more comfortable working with Dr. Dre after a series of highly productive recording sessions. [...] The recording process generally began with Dr. Dre creating a beat and Eminem using the tracks as a template for his freestyle raps; [...] "Every beat he would make, I had a rhyme for", Eminem recalled. He later said: [...] "Every time I sat down with a pen, everything was just like: fuck you, fuck this, fuck them, fuck that, fuck the world, fuck what everybody thinks. Fuck them." [...] " [...] On the first day of recording, Eminem and Dr. Dre finished [...] "My Name Is" [...] in an hour. [...] Three other songs, including [...] "Role Model", were also recorded that day.|$|E

Gonzalez and Benigno both gave it an [...] "A", and the latter explained: [...] "the {{arrangement}} ... gives the track a wonderful, spontaneous feel", and [...] "this nerdy <b>white</b> <b>boy</b> has himself some soul." [...] Kubicek dissented, and explained that Artie getting emotional in song two weeks in a row [...] "is a tad boring". While most reviewers disliked [...] "Friday" [...] in the original, Rebecca Black version, the commentary for the prom incarnation sung by Puck, Sam and Artie was generally positive despite this—Gonzalez said she hated herself [...] "for giving this horrendously addictive version of a horrendous song a B." [...] VanDerWerff said the song was [...] "way, way, way too long, though it was more fun than [...] expected it to be", Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal called it [...] "darn good and infectious", and Mullins said it was [...] "much catchier than the original".

Once arrived at the mansion party, she is first seen dancing atop a big, wooden table. In the continuation of the video, Cyrus dances with multiple people on the dance floor. Cut-scenes feature Cyrus in all prior scenes or dancing with others in the mansion's study. The video concludes with Cyrus back in her bedroom, once again waking up.|$|E
