In 2010, the organization reported saving 81.8% of the animals leaving its custody, while 50 healthy or treatable animals <b>were</b> <b>euthanized.</b> These numbers <b>were</b> a significant improvement over a 65% save rate in 2009, when 301 animals <b>were</b> <b>euthanized</b> for space. In 2012, the organization reported saving 91.2% of animals leaving its custody, although 12 healthy or treatable animals <b>were</b> <b>euthanized.</b> In 2013, 20 animals <b>were</b> <b>euthanized,</b> while in 2014, 102 animals <b>were</b> <b>euthanized.</b>|$|R

40|$|Dantrolene {{has been}} shown to be neuroprotective by {{reducing}} neuronal apoptosis after brain injury in several animal models of neurological disorders. In this study, we investigated the effects of dantrolene on experimental spinal cord injury (SCI). Forty-six male Wistar rats were laminectomized at T 13 and divided in six groups: GI (n = 7) underwent SCI with placebo and <b>was</b> <b>euthanized</b> after 32 h; GII (n = 7) underwent laminectomy alone with placebo and <b>was</b> <b>euthanized</b> after 32 h; GIII (n = 8) underwent SCI with dantrolene and <b>was</b> <b>euthanized</b> after 32 h; GIV (n = 8) underwent SCI with placebo and <b>was</b> <b>euthanized</b> after 8 days; GV (n = 8) underwent laminectomy alone with placebo and <b>was</b> <b>euthanized</b> after 8 days; and GVI (n = 8) underwent SCI with dantrolene and <b>was</b> <b>euthanized</b> after 8 days. A compressive trauma was performed to induce SCI. After euthanasia, the spinal cord was evaluated using light microscopy, TUNEL staining and immunochemistry with anti-Caspase- 3 and anti-NeuN. Animals treated with dantrolene showed a smaller number of TUNEL-positive and caspase- 3 -positive cells and a larger number of NeuN-positive neurons, both at 32 h and 8 days (P ≤ 0. 05). These results showed that dantrolene protects spinal cord tissue after traumatic SCI by decreasing apoptotic cell death...|$|R

40|$|Stranding patterns, {{clinical}} and pathological records were analysed for harbour seals (Phoca vitulina vitulina) {{submitted to the}} rehabilitation centre Ecomare between 2009 and 2013. Of 38 seals that died or <b>were</b> <b>euthanized</b> stranding patterns, clinical records an pathological findings were analysed. Of 38 seals that were released the stranding patterns and clinical records were evaluated. A comparison between these two groups were also conducted. Most strandings of seals that died or <b>were</b> <b>euthanized</b> occurred {{during the winter months}} January and December (60. 5 %). The stranding locations were limited to Texel (47. 4 %) and North-Holland (52. 6 %) because this is the region covered by Ecomare. The seals that died or <b>were</b> <b>euthanized</b> (n= 38) <b>were</b> all juveniles, 57. 9 % was male and 42. 1 % was female. The seals that were released show a significantly (P= 0. 045) higher bodyweight upon submission than the seals that died or <b>were</b> <b>euthanized.</b> The seals of both groups first lost weight before regaining weight after approximately 2 weeks in the rehabilitation centre. The most common clinical findings of the seals that died or <b>were</b> <b>euthanized,</b> <b>were</b> elevated intensity of breathing sounds (47. 4 %), dyspnoea (42. 1 %) and coughing (34. 2 %). The most common clinical findings of the seals that were released, were elevated intensity of breathing sounds (76. 3 %), diarrhoea (34. 2 %) and wounds of the skin (28. 9 %). The treatment administered was mostly the same for both groups. The most common pathological findings of the seals that died or <b>were</b> <b>euthanized</b> <b>were</b> bronchopneumonia (86. 8 %), nematodiriasis in the bronchial tree (76. 3 %) and intestinal parasites (42. 1 %). The most common causes of death or underlying disease in case of euthanasia were parasitic bronchopneumonia (57. 9 %) and cachexia/emaciation of undetermined cause (28. 9 %). Respiratory signs were the main clinical signs of the seals submitted to the rehabilitation centre. Respiratory problems were the main reason for the seals to die or <b>be</b> <b>euthanized</b> as well. Intestinal problems did occur, however these were not a reason for the seals to die or <b>be</b> <b>euthanized...</b>|$|R
