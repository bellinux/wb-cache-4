25|$|There {{are also}} various niche styles, {{such as the}} Egg, a longboard-style short board {{targeted}} for people who <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ride</b> a shortboard but need more paddle power. The Fish, a board which is typically shorter, flatter, and wider than a normal shortboard, often with a split tail (known as a swallow tail). The Fish often has two or four fins and is specifically designed for surfing smaller waves. For big waves there is the Gun, a long, thick board with a pointed nose and tail (known as a pin tail) specifically designed for big waves.|$|E
25|$|Many of the {{facilities}} and services provided on the ride are contributed by around 400 volunteers each year. Volunteers include those {{with family and friends}} doing the ride but who do not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ride</b> themselves, former riders no longer able to participate, and many who simply enjoy the atmosphere of the ride. Some of the volunteers also participate in the ride itself. Volunteer positions include catering services, medical services, luggage handlers, route marshals, information and media services, sign production, sag wagon, Warby team, cleaning services, tent set-up, and campsite services. A total of thirty-five different volunteer teams operate on the ride. Often volunteers will be under the guidance of paid employees, or assisting paid independent contractors in providing a service. Without the level of support provided by volunteer labour the cost of ride would become prohibitively expensive for many riders.|$|E
25|$|Mary was 19 {{when she}} was {{attacked}} and lived at East Hooks Courts in Hooks, Texas. She had just been on a double date at the movies with Jimmy's brother, Bob, and his girlfriend. On the way home, Bob and his date did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ride</b> {{all the way to}} her house, so they were dropped off. Hollis and Larey then headed to the lovers' lane just off of Richmond, where the attack occurred. She was beaten and sexually assaulted with the perpetrator's pistol. She suffered a head wound which was stitched up at the hospital. Afterwards, she had nightly nightmares about her attacker. She then moved to Frederick, Oklahoma to live with her aunt and uncle, Mr. and Mrs. Paul Long. Her aunt said {{that for the first time}} in Mary's life she was extremely nervous and would not go upstairs by herself or sleep alone.|$|E

500|$|Arthur Levine from About.com was {{disappointed}} that Universal had not tried to re-create the magical aspect of guests entering Platform , [...] "When it's time {{to make their own}} way to the platform, however, it appears to would-be wizards that they are merely entering a darkened corridor. Aside from an audible [...] "whoosh" [...] sound, there is, regrettably, no attempt to reproduce the magical, molecule-shifting phenomenon." [...] He also found it awkward that the Hogwarts Express reverses into Platform [...] at King's Cross—although in Hogsmeade the train arrives facing forwards. Overall Levine said that the attraction does more than just making it a ride, [...] "By making it an integral and compelling part of The Wizarding World, most guests would <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ride</b> it to get the complete Potter experience. By making it an inter-park ride and requiring a two-park ticket to board it, Universal will surely help up-sell a lot more more customers to higher-priced passes, encourage multi-day visits, increase demand for its on-property hotels, and drive business at its CityWalk dining/shopping/entertainment district".|$|E
2500|$|Gretzky did {{not comment}} on that at the time; however, years later in his {{autobiography}} he reiterated that Bossy was a great player, but [...] "I sure wouldn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ride</b> in a cab with that guy." ...|$|E

60|$|From {{that day}} {{there was a}} change in Diane Sampson. She became feverishly active. She <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ride,</b> <b>to</b> see for herself {{what was going on}} in Linrock, to learn of that wild Pecos county life at first hand.|$|R

6000|$|... 'I don't {{like him}} a bit. He gives himself airs {{because he is}} a lord, and is devilish ill-natured. I don't know why he should <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ride</b> my horses.' ...|$|E

5|$|The queue {{before the}} Harry Potter {{refurbishment}} was set as a ruined castle where the Fire and Ice dragons lived. The queue passed through dungeons and included human skeletons, torches, and cobwebs. Just like the present queue, <b>to</b> <b>ride</b> Fire, guests would go left while riders <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>ride</b> Ice would go {{right at the}} intersection point.|$|R
6000|$|... "Frank, what'll we {{do about}} horses?" [...] asked Jones. [...] "Jim'll want the bay, and of course you'll <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ride</b> Spot. The rest of our nags will only do to pack the outfit." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Anna had got it {{into her}} head that you would <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ride</b> after the hounds this morning," [...] said Rex, whose secret {{associations}} with Anna's words made this speech seem quite perilously near the most momentous of subjects.|$|E
6000|$|... '"Turn {{and turn}} about is fair play", {{as we used}} to say when we all <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ride</b> on Ellen Tree or wear the russet boots,' said Jo briskly; 'so you must share your girl between you, and see who will do the most for her.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Five for baggage, {{and three}} for riding. I {{have no doubt}} Dias's wife will ride behind him, and the boy, when he <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>ride,</b> will perch himself {{on one of the}} baggage mules.

6000|$|Hetty smiled. [...] "I {{called him}} my partner when I was home. Larry held {{me on my}} first pony, and has done 'most {{whatever}} I wanted him ever since.

6000|$|... "It was not bad to-day. The hounds {{never left}} their scent after they found him. I think our hillsides carry the scent better than our grasses. If you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ride,</b> of course, it's rough. But {{if you like}} hunting, and don't mind a scramble, perhaps you may see it here as well as elsewhere." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Father, {{here is a}} great {{whirling}} machine, with {{ships and}} horses going round and round. Carlos and I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ride</b> on it.

60|$|That {{the white}} {{stallion}} gained was {{as sure as}} his resolve to elude capture, and he never swerved a foot from his course.
