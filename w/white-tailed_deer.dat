5|$|The creek is {{approved}} trout waters. Brown trout {{have been recorded}} to naturally reproduce in the creek. On {{the banks of the}} stream, populations of <b>white-tailed</b> <b>deer</b> are overabundant.|$|E
5|$|The fruit {{bodies are}} {{frequently}} attacked by slugs, {{which may be}} important agents in the dispersal of its spores. <b>White-tailed</b> <b>deer</b> are also known to consume the fungus.|$|E
5|$|<b>White-tailed</b> <b>deer</b> {{and other}} prey mammals flag with {{conspicuous}} (often black and white) tail markings when alarmed, informing the predator {{that it has}} been detected.|$|E
25|$|<b>White-tailed</b> (Virginia) <b>deer</b> are {{in nearly}} all counties. The {{northern}} mockingbird and brown thrasher are among the 160 bird species {{that live in the}} state.|$|R
50|$|Ponderosa {{pine and}} douglas-fir are the {{predominant}} tree {{species in the}} Little Belts, and wildlife includes black bear, elk, and <b>white-tailed</b> and mule <b>deer.</b>|$|R
50|$|Chorrera people fished and hunted as well, {{catching}} game such as armadillo, <b>deer</b> (including <b>white-tailed</b> and brocket <b>deer)</b> duck, frogs, lizards, peccary, {{and various}} rodents.|$|R
5|$|The park also attracts city {{dwelling}} mammals such as squirrels, rabbits, raccoons, muskrats, opossums, and {{the occasional}} coyote and <b>white-tailed</b> <b>deer.</b> Beaver sign indicates that there are beaver on the lake currently.|$|E
5|$|Birds in the Buffalo Creek {{watershed}} include raptors, waterfowl, songbirds, {{and wild}} turkeys. Mammals in the watershed include rodents, foxes, raccoons, opossums, skunks, <b>white-tailed</b> <b>deer,</b> and black bears. The colder streams in the watershed contain brook trout and brown trout, while the warmer streams contain suckers and smallmouth bass.|$|E
5|$|Hunting is {{permitted}} {{in most of}} Black Moshannon State Park. It helps to prevent an overpopulation of animals and the resulting overbrowsing of the understory. The most common game species are ruffed grouse, eastern gray squirrel, wild turkey, and <b>white-tailed</b> <b>deer.</b> However, the hunting of groundhogs is prohibited.|$|E
5000|$|Heckscher State Park {{is known}} as the [...] "Home of the <b>White-tailed</b> Deer", as <b>deer</b> are fairly populous {{throughout}} the park. Additionally, about 280 bird species can be observed in the park.|$|R
2500|$|Just as the {{evolutionary}} arms race {{has led to}} the development of pursuit behavior of predators, so too has it led to the anti-predator adaptations of prey. Alarm displays such as eastern swamphen's tail flicking, <b>white-tailed</b> <b>deer's</b> tail flagging, and [...] Thomson's gazelles' stotting have been observed deterring pursuit. These tactic are believed to signal that a predator's presence is known and, therefore, pursuit will be much more difficult. These displays are more frequent when predators are at an intermediate distance away. Alarm displays are used more often when prey believe predators are more prone to change their decision to pursue. For instance, cheetahs, common predators of Thomson's gazelles, are less likely to change their choice to pursue. As such, gazelles stott less when cheetahs are present than when other predators are present. In addition to behavioral adaptations, there are also morphological anti-predator adaptations to pursuit predators. For example, many birds have evolved rump feathers that fall off with much less force than the feathers of their other body parts. This allows for easier escape from predator birds, as avian predators often approach prey from their rump.|$|R
5000|$|The {{mountains}} in this forest provide wildlife habitat for timber wolf, raccoon, moose, black bear, coyote, cougar, elk, {{two species of}} fox, bald eagle, pika, beaver, flammulated owl, pine marten, <b>white-tailed</b> and mule <b>deer,</b> muskrat, river otter, peregrine falcon, mink, marmot, fisher, and mountain goat.|$|R
5|$|More {{than ten}} species of mammals have been {{observed}} in the park, several of them endangered, including the colocolo, the Andean mountain cat, the spectacled bear, the taruca deer, the vicuña, the <b>white-tailed</b> <b>deer,</b> the puma, the northern viscacha, the long-tailed weasel, the hog-nosed skunk and the Andean fox.|$|E
5|$|Pettigrew State Park also {{provides}} habitats for eastern woodland mammals. Black bear and <b>white-tailed</b> <b>deer</b> inhabit the woods, as do Virginia opossum, raccoon, American mink, muskrat, North American river otter, fox, and bobcats. The endangered red wolf has been reintroduced to eastern North Carolina, including Pettigrew State Park.|$|E
5|$|About 10 to 20 <b>white-tailed</b> <b>deer</b> {{per square}} mile (2.6 to 5.2 deer per square kilometer) live along {{the river and the}} parkway, more than the {{ecosystem}} can carry. They eat low-lying plants, shrubs, and tree saplings, reducing the food supply for smaller animals. The deer also collide with cars—in Hastings, about 1.6 times per month.|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} funded by The Samuel Roberts Noble Foundation, Inc., and the Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Aquaculture at Mississippi State University. Predators can {{influence}} populations through top-down effects, but most large predators have been extirpated from the <b>white-tailed</b> <b>deer’s</b> (Odocoileus virginianus) range. Hunters have filled this predatory role, but also can indirectly influence prey species. Indirect behavioral responses can include altered resource selection, space use, or movement patterns. Herein, we developed a controlled study that contained both temporal and spatial risk levels to assess how deer behavior changes in space relative to temporal periods of risk. Total distance travelled (m) and micro-range area (m²) were calculated over two-day periods to determine the general effects of hunting season on deer spatial behavior. Generally, distance travelled, micro-range area, and exploratory behavior decreased {{during the course of}} the study, with the greatest decrease occurring during the active 16 -day hunting period. Despite potential risk and disturbance from hunters, deer maintained site fidelity to previously established ranges and did not expand micro-range areas. These data indicate that deer recognize threats from humans on the landscape and adapt behavioral strategies by minimizing movement and exhibiting high residency times in well-established ranges, factors known to influence harvest susceptibility. This information can be used to assess potential impacts from hunting for management purposes, but also to test the adaptive ability of animals to risk. Publisher PDFPeer reviewe...|$|R
5000|$|The North Fork of the Clearwater and the Lochsa rivers provide {{miles of}} {{tumbling}} white water interspersed with quiet pools for migratory and resident fish. The mountains provide wildlife habitat for raccoon, elk, moose, black bear, {{two species of}} fox, bald eagle, marten, <b>white-tailed</b> and mule <b>deer,</b> coyote, timber wolf, cougar, boreal owl, river otter, muskrat, beaver, pika, fisher, mink, and mountain goat.|$|R
50|$|Bighorn {{sheep and}} {{mountain}} goats are already {{present in the}} surrounding mountainous areas and therefore should not pose a problem in rewilding more mountainous areas. Reintroducing extant species of deer to the more forested areas of the region would be beneficial for the ecosystems they occupy, providing rich nutrients for the forested regions and helping to maintain them. These species include <b>white-tailed</b> and mule <b>deer.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{red maple}} is a {{used as a}} food source by several forms of wildlife. Elk and <b>white-tailed</b> <b>deer</b> in {{particular}} use the current season's growth of red maple as {{an important source of}} winter food. Several Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) utilize the leaves as food; see List of Lepidoptera that feed on maples.|$|E
5|$|Trillium grandiflorum as well {{as other}} trilliums are a favored food of <b>white-tailed</b> <b>deer.</b> Indeed, if trilliums are {{available}} deer will seek these plants, with a preference for T. grandiflorum, to the exclusion of others. In the course of normal browsing, deer consume larger individuals, leaving shorter ones behind. This information can be used to assess deer density and its effect on understory growth in general.|$|E
5|$|Yellowstone {{is widely}} {{considered}} to be the finest megafauna wildlife habitat in the lower 48 states. There are almost 60 species of mammals in the park, including the gray wolf, coyote, the threatened Canadian lynx, and grizzly bears. Other large mammals include the bison (often referred to as buffalo), black bear, elk, moose, mule deer, <b>white-tailed</b> <b>deer,</b> mountain goat, pronghorn, bighorn sheep, and cougar.|$|E
50|$|The Arizona {{white oak}} is very {{important}} to livestock and wildlife because the acorns it produces provide food for cattle and other wildlife. It also provides cover for such animals like deer, turkeys, javelinas, desert sheep, songbirds, and quail. The white tailed deer is also known to utilize it for cover. For <b>white-tailed</b> and mule <b>deer,</b> the Arizona white oak is highly palatable as well.|$|R
40|$|Prey {{selection}} by {{mountain lions}} (Felis concolor) in the Aravaipa-Klondyke area (2, 000 km) in southeastern Arizona was studied from February 1991 through September 1993. Overall diet from {{frequency of occurrence}} as determined from 370 scats was: 48 % <b>deer</b> (<b>white-tailed</b> and mule <b>deer</b> combined), 34 % cattle, 17 % javelinas, 6 % rabbit (cottontail and jackrabbit), 4 % rodent, and 2 % desert bighorn. Using a correction factor developed by Ackerman et al. (1984), we also estimated percent biomass and proportion of individuals killed. With respect to biomass consumed, cattle was 44 %, deer 40 %, javelinas 10. 9 %, rabbits 2. 9 %, and rodents 0. 02 %. Based on weights of prey consumed, proportion of individuals eaten changed to rabbits 52. 7 %, deer 16. 3 %, rodents 12 %, javelinas 10 % cattle 8 %, and desert bighorn 0. 5 % Comparisons with availability as determined from four separate four-day double-count helicopter surveys found that lions selected calves (ate more than expected based on availability alone), killed and ate less deer than expected, and javelinas as would be expected...|$|R
5000|$|The most {{noticeable}} differences between <b>white-tailed</b> and mule <b>deer</b> are {{the size of}} their ears, the color of their tails, and the configuration of their antlers. In many cases, body size is also a key difference. The mule deer's tail is black-tipped whereas the whitetail's is not. Mule deer antlers are bifurcated; they [...] "fork" [...] as they grow, rather than branching from a single main beam, {{as is the case with}} white-tails.|$|R
5|$|A {{number of}} species are doing well in the {{increasingly}} urbanized Massachusetts. Peregrine falcons utilize office towers in larger cities as nesting areas, and the population of coyotes, whose diet may include garbage and roadkill, has been increasing in recent decades. <b>White-tailed</b> <b>deer,</b> raccoons, wild turkeys, and eastern gray squirrels are also found throughout Massachusetts. In more rural areas {{in the western part}} of Massachusetts, larger mammals such as moose and black bears have returned, largely due to reforestation following the regional decline in agriculture.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{investigations}} {{have revealed that}} the diet of the inhabitants of Motul de San José included dogs (Canis familiaris), turtles including pond sliders (Trachemys scripta) and Mesoamerican river turtles (Dermatemys mawii), freshwater snails (mostly Pomacea flagellata but also jute snails (Pachychilus spp.)), <b>white-tailed</b> <b>deer</b> (Odocoileus virginianus), red brocket (Mazama americana, a species of small deer), white-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari), rabbits (Sylvilagus spp.), lowland pacas (Cuniculus paca), Central American agouti (Dasyprocta punctata) and nine-banded armadillos (Dasypus novemcinctus). Only the dog had been domesticated by the Late Classic Maya so the majority of protein in the diet of the inhabitants came from hunting and fishing within the catchment area around the city. The most common food animals were the <b>white-tailed</b> <b>deer,</b> river clam and river turtle. Some animal remains were recovered that were clearly associated with elite status occupation, {{such as those of}} the jaguar, the ocelot or other small feline and the crocodile (crocodilus spp.). These latter three appear more related to ritual and economic activity than nutritional needs. Freshwater snails were more an ingredient in the diet of lower status families while deer remains were associated with the elite residents of the city.|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} {{hardwood forest}} also contains the greatest diversity of animal {{life in the}} notch. Mammals include chipmunks, raccoons, <b>white-tailed</b> <b>deer,</b> black bears, and moose. There are also {{a large number of}} birds in this forest; frequently seen are red-eyed vireos, hermit thrushes, and ovenbirds. Amphibians are also found in the northern hardwood forest. Red efts, the terrestrial stage of development for the red-spotted newt, congregate in large numbers after heavy rains; also present are American toads, spring peepers, and wood frogs.|$|E
5000|$|The western {{continental}} {{coast of the}} U.S., just as the East Coast, varies from a colder-to-warmer climate from north to south. Few species live though-out the entire West Coast, however, there are some, including the American Bald Eagle that inhabits both the Alaskan Aleutian Islands and the California Channel Islands. In most of the contiguous Western U.S. are mule <b>deer,</b> <b>white-tailed</b> antelope squirrels, cougars, American badgers, coyotes, hawks and several species of snakes and lizards are common.|$|R
50|$|With fifteen {{species of}} hummingbirds, elegant trogon, sulphur-bellied flycatcher, black-capped gnatcatcher, flame-colored tanager, thirty-six species of wood warblers, and over 256 {{species of birds}} {{documented}} in total, Madera Canyon is rated the third best birding destination in the United States. Other animals {{that can be found}} in Madera Canyon include black bear, mountain lion, bobcats, <b>white-tailed</b> and mule <b>deer,</b> foxes, coatis, ring-tailed cats, raccoons, wild turkeys, squirrels, and rabbits. Sixteen species of bats have also been recorded in the canyon.|$|R
50|$|Several {{developed}} and natural springs {{in the wilderness}} provide water for the abundant wildlife. <b>White-tailed</b> and mule <b>deer,</b> mountain lions, golden eagles, bald eagles and many other animals inhabit the Dos Cabezas Mountains. The collared lizard {{may be found in}} the upper portions of Buckeye Canyon. The peregrine falcon, a state and federally listed endangered species, migrates through the area. The majority of the wilderness contains mountain shrub, desert shrub and riparian vegetation. Arizona's Game and Fish department recently released photos from a 2016 sighting of the second known jaguar living in the state.|$|R
5|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{wildlife}} {{can be found in}} and around Matagorda Bay. The Mad Island-Oyster Lake conservation area, located on the eastern shore of Matagorda Bay, is a habitat for over 300 species of birds including songbirds, shorebirds and waterfowl. More species of birds were found in the area than any other in the nation during the National Audubon Society's annual Christmas Bird Count from 2000 to 2002. Other fauna located along the bay include bobcats, <b>white-tailed</b> <b>deer,</b> river otters, Texas horned lizards, reddish egret, white-tailed hawk, peregrine falcon, the piping plover and alligators.|$|E
5|$|Fauna is {{similarly}} distributed, with distinct altitudinal zonation present. The highest altitudes support the endangered mountain tapir (Tapirus pinchaque), cougar (Puma concolor), guinea pig (Cavia porcellus), and Andean fox (Lycalopex culpaeus). Lower down, the spectacled bear (Tremarctos ornatus), jaguar (Panthera onca), ocelot (Leopardus pardalis), margay (Leopardus wiedii), <b>white-tailed</b> <b>deer</b> (Odocoileus virginianus), brocket deers (Mazama sp.), vulnerable northern pudú (Pudu mephistophiles), and endangered giant otter (Pteronura brasiliensis) {{can all be}} found. Bird species common in the area include the Andean condor (Vultur gryphus), Andean cock-of-the-rock (Rupicola peruvianus), giant hummingbird (Patagona gigas), torrent duck (Merganetta armata), king vulture (Sarcoramphus papa), and swallow-tailed kite (Elanoides forficatus).|$|E
5|$|Humans {{have also}} {{adversely}} impacted {{the ecology of}} the Everglades by introducing numerous invasive species, which may prey on or compete with native species. A spectacular and particularly damaging example of this phenomenon is the recent proliferation of the Burmese python in the Everglades, as well as elsewhere in Florida. First observed in the wild in 1979 and not again until 1995, they have increased alarmingly since 2000. By 2011, decreases of 87.5%, 94.1%, 98.9% and 99.3% in sightings of bobcats, <b>white-tailed</b> <b>deer,</b> opossums and raccoons, respectively, were reported in park road surveys, while rabbits were no longer being seen at all.|$|E
5000|$|There {{have been}} reports that {{wildlife}} has since flourished due to significant reduction of human impact. [...] For this reason, the zone is considered {{by some as a}} classic example of an involuntary park. Some claim that the populations of traditional Polesian animals (such as wolves, badger, wild boar, roe <b>deer,</b> <b>white-tailed</b> eagle, black stork, western marsh harrier, short-eared owl, red deer, moose, great egret, whooper swan, least weasel, common kestrel and beaver) have multiplied enormously and begun expanding outside the zone. These claims, however, are not substantiated by any systematic census of any animal taxon.|$|R
40|$|Tumors of {{the central}} nervous system occur in the horse, cow, pig, cat, dog, chicken and {{laboratory}} rats and mice, but there are few reports of these tumors in other mammals [2, 8, 91. We found an unusual brain tumor in a wild deer and suggest a new concept for the pathogenesis of tumors that arise in the nervous system and contain muscle. A young adult female <b>white-tailed</b> wild <b>deer</b> was found wandering in a wooded area of Tennessee. She was weak and dazed and died 24 hours later. The deer was necropsied at the Tennessee Animal Disease Diagnostic Labora-tory. Tissues were fixed in 10 percent buffered neutral formalin, embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 6 micrometers, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) and phosphotungstic acid-hematoxylin (PTAH). Formalin-fixed tissues were processed for electron microscopic study. Lesions were confined to {{the central nervous system}}. The frontal lobes of the brain contained a gelatinous mass 3. 8 centimeters at its greatest diameter. The tumor was in the midline in the region of the frontal lobes (fig. 1). The upper par...|$|R
5000|$|Environmental {{conditions}} enable certain {{species of}} plants and animals to colonize habitat borders. Plants that colonize tend to be shade-intolerant and tolerant of dry conditions, such as shrubs and vines. Animals that colonize tend to be those that require two or more habitats, such as <b>white-tailed</b> and mule <b>deer,</b> elk, cottontail rabbits, blue jays, and robins. Some animals travel between habitats, while edge species are restricted to edges. Larger patches include more individuals and therefore have increased biodiversity. The width of the patch also influences diversity: an edge patch must be more pronounced than just a stark border in order to develop gradients of edge effects.|$|R
