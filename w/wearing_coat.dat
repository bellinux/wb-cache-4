In this present study comparison of strength of pavement <b>wearing</b> <b>coat</b> made with SMA mix with fibre and without fibre was done. This research {{was done to}} evaluate the viability of sisal fibres as stabilising agent in the mixture by laboratory tests in which a flow parameter was analyzed, {{as well as the}} mechanical properties of the mixture. For the SMA mix the aggregate gradation was taken as per the MoRTH specification and the binder content was 4 %, 4. 5 %. 5 %, 5. 5 %, 6 %, 6. 5 %, 7 % by weight of aggregate and fibre used was 0. 3 % by weight of aggregate.
