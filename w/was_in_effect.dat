5|$|Around 0300UTC on October4, the Government of Mexico {{issued a}} {{tropical}} storm warning for areas between Punta Abreojos and San Carlos on the Pacific coast of Baja California and for areas between Santa Rosalía to Loreto on the Gulf coast of the Peninsula. Roughly twelve hours later, the warning was superseded by another tropical storm warning. The new warning was issued for areas between Punta Abreojos and El Rosario on the Pacific coast and for areas between Santa Rosalia and Punta Final on the Gulf coast. In mainland Mexico, {{a tropical storm}} watch was issued for coastal areas of Sonora between Cabo Lobos and Puerto Penasco. By 1830UTC, all of the watches and warnings were revised; on the Pacific coast of Baja California, the warning <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>effect</b> for areas between Punta Abreojos and San Juanico; on the Gulf coast, the warning <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>effect</b> for areas between Santa Rosalia and Punta Conception; the watch for coastal areas of Sonora was upgraded to a tropical storm warning for areas between Guaymas and Cabo Lobos. Following Raymond's landfall in mainland Mexico, all warnings were discontinued by 1200UTC on October5.|$|E
5|$|By November18, a {{hurricane}} warning <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>effect</b> for {{the southeast and}} central Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands. Flood warnings were issued for northern Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic. In preparation for the hurricane's arrival, officials forced 360,000people to evacuate in north-central Cuba.|$|E
5|$|Early in the {{duration}} of the storm, the National Hurricane Center consistently forecast Ivan to track further to the north than it eventually did. Late on September 5, the government of Barbados issued a hurricane watch for its territory. Shortly thereafter, Saint Lucia was put under a hurricane watch and Grenada and its dependencies were put under a tropical storm watch. As the hurricane approached the southern Lesser Antilles, more watches were issued, and by 24hours prior to Ivan passing through the island chain a hurricane warning <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>effect</b> for Barbados, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Saint Lucia, Tobago, and Grenada, and a tropical storm warning <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>effect</b> for Trinidad. With the path of Ivan more southerly than predicted, the hurricane warnings were downgraded to tropical storm warnings for the northern islands, and by late on September 7 when the eye of the hurricane passed near Grenada, hurricane warnings were in effect for Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Trinidad and Tobago, and Grenada. Subsequently, a tropical storm warning was issued for the northern coast of Venezuela through the Guajira Peninsula of Colombia.|$|E

5|$|In 1977, the church, rectory, {{and schools}} were {{recorded}} by a historic preservation program {{run by the}} Ohio Historical Society, known as the Ohio Historic Inventory. This survey found the church in excellent condition, the elementary school in fair condition, and {{the high school and}} rectory in good condition. Although no historic preservation program <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>effect,</b> no threats to historic integrity were identified for any of the buildings, except for the elementary school, which was deemed to be in danger from being outdated.|$|E
5|$|President Truman ordered {{military}} operations (including the B-29 bombings) to continue until official word of Japanese surrender was received. However, news correspondents incorrectly interpreted a comment by USAF commander Spaatz that the B-29s were not flying on August 11 (because of bad weather) as {{a statement that}} a ceasefire <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>effect.</b> To avoid giving the Japanese {{the impression that the}} Allies had abandoned peace efforts and resumed bombing, Truman then ordered a halt to further bombings.|$|E
5|$|The next year, Edgar Lee Hewett, {{president}} of New Mexico Normal University (later renamed New Mexico Highlands University), mapped many Chacoan sites. Hewett and others helped enact the Federal Antiquities Act of 1906, the first U.S. law to protect relics; it <b>was,</b> <b>in</b> <b>effect,</b> {{a direct consequence of}} Wetherill's controversial activities at Chaco. The Act also authorized the President to establish national monuments: on March 11, 1907, Theodore Roosevelt proclaimed Chaco Canyon National Monument. Wetherill relinquished his land claims.|$|E

Hyder, after initially trying to ally with the British against the Marathas, had later become their firm enemy, as they represented the most effective obstacle to his expansion of his kingdom, and Tipu grew up with violently anti-British feelings.|$|E
5|$|A {{moderate}} {{risk for}} severe weather was {{issued by the}} Storm Prediction Center two days prior to the event. The storm then moved across {{the most of the}} Midwest on October 18, where a moderate risk <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>effect</b> also for two days for most of Illinois, Indiana and parts of Kentucky, although the moderate risk was revised further to the south and east to include western Ohio, western Tennessee, southeastern Missouri, northeastern Arkansas and a larger portion of Kentucky while Michigan and Wisconsin were no longer under a moderate risk. A slight risk of severe weather was forecast for a large area from beyond the Canada–US border to the Florida Panhandle and Mobile Bay. Dew points above 70°F (21°C) were reported well into the Ohio Valley, and dew points above 60°F (16°C) were reported as far north as northern Ontario.|$|E
5|$|At {{some point}} during his campaigns in Thessaly, Philip {{captured}} the strategic port of Pagasae, which <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>effect</b> the port of Pherae. It is unclear whether this was during {{the first or second}} campaign; both Buckler and Cawkwell suggest that it took place in the second campaign, before the Battle of Crocus Field. By taking Pagasae, it is possible that Philip prevented Pherae from being reinforced by sea during his second campaign. Buckler suggests that Philip had learnt his lesson from the previous campaign, and intended to cut Pherae off from outside help before attacking it.|$|E

5|$|B'nai Israel hired Peres in December 1858 as cantor and teacher, in English and German, at {{an annual}} salary of $600 (today $) with {{perquisites}} of $400. By comparison, the kosher butcher's salary was $300, not including what he earned killing poultry. Peres also ran the Hebrew school and the choir, and <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>effect</b> the rabbi. Under his leadership, the membership took a serious interest in the plight of Jews around the world. For example, at a congregational meeting in , they gathered money from the members present and B'nai Israel's treasury to assist suffering Moroccan Jews, and created a committee to raise funds throughout Memphis on their behalf. The congregation also moved more towards Orthodoxy, and passed a rule stating that only those members who were Sabbath observant could receive Torah honors on the High Holy Days.|$|E
5|$|Based on the {{recommendation}} of the EACD, the New Zealand government has passed legislation which placed BZP, along with the other piperazine derivatives TFMPP, mCPP, pFPP, MeOPP and MBZP, into Class C of the New Zealand Misuse of Drugs Act 1975. A ban was intended to come into effect in New Zealand on 18 December 2007, but the law change did not go through until the following year, and the sale of BZP and the other listed piperazines became illegal in New Zealand as of 1 April 2008. An amnesty for possession and usage of these drugs <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>effect</b> until October 2008, at which point they became completely illegal.|$|E
5|$|Bradley's {{graduation}} year, 1965, was {{the last}} year that the NBA's territorial rule <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>effect,</b> which gave professional teams first rights to draft players who attended college within 50 miles of the team. The New York Knicks—one mile closer to Princeton than the Philadelphia 76ers—drafted Bradley as a territorial pick in the 1965 draft, {{but he did not}} sign a contract with the team immediately. While studying Politics, Philosophy, and Economics at Oxford, he commuted to Italy to play professional basketball for Olimpia Milano during the 1965–66 season, where the team won a European Champions Cup (predecessor to the modern EuroLeague).|$|E

5|$|Bush was {{appointed}} to the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) in 1938, and soon became its chairman. As chairman of the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC), and later director of OSRD, Bush coordinated the activities of some six thousand leading American scientists in the application of science to warfare. Bush was a well-known policymaker and public intellectual during World War II, when he <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>effect</b> the first presidential science advisor. As head of NDRC and OSRD, he initiated the Manhattan Project, and ensured that it received top priority from the highest levels of government. In Science, The Endless Frontier, his 1945 report to the President of the United States, Bush called for an expansion of government support for science, and he pressed for the creation of the National Science Foundation.|$|E
5|$|By the 1850s, New School Presbyterians in the North {{had moved}} to more {{moderate}} positions and reasserted a stronger Presbyterian identity. This was helped in 1852 when the Plan of Union between the New School Church and the Congregationalists was discontinued. Northern Presbyterian's of both the Old and New School participated in the Christian Commission that provided religious and social services to Union soldiers during the Civil War. Furthermore, both schools boldly proclaimed the righteousness of the Union cause and engaged in speculation {{about the role of}} a newly restored America in ushering in the millennium. This <b>was,</b> <b>in</b> <b>effect,</b> the Old School's repudiation of its teaching against involving the church in political affairs.|$|E

If they are equal, then the cone becomes a cylinder; if they are unequal, then {{the surface of the}} cone must be stepped. The reply of Chrysippus was that the surfaces are both equal and unequal. Chrysippus <b>was,</b> <b>in</b> <b>effect,</b> negating the law of excluded middle with respect to the equal and unequal, and thus he may have anticipated an important principle of modern infinitesimal calculus, namely, the limit and the process of convergence towards a limit.|$|E
5|$|Coinciding {{with the}} first {{advisory}} on the depression, the government of Costa Rica issued a tropical storm warning for the entire Pacific coast of the country. About four hours prior to landfall, when Alma was named, a tropical storm warning <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>effect</b> for the entire coastlines of Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, and El Salvador. When it was realized the storm was much stronger than previously thought, a hurricane warning was issued for the coasts of Nicaragua and Honduras, and Alma was forecast to attain hurricane status. Prior to moving ashore, the NHC warned that the storm could produce up to 20inches (500mm) of rainfall, resulting in mudslides and flash flooding. The National Emergency Commission of Costa Rica activated emergency shelters prior {{to the arrival of}} the storm; 250people in Parrita evacuated from their homes. In Nicaragua, officials evacuated about 5,000people, while 3,000troops were mobilized to assist {{in the aftermath of the}} storm.|$|E
5|$|Delahaye {{was one of}} many gardener-botanists {{employed}} on European colonial voyages {{of scientific}} exploration in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Their duty was to assist with the collection, transport, cultivation and distribution of economic plants. They worked with the naturalists on these expeditions, but gave particular assistance to the botanists by collecting live plants and seed, as well as plant specimens for herbarium collections. They often maintained journals and records of their collections and made observations on the vegetation encountered during the voyage. On this particular expedition, Delahaye assisted the naturalist and botanist Jacques-Julien Houtou de Labillardière—who accumulated one of the largest herbarium collections of that era and published what <b>was,</b> <b>in</b> <b>effect,</b> the first Flora of Australia based on the collections he made on the New Holland (Australian) leg of the expedition.
