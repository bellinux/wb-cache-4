5|$|A {{number of}} {{measures}} {{have not been}} confirmed to affect UTI frequency including: urinating immediately after intercourse, the type of underwear used, personal hygiene methods used after urinating or defecating, or whether a person typically bathes or showers.

In those with frequent urinary tract infections <b>who</b> <b>use</b> spermicide or a diaphragm {{as a method of}} contraception, they are advised to use alternative methods.

40|$|BackgroundThere {{have been}} no multicenter studies that {{estimated}} the relations of either nurse or pharmacist home visit program to drug costs of potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs). This study aimed to establish whether patients <b>who</b> <b>used</b> nurse or pharmacist home visit programs (nurse or pharmacist program) had lower drug costs of PIMs than those <b>who</b> did not <b>use</b> nurse or pharmacist programs for older patients living at home. MethodsThis cross-sectional {{study was conducted in}} home care settings in Japan, involving 430 patients aged 65 or older, of whom 276 were female. All received regular home visits from five clinics between May and December 2013. After the PIMs were identified with the Screening Tool of Older Persons 2 ̆ 7 potentially inappropriate Prescriptions (STOPP) criteria, we estimated the drug costs based on actual pharmaceutical prices and measured against <b>who</b> <b>using</b> nurse or pharmacist programs after a propensity score weighted adjustment. ResultsPatients <b>who</b> <b>used</b> nurse programs had lower drug cost of PIMs than those <b>who</b> did not <b>use,</b> but it was not significantly different (5. 9 ± 13. 1 vs 7. 1 ± 13. 9 USD per month, P = 0. 199). The cost of PIMs for patients <b>who</b> <b>used</b> pharmacist programs also had no difference. (7. 2 ± 14. 5 vs 5. 5 ± 11. 5 USD per month, P = 0. 06). In the patient groups <b>who</b> <b>used</b> nurse programs, patients <b>who</b> also <b>used</b> pharmacist programs had significantly higher costs of PIMs than those <b>who</b> <b>used</b> only nurse programs (5. 5 ± 13. 9 vs 2. 5 ± 6. 0 USD per month, P = 0. 006). In patients group <b>who</b> did not <b>use</b> pharmacist programs, patients <b>who</b> only <b>used</b> nurse programs had significantly lower costs of PIMs than those <b>who</b> did not <b>use</b> nurse programs (3. 6 ± 7. 7 vs 5. 8 ± 12. 7 USD per month, P = 0. 022). ConclusionsPatients <b>who</b> <b>used</b> nurse program have a trend towards lower drug costs of PIMs than those <b>who</b> <b>used</b> nurse and pharmacist program or pharmacist program alone. Although this study tried to adjust the potential confounders as possible as we could by using propensity score analysis, further studies are needed to confirm our results...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{identify}} {{characteristics that}} could distinguish males who completed suicide by hanging from males who completed suicide by firearms and non-domestic gas, {{and to suggest}} suicide prevention strategies targeted at hanging. Method: Using the psychological autopsy design, males <b>who</b> <b>used</b> hanging, firearms and non-domestic gas were compared {{on a range of}} variables covering social, psychological, and health related factors and aspects of the suicide incident. The sample consisted of 950 males who suicided in Queensland, Australia, between 1994 and 1996. Results: Compared with males <b>who</b> <b>used</b> firearms and non-domestic gas, males <b>who</b> <b>used</b> hanging were significantly younger, less likely to have left a suicide note, and {{more likely to have been}} diagnosed with a psychotic disorder. Compared with males <b>who</b> <b>used</b> firearms, males <b>who</b> <b>used</b> hanging were significantly more likely to have made prior suicide attempts and have had no physical illness. Compared with males <b>who</b> <b>used</b> non-domestic gas, males <b>who</b> <b>used</b> hanging were significantly more likely to have lived with others, have had prior legal trouble, and have suicided at their residence. Conclusions: The results are discussed in terms of the availability and socio-cultural acceptability of methods. The authors suggest a possible relationship between impulsive traits and method choice. This proposition requires further investigation using alternative methodologies. Some suicide prevention measures targeting hanging suicides are discussed in light of the results. Griffith Health, Australian Institute for Suicide Research & PreventionNo Full Tex...|$|R
