The senator was in a grave mood; when asked how he thought the White House might accommodate a family as large as his, he responded, [...] "Do you think {{that is going to be}} my biggest problem?" [...] When Paar more seriously asked if jobs would solve the problems of urban ghettos, Kennedy replied that while job opportunity was important, it needed to be accompanied by [...] "compassion for one's fellow human beings." [...] Paar then asked, [...] "What did you think <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> Dr. King had been assassinated?" [...] Kennedy answered, [...] "That more and more people are turning to violence. And in the last analysis it's going to destroy our country." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Proofs?" [...] She {{stared at}} him, wide-eyed a moment. Then her lip curled. [...] "And that no doubt {{was the reason}} of your flight <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> the Queen's pursuivants were coming in {{response}} to the public voice to call you to account." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The news quite {{took all}} our breath away, Millicent," [...] {{one of them}} said. [...] "It seems {{extraordinary}} {{that you should have}} been Miss Thorndyke all the time, though I don't think that any of us were at all surprised that you should take the name now; you must have been surprised <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> you were the heiress of Crowswood." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not <b>when</b> <b>you</b> had <b>heard</b> all <b>that</b> {{was said}} on the subject last year?' said Mr. Woodbourne; 'I am ashamed to see you resort to such a foolish subterfuge.' ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>When</b> I <b>heard</b> <b>you</b> sing <b>that</b> burden [...] In my vernal {{days and}} bowers, [...] Other praises disregarding, [...] I but hearkened that of yours-- [...] Only saying [...] In heart-playing, [...] "Blessed eyes mine eyes have been, [...] If the sweetest HIS have seen!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Then Sir Gareth {{looked very}} calmly upon Lynette and he said: [...] "Lady, {{it may well}} be that a man who assumeth to have credit and honor may fail in an {{undertaking}} of this sort, but <b>when</b> have <b>you</b> ever <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> such a man of credit or of honor hath withdrawn him from an adventure because there is great danger in it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I {{think it}} right {{to tell you that}} I shall. And, Mr Gresham, I did not expect much {{co-operation}} from you; but I did think that you would have shown some little anger <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> I had been so ill-treated. I shall, however, know {{how to take care of}} myself; and I shall continue to do the best I can to protect Frank from these wicked intrigues." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Bashwood!" [...] she exclaimed, in loud, clear tones {{indicative}} of the utmost astonishment, [...] "what a surprise to find you here! I thought none but the wretched inhabitants ever ventured near {{this side of the}} town. Hush!" [...] she added quickly, in a whisper. [...] "You heard right <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> Mr. Armadale was going to have me followed and watched. There's a man behind one of the houses. We must talk out loud of indifferent things, and look as if we had met by accident. Ask me what I am doing. Out loud! Directly! You shall never see me again, if you don't instantly leave off trembling and do what I tell you!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Yet {{the child}} {{could make him}} no answer, and sobbed as though her heart were bursting. 'Why would you go, dear Nell? I know {{you would not be}} happy <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> we were crying for your loss. They say that Willy is in Heaven now, and that it's always summer there, and yet I'm sure he grieves when I lie down upon his garden bed, and he cannot turn to kiss me. But if you do go, Nell,' said the boy, caressing her, and {{pressing}} his face to hers, 'be fond of him for my sake. Tell him how I love him still, and how much I loved you; and when I think that you two are together, and are happy, I'll try to bear it, and never give you pain by doing wrong--indeed I never will!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Before {{you place}} any {{confidence}} in me," [...] he went on, [...] "you ought to know, and you MUST know, {{under what circumstances}} I have been received into Mr. Candy's house. It won't take long. I don't profess, sir, to tell my story (as the phrase is) to any man. My story will die with me. All I ask, is to be permitted to tell you, what I have told Mr. Candy. If you {{are still in the}} mind, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> have <b>heard</b> <b>that,</b> to say what you have proposed to say, you will command my attention and command my services. Shall we walk on?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mayhap, Macumazahn, but my wrongs are {{the wrongs}} of a nation, {{therefore}} I {{think of the}} nation, and at least I do not fear death like you white men. Now hearken. Presently your friends will tell you a story. The lady Heddana {{will tell you how}} I made use of her for a certain purpose, for which purpose indeed I drew the three of you into Zululand, because without her I could not have brought about this war into which Cetewayo did not wish to enter. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> have <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> story, do not judge me too hardly, Macumazahn, who had a great end to gain." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, it is delicious," [...] he {{answered}} her, speaking more lightly than he felt. [...] "What a numskull you make, Grizel, of {{any man who}} presumes to write about women! I am at school again, and you are Miss Ailie teaching me the alphabet. But I thought you lost that serious little girl on the doleful day <b>when</b> she <b>heard</b> <b>you</b> say <b>that</b> you loved me best." ...|$|R
6000|$|He hesitated, {{glancing at}} her with troubled eyes, and then replied--"I thought, Miss Starbrow, that <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> I was trying to live down the past--trying very hard and not unsuccessfully as I imagined--it would have made some {{difference}} in your feelings towards me. To win your forgiveness for the wrong I did you has been the one motive I have had for all my strivings since I last saw you. That has been the goal I have had before me--that only. Latterly I have hoped that Miss Eden, who had as much reason to regard me with enmity as yourself, would be my intercessor with you. By a most unhappy chance we have met too soon, and I regret it, I cannot say how much; for you make the task I have set myself seem so much harder than before that I almost despair." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{brother has}} already spoken {{of you to}} me, Sir Gervaise," [...] the viscount said, when the young knight was {{presented}} to him; [...] "although indeed there was no occasion {{for him to do}} so, since the name of the knight who two years ago saved the commerce of Italy from ruin, and with a single galley destroyed or captured a great fleet of over twenty Barbary pirates, and thus for a time put a stop to the depredations of the infidels, is known throughout Europe. By the way, I am the bearer of a message to you. I took ship at Genoa on my way hither, and stayed two or three days there while she was being got ready for sea. Knowing that I was bound hither, a certain very beautiful young lady of noble family, to whom I had the honour of being introduced, prayed me that if you should by any chance have escaped from captivity--and she said that she was convinced that you would, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> Rhodes was threatened, assuredly endeavour to escape and to come hither to take a share in the defence--I was to tell you that she trusted you still bore her gage, and that she, on her part, had held fast to the promise she made you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You may {{now when}} you have heard all these things,' she said, 'but you would not at the time. When the shopkeeper and his {{assistant}} told my father that story I could see that his face turned white, and {{that for a moment}} he believed that I must have taken these things in order to obtain money to bribe the man whom I had solemnly declared had no letters of mine. When I heard the story told, and that my very dress was recognised, I asked myself if I could have done it unconsciously, in a state of somnambulism or something of that sort. I was absolutely dazed and bewildered. With all your trust in me I am sure you must have been shaken <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> story, just as my own father was. Again, when my old and kindest friend, Mr. Singleton, declared that I had come to him sobbing and crying, and begging him to save me from disgrace, and that he had given me a cheque for a thousand pounds, could he be blamed for believing that the girl he knew and loved had been engaged in some scandalous affair? As to Captain Hampton, he believed me absolutely in regard to the letters, but he doubted me afterwards. Try to put yourself in his place. If you had known about this affair of the letters, and you had seen me in an out-of-the-way part of London, engaged in a conversation with the man we were searching for as the author of the postcards, what would you have thought?' She asked the question a little wistfully.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{must say}} it jarred me <b>when</b> I <b>heard</b> <b>you</b> pulling <b>that</b> stuff,' {{continued}} White. 'I haven't {{what you might}} call a childlike faith in my fellow-man as a rule, but {{it had never occurred to}} me for a moment that you could be playing that game. It only shows,' he added philosophically, 'that you've got to suspect everybody when it comes to a gilt-edged proposition like the Little Nugget.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let me finish," [...] Bernadine insisted. [...] "Perhaps <b>when</b> <b>you</b> have <b>heard</b> all <b>that</b> I {{have to say}} you {{may change}} your attitude. We are {{interested}} in the same people, but in different ways. If we both move from opposite directions our friend will vanish. He is clever enough at disappearing, as he has proved before. We do not want the same thing from him, I am convinced of that. Let us move together and make sure that he does not evade us." ...|$|R
5000|$|He {{then sent}} Onescratus to bring Dandamis to him. When Onescratus {{encountered}} Dandamis in forest, he {{gave him the}} message, that Alexander, the Great son of Zeus, has ordered {{him to come to}} him. He will give you gold and other rewards but if you refuse, he may behead <b>you.</b> <b>When</b> Dandamis <b>heard</b> <b>that,</b> he did not even raise his head and replied lying in his bed of leaves. God the Great King, is not a source of violence but provider of water, food, light and life. Your king cannot be a God, who loves violence and who is mortal. [...] Even if you take away my head, you cannot take away my soul, which will depart to my God and leave this body like we throw away old garment. We, Brahmins do not love gold nor fear death. So your king has nothing to offer, which I may need. Go and tell you King : Dandamis, therefore, will not come to you. If he needs Dandamis, he must come to me ...|$|R

Later, in the interview [...] "Literary Lion: Questions for Gore Vidal" [...] (June 15, 2008), the New York Times reporter Deborah Solomon asked Vidal, [...] "How did you feel, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> Buckley died this year?"

But who really moved it out of just playing acoustic to electric was all those people that were playing in the 1950s. Initially, it was the rockabilly-style guitar, the Johnny Burnette Rock and Roll Trio. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>that,</b> it was just something that inspired you so much to want to play out of the box as it's so abstract, the guitar playing." ...|$|E
5000|$|Many {{people can}} {{remember}} {{what they were doing}} when certain internationally big media events occurred and these type of questions are usually used as a sort of milestone in individual people's life. For example, [...] "What were you doing <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> John Lennon was shot?". Due to television repeats, these moments could be relived even long after the actual event happened. The introduction of video stores and video recorders in the 1980s, the Internet in the 1990s and the DVD player and YouTube in the 2000s even increased the opportunity to view and check out famous and infamous movie and TV scenes.|$|E
6000|$|When she grew, not calm, but fatigued, I {{ventured to}} ask why she had conferred on me the honour of her invitation, and how I had been unfortunate enough to allude to affairs of which I had {{certainly}} no knowledge. Her reply was given with stately dignity. [...] "You need not pretend," [...] she said, [...] "to have forgotten what I told you in this very room, before you left England for an African tour in the Jingo. I then revealed to you the secret of my life, {{the secret of the}} Duke's death. Your horror <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> how <b>that</b> most unhappy man compelled me to free myself from his tyranny, by a method which his habits rendered only too easy--in short, by a dose of cheap sherry, was deep and natural. Oh, Percy, you did not kiss your mother before starting on your ill-omened voyage. As soon as I heard of the wreck of the Jingo, and that you were the only passenger drowned, I recognized an artifice, un vieux truc, by which you hoped to escape from a mother of whom you were ashamed. You had only pretended to be the victim of Ocean's rage! People who are drowned in novels always do reappear: and, Percy, your mother is an old novel-reader! My agents have ever since been on your track, but it was reserved for me to discover the last of the Birkenheads in the anonymous author of the 'Baronet's Wife.' That romance, in which you have had the baseness to use your knowledge of a mother's guilt as a motif in your twopenny plot, unveiled to me the secret of your hidden existence. You must stop the story, or alter the following numbers; you must give up your discreditable mode of life. Heavens, that a Birkenhead should be a literary character! And you must resume your place in my house and in society." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How can I move thee? Will no entreaties cause thee {{to turn a}} {{favourable}} eye upon thy creature, who implores thy {{goodness and}} compassion? Believe me, Frankenstein, I was benevolent; my soul glowed with love and humanity; but am I not alone, miserably alone? You, my creator, abhor me; what hope can I gather from your fellow creatures, who owe me nothing? They spurn and hate me. The desert mountains and dreary glaciers are my refuge. I have wandered here many days; the caves of ice, which I only do not fear, are a dwelling to me, {{and the only one}} which man does not grudge. These bleak skies I hail, for they are kinder to me than your fellow beings. If the multitude of mankind knew of my existence, they would do as you do, and arm themselves for my destruction. Shall I not then hate them who abhor me? I will keep no terms with my enemies. I am miserable, and they shall share my wretchedness. Yet it is in your power to recompense me, and deliver them from an evil which it only remains for you to make so great, that not only you and your family, but thousands of others, shall be swallowed up in the whirlwinds of its rage. Let your compassion be moved, and do not disdain me. Listen to my tale; <b>when</b> <b>you</b> have <b>heard</b> <b>that,</b> abandon or commiserate me, as you shall judge that I deserve. But hear me. The guilty are allowed, by human laws, bloody as they are, to speak in their own defence before they are condemned. Listen to me, Frankenstein. You accuse me of murder, and yet you would, with a satisfied conscience, destroy your own creature. Oh, praise the eternal justice of man! Yet I ask you not to spare me; listen to me, and then, if you can, and if you will, destroy the work of your hands." ...|$|R
60|$|The plainly dressed old man now led {{us into a}} long corridor, which goes, I think, {{the whole}} length of the house, about five hundred feet, arched all the way, and {{lengthened}} interminably by a looking-glass at the end, in which I saw our own party approaching like a party of strangers. But I have so often seen this effect produced in dry-goods stores and elsewhere, that I was not much impressed. There were family portraits and other pictures, and likewise pieces of statuary, along this arched corridor; and it communicated with a chapel with a scriptural altar-piece, copied from Rubens, {{and a picture of}} St. Michael and the Dragon, and two, or perhaps three, richly painted windows. Everything here is entirely new and fresh, this part having been repaired, and never yet inhabited by the family. This brand-newness makes it much less effective than if it had been lived in; and I felt pretty much as if I were strolling through any other renewed house. After all, the utmost force of man can do positively very little towards making grand things or beautiful things. The imagination can do so much more, merely on shutting one's eyes, that the actual effect seems meagre; so that a new house, unassociated with the past, is exceedingly unsatisfactory, especially <b>when</b> <b>you</b> have <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> the wealth mud skill of man has here done its best. Besides, the rooms, as we saw them, did not look by any means their best, the carpets not being down, and the furniture being covered with protective envelopes. However, rooms cannot be seen to advantage by daylight; it being altogether essential to the effect, that they should be illuminated by artificial light, which takes them somewhat out of the region of bare reality. Nevertheless, there was undoubtedly great splendor, for the details of which I refer to the guide-book. Among the family portraits, there was one of a lady famous for her beautiful hand; and she was holding it up to notice in the funniest way, --and very beautiful it certainly was. The private apartments of the family were not shown us. I should think it impossible for the owner of this house to imbue it with his personality to such a degree as to feel it to be his home. It must be like a small lobster in a shell much too large for him.|$|R
