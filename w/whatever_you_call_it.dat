500|$|It {{is hard to}} make a {{consistent}} argument that a 400km iceball should count as a planet because it might have interesting geology, while a 5000km satellite with a massive atmosphere, methane lakes, and dramatic storms [...] shouldn't be put into the same category, <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> <b>call</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
500|$|Olivia became {{concerned}} about her daughter after Hilda Doolittle, who also believed she was engaged to Pound, arrived in London in 1911. Olivia welcomed H.D. to her home, but she witnessed the interactions between Dorothy, Pound, H.D. and Richard Aldington, whom H.D. married in 1913. In September 1912 Olivia wrote a stern letter to Pound, in which she pointedly told him to break off his friendship with Dorothy:You {{told me you were}} prepared to see less of Dorothy this winter. I don't know if you wd rather leave it to me to say I don't think it advisable she should see so much of you etc. or whether you wd rather do it in your own way.... I don't know if she still considers herself engaged to you—but she obviously can't marry you—it's hardly decent! There's another point too—which is the personal inconvenience & bother to myself—I had all last winter, practically to keep 2 days a week for you to come & see her... She must marry—She & I can't possibly go on living this feminine life practically à deux for ever, & we haven't money enough to separate... You ought to go away—Englishmen don't understand yr American ways, & any man who wanted to marry her wd be put off by the fact of yr friendship (or <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> <b>call</b> <b>it)</b> with her. If you had ₤500 a year I should be delighted for you to marry her! ...|$|E

30|$|I 2 : In some ways, if you’re entrusting {{the coaches}} {{with this kind}} of group, you’re giving them a lot of {{responsibility}} actually, since these are vulnerable people.

6000|$|... 'The {{effect of}} example. Look here, my dear, the last {{generation}} was that of mediaevalism, ecclesiology, chivalry, symbolism, <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> may <b>call</b> <b>it.</b> Married women have worked out of it. It is the middle-aged maids that monopolize it. Ours is that of common sense.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Then you {{had better}} {{withdraw}} it from trust, or <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> <b>call</b> <b>it,</b> at once. If it was there until I was eighty I should never touch it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I apprehended the consequences," [...] said Alick, [...] "and besides, {{you never}} mounted that black lace pall, or curtain, or <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> <b>call</b> <b>it,</b> upon your head, after your {{first attempt at}} {{frightening}} me away with it." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Very well, then," [...] he said, [...] "what I {{should like}} to know is, what became of that message which made very pretty illuminations around your conductor, or <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> <b>call</b> <b>it,</b> {{for at least a}} quarter of an hour this morning?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Harkee, old trapper," [...] the moody-looking bee-hunter exclaimed; [...] "it is {{very well}} {{to talk of the}} other side of this ripple of a river, or brook, or <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> may <b>call</b> <b>it,</b> but in my {{judgment}} it would be a smart rifle that would throw its lead across it--that is, to any detriment to Indian, or deer." ...|$|R

[...] "I'm not an {{authority}} on telepathy, or <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> <b>call</b> <b>it.</b> But I've no belief in such theories. In fact, I think they are all nonsense.

6000|$|... "Change your platform--or <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> <b>call</b> <b>it!</b> You're on {{the wrong}} horse, Paul, my boy. Even your own agent admits it--though I never {{mentioned}} your name at first or told him who I was. All the people round here with votes are farmers, agricultural laborers and small shopkeepers.

5000|$|In 2000, Brian Wilson stated of the film: [...] "I didn't like it, I {{thought it}} was in poor taste. ... And it stunk. I thought it stunk!" [...] He {{elaborated}} further: [...] "I didn't like the second part. It wasn't really true to the way things were. I'd like to see another movie if it was done right. But I just sort of turned my back to this one, or my other cheek, or <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> wanna <b>call</b> <b>it.</b> It was best just to ignore it because it really wasn't true to life." ...|$|R

6000|$|... “Oh, but that’s nonsense!” {{declared}} Uncle John. “We can’t imagine Mildred’s {{becoming a}} smuggler—or smuggleress, or <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> <b>call</b> <b>it.</b> That hard, cold {{look in her}} eyes, which we all so thoughtlessly condemned, was merely an indication of suffering, of hurt pride and shame for the disgrace that had been thrust upon her.

6000|$|At Nantua, a sordid town, with a squalid inn, we dined, at two, deliciously, on a {{red shrimp}} soup; no, not soup, it was a potage; no, a stew; no, a creamy, {{unctuous}} mess, muss, or <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> please to <b>call</b> <b>it.</b> Sancho Panza never ate his olla podrida with more relish.

60|$|Very often, of course, the {{rambling}} and disjointed humorous story finishes with a nub, point, snapper, or <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> like to <b>call</b> <b>it.</b> Then {{the listener}} must be alert, for {{in many cases}} the teller will divert attention from that nub by dropping it in a carefully casual and indifferent way, with the pretence that he does not know it is a nub.|$|R
