50|$|The batsmen who bat at {{positions}} 3, 4 and 5 in {{the order}} are sometimes the most technically proficient batsmen with the best stroke play.

I still remember that so vividly. The word was going around town that Hollywood was coming to Miramar, where I was stationed, {{and they were going}} to do a movie, and we were all kind of excited. My squadron had just gotten back from a seven-and-a-half-month cruise about a week and a half before, so our airplanes were at home, we were available, we weren't too highly tasked. And it turned out they picked my squadron to supply the F-14s.Then the skipper got together and tried to pick four guys that he thought, were mature enough, I guess, to handle, you know, the capability that they were being given in working with the movie, and all the things that were required. And the director wanted to have a small cadre of people that he could work with so you develop an understanding of what the movie folks want versus what we can do and how to try and balance those two requirements.The flying was incredible. You know, most Navy pilots don't get to buzz the tower like in the movie - if you did you could just peel your wings off and, throw 'em at the door because you probably wouldn't be flying anymore - but, since it was Hollywood, you know, they wanted the scene. I had to buzz the tower. And, of course, they wanted nine different takes - so we did it nine times! ...|$|E

To feed his hungry sister Shankar steals a bread {{from a nearby}} tea stall, at the same there is another orphan ( [...] Kalyan Chakravarthy) boy who is also hungry looking at them, Shankar gives him a piece of bread. Shankar takes up the responsibility of raising his younger sister and also the orphan. Shankar does everything possible to earn bread and butter for them, and slowly he transforms from a small-time thief to a small-time gang leader. During this time he helps a village near by, who treats him like god. Once he bashes up Dada's (Kaikala Satyanarayana) men, an impressed Dada offers him {{to work for him}}. But Shankar rejects to work for him but when dada offers him partnership then he accepts the proposal. Apart from crime Shankar is also a good dancer and he teaches dancing too, Radha is a big fan of him. She falls in love with him to sing a couple of quick duets. Shankar realizes that Revati is in love with Kalyan Chakravarthy and he does their wedding. Kalyan Chakravarthy becomes a police officer with the help of Shankar, in one of the crimes he gets some info regarding Dada's involvement. Kalyan Chakravarthy asks Shankar's help in eliminating Dada's group without knowing that Shankar is a partner in the same crime syndicate. Then Shankar decides to quit Dada's company and conveys the same to Dada. Dada accepts the proposal but he says that he is not responsible if his brother in law dies in his hands. So Shankar drops the idea of leaving Dada's company, Dada makes him the head of the syndicate. Raghu Varan and Mohan Babu are not happy with this, so they talk another gang to eliminate Shankar and Dada. Meanwhile, Kalyan Chakravarthy and Revathi comes to know that Shankar is criminal, they question him on that front. He tries to explain what scenarios led him to this. But they leave him. Mohan Babu, Raghu Varan and their new gang attacks and kills Dada and villagers whom Shankar helps. Angry Shankar kills all goons and surrenders himself to his brother in law. This film did not do very well but had good collections due to chiranjevi's prowess action and energetic dance, this is the only movie in the combination Chiranjeevi and Dasari.

40|$|Based on {{the data}} shared by Kansas {{geological}} survey, the analysis of logging parameters from the wells located in nearby Counties Russell and Ellis located in the Kansas State, USA was performed. These counties have the similar geological structure. Data obtained in Kansas geological survey were processed to delete the gaps and other inconsistent readings. Then the correlation matrixes were calculated showing correlation between shallow, medium and deep logging in each well. Correlation matrixes demonstrated significant correlation between medium and deep logging, and medium and shallow logging because of similar geological structure. Ellis County is located at higher elevation than Russell County hence <b>well</b> <b>top</b> in Ellis County is at the higher elevation than <b>well</b> <b>top</b> in Russell County. We determined the depth shift, for which the maximum correlation between logging parameters in both wells (in Russell and Ellis Counties) was observed. In addition, the correlation coefficients for the same logging parameters in two wells were received. The strongest correlation coefficient of up to 0. 425 was obtained between medium logging in two wells.

The data set {{used in this study}} comprising three seismic attributes and well log data from eight wells, is acquired from a western onshore hydrocarbon field of India. Firstly, the acquired data set is integrated and normalized. Then, well log analysis and segmentation of the total depth range into three different units (zones) separated by <b>well</b> <b>tops</b> are carried out. Secondly, three different networks are trained corresponding to three different zones using combined data set of seven wells and then trained networks are validated using the remaining test well. The target property of the test well is predicted using three different tuned networks corresponding to three zones; and then the estimated values obtained from three different networks are concatenated to represent the predicted log along the complete depth range of the testing well. The application of multiple simpler networks instead of a single one improves the prediction accuracy in terms of performance metrics such as correlation coefficient, root mean square error, absolute error mean and program execution time.
