40|$|Spatial prepositions work as {{pointers}} {{to localize}} objects in space. For instance “The book {{is over the}} table ” indicates that <b>the</b> located object (<b>LO)</b> is somewhere “over ” the reference object (RO). To understand where <b>the</b> <b>LO</b> is people need to assign direction to space (selecting a reference frame). Three experiments are reported which investigated the reference frame conflict between LO and RO. We found that when <b>the</b> <b>LO</b> was not vertically aligned, the appropriateness for a given spatial preposition (above, below, over and under) changes. In general scenes <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>LO</b> pointing at <b>the</b> RO were judged less acceptable than scenes <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>LO</b> vertically oriented. These results suggest that reference frames for both LO and RO are accessed before direction can be assigned for spatial prepositions. Modifications to Multiple Frame Activation theory (Carlson-Radvansky & Irwin, 1994) are discussed...|$|R
