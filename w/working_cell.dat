5000|$|On Oct 6, 2007, Craig Venter {{announced}} {{in an interview}} with UK's The Guardian newspaper that the same team had synthesized {{a modified version of the}} single chromosome of Mycoplasma genitalium using chemicals. The chromosome was modified to eliminate all genes which tests in live bacteria had shown to be unnecessary. The next planned step in this minimal genome project is to transplant the synthesized minimal genome into a bacterial cell with its old DNA removed; the resulting bacterium will be called Mycoplasma laboratorium. The next day the Canadian bioethics group, ETC Group issued a statement through their representative, Pat Mooney, saying Venter's [...] "creation" [...] was [...] "a chassis on which you could build almost anything".

40|$|A large {{renewable}} energy integration {{needs to be}} coupled with a low cost energy storage technology. One of the promising energy storage alternatives for the commercial market segment is the hydrogen bromine flow battery. Although the technology has been explored since 1980, {{the development of the}} hydrogen bromine flow battery system is still in the research phase due to the system complexity, the safety aspect, and technical problems. The literature review revealed that costs of the system and electricity are highly dependent on the system’s lifetime. The main problem is the chemicals crossover problem, which leads to catalyst blockages, decreasing performance and system failure. A cost-driven hydrogen flow battery needs to be developed with a simplified design and abundant materials and the development of the first <b>working</b> <b>cell</b> is an important milestone to achieve a cost competitive hydrogen bromine flow battery. In the experimental part, ex-situ experiments were done to select the most suitable membrane for a hydrogen bromine flow battery and in-situ experiments were done to develop the first <b>working</b> <b>cell</b> and to find the effect of operating parameters. It was found that B- 5018 membrane offers the best performance- selectivity trade-off while C- 5011 membrane promises a better performance- selectivity trade-off than B- 5018 membrane when it is coupled with bromine complexing agents. The first <b>working</b> <b>cell</b> was successfully developed with a peak power of 96 mW/cm 2 and an open circuit voltage of 1. 025 Volt. However, the cell performance could not be increased with an elevated electrolyte’s flow rate, hydrogen gas pressure or operating temperature. The observed main problem of a relatively low cell performance was the mass transport limitation of the bromine. It was also found that the use of stainless steel connectors in a hydrogen bromine battery’s system is not possible...|$|E

40|$|Commercial 6. 8 Ah {{lithium-ion}} {{cells with}} different ageing/status {{have been abused}} by external heating in an oven. Prior to the abuse test, selected cells were aged either by C/ 2 cycling up to 300 cycles or stored at 60 °C. Gas emissions were measured by FTIR and three separate vents were identified, two well before the thermal runaway while the third occurred simultaneously with the thermal runaway releasing heavy smoke and gas. Emissions of toxic carbon monoxide (CO), hydrogen fluoride (HF) and phosphorous oxyfluoride (POF 3) were detected in the third vent, regardless {{if there was a}} fire or not. All abused cells went into thermal runaway and emitted smoke and gas, the <b>working</b> <b>cells</b> also released flames as well as sparks. The dead cells were however less reactive but still underwent thermal runaway. For about half of the <b>working</b> <b>cells,</b> for all levels of cycle ageing, ignition of the accumulated battery released gases occurred about 15 s after the thermal runaway resulting in a gas explosion. The thermal runaway temperature, about 190 °C, varied somewhat for the different cell ageing/status where a weak local minimum was found for cells cycled between 100 and 200 times...|$|R

The key idea is when cells in the array fail, using spare cells replace them, with no change of the normal cells. This self-repairing strategy contains three parts, that is, an array of <b>working</b> <b>cells,</b> a layer of spare cells and a control layer. The theoretical analysis and simulation results show the new single-cell replacement strategy has the following advantages: easier implementation and largest self-healing capacity...|$|R

40|$|Organic {{nitriles}} stabilize acidic aqueous copper(I) sulphate solutions. Electrolysis of such solutions {{provides an}} alternative for the electrowinning and electrorefining of copper. The Cu+/CuO and Cu 2 +/Cu+ standard reduction potentials in aqueous solutions containing acetonitrile or 3 -hydroxy-propanenitrile (hydracrylonitrile) {{differ from those}} in water, due to the specific solvation and stabilization of the copper(I) ion by either nitrile. In the mixed solvent, the solvation sphere around the copper(I) ion contains organic nitrile, rather than water, and this reduces the mobility of Cu+ and slows its diffusion to the electrode surface in a <b>working</b> <b>cell.</b> The copper(II) ion contains water in its solvation shell in the mixed solvent. Thus for dilute solutions, the diffusion coefficient of the copper(I) ion in 10 mole % aqueous acetonitrile is about two-thirds and in 10 % 3 - hydroxypropane-nitrile-water is about one-fifth that of the copper(II) ion in water. In concentrated solutions containing sulphuric acid, the copper(II) ion diffuses as ion pairs and this reduces its mobility. This effect is not observed for copper(I) ions. Cell voltages measured during the electrolysis of copper(I) sulphate solutions by using soluble copper, insoluble platinum or insoluble carbon anodes are analysed {{in terms of the}} ohmic resistance, the equilibrium potential, the charge-transfer overpotential and the diffusion polarization of the <b>working</b> <b>cell.</b> There is a significant charge-transfer overpotential for the oxidation of Cu+ to Cu 2 + at an insoluble graphite anode in 6 mol dm- 3 acetonitrile-water solutions; the rate constant is 4 x 10 - 4 cm s- 1.
