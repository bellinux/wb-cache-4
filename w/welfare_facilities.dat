5|$|Despite {{the shift}} in policy from {{educational}} assimilation to integration, the removal of Indigenous children from their families by state officials continued {{through much of the}} 1960s and 70s. The removals were the result of the 1951 addition of Section 88 to the Indian Act, which allowed for the application of provincial laws to Indigenous peoples living on reserves in instances where federal laws were not in place. The change included the monitoring of child welfare. With no requirement for specialized training regarding the traditions or lifestyles of the communities they entered, provincial officials assessed the welfare of Indigenous children based on Euro-Canadian values that, for example, deemed traditional diets of game, fish and berries insufficient and grounds for taking children into custody. This period resulted in the widespread removal of Indigenous children from their traditional communities, first termed the Sixties Scoop by Patrick Johnston, the author of the 1983 report Native Children and the Child Welfare System. Often taken without the consent of their parents or community elders, some children were placed in state-run child <b>welfare</b> <b>facilities,</b> increasingly operated in former residential schools, while others were fostered or placed up for adoption by predominantly non-Indigenous families throughout Canada and the United States. While the Indian and Northern Affairs estimates that 11,132 children were adopted between 1960 and 1990, the actual number may be as high as 20,000.|$|E

2500|$|As well as {{representation}} on a corporation's {{board of}} directors, or top management, employees have sought binding rights (for instance, over working time, break arrangement, and layoffs) in their organizations through elected work councils. After the National War Labor Board {{was established by}} the Woodrow Wilson administration, firms established work councils with some rights throughout the 1920s. Frequently, however, management refused to concede the [...] "right to employ and discharge, {{the direction of the}} working forces, and the management of the business" [...] in any way, which from the workforce perspective defeated the object. As the US presidency changed to the Republican party during the 1920s, work [...] "councils" [...] were often instituted by employers that did not have free elections or proceedings, to forestall independent labor unions' right to collective bargaining. For this reason, the National Labor Relations Act of 1935 §158(a)(2) ensured it was an unfair labor practice for an employer [...] "to dominate or interfere with the formation or administration of any labor organization, or contribute financial or other support to it". This was designed to enable free work councils, genuinely independent from management, but not dominated work councils or so called [...] "company unions". For example, a work council law was passed by the US government in Allied-occupied Germany called Control Council Law, No 22. This empowered German workers to organize work councils if elected by democratic methods, with secret ballots, using participation of free labor unions, with basic functions ranging from how to apply collective agreements, regulating health and safety, rules for engagements, dismissals and grievances, proposals for improving work methods, and organizing social and <b>welfare</b> <b>facilities.</b> These rules were subsequently updated and adopted in German law, although American employees themselves did not yet develop a practice of bargaining for work councils, nor did states implement work council rules, even though neither were preempted by the National Labor Relations Act of 1935. In 1992, the National Labor Relations Board in its Electromation, Inc, and EI du Pont de Nemours, decisions confirmed that while management dominated councils were unlawful, genuine and independent work councils would not be. The Dunlop Report in 1994 produced an inconclusive discussion that favored experimentation with work councils. A Republican Congress did propose a Teamwork for Employees and Managers Act of 1995 to repeal §158(a)(2), but this was vetoed by President Bill Clinton as it would have enabled management dominated unions and councils. In 2014, workers at the Volkswagen Chattanooga Assembly Plant, in Chattanooga, Tennessee, sought to establish a work council. This was initially supported by management, but its stance changed in 2016, after the United Auto Workers succeeded in winning a ballot for traditional representation in an exclusive bargaining unit. As it stands, employees have no widespread right to vote in American workplaces, which has increased the gap between political democracy and traditional labor law goals of workplace and economic democracy.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: <b>Welfare</b> {{sanitary}} <b>facilities</b> {{are important}} for the health, safety and well-being of workers. According to the literature, workers world-wide, and Zambia in particular, might be exposed to poor provisions of <b>welfare</b> sanitary <b>facilities</b> in workplaces. This study therefore aimed to assess provision of <b>welfare</b> sanitary <b>facilities</b> for market traders of Lusaka district and their perception on the provided <b>facilities.</b> <b>Welfare</b> sanitary <b>facilities</b> {{are important for}} the health of both the traders and their customers. Methods and materials: A cross sectional study was carried out in Lusaka district that involved 12 markets run by the city council. Data on provided <b>welfare</b> sanitary <b>facilities</b> and perception of market traders on the provided facilities were collected through interviews of 12 market heads and 386 market traders using systematic interview guides and workplace observations using a checklist. In addition, a total of 22 samples of water were collected: two samples from each market to determine the bacteriological standards of drinking water. A total of 44 water analysis tests were conducted using membrane filtration technique, 22 for Total Coliform and another 22 for Faecal Coliform. SPSS was used both in data entry and analysis. Descriptive statistics such as frequencies, proportions and means were obtained from the analysis. Tests of associations between variables were also conducted using Chi-square, Fisher's exact test and ANOVA. Results: The study established that <b>welfare</b> sanitary <b>facilities</b> were not provided in all markets as one out of 12 markets did not have any <b>welfare</b> sanitary <b>facilities</b> for traders. The majority of the markets did not comply with the laws of Zambia in terms of adequacy of toilets (11); hand washing facilities (10) and cleanliness (six). None of the markets complied with privacy of facilities and siting of sanitary facilities at appropriate distance from the stalls. Not all water provided for market traders complied with the Food and Drugs Act of Zambia's requirements as water from two markets was contaminated with Faecal and Total coliform. Most of the traders perceived facilities as not being up to standard in terms of adequacy of toilets (73. 1 %); hand washing facilities (60. 1 %), cleanliness (78. 2 %) and privacy (72. 0 %). Most of the traders (69. 2 %) only used the facilities because they did not have any other option. Conclusion: There is generally poor provision of <b>welfare</b> sanitary <b>facilities</b> for market traders in Lusaka district, Zambia. These results call for action by the various stakeholders to ensure that the health of the traders is protected...|$|R
