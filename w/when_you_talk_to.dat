500|$|The win {{marked the}} second time in {{franchise}} history that the Bears won their first two games after trailing in the fourth quarter, the first being in 1971. During halftime, the team honored the 1963 Bears, two days following the death of running back Rick Casares, who was the team's leading rusher until Walter Payton surpassed him. When asked about Casares, defensive end Ed O'Bradovich stated, [...] "Oh my God, I think <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> my fellow teammates over here, what was all right, true and good about professional football was embodied in Rick Casares. Nobody loved the game more than him." ...|$|E
2500|$|On September 10, 2006, Ali was {{endorsed}} by The Washington Post which one county political veteran ranked as only behind that of the Democratic Party for its influence on local voters. The Post said “Political newcomer Saqib Ali has shown good command of issues and would bring new vigor to this district's delegation.” [...] On September Sept. 20, 2006, it was announced Ali had won the Democratic primary in Maryland's 39th Legislative District, defeating incumbent Delegate Joan F. Stern {{for a position on}} the slate with Del's Nancy J. King and Charles E. Barkley for the November general election. Stern had lost the outright endorsement of King and Barkley as she was not seen as a team-player. King noted that [...] "Ali was a 'breath of fresh air' to voters", while political veteran Gene Counihan said [...] "As far as I could see, he followed the book on how to win an election. I saw him on the campaign trail more than anybody. He was out door-to-door; he had impressive literature. He wanted it." [...] Ali ascribed his electoral victory to connecting with voters. [...] "Our campaign had a lot of energy. It had that underdog feel that struck a chord with people and resonated. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> real voters, not the insiders, they care if you pay attention to them. They remember that you listened to them. People appreciate new blood." ...|$|E

6000|$|This extorted nervous shrieks {{from both}} of them. The Colonel heard a sound of scurrying feet, whisking drapery, and {{slamming}} doors.

6000|$|Clavering {{contrived}} to {{meet his}} gaze, though it was difficult. [...] "I was very unwilling to mention it," [...] he said.

I don't know who your father was,--whether he was an Englishman, whether he was a Christian, whether he was a Protestant,--not even whether he was a gentleman. These are {{questions}} which I should not dream of asking under any other circumstances;--would be matters with which I should have no possible concern, if you were simply an acquaintance.

60|$|DOCTOR. [Sitting {{down and}} {{lighting}} a cigar.] Well, yes. The Duke does suffer a little from absence [puts his cigar {{in his mouth}} and pulls during the pause] of mind. He is all for compromise. Don't you know the kind of man who, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him about the five best breeds of dog, always ends up by buying a mongrel? The Duke is the kindest of men, and always trying to please everybody. He generally finishes by pleasing nobody.|$|E
6000|$|... "Some one get cheated!" [...] he exclaimed, laughing. [...] "Every {{one gets}} cheated, {{as you call}} it, if they haven't enough sense to know what their property's worth, {{and how to use}} it to the best advantage. It's a case," [...] he announced, [...] "of the {{survival}} of the fittest. Which reminds me that if I'm going to be fit to-morrow I'd better go to bed.

6000|$|... "I thank you," [...] {{said the}} doctor, with some dignity. [...] "I {{think you will}} trust him <b>when</b> <b>you</b> have <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> him a little.

6000|$|LUBIN. I {{think you}} {{fall into the}} very common mistake of supposing that it is poverty that makes the proletarian and money that makes the gentleman. You are quite wrong. You never belonged to the people: you belonged to the impecunious. Impecuniosity and broken boots are the lot of the {{unsuccessful}} middle class, and the commonplaces of the early struggles of the professional and younger son class. I defy you to find a farm laborer in England with broken boots. Call a mechanic one of the poor, and he'll punch your head. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> your constituents about the toiling millions, they don't consider that you are referring to them.

6000|$|The {{third time}} around he {{discovered}} {{me in the}} midst of one of his antics. He was so surprised that he fell down. In a second he was up again, sitting up very straight on his haunches just in front of me, paws crossed, ears erect, eyes shining in fear and curiosity. [...] "Who are you?" [...] he was saying, as plainly as ever rabbit said it. Without moving a muscle I tried to tell him, and also that he need not be afraid. Perhaps he began to understand, for he turned his head on one side, just as a dog does <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him. But he wasn't quite satisfied. [...] "I'll try my scare on him," [...] he thought; and thump! thump! thump! sounded his padded hind foot on the soft ground. It almost made me start again, it sounded so big in the dead stillness. This last test quite convinced him that I was harmless, and, after a moment's watching, away he went in some astonishing jumps into the forest.|$|E
6000|$|... "Katharine Hilbery," [...] he repeated, with {{a curious}} little chuckle. [...] "No, Denham, I have {{no illusions about}} that young woman. I think I made that plain to her to-night. But don't run away with a false impression," [...] he {{continued}} eagerly, turning and linking his arm through Denham's, as though {{to prevent him from}} escaping; and, thus compelled, Denham passed the monitory lamp-post, to which, in passing, he breathed an excuse, for how could he break away when Rodney's arm was actually linked in his? [...] "You must not think that I have any bitterness against her--far from it. It's not altogether her fault, poor girl. She lives, you know, one of those odious, self-centered lives--at least, I think them odious for a woman--feeding her wits upon everything, having control of everything, getting far too much her own way at home--spoilt, in a sense, feeling that every one is at her feet, and so not realizing how she hurts--that is, how rudely she behaves to people who haven't all her advantages. Still, to do her justice, she's no fool," [...] he added, as if to warn Denham not to take any liberties. [...] "She has taste. She has sense. She can understand you <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> her. But she's a woman, and there's an end of it," [...] he added, with another little chuckle, and dropped Denham's arm.|$|E
