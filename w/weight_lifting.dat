5|$|Trauma, {{rather than}} {{avascular}} necrosis, {{is thought to}} cause osteochondritis dissecans in juveniles. In adults, trauma {{is thought to be}} the main or perhaps the sole cause, and may be endogenous, exogenous or both. The incidence of repetitive strain injury in young athletes is on the rise and accounts for a significant number of visits to primary care; this reinforces the theory that OCD may be associated with increased participation in sports and subsequent trauma. High-impact sports such as gymnastics, soccer, basketball, lacrosse, football, tennis, squash, baseball and <b>weight</b> <b>lifting</b> may put participants at a higher risk of OCD in stressed joints (knees, ankles and elbows).|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} and fall of 2011, several renovations took place, {{affecting}} primarily the high school. All front-facing windows of the high school were replaced with energy-efficient windows, and a permanent-storage building was constructed on the northeast side to store auditorium and maintenance supplies. In addition, many of the computers in the school were replaced with thin client computers. In 2013, the school's cardiovascular and <b>weight</b> <b>lifting</b> center was improved with more machines and equipment, increased space, new flat screen televisions, and other additions. In 2013 and 2014, the school's fields on the property were remediated due to the use of contaminated fill. The football field was completed with artificial turf, as well as the track and artificial turf baseball field; an artificial turf hockey field was to be completed by Labor Day. The lower soccer field will be reconstructed after the fall 2014 soccer season. Work on the softball field was finished in fall 2013. A security plan is to be submitted to the New York State Education Department; it includes plans to upgrade the main entrance doors and construct vestibules and greeter stations.|$|E

They divorced two years later, and after six years Mancera married Magnolia, {{with whom he had}} two children, Miguel and Leonardo. After a decade, he divorced Magnolia. Mancera has a daughter out of wedlock, but he has said the child's mother does not want Mancera to see her. In September 2007, two assailants on a motorcycle intercepted and attempted to rob him while he drove his BMW in Perif√©rico Sur. His bodyguard intervened and shot one of the robbers, killing him. From 2008 to 2009, Mancera dated Alejandra Barrales, who was the president of the PRD party at that time, and also she intended to become the PRD candidate for Mayor of Mexico City in 2012. In his spare time, he practices multiple sports, including Krav Maga, indoor cycling and <b>weight</b> <b>lifting,</b> hunting and aviation. On October 31, 2014, Mancera had a cardiac surgery because three months before a cardiac arrhythmia was detected. During the surgery, he had a cardiac perforation. He recovered two weeks later.|$|E

40|$|Background and Purpose. This {{study was}} {{designed}} to determine whether the maximum weight that can be lifted during 33 % to 67 % of a workday (<b>weight</b> <b>lifted</b> frequently) can be accurately predicted from other data gathered during a functional capacity evaluation (FCE). The best equations for estimating <b>weight</b> <b>lifted</b> frequently were also identified, and the interrater reliability for measurements obtained during a &day FCE was calculated. Subjects. A retrospective chart audit was conducted of clients (36 female, 93 male) who completed 22 -hour FCEs during a 6 day period. Ninety subjects had spinal problems, and 39 subjects had injuries not involving the spine. Subjects were ran-do~nly assigned to a model estimation group (n= 109) or a cross-validation group (n = 20). Method. A stepwise multiple regression analysis identified the best predictors of <b>weight</b> <b>lifted</b> frequently, with subjects lifting from four different heights. The resulting equations were used to predict the weight for the cross-validation group, and predicted weights were compared with observed weights using t tests and correlation coefficients. Results. Regression equations explained between 27. 3 % and 93. 0 % of the variance in weight, with standard errors of estimation between 1. 09 and 5. 72. No differences between the mean observed and predicted scores were found when estimates were based on <b>weight</b> onlv occasionally <b>lifted</b> (maximum <b>weight</b> that could be lifted up to 33 % of a workday). Conclusion and Discussion. Estimates of <b>weight</b> <b>lifted</b> frequently based on <b>weight</b> <b>lifted</b> occasionally can be made, but the usef~ilness of these estimates is questionable. Clinicians should use caution when using estimations of <b>weight</b> <b>lifted</b> for return-towork recommendations. [Saunders RL, Beissner KL, McManis BG.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} {{the value of a}} measure of catastrophizing as a predictor of activity intolerance in response to delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS). A sample of 50 (17 men, 33 women) sedentary undergraduates participated in an exercise protocol designed to induce muscle soreness and were asked to return 2 days later to perform the same physical maneuvres. Participants performed five strength exercises that emphasized the eccentric component of the muscle contraction in order to induce DOMS. Dependent variables of interest were the proportion reduction in total <b>weight</b> <b>lifted,</b> and the number of repetitions. Analyses revealed that catastrophizing, assessed prior to the first exercise bout, was significantly correlated with negative mood, pain and with reduction in <b>weight</b> <b>lifted.</b> Regression analyses revealed that catastrophizing predicted reductions in <b>weight</b> <b>lifted</b> even after controlling for pain and negative mood. These findings extend previous research in demonstrating that catastrophizing is associated with objective indices of activity intolerance associated with pain.
