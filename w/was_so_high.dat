Through the regulations, the {{airlines}} {{had agreed to}} fly to unprofitable airports, in exchange for making higher profits on other routes. With free competition, {{this would not be}} followed, and the authorities announced the introduction of public service obligations on routes that were not profitable. To finance these, a NOK10 fee would be charged on all primary routes. The cost of collecting this fee <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>high</b> that SAS and Braathens SAFE announced it was cheaper to continue to fly to the unprofitable airports. Braathens SAFE stated that their routes Haugesund–Bergen and Oslo–Røros–Trondheim were not profitable.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the final}} orchestral crescendo, the song ends {{with one of}} the most famous final chords in music history. Overdubbed in place of the vocal {{experiment}} from 10 February, this chord was added during a session at EMI's Studio Two on 22 February. Lennon, McCartney, Starr and Evans shared three different pianos, with Martin on a harmonium, and all played an E-major chord simultaneously. The chord was made to ring out for over forty seconds by increasing the recording sound level as the vibration faded out. Towards the end of the chord the recording level <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>high</b> that listeners can hear the sounds of the studio, including rustling papers and a squeaking chair.|$|E
5|$|Goldfingers $3 {{million budget}} was recouped in two weeks, and it broke box office records in {{multiple}} {{countries around the}} world. The Guinness Book of World Records went on to list Goldfinger as the fastest grossing film of all time. Demand for the film <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>high</b> that the DeMille cinema in New York City had to stay open twenty-four hours a day. The film closed its original box office run having grossed $23 million in the United States and $46 million worldwide. After reissues, the first being as a double feature with Dr. No in 1966, Goldfinger grossed a total of $51,081,062 in the United States and $73,800,000 elsewhere, for a total worldwide gross of $124,900,000.|$|E

5|$|Silver, he writes, {{does not}} occur in native form {{and has to be}} mined, usually {{occurring}} with lead ores. Spain produced the most silver in his time, many of the mines having been started by Hannibal. One of the largest had galleries running up to two miles into the mountain, while men worked day and night draining the mine in shifts. Pliny is probably referring to the reverse overshot water-wheels operated by treadmill and found in Roman mines. Britain, he says, is very rich in lead, which is found on the surface at many places, and thus very easy to extract; production <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>high</b> that a law was passed attempting to restrict mining.|$|E

On April 26, the Mint reported that it had sold 122,510 units, just 2,490 pieces away from the item's maximum allowable mintage. The remainder, which included about as many as 8,000 to 9,000 coins that were unsold or returned to the mint from prior sales, were offered for sale on December 15, 2016, with a limit of one per customer, and sold out within 90 minutes.|$|E
5|$|This {{increase}} in population caused many adverse effects.

Electric demand <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>high</b> that the power company advised homeowners to buy generators to cope with frequent brownouts. Home prices skyrocketed—a home that sold for $40,000 in 1974 was purchased for $80,000 in 1975. Home and apartment rentals were correspondingly squeezed upward by the rising prices and the demand from pipeline workers. Two-room log cabins with no plumbing rented for $500 per month. One two-bedroom home housed 45 pipeline workers who shared beds on a rotating schedule for $40 per week.|$|E

By 1758 the population had risen to 88 and reached just under 100 {{by the end of the}} century. This figure remained fairly constant from the 18th century until 1851, when 36 islanders emigrated to Australia on board the Priscilla, a loss from which the island never fully recovered. The emigration was in part a response to the laird's closure of the church and manse for several years during the Disruption that created the Free Church of Scotland.|$|E
5|$|Although Mold {{appeared}} for the North {{against the}} Australians, who toured again in 1896, {{he did not}} play any Tests or other representative cricket that year and his wicket total fell to 150 at 18.12; after this season, his bowling began to decline in effectiveness. Suffering frequently from injury in 1897, Mold failed to reach 100 wickets in the season for the first time. His 90 wickets in 1898 were taken at an average over 20, the only time his bowling average <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>high,</b> and he missed three {{weeks of the season}} owing to injury. After improving his record to 115 wickets at 18.68 during 1899, he was awarded a benefit match by Lancashire during 1900 which raised £2,050, a record total at the time and worth around £173,000 in 2010.|$|E

During the war years the company was misled by a trade union such that it paid its male fitters, who were supervising female war workers, an increased wage of 48 shillings per week. The union told the company it was the rate paid for similar work at Armstrong Whitworth, when it was not.|$|E

American Pharoah's popularity <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>high</b> that his win made the cover of Sports Illustrated, he was photographed for Vogue, and during the NBA Playoffs, the coach of the Golden State Warriors, Steve Kerr, suggested that American Pharoah was the only athlete better than LeBron James.|$|E
5|$|For {{much of its}} {{existence}} the Court was formally led by the Lord Chancellor, assisted by the judges of the common law courts. The staff of the court included {{a large number of}} clerks, led by the Master of the Rolls, who regularly heard cases on his own. In 1813 a Vice-Chancellor was appointed to deal with the Chancery's increasing backlogs, and two more were appointed in 1841. Offices of the Chancery were sold by the Lord Chancellor for much of its history, raising large amounts of money. Many of the clerks and other officials were sinecures who, in lieu of wages, charged increasingly exorbitant fees to process cases, {{one of the main reasons}} why the cost of bringing a case to the Chancery <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>high.</b> The 19th century saw the abolition of many sinecure offices and the institution of a wage and pension for the Lord Chancellor to curb the sale of offices, and later the right to appoint officials was transferred from the Chancellor to the Crown.|$|E
5|$|In April 1944, {{experiments}} by Emilio G.

This has a far higher spontaneous fission rate than plutonium-239. The cyclotron-produced material on which the original measurements had been made had much lower traces of plutonium-240. Its inclusion in reactor-bred plutonium appeared unavoidable. This meant that the spontaneous fission rate of the reactor plutonium <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>high</b> that it would be highly likely that it would predetonate and blow itself apart during the initial formation of a critical mass. The distance required to accelerate the plutonium to speeds where predetonation would be less likely would need a gun barrel too long for any existing or planned bomber. The only way to use plutonium in a workable bomb was thus implosion — a far more difficult engineering task.|$|E

5|$|The 1942 Papuan {{campaign}} {{threw up}} {{a host of}} serious medical problems. The poor diet, mainly caused by the difficulty of supply by air or over jungle tracks, caused malnutrition and vitamin deficiencies. Poor hygiene led to dysentery. Malaria was hyperendemic, and when Fairley and Mackerras visited Papua in June 1942 they found high rates of infection among the troops even before the fighting had begun. At Milne Bay the incidence <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>high</b> in September 1942 {{that it looked like}} the garrison would be wiped out in a matter of months. The biggest killer, though, was typhus. Of the 2,839 soldiers who came down with it, 257 (9 percent) died. It fell to Burston promulgate the policies and practices that diminished the danger from disease and allowed the Australian Army to fight in New Guinea.|$|E

5|$|The chronicles of Genesios and Theophanes Continuatus (and {{following}} them Skylitzes and Zonaras), however, {{report that he}} survived his wounds, allegedly being miraculously cured after renouncing iconoclasm {{at the behest of}} some monks. The same sources report that after Theophilos's death, he assumed the overall command of the Byzantine army and was appointed a member of the regency council for the infant new emperor Michael III (r. 842–867) along with Theoktistos and Bardas. His standing <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>high</b> that the populace is said to have acclaimed him as emperor at the Hippodrome, but he refused to accept the post. The same writers report that he {{played an important role in}} the restoration of the icons, and that he became a protomagistros before falling out with Theoktistos, being accused of lèse-majesté, and retiring from public life to his estates. According to the same sources, in the late 850s, he saved the Emperor's life in another battle at Anzen and died shortly after. Traditional scholarship has largely accepted this account, but some modern historians have expressed doubts as to its veracity. The Belgian Byzantinist Henri Grégoire was the first to highlight its incompatibility with the narrative of Symeon Logothetes, speculating that it was a later invention, possibly carried out by the monks of the Monastery of Manuel, who venerated him as a saint and tried to mitigate his iconoclast past. Warren Treadgold, who considers Symeon Logothetes more reliable, also dismissed the reports of Manuel's post-838 survival as invented.|$|E
