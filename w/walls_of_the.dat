These spells were intended to help the king in overcoming hostile forces and powers in the Underworld and thus join with the sun god Ra, his divine father in the afterlife.

40|$|Investigations of both {{noise and}} {{aerodynamic}} {{characteristics of a}} centrifugal fan without scroll casing were performed with respect to <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> three parameters : (1) the distance between <b>the</b> leading edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> blades and <b>the</b> inner <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mouthpiece, (2) the gap between <b>the</b> outer <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bellmouth and <b>the</b> inner <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mouthpiece and (3) the geometry at <b>the</b> outlet <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bellmouth. A formula was determined to predict the sound pressure level of turbulent noise from a centrifugal fan without scroll casing. It was shown that the total pressure and efficiency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fan was reduced as the distance between <b>the</b> leading edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> blades and <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mouthpiece increased. If the geometry at <b>the</b> outlet <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bellmouth was straight, the sound pressure level appeared in <b>the</b> neighbourhood <b>of</b> 1. 5 kHz and specific noise level was reduced as the gap between <b>the</b> outer <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bellmouth and <b>the</b> inner <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mouthpiece decreased.

5|$|A {{good example}} of {{convergence}} in plants is the evolution of edible fruits such as apples. These pomes incorporate (five) carpels and their accessory tissues forming the apple's core, surrounded by structures from outside the botanical fruit, the receptacle or hypanthium. Other edible fruits include other plant tissues; for example, the fleshy part of a tomato is the <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pericarp. This implies convergent evolution under selective pressure, {{in this case the}} competition for seed dispersal by animals through consumption of fleshy fruits.|$|E
5|$|A granite wall {{surrounds}} the temple, enclosing all its shrines and six of its seven bodies of water. The rajagopuram, the temple's gateway tower, is unfinished. A swastika shaped temple tank built in 800 AD by Kamban Araiyan {{during the reign}} of Dantivarman is outside the temple complex. The Vijayanagar and Nayak kings commissioned paintings on the <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shrine of Pudarikakshan, some of which are still present.|$|E
5|$|After it {{fell into}} disuse during the Bronze Age, Maeshowe was re-opened and used centuries later by Vikings from about the 9th to the 12th centuries AD.

5|$|Bats seem to {{make use}} of {{particularly}} strong venomotion, a rhythmic contraction of venous wall muscles. In most mammals, the <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> veins provide mainly passive resistance, maintaining their shape as deoxygenated blood flows through them, but in bats they appear to actively support blood flow back to the heart with this pumping action. Due to their relatively small and lightweight bodies, bats are not at risk of blood flow rushing to their heads when roosting.|$|E
