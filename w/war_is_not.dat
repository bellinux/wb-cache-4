In Central and Eastern Europe, the end of the Cold War has ushered in an era of economic growth and an increase in the number of liberal democracies, while in other parts of the world, such as Afghanistan, independence was accompanied by state failure.|$|E

25|$|Orwell wrote a {{critique}} of George Bernard Shaw's play Arms and the Man. He considered this Shaw's best play and {{the most likely to}} remain socially relevant, because of its theme that <b>war</b> <b>is</b> <b>not,</b> generally speaking, a glorious romantic adventure. His 1945 essay In Defense of P.G. Wodehouse contains an amusing assessment of Wodehouse's writing and also argues that his broadcasts from Germany (during the war) did not really make him a traitor. He accused The Ministry of Information of exaggerating Wodehouse's actions for propaganda purposes.|$|E
25|$|According to Amnesty International, {{the use of}} rape {{during times}} of <b>war</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a {{by-product}} of conflicts, but a pre-planned and deliberate military strategy. The first aim of these mass rapes is to instill terror in the civilian population, {{with the intent to}} forcibly dislocate them from their property. The second aim is to reduce the likelihood of return and reconstitution by inflicting humiliation and shame on the targeted population. These effects are strategically important for non-state actors, as it is necessary for them to remove the targeted population from the land. The use of mass rape is well suited for campaigns which involve ethnic cleansing and genocide, as the objective is to destroy or forcefully remove the target population, and ensure they do not return.|$|E

25|$|Hesiod {{mentions}} {{a poetry}} contest at Chalcis in Euboea where {{the sons of}} one Amphidamas awarded him a tripod (Works and Days 654–662). Plutarch identified this Amphidamas with {{the hero of the}} Lelantine War between Chalcis and Eretria and he concluded that the passage must be an interpolation into Hesiod's original work, assuming that the Lelantine War was too late for Hesiod. Modern scholars have accepted his identification of Amphidamas but disagreed with his conclusion. The date of the <b>war</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> known precisely but estimates placing it around 730–705 BC, fit the estimated chronology for Hesiod. In that case, the tripod that Hesiod won might have been awarded for his rendition of Theogony, a poem that seems to presuppose the kind of aristocratic audience he would have met at Chalcis.|$|E
25|$|In 1984, {{there is}} a {{perpetual}} war between Oceania, Eurasia and Eastasia, the superstates {{that emerged from the}} global atomic war. The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism, by Emmanuel Goldstein, explains that each state is so strong it cannot be defeated, even with the combined forces of two superstates, despite changing alliances. To hide such contradictions, history is rewritten to explain that the (new) alliance always was so; the populaces are accustomed to doublethink and accept it. The <b>war</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> fought in Oceanian, Eurasian or Eastasian territory but in the Arctic wastes and in a disputed zone comprising the sea and land from Tangiers (Northern Africa) to Darwin (Australia). At the start, Oceania and Eastasia are allies fighting Eurasia in northern Africa and the Malabar Coast.|$|E
25|$|These beliefs did {{not become}} widely shared because they offered the only {{accurate}} interpretation of wartime events. In every respect, the war was {{much more complicated than}} they suggest. In recent years, historians have argued persuasively against almost every popular cliché of World War I. It has been pointed out that, although the losses were devastating, their greatest impact was socially and geographically limited. The many emotions other than horror experienced by soldiers {{in and out of the}} front line, including comradeship, boredom, and even enjoyment, have been recognised. The <b>war</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> now seen as a 'fight about nothing', but as a war of ideals, a struggle between aggressive militarism and more or less liberal democracy. It has been acknowledged that British generals were often capable men facing difficult challenges, and that it was under their command that the British army played a major part in the defeat of the Germans in 1918: a great forgotten victory.|$|E

25|$|According to Amnesty International, {{the use of}} rape {{during times}} of <b>war</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a {{by-product}} of conflicts, but a pre-planned and deliberate military strategy. In {{the last quarter of}} a century, the majority of conflicts have shifted from wars between nation states to communal and intrastate civil wars. During these conflicts the use of rape as a weapon against the civilian population by state and non-state actors has become more frequent. Journalists and human rights organizations have documented campaigns of genocidal rape during the conflicts in the Balkans, Sierra Leone, Rwanda, Liberia, Sudan, Uganda, and the DRC. The strategic aim of these mass rapes are twofold. The first is to instill terror in the civilian population, with the intent to forcibly dislocate them from their property. The second is to degrade the chance of possible return and reconstitution by inflicting humiliation and shame on the targeted population. These effects are strategically important for non-state actors, as it is necessary for them to remove the targeted population from the land. Rape as genocide is well suited for campaigns which involve ethnic cleansing and genocide, as the objective is to destroy or forcefully remove the target population, and ensure they do not return.|$|E
25|$|After the {{outbreak}} of the First World War in 1914 the Imperial Russian Navy needed urgently steam and combustion engine propelled cutters. In order to cope with the increased demand, in particular the Russian order, the company built a modern workshop in Uittamo. The older yard got a foundry, sheet metal workshops and other investments. Although the company didn't build steam engines it got an order for eight steam cutters, to be delivered between April and July in the following year. The ships including their engines were produced as subcontracting at the nearby Crichton yard. The largest order of the Russian Navy, 24 motor cutters of 18 metres long, came most likely in early 1916. The vessels were not handed over before the February Revolution. It is assumed that Andrée & Rosenqvist received {{the first quarter of the}} payment, but the remaining part never came. In 1918 the government of the newly independent Finland took possession of the Russian navy vessels, including 70 cutters of various sizes, of which 20 were handed over to Soviet Russia after according to Tartu peace treaty. Presumably Andrée & Rosenqvist got just 250000 marks from the Finnish government for the cutters ordered by Russia. The last bargains with Russia were almost deadly to the company, but it recovered fast after. The total number of cutters delivered to the Imperial Russian Navy during the <b>war</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> known.|$|E

Unfortunately, this advantage seems limited; he orders Balthazar in [...] "My Heart Will Go On" [...] to save the Titanic, spawning 50,000 new souls to empower his side. However, Fate works to undo the impossible births and begins killing them. Once the brothers encounter the string of odd deaths Fate takes this opportunity to eliminate them due to their part of undoing the destined Apocalypse. This forces Castiel to concede the loss and re-sink the Titanic.|$|E

500|$|As Whiteside's brigade disbanded, Atkinson {{organized}} a new force in June 1832 that he dubbed the [...] "Army of the Frontier". The army consisted of 629 regular army infantrymen and 3,196 mounted militia volunteers. The militia {{was divided into}} three brigades commanded by Brigadier Generals Alexander Posey, Milton Alexander, and James D. Henry. Since many men were assigned to local patrols and guard duties, Atkinson had only 450 regulars and 2,100 militiamen available for campaigning. Many more militiamen served in units that {{were not part of}} the Army of the Frontier's three brigades. Abraham Lincoln, for example, reenlisted as a private in an independent company that was taken into federal service. Henry Dodge, a Michigan territorial militia colonel who would prove {{to be one of the}} best commanders in the war, fielded a battalion of mounted volunteers that numbered 250 men at its strongest. The overall number of militiamen who took part in the <b>war</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> precisely known; the total from Illinois alone has been estimated at six to seven thousand.|$|E
500|$|Williams {{believed}} that most {{games on the}} market failed to create a correct representation of the war experience, or express the psychological changes that some combatants experience after participating in a war. He added that a <b>war</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> as straightforward and immature as it is often portrayed in various shooters. As a result, a central theme of the game revolves around the moral aspect of war. By using this theme, the team hoped {{to tell a story}} and provide an experience that feels realistic, covering the combatants' mental changes during and after a military conflict, similar to how movies in the 1970s and 1980s, such as Platoon, Full Metal Jacket and Apocalypse Now convey these messages. The team had the intention to give players the opportunity to show that a shooter can also have a decent story capable of invoking emotions. To achieve this, the team simplified their original story setting of having Konrad as a [...] "megalomaniac with messianic delusions" [...] to a setting that is more similar to Heart of Darkness.|$|E

Fred Opolot, spokesman for the Ugandan government, said, [...] "It is totally misleading {{to suggest that the}} war is still in Uganda." [...] Arthur Larok, ActionAid's director in Uganda, said, [...] "It doesn't sound like a fair representation of Uganda. We have challenges within the country, but certainly the perception of a country at <b>war</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> accurate at all." [...] Dr Beatrice Mpora, director of a community health organization in Gulu, commented, [...] "There has not been a single soul from the LRA here since 2006. Now we have peace, people are back in their homes, they are planting their fields, they are starting their businesses. That is what people should help us with." [...] Prime Minister of Uganda Amama Mbabazi launched an online response on YouTube, in which he seeks to correct the [...] "false impression" [...] that Uganda is still at war, and invites everyone to visit the country, assuring that people would find it [...] "a very different place to that portrayed by Invisible Children". Meanwhile, dozens of members of Ugandan diaspora in United States protested outside the Invisible Children offices in San Diego, also criticizing the video but saying Kony represents [...] "only three percent of all the problems" [...] in their home country and lambasting the Ugandan government for its inadequate response to Kony's terror and other issues.|$|E
500|$|It took 25 days to film, {{requiring}} 500 extras, 600 {{crew members}} and 70 horses. Benioff described {{the difficulty of}} coordinating horses in battle scenes, {{which is why they}} are rarely used except in [...] "big budget war films". Weiss added, [...] "Miguel's really outdone himself. Fully fleshed out medieval battles require a tremendous amount of resources and choreography to get them right. It feels like we're doing something fresh that you don't see on TV and movies very often." [...] Four camera crews were used for the battle scene. The 500 extras were largely the Snow and Bolton armies as Wildlings, archers, swordsmen and spearmen. Each army was trained separately to create off-screen rivalry between the two groups, and visual effects were used to expand the army to thousands. Kristofer Hivju, who plays Tormund Giantsbane, said about the intensity of filming the scenes: [...] "It was pretty intense, actually. When you have 20 people running around getting squeezed together, and you're trying to chop at another bearded guy with a sword, you are not out of danger. You're laying down in the mud, and one wrong step, you won't have a face anymore. It was very intense, and Miguel insisted on making it that muddy and messy. <b>War</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> beautiful. Sometimes you see action sequences where battles seem organized. I know that from how the Vikings fought. It's not beautiful. It's hard. It's hard work. We had to shoot moment-to-moment, chronologically. We would shoot one sequence 80 times per day." ...|$|E
