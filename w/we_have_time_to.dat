I think we have some momentum coming in [...] and I think we pick up on it. I'm optimistic that we can keep the plane in the air a little longer." [...] He also talked {{about whether the}} themes of family and connectedness from the first season would be re-explored in the second, saying [...] "What we always look for are the human elements in the big story. That's what television does well, it makes you care about people, and whether it's literal family or anytime you have a team of people working together, it takes on some sort of family metaphor." [...] Bell reiterated the idea of family following the end of the season, saying [...] "In many ways, the whole metaphor {{at the heart of the}} show is family—you've got Coulson and May and then a bunch of younger people, and it allows us to play out different dynamics; literally, this season, we had Skye's biological parents versus her surrogate parents. And at the same time, we had Skye growing up. We had her going from a slightly sulky hacker season one to training to become an agent to becoming our first full-fledged superhero and so as we grow up, we separate from our parents... In our minds, her mom wasn't a villain so much; she was an antagonist, but if you look at why she feels the way she does, Jiaying really earned that position." [...] Discussing the reveal that Skye is actually Daisy Johnson, Maurissa Tancharoen explained thatJohnson is a character that we always liked. We always knew there was a potential to evolve Skye into something else. It took a little bit of time, but we were happy when we were able to land on Daisy Johnson, and actually have that work in our mythology. But as with everything that we do on the show, we pull from the properties, and we do our own spin to it. So we are kind of merging a few concepts and storylines. We've spent a season and a half with Skye. We've seen her evolve as a person, we've grown to like her as a person, we've seen her evolve as an agent. And now, finally bringing her to her origin story—I think there's just a lot more emotional weight to it, because you already know her as just Skye, and now she will have this ability that she may not understand, that she may not want ... We're going to focus on Skye, and how that affects the people around her, and how the relationships may shift. Because we've seen through the course of our series so far; we've spoken about how S.H.I.E.L.D. treats gifteds or views them, and they're categorized, things like that. What does that mean when one of your own is now considered someone with an ability? How do you categorize her?Whedon elaborated that [...] "We're going to walk her through the steps of discovering what this really means, and coming to terms with it. All that stuff is really interesting to us, and in television, because <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> explore, we can take her origin on all sorts of different paths." [...] Additionally, Whedon talked about how the character would be referred to on the show after the reveal, saying, [...] "She's still Skye, because she thinks she's Skye. I think her dad thinks she's Daisy, and we'll see if she ever gets to the point where she believes that that's something that she would want to call herself. But right now, she has her own identity." ...|$|E

60|$|Then <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> {{look upon}} {{each other more}} at leisure, which <b>we</b> <b>had</b> not done {{for a piece of}} a minute before (upon a common impulse) we shook hands again.|$|R
60|$|That evening, {{on board}} the British gunboat, lighted up by the terrific glare overhead, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> reflect what it all meant, and to feel {{ourselves}} free to think and speak again.|$|R

6000|$|... "Can you not conceal me here till <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> {{think what}} is best to be done?" [...] asked Branwen simply, [...] "for I will die rather than wed this-- this monster Gunrig!" ...|$|E

6000|$|Siona, {{who was now}} {{distinctly}} coquetting with Wayland, {{held out}} her hand. [...] "I hope you'll find <b>time</b> <b>to</b> come up and see us. I know <b>we</b> <b>have</b> other mutual friends, if <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> get at them." ...|$|R
6000|$|When the {{old woman}} had given us {{the address of the}} person who had the letting of the cottage, and Jone and me had gone to our room, I said <b>to</b> him, before <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> sit down: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No they won't," [...] {{interrupted}} the boy; [...] "it's a monstrous big wood they've got {{to pass through}} before they can come here, so <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> {{look at some of}} the 'stonishin' things." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{you need}} not trouble {{yourself}} about your bear," [...] cried my young lady, whose Christian name I soon discovered to be Edith. [...] "He can live on barks and roots until <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> attend to him. He is used to that in his native wilds." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "By Saint George! {{you speak}} the truth," [...] said the King, [...] "for she is ours when <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> take her.

60|$|Before <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> unpack, a note {{came from}} President Roosevelt {{asking me to}} return to Washington to confer on a phase of the Indian service with which I was familiar, and I went at once--glad to be of any service--especially an {{unofficial}} service.|$|R

60|$|It was no {{more than}} natural we should step quickly toward the foot of the ladder, meeting there Master Lord himself, who looked about as if {{surprised}} because we were in darkness, and then, ascending quickly, he returned before <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> follow, bringing with him the smaller lantern.|$|R

6000|$|... "Waiting--waiting--everything is waiting," [...] she whispered. She {{drew her}} hand from his, pressed her clenched fingers against her lips. She {{was lost in the}} somberness. [...] "I am happy--so we must go home, before <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> become unhappy. But can't we sit on a log for a minute and just listen?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Six years old!' said Mr Dombey, {{settling}} his neckcloth--perhaps to hide an irrepressible {{smile that}} rather seemed to strike upon {{the surface of}} his face and glance away, as finding no resting-place, than to play there for an instant. 'Dear me, six will be changed to sixteen, before <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> look about us.' ...|$|E
60|$|We freely {{told them}} so. Zeke was {{exceedingly}} hurt, and said {{everything he could}} think of to alter our determination; but, finding all unavailing, he very hospitably urged us not to be in any hurry about leaving; for we might stay with him as guests until <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> decide upon our future movements.|$|R

"It {{happened}} that <b>we</b> <b>had</b> {{three or four}} fellows away on leave or on staff duty, and several others knocked up with fever just about this time, so that the duty fell very heavily upon the rest of us, and it was over a month before <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> ride over to see the fakir.|$|R

6000|$|... "This {{is a bad}} job," [...] one of them said; [...] "but {{we thought}} that as there were about thirty of us, the Kaffirs wouldn't venture to attack us.

60|$|Save for the {{excitement}} of the battle <b>we</b> would <b>have</b> been in most painful distress; but the mind is so much stronger than the body that even when <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> think of our condition, little heed was given to anything save the desire to do once more what <b>we</b> <b>had</b> twice done before, and make an end by the final repulse of the lobster backs.|$|R
6000|$|... "Whom <b>have</b> <b>we</b> here?" [...] {{the duke}} asked.

6000|$|... "It is a {{good idea}} if <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> carry it out, colonel.

6000|$|... "There is {{no doubt}} the beggars can fight," [...] Willcox said; [...] "and I expect we shall get some tough work {{before we get to}} Khartoum.

6000|$|... "Well enough, if she be good enough," [...] was the answer; [...] "and so is Mr. Moore too, I dare say. To speak truth, I am not {{anxious about}} him; some slight mischance {{would be only}} his just due. His conduct has been--we will say strange just now, till <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> {{characterize}} it by a more exact epithet. Meantime, may I ask what brings him here?" ...|$|E
