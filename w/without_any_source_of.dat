Instead, U.S. banks began making large loans to the nations of Europe. Thus, debts (and reparations) were being paid only by augmenting old debts and piling up new ones. In the late 1920s, and particularly after the American economy began to weaken after 1929, the European nations found {{it much more difficult}} to borrow money from the U.S. At the same time, high U.S. tariffs were making it much more difficult for them to sell their goods in U.S. markets. <b>Without</b> <b>any</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> revenue from foreign exchange to repay their loans, they began to default.|$|E

Iron ore has been mined in Herräng since the late 16th century.

The mines were situated by the coast, <b>without</b> <b>any</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> water power to pump water from the mine, which kept the mining activities at a low level.

40|$|Background: Intracranial fungal granulomas occur by {{extension}} from contiguous structures or by hematogenous dissemination from lungs. Isolated granulomas <b>without</b> <b>any</b> obvious <b>source</b> <b>of</b> infection are extremely uncommon. Objective: To describe isolated intracerebral Aspergillus spp. granuloma <b>without</b> <b>any</b> obvious <b>source</b> <b>of</b> infection. Materials and Methods: We analyzed clinical, radiological and pathological features of isolated intracerebral aspergillus granulomas diagnosed in our institution between 1986 and 2006. The chest X-ray and paranasal sinus (PNS) X-rays were reviewed. Fungal stainings were done on histological sections. Results: We identified eight patients with Aspergillus spp. intracerebral granulomas (six males, two females). There were no predisposing risk factors. The chest and PNS X-rays were normal. On computerized tomography all were heterogeneously enhancing lesions with perilesional edema. Pre or perioperative diagnosis was never made. Histological studies revealed granulomas with minimal fibrosis and giant cells and septate hyphae of Aspergillus spp. on fungal stains. Two patients died of postoperative complications and two patients relapsed. Conclusion: Isolated intracerebral aspergillus granulomas are rare and pose a diagnostic challenge. Fungal granulomas {{should be considered}} in the differential diagnosis of intracerebral inflammatory pathologies...|$|R

40|$|Much {{has been}} made of India’s {{emergence}} as a global power in recent years. In spite of the rapid growth in India’s economy, there are many serious issues affecting the majority of its people, still living at the ‘bottom of the pyramid’. Basic electricity is one such challenge. While India is currently the world’s 4 th largest consumer of electricity, it also has one of the least developed infrastructures in place to generate it. Indeed, one third of India’s 1. 2 billion people live <b>without</b> <b>any</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> electricity whatsoever. The need to address the challenges of ecological degradation and global warming has made renewable sources of energy, such as hydropower, an attractive alternative. In order to increase investment in this sector, the government of India has encouraged entrepreneurs to develop small hydropower plants, with up to 25 megawatt capacity. These small hydro power projects have started to proliferate in the mountainous regions of India, where there is an abundance of natural streams.

40|$|The GPS system {{improvement}} and the Galileo system development {{will increase the}} signal availability and therefore the GNSS system-based applications. The great evolution of GNSS based application will imply the growth of precise and fast navigation systems. The performances of GNSS systems are mostly influenced by {{the accuracy of the}} synchronization modules. In fact, loss of fine tracking means a less precise position estimation. In urban environment the receiver measurement is usually affected by errors, especially caused by multipath fading. For this cause could be useful to analyze the performances of different methodologies to solve this problem proposed in literature. In this paper, a theoretical model valid for the analysis of synchronization performances in GNSS receivers in a urban environment is proposed. The proposed model is studied under the presence of two important cause of disturbances, named gaussian noise and multipath, in the received signal. In general the S-curve is shown in the ideal case, <b>without</b> <b>any</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> noise. A model can permit to recognise the presence of different type of noise that act on the received signal. The validation of the method will be made comparing results derived from signals from a simulated environment with the theoretical model.

40|$|Phytoextraction is an innovative, modern {{technology}} in which plant species {{are used to}} extract substances from soil or water. It has potential in both mining and remediation operations in place of other more conventional methods. In this study the feasibility of phytoextractive techniques on metal containing soils, with regards to factors such as monetary and environmental costs along with temporal timescales required, was analysed. This was primarily achieved by applying results from phytoextraction field experiments in the scientific literature to data from a UK lead contaminated site. Additional analysis answered questions about the potential use of phytoextraction on a global scale, and its usage {{at the same time}} as other business enterprises. Results demonstrate that concerns about the economic and temporal feasibility of low value metal phytoextraction <b>without</b> <b>any</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> extra revenue are well founded, and that contrary to popular belief there are issues surrounding the environmental costs of phytoextraction. However, scope remains for phytoextraction to be utilised as a technique for mining precious metals. In summary, this project has weakened the case for phytoextraction of cheap metals in a various different areas. However, phytoextraction could still be a success in association with other economic operations such as biofuels.
