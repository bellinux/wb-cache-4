5|$|A major {{difference}} between And Then There Were None and Murder on the Orient Express that Sheldon pointed out <b>was</b> <b>that</b> in the former, {{the premise of the}} novel <b>was</b> <b>that</b> no one solved the murder. This forced Sheldon to desperately {{try to find a way}} to integrate clues into the story so that the player could actually discover the murderer, although the game remained quite uninteractive. In Murder on the Orient Express, the actual novel follows an investigation, so Sheldon could more easily integrate clues to lead to all three possible solutions. Sheldon also excised unnecessary puzzles from Murder on the Orient Express, as they were an unpopular feature of its predecessor.|$|E

5|$|Almost {{every aspect}} of the battle would be managed by the DCDPS at the MAR base.

Nike-X thus relied on a few very expensive sites, and many greatly simplified batteries.|$|E
