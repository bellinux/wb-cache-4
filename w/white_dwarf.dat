5|$|Compression of a <b>white</b> <b>dwarf</b> will {{increase}} the number of electrons in a given volume. Applying the Pauli exclusion principle, this {{will increase}} the kinetic energy of the electrons, thereby increasing the pressure. This electron degeneracy pressure supports a <b>white</b> <b>dwarf</b> against gravitational collapse. The pressure depends only on density and not on temperature. Degenerate matter is relatively compressible; this means that the density of a high-mass <b>white</b> <b>dwarf</b> is much greater than that of a low-mass <b>white</b> <b>dwarf</b> and that the radius of a <b>white</b> <b>dwarf</b> decreases as its mass increases.|$|E
5|$|A slow-rotating <b>white</b> <b>dwarf</b> star can {{not exceed}} the Chandrasekhar limit of 1.44 solar masses without {{collapsing}} to form a neutron star or exploding as a Type Ia supernova. Once the <b>white</b> <b>dwarf</b> reaches this mass, such as by accretion or collision, the gravitational force would exceed the pressure exerted by the electrons. If the <b>white</b> <b>dwarf</b> is rotating rapidly, however, the effective gravity is diminished in the equatorial region, thus allowing the <b>white</b> <b>dwarf</b> to exceed the Chandrasekhar limit. Such rapid rotation can occur, for example, {{as a result of}} mass accretion that results in a transfer of angular momentum.|$|E
5|$|A <b>white</b> <b>dwarf,</b> {{also called}} a {{degenerate}} dwarf, is a stellar core remnant composed mostly of electron-degenerate matter. A <b>white</b> <b>dwarf</b> is very dense: its mass {{is comparable to}} that of the Sun, while its volume is {{comparable to that of}} Earth. A white dwarf's faint luminosity comes from the emission of stored thermal energy; no fusion takes place in a <b>white</b> <b>dwarf</b> wherein mass is converted to energy. The nearest known <b>white</b> <b>dwarf</b> is Sirius B, at 8.6 light years, the smaller component of the Sirius binary star. There are currently thought to be eight white dwarfs among the hundred star systems nearest the Sun. The unusual faintness of white dwarfs was first recognized in 1910. The name <b>white</b> <b>dwarf</b> was coined by Willem Luyten in 1922.|$|E

5|$|Although thin, these {{outer layers}} {{determine}} the thermal {{evolution of the}} <b>white</b> <b>dwarf.</b> The degenerate electrons in the bulk of a <b>white</b> <b>dwarf</b> conduct heat well. Most of a white dwarf's mass is therefore at almost the same temperature (isothermal), {{and it is also}} hot: a <b>white</b> <b>dwarf</b> with surface temperature between 8,000K and 16,000K will have a core temperature between approximately 5,000,000K and 20,000,000K. The <b>white</b> <b>dwarf</b> is kept from cooling very quickly only by its outer layers' opacity to radiation.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a sensitive and comprehensive IRAC 3 − 8 µm photometric survey of <b>white</b> <b>dwarfs</b> for companions in the planetary mass regime with temperatures cooler than the known T dwarfs. The search focuses on descendents of intermediate mass stars with M � 3 M ⊙ whose inner, few hundred AU regions cannot be probed effectively for massive planets and brown dwarfs by any alternative existing method. Furthermore, examination for mid-infrared excess explores an extensive range of orbital semimajor axes, including the intermediate 5 − 50 AU range poorly covered and incompletely accessible by other techniques at main sequence or evolved stars. Three samples of <b>white</b> <b>dwarfs</b> are chosen which together represent relatively young {{as well as}} older populations of stars: 9 open cluster <b>white</b> <b>dwarfs,</b> 22 high mass field <b>white</b> <b>dwarfs,</b> and 17 metal-rich field <b>white</b> <b>dwarfs.</b> In particular, these targets include: 7 Hyads and 4 field <b>white</b> <b>dwarfs</b> of similar age; 1 Pleiad and 19 field <b>white</b> <b>dwarfs</b> of similar age; van Maanen 2 and 16 similarly metal-rich <b>white</b> <b>dwarfs</b> with ages between 1 and 7 Gyr. No substellar companion candidates were identified at any star. By demanding a 15 % minimum photometric excess at 4. 5 µm to indicate a companion detection, upper limits in the planetary mass regime are established at 34 of the sample <b>white</b> <b>dwarfs,</b> 20 of which have limits below 10 MJ according to substellar cooling models.

5|$|These {{computations}} all {{assume that}} the <b>white</b> <b>dwarf</b> is non-rotating.

For a uniformly rotating <b>white</b> <b>dwarf,</b> the limiting mass increases only slightly. If the star is allowed to rotate nonuniformly, and viscosity is neglected, then, as was pointed out by Fred Hoyle in 1947, there is no limit to the mass for which it is possible for a model <b>white</b> <b>dwarf</b> to be in static equilibrium.

5|$|For a more {{accurate}} computation of the mass-radius relationship and limiting mass of a <b>white</b> <b>dwarf,</b> one must compute the equation of state which describes the relationship between density and pressure in the <b>white</b> <b>dwarf</b> material. If the density and pressure are both set equal to functions of the radius {{from the center of}} the star, the system of equations consisting of the hydrostatic equation together with the equation of state can then be solved to find the structure of the <b>white</b> <b>dwarf</b> at equilibrium. In the non-relativistic case, we will still find that the radius is inversely proportional to the cube root of the mass., eq. (80) Relativistic corrections will alter the result so that the radius becomes zero at a finite value of the mass. This is the limiting value of the mass—called the Chandrasekhar limit—at which the <b>white</b> <b>dwarf</b> can no longer be supported by electron degeneracy pressure. The graph on the right shows the result of such a computation. It shows how radius varies with mass for non-relativistic (blue curve) and relativistic (green curve) models of a <b>white</b> <b>dwarf.</b> Both models treat the <b>white</b> <b>dwarf</b> as a cold Fermi gas in hydrostatic equilibrium. The average molecular weight per electron, , has been set equal to 2. Radius is measured in standard solar radii and mass in standard solar masses.|$|E
5|$|The {{companion}} star is a dense <b>white</b> <b>dwarf</b> star. This {{category of}} stellar object {{has reached the}} end of its evolutionary life span and is no longer generating energy through nuclear fusion. Instead, under normal circumstances, a <b>white</b> <b>dwarf</b> will steadily radiate away its excess energy, mainly stored heat, growing cooler and dimmer over the course of many billions of years.|$|E
5|$|The {{degenerate}} matter {{that makes up}} the bulk of a <b>white</b> <b>dwarf</b> has a very low opacity, because any absorption of a photon requires that an electron must transition to a higher empty state, which may not be possible as the energy of the photon may not be a match for the possible quantum states available to that electron, hence radiative heat transfer within a <b>white</b> <b>dwarf</b> is low; it does, however, have a high thermal conductivity. As a result, the interior of the <b>white</b> <b>dwarf</b> maintains a uniform temperature, approximately 107K. An outer shell of non-{{degenerate matter}} cools from approximately 107K to 104K. This matter radiates roughly as a black body. A <b>white</b> <b>dwarf</b> remains visible for a long time, as its tenuous outer atmosphere of normal matter begins to radiate at about 107K, upon formation, while its greater interior mass is at 107 K but cannot radiate through its normal matter shell.|$|E

40|$|We have {{examined}} the radial distribution of <b>white</b> <b>dwarfs</b> over a single HST/ACS field in the nearby globular cluster NGC 6397.

5|$|A <b>white</b> <b>dwarf</b> is {{very hot}} when it forms, {{but because it}} has no source of energy, it will {{gradually}} radiate its energy and cool.

Over a very long time, a <b>white</b> <b>dwarf</b> will cool and its material will begin to crystallize (starting with the core). The star's low temperature means it will no longer emit significant heat or light, and {{it will become a}} cold black dwarf. Because the length of time it takes for a <b>white</b> <b>dwarf</b> to reach this state is calculated to be longer than the current age of the universe (approximately 13.8 billion years), it is thought that no black dwarfs yet exist.
