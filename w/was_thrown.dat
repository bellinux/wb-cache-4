5|$|At 5:30 am on April 19, {{dynamite}} <b>was</b> <b>thrown</b> {{through a}} front window of Z. Alexander Looby's home in north Nashville, apparently {{in retaliation for}} his support of the demonstrators. Although the explosion almost destroyed the house, Looby and his wife, who were asleep in a back bedroom, were not injured. More than 140 windows in a nearby dormitory were broken by the blast.|$|E

5|$|At around 2:00am on July 17, {{the first}} act of {{violence}} in Baltimore emerged. According to the newspaper reports the following day, a westbound train <b>was</b> <b>thrown</b> from the tracks at a switch in a suburb south of the city. The switch had been opened and locked by an unknown person. The engine caught fire, and the engineer and the fireman aboard were severely injured.|$|E
5|$|In its {{formative}} stages, Linfa brought light rainfall to Palau and Yap, causing minimal effects. The {{outskirts of}} the storm increased winds across eastern Malaysia, which knocked down trees and destroyed the roofs of eight school and several houses. In one of the damaged homes, an 18-month-old baby inside <b>was</b> <b>thrown</b> into a nearby field and suffered injuries.|$|E
5|$|Near {{the end of}} {{his term}} in Congress, Wickliffe <b>was</b> <b>thrown</b> from a {{carriage}} and permanently crippled. Despite his injury, he remained politically active. In 1863, he ran for governor as a Peace Democrat on an anti-Lincoln platform. Military authorities considered him subversive, however, and interfered with the election; Wickliffe lost to Thomas E. Bramlette in a landslide.|$|E
5000|$|Many tricks or {{patterns}} are generated from mixing cascade and reverse cascade throws. For example, tennis (siteswap: 3) one ball <b>is</b> <b>thrown</b> over (reverse) {{while the other}} two <b>are</b> <b>thrown</b> under (inside). One juggles, [...] "a cascade with two balls while the 'tennis' ball <b>is</b> <b>thrown</b> {{and forth over the}} top." ...|$|R

5|$|On June 4, {{playing at}} Connie Mack Stadium against the Phillies, Koufax walked Richie Allen {{on a very}} close full-count pitch in the fourth inning.

With his third no-hitter in three years, Koufax became only the second pitcher of the modern era (after Bob Feller) to pitch three no-hitters.|$|E

50|$|A simple {{example of}} the {{discrete}} uniform distribution <b>is</b> <b>throwing</b> a fair die. The possible values are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and each time the die <b>is</b> <b>thrown</b> {{the probability of a}} given score is 1/6. If two dice <b>are</b> <b>thrown</b> and their values added, the resulting distribution is no longer uniform since not all sums have equal probability.|$|R

5|$|Shepton {{benefits}} from a sizeable park, {{a gift of}} land from a local man, John Kyte Collett.

50|$|Not to be {{confused}} with the 540 crescent, a crescent 540 is where a crescent kick <b>is</b> <b>thrown</b> out with one leg before the 540 kick <b>is</b> <b>thrown</b> with the other, essentially executing two separate kicks during the same motion. A slight variation of this is where the crescent kick <b>is</b> <b>thrown</b> as a sideways snap kick, followed by a round house kick. The hips must be rotated more before the kicks <b>are</b> <b>thrown</b> and the body tilts in the direction of the kicks, which can cause a person to lose their balance on the landing.|$|R
50|$|In , {{the balls}} <b>are</b> <b>thrown</b> underhand (palm up) and rarely they <b>are</b> <b>thrown</b> {{overhand}} (palm under), and are metal. In standard , the wooden or plastic balls are tossed underhand (palm up) and rolled.|$|R
5000|$|A given juggling {{pattern is}} {{represented}} by a sequence of digits, like [...] "333", [...] "97531", or [...] "744". Each digit represents the number of throws that occur {{by the time that}} same prop will be caught. For example, [...] "333" [...] represents a common three-ball cascade, where three props <b>are</b> <b>thrown</b> before the same prop will <b>be</b> caught and <b>thrown</b> again. Within the [...] "531531" [...] pattern, the prop thrown first, the '5' <b>throw,</b> will not <b>be</b> caught until five <b>throws</b> have <b>been</b> made, including itself, where it will <b>be</b> <b>thrown</b> again as a '1'. The prop thrown next, the '3', will <b>be</b> <b>thrown</b> again on the third throw afterwards, the next '3'. And the next prop <b>is</b> <b>thrown</b> with a '1' <b>throw,</b> which <b>is</b> a direct pass to the other hand and will <b>be</b> <b>thrown</b> on the very next throw as a '5'.|$|R
5|$|When the {{military}} junta came to power, the IAe 33 project <b>was</b> <b>thrown</b> into disarray.

5|$|A {{fathometer}} was {{not required}} under USCG regulations, and Fitzgerald lacked one, even though fathometers were {{available at the time}} of her sinking. Instead, a hand line was the only method Fitzgerald had to take depth soundings. The hand line consisted of a piece of line knotted at measured intervals with a lead weight on the end. The line <b>was</b> <b>thrown</b> over the bow of the ship and the count of the knots measured the water depth. The NTSB investigation concluded that a fathometer would have provided Fitzgerald additional navigational data and made her less dependent on Anderson for navigational assistance.|$|E
5|$|A small {{fraction}} of the contaminated spray <b>was</b> <b>thrown</b> back into the air as the base surge. Unlike the Wilson cloud, a meteorological phenomenon in clean air, the base surge was a heavy fog bank of radioactive mist that rolled across all the target ships, coating their surfaces with fission products. When the mist in the base surge evaporated, the base surge became invisible but continued to move away, contaminating ships several miles from the detonation point.|$|E
5000|$|Six no-hitters <b>were</b> <b>thrown.</b> They <b>were</b> <b>thrown</b> by Ubaldo Jiménez (April 17), Dallas Braden (May 9), Roy Halladay (May 29), Edwin Jackson (June 25), Matt Garza (July 26), and Halladay again, {{this time}} in Game 1 of the NLDS. It was only {{the third time in}} major league history that at least six no-hitters <b>were</b> <b>thrown</b> in a single season. Braden's no-hitter and Halladay's first were both perfect games.|$|R

5|$|An English folk tale {{tells how}} an old woman, a {{supposed}} witch, cursed her landlord {{and all his}} possessions when he demanded the unpaid rent for her cottage. Soon afterwards, a large toad fell on his wife and caused her to collapse. The toad <b>was</b> <b>thrown</b> into the fire but escaped with severe burns. Meanwhile, the old witch's cottage had caught fire and she was badly burnt. By next day, both toad and witch had died, and {{it was found that}} the woman's burns exactly mirrored those of the toad.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 2010, Juventus {{considered}} challenging the stripping of their scudetti from 2005 and 2006, {{dependent on the}} results of trials connected to the 2006 scandal. Subsequent investigations found in 2011 that Juventus' relegation in 2006 was without merit. When former general manager Luciano Moggi's conviction in criminal court in connection with the scandal <b>was</b> <b>thrown</b> out by an appeals court in 2015, the club sued the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) for €443million for damages caused by their 2006 relegation. FIGC president Carlo Tavecchio offered to discuss reinstatement of the lost scudetti in exchange for Juventus dropping the lawsuit.|$|E

50|$|The name of {{the game}} is derived from the Hindi word pachis, meaning twenty-five, the largest score that can <b>be</b> <b>thrown</b> with the cowrie shells.

50|$|Ted Healy and his Stooges are entertainers. But because Healy is {{much more}} {{interested}} in women than he is in performing, they <b>are</b> <b>thrown</b> out of the Happy Hour Theatre.
