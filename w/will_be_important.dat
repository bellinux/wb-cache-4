5|$|The song's {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Francis Lawrence and produced by Caleb Dewart of DNA Inc. The video deals directly with the lyrics' theme of Stefani's search for inspiration in songwriting. It opens with a lengthy non-musical section in which Stefani arrives in Los Angeles off of No Doubt's Rock Steady Tour. She receives several calls from Interscope label head Jimmy Iovine, who attempts to push her forward with her solo debut project, but she replies that she is tired and uninspired. After a failed studio attempt, Stefani sees a flyer advertising help for writer's block. Upon arrival she is asked {{to fill out a}} suspicious questionnaire, where the camera pans to the questions which <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>important.</b> She is then told that she will be billed when she is finished. She asks for clarification only to discover that she is already back in the studio by herself. When Stefani picks up an oversized pocket watch from the piano, a rabbit knick-knack that she had previously seen jumps across the room. She throws the watch at the knick-knack, causing her to fall back on her chair and find herself transported to a fantasy world based on Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass.|$|E

25|$|The {{advances}} in bisulfite sequencing {{have led to}} the possibility of applying them at a genome-wide scale, where, previously, global measure of DNA methylation was feasible only using other techniques, such as Restriction landmark genomic scanning. The mapping of the human epigenome is seen by many scientists as the logical follow-up to the completion of the Human Genome Project. This epigenomic information <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>important</b> in understanding how the function of the genetic sequence is implemented and regulated. Since the epigenome is less stable than the genome, it is thought to be important in gene-environment interactions.|$|E
25|$|Methods {{to prevent}} sleep loss, reduce human error, and {{optimize}} {{mental and physical}} performance during long-duration spaceflight are being investigated. Particular concerns include {{the effect of the}} space environment on higher-order cognitive processes like decision-making and the impact of changing gravity on mental functions, which <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>important</b> if artificial gravity is considered as a countermeasure for future interplanetary space missions. It is also necessary to develop human-response measurement technologies to assess the crew's ability to perform flight-management tasks effectively. Simple and reliable behavioral and psycho-physiological response measurement systems are needed to assess mental loading, stress, task engagement, and situation awareness during spaceflight.|$|E
25|$|Biodiversity {{inventory}} – An interspecific O–A relationship {{implies that}} those species {{that have a}} restricted distribution (and hence <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>important</b> for conservation reasons) will also have low abundance within their range. Thus, when {{it is especially important}} that a species be detected, that species may be difficult to detect. Gaston et al. note that because of this relationship, the intensiveness of a sampling scheme cannot be traded off for extensiveness. In effect, an intensive survey of a few sites will miss species with restricted distribution occurring at other sites, while an low-intensity extensive survey will miss species with low densities across most sites.|$|E

25|$|The {{effects of}} {{exposure}} to HZE nuclei on spatial learning, memory behavior, and neuronal signaling have been tested, and threshold doses have also been considered for such effects. It <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>important</b> to understand the mechanisms {{that are involved in}} these deficits to extrapolate the results to other dose regimes, particle types, and, eventually, astronauts. Studies on rats were performed using the Morris water maze test 1 month after whole-body irradiation with 1.5 Gy of 1 GeV/u 56Fe-ions. Irradiated rats demonstrated cognitive impairment that was similar to that seen in aged rats. This leads to the possibility that an increase in the amount of ROS may be responsible for the induction of both radiation- and age-related cognitive deficits.|$|E
25|$|Climate {{change has}} the {{potential}} to affect agriculture through changes in temperature, rainfall (timing and quantity), CO2, solar radiation and the interaction of these elements. Extreme events, such as droughts and floods, are forecast to increase as climate change takes hold. Agriculture is among sectors most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change; water supply for example, will be critical to sustain agricultural production and provide the increase in food output required to sustain the world's growing population. Fluctuations in the flow of rivers are likely to increase in the twenty-first century. Based on the experience of countries in the Nile river basin (Ethiopia, Kenya and Sudan) and other developing countries, depletion of water resources during seasons crucial for agriculture can lead to a decline in yield by up to 50%. Transformational approaches will be needed to manage natural resources in the future. For example, policies, practices and tools promoting climate-smart agriculture <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>important,</b> as will better use of scientific information on climate for assessing risks and vulnerability. Planners and policy-makers will need to help create suitable policies that encourage funding for such agricultural transformation.|$|E
25|$|Prime-boost {{strategies}} {{have been successful}} in inducing protection against malarial challenge in a number of studies. Primed mice with plasmid DNA encoding Plasmodium yoelii circumsporozoite surface protein (PyCSP), then boosted with a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the same protein had significantly higher levels of antibody, CTL activity and IFN-γ, and hence higher levels of protection, than mice immunized and boosted with plasmid DNA alone. This can be further enhanced by priming with a mixture of plasmids encoding PyCSP and murine GM-CSF, before boosting with recombinant vaccinia virus. An effective prime-boost strategy for the simian malarial model P. knowlesi has also been demonstrated. Rhesus monkeys were primed with a multicomponent, multistage DNA vaccine encoding two liver-stage antigens – the circumsporozoite surface protein (PkCSP) and sporozoite surface protein 2 (PkSSP2) – and two blood stage antigens – the apical merozoite surface protein 1 (PkAMA1) and merozoite surface protein 1 (PkMSP1p42). They were then boosted with a recombinant canarypox virus encoding all four antigens (ALVAC-4). Immunized monkeys developed antibodies against sporozoites and infected erythrocytes, and IFN-γ-secreting T-cell responses against peptides from PkCSP. Partial protection against sporozoite challenge was achieved, and mean parasitemia was significantly reduced, compared to control monkeys. These models, while not ideal for extrapolation to P. falciparum in humans, <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>important</b> in pre-clinical trials.|$|E

500|$|Soon {{after his}} death, the Viscount of Inhaúma {{was hailed as}} [...] "one of the {{greatest}} figures of the Brazilian armada" [...] in the Brazilian Senate. He was extremely popular in the armada and was fondly called [...] "Uncle Joaquim" [...] by his subordinates. The Brazilian navy's slang phrase, [...] "andar na Inácia", which meant to behave correctly, was derived from his name. Since 1870, no comprehensive biography of Inhaúma has been published, even though he, according to Francisco Eduardo Alves de Almeira, [...] "is, and always <b>will</b> <b>be,</b> <b>important</b> to the navy of Brazil for his example as a modest and dedicated chief". The Inhaúma-class corvette, built in the 1980s and 1990s, was named after him. Despite the scant attention paid him in historical literature, there are some historians who share a highly positive view of Inhaúma. Américo Jacobina Lacombe {{said that he was}} [...] "one of the greatest names in our [...] military history". Max Justo Guedes regarded him among the greatest imperial navy officers, and Adolfo Lumans considered him one of the greatest navy officers in Brazilian history.|$|E
500|$|Season 4 {{begins in}} an {{alternate}} timeline, {{one in which}} September had failed to save the alternate version of Peter in 1985, according to the Observers. This creates a butterfly effect influencing the main characters' pasts but otherwise stabilizing both universes due {{to the creation of}} the bridge. Peter is pulled into this new timeline due to the actions of the alternate timeline's Fringe team, which includes Lincoln Lee (Seth Gabel). Peter initially works to return to his own timeline, fueled by fears that his memories are altering Cortexiphan-dosed Olivia's of this timeline, but after encountering a wounded September, Peter comes to learn that this timeline is truly his home, and both he and Olivia come to accept the change, rekindling their affair. September also reveals to Peter that the Observers needed to erase Peter's son, Henry, to assure their future will be created, though noting that Peter's future child with Olivia <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>important.</b> Meanwhile, in the present, William Bell has instructed David Robert Jones, alive in this timeline, to work with the parallel universe's version of Nina Sharp to synchronize the two universes, aiming to collapse them both and pave the way for a third universe under Bell's control, using Olivia's Cortexiphan powers to enable the collapse. The Fringe division is forced to close the dimensional bridge, but this fails to stop Bell's plan. Walter is left with one choice, to shoot and kill Olivia, her death disrupting the process and saving the world. Olivia's [...] "death" [...] is only temporary, as the Cortexiphan in her body is consumed to repair the bullet wound, leaving her alive and healthy but lacking her psionic abilities. As Olivia and Peter begin their lives together, September appears to Walter and warns that the Observers [...] "are coming".|$|E

2500|$|During his 2002 campaign, Romney had {{expressed}} broad support for {{embryonic stem cell}} research, {{and said he would}} lobby President Bush (who the year before had banned most federal funding for such research) to support it. [...] In particular, Romney stated that he supported the use of surplus embryos from fertility clinics for stem-cell research. [...] In early 2005, Romney announced his position on therapeutic cloning for the first time, saying he was against it, but was still in favor of research on unused embryos from fertility treatments. [...] Per this stance, he vetoed a Massachusetts bill to fund stem-cell research because the legislation allowed such cloning of human embryos. [...] "I am not in favor of creating new human embryos through cloning," [...] said Romney, calling the practice [...] "a matter of profound moral and ethical consequence". Romney also opposed the legislation because of its assertion that life does not begin until an embryo is implanted in a uterus. [...] "It is very conceivable that scientific advances will allow an embryo to be grown for a substantial period of time outside the uterus," [...] Romney {{said in an interview with}} the Boston Globe. [...] "To say that it is not life at one month or two months or four months or full term, just because it had never been in a uterus, would be absurd."
