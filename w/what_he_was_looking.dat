In addition to furs and the company of free-spirited, rugged mountain men, Carson sought action and adventure. He found <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> for in killing and scalping Indians. Carson probably killed and took the scalp of his first Indian when he {{was nineteen}} years old, during Ewing Young's expedition.|$|E
25|$|Galileo was {{considered}} the father of observational astronomy. He {{was among the first}} to use a telescope to observe the sky and after constructing a 20x refractor telescope he discovered the four largest moons of Jupiter in 1610. This was the first observation of satellites orbiting another planet. He also found that our Moon had craters and observed (and correctly explained) sunspots. Galileo noted that Venus exhibited a full set of phases resembling lunar phases. Galileo argued that these observations supported the Copernican system and were, to some extent, incompatible with the favored model of the Earth at the center of the universe. He may have even observed the planet Neptune in 1612 and 1613, over 200 years before it was discovered, but it is unclear if he was aware of <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> at.|$|E

The song begins with seven distinct synthesizer notes played on the Synclavier digital synthesizer, with Tom Bahler credited for the Synclavier performance on the song. The intro is taken note for note from a demo LP released the year before, called [...] "The Incredible Sounds of Synclavier II" [...] first published in 1981 by Denny Jaeger Creative Services, Inc and sold by New England Digital, makers of the Synclavier.|$|E

500|$|The [...] "Something" [...] promo film is {{included}} in the Beatles' 2015 video compilation 1. Rolling Stone journalist Rob Sheffield comments on the significance of the clip, with regard to the band's history: [...] "each couple projects a totally different vibe – George and Patti peacocking in their hippie-royalty finery, Paul and Linda on the farm in Scotland with Martha the sheepdog, Ringo and Maureen goofing around on motorbikes, John and Yoko serene in their matching black robes. Each Beatle looks like he's found <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> for – but they're heading for four separate futures." ...|$|E
500|$|Critical opinion {{has also}} noted that both parts of the story arc offer an {{alternative}} explanation for {{the events of the}} series so far, a [...] "less romantic" [...] outcome that paints the ongoing plot as an elaborate hoax to defer attention from the government's experiments, both military and medical. Reviewer Todd VanDerWerff feels that such an explanation would [...] "speak more to the sadness {{at the core of the}} X-Files to have Mulder find his answers and be forced to accept they weren't <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> for", comparing such a realization to the hero of Don Quixote. This [...] "hoax" [...] plot device would later be revisited in both the fourth season finale [...] "Gethsemane" [...] and the fifth season's opening two-part episodes [...] "Redux and Redux II", although to a much lesser degree of effectiveness.|$|E

Milo and the others successfully fly the crystal back to the city, as the volcano erupts. With lava flowing towards the city, Kida (in her crystal form) rises {{into the air and}} creates a protective shield. The lava breaks away harmlessly, showing a restored Atlantis, and the crystal returns Kida to Milo. The surviving crew members return to the surface and promise to keep the discovery of Atlantis a secret. Having fallen in love with Kida, Milo stays behind to help her rebuild the lost empire. In the final scene, the crew members, having made their fortunes from the rewards given to them by the Atlanteans, speak with Mr. Whitmore and insist that the expedition was unsuccessful. [...] However, they do give him a small package from Milo, containing an Atlantean crystal and a note saying he found <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> for.|$|E

500|$|In , Jason Thompson {{referred}} to Monkey Punch's original manga as [...] "a crazy, groovy 1960s world of dynamite and backstabbing, hippies and gangsters", and considered it [...] "a fascinating homage to Mad magazine and a four star example of comics as pure comedy." [...] He rated the series {{four out of}} four stars. Allen Divers of Anime News Network (ANN) praised the strong writing and action; however, {{he felt that the}} art was too primitive. Otaku USAs Daryl Surat was also put off by the art, saying he couldn't tell most character apart and had a hard time figuring out <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> at. In The Rough Guide to Manga, Jason S. Yadao highlighted the example of how Lupin wearing a hat looks exactly like Zenigata. However, he considered it a successful plot device in once chapter that while it may take several attempts to understand, eventually pays off. He included the series in his list of 50 essential manga. Many of the first volumes of the English edition of the Lupin III manga released by Tokyopop made it onto ICv2's list of top 50 graphic novels, as well as later volumes from the series.|$|E
500|$|Hersey {{began by}} making himself {{familiar}} {{with the work of}} writers already in the market who were capable of producing the kind of material Ralston wanted. [...] He soon concluded that the new magazine would have to include some reprinted stories alongside the original material. [...] The budget did not permit Hersey to pay rates that would attract top-quality writers, nor even to reprint the best-known stories of the kind he was looking for, and he was forced to use relatively unknown authors such as Perley Poore Sheehan and Robert W. Sneddon. [...] Hersey distributed a [...] "Notice to Writers" [...] that described <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> for: [...] "strange, bizarre, occult, mysterious tales... mystic happenings, weird adventures, feats of leger-de-main, spiritualism, et cetera... If you have an idea which you have considered too bizarre to write, too weird or strange, let us see it." [...] This did not restrict the submissions to fantasy or science fiction, and as a result Hersey received (and printed) all kinds of fiction, including mysteries, adventures, and love stories, though it may be that he simply did not receive enough good quality science fiction and fantasy to fill the magazine. [...] Hersey later recalled that the notice did not bring in many usable manuscripts: [...] "As a result of the notices in the writers' magazines, I received a thousand manuscripts but was able to buy only ten!" ...|$|E

According to one account: [...] "Joseph would, at intervals, say: 'What do I see?' {{as one might}} say while {{looking out the window}} and beholding what all in the room could not see. Then he would relate what he had seen or <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> at. Then Sidney replied, 'I see the same.' Presently Sidney would say 'what do I see?' and would repeat what he had seen or was seeing, and Joseph would reply, 'I see the same.' This manner of conversation was repeated at short intervals {{to the end of the}} vision".|$|E
2500|$|Jeckeln and his aide Paul Degenhart {{searched the}} Riga {{vicinity}} {{to find a}} site. [...] Riga was located in a swampy area where the water table was close to ground level. [...] This would interfere with the proper disposal of thousands of corpses. [...] Jeckeln needed elevated ground. [...] The site also {{had to be on}} the north side of the Daugava River within walking distance of the ghetto, also on the north side. On or about November 18 or 19 Jeckeln came upon Rumbula as he was driving south to the Salaspils concentration camp (then under construction), and it fit <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> for. [...] The site was close to Riga, it was on elevated ground, and it had sandy soil, with the only drawback being the proximity to the highway (about 100 meters).|$|E
2500|$|In 1938 Stewart had a brief, tumultuous {{romance with}} Hollywood queen Norma Shearer, whose husband, Irving Thalberg, head of {{production}} at MGM, had {{died two years}} earlier. Stewart began a successful partnership with director Frank Capra in 1938, when he was loaned out to Columbia Pictures to star in You Can't Take It With You. Capra had been impressed by Stewart's minor role in Navy Blue and Gold (1937). The director had recently completed several well received films, including It Happened One Night (1934), and {{was looking for the}} right actor to suit his needs—other recent actors in Capra's films such as Clark Gable, Ronald Colman, and Gary Cooper did not quite fit. Not only was Stewart just <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> for, but Capra also found Stewart understood that prototype intuitively and required very little directing. Later Capra commented, [...] "I think he's probably the best actor who's ever hit the screen." ...|$|E

2500|$|Rolling Stones {{lead singer}} Mick Jagger, {{who had already}} been punched {{in the head by}} a concertgoer within seconds of {{emerging}} from his helicopter, was visibly intimidated by the unruly situation and urged everyone to, [...] "Just be cool down in the front there, don't push around." [...] During the third song, [...] "Sympathy for the Devil", a fight erupted {{in the front of the}} crowd at the foot of the stage, prompting the Stones to pause their set while the Angels restored order. After a lengthy pause and another appeal for calm, the band restarted the song and continued their set with less incident until the start of [...] "Under My Thumb". Some of the Hells Angels got into a scuffle with Meredith Hunter, age 18, when he attempted to get onstage with other fans. One of the Hells Angels grabbed Hunter's head, punched him, and chased him back into the crowd. [...] After a minute's pause, Hunter returned to the stage [...] where, according to Gimme Shelter producer Porter Bibb, Hunter's girlfriend Patty Bredehoft found him and tearfully begged him to calm down and move further back in the crowd with her; but he was reportedly enraged, irrational and so high he could barely walk. Rock Scully, who could see the audience clearly from the top of a truck by the stage, said of Hunter, [...] "I saw <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> at, that he was crazy, he was on drugs, and that he had murderous intent.

2500|$|The {{release of}} a new {{television}} series, , prompted a further revision in the depiction of Klingon culture, though Gene Roddenberry had wanted to avoid re-appearances of races from the old series. Set a century later than the original series, the USS Enterprise-D featured a Klingon crewmember, Worf. Makeup artist Michael Westmore needed a consistent reference to base the Klingon look on, as each individual Klingon had distinct head ridges. He found <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> for in a book of dinosaurs: observing dinosaur vertebrae laid out flat, Westmore cut the designs in half and modified them to suit each Klingon. Westmore designed his Klingons' beards to be Elizabethan, combining prehistoric and aristocratic elements to give audiences a feeling of depth from the appearance. Over time, Westmore and the other makeup artists designed different sizes of prosthetic headpieces which could be quickly applied and modified to save time; the amount of preparation to turn an actor into a Klingon decreased from around three hours to one. While important characters had custom headpieces, background actors used pre-made masks with minor touchup around the eyes and mouth. The Next Generation effects artist Dan Curry used his martial arts experience to create a flowing fighting style for the race. When the episode [...] "" [...] called for a special Klingon blade, Curry drew on Far East influences to develop a weapon known as the batleth. Curry, a collector of weapons, was annoyed by fictional weaponry {{that was designed to}} [...] "look cool" [...] but could not be handled practically. Curry combined elements of the Himalayan kukri, Chinese axes and fighting crescents to create a two-handed, curved weapon that has since been widely used in the franchise.|$|E
