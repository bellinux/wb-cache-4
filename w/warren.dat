50|$|B. lesueur is very vocal, {{communicating}} through grunts, hisses, and squeals. It shelters in underground burrows, {{the only}} macropodiform to do so. Burrows vary from simple tunnels to complex networks with multiple entrances and deep, interconnecting tunnels. These elaborate burrows, or <b>warrens,</b> {{have been seen}} having from four to 94 entrances. <b>Warrens</b> are communal, housing an average of 20-40 bettongs. Bettongs appear to switch <b>warrens</b> from time to time, though each has one or two preferred <b>warrens.</b> During {{the day in the}} <b>warrens,</b> they form groups of one male and one or many females; males never share <b>warrens</b> with other males. Some of the female-female groups seem to be mother-daughter associations. However, individuals seem to forage alone, showing none of the day-range group associations.|$|R

Clarke dismisses them. He removes the hood from the figure to reveal that he has bound <b>Warren</b> in Elizabeth's place; Clarke believes <b>Warren</b> has been tainted with evil, and that the latter is no longer doing God's work.

40|$|Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) {{was used}} to map the <b>warrens</b> of {{southern}} hairy-nosed wombats (Lasiorhinus latifrons) in South Australia {{in a variety of}} soil types.

The use of GPR has provided the first noninvasive means of mapping wombat <b>warrens</b> and the first opportunity to conduct follow-up research to determine how <b>warrens</b> might change over time in response to changes in population.
