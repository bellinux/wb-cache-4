40|$|The <b>plaster</b> <b>moulding</b> {{process is}} {{commonly}} used for casting prototypes of aluminium components designed for subsequent production by die casting. <b>Plaster</b> <b>moulded</b> prototype castings possess dimensional tolerances and surface quality comparable to die castings, but vithout the high tooling costs and lead times. &fortunately, the mechanical properties of plaster castings are significantly inferior to their die cast counterparts. This is due pri-marily to the low thermal conductivity of plaster which extends casting solidijication time signijicantly compared to die or even sand casting processes. Long solidification times result in large grained castings demonstrating low strength and hardness. This work is an experimental investigation into the effects of various levels of silica sand and carbonfibre additions on the properties of foaming <b>plaster</b> <b>moulds</b> and associated aluminium castings. Data and statistical analyses are presented and conclusions drawn regarding the wet and dry strength of <b>plaster</b> <b>moulds</b> {{as a function of}} sand and carbon fibre content. Likewise, conclusions regarding the associated casting characteristics such as surface jinish, solid$cation time, hardness and tensile strength are presented.

In this study, {{the effect}} of {{alternative}} additives on the properties spred diameter, setting time, bending strength and water absorption of sanitaryware <b>plaster</b> <b>moulds</b> was investigated. The plaster was partially replaced by the alternative additives such as perlite, diatomite and glass beads. Microstructural features of the resultant compositions were determined by scanning electron microscope (SEM). Finally, represantative moulds were produced and their performance was investigated under industrial conditions. It was observed that perlite and diatomite addition deteriorated the strength of <b>plaster</b> <b>moulds</b> {{and there was no}} noticeable effect of these additives on casting performance of the <b>plaster</b> <b>moulds.</b> Morever, the presence of glass beads in plaster decreased weight of the moulds without deterioration of moulds service life. Slip casting is a common method for producing sanitaryware, and <b>plaster</b> <b>moulds</b> have been used for shaping sanitaryware products [1, 2]. The most suitable material is to be gypsum, that is used extensively in the ceramic industry in moulding preforms from aqueous slips.

40|$|<b>Plaster</b> <b>moulds</b> used in {{precision}} foundry {{are characterized}} by a very low permeability which, {{in the case of}} classic <b>plaster</b> <b>moulds,</b> equals to about 0, 01 ÷ 0, 02 m 2 /(MPa·s). One of the most effective methods for increasing the permeability is a foaming treatment. Another characteristic feature of plaster is its very good insulating power which has influence on the process of solidification and cooling of a cast and also on a knock-out property. This insulating power is a function of thermophysical properties of plaster which, in turn, depend mainly on the mineralogical composition of the mould material, its bulk density {{as well as on the}} temperature of the pouring alloy. In the case of a foamed <b>plaster</b> <b>mould</b> an increase of the degree of foaming increases its porosity which causes a change in its thermophysical properties, thereby increasing susceptibility of the mass to overheating. The susceptibility of the plaster layer surrounding the cast to overheating is favorable because it makes it easier to knock-out of the cast by immersing the hot mould in cold water. Thermal and phase tensions that are created during this process cause fast destruction of plaster. This paper describes our investigations aimed at the determination of the dependence of the mould temperature field on the time of the cast stay in the mould, as recorded in a process of an unsteady heat flow. The determined data were planned to be used for estimation of the technological properties of the <b>plaster</b> <b>mould.</b> The tests were carried out using the plaster α-Supraduro and Alkanol XC (foaming agent). The test mould had a diameter of Ø 120 mm with centrally situated mould cavity of Ø 30 mm. <b>Plaster</b> <b>moulds</b> with a degree of foaming 20; 32, 5 and 45 % and comparatively from non-foaming plaster were tested and their temperatures were measured at the distance x= 2; 9; 21; 25; 27; 30 mm from the mould cavity within 25 min. Analysis of the results leads to the conclusion, that the highest effectiveness of heating and overheating of a mould made of a foamed plaster occurs at the degree of the plaster foaming equal to SS= 45 %. The results obtained can provide the basis for the elaboration of the best <b>plaster</b> <b>mould</b> properties, and thus to increase the technology effectiveness...|$|R

5000|$|Pressure casting: Specially {{developed}} {{polymeric materials}} allow a mould {{to be subject}} to application external pressures of up to 4.0 MPa-so much higher than slip casting in <b>plaster</b> <b>moulds</b> where the capillary forces correspond to a pressure of around 0.1 - 0.2 MPa. The high pressure leads to much faster casting rates and, hence, faster production cycles. Furthermore, the application of high pressure air through the polymeric moulds upon demoulding the cast means a new casting cycle can be started immediately in the same <b>mould,</b> unlike <b>plaster</b> <b>moulds</b> which require lengthy drying times. The polymeric materials have much greater durability than plaster and, therefore, it is possible to achieve shaped products with better dimensional tolerances and much longer mould life.

40|$|Foamed <b>plaster</b> <b>moulds</b> {{are used}} in {{precision}} casting process of non-ferrous alloys. Casting from those moulds are characterizedby high dimensional accuracy, very good shape pattering and small surface roughness. However, a drawback of the <b>plaster</b> <b>mould</b> is very low permeability. A substational improvement of this parametr may be achived through physical or phisico-chemical treatment of the plaster slurry or prepared mould. The most advantageous results {{can be obtained by}} foaming the slurry. The investigatious comprised evaluation of the influence of mixing parametrs (mixer type, rotation and mixing time, settings the mixer in mixing device) and the content of a foaming agent on the degree of foaming of the plaster. The tests were carried out using the α-plaster Hartform-H 1 and Alkanol XC as a foaming agent. The structure of a slurry produced after foaming is non-homogeous. Therefore, the investigations were completed by making appropriate of this process. Analysis of the results leads to the conclusion, that the foamed plaster Hartform_H 1 reaches the top degree of foaming at the following parameters: the water/plaster ratio W/G= 0. 55, the content of Alkanol XC a= 0. 07 %, stirring with a perforate disc mixer at the rotation speed nm= 4000 rpm during τm= 30 s. In turn the top homogeneity of the foamed plaster slurry can be achieved at the rotation speed nu= 1400 rpm during τu= 30 s., while other parameters are the same as in the foaming process.

50|$|The {{production}} process for latex models is simple, and {{similar to the}} early stages of pottery production. <b>Plaster</b> <b>moulds</b> are made from a 'master' model. When the plaster is completely dry, a mix of liquid latex and an inert 'filler' is poured into the mould and left to stand until a coating of latex has developed around the inside of the mould. The remaining liquid latex is poured away for reuse, and the casting allowed to dry out until it is firm enough to be removed from the mould. This part of the process is identical to the way ceramics are cast. With the casting removed, the <b>plaster</b> <b>mould</b> is left to dry out, and cannot be reused until 100% dry once more. Each casting progressively destroys the interior of the mould, so after a relatively limited number of casts, the mould has to be discarded and new ones made from the master. This explains why each individual Julip is different even from other examples of the same breed and from the same mould.|$|R
