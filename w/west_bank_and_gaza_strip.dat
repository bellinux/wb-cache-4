5|$|In 2008, Bethlehem {{hosted the}} largest {{economic}} conference {{to date in}} the Palestinian territories. It was initiated by Palestinian Prime Minister and former Finance Minister Salam Fayyad to convince {{more than a thousand}} businessmen, bankers and government officials from throughout the Middle East to invest in the <b>West</b> <b>Bank</b> <b>and</b> <b>Gaza</b> <b>Strip.</b> A total of 1.4 billion US dollars was secured for business investments in the Palestinian territories.|$|E

5|$|On 28 September 2000, {{two days}} before the shooting, the Israeli {{opposition}} leader Ariel Sharon visited the Temple Mount in the Old City of Jerusalem, a holy site in both Judaism and Islam with contested rules of access. The violence that followed had its roots in several events, but the visit was provocative and triggered protests that escalated into rioting across the <b>West</b> <b>Bank</b> <b>and</b> <b>Gaza</b> <b>Strip.</b> The uprising became known as the Second Intifada; it lasted over four years and cost around 4,000 lives, over 3,000 of them Palestinian.|$|E
5|$|In {{accordance}} with {{the terms of the}} Oslo agreement, Arafat was required to implement PLO authority in the <b>West</b> <b>Bank</b> <b>and</b> <b>Gaza</b> <b>Strip.</b> He insisted that financial support was imperative to establishing this authority and needed it to secure the acceptance of the agreements by the Palestinians living in those areas. However, Arab states of the Persian Gulf—Arafat's usual source for financial backing—still refused to provide him and the PLO with any major donations for siding with Iraq during the 1991 Gulf War. Ahmed Qurei—a key Fatah negotiator during the negotiations in Oslo—publicly announced that the PLO was bankrupt.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Arafat and leading Fatah {{officials}} engaged the Israeli {{government in a}} series of secret talks and negotiations that led to the 1993 Oslo Accords. The agreement called for the implementation of Palestinian self-rule in portions of the <b>West</b> <b>Bank</b> <b>and</b> <b>Gaza</b> <b>Strip</b> over a five-year period, along with an immediate halt to and gradual removal of Israeli settlements in those areas. The accords called for a Palestinian police force to be formed from local recruits and Palestinians abroad, to patrol areas of self-rule. Authority over the various fields of rule, including education and culture, social welfare, direct taxation and tourism, would be transferred to the Palestinian interim government. Both parties agreed also on forming a committee that would establish cooperation and coordination dealing with specific economic sectors, including utilities, industry, trade and communication.|$|E
40|$|Israeli {{security}} measures, {{which were}} increased {{in response to}} the Intifada in 2000, have imposed a major cost on the economy of the West <b>Bank</b> <b>and</b> <b>Gaza,</b> <b>and</b> are heavily undercutting its current and future developmental capacity. The closures regime - the multi-faceted system of restrictions on the movement of goods and people both within the West <b>Bank</b> <b>and</b> <b>Gaza</b> <b>and</b> through Israel {{to the rest of the}} world - along with construction of the “Separation Barrier” have fragmented the West <b>Bank’s</b> <b>and</b> <b>Gaza’s</b> economic space, <b>and</b> have further reduced their productive potential. The aim of this paper is to estimate the economic costs of the closures regime on the Palestinian economy.

5|$|The Six-Day {{war began}} when Israel {{launched}} {{air strikes against}} Egypt's air force on 5 June 1967. The war ended in an Arab defeat and Israel's occupation of several Arab territories, including the <b>West</b> <b>Bank</b> <b>and</b> <b>Gaza</b> <b>Strip.</b> Although Nasser and his Arab allies had been defeated, Arafat and Fatah could claim a victory, in {{that the majority of}} Palestinians, who had up to that time tended to align and sympathize with individual Arab governments, now began to agree that a 'Palestinian' solution to their dilemma was indispensable. Many primarily Palestinian political parties, including George Habash's Arab Nationalist Movement, Hajj Amin al-Husseini's Arab Higher Committee, the Islamic Liberation Front and several Syrian-backed groups, virtually crumbled after their sponsor governments' defeat. Barely a week after the defeat, Arafat crossed the Jordan River in disguise and entered the West Bank, where he set up recruitment centers in Hebron, the Jerusalem area and Nablus, and began attracting both fighters and financiers for his cause.|$|E
