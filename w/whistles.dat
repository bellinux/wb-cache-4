5|$|A {{variety of}} vocalizations are used and, like other corvids, grey jays may mimic other bird species, {{especially}} predators. Calls include a whistled quee-oo, and various clicks and chuckles. When predators are spotted, the bird announces {{a series of}} harsh clicks to signal a threat on the ground, or a series of repeated <b>whistles</b> to indicate a predator in the air.|$|E
5|$|Although it is a mimid, {{the black}} catbird {{is not known}} to imitate any other species. Its song {{is a mix of}} harsh notes and clear flute-like <b>whistles,</b> with the phrases repeated. It builds a cup nest in low bushes or trees, and lays two bluish eggs. It is {{threatened}} by habitat loss, and has been assessed as near threatened by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature.|$|E
5|$|Early {{means of}} {{communicating}} over a distance included visual signals, such as beacons, smoke signals, semaphore telegraphs, signal flags, and optical heliographs. Other examples of pre-modern long-distance communication included audio messages such as coded drumbeats, lung-blown horns, and loud <b>whistles.</b> 20th and 21st century technologies for long-distance communication usually involve electrical and electromagnetic technologies, such as telegraph, telephone, and teleprinter, networks, radio, microwave transmission, fiber optics, and communications satellites.|$|E
50|$|Organ <b>whistle</b> - a <b>whistle</b> with mouths {{cut in the}} side, {{usually a}} long <b>whistle</b> in {{relation}} to diameter, hence the name. These <b>whistle</b> were very common on steamships, especially those manufactured in the UK.|$|R

5000|$|Although not {{as popular}} as [...] "stealing the T," [...] the <b>whistle</b> has been stolen several times. The first ever Tech <b>whistle</b> {{installed}} in the late 1890s was stolen in 1902. [...] The <b>whistle</b> was returned to Dean Griffin in 1949 as a retirement gift. [...] The second theft of the <b>whistle</b> occurred in 1963, {{when a group of}} students nicknamed the [...] "Magnificent 7" [...] stole the <b>whistle.</b> Fearing Institute repercussions, the group returned the <b>whistle</b> in the spring of 1964. [...] The <b>whistle</b> was again stolen in 1978 by a group nicknamed the [...] "Committee of Five". The <b>whistle</b> was also stolen in 1969 and 1997. Both times the <b>whistle</b> was returned almost immediately after its theft. In 1969, the <b>whistle</b> was given to the student body president as a graduation gift a month after its theft and the 1997 theft was solved when President Clough found the <b>whistle</b> on his lawn a day after its theft.|$|R
5|$|Like all cetaceans, {{killer whales}} depend heavily on {{underwater}} sound for orientation, feeding, and communication. They produce {{three categories of}} sounds: clicks, <b>whistles,</b> and pulsed calls. Clicks {{are believed to be}} used primarily for navigation and discriminating prey and other objects in the surrounding environment, but are also commonly heard during social interactions.|$|E
5|$|Like other corvids, ravens can mimic {{sounds from}} their environment, {{including}} human speech. Non-vocal sounds {{produced by the}} common raven include wing <b>whistles</b> and bill snapping. Clapping or clicking has been observed more often in females than in males. If {{a member of a}} pair is lost, its mate reproduces the calls of its lost partner to encourage its return.|$|E
5|$|Musical accompaniment may be {{as simple}} as {{clapping}} hands and stomping feet, but traditional instruments include bells worn by dancers, clappers, drums and talking drums, flutes, horns, rattles, scrapers, stringed instruments, <b>whistles,</b> and xylophones; the exact combination varies with ethnic group and region. Some performers sing complete songs by themselves, accompanied by a harplike instrument.|$|E

It is endemic to the island of Sumatra in Indonesia. In the past, it has often been lumped together with the Javan <b>whistling</b> thrush (M. glaucinus) and Bornean <b>whistling</b> thrush (M. borneensis) as the [...] "Sunda <b>whistling</b> thrush" [...] (M. glaucinus) but it is now often regarded as a separate species based on differences in plumage and measurements.|$|R

5|$|Several Australian species {{practice}} acoustic and vibration {{behavior as}} {{an aspect of}} courtship. They have been observed producing hisses and <b>whistles</b> from air forced through the spiracles. Furthermore, {{in the presence of}} a potential mate, some cockroaches tap the substrate in a rhythmic, repetitive manner. Acoustic signals may be of greater prevalence amongst perching species, particularly those that live on low vegetation in Australia's tropics.|$|E
5|$|The {{calls of}} the two species are not similar. The call of the greater melampitta is a double or triple note, which is slurred and {{repeated}} monotonously, and {{is reminiscent of the}} black pitohui. The call of the lesser melampitta are either harsh buzzy notes or chirped <b>whistles,</b> both of which are repeated at intervals.|$|E
5|$|The {{masked shrike}} gives the harsh calls typical of this family, with {{repeated}} tsr, tzr or shek notes and some <b>whistles,</b> and when alarmed produces a rattling krrrr. The bill may be snapped when {{the bird is}} agitated. The song, up to a minute long, is soft for a shrike, with chattering sounds interspersed with rich warbles. It resembles the songs of Hippolais species, particularly the olive-tree warbler. On rare occasions, males may sing in flight.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Whistle</b> length - The natural {{resonant}} frequency decreases as {{the length of}} the <b>whistle</b> is increased. Doubling the effective length of a <b>whistle</b> reduces the frequency by one half, assuming that the <b>whistle</b> cross-sectional area is uniform. A <b>whistle</b> is a quarter-wave generator, which means that a sound wave generated by a <b>whistle</b> is about four times the <b>whistle</b> length. If the speed of sound in the steam supplied to a <b>whistle</b> were 15936 inches per second, a pipe with a 15-inch effective length blowing its natural frequency would sound near Middle C: 15936/(4 x 15) = 266 Hz. When a <b>whistle</b> is sounding its natural frequency, the effective length referred to here is somewhat longer than the physical length above the mouth if the <b>whistle</b> is of uniform cross-sectional area. That is, the vibrating length of the <b>whistle</b> includes some portion of the mouth. This effect (the “end correction”) is caused by the vibrating steam inside the <b>whistle</b> engaging vibration of some steam outside the enclosed pipe, where there is a transition from plane waves to spherical waves. Formulas are available to estimate the effective length of a <b>whistle,</b> but an accurate formula to predict sounding frequency would have to incorporate <b>whistle</b> length, scale, gas flow rate, mouth height, and mouth wall area (see below).|$|R

50|$|Most Mazatec {{communities}} employ {{forms of}} <b>whistle</b> speech, in which linguistic utterances {{are produced by}} <b>whistling</b> the tonal contours of words and phrases. Mazatec languages lend themselves very well to becoming <b>whistling</b> languages {{because of the high}} functional load of tone in Mazatec grammar and semantics. <b>Whistling</b> is extremely common among young men who often have complex conversations conducted entirely through <b>whistling.</b> Women on the other hand do not generally use <b>whistle</b> speech, just as older males use it more rarely than younger ones. Small boys learn to <b>whistle</b> simultaneously with learning to talk. <b>Whistling</b> is generally used for communicating over a distance, {{to attract the attention of}} passersby or to avoid interfering with ongoing spoken conversations, but even economic transactions can be conducted entirely through <b>whistling.</b> Since <b>whistle</b> speech does not encode information about vowel or consonants but only tone, it is often ambiguous with several possible meanings; however since most <b>whistling</b> treats a limited number of topics it is normally unproblematic to disambiguate meaning through context.|$|R
5|$|The {{music of}} Chad {{includes}} {{a number of}} unusual instruments such as the kinde, a type of bow harp; the kakaki, a long tin horn; and the hu hu, a stringed instrument that uses calabashes as loudspeakers. Other instruments and their combinations are more linked to specific ethnic groups: the Sara prefer <b>whistles,</b> balafones, harps and kodjo drums; and the Kanembu combine the sounds of drums with those of flute-like instruments.|$|E

5|$|This munia eats mainly {{grass seeds}} apart from berries and small insects. They forage in flocks and {{communicate}} with soft calls and <b>whistles.</b> The species is highly social and may sometimes roost with other species of munias. This species is found in tropical plains and grasslands. Breeding pairs construct dome-shaped nests using grass or bamboo leaves.|$|E
25|$|Different <b>whistling</b> styles {{may be used}} in {{a single}} language. Sochiapam Chinantec has three {{different}} words for whistle-speech: sie3 for <b>whistling</b> with the tongue against the alveolar ridge, jui̵32 for bilabial <b>whistling,</b> and juo2 for finger-in-the-mouth <b>whistling.</b> These are used for communication over varying distances. There is also a kind of loud falsetto (hóh32) which functions in some ways like <b>whistled</b> speech.|$|R

40|$|<b>Whistle</b> blowing’ {{means to}} blow a <b>whistle</b> calling {{attention}} to practices which an individual considers as immoral or illegal and harmful to the public. Some people think <b>whistle</b> blowing is a good or right act; others consider it wrong. There are numerous reports concerning blowing the <b>whistle</b> in scientific research. I place <b>whistle</b> blowing {{in the context of}} institutions, focusing on good clinical practice and Research Ethics Committees. Many research activities take place resulting in monetary and personal gain which may influence research conduct. I explore some issues in the development and organization of Research Ethics Committees, discuss the nature of <b>whistle</b> blowing and <b>whistle</b> blowers, and examine some <b>whistle</b> blowing incidents in scientific research. I conclude that although the function of Research Ethics Committees does not necessarily include mechanisms for <b>whistle</b> blowing, that this idea has merit and should be considered...|$|R
