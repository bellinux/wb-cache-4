In both series metallic bonding is initiated when a critical value of the compressive plastic strain is reached. A small increase in the strain beyond this threshold leads to full metallic bonding. In Series II the soft-annealed AA 5183 material rapidly <b>work-hardens</b> during upsetting until the pressure at the contact section becomes {{equal to that of}} the cold-deformed AA 5183 material. At this point the two interfaces start to mate before the bonding process eventually commences. In Series III the soft commercial purity AA 1050 material is unable to <b>work-harden</b> to any great extent. Instead, the cold-deformed AA 5183 material starts to penetrate the soft AA 1050 wire. This leads to build-up of an internal extrusion pressure approaching that of the cold-deformed AA 5183 material. The local material flow pattern occurring at the interface will then determine the actual surface exposure at which full metallic bonding is achieved. </p...|$|R

With an unpainted stainless body, the stainless steel must be reworked to exactly the original shape, contour, and grain—which is a tremendously difficult job on regular steel (a dented or bent panel is stretched and a shrinking hammer or other techniques must be used to unstretch the metal) and even more difficult with stainless due to its tendency to <b>work-harden.</b> Furthermore, it is exceedingly difficult to paint stainless steel due to difficulties with paint adhesion.
