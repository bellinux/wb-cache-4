In {{fault tree}} analysis, the system failure {{probability}} and the component importance measures cannot totally include {{the contribution of}} all the component existing states to system reliability.

And the system equivalent failure probability is finally attained. Analysis shows that: (1) equivalent failure probability not only includes the contribution of critical states of component to system reliability, but also the non-critical states of component are considered; and (2) it may provide a thorough assessment of system reliability and is useful for reliability design...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new parametric optimization approach {{based on a}} modified particle swarm optimization (PSO) to design a class of impulsive-correction projectiles with discrete, flexible-time interval, and finite-energy control. In terms of optimal control theory, the task is described as the formulation of minimum <b>working</b> <b>number</b> of impulses and minimum control error, which involves reference model linearization, boundary conditions, and discontinuous objective function. These result in difficulties in finding the global optimum solution by directly utilizing any other optimization approaches, for example, Hp-adaptive pseudospectral method. Consequently, PSO mechanism is employed for optimal setting of impulsive control by considering the time intervals between two neighboring lateral impulses as design variables, which makes the briefness of the optimization process. A modification on basic PSO algorithm is developed to improve the convergence speed of this optimization through linearly decreasing the inertial weight. In addition, a suboptimal control and guidance law based on PSO technique are put forward for the real-time consideration of the online design in practice. Finally, a simulation case coupled with a nonlinear flight dynamic model is applied to validate the modified PSO control algorithm. The results of comparative study illustrate that the proposed optimal control algorithm has a good performance in obtaining the optimal control efficiently and accurately and provides a reference approach to handling such impulsive-correction problem...|$|E

40|$|Our {{aim was to}} {{determine}} whether clinician-identified poor compliance is useful in identifying, from among adults with severe asthma, patients with characteristics likely to put them at risk of adverse outcomes. Patients with severe asthma (previous hospital admissions and/or prescribed step 4 - 5 treatment according to British Thoracic Society guidelines) considered by clinicians to be either compliant (C, N = 41) or poorly compliant (PC, N = 92) with aspects of their recommended management (attendance at appointments, taking medication, and monitoring asthma) provided data on symptoms, health service use, medication, self-management practices, physical and psychological comorbidities, and sociodemographic/socioeconomic characteristics. Cross-sectional univariate analyses were used to examine whether the groups differed with respect to self-reported indicators of asthma morbidity and self-management. Logistic regressions were additionally used to explore psychosocial factors independently associated with patients being identified as PC. Compared with C patients, PC patients had significantly poorer self-reported asthma control in terms of medication use, symptoms, time off work, asthma-specific quality of life, primary care visits, emergency attendances, and hospital admissions. This was coupled with poorer self-management practices. Patients identified as PC also had higher levels of physical and psychological comorbidities, were younger, and faced more difficult social and economic circumstances. We identified significant psychological (anxiety) and social (younger age, not <b>working,</b> <b>number</b> of benefits, adverse family circumstances) factors independently associated with patients being identified as PC. Among adults with severe asthma, clinician-assessed poor compliance was useful in distinguishing between two groups that differed significantly in terms of asthma morbidity indicators, self-management practices, and psychosocial characteristics, which have been previously shown to be associated with hospital admissions, near-fatal attacks, and fatal asthma. We conclude that clinician-assessed poor compliance is a useful marker for identifying patients at risk of these adverse outcomes...|$|E
40|$|Leaf {{shape in}} wild plants has {{diversely}} evolved from ancient times. A lot of researchers have challenged to elucidate mechanisms of the evolutional dynamics in plant leaf shape. Several studies {{carried out by}} using genetic model plants, such as Arabidopsis thaliana, Antirrhinum majus or Lycopersicon esculentum revealed {{a part of the}} genetic basis of variation in leaf shape. However, to get the general picture of evolutional dynamics in plant leaf shape, more studies are needed. We can divide things to three dimensions called length, width and height. Thus, he thought that three-dimensional classification of leaves would help to elucidate leaf-shape diversity. In previous studies, two classes of mutants, namely angustifolia (an) type and rotundifolia (rot) type with a specific alteration in either width or length of the leaf blade were identified in Arabidopsis. In both an and rot 3 mutants, the leaf shape alteration is caused by the altered cell shape. However, the leaf dwarfism or the diversity of leaf shape is mainly caused by the variation of the cell number in wild plants. Therefore, he analyzed a dominant mutant, rotundifolia 4 - 1 D (rot 4 - 1 D), which possessed short leaves and floral organs caused by reduction of the cell number. On the other hand, variation of leaf thickness is mainly due to alteration of cell volume and/or cell number in wild plants. He have also isolated a mutant, <b>working</b> <b>number</b> N 692, which possessed thick leaves caused by unusual cell expansion in the leaf thickness direction in Arabidopsis. 　In rot 4 - 1 D, anatomical observations showed that the altered leaf shape is caused by reduced cell proliferation specifically in the longtitudinal (proximal-distal) axis of the leaf, suggesting that the ROT 4 gene controls polar cell proliferation in lateral organs. The ROT 4 gene encodes a novel small peptide consisting of 53 amino acid residues. ROT 4 open reading frame had not been identified in the Arabidopsis genome annotation. He cloned ROT 4 full-length cDNA and registered it to the GenBank as accession number AB 107209. ROT 4 mRNA accumulates at a higher level in rot 4 - 1 D compared to wild type. Over-expression of a ROT 4 -green fluorescence protein (GFP) fusion protein in transgenic plants recapitulated the rot 4 - 1 D phenotype suggesting that ROT 4 acts to restrict cell proliferation. The ROT 4 -GEP fusion protein localized to the plasma membrane when expressed in transgenic Arabidopsis plants. Database search and phylogenetic analysis indicate that ROT 4 defines a novel, seed plant-specific family of small peptides with 22 members in Arabidopsis, ROT FOUR LIKE 1 - 22 (RTFL 1 - 22), and all RTFL members share a conserved 29 amino acid domain, the RTF domain. ROT 4 contains N-terminal region (16 amino acid residues), RTF domain and C-terminal region (8 amino acid residues), and over-expression of the ROT 4 truncated N-terminal region or C-terminal region was sufficient to confer a rot 4 - 1 D phenotype. Loss-of-function mutations in several RTFL genes were aphenotypic in Arabidopsis or Oryza sativa suggesting that there may be some functional redundancy among family members. RT-PCR analysis revealed that ROT 4 is expressed in the shoot apex and young leaves of wild-type plants, consistent with a role for ROT 4 in controlling polarity-dependent cell proliferation during wild-type leaf morphogenesis. 　On the other hand, mutants with only changed leaf thickness had not been isolated. Therefore, as the first step to study thickness control in leaves, he developed an instrument, called Leaf Thickness Measurement Instrument (LTMI) that can measure the thickness of Arabidopsis living leaves reproducibly by a laser displacement sensor. The conventional measurement method requires several complicated and time consuming steps, such as fixation, embedding, slicing of the samples by microtome and finally observation under microscope. These steps can be omitted by using LTMI. Thick-leaved mutants were screened from a T-DNA activation-tagged library of C 24 by using LTMI. By screening more than 2000 lines, he isolated three mutants N 692, N 865 and N 091 with thicker or thinner leaves than wild type. He mainly analyzed N 692 which has the most altered leaf thickness among the three mutants. The thickness of N 692 leaves was 158 ± 10 μm, while that of wild-type C 24 leaves was 126 ± 6 μm. In addition, leaves of N 692 are tight, while those of wild type are waved and curly. Moreover, the stem of N 692 is thicker than that of wild type. Anatomical analysis showed that palisade cells of N 692 expand isotropically and number of the cells per leaf is reduced. As a result, the leaf blade area of N 692 is equal to that of wild type. It is thought that compensation occurs in leaf area but not occurs in leaf thickness direction. A mutant which has such phenotype is unprecedent. 　Recently, movement of an application from outcome of model plants to properties of other wild plants has occurred in morphogenesis and related fields. In addition to an-like and rot-like mutants, by the isolation of N 692, a description with three-dimensional geometry has been possible. It is thought analysis of seed-plant specific ROT 4 and RTFL genes is suitable to apply for estimation of leaf shape in wild plants. Building on our previous success in the identification of AN and ROT 3 genes, the present study of rot 4 - 1 D and N 692 will possibly help to illustrate the variety of leaf shape in wild plants...|$|E
