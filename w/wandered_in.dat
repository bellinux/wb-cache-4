Ever since he was little he had <b>wandered</b> <b>in</b> the dark woods of Småland imagining all the creatures living there. His paintings frequently included detailed depictions of plants, mosses, lichens and mushrooms found in the Swedish woods. He {{is best known for}} his illustrations of Among Gnomes and Trolls.|$|E
5|$|Having firmly {{assisted}} {{and supported}} {{her husband on}} his path to political greatness, she suddenly died in 1890, aged 39, leaving him, distraught and bereft of her support, to achieve the political destiny which she had plotted. His premiership of the United Kingdom was shambolic, and lasted barely a year. For over thirty years following her death, he <b>wandered</b> <b>in</b> a political wilderness, directionless and exceedingly eccentric, until his own death in 1929.|$|E

25|$|The Crossing of the Rhine in 405/6 brought unmanageable {{numbers of}} German and Alan barbarians (perhaps some 30,000 warriors, 100,000 people) into Gaul.

25|$|Early {{the next}} morning, Abraham brought Hagar and Ishmael out together. He gave her bread {{and water and}} sent them away. The two <b>wandered</b> <b>in</b> the {{wilderness}} of Beersheba until her bottle of water was completely consumed. In a moment of despair, she burst into tears. After God heard the boy's voice, an angel of the Lord confirmed to Hagar that he would become a great nation. A well of water then appeared so that it saved their lives. As the boy grew, he became a skilled archer living in the wilderness of Paran. Eventually his mother found a wife for Ishmael from her home country, the land of Egypt.|$|E
25|$|Jacobs <b>wandered</b> <b>in</b> {{northern}} California and Mexico {{for several}} years under several aliases, taking drugs and drinking heavily. He was almost captured once in California, but escaped by climbing out a window and escaping across a roof. Jacobs traveled to Canada, where his older brother was attending Simon Fraser University. The two did not meet often, {{in part because they}} looked alike but also because the FBI and Royal Canadian Mounted Police were still watching Robert in the hopes JJ would visit him. Jacobs first settled on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, and worked at planting trees—donating most of his money to the building of a Buddhist temple on nearby Saltspring Island.|$|E

40|$|Open Access articleWandering {{is one of}} {{the most}} frequent, problematic, and {{injurious}} behaviors of elderly people with dementia. It often leads to negative consequences such as falling and getting lost. With increasing proliferation of sensing, communication, and computing techniques, inexpensive technological solutions have been developed to tackle problems associated with <b>wandering.</b> <b>In</b> this article, we review field research and technological solutions on <b>wandering</b> <b>in</b> the context of assisted living for the elderly. Specifically, we present the most cited definition and classification for <b>wandering</b> proposed <b>in</b> <b>wandering</b> behavior research. We further examine existing solutions for managing <b>wandering</b> <b>in</b> terms of our proposed categorization of wandering research, namely event monitoring-based wandering discovery, trajectory tracking-based wandering detection, and location combined with Geofence-based prevention of wandering-related adverse results. Based on the definition, categorization, and the state of the art, we discuss the major research challenges and future directions <b>in</b> detecting <b>wandering</b> locomotion <b>in</b> different settings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey on wandering and technological solutions in this niche area of ambient assisted living...|$|R

25|$|Encouraged by {{the success}} at Uva, the Kandyans grew bolder. They {{infiltrated}} nearby hills and raised battle cries at night in order to demoralize the enemy. A body of 150 Portuguese under Francisco de Brito and 300 Lascarins under Pedro Afonso were sent to drive them away. Leaving without a guide they soon got lost, and <b>wandered</b> <b>in</b> the hills for almost two days. On the third day they sent a detachment of Lascarins to find {{the way back to}} the camp. The Lascarins surprised a group of Kandyans, whom they killed; some of them were identified as household servants of Jayavira Bandara Mudali.|$|E
25|$|Periods {{of rapid}} climate change {{generally}} saw {{a collapse of}} this mixed Mediterranean farming system; commercial production was replaced with subsistence agricultural foodstuffs; and transhumance pastoralism became a year-round nomadic pastoral activity, whilst tribal groups <b>wandered</b> <b>in</b> a circular pattern north to the Euphrates, or south to the Egyptian delta with their flocks. Occasionally, tribal chieftains would emerge, raiding enemy settlements and rewarding loyal followers from the spoils or by tariffs levied on merchants. Should the cities band together and retaliate, a neighbouring state intervene or should the chieftain suffer a reversal of fortune, allies would fall away or intertribal feuding would return. It {{has been suggested that}} the Patriarchal tales of the Bible reflect such social forms. During the periods of the collapse of Akkadian Empire in Mesopotamia and the First Intermediate Period of Egypt, the Hyksos invasions {{and the end of the}} Middle Bronze Age in Assyria and Babylonia, and the Late Bronze Age collapse, trade through the Canaanite area would dwindle, as Egypt, Babylonia, and to a lesser degree Assyria, withdrew into their isolation. When the climates stabilized, trade would resume firstly along the coast in the area of the Philistine and Phoenician cities. As markets redeveloped, new trade routes that would avoid the heavy tariffs of the coast would develop from Kadesh Barnea, through Hebron, Lachish, Jerusalem, Bethel, Samaria, Shechem, Shiloh through Galilee to Jezreel, Hazor and Megiddo. Secondary Canaanite cities would develop in this region. Further economic development would see the creation of a third trade route from Eilath, Timna, Edom (Seir), Moab, Ammon and thence to the Aramean states of Damascus and Palmyra. Earlier states (for example the Philistines and Tyrians in the case of Judah and Samaria, for the second route, and Judah and Israel for the third route) tried generally unsuccessfully to control the interior trade.|$|E

500|$|Orion {{is used by}} Horace, {{who tells}} of his death {{at the hands of}} Diana/Artemis, and by Ovid, in his Fasti for May 11, the middle day of the Lemuria, when (in Ovid's time) the {{constellation}} Orion set with the sun. Ovid's episode tells the story of Hyrieus and two gods, Jupiter and Neptune, although Ovid is bashful about the climax; Ovid makes Hyrieus a poor man, which means the sacrifice of an entire ox is more generous. There is also a single mention of Orion in his Art of Love, as a sufferer from unrequited love: [...] "Pale Orion <b>wandered</b> <b>in</b> the forest for Side." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{burden of}} Matthias's wars and splendid royal court mainly {{fell on the}} peasants, who paid at least 85% of the taxes.

However, stories about [...] "Matthias the Just", who <b>wandered</b> <b>in</b> {{disguise}} throughout his realm to deliver justice to his subjects, seem to have spread during Matthias's reign. The saying [...] "Dead is Matthias, lost is justice" [...] became popular soon after his death, reflecting that commoners {{were more likely to}} have received a fair trial in Matthias's reign than under his successors. Matthias is also the subject of popular folk tales in Croatia, Hungary, Serbia, and Slovenia. For instance, the philandering King Matjaž is one of the sleeping kings of Slovenian folklore.|$|E
