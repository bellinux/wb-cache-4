5|$|Arsenal {{began to}} play <b>with</b> <b>purpose</b> once going behind, {{but for the rest}} of the half {{struggled}} to get the better of Luton's defence. A long ball by Davis sent Rocastle charging forward in the 16th minute, and momentarily upset Luton's shape, but it was caught by Dibble. The Luton goalkeeper was again called into action when Arsenal were awarded a set piece; Sansom slid the ball to Nigel Winterburn, whose shot was gathered. Foster made a timely challenge on Davis on the edge of the penalty area to end another Arsenal attack; Graham's team had been more threatening on right-hand flank with Rocastle and Winterburn. Harford, who had been a long figure up front for Luton, still managed to trouble the Arsenal defence with little service; near the end of the first half, he collected a pass from the left, bypassed his marker Adams and aimed his shot at goal, which went wide of the right-hand post.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps no {{director}} better displayed {{that spirit}} than the German-born Robert Siodmak, {{who had already}} made a score of films before his 1940 arrival in Hollywood. Working mostly on A features, he made eight films now regarded as classic-era film noirs (a figure matched only by Lang and Mann). In addition to The Killers, Burt Lancaster's debut and a Hellinger/Universal co-production, Siodmak's other important contributions to the genre include 1944's Phantom Lady (a top-of-the-line B and Woolrich adaptation), the ironically titled Christmas Holiday (1944), and Cry of the City (1948). Criss Cross (1949), with Lancaster again the lead, exemplifies how Siodmak brought {{the virtues of the}} B-movie to the A noir. In addition to the relatively looser constraints on character and message at lower budgets, the nature of B production lent itself to the noir style for economic reasons: dim lighting saved on electricity and helped cloak cheap sets (mist and smoke also served the cause); night shooting was often compelled by hurried production schedules; plots with obscure motivations and intriguingly elliptical transitions were sometimes the consequence of hastily written scripts, of which there was not always enough time or money to shoot every scene. In Criss Cross, Siodmak achieved these effects <b>with</b> <b>purpose,</b> wrapping them around Yvonne De Carlo, playing the most understandable of femme fatales; Dan Duryea, in one of his many charismatic villain roles; and Lancaster as an ordinary laborer turned armed robber, doomed by a romantic obsession.|$|E

[...] Devin Faraci of Empire {{magazine}} also gave a positive rating of {{four out of five}} stars, saying: [...] "McG has sparked a moribund franchise back to life, giving fans the post-apocalyptic action they've been craving since they first saw a metal foot crush a human skull two decades ago." [...] However, on CHUD, the latter said, [...] "Bale's desire to star as John Connor was probably the most fatal blow to the film; it completely distorted the shape of the story as it existed." [...] Furthermore, he expressed that the third act was when the film began falling apart, saying, [...] "McG and Nolan muddied the end of the picture, delivering action generics (yet another Terminator fight in a factory) while never finding their own hook that would give this movie more of an impact than you would get from an expanded universe novel." [...] In contrast, James Berardinelli considered the ending {{the best part of the}} film, feeling that the first two-thirds were [...] "rambling and disjointed" [...] and that the lack of a central villain was only fixed when the T-800 appeared.|$|E

Angered at the implication, Brian begins insulting Stewie, who bitterly retaliates by revealing that he could have gone all day without having his diaper changed, and only thinks of Brian as a passing amusement and [...] "the best of a bad situation". Stewie dares Brian to shoot him with the revolver in the deposit, which Brian earlier said to be bullet-free. It is revealed that Brian lied, and he attempts to shoot Stewie. The two then find a security camera hanging on a wall of the vault. Brian tries to use it to call for help, but Stewie points out if there was someone out there, they would have been saved. Brian then realizes that the camera has recorded him cleaning Stewie, which amuses the infant, but Brian is upset about gaining a laughingstock reputation. Stewie then prematurely causes the gun to discharge, causing the bullet to randomly ricochet off the vault walls, smashing Stewie's already-broken phone and the bottle of Scotch, and forcing the two under the table.|$|E

Already Radical crowds were demonstrating against the harsh imposition of Malthusian ideas in the Poor Laws, and a slump was resulting in mass emigration.

2500|$|Through the 19th {{century the}} term creationism most {{commonly}} referred to direct creation of individual souls, in contrast to traducianism. Following the publication of Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation, there was interest in ideas of Creation by divine law. In particular, the liberal theologian Baden Powell argued that this illustrated the Creator's power better than the idea of miraculous creation, which he thought ridiculous. When On the Origin of Species was published, the cleric Charles Kingsley wrote of evolution as [...] "just as noble a conception of Deity." [...] Darwin's view {{at the time was}} of God creating life through the laws of nature, and the book makes several references to [...] "creation," [...] though he later regretted using the term rather than calling it an unknown process.

Theistic evolution, also called, evolutionary creation, became a popular compromise, and St. George Jackson Mivart was among those accepting evolution but attacking Darwin's naturalistic mechanism.
