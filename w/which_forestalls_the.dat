40|$|Consumer {{incentives}} {{are reflected in}} a wide range of choices, many of which occur in both insurance- and tax-financed health care systems. However, health insurance and sick leave pay cause consumer incentives to be reflected in moral hazard effects of several types. Theoretically, ex ante moral hazard (a reduction of preventive effort in response to insurance coverage) is not unambiguously predicted, and there is very limited empirical evidence about it. The case for static ex post moral hazard (an increase in the demand for medical care of a given technology) is stronger. The empirical evidence reported comes from three sources, natural experiments, observational comparisons of individuals, and the Health Insurance Experiment (HIE). The distinguishing feature of the HIE is that participants were assigned to insurance plans, <b>which</b> <b>forestalls</b> <b>the</b> possibility of good risks self-selecting plans with substantial cost sharing, resulting in an overestimate of the effects of plan design on health care expenditure. While the values of estimated price elasticities vary widely among the three sources and less markedly according to the type of care (outpatient, hospital, dental, mental), the responsiveness of the demand for medical care to net price is beyond doubt. The pure price elasticity for medical care in excess of a deductible (i. e. where the marginal price is constant) was estimated by HIE at - 0. 2 overall. Finally, there may be a dynamic moral hazard effect (choice biased in favor of new, usually more expensive medical technology). Here, the empirical evidence is very scanty again. Another promising field for future research is the interplay between consumer incentives and rationing by the physician in managed care. ...|$|E

On 10 June, German tanks and infantry made several attacks on the 6th Airborne Division in <b>the</b> Orne bridgehead, <b>which</b> <b>forestalled</b> <b>the</b> British attack. The [...] Germans were repulsed {{with the help of}} naval gunfire and then counter-attacked; a captured German officer remarked that his [...] "battalion had been virtually wiped out" [...] during twelve hours of fighting. In the evening, a German attack on Ranville was repulsed with many German casualties. The vanguard of the 51st Highland Division arrived during the evening and attacked Bréville at dawn, which was also a costly failure; other elements of the division quickly secured Touffréville. During the afternoon of 11 June, The Queen's Own Rifles of Canada and 1st Hussars attacked Le Mesnil-Patry to assist the advance of the 69th Brigade of the 50th Northumbrian Division but the attack was another costly failure. On 12 June, German attacks were launched from the Bréville area against the Orne bridgehead. Fighting lasted all day and casualties were severe on both sides but during the evening the Germans pulled back. To close the gap in the British perimeter, {{the decision was made to}} secure Bréville and the 12th Battalion the Parachute Regiment captured the village by midnight but had 141 casualties among 160 men in the attack. The 51st Highland Division was opposed by the 21st Panzer Division in its efforts to push south to Saint Honorine and with the Highlanders contained, the offensive east of Caen was called off on 13 June.|$|R
40|$|The {{reign of}} Queen Cleopatra VII of Egypt offers a rare {{historical}} glimpse into ancient communication activities and how communication {{was used by}} the world’s last pharaoh. This historical research reveals how Cleopatra used public relations and strategic communication activities to advance both her reign as a lone woman sovereign and the interests of the Egyptian empire. Cleopatra was perhaps the first woman sovereign in history to rule alone for a period of over a decade. Her leadership showed skilled use of public communication and diplomacy with <b>which</b> she <b>forestalled</b> <b>the</b> fall of Egypt to Rome. A grounded theory approach allowed data to emerge naturally, surrounding communication activities, and then for a theoretical framework to be imposed that could explain the common themes in that data. This research compares Cleopatra’s activities with public relations theory using the classic four models of public relations to classify public communication. Findings show that Cleopatra used research in asymmetrical public relations and symmetrical relationship building, also including public diplomacy, public information, and press agentry/pseudo-event mastery. Careful examination of literature sources led to the conclusion that Cleopatra was a truly advanced, research-based, relationship-focused, and international policy-oriented lone woman ruler who was a supremely strategic communicator...|$|R
40|$|Numerous human behavior' {{problems}} {{are characterized by}} a choice between small-immediate and large-delayed reinforcement. Individuals often choose the poorer or smaller of two alternative rewards, even when {{they seem to be}} entirely familiar' with both alternatives. In a typical situation choice behavior appears to have a short-term advantage which is later followed by an obvious disadvantage. Selection of the delayed-large reward has been termed self-control. Recent work in the animal laboratory has lead to a model off serf-control that may be partially understood in terms of gradients of delayed reinforcement. This model, developed by George Ainslie and Howard Rachlin, suggest that the self-control situation can be conceptualized as a choice between a small-immediate and a larger-delayed reinforcer whose effective control over behavior is positively accelerated as its availability approaches. Aislie and Rachlin’s model makes two predictions: the first predicts a reversal in preference between two reward options as a function of passing time. The second conceptualizes self-control as a process <b>which</b> involves <b>forestalling</b> <b>the</b> temporary effectiveness that some small rewards acquire {{as a result of their}} temporal position. Thus, the model predicts that, given an appropriate opportunity, an organism will commit itself to receiving only the delayed-larger reward. The present research attempted to determine if these two predictions can be confirmed with children, using points on a counter, later exchanged for money as the reinforcer. Children were exposed to a choice between a small-immediate reward and a large-delayed reward in which the time elapsing before making a choice was lengthened systematically. An opportunity to commit themselves to receiving only the large-delayed reward was also provided. Results were congruent with the predictions of the model, although support was not robust and open to alternative explanations. Areas needing refinement include the nature of reinforcer used and the relationship between the amount and length of time delays. Thesis (D. Ed. ...|$|R
