5|$|African-Americans were enlisted during World War I, {{but this}} was halted in 1919 and they were mustered out of the Navy. Starting in the 1930s a few <b>were</b> <b>recruited</b> to serve as {{stewards}} in the officers mess. African-Americans <b>were</b> <b>recruited</b> in larger numbers only after Roosevelt insisted in 1942.|$|E
5|$|During Israel's polio {{epidemic}} {{in the early}} 1950s, Shaare Zedek was the only hospital in Jerusalem with an isolation ward. Schwester Selma displayed unceasing devotion to {{the running of the}} iron lung machines, teaching and supervising the untrained personnel who <b>were</b> <b>recruited</b> to work in the ward.|$|E
5|$|Kafka {{majored in}} {{communication}} studies at Northwestern University. Mike's brother, Jason, is a pitcher {{for the independent}} Windy City ThunderBolts and attended St. Rita of Cascia High School.

5|$|The first Swedish {{emigrant}} guidebook {{was published}} {{as early as}} 1841, the year Unonius left, and nine handbooks were published between 1849 and 1855. Substantial groups of lumberjacks and iron miners <b>were</b> <b>recruited</b> directly by company agents in Sweden. Agents recruiting construction builders for American railroads also appeared, the first in 1854, scouting for the Illinois Central Railroad.|$|E
5|$|The hajduks, {{who were}} Ottoman subjects, <b>were</b> <b>recruited</b> by the Republic of Venice as guerilla forces to co-operate in the defence of the Venetian–Ottoman {{frontier}} in Dalmatia during the Cretan War (1645–69). They crossed into Venetian territory {{from which they}} conducted raids into Ottoman-controlled lands.|$|E
5|$|After a first {{interruption}} in development, {{the project}} was redefined as a short interactive demo for Windows-based personal computers. New team members, including professional artists and designers, <b>were</b> <b>recruited</b> for the demo, which would feature ten scenes from Chrono Trigger {{and most of its}} playable characters. In 2004, {{the project was}} publicly closed after Square Enix issued a cease-and-desist letter to Resurrection Games for trademark and copyright infringement. Despite its closure, the project has received critical and popular praise.|$|E
5000|$|New [...] "Area of Recruitment" [...] {{gameplay}} mechanic. In Rome, {{there was}} virtually no restriction on the units a faction could train {{in a given}} province: for example, Carthage could train exactly the same units in their capital city of Carthage as they could in their distant colonies in Spain. The exceptions were that Roman First Cohorts could only <b>be</b> <b>recruited</b> in Rome; Spartan hoplites could only <b>be</b> <b>recruited</b> in Sparta or Syracuse; and elephant and camel units could only <b>be</b> <b>recruited</b> in provinces that have those animals as resources. In RTR, the units that can <b>be</b> <b>recruited</b> in a province depend {{in large part on}} the province itself. Gallic infantry, for instance, can only <b>be</b> <b>recruited</b> in Gaul, but can <b>be</b> <b>recruited</b> there by any faction which controls it. Still, all factions do have their own typical units that can <b>be</b> <b>recruited</b> in any of their territories once the appropriate buildings have been constructed.|$|R
5000|$|Each club <b>is</b> {{permitted}} to <b>recruit</b> {{up to three}} [...] "Category B" [...] rookies. Category B rookies <b>are</b> <b>recruited</b> directly rather than drafted, and represent players from non-traditional recruiting backgrounds. Players who may <b>be</b> <b>recruited</b> as Category B rookies include: ...|$|R
50|$|The {{spirit of}} wind <b>is</b> <b>recruited</b> by paying {{a certain number}} of Rasimov gold coins. However, the final spirit must <b>be</b> <b>recruited</b> in a special way. The spirit's symbol is a feather.|$|R
5|$|After the Anschluss, the Austrian SS was {{folded into}} SS-Oberabschnitt Donau. The third {{regiment}} of the SS-Verfügungstruppe (Der Führer) {{and the fourth}} Totenkopf regiment (Ostmark) <b>were</b> <b>recruited</b> in Austria shortly thereafter. On Heydrich's orders, mass arrests of potential enemies of the Reich began immediately after the Anschluss. Mauthausen was the first concentration camp opened in Austria following the Anschluss. Before {{the invasion of the}} Soviet Union, Mauthausen was the harshest of the camps in the Greater German Reich.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of Julius Caesar in 54BC, regular legionary units were {{supplemented}} by exploratores, a body of scouts, and speculatores, spies who infiltrated enemy camps. Due {{to the demands of}} the civil war, the extraordinary measure of recruiting legions from non-citizens was taken by Caesar in Transalpine Gaul (Latin: Gallia Transalpina), by Brutus in Macedonia, and by Pompey in Pharsalus. This irregular and extraordinary recruitment was not, however, typical of recruitment during this period, and Roman law still officially required that legions <b>were</b> <b>recruited</b> from Roman citizens only.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage for {{equipment}} and positions was extensively developed for military {{use by the}} French in 1915, soon followed by other World War I armies. In both world wars, artists <b>were</b> <b>recruited</b> as camouflage officers. Ship camouflage developed via conspicuous dazzle camouflage schemes during WWI, but since the development of radar, ship camouflage has received less attention. Aircraft, especially in World War II, were often painted with different schemes above and below, to camouflage them against the ground and sky respectively.|$|E
50|$|While a high {{proportion}} of UESTC graduates stay on to do research for a master's degree, about 30% of the graduates <b>are</b> <b>recruited</b> to Pearl River Delta, the fast-growing consumer electronics design and manufacturing centre of China. Similarly, a {{high proportion}} of UESTC Master's graduates stay on to do a PhD, about 12% of the Masters <b>are</b> <b>recruited</b> to Shenzhen alone, and 8.3% <b>are</b> <b>recruited</b> to Shanghai.|$|R
500|$|In {{progressing}} {{through the}} game, the player <b>is</b> able to <b>recruit</b> {{up to eight}} additional characters to travel alongside the protagonist; some recruitments happen automatically, while others only happen depending on the previous actions and options taken by the player. Though only 8 characters can <b>be</b> <b>recruited</b> in a playthrough, ten characters are available to <b>be</b> <b>recruited,</b> {{and as a result}} not all characters can <b>be</b> <b>recruited</b> in one playthrough of the game. Certain characters cannot <b>be</b> <b>recruited</b> unless the players party is a specific size, or the players has made specific story decisions. [...] In First Departure, players have the option of recruiting characters they did not previously have the option of adding to their party.|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of the over 650 foreign instructors employed at ECC <b>are</b> <b>recruited</b> abroad. A large number of these <b>are</b> <b>recruited</b> in Canada, where regular <b>recruiting</b> sessions <b>are</b> held. Periodic <b>recruiting</b> sessions <b>are</b> held in Australia, the US, the UK and more recently in New Zealand.|$|R
5|$|During {{the colonial}} period, in the 19th century, Kanaks <b>were</b> <b>recruited</b> or enslaved, to perform unfree labour {{in places such}} as Australia, California, Canada, Chile and Fiji (with the inter-Asian slave trade to India, Japan, South Africa, and what is now Malaysia). During the 3,000 years that Kanaks lived in the remote islands, they were {{unprepared}} for the arrival of European viruses and bacteria. The Kanaks were uprooted from the land and were employed as forced labour on French plantations, ranches and public works.|$|E
5|$|Early {{attempts}} {{to establish an}} officer candidate school to train an indigenous officer corps from among Haiti's educated upper class failed due to a reluctance among potential candidates to be seen collaborating with the American occupation, and by {{the perception that the}} methods of American military instruction were demeaning. Enlisted gendarmes, meanwhile, <b>were</b> <b>recruited</b> from indigenous Haitians who were paid between $10 and $25 per month.|$|E
5|$|Education was {{prioritized}} {{under the}} Ravalomanana administration (2002–09), {{and is currently}} free and compulsory from ages 6 to 13. The primary schooling cycle is five years, followed by four years at the lower secondary level and three years at the upper secondary level. During Ravalomanana's first term, thousands of new primary schools and additional classrooms were constructed, older buildings were renovated, {{and tens of thousands}} of new primary teachers <b>were</b> <b>recruited</b> and trained. Primary school fees were eliminated and kits containing basic school supplies were distributed to primary students.|$|E
50|$|Another almost {{universal}} feature of coat assembly {{is that the}} adaptors <b>are</b> <b>recruited</b> first, and they then recruit the coats. The exception is COPI, in which the 7 proteins <b>are</b> <b>recruited</b> to the membrane as a heptamer.|$|R
50|$|These agents can be moles (who <b>are</b> <b>recruited</b> {{before they}} get access to secrets), defectors (who <b>are</b> <b>recruited</b> after they get access to secrets and leave their country) or defectors in place (who get access but do not leave).|$|R
50|$|Debuting in Teen Titans vol.3, #35 during One Year Later, Goldilocks <b>is</b> <b>recruited</b> by {{the villain}} Brain and Monsieur Mallah {{to join the}} latest {{incarnation}} of the Brotherhood of Evil. She <b>is</b> <b>recruited</b> {{at the same time}} as Elephant Man.|$|R
5|$|Enlisted sailors {{during this}} time {{included}} many foreign-born men, and native-born Americans were usually social outcasts who had few other employment options or {{they were trying to}} escape punishment for crimes. In 1835, almost 3,000men sailed with merchant ships out of Boston harbor, but only 90men <b>were</b> <b>recruited</b> by the Navy. It was unlawful for black men to serve in the Navy, but the shortage of men was so acute this law was frequently ignored.|$|E
5|$|Following the battalion's establishment, Marlan {{set about}} {{choosing}} {{a cadre of}} senior commissioned and non-commissioned personnel around which to build the battalion. These personnel included the battalion second-in-command, the quartermaster and adjutant, as well as senior enlisted soldiers to undertake administrative and instructional work. These <b>were</b> <b>recruited</b> from several of the existing Queensland-based Militia battalions including the 25th, 42nd and 47th Battalions. One member recruited at the time had served with the 15th Battalion that had been raised {{as part of the}} First Australian Imperial Force, during World War I.|$|E
5|$|From Kilwa Kisiwani, {{the fleet}} {{departed}} to Malindi, which was reached on 2 August. Cabral met with its king, {{with whom he}} established friendly relations and exchanged gifts. Pilots <b>were</b> <b>recruited</b> at Malindi for the last leg to India and the fleet set sail. Land was reached at Anjadip, an island frequented by ships to obtain supplies {{on their way to}} Calicut. Here the ships were beached, recaulked and painted. Final arrangements were put into place for the encounter with the ruler of Calicut.|$|E

5|$|In the 1st century, {{the vast}} {{majority}} of auxiliary common soldiers <b>were</b> <b>recruited</b> from the Roman peregrine (second-class citizens). In the Julio-Claudian era, conscription of peregrini seems to have been practiced alongside voluntary recruitment, probably {{in the form of a}} fixed proportion of men reaching military age in each tribe being drafted. From the Flavian era onwards, the auxilia were an all-volunteer force. Although recruits as young as 14 are recorded, the majority of recruits (66%) were from the 18–23 age group.|$|E
5|$|Milnrow C.C. is a cricket club {{based at}} Ladyhouse in Milnrow, {{and which has}} played in the Central Lancashire Cricket League since its {{foundation}} in 1892. Milnrow C.C. formed in 1857 {{from a group of}} local businessmen who felt the district deserved its own distinct team. Members of the club <b>were</b> <b>recruited</b> and teams were selected to play other clubs in the surrounding townships.|$|E
5|$|Nick Sheppard, {{formerly}} of the Bristol-based band the Cortinas, and Vince White <b>were</b> <b>recruited</b> as the Clash's new guitarists. Howard continued as the drummer. The reconstituted band played its first shows in January 1984 with a batch of new material and launched into the self-financed Out of Control Tour, travelling widely over the winter and into early summer. At a striking miners' benefit show ("Scargill's Christmas Party") in December 1984, they announced that a new album would be released early in the new year.|$|E
50|$|After {{the breakup}} of Pure Rubbish in April 2003, Derek Dunivan and his dad Willie Dunivan both toured the country with New York Dolls guitarist Sylvain Sylvain in July 2003. Derek <b>was</b> <b>recruited</b> on bass and Willie <b>was</b> <b>recruited</b> on {{additional}} vocals.|$|R
