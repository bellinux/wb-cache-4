Mikael Wood of Entertainment Weekly commented that [...] "the top-shelf collaborators don't hurt — see: the grinding 'Whiplash,' co-penned by one Britney Spears." [...] Scott Shetler of PopCrush gave the song four stars out of five, explaining that it [...] "possesses a hook that will send people running for the dance floor", although [...] "Gomez's vocal is pretty flat [...] but then again, this isn't the kind of song to show off any sort of vocal gymnastics." ...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} an attempt to examine some of the microeconomic {{foundations}} of this last view of the link between current accounts and exchange rata. Several authors, especially Kouri and de Macedo (1978), but also more recently Dornbusch (1980), have sought to justify <b>the</b> portfolio approach <b>in</b> terms of finance theory, deriving asset demands from a mean-variance framework and arguing that differences <b>in</b> <b>the</b> portfolios of different countries explain <b>why</b> changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> distribution of wealth affect exchange rates. What I will do in this paper is to argue that, even under seemingly favorable assumptions, these distribution effects nay run the wrong way; that if they run the right way, they will be very weak; and that the incentives for inter-national, portfolio diversification are in any case small, and can be swamped by quite modest transaction costs or other costs to diversification. ...|$|R

It estimates a factor model in which a country’s market returns are determined by global, sectoral, and crosscountry factors (returns in large financial markets) and by country-specific effects. Then it uses a new data set on bilateral linkages between <b>the</b> <b>world’s</b> five largest economies and approximately 40 other markets to decompose the cross-country factor loadings into direct trade flows, competition in third markets, bank lending, and foreign direct investment. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> {{latter half of the}} 1990 s, bilateral trade flows are large and significant determinants of how shocks are transmitted from large economies to other stock and bond markets. Bilateral foreign investment is usually insignificant.

40|$|The {{twentieth century}} began, well after <b>the</b> First <b>World</b> War, {{to focus on}} the rights of minor-ities and their {{linkages}} with general peace and welfare. The record of the League of Nations, however, was not very encouraging. This is perhaps <b>why,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> post-Second <b>World</b> War period, <b>the</b> international community adopted a more cautious approach to minority rights than before. This is manifested <b>in</b> <b>the</b> reluctance to agree on a definition of minorities, and also a clear preference for perceiving minority rights as being inseparable from human rights. The growing body of international legal instruments for the protection of human rights has, nevertheless, a discernible bearing on minority rights. The international covenants on human rights best exemplify this. Further, the monitoring mechanisms of the UN have also contributed to minority rights through progressive interpretations and rulings. Alongside, regional initiatives, as in Europe, have also helped the cause of minority rights {{after the end of the}} Cold War. Shortcomings <b>in</b> <b>the</b> international protection of minority rights are due to the apprehensions of state actors.

Estimates suggest that both cross-country and sectoral factors are important determinants of stock and bond returns, and that the U. S. factor has recently gained importance, while the Japanese and U. K. factors have lost importance. From 1996 - 2000, real and financial linkages became more important determinants of how shocks are transmitted from large economies to other markets. In particular, bilateral trade flows are large and significant determinants of cross-country linkages in both stock and bond markets. Bilateral foreign investment is usually insignificant.

40|$|An {{examination}} {{of some of}} the ontological implications of the quantum theory leads {{to the conclusion that the}} number of so-called “ultimate constituents of matter ” is one. If this single ultimate constituent is called “brahman, ” quantum theory countenances the following claim: by entering into spatial relations with itself, brahman creates both matter and space, for space is the totality of existing spatial relations, while matter is the corresponding (apparent) multitude of formless relata. The psychological processes by which brahman enters into spatial relations with itself and takes on the aspect of a multitude of formless relata, are discussed. Adopting Sri Aurobindo’s view that the creation of <b>the</b> physical <b>world</b> has set <b>the</b> stage for brahman’s adventure of evolution, we are in a position to explain why the laws of contemporary physics have the particular form that they do. (Since the laws of physics merely serve to set the stage, the adventure itself cannot be directed by the same laws.) We are also in a position to understand <b>why,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> quantum <b>world,</b> to be is to be measured. Jean Gebser’s insights into the evolution of human consciousness are outlined, and its implications for contemporary psychology are examined. Attention is drawn to a recent important publication — Irreducible Mind by Kelly et al. — which has the potential to bridge the gulf between current mainstream psychology and such profound insights as those of Gebser and Sri Aurobindo. ...|$|R
