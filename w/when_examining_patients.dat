40|$|We have audited the {{frequency}} and nature of demands made on general practitioners, {{and the rate of}} surgical and anaesthetic complications within the first 7 days after day surgery. Semi-structured questionnaires were posted to the general practitioners of patients who attended the hospital's day care ward for a surgical procedure over a 6 month period. In all, 1798 questionnaires were sent, of which 1533 (85. 3 %) were returned. A total of 247 (16. 7 %) patients consulted their general practitioners after day surgery, the principal reason being pain (113 patients). Patients who underwent incisional intermediate surgery had the highest rate (31. 5 %) of general practitioner consultations. This audit has quantified the workload which day surgery places upon general practitioners. It also demonstrates the importance of categorising the various procedures performed on a day case basis <b>when</b> <b>examining</b> <b>patient</b> outcome. Patients who underwent non-incisional minor surgery consulted their general practitioner less often than those who underwent incisional minor surgery, who in turn consulted their practitioner less often than those who underwent incisional intermediate surgery.

40|$|Different autoantibodies {{are often}} {{measured}} simultaneously; this typically occurs when using indirect immunofluorescence on tissue sections or multiplex detection systems and may generate clinically "unexpected" positivities (i. e., without any {{relation to the}} disease under investigation).

In general, <b>when</b> <b>examining</b> <b>patients</b> with such unexpected findings, it is necessary to take into account that: a) autoantibody positivities are much more frequent than autoimmune diseases; b) the positive predictive value of an autoantibody positivity depends upon the diagnostic accuracy of the test and disease prevalence; c) autoantibodies may be risk factors for autoimmune disease or may also have a pathogenetic role by themselves.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the theoretical {{framework in which}} we construct our terms of reference <b>when</b> <b>examining</b> <b>patients</b> from an integrated Meyerian biopsychosocial perspective. We coin the term neuro-epistemology, defining the frame for scientific inquiry into the nature and status of knowledge in neuro-sciences, drawing on a post-modernist, social constructionist framework. The framework is then applied {{in a review of}} defining what can be co-created with patients, given the inter-subjective nature of knowledge, the self-reflexive relationship between meanings and behaviour in mental illness and the relationship between knowledge and power. The role of mental frameworks, or presuppositions, in guiding ones choice of research methodology, protocol, experimental tools and hypotheses is explored. The analysis points to the closed nature of the scientific domain in mental health, and the exploration of consciousness and emotions. These principles are applied to the field of neuro-science, including the assumptive framework upon which the dominant discourse in this field is based, which ultimately serves to maintain the hegemony of that status quo. Case examples are used to demonstrate how the application of an integrated approach to mental health draws on an informed, co-created neuro-epistemology. ABSTRA...|$|E
40|$|The {{immunosuppressive}} {{activity of}} mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) is well documented. However, the therapeutic benefit is completely unpredictable, thus raising concerns about MSC efficacy. One of the affecting factors is the unresolved conundrum that, despite being immunosuppressive, MSCs are undetectable after administration. Therefore, understanding {{the fate of}} infused MSCs could help predict clinical responses. Using a murine model of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), we demonstrate that MSCs are actively induced to undergo perforin-dependent apoptosis by recipient cytotoxic cells and that this process is essential to initiate MSC-induced immunosuppression. <b>When</b> <b>examining</b> <b>patients</b> with GvHD who received MSCs, we found a striking parallel, whereby only those with high cytotoxic activity against MSCs responded to MSC infusion, whereas those with low activity did not. The need for recipient cytotoxic cell activity could {{be replaced by the}} infusion of apoptotic MSCs generated ex vivo. After infusion, recipient phagocytes engulf apoptotic MSCs and produce indoleamine 2, 3 -dioxygenase, which is ultimately necessary for effecting immunosuppression. Therefore, we propose the innovative concept that patients should be stratified for MSC treatment according to their ability to kill MSCs or that all patients could be treated with ex vivo apoptotic MSCs. </p...|$|E
40|$|Paragonimiasis is a {{parasitic}} disease caused by Paragonimus trematodes, {{commonly known as}} lung flukes. Humans become infected by eating raw or undercooked crayfish (also known as crawfish and crawdads) or freshwater crabs that harbor the parasites. Paragonimiasis most frequently involves the lungs, but can affect other organs, including the brain and skin. In North America, Paragonimus kellicotti causes infections among dogs, cats, and wild carnivores, but rarely infects humans (1). Paragonimiasis is not a nationally notifiable condition. In September 2009, physicians from the Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM) in St. Louis published details of three paragonimiasis cases diagnosed since July 2006 in persons who had eaten raw crayfish from rivers in Missouri (2), prompting the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services (MDHSS), CDC, and WUSM to collaborate in paragonimiasis surveillance and prevention. During September 2009 –September 2010, six additional cases were diagnosed in Missouri. These nine patients, aged 10 − 32 years, had fever, cough, pleural effusion, and eosinophilia.

40|$|Objectives The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} how musculoskeletal physiotherapists in acute National Health Service (NHS) hospitals manage patients following a first time patellar dislocation. Design National survey study. Setting All NHS acute hospitals with an accident and emergency and/or an orthopaedic department were surveyed. Participants 306 institutions were surveyed. Interventions Each institution was sent a 14 question self-administered questionnaire pertaining to the assessment, treatment, evaluation and outcome of patients following a first time patellar dislocation. After 3 weeks, all non-respondents were sent a reminder letter. After a further 3 weeks, those who had not responded by this time were sent a final reminder and copy of the questionnaire. Results The survey response rate was 59 %. The respondents indicated that first-time patellar dislocation was not a common musculoskeletal disorder managed by NHS physiotherapists, constituting an average of 2 % of caseloads. The results suggested that physiotherapists most commonly assess for reduced quadriceps or VMO capacity, gait, patellar tracking and glide, and knee effusion <b>when</b> <b>examining</b> <b>patients</b> following a first-time patellar dislocation. The most common treatments adopted are reassurance, behaviour modification followed by proprioceptive, knee mobility, quadriceps and specific VMO exercises.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess the various methods of cross {{infection control}} adopted by medical and dental practitioners in Benin City. Method: A structured self–administered questionnaire was administered to a randomly selected group of medical and dental practitioners in order to assess their cross infection control methods, attitude to sterilization of equipment and immunization against hepatitis B virus. Result: Of the 113 practitioners surveyed, 98. 1 % of them sterilised their equipments. The various methods used were autoclaving 46 %, a combination of autoclaving and cold sterilisation 25. 7 % and other methods 25 %. Practitioners who wash their hands before and after examining patients constituted 72. 6 % and 94. 7 % respectively. Those who screened blood before transfusing were 79. 5 % while 4. 5 % and 19. 5 % reused needles and syringes respectively. Although 77. 9 % of respondents suffered needle stick injury, only 10. 6 % were immunised against hepatitis B virus.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} knowledge and competence in temporomandibular disorders (TMD) among dentists and dental hygienists working in the public dental service (PDS) in Sweden. Materials and methods: The study population comprised all general dentists (n = 110) and dental hygienists (n = 80) working in the PDS in two Swedish counties: Kronoberg (K) and Blekinge (B). The participants filled out a questionnaire comprised of 15 questions. Results: The results of these questions are presented. The overall response rate for the general dentists was 87 %, while the rate for the dental hygienists was 71 %. Statistically significant differences between the general dentists in the two counties were found regarding the following: education in the field of TMD over the last 5 years (K: 37 %, B: 73 %), evaluation of occlusion <b>when</b> <b>examining</b> <b>patients</b> with suspected TMD ('always': K: 61 %, B: 82 %), and a desire for consultation of the OFP (orofacial pain) /TMD specialist by telephone (K: 71 %, B: 44 %). Regarding the dental hygienists, there was a statistically significant difference concerning the use of the treatment modality 'reassurance' (K: 41 %, B: 7 %). Conclusions: The majority of the dental care providers in both counties - irrespective of professional category - had a positive attitude towards patients with TMD. Knowledge and competence in the field are sparse and require postgraduate education. There is a great need of an OFP/TMD specialist for more complicated patients and a need to implement updated knowledge and competence in the PDS in these two counties...|$|E
40|$|Summary. In his Epitome des préceptes de médecine et chirurgie, the French surgeon Pierre Pigray (c. 1532 – 1613) instructs {{his colleagues}} on the types of cases they may encounter, and advises them on {{appropriate}} conduct not only <b>when</b> <b>examining</b> their <b>patients,</b> but also when asked to provide medical evidence {{in a court of}} law. Pigray’s case studies include: a man who thought a witch had caused his impotence, a group of accused witches, and a young girl purportedly possessed by the devil. His anal-ysis of these cases and personal reflections reveal a characteristically early modern perspective. Pigray, like many of his colleagues, tended towards scepticism with respect to popular beliefs, but also func-tioned within a medical and legal framework that accepted the reality of a magical worldview.
