In this paper, the design of all the three types of windows is carried out in the X-band frequency. The design of the single block window has been carried out with inductive, capacitive and resonant type of irises to find their suitability for window applications.

40|$|The <b>waveguide</b> <b>windows</b> in the PEP-II RF {{coupling}} network have to withstand high power of 500 kW. Traveling wave windows have lower power dissipation than conventional self-matched windows, thus rendering {{the possibility of}} less stringent mechanical design. The traveling wave behavior is achieved by providing a reflecting iris {{on each side of}} the window, and depending on the configuration of the irises, traveling wave windows are characterized as inductive or capacitive types. A numerical design procedure using MAFIA has been developed for traveling wave windows. The relative advantages of inductive and capacitive windows are discussed. Furthermore, the issues of bandwidth and multipactoring are also addressed...|$|R

40|$|A recirculating, energy-recovering linac {{is used as}} driver {{accelerator}} for Jefferson Lab‚Äôs high {{average power}} FEL. CW beam of 5 mA design current is transported from the superconducting RF (SRF) linac to the wiggler for lasing, and then recirculated back to the linac for deceleration and energy recovery. About 75 % of the beam power is extracted before the beam is transported to the beam dump. Energy recovery reduces power consumption, RF equipment capital costs, and beam dump shielding requirements. It is arguably essential as FEL technology is scaled to higher average power levels. To date, 4 mA of CW beam has been energy recovered successfully. There {{is no evidence of}} RF instabilities due to the energy aperture of the transport system, momentum compaction or the phase of the decelerating beam. HOM power from the beam has interfered with the operation of the IR interlock detectors, designed to protect the warm <b>waveguide</b> <b>window</b> from thermal runaway. Installation of copper screens appears to have solved the problem. More detailed studies of the HOM spectra and their correlation to the beam properties are planned. ...|$|E

The waveguides with Neumann boundary condition were also investigated in several papers (e. g. [7], [8]). The possible next generalization are waveguides with combined Dirichlet and Neumann {{boundary conditions}} on dierent parts of the boundary. Some very simple combinations of these conditions appear due to the symmetry of special con gurations in systems studied e. g. in [4], [5] and [8].

40|$|We {{describe}} the low power and high power performance of planar waveguide windows designed and fabricated by Thomson Tubes and tested at LNS. These windows {{are intended for}} use in the phase III upgrade of CESR. INTRODUCTION In the recent CESR beam test of the SRF cavity we used a planar <b>waveguide</b> <b>window</b> designed and built by Premier Microwave, shown in Fig. 1. As reported in [1], this window was tested off-line at 500 MHz with 250 kW traveling wave power and 125 kW reflected power. The conditioning time to reach 250 kW was about 200 hours, with vacuum bursts as the most frequent trip event. When the SRF cavity was installed in CESR[2], the maximum beam power supplied to a 120 mA beam through the window and SRF cavity was 155 kW, again limited by vacuum bursts during window conditioning in the presence of beam and with the cavity on resonance. For the phase III upgrade of CESR, we need to supply 325 kW to the beam. We plan to continue high power off-line tests on the Premier window. F [...] ...|$|E

40|$|The NASA Deep Space Network (DSN) uses {{commercial}} waveguide {{windows on}} the output waveguide of Ka-band (32 GHz) low-noise amplifiers. Mechanical failure of these windows resulted in an unacceptable loss in tracking time. To address this issue, a new Ka-band WR- 28 <b>waveguide</b> <b>window</b> has been designed, fabricated, and tested. The window uses a slab of low-loss, low-dielectric constant foam that is bonded into a 1 / 2 -wave-thick waveguide/flange. The foam is a commercially available, rigid, closed-cell polymethacrylimide. It has excellent electrical properties with a dielectric constant of 1. 04, and a loss tangent of 0. 01. It is relatively strong with a tensile strength of 1 MPa. The material is virtually impermeable to helium. The finished window exhibits a leak rate of less than 3 x 10 (exp - 3) cu cm/s with helium. The material is also chemically resistant and can be cleaned with acetone. The window is constructed by fabricating a window body by brazing a short length of WR- 28 copper waveguide into a standard rectangular flange, and machining the resulting part to a thickness of 4. 6 mm. The foam is machined to a rectangular shape with a dimension of 7. 06 x 3. 53 mm. The foam is bonded into the body with a two-part epoxy. After curing, the excess glue and foam are knife-trimmed by hand. The finished window has a loss of less than 0. 08 dB (2 %) and a return loss of greater than 25 dB at 32 GHz. This meets the requirements for the DSN application. The window is usable for most applications over the entire 26 -to- 40 -GHz waveguide band. The window return loss can be tuned to a required frequency by var y in g {{the thickness of the}} window slightly. Most standard waveguide windows use a thin membrane of material bonded into a recess in a waveguide flange, or sandwiched between two flanges with a polymer seal. Designs using the recessed window are prone to mechanical failure over time due to constraints on the dimensions of the recess that allow the bond to fail. Designs using the sandwich method are often permeable to helium, which prohibits the use of helium leak detection. At the time of this reporting, 40 windows have been produced.

40|$|In {{accordance}} {{with the goals of}} this ITER Task experimental and theoretical investigations on 1 MW, 170 GHz, CVD-diamond gyrotron and torus windows for continuous wave (CW) operation have been continued. Two gyrotron window units were tested in collaboration with the Russian Hometeam. Unfortunately, both window disks cracked after operation at mm-wave power levels around 1 MW and pulse lengths up to 1. 5 s. The reasons are only known for the second unit where a sag of the window disk (120 - 140 #mu#m), introduced by its brazing, led to a static stress of approximately 0. 7 - 0. 8 MPa. A third CVD-diamond disk unit does not show any sag. The high power tests are scheduled for January 2002. A CVD-diamond window disk was irradiated with a neutron fluence of almost 10 " 2 " 1 n/m" 2 and then brazed to two Inconel <b>waveguide</b> cuffs. The <b>window</b> unit has been mounted into a test housing in an evacuated corrugated HE_ 1 _ 1 waveguide (I. D. 63. 5 mm) and successfully tested in collaboration with the Japanese Hometeam at mm-wave power levels of 0. 58 MW (0. 2 MW) and pulse length 15 s (132 s). The temperature rises of the disk at a diameter of 65 mm and at the disk water cooling rim were 27 C and 2 C, respectively. Simulation calculations show agreement with the measured temperature rise curves for tan#delta# = 4. 8. 10 "-" 5 and k = 1200 W/mK which reveals that the reduction of the thermal conductivity by a factor of 2 after neutron irradiation was partially removed during the brazing at temperatures above 600 C.
