5|$|Blood {{was viewed}} as a potent source of {{nourishment}} for the Maya deities, and the sacrifice of a living creature was a powerful blood offering.

5|$|Conclusions on dietary {{components}} have {{at times}} {{been difficult to}} ascertain as results have differed between population-based studies and randomised controlled trials. There is limited evidence that light to moderate use of alcohol, particularly red wine, is associated <b>with</b> <b>lower</b> risk of AD. There is tentative evidence that caffeine may be protective. A number of foods high in flavonoids such as cocoa, red wine, and tea may decrease the risk of AD.|$|E

5|$|In total, {{electrical}} plant {{construction and}} well drilling cost about €2–5million perMW of electrical capacity, while the break–even price is 0.04–0.10€ perkW·h. Enhanced geothermal systems {{tend to be}} on the high side of these ranges, with capital costs above $4million perMW and break–even above $0.054 perkW·h in 2007. Direct heating applications can use much shallower wells <b>with</b> <b>lower</b> temperatures, so smaller systems <b>with</b> <b>lower</b> costs and risks are feasible. Residential geothermal heat pumps with a capacity of 10kilowatt (kW) are routinely installed for around $1–3,000 perkilowatt. District heating systems may benefit from economies of scale if demand is geographically dense, as in cities and greenhouses, but otherwise piping installation dominates capital costs. The capital cost of one such district heating system in Bavaria was estimated at somewhat over 1million€ perMW. Direct systems of any size are much simpler than electric generators and have lower maintenance costs perkW·h, but they must consume electricity to run pumps and compressors. Some governments subsidize geothermal projects.|$|E

5|$|Resistivity is {{a measure}} of how {{strongly}} a material opposes the flow of electric current.

This trend continues down to 100K, below which resistivity rapidly decreases for fresh samples. Resistivity then begins to increase with time at around 20K due to radiation damage, with the rate dictated by the isotopic composition of the sample.|$|E
