All the rest that comes about in the outward manifestation of the {{physical}} world (including all the fluctuations which end up as thoughts and actions) is just clutter. The true nature of each soul is pure consciousness. So the song is really about transcending and {{about the quality of the}} transcendent.|$|E
5|$|I {{realized}} the point I {{was trying to}} push with these two programmed robots was the desire for them to try {{and figure out what}} the point of living was... It took these really irrational acts of love to sort of discover them against how they were built... I realized that that's a perfect metaphor for real life. We all fall into our habits, our routines and our ruts, consciously or unconsciously to avoid living. To avoid having to do the messy part. To avoid having relationships with other people or dealing with the person next to us. That's why we can all get on our cell phones and not have to deal with one another. I thought, 'That's a perfect amplification of the <b>whole</b> <b>point</b> of the movie.' I wanted to run with science {{in a way that would}} sort of logically project that.|$|E

Searle claims that from his vantage point within the room there is nothing he can see that could imaginably give rise to consciousness, other than himself, and clearly {{he does not have}} a mind that can speak Chinese.|$|E
25|$|Lord Peterborough {{was short}} in stature and spare in habit of body. His {{activity}} knew no bounds. He {{was said to}} have seen more kings and postilions than any man in Europe, and the <b>whole</b> <b>point</b> of Jonathan Swift's lines on Mordanto consisted in a description of the speed with which he hastened from capital to capital. He was eloquent in debate and intrepid in war, but his influence in the senate was ruined through his inconsistency, and his vigour in the field was wasted through his want of union with his colleagues.|$|E

25|$|Esperanto has not {{fragmented}} into regional dialects through {{natural language}} use. This {{may be because}} it is the language of daily communication for only a small minority of its speakers. However at least three other factors work against dialects, namely the centripetal force of the Fundamento, the unifying influence of the Plena Vortaro and its successors, which exemplified usage from the works of Zamenhof and leading writers, and the transnational ambitions of the speech community itself. Slang and jargon have developed to some extent, but such features interfere with universal communication – the <b>whole</b> <b>point</b> of Esperanto – and so have generally been avoided.|$|E

And so whatever shame, pain or difficulty or discomfort I went through, then it was worth it because I get so many people coming up to me saying their kids had read it and got their act together because of it.” Kiedis has stated that due to the subject matter in his book, especially his reflections on his sexual relationships, that he hopes that his family hasn't read his book. “I have asked everyone in my family not to read the book.” Kiedis said.|$|E

Firstly, an original triangle is built. Then this direct triangulation method is executed according to slick rule, angle of two normal vectors maximized rule, threshold distance rule and internal minimal angle maximized rule. When points are distributed asymmetrically, this method connects sparse region and dense region by Delaunay circumsphere rule.

The Encyclopédie denied that the teachings of the Catholic Church could be treated as authoritative in matters of science.

Some articles talked about changing social and political institutions that would improve their society for everyone.
