Newer techniques have offered novel opportunities to actually see the suspected etiological markers of certain genetic diseases, such as Fragile X syndrome. The visualization of these markers has both clarified and confused previously observed inheritance patterns, in some cases leading to the development of newly distinct diagnostic categories.

40|$|In a heteronormative {{society where}} hegemonic masculinity prevails, beauty is often synonymous with, and {{presented}} as, feminine. For example, pictures of tall, thin women with perfect teeth and perfect skin gloss {{the covers of}} magazines {{and other forms of}} media as representative of some beauty ideal. This “ideal” is the barometer by which, on many levels, all women are judged. While some women may choose to ignore these messages, few women can always escape comparison. Our society constantly informs us that appearance matters. More specifically for women, a feminine physical appearance is often considered “ideal. ” But <b>what</b> exactly <b>does</b> this construct, feminine, signify? Fundamentally, femininity is not static. To speak of it as a logical, simple construct is problematic for it means different things and is expressed in different ways in different environments. Furthermore, to assert one definition by which all others will be measured is difficult in that it presumes a homogenous population and/or idealizes one specific representation. In this research project I conducted in-depth interviews with 43 non-heterosexual women to discern how they constructed “femininity. ” <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>look</b> like? <b>What</b> meanings <b>did</b> <b>it</b> connote? When was it important and how was it negotiated? Applying a cognitive sociological lens and using grounded theory methods, I describe what femininity, or arguably femininities, look(s) like within this subpopulation. This project contributes to and extends the literature on gender, sexuality, and appearance. <b>It</b> <b>does</b> this by demonstrating the importance of analyzing non-heterosexual women’s experiences and understandings of femininity within a patriarchal society that valorizes hegemonic masculinity. Most literature contemplating appearance and related misogynistic messages emphasizes a heteronormative perspective. However, feminine and femininity uniquely impact non-heteronormative women. Non-heterosexual women must negotiate both misogynistic and heterosexist messages concurrently. By simultaneously addressing this “double” subordination or marginalization, this research endeavors to provide a more comprehensive overview of meanings and ramifications of appearance choices...|$|R

The entry of viruses such as HIV- 1, and its closely related simian counterpart simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), is mediated by the interaction of glycoprotein spikes on the viral membrane surface with receptors on the target cell membrane.

I argue that introducing mathematics in a comprehensive way also requires re-organizing the daily work of scientists in the field. Numerical taxonomists sought to establish a mathematical method for classification that was universal to every type of organism, and I argue this intrinsically implicated them in a qualitative re-organization of the work of all systematists. I also discuss how Numerical Taxonomy’s re-organization of practice became entrenched across systematic biology even as opposing schools produced their own competing mathematical methods. In this way, the structure of the work process became more fundamental than the methodological theories that motivated it...|$|E

Though gender research and computing science seem like two separate worlds, this book proves how inspirational a confrontation and combination of those worlds can be. A deconstructive analysis of advanced fields of computing shows the multiple ways in which software design is gendered and how gendering effects are produced by its use. Concepts and assumptions underlying research and development, along with design tools and IT products, teaching methods and materials are studied. The book not only offers a gender analysis of information society technologies, it also shows practical examples of how IT can be different. A gender perspective on IT design can serve as an eye-opener for what tends to be overlooked and left out. It yields innovative ideas and high quality software systems that may empower a large diversity of users for an active participation in our information society...|$|R
40|$|The sixties were a time {{of social}} movements, public debates and {{changing}} perspectives. It was the time that in the Rijksmuseum voor Volkenkunde new ideas about its collecting practice came up. But only {{little is known about}} the collecting practice and collections policy of the Rijksmuseum voor Volkenkunde in the 1960 ’s. This Master thesis was written to find out what these looked like. Research questions were: was there a collections policy in the sixties in the Rijksmuseum voor Volkenkunde? <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>look</b> like? And is this collections policy reflected in the actual acquisitions, especially from Middle- and South-America? Three methods were used for collecting data: the jaarverslagen (annual reports), correspondence between the museum and the collectors and TMS (The Museum System, the museum’s collections database). A database was set up to combine information from TMS with that of the jaarverslagen. This database showed the total amount of objects given to and collected for and by the museum per year. The jaarverslagen, written by director Pott, proved to useful in understanding the difficulties in forming a new collections policy. The jaarverslagen also show the need to collect but this was not always possible due to financial problems. The correspondence between the museum and the collectors gave a good insight in the collecting practice. It can be concluded that there was no actual collections policy present in the sixties. The collecting practice very much depended on personal preferences of the director and the curators. However, there were some common ideas about collecting in the museum. One of them was that objects from ‘unknown’ cultures should be collected but in a way that visitors could identify with them. This can be clearly seen in the Borys Malkin and Luis Laffer collections. Also the idea of ‘saving’ parts of cultures before they disappeared is part of these common ideas. Malkin was one of the collectors that worked with this so-called ‘salvage anthropology’. Pott’s ideas about the collections policy are not very different from the collecting practice. His ideas are clearly visible in the collecting practice and this can lead to the conclusion that Pott was well aware of the difficulties and possibilities of the collecting practice...|$|R
