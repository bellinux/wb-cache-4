5|$|Filming was {{supposed}} to start on 26 November 2011, but the first schedule began in January 2012, and lasted for 35 days. At Linking Road in Bandra, Mumbai, Vijay acted and operated the camera himself for one scene with cinematographer Santosh Sivan's assistance, {{which had to be}} filmed quickly with the unaware public. Sivan commented that it was shot perfectly and decided to retain it in the film. Sivan further told that {{a major part of the}} film was being shot in real locations <b>with</b> <b>hidden</b> cameras. He shot Thuppakki with an Arri Alexa camera, as opposed to traditional 35 mm film.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1916 he was {{transferred}} as first lieutenant to a Q-ship under Gordon Campbell. A Q-ship was a merchant ship <b>with</b> <b>hidden</b> weaponry, commanded secretly by the navy and manned by a Royal Navy crew. When attacked by a submarine, the Q-ship would feign damage until the enemy {{was close enough to}} engage and then reveal its weapons to counter-attack. Campbell, a major proponent of Q-ship strategy, was impressed with Stuart's stubborn refusal to accept the two years of rejection and brought him in to replace an officer whose nerves had cracked under the strain of Q-ship operations.|$|E

The igloo, a shelter built from blocks of ice in a spiral, {{was used by the}} Inuit people. The wigwam was made by Native Americans and covered <b>with</b> <b>hides</b> or bark.|$|R

5|$|In 2009, Scott {{left her}} former record label Hidden Beach Recordings. During the album's recording, she was sued by Hidden Beach, which claimed {{she had left}} without {{fulfilling}} a six-album contract. The lawsuit was settled in 2011, <b>with</b> <b>Hidden</b> Beach planning to release in August a compilation album The Original Jill Scott from the Vault, Vol. 1, {{the first in a}} planned album series of Scott's previously unreleased recordings.

5|$|In {{the midst}} of this feud, Germanicus became ill and despite the fact Piso had removed himself to the port of Seleucia, he was {{convinced}} that Piso was somehow poisoning him. Tacitus reports that there were signs of black magic in Piso's house <b>with</b> <b>hidden</b> body parts and Germanicus' name inscribed on lead tablets. Germanicus sent Piso a letter formally renouncing their friendship (amicitia). Germanicus died soon after on 10 October of that year. His death aroused much speculation, with several sources blaming Piso, acting under orders from Emperor Tiberius. This was never proven, and Piso later died while facing trial. Tiberius feared the people of Rome knew of the conspiracy against Germanicus, but Tiberius' jealousy and fear of his nephew's popularity and increasing power was the true motive as understood by Tacitus.|$|E

5|$|Johansson {{was cast}} {{in the role of}} an alien who preys on men in Scotland in Jonathan Glazer's science fiction movie Under the Skin (2013). The film, an {{adaptation}} of Michel Faber's novel of the same name, took nine years to complete. For the role, she learned to drive a van and speak with an English accent. Johansson improvised her conversations with non-professional actors on the street, who were unknowingly participating in the film; these scenes were filmed <b>with</b> <b>hidden</b> cameras. It was released to generally positive reviews, with particular praise for Johansson. Erin Whitney, writing for HuffPost, considered it her best performance to date, while taking note of her first fully nude role. It earned Johansson a BIFA Award for Best Performance by an Actress in a British Independent Film nomination.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Shackleton {{returned}} to New Zealand from the Ross Sea, having {{picked up the}} survivors of the winter party, Worsley travelled to England aboard the RMS Makura. As an RNR officer, he wanted to join in the fight against Imperial Germany. After arriving in Liverpool, {{he made his way to}} London and was quickly assigned to HMS Pembroke, the shore station at Chatham. Here, for three months, he learned about fighting U-boats, which were causing considerable damage to supply convoys crossing the Atlantic. Several tactics were deployed against the U-boats. One of these involved the use of Q-ships, small merchant vessels fitted out <b>with</b> <b>hidden</b> armament that could be deployed against any U-boats which surfaced and approached the seemingly unarmed ship. Another tactic was the use of P-boats, which were patrol boats that carried out convoy escort duties and anti-submarine work. The P-boats had a distinctive profile, and their effectiveness wore off as U-boat commanders began to recognise and avoid them. The later built P-boats were designed with a more conventional profile approximating that of a merchant ship, and thus were similar to Q-ships.|$|E
5|$|The German navy put little {{emphasis}} on camouflage. After the Battle of Jutland, German naval effort {{in any case}} went into submarine warfare. However, Germany made use of disguise, such as by painting ships in the colour schemes of British or neutral shipping. For example, the Kronprinzessin Cecilie was painted to resemble the British liner Olympic, and managed to reach America, evading the British blockade in 1914. In 1915 and 1916, the Germans further made use of commerce raiders, converted freighters <b>with</b> <b>hidden</b> weapons and long range, able to slip through the British blockade and then attack shipping {{as far away as}} the south Atlantic. German First World War merchant ships were rarely camouflaged, nor did they use Q-ships, as the Allied navies did not attack merchant shipping.|$|E
