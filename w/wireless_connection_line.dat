40|$|From a {{technical}} and commercial {{point of view}} it is found that electronic sensing technologies have emerged significant progresses over the last few decades. The potentiality of reproducing human senses by sensor arrays and pattern recognition systems is termed as electronic sensing. E-Nose provides an industry-specific management resolution for the perpetual and real-time monitoring of environmental odor and air quality resulting in higher profit and improved community relations. The device constitutes arrays of effective and rapid acting chemical sensors, supplemented by patented electronics and software. Chemicals in the air are identified by the sensor arrays, registering complex odor images in real time. By means of <b>wireless</b> <b>connection</b> or <b>lines</b> a permanent record is sent to the computer, where it is detected, computed and alarms for inconsistent events were sent or else it can be indicated by some displacement. Electronic nose instruments are exploited by research and development laboratories, quality control laboratories, process & production department’s of environmental protection, all these are done for the detection of volatile organic compounds in air, water and soil samples, and the measurement and comparison of the effects of manufacturing process on products are also determined. In this paper, An E-Nose is proposed to identify the gas component. For this process, the soft computing technique called Genetic algorithm is used. This provides an optimized weight to identify the gas component by means of the input concentration range and SMAC/hr (units in ppm). The intended Technique is evaluated with different training samples and results are produced...|$|R

40|$|Wireless Internet service shows {{great promise}} in {{allowing}} users to have nation-wide, ubiquitous Internet access. Two varieties of service are forming. In one variety, a user is given free wireless access either as advertising or {{as a public}} service. In another, the user pays for wireless access from a com-mercial provider, must like a wired ISP. However, {{the very nature of}} wireless creates some additional technical problems which wired connections do not have to consider. Because <b>wireless</b> <b>connections</b> use collision avoidance rather than collision detection, <b>wireless</b> <b>connections</b> have additional overhead. In addition, because <b>wireless</b> <b>connections</b> use RF signals rather than hard-to-tap wire, they are vulnerable to eavesdropping. Also, <b>wireless</b> <b>connections</b> are susceptible to freeloading if proper authentication is not implemented. The current security protocol,WEP, is fatally flawed due to improper imple-mentation and use of a weak key. Before commercial services can mature, these problems with authentication and security must be satisfactorily dealt with. 2...|$|R

30|$|Pande et al. also {{analyzed}} hybrid NoC architectures [21]. The simulated networks had 128, 256, and 512 cores, {{and for all}} of {{them the}} number of cores in each sub-network was set to be 16, and only the number of sub-networks varied. Sub-network cores were connected in a mesh topology using wires. Wired and <b>wireless</b> <b>connections</b> were used to connect sub-networks. The number of <b>wireless</b> <b>connections</b> varied between 1, 6, and 24. Initially, the wireless links were randomly distributed and the distributions that obtained the best results were later determined. The conclusion was that inserting long-ranged <b>wireless</b> <b>connections</b> in a NoC significantly improves its performance. Additionally, the performance gains are more significant as the system grows in size.|$|R

30|$|A network {{split into}} sub-networks and {{interconnected}} using wired and <b>wireless</b> <b>connections</b> is also shown by Ganguly et al. [14]. The proposal consists of sub-networks using mesh topology {{in which the}} cores are connected {{to each other and}} to a central hub by wires. In the second level of the network, all of the sub-networks are also connected by wires in a ring topology. Initially, the available <b>wireless</b> <b>connections</b> are probabilistically distributed among pairs of hubs, based on the distance between them, measured in number of hops. After network start-up, the simulated annealing heuristic is used to reassign <b>wireless</b> <b>connections</b> for performance optimization. Tests were conducted with 128, 256, and 512 simulated cores, varying the number of sub-networks and the number of cores per sub-network. Results showed that the proposed network achieved better transfer rates and lower energy dissipation and delay.|$|R
