5|$|This {{emphasis}} on improvisation was essential due traditional {{role of the}} music as entertainment for the entire community. Listeners in the audience expected players to surprise and astound them by playing in their own unique style, and by incorporating improvisation to make newer versions of the piece. If a player simply imitated a preceding player, playing patterns without any improvisation, the audience members <b>would</b> <b>believe</b> she/he to be repetitious and mundane. This also explains why set performance pieces for musical productions are different in some respect—young men/women would be practicing before an event, therefore rarely relying on improvisations.|$|E

25|$|Amyraldism (or {{sometimes}} Amyraldianism, {{also known}} as the School of Saumur, hypothetical universalism, post redemptionism, moderate Calvinism, or four-point Calvinism) is the belief that God, prior to his decree of election, decreed Christ's atonement for all alike if they believe, but seeing that none <b>would</b> <b>believe</b> on their own, he then elected those whom he will bring to faith in Christ, thereby preserving the Calvinist doctrine of unconditional election. The efficacy of the atonement remains limited to those who believe.|$|E
25|$|The {{doctrine}} of limited atonement is often argued from the theological argument of double jeopardy. In the limited view, Jesus Christ {{has taken the}} penalty of the elect - that Jesus died for those who <b>would</b> <b>believe,</b> so that those for whom Christ died must be saved and cannot be damned {{as it would be}} unjust for God to punish the same sins twice (double jeopardy). If Jesus died for all, they argue, then all must be saved. The penal theory of the atonement is therefore the basis of the necessity for a limited atonement.|$|E
25|$|Diogenes Laërtius {{records the}} legend that Empedocles died by {{throwing}} himself into Mount Etna in Sicily, {{so that the}} people <b>would</b> <b>believe</b> his body had vanished and he had turned into an immortal god; the volcano, however, threw back one of his bronze sandals, revealing the deceit. Another legend maintains that he threw himself into the volcano to prove to his disciples that he was immortal; he believed {{he would come back}} as a god after being consumed by the fire. Horace also refers the death of Empedocles in his work Ars Poetica and admits poets the right to destroy themselves.|$|E

25|$|The test {{described}} here is more fully the null-hypothesis statistical significance test. The null hypothesis represents what we <b>would</b> <b>believe</b> by default, before seeing any evidence. Statistical significance {{is a possible}} finding of the test, declared when the observed sample is unlikely to have occurred by chance if the null hypothesis were true. The name of the test describes its formulation and its possible outcome. One characteristic of the test is its crisp decision: to reject or not reject the null hypothesis. A calculated value is compared to a threshold, which is determined from the tolerable risk of error.|$|E
25|$|Short miles are {{on average}} about ten {{percent less than}} actual miles {{but in some cases}} the {{difference}} can be as large as 50 percent. An extreme (but not unheard of) example would be a load that picked up in Brownsville, Texas, and delivered in Miami, Florida. This journey would require the driver to travel over 1600 miles. The short routing however <b>would</b> <b>believe</b> the distance to be only 750, as though the truck could drive across the Gulf of Mexico. Another extreme example would be a load that picked up in Buffalo New York and delivered in Green Bay Wisconsin, not giving any consideration that three of America's Great Lakes lie between that load's origin and destination.|$|E

In the fourth edition of her memoirs, written in 1941, Lúcia said that {{on the occasion of}} their third visit to the Cova da Iria, on 13 July 1917, she asked the Lady to tell them who she was, and to perform a miracle so that everyone <b>would</b> <b>believe.</b> The Lady told her that they should continue to come to the Cova each month until October, when the requested miracle would occur.|$|E

From the Kentish coast he took boat for Rotterdam, in a lay habit with 'scarlet cloake' and 'gold hat band'. In Holland he consorted with Roman Catholics as well as Protestants. On his return to Cambridge he met the rumour of his having been beyond the seas with a wonder 'at their silliness, that they <b>would</b> <b>believe</b> so unlikely a relation'. After all he had been outwitted, for Williams, the lord keeper, suspecting some puritan plot, had set a spy on his movements, who sent weekly intelligence of his doings.|$|E
25|$|The character's {{conception}} {{was a part}} of one of {{the most}} notable storylines in EastEnders during 1989, a love triangle between Cindy Williams (played by Michelle Collins), Simon Wicks (played by Nick Berry) and Ian Beale (played by Adam Woodyatt). Steven was the result of a one-night stand (in the bar of The Queen Victoria public house) between Cindy and Simon, occurring while Cindy was engaged to Ian Beale in May 1989. Viewers knew that Cindy was carrying Simon's child; however, between characters in the serial, Steven’s true paternity was kept secret, with only Cindy, Simon, and later Simon’s mother Pat Butcher (Pam St. Clement) knowing the truth, though neither Simon or Pat <b>would</b> <b>believe</b> Cindy’s claim initially. Simon’s rejection of Cindy and her unborn child facilitated a plot twist that saw Cindy pretend that the child was Ian’s.|$|E
25|$|Dystheistic {{speculation}} {{arises from}} {{consideration of the}} problem of evil — the question of why God, who is supposedly omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent, would allow evil to exist in the world. Koons notes that this is only a theological problem for a eutheist, since a dystheist would not find the existence of evil (or God's authorship of it) to be an obstacle to theistic belief. In fact, the dystheistic option would be a consistent non-contradictory response to the problem of evil. Thus Koons concludes that the problem of theodicy (explaining how God can be good despite the apparent contradiction presented in the problem of evil) does not pose a challenge to all possible forms of theism (i.e., that the problem of evil does not present a contradiction to someone who <b>would</b> <b>believe</b> that God exists but that he is not necessarily good).|$|E

25|$|I {{was saved}} {{from the gas}} chambers, saved from Hitler. I spent several years in Nazi death camps. Besides {{the fact that they}} murdered my wife and 11 children, my mother, my sisters and my brother – of my whole family, some 150 people, I {{was the only one who}} survived – I {{witnessed}} their cruelty. I remember as if it were today how they shot me in the arm. I was afraid to go to the Nazi infirmary, though there were doctors there. I knew that if I went in, I'd never come out alive. … Despite my fear of the Nazis, I plucked a leaf from a tree and stuck it to my wound to stanch the bleeding. Then I cut a branch and tied it around the wound to hold it in place. With God's help, it healed in three days. Then I promised myself that if, with God's help, I got well and got out of there, away from those resha'im (wicked people), I would build a hospital in Eretz Yisrael where every human being would be cared for with dignity. And the basis of that hospital would be that the doctors and nurses <b>would</b> <b>believe</b> that there is a God in this world and that when they treat a patient, they are fulfilling the greatest mitzvah in the Torah.|$|E
25|$|On 30 December 2014, it was {{revealed}} that Stan would share a kiss with Sylvie, sparking trouble in his relationship with Cora.

They revealed that Cora would devastated by this and furious when Sylvie leaves the following day and Stan returns to her. The show announced on 10 March 2015 that Stan would propose to Cora after asking Tina to bring him a ring from home. They announced that when Stan manages to see Cora alone, he proposes and on 19 March 2015, viewers saw Cora agree to marry Stan. On 31 March 2015, details of Stan's death were announced. It was announced that Babe Smith (Annette Badland) would try to ruin Stan and Cora's wedding day by bringing Sylvie to share a final farewell with Stan and that Shirley and Mick would reunite, before Shirley sits with Stan as he dies. Stan will also decide to bring his wedding day forward due to his short time left and they prepare to marry. Viewers watched Stan unable to marry Cora due to poor health on 9 April 2015, but plan to reschedule for the following day. However, Stan was still too ill and did not marry Cora.
