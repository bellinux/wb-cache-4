5|$|José Ramos-Horta {{arrived in}} Darwin on 5 December saying that aid {{agencies}} the Australian Red Cross and Australian Society for Intercountry Aid Timor (ASIAT) had been banned from East Timor. In the same news conference Horta said that East Timor, Fretlin Government <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>accept</b> any UN assistance that included Australia.|$|E
5|$|It was {{intended}} to penalize, by means of reduced Congressional representation, states that withheld the franchise from adult male citizens for any reason other than participation in crime. This, it was hoped, would induce the former slave states to recognize the political rights of the former slaves, without directly forcing them to do so—something that it was thought the states <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>accept.</b>|$|E
5|$|That season, an {{economic}} recession factored into the selections. In general, bowl officials attempted to select teams in close geographic proximity {{to compensate for}} an anticipated drop in ticket sales. Maryland, however, stated that they <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>accept</b> a berth to face in-state rival Navy in the nearby EagleBank Bowl due to a conflict with the school's final exams. The Emerald Bowl was not seen as a viable choice due to Maryland's participation in it the year prior.|$|E

5|$|Between 1905 and 1907, Taft came {{to terms}} with the {{likelihood}} he would be the next Republican nominee for president, though he did not plan to actively campaign for it. When Justice Henry B. Brown resigned in 1905, Taft <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>accept</b> the seat although Roosevelt offered it, a position Taft held to when another seat opened in 1906. Edith Roosevelt, the First Lady, disliked the growing closeness between the two men, feeling that they were too much alike and that the president did not gain much from the advice of someone who rarely contradicted him.|$|E
5|$|In 1197, Reginald Fitz Jocelin's successor, Savaric FitzGeldewin, {{with the}} {{approval}} of Pope Celestine III, officially moved his seat to Glastonbury Abbey, but the monks there <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>accept</b> their new Bishop of Glastonbury and the title of Bishop of Bath and Glastonbury was used until the Glastonbury claim was abandoned in 1219. Savaric's successor, Jocelin of Wells, again moved the bishop's seat to Bath Abbey, with the title Bishop of Bath. Following his death the monks of Bath unsuccessfully attempted to regain authority over Wells. There were 40 monks on the roll in 1206.|$|E
5|$|In the 2003–04 season Hašek {{injured his}} groin after playing just 14 games. On January 9, {{he and the}} team agreed he should rest his injury for two to four weeks. Hašek privately told general manager Ken Holland that he <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>accept</b> any pay while he was injured. On February 10, he {{announced}} {{that he was not going}} to continue to play that season, surprising the Red Wings management. He eventually revealed that he refused about $3 million of his $6 million salary. In April 2004, he underwent groin surgery in Prague, and returned to his hometown of Pardubice to recuperate.|$|E
50|$|Juan Domingo Perón {{could attend}} the {{elementary}} school without problems, despite his complex legal situation. However, his grandmother feared in 1910 that he <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be <b>accepted</b> in the military school. Under the highly strict social customs of the time, an illegitimate son <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be <b>accepted</b> in the military, nor a child with indigenous ancestry. Juana Sosa {{was the daughter of}} a Tehuelche father and a Quechua mother. So, {{with the help of the}} social relations of her late husband, she forged a birth certificate that would allow Juan to pass the requirements.|$|R
5000|$|There {{is also a}} hadith from Mohammad {{that the}} prayers {{of a person who}} gossips <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be <b>accepted</b> for forty days and nights. (Al-Kafi, Vol. 6, p. 400) ...|$|R

5|$|It has {{not been}} said of any people on the earth that the moon was {{observed}} that night such {{that it could be}} stated that it was not split. Even if this had been reported from many different places, so that one would have to exclude the possibility that all agreed upon a lie, yet, we <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>accept</b> this as proof to the contrary, for the moon is not seen in the same way by different people... An eclipse is visible in one country but not in the other one; in one place it is total, in the other one only partial.|$|E
5|$|Much {{of eastern}} Cuba, already under storm alert, was placed under a State of Emergency {{due to the}} threat of Georges. President Castro {{emphasized}} the severity of the hurricane during a two-hour address to the nation on September23. He explained, in great detail, civil preparation maps and impacts from past hurricanes. His last note was that he would refuse any aid from the United States as they (Cuba) <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>accept</b> aid from a country that has an embargo on them.|$|E
5|$|The {{great number}} of Russian horses {{captured}} as matériel during wartime became {{a threat to the}} Finnhorse's purebreeding: many Russian animals were stallions, {{and there was no way}} to ensure new owners would not crossbreed them with Finnhorses. For practical and political reasons, Soviet Russia <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>accept</b> these horses back as a part of Finland's massive war indemnity. Finnhorses however, were accepted as payment, and a total of 18000 animals were sold to Soviet Russia at low rates in 1947 and 1948. The best Finnhorses were not offered to the Soviets, however, and according to contemporary witnesses, many showy but otherwise useless horses ended up in Russia.|$|E

5000|$|Albanian peasants in {{southern}} Albania {{reacted to the}} actions of Ottoman administration and in June 1847, their representatives met in Mesaplik. In a memorandum sent to the Turkish sultan they declared that they <b>would</b> <b>not</b> send soldiers in the regular army, <b>would</b> <b>not</b> pay the new taxes and <b>would</b> also <b>not</b> <b>accept</b> the new administration ...|$|R
50|$|Dumont's {{statements}} about immigration, he said, {{led to the}} passing of a code of conduct by the town of Hérouxville that notified Muslims that face veils or stoning women <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be <b>accepted</b> there.|$|R
5|$|Although {{the case}} was filed in the Western District of Wisconsin, the judge there recused himself {{as a friend of}} the magazine. The case was {{therefore}} brought before Judge Robert W. Warren, a judge in the Eastern District of Wisconsin. Because of the sensitive nature of information at stake in the trial, two separate hearings were conducted, one in public, and the other in camera. The defendants, Morland and the editors of The Progressive, <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>accept</b> security clearances, which would put restraints on their free speech, and so were not present at the in camera hearings. Their lawyers did obtain clearances so that they could participate, but were forbidden from conveying anything they heard there to their clients.|$|E
5|$|Both Warren and Brown stated {{early in}} the race that they <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>accept</b> {{television}} advertisement assistance from Super PACs and interest groups. On January 23, 2012, both candidates signed the agreement, or People's Pledge. While no outside groups were obligated by the agreement, both candidates agreed to donate a sum equal to 50% of an advertisement run by any groups to a charity of the other candidate's choice. The pledge was broken twice, by Brown supporters. In March the American Petroleum Institute and Coalition of Americans for Political Equality launched ads supporting Brown, and as a result, the Brown campaign agreed to make donations of $1,000 and $34,545, respectively, to the charity of Warren's choice: the Autism Consortium.|$|E
5|$|Corzine, in {{attempting}} to pass his conceptual budget, came into conflict with fellow state Democrats in the New Jersey General Assembly, particularly over their refusal to implement his proposed increase of the state's sales tax from 6% to 7% to fill a $4.5 billion budget gap. Corzine maintained that the gap could not be filled by any other means due to the state's constitution and a ruling of New Jersey's Supreme Court. Long before the deadline date, Corzine had stated that he <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>accept</b> a budget that {{did not include a}} sales tax increase. Due to Corzine's insistence, the state's General Assembly, which was dominated by Democrats, refused to pass a budget before the deadline.|$|E

50|$|Depending on how {{strongly}} {{the case is}} stated, the hypothesis conflicts with mainstream neo-Darwinism. Most biologists would accept Daisyworld-style homeostasis as possible, but <b>would</b> certainly <b>not</b> <b>accept</b> {{the idea that this}} equates to the whole biosphere acting as one organism.|$|R
5|$|Following Jones' rejection, Garrard vetoed a {{bill that}} would have allowed the {{legislature}} to select the state's presidential and vice-presidential electors; despite the fact that the law ran contrary to the state constitution, Garrard's veto further strained his relations with the Senate. After the Senate rejected nominee William Trigg, the state's newspapers openly talked of an executive-legislative feud and claimed the Senate had its own favorite candidate for the position and <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>accept</b> anyone else. When the Senate rejected Willis Green in January 1804, Garrard declared that he would make no more nominations for the position. Accusations of bad faith were exchanged between the governor and the Senate, after which Garrard nominated John Adair, the popular Speaker of the House. The Senate finally confirmed this choice.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, the United States, Russia, the European Union (EU) and the UN {{sought to}} replace the Vance plan, which brought in the UNPROFOR. They {{formulated}} the Z-4 Plan giving Serb-majority areas in Croatia substantial autonomy. After numerous and frequently uncoordinated changes to the proposed plan, including leaking of its draft elements to the press in October, the Z-4 Plan was presented on 30 January 1995. Neither Croatia nor the RSK liked the plan. Croatia was concerned that the RSK might accept it, but Tuđman realised that Milošević, who would ultimately make the decision for the RSK, <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>accept</b> the plan for fear that it would set a precedent for a political settlement in Kosovoallowing Croatia to accept the plan with little possibility {{for it to be}} implemented. The RSK refused to receive, let alone accept, the plan.|$|E
5|$|In August 1943, {{recruiting}} {{policies were}} changed to permit SPARS to marry {{men of the}} USCG without having to resign. The USCG would continue to accept applicants who were married to men in the Army, Navy, or Marine Corps, but <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>accept</b> {{a woman who was}} already married to an enlisted man or an officer serving in the USCG. However, women could join the SPARS if their husbands were enrolled as temporary members of the reserve. In November 1943, the marriage policy with respect to recruits was changed further to permit women who were wives of cadets, warrant officers, or enlisted men of the USCG to enlist or be commissioned in the SPARs. The ban remained on women whose husbands were commissioned officers in the USCG with the rank of ensign or above.|$|E
5000|$|On 7 December 1918 the Ministry of Post and Telegraph {{announced}} in the daily newspapers that German stamps and postcards without the overprint [...] "Poczta Polska" [...] <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be <b>accepted</b> for postage as from 16 December 1918.|$|R

60|$|Even if Ralph had {{not been}} angry because of the danger he {{had been forced to}} run, he <b>would</b> <b>not</b> have <b>accepted</b> any such cheerful invitation, and, instead of replying, he looked {{carefully}} around in search of the speaker.|$|R
5|$|In November 1167 Foliot {{was summoned}} to Normandy, then ruled by Henry II, to meet with papal legates and the king. Roger of York, Hilary of Chichester, and Roger of Worcester were also summoned to attend. After some {{discussion}} and argument, Henry appears to have agreed that the legates could judge both the king's case against Becket {{as well as the}} bishops' case. Henry also offered a compromise {{on the subject of the}} Constitutions of Clarendon, that the legates accepted. However, when the legates met with Becket on 18November, it quickly became apparent that Becket <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>accept</b> negotiations with the king nor accept the legates as judges of either case against him. As the legates had no mandate to compel Becket to accept them as judges, the negotiations came to an end with the king and bishops still appealing to the papacy.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} {{to calls for}} action from the Drapier in the second letter, a group of bankers joined together on 17 August 1724, agreeing in writing that they <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>accept</b> the coin produced under Wood's patent. Other merchants and tradesmen followed in a similar fashion. However, this did not stop Walpole from ordering the Commissioners of the Revenue in Ireland to enter the coin into the Irish economy. Regardless of Walpole's orders, the Irish Lord Justices did not act, Lord Shannon did not command that his troops should be issued Wood's coin, and Middleton's House of Lords and Conolly's House of Commons did not pass any resolution backing up Walpole's order, which effectively prevented the coin from being distributed.|$|E
5|$|On November 29, 1820, the Assembly {{chartered}} the Bank of the Commonwealth, {{another source}} from which debtors could obtain money. Creditors {{did not want}} to accept payment from either the Bank of Kentucky or the Bank of the Commonwealth; the notes of the former were depreciated {{due to a lack of}} capital and the latter had no capital and no guarantee of state credit. In December 1820, the Assembly modified the replevin law to state that creditors who would accept payment in notes from the Bank of the Commonwealth but not the Bank of Kentucky would be forced to wait three months to collect on a debt. The wait was one year if the creditor accepted only notes from the Bank of Kentucky, and it remained two years for creditors who <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>accept</b> notes from either.|$|E

25|$|On 2March 1995, Gummer {{announced}} to the Commons that the government <b>would</b> <b>not</b> fully <b>accept</b> the Commission's proposals and certain districts would be referred to the Commission for a further review. He also announced John Banham's resignation in protest at this.|$|R
