2500|$|To {{minimize}} the civilian losses, Kjell Nielsen at Norsk Hydro delayed the tapping of the potassium hydroxide {{one day to}} allow the shipment to be carried on a Sunday. On Saturday 19 February 1944 the plant director Bjarne Nilssen informed the railway that a wagon with potassium hydroxide would be sent with train number three the following day departing from Rjukan at 8:55 and connecting with the ferry from Mæl at 9:45; the shipment would arrive at Tinnoset at 11:35. NSB car Lf4 no. 32628 was loaded with 39 barrels, of which five [...] barrels were to be unloaded at Notodden. [...] The wagons were set up at Rjukan on the Saturday, but failed a <b>weight</b> <b>check,</b> {{and part of the}} load was transferred to wagon L-84. The wagons were stored overnight with a single guard.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{stocking}} density {{on the growth}} of mulloway, Argyrosomus japonicus, was tested with 17 g fish stocked at 4. 08, 8. 16, or 16. 32 kg m− 3 in 50 l aquaria. <b>Weight</b> <b>checks</b> were carried out every 2 weeks to track performance. Each density treatment was also compared to a nonhandled control group to establish if handling during <b>weight</b> <b>checks</b> influenced the growth of mulloway. Mulloway performed poorly at the lowest density and, under the current experiment conditions, growth {{did not appear to}} be negatively affected by regular handling...|$|R

5000|$|On December 17, {{terms were}} finally agreed {{and it was}} officially {{announced}} that the fight would take place at Madison Square Garden in New York City on March 18, 2017 exclusively on HBO PPV. Golovkin tweeted the announcement via whilst Jacobs uploaded a quick video on social media. At {{the time of the}} fight, both fighters had a combined 35 consecutive knockouts. It was reported that Golovkin's IBO world title would not be at stake. The IBO website later confirmed the belt would be at stake. HBO officially announced the fight on December 22, being billed as [...] "Middleweight Madness". Loeffler confirmed there was no rematch clause in place. Ultimately, the IBF title was not at stake for Jacobs because he skipped a fight-day <b>weight</b> <b>check.</b> Unlike the other major sanctioning bodies, the IBF requires participants in title fights to submit to a <b>weight</b> <b>check</b> {{on the morning of the}} fight, as well as the official weigh-in the day before the fight; at the morning <b>weight</b> <b>check,</b> they can weigh no more than 10 lb above the fight's weight limit.|$|E

40|$|Objective Although {{body image}} {{disturbance}} (BID) {{is considered a}} core symptom in anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN), {{little is known about}} its psychopathological correlates. The present study aimed at analysing the correlation of aspects of BID with psychopathological and temperamental characteristics. Method A sample of 1288 patients (538 AN and 750 BN) were assessed through a structured diagnostic interview, the Eating Disorders Inventory and Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire. Cognition of body image distortion, <b>weight</b> <b>checking,</b> fear of <b>weight</b> gain and body dissatisfaction were assessed by specific questions during the interview. Results Various aspects of BID formed similar, but not identical, dimensions in AN and BN. In both groups, anticipatory anxiety and interoceptive awareness were significantly and independently associated with body image distortion, whereas ineffectiveness was associated with <b>weight</b> <b>checking.</b> Discussion Body image disturbance is a multidimensional characteristic linked to psychological features, such as anticipatory anxiety, ineffectiveness and interoceptive awareness. These findings have scientific and treatment implications, and should be considered by clinicians in adopting successful treatment strategies...|$|R
50|$|Webber, on {{the other}} hand, was called to answer charges of missing the {{mandatory}} <b>weight</b> <b>check</b> {{at the end of}} qualifying. The stewards accepted that Red Bull Racing had made an error and saw that the car was immediately sent to scrutineering once it was realised. Webber escaped with a reprimand, thereby allowing him to keep his grid position for the race.|$|E
5000|$|During this period, the Formula One rules {{specified}} that any car must weigh at least 585 kg {{to be deemed}} {{in compliance with the}} rules. The method of testing was somewhat haphazard - teams would be notified that they would be [...] "weight checked" [...] when they exited the pits during practice or qualifying. This gave the teams ample opportunity to add weight to their cars while in the pits so as to pass the test. Former Formula One driver Eddie Cheever claimed that during 1981, when his Tyrrell was tagged for a <b>weight</b> <b>check</b> in qualifying, the team took off the [...] "racing" [...] rear wing (a fiberglass/metal hybrid) and replaced it with a [...] "weight check" [...] rear wing before allowing him to proceed to the scale. Cheever said it took four of them to lift the [...] "weight check" [...] rear wing, and the car was largely undriveable with it installed. He believed that the <b>weight</b> <b>check</b> rear wing was made mostly of lead.|$|E
50|$|Ayrton Senna shocked no-one {{by taking}} pole position, but second {{place was a}} {{surprise}} with Stefano Modena taking {{full advantage of the}} superior Pirelli qualifying tyres to be second followed by Patrese, Piquet, a disappointed Mansell, Berger, Prost, Moreno, Alesi, and de Cesaris. Alex Caffi had a huge accident in practice and would not participate in the race. Elsewhere Martin Brundle was disqualified for missing a <b>weight</b> <b>check.</b>|$|E

30|$|Atypical {{antipsychotics}} are {{a treatment}} {{option in the}} management of anorexia nervosa. Risperidone has not been studied as frequently as olanzapine for eating disorders. Risperidone was chosen for its more favorable side effect profile and decreased cost to the patient. Previous studies on anorexia nervosa treatment have occurred during inpatient treatment and have limited follow-up due to patients’ refusal to initiate or maintain medication compliance. This case presents 17  months of outpatient data. The efficacy of risperidone therapy was evaluated with frequent <b>weight</b> <b>checks,</b> subjective decrease in rigidity, serial complete metabolic panels, and restoration of menses.|$|R
50|$|In {{the first}} eight events Larrauri only missed the cut twice and Modena would have {{qualified}} for them all {{were it not for}} two disqualifications for missing a <b>weight</b> <b>check</b> in practice at Monaco, and for having too high a rear wing in Mexico. Starts didn't turn into finishes, with engine failures, clutch and gearbox problems, and even a flat battery meaning that Modena's 11th place at the Hungarian Grand Prix would be the car's best result.|$|E

5000|$|The {{traditional}} [...] "minimum weight" [...] {{system where}} weights below a specified weight are rejected. Normally the minimum weight is the weight that is {{printed on the}} pack or a weight level that exceeds that to allow for weight losses after production such as evaporation of commodities that have a moisture content. The larger wholesale companies have mandated that any product shipped to them have accurate <b>weight</b> <b>checks</b> such that a customer can be confident that they are getting the amount of product for which they paid. These wholesalers charge large fees for inaccurately filled packages.|$|R
25|$|The four bags {{belonging}} to Corby and her companions were not weighed individually at Brisbane Airport, {{with a total}} weight of 65kg being taken instead. The Bali police and customs did not record {{the weight of the}} bags, despite requests from Corby for them to do so. Corby requested that her other luggage be weighed in order to establish if there was an addition of approximately 4.2kg from the <b>weight</b> <b>checked</b> in and recorded at Brisbane Airport. The weight increase would, according to her defence, have shown that the cannabis had been added after she had checked in her luggage. However, the request was denied.|$|R
40|$|The {{toxicological}} studies of an antimicrobial compound and ethyl acetate extract isolated from a culture broth {{of a new}} strain of Streptomyces bangladeshiensis (collected from soil) were performed on long Evan?s rats.

The results of hematological and biochemical tests showed that the compound AA- 2 and the extract did not cause any considerable changes in {{the values of the}} parameters observed in control group rats...|$|R
50|$|Fontana {{made his}} Formula One debut at the 1997 French Grand Prix {{replacing}} Gianni Morbidelli who had broken his arm {{prior to the}} race. He qualified 20th and retired when he understeered {{and ended up in}} a gravel trap. Prior to the British GP, team principal Peter Sauber looked for replacements to take Fontana's seat but eventually decided to keep Fontana on board. During qualifying, he missed a red light indicating that the car must come in for a mandatory <b>weight</b> <b>check.</b> Fontana drove past the light and was forced to start {{at the back of the}} grid. In the race, Fontana finished 9th despite his right leg becoming numb. At Hockenheim, he started 18th and finished 9th despite spinning early on.|$|E
5000|$|The International Boxing Federation (IBF) has {{a unique}} weigh-in policy in title fights. In {{addition}} to making the weight at the official weigh-in {{the day before the}} fight, the boxers are required to submit to a <b>weight</b> <b>check</b> {{on the morning of the}} fight. During this later weigh-in, the fighter must weigh no more than 10 lb above the weight limit for the fight. If a boxer skips the morning weigh-in, or fails to make weight at that time, the fight can still proceed, but the IBF title will not be at stake. In heavyweight title fights, the second weigh-in is still mandatory, but since there is no upper weight limit in that class, a boxer can only be sanctioned for failing to submit to the weigh-in.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, Ligier had a {{disastrous}} weekend {{on their home}} turf with both René Arnoux and Stefan Johansson failing to qualify, though they did have a celebration of sorts over the weekend as Arnoux turned 40 {{the day after the}} race. Julian Bailey also failed to qualify in his Tyrrell, while Piercarlo Ghinzani qualified 22nd in his Zakspeed but was excluded for missing a <b>weight</b> <b>check,</b> thus promoting Oscar Larrauri's EuroBrun to the last grid spot. Larrauri qualifying was to the displeasure of many of those towards the front of the grid as the Argentine in the slower than most EuroBrun-Ford Cosworth had developed a reputation of being a mobile chicane in both qualifying and races and most felt that would be a problem on the shortest track on the F1 calendar.|$|E

5000|$|Pets have a Hunger meter, Happy meter, Bracelet {{meter and}} Discipline meter to {{determine}} how healthy and well behaved the pet is. There is also an age and <b>weight</b> <b>check</b> function for the current age and weight of the pet. Filling up the Hunger meter {{can be achieved by}} feeding the pet a meal (usually a loaf of bread) or a snack (usually a piece of candy). Filling up the Happy meter can be achieved by playing mini games with the pet or by feeding it a snack (there are no limits to this, but there are limits to how many meals can be fed). Mini games vary between versions, but mainly involve guessing which way the pet will turn (left or right) within 5 tries. The Discipline meter can be filled by pressing the [...] "scold" [...] option when a pet calls for attention but refuses to play or be fed a meal. The pet will leave droppings around the screen from time to time, and can become sick if they are not cleaned up. Before the pet goes to the bathroom, it will make a face and stink lines will appear around it. If the player activates the toilet icon during this animation, but before the pet has gone to the bathroom, the pet will use a toilet instead. When done repeatedly, the pet can be potty trained.|$|E
