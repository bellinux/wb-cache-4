Speaking again on 1 June, Commissioner Dalli noted the outbreaks have been limited in origin to the greater Hamburg area and declared any product ban would be disproportionate. He also said he is working with Agriculture Commissioner Dacian Cioloş [...] "to address the hardship faced by this group of our citizens that has also been hit hard by the E. coli outbreak".

And they shouldn't be discriminated against according to the nature of that love. To deny people the recognition for a relationship which is based on love is to deny, in my opinion, one of humankind's most basic, but as I said elusive, qualities. Let the Parliament vote. It makes the laws of the land... we shouldn't be frightened about celebrating the love of one person for another." [...] Prime Minister Abbott said [...] "I deeply respect his views and I’m confident that he would respect mine, he would respect my sister’s, he would respect Bill Shorten’s and Tanya Plibersek’s and Warren Entsch’s, and that’s what we need – <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> mutual respect of all the different views on this debate because as I said, decent people can differ on this subject." ...|$|E

500|$|Years later, showrunner D. B. Weiss {{commented that}} the {{explicit}} style of the execution scene was selected in part {{to make it clear}} to the viewers that Eddard Stark, despite being the arguable protagonist of season one, actually was dead: [...] "It’s that rule: 'If you don't see the body then they’re not really dead.' [...] Like when we cut Ned’s head off, we didn’t want a gory Monty Python geyser of blood, but <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the blade enter his neck and cut out on the frame where the blade was mid-neck.

2500|$|Entity FX {{also had}} to create the first {{instance}} of Clark’s super hearing, an ability he acquires in the episode [...] "Whisper". As Beck describes the task: [...] "When you talk about someone flying, it’s something we all know, but this is super hearing and <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a visual for the hearing." [...] For the effect of showing Clark using his super hearing, Mat Beck and Entity FX decided {{that they wanted to}} travel into Clark’s ear and see all the different parts of his eardrum working together to create the sound he is hearing. The task proved difficult to achieve, and Beck asserts that changes will be made to perfect the look of Clark using his super hearing. Clark’s super hearing was originally to be revealed early in the season, but when The WB informed the Smallville team that Tarzan, the main character in the studio’s update of the classic legend, also had super hearing the team decided to delay the introduction so that the ability could be used in a manner that surpassed what was shown on Tarzan. Luckily for Smallville, The WB’s Tarzan was canceled before [...] "Whisper" [...] aired, allowing Smallville to be the only show on the network with a character who has superhuman hearing.|$|E
2500|$|... {{on behalf}} of some 132 cosponsors, {{introduced}} this measure. I {{would also like to}} thank Mr. Lampson from Texas as the Chairman of the Caucus on Missing and Exploited Children, and Mr. Ose from the State of California, who have devoted much of their time to raising our level of awareness of the growing problem of international child abduction. [...] We are taking action on this measure {{on behalf of}} the parents of our abducted and wrongfully retained children. These left-behind parents have put their faith and trust in an international agreement, The Hague Convention, which is clear and explicit on the obligation of signatory governments to return an abducted or wrongfully retained child to his or her country of habitual residence. Nevertheless, we have found that in a number of nations, for a variety of reasons, this does not occur, and the resultant frustration, heartbreak and outrage has led us to act on the measure before us today. [...] I should also add that we need to have our State Department do more to promote compliance with The Hague Convention. The return of an abducted or illegally retained child should be on the top of the Secretary’s meetings with any official of a country involved in such cases. [...] This is not a problem that should be handled as a routine exchange of diplomatic notes or phone calls by junior U.S. officials to their foreign counterparts. <b>We</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> some concern and some concrete actions by the highest levels of our government to redress what is, evidently, a growing international problem. [...] It is our hope that by adopting this resolution, and sending it to the floor for speedy action, we will send a strong signal that this is an issue that we care deeply about. We need to get the attention of the Governments of Germany, Sweden, Austria, Mexico, and Honduras that they cannot expect The Hague Convention to be a one-way street.|$|E

5000|$|The seventh {{season of}} Parks and Recreation overall, {{as well as}} the series finale, {{received}} universal praise from critics. Rotten Tomatoes gave the season a 100% rating based on 13 reviews. IGN reviewer Matt Fowler gave the series finale a perfect 10 out of 10 score, saying [...] "Doing what the show does best, Parks knocked it clear out of the park with [...] "One Last Ride." [...] A remarkably irresistible swirl of love and satire. The writers knew it wasn't enough to just send everyone off into the future. They knew <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that future. Not just for peace of mind, but because we've all become so lovingly invested in the characters. This final season proved to us that we could withstand a time jump and still remain attached to everyone. And this finale used that to hop through the Pawnee gang's futures, creating an exciting, heartwarming journey." ...|$|R
