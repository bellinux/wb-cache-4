5|$|In {{the early}} hours of the morning of November 7, 1825, the very morning the {{legislature}} was to convene, Sharp was assassinated. Charges were made that Old Court supporters had instigated the murder. Crittenden tried to blunt these charges by introducing a resolution condemning Sharp's murder and offering $3,000 for the murderer's capture. When assassin Jereboam O. Beauchamp was apprehended, it became clear that the motivation for the killing <b>was</b> <b>personal,</b> not political. (Beauchamp's wife had married him on the condition that he kill Sharp, who had refused to claim the child he had fathered with her previously.) Despite this, Crittenden refused a request to represent Beauchamp in his murder trial because he wanted to avoid any implication in the matter.|$|E
5|$|Megan Hunt (Dana Delany) and Peter Dunlop (Nicholas Bishop) {{arrive at}} the scene of Ed Russell (David Shumbris), a stay at home father, who is found by his wife Jen (Molly Price) stabbed to death at their house, whilst their baby {{daughter}} Sophie is at home. When Detective Bud Morris (John Carroll Lynch) goes to tell Ed's son Mike (Jake O'Connor) about his father’s death, Megan stops him, telling Bud to let his mother tell him. Megan has a flashback to when she was younger, focussing on when a young Megan (Madeline Milne) receives the news of her father’s death from a policeman, as the police did not know where her mother, Joan (Joanna Cassidy), was at the time. Jen admits that she cleaned up some footprints; she thought they were Mike's. The attack on Ed <b>was</b> <b>personal</b> and after Detective Samantha Baker (Sonja Sohn) concludes that the attack on Ed <b>was</b> <b>personal</b> after she finds evidence to suggest Mike did indeed kill his father, such as negative emails. Mike protests his innocence, and Ethan Gross (Geoffrey Arend) finds evidence which makes Mike innocent. Throughout the day, Megan tries to rebuild her relationship with Lacey (Mary Mouser), carpooling Lacey and her friends, Sarah (Teresa Celentano) and Betsy (Anna Friedman).|$|E
5|$|Pain was {{too young}} to serve King William Rufus, but {{according}} to the later 12th-century writings of Walter Map he may have been a chamberlain—one of the officials in charge of the royal household—for William's brother, King Henry I (reigned 1100–1135). There is no contemporary evidence for Pain having held that office and nor is it likely, given Map's story, that Pain was involved with Henry's financial affairs; rather it appears that if indeed he was a chamberlain, he was a body servant. Map relates a story about Pain serving the king personally at night, providing Henry with wine if the king called for it. The story continues that Pain once drank the wine and was caught out by Henry when the king subsequently demanded his nightcap. Map finishes the story by saying that the king then ordered that Pain should be given wine every night while awaiting the king's pleasure. Although the story is unlikely to be true in all details, it suggests that Pain's service to the king <b>was</b> <b>personal</b> as well as judicial and governmental. Other evidence against Map's claim that Pain was a chamberlain is that he never attested a royal charter in that office.|$|E

Reasons for staying included defiance (not willing to be intimidated), age (too old to move), money (not wanting to abandon businesses or houses), caring (not wanting to abandon elderly parents or pets), duty (civil servants and other essential workers were asked not to leave). Some literally missed the boat. King George VI sent a message of hope to the Bailiffs of each Island, with the request it be read out to the people.|$|E

25|$|In May 1897 Wemyss {{indicated}} to the NBR {{that he planned}} to build a new connecting railway from Muiredge Den to Methil; at six miles in length it was to connect numerous collieries in the district. The NBR immediately took the view that this was prohibited under the thirling agreement, and lengthy and antagonistic correspondence followed. The NBR argued that the licence to build new colliery connections <b>was</b> <b>personal</b> to Wemyss (not the WCC) and did not allow him to carry the minerals of others on the line. The matter went to arbitration, and the arbitrator gave his decision on 10 March 1899: he found in favour of Wemyss. The NBR complied with the obligations of the NBR's finding, but continued to try to dissuade Wemyss from building the line by proposing concessions on the continued use of the NBR lines.|$|E
25|$|On 28 July 1710, the Revd Dr Richard Newton was {{admitted}} principal of Hart Hall. Newton was a well-connected, energetic educational reformer. He was appointed principal from 'a very peaceful retirement' as Rector of Sudborough, where he <b>was</b> <b>personal</b> tutor to two brothers, who were both {{destined to be}} prime minister — Thomas Pelham-Holles and Henry Pelham — bringing the younger with him to Hart Hall. He dedicated himself to raising the Hall from debt and securing a firmer financial endowment. Newton planned to redesign the Hall around a proper quadrangle, with a tutor, or angler, and students living in each angle, and common buildings along the sides. However, only two buildings in his design were ever built: one angle in the south-east corner of the Old Quadrangle (nowadays known as the Cottage), and his simple stone Chapel {{on the south side}} (consecrated 25 November 1716), which now serves as the College's Library. These buildings were financed entirely from Newton's pocket, to the sum of around £2000 (around £ adjusted for inflation).|$|E

500|$|Elizabeth {{established}} an English church that helped shape {{a national identity}} and remains in place today. Those who praised her later as a Protestant heroine overlooked her refusal to drop all practices of Catholic origin from the Church of England.

In fact, Elizabeth believed that faith <b>was</b> <b>personal</b> and did not wish, as Francis Bacon put it, to [...] "make windows into men's hearts and secret thoughts".|$|E

500|$|Film editor Ted Roberts {{suggested}} the Diocese of Norwich, as Norfolk is noted for {{the density of}} its medieval churches {{in a variety of}} urban, coastal and rural locations.

Early location-scouting proved fruitful, and the production was bolstered by a meeting with Bishop Wood in March 1974, during which the bishop, after initial reluctance, gave the production his blessing. Filming began in April 1974.|$|E
