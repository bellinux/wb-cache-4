The transition may be first-order or continuous (critical) depending on the strength of the line tension associated with the <b>wedge</b> <b>bottom.</b> Exact results are reported for the interfacial properties near filling with both short-ranged (contact) forces and also van der Waals interactions. For sufficiently short-ranged forces we show the lines of critical and first-order filling meet at a tricritical point. This contrasts with the case of dispersion forces for which the lines meet at a critical end-point. Our transfer matrix analysis is compared with generalized random-walk arguments based on a necklace model and is shown to be a thermodynamically consistent description of fluctuation effects at filling. Connections with the predictions of conformal invariance for droplet shapes in wedges is also made.

40|$|We {{show that}} the 3 D wedge filling {{transition}} {{in the presence of}} short-ranged interactions can be first order or second order depending on the strength of the line tension associated with the <b>wedge</b> <b>bottom.</b> This fact implies the existence of a tricritical point characterized by a short-distance expansion which differs from the usual continuous filling transition. Our analysis is based on an effective one-dimensional model for the 3 D wedge filling, which arises from the identification of the breather modes as the only relevant interfacial fluctuations. From such analysis we find a correspondence between continuous 3 D filling at bulk coexistence and 2 D wetting transitions with random-bond disorder. Comisión Europea, MEIF-CT- 2003 - 50104...|$|R

Fluid is assumed incompressible and entry speed of the structure is kept constant. Geo-reconstruct(or PLIC-VOF) scheme is used for the tracking of the deforming free surface. Numerical analyses are carried out for the deadrise angles of 10 °, 20 ° and 30 °. For each deadrise angle, variations are made for the grid size on the <b>wedge</b> <b>bottom</b> and for the entry speed. The magnitude and the location of impact pressure and the total drag force, which is the summation of pressure distributed {{at the bottom of the}} structure, are analyzed.

In addition to the previously reported nonanalytic contribution proportional to −q ln q, due to the nucleation of disclination lines at the <b>wedge</b> <b>bottoms</b> and apexes of the substrate, the next-to-leading contribution is proportional to q for a given substrate roughness, in agreement with Berreman’s predictions. We characterize this term, finding that it has two contributions: the deviations of the nematic director field with respect to a reference field corresponding to the isolated disclination lines and their associated core free energies. Comparison with the results obtained from the Landau-de Gennes model shows that our model is quite accurate in the limit wL > 1, when strong anchoring conditions are effectively achieve...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} interfacial {{structural and}} fluctuation effects occurring at continuous filling transitions in 3 D wedge geometries. We show that fluctuation-induced wedge covariance relations {{that have been}} reported recently for 2 D filling and wetting have mean-field or classical analogues that apply to higher-dimensional systems. Classical wedge covariance emerges from analysis of filling in shallow wedges based on a simple interfacial Hamiltonian model and is supported by detailed numerical investigations of filling within a more microscopic Landau-like density functional theory. Evidence is presented that classical wedge covariance is also obeyed for filling in more acute wedges in the asymptotic critical regime. For sufficiently short-ranged forces mean-field predictions for the filling critical exponents and covariance are destroyed by pseudo-one-dimensional interfacial fluctuations. We argue that in this filling fluctuation regime the critical exponents describing the divergence of length scales are related to values of the interfacial wandering exponent ζ(d) defined for planar interfaces in (bulk) two-dimensional (d = 2) and three-dimensional (d = 3) systems. For the interfacial height l_w∼ (θ-α) ^-β _w, with θ the contact angle and α the wedge tilt angle, we find βw = ζ(2) / 2 (1 −ζ(3)). For pure systems (thermal disorder) we recover the known result βw = 1 / 4 predicted by interfacial Hamiltonian studies whilst for random-bond disorder we predict the universal critical exponent β≈ 0. 59 even {{in the presence of}} dispersion forces. We revisit the transfer matrix theory of three-dimensional filling based on an effective interfacial Hamiltonian model and discuss the interplay between breather, tilt and torsional interfacial fluctuations. We show that the coupling of the modes allows the problem to be mapped onto a quantum mechanical problem as conjectured by previous authors. The form of the interfacial height probability distribution function predicted by the transfer matrix approach is shown to be consistent with scaling and thermodynamic requirements for distances close to and far from the <b>wedge</b> <b>bottom</b> respectively...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental and numerical study into {{the response of}} bolted connections between Glulam timber beams and tubular steel columns. Six specimens involving two different connection types subjected to monotonically increasing bending action are examined. The first connection type incorporates top and seat angles blind-bolted to the column and jointed to the beam through long bolts. The second connection type is formed by a steel T-stub slotted into the timber beam and connected to it by means of transverse bolts. In addition, two reinforcing techniques aimed at enhancing {{the response of the}} slotted-in T-stub configuration are investigated. These include the provision of a <b>bottom</b> <b>wedge</b> angle between the beam and the column as well as the use of perpendicular-to-grain screws to delay wood splitting. The experimental set-up, connection configurations and material properties are introduced followed by a detailed account of the test results and observations. The main behavioural patterns are identified from the experiments and key response characteristics such as stiffness, capacity and failure mechanism are discussed. This paper shows that the use of <b>bottom</b> <b>wedge</b> angles leads to significant enhancement in the flexural yield strength of the T-stub connections, accompanied by a relatively small change in the location of the bolt-group point of rotation (monitored herein by means of Digital Image Correlation techniques). Besides, the use of reinforcing screws is shown to be an effective detail for substantially increasing the rotational ductility of the connections. Finite element simulations of the tests are also presented, together with {{a detailed description of the}} modelling approaches employed, in order to gain further insight into the behaviour of the connections. Finally, the applicability of simplified component-based expressions, which are suitable for practical design assessment procedures, for the estimation of the stiffness and capacity of the proposed hybrid glulam-to-tubular column connections are presented and discussed...|$|R

[...] 25 pages, 19 figures, 1 table, {{supplementary}} material [URL] Mediterranean Water leaves {{the western end}} of the Strait of Gibraltar as a <b>bottom</b> <b>wedge</b> of salty and warm waters flowing down the continental slope. The salinity of the onset Mediterranean Outflow Water (MOW) is so high that leads to water much denser (initially in excess of 1. 5 kg m¿ 3) than the overlying central waters. During much of its initial descent, the MOW retains large salinity anomalies ¿ causing density anomalies that induce its gravity current character ¿ and relatively high westward speeds ¿ causing a substantial Coriolis force over long portions of its course. We use hydrographic data from six cruises (a total of 1176 stations) plus velocity data from two cruises, together with high-resolution bathymetric data, to track the preferential MOW pathways from the Strait of Gibraltar into the western Gulf of Cadiz and to examine the relation of these pathways to the bottom topography. A methodology for tributary systems in drainage basins, modified to account for the Coriolis force, emphasizes the good agreement between the observed trajectories and those expected from a topographically-constrained flow. Both contour avenues and cross-slope channels are important and have complementary roles steering the MOW along the upper and middle continental slope before discharging as a neutrally buoyant flow into the western Gulf of Cadiz. Our results show that the interaction between bottom flow and topography sets the path and final equilibrium depths of the modern MOW. Furthermore, they support the hypothesis that, {{as a result of the}} high erosive power of the bottom flow and changes in bottom-water speed, the MOW pathways and mixing rates have changed in the geological pastThis research has been carried out with the support of the Spanish government, through projects MOC 2 (CTM 2008 - 06438 -C 02 - 01), MED-OUTFLOW 2009 (CTM 2008 - 03422 -E/MAR), MED-OUTFLOW- 2011 (CTM 2010 - 11488 -E) and VA-DE-RETRO (CTM 2014 - 56987 -P) Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Distribution of Transparent Exopolymer Particles (TEP) in the Pearl River estuary, China, was {{investigated}} during two cruises in August 2009 and January 2010. TEPcolor concentrations were 521. 5 - 1727. 4 mg Xeq. L- 1 (mu g Gum Xanthan equivalent liter(- 1)) in August 2009 and 88. 7 - 1586. 9 mu g Xeq. L- 1 in January 2010, respectively. The size of TEP generally {{increased in the}} seaward along the longitudinal section with the dominant size of 2 - 40 mu m during the cruises. Experimental work suggested that both concentration and size of TEP increased with Ca 2 + concentration (from 0. 8 mmol L- 1 to 10 mmol L- 1). In the field study, Ca 2 + concentration had a positive correlation with TEPcolor concentration in the surface layer with salinity < 16. Decrease of TEP concentration seaward from intermediary salinity was partly due to dilution of seawater as well as enhanced aggregation and sedimentation of TEP via increasing divalent cation concentration. TEP concentration and turbidity maximum coexisted {{at the tip of}} salt <b>wedge</b> in the <b>bottom</b> layer during the wet season, and positive correlation between TEP and turbidity was observed in the winter. Relationships between TEP and turbidity suggested the important contribution of TEP aggregation to flocculation and sedimentation of particles in estuaries. Different pattern of TEP during two cruises can be attributed to physical process (i. e., mixing type) in estuaries. These findings indicated that formation and distribution of TEP were largely influenced by interaction between physical and biogeochemical processes in the Pearl River estuary.

40|$|The Río de la Plata {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} estuarine systems of the world. It drains the waters of the Paraná and Uruguay rivers, which constitute the second largest basin of South America. As a result, it has a huge discharge with a mean of around 25, 000 m 3 s- 1, and maximum values as high as 50, 000 m 3 s- 1 under extreme conditions. Water stratification is controlled by the confluence of high buoyancy continental discharge advecting offshore, lying on denser shelf waters that intrude into the estuary as a topographically controlled wedge, typically between 100 and 250 km long. The upstream reach of the <b>wedge</b> defines a <b>bottom</b> salinity front, located over a submersed bar named Barra del Indio shoal following the 10 m isobath. Several authors have pointed out the importance of this bottom salinity front in structuring plankton communities as well as in the development of spawning grounds for several coastal fishes. It has been suggested that observed patterns result from retention processes associated to the bottom salinity front. However neither the occurrence of this retention nor the physical and/or behavioral mechanisms involved have been well studied. It has been classically thought that retention would be a natural consequence of the theoretical circulation associated to a salt wedge: salty water incoming from the bottom would push plankton upstream to the bottom salinity front. Nevertheless, several recent papers based on numerical simulations and ADCP current observations have shown that estuarine circulation does not necessarily follow this pattern and, moreover, that it is highly variable and essentially wind dominated. These papers indicate that estuarine scales of variability replicate atmospheric ones, and that currents response to changes in the wind field is very fast, occurring in a lapse of around 6 hours. They also demonstrated that estuarine response to winds can be explained in terms of two modes, both implying currents with a phase lag with respect to winds that depends on the location in the estuary, but that in any case, produce a response in the bottom layer. As a result of the described features, in the time scales relevant to biota, the Río de la Plata would display weather and climate, as the atmosphere does. Atmospheric circulation in the region is characterized in synoptic to intra-seasonal scales by a high variability. As winds in the region rarely blow from the same direction for more than a few days, currents present the same feature. A striking question is, then, whether this highly variable system can favor retention and if this is the fact, what are the involved mechanisms. The aim of this paper is to explore this matter. A set of process oriented numerical experiments in which neutral particles are released along the frontal zone of the Río de la Plata and its vicinity and tracked for different wind conditions in short time scales is conducted. Results of numerical experiments are complemented with an analysis of local wind statistics. As a result a possible mechanism for plankton retention is suggested. Pages: 1383 - 139...|$|R
