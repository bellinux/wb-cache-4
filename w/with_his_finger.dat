5|$|The Little Hero of Holland is a 1910 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. It is an adaptation of the short fictional story popularized in Hans Brinker, or The Silver Skates, about a boy who plugs a leaking dike <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> {{to prevent it from}} bursting. The role of the boy was played by Marie Eline, but little else is known about the production and cast of the film. The director may have been Barry O'Neil and the writer may have been Lloyd Lonergan. Parts of the film were shot on Glen Park Island in New Rochelle, New York. The film was released on June 17, 1910 and saw a wide release, including the United Kingdom. The film is presumed lost.|$|E

25|$|Sprinkling {{of blood}} in the Holy Standing in the Hekhal (Holy), {{on the other side of}} the Parochet from the Holy of Holies, the Kohen Gadol took the bull's blood from the stand and {{sprinkled}} it <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> eight times in the direction of the Parochet. He then took the bowl with the goat's blood and sprinkled it eight times in the same manner, putting it back on the stand.|$|E
25|$|Sprinkling of Bull's Blood in the Holy of Holies The Kohen Gadol {{took the}} bowl with the bull’s blood {{and entered the}} Most Holy Place again. He {{sprinkled}} the bull’s blood <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> eight times, before the Ark {{in the days of}} the First Temple, where it would have been {{in the days of the}} Second. The Kohen Gadol then left the Holy of Holies, putting the bowl on a stand in front of the Parochet (curtain separating the Holy from the Holy of Holies).|$|E
25|$|During the 2008 summer {{transfer}} window, recently promoted Premier League side Stoke City offered Cardiff £5m to sign Ledley, which Cardiff turned down. On 1 September 2008, {{the final}} day of the summer transfer window Stoke made a second bid, reported to be around £6m, but this too was firmly rejected by Cardiff. On 7 October, Ledley was named Welsh clubman of the year for the second consecutive year. He scored his first goal of the 2008–09 season during a 2–1 win over Crystal Palace on 15 November when he fired in after returning to the pitch after receiving treatment due to a dislocated finger. The injury later required surgery and Ledley was expected to be out for around one month but managed to return in time to play against Swansea City, <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> in a cast, in the first league meeting between the two sides for nine years and scored with a left footed volley as the game ended 2–2, a goal which later earned him the club's goal of the season award.|$|E

25|$|On {{the upper}} surface {{we have a}} {{depiction}} of the distressed Virgin Mary being supported by John the Evangelist and two female saints ("Pamoison de la Vierge"), Mary Magdalene and Mary Salome. In the next scene Jesus is being flogged by two soldiers who tighten the blindfold as they apply their whips. On the frieze below the first sculpture on the left shows Elizabeth (biblical figure) visiting the Virgin Mary (the Visitation (Christianity)), the one pregnant with Jesus Christ {{and the other with}} John the Baptist, this being followed by three scenes relating to the nativity. Firstly we see Saint Joseph sleeping in the stable with two cattle next to him. Then we see the Virgin Mary laying in a bed {{and at the end of}} this bed is a depiction of a standing Jesus aged about 7 years this followed by the Adoration of the Magi. The first wise man is kneeling before the bed whilst the second, dressed in the doublet worn in the reign of Charles VII, is pointing <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> to the star which led them to the stable and addressing the third wise man who is smaller in stature.|$|E

500|$|On {{the evening}} of March 5, Private Hugh White, a British soldier, stood on guard duty outside the Custom house on King Street, today known as State Street. A young wigmaker's {{apprentice}} named Edward Garrick called out to a British officer, Captain-Lieutenant John Goldfinch, that Goldfinch had not paid a bill due to Garrick's master. Goldfinch had in fact settled his account and ignored the insult. Private White called out to Garrick {{that he should be}} more respectful of the officer. Garrick exchanged insults with Private White. Then, after Garrick started poking the officer in the chest <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>finger,</b> the officer left his post, challenged the boy, and struck him {{on the side of the}} head with his musket. As Garrick cried in pain, one of his companions, Bartholomew Broaders, began to argue with White. This attracted a larger crowd. Henry Knox, a 19-year-old bookseller (who would later serve as a general in the revolution), came upon the scene and warned White, [...] "if he fired he must die for it." ...|$|E

500|$|Several {{factors have}} led to {{speculation}} that Webster was not alone when he killed Leigh. According to the transcript of Webster's confession, he was never asked if he acted alone. Carrington accused police of accepting Webster's confession at face value, ignoring both forensic and witness evidence. Her investigations highlighted several discrepancies in Webster's confession, and in the forensic evidence. For example, Webster stated in his confession that he had choked Leigh {{with his left hand}} as he knelt beside her although, according to the autopsy report, the bruises on Leigh's neck were consistent with being choked with a right hand. Carrington also questioned Webster's statement that he walked along lit streets {{to the other side of}} the Stockton peninsula to wash his bloodstained hands, when he could have washed his hands in total darkness at the beach less than [...] away. She also queried his claim that he had blood on his hands but none on his clothes, despite Leigh having been struck so hard blood was splattered 2.8 metres one way from her body and 1.3 metres the other way. Webster stated that he walked to the beach with Leigh, though according to police reports four witnesses said she walked to the beach alone; two witnesses stated they saw Webster and Wilson leave the surf club together. Neither NC1 nor Wilson had a reliable alibi for their whereabouts at the time of the murder; Wilson told police he was alone on the beach when Leigh walked past him as she left the club, minutes before she was murdered. Webster's statement that he only penetrated Leigh <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> has been considered by various sources to be inconsistent with the autopsy findings of genital trauma, and the trauma is also inconsistent with NC1's account that his sex with her was consensual. In reviewing the autopsy, Boettcher said that the numerous blows which killed Leigh came from multiple directions, and were probably inflicted with different items, indicating the possibility of more than one perpetrator.|$|E
500|$|For {{hundreds}} of years, abdominal gunshot wounds had meant death by gangrene or other infection, with doctors {{able to do}} little more than ease pain. [...] Only seventeen years previously, Dr. Emil Kocher, a Swiss surgeon, had been the first to successfully operate on a patient who had received such a wound. [...] To increase the lighting, sunlight was reflected onto the wound by another physician; {{towards the end of the}} surgery, a better light was rigged. [...] The hospital lacked basic surgical equipment such as retractors. [...] With McKinley in a weakened condition, Mann could do little probing of the wound to try to find the bullet; his work was complicated by the fact that the President was obese. [...] The surgeon made an incision in the President's skin, and found and removed a small piece of cloth which was embedded in the flesh. [...] He probed <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> and hand, finding damage to the digestive system—the stomach displayed both an entry and exit wound. [...] Mann sewed up both holes in the organ, but could not find the bullet itself; he concluded it had lodged in the President's back muscles. [...] He later wrote, [...] "A bullet once it ceases to move does little harm." [...] A primitive X-ray machine was on display at the fair but was not used on McKinley; Mann later stated that its use might have disturbed the patient and done little good. [...] He used black silk thread to stitch the incision and wound, without drainage, and covered the area with a bandage. [...] As the operation concluded, Dr. Park arrived from Niagara Falls; he was unwilling to interfere and at 5:20, McKinley was given another shot of painkiller and allowed to awaken. [...] He was taken to the Milburn House by the electric ambulance. [...] The First Lady had not been told of the President's shooting; once the surgery was complete, the presidential physician, Presley M. Rixey, gently told her what had occurred. [...] Ida McKinley took the news calmly; she wrote in her diary, [...] "Went to Niagra [...] Falls this morning. [...] My Dearest was receiving in a public hall on our return, when he was shot by a ... Leech, in her biography of President McKinley, suggests that the First Lady could not write the word, [...] "anarchist".|$|E

2500|$|Skinner took up {{the task}} of {{developing}} a suitable crystal detector, which essentially consisted of endless trials of different crystals; Lovell noted that [...] "an abiding memory of the days at Worth and Leeson is of Skinner, cigarette drooping from his mouth, totally absorbed in the endless tapping of a crystal <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> until the whisker found the sensitive spot giving the best characteristics." [...] This led {{to the use of}} a tungsten whisker on silicon glass, sealed into a wax-filled glass tube. Oliphant's team in Birmingham continued these experiments and developed a capsule-sealed version.|$|E

2500|$|Despite {{the best}} hopes of Cleveland's {{management}} and Francis J. Powers, the trade {{proved to be}} disastrous for the Indians. [...] Tavener started only 67 games at shortstop in 1929, losing the starting job to rookie Ray Gardner. [...] And far from hitting [...]300 at Dunn Field, Tavener compiled a career low batting average of [...]212, 50 points lower than Tavener had averaged at Detroit. [...] Tavener appeared in his final major league game on October 6, 1929. [...] Detroit sports writer Sam Greene opined that Tavener's decline actually began <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> injury in 1927: [...] "The fact remains, however, that Tavener never regained the fielding and all-around skill he had known prior to the accident." ...|$|E
