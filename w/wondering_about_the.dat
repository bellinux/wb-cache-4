5|$|After the Fountain is {{destroyed}} and the Circle defeated, Sahin returns to Turkey, and Lizzie, {{with all her}} Spanish gold sunk {{to the bottom of}} the lake, leaves for the Caribbean: however, it is ambiguously stated that she and Morgan reunited several years later and a romance eventually blossomed between them, implying that she was the mother of Morgan's children, making her also an ancestor of all future Blacks featured in the campaign. Morgan is last seen <b>wondering</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> significance of the Fountain and whether it really was the Fountain of Youth, and is seen refilling his empty canteen from the water of the lake.|$|E
25|$|While {{thinking}} of {{an approach that}} would appeal to an audience outside of rock music, and <b>wondering</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> nature of pop music, Yamaguchi thought of the music of German composer Johann Sebastian Bach as something that transcended time and genre. Yamaguchi wrote the song as a documentary of the specific feelings that he had when listening to Bach at night time. He wrote the song as a love song, inspired by everyday things. The imagery in the song was inspired by music interacting with the brain of someone falling asleep, creating mixed-up dreams.|$|E
25|$|According to his successor, Dr Meek, Mr M’Culloch {{had been}} in the habit of preaching out of doors, in the nearby gorge, because of the poor repair of the church. It was here, after sermon, that he shared the letters and written sermons he {{received}} from New England. Towards the end of January 1742, two men, Ingram More, a shoemaker, and Robert Bowman, a weaver, went through the parish, and got about 90 heads of families to sign a petition to the minister, asking that he give them a weekly lecture. Thursday evening was set for this. The first two lectures passed off as expected, and only a few persons came back to the manse for further prayer and discussion. However, on Monday 15 February, all the Fellowships in the parish turned up at the manse and spent several days praying and discussing and <b>wondering</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> great events that were being reported from England and America.|$|E

500|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{inclusion}} of LGBT issues attract media attention, {{in which the}} hype makes some fans and creators uncomfortable. [...] Podcaster Faust points out for example, that gay marriage in a comic issue is treated almost as an “event”, when that series had already been significant with openly gay characters. Lobdell, while <b>wondering</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> attention media gives gay characters, hopes that in the near future, they will not “make the news at all, because they are as common as capes and cowls.” ...|$|E
500|$|McEwan's {{earlier work}} has {{explored}} {{the fragility of}} existence using a clinical perspective, Hitchens hails him a [...] "chronicler of the physics of every-day life". Saturday explores the feeling of fulfilment in Perowne: he is respected and respectable but not quite at ease, <b>wondering</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> luck that has him where he is and others homeless or in menial jobs. The family is materially well-off, with a plush home and a Mercedes, but justifiably so—Perowne and his wife work hard. McEwan tells of his success rate and keeping cool under pressure; there is a trade off, {{as he and his}} wife work long hours and need to put their diaries side by side to find time to spend together.|$|E
500|$|The Liberals {{concluded}} {{their campaign}} {{with a large}} rally at Toronto's Maple Leaf Gardens on June 7. Entertainment at the event {{was provided by the}} Leslie Bell singers, and according to Grosart, many in the audience were Tory supporters who had turned out to hear them. St. Laurent's speech at the rally was interrupted when William Hatton, a 15-year-old boy from Malton, Ontario, climbed onto the platform. Hatton carried a banner reading, [...] "This Can't Be Canada" [...] with a Liberal placard bearing St. Laurent's photograph, and moved to face the Prime Minister. Meisel describes Hatton as an [...] "otherwise politically apathetic boy who... slowly and deliberately tore up a photograph of the Prime Minister as the latter was speaking" [...] and states that Hatton engaged in [...] "intensely provocative behavior". Liberal partisans interceded, and in the ensuing fracas, Hatton fell from the platform, audibly hitting his head on the concrete floor. St. Laurent watched in apparent shock, according to his biographer Dale Tompson, as officials aided the boy and took him from the hall. According to Tompson, the crowd [...] "turned its indignation on the men on the platform" [...] and spent the remainder of the evening <b>wondering</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> boy's possible injuries rather than listening to the Prime Minister's speech. Hatton was not seriously injured, but, according to Newman, [...] "the accident added to the image of the Liberal Party as an unrepentant arrogant group of old men, willing to ride roughshod over voters". Grosart later described the incident as [...] "the turning point" [...] of the campaign. Professor Meisel speculated that the Hatton incident might have been part of an organized campaign to annoy St. Laurent out of his pleasant [...] "Uncle Louis" [...] persona, and Grosart later related that Liberal frontbencher Jack Pickersgill always accused him of being behind the boy's actions, but that the incident was [...] "a sheer accident". Hatton's mother described his actions as [...] "ust a schoolboy prank," [...] and a reaction to reading an article about how the art of heckling was dying. According to public relations executive J.G. Johnston in a letter to Diefenbaker on June 10, Hatton had come to the rally with several other boys, including Johnston's son, but had gone off on his own while the other boys paraded with Diefenbaker posters which had been smuggled inside. According to Johnston, Hatton was caught on CBC tape saying to St. Laurent, [...] "I can no longer stand your hypocrisy, Sir" [...] before tearing the St. Laurent poster. Attempts by Johnston to have the Liberal activist who pushed Hatton off the platform arrested failed, according to Johnston, on the ground that the police could find no witnesses.|$|E
60|$|Then came a reaction. His vital forces rose again. He {{no longer}} felt fearful, he only {{wondered}} with a strange impersonal wonder, as a man <b>wonders</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> vital affairs of another. Then from <b>wondering</b> <b>about</b> himself he began to <b>wonder</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> girl who sat opposite to him. With the rain came a little lightning, and by the first flash he saw her clearly. Her beautiful face was set, and as she bent forward searching the darkness with her wide eyes, it wore, he thought, an almost defiant air.|$|R

60|$|To little Owen it was chiefly that papa {{was gone}} 'up there' whither all his hymns and allegories pointed, {{and at his}} age, all {{that he did not}} {{actually}} see was much on a par; the hope of meeting had been too distant for the extinction of it to affect him very nearly, and he only understood enough to prompt the prettiest and most touching sayings, <b>wondering</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> doings of papa, mamma, and little baby among the angels, with as much reality as he had formerly talked of papa among the French.|$|E

Perhaps, behind that drawn blind, Louise herself was awake. Perhaps she was thinking, looking back into the past, <b>wondering</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> future. He took a step toward the gate.|$|E

60|$|It was {{not because}} of Olney, {{but in spite of}} Ruth, and his love for Ruth, that he finally decided not to take up Latin. His money meant time.

Twoscore of manuscripts were travelling the endless round of the magazines. How did the others do it? He spent long hours in the free reading-room, going over what others had written, studying their work eagerly and critically, comparing it with his own, and wondering, <b>wondering,</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> secret trick they had discovered which enabled them to sell their work.|$|E
