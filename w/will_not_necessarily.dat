25|$|Dentures {{that fit}} well {{during the first}} few years after {{creation}} <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> fit well {{for the rest of the}} wearer's lifetime. This is because the bone and mucosa of the mouth are living tissues, which are dynamic over decades. Bone remodeling never stops in living bone. Edentulous jaw ridges tend to resorb progressively over the years, especially the alveolar ridge of the lower jaw. Mucosa reacts to being chronically rubbed by the dentures. Poorly fitting dentures hasten both of those processes compared to the rates with well-fitting dentures. Poor fitting dentures may also lead to the development of conditions such as epulis fissuratum.|$|E
25|$|The {{language}} of adoption is changing and evolving, {{and since the}} 1970s has been a controversial issue tied closely to adoption reform efforts. The controversy arises {{over the use of}} terms which, while designed to be more appealing or less offensive to some persons affected by adoption, may simultaneously cause offense or insult to others. This controversy illustrates the problems in adoption, as well as the fact that coining new words and phrases to describe ancient social practices <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> alter the feelings and experiences of those affected by them. Two of the contrasting sets of terms are commonly referred to as positive adoption language (PAL) (sometimes called respectful adoption language (RAL)), and honest adoption language (HAL).|$|E

25|$|Some Salticidae specialise in {{particular}} classes of prey. Ants comprise one such class. Most spiders, including most salticids, avoid worker ants, but several species not only eat {{them as a}} primary item in their diets, but also employ specialised attack techniques — Corythalia canosa for example, circles round {{to the front of}} the ant and grabs it over the back of its head. Such myrmecophagous species, however, <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> refuse other prey items, and will routinely catch flies and similar prey in the usual salticid fashion, without the special precautions they apply in hunting dangerous prey such as ants. Ants offer the advantages of being plentiful prey items for which there is little competition from other predators, but it remains profitable to catch less hazardous prey when it presents itself.|$|E
25|$|Historically, the {{euthanasia}} {{debate has}} {{tended to focus on}} a number of key concerns. According to euthanasia opponent Ezekiel Emanuel, proponents of euthanasia have presented four main arguments: a) that {{people have a right to}} self-determination, and thus should be allowed to choose their own fate; b) assisting a subject to die might be a better choice than requiring that they continue to suffer; c) the distinction between passive euthanasia, which is often permitted, and active euthanasia, which is not substantive (or that the underlying principle–the doctrine of double effect–is unreasonable or unsound); and d) permitting euthanasia <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> lead to unacceptable consequences. Pro-euthanasia activists often point to countries like the Netherlands and Belgium, and states like Oregon, where euthanasia has been legalized, to argue that it is mostly unproblematic.|$|E
25|$|Bar-Yosef and Cohen {{suggest that}} the success of hominins within Eurasia once out of Africa is in part due to the absence of {{zoonotic}} diseases outside their original habitat. Zoonotic diseases are those that are transmitted from animals to humans. While a disease specific to hominins must keep its human host alive long enough to transmit itself, zoonotic diseases <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> do so as they can complete their life cycle without humans. Still, these infections are well accustomed to human presence, having evolved alongside them. The higher an African ape's population density, the better a disease fares. 55% of chimps at the Gombe reserve die of disease, most of them zoonotic. The majority of these diseases are still restricted to hot and damp African environments. Once hominins had moved out into drier and colder habitats of higher latitudes, one major limiting factor in population growth was out of the equation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Collisions are {{a source}} of {{inefficiency}} in contention-based MAC protocols that should be reduced to a minimum. We show that concurrent multiple access to a communication channel <b>will,</b> however, <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> lead to a collision with undesirable effects. Rather, we demonstrate that it is possible for a receiver to hear the bitwise “or ” of the transmissions of multiple synchronized senders within communication range. This unconventional communication model allows the efficient implementation of a number of basic operations that serve as a foundation for BitMAC: a deterministic, collision-free, and robust MAC protocol that is tailored to dense sensor networks, where nodes report sensory data over multiple hops to a sink.

25|$|The use {{of active}} sonar by a {{submarine}} to determine bearing is extremely rare and <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> give high quality bearing or range {{information to the}} submarines fire control team. However, use of active sonar on surface ships is very common and is used by submarines when the tactical situation dictates {{it is more important}} to determine the position of a hostile submarine than conceal their own position. With surface ships, it might be assumed that the threat is already tracking the ship with satellite data as any vessel around the emitting sonar will detect the emission. Having heard the signal, it is easy to identify the sonar equipment used (usually with its frequency) and its position (with the sound wave's energy). Active sonar is similar to radar in that, while it allows detection of targets at a certain range, it also enables the emitter to be detected at a far greater range, which is undesirable.|$|E
25|$|The core {{distinction}} between the United States Bill of Rights and Canadian Charter is {{the existence of the}} limitations and notwithstanding clauses. Canadian courts have consequently interpreted each right more expansively. However, due to the limitations clause, where a violation of a right exists, the law <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> grant protection of that right. In contrast, rights under the US Bill of Rights are absolute and so a violation will not be found until there has been sufficient encroachment on those rights. The sum effect is that both constitutions provide comparable protection of many rights. Fundamental justice (in section 7 of the Canadian Charter) is therefore interpreted to include more legal protections than due process, which is its US equivalent. Freedom of expression in section 2 also has a more wide-ranging scope than the First Amendment to the United States Constitution's freedom of speech. In RWDSU v. Dolphin Delivery Ltd. (1986), the Canadian Supreme Court considered picketing of the kind the US First Amendment did not permit, as it was disruptive conduct (though there was some speech involved that the First Amendment might otherwise protect). The Supreme Court, however, ruled the picketing, including the disruptive conduct, were fully protected under section 2 of the Charter. The Court then relied on section 1 to find the injunction against the picketing was just. The limitations clause has also allowed governments to enact laws that would be considered unconstitutional in the US. The Supreme Court of Canada has upheld some of Quebec's limits on the use of English on signs and has upheld publication bans that prohibit media from mentioning the names of juvenile criminals.|$|E
500|$|Another {{distance}} measure {{commonly used}} in agglomerative clustering is {{the distance between the}} centroids of pairs of clusters, also known as the weighted group method. It can be calculated easily in constant time per distance calculation. However, it is not reducible. For instance, if the input forms the set of three points of an equilateral triangle, merging two of these points into a larger cluster causes the inter-cluster distance to decrease, a violation of reducibility. Therefore, the nearest-neighbor chain algorithm <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> find the same clustering as the greedy algorithm. Nevertheless, [...] writes that the nearest-neighbor chain algorithm provides [...] "a good heuristic" [...] for the centroid method.|$|E
