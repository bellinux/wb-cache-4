25|$|When the Eisenhower Administration {{took office}} {{one of its}} first {{objectives}} was to riddle the tax code with favors for big business and it did so {{with the help of}} the Senator from Massachusetts. We need a candidate who will reverse the big money and big business domination of government. We need a courageous candidate who will stand up and fight the necessary political battle for the welfare of the average American. Kennedy has never been <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that.</b>|$|E
2500|$|On March 4, 1998, Hank {{dressed in}} a pink rabbit suit, took a {{succession}} of phone calls from Stern listeners, sang karaoke to Led Zeppelin songs, and blew a [...]375 on a breathalyzer test. During another appearance dressed in the same costume, Hank made a visit to illusionist David Blaine, who was encased in a large block of ice outside {{on the street in}} New York City. [...] Speaking to Hank remotely, Stern wanted Hank to urinate on the ice. [...] Hank wasn't <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> but he did give Blaine the finger.|$|E

60|$|So it {{was with}} Sir Launcelot at that time; for though he ever <b>willed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> which was right, yet his desires ever called to him to depart from the paths of honor and truth in which he walked, {{and so he was}} oftentimes much troubled in his spirit.|$|R
6000|$|... "But I {{will take}} it from him; it is a terrible {{emergency}} and the act is thereby justified. And {{if it were not}} so, who <b>will</b> give law <b>to</b> the Church? The Church giveth law to all; and what she <b>wills</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> <b>that</b> she may <b>do,</b> hurt whom it may. I {{will take it}} from him; you shall begin upon the moment." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then, {{since you}} heard what Sproatly said, you would be <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{anything}} <b>that</b> appeared possible to prevent Gregory throwing Harry's dollars away?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm sure I'm <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> Jack." [...] And {{then the}} girl added quickly: [...] "You've had some terrible doings {{over at the}} Hall, so I have been told." ...|$|E
60|$|GAYNOR. Well, perhaps I {{can get the}} Society to pay {{half for}} your daughter--if you're really as hard up as you pretend. They're <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> where it seems necessary.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't think so. If {{they were}} <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> {{my father would}} put the deal through without delay. It {{certainly}} is too bad!" [...] added Phil, with a sigh.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said I, [...] "but {{you spend}} so much of your time in {{thinking}} how glad you <b>will</b> be <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> little, when it is <b>to</b> be <b>done,</b> <b>that</b> you can't give me any attention, at all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{tell you}} what I'll do, Songbird. If you wish me to, I'll call on Mr. Sanderson and tell him what we are <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> so <b>that</b> he can rest easy about paying the {{mortgage}} off if he has to." ...|$|R
60|$|Well, {{now that}} the unfortunate thing has been done, let us {{do what we can}} to undo it. There must be a way, M. Bourget, and I am <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{anything}} <b>that</b> <b>will</b> help; for I am as sorry as you can be yourself.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I {{never thought}} before of giving any {{thing to the}} poor but what they really needed, and I have always been <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> when I could without going far out of my way." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{others were}} {{perfectly}} <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> and the rowboat and the canoe were {{turned over to}} Ham, Spink and his cronies. Then our friends rowed out into the lake and [...] "hung around" [...] until the others loaded their craft and started away.|$|E

60|$|For {{indeed it}} is so that the will of a man is but a poor weak defence against the {{thoughts}} that arise within a stubborn heart. For, though a man may <b>will</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> which is right, yet may his thoughts ever turn to that which is wrong; and though he may refrain from doing wrong, yet it is {{in spite of his}} desirings that he thus refraineth. Yea; there is no help for a man to contain himself within the bounds of duty, save only that he hath the love of God within his heart. For only when his feet are planted upon that rock may he hope to withstand the powerful thoughts <b>that</b> urge him <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> which is wrong.|$|R
60|$|When Senor Sagasta {{returned}} to his beautiful villa, in the afternoon, his daughter at once confided to him what had happened. He entered warmly into her scheme for the aid and protection of the lads, and expressed himself <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> anything <b>that</b> she could suggest.|$|R

60|$|Ellen laughed--she {{could not}} help it--and her {{laughing}} made it less possible than before for Breckon to unbend and meet Trannel on his own ground, to give him joke for joke, to exchange banter with him. He might never have been <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> but now he shrank from it, in his realization of their likeness, with an abhorrence that rendered him rigid.|$|E
60|$|Up Broadway Chandler {{moved with}} the vespertine dress parade. For this evening {{he was an}} exhibit {{as well as a}} gazer. For the next sixty-nine evenings he would be dining in cheviot and worsted at dubious table d'hôtes, at {{whirlwind}} lunch counters, on sandwiches and beer in his hall-bedroom. He was <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> for he was a true son of the great city of razzle-dazzle, and to him one evening in the limelight made up for many dark ones.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{want any}} feller to think I came here 'cause I'm fond of fight. Skip Jellison has said I've {{got to leave}} town, and that Carrots must, too, just because he helped me. He tried to drive me away by {{stealing}} a dollar of my money from Carrots, and then he set the box pile on fire last night to smoke us out, or something worse. All I want of him is {{to give up the}} cash, and agree to let us alone. If he's <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> there's no need of this row; but if he don't, I shall fight him the best I know how." ...|$|E

50|$|Social entrepreneurship, {{like social}} enterprise, is {{typically}} in the nonprofit sector excluding both for-profit and public organizations. Both social entrepreneurship and social enterprise are important contributions to social innovation by creating social value and introducing {{new ways of}} achieving goals.

6000|$|... "I surely {{ought to}} be <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> much for my fellow creatures, Joseph, even though I get nothing in return; but I can't say it won't be a trial {{for me to have}} two boys around the house after I've lived alone so long. Martha, Mary, and I took care of this place, {{with the help of a}} man in summer, a good many years after our parents died, and I suppose we got fussy and old-maidish-like in our ways," [...] aunt Dorcas said, growing reminiscent.

6000|$|DEAR MR. ANN,--Upon sober second thought, it won't do!--I {{withdraw}} that letter. Not because I {{said anything}} in it {{which is not}} true, for I didn't; but because when I allow my name {{to be used in}} forwarding a stock-scheme I am assuming a certain degree of responsibility as toward the investor, and I am not <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> I have another objection, a purely selfish one: trading upon my name, whether the enterprise scored a success or a failure would damage me. I can't afford that; even the Archbishop of Canterbury couldn't afford it, and he has more character to spare than I have. (Ah, a happy thought! If he would sign the letter with me that would change the whole complexion of the thing, of course. I do not know him, yet I would sign any commercial scheme that he would sign. As he does not know me, it follows that he would sign anything that I would sign. This is unassailable logic--but really that is all that can be said for it.) ...|$|E
60|$|Gallwey {{excused himself}} in another minute or two, and Carrie, who {{went back to}} the house, spent the {{afternoon}} lying in a big chair by the stove with a book, of which she read but little. From what she had heard, it was evident that Leland was selling his wheat and cattle at a sacrifice, which, she could understand, he would naturally not have done, could he have helped it. The reflection was not exactly a pleasant one, for though Branscombe Denham had carefully refrained from mentioning to what agreement he and Leland had come, she was, of course, aware that her marriage had relieved him from some, at least, of his financial difficulties. After all, though she had sacrificed herself for him, she could not think highly of her father, and the fact that her husband had been thus compelled to strip himself was painful to contemplate. It placed her under a heavy obligation to Leland, and there was so little she could do, or, at least, was <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> <b>that</b> would free her of it.|$|E
5000|$|Mainstream {{opinion in}} this country will be {{offended}} {{by some of the}} statements that they have heard made. At the same time, of course, the courts make their judgements on these things.

60|$|That hadn't been {{a social}} relation; and truly, deep within his appeal to {{himself to be}} remarkable, to be imperturbable and impenetrable, to be in fact quite {{incomparable}} now, throbbed the intense vision of his drawing out and draining dry the sensation {{he had begun to}} taste. He would do it, moreover--that would be the refinement of his art--not only without the betraying anxiety of a single question, but just even by seeing her flounder (since she must, in a vagueness deeply disconcerting to her) as to her real effect on him. She was distinctly floundering {{by the time he had}} brought her--it had taken ten minutes--down to a consciousness of absurd and twaddling topics, to the reported precarious state, for instance, of the syndicate running the Bijou Theatre at the Pierhead--all as an admonition that she might want him to want to know why she was thus waiting on him, might want it for all she was worth, before he had ceased to be so remarkable as not to ask her. He didn't--and this assuredly was wondrous enough--want to do anything worse to her than let her flounder; but he was <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> so long as it mightn't prevent his seeing at least where he was. He seemed still to see where he was even at the minute that followed her final break-off, clearly intended to be resolute, from make-believe talk.|$|E
60|$|But {{there are}} women of the class to which Madame Staubach belonged who think that the acerbities of {{religion}} are intended altogether for their own sex. That men ought to be grateful to them who will deny? Such women {{seem to think that}} Heaven will pardon that hardness of heart which it has created in man, and which the affairs of the world seem almost to require; but that it will extend no such forgiveness to the feminine creation. It may be necessary that a man should be stiff-necked, self-willed, eager on the world, perhaps even covetous and given to worldly lusts. But for a woman, it behoves her to crush herself, so that she may be at all points submissive, self-denying, and much-suffering. She should be used to thorns in the flesh, and to thorns in the spirit too. Whatever may be the thing she wants, that thing she should not have. And if it be so that, in her feminine weakness, she be not able to deny herself, there should be those around her to do the denial for her. Let her crush herself as it becomes a poor female to do, or let there be some other female to crush her if she lack the strength, the purity, and the religious fervour which such self-crushing requires. Poor Linda Tressel had not much taste for crushing herself, but Providence had supplied her with one who had always been <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> work for her. And yet the aunt had ever dearly loved her niece, and dearly loved her now in these days of our story. If your eye offend you, shall you not pluck it out? After a sort Madame Staubach was plucking out her own eye when she led her niece such a life of torment as will be described in these pages.|$|E
