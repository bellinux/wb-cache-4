5|$|Absolutely. There's a {{song called}} 'Army of Me,' {{which is sort of}} a 'Fighter 2.0.' There is a new {{generation}} of fans from a younger demographic that might not have been <b>with</b> <b>me</b> <b>all</b> the way but that watch me on the show now. I feel like every generation should be able to enjoy and have their piece of 'Fighter' within. This time, the way it musically came together it just felt right for this time and this generation. There's {{always going to be a}} fighter in me getting through some obstacle and some hurdle. All these 6-year-olds who know me from pushing my button and turning around in a big red chair who weren't around for the actual 'Fighter,' this is my chance to recharge it, rejuvenate it and do something modernized for them.|$|E
500|$|Lytle {{also stated}} that he was [...] "burnt out on touring" [...] and cited his fears over his drug and alcohol {{problems}} {{as a factor in}} the band's split, and in 2009 he expressed his preference for being solo, saying that he was [...] "a bit of a loner", and, referring to his former bandmates, stated: [...] "The main thing is not having four girlfriends to lug around <b>with</b> <b>me</b> <b>all</b> the time." ...|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} Amichai said: [...] "Little Ruth is my Anne Frank", [...] "I {{found out that}} she (Little Ruth) was in the last transport in 1944. This knowledge goes <b>with</b> <b>me</b> <b>all</b> the time, not because of guilt." [...] "If there is any guilty feeling it's like the guilt that soldiers feel when they survive the battle while their friends were killed".|$|E
2500|$|In late 2007 Channel 4 {{announced}} on their website {{that they would}} be producing a fourth series for 2008 and issued an appeal for contestants living in Bath, Newcastle, Oxford, Exeter, the Fylde Coast, and Shropshire. [...] Unlike previous series it would be aired in primetime and only feature four guests so that it could be aired as a single weekly hour-long episode. It is alternately titled [...] "Come Dine <b>with</b> <b>Me</b> <b>All</b> in One" [...] (as it is listed on the Channel 4 website).|$|E

2500|$|Orbison {{attributed}} his own passion {{during his}} performances {{to the period}} when {{he grew up in}} Fort Worth while the US was mobilizing for World War II. His parents worked in a defense plant and his father would bring a guitar in the evenings and their friends and relatives who had just joined the military would gather, and drink and sing heartily. Orbison later reflected, [...] "I guess that level of intensity made a big impression on me, because it's still there. That sense of 'do it for all it's worth and do it now and do it good.' Not to analyze it too much, but I think the verve and gusto that everybody felt and portrayed around me has stayed <b>with</b> <b>me</b> <b>all</b> this time." ...|$|E
2500|$|In self-analysis, Jackson {{uncovered}} vital details regarding her past, saying, [...] "Certain {{things may}} happen, {{and you just}} dismiss them instead of stopping and saying, [...] "Why am I feeling this way? Why am I acting out in this way?" [...] She had suppressed various traumas throughout her adolescence and early adulthood, using evasion tactics to prevent thoughts from surfacing. She also recalled feeling unaccepted and ostracized for her skin color. She was persistently haunted by a memory of a school teacher intensely scolding her, causing her classmates to erupt in laughter. [...] "Oh, God, it sounds so stupid. But being a kid you're just so frightened... I never talked about it, so it stayed <b>with</b> <b>me</b> <b>all</b> those years. I felt not deserving, not good enough... that's still the way I feel about myself sometimes", she declared. As a child, she managed discomfort by speaking to her animals, later turning to overeating as an anesthetic, causing fluctuations in weight. Jackson said, [...] "I {{began to realize that}} whenever something really painful was going on, I would eat, and that's how I would run away from it. But I would just be creating another problem in another area instead of just dealing with that pain".|$|E
2500|$|Of {{the works}} {{recorded}} by Capitol Records, [...] "Incident in Jazz" [...] {{is probably the}} most compositionally unified of Graettinger's and shows his full capabilities as an orchestral writer in progressive jazz or as a Third stream music composer (the work was originally entitled [...] "Incident in Sound"). [...] This is part of the new [...] "Innovations" [...] orchestra that Stan Kenton had marshalled into the studio to record these groundbreaking sides. Kenton comments on the unprecedented conditions this orchestra operated under, [...] "The Capitol people were <b>with</b> <b>me</b> <b>all</b> the way. There were tremendous sums of money involved in recording this orchestra and selling the music that was of such an unusual nature. I remember hour upon hour in the studio while we were recording, and there was no thought of how much it would cost: the thought was only to make the finest recordings that we knew how." [...] The largesse of Capitol Records and Kenton himself would only last (roughly) six months until a more conventional, financially solvent Kenton 'dance' orchestra would be reformed to cut sides with the popular Capitol artist Nat King Cole. Graettinger's [...] "House of Strings" [...] (Aug 24, 1950) is recorded on a split session with popular Les Baxter sides; the Kenton 'Innovations Orchestra' as a regular touring and studio unit had come and gone quickly due to financial failure.|$|E
