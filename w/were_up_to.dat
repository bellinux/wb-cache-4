5|$|In 1943, the 4th Parachute Brigade, {{although}} {{still part of}} the 1st Airborne Division, was {{kept out of the}} Allied invasion of Sicily by a shortage of transport aircraft. The 1st Airlanding Brigade took part in Operation Ladbroke and the 1st Parachute Brigade in Operation Fustian. Both brigades suffered heavy casualties, so that by the time Operation Slapstick was proposed, only the 2nd and 4th Parachute Brigades <b>were</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> strength. Slapstick was in part a deception operation to divert German forces from the main Allied landings and also an attempt to seize intact the Italian ports of Taranto, Bari and Brindisi.|$|E

5|$|According to a rough estimation, as of 2010 there <b>were</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 300,000 Swedish-speakers {{living outside}} Sweden and Finland. The largest populations {{were in the}} United States (up to 100,000), the UK, Spain and Germany (c. 30,000 each) and a large {{proportion}} of the remaining 100,000 in the Scandinavian countries, France, Switzerland, Belgium, the Netherlands, Canada and Australia. A considerable majority of Swedish residents born outside Sweden (c. 1.5 million) speak Swedish and according to the ELDIA Project, there were c. 2,390,000 second-language speakers in Finland. According to a survey by the European Commission, 44% of respondents from Finland who did not have Swedish as a native language considered themselves to be proficient enough in Swedish to hold a conversation, for a total of about 5 million second-language speakers. The total number of native speakers could be up to 8.6 million with an additional 4–5 million second language speakers in Sweden and Finland. Due to the close relation between the Scandinavian languages, a considerable proportion of speakers of Danish and especially Norwegian are highly fluent in Swedish for a total number of speakers that could be as high as 15 million.|$|E
5|$|As previous, the Swedish {{authorities}} {{continued to}} subsidize freight operations on their side, making it profitable for Swedish exports to go via the Baltic Sea. Hopes in Trondheim {{to act as}} a major transit port for Swedish cargo never materialized. The 1966 opening of Norske Skog Skogn paper mill saw an increase in transport of lumber from Sweden. The petroleum transport lasted until the 1980s, when the Muruvik terminal was sold to Norwegian interests. A major customer was still Meråker Smelteverk, who used designated trains to haul ore from Muruvik to Kopperå and microsilica in return. By 1980, cargo volumes <b>were</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the level seen during World War I.|$|E
5|$|By early 2016, delays as {{a result}} of {{overcrowding}} <b>were</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> more than 20,000 every month, four times the amount in 2012. The overcrowded trains have resulted in an increase of assaults because of tense commuters. With less platform space, more passengers are forced to be {{on the edge of the}} platform resulting in the increased possibility of passengers falling on the track. One possible solution that the MTA is considering is platform screen doors, which exist on the AirTrain JFK to prevent passengers from falling onto the tracks. In order to prevent hitting passengers who could fall onto the tracks, train operators are being instructed to go into stations at lower speeds. The increased proximity of riders could result in the spread of contagious diseases.|$|E

5|$|Founded in 1891, the Society for the {{improvement}} of New Forest Ponies organised a stallion show and offered financial incentives to encourage owners of good stallions to run them on the Forest. In 1905 the Burley and District NF Pony Breeding and Cattle Society was set up to start the stud book and organise the Breed Show; the two societies merged in 1937 to form the New Forest Pony Breeding and Cattle Society. Overall numbers of livestock grazing the Forest, including ponies, tended to decline in the early twentieth century; in 1945 there were just 571 ponies depastured. By 1956 the number of ponies of all breeds on the Forest had more than doubled to 1,341. Twenty years later pony numbers <b>were</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 3,589, rising to 4,112 in 1994, before dipping back below four thousand until 2005. As of 2011, there were 4,604 ponies grazing on the New Forest.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, there <b>were</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 150,000 Assyrian Christians; {{most are}} Eastern Aramaic {{speaking}} refugees from Iraq.

Descendants of Armenians that sought refuge in the Levant during the 1915 Armenian Genocide number approximately 5,000 persons, mainly residing in Amman. A small number of ethnic Mandeans also reside in Jordan, again mainly refugees from Iraq. Around 12,000 Iraqi Christians have sought refuge in Jordan after the Islamic State took the city of Mosul in 2014. Several thousand Libyans, Yemenis and Sudanese have also sought asylum in Jordan to escape instability and violence in their respective countries. The 2015 Jordanian census recorded that there were 1,265,000 Syrians, 636,270 Egyptians, 634,182 Palestinians, 130,911 Iraqis, 31,163 Yemenis, 22,700 Libyans and 197,385 from other nationalities residing in the country.|$|E
5|$|In November 1991, the Ministry of the Interior {{redefined the}} {{organisation}} {{of the special}} police force, retaining a few units under direct control of the ministry and assigning others to county police administrations. The move was devised {{in response to the}} advance of the JNA. The scheme included the establishment of an SPU in each of the 20 county police administrations. At the time, there <b>were</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 19 such SPUs. Under the scheme, the Karlovac, Gospić, Osijek, Slavonski Brod and Zagreb SPUs were planned to have 180 troops each. The Rijeka, Sisak, Bjelovar and Šibenik SPUs were scheduled to comprise 150 troops each, while the Split, Zadar, Kutina, Vinkovci, Županja and Vukovar SPUs were planned as 120-strong units. The smallest, 100-strong units were to be based in Pula, Varaždin, Zabok and Dubrovnik. Overall, the scheme called for 2,620 active special police troops in the regionally organised units alone, and defined that each of the units should have a matching number of reserve troops.|$|E

5|$|It {{had become}} {{apparent}} in around 1987 {{that a number}} of units already in the field were not up to specification. In particular, it was becoming increasingly difficult to obtain KEF drivers of acceptable tolerances, particular the woofer. Measurements of the 1–1.5kHz peak of some units produced at the time <b>were</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 6dB higher. KEF underwent a program to improve consistency of both drive-unit and the associated crossover, taking care not to alter frequency characteristics or tonal balances. KEF specially redesigned the B110, creating the B110 SP1228 where the surround changed from neoprene to a vinyl compound. KEF also designed a new crossover, designated SP2128. The crossover, also redesigned to accommodate the changes, saw its overall impedance fall to 11 ohms from the original 15 ohms. KEF also manufactured and supplied the crossover with the drive units in kits where the pairs have been electrically matched by computer to ensure balanced performance. Martin Colloms had implied in Hi-fi News in August 1988 that the BBC had taken a pragmatic decision to a revise the design, to ensure that targeted production levels could be maintained.|$|E
5|$|On 17 December 1997, NSB's board {{decided to}} {{purchase}} eleven of the locomotives, excluding number 664. This {{was based on}} an agreement whereby NSB would receive compensation for the incurred losses owing to late delivery and under-performance. Siemens guaranteed that ten of eleven locomotives would be operational at any time. All units were again grounded in January 1998, following two fires. Siemens had between 15 and 20 employees stationed in Trondheim to fix the issues. Regularity on the Nordland Line plummeted from 67 to 46 percent with the introduction of Di6. NSB was forced to keep 15 Di3s, which <b>were</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 42 years old, in operational condition to keep services running. The extra costs of keeping the Di3s running were about NOK50 million per year. These costs would continue until NSB could take delivery of new locomotives, which could take up to three years from the time of order. One contributing factor was a 25percent extra wage for engineers for having above-regulation noise levels in the Di3 cabs. Two Di3s were often run along with a Di6 in a train as backup; should the Di6 fail, the Di3 would continue hauling the train.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{shortening}} of {{the main}} Bergen Line railway with the Ulriken Tunnel, the Bergen–Nesttun Line was an important commuter rail service, feeding suburban residents from Fana into the city center. In 1917, the section was the most heavily trafficked railway in the country, with a travel time between 20 and 27 minutes. There <b>were</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 27 trains per day, of which five continued to Garnes. In 1918, the line was proposed for doubling and electrification: the latter was completed in 1954. The same year, annual ridership were down to 870,000 passengers. After {{the opening of the}} Ulriken Tunnel commuter trains were kept for six months, with the last trip ran on 31 January 1965.|$|E

5|$|The American {{plan was}} that Putnam would direct the {{defenses}} from Brooklyn Heights, while Sullivan and Stirling and their {{troops would be}} stationed on the Guan Heights. The Guan (hills) <b>were</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 150 feet high and blocked the most direct route to Brooklyn Heights. Washington believed that, by stationing men on the heights, heavy casualties could be inflicted on the British before the troops fell {{back to the main}} defenses at Brooklyn Heights. There were three main passes through the heights; the Gowanus Road farthest to the west, the Flatbush Road slightly farther to the east, {{in the center of the}} American line where it was expected that the British would attack, and the Bedford Road farthest to the east. Stirling was responsible for defending the Gowanus Road with 500 men, and Sullivan was to defend the Flatbush and Bedford roads where there were 1,000 and 800 men respectively. Six-thousand troops were to remain behind at Brooklyn Heights. There was one lesser-known pass through the heights farther to the east called the Jamaica Pass, which was defended by just five militia officers on horses.|$|E
5|$|The elite legions {{were large}} {{infantry}} formations, varying between 25 and 33 in number, of c. 5,500 men each (all infantry save a small cavalry arm of 120) which admitted only Roman citizens. The auxilia consisted of around 400 much smaller units of c. 500 men each (a minority <b>were</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 1,000 strong), which {{were divided into}} approximately 100 cavalry alae, 100 infantry cohortes and 200 mixed cavalry/infantry units or cohortes equitatae. Some auxilia regiments were designated sagittariorum, meaning that they specialised in archery. The auxilia thus contained almost all the Roman army's cavalry and archers, as well as (from the late 1st century onwards) approximately {{the same number of}} foot soldiers as the legions. The auxilia were mainly recruited from the peregrini: provincial subjects of the empire who did not hold Roman citizenship, but the auxilia also admitted Roman citizens and possibly barbari, the Roman term for peoples living outside the empire's borders. At this time both legions and auxilia were almost all based in frontier provinces. The only substantial military force at the immediate disposal of the emperor was the elite Praetorian Guard of c. 10,000 men which was based in Rome.|$|E
5|$|The fleet {{remained}} in captivity during the negotiations that ultimately produced the Treaty of Versailles. Von Reuter {{believed that the}} British intended to seize the German ships on 21 June 1919, which was the deadline for Germany to have signed the peace treaty. Unaware that the deadline had been extended to the 23rd, Reuter ordered the ships to be sunk at the next opportunity. On the morning of 21 June, the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers, and at 11:20 Reuter transmitted the order to his ships. The ship sank in two hours and fifteen minutes. The task of raising Von der Tann was secured by Ernest Cox's salvage company. During preparation work, three workers were nearly killed when their oxy-acetylene cutters set off a major explosion. The blast tore holes in the still submerged vessel and allowed water into the compartment that had been emptied with compressed air; {{by the time the}} men were rescued, the compartment had refilled almost completely and the men <b>were</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> their necks. Nevertheless, the ship was successfully brought up on 7 December 1930, and scrapped at Rosyth by the Alloa Shipbreaking Company between 1931 and 1934.|$|E

5|$|The {{resulting}} Chicago school produced large, solid-looking skyscrapers, {{built with}} a common appearance and to a common height. The result was usually a box-like palazzo, illuminated with a large light court, ideally, if space allowed, in the center. The outside of the building was commonly divided into three parts: a base, middle section and the roof line. This tripartite design was intended both to emulate classical columns, and reflect {{the functions of the}} different parts of the skyscraper. The central court could form a simple courtyard, but many companies preferred to roof over the courtyard with glass to produce an atrium for shops and restaurants. Rents for these shops <b>were</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> five or six times that for office space, and made an important difference to the income from a property. Chicago skyscraper windows were also a feature of the style; these were large, fixed windows flanked by smaller sash windows on either side, which provided access to sunlight and adequate ventilation. Sometimes these protruded from the building to form a slight bay.|$|E

In January 1918 the squadron was redesignated No.6 Squadron AFC; the other AFC units were also renamed at this time. No. 6 Squadron moved to Minchinhampton on 25 February. The squadron used several different types of aircraft to train pilots, including the Bristol Scout D, Sopwith 1½ Strutter, Sopwith Pup, Avro 504, Airco DH.5, Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5 and Sopwith Camel.

5|$|Tudor {{investigated}} various ice {{houses in}} 1805 {{and came to}} conclude they could be constructed above ground as well. His early ice houses in Cuba had inner and outer timber walls, insulated with peat and sawdust, with some form of a ventilation system, and these formed the basic design for ice houses {{during the rest of}} the century. By 1819, however, Tudor was also building ice houses from brick, able to hold more than 200 tons (200,000kg) of ice, using charcoal within the walls for insulation. By the 1840s, warehouses by the Pond <b>were</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 36,000 square feet (3,300 square metres) in size, being built of brick to avoid the risk of fire from the new railroad line.
