5|$|Sailor Brian Hancock {{encountered}} Hurricane Lili {{during the}} Route of Discovery yacht race from Benalmádena, Spain to Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic.Tropical Storm Lili was traveling at around 18 knots {{along the same}} path as the race fleet and was starting to pick off the slower boats. Astern of us we were getting reports of gale force winds, ripped sails and some damage all the while Lili gained in strength. By our calculation <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> to the Bahamas before the storm did, but {{the problem was that}} the Bahamas were not our final destination. We had to round San Salvador and then sail just under 500 miles back toward the east, well southeast to be exact. We rounded San Salvador and sailed slap bang into the teeth of a ferocious storm. Hurricane Lili was packing around 70 to 80 knots of wind and we hove to to ride it out. I remember feeling exhilarated by it all. It helps to be a little naive and dumb but that’s how you are when you are in your 20’s.|$|E
25|$|Note that karaten/karaten is {{the only}} pair with more than two syllables (although <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> a second one if we used the {{definite}} forms of the pair perser/pärser, i.e. perserna/pärserna). The word pair länder (=countries, plural of land) and länder (=loins, plural of länd) could have been included, {{but this one is}} controversial. For those speakers who have grave accent in the plural of länd, the definite plural forms will also constitute a three-syllable minimal pair: länderna (acute accent, =the countries) vs. länderna (grave accent, =the loins). Although examples with more than two syllables are very few in Standard Swedish, it is possible to find other three-syllable pairs in regional dialects, such as Värmländska: hunnera (acute, =the Huns) vs. hunnera (grave, =the dogs), ändera/ännera (acute, =the ducks) vs. ändera/ännera (grave, =the ends), etc.|$|E
25|$|They {{were pretty}} good sea boats, {{although}} very wet, {{there was a}} saying that they submerged at the Heads and surfaced down at Gabo Island. We worked mainly four on, four off. Turn to, to ‘shoot away’, pick up and store the catch and clean up. We worked bloody long hours. I think there were six deckies, four firemen, one engineer, one wireless operator and the master and mate. The galley was right aft with the mess room beneath. You would get your feed, climb down the hatchway to the mess room below. <b>We</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> {{a bucket of water}} from the galley to take to the forecastle where we bunked. By the time we got forward we would have only half a bucket of hot water to wash in but after a couple of days you didn’t worry about washing. You were wet through most of the time so it didn’t matter.|$|E

500|$|Externally, Stevens {{is always}} calm, but {{internally}} he {{is far from}} it. [...] "I'm not as calm as everybody thinks," [...] Stevens says. His wife Tracy adds, [...] "He’s calm and collected, but he’s fiercely competitive. He’s always thinking about how he can beat you." [...] Former player Joel Cornette says [...] "Everyone sees Brad as a level-headed, calm and cool coach, but he’s about as competitive of a guy as I know. <b>We</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> into it constantly, whether playing two-on-two or arguing about players’ having better college careers." ...|$|E
500|$|At 16:56, Taylor {{was again}} asked {{to turn on}} his {{transmitter}} for YG if he had one. He did not acknowledge but {{a few minutes later}} advised his flight [...] "Change course to 090 degrees (due east) for 10 minutes." [...] About the same time someone in the flight said [...] "Dammit, if we could just fly west <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> home; head west, dammit." [...] This difference of opinion later led to questions about why the students did not simply head west on their own. It has been explained that this can be attributed to military discipline.|$|E
500|$|One of the {{projects}} took Pei back to Dallas, Texas, to design the Morton H. Meyerson Symphony Center. The success of city's performing artists, particularly the Dallas Symphony Orchestra then being led by conductor Eduardo Mata, led to interest by city leaders in creating a modern center for musical arts that could rival the best halls in Europe. The organizing committee contacted 45architects, but at first Pei did not respond, thinking that {{his work on the}} Dallas City Hall had left a negative impression. One of his colleagues from that project, however, insisted that he meet with the committee. He did and, although it would be his first concert hall, the committee voted unanimously to offer him the commission. As one member put it: [...] "We were convinced that <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> the world's greatest architect putting his best foot forward." ...|$|E

5000|$|The most {{significant}} risk factor is age. According to cancer researcher Robert A. Weinberg, [...] "If we lived long enough, {{sooner or later}} <b>we</b> all <b>would</b> <b>get</b> cancer." [...] Essentially all {{of the increase in}} cancer rates between prehistoric times and people who died in England between 1901 and 1905 is due to increased lifespans.|$|R
500|$|In an {{interview}} when describing Chi's character, Clamp member Satsuki Igarashi stated [...] "Lately we've {{been saying that}} the easiest to understand is Chii from 'Chobits.' Errors occur with computers. Things like 'Although it's fine to speak the instructions' and 'Please fix this problem here' might be spoken in a cute voice." [...] In addition, an explanation for Chobitss plot was given by Igarashi who stated: [...] "Back then, when our computer had problems all <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> were these inscrutable error messages. However, {{we had no idea}} what was wrong because it wouldn't tell us any more". Clamp also describes Chobits as a variation of the [...] "boy living with mysterious girl" [...] genre. Chi's design as a personal computer resulted from Ohkawa's wish to increase the sense of [...] "emotional discomfort" [...] around becoming emotionally involved with something considered to be merely a lifeless machine.|$|E
500|$|Stunt {{coordinator}} Tanner Gill {{explained that}} the hotel in which the climactic fighting takes place was designed specifically with the fights in mind, saying [...] "The basic environment of the fight had to be constructed to be “stunt friendly.” The space was tailored. Each corner was rounded; surfaces were measured for height and size, then padded." [...] Elaborating on this, fight choreographer Matt Mullins stated, [...] "The main fight starts in a hallway, and then we move into a penthouse. Okay, we have a hallway and a penthouse—what can we do with that? Are we going to crash into some walls? Are we {{going to go into}} a kitchen? We see what <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> in terms of props, we take into consideration what the actors can do, move-wise—in our case, Ming-Na is exceptionally talented, so we {{can do a lot of}} different martial arts movement with her." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{large portion}} of the episode was based on the ancient {{astronaut}} theory, which proposes that intelligent extraterrestrial beings have visited Earth in antiquity or prehistory and made contact with humans. Frank Spotnitz later remarked that he was astounded at how little negative fan mail the show received, {{despite the fact that the}} [...] "Biogenesis"/"The Sixth Extinction"/"" [...] story arc heavily hinted that aliens were the originators of the notion of God and religion. He credited the manner in which the show handled this delicate subject, saying, [...] "Often in the past, we've done stuff where I was sure <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> angry letters. But we rarely do. And the reason is because of the way we handle things. In 'Amor Fati' we treated the religious side with respect." [...] The ancient astronaut themes were later revisited in the two season nine episodes [...] "Provenance" [...] and [...] "Providence." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{two were}} tempted to ally {{themselves}} with Steven Spielberg, who produced Used Cars and I Wanna Hold Your Hand, which were both box office bombs. Zemeckis and Gale initially had shown the screenplay to Spielberg, who had [...] "loved" [...] it. Spielberg, however, was {{absent from the}} project during development because Zemeckis felt if he produced another flop under him, {{he would never be}} able to make another film. Gale said [...] "we were afraid that <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> the reputation that we were two guys who could only get a job because we were pals with Steven Spielberg." [...] Zemeckis chose to direct Romancing the Stone instead, which was a box office success. Now a high-profile director, Zemeckis reapproached Spielberg with the concept. Agreeing to produce Back to the Future, Spielberg set the project up at his production company, Amblin Entertainment, with Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall joining Spielberg as executive producers on the film.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Alonso Ruizpalacios, at the Estudios Churubusco in Mexico City, gathering 300 fans who responded to an invitation posted by Lafourcade in social networks. The singer asked her fans to send a thought inspired by the song or a personal story derived from their identification with [...] "Hasta la Raíz". [...] "I thought that <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> few answers, but received almost 800 responses immediately, and later {{it turned into a}} riot and we did not know if they would get out of control, but nothing happened, my fans are super cool," [...] Lafourcade told Variety Latino. In the video, shot in black and white, Lafourcade is surrounded by several people who lead her to a stage to perform {{the last part of the}} song, in the meantime, Lafourcade throws flowers in the air, kisses a guy and plays a guitar. According to Milly Contreras of Latin Post the video [...] "shows off the singer's individuality and simplicity" [...] and included it at number 7 in the list for the [...] "10 Best Latin Music Videos of 2015".|$|E
500|$|The {{portions}} of the episode about the alien shard and Mulder's telepathic abilities allude to the ancient astronaut theory, which proposes that intelligent extraterrestrial beings visited Earth and made contact with humans in antiquity or prehistory. Spotnitz was surprised that the show received few complaints, even though the [...] "Biogenesis"/"The Sixth Extinction"/"Amor Fati" [...] story arc heavily suggested that aliens developed the notions of God and religion. He praised {{the manner in which}} the show handled this subject, saying, [...] "Often in the past, we've done stuff where I was sure <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> angry letters. But we rarely do. And the reason is because of the way we handle things. In 'Amor Fati' we treated the religious side [...] with respect." [...] Spotnitz later identified the combination of science and religion as [...] "a conjunction of science and mysticism, of aliens and religion, that we're starting to develop. It's deliberate on our part, to help bring all the mythologies together into one story line." [...] The ancient astronaut themes were revisited in two season nine episodes: [...] "Provenance" [...] and [...] "Providence".|$|E

500|$|Beginning on 1 June, {{the first}} track to be {{recorded}} was [...] "Us and Them", followed six days later by [...] "Money". [...] Waters had created effects loops from recordings of various money-related objects, including coins thrown into a food-mixing bowl taken from his wife's pottery studio, and these were later re-recorded {{to take advantage of}} the band's decision to record a quadraphonic mix of the album (Parsons has since expressed dissatisfaction with the result of this mix, attributed to a lack of time and the paucity of available multi-track tape recorders). [...] "Time" [...] and [...] "The Great Gig in the Sky" [...] were the next pieces {{to be recorded}}, followed by a two-month break, during which the band spent time with their families and prepared for an upcoming tour of the US. [...] The recording sessions suffered regular interruptions; Waters, a supporter of Arsenal F.C., would often break to see his team compete, and the band would occasionally stop work to watch Monty Python's Flying Circus on the television, leaving Parsons to work on material recorded up to that point. [...] Gilmour has, however, disputed this claim; in an interview in 2003 he said: [...] "We would sometimes watch them but when we were on a roll, <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> on." ...|$|E
500|$|On the reveal, Dohring {{said in an}} interview: [...] "I’m {{actually}} glad, Rob told {{us about}} episode six or seven that <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> together. We were like, ‘No way!’ But there was something going on there. We could feel it as actors. It was damn cool – these characters {{had some kind of}} connection. So we had to start to soften {{it up a little bit}} and break the ice somewhat [...] I’m glad he gave us that heads up." [...] Lead actress Kristen Bell expressed surprise over the initial decision by saying, [...] "I love working with Jason and he's such a great actor to work opposite, but sometimes, I feel it's really just weird luck. Somehow people get magic dust sprinkled on them and you don't know why. You look like you have boatloads of chemistry with someone else." [...] On the kiss itself, Dohring noted, [...] "It was so funny, as an actor, to kiss this girl. I was all nervous beforehand. But you have to just let it go for the scene. It was so fun to watch ," [...] adding that [...] "a lot of that emotion was real for me." [...] The song [...] "Momentary Thing" [...] by band Something Happens plays during Veronica and Logan's first kiss.|$|E
500|$|... "Hush" [...] explores issues {{relating}} to the limits and benefits of language and communication. During the first act of the episode, the characters are presented as being overwhelmed by language that is misused, used as white noise, and employed {{as a means of}} avoiding truth. Many of the conversations between characters, even those that are seemingly insignificant to the episode's plot or to the show's overall history, deal in some way with various aspects or forms of communication. Whedon stated that he was unaware of how [...] "inevitably coherent" [...] this theme was until after the script was completed. Buffy and Riley are unable to act upon their attraction because they cannot stop babbling, primarily to keep their true identities concealed from each other, but also to avoid becoming closer emotionally. Xander is unable or unwilling to express what Anya means to him, and Anya, still new at interacting with humans, uses blunt, often rude language that distances herself from all the other characters. Giles desperately wants the others to stop talking. Willow considers the women in the Wicca group to be nonsensical, later complaining to Buffy [...] "Talk, all talk. Blah blah Gaia. Blah blah moon, menstrual lifeforce power thingy. You know after a couple sessions I was hoping <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> into something real, but..." [...] These pseudo conversations are what Buffy essayists Alice Jenkins and Susan Stuart refer to as [...] "locutionary acts": language that is formed to have meaning but does not engage the listener.|$|E
5000|$|In May 2011, Krasnopolski {{was charged}} with deserting from the Israeli army. The Israeli skating {{federation}} stated, [...] "We've asked for clarifications his service, and if <b>we</b> <b>would</b> have <b>gotten</b> them immediately Evgeni would have returned. The decision to let him stay abroad for training was a professional call made by the federation. The soldier got the (right) impression that we are handling the matter with the IDF {{and that he could}} trust the federation".|$|R
500|$|The {{series was}} {{successfully}} nominated in 2009, {{but failed to}} merit an award. Mark Hentemann, executive producer and showrunner of Family Guy said of the nominating process, [...] "We had internal discussions in the writers' room, {{and it seemed like}} we were much more akin to the other primetime comedies than we were to children's shows in animation. <b>We</b> assumed <b>we</b> <b>would</b> not <b>get</b> anywhere, and so it was a great surprise when we got the nomination." ...|$|R

And, that day, it just seemed to fall into place."

500|$|Nine demos were {{recorded}} at The Mill studio in September 2003 by Paul McCartney and his touring band. A month later, in October, album sessions for Memory Almost Full began, and were produced by David Kahne and recorded at Abbey Road Studios. McCartney {{and the band}} recorded the songs [...] "You Tell Me", [...] "Only Mama Knows", [...] "Vintage Clothes", [...] "That Was Me", [...] "Feet in the Clouds", [...] "House of Wax", [...] "The End of the End", and [...] "Whole Life". However, the sessions were cut short and put on hiatus when McCartney started another album, Chaos and Creation in the Backyard, with producer Nigel Godrich. In the website constructed for the album, McCartney stated: [...] "I actually started this album, Memory Almost Full, before my last album Chaos and Creation in the Backyard, released September 2005. (...) When I was just finishing up everything concerned with Chaos and had just got the Grammy nominations (2006) I realised I had this album {{to go back to}} and finish off. So I got it out to listen to it again, wondering if I would enjoy it, but actually I really loved it. All I did at first was just listen to a couple of things and then I began to think, 'OK, I like that track– now, what is wrong with it?' And it might be something like a drum sound, so then I would re-drum and see where <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> to. (...) In places it's a very personal record {{and a lot of it}} is retrospective, drawing from memory, like memories from being a kid, from Liverpool and from summers gone. The album is evocative, emotional, rocking, but I can't really sum it up in one sentence".|$|E
