500|$|Artist V. Jeevananthan {{compared}} Aval Appadithan {{to other}} films whose central theme was women, such as Charulata (1964), Aval Oru Thodar Kathai (1974), and Panchagni (1986), while also labelling them as [...] "classics {{that put the}} spotlight on women." [...] Ashish Rajadhyaksha and Paul Willemen, in their book Encyclopedia of Indian Cinema, say the film was also inspired by the 1972 film, Dhakam, which starred R. Muthuraman and Pandari Bai. They also note that Aval Appadithan uses a [...] "fluid narrative style" [...] and music to mix flashbacks with vox-pop and [...] "glossy pictorialism". The film is an exception on stereotypes of women, as shown by paralleling an independent woman, Manju, and a pious traditional woman: Manju gets into problems while Arun's wife is happy. The last lines of the film where Manju asks [...] "what {{do you think of}} 'women's liberation'", [...] Arun's wife answers, [...] "I don't know", [...] to which Manju says [...] "that is <b>why</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> happy", send the message that one will inevitably get into trouble if one exhibits assertive behaviour.|$|E
500|$|Between 25 January and 29 January, Thomas {{was interviewed}} four times {{by members of}} the Australian Federal Police (AFP) and {{by members of the}} Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO), {{accompanied}} by Pakistani officials. During one of these interviews, a Pakistani official said to Thomas [...] "we told you that you have to prove it... that you are not a terrorist... you have to prove it that you are an innocent man and <b>why</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> sitting here." [...] Thomas was then transferred again, this time to the city of Lahore, where he was kept for another three weeks, and interrogated by Pakistani officials and an American official referred to as [...] "Joe". This man suggested that Thomas return to Afghanistan with a recording device, to obtain information on Al Qaeda figures, a suggestion Thomas rejected because he feared he would be killed. Joe also threatened Thomas that he would be sent to Afghanistan where he would be tortured by having his testicles twisted, and implied that agents would be sent to Australia to rape Thomas' wife. Thomas was then returned to Islamabad.|$|E

"'Rosa, I do not {{understand}} this at all, and I {{want you to tell}} me <b>why</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> so extravagantly glad when you found my brother George was coming here, and <b>why</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> so overcome by your emotions when you heard of his engagement.' ...|$|R

I know <b>why</b> <b>you</b> have {{kept away from}} me, <b>why</b> <b>you</b> have <b>been</b> so cruel! It was because I failed. Was it not, dear Mademoiselle Violet?" ...|$|R
500|$|The truth finally emerges that Manju {{was merely}} baiting Thyagu {{to teach him}} a lesson. When Thyagu starts believing that Manju has fallen for him, he {{attempts}} {{to take advantage of}} her at a party banquet, but she rebukes and slaps him, after which Thyagu runs away in fright. However, this revelation comes too late for her, as Arun, who is disillusioned with her behaviour, has already married a small town girl (Saritha). When Manju tells her aunt about the attempt to humiliate Thyagu and its ramifications, her aunt tells Manju that she deserved it for leaving behind a golden opportunity to start a new life. In a final discussion in Thyagu's car, Manju asks Arun's wife, [...] "What do you think of women's liberation?". Arun's wife replies, [...] "I don't know". Manju replies with a cynical, [...] "that is <b>why</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> happy". The film ends with Manju standing on the road as the car carrying Thyagu and the married couple pulls away from her. A voice-over says, [...] "She died today. She will be reborn tomorrow. She will die again. She will be reborn again. That is how she is".|$|E
2500|$|On 2 April, the two {{captured}} {{officers were}} shown on Iran's Alam-TV, {{in front of}} a map of the Persian Gulf area which showed a position for the capture inside Iran's waters. Carman said, [...] " [...] I would like to say to the Iranian people, 'I can understand <b>why</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> so angry about our intrusion into your waters'".|$|E
2500|$|Stewart began {{spending}} time in Oregon in 1903. [...] He was allowed to represent clients in local Portland courts before passing the bar examination, and was assigned as the public defender {{in a few cases}} in 1903. [...] Like the Twin Cities, Portland's black community was small when Stewart permanently settled there in 1904. [...] Most African Americans were service workers or unskilled, menial laborers, though there were some black-owned businesses. Stewart's father was disappointed in his son's decision to move to Portland, noting [...] "But for the life of me, I can't see <b>why</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> 'using up' your life where you are", suggesting his son try moving abroad like he had. [...] Stewart disregarded the advice and remained in Oregon, and was the first African American admitted to the state bar on March 1, 1901.|$|E

2500|$|Contributions by attorneys, psychiatrists, {{and doctors}} were common as were advice columns {{on how to}} raise {{children}} while being a [...] "deviant". Marion Zimmer Bradley offered advice on whether to stay married after one knows she is a lesbian. [...] And the issue of marriage was brought up again in 1959 when The Ladder reported on a panel discussion sponsored by the Daughters of Bilitis that debated if marriage could cure homosexuality, all opinions of psychotherapists at hand saying that it could not, and one offering {{that it was not}} to be cured as it was not a disease. A 1957 column featuring a psychotherapist who offered his opinion on how one determines the source of lesbians' fear of men: [...] "The basic problem in evaluating your personal problems is to find out <b>why</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> shying away from sexual relations with men. In other words, the problem is not why you like women, but why you don't like men." [...] Forrest J Ackerman wrote two articles under his pseudonym LauraJean Ermayne (normally used for writing lesbian pulp fiction) and was declared an [...] "honorary lesbian" [...] for his contributions.|$|E
