Maybe <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> a different country to record the album. Maybe we should write a more metal or more full-on thrash metal. Whatever we feel, first and foremost, that is the most important thing. Time will tell." [...] In a September 2017 interview with Australia's Silver Tiger Media, Petrozza stated that Kreator will do another album after Gods of Violence but [...] "not yet." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the Orthodox Church {{there are}} no [...] "categories" [...] of sin as found in the Christian West. In the pre-Vatican II Catholic catechism, sins were {{categorized}} as [...] "mortal" [...] and [...] "venial." [...] In this definition, a [...] "mortal" [...] sin was one which would prevent someone from entering heaven unless one confessed it before death... These categories do {{not exist in the}} Orthodox Church. Sin is sin. Concerning Confession, having a list of deadly sins could, in fact, become an obstacle to genuine repentance. For example, imagine that you commit a sin. You look on the list and do not find it listed. It would be very easy to take the attitude that, since it is not on a list of deadly sins, it is not too serious. Hence, you do not feel the need to seek God's forgiveness right away. A week passes and you have completely forgotten about what you had done. You never sought God's forgiveness; as a result, you did not receive it, either. <b>We</b> <b>should</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Confession when we sin—at the very least, we should ask God to forgive us daily in our personal prayers. We should not see Confession as a time to confess only those sins which may be found on a list.|$|E

60|$|For a {{while we}} sat down and watched this grim people eating their evening meal in silence as grim as themselves, till at length, getting tired of contemplating them and the huge moving shadows on the rocky walls, I {{suggested}} to our new keeper that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> like <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> bed.|$|R

6000|$|... "It may be so," [...] replied Paul, {{with a laugh}} which {{merged into}} a yawn, [...] "and {{perhaps it would be}} wiser that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> rest. Olly and Oscar have already set us a good example. What say you, Hendrick?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{ought to}} know better than I how <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> work. Dan an' I {{thought there would be}} plenty of time, for if those fellows were going to skip very soon they wouldn't have taken the trouble to carry the stuff down there, where it could not be gotten away quickly." ...|$|E
60|$|On the Sunday the {{expected}} letter came;--but before its contents are made known, {{it will be}} well that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>go</b> back <b>to</b> Belton, and see what was done by Clara {{in reference to the}} tidings which her lover had sent her.|$|R

60|$|It {{was about}} {{a quarter of an hour}} after this when Kitty {{proposed}} that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>go</b> out <b>to</b> the front of the house; it would look queer if any of the servants should come by and see us sitting together like that.

60|$|Such, {{as nearly}} as I can recollect, was {{the tenor of}} the tale told by the Cape Cod whaler. There were divers trivial {{particulars}} which I have omitted, and which wiled away the morning very pleasantly, until the time of tide favorable for fishing being passed, it was proposed that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> land, and refresh ourselves under the trees, until the noontide heat should have abated.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I don't doubt it, Picotee; just as {{you come}} to London without caring about consequences, or would do any other crazy thing and not mind in the least what came of it.

"Now, lads," [...] said Jack {{after we}} had {{laid it on the}} stone which {{contained}} our little all, [...] "I propose that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the tail of the island, where the ship struck, which is only {{a quarter of a mile}} off; and see if anything else has been thrown ashore.

6000|$|... "I don't wonder," [...] {{answered}} Margaret, [...] "that {{they are}} getting tired; they have found the pole, {{and they want to}} come home. That is natural enough.

6000|$|... "'I know, I know,' {{replied the}} young man, with a short, heavy sigh. 'You mean--the {{question}} of suicide--I cannot understand it at all--it seems so sudden and so terrible--she certainly had seemed listless and troubled lately--but only at times--and yesterday morning, when I went to business, she appeared quite herself again, and I suggested that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the opera in the evening. She was delighted, I know, {{and told me}} she would do some shopping, and pay a few calls in the afternoon.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{they come}} here too {{numerous}} to fight we must fly; {{but if they are}} not too strong we will give them battle here. Why <b>should</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> meet them?" ...|$|R
60|$|He {{conducted}} {{them with}} old-fashioned ceremony to the laird's best spare bedroom, and then, returning {{to me in}} the parlour, proposed that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>go</b> down together <b>to</b> the beach and learn whether anything fresh had occurred.|$|R
6000|$|... "We are {{not turned}} out exactly; {{but as they}} said <b>we</b> <b>should</b> have <b>to</b> <b>go</b> soon, it was best <b>to</b> <b>go</b> now {{everybody}} was moving, because there are better chances." ...|$|R
