In April 2012, Damon filmed Promised Land, {{directed}} by Gus Van Sant, which he co-wrote with John Krasinski. Damon's next film with frequent collaborator Steven Soderbergh was Behind the Candelabra, a drama {{about the life}} of pianist/entertainer Liberace (played by Michael Douglas) with Damon playing Liberace's longtime partner Scott Thorson. The film premiered on HBO on May 26, 2013.|$|E
5|$|We were in {{a studio}} in New York, this place called the Magic Shop, and it had this thing called a tack piano there, which sounds like an old honky-tonk piano, where you put little tacks in the hammers, so it sounds like more of a {{harpsichord}} almost. And {{so we wanted to}} use that kind of sound, but we didn't have a tack piano, so rather than sample it, we went and bought an old piano from the shop up the road from our studio, and <b>we</b> <b>bought</b> <b>a</b> load of tacks, and me and Guy and Jon spent a couple of hours pushing tacks into the piano hammers.|$|E
500|$|Johansson {{signed on}} to play Black Widow in Jon Favreau's Iron Man 2 (2010), {{a part of the}} Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Before she secured the role, she dyed her hair red to {{convince}} Favreau that she was right for the part, and undertook stunt and strength training preparing for the role. Johannsson said the character resonated with her, and she admired the superhero's human traits. The film earned $623.9million against its $200million budget, and received generally positive reviews from critics, but she was mostly criticized for her performance. Tim Robey of The Daily Telegraph believed that she [...] "gets nothing to do but pout [...] perform a few swivel kicks", and Matt Goldberg similarly thought that she had little to do but look attractive. In 2011, Johansson played the role of Kelly, a zookeeper in the family film <b>We</b> <b>Bought</b> <b>a</b> Zoo alongside Matt Damon. The film garnered mainly favorable reviews, and Anne Billson praised Johansson for bringing depth to a rather uninteresting character. Johansson earned a Teen Choice Award for Choice Movie Actress: Drama nomination for her performance.|$|E

[...] "I am {{speaking}} no treason, but am only explaining why our larder is empty, save some black bread, and some pig's flesh <b>we</b> <b>bought</b> <b>an</b> hour ago; besides, this youth is scarce {{likely to be}} one of the duke's spies." ...|$|R

We're going to trial {{and we want to}} crush them [...] But every time we've gotten close to going to trial, it gets postponed and we've wasted money and time and it has just drained our creative energy. <b>We</b> <b>bought</b> <b>an</b> insurance policy for peace of mind, but instead we {{would have been better off}} if we never had it and just dealt with the original lawsuit.|$|R
2500|$|With {{production}} on Aloha delayed, Crowe set his next feature, the family comedy-drama <b>We</b> <b>Bought</b> <b>a</b> Zoo, based on Benjamin Mee's memoir {{of the same}} name. Crowe collaborated with The Devil Wears Prada writer Aline Brosh McKenna on the screenplay. The book's story follows Mee, who buys and moves into a dilapidated zoo (now Dartmoor Zoological Park) in the English countryside. Looking for a fresh start along with his seven-year-old daughter and his troubled fourteen-year-old son, he hopes to refurbish the zoo and run it and to give his children what he calls an [...] "adventure". Crowe changed the location to the U.S.A. The film received a wide release on December 23, 2011 by 20th Century Fox, and starred Matt Damon and Scarlett Johansson. The film has received positive reviews. The music of the movie was composed by Jonsi.|$|E
60|$|In short, {{for this}} cloth, and some money, <b>we</b> <b>bought</b> <b>a</b> box of choice pearls, which {{the chief of}} them had picked out from the rest for the Portuguese merchants at Goa; and which, when I came to London, was valued at two {{thousand}} two hundred pounds sterling.|$|E
60|$|At {{the door}} <b>we</b> <b>bought</b> <b>a</b> string of beads, {{with a small}} {{crucifix}} appended, {{in memory of the}} place. The beads seem to be of a grayish, pear-shaped seed, and the seller assured us that they were the tears of St. Job. They were cheap, probably because Job shed so many tears in his lifetime.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Baas, but {{sometimes}} other things change besides words. Will the Baas have that buck's leg for supper, or the {{stuff out of}} a tin with a dint in it, which <b>we</b> <b>bought</b> at <b>a</b> store two years ago? The flies have got at the buck's leg, but I cut out the bits with the maggots on it and ate them myself." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Sir, it is <b>a</b> Moor Park, <b>we</b> <b>bought</b> it as <b>a</b> Moor Park, and it cost us--that is, it was {{a present}} from Sir Thomas, but I saw the bill--and I know it cost seven shillings, and was charged as a Moor Park." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well spoken, Rupert," [...] Sir John said. [...] "Now we {{have kept}} you {{talking in the}} sun an unconscionable time; come over to our tent, and have {{something}} to wash the dust away. We have some fairly good Burgundy, of which <b>we</b> <b>bought</b> <b>a</b> barrel the other day from a vintner in Nimeguen, {{and it must be}} drunk before we march.|$|E
60|$|Here <b>we</b> <b>bought</b> <b>a</b> great {{quantity}} of beef, which, having no casks to spare, we salted, and then cured {{it in the}} sun, by the Dutchman's direction, and it proved of excellent use to us through the whole voyage; for we kept some of it till we came to England, but it was then so hard, that a good hatchet would hardly cut it.|$|E
60|$|Here we {{came upon}} a new board shanty, and found some men engaged in {{building}} a stone house; so the Schwarenbach was soon to have a rival. <b>We</b> <b>bought</b> <b>a</b> bottle or so of beer here; at any rate they called it beer, but I knew by the price that it was dissolved jewelry, and I perceived by the taste that dissolved jewelry is not good stuff to drink.|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly," [...] said he. [...] "Why shouldn't <b>we?</b> I <b>bought</b> <b>a</b> {{new suit}} of clothes yesterday, {{and my wife}} and Corny look well enough for {{travelling}} purposes.

60|$|And we go home, and we dine in {{the company}} of Britons, at the {{comfortable}} Hotel du Parc, and <b>we</b> have <b>bought</b> <b>a</b> novel apiece for a shilling, and every half-hour the sweet carillon plays the waltz from Dinorah in the air. And we have been happy; and it seems about a month since we left London yesterday; and nobody knows where we are, and we defy care and the postman.|$|R
60|$|The Spaniards {{had helped}} us to some casks, but not many; those {{that they could}} spare were but small, and at last we were obliged {{to make use of}} about two hundred large earthen jars, which were of {{singular}} use to us. We got a large quantity of good rice here, which <b>we</b> <b>bought</b> of <b>a</b> Chinese merchant, who came in here with a large China vessel to trade, who bought of us also several of our European goods.|$|R
60|$|There was one solitary {{gleam of}} variety in our menu. An editor {{sent me a}} cheque {{for a set of}} verses. We cashed that cheque and trooped round the town in a body, laying out the money. <b>We</b> <b>bought</b> <b>a</b> leg of mutton, and a tongue and sardines, and pine-apple chunks, and potted meat, and many other noble things, and had a perfect banquet. Mrs. Beale, with the {{scenario}} of a smile on her face, the first that she had worn in these days of stress, brought in the joint, and uncovered it with an air.|$|E
6000|$|I {{think we}} tried on every straw hat in town, and <b>we</b> <b>bought</b> <b>a</b> couple {{in a little}} house, where two or three young women were making them. Rectus asked me, in a low voice, if I didn't {{think one of the}} young women was a Mohican. I hushed him up, for it was none of his {{business}} if she was. I had a good deal of trouble in making Rectus say [...] "Minorcan." [...] Whenever we had met a dark-haired person, he had said to me: [...] "Do you think that is a Mohican?" [...] It was a part of his old school disposition to get things wrong in this way. But he never got angry when I corrected him. His temper was perfect.|$|E
6000|$|... 'The sea {{was running}} heavily into the bay, {{but it is}} sand there and not much rock on the beach, {{and we had a}} jolly swim ashore. Then <b>we</b> <b>bought</b> <b>a</b> few yams, which the surf did not permit us to get to the boat, and had a very {{pleasant}} visit; for, as we sat among them, words came into one's head, or were caught from their mouth, {{and at the end of}} twenty minutes we were getting on a little. The old chief took me by the hand and led me aside to the spot where the ladies were assembled, and divining no doubt that I was a bachelor, politely offered me his daughter, and his protection, &c., if I would live among them.|$|E

40|$|I {{wrote the}} play Windy Gully in 1987 for Theatre South but the song Windy Gully was written some fifteen years earlier. Our family came to Kembla in 1968. <b>We</b> <b>bought</b> as <b>a</b> job lot a large {{dilapidated}} {{two and a}} half storey weather board general store, com dance hall/meeting place, domestic dwelling (circa 1895), a huge corrugated iron shed and an imported Hudson ready-cut Californian bungalow (built 1932). In the house was an old desk and in a drawer was a copy of the Royal Commission into the Mount Kembla Mine Disaster of 1902...|$|R
60|$|Accordingly {{we looked}} in at a baker's window, and after I {{had made a}} series of {{proposals}} to buy everything that was bilious in the shop, and he had rejected them one by one, we decided in favour of a nice little loaf of brown bread, which cost me threepence. Then, at <b>a</b> grocer's shop, <b>we</b> <b>bought</b> <b>an</b> egg and a slice of streaky bacon; which still left what I thought a good deal of change, out of the second of the bright shillings, and made me consider London a very cheap place. These provisions laid in, we went on through a great noise and uproar that confused my weary head beyond description, and over a bridge which, no doubt, was London Bridge (indeed I think he told me so, but I was half asleep), until we came to the poor person's house, which was a part of some alms-houses, as I knew by their look, and by an inscription on a stone over the gate which said they were established for twenty-five poor women.|$|R
60|$|Everybody we had {{anything}} to do with seemed to cheat us. Our appearance in a shop was a signal for the damaged goods to be brought out immediately. If <b>we</b> <b>bought</b> <b>a</b> lobster, it was full of water. All our meat turned out to be tough, and there was hardly any crust to our loaves. In search of the principle on which joints ought to be roasted, to be roasted enough, and not too much, I myself referred to the Cookery Book, and found it there established as the allowance of a quarter of an hour to every pound, and say a quarter over. But the principle always failed us by some curious fatality, and we never could hit any medium between redness and cinders.|$|E
60|$|We had a {{good deal}} of trouble finding a rope, but we bought one, at last, which was stout enough,--the man asked us {{if we were going to}} fish for sharks, and didn't seem to believe us when we said no,--and we took it to our room, and made knots in it about a foot apart. The fort walls are about twenty feet high, and we made the rope plenty long enough, with {{something}} to spare. We didn't have much trouble to find a grapnel. <b>We</b> <b>bought</b> <b>a</b> small one, but it was strong enough. We talked the matter over a great deal, and went to the fort several times, making examinations, and measuring the height of the wall, from the top, with a spool of cotton.|$|E
60|$|Wednesday.--History of Tuesday.--Woke at usual time, {{very little}} work, for I was tired, {{and had a}} job for the evening--to write parts for a new instrument, a violin. Lunch, chat, and up to my place to practise; {{but there was no}} practising for me--my {{flageolet}} was gone wrong, and I had to take it all to pieces, clean it, and put it up again. As this is a most intricate job--the thing dissolves into seventeen separate members, most of these have to be fitted on their individual springs as fine as needles, and sometimes two at once with the springs shoving different ways--it took me till two. Then Lloyd and I rode forth on our errands; first to Motootua, where we had a really instructive conversation on weeds and grasses. Thence down to Apia, where <b>we</b> <b>bought</b> <b>a</b> fresh bottle of chlorodyne and conversed on politics.|$|E
6000|$|My brother {{came again}} in June and joyfully aided {{me in my}} {{esthetic}} pioneering. We amazed the town by seeding down a potato patch and laying out a tennis court thereon, the first play-ground {{of its kind in}} Hamilton township, and often as we played of an afternoon, farmers on their way to market with loads of grain or hogs, paused to watch our game and make audible comment on our folly. <b>We</b> also <b>bought</b> <b>a</b> lawn-mower, the second in the town, and shaved our front yard. We took down the old picket fence {{in front of the house}} and we planted trees and flowers, until at last some of the elderly folk disgustedly exclaimed, [...] "What won't them Garland boys do next!" ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{series is}} {{educational}} {{as well as}} entertaining. It includes a lot of factual material aimed at pre-school and primary school children, as well as stories. [...] "I think it counters {{a lot of the}} very brash, bright colours, fast cut aggressive programming that is aimed at children," [...] said Director Jezz Wright in a 2010 interview with the BBC. [...] "When we had our son five years ago <b>we</b> <b>bought</b> quite <b>a</b> few educational DVDs and we were quite horrified just how little educative content there was. It was a conversation you have one evening with the other half - 'come on we can do better than this' - and so the seed was planted."

6000|$|... 'Mrs. Markleham,' {{said the}} Doctor, 'was quite vexed about him, poor thing; {{so we have}} got him at home again; and <b>we</b> have <b>bought</b> him <b>a</b> little Patent place, which agrees with him much better.' I knew enough of Mr. Jack Maldon to suspect from this account {{that it was a}} place where there was not much to do, and which was pretty well paid. The Doctor, walking up and down with his hand on my shoulder, and his kind face turned encouragingly to mine, went on: ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'We saw a {{pleasant}} party at Bligh Island, brought away {{one young man}} from that island, and two lads belonging to a neighbouring small island called Eowa. The next day we watered {{on the north side}} of Vanua Lava, and in the evening went across to Santa Maria. Here we landed on the next day among two hundred or more people, shy and noisy. <b>We</b> <b>bought</b> <b>a</b> few yams, and I detected some young fellows stealing from our little heap I would not overlook this, but the noticing it made them more suspicious that we meant to hurt them. As the Bishop and I, after some twenty minutes, turned to rejoin the boat, the whole crowd bolted like a shot right and left into the bush. Evidently they must have had some trading crew tire a parting shot in mere wantonness at them from their boat. I expected some arrows to be shot at us; but they did not shoot any.|$|E
60|$|I built {{a cottage}} for Susan and myself, {{and made a}} gateway {{in the form of}} a Gothic arch by setting up a whale's jaw-bones. <b>We</b> <b>bought</b> <b>a</b> heifer with her first calf, and had a little garden on the {{hillside}} to supply us with potatoes and green sauce for our fish. Our parlor, small and neat, was ornamented with our two profiles in one gilt frame, and with shells and pretty pebbles on the mantelpiece, selected from the sea's treasury of such things on Nahant Beach. On the desk, beneath the looking-glass, lay the Bible, which I had begun to read aloud at the book of Genesis, and the singing-book that Susan used for her evening psalm. Except the almanac, we had no other literature. All that I heard of books was when an Indian history or tale of shipwreck was sold by a pedler or wandering subscription-man to some one in the village, and read through its owner's nose to a slumbrous auditory.|$|E

500|$|The JAMs offered {{what they}} claimed were [...] "the last five" [...] copies of 1987 {{for sale at}} £1000 each in a full-page {{advertisement}} in the April 1988 edition of The Face. Drummond argued that the offer exploited a loophole in The JAMs' agreement with the MCPS: [...] "We were browsing around this record shop and came across these five copies of 1987.... We made it perfectly clear to the MCPS that we couldn't actually force the shops to send our LPs back.... ecause <b>we</b> <b>bought</b> them in <b>a</b> shop, these LPs don't come into the agreement {{and we can do}} what we like with them and not break any laws." ...|$|R
60|$|Atterbury {{managed the}} business. Me and Buck never quite {{understood}} all of it, though he {{explained it to}} us in full. It seems the company {{was a kind of}} cooperative one, and everybody that bought stock shared in the profits. First, <b>we</b> officers <b>bought</b> up <b>a</b> controlling interest--we had to have that--of the shares at 50 cents a hundred--just what the printer charged us--and the rest went to the public at a dollar each.

500|$|Khan is also {{recognized}} as a great villain outside of the Star Trek series. The Associated Press called the character [...] "one of sci-fi's great villains". In 2002, the Online Film Critics Society's 132 members voted Khan as the 10th Greatest Screen Villain of all time, the only Star Trek character {{to appear in the}} listing. In 2006, Emmy Magazine voted Khan [...] "TV's Most Out-of-This-World Character", beating out other science-fiction characters such as The Doctor and Commander Adama. Editors wrote that [...] "Khan was so cool <b>we</b> would've <b>bought</b> <b>a</b> Chrysler Cordoba if he'd told us to," [...] referring to an ad campaign Montalbán appeared in for Chrysler. The character also had a cultural impact outside of Star Trek fandom; a clip from The Wrath of Khan featuring Kirk screaming [...] "Khaaan!"
