2500|$|Over the years, {{there were}} several reunion rumors, and on 2 October 2003 it was made official: Europe {{announced}} {{plans for a new}} album and world tour. The band then switched back to the Final Countdown line-up, with John Norum as the only lead guitarist. [...] "There was no doubt that we wanted John back, and John wanted to get back," [...] Tempest said, [...] "For me it was important to get that spark going again that we had before." [...] Kee Marcello claimed that he was too busy with his own projects. [...] "I told them I didn't want to participate in a [...] studio album because musically, I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> a different kind of direction than the music Europe stands for," [...] Marcello said, [...] "Then we talked for a while about doing a six-piece tour – it didn't turn out that way because of different reasons." ...|$|E
2500|$|Frederick {{incorporates}} jargon {{from the}} est {{training in the}} work. He alternates between referring to the reader as [...] "an ass" [...] or [...] "baby". The book contains short segments on various themes titled: [...] "Total Acceptance and Responsibility", [...] "Winners and Losers", and [...] "The Game of Life". Chapter headings include: [...] "How to Get All the Cheese in Life" [...] and [...] "How to Get Where You Really <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Go</b> <b>in</b> Life". Frederick {{emphasizes the importance of}} self-awareness, writing: [...] "You are the Supreme being, in Spirit". He attempts to convince the reader that life should be considered a game, and that it is more desirable to win at a goal than it is to be right about it. Frederick's thesis is that individuals cause all events which occur in their lives, and that they should work to consciously control their circumstances.|$|E
2500|$|Boat 13 was {{partially}} filled from the Boat Deck and partially from A Deck {{after it had}} been lowered to that level when it was launched {{under the supervision of}} Murdoch and Moody at 1:40a.m. Again, it was heavily occupied, with 65 people aboard and Leading Fireman Frederick Barrett in charge. The occupants were mainly Second and Third Class women and children. Among the men aboard was Lawrence Beesley, who subsequently wrote a popular book about the disaster. Dr. Washington Dodge was also aboard, having earlier seen his wife and young son aboard Boat 5. He owed his presence aboard the boat to the apparent guilty feelings of Steward F. Dent Ray, who had urged the Dodges to sail on Titanic in the first place. Just before Boat 5 was lowered, Ray bundled Dodge aboard. 12-year-old Second Class passenger Ruth Becker was placed in this boat by Moody after being prevented from entering the heavily overloaded lifeboat number 11 which her mother and two siblings had boarded. She {{was one of the few}} passengers who brought blankets from her stateroom into a boat, which were later used to keep stokers, who were wearing sleeveless shirts, warm while rowing. Others did not want to board at all. A woman on deck became hysterical, crying, [...] "Don't put me in that boat! I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> that boat! I've never been in an open boat in my life!" [...] Ray told her, [...] "You have got to go and you may as well keep quiet." ...|$|E
