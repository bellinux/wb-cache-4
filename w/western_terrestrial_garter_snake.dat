5|$|With their complex {{reproductive}} {{needs and}} permeable skins, amphibians are often {{considered to be}} ecological indicators. In many terrestrial ecosystems, they constitute {{one of the largest}} parts of the vertebrate biomass. Any decline in amphibian numbers will affect the patterns of predation. The loss of carnivorous species {{near the top of the}} food chain will upset the delicate ecosystem balance and may cause dramatic increases in opportunistic species. In the Middle East, a growing appetite for eating frog legs and the consequent gathering of them for food was linked to an increase in mosquitoes. Predators that feed on amphibians are affected by their decline. The <b>western</b> <b>terrestrial</b> <b>garter</b> <b>snake</b> (Thamnophis elegans) in California is largely aquatic and depends heavily on two species of frog that are decreasing in numbers, the Yosemite toad (Bufo canorus) and the mountain yellow-legged frog (Rana muscosa), putting the snake's future at risk. If the snake were to become scarce, this would affect birds of prey and other predators that feed on it. Meanwhile, in the ponds and lakes, fewer frogs means fewer tadpoles. These normally play an important role in controlling the growth of algae and also forage on detritus that accumulates as sediment on the bottom. A reduction in the number of tadpoles may lead to an overgrowth of algae, resulting in depletion of oxygen in the water when the algae later die and decompose. Aquatic invertebrates and fish might then die and there would be unpredictable ecological consequences.|$|E

40|$|Evolutionary {{theories}} of aging {{are linked to}} life-history theory in that age-specific schedules of reproduction and survival determine the trajectory of age-specific mutation/selection balances across the life span and thus the rate of senescence. This is predicted to manifest at the organismal level {{in the evolution of}} energy allocation strategies of investing in somatic maintenance and robust stress responses in less hazardous envirnments in exchange for energy spent on growth and reproduction. Here we report experiments from long-studied populations of <b>western</b> <b>terrestrial</b> <b>garter</b> <b>snakes</b> (Thamnophis elegans) that reside in low and high extrinsic mortality environments, with evolved long and short life spans, respectively. Laboratory common-environment colonies of these two ecotypes were tested for a suite of physiological traits after control and stressed gestations. In offspring derived from control and corticosteronetreated dams, we measured resting metabolism; mitochondrial oxygen consumption, ATP and free radical production rates; and erythrocyte DNA damage and repair ability. We evaluated whether these aging biomarkers mirrored the evolution of life span and whether they were sensitive to stress. Neonates from the long-lived ecotype (1) were smaller, (2) consumed equal amounts of oxygen when corrected for body mass, (3) had DNA that damaged more readily but repaired more efficiently, and (4) had more efficient mitochondria and more efficient cellular antioxidant defenses than short-lived snakes. Many ecotype differences were enhanced in offspring derived from stress-treated dams, which supports the conclusion that nongenetic maternal effects may further impact the cellular stress defenses of offspring. Our findings reveal that physiological evolution underpins reptilian life histories and sheds light on the connectedness between stress response and aging pathways in wild-dwelling organisms...|$|R
40|$|Comparative {{evaluations}} of population dynamics in species with {{temporal and spatial}} variation in life-history traits are rare because they require long-term demographic time series from multiple populations. We present such an analysis using demographic data collected during the interval 1978 – 1996 for six populations of <b>western</b> <b>terrestrial</b> <b>garter</b> <b>snakes</b> (Thamnophis elegans) from two evolutionarily divergent ecotypes. Three replicate populations from a slow-living ecotype, found in mountain meadows of northeastern California, were characterized by individuals that develop slowly, mature late, reproduce infrequently with small reproductive effort, and live longer than individuals of three populations of a fast-living ecotype found at lakeshore locales. We constructed matrix population models {{for each of the}} populations based on 8 – 13 years of data per population and analyzed both deterministic dynamics based on mean annual vital rates and stochastic dynamics incorporating annual variation in vital rates. (1) Contributions of highly variable vital rates to fitness (λs) were buffered against the negative effects of stochastic variation, and this relationship was consistent with differences between the meadow (M-slow) and lakeshore (L-fast) ecotypes. (2) Annual variation in the proportion of gravid females had the greatest negative effect among all vital rates on λs. The magnitude of variation in the proportion of gravid females and its effect on λs was greater in M-slow than L-fast populations. (3) Variation in the proportion of gravid females, in turn, depended on annual variation in prey availability, and its effect on λs was 4 – 23 times greater in M-slow than L-fast populations. In addition to differences in stochastic dynamics between ecotypes, we also found higher mean mortality rates across all age classes in the L-fast populations. Our results suggest that both deterministic and stochastic selective forces have affected the evolution of divergent life-history traits in the two ecotypes, which, in turn, affect population dynamics. M-slow populations have evolved life-history traits that buffer fitness against direct effects of variation in reproduction and that spread lifetime reproduction across a greater number of reproductive bouts. These results highlight the importance of long-term demographic and environmental monitoring and of incorporating temporal dynamics into empirical studies of life-history evolution...|$|R

I found significant genetic differentiation and isolation by distance, as well as correlated patterns of pairwise divergence in both species. Independent estimates of effective population size and bi-directional migration rates also uncovered source-sink dynamics in both species that suggest frequent extinction-recolonization events within a metapopulation context. The generality of source-sink dynamics for an ecologically similar species within the same ecosystem was explored using a third species, B. boreas. I also identified ecological correlates of several population genetic parameters for all three species. Although F[subscript ST] were similar, B. boreas had larger effective population sizes, lower migration rates, lacked source-sink dynamics, and appeared to be in migration-drift equilibrium, indicative of a temporally stable population structure. A clustering analysis identified a series of block faults as a common barrier to dispersal for both <b>garter</b> <b>snakes,</b> and ecological correlates were found to be more similar among response variables than within species. I then compared degree of genetic differentiation at quantitative traits with that at neutral markers to infer strength of selection and adaptive divergence between two ecotypes of T. elegans. Selection on most traits was relatively weak, but strong diversifying selection was found for background coloration, total number of ventral scales and number of infralabials. Overall, my research documented ecological and evolutionary processes associated with population differentiation in a metacommunity and respresents an important contribution toward the unification of ecology and evolutionary biology...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Although mercury (Hg) is a well-studied contaminant, {{knowledge}} about Hg accumulation in snakes is limited.

Total Hg (THg) concentrations in northern watersnake tail tissue at the contaminated site ranged from 2. 25 to 13. 84 mg/kg dry weight (mean: 4. 85 0. 29), or 11 to 19 times higher than reference sites. Blood THg concentrations (0. 03 – 7. 04 mg/kg wet wt; mean: 2. 24 0. 42) were strongly correlated with tail concentrations and were the highest yet reported in a snake species. Within watersnakes, nitrogen stable isotope values indicated ontogenetic trophic shifts that correlated with THg bioaccumulation, suggesting that diet plays a substantial role in Hg exposure. Female watersnakes had higher mean THg concentrations (5. 67 0. 46 mg/kg) than males (4. 93 0. 49 mg/kg), but {{no significant differences between}} sexes were observed after correcting for body size.

After raising captive-born snakes from divergent life-history ecotypes on thermal regimes mimicking natural habitat differences (2 # 2 experimental design of ecotype and thermal environment), we measured oxygen consumption rate at temperatures spanning the activity range of this species. We found ecotypic differences in the reaction norms of snakes across the measured range of temperatures and a temperature-dependent allometric relationship between mass and metabolic rate predicted by the metabolic-level boundaries hypothesis.

Finally, animals had similar physiological thermal responses to high-temperature exposure regardless of genetic background, suggesting that local adaptation has not resulted in fixed differences between ecotypes.
