5|$|A few {{deductions}} {{can also}} be made from the satellite communications. The first deduction {{that can be made}} from the satellite communications is that the aircraft remained operational until at least 08:19—seven hours after final contact was made <b>with</b> <b>air</b> traffic control over the South China Sea. The varying BFO values indicate the aircraft was moving at speed. The aircraft's SDU needs location and track information to keep its antenna pointed towards the satellite, so it {{can also be}} deduced that the aircraft's navigation system was operational.|$|E

5|$|All {{actinides}} are pyrophoric, {{especially when}} finely divided, that is, they spontaneously ignite upon reaction <b>with</b> <b>air.</b> The melting point of actinides {{does not have}} a clear dependence on the number of f-electrons. The unusually low melting point of neptunium and plutonium (~640°C) is explained by hybridization of 5f and 6d orbitals and the formation of directional bonds in these metals.|$|E

5|$|An oil tanker's {{inert gas}} system {{is one of}} the most {{important}} parts of its design. Fuel oil itself is very difficult to ignite, but its hydrocarbon vapors are explosive when mixed <b>with</b> <b>air</b> in certain concentrations. The purpose of the system is to create an atmosphere inside tanks in which the hydrocarbon oil vapors cannot burn.|$|E
5|$|An {{oxide layer}} forms around {{beryllium}} that prevents further reactions <b>with</b> <b>air</b> unless heated above 1000°C. Once ignited, beryllium burns brilliantly forming {{a mixture of}} beryllium oxide and beryllium nitride. Beryllium dissolves readily in non-oxidizing acids, such as HCl and diluted H2SO4, but not in nitric acid or water as this forms the oxide. This behavior {{is similar to that}} of aluminium metal. Beryllium also dissolves in alkali solutions.|$|E

5|$|Birds {{have one}} of the most complex {{respiratory}} systems of all animal groups. Upon inhalation, 75% of the fresh air bypasses the lungs and flows directly into a posterior air sac which extends from the lungs and connects <b>with</b> <b>air</b> spaces in the bones and fills them <b>with</b> <b>air.</b> The other 25% of the air goes directly into the lungs. When the bird exhales, the used air flows out of the lungs and the stored fresh air from the posterior air sac is simultaneously forced into the lungs. Thus, a bird's lungs receive a constant supply of fresh air during both inhalation and exhalation. Sound production is achieved using the syrinx, a muscular chamber incorporating multiple tympanic membranes which diverges from {{the lower end of the}} trachea; the trachea being elongated in some species, increasing the volume of vocalisations and the perception of the bird's size.|$|E
5|$|Boisselier {{became the}} {{scientific}} director of Clonaid, an organization founded by Raël {{that sought to}} clone humans, in 1997. That year, Boisselier was interviewed by Le Monde about her role in Clonaid, and she lost her position <b>with</b> <b>Air</b> Liquide after the company learned of this. Air Liquide stated that her termination was due to her holding dual employment, {{and that she was}} strained by her Clonaid service. She filed a lawsuit against Air Liquide, arguing that she was the victim of religious discrimination. Her suit was successful: in 1999, she won a judgment of about US$30,000.|$|E
5|$|Boranes are {{chemical}} compounds of boron and hydrogen, with the generic formula of BxHy. These compounds {{do not occur}} in nature. Many of the boranes readily oxidise on contact <b>with</b> <b>air,</b> some violently. The parent member BH3 is called borane, but it is known only in the gaseous state, and dimerises to form diborane, B2H6. The larger boranes all consist of boron clusters that are polyhedral, some of which exist as isomers. For example, isomers of B20H26 {{are based on the}} fusion of two 10-atom clusters.|$|E

The divers swim with a half mask and fins and are supplied <b>with</b> <b>air</b> from an industrial low-pressure air compressor on the boat through plastic tubes. There is no reduction valve; the diver holds the hose end in his mouth with no demand valve or mouthpiece and allows excess air to spill out between the lips.|$|E
5|$|Copper, zinc, tin, {{and lead}} are {{mechanically}} weaker metals but have useful corrosion prevention properties. While {{each of them}} will react <b>with</b> <b>air,</b> the resulting patinas of either various copper salts, zinc carbonate, tin oxide, or a mixture of lead oxide, carbonate, and sulfate, confer valuable protective properties. Copper and lead are therefore used, for example, as roofing materials; zinc acts as an anti-corrosion agent in galvanised steel; and tin serves a similar purpose on steel cans.|$|E
5|$|Environmental {{issues have}} been on the {{national}} agenda since 1970. Environmental controversies include debates on oil and nuclear energy, dealing <b>with</b> <b>air</b> and water pollution, the economic costs of protecting wildlife, logging and deforestation, and international responses to global warming. Many federal and state agencies are involved. The most prominent is the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), created by presidential order in 1970. The idea of wilderness has shaped the management of public lands since 1964, with the Wilderness Act. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 is intended to protect threatened and endangered species and their habitats, which are monitored by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.|$|E
