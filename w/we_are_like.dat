5|$|November 27, 1888: Petition {{from the}} King of Rurutu and the Queen of Rimatara and their nobles to Her Most Gracious Majesty Queen Victoria, {{and to the}} Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. May you have good health. We, Teuruarii, King of Rurutu and Te Maere, Queen of Rimatara and our nobles, ask for the Prime Minister to place our islands and our ships under the {{protection}} of the British flag. These are the islands, namely, Rurutu, Rimatara, and Marià, and there are the names of the ships: Faaito and Ronui, and the masters of the same are natives. This is our word to you: Do not forsake us; we are your children; you taught us the word of God, and that has led us in the path of civilisation; therefore we know that you are a good parent to us. The thoughts of the children cling fondly to their good parent; they do not wish to be separated from their good parent. If the parent forsake the children, the children will seek the parent; so do we; <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>like</b> those children, and we ask that you will give us your flag to protect us. We have heard that you have taken Rarotonga and the neighbouring islands under your protection, but we remain without anyone to protect us. When we received the news that Rarotonga and the neighbouring islands were placed under your protection, we wept aloud because we were forsaken by you; we were afraid lest we should be adopted by another parent. The strange parent we mean is the French. They did not feed us with the milk of the gospel, but you did. O Great Britain; you fed us with that milk which has given life to us. This is our last word to you; we do not wish for French annexation or protection, not at all, but we wish you to be our parent, O Great Britain. We pray you now to accede to this our request. This letter was written in the house of Queen Pa. -TEURUARII, TE MAERE ARII.|$|E

500|$|To {{complete}} the band, Max chose Soulfly guitarist Marc Rizzo and vocalist Joe Duplantier of Gojira. Rizzo was his choice because, according to Max, he and Rizzo [...] "play together in Soulfly and musically <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>like</b> twin brothers". Max {{also said that}} he talked to Rizzo about going back to the roots of the mid-1980s thrash metal, which he did with Sepultura. Max continues, [...] "Marc was completely into it and he did great. He surpassed what I asked him to do." [...] Max stated that Duplantier was Gloria's idea, as he did not know him at all. He added, [...] "We had no idea who the guy is, he's from a different continent and we don't speak French. I did know the Gojira CD. But I like the element of surprise and danger Joe brought." ...|$|E

That wasn't what <b>we</b> {{initially}} thought <b>was</b> gonna be the first single, you know, when <b>we</b> <b>were</b> writing. I mean, the song came together and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>like,</b> 'You know, this one's really cool,' and then the label came in and <b>were</b> <b>like,</b> 'We want to put this one out first,' and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>like,</b> 'Really?'

500|$|The plan of a Spice Girls' reunion {{was first}} {{confirmed}} by Mel B in June 2005. She stated, [...] "We'll {{get back together}} because we all want to. I know everyone is up for it. There {{is going to be}} a greatest hits album and we've got loads of new songs that nobody has heard yet." [...] On 28 June 2007, the group held a press conference at The O2 Arena revealing their intention to reunite. During the conference, the group confirmed their intention to embark upon a worldwide concert tour, starting in Vancouver on 2 December 2007.

500|$|When {{asked in}} an {{interview}} with Direct Lyrics {{about the possibility of a}} collaboration with Inna in July 2014, Stan said that, [...] "Yes, I do know Inna; we've met at different concerts and other events! I really respect what she's been doing lately and would definitely be open to a collaboration!" [...] On 18 October 2014, Inna uploaded a video on her YouTube channel called [...] "New Music Preview (2014)", where she teased six upcoming songs, including a demo version of [...] "We Wanna", which incorporated some modified lyrics, and did only feature Inna's vocals. Particularly, it was revealed that the track has been originally composed for her, but she accepted offering the recording to Stan, in order to relaunch her in the music industry. About their collaboration, the latter singer stated that, [...] "I think <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>like</b> a delicious vanilla-chocolate milkshake, which you simply cannot get enough from." [...] "We Wanna" [...] was made available for digital download on 8 June 2016—near Stan's birthday on 10 June—through Roton, Fonogram and Global Records. Besides of being featured on Stan's third studio album, Alesta (2016), the song was also added to the track list of some editions of Unlocked (2014) and Inna (2015).|$|E

But when ants come together, they can move mountains." ...|$|E
5000|$|Initially, the two {{artists were}} going to release their joint project as a free mixtape. However, the {{resulting}} sessions exceeded expectations. 9th Wonder explained, [...] "When we did the first three songs, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>like,</b> 'Man, <b>we</b> ain't giving this jam away.' It <b>was</b> <b>like,</b> 'Man, this <b>is</b> really some good music.' Then {{about four or five}} records in, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>like,</b> 'Oh boy, <b>we</b> can't give this away'." [...] Subsequently, the pair decided to develop their project into a full-length album.|$|R
5000|$|So for {{the first}} game, {{everybody}} got paid. Elissa Steamer, myself Reynolds, whoever else <b>was</b> in it, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> laughing—we got <b>like</b> one check for royalties that <b>was</b> <b>like</b> US$190,000 or something. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>like</b> what!

5000|$|Grier {{said the}} title of the album was {{suggested}} by drummer, Jeremy Hanson, who liked the idea of Walk It Off. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>like</b> oh, that sounds cool. At that point we had thrown around a lot of stuff and nothing had really passed it, so it <b>was</b> <b>like</b> all right, lets go with that. It could be so many different things, and taken so many different ways, and then we realized like three weeks later that theres a lyric in the second-to-last song, [...] "Lines", where we actually say [...] "walk it off."

With Admiral Robert Blake blockading the remaining Royalist fleet under Prince Rupert of the Rhine in Kinsale, Cromwell landed on 15 August with thirty-five ships filled with troops and equipment. Henry Ireton landed two days later with a further seventy-seven ships.|$|E

"For {{the present}} our cheap {{supplies}} of coal, and our skill in its employment, {{and the freedom}} of our commerce with other wide lands, render us independent of the limited agricultural area of these islands, and take {{us out of the}} scope of Malthus' doctrine. We are growing rich and numerous upon a source of wealth of which the fertility does not yet apparently decrease with our demands upon it. Hence the uniform and extraordinary rate of growth which this country presents. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>like</b> settlers spreading in a rich new country of which the boundaries are yet unknown and unfelt." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Japan, in {{the early}} 1960s, a toy called Dakkochan became hugely popular. Dakkochan was a black child with large red lips and a grass skirt. There were boy and girl dolls, with the girls being {{distinguished}} by a bow. The black skin of the dolls {{was said to have}} been significant and in-line with the rising popularity of jazz. Novelist Tensei Kawano went as far as to state, [...] "We of the younger generation are outcasts from politics and society. In a way <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>like</b> Negroes, who have a long record of oppression and misunderstanding, and we feel akin to them." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "When {{he got to}} the part, 'Now she's a cool cool black,' {{he could}} {{actually}} hit those notes. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>like,</b> 'Oh my God! This is awesome!'" [...] Bergstrom recalls with a laugh. [...] "So you had that feeling, 'Here's this kid. He's got a great sounding voice. He's cool. He could sing on key. And he also had good range and he was soulful, though he was just a raw beginner.' So we knew we had something special, and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>like</b> in heaven from then, man.

2500|$|The {{presidency}} banks dominated banking in India {{but there}} were also some exchange banks and a number of Indian joint stock banks. All these banks operated in different segments of the economy. The exchange banks, mostly owned by Europeans, concentrated on financing foreign trade. Indian joint stock banks were generally under capitalised and lacked the experience and maturity to compete with the presidency and exchange banks. This segmentation let Lord Curzon to observe, [...] "In respect of banking it seems we are behind the times. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>like</b> some old fashioned sailing ship, divided by solid wooden bulkheads into separate and cumbersome compartments." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{his view}} on Russia {{and its history}} Bunin for a while had {{much in common with}} A. K. Tolstoy (of whom he spoke with great respect); both tended to idealise the pre-Tatar Rus. Years later he greatly {{modified}} his view of Russian history, forming a more negative outlook. [...] "There are two streaks in our people: one dominated by Rus, another by Chudh and Merya. Both have in them a frightening instability, sway... As Russian people say of themselves: <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>like</b> wood— both club and icon may come of it, depending on who is working on this wood," [...] Bunin wrote years later.|$|E
2500|$|Virgil {{eventually}} convinces Johanna true {{love can}} overcome their social differences, and he asks the emperor {{for her hand}} in marriage. This is the crucial scene in the picture, and brings the otherwise lightweight movie plot to a higher level. The Emperor is cordial and fatherly with Virgil, and treats him with respect and even a bit of admiration. But he is certain Johanna could never be happy living in Newark, New Jersey. [...] "We are not better than you," [...] explains the Emperor sadly, [...] "I think perhaps you are better than us. But <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>like</b> snails: If you take us out of our majestic shells, we die." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "My Machines": [...] "The {{title was}} taken from the lyrics of Gary Numan. I {{remember}} John saying 'We should totally ask Gary Numan to sing on the album' which was a total shot in the dark because we didn't think there was any way of getting him to be on the album. We drove up to Boston and he was playing The Pleasure Principle, and we got to see him after the show and it <b>was</b> bizarre... <b>like</b> us just stood outside his dressing room and his manager <b>was</b> <b>like</b> 'Okay, you want to come in and meet Gary?' and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>like</b> 'Yeah, that would <b>be</b> great', and <b>we</b> had a CD for him so we went in and he <b>was</b> <b>like</b> 'Hi, I'm Gary, pleased to meet you' and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>like</b> 'Hi, nice to meet you' and he said 'Yeah, I've listened to your track, I like it a lot... it's really fucking weird' and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>like</b> '...Gary Numan's telling us that we're weird' and it <b>was</b> <b>like</b> this <b>is</b> a moment I'm never going to forget.

2500|$|In March 2009, M.C. Hammer and Vanilla Ice had a one-off {{concert in}} the McKay Events Center, Orem, Utah. This concert aided in the {{promotion}} of Hammer's new music and television show. During the concert (as shown during an episode of Hammertime), it was mentioned between the two rappers that this was their first headline show together in nearly 20 years, since {{the time when they}} were touring together at the peak of their hip-hop careers. Hammer said: [...] "Contrary to popular belief, Ice and I are not only cool with each other, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>like</b> long lost friends. I've known him since he was 16, before he had a record contract and before I had a record contract. It is a great reunion." [...] Vanilla Ice, real name Robert Van Winkle, said: [...] "It's like no time has passed at all. We set the world on fire back in the day - it gives me goose bumps to think about. The concert wouldn't have been so packed if it wasn't us together. I'm so happy right now, the magic is here." ...|$|E
2500|$|The 1920s {{contained}} {{analysis of}} the poem that emphasised the poem's power. In Road to Xanadu (1927), a book length study of The Rime of the Ancient Mariner and [...] "Kubla Khan", John Livingston Lowes claimed that the poems were [...] "two {{of the most remarkable}} poems in English". When turning to the background of the works, he argued, [...] "Coleridge as Coleridge, be it said at once, is a secondary moment to our purpose; it is the significant process, not the man, which constitutes our theme. But the amazing modus operandi of his genius, in the fresh light which I hope I have to offer, becomes the very abstract and brief chronicle of the procedure of the creative faculty itself." [...] After breaking down the various aspects of the poem, Lowes stated, [...] "with a picture of unimpaired and thrilling vividness, the fragment ends. And with it ends, for all save Coleridge, the dream. 'The earth hath bubbles as the water has, and this is of them.' For 'Kubla Khan' is as near enchantment, I suppose, as <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>like</b> to come in this dull world. And over it is cast the glamour, enhanced beyond all reckoning in the dream, of the remote in time and space – that visionary presence of a vague and gorgeous and mysterious Past which brooded, as Coleridge read, above the inscrutable Nile, and domed pavilions in Cashmere, and the vanished stateliness of Xanadu." [...] He continued by describing the power of the poem: [...] "For none of the things which we have seen – dome, river, chasm, fountain, caves of ice, or floating hair – nor any combination of them holds the secret key to that sense of an incommunicable witchery which pervades the poem. That is something more impalpable by far, into which entered who can tell what tracelesss, shadowy recollections ... The poem is steeped in the wonder of all Coleridge's enchanted voyagings." [...] Lowes then concluded about the two works: [...] "Not even in the magical four and fifty lines of 'Kubla Khan' is sheer visualizing energy so intensely exercised as in 'The Ancient Mariner.' But every crystal-clear picture there, {{is an integral part of}} a preconceived and consciously elaborated whole ... In 'Kubla Khan' the linked and interweaving images irresponsibly and gloriously stream, like the pulsing, fluctuating banners of the North. And their pageant is as aimless as it is magnificent ... There is, then ... one glory of 'Kubla Khan' and another glory of 'The Ancient Mariner,' as one star differeth from another star in glory." [...] George Watson, in 1966, claimed that Lowes's {{analysis of the}} poems [...] "will stand as a permanent monument to historical criticism." [...] Also in 1966, Kenneth Burke, declared, [...] "Count me among those who would view this poem both as a marvel, and as 'in principle' finished" ...|$|E
