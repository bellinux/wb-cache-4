5|$|Since {{the club}} was founded, there have been 30 managers. The honours won by the club under each manager's {{stewardship}} are also detailed. As of {{the start of the}} 2017 season, 28 men have held the post of Malmö FF manager, the most successful of whom in terms of trophies won is Bob Houghton, who, as manager between 1974 and 1980, led the club to three Swedish league championships and four Svenska Cupen wins. The manager who has won most national league titles with the club is Antonio Durán, who won Allsvenskan four times between 1964 and 1971. Although Roy Hodgson led Malmö FF to the Allsvenskan crown five times in a row between 1985 and 1989, the national championship was decided by a championship play-off during this time, and Malmö FF only won this in 1986 and 1988. Houghton is the club's longest-serving manager, having occupied the position between 1990 and 1992 in addition to the aforementioned period, giving him a total of 10 years in charge. The current manager of Malmö FF is Magnus Pehrsson, <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>at</b> the club since 23 November 2016.|$|E
