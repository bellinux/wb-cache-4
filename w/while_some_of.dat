5|$|Betts was one {{of several}} {{longtime}} editors to leave Vogue around the new millennium. A year later, Sykes, another putative successor, left to concentrate on her best-selling novels set in the city's upper classes and a screenplay. A number of other editors also left to assume the top jobs at other publications. <b>While</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> their replacements didn't last, a new group of core editors formed.|$|E
5|$|Takalik Abaj was a {{sizeable}} city {{with the principal}} architecture clustered into four main groups spread across nine terraces. <b>While</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> these were natural features, others were artificial constructions requiring an enormous investment in labour and materials. The site featured a sophisticated water drainage system and a wealth of sculptured monuments.|$|E

5|$|Another {{round of}} green flag pit stops began on lap 203 when Truex made a pit stop; Kenseth {{was the first}} of the leaders to pit the {{following}} lap. On lap 208, Jeff Gordon became the new race leader after Biffle came into pit road. After pit stops, Biffle reclaimed the top position. On lap 220, the third caution was given as Ambrose's car suffered an engine failure. Jeff Gordon and Martin stayed out, <b>while</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the leaders came to pit road.|$|E

5|$|Constantine {{made some}} new laws {{regarding}} the Jews, but <b>while</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> his edicts were unfavorable towards Jews, {{they were not}} harsher than those of his predecessors. It was made illegal for Jews to seek converts or to attack other Jews who had converted to Christianity. They were forbidden to own Christian slaves or to circumcise their slaves. On the other hand, Jewish clergy were given the same exemptions as Christian clergy.|$|E
5|$|Druitt rented legal {{chambers}} at 9 King's Bench Walk in the Inner Temple. In {{the late}} Victorian era only the wealthy could afford legal action, {{and only one}} in eight qualified barristers {{was able to make}} a living from the law. <b>While</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> Druitt's biographers claim his practice did not flourish, others suppose that it provided him with a relatively substantial income {{on the basis of his}} costly lease of chambers and the value of his estate at death. He is listed in the Law List of 1886 as active in the Western Circuit and Winchester Sessions, and for 1887 in the Western Circuit and Hampshire, Portsmouth and Southampton Assizes.|$|E
5|$|Helmets made {{entirely of}} bronze were also used, <b>while</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> them had large cheek guards, {{probably}} stitched or riveted to the helmet, {{as well as}} an upper pierced knot to hold a crest. Small holes all around the cheek guards and the helmet's lower edge were used for the attachment of internal padding. Other types of bronze helmets were also used. During the late Mycenaean period, additional types were also used such as horned helmets made of strips of leather.|$|E

5|$|In the United Kingdom a {{total of}} 4100ha were planted with bulbs, of which 3800ha were Narcissi, the UK's most {{important}} bulb crop, much of which is for export, making this the largest global production centre, {{about half of the}} total production area. <b>While</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the production is for forcing, most is for dry bulb production. Bulb production and forcing occurs in the East, while production in the south west is mainly for outdoor flower production. The farm gate value was estimated at £10m in 2007.|$|E
5|$|On 9 December 1941, No. 6 Commando, {{along with}} a {{detachment}} from No. 12 Commando and some Norwegian soldiers, took part in Operation Kitbag, a raid on the town of Florø in Norway. Embarking on the HMS Prince Charles, an infantry landing ship, they set out from Scapa Flow. During the voyage an incident occurred <b>while</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the men were priming grenades for the raid which resulted in six men being killed and another 11 seriously wounded. Nevertheless, {{the decision was made}} to continue with the raid, although it was eventually called off when the naval commander was unable to locate the fjord upon which Florø was located due to navigational difficulties.|$|E
5|$|The {{black vulture}} {{appears in a}} variety of Maya hieroglyphics in Mayan codices. It is {{normally}} connected with either death or as a bird of prey. The vulture's glyph is often shown attacking humans. This species lacks the religious connections that the king vulture has. <b>While</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the glyphs clearly show the black vulture's open nostril and hooked beak, some are assumed to be this species because they are vulture-like but lack the king vulture's knob and are painted black. This vulture has appeared on two stamps: those of Guyana in 1990 and Nicaragua in 1994.|$|E

5|$|The city's {{accounts}} {{show the}} details of the payments for the construction of the tower between 1398 and 1399, including charges for 36,850 bricks, stone, sand, lime, a hoist and various equipment. At least 170 cartloads of stone are mentioned, and the bricks may have been brought to the site along the river by boat, <b>while</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the timber was brought from Great Yarmouth. The total cost of the building from these records, including labour, came to around £36. The number of bricks used in the tower, however, was probably twice the listed number purchased, and the city may therefore already have stockpiled some bricks on the location before the build.|$|E
5|$|The {{collection}} saw graphical {{and musical}} revisions {{and is based}} on the international versions of both games, making certain content accessible to players outside of Japan for the first time. The collection sold favorably in Japan and the west, and has received positive reviews in western territories. Many praised the graphical upgrade and the chance to play through the games on the new platforms. The collection did receive criticism for a few minor upgrade faults and uneven quality between the two, <b>while</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the collection's added content drew mixed opinions. The minor upgrade faults and uneven quality were fixed in the PlayStation 4 version.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of infinitesimal calculus {{was at the}} forefront of 18th-century mathematical research, and the Bernoullis—family friends of Euler—were responsible for much of the early progress in the field. Thanks to their influence, studying calculus became the major focus of Euler's work. <b>While</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> Euler's proofs are not acceptable by modern standards of mathematical rigour (in particular his reliance on the principle of the generality of algebra), his ideas led to many great advances.|$|E

The White Cloud Mountains are underlain by the gray granodiorite of the Idaho batholith, <b>while</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the exposed rock is baked impure limestone from the Permian Grand Prize Formation.|$|E
5|$|The {{opening of}} the Protestant German Basel Mission of 1834 in Mangalore brought many {{handicraft}} industries, such as cotton weaving and tile-manufacturing, to the region {{and led to a}} large-scale rise in employment. In 1836–37, the political situation in Portugal was in turmoil. Antonio Feliciano de Santa Rita Carvalho, a Portuguese priest, was appointed Archbishop-elect of Goa in September 1836 without authorisation from the then Pope, Gregory XVI. Many Mangalorean Catholics did not accept the leadership of Carvalho but instead submitted to the Vicar Apostolic of Verapoly in Travancore, <b>while</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> them continued to be {{under the jurisdiction of the}} Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Goa and Daman. The parishes in South Canara were divided into two groups—one under Goa and the other under Verapoly.|$|E
