500|$|Kaling {{cast her}} own mother and father, a doctor and an {{architect}} respectively, as the parents of her character. Kaling was proud of their acting, though she admitted that their presence on set was at first [...] "mortifying." [...] She commented, [...] "Of course I sort of lapsed back into that pre-teen attitude of every single thing my parents do embarrasses me. But they were great about it. They were such pros – they had all these scenes with Steve Carell and they were completely unafraid. They got along effortlessly." [...] Kaling injected elements of Romeo and Juliet and Pride and Prejudice into her character's relationship with Ryan, with her parents attempting to persuade her to date an Indian doctor. She remarked, [...] "Kelly's family has, like, nine daughters, and if only they could marry them off it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>wonderful.</b> But Kelly is {{the oldest and most}} idiotic of them all." ...|$|E
500|$|Ede Teller {{was born}} on January 15, 1908, in Budapest, Hungary (then part of Austria-Hungary), into a Jewish family. His parents were Ilona (born Deutsch), a pianist, and Max Teller, an attorney. He later became an agnostic. [...] "Religion {{was not an issue}} in my family", he later wrote, [...] "indeed, it was never discussed. My only {{religious}} training came because the Minta required that all students take classes in their respective religions. My family celebrated one holiday, the Day of Atonement, when we all fasted. Yet my father said prayers for his parents on Saturdays and on all the Jewish holidays. The idea of God that I absorbed was that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>wonderful</b> if He existed: We needed Him desperately but had not seen Him in many thousands of years." [...] Like Einstein and Feynman, Teller was a late talker. He developed the ability to speak later than most children but became very interested in numbers, and would calculate large numbers in his head for fun.|$|E
500|$|Rado {{described}} {{the inspiration for}} Hair as [...] "a combination of some characters we met in the streets, people we knew and our own imaginations. [...] We knew this group of kids in the East Village who were dropping out and dodging the draft, and there were also lots of articles in the press about how kids were being kicked {{out of school for}} growing their hair long". [...] He recalled, [...] "There was so much excitement in the streets and the parks and the hippie areas, and we thought if we could transmit this excitement to the stage it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>wonderful....</b> We hung out with them and went to their Be-Ins [...] let our hair grow." [...] Many cast members (Shelley Plimpton in particular) were recruited right off the street. [...] Rado said, [...] "It was very important historically, and if we hadn't written it, there'd not be any examples. [...] You could read about it and see film clips, but you'd never experience it. [...] We thought, 'This is happening in the streets,' and we wanted to bring it to the stage." ...|$|E

2500|$|Irwin {{said in an}} {{interview}} in 2000 that the greatest disappointment of his career was not at the British Open, but at the 1984 U.S. Open at Winged Foot. Irwin had led the tournament after the first three rounds, but shot a final round of 79 to finish 6th. Reflecting on his final round collapse, Irwin said: [...] "A number of factors were in play and it was very emotional. I thought it would be great to win 10 years later at the same venue and, more than anything else, my father was dying of cancer then and I thought it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>wonderful</b> to give him a victory. I destroyed myself with the pressures I'd built up." ...|$|E
2500|$|While {{there have}} been no {{proposals}} to restore Amtrak service to Nashville, {{there have been}} repeated calls from residents. However, Tennessee state officials have advised it will not be happening anytime soon due to scarce federal funding. [...] "It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>wonderful</b> to say I can be in Memphis and jump on a train to Nashville, but the volume of people who would do that isn't anywhere close to what the cost would be to provide the service," [...] said Ed Cole, chief of environment and planning with the Tennessee Department of Transportation. Ross Capon, executive director of the National Association of Railroad Passengers, said rail trips would catch on if routes were expanded, but conceded that it would be nearly impossible to resume Amtrak service to Nashville without a substantial investment from the state because federal money has dried up.|$|E
2500|$|Amy Sherman-Palladino, {{who came}} from a {{background}} of writing for half-hour sitcoms, had Gilmore Girls approved by The WB after several of her previous pitches were turned down. On a whim, she suggested a show about a mother and daughter but had put little thought into the idea. Having to create a pilot, she drew inspiration for the show's setting of [...] "Stars Hollow, Connecticut" [...] after making a trip to Washington Depot, Connecticut, where she stayed at the Mayflower Inn. She explained: [...] "If I can make people feel this much of what I felt walking around this fairy town, I thought that <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>wonderful</b> ... At the time I was there, it was beautiful, it was magical, and it was feeling of warmth and small-town camaraderie ... There was a longing for that in my own life, and I thought—that's something that I would really love to put out there." ...|$|E

2500|$|The 20th century {{historian}} of Paris René Héron de Villefosse {{shared the same}} view of Haussmann's renovation: [...] "in less than twenty years, Paris lost its ancestral appearance, its [...] character which passed from generation to generation... the picturesque and charming ambiance which our fathers had passed onto us was demolished, often without good reason." [...] Héron de Villefosse denounced Haussmann's central market, Les Halles, as [...] "a hideous eruption" [...] of cast iron. [...] Describing Haussmann's renovation of the Île de la Cité, he wrote: [...] "the old ship of Paris was torpedoed by Baron Haussmann and sunk during his reign. It was perhaps the greatest crime of the megalomaniac prefect and also his biggest mistake...His work caused more damage than a hundred bombings. It was in part necessary, and one should {{give him credit for}} his self-confidence, but he was certainly lacking culture and good taste...In the United States, it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>wonderful,</b> but in our capital, which he covered with barriers, scaffolds, gravel, and dust for twenty years, he committed crimes, errors, and showed bad taste." ...|$|E
2500|$|On April 14, 2012, former Guns N' Roses members Slash, Duff McKagan, Gilby Clarke, Steven Adler and Matt Sorum all reunited at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The group {{performed}} [...] "Mr. Brownstone", [...] "Sweet Child o' Mine", and [...] "Paradise City" [...] with Alter Bridge and Slash's band vocalist Myles Kennedy in Rose's absence. Slash {{mentioned in}} an interview that [...] "All things considered, I don't think any of us {{wanted to be a part}} of it initially, didn't think any of us were going to go. It was a thorn in everybody's—well, at least a thorn in my side—because I was busy doing other stuff. When it finally came down to the wire at the very, very, very last-minute—I'm talking about the 11 hours and 30 seconds mark—Axl had pulled out." [...] In the same interview, Slash mentioned the prospects of a reunion, stating [...] "It's not even something I like to dwell on. I don't even like to make comments because you end up with quotes that sometimes exacerbate the issue. I've got other things going on. I'm very, very proud—endlessly proud—of everything the band stood for and everything that's gone on with it." [...] Slash then stated in a July 2012 interview that [...] " [...] will 'never reunite'". In a later interview, former drummer Steven Adler stated that Matt Sorum would not take part in a potential reunion unless Adler was involved. Duff McKagan said in 2015, [...] " [...] could happen, and it could not. And I think it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>wonderful,</b> one day, if we reconciled, first and foremost.

The brick-walled street echoed with jagged cries of children; tired women in mussed waists poked their red, steamy necks out of windows; the sky was a blur of gray; and, lest she forget the job, Una's left wrist ached from typing; yet she heard the rustle of spring, and her spirit swelled with thankfulness as she felt her life to be not a haphazard series of days, but a divine progress.|$|E
60|$|In short, {{while it}} would be {{difficult}} in any given case to prove to a certainty either that the particular toad-in-a-hole had or had not access to air and food, the ordinary conditions of toad life are exactly those under which the delusive appearance of venerable antiquity would be almost certain frequently to arise. The toad is a nocturnal animal; it lives through the daytime in dark and damp places; it shows a decided liking for crannies and crevices; it is wonderfully tenacious of life; it possesses the power of hibernation; it can live on extremely small quantities of food for very long periods of time together; it buries itself in mud or clay; it passes the early part of its life as a water-haunting tadpole; and last, not least, it can swell out its body to nearly double its natural size by inflating itself, which fully accounts for the stories of toads being taken out of holes every bit as big as themselves. Considering all these things, it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>wonderful</b> indeed if toads were not often found in places and conditions which would naturally give rise to the familiar myth. Throw in a little allowance for human credulity, human exaggeration, and human love of the marvellous, and you have all the elements of a very excellent toad-in-the-hole in the highest ideal perfection.|$|E
6000|$|... [I reply] The scripture say not so {{word for}} word, but thus: [...] "Because that {{which might be}} known of God, was {{manifested}} in them."

But how then doth it say, that the knowledge of God is manifested in them? Why, because God hath shewed it unto them by the things that are made, even by the creation of the world. so that this scripture holdeth forth thus much; that the invisible things of God, as his power, holiness, and common goodness to the sons of men are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made. But how feeble an argument is this, to prove such a doctrine as this: That every one hath the Spirit when this light discovers God only by his works in the world. Friend, if they that know God, because he doth shew himself to them by his works in the world, have the Spirit of Christ, then the same argument will serve to speak thus much; that the devils themselves have the Spirit of Christ, which <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>wonderful</b> blasphemy once to affirm. And friend, the very devils, both for the knowledge of sin, and also for the knowledge of God's eternal power and Godhead, have more experience than all the unregenerate men in the world; and yet have not the least spark of the Spirit of Christ in them.|$|E
