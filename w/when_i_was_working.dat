[...] Morrison related how [...] "A {{friend of mine}} had drawings in his flat of astral projection. I was at his house <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>working</b> on a song which began, 'If I venture down the slipstream' and that's why I called it 'Astral Weeks'." [...] "It was a painting," [...] McCartney corrects. [...] "There were several paintings in the studio at the time. Van looked at the painting and it suggested astral travelling to him." [...] The album cover photograph of Van Morrison was taken by Joel Brodsky, {{best known for his}} [...] "Young Lions" [...] photoshoot with [...] Jim Morrison. The squared circle in the cover photo is described as portraying [...] "the mystic symbol of the union of opposites; the sacred marriage of heaven and earth".|$|E

2500|$|Edith Grossman, {{who wrote}} and {{published}} a highly acclaimed English {{translation of the}} novel in 2003, says that the book is mostly meant to move people into emotion using a systematic change of course, {{on the verge of}} both tragedy and comedy at the same time. Grossman has stated:The question is that Quixote has multiple interpretations [...] and how do I deal with that in my translation. I'm going to answer your question by avoiding it [...] so when I first started reading the Quixote I thought it was the most tragic book in the world, and I would read it and weep [...] As I grew older [...] my skin grew thicker [...] and so <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>working</b> on the translation I was actually sitting at my computer and laughing out loud. This is done [...] as Cervantes did it [...] by never letting the reader rest. You are never certain that you truly got it.

2500|$|Gooch's {{commitment}} to England cricket and {{passion for the}} game remains. When commenting on the new England coaching role he said: [...] "It {{came out of the}} blue. I met Andy at Trent Bridge <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>working</b> for radio and I was a bit surprised when he asked me to do it. But you spend your career trying to do your bit for England and when you're asked to help again the call of your country is special.". He has since remained as England's batting coach on a permanent basis, continuing this role for the 2010 series against Bangladesh and Pakistan, and the winter Ashes series against Australia in Australia. Double-centurion Alastair Cook (at the first test at the Gabba in Brisbane) hailed Gooch's influence on England's and his own batting prowess. Gooch subsequently has supervised England's batting (or 'run-scoring', as Ian Bell has noted Gooch refers to it) throughout their rise to number 1 in the Test cricket ICC Rankings. Prior to Gooch taking over, English batsmen had scored 6 test double-centuries in 15 years. 15 months after he became the batting coach, England had already beaten that total.|$|E

2500|$|Although details, {{such as the}} superlaser's location, shifted between {{different}} concept models during production of Star Wars, {{the notion of the}} Death Star being a large, spherical space station over 100 kilometers in diameter was consistent in all of them. George Lucas gave the original task of designing a [...] "Death Star" [...] to concept artist and spaceship modeler Colin Cantwell, who had collaborated with Stanley Kubrick on the 1968 film [...] In a 2016 interview, Cantwell related that [...] "I didn't originally plan for the Death Star to have a trench, but <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>working</b> with the mold, I noticed the two halves had shrunk at the point where they met across the middle." [...] As it [...] "would have taken a week of work just to fill and sand and refill this depression," [...] Cantwell suggested a trench to Lucas to save the labor. Lucas liked the idea, and the Death Star model was created by John Stears. The buzzing sound counting down to the Death Star firing its superlaser comes from the Flash Gordon serials. Portraying an incomplete yet powerful space station posed a problem for Industrial Light & Magic's modelmakers for Return of the Jedi. Only the front side of the 137-centimeter model was completed, and the image was flipped horizontally for the final film. Both Death Stars were depicted by a combination of complete and sectional models and matte paintings.|$|E
