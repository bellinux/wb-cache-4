50|$|Named after Mount Ainslie, Australian Capital Territory {{where their}} type {{location}} occurs, the Ainslie Volcanics {{are composed of}} Dacitic ignimbrite and minor volcaniclastic and argillaceous sediments. The lithology is bluish grey dacitic tuff, which can be massive or foliated, also dacitic agglomerate and shale. These volcanics contain chloritised cordierite and some have red almandine garnet. Jasper is found on low hills {{on the north side}} of the Molonglo River. The thickness is at least 700 metres. The magma was formed by melting an aluminiumrich pelitic sediment. The eruption came from a volcano into shallow sea water. The deposits built above sea level as they progressed. The underlying sediments now make up the Canberra Formation. Between Hall and Namina Hill on Spring Range, the Mount Painter Volcanics lie unconformably on top.These rocks date from the Late <b>Wenlockian</b> epoch of the Silurian period.

40|$|Silurian biotic {{crises in}} the graptolite community; the early <b>Wenlockian</b> Ireviken, mid <b>Wenlockian</b> Cyrtograptus lundgreni, and end <b>Wenlockian</b> Colonograptus ludensis {{extinction}} events. Positive δ 13 Corg excursions {{are associated with}} the Ireviken and C. lundgreni events, but not the Co. ludensis Event. The Ireviken and C. lundgreni excursions are rec-ognized worldwide and are herein interpreted {{to be the result of}} carbonate weathering in response to eustatic sea-level drop. The C. lundgreni excursion is of greater magnitude in the more proximal basin margin section at Abbott River, Cornwallis Island, and is explained by the amplification of a more strongly positive δ 13 C signature in shallower parts of an epeiric basin during increased exposure and weathering of the carbonate shelf. Excursion C 5, within the Co. praedeubeli – Co. deubeli Zone, is also of regional significance, as it occurs in both the Abbott River section and Twilight Creek section on Bathurst Island, and is also recognized in Estonia, Poland, and England. Excursion C 6 is recognized in the Gorstian Stage, yet its regional significance remains equivocal. There is a reasonable general agree-ment between the shape of the δ 13 Corg and δ 13 Ccarb curves, yet the δ 13 Ccarb curve is largely a record of detrital carbon-ate derived from the shelf. The δ 13 Corg curve represents extraction of dissolved inorganic carbon by plankton and thus is more indicative of ambient paleoceanographic conditions. These data are valuable in that they provide a detailed sec-ular marine δ 13 C curve for the <b>Wenlockian</b> of Arctic Canada from relatively unaltered sections of varying facies whose ages are well constrained by graptolite biostratigraphy...|$|E

40|$|The Silurian {{rocks of}} north-west Galway are a clastic {{sequence}} at least 2700 m thick resting unconformably on Connemara Schist (Dalradian) {{in the south}} and on Ordovlcian rocks in the north-east. The full thickness of Silurian is not seen, as in the west it is aver thrust by Ordoviclan strata, and in the east the younger beds have been removed by erosion. The earliest Silurian rocks (Upper Llandoverian) were probably deposited under terrestrial and deltaic conditions, and were followed by a transgression during which fossiliferous shallow marine sediments accumulated. The overlying <b>Wenlockian</b> succession consists of basal boulder beds and a great thickness (approximately 1500 m) of graded sandstones, passing up into shallow marine fossiliferous siltstone and sandstone. The youngest beds are sparsely-fossiliferous red siltstones and mudstones. The present study is limited to the <b>Wenlockian</b> rocks of the Killary Harbour area, i. e., those above the lowermost terrestrial and shallow marine deposits. The stratigraphy is revised, and new subdivisions proposed. The name Upper Owenduff Group (McKerrow and Campbell, 1960) is retained, but the upper limit of the group is redefined to exclude the upper fossiliferous shallow marine sediments and is divided into two new formations, the Lettergesh and the Glencraff, consisting dominantly of graded sandstones. A new group name, the Killary Harbour Group, is proposed for the uppermost shallow marine portions of the <b>Wenlockian.</b> It comprises the newly-defined fossiliferous Lough Muck Formation, and the Sal rock Formation, with its characteristic red beds [...] .

40|$|Paleomagnetic {{analyses}} of Silurian mafic volcanics from the overstep sequence of sedimentary and volcanic rocks deposited over the Central Mobile Belt {{of the northern}} Appalachians {{provide insight into the}} mid-Paleozoic tectonic history of the Laurentian margin. Stepwise thermal demagnetization of the subaerial mafic volcanics of the Ludlovian Fivemile Brook Formation of northwestern Maine reveals two ancient high-temperature, dual-polarity remanences. A tilt-corrected mean direction yields an inclination of 41 ° (~rl = 3. 9 °, N = 4 sites) and the magnetization is interpreted as a near-primary magnetization acquired well before the end of Early Devonian deformation. An in situ mean direction (D = 165 °, 1 = 35 °, ~gs = 6 °, k = 65, N = 10 entries from 8 sites), is interpreted as a secondary overprint with a pole (22 °S, 306 °E) near the Early Carboniferous segment of the North American apparent polar wander path (APWP). Conglomerate and fold tests of the high-temperature characteristic remanence preserved in <b>Wenlockian</b> subaerial mafic volcanics of the Bryant Point For-mation and a red bed of the South Charlo Formation, both of the Chaleur Group of northeastern New Brunswick, constrain paleolatitude and deformational ge. The inclination-only fold test peaks at 50 % unfolding with a mean inclination of- 35 ° (~ = 8. 5 °, n = 148). Synfolding acquisition of magnetization is <b>Wenlockian,</b> based on a negative conglomerate t st {{at the base of the}} section and a positive conglomerate t st at the top of the section. Clockwise streaking of site mean directions away from a predominantly northerly declination is consistent with post-middle <b>Wenlockian</b> dextral shear in the Chaleu...|$|E

40|$|During Silurian (Late <b>Wenlockian</b> to Ludlovian) {{time in the}} Cudgegong district, New South Wales, a minor {{regression}} {{is represented}} by local influx of clastic detritus and {{a brief period of}} subaerial exposure within a phase of carbonate deposition. Oolitic shoals, formed under shallow warm hypersaline marine conditions, became exposed on supratidal flats where minor dolomitization and gypsum crystallization took place.

40|$|The Baillie Hamilton fauna {{contains}} {{a mixture of}} both shallow water and deep water brachiopods brought together in debris flows. By using criteria such as taphonomy, abundance distribution, and the community framework concept, a total of 10 communities are recog-nized from the collection. These communities represent {{the northern end of}} the <b>Wenlockian</b> Cordilleran faunal belt. The Baillie Hamilton fauna belongs to the Uralian-Cordilleran Region. The high Affinity Index shared by the fauna and the coeval Eastern Great Basin fauna indicates that a gradual environmental gradient separates the Uralian-Cordilleran Region from the North American Province. Key words: Silurian, <b>Wenlockian,</b> brachiopods, paleoecology, paleobiogeography, community er group includes medium size and often thick-shelled forms. They are mostly disarticulated and not well pre-served, indicating a shallow-water environment with rel-atively high energy. T a p h o n o m y: Disarticulation and shell fragmentation {{can be used as a}} measure of the distance and mode of transportation. The small, thin-shelled brachiopods in the B-H fauna rarely show shell damage and usually have a relatively high articulation ratio even among forms with a weak deltidiodont type articulating mechanism. The relatively undisturbed nature of these species sug-gests that they are derived from a nearby source. They probably colonized slope and basinal environments close to the final burial site. These small shells are likely to be held in suspension in the fluid head portion of a de-bris flows during down slope transportation; thus they suffered little shell damage. The larger, thick-shelled brachiopods on the other hand are mostly disarticulat-ed and fragmentary. They bear the evident marks of more abrasive shallow-water and down slope transpor-tation...|$|E
40|$|Late <b>Wenlockian</b> (late mid-Silurian) life is {{characterized}} by three significant changes or bioevents: sudden development of massive carbonate reefs after a long interval of limited reef growth; sudden mass mortality among colonial zooplankton, graptolites; and origination of land plants with vascular tissue (Cooksonia). Both marine bioevents are short in duration and occur essentially simultaneously {{at the end of}} the Wenlock without any recorded major climatic change from the general global warm climate. These three disparate biologic events may be linked to sudden environmental change that could have resulted from sudden infusion of a massive amount of ammonia into the tropical ocean. Impact of a boloid or swarm of extraterrestrial bodies containing substantial quantities of a volatile (ammonia) component could provide such an infusion. Major carbonate precipitation (formation), as seen in the reefs as well as, to a more limited extent, in certain brachiopods, would be favored by increased pH resulting from addition of a massive quantity of ammonia into the upper ocean. Because of the buffer capacity of the ocean and dilution effects, the pH would have returned soon to equilibrium. Major proliferation of massive reefs ceased at the same time. Addition of ammonia as fertilizer to terrestrial environments in the tropics would have created optimum environmental conditions for development of land plants with vascular, nutrient-conductive tissue. Fertilization of terrestrial environments thus seemingly preceded development of vascular tissue by a short time interval. Although no direct evidence of impact of a volatile boloid may be found, the bioevent evidence is suggestive that such an impact in the oceans could have taken place. Indeed, in the case of an ammonia boloid, evidence, such as that of the Late <b>Wenlockian</b> bioevents may be the only available data for impact of such a boloid...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The Solund–Hyllestad–Lavik area affords an {{excellent}} opportunity to understand the ultrahigh-pressure Scandian orogeny because it contains a near-complete record of ophiolite emplacement, high-pressure metamorphism and large-scale extension. In this area, the Upper Allochthon was intruded by the c. 434 Ma Sogneskollen granodiorite and thrust eastward over the Middle ⁄ Lower Allochthon, probably in the <b>Wenlockian.</b> The Middle ⁄ Lower Allochthon was subducted to c. 50 km depth and the structurally lower Western Gneiss Complex was subducted to eclogite facies conditions at c. 80 km depth by c. 410 – 400 Ma. Within 100. Exhumation to upper crustal levels was complete by c. 403 Ma. The Solund fault produced the last few km of tectonic exhumation, bringing the near-ultrahigh-pressure rocks to within c. 3 km vertical distance from the low-grade Solund Conglomerate.

40|$|Samples were {{collected}} along a chronohorizon {{defined by the}} transition between the <b>Wenlockian</b> (Gleedon Chronozone) graptolite zones of Gothograptus nassa and Monograptus ludensis in several northern European localities to evaluate the influence of large scale provincialism and local habitat {{on the distribution of}} Chitinozoa. The distribution of Chitinozoa and several environmental parameters based on a number of palaeontological, chemical and physical variables were submitted to Q- and R-mode factor analyses. Provincialism does not seem to influence the distribution of Chitinozoa in the localities considered. The distribution of Conochitina is controlled by physicochemical factors related to bottom conditions; from this a benthonic habitat can be inferred. The distribution of Linochitina, Ancyrochitina and Sphaerochitina appears to be controlled by biological factors, independent of bottom conditions and thus indicating a planktonic habitat. The increase of Linochitina forms in a stratigraphic column is shown to represent a transgressive trend...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Pre-Silurian continental-margin {{deposits}} in western Norway, non-conformably overlying allochthonous continental orthogneisses retain Ordovician 40 Ar/ 39 Ar cooling ages for phengites, implying either rapid cooling immediately after a Late Ordovician orogenic event, or less likely, a slow cooling following an Early Ordovician or older orogeny. The Dalsfjord Suite–Høyvik Group basement–cover pair are probably a lateral equivalent to Late Proterozoic sandstones (‘sparagmites’) covering the Jotun Nappe gneisses of the Middle Allochthon in central-south Norway. The Høyvik Group underwent polyphase deformation, greenschist-facies metamorphism (Tmax < 450) C) and exhumation prior to deposition of the unconformably overlying <b>Wenlockian</b> continental-margin deposits of the Herland Group. The Høyvik Group was only weakly metamorphosed during obduction of the Solund–Stavfjord Ophiolite and the Scandian continental collision between Baltica and Laurentia. Phengitic white micas from the Høyvik Group yield cooling ages of 446. 1 & 3. 0, 449. 1 & 2. 2 and 447. 5 & 4. 0 Ma, respectively, identical within experimental error. One sample gives a plateau over 72 % {{of the gas}} analysed, whereas the other samples were slightly disturbed after initial cooling, as indicated by systematically lower apparent ages at low experimental extraction temperatures. Minor 40 Ar loss probably occurred during subsequent Scandian deformation and late to post-orogenic extension...|$|E
40|$|A general {{survey of}} the {{calcareous}} algae of the Silurian of the Welsh Border has been undertaken. The genera discovered during this investigation, and. so under consideration, are those of Girvanella, Rothpletzella, Solenopora and Rhabdoporella. Systematic descriptions are given for each, and their variation shown. Girvanella has been subdivided here into form-species, mostly new types, {{on the basis of}} character differences, combined with chronological, geographical and ecological fgotors. Both species of Rothpletzella together with a fine-tubed form and three species of Solenopora qre recorded. Only one species of Solenopora Ras originally known from this area and a second just outside. Rhabdoporella has been obtained from the <b>Wenlockian,</b> but was only previously recorded from the Llandovery of Meifod. The lateral and vertical distribution of each alga has been studied and as far as possible quantitative methods have also been used. These investigations have been in relation to the limestone facies and associated fauna. It is shown that algae, especially the filamentous forms, are much more abundant and are far more widespread than has been previously recorded. In some instances, their distribution appears to change less according to horizon level than to differences of limestone facies but others still appear to be of stratigraphical value. The abundant distribution of Solenopora and Rothpletzella species is mostly correlated with reef or reef-like conditions which existed during most of the limestone formation periods, but the distribution of the other genera is not thus correlated. The apparent preferences for different types at conditions by the various algae are indicated, and comparisons are made with the ecology of present day reefs...|$|E
