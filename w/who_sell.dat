5|$|In her interview, Swedish Detective Superintendent Kajsa Wahlberg {{describes}} purchasing sex from {{a prostitute}} as paying to masturbate into someone. The leader {{of an organization}} working to rescue girls from prostitution in Cambodia {{says that it is}} not the poorest parents <b>who</b> <b>sell</b> their children into sexual slavery but rather the parents who are looking to buy luxury goods. He therefore argues that sex trafficking is a spiritual and moral issue that cannot be solved by education or money. In another interview, a man purchasing sex in Thailand says that he believes the girls are happy to be working as prostitutes.
