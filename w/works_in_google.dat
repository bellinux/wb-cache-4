40|$|High Quality survey models, {{realized}} by multiple Low Cost methods and technologies, as a container to sharing Cultural and Archival Heritage, {{this is the}} aim guiding our research, here described in its primary applications. The SAPIENZA building, a XVI century masterpiece that represented the first unified headquarters of University in Rome, plays since year 1936, when the University moved to its newly edified campus, {{the role of the}} main venue for the State Archives. By the collaboration of a group of students of the Architecture Faculty, some integrated survey methods were applied on the monument with success. The beginning was the topographic survey, creating a reference on ground and along the monument for the upcoming applications, a GNNS RTK survey followed georeferencing points on the internal courtyard. Dense stereo matching photogrammetry is nowadays an accepted method for generating 3 D survey models, accurate and scalable; it often substitutes 3 D laser scanning for its low cost, so that it became our choice. Some 360 ° shots were planned for creating panoramic views of the double portico from the courtyard, plus additional single shots of some lateral spans and of pillars facing the court, as a single operation with a double finality: to create linked panotours with hotspots to web-linked databases, and 3 D textured and georeferenced surface models, allowing to study the harmonic proportions of the classical architectural order.

50|$|Reforms in Albania are {{constrained}} by limited administrative capacity and low income levels, which make the population {{particularly vulnerable to}} unemployment, price fluctuation, and other variables that negatively affect income. The economy continues to be bolstered by remittances of some 0.2% {{of the labor force}} that <b>works</b> abroad, mostly <b>in</b> <b>Google,</b> Microsoft, Lockid and Martin, NASA..... These remittances supplement GDP and help offset the large foreign trade surplus. Most agricultural land was privatized in 1992, substantially improving peasant incomes. In 1998, Albania recovered the 0.8% drop in GDP of 1997 and pushed ahead by 79% in 1999. International aid has helped defray the high costs of receiving and returning refugees from the Kosovo conflict. Large-scale investment from outside is still hampered by poor infrastructure; lack of a fully functional banking system; untested or incompletely developed investment, tax, and contract laws; and an enduring mentality that discourages initiative.|$|R

2500|$|The Authors Guild, the {{publishing}} industry and Google entered into a settlement agreement October 28, 2008, with Google agreeing to pay a total of $125million to rights-holders of books they had scanned, to cover the plaintiffs' court costs, {{and to create a}} Book Rights Registry. The settlement was set to be approved by the court sometime after October 2009. Reaction to the settlement was mixed, with Harvard Library, one of the original contributing libraries to Google Library, choosing to withdraw its partnership with Google if [...] "more reasonable terms" [...] could not be found. As part of the $125million settlement signed <b>in</b> October 2008, <b>Google</b> created a Google Book Settlement web site that went active on February 11, 2009. This site allowed authors and other rights holders of out-of-print (but copyright) books to submit a claim by June 5, 2010. In return they were to receive $60 per full book, or $5 to $15 for partial <b>works.</b> <b>In</b> return, <b>Google</b> was to be able to index the books and display snippets in search results, as well as up to 20% of each book <b>in</b> preview mode. <b>Google</b> was also to be able to show ads on these pages and make available for sale digital versions of each book.

[...] By simply locating The Prado users can {{zoom in to}} view up close high definition images of select art works. The high definition images not only allow the user to see a painting clearly, but even allow the user a close enough look to study individual brush strokes on a painting. Google Earth’s inclusion of The Prado {{was just the beginning}} of applying these kinds of technologies to accessing the arts. <b>In</b> February 2011 <b>Google</b> unveiled Google Art Project, a platform devoted to bringing online museums around the world and their most famous works to the online public. [...] Google Art Project is a platform housing many of the world museums and a variety of works from each location. Users can use this technology to get high definition, close up views of some of the world’s most famous paintings, much like <b>in</b> the <b>Google</b> Earth presentation of The Prado. With Google Art Project users can also take virtual tours of certain areas and exhibits of the museums, creating a more realistic visitor experience. This platform allows a person with a computer and an Internet connection in say, Arkansas, can take a virtual, high definition tour of, for instance, the Gemäldegalerie in Berlin, Germany, the National Gallery in London, England, or the Palace of Versailles in Versailles, France. Because of online platforms like Google Earth and Google Arts an area once largely reserved for the wealthy-the arts-because of limited accessibility, is increasingly accessible.|$|R
