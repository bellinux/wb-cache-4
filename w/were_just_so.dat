25|$|When I had {{a meeting}} with the Council a day before the concert, they were {{absolutely}} petrified of me. I wanted to play the records and say 'I am not going to destroy you' but they <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>so</b> scared. Because they were worried about their political future. They were not thinking about Death in June as Being a Nazi group, they are thinking that I, Jean Pierre Nobody, want to be Mayor of this town and I must win the good citizens over of this town to my cause and, therefore, I will be a knight in shining armour, I will always stand up to those things that everybody hates. So, I will stand up to Nazi, skinhead hordes that are coming to destroy Lausanne.|$|E
500|$|In February 1971, after a one off {{performance}} at the Myponga Pop Festival in Australia, Black Sabbath returned to the studio to begin work on their third album. Following the chart success of Paranoid, the band were afforded more studio time, along with a [...] "briefcase full of cash" [...] to buy drugs. [...] "We were getting into coke, big time", Ward explained. [...] "Uppers, downers, Quaaludes, whatever you like. It got to the stage where {{you come up with}} ideas and forget them, because you <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>so</b> out of it." ...|$|E
500|$|Cooper {{said the}} band members relied [...] "on each other instead of forcing each other to play something". Guitarist Eddie Reyes insisted on playing his own part, {{as opposed to a}} chord progression, on several occasions. Cooper said [...] "So instead of trying to force him to play one thing, he’ll go and do his own thing that’s way more cool and unique that any of us could imagine." [...] Lazzara {{mentioned}} there was [...] "an urgency and an energy and an excitement" [...] embedded into the material, which [...] "you can't create or fake". Nolan stated that Straylight Run helped Cooper and himself as musicians: [...] "We learned, we grew and were much more mature coming back to TBS." [...] Cooper mentioned that {{towards the end of the}} writing process the group's [...] "creative juices ... <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>so</b> depleted".|$|E

[...] These words struck rather unpleasantly on Mrs. Roberts's conscience, for {{something}} told her that, {{whatever the reason}} might <b>be,</b> it <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>so.</b> On Sunday every thing was later and more irregular than any other day in the week.|$|R

500|$|John Brousseau was not {{sent to the}} Hole, {{but what}} he saw of it made him decide to leave Scientology in 2010 after 33 years in the Church. He {{was struck by how}} [...] "dozens of these people , they <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>so</b> alive, but I looked at them now and they were just husks. They wouldn't say or {{originate}} anything, they seemed to have no purpose, they were just like sheep. There's no way 100 people could be evil horrid [...] and DM's the only [...] one. No way." [...] He had known and been friends with some of those in the Hole for decades and could not bear what he was seeing. As he put it, [...] "I can't stop it, but I can at least stop supporting it. So I left." [...] He left a note in his room for his colleagues to find: [...] "By now you've noticed I'm gone. I couldn't stand to see my Sea Org friends so mistreated. I won't support it anymore. Goodbye." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{the break}} up of Kara's Flowers, Levine, along with Carmichael, left Los Angeles to pursue further studies at Five Towns College in New York. On MTV News, in 2002, he said: [...] "That's when I started {{waking up to}} the whole hip-hop, R thing. We had friends named Chaos and Shit. It was not Brentwood High". After {{dropping}} out of Five Towns College, in Dix Hills, Long Island, New York, where he and Jesse Carmichael spent a semester, they reunited with Mickey Madden and Ryan Dusick to form a band once more. They experimented with several styles, including country and folk, before deciding groove-based music would become their genre. Levine explained the need for a makeover for the band: [...] "We <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>so</b> sick of being a typical rock 'n'roll band ... I felt like I needed to look elsewhere for vocal inspiration." [...] The band put together a demo that was rejected by several labels, before falling into the hands of Octone Records executives James Diener, Ben Berkman, and David Boxenbaum. [...] Following Berkman's advice, the band added a fifth member, James Valentine, and was renamed Maroon 5. In an interview with HitQuarters, Berkman explained that Levine [...] "seemed to be a very shy, shoe-gazing type ... a fifth member could play the guitar to free up the singer , so he could be the star I perceived him to be".|$|E
500|$|Hunte and Sewell-Ulepic were {{hesitant}} though, as {{they had}} sent the track for consideration already and been unsuccessful. According to Hunte, when a Notorious B.I.G. figure she kept by the computer fell over as they played the track for Platt—a statue that had never moved before regardless of how loud they've blasted music—she realized it was an omen. She commented, [...] "We all just {{looked at each other}} like, 'if Biggie approves, then, send it to Jay'". The next day Platt sent it to Jay-Z and he [...] "loved it and recorded it that night". Hunte recalls, [...] "We <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>so</b> happy he wanted to honor our work and our production. Two female producers/writers, and for him as a rapper to take our song—that's not a combination you see a lot. For him to be so open-minded about it, we just couldn't be any more grateful and thankful." [...] Originally composed as a song to be sung, Jay-Z ended up rewriting new verses inspired from the original lyrics and leaving Hunte on the song's hook. However, when Hunte and Sewell-Ulepic were asked if they thought someone else would be more appropriate for the chorus, Hunte suggested R and soul artist Alicia Keys. Hunte said, [...] "She's never done a record with him and she also has my same vocal tone. She made the song sound so close to the original, She just nailed it and brought it home. It was a great choice." [...] Keys also contributed to writing [...] "Empire State of Mind"s new bridge.|$|E

2500|$|Former UFC Light Heavyweight Champion Tito Ortiz has {{credited}} Rutten {{for inspiration}} during his early days. Ortiz said; [...] "I {{looked up to}} Bas Rutten. Bas was my idol. People <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>so</b> scared of fighting him, he was like the man. I thought that was what I need to do now. If I train {{as hard as he}} does then one day I'll be as good as him and two years later look where I am, I'm on top of the world. I've got to say thanks to him, (Bas) for helping me out by making me believe in dreams." ...|$|E
2500|$|Regarding the {{recording}} of the album, Cunningham said, [...] "At the time we did the first record—which I really like and think is good—you can tell the band was really young. We'd been playing most of those songs for quite a while, and we <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>so</b> happy {{to be making a}} record that we didn't really think a whole lot about making the songs better". Moreno felt that Adrenaline was recorded [...] "really fast" [...] and performed all his vocals live with the band in the room using a hand-held Shure SM58 microphone. AllMusic's review of Adrenaline praised the album's musical control, precision, overall groove and Cunningham's [...] "surprisingly sophisticated drumming". It was also noted that [...] "there is a bit of sameness in Chino Moreno's whispered vocal melodies, which drags the record down a bit".|$|E
2500|$|Nina {{released}} her self-titled fourth album in August 2006. She decided {{to release a}} self-titled album {{due to the fact}} that she has already established her name as an artist, and would like the public to know her as who she really is. She also admitted that Nyoy Volante was an inspiration for the album, saying [...] " [...] <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>so</b> beautiful and inspiring that eventually I was encouraged to create an all-original album." [...] Titik Pilipino praised her in a review, saying [...] "Nina does almost everything right [...] She’s more refined, polished." [...] On the November–December 2006 issue of MYX Mag, Mike Luis of Freestyle reacted positively to the album, stating [...] "The mid-tempo tracks are groove-worthy, the slow jams are sexy, and the two remakes were nicely done." [...] "I Do", a song that is heavily influenced by Rdance, was released as the album's lead single, but it was the second single, [...] "Someday", that topped the local charts, staying in the position for eight weeks. [...] "Someday" [...] also received positive response from music critics. The Philippine Daily Inquirer described the song as [...] "introspective, traffic-stopping [...] that boasts of a rich melody and Nina’s emotive panache." [...] In 2007, she released the third and final commercial single, [...] "I Can't Make You Love Me", which was both critically and commercially successful. The song topped the radio charts and became a critical acclaim, with the Philippine Daily Inquirer stating [...] "Bonnie Raitt’s anthemic song for the lovelorn is hard to top, but Nina gives a beautifully dressed-down version." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lewis {{is widely}} hailed {{as one of}} the most {{influential}} pianists in the history of rock and roll. [...] In an often quoted tribute, Elvis Presley once said that if he could play the piano like Lewis he would quit singing. [...] Lewis's pivotal role in popularizing the piano in rock and roll is indisputable. [...] Up until his arrival, the music had been primarily associated with guitars, but his early Sun recordings and television appearances pushed the instrument to the forefront. [...] Lewis was also an incendiary showman who often played with his fists, elbows, feet, and backside, sometimes climbing on top of the piano during gigs and even apocryphally setting it on fire. [...] Like Chuck Berry's guitar playing, Lewis's piano style has become synonymous with rock and roll, having influenced generations of piano players. [...] In a 2013 interview with Leah Harper, Elton John recalls that up until [...] "Great Balls of Fire," [...] "the piano playing that I had heard had been more sedate. [...] My dad collected George Shearing records, but this was the first time I heard someone beat the shit out of a piano. When I saw Little Richard at the Harrow Granada, he played it standing up, but Jerry Lee Lewis actually jumped on the piano! This was astonishing to me, that people could do that. Those records had such a huge effect on me, and they <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>so</b> great. I learned to play like that." [...] Lewis is primarily known for his [...] "boogie woogie" [...] style, which is characterized by a regular left hand bass figure and dancing beat, but his command of the instrument and highly individualistic style set him apart. [...] Appearing on Memphis Sounds with George Klein in 2011, Lewis credited his older piano-playing cousin Carl McVoy as being a crucial influence, stating, [...] "He was a great piano player, a great singer, and a nice looking man, carried himself real well. [...] I miss Carl very much." [...] Lewis also cited Moon Mullican as a source of inspiration. [...] Although almost entirely self-taught, Lewis conceded to biographer Rich Bragg in 2014 that Paul Whitehead, a blind pianist from Meadville, Mississippi, was another key influence on him in his earliest days playing clubs, confiding, [...] "Paul Whitehead done a lot. [...] His lesson was worth a billion dollars to me...He taught me. [...] I'd sit beside him, and say, 'Mr. Paul, can you show me exactly how you do that?' [...] Mr. Paul was good to me." ...|$|E

60|$|We <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>so</b> far in our talk, when I heard a {{sound that}} brought my heart into my mouth: the sound of some one slily trying {{the handle of the}} door. It had been preceded by no audible footstep. Since the {{departure}} of Rowley our wing of the house had been entirely silent. And we had every right to suppose ourselves alone, and to conclude that the new-comer, whoever he might be, was come on a clandestine, if not a hostile, errand.|$|E
6000|$|Hermione nodded {{kindly to}} her visitor, {{but did not}} speak; and Margaret, {{accustomed}} to this reception, and {{in the present case}} not sorry for it, as it gave her an interval to collect her thoughts, stooped over Monna Paula's frame and observed, in a half whisper, [...] "You <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>so</b> far as that rose, Monna, when I first saw you--see, there is the mark where I had the bad luck to spoil the flower in trying to catch the stitch--I was little above fifteen then.

5000|$|We were {{recording}} another number Sticks; we’d {{just finished}} a take and John Bonham did the drum intro and we just followed on. I started doing pretty much half of that riff you hear on Rock n Roll and it <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>so</b> exciting that we thought, [...] "let’s just work on this". The riff and the sequence was really immediate to those 12-bar patterns that you had in those old rock songs like Little Richard, etc, and it <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>so</b> spur-of-the-moment {{the way that it}} just came together more or less out of nowhere.|$|R

60|$|He {{was beaten}} {{and he knew}} it. Recovering his dignity, he stalked out solemnly from under the rain of stones. He stopped {{in the middle of}} the open space and looked wistfully and hungrily back at us. He hated to forego the meal, and we <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>so</b> much meat, cornered but inaccessible. This sight of him started us to laughing. We laughed derisively and uproariously, all of us. Now animals do not like mockery. To be laughed at makes them angry. And in such fashion our {{laughter}} affected Saber-Tooth. He turned with a roar and charged the bluff again. This was what we wanted. The fight had become a game, and we took huge delight in pelting him.|$|E
60|$|As {{to mental}} cultivation,--she had a clear, strong, active mind, was well and {{thoroughly}} read {{in history and}} the older English classics, and thought with great strength within certain narrow limits. Her theological tenets were all made up, labelled in most positive and distinct forms, and put by, like the bundles in her patch trunk; there <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>so</b> many of them, and there were never to be any more. So, also, were her ideas with regard to most matters of practical life,--such as housekeeping in all its branches, and the various political relations of her native village. And, underlying all, deeper than anything else, higher and broader, lay the strongest principle of her being--conscientiousness. Nowhere is conscience so dominant and all-absorbing as with New England women. It is the granite formation, which lies deepest, and rises out, even to {{the tops of the}} highest mountains.|$|E

We're so much more civilised. So much better in every way. Do you know, Mr. Ingledew," [...] and she hesitated for a minute, [...] "I can't bear to differ from you or blame you in anything, because you always appear to me so wise and good and kind-hearted and reasonable; but it often surprises me, and even hurts me, when you seem to talk of us all as if we <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>so</b> many savages. You're always {{speaking}} about taboo, and castes, and poojah, and fetiches, as if we weren't civilised people at all, but utter barbarians.

[...] "And at the time we were all blonde. And, you know, it <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>so</b> - it <b>was</b> so packageable.
