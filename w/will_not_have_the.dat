Two warriors {{volunteer}} to capture a child to please their gods, and they return with Madoc and the child Hoel. Madoc is forced to fight other condemned men, until Madoc's Welsh allies attack the city, allowing a woman, Coatel, to free Madoc and Hoel. At the same time the Aztec warrior Amalahta attacks Caermadoc, but is defeated by the Welsh women. When Madoc returns, he joins the Welsh and Hoamen forces, and the battle continues until Madoc kills the Aztec king, Coanocotzin.|$|E

25|$|The two's {{complement}} {{of the minimum}} number in the range <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> desired effect of negating the number.

25|$|Norrie {{disease is}} a genetic {{disorder}} caused by mutations in the NDP gene, located on Xp11.4 (GeneID: 4693). It is inherited in an X-linked recessive manner. This means that almost only males are affected. Sons of affected men <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> mutation, while all of their daughters will be genetic carriers of the mutation. They also usually show no clinical symptoms, but will inherit the mutation to 50% of their offspring. Daughters receiving the mutated gene will also be, like their mother, asymptomatic carriers, but 50% of their sons will express clinical symptoms.|$|E
25|$|A {{potential}} role pharmacogenomics {{may play}} {{would be to}} reduce the occurrence of polypharmacy. It is theorized that with tailored drug treatments, patients <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> need to take several medications that are intended to treat the same condition. In doing so, they could potentially minimize the occurrence of ADRs, have improved treatment outcomes, and can save costs by avoiding purchasing extraneous medications. An example {{of this can be}} found in Psychiatry, where patients tend to be receiving more medications than even age-matched non-psychiatric patients. This has been associated with an increased risk of inappropriate prescribing.|$|E
30|$|Prior to {{approaching}} this problem, <b>the</b> limitations <b>have</b> to be recognised and disclosed as follows. Firstly, {{the studies}} to date <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> based <b>the</b> assessment of different diagnostic accuracies {{on the current}} ESHRE/ESGE classification.

25|$|Emirates were {{to start}} the first Airbus A380 service to Perth from Dubai in early 2014 when the {{construction}} of a dual level boarding gate and other expansions to the terminal, including a new Emirates business class lounge, are completed. Emirates was originally scheduled to commence A380 operations in late 2013, however in June 2013 the airport revealed a 5-month delay in the terminal expansion project. While the A380 gate complex itself is due to be completed in November 2013, the airport <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> capacity to facilitate A380 operations until the other upgrades are completed in March 2014. However, on December 16, 2014, Emirates announced that they will commence A380 operations to Perth in May 2015 with one of its three daily flights. As of the 1st of August, the remaining Emirates Boeing 777-300ER service, will be replaced with an Airbus A380, tallying the total Emirates A380 daily services to two.|$|E

500|$|The {{referral}} {{of a bill}} {{only after}} its third reading means that Parliament <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> opportunity of considering the Council's views on the bill prior to the debate. The Wee Chong Jin Commission had advocated for the Council to consider each bill after it had been introduced during its second reading, on the presumption that the Council would express views that would benefit {{the debate on the}} bill. Additionally, since Parliament has already passed the bill, Parliament may consider it a [...] "point of honour to maintain its original view... whatever the merits of the Council's objections" [...] as they have already debated the bill and may decide to [...] "stick to their original guns".|$|E
5|$|The {{syndrome}} is strongly {{believed to be}} inherited in an X-linked recessive manner. When a female carries a mutated gene {{on one of her}} two copies of the X chromosome, there is a 50% chance of passing the mutation on to her children. Much like her, a daughter inheriting this mutation will be a carrier, but <b>will</b> <b>not</b> herself <b>have</b> <b>the</b> associated disease. However, a son who inherits <b>the</b> mutation will <b>have</b> <b>the</b> disease; this is because males have only one copy of the X chromosome and therefore could only express the disease mutation.|$|R
30|$|However, in {{the general}} case, if a script is {{executed}} multiple times it <b>will</b> <b>not</b> always <b>have</b> <b>the</b> same effect. For example, {{take the case of}} a simple script that reads a specific file from the filesystem and deletes it. The script can only be executed exactly once: The second time it will be executed it will fail, since the file is no longer available. This failure is caused by the side effects (the file deletion) of the script execution, which lead the deployment to a state in which the same execution cannot be repeated.|$|R

500|$|The Fourteenth Amendment {{provides}} that children {{born in the}} United States become American citizens regardless of the citizenship of their parents. At {{the time of the}} amendment's passage, three Senators, including Trumbull,Mr. Cowan: [...] "I will ask whether it <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> effect of naturalizing the children of Chinese and Gypsies born in this country?"Mr. Trumbull: [...] "Undoubtedly."...Mr. Trumbull: [...] "I understand that under the naturalization laws the children who are born here of parents who have not been naturalized are citizens. This is the law, as I understand it, at the present time. Is not the child born in this country of German parents a citizen? I am afraid we have got very few citizens in some of the counties of good old Pennsylvania if the children born of German parents are not citizens."Mr. Cowan: [...] "The honorable Senator assumes that which is not the fact. The children of German parents are citizens; but Germans are not Chinese; Germans are not Australians, nor Hottentots, nor anything of the kind. That is the fallacy of his argument."Mr. Trumbull: [...] "If the Senator from Pennsylvania will show me in the law any distinction made between the children of German parents and the children of Asiatic parents, I may be able to appreciate the point which he makes; but the law makes no such distinction; and the child of an Asiatic is just as much of a citizen as the child of a European." [...] the author of the Civil Rights Act, as well as President Andrew Johnson, asserted that both the Civil Rights Act and the Fourteenth Amendment would confer citizenship on such children at birth; however, Senator Edgar Cowan of Pennsylvania had a definitively contrary opinion.Mr. Cowan: [...] "...Therefore I think, before we assert broadly that everybody who shall be born in the United States shall be taken to be citizen of the United States, we ought to exclude others besides Indians not taxed, because I look upon Indians not taxed as being much less dangerous and much less pestiferous to a society than I look upon Gypsies. I do not know how many my honorable friend from California looks upon Chinese, but I do know how some of his fellow citizens regard them. I have no doubt that now they are useful, and I have no doubt that within proper restraints, allowing that State and the other Pacific States to manage them as they may see fit, they may be useful; but I would not tie their hands by the Constitution of the United States so as to prevent them hereafter from dealing with them as in their wisdom they see fit..."Mr. Johnson: [...] "...Who is a citizen of the United States is an open question. The decision of the courts and doctrine of the commentators is, that every man who is a citizen of the State becomes ipso facto a citizen of the United States; but there is no definition as to how citizenship can exist in the United States except through the medium of a citizenship in a State..." [...] These congressional remarks applied to non-citizens lawfully present in the United States, as the problem of unauthorized immigration did not exist in 1866, and some scholars dispute whether the Citizenship Clause applies to unauthorized immigrants, although {{the law of the land}} continues to be based on the standard interpretation. Congress during the 21st century has occasionally discussed revising the clause to reduce the practice of [...] "birth tourism", in which a pregnant foreign national gives birth in the United States for purposes of the child's citizenship.|$|E
