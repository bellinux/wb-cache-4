Two standards, IEEE 802. 11 and ETSI HIPERLAN Type 1, are currently available for WLAN; the standardization process of <b>wireless</b> <b>ATM,</b> involving, among others, the <b>Wireless</b> <b>ATM</b> Group of the ATM Forum and the Broadband Radio Access Networks project of ETSI, is ongoing and related standards {{are expected to}} be released by mid- 1999. This article focuses on MAC protocol aspects of wireless local access networks.

The motivation behind this extension (termed <b>wireless</b> <b>ATM)</b> includes the desire for seamless interconnection of <b>wireless</b> and <b>ATM</b> networks, and the need to support emerging mobile multimedia services. In this paper, we investigate the problem of optimum assignment of cells in PCS (Personal Communication Service) to switches in a <b>wireless</b> <b>ATM</b> network. Given cells and switches in an ATM network (whose locations are fixed and known), the problem is assigning cells to switches such that the cost can be minimized. The cost has two components, one is the cost of handoffs that involve two switches, and the other is the cost of cabling. This problem is modeled as a complex integer programming problem, and finding an optimal solution to this problem is NP-complete.
