25|$|Muhammad summoned Ali, {{and asked}} him to {{proclaim}} the revealed verses to the people on the day of sacrifice when they assembled at Mina. Ali went forth on Muhammad's slit-eared camel, and overtook Abu Bakr. When Ali joined the party, Abu Bakr <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> he had come to give orders or to convey them. Ali said that he had not come to replace Abu Bakr as Amir-ul-Hajj, and that his only mission was to convey a special message to the people on behalf of Muhammad.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{not having}} {{attended}} a bishops' selection conference, he was accepted for ordination. He trained for two terms at St Deiniol's Library and was ordained deacon in 1991 by Graham Leonard. The service was threatened with interruption by a journalist from The Daily Mail who <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> Sir Derek was gay. Following a further term at the College of the Resurrection he was ordained priest in 1992 by David Hope. Both services {{took place at}} St Gabriel's Church in Pimlico, in central London where he was non-stipendiary priest from 1991 until 2000.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} {{the match}} the Sri Lankans {{requested}} from the ICC permission to confer with Hair in order to find out exactly how to remedy the problem with their bowler. Despite the game's controlling body agreeing to it, the Australian Cricket Board vetoed it {{on the grounds that it}} might lead to umpires being quizzed by teams after every game and meant that the throwing controversy would continue into the World Series Cup during the coming week. The Sri Lankans were disappointed they did not get an explanation and decided they would continue playing their bowler in matches not umpired by Hair and <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> other umpires would support or reject Hair's judgement.|$|E

500|$|The idea {{of testing}} the {{implosion}} device {{was brought up}} in discussions at Los Alamos in January 1944, and attracted enough support for Oppenheimer to approach Groves. Groves gave approval, but he had concerns. The Manhattan Project had {{spent a great deal of}} money and effort to produce the plutonium and he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> there would be a way to recover it. The Laboratory's Governing Board then directed Norman Ramsey to investigate how this could be done. [...] In February 1944 Ramsey proposed a small-scale test in which the explosion was limited in size by reducing the number of generations of chain reactions, and that it take place inside a sealed containment vessel from which the plutonium could be recovered.|$|E
500|$|In 1991, Sackett {{discovered}} a partly-completed manuscript while she researched documents for her book Inside Trek. This prompted her to suggest {{sending it to}} Pocket Books, which held the rights to Star Trek novels at the time, despite the prior agreement with Bantam. Roddenberry was not enthusiastic about the idea, but editor David Stern at Pocket Books was interested and <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> Sackett and fellow writer Fred Bronson {{would be able to}} expand and complete it. Contract negotiations for the work began in April 1991, during which time Sackett had a version re-typed because no electronic versions were available and the type on the existing print out was faint in places. The writers were dealing with Roddenberry's lawyer Leonard Maizlish, but discussions lasted over six months. Two days after Roddenberry's death on October 24, they were informed that work on the novel would not continue. Sackett said this may have been linked to her dismissal from the [...] television series following Roddenberry's death. Pocket Books brought in Michael Jan Friedman to finish the work, but it was never published.|$|E

He <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> participation in the world's affairs would disturb that serenity... he was tormented by the thought that the emptiness of the man within corresponded with the emptiness of society at large where Mammon had found a new demesne to infest." ...|$|E

Zaccardelli told the CBC that US authorities said that they didn't have enough evidence to lay charges against Arar and <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> Arar would be arrested if he returned to Canada. [...] "The discussion was: 'If we let him go and he comes to Canada, can you arrest him or detain him?' And we keep reaffirming, 'No we can't'," [...] Zaccardelli said.|$|E
2500|$|In 1984, at {{the final}} preview of Starlight Express, Crawford {{happened}} to run into the show's creator, Andrew Lloyd Webber. Lloyd Webber had met Crawford socially several times and remembered him from his work in Flowers for Algernon. He informed Crawford that {{he was working on}} a new project based on a Gaston Leroux novel and <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> he was interested. Crawford said he was, but the show was still in the early planning stages, and nothing had been decided. Several months passed, during which Lloyd Webber had already created a pitch video featuring his then-wife Sarah Brightman as the female lead Christine and British rocker Steve Harley as the Phantom, singing the title song {{in the manner of a}} contemporary new wave video. Crawford was turned off by this, supposing the songwriter had chosen to do a more [...] "rock opera"-inspired spectacle in lieu of a more traditional operatic musical.|$|E

2500|$|Otello laments {{his fate}} (Dio! mi potevi scagliar tutti i mali / [...] "God, {{you could have}} thrown every evil at me" [...] ). When Iago calls out [...] "Cassio is here!" [...] Otello hides as Iago and Cassio enter. Cassio says {{he had hoped to}} see Desdemona here, for he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> she had been {{successful}} with Otello (Iago, Cassio, Otello: Vieni; l'aula è deserta / [...] "Come, the hall is deserted"). Iago asks him to tell of his adventures with that woman. Cassio asks which woman, and, softly, so that Otello cannot hear, Iago says [...] "Bianca" [...] (the name of Cassio's actual lover). As Cassio laughs about his romantic adventures, Otello assumes he is speaking of Desdemona. In a conversation only partially heard, Cassio seems to be telling Iago that another woman, a secret admirer, left him a handkerchief as a token. At Iago's urging, Cassio produces it, whereupon Iago seizes it—for it is Desdemona's—and holds it out where he knows Otello can see it. He then returns it to Cassio and teases him, while in his hiding place Otello fumes (Iago, Cassio, Otello: Questa è una ragna dove il tuo cuor casca / [...] "This is a spiderweb in which your heart is caught").|$|E
2500|$|Since {{nothing else}} {{has changed from}} {{experimental}} configuration to experimental configuration, and since {{in the first case}} the photon is said to [...] "decide" [...] to travel as a particle and in the second case it is said to [...] "decide" [...] to travel as a wave, Wheeler <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>whether,</b> experimentally, a time could be determined at which the photon made its [...] "decision." [...] Would it be possible to let a photon pass through the region of the first beam-splitter while there was no beam-splitter in the second position, thus causing it to [...] "decide" [...] to travel, and then quickly let the second beam-splitter pop up into its path? Having presumably traveled as a particle up to that moment, would the beam splitter let it pass through and manifest itself as would a particle were that second beam splitter not to be there? Or, would it behave as though the second beam-splitter had always been there? Would it manifest interference effects? And if it did manifest interference effects then to have done so it must have gone back in time and changed its decision about traveling as a particle to traveling as a wave. Note that Wheeler wanted to investigate several hypothetical statements by obtaining objective data.|$|E

The problem is also known as the socialist millionaires' problem, in which two millionaires <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> they happen <b>to</b> be equally rich. In our solution, both players will be convinced of the correctness of the equality test between their combinations and will get no additional information on the other player's combination. Our solution is fair : one party cannot get the result of the comparison while preventing the other one from getting it. The protocol requires O(k) exponentiations only, where k is a security parameter. 1 Introduction 1. 1 Description of the problem Two players both have decided to back a combination for the coming Tierce 1.
