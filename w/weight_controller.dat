40|$|Controller tuning is {{the process}} of {{adjusting}} the parameters of the selected controller to achieve optimum response for the controlled process. For many of the control problems, a satisfactory performance is obtained by using PID controllers. One of the main problems with mathematical models of physical systems is that the parameters used in the models cannot be determined with absolute accuracy. The values of the parameters may change with time or various effects. In these cases, conventional controller tuning methods suffer when trying a lot to produce optimum response. In order to overcome these difficulties a fuzzy logic based Set- Point <b>weighting</b> <b>controller</b> tuning method is proposed. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is analyzed through computer simulation using SIMULINK software and the results are presented. The fuzzy logic based simulation results are compared with Cohen-Coon (CC), Ziegler- Nichols (ZN), Ziegler – Nichols with Set- Point weighting (ZN-SPW), Internal Model Control (IMC) and Internal model based PID controller responses (IMC-PID).

In Chapter 1 introduces the problem to be addressed, chapter 2 is a literature survey of the state-of-the-art power reduction techniques {{as well as a}} comparison between different power converter topologies and how compatible they are with power saving techniques. Chapter 3 presents compares behavioral models of Switch Inductor (SI) based dynamic voltage scaling topologies, the Single-Inductor-Multiple-Output (SIMO) is compared against a Multiple-Inductor-Multiple-Output (MIMO) approach and the results motivate further research into SIMO control techniques. Chapter 4 presents a digitally adjustable Single-Inductor Multiple-Output (SIMO) control technique to address cross-regulation and power loss reduction, the control technique is then compared against classic MIMO closed-loop control techniques. Chapter 5 presents the circuit implementation and measurements of a test-chip fabricated in a 130 nm process as a proof of concept to the developed Power <b>Weighting</b> <b>controller.</b> With the emergence of advanced packaging technologies it is important to analyze the potential of power converter integration schemes. Chapter 5 looks at different integration options for the converter-processor system. With the emergence of 3 D-integrated chip stacking, the converter integration has the advantage of reduced parasitics but increased thermal coupling. The SI converter is evaluated and compared using different integration schemes (off-die, on-package, 3 D) and it is shown how to properly design the converter {{to take advantage of the}} denser integration. A thermoelectric modeling framework is created to study the thermoelectric behavior of a fully integrated SI converter with processor die. This thesis finalizes with an analysis of the integration for a SIMO converter that is 3 D-stacked with a multi-core processor die, the analysis of the regulation capabilities and thermal transient simulations of the SIMO system are discussed. It is found that the SIMO is a suitable alternative to perform multi-domain voltage conversion, however, the tighter integration and higher temperatures means that the passives parasitics play a large role in how efficient the conversion is. Thus, improvements on the quality of passives are still required in order to achieve high-quality and high-efficiency energy conversion.

40|$|In H∞-controller {{synthesis}} {{the plant}} model has to be extended by weighted in-/output channels. With these weights the control requirements have to be specified in the frequendy domain. To fulfil time domain requirements a time consuming iterative procedure of choosing <b>weighting</b> filter, <b>controller</b> synthesis and closed loop performance analysis has to be done. In the paper this procedure is automated by global optimization. Instead of optimizing the coefficients of the weights directly, physically related parameters, for example gains and roll off frequencies, are optimized.

To improve the global optimization a new transformation is given how these physical parameters can be transformed into the weights coefficients.

40|$|Link-state routing {{protocols}} (e. g., OSPF and IS-IS) {{are widely used}} because they are scalable, robust, and based on simple abstractions. Unfortunately, these protocols are also rel- atively inflexible, since they direct all traffic over shortest paths. In contrast, Software Defined Networking (SDN) offers fine-grained control over routing, {{at the expense of}} controller overhead, failover latency, and deployment challenges. We argue that future networks can achieve the benefits of both approaches through central control over the dis- tributed route computation. The key idea, which we call Fibbing, is to have the controller trick the routers into seeing a fake topology that is carefully constructed to achieve the desired Forwarding Information Base (FIB). Given an acyclic forwarding graph for each destination, the controller computes an augmented topology with fake nodes (and destinations to announce there) and fake links (and link <b>weights).</b> The <b>controller</b> injects these “lies” into the link-state routing protocol, and the routers simply compute the paths accord- ingly. The controller can also select an augmented topology that triggers the use of specific backup paths when real links and routers fail. To reduce router load, our Fibbing algorithms compute augmented topologies of minimal size. Our preliminary evaluation on realistic ISP topologies shows that Fibbing works well in practice...|$|R
