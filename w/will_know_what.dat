25|$|The {{focus on}} {{outcomes}} creates a clear expectation of {{what needs to}} be accomplished {{by the end of the}} course. Students will understand what is expected of them and teachers <b>will</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> they need to teach during the course. Clarity is important over years of schooling and when team teaching is involved. Each team member, or year in school, will have a clear understanding of {{what needs to be}} accomplished in each class, or at each level, allowing students to progress. Those designing and planning the curriculum are expected to work backwards once an outcome has been decided upon; they must determine what knowledge and skills will be required to reach the outcome.|$|E

500|$|The 1924 Rose Bowl was {{the first}} meeting between Navy and Washington, and {{was the first}} bowl game that either team participated in. The {{competitors}} were announced on November 30, 1923, and the teams arrived for the bowl in mid-December, holding practices until the evening before the game. Heavy rain fell the night before the competition; Bagshaw said, [...] "Wet weather will not bother us", and Folwell said, [...] "My men <b>will</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> to do in the mud and will be there doing it". However, because of the wet conditions, several football critics predicted that Washington would have a slight advantage in the game due to their larger size. It was estimated that 52,000 people would attend the game. For the first time, the participating teams were responsible for ticket sales, and as a result only 40,000 people actually attended; a large number of tickets were sold to a navy fleet which was called to service on December 31, the day before the game. The competition was the first Rose Bowl to be broadcast on radio, and was aired by a local Pasadena station.|$|E

2500|$|Some Puerto Ricans saw the {{proposal}} {{as an attempt}} to gain favor with mainland US business interests, to promote Rosselló's declared goal of statehood for the commonwealth. The PRTC was seen as an organizational focus of nationalistic pride among many on the island.

Spellman later confronted Sheen, stating, [...] "I will {{get even with}} you. It may take six months or ten years, but everyone <b>will</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> you are like." [...] Besides being pressured to leave television Sheen also [...] "found himself unwelcome in the churches of New York. Spellman cancelled Sheen's annual Good Friday sermons at St. Patrick's Cathedral and discouraged clergy from befriending the Bishop." [...] In 1966 Spellman had Sheen reassigned to Rochester, New York, and caused his leadership at the Society for the Propagation of the Faith to be terminated (a position he had held for 16 years and raised {{hundreds of millions of}} dollars for, to which he had personally donated 10 million dollars of his own earnings). [...] On December 2, 1967, Spellman died in New York.|$|E

2500|$|While his {{brothers}} indulged in fun and entertainment, Cao Gun was often seen reading {{and being in}} deep thought. The officials around Cao Gun discussed among themselves and said, [...] "His Majesty (Cao Pi) has ordered us to observe the Duke's behaviour. It's our duty to report to His Majesty when we see the Duke behaving inappropriately. However, when we see the Duke doing good deeds, we should also praise {{him in front of}} His Majesty." [...] They then wrote a memo to Cao Pi to praise Cao Gun. Cao Gun was shocked when he heard about it and he scolded the officials, [...] "It is one's responsibility to conduct himself with virtue and faithfully perform his duties. There's no need to tell anyone. Now that you've informed His Majesty, I feel more pressured and burdened. Besides, if one behaves well and does good deeds, why does he need to worry that no one <b>will</b> <b>know?</b> <b>What</b> you've done is not helpful to me." [...] Such was Cao Gun's humility.|$|E
