500|$|On August 8, 2004—with 86days to {{go before}} the general election—the Illinois Republican Party drafted Alan Keyes to run against Democratic state senator Barack Obama for the U.S. Senate, after the Republican nominee, Jack Ryan, withdrew due to a sex scandal, and other {{potential}} draftees (most notably former Illinois governor Jim Edgar and former Chicago Bears coach Mike Ditka) declined to run. The Washington Post called Keyes a [...] "carpetbagger" [...] since he [...] "had never lived in Illinois." [...] When asked to answer charges of carpetbagging in the context of his earlier criticism of Hillary Clinton, he called her campaign [...] "pure and planned selfish ambition", but stated that in his case he felt a moral obligation to run after being asked to by the Illinois Republican Party. [...] "You are doing <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> to be required by your respect for God's will, and I think that that's what I'm doing in Illinois".|$|E
500|$|By 2008, Cuomo had reconsidered the album, saying: [...] "Pinkertons great. It's super-deep, brave, and authentic. Listening to it, I {{can tell}} that I was really going for it when I wrote and {{recorded}} {{a lot of those}} songs." [...] In 2010, Bell told The Aquarian Weekly: [...] "Pinkerton has definitely taken {{on a life of its}} own and became more successful and more accepted ... As an artist, you just have to do <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> in at the time, whether it’s accepted or not. You just have to keep going with it." [...] In 2015, following the Pinkerton reissue and the [...] "Memories" [...] tour, in which Weezer performed Blue and Pinkerton in their entirety, Cuomo said:The experience of learning those songs again, singing them every night, working on them with the guys, and then being in a relatively small venue with 1,000 of the most hardcore Weezer fans and hearing them sing every syllable, seeing them air-drum all the fills—it was such an amazing experience and so different from what we'd been doing the years before that ... So it was a great feeling of validation from the fans, for this album that was so personal to me and had been such a source of pain for years.|$|E
500|$|... "742617000027" [...] is the intro {{track to}} the album. It {{contains}} some guitar scratches and abstract sound {{samples from the}} sampler Craig Jones. Some of the dialogue was reportedly taken from a Charles Manson documentary. The dialogue is [...] "The whole thing, I think it's sick." [...] In an interview shortly after the album was released, Joey Jordison claimed the voice is Corey Taylor's, sped up. 742617000027 was the barcode number on their 1996 self-released album Mate. Feed. Kill. Repeat. All of the band members wear that number on their jumpsuits. [...] "Wait and Bleed" [...] is {{about a man who}} keeps having repetitive black and white dreams about laying in a bathtub full of his own blood with his wrists slit. One day, he wakes up and sees that his dream has become a reality. However, he doesn't want to believe it and he tries to fall back asleep again. Chris Fehn said that [...] "Surfacing" [...] "basically encompasses everything. Kind of encompasses the attitude of the band and the attitude of how we feel about life: Don't judge me. Everything that you think that you know about the world, and about Slipknot, and about your own life, might not be the case. So I think it's just openmindedness and just be cool." [...] Paul Gray said about the meaning behind [...] "Surfacing" [...] chorus: [...] "Basically, we dedicate it to the kids as their new national anthem. It's our way of saying don't worry about everybody else. Just worry about yourself. Don't worry about the people judging and the people coming down on you and all the fake crap. Stick to <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> in." [...] "Spit It Out" [...] was written in response to some individuals who worked at a local radio station in Des Moines, Iowa, where Slipknot is from. These individuals worked hard to keep Slipknot off the air. [...] "Prosthetics" [...] was inspired by the 1965 film The Collector, which is about a butterfly collector who chose to collect humans, too.|$|E

2500|$|The {{parallel}} between these traditional beliefs and the later resurrection of Jesus {{was not lost}} on the early Christians, as Justin Martyr argued: [...] "when we say ... Jesus Christ, our teacher, was crucified and died, and rose again, and ascended into heaven, we propose nothing different from <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> regarding those whom you consider sons of Zeus." [...] (1 Apol. 21). There is, however, no belief in a general resurrection in ancient Greek religion, as the Greeks held that not even the gods were able to recreate flesh that had been lost to decay, fire or consumption. The notion of a general resurrection of the dead was therefore apparently quite preposterous to the Greeks. This is made clear in Paul's Areopagus discourse. After having first told about the resurrection of Jesus, which makes the Athenians interested to hear more, Paul goes on, relating how this event relates to a general resurrection of the dead: ...|$|E
2500|$|MacArthur {{was a key}} {{person in}} the Lordship {{salvation}} controversy in the 1980s, arguing against Free Grace theology. He states, [...] "you must receive Jesus Christ for who He is, both Lord and Savior, to be truly saved (II Peter 2:20)." [...] Regarding eternal security, he states, [...] "It should never be presented merely {{as a matter of}} being once saved, always saved--with no regard for <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> or do. The writer of Hebrews 12:14 states frankly that only those who continue living holy lives will enter the Lord's presence." [...] MacArthur's views raised controversy within American Evangelicalism and were challenged in print by non-lordship dispensationalist theologians, Charles Ryrie and Zane C. Hodges, who argued that MacArthur was teaching a form of works-based salvation. MacArthur has denied their conclusion due to the disagreement over the nature of Christ's Lordship in relationship to Salvation. one can always refer the two tapes recorded in 1989 when he was asked to reason together with IFCA man.|$|E

Patriarch Amfilohije of Montenegro also blamed Wurst's victory for the floods. Irish television presenter for the BBC and former Eurovision BBC commentator Terry Wogan described that year's performance as a [...] "freak show". Reacting to these critics, Wurst stated [...] "It's so ridiculous! For me a perfect world would be when we don't {{have to talk about}} sexuality, where you're from, <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>believe.</b> Is this the worst thing {{in the mind of the}} politicians?" [...] She stated her desire to perform in Russia for the country's LGBT community, [...] "To tell them that they are not alone. The whole community around the world is standing behind them. They have to trust that if they open their mouth, then we can change something." [...] To a reporter from The Observer, she commented: [...] "It's funny that these people think I'm so powerful. I've figured out over the years, you can only hurt me if I love you; if I don't know you, I really don't care. There are people who want to kill me and I'm always like, 'Well, get in line, darling.'" ...|$|E
