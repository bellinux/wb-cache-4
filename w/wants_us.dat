25|$|In 1963 Benoit Mandelbrot {{analyzed}} the variations of cotton prices on a time series starting in 1900. There were two important findings. First, price movements {{had very little}} to do with a normal distribution in which the bulk of the observations lies close to the mean (68% of the data are within one standard deviation). Instead, the data showed a great frequency of extreme variations. Second, price variations followed patterns that were indifferent to scale: the curve described by price changes for a single day was similar to a month’s curve. Surprisingly, these patterns of self-similarity were present during the entire period 1900-1960, a violent epoch that had seen a Great Depression and two world wars. Mandelbrot used his fractal theory to explain the presence of extreme events in Wall Street. In 2004 he published his book on the “misbehavior” of financial markets - The (Mis)behavior of Markets: A Fractal View of Risk, Ruin, and Reward. The basic idea that relates fractals to financial markets is that the probability of experiencing extreme fluctuations (like the ones triggered by herd behavior) is greater than what conventional wisdom <b>wants</b> <b>us</b> to believe. This of course delivers a more accurate vision of risk in the world of finance. The central objective in financial markets is to maximize income for a given level of risk. Standard models for this are based on the premise that the probability of extreme variations of asset prices is very low.|$|E

500|$|... "Welcome Wagon" [...] is {{the first}} episode of the series to air on The CW as opposed to UPN. Paul Maguire, the {{spokesman}} for The CW, said that the series was picked up because [...] "the critics are behind it and our research has consistently shown that Gilmore shared more audience commonality with Veronica than with any other show from UPN, except Top Model". Veronica Mars was placed on Tuesdays after Gilmore Girls, with the network hoping for the Gilmore Girls audience to stay tuned for Veronica Mars. Thomas stated that The CW had requested some changes to the show to fit in better with the Gilmore Girls audience: [...] "The network really <b>wants</b> <b>us</b> {{to be a good}} companion piece to Gilmore Girls. They've had a couple of thoughts on storylines that are too dark." [...] "Welcome Wagon" [...] also introduces a new title sequence for the show. The visuals of the theme song are different, and although [...] "We Used to Be Friends" [...] by The Dandy Warhols was still employed as the theme song, a remix was used instead of the original.

500|$|Following {{the success}} of the band's {{previous}} albums Almost There and Spoken For, MercyMe was given [...] "significantly" [...] more resources to develop their next record by their record label, INO Records. Although they decided not to alter their Christian approach to songwriting, live performances, and interviews, they opted to work with outside songwriters on the album, employed the London Symphony Orchestra to play strings on several tracks, and added a sixth member to the band, guitarist Barry Graul. Additionally, MercyMe wrote and recorded the music for Undone before they wrote any of the lyrics. Lead singer Bart Millard noted that by using this method, instead of his lyrics swaying the musical elements of the song, the music acted as [...] "a canvas with which to write [...] ". He elaborated that [...] "We’ve been making records for 10 years, so anything that sparks creativity... is very much welcomed". The title of the album was inspired by [...] "the unexpected twists and turns in the band's journey"; Millard commented that [...] "We had our plans for {{what we were going to}} do; but when the bigger picture happened, all of our plans came unraveled. We don’t know what tomorrow will hold. When you make your own plans, you suddenly find yourself undone; and that’s exactly where God <b>wants</b> <b>us</b> in the first place".|$|E
500|$|The intro, [...] "The Genesis", is {{composed}} as an aural montage {{that begins with}} the sound of an elevated train and an almost-inaudible voice rhyming beneath it. Over these sounds, a snatch of dialogue, two men arguing. It samples Grand Wizard Theodore's [...] "Subway Theme" [...] from the 1983 film Wild Style, the first major hip hop motion picture. Nas made another ode to Wild Style, while shooting the music video for his single, [...] "It Ain't Hard to Tell", on the same stage as the finale scene for the film. His verse on [...] "Live at the Barbeque" [...] is played in the background of [...] "The Genesis". According to music writer Mickey Hess, in the intro, [...] "Nas tells us everything he <b>wants</b> <b>us</b> to know about him. The train is shorthand for New York; the barely discernible rap is, in fact, his [...] "Live at the Barbeque" [...] verse; and the dialogue comes from Wild Style, one of the earliest movies to focus on hip hop culture. Each of these is a point of genesis. New York for Nas as a person, 'Live at the Barbeque' for Nas the rapper, and Wild Style, symbolically at least, for hip hop itself. These are my roots, Nas was saying, and he proceeded to demonstrate exactly what those roots had yielded." ...|$|E

Iggy Azalea {{has all the}} lineaments of a risk-taking young rebel without a well-off family to back her up." [...] Christgau went on to praise the track's hooks, and explained: [...] "The hooks, of course, are one reason hard die-hards put her down—in the truimpant Dirty South manner, her hip-hop is radio-friendly {{as a matter of}} principle. The cumulative weight of the long-player they never think about." [...] Monica Herrera of Rolling Stone called the song [...] "a bombshell-next-door move that demands attention". Matt Orkine of Triple J listed it as the year's ninth best single, and viewed it as a [...] "straight-up banger" [...] and his [...] "guiltiest music pleasure of 2013". Kellan Miller of XXL deemed it [...] "the song that made the world fall in love with Iggy all over again". Justin Monroe of Complex called it the album's [...] "infectious and decidedly less weird first single", and complimented its ability to provide listeners with a sense of Azalea's background. While Sam Weiss of the same publication described the song [...] "as wild and eccentric as anything she's done so far".|$|E

500|$|Mercedes {{featured}} {{in three of}} the episode's musical numbers. Flandez said of her solo, [...] "She blew Jennifer Hudson's 'Spotlight' out of this world." [...] Benigno wrote that it was [...] "great", but added that it was [...] "not much of a stretch for Amber Riley to hit this one". Berk praised her [...] "amazing voice" [...] and gave the performance four stars out of five, and Goldberg characterized the rendition as [...] "flawless". Other reviewers were more critical, including VanDerWerff, who said that this was the only song in the episode that [...] "really didn't work". Slezak felt that the arrangement used was not distinct enough from the original, though he gave the performance a [...] "B+", as did West, who wrote, [...] "Mercedes looked fantastic and carried herself well, and her voice was as strong as ever but it felt a little lacking." [...] In her [...] "Maria-off" [...] with Rachel, Benigno said they [...] "both kill it", characterized it as [...] "easy but fun", and gave it an [...] "A−", as did Slezak and West, the latter of whom [...] "didn't feel that Mercedes was the clear winner" [...] but thought both singers were [...] "fantastic". Kubicek thought that [...] "Mercedes clearly won" [...] and Flandez maintained that she [...] "clearly outshone her rival", and continued, [...] "You just believe so much of what she sings." [...] Berk agreed, and contrasted the two singers with his rating scale of one to five stars: [...] "Two stars for Rachel, who sang this like Barry Manilow; four for Mercedes, who sang this like she lived it." [...] Futterman had a slightly different take: [...] "Rachel puts on a diva front, but inside she's scared and nervous, while Mercedes is just a diva." [...] However, Hyman thought that the two [...] "were evenly matched", while Canning and Billboard Rae Votta both thought Rachel was the victor; Votta stated, [...] "While the show <b>wants</b> <b>us</b> to believe otherwise, Rachel clearly outsang Mercedes". [...] "It's All Over" [...] from Dreamgirls received the most enthusiastic commentary, including an [...] "A+" [...] from West, who wrote [...] "Mercedes was at her best in this performance", a sentiment echoed by Benigno when he awarded the song an [...] "A". Hyman called it [...] "pretty awesome" [...] and Flandez a [...] "cleverly amusing take", while Futterman said Mercedes [...] "fully embraces her inner Effie White" [...] and that the song was [...] "on par with the best of Glee's Broadway songs in terms of plot relevancy and vocal arrangements". She also praised [...] "the first group showtune the New Directions have done" [...] and added, [...] "we want more". Votta characterized it as [...] "a flawless fantasy homage" [...] and stated, [...] "It's the perfect use of the non-realism of [...] "Glee" [...] and the power of musical theater to express a storyline". Kubicek agreed it was [...] "like a real musical" [...] in these regards and praised Mike's short solo, and West liked the segment where Santana confronts Mercedes in the number. Slezak was not enthusiastic about the rendition, and wrote that he wished that the [...] "scene gelled better than it did", and questioned why Mercedes was the character Effie while all the other members of New Directions were themselves. He gave the number a [...] "C+".|$|E
