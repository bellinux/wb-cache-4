5|$|Some Bach {{scholars}} {{believed that}} the cantata was written in 1734 {{for the end of}} the War of the Polish Succession, but the discovery of the printed text showed that it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>related.</b> The cantata was not published until 1876 when it appeared in the Bach Gesellschaft Ausgabe, the first complete edition of the composer's works.|$|E

The Church of Scientology's information chief in Norway, Matthias Fosse stated that the test was not dangerous and that the organization did not bear any responsibility for Ballo's death. Ballo's father retained a lawyer to investigate his daughter's death, and the family considered filing a lawsuit against Scientology. 500 people attended Ballo's funeral on April 11, 2008 at Grefsen Church in Oslo, Norway.|$|E
5|$|A mobile racing game {{based on}} a mini game from VII, Final Fantasy VII G-Bike, was {{released}} on October 30, 2014, for iOS and Android. A western release for the title was planned. It was developed by Japan-based developer CyberConnect2 {{as part of a}} planned subseries of mobile games based on VIIs mini games. While related to VII and the Compilation due to its nature, the developers confirmed that it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>related</b> to nor affected the Compilation itself. Due to difficulties delivering continual satisfactory service, G-Bike was shut down in 2015 without seeing a Western release.|$|E

She had been vacationing in London at the time, but fell as she was getting into a taxi, and died a few days later in a London hospital. An autopsy report revealed that her death <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>related</b> to the earlier fall. On receiving news of her death, the University of Texas declared two days of mourning and flew the flag at half-staff.|$|E
5|$|In January 2011, NuScale's largest investor, Kenwood Group, was {{investigated}} by the Securities Exchange Commission and later plead guilty to operating a Ponzi scheme. The SEC investigation <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>related</b> to any of Kenwood's dealings with NuScale, but Kenwood's assets were frozen just as NuScale was expecting additional funding. The company started making staffing and pay cuts as executives looked for new funding sources {{and most of the}} company's employees were laid off within a few months.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the areas}} of focus on object {{permanence}} has been how physical disabilities (blindness, cerebral palsy and deafness) and intellectual disabilities (Down syndrome, etc.) affect the development of object permanence. In a study that was performed in 1975-76, {{the results showed that}} the only area where children with intellectual disabilities performed more weakly than children without disabilities was along the lines of social interaction. Other tasks, such as imitation and causality tasks, were performed more weakly by the children without disabilities. However, object permanence was still acquired similarly because it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>related</b> to social interaction.|$|E

5|$|Pinguinus alfrednewtoni was a larger, {{and also}} flightless, {{member of the}} genus Pinguinus that lived during the Early Pliocene. Known from bones found in the Yorktown Formation of the Lee Creek Mine in North Carolina, it is {{believed}} to have split, along with the great auk, from a common ancestor. Pinguinus alfrednewtoni lived in the western Atlantic, while the great auk lived in the eastern Atlantic. After the former died out following the Pliocene, the great auk took over its territory. The great auk <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>related</b> closely to the other extinct genera of flightless alcids, Mancalla, Praemancalla, and Alcodes.|$|E
5|$|After the season, it {{was rumored}} that the Redskins were {{interested}} in promoting him to replace head coach Turk Edwards, but the franchise denied it and Shaughnessy {{would not comment on}} his plans. In January 1947, he quit as Maryland coach, stating {{that he did not want}} to remain athletic director or resign from the Washington Redskins, both of which the school wanted. Shaughnessy said he would work full-time for the Redskins for the remaining year on his contract, and might return to coach only college football at the end of his term, possibly with Maryland. President Byrd affirmed that Shaughnessy's poor 1946 record <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>related</b> to his departure. He was replaced by split T proponent Jim Tatum.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, Moxon and Carla Smith had a daughter, Stacy Grove Meyer. Meyer died on June 25, 2000 {{after she}} {{fell off a}} ladder and was {{electrocuted}} after touching a 7,200-volt wire while working at Golden Era Productions. Golden Era Productions was cited by the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health for improper wiring precautions near a vault where Grove Meyer had been working. The California Occupational Safety and Health Administration investigated the incident, and determined that her death <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>related</b> to the safety violations at the facility. Grove Meyer had worked for two years at Golden Era Productions in landscaping and maintenance.|$|E

5|$|NATO {{increased}} its naval {{presence in the}} Black Sea significantly following the Russian invasion, with ships docking in Georgian ports, {{and according to the}} US Navy, delivering humanitarian aid. NATO said that its presence in the Black Sea <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>related</b> to the Georgian crisis; its vessels were conducting typical visits and preplanned naval exercises with Romania and Bulgaria. Russian General Anatoliy Nogovitsyn reminded NATO of the limit on the number of vessels allowed in the Black Sea under the 1936 Montreux convention. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev questioned the claim that ships going to Georgia were bringing only humanitarian assistance, alleging the delivery of military material. According to political analyst Vladimir Socor, the US maintained a continual presence in the Black Sea. The ships were rotated {{from time to time in}} the Black Sea because of the constraints on ship's weight and length of visits set by the Montreux Convention.|$|E
5|$|On May 30, 1968, after {{a wrestling}} show in Monterrey, Nuevo León, Vázquez, and fellow wrestler Popeye Franco, {{were killed by}} a Cantena owner during a fight. Records are unclear if Eusebio Vázquez had any children, {{but it is clear}} that the wrestler who later worked as Espanto Jr. and claimed to be the son of Eusebio Vázquez <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>related</b> at all. That Espanto Jr., Jesús Andrade Salas, was allowed to use the name by Espanto II. Later on other Espantos would follow in the {{footsteps}} of the character that Eusebio Vázquez created, including his nephews Espanto IV and V, Los Hijos del Espanto, Espantito, and a new Espanto Jr., son of the original Espanto.|$|E
5|$|P. lanceolata shrubs {{destroyed}} by bushfire regenerate through seedlings surviving through seedbank in the soil. The Ku-ring-gai Chase {{study found that}} seedlings germinated within two years of a 1994 bushfire, although some appeared up to six years afterwards, while germination <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>related</b> to any particular season. Plants take six years to reach maturity. Thus, more frequent bushfires prevent recruitment and hence endanger populations. However, plants in Lane Cove National Park were recorded maturing three years after an especially intense bushfire. What triggers germination is unknown, and seedlings have also arisen from areas disturbed by sand mining, sometimes growing in higher concentrations than before the disturbance. The natural lifespan of a plant appears to range from 25 to 60 years.|$|E

5|$|Roger was {{the eldest}} brother of William, but died childless during their father's lifetime. The next son, John, {{inherited}} the family lands, but died around 1149 without children. William then inherited the lands. John and William had a sister called Margaret, {{who was the}} wife of Haimo de St Clair. Their father married a second time, and had a son named Simon by that marriage. William took his surname from his mother's family, as did his half-brother Simon, who <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>related</b> to the Chesney family except by marriage. Two further children of Robert's, Elias and Peter, are known, but whether they were {{the children of the}} first marriage or the second is unclear. Chesney should be distinguished from another William de Chesney, who controlled the town of Oxford and its castle as well as the town of Deddington and its castle in the same time period.|$|E
5|$|The High Court {{rejected}} the plaintiffs' argument that, by compulsorily acquiring a temple, the Government was limiting a person's right under Article 15(1) of the Constitution to profess, practice and propagate {{his or her}} religion, and that this in turn gave him or her {{the legal right to}} commence an action on the ground that where an individual's constitutional rights are affected, he or she has a sufficient interest to ensure that his or her rights are protected. The court ruling held that this land acquisition matter was not in any way related to religious freedom. Because the acquisition <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>related</b> to religious freedom, the High Court found that only the trustees who were the legal owners of the temple property had the requisite locus standi to institute proceedings if they deemed their rights to have been infringed.|$|E
5|$|The {{series was}} created by Shu Takumi, who wrote and {{directed}} the first three games. The first game was conceived in 2000 when Takumi's boss at the time, Shinji Mikami, gave him six months to create any type of game he wanted to; Takumi had originally joined Capcom wanting to make mystery and adventure games, and {{felt that this was}} a big chance for him to make a mark as a creator. The game was designed to be simple, as Takumi wanted it to be easy enough for even his mother to play. It was originally going to be a detective game, with Phoenix being a private investigator, but at one point Takumi realized that finding and taking apart contradictions <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>related</b> to detective work, and felt that the main setting of the game should be courtrooms.|$|E
