5|$|American {{astronomer}} Edwin Hubble {{observed that}} the distances to faraway galaxies were strongly correlated with their redshifts. This was interpreted to mean that all distant galaxies and clusters are receding away from our vantage point with an apparent velocity proportional to their distance: that is, the farther they are, the faster they move away from us, regardless of direction. Assuming the Copernican principle (that the Earth is not {{the center of the}} universe), the only remaining interpretation is that all observable regions of the universe are receding from all others. Since <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> distance between galaxies increases today, it must mean that in the past galaxies were closer together. The continuous expansion of the universe implies that the universe was denser and hotter in the past.|$|E
5|$|Caprioli's {{memorial}} {{was broken}} {{up in the}} nineteenth century, so only the Caprioli Adoration remains. A masterpiece of Cairano's, this was placed in 1841 by Rodolfo Vantini on the high altar of the St Francis of Assisi church. Cairano demonstrates a high technical mastery, {{not only in the}} extremely precise orientation of the boxes, but also in the choice of the monolithic block, which, in fact, is not strictly necessary for this kind of work. From Bernardino Faino and Francesco Paglia and other seventeenth and eighteenth century scholars, <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> relief was placed by some architectural system. It {{was supposed to be a}} figurative piece, created perhaps by the same artist, but which has not been traced.|$|E
5|$|Despite its {{architectural}} prominence, {{very little}} is known of the church's history and its precise architecture. Most of {{the information on the}} church's original appearance is derived from the epigram in honour of Juliana and her family, which was inscribed in pieces {{in various parts of the}} church. The epigram claims that the church was laid out as a replica of the ancient Jewish Temple with the precise proportions given in the Bible for the Temple of Solomon, and using the royal cubit as a unit of measure, as in its model. Richard Martin Harrison, the site's chief excavator, has reconstructed the church as a roughly square basilica, ca. 52 m long on the sides, with a central nave and two side aisles, fronted by a narthex and preceded by a large atrium of 26 m length. To the north of the atrium, remains of another building have been identified as either the church's baptistery or Juliana's palace. An oval substructure in the building's center indicates the position of the ambon, while strong foundations throughout the building indicate, according to Harrison, the presence of a dome, bringing the estimated height of the building to over 30 m. The area of the altar was not sufficiently excavated, and its shape remains unknown. The possible presence of a dome, although not universally accepted, is of major importance, since it would mean that it was St. Polyeuctus, and not Justinian's churches (Saints Sergius and Bacchus and the Hagia Sophia), which first combined the traditional basilica with a dome. From the epigram, <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> interior featured two storeys with colonnades and galleries. Based on the epigram and the substructures, Harrison also posited the existence of a pair of two-storey exedrae, composed of three niches with a pier in between, on the northern and southern sides of the ambo. The spaces around the domed western bay would have been covered with barrel or cross-vaults.|$|E

25|$|We do not {{understand}} exactly how Renaissance artists thought about the Oriental carpets they were depicting. <b>We</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Venetian Piazza San Marco was adorned with carpets hanging from {{the windows of the}} surrounding palaces and houses on special occasions. Like the beautiful ladies looking out of the windows, the carpets function as a decorative framework, and highlight the important action which is going on. Similar to the inaccurate pseudo-kufic writing in contemporary paintings, the European artists borrowed something from another culture which they, essentially, did {{not understand}}.|$|E

25|$|This {{frontier}} {{remained for}} about 100 years, {{and no doubt}} in that long period much was done to it to which precise dates are difficult to fix.

But <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> pressure of the barbarians began to be felt seriously in the later part of the 2nd century, and after long struggles the whole or almost the whole district east of the Rhine and north of the Danube was lost, seemingly all within one short period, about 250.|$|E
25|$|But {{my family}} {{acquired}} {{in the time of}} my father a plot of land upper than Mart Moura. It is called Marg el-Dayr and it belonged to the family Mousa. Its conversion into an orchard caused the cleaning of an oratory in decline devoted to Saint Augustine. Would it be rather there the place of celebration of the synod? I prefer to believe it because the place in question is on the border of the famous village of Bqoufa, also ruined, but from which <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> prelates of the family Rizzi are originated, prelates who led our Church in those times with three successive patriarchs.|$|E
25|$|The {{opinion that}} the Agathyrsi were almost {{certainly}} Thracians results also from the writings preserved by Stephen of Byzantium, who explains that the Greeks called the Trausi the Agathyrsi, and <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Trausi lived in the Rhodope Mountains. Certain details from their way of life, such as tattooing, also suggest that the Agathyrsi were Thracians. Their place was later taken by the Dacians. That the Dacians were of Thracian stock is not in doubt, and {{it is safe to}} assume that this new name also encompassed the Agathyrsi, and perhaps other neighboring Thracian people as well, as a result of some political upheaval.|$|E

25|$|A {{consequence}} of sensitivity to initial conditions {{is that if}} we start with a limited amount of information about the system (as is usually the case in practice), then beyond a certain time the system is no longer predictable. This is most familiar in the case of weather, which is generally predictable only about a week ahead. Of course, {{this does not mean that}} we cannot say anything about events far in the future; some restrictions on the system are present. With weather, <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> temperature will not naturally reach 100°C or fall to -130°C on earth (during the current geologic era), but we can't say exactly what day will have the hottest temperature of the year.|$|E
25|$|The {{supremum}} axiom of the reals {{refers to}} subsets of the reals {{and is therefore}} a second-order logical statement. It {{is not possible to}} characterize the reals with first-order logic alone: the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem implies that there exists a countable dense subset of the real numbers satisfying exactly the same sentences in first-order logic as the real numbers themselves. The set of hyperreal numbers satisfies the same first order sentences as R. Ordered fields that satisfy the same first-order sentences as R are called nonstandard models of R. This is what makes nonstandard analysis work; by proving a first-order statement in some nonstandard model (which may be easier than proving it in R), <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> same statement must also be true of R.|$|E
25|$|Khand (Evil) – Tolkien wrote {{even less}} about Khand {{than he did}} about Harad, though <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> only thing implied about them is that the armor they wore covered - {{literally}} - their entire bodies ("Variags who hated the sun"), and that their weapons may be their own design of Haradrim and Easterling weapons. Games Workshop has based their Variags of Khand on the Mongols and the Japanese, featuring sashimonos and the unique chariots, despite the Easterlings being the only culture in Middle-earth with chariots in Tolkien's writings. It was suggested that the Gondorians were unaware of the lands further east, and thus {{the names of the}} Variags and Wainriders had been mixed-up. Khand allies with the Easterlings (and the Haradrim) frequently.|$|E

25|$|Thirumalai Nayaka was {{assisted}} by his Dalavay Ramappayan, {{who was also}} the Prime Minister and Commander-in-Chief of the Madurai Army. Ramappayan helped crush the rebellion of the Setupatis of Ramnad. The Setupathi and his Maravas withdrew to the island of Pamban and procured the assistance of Europeans. While at the verge of attaining victory of the Setupathi, Ramapayyan suddenly fell sick and died. He was succeeded by his son-in-law Siva Ramaya who proved himself well worthy of the post and captured a nephew of the Setupati, Tanakka Tevan. With the Setupathi himself imprisoned, the Maravas of Ramnad quietly submitted {{to the authority of}} Siva Ramaya. From a historical document Ramappayyan Ammanai, <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Dalavoy Ramappayan, a Brahmin, had also proven his mettle in the war against Randaula Khan and Sriranga III between 1639 and 1641.|$|E
25|$|Once we {{have found}} the {{augmented}} shortest path, {{we want to make}} sure we ignore any other paths that are longer than this shortest paths. BFS algorithm marks nodes in path with distance with source being 0. Thus, after doing BFS, we can start at each unmatched vertex in U, follow the path by following nodes with distance that increments by 1. When we finally arrive at the destination vDummy, if its distance is 1 more than last node in V then <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> path we followed is (one of the possibly many) shortest path. In that case we can go ahead and update the pairing for vertices on path in U and V. Note that each vertex in V on path, except for the last one, is non-free vertex. So updating pairing for these vertices in V to different vertices in U is equivalent to removing previously matched edge and adding new unmatched edge in matching. This is same as doing the symmetric difference (i.e. remove edges common to previous matching and add non-common edges in augmented path in new matching).|$|E

500|$|According to Wallace, [...] "for us Aspasia herself {{possesses}} and can possess {{almost no}} historical reality". Hence, Madeleine M.

She finally concludes that [...] "it is possible to map only the barest possibilities for [...] life". According to Charles W. Fornara and Loren J.

500|$|These three {{formations}} {{were laid}} down {{over a period}} of 30million years from early-to-middle Cambrian time. [...] Trilobites followed by brachiopods are the most commonly reported fossils in this group but well-preserved fossils are relatively rare. <b>We</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> shoreline was transgressing (advancing onto land) because finer grade material was deposited on top of coarser-grained sediment. Today, the Tonto Group makes up the Tonto Platform seen above and following the Colorado River; the Tapeats Sandstone and Muav Limestone form the platform's cliffs and the Bright Angel Shale forms its slopes. Unlike the Proterozoic units below it, the Tonto Group's beds basically lie in their original horizontal position. The Bright Angel Shale in the group forms an aquiclude (barrier to groundwater seeping down), and thus collects and directs water through the overlying Muav Limestone to feed springs in the Inner Gorge.|$|E
