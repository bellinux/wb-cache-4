5|$|All {{observation}} involves both {{perception and}} cognition. That is, {{one does not}} make an observation passively, but rather is actively engaged in distinguishing the phenomenon being observed from surrounding sensory data. Therefore, observations are affected by one's underlying understanding {{of the way in}} <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> functions, and that understanding may influence what is perceived, noticed, or deemed worthy of consideration. In this sense, {{it can be argued that}} all observation is theory-laden.|$|E
5|$|In {{the course}} of the 1960s and 1970s, Cold War {{participants}} struggled to adjust to a new, more complicated pattern of international relations in <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> was no longer divided into two clearly opposed blocs. From the beginning of the post-war period, Western Europe and Japan rapidly recovered from the destruction of World War II and sustained strong economic growth through the 1950s and 1960s, with per capita GDPs approaching those of the United States, while Eastern Bloc economies stagnated.|$|E

5|$|Central Europe {{became the}} centre of silver {{production}} during the Middle Ages, as the Mediterranean deposits exploited by the ancient civilisations had been exhausted. Silver mines were opened in Bohemia, Saxony, Erzgebirge, Alsace, the Lahn region, Siegerland, Silesia, Hungary, Norway, Steiermark, Salzburg, and the southern Black Forest. Most of these ores were quite rich in silver and could simply be separated by hand from the remaining rock and then smelted; some deposits of native silver were also encountered. Many of these mines were soon exhausted, {{but a few of}} them remained active until the Industrial Revolution, before <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> production of silver was around a meagre 50tonnes per year. In the Americas, high temperature silver-lead cupellation technology was developed by pre-Inca civilizations as early as AD 60–120; silver deposits in India, China, Japan, and pre-Columbian America continued to be mined during this time.|$|E
25|$|Thus, imaginaries are {{directly}} responsible for all aspects of culture. The Greeks had an imaginary by <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> stems from Chaos and the ancient Jews an imaginary by <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> stems from the will of a pre-existing entity, God. The former developed therefore a system of immediate democracy where the laws were ever changing according to the people's will while the second a theocratic system according to which man is in an eternal quest to understand and enforce the will of God.|$|E

5000|$|Medieval {{aesthetics}} in {{the realm}} of philosophy built upon Classical thought, continuing the practice of Plotinus by employing theological terminology in its explications. St. Bonaventure's [...] "Retracing the Arts to Theology", a primary example of this method, discusses the skills of the artisan as gifts given by God for the purpose of disclosing God to mankind, which purpose is achieved through four lights: the light of skill in mechanical arts <b>which</b> discloses <b>the</b> <b>world</b> of artifacts; <b>which</b> light is guided by the light of sense perception <b>which</b> discloses <b>the</b> <b>world</b> of natural forms; which light, consequently, is guided by the light of philosophy <b>which</b> discloses <b>the</b> <b>world</b> of intellectual truth; finally, this light is guided by the light of divine wisdom <b>which</b> discloses <b>the</b> <b>world</b> of saving truth.|$|R
25|$|The {{notion of}} Svatantrya {{is central to}} Somananda's philosophy. The free-will of Shiva is {{manifested}} as energy, called Shakti, which emanates from Shiva himself and is the stuff from <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> is created, thus, being ontologically anterior to the world, it is beyond any obstacles. When Shakti begins the process of manifestation it subdivides {{into a number of}} ontological categories or substances called tattvas, 36 in number. Thus, the world is considered real (not illusory, as in other monistic idealistic spiritual schools).|$|E
25|$|As the Soviet Union {{continued}} to maintain tight control over its {{sphere of influence}} in Eastern Europe, the Cold War gave way to Détente and a more complicated pattern of international relations in the 1970s in <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> was no longer clearly split into two clearly opposed blocs. Less powerful countries had more room to assert their independence, and the two superpowers were partially able to recognize their common interest in trying to check the further spread and proliferation of nuclear weapons in treaties such as SALT I, SALT II, and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.|$|E

25|$|This {{relationship}} between distance and intimacy, between imagery and sound, is {{also present in}} the opening sequence to The Wind Will Carry Us. Michael J. Anderson has argued that such a thematic application of this central concept of presence without presence, through using such techniques, and by often referring to characters which the viewer does not see and sometimes not hear directly affects the nature and concept of space in the geographical framework in <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> is portrayed. Kiarostami's use of sound and imagery conveys a world beyond what is directly visible and/or audible, which Anderson believes emphasizes the interconnectedness and shrinking {{of time and space}} in the modern world of telecommunications.|$|E
25|$|That {{the history}} of {{religion}} is cyclic and is renewed every seven millennia. The present cycle {{from the time of}} the Biblical Adam is split into seven epochs or ages, parallel to the seven days of the week, with periods for light and darkness. Mirza Ghulam Ahmad appeared as the promised Messiah at the sixth epoch heralding the seventh and final age of mankind, as a day in the estimation of God is like a thousand years of man's reckoning. According to Ghulam Ahmad, just as the sixth day of the week is reserved for Jumu'ah (congregational prayers), likewise his age is destined for a global assembling of mankind in <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> is to unite under one universal religion: Islam.|$|E
25|$|The Rugby World Cup Sevens is World Rugby's {{equivalent}} to the (15-man) Rugby World Cup. It is also held every four years, and was originally scheduled in the odd-numbered years in which the 15-man RWC was not held. The competition was first held in 1993. New Zealand won in 2001, were losing finalists to Fiji in 2005, and won the most recent edition in 2013 in Moscow. The 2013 edition was originally intended {{to be the last}} because of the impending establishment of an Olympic sevens tournament in 2016. World Rugby (then known as the IRB) later decided to retain the World Cup Sevens, and established a new four-year cycle in <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> Cup will be held in even-numbered non-Olympic years. As such, the next edition is to be held in 2018 in the San Francisco Bay Area.|$|E

25|$|In 2006, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, {{established}} the Covenant Design Group (CDG) {{to draft a}} covenant for the Anglican Communion. The CDG met between 2007 and 2009, producing three successive drafts: the Nassau Draft Covenant (2007), the St. Andrews Draft Covenant (2008), and the Ridley Cambridge Draft Covenant (2009). Each draft was indebted to previous ecumenical covenants that Anglicans had either proposed or entered into. The origins of Anglican ecumenical covenants date to the 1964 British Conference on Faith and Order, although this was indebted to the ecumenical covenanting <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> Council of Churches endorsed in 1948. However, since the late 1960s, Anglicans have discussed and debated several plans for greater integration of the Anglican Communion. Most recently, these proposals have incorporated significant discussions of canon law. The Anglican Covenant depends upon these discussions as well.|$|E
25|$|The trio then confronts Paradox, who {{reveals that}} {{he comes from}} a future beyond Yusei's in <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> lies in ruins, and claims {{that the only way to}} fix it is to {{eliminate}} Duel Monsters from history. However, the three heroes protest that by doing so all the future events and people will be erased as well, and challenge him to a duel. By combining the powers of their key monsters, Yugi, Jaden and Yusei defeat Paradox, who disappears. After the duel, Yusei, Jaden and Yugi say that they will do what they can to make sure the future is not like Paradox's, and say goodbye and the latter two return to their respective time periods. New Domino City returns to normal, and Yusei finally can let go of the past and focus on the future.|$|E
25|$|A.A. Barb {{connected}} Abyzou {{and similar}} female demons to the Sumerian myth of primeval Sea. Barb argued {{that although the}} name “Abyzou” {{appears to be a}} corrupted form of the Greek word abyssos ("the abyss"), the Greek itself was borrowed from Assyrian Apsu or Sumerian Abzu, the undifferentiated sea from <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> was created in the Sumerian belief system, equivalent to Babylonian Tiamat, or Hebrew Tehom in the Book of Genesis. The entity Sea was originally bi- or asexual, later dividing into male Abzu (fresh water) and female Tiamat (salt water). The female demons among whom Lilith is the best-known are often said to have come from the primeval sea. In classical Greece, female sea monsters that combine allure and deadliness may also derive from this tradition, including the Gorgons (who were daughters of the old sea god Phorcys), Sirens, Harpies, and even water nymphs and Nereids.|$|E
