Both models are employed to simulate the behavior of a planetary gear set typically adopted in <b>wind</b> <b>turbines.</b> <b>Geared</b> transmissions have been a popular choice to transmit the rotation of the main rotor to the electrical generator in this type of turbine. Compared to other kinds of transmission, a gearbox is more compact, robust and require low maintenance over its lifetime, which is interesting, since these turbines are usually installed in remote places. The gearbox of a <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> is normally composed by a set of spur gears and bearings, assembled in arrangement known as epicyclic. Spur gears generally have an involute profile, which allows a constant transmission of the angular speed. This kinematic constraint between gears is defined by the angle that the surface of their teeth is in contact with. This angle is known as pressure angle and, by design, it should remain constant during operation. However, a variation of the distance between gears changes this angle, which also changes the direction of the transmission of the movement. To account for this effect, the joint is described by the projection of the absolute velocity of the contact point of each gear on the line of action, which is calculated from their position. Another important group of elements are the bearings that support gear and shafts. They can absorb part of the vibration, and compensate misalignments and teeth surface failures. Hydrodynamic bearings are widely employed in turbomachinery, due to their simplicity, long life and good damping properties, which are features that <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> can benefit from.

40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} obtain lower cost of energy for wind {{turbines}} fault detection and accommodation is important. Expensive condition monitoring systems are often used to monitor the condition of rotating and vibrating system parts. One example is the gearbox in a wind turbine. This system is operated in parallel to the control system, using different computers and additional often expensive sensors. In this paper a simple filter based algorithm is proposed to detect changes in a resonance frequency in a system, exemplified with faults resulting in changes in the resonance frequency in the wind turbine gearbox. Only the generator speed measurement which is available in even simple wind turbine control systems is used as input. Consequently this proposed scheme does not need additional sensors and computers for monitoring {{the condition of the}} wind gearbox. The scheme is evaluated on a wide-spread wind turbine fault detection and fault tolerant control benchmark model, in which one of the included faults results in a change in the gear box resonance frequency. This evaluation shows the potential of the proposed scheme to monitor the condition of <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> <b>gear</b> boxes in the existing control system...|$|E
40|$|To {{reduce the}} {{maintenance}} cost, avoid catastrophic failure, {{and improve the}} wind transmission system reliability, online condition monitoring system is critical important. In the real applications, many rotating mechanical faults, such as bearing surface defect, gear tooth crack, chipped gear tooth and so on generate impulsive signals. When there are these types of faults developing inside rotating machinery, each time the rotating components pass over the damage point, an impact force could be generated. The impact force will cause a ringing of the support structure at the structural natural frequency. By effectively detecting those periodic impulse signals, one group of rotating machine faults could be detected and diagnosed. However, in real wind turbine operations, impulsive fault signals are usually relatively weak to the background noise and vibration signals generated from other healthy components, such as shaft, blades, gears and so on. Moreover, wind turbine transmission systems work under dynamic operating conditions. This will further increase the difficulties in fault detection and diagnostics. Therefore, developing advanced signal processing methods to enhance the impulsive signals is in great needs. In this paper, an adaptive filtering technique will be applied for enhancing the fault impulse signals-to-noise ratio in <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> <b>gear</b> transmission systems. Multiple statistical features designed to quantify the impulsive signals of the processed signal are extracted for bearing fault detection. The multiple dimensional features are then transformed into one dimensional feature. A minimum error rate classifier will be designed based on the compressed feature to identify the gear transmission system with defect.

40|$|Industrial {{gear box}} {{lubricants}} typically are hydrocarbon based mineral oils with considerable amounts of additives {{to overcome the}} lack of base fluid properties like wear protection, oxidation stability, load carrying capacity, low temperature solidification and drop of viscosity at higher temperatures. For today's wind turbine gearboxes, the requirements are more severe and synthetic hydrocarbon oils are used to improve on this, but all such hydrocarbon based lubricants require significant amounts of Extreme Pressure (EP) additives to meet performance requirements. Perfluoropolyether (PFPE) fluids provide load carrying capacity as an inherent property. During {{the course of the}} project with the main tasks of 'Establish a Benchmark', 'Lubricant Evaluation', 'Full Scale Gearbox Trial' and 'Economic Evaluation', the PAO Reference oil exhibited significant changes after laboratory gear testing, in service operation in the field and full scale gearbox trial. Four hydrocarbon base oils were selected for comparison in the benchmarking exercise and showed variation with respect to meeting the requirements for the laboratory micro-pitting tests, while the PFPE fluid exceeded the requirements even with the material taken after the full scale gear box trial. This is remarkable for a lubricant without EP additives. Laboratory bearing tests performed on the PFPE fluids before and after the full scale gear box trial showed the results met requirements for the industry standard. The PFPE fluid successfully completed the full scale gear box test program which included baseline and progressive staged load testing. The evaluation of gears showed no micro-pitting or objectionable wear. By the final stage, lubricant film thickness had been reduced to just 21 % of its original value, this was by design and resulted in a lambda ratio of well below 1. This test design scenario of a low lambda ratio is a very undesirable lubrication condition for real world but creates the ability to test the lubricating fluids performance under the most extreme conditions. The PAO Reference oil also passed its testing without any noticeable deterioration of the gear surface. However the PAO Reference oil was replaced midway through the progressive loading, as the lubricant was burned in an attempt to raise the sump temperature to the same levels as for the PFPE. Both materials experienced a decrease of viscosity during their respective run times. The viscosity index decreased for the PAO there while there was a slight increase for the PFPE. FZG laboratory gear tests and measurements of the drive motor's current during the full scale gear box trial were made to characterize the relative efficiency between the PFPE fluid and the PAO Reference oil. In the FZG laboratory efficiency test, the PFPE fluids show much higher churning losses due to their higher viscosity and density. The analysis seems to show that the efficiency correlates better to dynamic viscosity than any other of the measured metrics such as film thickness. In load stages where the load, speed and temperature are similar, the PFPE fluid has a greater film thickness and theoretical gear protection, but requires a larger current for the drive motor than the PAO. However in load stages where the film thickness is the same, the PFPE fluid's reduced dynamic viscosity gives it a slight efficiency advantage relative to the PAO reference oil. Ultimately, many factors such as temperature, rotational speed, and fluid viscosity combine in a complex fashion to influence the results. However, the PFPE's much lower change of viscosity with respect to temperature, allows variations in designing an optimum viscosity to balance efficiency versus gear protection. Economic analysis was done using Cost of Energy calculations. The results vary from 5. 3 % for a 'Likely Case' to 16. 8 % for a 'Best Case' scenario as potential cost improvement by using PFPE as the gearbox lubricating fluid. It is important to note the largest portion of savings comes in Levelized Replacement Cost, which is dictated by the assumption on gearbox reliability. Thus, verifying and quantifying the potential of PFPE fluid to effect gearbox reliability is the key assumption that would need to be further validated. In summary the proof of concept to use PFPE fluid as <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> <b>gear</b> box lubricant was validated with this project. The increase in life time was qualitatively demonstrated and this supports the need for future activity of field trials and laboratory aging studies to quantify the predicted 20 year life. With micro-pitting being the major failure mechanism in the last years, recent publications show that white etch cracking of bearings seem to have the highest impact on wind turbine reliability. With its higher film thicknesses compared to PAO reference oils, PFPE fluids have the potential to reduce this failure occurrence as well...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to develop an integrated multibody dynamics computational framework for the deterministic and reliability-based design optimization of wind turbine drivetrains to obtain an optimal <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> <b>gear</b> design that ensures a target reliability under wind load and gear manufacturing uncertainties. Gears in wind turbine drivetrains are subjected to severe cyclic loading due to variable wind loads that are stochastic in nature. Thus, the failure rate of drivetrain systems is reported to be relatively higher than the other wind turbine components. It is known in wind energy industry that improving reliability of drivetrain designs is one of the key issues to make wind energy competitive as compared to fossil fuels. Furthermore, a wind turbine is a multi-physics system involving random wind loads, rotor blade aerodynamics, gear dynamics, electromagnetic generator and control systems. This makes an accurate prediction of product life of drivetrains challenging and very limited studies have been carried out regarding design optimization including the reliability-based design optimization (RBDO) of geared systems considering wind load and manufacturing uncertainties. In order to address these essential and challenging issues on design optimization of wind turbine drivetrains under wind load and gear manufacturing uncertainties, the following issues are discussed in this study: (1) development of an efficient numerical procedure for gear dynamics simulation of complex multibody geared systems based on the multi-variable tabular contact search algorithm to account for detailed gear tooth contact geometry with profile modifications or surface imperfections; (2) development of an integrated multibody dynamics computational framework for deterministic and reliability-based design optimization of wind turbine drivetrains using the gear dynamics simulation software developed in (1) and RAMDO software by incorporating wide spatiotemporal wind load uncertainty model, pitting gear tooth contact fatigue model, and rotor blade aerodynamics model using NREL AeroDyn/FAST; and (3) deterministic and reliability-based design optimization of wind turbine drivetrain to minimize total weight of a drivetrain system while ensuring 20 -year reliable service life with wind load and gear manufacturing uncertainties using the numerical procedure developed in this study. To account for the wind load uncertainty, the joint probability density function (PDF) of 10 -minute mean wind speed (V₁₀) and 10 -minute turbulence intensity (I₁₀) is introduced for wind turbine drivetrain dynamics simulation. To consider wide spatiotemporal wind uncertainty (i. e., wind load uncertainty for different locations and in different years), uncertainties of all the joint PDF parameters of V₁₀, I₁₀ and copula are considered, and PDF for each parameter is identified using 249 sets of wind data. This wind uncertainty model allows for the consideration of a wide range of probabilistic wind loads in the contact fatigue life prediction. For a given V₁₀ and I₁₀ obtained from the stochastic wind model, the random time-domain wind speed data is generated using NREL TurbSim, and then inputted into NREL FAST to perform the aerodynamic simulation of rotor blades to predict the transmitted torque and speed of the main shaft of the drivetrain that are sent to the multibody gear dynamics simulation as an input. In order to predict gear contact fatigue life, a high-fidelity gear dynamics simulation model that considers the detailed gear contact geometry as well as the mesh stiffness variation needs to be developed to find the variability of maximum contact stresses under wind load uncertainty. This, however, leads to a computationally intensive procedure. To eliminate the computationally intensive iterative online collision detection algorithm, a numerical procedure for the multibody gear dynamics simulation based on the tabular contact search algorithm is proposed. Look-up contact tables are generated for a pair of gear tooth profiles by the contact geometry analysis prior to the dynamics simulation and the contact points that fulfill the non-conformal contact condition and mesh stiffness at each contact point are calculated for all pairs of gears in the drivetrain model. This procedure allows for the detection of gear tooth contact in an efficient manner while retaining the precise contact geometry and mesh stiffness variation in the evaluation of mesh forces, thereby leading to a computationally efficient gear dynamics simulation suited for the design optimization procedure considering wind load uncertainty. Furthermore, the accuracy of mesh stiffness model introduced in this study and transmission error of gear tooth with tip relief are discussed, and a wind turbine drivetrain model developed using this approach is validated against test data provided in the literature. The gear contact fatigue life is predicted based on the gear tooth pitting fatigue criteria and is defined by the sum of the number of stress cycles required for the fatigue crack initiation and the number required for the crack to propagate from the initial to the critical crack length based on Paris-Erdogan equation for Mode II fracture. All the above procedures are integrated into the reliability-based design optimization software RAMDO for design optimization and reliability analysis of wind turbine drivetrains under wind load and manufacturing uncertainties. A 750 kW GRC wind turbine gearbox model is used to perform the design optimization and the reliability analysis. A deterministic design optimization (DDO) is performed first using an averaged joint PDF of wind load to ensure a 20 -year service life. To this end, gear face width and tip relief (profile modification) are selected as design variables and optimized such that 20 -year fatigue life is ensured while minimizing the total weight of drivetrains. It is important to notice here that an increase in face width leads to a decrease in the fatigue damage, but an increase in total weight. On the other hand, the tip relief has almost no effect on the total weight, but it has a major impact on the fatigue damage. It is shown in this study that the optimum tip relief allows for lowering the greatest maximum shear stresses on the tooth surface without relying heavily on face width widening to meet the 20 -year fatigue life constraint and it leads to reduction of total drivetrain weight by 8. 4 %. However, if only face width is considered as design variable, total weight needs to be increased by 4. 7 % to meet the 20 -year fatigue life constraint. Furthermore, the reliability analysis at the DDO optimum design is carried out considering the large spatiotemporal wind load uncertainty and gear manufacturing uncertainty. Local surrogate models at DDO optimum design are generated using Dynamic Kriging method in RAMDO software to evaluate the gear contact fatigue damage. 49. 5 % reliability is obtained at the DDO optimum design, indicating that the probability of failure is 50. 5 %, which is as expected for the DDO design. RBDO is, therefore, necessary to further improve the reliability of the wind turbine drivetrain. To this end, the sampling-based reliability analysis is carried out to evaluate the probability of failure for each design using the Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) method. However, the use of a large number of MCS sample points leads to a large number of contact fatigue damage evaluation time using the 10 -minute multibody drivetrain dynamics simulation, resulting in the RBDO calculation process being computational very intensive. In order to overcome the computational difficulty resulting from the use of high-fidelity wind turbine drivetrain dynamics simulation, intermediate surrogate models are created prior to the RBDO process using the Dynamic Kriging method in RAMDO and used throughout the entire RBDO iteration process. It is demonstrated that the RBDO optimum obtained ensures the target 97. 725 % reliability (two sigma quality level) with only 1. 4 % increase in the total weight from the baseline design with 8. 3 % reliability. This result clearly indicates the importance of incorporating the tip relief as a design variable that prevents larger increase in the face width causing an increase in weight. This, however, does not mean that a larger tip relief is always preferred since an optimum tip relief amount depends on stochastic wind loads and an optimum tip relief cannot be found deterministically. Furthermore, accuracy of the RBDO optimum obtained using the intermediate surrogate models is verified by the reliability analysis at the RBDO optimum using the local surrogate models. It is demonstrated that the integrated design optimization procedure developed in this study enables the cost effective and reliable design of wind turbine drivetrains...|$|E

There are limitations for vibration based gear diagnostic methods.

The aim of this work is to diagnosis the level of defects (gear tooth crack, gear tooth spalling and gear tooth breakage) in <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> gearbox using <b>gears</b> meshing stiffness. Varying-time meshing stiffness is used, where, a technique consists of a nonlinear numerical optimization is applied. The optimization uses a dynamic model of the gears mesh and forms an estimate of both time-varying and frequency-varying mesh stiffness that best corresponds to the given set of vibration data. Multi-hour tests were conducted and recordings were acquired using rotational vibration monitoring, where the optimum meshing stiffness was computed. The optimum meshing stiffness with the recording time were highlighted suggesting critical changes in the operation of the gearbox. The results indicate that if one tooth is defected due to cracks, spalling and breakage to reach the setting maximum level, the maintenance regime will be called despite a new damage is prone in the adjacent tooth to save time and cost...|$|R

40|$|Small-scale {{standalone}} <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> {{provide a}} very attractive renewable energy source for off-grid remote communities. Taking advantage of variable-speed turbine technology, which requires a partial- or full-scale power converter, and through integrating an energy storage system, smooth and fast power flow control, maximum power point tracking, and a high-quality power is ensured. Due to high reliability and efficiency, permanent magnet synchronous generator {{seems to be the}} dominating generator type in gearless <b>wind</b> <b>turbines,</b> employed for off-grid applications. However, <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> using <b>geared</b> squirrel-cage induction generator (SCIG) are still widely accepted due to their robustness, simplicity, light weight and low cost. Permanent magnet induction generator, a relatively new induction-based machine, has recently been recognized in the wind energy market as an alternative for permanent magnet synchronous generator. A thorough comparative study, among these three generator types, is conducted in this research in order to enable selection of the most appropriate generator for off-grid wind energy conversion system (WECS), subject to a set of given conditions. The system based on geared SCIG {{has been shown to be}} the most appropriate scheme for a small-scale standalone WECS, supplying a remote area. Different topologies of power electronic converters, employed in WECSs, are overviewed. Among the converters considered, current source converter is identified to have a great potential for off-grid <b>wind</b> <b>turbines.</b> Three current-source inverter-based topologies, validated in the literature for on-grid WECS, are compared for off-grid WECS application. Feasibility study and performance evaluation are conducted through analysis and simulation. Among all, the topology composed of three-phase diode bridge rectifier, DC/DC buck converter, and pulse-width-modulated current-source inverter (PWM-CSI) is identified as a simple and low-cost configuration, offering satisfactory performance for a low-power off-grid WECS. A small-scale standalone wind energy conversion system featuring SCIG, CSI and a novel energy storage integration scheme is proposed and a systematic approach for the dc-link inductor design is presented. In developing the overall dynamic model of the proposed <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> system, detailed models of the system components are derived. A reduced-order generic load model, that is suitable for both balanced and unbalanced load conditions, is developed and combined with the system components in order to enable steady-state and transient simulations of the overall system. A linear small-signal model of the system is developed around three operating points to investigate stability, controllability, and observability of the system. The eigenvalue analysis of the small-signal model shows that the open-loop system is locally stable around operating points 1 and 3, but not 2. Gramian matrices of the linearized system show that the system is completely controllable at the three operating points and completely observable at operating points 1 and 3, but not 2. The closed-loop control system for the proposed <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> system is developed. An effective power management algorithm is employed to maintain the supply-demand power balance through direct control of dc-link current. The generator’s shaft speed is controlled by the buck converter to extract maximum available wind power in normal mode of operation. The excess wind power is dumped when it is not possible to absorb maximum available power by the storage system and the load. The current source inverter is used to control positive- and negative-sequence voltage components separately. The feasibility of the proposed WECS and performance of the control system under variable wind and balanced/unbalanced load conditions are analyzed and demonstrated through simulation. Finally, the proposed WECS is modified by removing the dump load and avoiding the surplus power generation by curtailment of wind power. The operation of the modified system is investigated and verified under variable wind and load conditions...|$|R
