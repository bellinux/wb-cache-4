2500|$|We {{all know}} that Social Security {{is running out of}} money, {{and it has to be}} fixed. You have {{proposed}} to fix it by letting people put some of the money collected to pay benefits into private savings accounts. But the critics are saying that's going to mean finding $1 trillion over the next 10 years to continue paying benefits as those accounts are being set up.

6000|$|He had {{an awful}} longing {{to find out}} from Corey how he ought to go. He {{formulated}} and repeated over to himself an apparently careless question, such as, [...] "Oh, by the way, Corey, <b>where</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> your gloves?" [...] This would naturally lead to some talk on the subject, which would, if properly managed, clear up the whole trouble. But Lapham found that he would rather die than ask this question, or any question that would bring up the dinner again.
