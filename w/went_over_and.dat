5|$|The fifth {{match was}} between Eugene and Jonathan Coachman. The match started with Eugene hitting an arm drag on Coachman and hitting {{numerous}} headbutts. An unknown {{woman in a}} bikini {{came out to the}} ringside area with some cookies, Coachman offered cookies to Eugene. The woman lured Eugene out of the ring and Eugene <b>went</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> grabbed some cookies. As Eugene went to grab more cookies, Coachman slammed Eugene's head into the cookie tray. A spot in the match saw Garrison Cade come out to ringside with a stuffed animal, which prompted Cade to tear up said toy animal. Cade tried to hold Eugene so Coachman could get the advantage, however, Eugene was able dodge the attack, as Coachman ended up hitting Cade instead. Eugene Rock bottomed Coachman and pinned him for the win.|$|E
25|$|On January 6, 2004, the Maple Leafs {{were playing}} {{a game against the}} Nashville Predators, when Leaf captain Mats Sundin's stick broke on an {{attempted}} shot at the blue line and he threw it away in disgust. Instead of hitting the glass, the stick accidentally <b>went</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> into the crowd. The NHL reacted by giving him a one-game suspension. The game he was suspended for was a game against the Senators in Toronto. During the game, Daniel Alfredsson's stick broke, and he immediately faked a toss of his stick into the stands. This caused an uproar with the Maple Leafs, in part because they had also lost the game 7–1. Alfredsson dismissed the Leafs' reaction, calling it an over-reaction. This incident added to the rivalry, and Leafs fans continue to boo Alfredsson at future games.|$|E
25|$|The river rose in mid-April, and by April 19, 1870, judging {{that the}} river was high {{enough to make the}} run, Captain Miller ordered lines cast off. His plan was to drift down with the current, then run the engines in reverse to gain {{steering}} control in the rapids. Going over Copper Ledge Falls, just a few hundred yards downstream, the boat first spun around three times in a powerful eddy just above the drop. Then the bow <b>went</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> the whole boat tilted sharply downwards until the sternwheel was spinning around free in the air. Once the boat hit the bottom of the drop, the sternwheel started to break up, throwing the boat out of control and into some rocks which crushed part of her bow. The boat was twisting and wracking and then a boiler valve broke, filling the engine room with steam. Captain Miller put ashore after this, and the crew repaired the vessel. Fortunately the smashed portion of the bow turned out to be above the waterline, and by 9:00a.m. the next day they were ready to proceed.|$|E

25|$|The Allies {{had begun}} a new {{offensive}} at Amiens on 8 August, and the First Surreys joined {{this at the}} Battle of Albert. 47th Division attacked on 22 August from the old Amiens defences towards an objective called the Green Line, on the high ground east of 'Happy Valley'. 140th Brigade was in support, intended to exploit any success in conjunction with Whippet tanks and the cavalry of the Northumberland Hussars. However, the division's leading brigades encountered stiffer than expected opposition, the tanks and cavalry were unable to get through, and the Green Line was not reached. 140th Brigade therefore made a fresh attack on the night at 01.00 on 24 August. This surprise night attack was a complete success, the regimental historian reporting that 'In brilliant moonlight, and with a splendid barrage, we <b>went</b> <b>over,</b> <b>and</b> were almost immediately in the trenches which formed our objective'. However, the battalion's left-hand company was severely shot up by a German strongpoint that the neighbouring division had failed to capture. The following afternoon the strongpoint was finally suppressed by tanks. The following night the battalion renewed the advance behind a creeping barrage, gaining two miles with almost no opposition.|$|E
25|$|The ECW Originals (Rob Van Dam, Sabu, Tommy Dreamer, and The Sandman) took on The New Breed (Elijah Burke, Kevin Thorn, Marcus Cor Von, and Matt Striker) next. The match {{started off}} with Cor Von working over Sabu. That changed when Cor Von tagged Striker, who missed an elbow after {{whipping}} Sabu into the ropes, allowing The Sandman to get tagged. The Sandman dominated Striker, and eventually tagged Van Dam. Van Dam used also dominated Striker, but was poked in the eye, allowing Striker to tag in Burke. Burke had early success, but Van Dam regained the advantage and tagged The Sandman again. The Sandman worked on Burke until tagging Dreamer. Dreamer also beat down Burke until Cor Von received a blind tag and hit Dreamer from behind. Cor Von attacked Dreamer relentlessly and <b>went</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> punched Sabu, which distracted the referee and allowed Dreamer to be triple-teamed by Thorn, Burke, and Striker. Cor Von tagged in Burke who almost pinned Dreamer. Thorn entered next and almost performed his finishing move called the Original Sin. Dreamer managed to escape {{but was unable to}} tag his partners. Thorn tagged in Cor Von again who also almost pinned Dreamer. Cor Von tagged Thorn again, and Thorn resumed the beat down on Dreamer. Thorn tagged Striker next, and Striker attempted a suplex that Dreamer blocked and Dreamer suplexed Striker instead. Striker did not try to tag his partners and tried to stop Dreamer, but Dreamer tagged in Sabu. Sabu began to manhandle Striker and executed a leg drop from the top rope. Van Dam was then tagged in. Burke broke up Van Dam's pin attempt, which led to all competitors entering the ring. While the referee was distracted, Ariel gave Striker a chair. But Van Dam gave Striker an Van Daminator when he kicked the chair into Striker's face. Van Dam pinned Striker after a Five-Star Frog Splash to win the match for The Originals.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the start}} of the war Brody's train station had gone up in flames. Now a {{ramshackle}} buffet had been set up in one of the ruins. When I entered, the place was packed with officers, who were standing at the buffet or around small tables, consuming borshch. I noticed that the soup bowls bore a Hebrew inscription that read [...] "mazel tov", congratulations. The china had been evidently stolen from a Jewish hotel…The road to Brody was flanked by burned and desolate cottages. In the distance we saw a broad field covered with ruins. Soon the devastated town emerged from the grey mist of an early winter morning. There were blackened chimneys and burned walls as far as we could see, visible beneath a dusting of downy snow. The town looked like the ancient, mossy remnants of Pompeii. I noticed the schorched wall of a synagogue. Above the door, some Hebrew words had survived: How awesome is this place [...] The verse was fitting for the ruins of the house of worship and for the entire spread of the shattered neighbourhood. Nestled among the wreckage I saw a small cottage almost embedded in the earth. It looked as if it had crouched down during the conflagration, hidden in the ground, and therefore survived. An old Jewish man was standing nearby, as poor and hunched as the cottage itself. When he saw me and my friend in our uniforms, he whipped off his cap and bowed deeply. I <b>went</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> asked in Yiddish, [...] "How come your cottage escaped the fire?" [...] The old man gaped at me, then shrugged and sighed. [...] "Perhaps a miracle… Heaven granted us a place to starve to death." [...] I gave him a rouble. He was so amazed he forgot to thank me. He stood motionless, gawking. We walked on among the burned ruins. I noticed something that I would see again and again: at every street corner, shiny metal signs in Russian had been nailed to the walls. The occupiers had given every street a fancy, new name: Pushkin Street, Gogol Street, Lermontov Street, and even Turgenev Street, if I remember correctly. The irony of naming these horribly deformed street after the luminaries of Russian culture had escaped the victors: they did not realize how offensive it was to the memory of our great Russian authors...|$|E
