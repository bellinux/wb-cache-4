He got a lovely clap at Northampton a few <b>weeks</b> <b>ago</b> <b>when</b> he was taken off. I don't think that happened by coincidence. And I've got a feeling that if he leaves Cheltenham he will get a similar reception if he comes back with another club. Supporters recognise him and they see the whole-heartedness and the commitment and the ability that he has got.|$|E
25|$|Although HRT {{admitted}} {{they crossed the}} line two <b>weeks</b> <b>ago</b> <b>when</b> they reported {{the results of the}} exit polls conducted by RTL and Nova TV, they once again 'borrowed' the results for the second round election night. This caused a stir within HRT against the main editor of the news program Hloverka Novak-Srzić who was faced with scandals long before the election night incident. Finally, exactly nine days after the election, on 19 January, she was released of her duties as chief editor.|$|E

On July 21, when he reached Carretas, Chihuahua, Gatewood encountered another Army officer, Lieutenant James Parker of the 4th Cavalry, who had orders to follow Geronimo's trail.

2500|$|According to Ratcliff, Sue getting {{pregnant}} {{put her in}} a dilemma because she worried that happiness for the Osmans would need to be curtailed if she decided to leave the programme; she felt this would be unfair on viewers because of all the misery Sue had been put through on-screen already. Discussing this in 1987, Ratcliff said, [...] "I knew nothing about the baby plans until a few <b>weeks</b> <b>ago</b> <b>when</b> I came back from my holidays and was told that Sue was pregnant again. Sue has gone through enough {{in the last couple of}} years. I'm glad she's got her dearest wish [...] I think she'll make a great mum and I'm sure Ali will be supportive. Hopefully, the storylines will open up for me, but it also means that if the pregnancy goes well and the baby is fine, it would be very difficult for me to leave without there being another tragedy in the Osman family. I don't think that would be fair on the show or the viewers." ...|$|E

The last vision he had had of the young girl was one redolent of joy and love and trust, sufficient to reassure him that all was well with her, in regard to his schemes; but on that same evening a <b>week</b> <b>ago</b> he had gazed upon another little scene, which had not filled him with either joy or security.|$|R
5000|$|Future Ted {{starts off}} by {{explaining}} that Barney's {{way of dealing}} with stress was imagining he was being interviewed by CBS sportscaster Jim Nantz. Barney recaps his story, which began at MacLaren's a <b>week</b> <b>ago</b> <b>when</b> he [...] "called his shot," [...] pointing out a woman at the bar and saying she'd be the one he'd go home with that night. Thus began his attempt at a [...] "perfect week," [...] defined as having sex with seven women in seven days without a single rejection.|$|R

60|$|Important {{events were}} pending, {{and her father}} had not taken her into his confidence! It must be, then, {{something}} {{that he did not}} wish her to know. Only a <b>week</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>when</b> the I.W.W. menace had begun to be serious, she had asked him how he intended to meet it, and particularly how he would take sure measures to protect himself. Anderson had laughed down her fears, and Lenore, absorbed in her own tumult, had been easily satisfied. But now, with her curiosity there returned a two-fold dread.|$|R

I felt as if someone had struck me a terrible blow. I didn't say anything--I couldn't speak--but I don't know what I looked like. I'm so afraid my face betrayed me. Oh, I would die of shame if I thought he knew--or suspected." ...|$|R
