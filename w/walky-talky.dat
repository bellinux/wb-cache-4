5000|$|The bomb is {{believed}} to have been hidden in an aluminum camera case, and planted by an individual carrying a stolen Danish passport. According to witnesses, the bomber used the name Per Anker Hansen and claimed he was a Danish photographer. Afterwards, bombing survivors commented that they found it odd that [...] "Hansen" [...] had so zealouly guarded his [...] "camera equipment", wrapping the unwieldy aluminum box in plastic. [...] "Hansen" [...] {{is believed}} to have deposited the camera case containing the bomb underneath the table. News footage later showed the suspected bomber gesturing to his camera as if to indicate an equipment malfunction as a pretext to leave the room. The bomber is suspected to have detonated the bomb remotely using a <b>walky-talky</b> signal as a detonator. Seconds after [...] "Hansen" [...] left the room, an explosion ripped through the hut, leaving the injured and dying crying out in pain and calling for help in sudden darkness.|$|E
50|$|The {{staff are}} {{attacked}} by the children again, and Wade kills Dink by beating him {{to death with a}} fire extinguisher. Doug extracts and analyzes his brain, which has turned black and rotten due to the decomposition effects caused by the virus. He concludes that the virus is only dangerous to the prepubescent (not going through puberty), which is why Clint and Tamra didn't turn feral as they had passed that stage. The staff and uninfected children unite with the local school janitor, Mr. Hitachi (Peter Kwong), but Calvin passes out due to diabetic shock. The group opts to send Clint through the ventilation system to gather a chocolate bar for Calvin, Wade's truck keys, and their cellphones. Lucy joins Clint and the two confess their feelings to each other while trapped in the library. Wade also apologizes for his behavior over a <b>walky-talky.</b> Though they discover the cellphones to have been destroyed by Patriot, they manage to secure a chocolate bar and bring Calvin out of diabetic shock. The group then reunites after Clint knocks out several children with drugs causing them to overdose, and utilizing various tools in the school as weapons, battle the children on the playground to eventually make their escape; however, Mr. Hitachi and Wade are seemingly killed by the children.|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of time have changed human’s life style. Almost every activity and work {{are not free}} from modernization and automatization because many people think that working manually is slow, highly error, and inefficient, etc. Nevertheless, many works still use manual system, for example the registery of customer’s electrics invoice by PLN. So, practically there are many mistakes happened by KWh metre’ officer. Thus, customers will be unsatisfction with PLN’s services. This script discuss automatization of identify cutomer’s data, intake of invoice electrics data and also saving its data at database in PC. As identifying cutomer’s data use passive RFID, its data communications use <b>Walky-Talky,</b> as processor of main program use MKAT 89 S 8252 and MKAT 89 S 51, as appearance of instructions use LCD. Data base uses Microsoft Acces and the appearance at PC uses Visual Program Basic. When cutomer brings near RFID’s card to READER RFID, then cutomer’s data will appear on PC and system of transceiver will be directed ask system at KWH metre to deliver the usage’s expense of electrics. After process of transfer data is finished hence amount of cutomer’s electrics invoice and other information which have on file at database will emerge at PC. The aim of this appliance to develop former system which still use barcode at identifying cutomer’s data. This is expected the better process of intake data from / to KWH metre because do not write down electrics invoice by manual again. Equally, mistakes at process the registery of electrics invoice can be minimalized...|$|E
