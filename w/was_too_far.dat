Flooding inundated nearly 1,300 homes around Tokyo and high winds cut power to roughly 20,000 residences. Three homes were destroyed in a landslide on Kozushima.|$|E

5|$|Towards {{the end of}} fitting out, the ship's {{flagship}} facilities, {{including those}} on the bridge and in the admiral's cabins, were modified to satisfy Combined Fleet's desire to have the ship equipped as the primary flagship of the commander-in-chief, as her sister Yamato <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>far</b> along for such changes. These alterations, along with improvements in the secondary battery armour, pushed back completion and pre-handover testing of Musashi by two months, to August 1942.|$|E
5|$|Both vessels were {{involved}} in the operations off Lissa in July 1866, but neither took part in the Battle of Lissa on 20 July. Formidabile had been damaged by Austrian coastal fortifications the day before, and had withdrawn for repairs; Terribile was ready for action, but had been preparing to attack Lissa and <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>far</b> south to {{take an active role in}} the battle. Both ships saw minimal use in the 1870s and 1880s, until both were withdrawn from service for use as training ships. Formidabile and Terribile served in this capacity until 1903 and 1904, respectively, when they were sold and broken up for scrap.|$|E

5|$|Even {{five years}} before Texas was complete, the blast effects from end-on fire were {{considered}} prohibitive and en echelon mounting of main guns was abandoned in European navies. This made Texass armament arrangement obsolete. The then-new Board on Construction considered a thorough re-design which would have placed Texass main guns on the centerline, either in two single turrets or one twin turret, and the heavy redoubt eliminated. Construction by this time <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>far</b> advanced for such a plan, however, and Navy Secretary Benjamin Tracy limited the Board to detail improvements.|$|E
5|$|The castle was not greatly used; the Marquess rarely visited {{after its}} completion.

The restored castle initially received little interest from the architectural community, possibly because the total rebuilding of the castle ran counter to the increasingly popular late-Victorian philosophy of conserving older buildings and monuments.|$|E

Chauvel was again mentioned in despatches {{for his part in}} the defence of the Canal. His division was committed to No. 3 Section of the Suez Canal Defences, {{the northern part of the}} Canal, under Major General H. A. Lawrence. Arrangements were far from ideal. The mounted troops were parcelled out so that only two brigades of the Anzac Mounted Division remained under Chauvel's command. The 3rd Light Horse Brigade had been placed under No. 2 Section by General Sir Archibald Murray GHQ Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF).

5|$|Joan Young, who was {{the only}} {{first-hand}} witness, is challenged in both articles. She came forward in 2004, claiming {{that she had seen}} someone push something over the side of a boat on Coniston Water. This testimony is challenged, because so much time has passed and the fact that her husband saw nothing. However, he claims to have been reading his paper at the time. Also, {{it has been said that}} Young <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>far</b> away to identify the person in the boat, and that it couldn't have been Carol Park's body that was being dumped, as the Youngs were positioned so that the location Carol's body was found would have been visibly blocked by an island. The article even points out that Young described a boat that appeared to be a cruiser yacht. Despite the fact that Gordon did own a large yacht in 1997, in 1976 he owned only a 505 racing dinghy, which he sold later that year.|$|E

5|$|The Il-40 first flew on 7 March 1953, {{and flight}} tests {{revealed}} no serious shortcomings in the air. The operational CG <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>far</b> aft, {{but this was}} only a minor problem when landing, taking off and taxiing, especially when coupled with the rather short wheelbase. The biggest problem {{proved to be the}} guns and their effect on the engines. During the first aerial test of the cannons at the end of March 1953 the muzzle flash temporarily blinded the pilot and both engines flamed out. The pilot was able to restart the engines and returned safely, but Sergey Ilyushin immediately started an investigation into the cause of the engine problems. Ground tests with high-speed cameras revealed that none of the muzzle brakes or blast suppressors tested made any difference; the engines would hiccup even if only a single gun fired just five to ten rounds.|$|E
5|$|The {{first two}} vessels of the Principe di Carignano class were {{initially}} ordered as steam frigates by the Regia Marina Sarda (Royal Sardinian Navy) {{shortly before the}} unification of Italy.

A third ship, , <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>far</b> advanced in her construction to allow for conversion, and so she was completed as a wooden vessel. These ships had been designed by Inps. Eng. Felice Mattei. A fourth ship, Conte Verde, was built to a modified design created by Inps. Eng. Giuseppe De Luca. These ships came as part of a major naval expansion program that was designed to prepare a fleet of ironclads capable of defeating the Austrian Navy. Italy considered the Austrian Empire to be its main rival, since it controlled predominantly Italian areas, including Venice.|$|E

The idea of invading Japan and fighting its armies on its own soil was rejected as impractical, but the British planners did not expect that the Japanese would willingly fight a decisive naval battle against the odds. They were therefore drawn to the concept of a blockade. From personal experience they were aware of the impact it could have on an island nation {{at the heart of a}} maritime empire, and felt that economic pressure would suffice.|$|E
