5|$|Flashbacks {{throughout}} the episode show the attempts {{of a teenage}} Dexter (Devon Graye) to feel his heart pound. At {{the end of the}} episode, Debra turns on the television in Dexter's apartment and shows him the news: a team of scuba divers in Biscayne Bay has uncovered over 30 garbage bags, each containing parts of Dexter's mutilated victims. As he <b>watches,</b> <b>his</b> heart races.|$|E
5|$|In {{the scene}} when Homer, Bart and Lisa pick up Maggie from the daycare center, babies are perched {{all over the}} building, staring at the family and quietly sucking on pacifiers. This is a spoof of the final shot of Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds. Indeed, a cartoon-version of Hitchcock can be seen walking his dogs past the daycare, a {{reference}} to his own cameo appearance in the film. The episode also contains an allusion to the opera scene in Citizen Kane, in which Homer plays with a shredded playbill while he <b>watches</b> <b>his</b> wife in the musical.|$|E
5|$|The Bure family made {{precious}} watches for the Russian tsars from 1815 until 1917, and Bure {{was named}} after his great-grandfather, a watchmaker to Tsar Alexander III. As craftspersons to the imperial family, the Bures were granted noble status. After Bure sustained his first serious knee injury in 1995, he pursued the watchmaking business during his rehabilitation period {{in an attempt to}} revive the family business. Fifty replicas of the same <b>watches</b> <b>his</b> ancestors made for the Russian imperial family were made and sold at US$30,000 each. Bure presented three of the gold replicas to Russian President Boris Yeltsin, Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and Moscow mayor Yuriy Luzhkov.|$|E

5|$|The {{events of}} the game unfolds {{successively}} from the viewpoints of four different Warhead protagonists. The first one is Gene, {{a young man who}} becomes amnesic after the Arks accident. He is the son of professor Alvin, one of the builders of the Arks, who disappeared some time after the accident. While searching for his sister Aliz kidnapped by a strange creature, Gene is mutated into a Warhead and <b>watches</b> <b>his</b> arm turning into a weapon during a battle against some Otellos. He is assisted by a small floating companion named Pake; and is later joined by the Warhead Kilroy, who was an assistant to professor Alvin; and Meme, a mysterious but determined, optimistic young female Warhead.|$|E
5|$|The former Town Hall, {{adjoining}} the old marketplace, {{houses the}} Willis Museum (originally the Basingstoke Museum, until 1956). This was founded {{and directed by}} Alderman George W. Willis, a local clocksmith, who served as Mayor of Basingstoke in 1923-24. He established the museum in 1931 and with much public support was able to build it up into a major collection on local history, with a particularly extensive collection (largely made by him) of prehistoric implements and of antique clocks and <b>watches.</b> <b>His</b> association with the expanding museum continued for forty years. Its central location today is where, once upon a time, Jane Austen and her sister {{used to go to}} dances. Although ostensibly set in Hertford, Austen's novel Pride and Prejudice, written in 1797, is thought to have been based on her view of Basingstoke society two centuries ago.|$|E
5|$|The {{story begins}} in the pre-dawn hours as the young Nick Adams, his father, his uncle and their Indian guides row across a lake to a nearby Indian camp. Nick's father, a doctor, has been called out to deliver a baby {{for a woman who}} has been in labor for days. At the camp, they find the woman in a cabin lying on a bottom bunkbed; her husband lies above her with an injured foot. Nick's father is forced to perform a {{caesarian}} operation on the woman with a jack-knife because the baby is in the breech position; he asks Nick to assist by holding a basin. The woman screams throughout the operation, and when Nick's uncle tries to hold her down, she bites him. After the baby is delivered, Nick's father turns to the woman's husband on the top bunk and finds that he fatally slit his throat with a straight razor during the operation. Nick is sent out of the cabin, and his uncle leaves with two Natives, not to return. The story ends with only Nick and his father on the lake, rowing away from the camp. Nick asks his father questions about birth and death, and thinks to himself that he will never die, as he <b>watches</b> <b>his</b> father row.|$|E

25|$|Like his uncle, Gaston {{is known}} as a wealthy womanizer. The whole of Paris <b>watches</b> <b>his</b> every move, and Parisian high society shows {{unrestrained}} judgment towards his mistresses and him. Gaston's latest mistress attempts to run off with her ice skating instructor. As a response, he publicly humiliates her, resulting in her attempted suicide. After this ordeal, Gaston wishes to retreat to the country, but his uncle insists on him staying in Paris and attending more parties.|$|E
25|$|One famous Chick tract is This Was Your Life , a tract {{about a man}} who {{dies and}} is judged by God. The man had lived a good life, but claimed that he didn't need Christ. On Judgment Day, the man <b>watches</b> <b>his</b> life being {{revealed}} before Jesus Christ. The man is shown scenes of himself leering at women, telling dirty jokes, not listening to the pastor's message and committing other sins. God then sends the man to Hell in dramatic style.|$|E

It looks like we've come to the end of the way". [...] "Yesterday's Wine" [...] finds the character drinking in a bar, talking to the regulars about his life, and reflecting on aging.

500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the episode, Abe <b>watches</b> <b>his</b> idol Ben Matlock talk to a crowd of excited seniors at the Grand Opening of the Center for Geriatric Medicine. Ben Matlock is a character from the NBC/ABC television series Matlock, portrayed by Andy Griffith and created by Dean Hargrove. The crowd cheer for Matlock by singing a slightly changed version of the [...] "We Love You, Conrad" [...] song from stage musical Bye Bye Birdie. Homer dances on giant piano keys recessed in the floor of the toy store, spoofing a scene from the 1988 film Big. Lisa wants Lisa Lionheart to have [...] "the wisdom of Gertrude Stein, the wit of Cathy Guisewite, the tenacity of Nina Totenberg, the common sense of Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and the down-to-earth good looks of Eleanor Roosevelt." ...|$|E
500|$|Peter, not cowardly {{enough to}} fear an old woman, nor superstitious {{enough to believe}} in her power, {{threaten}}s the old fairy, trying to chase her away. Unfortunately, she does indeed have fairy powers and casts a spell that forces Peter to threaten anyone he encounters or, if alone, to fight imaginary enemies. Peter flees before he can get himself into trouble by threatening anyone bigger than him, calling out challenges as he goes. Sergeant Klooque approaches the old woman next and tries to use his military charm to win her over. It turns out that she hates soldiers, and she strikes out with her stick, making him duck and dodge. She then casts a spell to make his cringing, dodging and ducking permanent, intending that he lose his reputation and be branded a coward. Pipette arrives and <b>watches</b> <b>his</b> behaviour in astonishment. [...] "He's showing you how he fought the enemy at Johannesburg," [...] exclaims the old lady, but he replies [...] "No, my dear!" [...] I'm showing you how the enemy fought us. This {{is the way they}} retreated". He leaves, cringing and pleading for imaginary attackers to stop as he goes.|$|E
2500|$|Sonnet 128 is {{comparable}} to the sonnet in Romeo and Juliet in which Romeo pleads for a first kiss. Like that pilgrim/saint tête-à-tête, this sonnet is set in a public musical celebration. Shakespeare <b>watches</b> <b>his</b> dark lady play the keyboard virginal (or Bassano built clavichord), captivated by her back swaying with the melody. Like Romeo, he longs for a kiss, but in this sonnet he envies the jacks (wooden keys) that the lady's playing fingers [...] "tickle" [...] while trilling the notes. Perhaps he also envies the other men (Jacks) standing around the lady. Surely, this is an amusing scene to Shakespeare because he secretly is having an affair with the dark lady. He decides not to envy those keys—although he would like to be tickled as they are—but hopes instead to receive a kiss on his lips. Fred Blick points out that this plea for a [...] "kiss", leaving the fingers to the jacks, is a compromise, just as the tuning of the virginal or other keyboard instrument is, in musical temperament, a compromise.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{commonly}} recurring animal motif is that {{of lambs}} and wolves. This is introduced in the opening scene when Margaret chastises Henry for yielding to York's demands and relinquishing the throne to the House of York; [...] "Such safety finds/The trembling lamb environ'd with wolves" [...] (ll.243–244). Later, as York <b>watches</b> <b>his</b> army lose the Battle of Wakefield, he laments [...] "All my followers to the eager foe/Turn back and fly, like ships before the wind/Or lambs pursued by hunger-starv'd wolves" [...] (1.4.3–5). After being captured by the Lancastrians, York then refer to Margaret as [...] "She-wolf of France, but worse than wolves of France" [...] (1.4.111). During the Battle of Tewkesbury, as Richard and Clifford fight, they are interrupted by Warwick, and Clifford flees. Warwick attempts to pursue him, but Richard says, [...] "Nay Warwick, single out some other chase,/For myself will hunt this wolf to death" [...] (2.4.13). Prior to the battle of Barnet, Margaret rallies her troops by claiming Edward has destroyed the country and usurped the throne, then pointing out [...] "And yonder is the wolf that makes this spoil" [...] (5.4.80). Finally, upon being left alone with Richard in the Tower, Henry proclaims [...] "So flies the reckless shepherd from the wolf,/So first the harmless sheep doth yield his fleece,/And next his throat, unto the butcher's knife" [...] (5.6.7–9).|$|E
2500|$|Hitchcock's second {{piece was}} [...] "The Woman's Part" [...] (1919), which {{involves}} the conflicted emotions that a husband feels as he <b>watches</b> <b>his</b> actress wife perform onstage. [...] "Sordid" [...] (1920) surrounds {{an attempt to}} buy a sword from an antiques dealer, with another twist ending. The short story [...] "And There Was No Rainbow" [...] (1920) is Hitchcock's first brush with possibly censurable material. A young man goes out looking for a brothel, only to stumble into the house of his best friend's girl. [...] "What's Who?" [...] (1920) at first glance {{seems to be a}} precursor to Abbott and Costello's [...] "Who's on First?" [...] routine, as it is a short dialogue piece resembling antic dialogue from a music hall skit. It captures the confusion that occurs when a group of actors decide to put together a sketch in which they will impersonate themselves. In the story’s forty sentences, confusion regarding the questions “Who’s me?” and [...] "Who’s you?” rise to comic emotional heights. [...] "The History of Pea Eating" [...] (1920) is a satirical disquisition on the various attempts that people have made over the centuries to eat peas successfully. His final piece, [...] "Fedora" [...] (1921), is his shortest and most enigmatic contribution. It also gives a strikingly accurate description of his future wife Alma Reville, whom he had not yet met.|$|E
2500|$|Colbert's {{candidacy}} had met mixed reviews, and {{the growing}} realization that Colbert may be serious about his candidacy raised the ire of the American political and media establishment. When the Public Opinion Strategies poll put Colbert ahead of Bill Richardson, Richardson's spokesman responded: [...] "This is a serious election with serious consequences {{and we are not}} going to comment on this ridiculous exercise". Katon Dawson, South Carolina's Republican party chairman believed Colbert would be better off using the $35,000 entrance fee to [...] "buy a sports car and get a girlfriend". The high polling gave way to what New York called a [...] "Stephen Colbert Backlash", as bloggers criticized Colbert for verging into legitimate political territory, asserting that he had [...] "crossed the line from lampooning the process to actively messing it up." [...] Republican candidate John McCain gave a more positive view, stating that he hoped Colbert would join the Republican party's debates. [...] "He can make them livelier and he can reach a wider audience than that narrow little sliver that <b>watches</b> <b>his</b> show." [...] In conversation with ABC News, Fox News commentator and template for Stephen Colbert's The Colbert Report persona Bill O'Reilly dismissed Colbert's run as a publicity stunt for his book, I Am America. O'Reilly also called Colbert out for not going on the O'Reilly Factor to discuss the book: [...] "He knows the book is dumb, so he's not going to come in. Instead, he runs for president." [...] Sam Brownback's October 19, 2007 withdrawal from the race was humorously attributed by some to competition from the comedian, but others took Colbert's challenge to Brownback's run more seriously. As one reporter for The Atlantic wrote, [...] "Sam Brownback may cite other reasons for dropping out today, but Colbert’s plan to run in South Carolina wouldn’t have made his job there any easier." ...|$|E
