However, Fowler <b>was</b> <b>quick</b> to dismiss talk of a quick return to England.

5|$|Staszic was {{remembered by}} his contemporaries as a loner {{and not a}} person who <b>was</b> <b>quick</b> to make friends. He has been {{described}} as somewhat miserly; despite acquiring significant wealth, he was said to wear old clothes and use an old carriage. He was nonetheless widely respected by his contemporaries. He was seen as stern but honest, and had a tendency to speak in a fashion that some found amusing.|$|E
5|$|Taft upset some {{progressives}} {{by choosing}} Hitchcock as Chairman of the Republican National Committee (RNC), placing him {{in charge of}} the presidential campaign. Hitchcock <b>was</b> <b>quick</b> to bring in men closely allied with big business. Taft took an August vacation in Hot Springs, Virginia, where he irritated political advisors by spending more time on golf than strategy.

Cyberlink, which sells the PowerDVD player software, <b>was</b> <b>quick</b> to deny that its software {{could be used to}} obtain keys.

This took place even before the Charter was ratified, but was done in accordance with a draft of the Charter from March 28, 1628.|$|E

5|$|Crazy Kong {{was officially}} {{licensed}} from Nintendo and manufactured by Falcon for some non-US markets.

Bootleg copies of Donkey Kong also appeared in both North America and France under the Crazy Kong, Konkey Kong or Donkey King names. The 1982 Logger arcade game from Century Electronics is a direct clone of Donkey Kong, with a large bird standing in for the ape and rolling logs instead of barrels.|$|E

5|$|For his {{services}} during the war, he was welcomed back to America {{with a large}} parade down Broadway in New York, along with other honors. Schwarzkopf led a highly publicized homecoming parade in Washington, D.C., on June 8, 1991, where he was greeted by Bush amid thousands of onlookers. His accomplishments were praised in a manner much differently from commanders who returned from the Vietnam and Korean Wars. He became an instant national celebrity {{and the source of}} great curiosity by the general public. He <b>was</b> <b>quick</b> to award praise and medals to the troops, part of what he saw as restoring pride in the U.S. armed forces after the Vietnam War.|$|E
5|$|Harrison {{left the}} {{territory}} for business in Kentucky {{shortly after the}} meeting with Tecumseh, and secretary John Gibson was acting governor. Gibson, who had lived among the Miami tribe for many years, <b>was</b> <b>quick</b> to learn of Tecumseh's plans for war; he immediately called out the territory's militia and sent emergency letters calling {{for the return of}} Harrison. By mid-September, most of the militia regiments had formed. By then, Harrison had returned, accompanied by a small force of army regulars, and had taken command of the militia. Harrison had already communicated with his superiors in Washington, D.C., and he had been authorized to march against the confederacy in a show of force, in the hopes that its members would accept peace.|$|E
5|$|He was {{a member}} of the Washington Light Infantry, a local Washington, D.C. militia, and played in many of their amateur {{baseball}} games throughout his life. When not playing, he tended to his bar. Noted for being a genial, friendly individual, he <b>was</b> <b>quick</b> to make friends, and was a fan-favorite in his hometown of Washington, D.C. Kinslow was a heavy drinker however, which caused him to miss games and team movements on occasion. Late into his career, these alcohol issues were much less tolerated, eventually hastening his exit from the game. He died at the age of 35, after a year-long battle with tuberculosis.|$|E

5|$|Microbes {{feature in}} many highly dramatized films. Hollywood <b>was</b> <b>quick</b> {{to exploit the}} {{possibilities}} of deadly disease, mass infection and drastic government reaction, starting as early as 1922 with Nosferatu, in which a Dracula-like figure, Count Orlok, sleeps in unhallowed ground contaminated with the Black Death, which he brings with him wherever he goes. Another classic film, Ingmar Bergman's 1957 The Seventh Seal, deals with the plague theme very differently, with the grim reaper directly represented by an actor in a hood. More recently, the 1971 The Andromeda Strain, based on a novel by Michael Crichton, portrayed an extraterrestrial microbe contaminating the Earth.|$|E
5|$|Rapid {{economic}} growth marked McKinley's presidency. He promoted the 1897 Dingley Tariff to protect manufacturers and factory workers from foreign competition, and in 1900, he secured {{the passage of}} the Gold Standard Act. McKinley hoped to persuade Spain to grant independence to rebellious Cuba without conflict, but when negotiation failed, he led the nation into the Spanishâ€“American War of 1898; the U.S. victory <b>was</b> <b>quick</b> and decisive. As part of the peace settlement, Spain turned over to the United States its main overseas colonies of Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines; Cuba was promised independence, but at that time remained {{under the control of the}} U.S. Army. The United States annexed the independent Republic of Hawaii in 1898 and it became a U.S. territory.|$|E
5|$|Security, {{services}} and logistics {{at the reception}} centres were provided by the military component of UNTAG, {{and a number of}} secondary reception centres were also established. The movement of returnees through the centres <b>was</b> <b>quick,</b> and the repatriation programme was very successful; a UN official report stated that the psychological impact of the return of so many exiles was perceptible throughout the country. There were some problems reported in the north, where ex-Koevoet elements searched villages for SWAPO returnees; however, the UN reported that this was kept under constant surveillance by UNTAG's police monitors. By the end of the process, 42,736 Namibians had been returned from exile.|$|E
