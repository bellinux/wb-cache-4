5|$|In his films, {{the common}} man exaggerations continued. Much {{of his time in}} the films was spent {{spoofing}} himself, <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> affected nervousness of the treasurer in The Treasurer's Report or the discomfort in explaining The Sex Life of the Polyp to a women's club. The longer, plot-driven shorts, such as Lesson Number One, Furnace Trouble, and Stewed, Fried and Boiled, likewise show a Benchley character overmatched by seemingly mundane tasks. Even the more stereotypical characters held these qualities, such as the incapable sportscaster Benchley played in The Sport Parade.|$|E
5|$|The white Schnauzer {{is one of}} four color {{varieties}} of the Miniature Schnauzer currently recognized by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale. However, they are not accepted for conformation showing by the American Kennel Club and Canadian Kennel Club. The controversy rests on the disputed origins of the white variation: whether it was contained within the genes of the originally recognized breed, or <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> result of subsequent modifications. Since the other two Schnauzer types have never been available in a white variation, and the original German standard never included white as an acceptable color, the AMSC chooses not to recognize white.|$|E
5|$|By October 2007, Vildanden was {{in severe}} {{financial}} distress. An agreement {{was made with}} the municipal council, where the latter gave a credit loan to the airline. The route to Molde had given large deficits, and the company was forced to close it down. NOK2.3 million, equal to the airlines debt to the airport, was granted to the municipal-owned airport operator, and the company allowed to make an agreement where half the debt was deleted, {{and the other half}} made interest and principal-free for two years. At the same time, the management of Vildanden had to raise new capital equal to at least half the companies accounts payable, which was NOK8 million. The case raised local debate about <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> municipality's job to subsidize the airport and the airline. The Federation of Norwegian Aviation Industries announced that they would consider reporting the subsidies to the EFTA Surveillance Authority (ESA) for violation of the European Community competition law.|$|E

5|$|On November17, a typhoon {{originated}} west of Guam, which {{moved slowly}} to the west or west-northwest. It approached the eastern Philippines but remained east of the island group. On November22, the typhoon curved to the northeast, remaining south of Japan. Another storm appeared on November22 to the northwest of the previous storm, just to the northeast of Samar. It moved northwestward at first, but recurved to the northeast away from Luzon, and was last reported on November24. On that same day, a typhoon was observed southeast of Guam and proceeded westward. The storm passed near Yap on November25 and later turned to the north. Two days later, a passing United States Navy ship encountered the storm. On November29, a storm passed near the Bonin Islands, but it was uncertain <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> first typhoon of the month near the Philippines or the storm that affected Yap.

Critics observed that the use high frame rate and motion blur helped convey an incredible sense of speed. Other aspects such particle effects, reflections, and real-time deformation drew praise as well. Critics expressed approval over the sound design of the cars and collisions. However opinions of the licensed soundtrack and DJ were less favourable. Some writers found the DJ's enthusiastic dialogue to be annoying and had mixed opinions on the songs included in the soundtrack, but were thankful for the available audio customisation options.|$|E

25|$|There is some {{confusion}} in the primary sources over what was the target in Dresden, <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> marshalling yards near the centre or centre of the built up area. The report by the 1st Bombardment Division's commander to his commander states that the targeting sequence was {{the centre of the}} built up area in Dresden if the weather was clear. If clouds obscured Dresden but Chemnitz was clear, Chemnitz was the target. If both were obscured, they would bomb the centre of Dresden using H2X radar. The mix of bombs for the Dresden raid was about 40% incendiaries—much closer to the RAF city busting mix than that the USAAF usually used in precision bombardment. Taylor compares this 40% mix with the raid on Berlin on 3 February, where the ratio was 10% incendiaries. This was a common mix when the USAAF anticipated cloudy conditions over the target.|$|E
25|$|The Nuu-chah-nulth, {{indigenous}} to Nootka Sound, observed {{but did not}} understand the disputes between the Spanish and British. On July 13, one of the Nuu-chah-nulth leaders, Callicum, the son of Maquinna, went to meet with Martínez, who was on board the newly captured Princess Royal. Callicum's attitude and angry calls alarmed the Spanish and somehow Callicum ended up shot dead. Sources differ over exactly how this happened. Some say that Martínez fired a warning shot and a nearby Spanish sailor, thinking Martínez meant to kill and missed, fired as well and killed Callicum. Another source says that Martínez aimed to hit Callicum but his musket misfired and another sailor fired his musket and killed Callicum. Sources also differ over what Callicum was angry about, <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> seizing of ships, or something else. In any case the event caused a rift between the Spanish and the Nuu-chah-nulth. Maquinna, in fear of his life, fled to Clayoquot Sound and moved with his people from Yuquot to Aoxsha.|$|E
