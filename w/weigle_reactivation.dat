40|$|Strains of the {{filamentous}} cyanobacteria Anabaena spp. {{were capable}} of very efficient photoreactivation of UV irradiation-induced damage to DNA. Cells were resistant to several hundred joules of UV irradiation per square meter under conditions that allowed photoreactivation, and they also photoreactivated UV-damaged cyanophage efficiently. Reactivation of UV-irradiated cyanophage (<b>Weigle</b> <b>reactivation)</b> also occurred; UV irradiation of host cells greatly enhanced the plaque-forming ability of irradiated phage under nonphotoreactivating conditions. Postirradiation incubation of the host cells under conditions that allowed photoreactivation abolished {{the ability of the}} cells to perform <b>Weigle</b> <b>reactivation</b> of cyanophage N- 1. Mitomycin C also induced <b>Weigle</b> <b>reactivation</b> of cyanophage N- 1, but nalidixic acid did not. The inducible repair system (defined as the ability to perform <b>Weigle</b> <b>reactivation</b> of cyanophages) was relatively slow and inefficient compared with photoreactivation...|$|E
40|$|Agents that {{interfere}} with DNA replication in Escherichia coli induce physiological adaptations that increase the probability of survival after DNA damage {{and the frequency of}} mutants among the survivors (the SOS response). Such agents also increase the survival rate and mutation frequency of irradiated bacteriophage after infection of treated bacteria, a phenomenon known as <b>Weigle</b> <b>reactivation.</b> In UV-irradiated single-stranded DNA phage, <b>Weigle</b> <b>reactivation</b> is thought to occur via induced, error-prone replication through template lesions (translesion synthesis [P. Caillet-Fauquet, M: Defais, and M. Radman, J. Mol. Biol. 117 : 95 - 112, 1977]). <b>Weigle</b> <b>reactivation</b> occurs with higher efficiency in double-stranded DNA phages such as lambda, and we therefore asked if another process, recombination between partially replicated daughter molecules, {{plays a major role in}} this case. To distinguish between translesion synthesis and recombinational repair, we studied the early replication of UV-irradiated bacteriophage lambda in SOS-induced and uninduced bacteria. To avoid complications arising from excision of UV lesions, we used bacterial uvrA mutants, in which such excision does not occur. Our evidence suggests that translesion synthesis is the primary component of <b>Weigle</b> <b>reactivation</b> of lambda phage in the absence of excision repair. The greater efficiency in <b>Weigle</b> <b>reactivation</b> of double-stranded DNA phage could thus be attributed to some inducible excision repair unable to occur on single-stranded DNA. In addition, after irradiation, lambda phage replication seems to switch prematurely from the theta mode to the rolling circle mode...|$|E
40|$|Repair of UV-irradiated {{bacteriophage}} in Escherichia coli by <b>Weigle</b> <b>reactivation</b> requires functional recA+ and umuD+C+ genes. When {{the cells}} were UV irradiated, the groE heat shock gene products, GroES and GroEL, were needed for at least 50 % of the <b>Weigle</b> <b>reactivation</b> of the single-stranded DNA phage S 13. Because of repression of the umuDC and recA genes, <b>Weigle</b> <b>reactivation</b> is normally blocked by the lexA 3 (Ind-) mutation (which creates a noncleavable LexA protein), but it was restored {{by a combination of}} a high-copy-number umuD+C+ plasmid and a UV dose that increases groE expression. Maximal reactivation was achieved by elevated amounts of the Umu proteins, which was accomplished in part by UV-induced expression of the groE genes. By increasing the number of copies of the umuD+C+ genes, up to 50 % of the normal amount of reactivation of S 13 was achieved in an unirradiated recA+ host...|$|E
40|$|DNA repair-proficient and-deficient {{strains of}} Vibrio cholerae {{were used to}} examine host cell reactivation, <b>Weigle</b> <b>reactivation</b> and {{photoreactivation}} f u. v. -irradiated cholera bacteriophages. U. v. light-induced DNA damage in phages of different morphological nd serological groups could be efficiently photoreactivated. Host cell reactivation of irradiated phages of different groups was different on the same indicator host. Phage ~b 149 was the most sensitive, and ~b 138 the most resistant to u. v. irradiation. While q ~ 138 showed appreciable host cell reactivation, this was minimal for qH 49.

40|$|As ordinarily measured, the SOS {{repair of}} damaged DNA by <b>Weigle</b> <b>reactivation</b> {{appears to be}} more {{effective}} for double-stranded (ds) than for single-stranded (ss) DNA bacteriophages. A complicating feature, which is usually not considered, is the possibility of DNA-protein cross-linking of ssDNA to the viral capsid, which would conceivably be an extraneous source of nonreactivable lesions. This idea is supported in studies of phage S 13 by the observation that photoreactivation more than doubles when naked ssDNA is substituted for encapsidated ssDNA as the UV target. The same effect was observed for Weigle reactivation; there was little, if any, difference in the reactivation of ssDNA and dsDNA when naked DNA was irradiated. Moreover, in a uvrA mutant, ssDNA actually had the advantage; <b>Weigle</b> <b>reactivation</b> was then more than twice as effective for ssDNA as for dsDNA. It is also shown that when a suitable measure of Weigle mutagenesis is used, there is no convincing evidence that dsDNA is mutagenized more effectively than ssDNA...|$|E
40|$|The SOS-like {{system of}} Bacillus subtilis {{consists}} of several coordinately induced phenomena (e. g., cellular filamentation, prophage induction, and <b>Weigle</b> <b>reactivation</b> of UV-damaged bacteriophage) which are expressed after cellular insult such as DNA damage or inhibition of DNA replication. Mutagenesis of the bacterial chromosome {{and the development}} or maintenance of competence also appear {{to be involved in}} the SOS-like response in this bacterium. The genetic characterization of the SOS-like system has involved an analysis of (i) the effects of various DNA repair mutations on the expression of inducible phenomena and (ii) the tsi- 23 mutation, which renders host strains thermally inducible for each of the SOS-like functions. Bacterial filamentation was unaffected by any of the DNA repair mutations studied. In contrast, the induction of prophage after thermal or UV pretreatment was abolished in strains carrying the recE 4, recA 1, recB 2, or recG 13 mutation. The <b>Weigle</b> <b>reactivation</b> of UV-damaged bacteriophage was also inhibited by the recE 4, recA 1, recB 2, or recG 13 mutation, whereas levels of <b>Weigle</b> <b>reactivation</b> were lower in strains which carried the uvrA 42, polA 5, or rec- 961 mutation than in the DNA repair-proficient strain. Strains which carried the recE 4 mutation were incapable of chromosomal DNA-mediated transformation, and the frequency of this event was decreased in strains carrying the recA 1, recB 2, or tsi- 23 mutation. Plasmid DNA transformation efficiency was decreased only in strains carrying the tsi- 23 mutation in addition to the recE 4, recA 1, or recB 2 mutation. The results indicate that the SOS-like system of B. subtilis is regulated at different levels by two or more gene products. In this report, the current data regarding the genetic regulation of inducible phenomena are summarized, and a model is proposed to explain the mechanism of SOS-like induction in B. subtilis...|$|E
40|$|UNL- 1, a lytic {{bacteriophage}} of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated at the University of Nebraska, {{possesses a}} novel DNA repair phenotype. Bacteriophage DNA repair is quantified by <b>Weigle</b> <b>reactivation,</b> an experimental method in which UV induced bacterial host cells {{are infected with}} UV-C irradiated virus and plaque forming units enumerated. Previously, <b>Weigle</b> <b>reactivation</b> has only been observed in P. aeruginosa when host cells containing UV resistance plasmid R- 2 and a functional rec A gene are treated with UV-C radiation before bacteriophage infection. When UNL- 1 is damaged with UV-C radiation to 1 % infectivity, {{it is capable of}} over 10 -fold reactivation when infecting P. aeruginosa host cells that have been previously exposed to UV-A radiation. However, the virus does not reactivate if P. aeruginosa is instead exposed to UV-C radiation. The reactivation is also not dependent upon a functional rec A gene or a UVR plasmid, as shown previously, supporting the hypothesis that this is a new DNA repair phenotype. UNL- 1 <b>Weigle</b> <b>reactivation</b> has also been shown to be synergistic to photoreactivation, so when incubating the pour plates in the fight, a seventy-fold reactivation results. The gene or genes responsible have not yet been identified, but the activity seems to be dependent upon host excision repair and at least partially upon the rec 2 gene, which plays a role in rec A regulation. Although the exact nature of this repair is still unknown, this virus has been shown to reactivate if the host is first exposed to sunlight. It also shows some evidence of providing UV resistance to host cells when the bacteriophage is pseudolysogenic or in a semi-stable interaction with the cell. These interactions result in the production of brown pigment in 1 – 10 % of the pseudolysogens. The phenotype changes in pseudolysogens containing UNL- 1 could be important in understanding the survivability of some viruses in the environment and the interaction of bacteriophage with their host cells. ...|$|E

The amount of reactivation was considerably increased when the treated cells were incubated in growth medium before infection. The presence of chloramphenicol during this incubation abolished the reactivation. No mutation of this phage accompanied the reactivation. When cells were treated {{so as to}} produce a maximal reactivation of phage, neither reactivation or mutation of cells {{was observed}}. It is concluded that H. influenzae has an inducible repair system that is not accompanied by mutation...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} examine the {{possible}} role of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase II in SOS-induced translesion bypass, <b>Weigle</b> <b>reactivation</b> and mutation induction were measured with single-stranded phi X 174 transfecting DNA containing individual lesions.

Furthermore, DNA polymerase II did not affect bypass of abasic sites when either survival or mutagenesis was the endpoint.

40|$|The {{inducible}} (<b>Weigle)</b> <b>reactivation</b> of UV-irradiated bacteriophage P 22 {{has been}} examined on strains of Salmonella typhimurium {{with and without}} the mutagenesis-enhancing plasmid pKM 101. A large inducible reactivation was observed in the plasmid-containing strain, but only a small response was observed in the strain lacking the plasmid. An increased frequency of clear-plaque mutants was detected among the survivors. The efficiencies of the plasmid-mediated and cellular repair processes have been determined. The kinetics of induction of the phage reactivation have been investigated. The relationship of the observed results to the inducible reactivation of UV-irradiated lambda in Escherichia coli and to error-prone repair is discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{ultraviolet}} (UV) radiation in the wavelength region 230 nm to 302 nm {{on the ability}} of an irradiated mammalian cell to reactivate UV-irradiated mammalian virus was tests. An action spectrum for radiation enhanced reactivation (RER) Is presented. The shape of the action spectrum points to a combined nucleic acid protein target for UV radiation effects on this cellular parameter. An analysis of the results of others involving the biochemical and photobiological events involved in the RER does not allow the identification of the macromolecule which is the major contributor to this effect. Studies involving an analogous phenomenon in bacteria (<b>Weigle</b> <b>reactivation)</b> imply that RER and WR may involve similar mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|The uvrD 252 {{mutation}} {{leads to}} increased UV sensitivity, diminished dimer excision and host cell reactivation capacity, {{and an increase}} in the average patch size after repair replication. A recA 56 uvrD 252 double mutant was far more resistant to UV than was a recA 56 uvrB 5 double mutant. Its host cell reactivation capacity was identical to that of uvrD 252 single mutant and was far greater than that of the uvrB 5 single mutant. The strain showed no <b>Weigle</b> <b>reactivation.</b> From these results, we concluded that the double mutant has no inducible DNA repair (including long-patch excision repair) but retains dimer excision capabilities comparable to the uvrD 252 single mutant. It appears, therefore, that the long patches detected in the uvrD mutant were not identical to the recA-dependent patches seen in wild-type cells...|$|E
40|$|Escherichia coli BS- 12 uvrA lon is hypersensitive to {{ultraviolet}} light. On {{minimal agar}} plates at densities {{in excess of}} about 10 (7) bacteria per plate, as few as one or two photoreversible pyrimidine dimers in the entire genome are sufficient to cause inhibition of cell division. Most of the resulting filaments are unable to divide or form a viable colony. Inhibition of cell division {{appears to be a}} rapid consequence of replication of deoxyribonucleic acid containing a pyrimidine dimer. Photoreversibility of the inhibition of cell division persists indefinitely, indicating that the continued presence of the pyrimidine dimers (or the continued generation of daughter strand gaps) is necessary to maintain the division-inhibited state. In view of the kinetics for the production of filamentation by ultraviolet light and the extremely low average inducing fluence (0. 03 J/m 2), it is concluded that the initiating signal {{is not the same as}} that causing other inducible phenomena such as prophage induction or <b>Weigle</b> <b>reactivation...</b>|$|E
40|$|A recombination-deficient (Rec -) {{strain of}} Caulobacter crescentus has been {{isolated}} from {{a collection of}} mutants sensitive to ultraviolet irradiation. The Rec - mutant fails to give recombinants following ϕCr 30 -mediated generalized transduction or following RP 4 -mediated conjugation. The recombination frequency in the Rec - strain is at least 5000 -fold lower than in the wild type strains. The Rec - mutant is indistinguishable from wild type in terms of morphology, growth rate, viability, and phage sensitivities, differing only in properties known {{to be associated with}} recA -type mutations in other organisms: recombination frequency, ultraviolet sensitivity, and <b>Weigle</b> <b>reactivation.</b> The map location of the rec- 526 allele has not been identified, but rec- 526 can be cotransferred with the fla- 169 mutation by RP 4 -mediated conjugation at low frequency.

The Rec - mutant resembles recA strains of other organisms and provides a healthy strain severely deficient in recombination for use in complementation and cloning studies involving C. crescentus. ...|$|E
40|$|Bacteriophage Mu dX(Ap lac) {{was used}} to isolate a {{mutation}} in an Escherichia coli lexA(Def) strain representing a previously undescribed gene (dinY) which {{does not seem to}} be under the direct control of LexA. The insertion created a dinY::lacZ fusion in which beta-galactosidase expression required a DNA-damaging treatment (UV irradiation or mitomycin) and activable RecA protein. This strain showed a decreased <b>Weigle</b> <b>reactivation</b> of bacteriophage lambda. However, it was fully inducible for UV mutagenesis. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis analysis identified two spots absent in the mutant which were both UV inducible only in the presence of activated RecA protein (RecA*). This finding suggests that the dinY::lacZ fusion lies in a gene either that is under the direct control of activated RecA or whose product undergoes RecA*-dependent posttranscriptional/posttranslational modification(s). The dinY gene may also control the expression of some other gene(s) and/or lie in an operon.

40|$|The {{product of}} the umuC gene is {{required}} for UV and chemical mutagenesis in Escherichia coli. By {{the use of the}} Mud(Ap, lac) bacteriophage, we have obtained an operon fusion of the lac structural genes to the promoter/regulatory region of the umuC gene. The strain containing the umuC::Mud(Ap, lac) fusion was identified {{on the basis of its}} UV nonmutability. Strains containing this putative null allele of umuC were (i) nonmutable by UV and other agents, (ii) slightly UV sensitive, and (iii) deficient in their ability to carry out <b>Weigle</b> <b>reactivation</b> of UV-irradiation bacteriophage lambda. The UV nonmutability of the strain could be suppressed by a derivative of the mutagenesis-enhancing plasmid pKM 101. beta-Galactosidase synthesis in umuC::Mud(Ap, lac) fusion strains was inducible by UV and other DNA-damaging agents. Genetic analysis of the regulation of beta-galactosidase in umuC::Mud(Ap, lac) strains suggests that the lexA protein is the direct repressor of the umuC gene and that a function of the recA protein, probably its protease activity, is required for the removal of the lexA repressor at the time of umuC induction...|$|E
40|$|A {{screening}} procedure {{was developed for}} identifying mutants of the plasmid pKM 101 no longer capable of enhancing mutagenesis. The test {{was based on the}} large pKM 101 -mediated {{increase in the number of}} Gal+ papillae observed on colonies of Salmonella typhimurium gal mutants plated on tetrazolium-galactose plates in the presence of a mutagen. The pKM 101 mutant plasmids transferred normally, were stably maintained in cells, caused normal levels of ampicillin resistance, and still imparted sensitivity to phage Ike to their hosts. However, the pKM 101 mutants had lost the ability to (i) enhance the reversion of both point and frameshift mutations, (ii) protect the cells against killing by UV irradiation, (iii) increase the spontaneous reversion rates of point mutations, (iv) enhance plasmid-mediated reactivation of UV-irradiated phage P 22, (v) enhance <b>Weigle</b> <b>reactivation.</b> One pKM 101 mutant with different properties from the others was identified by its increased spontaneous mutator effect. It is suggested that pKM 101 amplifies the activity of the inducible error-prone repair systems in bacteria and that this is the function of pKM 101 in the Ames Salmonella tester strains used for detection of carcinogens as mutagens...|$|E
40|$|Near-UV (NUV) (300 to 400 nm) and far-UV (FUV) (254 nm) {{radiations}} damage bacteriophage {{by different}} mechanisms. Host cell reactivation, <b>Weigle</b> <b>reactivation,</b> and multiplicity reactivation were observed upon FUV, but not upon NUV irradiation. Also, {{the number of}} his+ recombinants increased with P 22 bacteriophage transduction in Salmonella typhimurium after FUV, but not after NUV irradiation. This loss of reactivation and recombination after NUV irradiation was not necessarily due to host incapability to repair phage damage. Instead, the phage genome failed to enter the host cell after NUV irradiation. In the case of NUV-irradiated T 7 phage, this was determined by genetic crosses with amber mutants, which demonstrated that either "all" or "none" of a T 7 genome entered the Escherichia coli cell after NUV treatment. Further studies with radioactively labeled phage indicated that irradiated phage failed to adsorb to host cells. This damage by NUV was compared with the protein-DNA cross-link observed previously, when phage particles were irradiated with NUV {{in the presence of}} H 2 O 2. H 2 O 2 (in nonlethal concentration) acts synergistically with NUV so that equivalent phage inactivation is achieved by much lower irradiation doses...|$|E
40|$|Haemophilus influenzae, {{normally}} not mutable by UV, became UV mutable with a {{recombinant plasmid}} insertion. A 7. 8 -kilobase-pair (kbp) fragment of the plasmid pKM 101 containing the mucA and mucB genes was ligated {{to the shuttle}} vector pDM 2, and a Rec- strain of H. influenzae was transformed with the ligated mixture. All of the transformants, unlike the parent Rec- strain, were resistant to UV, could carry out postreplication repair and <b>Weigle</b> <b>reactivation,</b> showed greatly increased spontaneous mutation, and contained a plasmid carrying an insert of only 1. 2 rather than 7. 8 kbp. This plasmid in a umuC mutant strain of Escherichia coli complemented a pKM 101 derivative lacking mucA function but with an intact mucB gene, {{although there was no}} complementation with a mucA+ mucB- plasmid, suggesting that the newly constructed plasmid coded for the mucA protein; this is in accord with the restriction analysis and hybridization between the plasmid and a probe containing all of the mucA gene but {{only a small fraction of}} mucB. When one of the H. influenzae Rec- transformants lost the plasmid, the resistance to UV was retained but the high spontaneous mutation and UV mutability were not. The fact that there was hybridization between the chromosome of the "cured" strain and a probe containing both muc genes but none when almost no mucB was present suggested that at least part of the mucB gene had been integrated into the Rec- chromosome. Five different postreplication repair-proficient strains became UV mutable and had high spontaneous mutation rates caused by the putative mucA plasmid, indicating that these strains already possessed a chromosomal equivalent of the mucB gene...|$|E
