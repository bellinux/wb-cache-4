5|$|Sir Bobby Robson {{was raised}} {{a few miles}} away from Tow Law, in the village of Langley Park. He had held the title of life {{president}} at the club, and had helped them out <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>hit</b> financial difficulties after the 2001 foot and mouth crisis, which devastated the local area. He was known {{to spend a lot of}} time on the club, attending fund raisers and giving talks. On 1 August 2009, the club held a minute's silence before their game with Workington, following his death the day before.|$|E
5|$|When a {{raindrop}} {{hits the}} interior of the cup with the proper angle and velocity it can produce considerable force, and can create a splash that drives the water up along the sides of the cup (also known as splash cups), tearing the funiculus, and ejecting the peridioles. The peridioles are followed by their funicular cord and basal hapteron. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>hit</b> a nearby plant stem or stick, the hapteron sticks to it, and the funicular cord wraps around the stem or stick powered by the force of the still-moving peridiole (similar to a tetherball). The peridiole, attached to the plant, may be eaten by herbivorous mammals, and the subsequent passage through its digestive tract will soften the hard shell enough to facilitate later sporulation.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the rugged}} terrain and rough waters {{on the two}} rivers, {{especially}} on the glacier-fed Kootenay, steamboat operation was extremely difficult and proved {{to be anything but}} cost effective. The roughest water was in Jennings Canyon, now mostly submerged in the Lake Koocanusa reservoir behind Libby Dam. Two of the first steamers, the Duchess and the Cline, both sank when transporting miners to the Wild Horse gold rush on the Kootenay. Both ships had not even reached Canal Flats <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>hit</b> rocks in the Columbia. The first steamboat to actually run the Kootenay was the Annerly in 1893. Later vessels, such as the Gwendoline, had mixed success. Captain Frank P. Armstrong, who had piloted several earlier steamboats on the Golden-Jennings run, was her builder and when she was about three-quarters completed, Armstrong decided to take her to Golden to complete the job. Gwendoline sailed up to the canal, which unfortunately was unusable because the gates of the lock had been dynamited due to a Kootenay flood. Armstrong was forced to portage the vessel and eventually made it to Golden. Gwendoline eventually sailed back south to Jennings to haul iron ore on the Kootenay. She was also the only ship to ever travel through the canal by proper means, and made two of the only three steamboat trips through the canal.|$|E

25|$|The {{eruption}} of Krakatoa created pyroclastic flows which generated megatsunamis <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>hit</b> {{the waters of}} the Sunda Strait on 27 August 1883. The waves reached heights of up to 24 metres (79 feet) along the south coast of Sumatra and up to 42 metres (138 feet) along the west coast of Java.|$|E
25|$|Flak from German {{anti-aircraft}} guns resulted in planes either going under or over their prescribed altitudes. Some {{of the men}} who jumped from planes at lower altitudes were injured <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>hit</b> the ground because of their chutes not having enough time to slow their descent, while others who jumped from higher altitudes reported a terrifying descent of several minutes watching tracer fire streaking up towards them.|$|E
25|$|The {{mirror is}} {{aluminized}} by {{placing it in}} a vacuum chamber with electrically heated tungsten or nichrome coils that can evaporate aluminum. In a vacuum, the hot aluminum atoms travel in straight lines. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>hit</b> {{the surface of the}} mirror, they cool and stick. Some mirror coating shops then evaporate a layer of quartz onto the mirror, whereas others expose it to pure oxygen or air in an oven so that the mirror will form a tough, clear layer of aluminum oxide.|$|E

25|$|Wood from mature giant sequoias {{is highly}} {{resistant}} to decay, {{but due to}} being fibrous and brittle, it is generally unsuitable for construction. From the 1880s through the 1920s, logging took place in many groves in spite of marginal commercial returns. The Hume-Bennett Lumber Company {{was the last to}} harvest giant sequoia, going out of business in 1924. Due to their weight and brittleness, trees would often shatter <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>hit</b> the ground, wasting much of the wood. Loggers attempted to cushion the impact by digging trenches and filling them with branches. Still, as little as 50% of the timber is estimated to have made it from groves to the mill. The wood was used mainly for shingles and fence posts, or even for matchsticks.|$|E
25|$|A {{practice}} alert {{had been}} carried out {{earlier in the day}} within the town, and when the aircraft were finally spotted and an alert sounded, many people ignored the warning believing it to be another practice drill. 46 bombs were dropped over Gillingham and Chatham causing much damage. The Drill Hall suffered a direct hit. The bomb shattered the glass roof, sending dangerous shards of glass flying through the drill hall before exploding <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>hit</b> the floor. The clock upon the drill hall tower stopped at 11.12, giving the exact time the bomb exploded. The men asleep or resting inside had little chance of survival, those that were not injured from the explosion were cut to pieces by the falling pieces of glass from the roof.|$|E
25|$|The Legion of Doom would {{challenge}} the Outlaws {{several times in}} the next couple of months but could not win the gold. On one episode of Raw, the Outlaws shaved the head of Road Warrior Hawk and were beaten down further by DX. On February 23, 1998, on Raw, the Legion of Doom seemed to have won the Tag Team titles back <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>hit</b> the Doomsday Device, but as Animal went for the pin, the referee was distracted by Hawk's celebration, allowing the Outlaws to take advantage and win the match. After the match, the Legion of Doom brawled with one another out of frustration and weren't seen on WWE television after that, indicating that the team was disbanded for good.|$|E

25|$|As an {{electron}} enters a magnetic field, it feels a Lorentz force and corkscrews. The radius of this motion is the gyroradius. As it moves it loses some energy as x-rays, {{every time it}} changes speed. The electron spins faster and tighter in denser fields, as it enters the MaGrid. Inside the MaGrid, single electrons travel straight through the null point, due to their infinite gyroradius in regions of no magnetic field. Next, they head towards {{the edges of the}} MaGrid field and corkscrew tighter along the denser magnetic field lines. This is typical electron cyclotron resonance motion. Their gyroradius shrinks and <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>hit</b> a dense magnetic field they can be reflected using the magnetic mirror effect. Electron trapping has been measured in polywells with Langmuir probes.|$|E
25|$|Pole {{and line}} vessels – are used mainly to catch tuna and skipjack. The fishers {{stand at the}} railing or on special {{platforms}} and fish with poles and lines. The lines have hooks which are baited, preferably with live bait. Caught tuna are swung on board, by two to three fishermen if the tuna is big, or with an automated swinging mechanism. The tuna usually release themselves from the barbless hook <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>hit</b> the deck. Tanks with live bait are placed round the decks, and water spray systems are used to attract the fish. The vessels are 15 to 45 metres o/a. On smaller vessels fishers fish from the main deck right around the boat. With larger vessels, {{there are two different}} deck styles: the American style and the Japanese style.|$|E
25|$|Many {{lifeboats}} overturned while loading or lowering, spilling passengers {{into the}} sea; others were overturned by the ship's motion <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>hit</b> the water. It has been claimed that some boats, {{because of the}} negligence of some officers, crashed down onto the deck, crushing other passengers, and sliding down towards the bridge. This has been disputed by passenger and crew testimony. Some crewmen would lose their grip on ropes used to lower the lifeboats while trying to lower the boats into the ocean, and this caused the passengers to spill into the sea. Others tipped on launch as some panicking people jumped into the boat. Lusitania had 48 lifeboats, more than enough for all the crew and passengers, but only six were successfully lowered, all from the starboard side. Lifeboat 1 overturned as it was being lowered, spilling its original occupants into the sea, but it managed to right itself shortly afterwards and was later filled with people from in the water. Lifeboats 9 and 11 managed to reach the water safely with a few people, but both later picked up many swimmers. Lifeboats 13 and 15 also safely reached the water, each overloaded with around 70 people. Finally, Lifeboat 21 reached the water safely and cleared the ship moments before her final plunge. A few of her collapsible lifeboats washed off her decks as she sank and provided floatation for some survivors.|$|E

25|$|The Dodgers {{began their}} final road trip {{of the season}} against the Arizona Diamondbacks. Clayton Kershaw took a two-hit shutout into the ninth inning before leaving the game and Kenley Jansen picked up his second career save in the Dodgers' 3–1 victory in the opener. In the next game, John Ely allowed four runs and six walks in 5 innings as the Dodgers lost the game 5–2 to the Diamondbacks. In the next game, Chad Billingsley allowed only one run on four hits in seven innings while {{striking}} out a career-high 13 batters. Rod Barajas's two-run homer {{in the top of}} the eighth staked the Dodgers to a 4–1 lead but the bullpen once more melted down in the eighth. George Sherrill allowed a two-run homer to Tony Abreu and then Jonathan Broxton served up a two-run shot to Chris Young and the Dodgers lost 5–4. The game was Broxton's seventh blown save of the season. The Dodgers next traveled to Colorado to face the Rockies. Ted Lilly halted a personal four-game losing streak by allowing one run in eight innings as the Dodgers beat the Rockies 3–1, preventing Ubaldo Jiménez from picking up his 20th win. The Dodgers officially ended the Rockies' post-season hopes the following night <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>hit</b> four home runs (including two by Casey Blake) in a 9–7 victory. Rookie Kenley Jansen picked up his third save of the season. Matt Kemp's grand slam home run helped the Dodgers defeat the Rockies 7–6 for their first series sweep in more than a month.|$|E
