5|$|After Georgia Tech's post-score kickoff, <b>Wake</b> <b>Forest</b> {{continued}} to struggle on offense. Quarterback Riley Skinner was sacked, threw an 18-yard completion, then three incomplete passes. Wake {{was forced to}} punt the ball away again, allowing the Yellow Jackets the possibility of expanding their lead. On Tech's first play after the punt, however, Reggie Ball's pass was intercepted, allowing <b>Wake</b> <b>Forest</b> another chance on offense. The play turned {{the momentum of the}} game in favor of <b>Wake</b> <b>Forest,</b> who proceeded to move the ball with slightly more effectiveness. During the <b>Wake</b> <b>Forest</b> drive, Skinner completed a 39-yard pass to John Tereshinski, who drove the Deacons inside Georgia Tech territory, where the drive continued. Though <b>Wake</b> <b>Forest</b> was forced to settle for a 33-yard field goal from kicker Sam Swank, the score tied the game at 66 with 7:59 remaining in the game.|$|E
5|$|After {{receiving}} the <b>Wake</b> <b>Forest</b> kickoff, however, Georgia Tech's hopes were quickly deflated by three plays {{that resulted in}} negative yardage or no gain. Georgia Tech was forced into its final punt of the game, and <b>Wake</b> <b>Forest</b> received the ball and ran out the remaining time on the clock. <b>Wake</b> <b>Forest</b> won the 2006 ACC Championship Game by a 96 score.|$|E
5|$|Following the Georgia Tech punt, <b>Wake</b> <b>Forest</b> {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the second quarter. <b>Wake</b> <b>Forest,</b> after a three and out, again punted the ball and Georgia Tech took over on offense. On their first full possession of the second quarter, Tech seemed to have more success moving the ball. Quarterback Reggie Ball picked up a first down running the ball, then completed a 22-yard pass to wide receiver Calvin Johnson, driving the Yellow Jackets inside <b>Wake</b> <b>Forest</b> territory. Once there, however, Wake Forest's defense stiffened. Ball was unable to complete two consecutive passes, and his third pass inside <b>Wake</b> <b>Forest</b> territory was intercepted.|$|E

5|$|Because Georgia Tech {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the game, <b>Wake</b> <b>Forest</b> {{received the}} ball to begin the second half.

5|$|Boston College (ACC: 3–3) {{could travel}} to the ACC Championship Game if they won out by beating both <b>Wake</b> <b>Forest</b> and Maryland. Boston College {{eventually}} did just that, and lost to Virginia Tech in the 2008 ACC Championship Game. Florida State (ACC: 4–3) would have won the Atlantic Division if they beat Maryland, Maryland beat Boston College, and Boston College beat <b>Wake</b> <b>Forest.</b> Under those circumstances, Florida State would have finished with a 5–3record, tied with Maryland. Florida State would win the tiebreaker because they had defeated Maryland head-to-head. As it happened, Maryland lost to Boston College, which relegated Florida State to a second-place finish in the division. <b>Wake</b> <b>Forest</b> (ACC: 4–3) would have won the division if they won their last game against Boston College, and both Florida State and Boston College beat Maryland. In that case, Florida State and <b>Wake</b> <b>Forest</b> would have had identical conference records (ACC: 5–3), and <b>Wake</b> <b>Forest</b> would have won the tiebreaker because they defeated Florida State earlier in the season.|$|E
5|$|Florida State {{defeated}} Virginia Tech, 2722 in {{the first}} ACC Championship game. The following year, the game, held in Jacksonville, Florida, pitted <b>Wake</b> <b>Forest</b> against Georgia Tech, with <b>Wake</b> <b>Forest</b> winning 96. Before the 2007 season began, most sports writers and pollsters predicted that Florida State would win the Atlantic Division while Virginia Tech would win the Coastal Division, setting up a rematch of the 2005 ACC Championship Game.|$|E
5|$|Low {{attendance}} and poor weather marred the contest, which kicked off amid rain and fog. Defense dominated from the beginning, as Georgia Tech took a 30 {{lead in the}} first quarter. <b>Wake</b> <b>Forest</b> evened the score before halftime, however, and the two teams headed into the second half tied at 33. After a scoreless third quarter, Georgia Tech took a 63 lead {{early in the fourth}} quarter. After Tech quarterback Reggie Ball threw a critical interception, <b>Wake</b> <b>Forest</b> was able to tie the game, then take a 96 lead. With time running out, Wake's defense denied Georgia Tech a game-winning score, and <b>Wake</b> <b>Forest</b> clinched the win.|$|E

5|$|<b>Wake</b> <b>Forest</b> {{kicked off}} {{to begin the}} game, and Georgia Tech {{returned}} the kick to its own 24-yard line. On the first play of the game, Tech running back Tashard Choice attempted a rush, but was stopped for a loss of one yard. The play {{set the tone for}} the rest of the game, which would be a hard-fought, low-scoring defensive struggle. After the loss, Choice broke free on the second play of the game for a 24-yard run and a first down. On the next two plays, the Georgia Tech offense used their passing attack as quarterback Reggie Ball completed two passes, driving the Yellowjackets into <b>Wake</b> <b>Forest</b> territory. Subsequent plays allowed Tech to penetrate the <b>Wake</b> <b>Forest</b> red zone, but there, the Demon Deacons' defense stiffened. Despite having a first down inside the <b>Wake</b> <b>Forest</b> 10-yard line, Georgia Tech did not cross the goal line. Denied a touchdown, Georgia Tech was forced to settle for a field goal attempt from kicker Travis Bell. Bell's kick was good, and with 9:59 remaining in the first quarter, Georgia Tech took a 30 lead.|$|E

5|$|Following Georgia Tech's post-score kickoff, <b>Wake</b> <b>Forest</b> {{received}} the ball, {{but failed to}} gain a first down. The Deacons' offense went three and out {{and was forced to}} punt. On Tech's next possession, they too had difficulty moving the football on offense. Though they picked up a first down off of a penalty on <b>Wake</b> <b>Forest,</b> they were unable to gain a first down by their own devices and were forced to punt the ball away.|$|E
5|$|Having {{regained the}} ball, <b>Wake</b> <b>Forest</b> {{answered}} Georgia Tech's drive {{with one of}} their own. Several Wake running backs rushed with the ball, but it was <b>Wake</b> <b>Forest</b> quarterback Riley Skinner who advanced the ball the most. He completed a 24-yard pass to Willie Idlette, then an eight-yard toss to Nate Morton. Inside Tech territory, Wake's offense stumbled. Skinner was sacked by a Tech defender, and kicker Sam Swank was sent into the game to attempt a 45-yard field goal. Swank's kick was no good, and with 7:26 remaining in the second quarter, Georgia Tech still had a 30 lead.|$|E

5|$|Maryland (ACC: 4–2) {{would have}} won the {{division}} title if they had either: (1) beaten both Florida State and Boston College; (2) beaten Florida State, while Boston College lost to Wake Forest; or (3) beaten Boston College, while Boston College lost to <b>Wake</b> <b>Forest.</b> That last scenario would have caused a three-way tie between Maryland, Florida State, and <b>Wake</b> <b>Forest.</b> All would have possessed a 5–3 conference record, and no head-to-head tiebreaker would have been possible. In that case, the winner would have been decided by divisional record, of which the Terrapins {{would have had the}} best (ACC Atlantic: 4–1).|$|E
5|$|The 2006 Dr Pepper ACC Championship Game {{featured}} the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets and the <b>Wake</b> <b>Forest</b> Demon Deacons in a regular-season American football game {{to determine the}} champion of the Atlantic Coast Conference. <b>Wake</b> <b>Forest</b> defeated Georgia Tech by a 96 score to win its first ACC football championship since 1970 and its second in school history.

After the win against <b>Wake</b> <b>Forest,</b> Clemson beat Virginia, Duke, North Carolina State, Maryland, and North Carolina.
