5|$|Monday, 16 August 1819, <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>hot</b> summer's day, with a {{cloudless}} blue sky.

5|$|Nittany Furnace, known earlier as Valentine Furnace, <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>hot</b> blast iron furnace {{located in}} Spring Township, Centre County, Pennsylvania, United States. Placed in {{operation}} in 1888 {{on the site}} of an older furnace, it was an important feature of Bellefonte economic life until it closed in 1911, no longer able to compete with more modern steel producers.|$|E
5|$|July 9, 1861 <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>hot</b> day, and Fanny {{was putting}} locks of her children's hair into an {{envelope}} {{and attempting to}} seal it with hot sealing wax while Longfellow took a nap. Her dress suddenly caught fire, though it is unclear exactly how; burning wax or a lighted candle may have fallen onto it. Longfellow was awakened from his nap and rushed to help her, throwing a rug over her, though it was too small. He stifled the flames with his body as best he could, but she was already badly burned. Over half a century later, Longfellow's youngest daughter Annie explained the story differently, claiming {{that there had been}} no candle or wax but that the fire had started from a self-lighting match that had fallen on the floor. Both accounts state that Fanny was taken to her room to recover and a doctor was called. She {{was in and out of}} consciousness throughout the night and was administered ether. She died shortly after 10:00 the next morning, July 10, after requesting a cup of coffee. Longfellow, in trying to save her, had burned himself badly enough so that he was unable to attend her funeral. His facial injuries led him to stop shaving, and he wore a beard from then on that became his trademark.|$|E

25|$|After 2003, Ray <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>hot</b> commodity. NFL scouts {{were known}} to be looking at Ray, and during the {{off-season}} Ray was able to stick with the New York Jets. The loss of the star quarterback dismayed Eskimos fans, but this was tempered with calm knowing that Maas was around to fill the void in 2004.|$|E
25|$|Nicholaus Smithurst, vicar of East Stoke, {{recorded}} 49 communicants, no recusants {{and just}} two dissenters in Syerston. Demographic historians {{suggest that the}} proportion of the population over 16 in such settlements at the time was about 65%, which implies a total population of about 78. The Rev Smithurst found no Catholics or other dissenters in East Stoke or Elston Chapel, but next door Flintham <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>hot</b> spot of nonconformity and the vicar, Edward Guy, found as many as 40 dissenters. At any rate the authorities had little need to fear papistry in Syerston.|$|E
25|$|Before the APEC {{summit in}} November 2006, {{the issue of}} human rights <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>hot</b> topic on Harper's agenda. He {{discussed}} the issue in Vietnam with Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung where there have been also criticism on the country's respect of rights. At the APEC summit in Hanoi, Vietnam, Harper met with Hu, after tensions {{between the two countries}} nearly called off a scheduled meeting between the two leaders. There were no official reports of discussions on the issue of human rights, but Harper had urged that the {{relations between the two countries}} needs to be built.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} day, October 8, <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>hot</b> {{and sunny}} {{day on the}} island. At approximately, 11:00 a.m. local time, some Marines were {{taking a break from}} official duties and resting at a beach-side campsite during a lull in the training. They thus did not have live ammunition in their rifles for training purposes, although a few commissioned officers and senior NCOs carried Beretta M9 sidearms loaded with live ammunition. Soon thereafter, the two gunmen began shooting at the Marines with Kalashnikov rifles, specifically targeting two Marines playing a makeshift game of baseball during a rest in the training. One nearby Marine became disgruntled after hearing the gunfire, mistaking it for that of his fellow Marines, but soon realized otherwise.|$|E
25|$|Immediately {{after the}} Big Bang, the {{universe}} <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>hot,</b> dense plasma of photons, electrons, and quarks: the Quark epoch. At 0.000001 seconds, the Universe had expanded and cooled sufficiently {{to allow for}} the formation of protons: the Hadron epoch. This plasma was effectively opaque to electromagnetic radiation due to Thomson scattering by free electrons, as the mean free path each photon could travel before encountering an electron was very short. This is {{the current state of the}} interior of the Sun. As the universe expanded, it also cooled. Eventually, the universe cooled to the point that the formation of neutral hydrogen was energetically favored, and the fraction of free electrons and protons as compared to neutral hydrogen decreased to a few parts in 10,000.|$|E
25|$|The Badgers first road game of {{the season}} <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>hot</b> one as the game time {{temperature}} was 98 degrees. Arizona State's opening drive took them down to the Wisconsin 3-yard line but on fourth and two the Sun Devils went for it but failed. Both offenses struggled for most of the first quarter until the Sun Devils kicked a 34-yard field goal with 4:08 left in the first quarter. The Badgers then put a 10-play 73-yard drive together that took 5:22 and into the second quarter. The Badgers capped that nice drive with a 2-yard touchdown pass from QB Joel Stave to TE Jacob Pedersen. On the next drive, the Sun Devils had a three-and-out. Arizona State attempted to punt the ball but because of a bad snap, Wisconsin's DT Beau Allen recovered the ball in the end zone for a touchdown giving the Badgers a 14–3 lead. Arizona State answered right back with a 10-play 75-yard scoring drive capped by a 2-yard touchdown run by RB Marion Grice. The Sun Devils added a 19-yard field goal before the half cutting the Wisconsin lead to 14–13.|$|E

25|$|His {{other groups}} {{would include the}} Adrian Rollini Quintette, The Adrian Rollini Trio (primarily late 1930s), and Adrian and his Tap Room Gang based in the Hotel President at 234 West 48th Street in New York City. He managed Adrian's Tap Room, inside the hotel during the early swing era {{starting}} in 1935, as well as leading the small band of 6–8 players. He had the Whitby Grill on West 45th Street. Both of these were indicative of his inseparability of professional and social life. His clientele in each club were {{for the most part}} musicians on a holiday. Rollini could be found on the radio working with artists like Kate Smith. As if he didn't have enough going for him he turned once again to another phase of musical venture, and opened a store for sale and repair of musical instruments, known as White Way Musical Products which was located at 1587 Broadway. It had long been his belief that the artist playing the instrument knows more about it than the maker concerned only with the mechanics. The shop <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>hot</b> spot for autograph hounds who trolled the shop in search of famous band leaders. He was also making excursions between the Georgian Room and the Piccadilly Circus Bar, both in the Piccadilly Hotel. He also began recording for Master and Muzak.|$|E
500|$|Like the show, The Stick of Truth satirizes {{political}} and social issues including abortion, race relations, anal probes, drug addiction, sex, extreme violence, and poverty. Creative consultant Jordan Thomas said, [...] "The way we looked at [...] was if this moment <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>hot</b> button for the audience, should we make it worse, because [...] love to push boundaries and their default response was definitely not to back down, but the really healthy counterbalance was, can we make it funnierand the answer was often yes".|$|E

500|$|In December 2006, George W. Bush showed dissatisfaction when he {{was asked}} if he was in denial about the {{situation}} in Iraq (the most Bush had said about the situation was that the increase in attacks was [...] "unsettling"). Bush replied [...] "It's bad in Iraq. Does that help?". He had another run-in with Bush at a press conference at Camp David, when Bush asked him [...] "you still hanging around?". He then suggested to Robinson, with reference {{to the fact that it}} <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>hot</b> day, that [...] "next time you should cover your bald head". As Bush walked away, Robinson replied [...] "I didn't know you cared", to which Bush responded [...] "I don't". Robinson described his quip as a [...] "fatal error" [...] on his blog. In a final encounter in 2008, Bush joked with Robinson about still not wearing his hat.|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} factors {{influenced}} the opera's very favourable reception. The initial cast contained leading singers of the period and, as it changed, equally brilliant stars (e.g. Falcon) were introduced as replacements. The sensational plot and the notoriety of the Nuns' ballet ensured that the opera <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>hot</b> topic in journals and reviews. This was assisted by the marketing skills of the director Véron and the publisher Schlesinger. The scenery was of exceptional quality: [...] "This was as much an opera to see as to hear, {{and it has been}} argued that the real hero behind Robert le diable was Cicéri, the designer." [...] Meyerbeer was keen to keep influential persons on his side. For example, he sent free tickets for 'a good box' to Heinrich Heine. And of course the businessman Véron knew how to use (and pay) the claque and its leader Augustin Levasseur.|$|E
500|$|This was {{the third}} time that an episode of The Simpsons focused on homosexuality. The episode—written by J. Stewart Burns and {{directed}} by Nancy Kruse—was inspired by the 2004 same-sex weddings that occurred in San Francisco. According to executive producer Al Jean, the staff wanted the episode to explore what the different characters' stances on same-sex marriage were. Around {{the time of the}} episode's original airdate, February 20, 2005, the same-sex marriage question <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>hot</b> political issue in the United States and the episode became controversial. [...] "There's Something About Marrying" [...] received a lot of criticism from conservative groups, including the Parents Television Council and the American Family Association, that claimed it was promoting gay marriage. Jean stated in response that the staff was not taking a side on the issue and that they were just examining all sides of it. Positive reaction to the episode came from, among others, the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation and the gay-oriented website AfterEllen.com.|$|E

500|$|On April 16, 1953 {{against the}} St. Louis Browns (the second {{game of the}} season, and Chicago's home opener) Pierce pitched his second one-hitter, a 1–0 victory in which he allowed only a seventh-inning double by Bobby Young; the White Sox gained only two singles in the contest, and scored on a walk, {{sacrifice}} hit, error and sacrifice fly. Pierce was chosen to start the All-Star Game for the AL – the first White Sox pitcher ever to do so – and allowed only one hit through three innings (a single by Stan Musial). Boston Red Sox star Ted Williams recalled of the game: [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>hot</b> day at Crosley Field and I remember being so concerned for little Billy Pierce of the White Sox. Billy probably threw harder than anybody for a guy his size, he had a real big delivery, nice to look at, and he had overcome a lot. I understand he had had epilepsy, and I was really pulling for him. He was a nervous little guy, {{and here he was}} starting his first All-Star game in a bandbox park that's tough to pitch in, and against Robin Roberts to boot. Pierce held them {{in the palm of his}} hand that day. He threw the ball right by everybody." ...|$|E
500|$|The highly popular [...] is {{considered}} one of the most important hi-fi components in the history of home audio. Sonically, it benefited from a design error where crosstalk between left and right channels presented better detail and more ambiance; the error was corrected in a later guise. Its sound is described by reviewers as dark and warm, with a [...] "sweet and sensual midrange"; some reviewers observed a very noticeable rolling off at frequency extremes that may detract from sonic neutrality, and that its soundstage lacked precision but it was universally praised for its value for money. The amplifier <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>hot</b> seller, and the [...] alone achieved a record 1.1 million units in its lifetime. The figure would be much higher if the sales of other amplifiers derived directly from its design are included. The quality made possible at a £79 (US$133) price tag opened up the market for budget yet quality amplifiers, and spawned similarly low-priced competitors such as ARCAM Alpha, Rotel 840, Mission , Pioneer A400, Denon [...] and Marantz [...] In 2002 it ranked No. 19 in list of [...] "The Hot 100 Products" [...] by Stereophile. In 2011, The Absolute Sound placed it at No. 9 in their list of [...] "The Ten Most Significant Amplifiers of All Time". The Absolute Sound remarked that this [...] "iconic gem could embarrass amplifiers costing 10 times more with its big, warm and detailed sound and best of all, its affordable price made it available to a wider audience." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{the morning}} of Friday, September 6, 1901, McKinley dressed {{formally}} as usual, then departed the Milburn House for a stroll through the neighborhood. [...] The President nearly slipped away unguarded; when the police and soldiers noticed him leaving, they hurried after him. Czolgosz also rose early {{with the intent of}} lining up for the public reception at the Temple of Music; he reached the Exposition gates at 8:30a.m., {{in time to see the}} President pass in his carriage en route to the train station for the visit to Niagara Falls. [...] The McKinleys traveled by train to Lewiston, where they switched to trolleys to view the Niagara Gorge. [...] When the party reached the municipality of Niagara Falls, they transferred to carriages to see the sights. [...] The party rode halfway across the Honeymoon Bridge overlooking the Falls, though McKinley was careful not to enter Canada for reasons of protocol. [...] It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>hot</b> day, and Ida McKinley felt ill due to the heat; she was driven to the International Hotel to await her husband, who toured Goat Island before joining his wife for lunch. [...] After smoking a cigar on the veranda, the President rode with his wife to the train which now awaited them nearby, and saw her settled there before touring the hydroelectric plant at the Falls. [...] The train then returned to Buffalo so McKinley could attend the reception at the Temple of Music. [...] Ida McKinley had originally intended to accompany her husband to the auditorium, but as she was not fully recovered, she decided to return to the Milburn House to rest. [...] As the time allotted for the reception had been pared down to ten minutes, the President did not expect to be separated from his wife for long. [...] As it was only 3:30p.m., McKinley stopped for refreshments at the Mission Building before proceeding to the Temple of Music.|$|E
