5|$|Plant {{construction}} can {{adversely affect}} land stability. Subsidence {{has occurred in}} the Wairakei field in New Zealand. In Staufen im Breisgau, Germany, tectonic uplift occurred instead, due to a previously isolated anhydrite layer coming in contact <b>with</b> <b>water</b> <b>and</b> turning into gypsum, doubling its volume.|$|E
5|$|Bromine pentafluoride (BrF5) {{was first}} {{synthesised}} in 1930. It is produced {{on a large}} scale by direct reaction of bromine with excess fluorine at temperatures higher than 150°C, and on a small scale by the fluorination of potassium bromide at 25°C. It is a very vigorous fluorinating agent, although chlorine trifluoride is still more violent. Bromine pentafluoride explodes on reaction <b>with</b> <b>water</b> <b>and</b> fluorinates silicates at 450°C.|$|E

5|$|Construction {{proceeded}} quickly, but disaster almost struck {{when the}} aqueduct was first filled <b>with</b> <b>water</b> <b>and</b> {{one of its}} three arches began to buckle under the weight. Remedial work took several months, but the aqueduct was still opened to traffic only 15 months after the enabling Act of Parliament had been passed, on 17 July 1761. It remained in use for more than 100 years, until {{the construction of the}} Manchester Ship Canal necessitated its demolition in 1893, replaced by the Barton Swing Aqueduct.|$|E
5|$|In {{collections}} {{which contain}} fossils, high humidity can also affect pyrite (or its more reactive polymorph marcasite) (iron sulphide) fossils {{in a somewhat}} similar condition, which is known as pyrite disease. The iron sulfide can react <b>with</b> <b>water</b> <b>and</b> oxygen to form iron sulfates and sulfuric acid, which then can produce Bynesian decay.|$|E
5|$|Industrial {{production}} of selenium usually involves {{the extraction of}} selenium dioxide from residues obtained during the purification of copper. Common production from the residue then begins by oxidation with sodium carbonate to produce selenium dioxide, which is mixed <b>with</b> <b>water</b> <b>and</b> acidified to form selenous acid (oxidation step). Selenous acid is bubbled with sulfur dioxide (reduction step) to give elemental selenium.|$|E

5|$|It is {{not known}} what human organs are {{affected}} by interaction with promethium; a possible candidate is the bone tissues. Sealed promethium-147 is not dangerous. However, if the packaging is damaged, then promethium becomes dangerous {{to the environment and}} humans. If radioactive contamination is found, the contaminated area should be washed <b>with</b> <b>water</b> <b>and</b> soap, but, even though promethium mainly affects the skin, the skin should not be abraded. If a promethium leak is found, the area should be identified as hazardous and evacuated, and emergency services must be contacted. No dangers from promethium aside from the radioactivity are known.|$|E
5|$|Known as baka or baka ni viti in Fiji, Ficus obliqua {{has many}} of its parts used in Fijian {{traditional}} medicine, and was previously held to be sacred there. Its white sap {{has been used for}} painful or swollen joints and limbs or boils, or diluted <b>with</b> <b>water</b> <b>and</b> drunk to improve breast milk. Liquid extracted from the root bark has been used for headaches or, when diluted, to improve health after childbirth, and the leaves are applied to venereal lesions. The species has been traditionally used for boils in Samoa and Tonga.|$|E
5|$|Rubidium reacts violently <b>with</b> <b>water</b> <b>and</b> {{can cause}} fires. To ensure safety and purity, this metal is usually kept under a dry mineral oil or sealed in glass {{ampoules}} in an inert atmosphere. Rubidium forms peroxides on exposure even to {{small amount of}} air diffused into the oil, and storage is subject to similar precautions as the storage of metallic potassium.|$|E

5|$|Several oxides of cobalt are known. Green cobalt(II) oxide (CoO) has rocksalt structure. It {{is readily}} {{oxidized}} <b>with</b> <b>water</b> <b>and</b> oxygen to brown cobalt(III) hydroxide (Co(OH)3). At temperatures of 600–700°C, CoO oxidizes {{to the blue}} cobalt(II,III) oxide (Co3O4), which has a spinel structure. Black cobalt(III) oxide (Co2O3) is also known. Cobalt oxides are antiferromagnetic at low temperature: CoO (Néel temperature 291K) and Co3O4 (Néel temperature: 40K), which is analogous to magnetite (Fe3O4), {{with a mixture of}} +2 and +3 oxidation states.|$|E
5|$|Tellurites can be leached {{from the}} mixture <b>with</b> <b>water</b> <b>and</b> are {{normally}} present as hydrotellurites HTeO3− in solution. Selenites are also formed during this process, {{but they can}} be separated by adding sulfuric acid. The hydrotellurites are converted into the insoluble tellurium dioxide while the selenites stay in solution.|$|E
5|$|The {{conservation}} {{was carried}} out between 1974 and 1986, wherever possible using non-invasive procedures such as washing <b>with</b> <b>water</b> <b>and</b> a solution of lime, filling gaps and damaged surfaces with soft mortar to prevent the ingress of water and stabilising statues that were fracturing because of the corrosion of metal dowels. The surfaces were finished by painting with a thin coat of mortar and silane to resist further erosion and attack by pollutants. The restoration of the façade revealed much paint adhering to the statues and their niches, indicating that it had once been brightly coloured.|$|E

5|$|The highest known {{ruthenium}} halide is the hexafluoride, a {{dark brown}} solid that melts at 54°C. It hydrolyzes violently upon contact <b>with</b> <b>water</b> <b>and</b> easily disproportionates {{to form a}} mixture of lower ruthenium fluorides, releasing fluorine gas. Ruthenium pentafluoride is a tetrameric dark green solid that is also readily hydrolyzed, melting at 86.5°C. The yellow ruthenium tetrafluoride is probably also polymeric and can be formed by reducing the pentafluoride with iodine. Among the binary compounds of ruthenium, these high oxidation states are known only in the oxides and fluorides.|$|E
5|$|As {{the wave}} {{breaches}} the Himalayas and approaches the site, an impact driver lodges in the ark-door gears, keeping a boarding gate open and preventing the ship's engines from starting. In the ensuing chaos where many people attempt {{to board the}} ships, Yuri, Tamara and Gordon are killed, Tenzin is injured, Ark 4 begins filling <b>with</b> <b>water</b> <b>and</b> is set adrift after Air Force One crashes into one of its supports, while also causing it to skim the hull of Ark 6 before drifting off.

5|$|Bacteria {{used for}} {{biological}} control infect insects via their digestive tracts, so they offer only limited options for controlling insects with sucking mouth parts such as aphids and scale insects. Bacillus thuringiensis {{is the most}} widely applied species of bacteria used for biological control, with at least four sub-species used against Lepidopteran (moth, butterfly), Coleopteran (beetle) and Dipteran (true fly) insect pests. The bacterium is available to organic farmers in sachets of dried spores which are mixed <b>with</b> <b>water</b> <b>and</b> sprayed onto vulnerable plants such as brassicas and fruit trees. Genes from B. thuringiensis have also been incorporated into transgenic crops, making the plants express some of the bacterium's toxins, which are proteins. These confer resistance to insect pests and thus reduce the necessity for pesticide use. If pests develop resistance to the toxins in these crops, B. thuringiensis will become useless in organic farming also.|$|E

5|$|Baleen whales {{use their}} baleen plates to sieve plankton, among others, {{out of the}} water; {{there are two types}} of methods: lunge-feeding and gulp-feeding. Lunge-feeders expand the volume of their jaw to a volume bigger than the {{original}} volume of the whale itself by inflating their mouth. This causes grooves on their throat to expand, increasing the amount of water the mouth can store. They ram a baitball at high speeds in order to feed, but this is only energy-effective when used against a large baitball. Gulp-feeders swim with an open mouth, filling it <b>with</b> <b>water</b> <b>and</b> prey. Prey must occur in sufficient numbers to trigger the whale's interest, be within a certain size range so that the baleen plates can filter it, and be slow enough so that it cannot escape.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{initiation}} proper, Lucius must undergo {{a series of}} ritual purifications. The priest bathes him, asks the gods for forgiveness on his behalf, and sprinkles him with water. This confession of and repentance for past sins fits {{with an emphasis on}} chastity and other forms of self-denial found in many other sources about the Isis cult. Lucius next has to wait ten days, while abstaining from meat and wine, before {{the initiation}} begins. Purifying baths were common in many rituals across the Greco-Roman world. The plea for forgiveness, however, may derive from the oaths that Egyptian priests were required to take, in which they declared themselves to be free of wrongdoing. The sprinkling <b>with</b> <b>water</b> <b>and</b> the refraining from certain foods probably come from the purification rituals that those priests had to undergo before entering a temple. On the evening of the final day, Lucius receives a variety of gifts from fellow devotees of Isis before donning a clean linen robe and entering the deepest part of the temple.|$|E
5|$|Chlorine is {{detectable}} with {{measuring devices}} in concentrations {{as low as}} 0.2 parts per million (ppm), and by smell at 3 ppm. Coughing and vomiting may occur at 30 ppm and lung damage at 60ppm. About 1000ppm can be fatal after a few deep breaths of the gas. The IDLH (immediately dangerous to life and health) concentration is 10 ppm. Breathing lower concentrations can aggravate the respiratory system and exposure to the gas can irritate the eyes. The toxicity of chlorine comes from its oxidizing power. When chlorine is inhaled at concentrations greater than 30ppm, it reacts <b>with</b> <b>water</b> <b>and</b> cellular fluid, producing hydrochloric acid (HCl) and hypochlorous acid (HClO).|$|E
