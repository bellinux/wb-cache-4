5|$|Due {{partly to}} the limited success of his latest book outside Indiana, Riley was persuaded to begin <b>working</b> <b>with</b> <b>other</b> midwestern writers to attempt to form an {{association}} to promote their work. Popular Indiana writer Lew Wallace, author of , was a major promoter of the effort. During 1885, {{more than one hundred}} writers joined the group. They held their first meeting in July, naming themselves the Western Association of Writers. At the meeting Maurice Thompson was named president, and Riley vice president.

5|$|Sunset Overdrive {{was among}} {{one of the}} first Xbox One exclusives {{revealed}} at Microsoft's press conference at E3 2013. The first gameplay details were revealed by gaming magazine Edge in May 2014. A gameplay demo and a release date announcement happened at E3 2014.

Insomniac denied such rumors, saying the company would still be <b>working</b> <b>with</b> <b>other</b> publishers to produce titles and that petitions would not change Sunset Overdrives status as an Xbox exclusive. It was released on October 28, 2014.|$|E
