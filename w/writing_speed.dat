25|$|Medieval scribes {{who wrote}} in Latin {{increased}} their <b>writing</b> <b>speed</b> by combining characters and by introducing notational abbreviations. Others conjoined letters for aesthetic purposes. For example, in blackletter, letters with right-facing bowls (b, o, and p) and those with left-facing bowls (c, e, o, d, g and q) were written with the facing edges of the bowls superimposed. In many script forms, characters such as h, m, and n had their vertical strokes superimposed. Scribes also used notational abbreviations {{to avoid having to}} write a whole character in one stroke. Manuscripts in the fourteenth century employed hundreds of such abbreviations.|$|E
25|$|According to {{the book}} Hvem er skrivekuglens opfinder? (English: Who is the {{inventor}} of the Writing Ball?), written by Malling-Hansen's daughter, Johanne Agerskov, in 1865, Malling-Hansen made a porcelain model of the keyboard of his writing ball and experimented with different placements of the letters to achieve the fastest <b>writing</b> <b>speed.</b> Malling-Hansen placed the letters on short pistons that went directly through the ball and down to the paper. This, together with the placement of the letters so that the fastest writing fingers struck the most frequently used letters, made the Hansen Writing Ball the first typewriter to produce text substantially faster than a person could write by hand.|$|E
500|$|After resting {{for a week}} in June 1846 at the Château de Saché in Tours, Balzac {{returned}} to Paris and began working on a short story called [...] "Le Parasite", which he eventually developed into the novel Le Cousin Pons. He intended from the start to pair it with another novel, collecting them under the title Les Parents pauvres ("The Poor Relations"). He based the second book on a story his sister Laure Surville had written called [...] "La Cousine Rosalie" [...] and published in 1844 in Le Journal des enfants. Writing intensively, he produced the entire novel, named La Cousine Bette after the main character, in two months. This was a significant accomplishment owing to his bad health, but its length made Balzac's <b>writing</b> <b>speed</b> especially remarkable. One critic calls the writing of Les Parents pauvres Balzac's [...] "last explosion of creative energy". Another suggests that this effort was [...] "almost the last straw which broke down Balzac's gigantic strength".|$|E

2500|$|Chinese {{characters}} are basically logograms constructed with strokes. Over the millennia {{a set of}} generally agreed rules have been developed by custom. Minor variations exist between countries, but the basic principles remain the same, namely that writing characters should be economical, with the fewest hand movements to write the most strokes possible. This promotes <b>writing</b> <b>speed,</b> accuracy, and readability. This idea is particularly important since as learners progress, characters often get more complex. Since stroke order also aids learning and memorization, students are often taught about it from {{a very early age}} in schools and encouraged to follow them.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{systems of}} {{shorthand}} use diacritics for vowels, {{but they do}} not have an inherent vowel, and are thus more similar to Thaana and Kurdish script than to the Brahmic scripts. The Gabelsberger shorthand system and its derivatives modify the following consonant to represent vowels. The Pollard script, which was based on shorthand, also uses diacritics for vowels; the placements of the vowel relative to the consonant indicates tone. Pitman shorthand uses straight strokes and quarter-circle marks in different orientations as the principal [...] "alphabet" [...] of consonants; vowels are shown as light and heavy dots, dashes and other marks in one of 3 possible positions to indicate the various vowel-sounds. However, to increase <b>writing</b> <b>speed,</b> Pitman has rules for [...] using the positioning or choice of consonant signs so that writing vowel-marks can be dispensed with.|$|E

2500|$|Speed classes 2, 4, and 6 {{assert that}} the card {{supports}} the respective number of megabytes per second as a minimum sustained <b>write</b> <b>speed</b> for a card in a fragmented state.

The host device can read a card's speed class and warn the user if the card reports a speed class that falls below an application's minimum need. By comparison, the older [...] "×" [...] rating measured maximum speed under ideal conditions, and was vague as to whether this was read <b>speed</b> or <b>write</b> <b>speed.</b> The graphical symbol for the speed class has a number encircled with 'C' (C2, C4, C6, and C10).|$|R
2500|$|Pitman {{shorthand}} uses straight {{strokes and}} quarter-circle strokes, in various orientations, to represent consonant sounds. [...] The predominant way of indicating vowels {{is to use}} light or heavy dots, dashes, or other special marks drawn close to the consonant. Vowels are drawn before the stroke (or over a horizontal stroke) if the vowel is pronounced ahead of the consonant, and after the stroke (or under a horizontal stroke) if pronounced after the consonant. Each vowel, whether indicated by a dot for a short vowel or by a dash for a longer, more drawn-out vowel, has its own position relative to its adjacent stroke (beginning, middle, or end) to indicate different vowel sounds in an unambiguous system. However, to increase <b>writing</b> <b>speed,</b> rules of [...] "vowel indication" [...] exist whereby the consonant stroke is raised, kept on the line, or lowered to match whether the first vowel of the word is written at the beginning, middle, or end of a consonant stroke—without actually writing the vowel. This is often enough to distinguish words with similar consonant patterns. Another method of vowel indication is to choose from among a selection of different strokes for the same consonant. For example, the sound [...] "R" [...] has two kinds of strokes: round, or straight-line, depending on {{whether there is a}} vowel sound before or after the R.|$|E

From the book Hvem er Skrivekuglens Opfinder, written by Malling-Hansen's daughter Johanne Agerskov, we know how Malling-Hansen made experiments with a model of his writing ball made out of porcelain. He tried out different placements of the letters on the keys, to work out the placement that led to the quickest <b>writing</b> <b>speed.</b> He ended up placing the most frequently used letters to be touched by the fastest writing fingers, and also placed most of the vowels to the left and the consonants to the right.
