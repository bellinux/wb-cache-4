There's a sort of wild streak in Bree somewhere that he thinks is really interesting." [...] To prepare for the role, Cake watched key episodes of the series focusing on Bree's previous relationships.|$|E

[...] SFX described Oswald's journey as one from a Hannibal Lecter type character to a Billy Graham or messianic figure. Pullman observed that Oswald's failure to die [...] "becomes the pivot for a whole world that has changed"; feeling that his character was an intelligent one who knows he can provide a message people want to hear. Discussing Oswald's fall from grace, series writer Jane Espenson explains that [...] "humanity doesn't seize on heroes for the long–term", and that Oswald's descent from fame was a way to make his arc more realistic. Though Oswald dies helping the Torchwood team, Espenson remarked that [...] "we didn't want to outright redeem this horrible, horrible man" [...] commenting that his death is intended as [...] "redemption and comeuppance both." [...] The Independents Neela Debnath observed that whilst {{the character of}} Danes had [...] "become likeable in an odd-sort of way" [...] his last scenes [...] "reiterated just how despicable he was" [...] and that it was the right time for him to depart the cast.|$|E

And the Soviets were now beginning to feel it, and the genius of Reagan, although I don’t think they had a plan in doing this is he instinctively realized that one of the ways to go after the Soviets was indirect, and that is you go after their proxies, you go after their allies, you go after their clients, or even in Afghanistan you go after them directly. So that’s what I called the Reagan Doctrine, it <b>was</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> opposite of the Brezhnev Doctrine, which was whatever we control we keep.

But, it never was something I felt I was needing to defend or stick to, or that it represented me artistically." [...] Other changes to the art style from the shorts were dictated by animation director, Mike L. Mayfield. Weidenfeld stated that Mayfield [...] "was instrumental in turning Brad's original style into what we had the first season." [...] Among them were the addition of pupils which, according to Weidenfeld, some of Neely's fans were unhappy over. Neely states that [...] "I had a long run of drawing those Orphan Annie style of eyes. That worked well for print. But as soon as things move, the characters start to look like zombies." ...|$|E
