The 1925 season was the first season during which no riding {{mechanic}} was required in a car, as this rule was repealed in Europe after the death of Tom Barrett in previous year.

500|$|The {{following}} year, Ardai {{stated that}} [...] "Unlike many recent CD-ROM upgrades, {{which have been}} embarrassing and amateurish", the CD-ROM version [...] "has the stamp of quality all over it", with the added dialogue and sound effects [...] "like taking a silent film and {{turning it into a}} talkie ... It's hard to go back to reading text off a monitor after experiencing a game like this". He concluded that [...] "LucasArts has done an impeccable job ... a must-see". In 1992 the magazine named the title as one of the year's four best adventure games. Andy Nuttal of Amiga Format wrote, [...] "The puzzles are very <b>well</b> <b>thought-out,</b> with some exquisite, subtle elements that give you a real kick when you solve them." [...] He noted that the game is [...] "littered with elements that are genuinely funny". His sole complaint was about the game's linearity compared to Monkey Island 2; but he finished by saying, [...] "It's a minor point, anyway, and it shouldn't put you off buying what {{is one of the best}} Amiga adventures ever." [...] In 2008, Retro Gamer Magazine praised it as [...] "a masterful piece of storytelling, and a spellbinding adventure".|$|E
500|$|From {{the outset}} of the marriage, {{political}} members of the Rothschild family took an interest in Rosebery, and he was soon acclaimed as one of the rising hopes of the Liberal Party. As a hereditary peer, he already had a seat in the House of Lords and had made his maiden speech there on attaining his majority. But brilliant as he was, Rosebery tended to lethargy and boredom. Lord Granville in fact considered Rosebery's wife to be the more ambitious of the pair, and even advised her [...] "If you keep him up to the mark, [...] is sure to have his page in history." [...] The subtle driving of her often languid and lethargic husband to achieve his [...] "page in history" [...] was to become her [...] Rosebery's secretary Thomas Gilmour noted: [...] "She is thoroughly genuine and very tender and devoted to Lord Rosebery, {{it is easy to see}} that she is very proud of him, and she is a woman of considerable force of character and great energy, she may prove to be a powerful ally in his political career." [...] Rosebery was not a natural politician. He was an idealist who disliked the rancour of politics, in fact [...] "his innate dislike of politics was something Lady Rosebery always fought against." [...] However, he was a gifted orator, and this was an era when platform speaking was beginning to replace House of Commons debate. On a tour of America before his marriage, Rosebery had been impressed by the campaigning of prospective political candidates; in Britain little had changed in that respect since the hustings of the 18th century. He realised how an electorate could be swayed by a candidate touring his prospective constituency, aided by a <b>well</b> <b>thought-out</b> series of events, rallies and advertising, with the candidate's ideal and attractive family smiling by his side. Thus Lady Rosebery not only pushed and encouraged him behind the scenes but was now to become an encouraging and conspicuous figure by his side. In this way it could be said she was the first openly [...] "political wife" [...] in Britain.|$|E
2500|$|The IRA {{was banned}} {{once again in}} 1935, as were the Blueshirts. Moss Twomey was imprisoned, and was succeeded {{as chief of staff}} by Seán MacBride. De Valera's {{government}} increasingly followed a strict anti-IRA policy. In 1936 Vice-Admiral Henry Somerville was assassinated in his West Cork home by IRA gunmen for recruiting many local Irishmen, including IRA members and even a captain in the Drimoleague IRA company, into the British military which combined with other members immigrating to the UK for work had a notable effect on IRA manpower. The Gardaí described the assassination as [...] "a <b>well</b> and coolly <b>thought-out</b> outrage, well-planned and daringly executed”. Seán Russell became chief of staff in 1938, and set about preparations for a bombing campaign against Britain. In January 1939, the IRA Army Council declared war against Britain, and the Sabotage Campaign began a few days later.|$|R

Ben Croshaw of The Escapist gave similar praise, notably of the game's incentive for the player to be urgent, but critiqued the Wii U itself for not utilizing the touch screen as a means of individually selecting targets.
