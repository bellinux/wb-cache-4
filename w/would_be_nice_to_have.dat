We destroyed twenty-five perfectly good fighters. They <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> in museums now.|$|E
500|$|Every {{episode of}} Inside No. 9 {{features}} an ornamental hare somewhere on-screen. According to Pemberton, [...] "Because each episode is so wildly different {{there was nothing}} really linking them {{other than the fact}} they were all inside a Number Nine, I just thought it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> an object that you could hide and just have there on every set." [...] There is, however, no particular significance to the hare itself. The hare is visible in [...] "The Riddle of the Sphinx" [...] on a table in Squires's fireplace. However, there is also a [...] "second" [...] hare. While it is not visible in the partially completed crossword shown {{at the end of the}} episode, the crossword published in The Guardian contains a nina spelling ONELEPUS, Lepus being the generic name for hares.|$|E
500|$|Bob Mould of Hüsker Dü, one of Grohl's idols, {{was brought}} in to do vocals in a song Grohl {{conceived}} as a duet with him, [...] "Dear Rosemary". Mould also played guitar on the track, even though Vig's plans had him just singing. Grohl's and Smear's former Nirvana bandmate Krist Novoselic appeared in [...] "I Should Have Known" [...] as Grohl thought [...] "it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> him come down and share the experience" [...] and that the song would be enhanced by his bass and accordion-playing." [...] "Miss the Misery" [...] features Fee Waybill of The Tubes, a personal friend of Grohl who said that the frontman invited him because [...] "the background vocal sounded like him". Other guest musicians included three members of the expanded touring band, keyboardist Rami Jaffee, violinist Jessy Greene and percussionist Drew Hester.|$|E

6000|$|For {{some time}} past Mary's grave blue eyes had been fixed upon him. [...] "What {{have you been}} writing lately?" [...] she asked. It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a little {{literary}} conversation.|$|E
60|$|The girls indeed {{would gladly}} have gone forward at once, being really fond of Dorothy, and {{thinking}} that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> travel together, but their mother overruled this.|$|R
6000|$|EVE. But I {{should not}} like it. It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> new again; but my old skin would {{lie on the}} ground looking just like me; and Adam would see it shrivel up and-- ...|$|R
5000|$|... Former {{president}} Fidel Castro {{called the}} planned book burning [...] "a huge media show". After Jones called off the event, Castro said, [...] "It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> {{know what the}} FBI agents who visited him said 'to persuade him.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|The other matrons echoed Juanita. Carol {{was dismayed}} by the casualness of their cruelty, but she persisted. Miles had exclaimed to her, [...] "Jack Elder says maybe he'll come to the wedding! Gee, it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> Bea meet the Boss as a reg'lar married lady. Some day I'll be so well off that Bea can play with Mrs. Elder--and you! Watch us!" ...|$|E
60|$|Elizabeth {{returned}} to her room to dress. She was conscious of a feeling that nothing was quite perfect in this world. It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{a great deal of}} money, for she had a scheme in her mind which called for a large capital; but she was sorry that it could come to her only through the death of her uncle, of whom, despite his somewhat forbidding personality, she had always been fond. She was also sorry that a large sum of money was coming to Nutty at that particular point in his career, just when there seemed the hope that the simple life might pull him together. She knew Nutty too well {{not to be able to}} forecast his probable behaviour under the influence of a sudden restoration of wealth.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Miriam, [...] "because it is a secret; but it {{is nearly}} finished, and as I shall {{have to tell you}} about it very soon, I may as well do it now: I have been {{altering}} Judith Pacewalk's teaberry gown for Cicely. It was altered once for me, and that makes it all the harder to make it fit her now. I am not very good at that sort of thing, and so it has taken me a long time. I expected to have it ready for her when she came back from the wedding trip, but I could not do it. I shall finish it to-day, however, and to-morrow I am going to invest her with it. She is now the head of the house, and it is she who should wear the teaberry gown. Don't tell her, please, until to-morrow; I thought it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a little ceremony about it, and in that case I shall have to have some one to help me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Cause I don't {{think it}} <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> talk to God before strangers, Anne. Dora can say hers to Mrs. Lynde if she likes, but I won't. I'll wait till she's gone {{and then say}} 'em. Won't that be all right, Anne?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The nursery {{screen that}} you bought {{yesterday}} by my advice was decorated by Jessie and Kate Seaward, so I thought it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> {{let you see}} for yourself how sweet and `deserving' are the poor people whom you have befriended!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, now I {{have an idea}} it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> stay in the country. S'posin' you an' me {{go right}} off an' get a job on some farm. That would settle Skip in great shape, an' we'd have a mighty good time." ...|$|R
6000|$|While {{they were}} thus conversing, the Frogman joined them {{and looked down}} at the plain with his big eyes and seemed unusually thoughtful. In fact, the Frogman was {{thinking}} that he'd like to see more of the world. Here in the Yip Country he had become the most important creature of them all, and his importance was getting to be a little tame. It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> other people defer to him and ask his advice, and there seemed no reason so far as he could see why his fame should not spread throughout all Oz. He knew nothing of the rest of the world, but it was reasonable to believe that there were more people beyond the mountain where he now lived than there were Yips, and if he went among them he could surprise them with his display of wisdom and make them bow down to him as the Yips did. In other words, the Frogman was ambitious to become still greater than he was, which was impossible if he always remained upon this mountain. He wanted others to see his gorgeous clothes and listen to his solemn sayings, and here was an excuse for him to get away from the Yip Country. So he said to Cayke the Cookie Cook, [...] "I will go with you, my good woman," [...] which greatly pleased Cayke because she felt the Frogman could be of much assistance to her in her search.|$|E

5000|$|As {{has been}} {{mentioned}} elsewhere, this story is primarily a remake of the (now) lost movie, [...] "Charlie Chan Carries On," [...] (1931) starring Warner Oland. The story has been updated to include more Charlie, but it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the missing movie to compare against.|$|E
50|$|Enemy: Hughes, Langston - Being a slave {{was like}} a living hell, and this poem shares the {{expression}} of the writer of how it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> see the slave owners get what they deserve as the slave emerges from years of torment.|$|R
6000|$|Then {{the outlaw}} turned to her. [...] "I guess it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> waited on by a lady, {{and it might}} please Charley Leland when he hears of it. I'd like some coffee, and I see the pot here. Bring me the kettle." ...|$|R
5000|$|In Nautilus, Leonard Mlodinow {{writes of}} Isaac Newton, [...] "It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{able to say}} that this giant of intellect was an empathetic, {{agreeable}} man, but if he had any such tendencies he did a good job suppressing them and coming off as an arrogant misanthrope." ...|$|R
50|$|Geometrically speaking, {{these three}} {{properties}} make Lebesgue measure {{very nice to}} work with. When we consider an infinite-dimensional space such as an Lp space or the space of continuous paths in Euclidean space, it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a similarly nice measure to work with. Unfortunately, this is not possible.|$|E
50|$|It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> no {{uncertainty}} in case duration prediction. But, it is present. The problem {{is looking for}} a single number that is correct most of the time. You won't get accurate estimates by using historical case duration data. Rather, from the historical data you'll get an assessment of the uncertainty.|$|E
50|$|AEC and Leyland engines {{were those}} {{designed}} and built by the respective companies and were not badge engineered except for BUT badges.Six- and eight-cylinder Rolls Royce diesel engines were also used.The first post-war lightweight DMUs 1954-1969 are reputed to have had pre-war Leyland 8.6-litre horizontal diesel engines fitted. It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> this confirmed.|$|E
6000|$|... "We shall {{want some}} poets too," [...] he remarked. [...] "Not Gibbon; no; d'you {{happen to have}} Modern Love or John Donne? You see, I {{contemplate}} pauses when people get tired {{of looking at the}} view, and then it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> read something rather difficult aloud." ...|$|R
2500|$|It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> {{see them}} learn. I {{worked in a}} school and grew tired of hearing them speak of how it's wrong {{to point out the}} {{weaknesses}} in Darwin's theory because, [...] "even if it is weak, it's still the best theory out there." [...] (Shades of Dawkins anyone?)" ...|$|R
5000|$|Perhaps it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> {{name the}} {{meditation}} technique we are teaching worldwide as Jangama dhyana. Lord Shiva first {{appeared to me}} {{in the form of a}} Jangama Sage to impart the technique, and Jangama means 'Eternal Existence'; so Jangama dhyana would mean 'meditation on the Eternal Existence of the Self.' ...|$|R
5000|$|For Höller’s {{exhibition}} in 2011 at MACRO, he showed Double Carousel with Zöllner Stripes (2011). The pair of carousels anthropomorphically suggests a couple, [...] "I thought it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> two merry-go-rounds interacting {{as if they}} were in love or something. To bring people together and then further away ... It is romantic and tragic at the same time." ...|$|E
50|$|ZUN {{states that}} Perfect Cherry Blossom {{is not a}} very smart game, saying that since many new people are playing his games, it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> more fan service, but it is just more of the same. He says that this is on purpose, since doujin games gives him the freedom to create what he likes as opposed to game {{companies}} where the main goal is to attract new customers.|$|E
5000|$|... "Toddler": [...] "It {{was just}} like this little ditty that Ian did and we though {{it might be the}} {{beginning}} of 'White Electric' but we thought it was just this little kiss of just space in the album, and <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> placed strategically, and we didn't really have a name for it... yeah, we didn't have a title for it and I just thought 'Toddler' would be a really cute name for that track. laughs" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've {{no wish to}} urge you. There's {{hardly a}} joint in my body that doesn't ache." [...] He flung down his pack and {{stretched}} himself {{with an air of}} relief.

6000|$|... "Of {{course you}} are right, dear," [...] Mrs. Withers said, rising from her seat and going over and kissing her husband tenderly. [...] "I had not thought of it in that light at all.

2500|$|... "Mad Head Love" [...] {{was written}} about Yonezu's {{feelings}} when composing music, {{and gave the}} song a theme of [...] "communication friction." [...] As he always composes alone, he wrote about how it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> connect with another person, even negatively. The lyrics depict love between two people, {{as well as their}} clashing opinions.|$|R
