40|$|Introduction: A <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> is {{undertaken}} before exercise {{to prepare the}} body for performance, reduce injury and improve performance[1]. Despite evidence suggesting that low intensity static-based <b>warm</b> <b>ups</b> are detrimental to performance[2] they are often included in pre-game <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> routines. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine whether a dynamic-based <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> of shorter duration and higher intensity (DSH) was more effective at preparing elite rugby league players for performance than a <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> that included combined static and dynamic activities of longer duration and lower intensity (Cll). It was hypothesised that the DSH <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> would be superior to the Cll <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> with respect to physical performance measures and player perceptions of readiness to perform. Methods: Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects with testing approved by the JCU research Ethics committee. Elite rugby league players (n= 28) completed the DSH and Cll <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> routines in random order, separated by 7 days. Following each <b>warm</b> <b>up,</b> players completed vertical jump and 40 m sprint. Player and coach perceptions of the <b>warm</b> <b>ups</b> and readiness to play or train were determined by questionnaires and interviews. Paired samples T -tests were used to identify significant differences between <b>warm</b> <b>ups</b> (p < 0. 05). Results: Players reported no significant differences between <b>warm</b> <b>ups</b> for preparedness to perform vertical jump (DSH: 6. 3 ± 1. 3 vs Cll: 6. 0 ± 1. 0, P = 0. 25) or 40 m sprint (DSH: 6. 3 ± 1. 8 vs Cll: 6. 3 ± 1. 7, P = 0. 917). Senior players and coaching staff rated the DSH <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> as significantly better than the Cll <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> (DSH: 7. 6 ± 1. 3 vs Cll: 6. 0 ± 1. 1, P = 0. 019) after using the DSH <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> in three preseason trial games. ConclusionlDiscussion: The dynamic <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> resulted in significantly faster 40 m sprint times and higher perception of readiness to perform in games compared to the combined <b>warm</b> <b>up.</b> The vertical jump result of no difference between <b>warm</b> <b>ups</b> contrasted available research[3] however this may be due to the dynamic component of the Cll <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> mitigating the detrimental effects of the static component[4]. The players' higher rating of the DSH <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> indicate that the DSH <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> should be used in preference to the Cll <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> as it elicits enhanced sprint performance and psychological preparedness to compete...|$|R

5|$|In {{the early}} spring, the queen {{comes out of}} {{diapause}} and finds a suitable place to create her colony. Then she builds wax cells in which to lay her eggs which were fertilised the previous year. The eggs that hatch develop into female workers, and in time, the queen populates the colony, with workers feeding the young and performing other duties similar to honeybee workers. In temperate zones, young queens (gynes) leave the nest in the autumn and mate, often more than once, with males (drones) that are forcibly driven out of the colony. The drones and workers die as the weather turns colder; the young queens feed intensively to build up stores of fat for the winter. They survive in a resting state (diapause), generally below ground, until the weather <b>warms</b> <b>up</b> in the spring with the early bumblebee being the species that is {{among the first to}} emerge. Many species of bumblebee follow this general trend within the year. Bombus pensylvanicus is a species that follows this type of colony cycle. For this species the cycle begins in February, reproduction starts in July or August, and ends in the winter months. The queen remains in hibernation until spring of the following year in order to optimize conditions to search for a nest.|$|E

40|$|Despite limited {{scientific}} evidence supporting their effectiveness, warm-up routines prior to exercise are a well-accepted practice. The {{majority of the}} effects of <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> have been attributed to temperature-related mechanisms (e. g. decreased stiffness, increased nerve-conduction rate, altered force-velocity relationship, increased anaerobic energy provision and increased thermoregulatory strain), although non-temperature-related mechanisms have also been proposed (e. g. effects of acidaemia, elevation of baseline oxygen consumption (V̇O 2) and increased postactivation potentiation). It has also been hypothesised that <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> may have a number of psychological effects (e. g. increased preparedness). Warm-up techniques can be broadly classified into two major categories: passive <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> or active <b>warm</b> <b>up.</b> Passive <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> involves raising muscle or core temperature by some external means, while active <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> utilises exercise. Passive heating allows one to obtain the increase in muscle or core temperature achieved by active <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> without depleting energy substrates.

40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{determine}} {{the importance of}} the duration and intensity of "warm up" exercise for reducing ischaemia during second exercise in patients with exertional angina.  DESIGN—Randomised crossover comparison of three <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> exercise protocols.  PATIENTS— 18 subjects with stable ischaemic heart disease and >  0. 1 mV ST segment depression on treadmill exercise testing.  INTERVENTIONS—The <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> protocols were 20  minutes of slow exercise at 2. 7  km/h, symptom limited graded exercise for a mean of 7. 4  (range 5. 0  to 10. 5) minutes, and three minutes of symptom limited fast exercise of similar maximum intensity.  MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES—ST segment depression during graded treadmill exercise undertaken 10  minutes after each <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> protocol or no <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> exercise.  RESULTS—Compared with exercise with no <b>warm</b> <b>up,</b> the duration of graded exercise after earlier slow <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> increased by 4. 9 % (95 % confidence interval (CI), − 3. 3 % to 13. 7 %), after graded <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> by 10. 3 % (95 % CI, 5. 6 % to 15. 2 %), and after fast <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> by 16 % (95 % CI, 6. 2 % to 26. 7 %). ST segment depression at equivalent submaximal exercise decreased after slow <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> by 27 % (95 % CI, 5 % to 44 %), after graded <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> by 31 % (95 % CI, 17 % to 44 %), and after fast <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> by 47 % (95 % CI, 27 % to 61 %).

40|$|Lack {{of benefit}} of <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> on {{prolonged}} intermittent-sprint performance {{has been proposed}} {{to be due to}} use of a pacing strategy by participants. To investigate this, twelve participants performed four cycle trials that consisted of either prolonged intermittent-sprint performance (80 min) or single-sprint performance (4 s), with or without a <b>warm</b> <b>up.</b> The first-sprint ofintermittent-sprint performance was also assessed. No interaction effects (P > 0. 05) were found between trials for intermittent-sprint performance for total work (J · kg− 1), or percentage work and power decrement. Work done during the first-sprint of intermittent-sprint performance (no <b>warm</b> <b>up)</b> was less (P < 0. 001) than the first-sprint of intermittent-sprint performance (warm up; effect size (ES) = 0. 59) and both single-sprint trials (<b>warm</b> <b>up</b> and no <b>warm</b> up; ES = 0. 91, 0. 75, respectively). Peak power (W · kg− 1) for single-sprint (<b>warm</b> <b>up)</b> was greater (P < 0. 05) than single-sprint (no <b>warm</b> <b>up),</b> and the first-sprint of intermittent-sprint performance (<b>warm</b> <b>up</b> and no <b>warm</b> <b>up).</b> <b>Warm</b> <b>up</b> improved single-sprint performance and the first sprint of intermittent-sprint performance.

25|$|The {{absence of}} {{mosquitoes}} from Iceland and similar regions is {{probably because of}} quirks of their climate, which differs in some respects from mainland regions. At {{the start of the}} uninterrupted continental winter of Greenland and the northern regions of Eurasia and America, the pupa enters diapause under the ice that covers sufficiently deep water. The imago ecloses only after the ice breaks in late spring. In Iceland however, the weather is less predictable. In mid-winter it frequently <b>warms</b> <b>up</b> suddenly, causing the ice to break, but then to freeze again after a few days. By that time the mosquitoes will have emerged from their pupae, but the new freeze sets in before they can complete their life cycle. Any anautogenous adult mosquito would need a host to supply a blood meal before it could lay viable eggs; it would need time to mate, mature the eggs and oviposit in suitable wetlands. These requirements would not be realistic in Iceland and in fact the absence of mosquitoes from such subpolar islands is in line with the islands' low biodiversity; Iceland has fewer than 1,500 described species of insects, many of them probably accidentally introduced by human agency. In Iceland most ectoparasitic insects live in sheltered conditions or actually on mammals; examples include lice, fleas and bedbugs, in whose living conditions freezing is no concern, and most of which were introduced inadvertently by humans.|$|E
