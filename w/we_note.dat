Further, <b>we</b> <b>note</b> that, for D = 4, the coupling is dimensionless and both {{the field and the}} square of the coupling have the same dimensions of the field and the coupling of a massless quartic scalar field theory. So, these theories share the scale invariance at the classical level.|$|E

30|$|<b>We</b> <b>noted</b> a {{variation}} in the mean voxel signal for 111 In-octreotide between livers due to different radiolabel pharmacokinetics, non-standard sensitivity of the gamma cameras, and different SPECT measurement times. In particular, <b>we</b> <b>noted</b> a marked difference for ThI when using our two gamma cameras; this introduced a 25  % difference in sensitivity for 111 In. A depressed sensitivity increased the ThI, which then had to be corrected using the adjusted nThI. This correction eliminated the variability of the camera and the duration of measurement.|$|R
