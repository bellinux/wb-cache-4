5|$|E.T. is an {{adventure}} {{game in which}} players control an alien (E.T.) from a top-down perspective. The objective {{of the game is}} to collect three pieces of an interplanetary telephone. The pieces are found scattered randomly throughout various pits (also referred to as wells). The player is provided with an on-screen energy bar, which decreases when E.T. performs any actions (including moving, teleporting, or falling into a pit, as well as levitating back to the top). To prevent this, E.T. can collect Reese's Pieces, which are used to restore his energy or, when nine are collected, E.T. can call Elliott to obtain a piece of the telephone, or the player can save the candy pieces for bonus points at the end. After the three phone pieces have been collected, the player must guide E.T. to an area where he can use the phone, which allows him to call his home planet. When the call is made, E.T. must reach the spaceship in a given time limit. Once E.T. gets to the forest where his ship abandoned him and stands and waits in the designated area for the ship to come, the ship will appear on screen and take him back to his home planet. Then the game starts over, with the same difficulty level, while changing the location of the telephone pieces. The score obtained during the round is carried over to the next iteration. The game ends when the energy bar depletes. E.T. has three lives and if he dies within those three lives Elliot <b>will</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> revive him. E.T. can get a fourth life if the player is lucky enough to find a geranium in one of the wells. It turns into a sprite from some games that Howard Scott Warshaw made, such as Raiders of the Lost Ark.|$|E
500|$|Forster's {{impressive}} performances for Celtic in the Champions League {{and involvement}} with the England international squad led to media reports in October and November 2013 that several clubs, including Manchester United and Manchester City, were considering {{to make a bid}} for the goalkeeper. In response to the press speculation, Celtic manager Neil Lennon commented, [...] "It's going to be impossible to keep Fraser, the way he's playing," [...] adding, [...] "Inevitably, I think a huge club <b>will</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> make a huge bid for him." ...|$|E
500|$|Erin Mullally {{was cast}} in the role and began filming {{immediately}} after Sorensen's departure from the production. In {{a statement from the}} press office at Five, they stated: [...] "As the character of Declan is extremely popular, and with some sensational storylines planned, it was decided that the character would be recast" [...] Sorensen expressed his delight that his character would continue {{as a part of the}} series saying: [...] "I'm really happy the character's going to continue because the producers and writers have given Declan some fantastic storylines. I'm really proud he's become as popular as he has." [...] At the time it was noted that recasts have occurred repeatedly throughout the history of the programme, creator of Neighbours, Reg Watson previously explained why he thought recasts were quintessential in the show saying: [...] "I always believed it was a pity, when actors chose to leave a serial that the character should go as well. A lot of time and money is invested in the character so we decided to recast if the character was important to the future of the storyline and the show itself." [...] It was this explanation that backed up Declan's recast. Sorensen also explained that the hand-over process would be simple adding: [...] "It'll be nothing over the top. I'm Declan one day and the next day it's Erin. Pretty simple. That's how it works, I can't continue, so Erin comes in and picks up the baton. I think it's easier for the viewers to accept when it's a simple change-over." [...] The recast had also upset fans of the character under the portrayal of Sorensen, in response to this he said: [...] "Erin <b>will</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> play his version of Declan, he can't play it exactly as I do and I and the producers would never expect him to do it any other way. All I can say to the Declan supporters is that Erin will be terrific, give him a go, you'll be surprised." ...|$|E

We'll give him talk for his money, and one by one all the boys <b>'ll</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> he'll have a nest of nine hundred mutineers to squat in an' give drink to.' ...|$|R

2500|$|One {{important}} event {{before and during}} the festival are lion dances. Dances are performed by both non-professional children's groups and trained professional groups. Lion dance groups perform on the streets, going to houses asking for permission to perform for them.

In return, the host gives lucky money to show their gratitude.|$|E
2500|$|In March 2002, Dershowitz {{published}} an article in The Jerusalem Post entitled [...] "New Response to Palestinian Terrorism." [...] In it, he wrote that Israel should announce a unilateral cessation in retaliation, {{at the end of}} which it would [...] "announce precisely what it will do in response to the next act of terrorism. For example, it could announce the first act of terrorism following the moratorium will result in the destruction of a small village which has been used as a base for terrorist operations. The residents would be given 24 hours to leave, and then troops <b>will</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> bulldoze all of the buildings." [...] The list of targets would be made public in advance. The proposal attracted criticism from within Harvard University and beyond. James Bamford argued in The Washington Post that it would violate international law. Norman Finkelstein wrote that [...] "it is hard to make out any difference between the policy Dershowitz advocates and the Nazi destruction of Lidice, for which he expresses abhorrenceâ€”except that Jews, not Germans, would be implementing it." ...|$|E
