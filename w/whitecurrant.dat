50|$|Redcurrant and <b>whitecurrant</b> {{fruit wines}} are {{beverages}} {{that are usually}} produced in northerly cool areas, where {{it is hard to}} grow high-quality grapes. They are simple to produce. Their natural chemical balances are such that they can be self-clarified without any additional substances. Redcurrants and whitecurrants contain only a small amount of carbohydrates; this necessitates the addition of sugar or honey.|$|E
50|$|The fruits {{typically}} used in summer pudding are raspberries, strawberries, blackcurrants, redcurrants, <b>whitecurrants,</b> and blackberries. Less commonly used aretayberries, loganberries, cherries and blueberries.|$|R
50|$|An {{order for}} the Kitchen Garden lists five {{espalier}} pear, six apple, one plum and two cherry varieties for the five foot high walls and twelve standard fruit trees for planting internally. In addition the Kitchen Garden contained gooseberries, blackcurrants, <b>whitecurrants,</b> redcurrants and raspberries.|$|R
5000|$|Buds {{affected}} by Cecidophyopsis ribis become swollen and globular {{and fail to}} develop normally. They are first noticeable in the autumn when they are unpointed and {{twice as large as}} normal buds. Inside the bud, between the closely folded leaves, are thousands of small, spherical eggs which later hatch into sausage-shaped mites with short legs near their anterior end. The mites suck sap from the buds and while they are doing so, can transmit the virus that causes blackcurrant reversion disease. The mites are 0.25 mm long. When mature they move out of the buds onto the twigs where they make their way to uninfested buds or may feed on the foliage later in the season causing distortion of the leaves. Crop yields are reduced {{as a result of the}} damage they do. The mites are so tiny that they can easily be blown or splashed onto other bushes or carried inadvertently by flying insects. They breed during the summer and autumn, laying their eggs inside new buds. They can also infest the buds of gooseberries, <b>whitecurrants</b> or redcurrants, but in these the affected buds die and [...] "big bud" [...] symptoms do not develop. These alternative host fruit bushes are not susceptible to blackcurrant reversion disease.|$|R
