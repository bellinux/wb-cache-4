25|$|Park also notched up {{some fine}} {{performances}} for Victoria, and soon earned a Test call-up in the 1920–1921 season. He was unsuccessful in his debut against England at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG), making a first-ball duck in his only innings, and bowling a single over of off-spinners which went for nine runs. He {{was said to}} have been called late during the night for medical duties, and not to have got any sleep before his debut. He never played Test cricket again.

500|$|After {{two days}} under guard at a {{temporary}} collection point, Mickl observed {{elements of the}} 15th Panzer Division travelling on the [...] Trigh Capuzzo (Capuzzo Track), returning from their sortie against {{the rear of the}} British assault. The prisoners of war were surrounded by a largely [...] "symbolic" [...] barbed wire fence, and in addition to the small guard force, the makeshift camp was surrounded by scattered British headquarters and logistic units. Mickl approached the officer in charge, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> the progress of the German tanks through binoculars, and knocked him to the ground. Seeing this, the German soldiers subdued the guards and took off on foot towards the nearby German column. Taking the keys to a vehicle, Mickl drove towards the distant German tanks to warn them of his approaching men. Rommel's staff were soon apprised of Mickl's actions by Crüwell. The British soon lifted the siege, and Mickl's regiment acted as rearguard during the withdrawal of Axis forces to El Agheila, where on 11 December, his previously 2,000-strong regiment could only muster seven officers and 492 men. During the withdrawal, his ally and friend Schraepler was killed in a vehicle accident.|$|E

The only performance by an outsider was a guitar part on [...] "X-Static" [...] provided by Greg Dulli of The Afghan Whigs, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> Grohl record the songs. Grohl eventually asked him if he wanted to play and handed him a guitar. Each song took about 45 minutes to be completed, and the compositions were recorded in the same order that became the album's track listing. The only song that required two run-throughs before completion was [...] "I'll Stick Around". Grohl was insecure about his singing, and added effects to his voice in [...] "Floaty", and tried to enhance the performance through double track – [...] "You know how people double their vocals to make them stronger?

500|$|On {{the day of}} the accident, Slotin's {{screwdriver}} slipped outward {{a fraction}} of an inch while he was lowering the top reflector, allowing the reflector to fall into place around the core. Instantly there was a flash of blue light and a wave of heat across Slotin's skin; the core had become supercritical, releasing an intense burst of neutron radiation estimated to have lasted about a half second. Slotin quickly twisted his wrist, flipping the top shell to the floor. The heating of the core and shells stopped the criticality within seconds of its initiation, while Slotin's reaction prevented a recurrence and ended the accident. The position of Slotin's body over the apparatus also shielded the others from much of the neutron radiation, but he received a lethal dose of [...] neutron and [...] gamma radiation in under a second and died nine days later from acute radiation poisoning. The nearest person to Slotin, Graves, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> over Slotin's shoulder and was thus partially shielded by him, received a high but non-lethal radiation dose. Graves was hospitalized for several weeks with severe radiation poisoning and developed chronic neurological and vision problems {{as a result of the}} exposure.

This heart attack may have been caused by hidden complications from radiation exposure, but its cause could also have been genetic, as his father had died from the same cause.|$|E
500|$|Washington, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> {{the battle}} {{from the other}} side of the river, sent a note to Magaw asking him to hold out until nightfall, {{thinking}} that the troops could be evacuated during the night. By this time, the Hessians had taken the ground between the fort and the Hudson River. Johann Rall was given the honor of requesting the American surrender by Knyphausen. [...] Rall sent Captain Hohenstein, who spoke English and French, under a flag of truce to call for the fort's surrender. Hohenstein met with Cadwalader, and Cadwalader requested that Magaw be given four hours to consult with his officers. [...] Hohenstein denied the request and gave the Americans a half hour to decide. As Magaw was consulting with his officers, Washington's messenger, Captain John Gooch arrived, just before the fort was completely surrounded, with Washington's request to hold out until nightfall. Magaw attempted to get easier terms for his men, who would only be allowed to keep their belongings, but this failed. Magaw announced his decision to capitulate at 3:00 pm, and at 4:00 pm, the American flag was brought down in the fort, replaced by the British flag. Before the surrender, John Gooch leaped off the side of the fort, tumbled to the bottom of the cliff, evaded musket fire and bayonet stabs, and managed to get onto a boat, arriving at Fort Lee a short while later.|$|E
500|$|In his encampment, Voldemort {{feels the}} Elder Wand is not {{performing}} as he expected. According to legend, its allegiance must be won by killing the previous owner, and Voldemort concludes—incorrectly—that as Snape killed Dumbledore, {{he will not}} be able to fully wield the wand's power until he kills Snape, which he does. Harry arrives as Snape is dying, and Snape passes him memories to view in a pensieve. They reveal Snape had a lifelong love for Harry's mother and felt haunted for causing her death, and despite hating Harry's father he agreed at Dumbledore's request to watch over Harry and act as a double agent against Voldemort. The doe Patronus that led Harry to the Sword was summoned by Snape, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> over them the whole time. It is revealed Dumbledore was slowly dying and his [...] "Murder" [...] was planned in advance to prove Snape's allegiance to Voldemort. The memories also explain Harry must die at Voldemort's hand if Voldemort is to be killed. Harry accepts his death and goes to the Forbidden Forest to allow Voldemort to kill him. On the way he mentions to Neville Longbottom that Voldemort's snake Nagini must be killed to make Voldemort vulnerable. He finally manages to open the Snitch and uses the Resurrection Stone within to seek comfort and courage from his dead loved ones—his parents, Sirius and Lupin—dropping the Stone in the forest before reaching Voldemort's camp. Voldemort uses the Killing Curse and Harry does not defend himself.|$|E

Near {{the beginning of the}} path, two farms were destroyed at high-end EF3 strength, a combine was tossed 1/4 of a mile and smashed to pieces, farm machinery and irrigation pivots were destroyed, along with trees and power lines. The tornado crossed into Edwards County, where additional farms were destroyed, one person was injured, and livestock was killed before the tornado dissipated south of Belpre. A third large EF3 wedge tornado developed north of Haviland, initially causing minor tree and irrigation pivot damage in Kiowa and Edwards Counties as it moved northeast. In Pratt County, this third tornado grew to over a mile wide, killing one person and injuring another as a farmhouse was swept away. Crossing into Stafford County, the tornado destroyed additional farms, killed livestock, and injured another person. One home in this area was swept completely away, and a vehicle was thrown 3/4 of a mile and mangled beyond recognition. The tornado then weakened and dissipated south of Macksville. Southeast of Macksville, yet another large EF3 wedge tornado developed and moved northeast.

500|$|In May 1937, Đujić gave {{a sermon}} {{in which he}} accused the Yugoslav {{government}} of being responsible for the poor working conditions of railroad workers in Dalmatia and western Bosnia. In particular, he criticised Niko Novaković-Longo, a deputy from Knin and minister without portfolio in Milan Stojadinović's government. In mid-May, Đujić led a massive strike between Bihać and Knin {{in which more than}} 10,000 disenchanted railroad workers participated. The Una–Butužnica railroad was one of eight being built in Yugoslavia by two French civil engineering companies, Société de Construction des Batignolles and Société Edmond Bayer de Agner. Đujić wished to minimize the influence that the communist-dominated United Workers Syndicate Union of Yugoslavia held over the work force in Dalmatia, and presented himself as a man out to defend the rights of workers throughout the country. The strike began on 15 May, on the Srb–Dugopolje road. After three days, it was broken up by the Yugoslav gendarmerie. Đujić then led the striking workers south to Vrpolje, where he attempted to negotiate a deal with the authorities. After negotiations broke down, Đujić led the workers north to Strmica, via Golubić and Pileći kuk. According to police records, he held a large rally at Pileći kuk and delivered a speech criticising the regency for its [...] "pro-Catholic, anti-Orthodox and anti-worker" [...] policies. An eyewitness reported that Đujić waved [...] "a red [...] flag and greeted followers with a clenched fist, all while being the leader of a Chetnik band." [...] In Knin, Đujić and the striking workers clashed with police. The police fired on the protesters, wounding three and killing a young girl <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> the clash. Đujić was subsequently arrested and spent ten days in prison for [...] "insulting His Majesty" [...] during the rally at Pileći kuk, which was attended by a crowd of over 800 people.|$|E
