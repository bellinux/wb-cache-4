5|$|After basic {{training}} in Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, Flanagan auditioned as a pianist for an army show. He got the role, which {{prevented him from}} {{being sent to the}} Korean War at that time; approximately a year later, however, he was sent to Kunsan, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> ongoing. There, he worked as a motion-picture-projector operator. After two years' service he was discharged and returned to Detroit, where he soon became pianist at the Blue Bird again. He again worked with Burrell, as well as Donald Byrd and Yusef Lateef, among others.|$|E

Shelby beat Slaughter soundly. Four years later, Slaughter was again elected as lieutenant governor, serving under George Madison.|$|E

5|$|Although the Second World War was raging at the time, Ward was {{not called}} {{up by the}} Army, and was allowed to {{complete}} his Bachelor of Arts degree in Engineering Science with first class honours, studying mathematics under J. H. C. Whitehead and E. C. Titchmarsh.

5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the war, Indiana was run by a Democratic and southern sympathetic majority in the state legislature. It was by the actions of Governor Oliver Morton, who illegally borrowed millions of dollars to finance the army, that Indiana could contribute so greatly to the war effort. Morton suppressed the state legislature {{with the help of the}} Republican minority to prevent it from assembling during 1861 and 1862. This prevented any chance the Democrats might have had to interfere <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> effort or to attempt to secede from the Union.|$|E

5|$|Details of Bonnet's {{military}} service are unclear, {{but he held}} the rank of major in the Barbados militia. The rank was probably due to his land holdings, since deterring slave revolts was an important function of the militia. Bonnet's militia service coincided <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>War</b> of the Spanish Succession, {{but there is no}} record that he took part in the fighting.|$|E
5|$|During World War I, in his {{capacity}} as chair of the New England Forestry Commission, Brown worked <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>War</b> Industries Board to send 10 sawmills abroad. The equipment went to Scotland to meet Britain's need for lumber. When the war effort in France subsequently required more than 73 million board feet of lumber per month, Brown was commissioned as a major to oversee sawmill operations there, but ultimately was not allowed to serve in France because of his poor vision, as he was partially blind in one eye.|$|E
5|$|During her training, {{she worked}} with the {{district}} nurses, visiting families in the Melbourne's less affluent suburbs.

Women of her own social class did not normally work after they married, so marriage was not something she had intended. In 1919, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> over, she wrote to Ned urging him to complete his Rhodes Scholarship studies before returning to Australia.|$|E

The area around the ski jumping hill saw heavy fighting during the civil war and was also used for executions by the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH). Since, the structures have been littered with bullet holes. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> the hills were no longer able to be used.|$|E
