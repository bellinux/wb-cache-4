It has a high conservation value because of its unique and special ecosystems. Marine tourism, such as diving, <b>water</b> <b>bicycle,</b> and wind surfing, is the most important touristic activity in this territory. The main mode of transportation between the islands are speed boats or small ferries.|$|E

When Ontario Place opened in 1971 {{the section of the}} exhibition he had designed called “Explosions” was the most successful exhibit in that first season. In consequence of this success he was appointed chief designer for the whole project. The following year (1972) saw the opening of the “Children’s Village” land play area and from that project grew his reputation as a designer of children’s play attractions. The opening of the “Water Play” area in 1973 secured that reputation. His work introduced ideas like the ball crawl (ball pit), net climb, punch bag forest, birdie glide, roller slide, cave crawl, together toys, foam swamp, <b>water</b> <b>bicycle</b> cannons, balancing buoys, rubber band bounce, and a whole range of interactive play elements.|$|E

After the war the area of the park was enlarged to 21 ha, and the Society of Jordan’s Gardens reestablished. New playing fields and sport venues were added, including a toboggan slide, amphitheatre, and bicycle tracks.

Studies mainly focus on compression, flexion and extension injuries mechanisms which appear during human body movement in saggital plane. The interaction with environment, the human body behaviour, inertial and external forces have a significant influence on type and scale of spine injuries. In order to analyse correlation between head movement and physical phenomena in the neck, two dimensional dynamical model was created using Working Model 2 D professional system. The model allows to analyse internal forces which appear insight human spine and body kinematics in saggital plane. Moreover created model {{could be used to}} analysing movement of diving man into shallow water.

40|$|Adaptive {{training}} {{requires the}} selection of an adaptive variable which is related to task d ig-culty, is quantifiable, and can be adjusted over a range commensurate with the trainee’s skill. The Effective Time Constant (t,) of the man-machine system is proposed as a suitable adaptive variable since it is based upon definable properties of the machine and the operator and {{has been shown to}} be related to task dificulty. The basic requirement for adaptive training systems is the need for automatically changing training task difficulty. In adapting the training task, difficulty is adjusted automatically to con-form to the measured level of the trainee’s skill. Those aspects of the trainer which will be adjusted in varying task difficulty, once they have been identified and described, are called here the adaptive variables in the adaptive trainer. This paper describes in some detail one aspect of man-machine systems which seems to be particularly well suited for use as an adaptive variable. It is a characteristic found in the con-trol of virtually every machine that man oper-ates-aircraft and spacecraft, automobiles, <b>water</b> craft-even the <b>bicycle.</b> This character-istic of man-machine systems may be called, more properly, a construct. The construct which is based upon definable properties of the ma-chine and of man, is called the eflective time constant (t,) of the man-machine system. Before discussing the effective time constant, the following criteria or requisites are proposed for an adaptive variable. 1. It must, of course, be capable of being described and quantified, i. e., measured. 2. I t must relate to task difficulty. That is, changes in the adaptive variable must brin...|$|R
40|$|Exercise under hypoxia {{and water}} {{immersion}} regulates pathways that {{are crucial to}} glucose and lipid metabolism. Hypoxia regulates the oxidative metabolism and water immersion results in release of the atrial natriuretic peptid (ANP) associated with increased lipid mobilization. We hypothesized that 1) endurance training under hypoxia results in similar or even greater metabolic improvement compared with exercise under normoxia and 2) exercise in water augments ANP-release associated with increased lipid mobilization and oxidation. We studied 20 normal- and 45 overweight subjects before and after a 4 week endurance training session either under normoxic (21 % FIO 2) or hypoxic (15 % FIO 2) conditions at the same relative intensity (65 % VO 2 max). Furthermore we investigated 17 subjects to their response of an incremental exercise test on land compared to exercise in <b>water</b> on a <b>bicycle</b> ergometer. Hypoxia training resulted in a greater reduction of body fat mass with no changes for fitness measurements. The glucose tolerance improved only in normal-weight subjects after hypoxia training compared to normoxic training. Importantly subjects in the hypoxia group trained at a significantly lower workload. Exercise under water immersion increased ANP release and attenuated catecholamine release. Glucose and lactate measurements were decreased whereas free fatty acid concentrations were increased with exercise in water. In conclusion endurance training in hypoxia over a 4 -wk period elicits a similar or even better response in terms of cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors than endurance exercise in normoxia. The fact that workload and, therefore, mechanic strain can be reduced in hypoxia could be particularly beneficial in obese patients and in patients with orthopaedic conditions. Even though water immersion blunts exercise-induced sympatho-adrenal activation, lipid mobilization and lipid oxidation rate are maintained or even improved. The response {{may be explained by}} augmented ANP release...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Although {{medical and}} travel plans {{gathered}} from pre-travel interviews {{are used to}} decide the provision of specific pre-travel health advice and vaccinations, {{there has been no}} evaluation of the relevance of this strategy. In a prospective study, we assessed the agreement between pre-travel plans and post-travel history and the effect on advice regarding the administration of vaccines and recommendations for malaria prevention. METHODS: We included prospectively all consenting adults who had not planned an organized tour. Pre- and post-travel information included questions on destination, itineraries, departure and return dates, access to bottled <b>water,</b> plan of <b>bicycle</b> ride, stays in a rural zone, and close contact with animals. The outcomes measured included: agreement between pre- and post-travel itineraries and activities; and the effect of these differences on pre-travel health recommendations, had the traveler gone to the actual versus intended destinations for actual versus intended duration and activities. RESULTS: Three hundred and sixty-five travelers were included in the survey, where 188 (52 %) were males (median age 38 years). In 81 (23 %) travelers, {{there was no difference between}} pre- and post-travel history. Disagreement between pre- and post-travel history were the highest for stays in rural zones or with local people (66 % of travelers), close contact with animals (33 %), and bicycle riding (21 %). According to post-travel history, 125 (35 %) travelers would have needed rabies vaccine and 9 (3 %) typhoid fever vaccine. Potential overprovision of vaccine was found in > 2 % of travelers. A change in the malaria prescription would have been recommended in 18 (5 %) travelers. CONCLUSIONS: Pre-travel history does not adequately reflect what travelers do. However, difference between recommendations for the actual versus intended travel plans was only clinically significant for the need for rabies vaccine. Particular attention during pre-travel health counseling should focus on the risk of rabies, the need to avoid close contact with animals and to seek care for post-exposure prophylaxis following an animal bite...|$|R
