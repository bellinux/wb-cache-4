In the Guinean pre-forest savannas of Ivory Coast, rural people consume many <b>wild</b> edible <b>fruits.</b> There is a significant trade of some <b>wild</b> <b>fruits,</b> {{but most of them}} are eaten raw at gathering sites. While a small number of fruit species are selected when clearing land for cultivation, the majority of them are destroyed and replaced by economic crops. From an ethnobotanical approach consisting in ""open-ended"" and semi-structured interviews, 75 <b>wild</b> edible <b>fruit</b> species, known by the Malinke ethnic group of Seguela (a department in the northwest of the Ivory Coast), were inventoried. Among them, about 55 <b>wild</b> <b>fruits</b> were particularly investigated and were classified according to their importance for local peoples. Several fruit categories were identified going from the ones that are well known and regularly eaten to those that are unknown and not used.

25|$|During {{the last}} week of June, Sam Brannan, leader of the Mormon {{emigrant}} ship Brooklyn, met the company near Green River, Wyoming. He reported to Young about his group's successful journey and their settlement in what is today San Francisco, California. He urged the vanguard company to continue on to California but was unable to shift the leader’s focus away from the Great Basin. Young also met mountain man Jim Bridger on June 28. They discussed possible routes into the Salt Lake Valley, and the feasibility of viable settlements in the mountain valleys of the Great Basin. Bridger was enthusiastic about settlement near Utah Lake, reporting fish, <b>wild</b> <b>fruit,</b> timber and good grazing. He told Young that local Indians raised good crops, including corn and pumpkins, but that there was ever-present danger of frost. The company pushed on through South Pass, rafted across the Green River and arrived at Fort Bridger on July 7. About the same time, they were joined by thirteen more members of the sick detachment of the Mormon Battalion.|$|E
25|$|The wines of Washington State {{are often}} {{characterized}} by their bright fruit flavors and crisp acidity. In recent years, the state's red wines have leaned towards riper, more fruit forward flavors, noticeable tannins and oak influence with moderately high alcohol levels. Wine experts such as Jancis Robinson and Hugh Johnson have described quality examples of Washington wines to exhibit fresh acidity, deep coloring, with bright, intense fruit flavors that can usually {{age in the}} bottle for at least 8 years before the fruit structure starts to fade. Karen MacNeil notes that the red wines of Washington, especially the Cabernets and Merlots, often exhibited lush texture with very concentrated berry flavors reminiscent of the <b>wild</b> <b>fruit</b> found in the Pacific Northwest such as blackberries, boysenberries, cherries and raspberries. The state {{is often described as}} combining New World fruit with Old World style. Paul Gregutt, wine writer for The Seattle Times and Wine Enthusiast describes Washington wines as maintaining strong purity and typicity of varietal flavors with firm, ripe tannins and bright acidity. Gregutt says Washington wines have the potential to combine the structure and polish of French wines with the ripeness and fruit of California wines.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{identify}} <b>wild</b> <b>fruits</b> possessing high nutraceutical potential, the antioxidant activities of 56 <b>wild</b> <b>fruits</b> from South China were systematically evaluated. The fat-soluble components were extracted with tetrahydrofuran, and the water-soluble ones were extracted with a 50 : 3. 7 : 46. 3 (v/v) methanol-acetic acid-water mixture. The antioxidant capacities of the extracts were evaluated using the ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) and Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) assays, and their total phenolic contents were measured by the Folin-Ciocalteu method. Most of these <b>wild</b> <b>fruits</b> were analyzed {{for the first time}} for their antioxidant activities. Generally, these fruits had high antioxidant capacities and total phenolic contents. A significant correlation between the FRAP value and the TEAC value suggested that antioxidant components in these <b>wild</b> <b>fruits</b> were capable of reducing oxidants and scavenging free radicals. A high correlation between antioxidant capacity and total phenolic content indicated that phenolic compounds could be the main contributors to the measured antioxidant activity. The results showed that fruits of Eucalyptus robusta, Eurya nitida, Melastoma sanguineum, Melaleuca leucadendron, Lagerstroemia indica, Caryota mitis, Lagerstroemia speciosa and Gordonia axillaris possessed the highest antioxidant capacities and total phenolic contents among those tested, and could be potential rich sources of natural antioxidants and functional foods.

25|$|Extreme events, such as {{droughts}} and floods, are forecast {{to increase}} as climate change and global warming takes hold. Ranging from overnight floods to gradually worsening droughts, these will {{have a range of}} effects on the agricultural sector. By 2040, almost the entire Nile region, which once included large areas of irrigated agricultural land, is expected to become hot desert where cultivation is impossible due to water limitation. According to the Climate & Development Knowledge Network report Managing Climate Extremes and Disasters in the Agriculture Sectors: Lessons from the IPCC SREX Report, the effects will include changing productivity and livelihood patterns, economic losses, and effects on infrastructure, markets and food security. Food security in future will be linked to our ability to adapt agricultural systems to extreme events. For example, the Garifuna women in Honduras are helping to ensure food security locally by reviving and improving production of traditional root crops, building up traditional methods of soil conservation, carrying out training in organic composting and pesticide use and creating the first Garifuna farmers' market. Sixteen towns have worked together to establish tool and seed banks. Efforts to plant <b>wild</b> <b>fruit</b> trees along the coast are helping to prevent soil erosion.

2500|$|The {{first version}} was {{exhibited}} in the Paris Salon of 1859, the last in which Delacroix participated. The composition reinterprets ideas that Delacroix had previously used in decorative compositions such as The Massacre at Chios, Death of Sardanapalus and Entry of the Crusaders in Constantinople. At {{the time of its}} exhibition, the landscape with its mountains was [...] "universally" [...] praised, while the mare in the foreground was thought strange by some. Théophile Gautier, for example, admired the painting, but ironically called the mare la femelle du cheval de Troie ("the female of the trojan horse"). Maxime Du Camp was the author of the harshest criticism, calling the painting [...] "a spectacle of irremissible decadence" [...] and advising the painter [...] "to return to the literary works that he loves and to the music for which he was certainly born". Baudelaire, in his last Salon criticism, called the painting [...] "one of these amazing works" [...] and saying [...] "Delacroix knows the design and painting", and also wrote a long essay on the life of an exiled poet and also quoting Chateaubriand's epic Les Martyrs to evoke [...] "the landscape, its solitude, its calm charm". Zacharie Astruc, in his first Salon criticism, praised all the details in the picture: Ovid ("what noble elegance!"); the mare ("what color and air around it!"); the dog, which made him think about classical sculpture; the water ("a strange beauty"); and, above all, the landscape. In the catalog, by Delacroix himself, was written: [...] "Some examine him [...] with interest, others go home and offer <b>wild</b> <b>fruit</b> and mare's milk, etc., etc." ...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{conduct a}} survey {{on the common}} name/s, {{traditional}} uses and cultural importance of the edible <b>wild</b> <b>fruits</b> in different municipalities of Benguet, Cordillera administrative region. Methods: Interviews using questionnaires with barangay leaders and indigenous people were conducted with 176 key informants from June 2011 to July 2013. Results: A total of 36 fruit species were found in different municipalities of Benguet. These fruit species belong to 27 genera and 20 families. Among the 13 municipalities of Benguet, Kibungan has {{the highest number of}} species. There are many uses of <b>wild</b> <b>fruits</b> which ranged from food (snack/dessert/table food), forage (especially for birds, monkeys and wild animals such as cloud rat and grass eaters), offertory, processed/preserved (as jam, jellies, candies, juice and wine), condiment or ingredient (for cooking), source of dye or ink, decoration (to garnish food) and as medicine to common ailments or health problems. Based on the inventory and calculated cultural importance index, Garcinia binucao (balokok) belonging to Clusiaceae is the most abundant fruit, hence it is the commonly used fruit for various purposes such as food, forage, processing/preservation and condiment/ingredient; Vaccinium myrtoides (ayusip) for offerings and as source of dye/ink; Saurauia elegans (uyok) for decoration, and, Antidesma bunius (bugnay) for medicine.

40|$|Throughout history, {{harvesting}} of <b>fruit</b> {{from the}} <b>wild</b> {{has played a}} role in the livelihoods of people in South Africa. For the San, who lived in South Africa for thousands of years, <b>wild</b> <b>fruits</b> were a staple food during parts of the year (Fox & Norwood Young 1983). Among the Bantu people, who entered South Africa about two thousand years ago (Hammond-Tooke 1993), agriculture was the main way in which food was acquired, but they also collected food from the wild. Especially during times of hardship, when cattle herds were decimated or crops were destroyed, they relied on hunting and gathering of fruits and edible plants from the wild for survival (Shapera & Goodwin 1959; Stuart & Malcolm 1986; Bundy 1988). European people settling in South Africa learnt to use and appreciate <b>wild</b> <b>fruits</b> (van Dyk 1988). In the rural areas of the Southern African region, the utilization of <b>wild</b> <b>fruits</b> as a source of food has persisted, especially among black people (Walker 1989; Shackleton 1996; Rossiter, Pellegrin et al. 1997). There is increasing interest in the domestication and improvement of selected fruits, and their utilization as orchard crops, marula (Sclerocarya birrea subsp. caffra) being the prime example (Nerd et al. 1990; Holtzhausen, Swart & van Rensburg 1990; Nerd & Mizrahi 1993; Geldenhuys 2001; Taylor 2001; Barton 2001).
