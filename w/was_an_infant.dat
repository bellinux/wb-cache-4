Around the same time he developed a list of requirements for his future wife, that she should be subservient and pure but also able to discuss philosophy and live without frivolities.

5|$|Within {{the school}} there <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>infant</b> school for {{children}} under six, a primary school {{for children under}} ten, {{and there was a}} preparatory school that prepared children for college in six years.
