5|$|The airline was by September {{again in}} need of new capital. The {{contracts}} with Britannia ended on 1 November. While there was a high demand for 737-300 aircraft, aviation regulations hindered Norway Airlines from wet leaseing the aircraft (with full crew) and limited them to dry leaseing (<b>without</b> <b>crew),</b> which jeopardized the jobs of 86 employees. There were speculations in mid-October that Air Europe was planning to purchase Norway Airlines. Lyng had by then bought Ansett's share and held a 55-percent ownership. Norway Airlines announced on 25 October that they would lease both their aircraft to Air Europe on a five-year contract, one aircraft from November 1988 and one from March 1989. The airline would have to continue with ad-hoc charters for the one aircraft until March. The deal also involved that the United Kingdom-based International Leisure Group (ILG) would purchase a 33-percent share of Norway Airlines through a private placement of NOK25 million.|$|E

However, when, in 380 BCE, Evagoras himself came to Egypt to beg other aid, Hakor saw no need to continue supporting him and sent him back to Cyprus with merely some more money. Evagoras surrendered to Artaxerxes soon after, but Hakor promptly joined a short-lived alliance with Sparta and Glos, son of the Egyptian admiral Tamos, himself {{a supporter of the}} pretender Cyrus the Younger against Artaxerxes II. Hakor managed to get the Athenian general Chabrias into his service, but the Persian general Pharnabazus II lobbied on Athens in order to repatriate him.|$|E
