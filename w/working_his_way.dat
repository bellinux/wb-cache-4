However, {{with the help of}} art director Nigel, who lends her designer clothes, she gradually learns her responsibilities and begins to dress more stylishly to show her effort and commitment to the position. She also meets an attractive young writer, Christian Thompson, who offers to help her with her career. As she spends increasing amounts of time at Miranda's beck and call, problems arise in her relationships with her college friends and her live-in boyfriend, Nate, a chef <b>working</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> up the career ladder.|$|E

Saint Cyr had already withdrawn along the Danube, after his and Vandamme's assaults on the Austrian right failed, and was <b>working</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> west toward the Black Forest. Inexplicably, {{at least at the}} time, the Austrians failed to pursue the retreating French; instead of pursuing the French, Charles ordered his army into cantonments at Stockach and Engen, as far south as Wahlweiss. The Aulic Council, in establishing a plan of battle, had forbidden his approach to the Rhine until Switzerland was also cleared of the French army; Charles simply held his ground.|$|E

After graduating in the 1950s he started work in the 1970s and began his {{political}} career in local industry, <b>working</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> up through the hierarchy of Soviet industrial ministries. In 1979 Ryzhkov was appointed First Deputy Chairman of the State Planning Committee. Following Nikolai Tikhonov's resignation as Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Ryzhkov was voted into office in his place.

5|$|Born {{and raised}} in Brooklyn, New York, Zoldak began his {{professional}} career in the low-level minor leagues, <b>working</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> up despite being released from his first team. The St. Louis Browns acquired him in 1944 and placed him on their major league roster. He debuted on May 23, {{and spent the next}} four years as a spot starter, working both as a starting pitcher and relief pitcher. He was traded to the Cleveland Indians in 1948, and helped lead the team to the 1948 World Series.

His appearances in the first team gradually increased over the following five years and he made more than 150 for the club. He earned his first cap for the England national team in February 2007, despite his criticism of some of the team's players. He then joined Newcastle United for a fee of £5.8million in July 2007. After four years with the club, he joined Queens Park Rangers in August 2011, from where he was loaned to Marseille in 2012. He returned from his loan spell the following season, and helped QPR to promotion to the Premier League via the Championship play-offs.

In the first, which is crossed out in the original manuscript, Fanny tells Brown: “I was more generous ten years ago, I should not now endure the odium of being connected with one who was <b>working</b> up <b>his</b> <b>way</b> against poverty and every sort of abuse.” The second, which is not crossed out, reads: “I should be glad if you could disprove I was a very poor judge of character ten years ago and probably overrated every good quality he had but surely they go too far on the other side.” ...|$|R

5|$|Born in Lincoln, Nebraska, Cheney was {{primarily}} raised in Sumner, Nebraska, and Casper, Wyoming. He attended Yale {{and then the}} University of Wyoming, at the latter of which he earned a BA and an MA in Political Science. He began his political career as an intern for Congressman William A. Steiger, eventually <b>working</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> into the White House during the Nixon and Ford administrations, where he later served as the White House Chief of Staff, from 1975 to 1977. In 1978, Cheney {{was elected to the}} U.S. House of Representatives representing Wyoming's at-large congressional district from 1979 to 1989; he was reelected five times, briefly serving as House Minority Whip in 1989. Cheney was selected to be the Secretary of Defense during the Presidency of George H. W. Bush, holding the position for the majority of Bush's term from 1989 to 1993. During his time in the Department of Defense, Cheney oversaw the 1991 Operation Desert Storm, among other actions. Out of office during the Clinton administration, Cheney was the Chairman and CEO of Halliburton Company from 1995 to 2000.|$|E
5|$|During his {{ministry}} in Geneva, Calvin preached over two thousand sermons. Initially he preached twice on Sunday {{and three times}} during the week. This proved to be too heavy a burden and late in 1542 the council allowed him to preach only once on Sunday. In October 1549, he was again required to preach twice on Sundays and, in addition, every weekday of alternate weeks. His sermons lasted {{more than an hour}} and he did not use notes. An occasional secretary tried to record his sermons, but very little of his preaching was preserved before 1549. In that year, professional scribe Denis Raguenier, who had learned or developed a system of shorthand, was assigned to record all of Calvin's sermons. An analysis of his sermons by T.H.L.Parker suggests that Calvin was a consistent preacher and his style changed very little over the years. John Calvin was also known for his thorough manner of <b>working</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> through the Bible in consecutive sermons. From March 1555 to July 1556, Calvin delivered two hundred sermons on Deuteronomy.|$|E
5|$|On a team-basis, Malhotra's {{first season}} with the Canucks saw them earn the Presidents' Trophy for having the best regular season record in the league. In {{the midst of his}} recovery, Malhotra made an {{appearance}} during the team's pre-game ceremony at Rogers Arena, co-accepting the trophy with captain Henrik Sedin. Despite original statements from the team that he would not return for the playoffs, Malhotra began <b>working</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> up from light practices with the team in May 2011. By the end of the month, he was cleared by doctors to play in the Stanley Cup Finals. Though he remained out of the lineup for Game 1, he returned for the following contest and played the rest of the series as the team's fourth-line centre (late-season acquisition Maxim Lapierre filled in for Malhotra on the third line). Playing against the Boston Bruins, the Finals went to a seventh game, which the Canucks lost. Malhotra's regular season performance earned him six first-place votes out of 125 for the Selke Trophy. He ranked fifth in balloting, as teammate Ryan Kesler won the distinction at the year-end Awards Ceremony.|$|E

50|$|As a {{consequence}} {{and evolution of}} the previous expressions, Lars Physant {{is working with the}} concepts Contrapunctual realism and Multiversal realism, focusing on the visual perception itself. It is intended as a parallel expression in pure painting to that of Peter Greenaway within cinema and video art, which assumes the fragmentation and complexity of the 21st century as a challenge to artistic articulation. Contrapunctual realism refers partly to the influence from the Canadian pianist Glenn Gould’s <b>working</b> methods and <b>his</b> <b>way</b> of conceiving interpretation.|$|R
40|$|Consecutive {{interpretation}} requires {{quite a lot}} {{of intellectual}} and physical effort from the interpreter. One of the factors that makes interpretation rather difficult is the length of sections of the text that should be translated. Having acquired the special skill of taking notes, the interpreter makes his work easier and becomes more independent of the speaker's habit. The author shares <b>his</b> experience in <b>working</b> out <b>his</b> own <b>way</b> of taking notes, pointing out a certain need for “creative attitude” that has to be acquired by students on interpreting courses...|$|R

25|$|Borges imagines a Tlönite <b>working</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> out of {{the problem}} of solipsism by {{reasoning}} that if all people are actually aspects of one being, then perhaps the universe is consistent because that one being is consistent in his imagining.

6000|$|He {{determined}} {{to revisit the}} scene of the last evening's gambol, and if he met with any of the party, to demand his dog and gun. As he rose to walk, he found himself stiff in the joints, and wanting in his usual activity. [...] "These mountain beds do not agree with me," [...] thought Rip, [...] "and if this frolic, should lay me up with a fit of the rheumatism, I shall have a blessed time with Dame Van Winkle." [...] With some difficulty he got down into the glen: he found the gully up which he and his companion had ascended the preceding evening; but to his astonishment a mountain stream was now foaming down it, leaping from rock to rock, and filling the glen with babbling murmurs. He, however, made shift to scramble up its sides, <b>working</b> <b>his</b> toilsome <b>way</b> through thickets of birch, sassafras, and witch-hazel; and sometimes tripped up or entangled by the wild grape vines that twisted their coils and tendrils from tree to tree, and spread a kind of network in his path.|$|R

United States athletic officials were furious and withdrew his amateur status, which immediately ended his career. Owens was angry, saying, [...] "A fellow desires something for himself." [...] Owens argued that the racial discrimination he had faced throughout his athletic career, such as not being eligible for scholarships in college and therefore being unable to take classes between training and <b>working</b> to pay <b>his</b> <b>way,</b> meant he had to give up on amateur athletics in pursuit of financial gain elsewhere.|$|R
2500|$|The {{dress of}} the rodeo cowboy {{is not very}} {{different}} from that of the <b>working</b> cowboy on <b>his</b> <b>way</b> to town. Snaps, used in lieu of buttons on the cowboy's shirt, allowed the cowboy to escape from a shirt snagged by the horns of steer or bull. Styles were often adapted from the early movie industry for the rodeo. Some rodeo competitors, particularly women, add sequins, colors, silver and long fringes to their clothing in both a nod to tradition and showmanship. Modern riders in [...] "rough stock" [...] events such as saddle bronc or bull riding may add safety equipment such as kevlar vests or a neck brace, but use of safety helmets in lieu of the cowboy hat is yet to be accepted, in spite of constant risk of injury.|$|R
