5|$|Following its brief {{theatrical}} run, Universal Studios quickly {{sold the}} film's rights to cable companies, allowing Tender Mercies {{to be shown}} on television. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>film</b> unexpectedly received five Academy Award nominations nearly a year after its original release, the studio attempted to redistribute the film to theaters; however, the cable companies began televising the film about {{a week before the}} Oscar ceremony, which essentially halted any attempts at a theatrical rerelease. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>film</b> first played on HBO in March 1984, it surpassed the three major networks in ratings for homes with cable televisions. Tender Mercies was released on VHS some time later, and was first released on DVD on June 22, 1999.|$|E
5|$|The film {{features}} an {{extensive use of}} Eurostile Bold Extended, Futura and other sans serif typefaces as design elements of the 2001 world.

5|$|The film is now {{considered}} lost. It is unknown <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>film</b> was lost, {{but if it was}} in Universal's vaults it would have been deliberately destroyed along with the remaining copies of Universal's silent era films in 1948.|$|E
5|$|According to 20th Century Fox accounts, however, by April 1980 <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>film</b> {{had earned}} a {{reported}} $100million at the box office, after advertising, distribution fees, penalties and other costs were deducted, it was still recorded as having 'lost' $2.4million. This {{was seen as an}} example of Hollywood creative accounting and was much criticised. However, by August, Fox had started saying the film made $4 million in profit.|$|E
5|$|Bakshi had {{selected}} {{a number of}} songs from his own record collection for the film's soundtrack, which were not used in the film due to {{the high costs of}} licensing the songs. The film was initially scored by singer Dan Hicks, who became involved with the production of the film in 1974. Because of the delay of the film's release, Hicks' label released the material from these sessions under the title It Happened One Bite. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>film</b> was released in 1982, it had been rescored by John Madara.|$|E

5|$|Columbia Pictures {{had planned}} to produce a film {{adaptation}} of Barris's memoir {{of the same name}} in the late 1980s. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>film</b> rights were purchased by producer Andrew Lazar, Kaufman was commissioned to write a new script, which attracted various A-list actors and filmmakers to the project. Bryan Singer at one point planned to direct the film with Johnny Depp in the lead role, but the production was canceled. The production resumed when Clooney took over directing duties.|$|E
5|$|Development for {{the film}} started in 1980, but did not {{progress}} until 1997, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>film</b> rights to Abagnale's book were sold to Spielberg's DreamWorks. David Fincher, Gore Verbinski, Lasse Hallström, Miloš Forman, and Cameron Crowe had all been possible candidates for director before Spielberg decided to direct. Filming took place from February to May 2002. The film was a financial and critical success, and was received positively by Abagnale.|$|E
5|$|In February 2011 Elba, {{known at}} the time for playing Stringer Bell in The Wire, {{reportedly}} joined the cast of Prometheus in an undisclosed role. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>film</b> was released he described Janek's background, and the character's career as a longshoreman and sailor motivate him to maintain the well-being of his crew. Roger Ebert praised Elba's performance, calling Janek's evolution the most interesting in the film.|$|E
50|$|In 2014 Mantle {{starred in}} Confessions of a Womanizer with Gary Busey. <b>The</b> <b>film</b> was {{released}} in 2016.

50|$|A caption at the {{beginning}} of the Rohauer Collection print of <b>the</b> <b>film</b> states that <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>film's</b> negative was rediscovered in 1954 it was so badly decomposed as to be considered unsalvageable.

5|$|In {{addition}} to their appearance in the film, Green Day recorded {{its own version of}} the Simpsons theme, and released it as a single. Zimmer turned the Spider-Pig song into a choral piece, which was a joke he never intended to be put into the film. Zimmer also had to write foreign-language lyrics for the 32 dubbed versions of the song <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>film</b> was released internationally. He found translating the song into Spanish the hardest to write. The same choir learned to sing the piece for each of the foreign-language dubs.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the special}} edition's footage was first seen <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>film</b> made its {{broadcast}} television debut on CBS in 1989, but two additional sequences concerning Burke's transmission to the colony about the derelict, and the Jorden family's subsequent discovery of the same, {{were added to the}} initial Laserdisc release. According to Cameron, the visual effects for the scene were incomplete, so {{he went back to the}} Skotak brothers and had them finish the sequences. All currently available versions {{of the special}} edition contain these scenes.|$|E
5|$|Paramount {{originally}} planned {{to produce the}} film in 1931 and sent cinematographers Ernest B. Schoedsack and Rex Wimpy to India to film location shots such as a tiger hunt. However, much of the film stock deteriorated {{in the hot sun}} while on location, so <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>film</b> was eventually made, much of the production took place in the hills surrounding Los Angeles, where Paiute Native Americans were used as extras.|$|E

50|$|During <b>the</b> late 1960s, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>films</b> of 1930s comedians {{such as the}} Marx Brothers, W. C.

5|$|The 56th Academy Award {{nominations}} {{were announced}} about ten months after Tender Mercies was released. Little {{had been done}} to promote its candidacy: only four Oscar campaign advertisements were purchased; all of them appeared in the trade journal Variety, and Duvall had declined to campaign for himself or the film. Beresford and studio executives were surprised <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>film</b> was nominated for five Academy Awards, including Best Picture. Harper was believed by some to be a strong contender for either Best Actress or Best Supporting Actress, but ultimately she was nominated in neither category.|$|E
5|$|<b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>film</b> was released, Landis, Widdoes and Allen {{went on a}} {{national}} promotional tour. Universal Pictures spent about $4.5 million promoting the film at selected college campuses and helped students organize their own toga parties. One such party at the University of Maryland attracted some 2,000 people, while students at the University of Wisconsin–Madison tried for a crowd of 10,000 people and {{a place in the}} Guinness Book of World Records. Thanks to the film, toga parties became one of the favorite college campus happenings during 1978 and 1979.|$|E
5000|$|In February 2014, it was {{announced}} that <b>the</b> <b>film</b> had been postponed and that no date has been set for <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>filming</b> was to begin.

5|$|Yahoo!

5|$|As {{predicted}} {{through the}} actions of the boys in the film, there were numerous news reports of underage South Park fans engaging in unsuccessful attempts to gain entrance to the film at theaters. There were reports of adolescents purchasing tickets for WB's own Wild Wild West and instead sitting in to see South Park. This came {{as a result of a}} movie-industry crackdown that would make it tougher for children to sneak into R-rated films, as proposed by President Bill Clinton at the time in response to the moral panic generated by the Columbine High School massacre, which occurred two months before the film's release. South Park was cited, along with American Pie, as an explicit film released in the summer of 1999 tempting teens to sneak into theaters. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>film</b> was released in the United Kingdom in August 1999, there were similar reports of the film drawing an underage crowd.|$|E
5|$|Controversy arose {{regarding}} the artwork {{for the cover}} for the Classics VHS cassette <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>film</b> was first released on video when close examination of the artwork revealed an oddly shaped structure on the castle, closely resembling a human penis. Disney and the cover designer insist it was an accident, resulting from a late night rush job to finish the cover artwork. The questionable object does not appear {{on the cover of}} the second releasing of the movie. A second allegation is that a clergyman is seen with an erection during a scene late in the film. The clergyman is a short man, dressed in Bishop's clothing, and a small bulge is slightly noticeable in a few of the frames that are actually later shown to be the stubby-legged man's knees, but the image is small and is very difficult to distinguish. The combined incidents led an Arkansas woman to file suit against The Walt Disney Company in 1995, though she dropped the suit two months later.|$|E
5000|$|<b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>film's</b> {{production}} wrapped up, Kevin S. Tenny {{was worried}} {{trying to make}} sure that the characters were real and whether he had made <b>the</b> <b>film</b> [...] "scary" [...] when it was screened by the distributors. Geoffray, in contrast, felt confident in <b>the</b> <b>film</b> and they managed to screen <b>the</b> <b>film</b> a lot before it reached full theatrical release.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{project was}} <b>filmed</b> as Lame Ducks; however, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>film's</b> {{producers}} (David and Jerry Zucker) left for another studio, Paramount scrapped the publicity campaign, changed the title, and withdrew <b>the</b> <b>film</b> after its initial screenings.
