40|$|The recent {{advancement}} in computer-integrated manufacturing related technologies (e. g. internet of things, {{information technology and}} service-oriented architecture) has prompted {{the need for a}} novel effective, efficient and economical automatic identification and data collection solution for manufacturing scenario. Accurate and timely manufacturing front line information is essential to guarantee the functions and performance of enterprise information systems (EISs) deployed, and is the basis of entire information flow in enterprise. Both researchers and commercial players have made great contributions to the fields of enterprise information systems and data capturing technologies. However, real-time data processing and on-line knowledge support to seamlessly link up the EISs and shop floor front-line operations are still open to discuss. This research discusses an overall solution for manufacturing real-time field data capturing, processing and disseminating strategy in ubiquitous manufacturing environment, named Ubiquitous Manufacturing Platform (UMP). This research discusses the design and development of UMP, which is an innovative framework to integrate Auto-ID hardware devices and software services for facilitating manufacturing shop floor production management. The proposed event-driven UMP aims to enable shop floor real-time visibility and traceability, and bridge the gap between frontline operations and management level activities (e. g. planning and scheduling). On one hand, production management objectives are fulfilled through defined and configured services, and eventually carried out at shop floor operating sites with managed Auto-ID devices. On the other hand, the generated shop floor real-time field data is captured as events, which are then processed and aggregated to leveled meaningful information to satisfy various information requirements for different roles in an enterprise. UMP is expected to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of production supervision and decision making, and to reduce the production disturbances. This research has made the following achievements and contributions. Firstly, a scalable and reconfigurable infrastructure for manufacturing real-time field data capturing, processing and disseminating, named UMP, is developed based on several core technologies to achieve seamless dual-way connectivity and interoperability among enterprise application systems, shop floor, production line and <b>workstation</b> <b>levels.</b> Secondly, an innovative information processing mechanism, namely critical event model, is designed to connect the real-time field data in manufacturing processes to implied business context information. Based on this model, real-time field data is able to be organized in various abstract levels, so as to be useful for making adaptive enterprise decisions. Thirdly, a lightweight devices middleware solution named Gateway Operating System (GOS), is designed and proposed to support UMP. GOS enables a unified system interface for manufacturing companies to deploy and manage their heterogeneous Auto-ID devices. Furthermore, it allows multiple back-end manufacturing applications to share the same Auto-ID infrastructure, and shields the application systems from the implementation detail of enabling hardware devices. Fourthly, the gateway event processing procedure is presented to implement the engine for shop floor real-time field data capturing, processing and disseminating. Based on the Auto-ID infrastructure, it combines the concept of event and software agents into workflow management to realize real-time reconfigurable ubiquitous manufacturing. published_or_final_versionIndustrial and Manufacturing Systems EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E

40|$|In {{an effort}} to {{maintain}} or increase their market share {{and at the same}} time prevent costs from escalating, manufacturing organisations are increasingly using their current manufacturing system to produce custom output. As a consequence, the large number of product variants increases significantly the complexity of manufacturing systems, both for the operators as for the support services. This is especially true in automotive industry, where customisation is increasing at a rapid pace. To counter the ensuing loss of productivity, a more fundamental approach to dealing with this complexity in manufacturing processes is required. In order to investigate the impact of complexity on production performance, one must first delineate the concept and then identify as unambiguously as possible highly complex workstations. This article defines complexity at the <b>workstation</b> <b>level</b> and proposes a complexity measure for mixed-model assembly workstations. Based on data from several leading automotive companies from Belgium and Sweden, some statistical models are proposed to characterise workstations complexity.

The first study focused on open-plan offices in nine conventional buildings, whereas the second encompassed open-plan and private offices in 24 buildings (12 green and 12 conventional). The data collection for these studies was separated by approximately a decade, but the data collection methods, contexts and analysis procedures were very similar. This offered the opportunity to compare the results of the studies at the <b>workstation</b> <b>level,</b> with the goal of identifying parameters consistent in affecting occupant satisfaction, and of exploring the effects of office type (open-plan versus private) and building type (green versus conventional). Satisfaction with acoustics and privacy was most strongly affected by workstation size and office type; satisfaction with lighting was most strongly affected by window access and glare conditions; and satisfaction with ventilation and temperature was most strongly affected by pollutant concentration.

This project aims to investigate micro climate air conditioning as an alternative to conditioning the entire space in order to provide a more efficient system to be implemented in typical office workspaces. Conventional air conditioning systems typically are based on supplying conditioned air at low velocity from ceiling mounted registers. The basis for a micro climate system is to provide low air quantities at a higher velocity and slightly higher temperature locally at the <b>workstation</b> <b>level.</b> Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) computer programs provide a predictive tool to simulate the resultant thermal output from an air conditioning system. The effectiveness of a micro climate system was tested in a typical open plan office workstation. Phoenics CFD software was used to provide results on the expected thermal gradients in the space which was then compared against the data compiled from two data loggers located both at the workstation and the ceiling level. Reasonable correlations between the CFD analysis and the data loggers output were achieved. A number of assumptions were made in order to develop the CFD model, which appear to have been substantiated particularly for the summer conditions. A number of variables were changed to improve the performance of the system; some of these were immediately implemented with favourable results...|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. The methodology of developing an NC equipment controller in a Computer Integrated Manufacturing (CIM) System, which is based on a philosophy of hierarchical shop floor control, is presented in this research. The underlying architecture consists of three levels of control: shop <b>level</b> control, <b>workstation</b> <b>level</b> control and equipment level control. The focus of the research is on developing functionality and structure of an equipment controller. The equipment level controller (ELC) performs three basic functions: planning, scheduling and execution. The ELC first modifies machining parameters of tasks assigned by its superior workstation controller for local cutting conditions, then incorporates separated tasks so as to generate the tool path between two adjacent tasks; then it selects the required tasks from alternate tasks and decides on a sequence for each part; then it converts CLDATA file into machine-specific NC codes. The equipment controller then searches for an operation sequence of tasks for multiple parts by which the equipment can efficiently process these tasks. Finally, the equipment controller executes all the tasks based on a control logic that dictates the sequential control of task execution. This equipment level controller can provide operational flexibility and improve the machine level performance, and the establishment of it acts as a first step toward a highly automated, integrated manufacturing system...|$|R

The {{purpose of this}} study was 1) to develop an explanatory model showing simultaneous relationships among occupants' satisfaction with indoor environmental quality (IEQ) criteria at the <b>workstation</b> <b>level,</b> their satisfaction with the overall facility (i. e., site, building, and interior), their overall work performance, and their sustainability ethic in sustainable buildings; 2) to test the developed model and suggest a good-fit model; and 3) to estimate the hypothesized relationships among variables. Secondary data analysis was used to examine the {{purpose of this study}}. The data were obtained from the B 3 Sustainable Post-Occupancy Evaluation Survey database hosted by the Center for Sustainable Building Research at the University of Minnesota. Data were collected from three sustainable buildings, all located in Minnesota and a total of 289 respondents were used for data analysis. Exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis provided support for a good-fit five-factor model, including furnishings, thermal conditions, view conditions, lighting conditions, and acoustics and privacy conditions, related to occupants' satisfaction with sustainable IEQ criteria. Path analysis was used to examine simultaneous relationships among independent and dependent variables. Satisfaction with thermal conditions did not significantly influence both satisfaction with overall facility and overall work performance. The only significant relationships were between satisfaction with furnishings and acoustics and privacy conditions and overall work performance. There were significant relationships among satisfaction with overall facility, overall work performance, and sustainability ethic. The importance of this study is that the findings extended the scope of the research through the development of a hypothesized model, extraction of IEQ factors, and as a test for a good-fit model showing the simultaneous relationships among variables. Most importantly, this study found that there is a connection between occupants' sustainability ethic and their satisfaction and work performance. Therefore, in the future research, a revised model showing a continuous process among all variables can be suggested and tested with much larger sample size. In addition, five IEQ factors, derived from various IEQ attributes addressed in B 3 -SPOES questionnaire, can be used for newly development of occupant survey questionnaire that has reliability and validity...|$|R

The students were assigned to study either on the stationary bike or at a traditional desk located in the campus library for a minimum of 2 h a week. During the 10 weeks, the students studied for tests or worked on other required academic activities while working at their assigned desk.

40|$|The Bechtel Waste Treatment Project (WTP), {{located in}} Richland, WA, is {{comprised}} of many processes containing complex physics. Accurate analyses of the underlying physics of these processes is needed {{to reduce the amount}} of added costs during and after construction that are due to unknown process behavior. The WTP will have tight operating margins in order to complete the treatment of the waste on schedule. The combination of tight operating constraints coupled with complex physical processes requires analysis methods that are more accurate than traditional approaches. This study is focused specifically on multidimensional computer aided solutions. There are many skills and tools required to solve engineering problems. Many physical processes are governed by nonlinear partial differential equations. These governing equations have few, if any, closed form solutions. Past and present solution methods require assumptions to reduce these equations to solvable forms. Computational methods take the governing equations and solve them directly on a computational grid. This ability to approach the equations in their exact form reduces the number of assumptions that must be made. This approach increases the accuracy of the solution and its applicability to the problem at hand. Recent advances in computer technology have allowed computer simulations to become an essential tool for problem solving. In order to perform computer simulations as quickly and accurately as possible, both hardware and software must be evaluated. With regards to hardware, the average consumer personal computers (PCs) are not configured for optimal scientific use. Only a few vendors create high performance computers to satisfy engineering needs. Software must be optimized for quick and accurate execution. Operating systems must utilize the hardware efficiently while supplying the software with seamless access to the computer’s resources. From the perspective of Bechtel Corporation and the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL), it is crucial to know the capabilities of a software package’s SMP (shared memory processor) version or cluster (distributed memory) version. Of utmost importance is knowledge of a software package’s cost and implementation challenges.

40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} if oblique angulation {{of the image}} intensifier is adequate to image {{the entire length of}} the common iliac artery during endovascular aneurysm repair or if additional caudal tilt is necessary. Methods: Using a 3 D <b>workstation,</b> the apparent <b>level</b> of the iliac bifurcation (distal limit of the stent-graft) was determined on computed tomographic angiography by profiling the common iliac segment in oblique angulation only and repeated with a combination of oblique angulation and caudal tilt. Two independent observers measured twice the apparent length of the iliac segment in both profiles for 50 patients according to a set protocol. Intra- and interobserver variability was calculated using the Bland and Altman method; the differences between the two different profiles were tested using paired t tests. Results: Of the 50 CTA datasets reviewed, 2 datasets were excluded owing to extensive calcification of the iliac system that prevented accurate interpretation of the image. Of the 96 segments studied, the iliac segments appeared longer (better profiled) with a combination of caudal tilt and oblique angulation in 80 %, with an average discrepancy of 9 mm for observer 1 (range 21 to + 28) and 7 mm for observer 2 (0 to + 26). The effect of caudal tilt was statistically significant for individual observers (p 50. 001 and 0. 024, respectively). Forty-six percent of iliac segments measured by observer 1 and 35 % by observer 2 showed that the addition of caudal tilt resulted in improved profiling by at least 10 mm. Although inter- and intraobserver variation was significant, the gain in apparent iliac length with the addition of caudal tilt was preserved. Conclusion: When profiled with oblique angulation alone, the location of the iliac bifurcation may appear higher than its true location, resulting in underutilization of the iliac segment by. 10 mm in over a third of the patients. The problem is corrected by employing additional caudal tilt...|$|R

The bachelor thesis was made in collaboration with Fläkt Woods AB. The study {{takes place in the}} plant’s final assembly step where all work is done manually. Fläkt Woods produces ventilation systems made to order, specifically designed for each customer. The study covers the process in which the products are completed. The assembly is a complex process which can be divided into two processes, one pre-assembly and one final assembly process. The pre-assembly consists of five sub-processes, which provides material to one of the three assembly lines located in the final assembly process. The foundation of the question formulations are based on the stops occurring in the supply between the pre-assembly and the final one. The occurrence of a stop makes it unfeasible for the pre-assembly to deliver materials thus also the final assembly’s possibility to receive materials. This generates a risk where the pre-assembly may become full while the final assembly could become empty. Furthermore, it has an immediate effect on the production flow and the usage of resources. The purpose of the bachelor thesis was to examine what causes the disruptions in the supply. To achieve this purpose, data was collected to establish a status report of the current situation by executing a process map. By observing the assembly process and applying root cause analysis the collaboration within the process and production flow were analysed to answer the posed question regarding the supply issue. This made up the foundation which the result of the study and action proposals where based on. The analysis showed that the disruptions in the supply were caused by an imbalance between the workstations in the final assembly, as well as the three assembly lines. The imbalance was a result of the varying cycle time per station for each customer order-specific products, and the manual release method that Fläkt Woods uses for their orders. The large variation in cycle times affected the production flow to the point that queue occurred on the lines in the final assembly. Together, the queue and the current method to release production orders, caused disruptions in the supply between the pre- and final assembly, which resulted in unused resources. In order to eliminate this imbalance the cycle time per station must be levelled off and the method to release production orders must be optimized in order to obtain an even flow of supply to all final assembly lines. The study presents suggestions as to how this could be managed with the currently existing recourses. By introducing an improved way of collaborating between workstations the cycle time per <b>workstation</b> could be <b>levelled</b> off. Furthermore, suggestions have been made regarding how assignments for the assemblers could be made less complicated. For instance the blur prints used could be simplified and more information should be made available for the worker who releases production orders. Meanwhile, the system which establishes the order of release need to be updated in order to correspond to Fläkt Woods product portfolio and their production layout. The thesis also presents more large-scaled suggestions for improvement. The suggestion that {{is believed to be the}} optimal solution for Fläkt Woods assembly process is to invest in a material square between the pre-assembly and final assembly. Furthermore, the line assembly layout ought to be changed into set assembly stations. This proposal eliminates the unnecessary interferences and the root causes that are connected to the imbalance and the manual method for release of production orders. ...|$|R
40|$|Les {{relations}} entre le vieillissement des salariés et les conditions de travail se situent à deux niveaux: l'un individuel qui est propre au vieillissement de chacun, l'autre collectif qui est marqué par les phénomènes de génération et d'époque. Ces relations ont été étudiées dans l'industrie automobile française en se centrant sur le travail répétitif sous cadence imposée et en associant des approches en démographie du travail et des approches ergonomiques. Les résultats permettent de définir des actions anticipatrices pour éviter les effets négatifs d'une double évolution : celle du vieillissement de la population des opérateurs et celle de l'organisation du travail. Throughout {{their lifetime}} individuals change {{through a process}} of environment-associated decline and construction. But repetitive jobs, inspired by Taylorist principles, do not take these changes into account. This contradiction between aging and repetitive tasks has a negative effect on individuals and their work activity. Designing workstations and implementing work organization requires an understanding of these consequences: how does repetitive work act upon decline and construction processes? How do these intricate aging problems modify the way people achieve their tasks? Three concems have to be kept in mind: 1) work may initiate or accelerate decline processes, and it may also be at the heart of enrichment and experience; 2) as age increases, interindividual differences increase; 3) generation effects, as well as technical and organizational changes, play a part in individuals' aging. This leads to various methodological approaches: collective (demography) or more individualist (ergonomics). We have tried to apply this interdisciplinary approach to the automotive industry. In France, the labour force is not yet "old". But the rising numbers of middle-aged workers — due to demographie trends, delayed school-leaving age, and early retirement — allows us to foresee a growing proportion of older workers in the next few years. In some firms, including the automotive sector, this evolution has already started, leading to various difficulties in human resources management, job allocation, and mobility. These issues appear to be particularly worrisome in the case of repetitive tasks. Tight time constraints, known to be painful for older workers, are now more common in this age category. Selection mechanisms which until recently had allowed the removal of the elderly from assembly lines, are no longer sufficient. In the firm where our study was conducted, this problem is all the more delicate because "soft" workstations (formerly reserved for older workers) are less numerous, cycle time is getting shorter, and just-in-time Systems are resulting in unexpected sequences of different car models. In order to cope with this issue, the firm set up a "workstations evaluation grid", in which effort, positions, time-pressure, and organizational constraints are considered. The grid then enables the job designers to target the most difficult situations (especially for older workers) and to improve these situations. Aware of the interest, but also the limits, of such an instrument, the firm asked us whether other factors than those which were used in the grid, had to be taken into account, and how to pay attention to interindividual variability. In agreement with the foremen and workers, we chose to study two different workshops, specializing in motor assembly and facia board fixing. In this article we examine the results concerning the motor assembly workshop, which operates with two 18 -employee shifts which change weekly. At each workstation one has to assemble a main part and a few small ones. The operator picks up the part with the matching screws, tightens it finger-tight, and then tightens it with screwing machines. This kind of task requires sensorimotor skills, together with speed and accuracy demands. Cycle time is around 1 minute 30 seconds, which necessitates fast choices of parts according to the car model. After interviewing operators and spending time observing them, we filmed one workstation run at various periods by four operators of different ages (from 30 to 46 years old) {{in order to understand the}} different ways of performing the task. Analysis of the videotapes show that as age increases, forms of rythmic steadiness are established. They also show that older workers develop strategies to save time and avoid overdemands on some parts of the body. For example, they combine "picking-up" activities in order to reduce the frequency of walks; and they try to replace sight by touch to avoid bending. Developing these strategies and adjustments requires, in turn, the development of fine sensorimotor skills, such as the handling of several small parts in the same hand, where each part has its own location and moves from palm to fingers without involving the operator's visual attention. Younger operators are also able to use these kinds of strategies, and in fact these can be observed now and again. But among older workers, the adjustments are more systematic and result from a long-term reorganization of their way of doing things. This reorganization, linked with their view of their own abilities and aimed at compensating for the effects of aging, is "costly" for the operators and leads them to protect themselves against potential disturbances. Consequently, as the interviews have shown, older workers are less involved in mutual aid activities, and are more likely to want to remain at the same workstation despite monotony. We were able, through demographie analysis, to verify that job-rotation is less frequent as age increases. Such a study, although needing to be strengthened, sheds more light than experimental approaches would do on the richness and complexity of the links between work and age-related decline and construction processes. In addition, it enables us to question two widespread attitudes. The first consists in considering aging issues as secondary, because technical changes and individual motivation can easily solve them. The second consists in viewing aging uniquely as a process of decay, to which no implementation can efficiently respond. Our study suggests that some improvements are possible, based on a key principle: the extension, as far as possible, of "room to manoeuver", at individual (choice of gestures, movements, rythm) as well as collective <b>levels</b> (<b>workstation</b> rotation). These concerns have also appeared in other studies on the same topic in various fields of activity such as mattress-cover stitching, aircraft assembling, and quality control in steelworks. Nevertheless, one must admit that repetitive tasks, and on-going organizations, leave little space for improving the working conditions of older workers and that the latter cannot always transfer their strategies and "knacks" to other situations...|$|R
