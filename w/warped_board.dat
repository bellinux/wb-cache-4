We can see that, due to frequency-selective fading, the channel orthogonality of the users fluctuate significantly across different sub-carriers for both frequency bands, {{with a standard deviation}} ranging from around 0.10 to 0.3. Also, 2.4 GHz has presented a relatively larger variance in channel orthogonality than 5.2 GHz, with the maximum standard deviation approaching 0.34. For the sub-carriers that possess less orthogonality, spatial efficiency degrades significantly.|$|R

30|$|We conduct {{experiments}} to measure delay spread and channel characteristics {{of an office}} indoor environment using WARP [26]. WARP is a software-defined radio platform with extensive over-the-air experimentation which enables the users to implement custom software codes. In order to achieve channel sounding, we generate training OFDM symbols with 256 sub-carriers as the channel probe signals, known as the IEEE 802.11 ax null data packet announcement (NDPA) frame [1]. The probe signals are followed by a trigger signal. The channel probe signals and the trigger signal are then transferred to the transmitting <b>WARP</b> <b>board</b> via an Ethernet cable. WARP is then triggered to transmit data samples over the air. The receiver samples the received signals and then transfers the raw samples to a PC, where the channel characteristics are estimated. Note that the channel sounding procedure needs to be performed periodically due to channel fluctuations. Our experiments are conducted on the 2.4 and 5.2 GHz band over a 20 MHz bandwidth. For practical implementations, delay spread can be measured at the receiver and fed back to the transmitter along with channel information.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{increasing}} {{complexity of}} the future wireless networks leads to the requirement for self-organization. This is true especially in home networking where users are typically not networking professionals and cannot be expected to perform complex optimization and management tasks. In this context, cognitive radio concept combining cross-layer optimization and learning mechanisms is a promising solution. We demonstrate a cognitive home networking prototype, which addresses practical problems users face with the present-day wireless networks at home. The prototype shows how nodes using IEEE 802. 11 radios and <b>WARP</b> <b>boards</b> operate under the Cognitive Resource Manager (CRM). The nodes achieve the desired performance by handling network dynamics and controlling parameters taking independent or cooperative decisions and operating in different layers of the protocol stack. This is done using multiple con-trol loops which are supported by the CRM architecture. We demonstrate the use of machine learning for online estimation of network activity patterns to enable more efficient Dynamic Spec-trum Access (DSA) using Hidden Semi-Markov Models (HSMM). The demonstration showcases dynamic spectrum allocation and policy-based behavioral changes in a home environment, where several multimedia streams and data communication flows are competing against each other and against external, also primary, interferers.

40|$|Several {{previous}} works in wireless network security {{have demonstrated the}} weakness of conventional security mechanisms. Spoofing MAC address by transmission monitoring {{is not a big}} deal even for inexpert attackers and once a malicious device has obtained such an address the range of possible threats is wide. In this thesis a new identification algorithm is proposed. This method is based on the unique and unclonable characteristics of radio transmitters. By exploiting minimal impairments inside analog hardware components a digital fingerprint can be extracted by only looking at the received signal and a database of legal clients can be built. Unique characteristics of antenna, oscillator, amplifiers and other transmitter specific elements are indeed directly transferred on the transmitted signal providing idiosyncratic features. For testing the model we use ten reconfigurable FPGA <b>WARP</b> radio <b>boards</b> as transmitters and a common <b>WARP</b> radio <b>board</b> as receiver. Signature extraction is done by looking at received frames and as much as 14 different classifiers are deployed. These metrics include frequency offset, modulated phase offset, in-phase/quadrature offset from the origin, and magnitude. Each classifier may provide a weak contribution, but it is only after combining all of them using a weighted voting algorithm that our model is able to perfectly classify six boards over ten and provide fair results for other three radios by analyzing as few as ten received frames per board...|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} decade, {{wireless}} network assisted positioning techniques have attracted great interests. Mobile terminals (MTs) {{are equipped with}} positioning function through employment of Global Navigation Satellite System, radio communication networks, and integrated inertial sensors. Moreover, MTs can cooperate with each other by means of either centralized data fusion or distributed data fusion. Such cooperative behaviors {{are referred to as}} the spatial cooperation, which were originally developed for wireless sensor networks. However, state-of-the-art spatial cooperation approaches were specially designed for short-range networks, and they are not suitable for applications in cellular networks. The other problem is that the spatial cooperation requires distance estimation between many MTs, which will cause significant training overhead. These research issues motivated the following major contributions: • A novel spatial cooperative positioning algorithm, namely the base station to MT angle searching, was proposed in cellular networks. The proposed algorithm was based on centralized data fusion, and it outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by at least 4 m improvement in positioning accuracy. • The Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) was employed to study the relationship between the positioning accuracy and training overhead. It was found that the CRLB is minimized when 2 out of all involved MTs send training signals for the purpose of distance estimation. Moreover, we have investigated the impact of inertial sensors on mobile positioning, which allows for an MT to cooperate with itself over time. This {{is referred to as the}} temporal cooperation. Our major contribution is: • Derived a new CRLB for the inertial sensors enhanced radio positioning with the knowledge of random walk mobility model. Interestingly, it was found that the knowledge of mobility model is not needed when inertial sensor measurements are sufficiently accurate. In addition, we have developed a number of novel distance-estimation algorithms that can offer highly accurate time-of-arrival estimation using orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) waveforms in wireless local area networks (WLANs).

40|$|In {{the last}} decade, 802. 11 {{wireless}} devices data-rates have increased by three orders of magnitude, while communications experiencing low throughput are still largely present. Such throughput loss {{is a fundamental}} problem of wireless networking {{that is difficult to}} diagnose and amend. My research addresses two key causes of throughput loss: MAC layer protocol overhead and destructive link interference. First, I design WiFi-Nano reducing the channel access overhead by an order of magnitude leveraging an innovative speculative technique to transmit preambles. This new concept is based on simultaneous preamble transmission and detection via a self-interference cancellation design, and paves the way to the realization of the collision detection paradigm in wireless networks. Next, I propose 802. 11 ec (Encoded Control), the first 802. 11 -based protocol that eliminates the overhead of control packets. Instead, 802. 11 ec coordinates node transmissions via a set of predefined pseudo-noise codewords, resulting in the dramatic increase of throughput and communication robustness. Finally, I design MIDAS, a model-driven network management tool that alleviates low throughput wireless links identifying key corrective actions. MIDAS' key contribution is to reveal the fundamental role of node transmission coordination in characterizing destructive interference. I implement WiFi-Nano, 802. 11 ec, and MIDAS using a combination of <b>WARP</b> FPGA-based radio <b>boards,</b> custom emulation platforms, and network simulators.

40|$|International audienceReaction wood {{produces}} very peculiar maturation stresses at {{the tree}} periphery i. e. compressive stress or very high tensile stress, for compression and tension wood respectively, as compared to moderately high tensile stress for normal wood. This means that both its mechanical state and its mechanical and physical properties differ from normal wood. Compression wood shows big differences from normal wood in conifers, for all physical and mechanical properties: higher density and axial crushing strength (MOR) but lower modulus of elasticity (MOE), far higher axial (longitudinal) shrinkage but lower radial and tangential shrinkage, sometimes even lower than the axial shrinkage. For tension wood things are less simple and can vary a lot from hardwood species to species. Globally there are no systematic differences in density and transverse shrinkage, MOE {{tends to be a}} little higher while MOR is slightly lower. However, axial shrinkage is much higher for tension wood with a gelatinous layer (G layer) than normal wood due to the specific gel like organization of cellulose microfibrils in the G layer. For tension wood without a G layer(which is rather frequent) axial shrinkage in the first drying operation is around two times higher than in normal wood mainly because of a kind of hygro-thermal release of locked in maturation stress. Overall the very high tensile stress and stored elastic energy in tension wood lead to problemsin wood processing (end splitting and <b>board</b> <b>warping),</b> which is far less the case for compression wood. But due to the large difference in properties relative to normal wood, compression wood occurrence is always a big problem for the in service behaviour of timber, which is seldom the case for tension wood...|$|R
