25|$|In {{a meeting}} with the Concordia Association, the {{organizers}} devised what was termed Concordia Costume, or the kyowafuku, in 1936. Even Japanese like Masahiko Amakasu and Kanji Ishiwara adopted it. It <b>was</b> <b>gray</b> and a civilianized version of Imperial Japanese Army uniform. It was similar to the National Clothes (kokumin-fuku) worn by Japanese civilians in World War II as well as the Zhongshan suit. A pin of either a Manchukuo flag or a five-pointed, five colored star with the Manchukuo national colors were worn on the collars.|$|E
25|$|Gray started {{shooting}} indiscriminately, targeting a utility vehicle full of locals {{who had seen}} the Holden house burning and stopped to help. He first shot Vanessa Percy {{several times in the}} back as she ran down the street in terror; she died a few hours later at the scene. He then turned to the three children. He killed the two boys, Leo Wilson and Dion Percy. The boys' sister, Stacey, was critically injured by a bullet to her abdomen, but survived. Ross Percy, the children's father, who had been driving them home after a day fishing when they saw the fire, was fatally shot in the head. Next, Aleki Tali was killed. Gray then entered the home of Tim Jamieson, killing him and another elderly local, former Green Island mayor Vic Crimp. The next victim was James Dickson, who was looking for his dog. Eva Helen Dickson, James' mother, and neighbour Chris Cole went into the road to see what the noise <b>was.</b> <b>Gray</b> shot at both of them, wounding Cole who was in a phone booth calling the police and forcing Mrs Dickson to dive for cover. Mrs Dickson, who had recently had a hip replacement and was unable to walk without assistance, pulled herself along on her stomach using her arms and feet in a ditch to get inside and called 1-1-1 (emergency telephone number). She then crawled back to Cole to tell him help was coming. By this stage, it was getting dark and the dispatcher advised her to stay inside. Mrs Dickson later received the George Medal for bravery. Help arrived too late for Cole, who died in the hospital.|$|E

500|$|Geoff Goodman, {{the lead}} hero {{designer}} for Overwatch had a [...] "big hand" [...] in Tracer's design; {{she was the}} first hero designed for the game and was used to test the basic gameplay. Kaplan recounted the first Overwatch playtest, stating, [...] "the entire level <b>was</b> <b>gray</b> and blocky and the only hero was Tracer. We had no visual effects or attachment points on her guns so she just shot laser beams out of her eyes." [...] Overwatchs assistant game director Aaron Keller has said that Temple of Anubis was the first map developed for the game, and that the map and Tracer were worked on concurrently. Keller revealed: [...] "One day we got both of them in, and just with Tracer running around an unfinished map it was fun." [...] Keller also described how Tracer's three abilities were maintained throughout the game's development, as opposed to the game's other heroes, stating that, [...] "from the beginning, she originated as a 'whole' hero." [...] However, her health pool was nerfed during the game's late closed beta stages. On Tracer's gameplay style, Kotakus Kirk Hamilton commented, [...] "she's quick and squishy, designed more to harry the opposing team from behind than to survive a frontal assault".|$|E

2500|$|Henry David Gray {{writes on}} the {{complexity}} of views that readers have taken while contemplating the sonnets. There are the Southamptonites who date the sonnets from 1592â€“1596, and believe the first 125 sonnets to be in chronological order, the dark lady being Elizabeth Vernon, and the Rival Poet to be Drayton. Gray continues with the next group of critics being Pembrokists, dating the sonnets from 1598 to 1603, the dark lady being Mary Fitton, and the Rival Poet being Chapman. Gray believes, following with Sir Sidney Lee, that the sonnets are literary exercises, {{it is important to}} figure who the dark lady is, that W.H. is not the youth addressed in the first 125 sonnets, the sonnets are in no chronological order, and he had no idea who the rival poet <b>was.</b> <b>Gray</b> proclaims his view, [...] "I am a free lance among the Sonnets' critics with a special set of conjectures all my own; though I do agree with Butler that that W.H. is William Hughes, with Acheson that the Dark Lady is Mistress Davanant, and with Montmorency that the Rival Poet is Spenser." ...|$|E
