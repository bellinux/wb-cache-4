5|$|In England's second innings, Lindwall bounced Washbrook and the England opener {{went for}} the hook shot. The ball flew in the air {{straight}} towards fine leg, where Hassett dropped {{the ball on the}} third attempt. At the time, Washbrook was on 21.

5|$|Night Trap <b>was</b> <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{launch of}} the NEMO in 1989 {{alongside}} another interactive movie, Sewer Shark. Both games had a combined budget of about $4.5 million USD ($1.5 for Night Trap, and $3 million for Sewer Shark) making them {{two of the most}} expensive video games of the era. However, just before the {{launch of the}} NEMO in early 1989, which was now called the Control-Vision, Hasbro canceled the system release. The company cited high hardware costs as the reason. The system was originally intended to sell for $199, but the high manufacturing costs of the system's DRAM drove it to $299. In contrast, the market-leading Nintendo Entertainment System sold for around $100 in 1989. Riley also cited the high cost of filmmaking for giving Hasbro cold feet. Disappointed by the whole affair, Fulop went on to form PF Magic, which later created the Petz virtual pet simulation series. Zito purchased the rights to the abandoned Control-Vision games, and after learning that Sony was considering Sewer Shark for a release on their forthcoming Super NES CD-ROM, he founded his own company to bring them to the system, Digital Pictures. When the Super NES CD-ROM failed to materialize, Zito began working with Sega for a release on the Sega CD.
