500|$|Major {{parts of}} the song [...] "Sadda Haq" [...] were shot at the Norbulingka monastery in McLeod Ganj, Dharamsala and people waving the free Tibet flag in the {{backdrop}} were shown in the song video. This triggered a dispute between Central Board of Film Certification and Imtiaz Ali when the Board asked Ali to blur the flag before the film hit the theatre, but the director refused to do it. Imtiaz Ali said, [...] "I am not concerned at all. I {{have been out of}} India for long and don’t know <b>whats</b> <b>going</b> <b>on,</b> but I don’t see anything controversial in the intention portrayal in the movie. The purpose of the movie is not to make any social message, its more about personal freedom rather than a geographical issue." [...] However, he had to remove the sequence from the video to get the film's censor done. Later an official from the Board stated: [...] "The Censor Board chief explained to them that all the cuts were made by the director voluntarily, and he had the option of appealing to a review board which he didn’t do. There were certain discussions between (Imtiaz) Ali and the Board regarding retaining a kiss between two actors (Ranbir and Nargis), but there have been no disagreement regarding deleting the flag from the frames." [...] The controversy sparked protests among the Tibetan diaspora in Dharamsala and Chennai. Later television broadcasts blotted out a [...] "Free Tibet" [...] banner featured in the song.|$|E
