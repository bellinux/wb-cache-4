So we boarded the sequence to the music, and it felt like such a better ending than any song we could have written on our own." [...] The writers gave it a freeze-frame shot for the ending. Greenblatt's favorite part was director Springer's drawings of Patrick on the electric drums and SpongeBob saying, [...] "It's the thrill of one more kill" [...] (an excerpt from [...] "Sweet Victory").

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Freedom" [...] was {{directed}} by Sean De Sparengo, and filmed in London in July 2011. It took one day to film, and is primarily set in an underground club with red lighting, reminiscent of that featured in the group's 2002 single [...] "Freak like Me". De Sparengo commented on the concept and visual attributes of the video, saying: [...] "One {{of the interesting things}} for the concept for this video is that <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> to make everything look incredibly beautiful. It was about making a video where the Sugababes felt like they were {{at the top of their}} game." [...] The video made its premiere in August 2011. A [...] clip was uploaded to the Sugababes official VEVO channel on YouTube. Daily Mirror praised the band's appearance in the video.|$|E
500|$|As {{a senior}} in 1971, Bell led Troy High to a 10–0 record. [...] In the season opener, Bell broke off tackle and rushed 70yards for a {{touchdown}} {{the first time he}} got the ball. [...] He scored touchdowns in three of his first four carries, though one was nullified by a penalty. [...] Bell rushed for 190yards and threetouchdowns in the season opener. [...] The opposing coach said, [...] "It was the same old story. [...] <b>We</b> <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> to stop Bell and yet we still couldn't do it. [...] That boy is a great football player." [...] Bell again won first-team All-Ohio honors, but he lost the Associated Press 1971 Ohio AAA high school back of the year award. [...] The award instead went to a high school senior from Columbus, Archie Griffin. [...] Bell and Griffin would continue their rivalry in college.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with MTV, Halo developer Bungie's former content manager Frank O'Connor said that {{the inclusion of the}} Arbiter as a playable character in Halo2 {{was supposed to be a}} [...] "secret on the scale of a Shyamalan plot twist" [...] and explains that Bungie was able to keep the public uninformed about this until the game's release, to the point that O'Connor never even considered including it on the weekly development updates posted at Bungie's webpage. O'Connor also stated that Bungie [...] "had some other things that were secrets within secrets" [...] and claimed that there was material related to the Arbiter that was kept secret during the development of Halo3 because [...] "There is an aspect of the Arbiter's character that is still secret to this day and will remain so for a good reason." [...] Story director Joseph Staten said that the purpose of introducing the Arbiter was [...] "to offer another, compelling point of view on a war where telling friend from foe wasn't always clear-cut. <b>We</b> <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> a trilogy on our hands, so we were looking past the shock of playing as the enemy [...] ".|$|E

500|$|Series creator Chris Carter {{felt this}} was one of his {{favorite}} episodes to write, as he found it interesting to explore how the character of Fox Mulder would react to the death of his father. Carter had recently lost a parent himself when he began work on the episode. Frank Spotnitz said of the episode [...] "The expectations were very high coming after a summer's worth of anticipation to see how Mulder got out of the boxcar. <b>We</b> <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> to answer that question and still leave an intriguing enough dilemma {{at the end of the}} show to bring viewers back for the third and final part. I also thought it was a big gamble to do all that Indian mysticism stuff. I thought a lot of people would not necessarily respond to that. So I was nervous about that, but very excited about the Scully storyline and the way all of that played out with Mulder and Skinner." [...] Carter attended Navajo chants and rituals to ensure the accuracy of the events in this episode, after being alerted to inaccuracies in the previous episode by Navajo scholars. A sand painter was brought in to create the two sand paintings for the Blessing Way sequence, which took an entire day to create. The scenes set in New Mexico were filmed in the same Vancouver quarry that had been used as a stand-in in the previous episode, [...] "Anasazi", the repainting of which required only minor touch-ups.|$|E
500|$|Burger King's {{creative}} {{control over}} the game impacted its development defined {{as a set of}} rules. The first rule was that there was only one King character. In response, the developers had the idea of the Xbox avatars playing the game and finding the crown to become the King. This idea was rejected by Burger King who said players could not become the King. The developers' next idea was to have one person be the King and the other players lay traps to interfere with his deliveries, but this idea was again rejected by Burger King because the King could not be exposed to any danger. With the usual hazards and competition elements of the video games removed, the developers decided upon a stealth format with no human opponents. In order to better capture the accuracy and authenticity of the King's movements, the King was flown to Britain for motion capture for the game's production. Blitz Games' Edward Linley described Sneak King as the riskiest game concept of the project because it [...] "is the appearance and antics of the King himself that give the game its humor and life; without him, the game simply wouldn't work. Until we had the finished King model and motion capture in the game, we couldn't be certain the concept would gel. Fortunately, the moment he went in, <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> created something truly unique." [...] Sneak Kings programming code consists of 60,000 active lines with another 43,000 developer comment lines. The game's instruction manual does not include a list of credits.|$|E
500|$|Before {{production}} began, {{the production}} team sought out Chinese, Japanese, Filipino, or Korean vocal talents. Tia Carrere {{was an early}} candidate to voice the title character, and Lea Salonga, {{who had been the}} singing voice of Princess Jasmine in Aladdin, was also cast as Mulan's speaking voice, but the directors did not find her attempt at a deeper speaking voice when Mulan impersonated Ping convincing, so Ming-Na Wen was brought in to speak the role. Salonga returned to provide the singing voice. Wen herself landed the role after the filmmakers listened to her narration at the beginning of The Joy Luck Club. Coats reflected on her decision, stating [...] "When we heard Ming-Na doing that voice-over, <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> our Mulan. She has a very likable and lovely voice, and those are the qualities we were looking for." [...] For the role of Mushu, Disney was aiming for top Hollywood talent in the vein of Robin Williams's performance as the Genie, and approached Eddie Murphy, who at first balked during recording in the Disney studios, and asked to record the voice in his basement at his Bubble Hill mansion in Englewood, New Jersey. For the speaking voice of Captain Li Shang, B. D. Wong was hired, although his singing voice, for the song [...] "I'll Make a Man Out of You", was performed by Donny Osmond, who had originally auditioned as the speaking voice of the title character in Hercules. Osmond's casting originated from a suggestion from the casting director, and throughout recording, Osmond studied Wong's dialogue tapes, and aimed to match his inflections and personality. Osmond commented that his sons decided that he had finally [...] "made it" [...] in show business when he was in a Disney film. Likewise for the role of Grandmother Fa, June Foray provided for the speaking voice, and Marni Nixon supplied the singing voice.|$|E

Existing algorithms {{differ in the}} kinds of traces they take as input and {{in the kinds of}} candidate specification they present as output. One challenge common to all approaches relates to the faithfulness of the mining results: how can we be confident that the extracted specifications faithfully characterize the program we investigate? Since producing and analyzing traces is costly, how would <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> seen enough traces? And, how would <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> not wasted resources and seen too many of them? In this paper we address these important questions by presenting a novel, black box, probabilistic framework based on a notion of log completeness, and by applying it to three different well-known specification mining algorithms from the literature: k-Tails, Synoptic, and mining of scenario-based triggers and effects. Extensive evaluation over 24 models taken from 9 different sources shows the soundness, generalizability, and usefulness of the framework and its contribution to the state-of-the-art in dynamic specification mining.

So people have become tired. They don't believe their vote counts anymore." [...] Esso, the RPT Secretary-General, described the result as [...] "great victory that gives {{us a lot of}} satisfaction and wipes off any doubts about the process", while Bodjona dismissed the opposition as [...] "bad losers". For its part, the EU observer mission released a report that noted the accusations of vote-buying by the RPT, but also suggested there was no evidence to support opposition claims of outright fraud.|$|E

The Pamunkey have been paying such tribute since the treaty of 1646. Making this annual payment {{has not always been}} easy. Chief Miles remembers one year that was particularly hard, [...] "We couldn't find anything, no deer, no turkeys--nothing. My dad was chief then, and <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> to have something to present to the governor; so we went to a turkey farm, bought a live turkey, brought it back to the reservation and killed it. That way we were able to fulfill the terms of the treaty--after all it was killed on the reservation." [...] As far as anyone knows, they have not missed a payment in 331 years.|$|E

The Enterprise-D's end also appeared—the saucer crash had first been proposed as the cliffhanger for Moore's original seventh-season finale [...] "All Good Things...", which eventually became the series finale. Kirk's death was initially developed in Braga, Moore and Berman's story sessions. Moore recalled that [...] "we wanted to aim high, do something different and big... <b>We</b> <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> to have a strong Picard story arc, so what are the profound things in a man's life he has to face? Mortality tops the list." [...] After the idea of killing off a Next Generation cast member was vetoed, someone suggested that Kirk die instead.
