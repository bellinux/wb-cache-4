5|$|Although Godwin <b>was</b> <b>fond</b> of his children, he was, in many ways, {{ill-equipped to}} care for them. As Todd explains, he was {{constantly}} annoyed by their noise, demanding silence while he worked. However, {{when he took a}} trip to Dublin to visit Wollstonecraft's sisters, he missed the girls immensely and wrote to them frequently.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{also played}} swing and R, Powell {{was known as}} a bebop player. This {{included}} using right-hand single-note lines. In his playing with Brown and Roach, he <b>was</b> <b>fond</b> of inserting musical quotes, including from nursery rhymes and opera.|$|E

5|$|Since 1905, when Saskatchewan entered Confederation, the {{province}} had {{been dominated by}} the Liberal Party, which practised highly effective machine politics.

5|$|Bewick <b>was</b> <b>fond</b> of {{the music}} of Northumberland, and of the Northumbrian smallpipes in particular. He {{especially}} wanted to promote the Northumbrian smallpipes, and to support the piper John Peacock, so he encouraged Peacock to teach pupils to become masters {{of this kind of}} music. One of these pupils was Thomas's son, Robert, whose surviving manuscript tunebooks give a picture of a piper's repertoire in the 1820s.|$|E
5|$|In 1910 Yeats {{thought his}} {{horoscope}} suggested {{a return to}} Olivia; he distanced himself from Maud and in June began to see Olivia more frequently. Pound <b>was</b> <b>fond</b> of Olivia, which may have caused Yeats some jealousy as when, for example, Pound met the two at the theatre and took them afterward to tea—an occasion when Yeats was extremely rude to Pound. A year later, Olivia introduced Yeats to Georgie Hyde-Lees, her 18-year-old step-niece and Dorothy's best friend, whom Yeats eventually married.|$|E

5|$|Powell, his wife, and Brown {{were killed}} in a car crash when {{traveling}} overnight from Philadelphia to Chicago. Powell was beginning to achieve recognition {{at the time of his}} death, but he never had the chance to record as a leader. He had a playful piano style, and <b>was</b> <b>fond</b> of using musical quotations. His relatively heavy touch and use of left-hand fourths influenced fellow pianist McCoy Tyner.|$|E
5|$|Vainio <b>was</b> <b>fond</b> {{of the sea}} and sailing. He {{often took}} his family and friends sailing in his boat, and in 1987 bought an island in Österskär with his wife Pirkko. His love for sailing is evident in the song Kaikki paitsi purjehdus on turhaa ("Everything But Sailing Is Pointless"), which was {{composed}} by Lasse Mårtenson.|$|E
5|$|William III {{commissioned}} Nicholas Hawksmoor and Sir Christopher Wren {{to conduct}} a large, final classical remodelling of the Upper Ward, but the king's early death caused the plan to be cancelled. Queen Anne <b>was</b> <b>fond</b> of the castle, and attempted to address {{the lack of a}} formal garden by instructing Henry Wise to begin work on the Maestricht Garden beneath the North Terrace, which was never completed. Anne also created the racecourse at Ascot and began the tradition of the annual Royal Ascot procession from the castle.|$|E

5|$|A {{cheerleader}} at school, Lawrence {{also played}} softball, field hockey and basketball, which she {{played on a}} boys team that her father coached. She <b>was</b> <b>fond</b> of horseback riding while growing up and frequently visited a local horse farm. She has a damaged coccyx from being thrown off a horse. The actress has said that {{she knew she would}} be famous from an early age. When her father worked from home, she performed for him, often dressing up as a clown or ballerina. Her first acting assignment was at the age of nine with the role of a prostitute in a church play based on the Book of Jonah. For the next few years, she continued to take parts in church plays and school musicals.|$|E
5|$|After the 1896 launch {{was called}} off, enthusiasm {{declined}} for joining the expedition {{for a second}} attempt in 1897. From the candidates Andrée picked the 27-year-old engineer, Knut Frænkel, to replace Ekholm. Frænkel was a civil engineer from the north of Sweden, an athlete who <b>was</b> <b>fond</b> of long mountain hikes. He was enrolled specifically to take over Ekholm's meteorological observations. Despite lacking Ekholm's theoretical and scientific knowledge, he handled this task efficiently. His meteorological journal has enabled researchers to reconstruct {{the movements of the}} three men during their last few months with considerable precision.|$|E
5|$|Fermi <b>was</b> <b>fond</b> of {{pointing}} out that Alessandro Volta, working in his laboratory, could have {{had no idea where}} the study of electricity would lead. Fermi is generally remembered for his work on nuclear power and nuclear weapons, especially the creation of the first nuclear reactor, and the development of the first atomic and hydrogen bombs. His scientific work has stood the test of time. This includes his theory of beta decay, his work with non-linear systems, his discovery of the effects of slow neutrons, his study of pion-nucleon collisions, and his Fermi–Dirac statistics. His speculation that a pion was not a fundamental particle pointed the way towards the study of quarks and leptons.|$|E

6000|$|... "Much {{the same}} that is {{accomplished}} by the others," [...] put in Sharp at this point. [...] "The orator gives pleasure to those who <b>are</b> <b>fond</b> of recitation or declamation; the musician pleases those who <b>are</b> <b>fond</b> of sweet sounds, and the gambler gives pleasure to men who <b>are</b> <b>fond</b> of the excitement of play. Besides, by paying his way he gives benefit to all whom he employs. He rents a house, he buys furniture, he eats food, all of which brings profit to house-owners, cabinet-makers, butchers, bakers, etcetera, and is good done to {{the world by the}} gambler." ...|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to these gunnery drills, Broke <b>was</b> <b>fond</b> of preparing hypothetical scenarios to test his crew. For example, after all hands had been drummed to quarters, he would inform them of a theoretical attack {{and see how they}} would act to defend the ship. Though the use of cutlasses in training was avoided a method of swordsmanship training called 'singlestick' was regularly practised. This was a game employing roughly similar cuts, thrusts and parries as were used with the cutlass, but as it was played with wooden sticks with wicker hand guards; hits, although painful, were not often dangerous. It soon developed quickness of eye and wrist. Many of the crew became very expert.|$|E
5|$|Interspersed {{throughout}} his scientific essays for Natural History magazine, Gould frequently {{referred to his}} nonscientific interests and pastimes. As a boy he collected baseball cards and remained a New York Yankees fan {{throughout his}} life. As an adult he <b>was</b> <b>fond</b> of science fiction movies, but often deplored their poor storytelling and presentation of science. His other interests included singing baritone in the Boston Cecilia, {{and he was a}} great aficionado of Gilbert and Sullivan operas. He collected rare antiquarian books, possessed an enthusiasm for architecture, and enjoyed city walks. He often traveled to Europe, and spoke French, German, Russian, and Italian. He sometimes alluded ruefully to his tendency to put on weight.|$|E
5|$|James Whitcomb Riley {{was born}} on October 7, 1849, {{in the town of}} Greenfield, Indiana, the third of the six {{children}} of Reuben Andrew and Elizabeth Marine Riley. Riley's father was an attorney, and in the year before Riley's birth, he was elected a member of the Indiana House of Representatives as a Democrat. He developed a friendship with James Whitcomb, the governor of Indiana, after whom he named his son. Martin Riley, Riley's uncle, was an amateur poet who occasionally wrote verses for local newspapers. Riley <b>was</b> <b>fond</b> of his uncle who helped influence his early interest in poetry.|$|E
