25|$|When Cardenas {{learned of}} his wife's predicament, he {{recommended}} that she retain Charles Garry, a criminal attorney who had {{gained a reputation}} in Soledad State Penitentiary as the ardent defender of George Jackson, Huey P. Newton, and Bobby Seale. At the same time, news of the case reached the San Francisco Bay Area, where the women's rights and Chicano movements were at their apex. García began speaking to women's groups in the area, and the Inez Garcia Defense Committee raised money for the defense and publicized the case, hoping to put gender inequalities {{in the criminal justice}} system, rather than Garcia herself, on trial. Through her contact with feminist groups, Garcia transformed from the timid, submissive victim who was too ashamed to even admit <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> into an outspoken critic of patriarchy, even when she saw it in her own judge, who she accused of prejudice and sexism. During the trial, Garry had argued that García had acted with diminished capacity. He based this argument on expert psychological testimony that rape causes mental trauma and García's own history of mental instability. The defense disappointed feminists who preferred to see García as a symbol of strength and resistance to male domination. It also failed to win the sympathy of the jury. García was convicted of second-degree murder, sentenced, and spent two years in the California Institution for Women before her appeal was heard.|$|E
500|$|On 3 July 1985, DCS Topping visited Brady, {{then being}} held at Gartree Prison, Leicestershire, but found him [...] "scornful of any {{suggestion}} that he had confessed to more murders". Police nevertheless decided to resume their search of Saddleworth Moor, once more using the photographs taken by Brady and Hindley to help them identify possible burial sites. Meanwhile, in November 1986 Winnie Johnson, Keith Bennett's mother, {{wrote a letter to}} Hindley begging to know <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> son, a letter that Hindley seemed to be [...] "genuinely moved" [...] by. It ended: ...|$|E

500|$|Officers also searched 5Eaton Row, {{into which}} Lucan had moved early in 1973, and after {{interviewing}} [...] his mother (who {{had called to}} take the children to her home in StJohn's Wood), his last address at 72aElizabeth Street. Nothing untoward was found; on the bed, a suit and shirt lay alongside a book on Greek shipping millionaires, and Lucan's wallet, car keys, money, driving licence, handkerchief and spectacles were on a bedside table. His passport was in a drawer and his blue Mercedes-Benz parked outside, its engine cold and its battery flat. Ranson then visited Veronica Lucan at St George's Hospital. Although heavily sedated, {{she was able to}} describe <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> A police officer was left to guard her, should her assailant return. Rivett's body was taken to the mortuary, and a search was undertaken of all local basement areas and gardens, skips and open spaces.|$|E
2500|$|Roy Huggins {{was just}} {{starting}} his career when Wray was at Paramount, but {{he had his own}} encounter with McCarthyism a few years later and ultimately took the advice that Wray could not and named names. [...] Boris Ingster's career had not been affected by the McCarthy era, but he had worked as a writer and director at RKO and Paramount in the 1940s and knew <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> and there is little doubt that, together, he and Huggins orchestrated her return to screenwriting.|$|E
2500|$|Mathilda goes to Tony, as Léon had {{instructed}} {{her to do}} before he died. Tony tells Mathilda he had been instructed by Léon to give his money to her if anything happened to him; he offers to hold it and provide the money on an allowance basis. Mathilda returns to school and meets the headmistress, who readmits her after Mathilda reveals <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> She then walks onto a field near the school to plant Léon's houseplant, as she had told Léon he should, to [...] "give it roots".|$|E

60|$|To Bert {{it was no}} {{more than}} the end of a series of disagreeable sensations. He was not curious <b>to</b> know <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> the airship, nor <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> the battle. For a long time he lay waiting apprehensively for the {{pitching}} and tossing and his qualms to return, and so, lying, boxed up in the locker, he presently fell asleep.|$|R
2500|$|After the Nazi {{take-over}} in January 1933 she emigrated {{with her}} family, ending up living permanently in the Soviet Union. [...] A series of disappointments followed {{and she became}} increasingly disillusioned with the Soviet system which earlier, when she had written about the Soviet Union as a visitor from the west, she had eulogised. [...] {{was identified as a}} Gestapo spy and executed in 1938. [...] On 16 August 1939 Martha Ruben-Wolf was still unaware of <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> husband following his arrest on 27 November 1937 when, despairing, she committed suicide by taking an overdose of sleeping pills.|$|E
2500|$|At once Jesus {{realized}} that power {{had gone out}} from him. He turned around in the crowd and asked, “Who touched my clothes?” [...] “You see the people crowding against you,” his disciples answered, “and yet you can ask, ‘Who touched me?’ ” But Jesus kept looking around to see who had done it.Then the woman, knowing <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> came and fell at his feet and, trembling with fear, told him the whole truth. [...] He said to her, “Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace and be freed from your suffering.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Her {{departure}} {{was spread}} over three episodes, including an hour-long special, devised {{as part of}} the programme's [...] "ratings war" [...] with rival soap opera EastEnders. Her final scenes attracted 20million viewers. Lancashire briefly reprised the role in 2000, with series producer Jane Macnaught deeming Raquel one of Coronation Street most popular ever characters and her return an opportunity for her [...] "millions of fans" [...] to learn <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> in the intervening years. Lancashire and Kennedy were the only cast members to appear in Raquel's return episode, marking the first time the programme had featured just two characters. It remained the only two-hander episode of the soap for seven years, until a 2007 episode featured only mother and daughter Deirdre (Anne Kirkbride) and Tracy Barlow (Kate Ford).|$|E

2500|$|According to Ida Görres, [...] "Thérèse {{instantly}} understood <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> {{when she}} won this banal little victory over her sensitivity, which she had borne for so long; ...freedom is found in resolutely looking away from oneself.. {{and the fact that}} a person can cast himself away from himself reveals again that being good, victory is pure grace, a sudden gift..It cannot be coerced, and yet it can be received only by the patiently prepared heart". Biographer Kathryn Harrison: [...] "After all, in the past she had tried to control herself, had tried with all her being and had failed. Grace, alchemy, masochism: through whatever lens we view her transport, Thérèse's night of illumination presented both its power and its danger. It would guide her steps between the mortal and the divine, between living and dying, destruction and apotheosis. It would take her exactly where she intended to go." ...|$|E
2500|$|Changing Woman {{returned}} {{home and told}} <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> parents.

And so First Man and [...] prepared the hogan and the basket and waited long into the night. Finally First Man {{returned home}}. When Changing Woman returned home in the morning, First Man asked her at once: [...] "Who came last night?" [...] The girl said, [...] "No one came, but some of the meal has been taken." [...] The same thing happened the second night, and the third. On the morning after the fourth night, the girl told First Man, [...] "I saw no one, but someone touched me, and I was moved." [...] Four days later, [...] said, [...] "Mother, something moves within me." [...] First Woman answered, [...] "Daughter, that must be your baby moving." ...|$|E
2500|$|Oilill died like {{a prince}} it was reported. [...] His head {{was cut off}} by a triumphant Fergus and was impaled on a lance and {{brought back to the}} fort at Rathmorgan to prove to Flidhais that she was now a free woman. [...] Fergus {{presented}} her husband's severed head as a courtship present to Flidhais. [...] However, Flidhais was overcome with guilt as she looked in Oilill's unblinking all-knowing eyes and she was horrified at <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> husband. [...] She burst into tears and demanded his body be brought back to their fort. The troops retrieved Oilill's body and when Flidhais looked at his body, gashed all over and covered in blood, she was again filled with such remorse she began to recount his every worthy action during his lifetime. [...] Tradition maintains that Oilill is buried just north of Inver in a tumulus which is marked on today's maps as a 'mound'.|$|E

2500|$|In May 1992, Fred {{asked his}} 13-year-old {{daughter}} {{to bring some}} bottles to a room {{on the first floor}} of their home. Rose was not present in the home at the time. Shortly thereafter, the girl's siblings heard her scream, [...] "No, don't!" [...] Later, Fred returned downstairs. The girl was found by her siblings writhing in pain, sobbing that her father had raped and sodomised her, at one stage partially strangling her. When Rose returned home, the girl confided in her mother that she had been raped by Fred, although Rose simply replied, [...] "Oh well. You were asking for it." [...] Over the following weeks, the girl was raped on three further occasions, with Rose personally witnessing one of these rapes before following her distressed and bleeding daughter into the bathroom and asking the child, [...] "Well, what did you expect?" [...] Fred also filmed one of these rapes. Several weeks later, the girl garnered the courage to confide in a close friend what her father had done; this friend would divulge <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> own mother on 4 August. In response, the friend's mother anonymously informed the police.|$|E
2500|$|When the {{families}} finally meet for the eventual “pamamanhikan” at the palatial Fuentebella residence, what starts as a civilized encounter between two families escalates into a hilarious rich-versus-poor mano-a-mano where Tracy's grandfather (Jaime Fabregas) insulted the Polotan's family, {{a scenario that}} turns the mansion into a madhouse of outlandish proportions which resulted in Rock and Tracy's separation. Rock got depressed and did not leave his room for three days. [...] He was confronted by his mother Rose, saying that life must go on. Rose thinks her son is still young for fatherhood, so she is {{not in favor of}} the marriage. Nick thinks the family would be in shame if Tracy will raise a child with no father, so he wants the wedding to push through as soon as possible. Elaine, who also got pregnant at a young age does not want her daughter to experience a forced marriage and get trapped in a loveless marriage as <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> and her husband, Nick. Elaine suggested {{that it would be better}} if Tracey would just go to the USA and give birth there, but before Tracy's departure, Rock was able to sneak into Tracy's room, and they elope. The two then sent an MMS to their families stating that they got married in the City hall. The two parties become so depressed because of Rock and Tracey's decision. Elaine seems to be disappointed with Nick. She thinks that Nick is not a good father to Tracy so their daughter grew up to be imperfect person. She decides to leave, but on her way out of the estate, Nick stops her and professes his undying love, stating that it would be best if they will try to start again. On the other hand, Rose and Pol also renew their love. Meanwhile, Brent (Coleta), Rock's best friend who is a closeted gay and is secretly in love with Rock, professes his love when they were drunk but the two remain best friends. In the end, the two families are able to accept the fate of Rock and Tracy who become parents at 19. The movie ends with the cast singing [...] "Pag-Ibig", and [...] "I Do Bidoo Bidoo".|$|E
