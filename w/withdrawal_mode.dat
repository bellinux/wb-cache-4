50|$|After {{the break}} through by General Patton's tanks, the 327th {{proceeded}} {{to the north}} sector of the Bastogne theater of operations. There, 2nd Battalion was involved in clearing Champs after a German armored element broke through paratrooper lines. Companies A and C suffered intense casualties and were consolidated into one company call ACE. Later, the 327 made an open field maneuver against armored enemy troops east of Foy, which helped secure that village. The ferocity and speed of the open-field attack surprised the Germans and the paratrooper regiments on the flanks of the attack. German forces attacked the flank and surrounded ACE Company in Bois Jacques. After that, the enemy was primarily in <b>withdrawal</b> <b>mode</b> back to Germany.|$|E

40|$|It is {{noteworthy}} that while modernisation, together with population ageing, has happened in Western countries for a rather long period of time, China must confront the challenges of an ageing population before it really becomes an advanced industrial society. Facing rapid societal changes, citizens may react differently to this process. By conducting questionnaire surveys with 445 elders in Wuhan, China, this study examines Chinese older adults' individual modernity modes and reveals its socio-demographic correlates. The results show that facing rapid changes in societal modernisation, participants have reacted differently to this process, with 23. 8 per cent of Chinese older participants using an accommodation mode, 27. 0 per cent using a resistance mode, 13. 3 per cent using a <b>withdrawal</b> <b>mode</b> and 36. 2 per cent using a coping mode. In addition, socio-demographic factors such as urban-rural residence, age, gender, socio-economic status, living arrangement and daily activities {{have been identified as}} significant correlates of Chinese older participants' individual modernity modes. It is further suggested that governments at all levels should allow for options and opportunities for older people to align themselves in the modernisation process by removing the barriers that may hinder their integration and empowerment efforts. While it is important to respect older adults' different responses in the face of modernisation, their participation in societies should be encouraged and respected by the wider society in the context of modernisation.

One's {{sense of identity}} dissolves to some extent, bringing about disorientation, but also the possibility of new perspectives. Turner posits that, if liminality {{is regarded as a}} time and place of <b>withdrawal</b> from normal <b>modes</b> of social action, it potentially {{can be seen as a}} period of scrutiny for central values and axioms of the culture where it occurs. - one where normal limits to thought, self-understanding, and behavior are undone. In such situations, “the very structure of society is temporarily suspended” ...|$|R

Background. Prescription opioids are the most frequently misused class of prescription drug among young adults aged 18 – 25, yet trajectories of opioidmisuse and escalation are understudied. We sought tomodel opioidmisuse patterns and relationships between opioidmisuse, sociodemographic factors, and other substance uses. Methods. Participants were 575 young adults age 16 – 25 who had misused opioids in the last 90 days. Latent class analysis was performed with models based on years of misuse, recency of misuse, and alternate modes of administration within the past 12 months, 3 months, and 30 days. Results. Four latent classes emerged that were differentially associated with heroin, cocaine, andmethamphetamine use, tranquilizer misuse, daily opioidmisuse, and opioid <b>withdrawal.</b> Alternate <b>modes</b> of administering opioids were associated with increased risk for these outcomes. Sociodemographic factors, homelessness, prescription history, and history of parental drug use {{were significantly associated with}} riskier opioid misus...|$|R

Young adults who reported more debilitating experiences as children and adolescents misused opioids longer and engaged in higher risk alternate modes of administering opioids. Data on decisions both to use and to alter a drug’s form can be combined to describe patterns of misuse over time and predict important risk behaviors...|$|R
5000|$|Jungians {{have often}} seen the {{individuation}} process of self-realization as taking place within a liminal space. 'Individuation {{begins with a}} <b>withdrawal</b> from normal <b>modes</b> of socialisation, epitomized by {{the breakdown of the}} persona...liminality'. Thus [...] "what Turner's concept of social liminality does for status in society, Jung...does for the movement of the person through the life process of individuation". Individuation {{can be seen as a}} [...] "movement through liminal space and time, from disorientation to integration....What takes place in the dark phase of liminality is a process of breaking down...in the interest of [...] "making whole" [...] one's meaning, purpose and sense of relatedness once more'" [...] As an archetypal figure, [...] "the trickster is a symbol of the liminal state itself, and of its permanent accessibility as a source of recreative power".|$|R
