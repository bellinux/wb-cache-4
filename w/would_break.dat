5|$|I {{was just}} numbing, numbing, numbing myself then {{sleeping}} it off, then getting on stage, killing it in pain, then getting off and smoking, smoking, smoking, {{not knowing what}} pain was. Fuck, if I know what hurts the most, you know? I <b>would</b> <b>break</b> the habit and it would sneak back in and I <b>would</b> <b>break</b> it and sneak back in.|$|E
5|$|In Abels' view, Æthelred's sons {{attempted}} to shame Alfred into handing over the lands they claimed {{so as to}} strengthen {{their position in the}} inevitable battle that <b>would</b> <b>break</b> out over the succession when Alfred died, and the Langandene assembly was Alfred's riposte.|$|E
5|$|Mundhir was {{the last}} {{important}} Ghassanid ruler; in 584, the Byzantines <b>would</b> <b>break</b> up the Ghassanid federation. A capable and successful military leader, his rule also saw the strengthening of Monophysitism and a cultural flowering among the Arabs under his rule.|$|E

5|$|An {{extreme example}} of an {{equatorial}} bulge is found on the star Regulus A (α Leonis A). The equator of this star has a measured rotational velocity of 317±3km/s. This corresponds to a rotation period of 15.9 hours, which is 86% of the velocity at which the star <b>would</b> <b>break</b> apart. The equatorial radius of this star is 32% larger than polar radius. Other rapidly rotating stars include Alpha Arae, Pleione, Vega and Achernar.|$|E
5|$|On July 22, 2014, the Toronto Maple Leafs signed Booth to {{a one-year}} {{contract}} worth $1.1 million. He scored the only shootout goal in the first preseason game on September 22, 2014, which led the Toronto Maple Leafs to victory. Booth <b>would</b> <b>break</b> his foot shortly afterwards and miss the opening few months of the season.|$|E
5|$|Peace would {{continue}} {{between the two}} states until 1645, when a long war over Crete <b>would</b> <b>break</b> out. Cyprus itself remained under Ottoman rule until 1878, when it was ceded to Britain as a protectorate. Ottoman sovereignty continued until the outbreak of World War I, when the island was annexed by Britain, becoming a crown colony in 1925.|$|E

5|$|Pre-orders of Blue Dragon bundled with {{a limited}} edition Xbox 360 Core system were sold out in Japan well before the December 7, 2006 release date. Microsoft and Mistwalker {{initially}} hoped to sell over 200,000 copies, which <b>would</b> <b>break</b> their record for sales of an Xbox 360 game in Japan. The game did manage the goal, with almost exactly 200,000 copies sold as of December 27, 2007. Creator Hironobu Sakaguchi was pleased the game sold {{as well as it}} did.|$|E
5|$|While in Williamsburg, Timberlake and Ostenaco {{attended}} {{a dinner party}} at William & Mary College; that evening Ostenaco {{said he would like}} to meet the king of England. Although he feared the trip <b>would</b> <b>break</b> him financially, Timberlake agreed to arrange such a trip and meeting for him. In May 1762, Timberlake, Sumter, and three distinguished Cherokee leaders, including Ostenaco, departed for London.|$|E
5|$|While {{training}} for the World Championships in Tokyo, Sacramone tore her Achilles tendon. She returned to the U.S. immediately for surgery. However, the team kept her name on the roster, and she was given a gold medal despite not competing. This gave her the most World Championships medals of any female American gymnast, with ten. Simone Biles <b>would</b> <b>break</b> that record in 2015.|$|E
50|$|The Bedourie oven is an Australian {{adaptation}} of the camp oven (Dutch oven). Drovers working on Bedourie Station, in western Queensland, found that the heavy cast iron camp ovens they used for cooking <b>would</b> often <b>break</b> {{as a result of}} falling from their pack horses. The Bedourie oven was developed in response to this problem. Made from mild steel, it was lighter and less brittle than cast iron, and <b>would</b> not <b>break</b> if dropped.|$|R

5|$|Bloomsbury {{invested}} £10million in {{an attempt}} to keep the book's contents secure until 21 July, the release date. Arthur Levine, U.S. editor of the Harry Potter series, denied distributing any copies of Deathly Hallows in advance for press review, but two U.S. papers published early reviews anyway. There was speculation that some shops <b>would</b> <b>break</b> the embargo and distribute copies of the book early, as the penalty imposed for previous instalments—that the distributor would not be supplied with any further copies of the series—would no longer be a deterrent.|$|E
5|$|Bucanero and Olímpico {{teamed up}} to unsuccessfully {{challenge}} the visiting Hiroshi Tanahashi and Shinsuke Nakamura for the IWGP World Tag Team Championship. After Atlantis turned heel and joined the group, they became known as Los Guerreros de la Atlántida, it was teased that Bucanero <b>would</b> <b>break</b> up with Guerrero but Bucanero stayed with the group and Los Guerreros feuded with Perro Aguayo, Jr.'s Los Perros del Mal faction into 2006. At the end of April, he teamed with Tarzan Boy to win a double hair vs. hair match against Mr. Águila and Damián 666 in the main event of the 50. Aniversario de Arena México show.|$|E
5|$|Cicadas use {{a variety}} of {{strategies}} to evade predators. Large cicadas can fly rapidly to escape if disturbed. Many are extremely well camouflaged to evade predators such as birds that hunt by sight. As well as being coloured like tree bark, they are disruptively patterned to break up their outlines; their partly transparent wings are held over the body and pressed close to the substrate. The wings are antireflective, avoiding the typical shine of insect cuticle, which <b>would</b> <b>break</b> the cicada's camouflage. Some cicada species play dead when threatened.|$|E

5|$|Demolition {{began in}} August 1967. The {{contract}} {{was awarded to}} Nordman Construction after an unsuccessful tender process. The company brought in the Magnus II, a floating crane with a lifting capacity of 400tons, which could remove {{all but two of}} the spans. These longer spans were pulled sideways off the piers, expecting that they <b>would</b> <b>break</b> into manageable pieces under their own weight. They proved stronger than this and remained intact, needing to be broken up in the river, with much sinking into the bed instead of being recovered.|$|E
5|$|In 1904 {{she wrote}} Je Me Souviens (I Remember), an {{intensely}} personal prose poem {{about their relationship}} which was presented as a single handwritten copy to Vivien {{in an attempt to}} win her back. They reconciled and traveled together to Lesbos, where they lived happily together for a short time and talked about starting a school of poetry for women like the one which Sappho, according to tradition, had founded on Lesbos some 2,500 years before. However, Vivien soon got a letter from her lover Baroness Hélène van Zuylen and went to Constantinople thinking she <b>would</b> <b>break</b> up with her in person. Vivien planned to meet Barney in Paris afterward but instead stayed with the Baroness and this time, the breakup was permanent.|$|E
5|$|On {{arriving}} in McMurdo Sound on 29 January 1908, Nimrods progress southward to the Discovery base at Hut Point {{was blocked by}} frozen sea. Shackleton decided {{to wait a few}} days {{in the hope that the}} ice <b>would</b> <b>break</b> up. During this delay, second officer Aeneas Mackintosh suffered an accident that led to the loss of his right eye. After emergency surgery by Marshall and Mackay, he was forced to relinquish his shore party place and go back to New Zealand with Nimrod. He recovered sufficiently to return with the ship in the following season.|$|E

5|$|Ray of Light is {{the seventh}} studio album by American singer Madonna. It was {{released}} on February 22, 1998 by Maverick and Warner Bros. Records. After giving birth to her first child, Madonna started working on the album with producers Babyface and Patrick Leonard. Following failed sessions with them, Madonna pursued a new musical direction with English producer William Orbit. The recording took place over four months and experienced problems with Orbit's hardware arrangement, which <b>would</b> <b>break</b> down, and recording {{would have to be}} delayed until they could be repaired.|$|E
5|$|Satchel {{was easier}} to catch. He could throw it in a quart cup. But Rogan {{was all over the}} plate—high, low, inside, outside. He'd walk five-six men, but he didn't give up many runs. Bullet had a little more steam on the ball than Paige—and he had a better-breaking curve. The batters thought it was a fastball heading for them and they would jump back from the plate and all of a sudden, it <b>would</b> <b>break</b> sharply for a strike. I would rank him with today's best. I have never seen a pitcher like him, and I have caught some of the best {{pitchers}} in the business.|$|E
5|$|The main {{advantage}} of composite bows over self bows (made {{from a single}} piece of wood) is their combination of smaller size with high power. They are therefore more convenient than self bows when the archer is mobile, as from horseback, or from a chariot. Almost all composite bows are also recurve bows as the shape curves away from the archer; this design gives higher draw-weight {{in the early stages of}} the archer's draw, storing somewhat more total energy for a given final draw-weight. It would be possible to make a wooden bow that has the same shape, length and draw-weight as a traditional composite bow, but it could not store the energy, and <b>would</b> <b>break</b> before full draw.|$|E
