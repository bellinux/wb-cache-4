5|$|A noisy species, {{the female}} has the deep quack stereotypically {{associated}} with ducks. Male mallards {{make a sound}} phonetically {{similar to that of}} the female, a typical quack, but it is a deep and raspy and can also sound like breeeeze. When incubating a nest, or when offspring are present, females vocalise differently, making a call that sounds like a truncated version of the usual quack. They hiss if the nest or offspring are threatened or interfered with. When taking off, the <b>wings</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> mallard produce a characteristic faint whistling noise.|$|E

5|$|Art {{historian}} Robert Koch remarked in 1988 on {{the similarity}} of provenance, material, technique, tone and colour of the four works described by Eastlake. He proposed that they were intended as <b>wings</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> five-part polyptych altarpiece. Based on the format of Bouts' 1464–67 Altar of Holy Sacrament, whose four wing panels are the same length as The Entombment, he believes the altarpiece would have comprised a large central panel with four works half its length and width positioned two at either side. His speculative reconstruction places The Entombment on the upper right-hand wing, above the Adoration.|$|E
5|$|The RLM had {{acquired}} {{an interest in}} rocket boosters fitted {{for the sake of}} simplicity below the <b>wings</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> heavily loaded bomber to cut down the length of runway needed for takeoff. Once in the air the booster canisters would be jettisoned by parachute for reuse. The firm of Hellmuth Walter, at Kiel, handled this development. The first standing trials and tests flights of the Walter HWK 109-500 Starthilfe liquid-fueled boosters were held in 1937 at Neuhardenberg with test pilot Erich Warsitz at the controls of Heinkel He 111E bearing civil registration D-AMUE.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} surviving {{mention of}} the work appears in 1841, when scholars believed the two panels were <b>wings</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> lost triptych. The Metropolitan Museum of Art acquired the diptych in 1933. At that time, the work was attributed to Jan's brother Hubert because key areas formally resembled pages of the Turin-Milan Hours, which were then believed to be of Hubert's hand. On the evidence of technique and the style of dress of the figures, the majority of scholars believe the panels are late works by Jan van Eyck, executed in the early 1430s and finished after his death. Other art historians hold that van Eyck painted the panels around the early 1420s and attribute the weaker passages to a younger van Eyck's relative inexperience.|$|E

5|$|The public façade of {{the palace}} faces {{directly}} onto a town square and {{takes the form of}} two low, symmetrical, quadrant wings which flank the forward-reaching <b>wings</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> small central corps de logis, thus forming a semi-circular cour d'honneur (see key 1). The southern of the two quadrant wings is terminated by the onion-domed chapel, while the northern wing contained the kitchens and servants' quarters (see keys 2, 1 and 13). The only decoration comes from the simple classical pediments above the windows. This façade, that most readily seen from the town, presents a decorous and impassive public face {{with one of the most}} architecturally severe elevations {{of the palace}} (see illustration right).|$|E

25|$|The large flat wooden {{ceiling in}} the Church of St Michael, Hildesheim of c. 1200 has {{the space to}} include a complex {{iconographic}} scheme based around the tree, which encompasses Adam and Eve, the Prophets and the Four Evangelists. Panel paintings are rare, but a German example of c. 1470 (Darmstadt) shows a Tree {{on the outside of}} the <b>wings</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> triptych. A large Polish baroque oil by Michael Willmann (1678, Kościół Wniebowzięcia NMP, Krzeszów) shows a typically crowded Baroque apotheosis scene, with thin tendrils lacing round the figures, but not supporting them.|$|E

He was promoted to major in May 1943 and was awarded the gold <b>wings</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> naval aviator at Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida in October 1943. His next assignment was as a flight instructor at Marine Corps Air Station Edenton, North Carolina. He remained there until December 1944, when he returned to duty in the Pacific Area and assumed command of Marine Bomber Squadron 443. He later served as the executive officer of Marine Aircraft Group 61 (MAG-61) in the consolidation of the Northern Solomons and the recapture of the Philippines.|$|E
25|$|The regiment's {{coat of arms}} {{included}} a yellow shield divided by a diagonal red stripe with the shield of the New York National Guard's 51st Machine Gun Squadron in the canton. The <b>wings</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> windmill were depicted in red in the lower left below the stripe, while a red star was located in the upper right above the stripe. The star represented the regiment's initial organization in Texas, the stripe symbolized its conversion to artillery, and the canton represented the regiment's initial composition, as {{more than half of}} its personnel in the interwar period were ex-members of the 51st Machine Gun Squadron. The Organized Reserve's Minuteman crest was located above the shield.|$|E

People from ordinary medieval life are also portrayed; a butcher, a knight, a juggler, a young woman performing her toilet, and both a man and woman answering the call of nature. All together the panels portray {{the history of the world}} and ordinary life as known and imagined in the Middle Ages.|$|E
