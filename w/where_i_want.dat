I was just so excited when I heard this one, 'cause it's the epitome of <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to go with the future.|$|E

500|$|Clinton Heylin {{and writer}} Christopher Ricks {{discussed}} Dylan's restlessness in the song. Heylin {{said that in}} [...] "Ballad of Easy Rider", co-written by Dylan and Roger McGuinn two years earlier, Dylan claimed he was content to watch while [...] "The river flows, flows to the sea/Wherever it flows, that's <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to be"; by contrast, in [...] "Watching the River Flow", Dylan writes {{that he wants to}} be moving, wishing he was [...] "back in the city/Instead of this old bank of sand". Ricks found Dylan's unsettledness at odds with the implied bucolic notion of watching the river flow. For Ricks, the vocal phrasing and the musical arrangements clash with the lyrics; the [...] "choppy" [...] rhythms and [...] "stroppy stomping" [...] of the backing track, disrupt the theme of contentedly watching the river. He noted that two of the verses begin with [...] "People disagreeing", introducing conflict into the song, and concluded that [...] "Watching the River Flow" [...] is [...] "tarred with a realism that qualifies and complicates the lure of the lazy".|$|E

By the next month she started posting a number of images on social media website Instagram, where she hinted at possible songwriters and collaborators with hashtag captions. Two months later, Madonna posted a selfie where she talked about working with American DJ Diplo. Madonna had invited him to her annual Oscar party, but he was unable to attend. They eventually started talking about music through texts and decided to collaborate on the album. In an interview with Idolator, Diplo explained that Madonna had asked him to provide his [...] "craziest record" [...] for the album. Together they wrote and recorded seven songs and Diplo added that [...] " [...] was up for anything. I love when an artist gives a producer the confidence he needs to work with them, and [...] was very open-minded to my ideas. Those records are gonna be crazy-sounding.

Novakovic, a performing arts college graduate, was cast in the role of Natasha. The actress had been studying architecture at university, before she chose to move into acting. Shortly after her casting {{was announced}}, Novakovic revealed that the role of Natasha was her first acting job and that while she would always be interested in architecture, she really wanted to enjoy the experience on Neighbours. Novakovic moved from Sydney to Melbourne, where Neighbours is filmed, for the role. She is three years older than the character she portrays. In 2011, Novakovic revealed she is still happy with the career choice she made, stating [...] "I enjoy what I'm doing now a lot more than studying, because this is <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to be. [...] The best thing for me is that I enjoy going to work every day and have some great friends there, including the crew. It's awesome to do something you love every single day." ...|$|E
500|$|Murs' fourth studio album, Never Been Better, was {{released}} on 20 November 2014. Murs stated that he wanted the album {{to have a more}} serious tone and less of a [...] "cheeky" [...] style owing to him turning 30 years old. Travie McCoy and Demi Lovato feature on the songs [...] "Wrapped Up" [...] and [...] "Up", respectively. The former is a funk track which whereby Murs suggestively sings [...] "You got the lock, I got the key/ You know the rest, you know just <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to be," [...] while the latter is a folk song about the [...] "merits of perseverance". The song [...] "Stick with Me" [...] addresses loneliness, while the piano-ballad [...] "Tomorrow" [...] documents {{how difficult it is to}} hold onto [...] "fleeting private moments" [...] when in the public eye. Murs co-wrote the track [...] "Let Me In" [...] with Paul Weller, which was described by Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph as [...] "unexpected". Digital Spy writer Amy Davison likened the disco track [...] "Did You Miss Me?" [...] to Justin Timberlake's song [...] "Take Back the Night".|$|E

However, she had another project in mind – {{developing}} the screenplay for the Andrew Sean Greer novel, The Impossible Lives of Greta Wells. Madonna decided to split her time between writing the screenplay and writing songs for the new album. In February 2014, Madonna confirmed that she had already begun working on her thirteenth studio album, saying: [...] "I'm {{right now in the}} process of talking to various co-writers and producers and talking about <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to go with my music". Working with a number of collaborators on the album, Madonna encountered problems in keeping a cohesive sound and creative direction for Rebel Heart, since her previous efforts had been produced with only a small core group of people developing the music. She observed that a lot of the people she enlisted would not stay in one city at a time due to their different projects, resulting in Madonna not finishing her songs. [...] "So, I was just the person standing there with a clipboard in the headlights, going 'Ok!' A little bit like a school teacher," [...] she admitted.|$|E
5000|$|In a 2000 {{interview}} Orzabal {{commented on}} his influences for the album: [...] "I {{started out with}} an absolute concrete vision of <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to go so I started with a very different rhythm approach, with drum and bass/jungle...and I ended {{up with something that}} wasn't the original plan." ...|$|R

500|$|In a February 1999 {{interview}} with music journalist Touré, D'Angelo discussed the album and elaborated {{on the events}} that had preceded its release, explaining how he had no initial plan for a follow-up. He also discussed his attempt to focus on his original inspiration to produce music, stating [...] "The sound and feel of my music {{are going to be}} affected by what motivates me to do it". On his visit to South Carolina, D'Angelo stated that he [...] "went through this runnel, through gospel, blues, and a lot of old soul, old James Brown, early, early Sly and the Family Stone, and a lot of Jimi Hendrix", and [...] "I learned a lot about music, myself, and <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to go musically". In the same interview, he cited the deaths of rappers Tupac Shakur and The Notorious B.I.G. as having a great effect on him during the period. In another {{interview with}} Touré, D'Angelo said that he had lost his enthusiasm after Brown Sugars reception and [...] "was gettin' jaded, lookin' at what go on in the business".

Gordon described Martha's persona stating: [...] "Martha's pretty feisty {{all of the time}} but in the sense of always fighting for what's right and keeping up a strong perspective on <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to go, things like that." [...] Gordon says that she feels Martha always makes bad choices when it comes to her love life, because she never knows what she wants. Gordon said that Martha is [...] "messed up" [...] but with a [...] "warm side" [...] to her persona, and that overall Martha is [...] "fun loving, easy going girl-next-door" [...] type character. Of her portrayal, Gordon says that she enjoys the challenge of playing Martha because she gets to shout a lot when showing her crazy and fun side. Gordon later said that [...] "There will always {{be a little bit of}} trouble attached to Martha. She will always be a little bit mischievous". On the character's appearance, RTÉ said [...] "Martha was a self-confessed tomboy, loving sport and anything physical. Now she has grown into a stylish woman with great taste in clothes which range from shorts and strappy tops to gorgeous summer dresses." ...|$|E

[...] Deryck and McCaslin would often argue about the songs' sound and how the bass and guitar should progress through the songs. These arguments were mostly {{because of the fact that}} Deryck wanted the songs to be [...] "more powerful", while McCaslin wanted to have more variety in the sound.|$|R
2500|$|James Abbott Whistler {{was born}} in Lowell, Massachusetts, on July 10, 1834, the first child of Anna Matilda McNeill and George Washington Whistler.

(Lehrer has stated that he invented the Jell-O Shot during this time, as a means of circumventing liquor restrictions.)

During the break, I went up to Stevie and told him that. I didn't try to sneak around and hide it from the bass player —I didn't know if he was listening or not. I just really wanted to be in that band. I sat in that night and it sounded great." [...] Almost three months later, when Vaughan offered Shannon the position, he readily accepted.|$|E

Gunn wanted to give the sequel a different structure from the first film, since [...] "one of the reasons people like Guardians is because it's fresh and different, so the second one will be fresh and different from the first one." [...] Before starting on the script, Gunn hoped to further explore Drax the Destroyer, Nebula, Kraglin, and the Collector, and expand on Xandarian, Kree, Krylorian, and Ravager culture. He also hoped to introduce more female characters in the sequel, though wanted to avoid including [...] "earthlings" [...] such as Carol Danvers, as well as Novas Richard Rider or Sam Alexander, saying, [...] "I think Quill being the only earthling is important.
