50|$|Ash yellows is host-specific and {{it mostly}} attacks ash trees, {{specifically}} white ash (Fraxinus americana) and green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica). Although this disease mainly attacks ash trees, {{it has also}} been found to target lilacs. All ages and sizes of ashes are vulnerable to infection and symptoms will occur within three years of infection. Some of these symptoms include progressive loss of vitality, subnormal growth, and leaves that fail to reach normal size and are often light green to chlorotic.Additional symptoms include branch dieback, cracks in the bark, early color change in the fall, and premature death of trees. This disease is often diagnosed by the presence of a distinct symptom known as <b>witches</b> <b>broom.</b> <b>Witches</b> <b>broom</b> occurs when there is an overgrowth of the branches of the host, resulting in a clumps of branches that resemble the head of a broom.

50|$|Although spores from diseased juniper plants infect healthy hosts in the fall, {{symptoms}} {{are usually not}} seen until late winter or early spring. Often the first symptom noted is the browning of needle tips as the disease invades young, vulnerable tissue. New shoots that are normally yellow-green in color begin to turn to red brown and then ashen gray as they slowly die from the fungal disease. The infection progresses inward from the tips of branches and forms small lesions at points where infected tissue meets healthy tissue. Lesions then girdle limbs less than one centimeter in diameter, effectively killing the entire branch.

50|$|Ash yellows (Candidatus phytoplasma fraxini) is {{a disease}} in ash trees caused by phytoplasma, a {{specialized}} group of bacteria which lack a cell wall and attack the phloem of trees. This disease is relatively new so the disease cycle is mostly unknown, although {{it is thought that}} insect vectors are used as the mode of transmission. The disease is difficult to diagnose because some symptoms match those of stressed environmental conditions such as drought, flooding, or shallow soil. When trees become infected they can survive for many years or immediately die depending on the environmental conditions and health of the tree.

40|$|Infectious {{forms of}} <b>witch's</b> <b>broom</b> {{caused by a}} virus, were {{observed}} in Crotalaria spp. and other leguminous crops in Indonesia, and in Rubus idaeus and some herbaceous ornamentals, mainly Trqpaeolum majus, in the Netherlands. A {{detailed analysis of the}} abnormalities in Crotalaria and Tropaeolum was given. A plant infected during its early stages of development became a bushy dwarf. All potential buds developed into negatively geotropic sprouts and no flowers formed. A plant infected late had an almost normal growth habit, but inflorescences grew into complex leafy structures, thus producing broomy branch extremities. The younger their buds at the moment of infection, the more abnormal were the flowers. Thus a series of progressive floral abnormalities from a normal flower up to a completely vegetative leafy branch could be selected. The series of deviations was called antholysis. These abnormalities supported the theory that morphologically the flower must be regarded as a modified leafy branch. Large-scale virus-induced antholysis demonstrated the morphogenetic antagonism between floral initiation and vegetative growth. Many similar virus diseases were brought together in a group of <b>witch's</b> <b>broom</b> virus diseases. Other factors may cause related aberrations: certain parasitic plants, fungi, bacteria, mites and insects.

40|$|Chrysanthemum (Chrysanthemum indicum L.) is an {{important}} floriculture crop grown {{in different parts of}} Karnataka, India for its beautiful cut flowers. Recently, there has been a decline in flower quality due to major pests and diseases. A field survey conducted during 2012 - 2013 in chrysanthemum-growing areas revealed the occurrence of virescence with an incidence of 5 to 10 % in nearly 6 to 8 ha of chrysanthemum fields in Mandya and Mysore districts. Symptoms including malformed flowers with greenish florets and reduced flower size and floral virescence with sepaloidy were observed. Diseased leaves and flower parts were collected and used for identification of the causative agent. Ten samples (6 symptomatic, 2 healthy, and 2 phytoplasma-associated with phyllody of Catheranthus roseus as positive control) were used for total genomic DNA isolation using GenElute Plant Genomic DNA Miniprep Kit (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and the DNA was used as template to amplify the phytoplasma-specific 16 SrDNA gene using P 1 /P 7 primers followed by nested PCR using R 16 F 2 n/R 16 R 2 primers (Gundersen and Lee 1996). The expected 1. 25 -kb amplicon was detected only with DNA from symptomatic and positive control samples. Nested PCR products of all six phytoplasma-associated samples were purified and sequenced from both the directions using a ABIx 370 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Waltham, MA). The 16 SrDNA sequences were aligned using CodonCode Aligner (Centerville, MA) and analyzed by BLASTn. The analysis revealed that all six sequences shared 100 % identity with Cassava <b>witches</b> <b>broom</b> (KM 280680. 1) and Peanut <b>witches</b> <b>broom</b> (JX 403944. 1) phytoplasma. The in-silico RFLP pattern of F 2 n/R 2 primed region of 16 SrDNA gene analyzed by using iPhyClassifier (Zhao et al. 2009) revealed that the sequence shared 99. 8 % nucleotide sequence similarity with coefficient value of 1. 00 to the reference strain RFLP pattern of 16 Sr group II, subgroup A (Peanut <b>witches</b> <b>broom</b> phytoplasma; Accession No. L 33765. 1). Based on 16 SrDNA sequences and in-silico RFLP analysis, the phytoplasma associated with the chrysanthemum virescence was identified as a member of 16 SrII-A group. The representative sequence was deposited in GenBank with Accession Number KP 027534. 1. Phytoplasma associated with little leaf and <b>witches</b> <b>broom</b> of chrysanthemum have been reported earlier from India and were assigned to groups 16 SrI-A and 16 SrII, respectively (Kumar et al. 2012; Raj et al. 2007). Chrysanthemum virescence phytoplasma belonging to Candidatus phytoplasma aurantifolia has been reported from Japan and has not been assigned to any group (Naito et al. 2007). The occurrence of virescence is of great importance as it affects the overall productivity and quality of flowers, which reduces the market value of chrysanthemum. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a group 16 SrII-A phytoplasma associated with chrysanthemum virescence in India...|$|E

40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from Elsevier via [URL] geographically diverse isolates of the <b>witches?</b> <b>broom</b> pathogen Moniliophthora perniciosa were cultured on nutrient medium. They included six C-biotype strains (from five tropical American countries) differing in virulence on the cacao plant Theobroma cacao, two Brazilian S-biotypes, infective on solanaceous hosts, and an Ecuadorian L-biotype, infective on certain lianas. Mycelial growth rates and morphologies differed considerably between the strains, but no characters were observed to correlate with virulence or biotype. In plant inoculations using spores from basidiocarp-producing cultures, one C-biotype caused symptoms on tomato, an S biotype host. Mycelial proteomes of the nine strains were analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2 -DE), and 619 gel spots were indexed on all replicate gels {{of at least one}} strain. Multivariate analysis of these gel spots discriminated the L-biotype, but not the S-biotypes, from the remaining strains. The proteomic similarity of the S and C-biotypes could be seen as consistent with the limited host adaptation seen in our plant infections. Sequences from tandem mass spectrometry of tryptic peptides from major 2 -DE spots were matched with Moniliophthora genome and transcript sequences on the NCBI and <b>Witches?</b> <b>Broom</b> Disease Transcriptome Atlas databases.
