5|$|In a {{large-scale}} study of programs where bupropion {{was used for}} smoking cessation or treatment of depression, no <b>withdrawal</b> <b>symptoms</b> were observed. As of 2002 there were two case reports of people experiencing <b>withdrawal</b> <b>symptoms</b> when discontinuing buproprion taken to aid smoking cessation; the prescribing information states that dose tapering is not required when discontinuing treatment for smoking cessation.|$|E
5|$|The use of {{alprazolam}} {{during pregnancy}} {{is associated with}} congenital abnormalities, and use in the last trimester may cause fetal drug dependence and <b>withdrawal</b> <b>symptoms</b> in the post-natal period as well as neonatal flaccidity and respiratory problems. However, in long-term users of benzodiazepines, abrupt discontinuation due to concerns of teratogenesis has {{a high risk of}} causing extreme <b>withdrawal</b> <b>symptoms</b> and a severe rebound effect of the underlying mental health disorder. Spontaneous abortions may also result from abrupt withdrawal of psychotropic medications, including benzodiazepines.|$|E
5|$|A {{benzodiazepine}} dependence {{occurs in}} {{about one-third of}} individuals who are treated with benzodiazepines for longer than 4 weeks, which typically results in tolerance and benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome when the dose is reduced too rapidly. Midazolam infusions may induce tolerance and a withdrawal syndrome {{in a matter of}} days. The risk factors for dependence include dependent personality, use of a benzodiazepine that is short-acting, high potency and long-term use of benzodiazepines. <b>Withdrawal</b> <b>symptoms</b> from midazolam can range from insomnia and anxiety to seizures and psychosis. <b>Withdrawal</b> <b>symptoms</b> can sometimes resemble a person’s underlying condition. Gradual reduction of midazolam after regular use can minimise withdrawal and rebound effects. Tolerance and the resultant withdrawal syndrome may be due to receptor down-regulation and GABAA receptor alterations in gene expression, which causes long-term changes in the function of the GABAergic neuronal system.|$|E
50|$|The CIWA-Ar is {{actually}} a shortened, yet improved version of the CIWA, geared towards objectifying alcohol <b>withdrawal</b> <b>symptom</b> severity. It retains validity, usefulness and reliability between raters.|$|R
50|$|Depersonalization {{has been}} {{described}} by some as a desirable state, particularly by those that have experienced it under the influence of mood-altering recreational drugs. It is an effect of dissociatives and psychedelics, as well as possible side effect of caffeine, alcohol, amphetamine, and cannabis. It is a classic <b>withdrawal</b> <b>symptom</b> from many drugs.|$|R
50|$|Some {{drugs can}} induce blepharospasm, {{such as those}} used to treat Parkinson's disease, as well as {{sensitivity}} to hormone treatments, including estrogen-replacement therapy for women going through menopause. Blepharospasm {{can also be a}} <b>symptom</b> of acute <b>withdrawal</b> from benzodiazepines. In addition to blepharospasm being a benzodiazepine <b>withdrawal</b> <b>symptom,</b> prolonged use of benzodiazepines can induce blepharospasm and is a known risk factor for the development of blepharospasm.|$|R
5|$|Baclofen, a GABAB {{receptor}} agonist, {{is under}} {{study for the}} treatment of alcoholism. A 2015 systematic review concluded that there is insufficient evidence for the use of baclofen for <b>withdrawal</b> <b>symptoms</b> in alcoholism. There is tentative data supporting baclofen in alcohol dependence however further trials are needed as of 2013.|$|E
5|$|Chronic {{users of}} {{benzodiazepine}} medication who are given midazolam experience reduced therapeutic effects of midazolam, due to tolerance to benzodiazepines. Prolonged infusions with midazolam {{results in the}} development of tolerance; if midazolam is given for a few days or more a withdrawal syndrome can occur. Therefore, preventing a withdrawal syndrome requires that a prolonged infusion be gradually withdrawn, and sometimes, continued tapering of dose with an oral long-acting benzodiazepine such as clorazepate dipotassium. When signs of tolerance to midazolam occur during intensive care unit sedation the addition of an opioid or propofol is recommended. <b>Withdrawal</b> <b>symptoms</b> can include irritability, abnormal reflexes, tremors, clonus, hypertonicity, delirium and seizures, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, tachycardia, hypertension, and tachypnea. In those with significant dependence, sudden discontinuation may result in <b>withdrawal</b> <b>symptoms</b> such as status epilepticus that may be fatal.|$|E
5|$|Dependent stage – At this stage, {{symptoms}} {{build up}} gradually. Hangover symptoms from excessive drinking may {{be confused with}} <b>withdrawal</b> <b>symptoms.</b> Many addicts will maintain their drinking to avoid withdrawal sickness, drinking small amounts frequently. They will try to hide their drinking problem from others and will avoid gross intoxication.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies using}} plasma {{cortisol}} estimations {{have suggested that}} hypothalmo-pituitary-axis (HPA) activation occurs in alcohol-dependent patients during alcohol withdrawal. The present study set out to confirm this finding using salivary cortisol assays, which are a better indicator of plasma free cortisol, the fraction which exerts its physiological effects. Nine alcohol dependent patients provided four saliva samples (at 10 a. m., 2 p. m., 6 p. m. and 10 p. m.) on days 1, 3 and 7 of a medically assisted alcohol withdrawal (corresponding to 1, 3 and 7 days following the last drink, respectively). <b>Withdrawal</b> <b>symptom</b> severity, craving and mood disturbance were also measured. A group of non-alcohol-dependent individuals, without psychiatric or medical disorder, gave four samples at the same times on one day only. Mean daily cortisol levels in our alcohol-dependent population, as calculated by the area under the curve (AUC), decreased significantly over time (mean AUC (nmol/l/hour) on day 1 = 149, on day 7 = 85. 7, p = 0. 009) and {{were significantly higher than}} controls on each day (mean AUC in controls = 28. 3, p = 0. 001). The cortisol response showed a similar temporal trend to <b>withdrawal</b> <b>symptom</b> severity and mood disturbance. This is consistent with previous studies measuring plasma cortisol in alcohol withdrawal. However, the magnitude of the effect in our study was greater, and in contrast to some previous studies, levels were far from normal by day 7. The comparatively low cortisol response in our one mildly dependent patient suggests {{that there may be a}} relationship between dependence severity and the size of the cortisol response to withdrawal. Salivary cortisol sampling could prove to be a useful prognostic tool, with implications for subsequent <b>withdrawal</b> <b>symptom</b> severity, mood disturbances, risk of relapse and alcohol-related cognitive decline. There are implications for developing new treatments for alcohol withdrawal but more studies are needed...|$|R
5|$|Short-acting {{compounds}} have {{a median}} half-life of 1–12 hours. They have few residual effects if taken before bedtime, rebound insomnia may occur upon discontinuation, {{and they might}} cause daytime <b>withdrawal</b> <b>symptoms</b> such as next day rebound anxiety with prolonged usage. Examples are brotizolam, midazolam, and triazolam.|$|E
5|$|Alprazolam {{and other}} benzodiazepines may also cause the {{development}} of physical dependence, tolerance, and benzodiazepine <b>withdrawal</b> <b>symptoms</b> during rapid dose reduction or cessation of therapy after long-term treatment. There is a higher chance of withdrawal reactions if the drug is administered in a higher dosage than recommended, or if a person stops taking the medication altogether without slowly allowing the body to adjust to a lower-dosage regimen.|$|E
5|$|Discontinuation of benzodiazepines or abrupt {{reduction}} of the dose, even after a relatively short course of treatment (three to four weeks), may result in two groups of symptoms—rebound and withdrawal. Rebound symptoms are {{the return of the}} symptoms for which the patient was treated but worse than before. <b>Withdrawal</b> <b>symptoms</b> are the new symptoms that occur when the benzodiazepine is stopped. They are the main sign of physical dependence.|$|E
30|$|Median {{duration}} of mechanical ventilation was significantly reduced {{in the group}} subjected to the nurse-driven protocol: 4.8 [1.3 – 25.3] days versus 6 [1.1 – 80.5] days (p =  0.05). Mean total dose of midazolam was also reduced (17 vs 28  mg/kg, p =  0.05), and {{duration of}} sufentanil administration (112 vs 157  h, p =  0.05). We observed fewer <b>withdrawal’s</b> <b>symptoms</b> (14 vs 24  %, p =  0.09) in the period “after,” but the difference did not reach statistical significance.|$|R
5000|$|Certain medications, {{particularly}} contraceptive medications, can induce amenorrhoea in {{a healthy}} woman. The lack of menstruation usually begins shortly after beginning the medication and {{can take up to}} a year to resume after stopping a medication. Hormonal contraceptives that contain only progestogen like the oral contraceptive Micronor, and especially higher-dose formulations like the injectable Depo Provera commonly induce this side-effect. Extended cycle use of combined hormonal contraceptives also allow suppression of menstruation. Patients who use and then cease using contraceptives like the combined oral contraceptive pill may experience secondary amenorrhoea as a <b>withdrawal</b> <b>symptom.</b> The link is not well understood, as studies have found no difference in hormone levels between women who develop amenorrhoea as a <b>withdrawal</b> <b>symptom</b> following the cessation of OCOP use and women who experience secondary amenorrhoea because of other reasons. [...] New contraceptive pills, like continuous oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) which do not have the normal 7 days of placebo pills in each cycle, have been shown to increase rates of amenorrhoea in women. Studies show that women are most likely to experience amenorrhoea after 1 year of treatment with continuous OCP use.|$|R
25|$|Rebound anxiety, {{more severe}} than {{baseline}} anxiety, is also a common <b>withdrawal</b> <b>symptom</b> when discontinuing diazepam or other benzodiazepines. Diazepam is therefore only recommended for short-term therapy at the lowest possible dose owing to risks of severe withdrawal problems from low doses even after gradual reduction. The risk of pharmacological dependence on diazepam is significant, and patients experience <b>symptoms</b> of benzodiazepine <b>withdrawal</b> syndrome if it is taken for six weeks or longer. In humans, tolerance to the anticonvulsant effects of diazepam occurs frequently.|$|R
5|$|In a 1983 study, only 5% of {{patients}} who had abruptly stopped taking long-acting benzodiazepines after less than 8 months demonstrated <b>withdrawal</b> <b>symptoms,</b> but 43% {{of those who had}} been taking them for more than 8 months did. With alprazolam– a short-acting benzodiazepine– taken for 8 weeks, 65% {{of patients}} experienced significant rebound anxiety. To some degree, these older benzodiazepines are self-tapering.|$|E
5|$|Midazolam, {{when taken}} during the third {{trimester}} of pregnancy, may cause risk to the neonate, including benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome, with possible symptoms including hypotonia, apnoeic spells, cyanosis, and impaired metabolic responses to cold stress. Symptoms of hypotonia and the neonatal benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome {{have been reported to}} persist from hours to months after birth. Other neonatal <b>withdrawal</b> <b>symptoms</b> include hyperexcitability, tremor, and gastrointestinal upset (diarrhea or vomiting). Breastfeeding by mothers using midazolam is not recommended.|$|E
5|$|Severe acute <b>withdrawal</b> <b>symptoms</b> such as {{delirium}} tremens and seizures rarely occur after 1-week post cessation of alcohol. The acute withdrawal phase {{can be defined}} as lasting between one and three weeks. In the period of 3–6 weeks following cessation increased anxiety, depression, as well as sleep disturbance, is common; fatigue and tension can persist for up to 5 weeks as part of the post-acute withdrawal syndrome; about a quarter of alcoholics experience anxiety and depression for up to 2 years. These post-acute <b>withdrawal</b> <b>symptoms</b> have also been demonstrated in animal models of alcohol dependence and withdrawal. A kindling effect also occurs in alcoholics whereby each subsequent withdrawal syndrome is more severe than the previous withdrawal episode; this is due to neuroadaptations which occur as a result of periods of abstinence followed by re-exposure to alcohol. Individuals who have had multiple withdrawal episodes are more likely to develop seizures and experience more severe anxiety during withdrawal from alcohol than alcohol-dependent individuals without a history of past alcohol withdrawal episodes. The kindling effect leads to persistent functional changes in brain neural circuits as well as to gene expression. Kindling also results in the intensification of psychological symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. There are decision tools and questionnaires which help guide physicians in evaluating alcohol withdrawal. For example, the CIWA-Ar objectifies alcohol <b>withdrawal</b> <b>symptoms</b> in order to guide therapy decisions which allows for an efficient interview {{while at the same time}} retaining clinical usefulness, validity, and reliability, ensuring proper care for withdrawal patients, who can be in danger of death.|$|E
50|$|Among many vices, a vice {{relevant}} to the plot, is Harry's drinking. He is normally a shrewd, sophisticated and composed individual, but whenever drunk, he turns into an advocate of equality and betterment of the villagers, but regrets these thoughts when sober. When he chooses not to drink he hallucinates, as a <b>withdrawal</b> <b>symptom,</b> about a pink buffalo 'Gulabo', the mascot of the brand of alcohol he enjoys. The knowledge of these hallucinations are later used by Matru as a ploy to get Harry drunk in order to serve his own plans.|$|R
30|$|The {{study showed}} a high {{incidence}} of psychiatric and sleep abnormalities in SCM. The most common psychiatric disorders were anxious depressed <b>symptoms,</b> <b>withdrawal</b> depressed <b>symptoms,</b> social problem, somatic complaints, and attention problems. At the same time, SCM experienced decreased sleep quality, excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), and PSG abnormalities in the form of decreased total sleep time (TST) and sleep efficiency (SE) in addition to increased sleep latency, wake after sleep onset (WASO), arousal index (AI), and REM sleep without atonia index.|$|R
2500|$|Protracted {{withdrawal}} syndrome refers to symptoms persisting {{for months or}} even years. A significant minority of people withdrawing from benzodiazepines, perhaps 10 to 15%, experience a protracted {{withdrawal syndrome}} which can sometimes be severe. Symptoms may include tinnitus, psychosis, cognitive deficits, gastrointestinal complaints, insomnia, paraesthesia (tingling and numbness), pain (usually in limbs and extremities), muscle pain, weakness, tension, painful tremor, shaking attacks, jerks, dizziness and blepharospasm and may occur even without a pre-existing history of these symptoms. [...] Tinnitus occurring during dose reduction or discontinuation of benzodiazepines is alleviated by recommencement of benzodiazepines. Dizziness is often reported as being the <b>withdrawal</b> <b>symptom</b> that lasts the longest.|$|R
5|$|Those {{taking more}} than 4mg per day have an {{increased}} potential for dependence. This medication may cause <b>withdrawal</b> <b>symptoms</b> upon abrupt withdrawal or rapid tapering, which in some cases {{have been known to}} cause seizures, as well as marked delirium similar to that produced by the anticholinergic tropane alkaloids of Datura (scopolamine and atropine). The discontinuation of this medication may also cause a reaction called rebound anxiety.|$|E
5|$|Peak {{benefits}} achieved for generalized {{anxiety disorder}} (GAD) may take up to a week. Tolerance to the anxiolytic and antipanic effects is controversial, with only some authoritative sources supporting the development of tolerance; tolerance will, however, develop to the sedative and hypnotic effects {{within a couple of}} days. <b>Withdrawal</b> <b>symptoms</b> or rebound symptoms may occur after ceasing treatment abruptly following a few weeks or longer of steady dosing, and may necessitate a gradual dose reduction. Other risks include increased rates of suicide, possibly due to disinhibition.|$|E
5|$|The benzodiazepines {{diazepam}} (Valium) and oxazepam (Serepax) {{have been}} found to produce fewer withdrawal reactions than alprazolam (Xanax), temazepam (Restoril/Normison), or lorazepam (Temesta/Ativan). Factors that determine the risk of psychological dependence or physical dependence and the severity of the benzodiazepine <b>withdrawal</b> <b>symptoms</b> during dose reduction of alprazolam include: dosage used, length of use, frequency of dosing, personality characteristics of the individual, previous use of cross-dependent/cross-tolerant drugs (alcohol or other sedative-hypnotic drugs), current use of cross-dependent/-tolerant drugs, use of other short-acting, high-potency benzodiazepines, and method of discontinuation.|$|E
50|$|Drug {{discontinuation}} {{may cause}} rebound effects (return {{of the symptoms}} the drug relieved, and that, to a degree stronger {{than they were before}} treatment first began) and <b>withdrawal</b> syndromes (<b>symptoms</b> caused by the discontinuation by the drug itself).|$|R

50|$|The {{effects of}} {{long-term}} benzodiazepine use include drug dependence {{as well as}} the possibility of adverse effects on cognitive function, physical health, and mental health. Benzodiazepines are generally effective when used therapeutically in the short term. Most of the problems associated with benzodiazepines result from their long-term use. There are significant physical, mental and social risks associated with the long-term use of benzodiazepines. Although anxiety can temporarily increase as a <b>withdrawal</b> <b>symptom,</b> there is evidence that a reduction or withdrawal from benzodiazepines can lead in the long run to a reduction in anxiety symptoms. Due to these increasing physical and mental symptoms from long-term use of benzodiazepines, slowly withdrawing from benzodiazepines is recommended for many long-term users. Not everyone, however, experiences problems with long-term use.|$|R
5|$|The {{next most}} common use is {{as an aid}} for smoking cessation. Bupropion reduces the {{severity}} of nicotine cravings and <b>withdrawal</b> <b>symptoms.</b> Bupropion is helpful for smoking cessation in smokers with no history of depression; thus, the effectiveness of bupropion is not due to its antidepressant effect. A typical bupropion treatment course lasts up to twelve weeks, with people halting the use of tobacco about ten days into the course. Bupropion approximately doubles the chance of quitting smoking successfully. The effectiveness of bupropion is comparable to nicotine replacement therapy, but less effective than varenicline.|$|E
5|$|After moving in, Moon began a {{prescribed}} course of Heminevrin (clomethiazole, a sedative) to alleviate his alcohol <b>withdrawal</b> <b>symptoms.</b> He {{wanted to get}} sober, but due to his fear of psychiatric hospitals {{he wanted to do}} it at home. Clomethiazole is discouraged for unsupervised detoxification because of its addictive potential, its tendency to induce tolerance, and its risk of death when mixed with alcohol. The pills were prescribed by Geoffrey Dymond, a physician who was unaware of Moon's lifestyle. Dymond prescribed a bottle of 100 pills, instructing him to take one pill when he felt a craving for alcohol but not more than three pills per day.|$|E
5|$|Nonbenzodiazepines are {{contraindicated}} during benzodiazepine withdrawal as {{they are}} cross tolerant with benzodiazepines and can induce dependence. Alcohol is also cross tolerant with benzodiazepines and more toxic and thus caution is needed to avoid replacing one dependence with another. During withdrawal, fluoroquinolone-based antibiotics are best avoided if possible; they displace benzodiazepines from their binding site and reduce GABA function and, thus, may aggravate <b>withdrawal</b> <b>symptoms.</b> Antipsychotics are not recommended for benzodiazepine withdrawal (or other CNS depressant withdrawal states) especially clozapine, olanzapine or low potency phenothiazines e.g. chlorpromazine as they lower the seizure threshold and can worsen withdrawal effects; if used extreme caution is required.|$|E
