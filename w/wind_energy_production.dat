5|$|Electric power {{generated}} from wind {{power can be}} highly variable at several different timescales: hourly, daily, or seasonally. Annual variation also exists, but is not as significant. Because instantaneous electrical generation and consumption must remain in balance to maintain grid stability, this variability can present substantial challenges to incorporating large amounts of wind power into a grid system. Intermittency and the non-dispatchable nature of <b>wind</b> <b>energy</b> <b>production</b> can raise costs for regulation, incremental operating reserve, and (at high penetration levels) could require {{an increase in the}} already existing energy demand management, load shedding, storage solutions or system interconnection with HVDC cables. The variability of wind is quite different from solar, wind may be producing power at night when other baseload plants are often overproducing.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis work {{assesses the}} {{sensitivity}} of the offshore <b>wind</b> <b>energy</b> density and <b>production</b> to SST biases and air-sea feedbacks along the French and Spanish coast in the North-Western Mediterranean. It makes use of a set of three 20 -years simulations from atmosphere stand-alone and atmosphere/ocean coupled models. In this numerical experiment, the effects of SST bias and air-sea feedbacks are isolated without any interference with other sources of error and uncertainty propagation, meaning that the same model and hence the same physics are used, all other things being equal. This study shows that the effects of SST bias or air-sea feedbacks on <b>wind</b> <b>energy</b> density and <b>production</b> estimation can reach up to 10 % and 5 %, respectively. Especially, accounting for air-sea coupled processes on sub-monthly time scales weakens systematically the <b>energy</b> density and <b>production</b> by 6. 5 % and 2. 4 % with respect to the configuration where these effects are neglected. The relative variability over the 20 years of simulation does not exceed 20 % so the impact of air-sea feedbacks is very robust in time in terms of <b>wind</b> <b>energy</b> density and <b>production</b> assessment. Uncertainties up to 6. 5 and 2. 5 % in the evaluation of the potential in terms of <b>wind</b> <b>energy</b> density and <b>production</b> potential can have severe consequences on the whole industry by lowering the projects profitability. This study shows that the effects of SST bias and air-sea feedbacks usually extend vertically up to the hub-height but their magnitude depends on the stability of the atmosphere. This study concludes that reducing the SST bias at the lower boundary of numerical atmospheric models and accounting for rapid interactions and feedbacks between the ocean and the atmosphere are key to improve the reliability of offshore <b>wind</b> <b>energy</b> density and <b>production</b> assessment...|$|R

This project represents a validation of three wind resource assessment methodologies (WAsP, WAsP Engineering, and WindSIM) using various models to represent forests within the simulations. These simulation programs use two parameters to describe forests: roughness length and displacement height. An extensive literature review found many models for these parameters in use within the micro-meteorological field. Several simple models exist based on the mean tree height (over fifty combinations of models were found), while other models incorporate expressions for the canopy density. These models were tested by simulating the mean <b>wind</b> speed, <b>energy</b> <b>production,</b> turbulence intensity, and wind shear at sites inside or near forests, and comparing the predictions to measured data at those sites. Data was available from four Risø measurement campaigns in forests and from two Siemens Wind Power windfarms. The analysis shows that the use of some of the forestry models can significantly improve the prediction of mean <b>wind</b> speed, annual <b>energy</b> <b>production,</b> turbulence intensity, and shear in sites inside forests. For sites near forests, the models have negligible effects. It was found that WAsP and WAsP Engineering were generally more accurate than WindSIM for these sites...|$|R

We suggest a novel, globally feasible approach to assess the local <b>wind</b> <b>energy</b> potential: First, meteorological reanalysis data are applied to obtain long-term low-scale wind speed data at specific turbine locations and hub heights. Second, the relation between <b>wind</b> data and <b>energy</b> <b>production</b> is for the first time determined via a five parameter logistic function using actual high-frequency <b>energy</b> <b>production</b> data.
