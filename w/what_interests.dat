25|$|Some {{degree of}} {{autonomous}} learning is popular {{with those who}} home educate their children. In true autonomous learning, the child usually gets to decide what projects they wish to tackle or <b>what</b> <b>interests</b> to pursue. In home education, this can be instead of or in addition to regular subjects like doing math or English.|$|E
25|$|She criticizes H.G. Wells, Arnold Bennett, John Galsworthy {{of writing}} about {{unimportant}} things and called them materialists. She {{suggests that it}} would be better for literature to turn their backs on them so it can move forward, for better or worse. While Woolf criticizes the aforementioned three authors, she praises several other authors for their innovation. This group of writers she names spiritualists, and includes James Joyce who Woolf says writes <b>what</b> <b>interests</b> and moves him.|$|E
25|$|He is {{the almighty}} ruler of Avalon. He is never {{referred}} to as anything but his Highness, the king, etc.. {{so it can be}} supposed that he doesn't have a name, just his royal title. The King has varying character traits; he can be annoying and comic at one moment then change to cunning and serious the next. He seems to have a pique interest in Fanta though it has not been fully disclosed as to <b>what</b> <b>interests</b> him so.|$|E

It is at this point that resorting to the PPSA becomes relevant.|$|R

25|$|Ancient sources mention {{what brought}} Pompey into the alliance, but are silent on <b>what</b> <b>interests</b> might have brought Crassus into the fold. There are only {{mentions}} of Caesar bringing Pompey and Crassus together, which Plutarch {{described as a}} reconciliation. Cassius Dio {{thought that this was}} something that required skill—almost {{as if it were a}} reconciliation of the irreconcilable. In the writings of Suetonius and Plutarch and in some letters and a speech of Cicero, we find clues about both what the interests of Crassus may have been, and indications that Crassus and Pompey might have been less irreconcilable that their portrayals suggest and that the three men of the triumvirate had collaborated before. It could be argued that the formation of the first triumvirate was the result of the marginalisation of an enemy (Caesar) and an outsider (Pompey) and the rebuttal of interests associated with Crassus by the optimates who held sway in the senate.|$|E
25|$|Tuten spent 15 years {{heading the}} {{graduate}} program in creative {{writing at the}} City College of New York, which he co-founded. In that capacity, he championed the work of students Walter Mosley, Oscar Hijuelos, Philip Graham, Aurelie Sheehan, Salar Abdoh, Ernesto Quiñonez, and many others. He also teaches classes on experimental writing at The New School. He {{is on the board}} of advisors for Guernica Magazine and executive editor of Smyles & Fish. Tuten's short fiction has appeared in Granta, Conjunctions, Fence, Fiction, The New Review of Literature, Tri-Quarterly, and Harper's Magazine. In 1973, he received a Guggenheim Fellowship for Creative Writing and in 2001 was given the Award for Distinguished Writing from the American Academy of Arts and Letters. In describing his usage of the past in his novels (where many of them are set), Tuten once stated:The fact that I don’t write about contemporary life doesn’t mean I’m any less taken up with it. I find it too limiting to write about contemporary life just in contemporary diction, however. I don’t think there's enough flexibility. I can imagine writing about characters who feel passion for one another in a contemporary setting but I don’t, as yet, hear the language for that. But I’m always thinking about contemporary life vis a vis the way it looks in the past. I mean how it looks in the past is a reflection of what it is today. That's <b>what</b> <b>interests</b> me. I think I’m always talking about present-day life, not only political life but about the quality of passion, the quality of all relationships and love.|$|E
500|$|Warhol clearly {{changed the}} concept of art appreciation. Instead of {{harmonious}} three-dimensional arrangements of objects, he chose mechanical derivatives of commercial illustration {{with an emphasis on}} the packaging. His variations of multiple soup cans, for example, made the process of repetition an appreciated technique: [...] "If you take a Campbell's Soup can and repeat it fifty times, you are not interested in the retinal image. According to Marcel Duchamp, <b>what</b> <b>interests</b> you is the concept that wants to put fifty Campbell's Soup cans on a canvas." [...] The regimented multiple can depictions almost become an abstraction whose details are less important than the panorama. In a sense, the representation was more important than that which was represented. Warhol's interest in machinelike creation during his early pop art days was misunderstood by those in the art world, whose value system was threatened by mechanization.|$|E

500|$|Hoffman {{was praised}} for his {{versatility}} {{and ability to}} fully inhabit any role, but specialized in playing creeps and misfits: [...] "his CV was populated almost exclusively by snivelling wretches, insufferable prigs, braggarts and outright bullies", writes the journalist Ryan Gilbey. Hoffman was appreciated for making these roles real, complex and even sympathetic; while Todd Louiso, director of Love Liza, believed that Hoffman connected to people on screen because he looked like an ordinary man and revealed his vulnerability. Xan Brooks of The Guardian remarked that the actor's particular talent was to [...] "take thwarted, twisted humanity and ennoble it". [...] "The more pathetic or deluded the character," [...] writes Gilbey, [...] "the greater Hoffman's relish seemed in rescuing them from the realms of the merely monstrous." [...] When asked in 2006 why he undertook such roles, Hoffman responded, [...] "I didn't go out looking for negative characters; I went out looking {{for people who have}} a struggle and a fight to tackle. That's <b>what</b> <b>interests</b> me." ...|$|E
500|$|The idea of {{parallel}} lives has been explored before in {{films such as}} Run Lola Run (1998) and Sliding Doors (1998) which influenced Van Dormael's writing. Unlike any of those, Mr. Nobody has philosophical underpinning inspired by scientific tomes on chaos theory and the butterfly effect, pigeon superstition, and the space-time continuum. Van Dormael stated, [...] "My starting point was a 12-minute short I made in 1982 called È pericoloso sporgersi. A kid runs behind a train with two possible choices: to go with his mother or with his father. From there we follow two possible futures. I started one version {{based on the fact}} that a woman jumps or doesn't jump on a train. Then Sliding Doors by Peter Howitt came out, followed by Run Lola Run by Tom Tykwer. I had to find something else. And that's when I realised that the story I was trying to tell was not binary, that I was above all interested by the multiplicity and complexity of choices. With this screenplay I wanted to make the viewer feel the abyss that is the infinity of possibilities. Beyond this, I wanted to find a different way of telling a story. I wanted the gaze of the child on his future to meet the gaze of the old man he has become on his past. I wanted to talk about complexity through cinema, which is a simplifying medium. While reality around us is more and more complex, the information is more and more succinct, political speeches are more and more simplistic. <b>What</b> <b>interests</b> me is complexity. Not the simple answers, which are reassuring but bound to be false." ...|$|E
2500|$|Disadvantages: Efforts at {{fostering}} {{intrinsic motivation}} can be slow to affect behavior and can require special and lengthy preparation. [...] Students are individuals, so {{a variety of}} approaches {{may be needed to}} motivate different students. It is often helpful to know <b>what</b> <b>interests</b> one's students in order to connect these interests with the subject matter. This requires getting to know one's students. Also, it helps if the instructor is interested in the subject.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes--I did; and I {{believed}} Chad too. It {{would have}} been odious and unmannerly--as well as quite perverse--if I hadn't. <b>What</b> <b>interest</b> have you in deceiving me?" ...|$|R

2500|$|Time {{and memory}} have {{regularly}} {{been identified as}} two of the principal themes of Resnais's work, at least in his earlier films. He however consistently tried to modify this view of his concerns: [...] "I prefer {{to speak of the}} imaginary, or of consciousness. <b>What</b> <b>interests</b> me in the mind is that faculty we have to imagine {{what is going to happen}} in our heads, or to remember what has happened". He also described his films as an attempt, however imperfect, to approach the complexity of thought and its mechanism.|$|E
2500|$|The Geek Code is {{a series}} of letters and symbols used by {{self-described}} [...] "geeks" [...] to inform fellow geeks about their personality, appearance, interests, skills, and opinions. The idea is that everything that makes a geek individual and different from all the other geeks in the world can be written down (encoded) in this very compact format. Then other geeks can read the geek code and work back from that to discover what the writer looks like, <b>what</b> <b>interests</b> they have, and so forth. This is deemed to be efficient in some sufficiently geeky manner.|$|E
2500|$|Another of his teachers, artist Robert Henri, taught life class. Henri {{encouraged}} {{his students}} to use their art to [...] "make a stir in the world". He also advised his students, [...] "It isn't the subject that counts but what you feel about it" [...] and [...] "Forget about art and paint pictures of <b>what</b> <b>interests</b> you in life." [...] In this manner, Henri influenced Hopper, as well as notable future artists George Bellows and Rockwell Kent. He encouraged them to imbue a modern spirit in their work. Some artists in Henri's circle, including John Sloan, became members of [...] "The Eight", {{also known as the}} Ashcan School of American Art. Hopper's first existing oil painting to hint at his famous interiors was Solitary Figure in a Theater (c.1904). During his student years, he also painted dozens of nudes, still life studies, landscapes, and portraits, including his self-portraits.|$|E

2500|$|Woolf's [...] "Modern Fiction" [...] essay {{focuses on}} how writers should write {{or what she}} hopes for them to write. Woolf does not suggest a {{specific}} way to write instead she wants writers to simply write <b>what</b> <b>interests</b> {{them in any way}} that they choose to write. Woolf suggests, “Any method is right, every method is right, that expresses what we wish to express, if we are writers; that brings us closer to the novelist's intention if we are readers". Woolf wanted writers to express themselves {{in such a way that}} it showed life as it should be seen not as [...] "a series of gig lamps symmetrically arranged". She set out to inspire writers of modern fiction by calling for originality, criticizing those who focused on the unimportant things, and comparing the differences of cultural authors, all for the sake of fiction and literature.|$|E
2500|$|The Tale of Genji is an {{important}} work of Japanese literature, and modern authors have cited it as inspiration, such as Jorge Luis Borges who said of it, [...] "The Tale of Genji, as translated by Arthur Waley, is written with an almost miraculous naturalness, and <b>what</b> <b>interests</b> us is not the exoticismthe horrible wordbut rather the human passions of the novel. Such interest is just: Murasaki's work is what one would quite precisely call a psychological novel ... I dare to recommend this book to those who read me. The English translation that has inspired this brief insufficient note is called The Tale of Genji." [...] It is noted for its internal consistency, psychological depiction, and characterization. The novelist Yasunari Kawabata said in his Nobel Prize acceptance speech: [...] "The Tale of Genji in particular is the highest pinnacle of Japanese literature. Even down to our day {{there has not been}} a piece of fiction to compare with it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Fitzroy Maclean {{discussed}} Yugoslavia with Churchill in Cairo {{after the}} Tehran Conference. Maclean reported that [...] "…the Partisans, whether we helped them or not, {{would be the}} decisive political factor in Jugoslavia after the war and, secondly that Tito and the other leaders of the movement were openly and avowedly Communist and that the system which they would establish would inevitably be on Soviet lines and, in all probability, strongly oriented towards the Soviet Union." [...] Churchill said that as neither of them intended to live there after the war: [...] "… the less you and I worry about the form of Government they set up, the better. That {{is for them to}} decide. <b>What</b> <b>interests</b> us is, which of them is doing most harm to the Germans." [...] However, Maclean had also noticed Tito's [...] "independence of mind" [...] and wondered whether Tito might evolve into something more than a Soviet puppet.|$|E
6000|$|... "But <b>what</b> <b>interested</b> me {{most was}} the central eye of the huge wooden idol. I could see by its {{flashing}} brilliancy {{that it was an}} immense diamond of the purest water.|$|R

6000|$|Kate thought. [...] "That's by her liking you too. She as well is prodigious. You see <b>what</b> <b>interest</b> {{in a man}} does. It does it all round. So you needn't be afraid." ...|$|R
2500|$|A {{businessman}} {{looks at}} the deployment of labor in a different way, but faces a similar analytical problem. All labor produces something, {{but it does not}} necessarily help to create profit for one reason or another. <b>What</b> <b>interests</b> a businessman in a financial sense, is the cost of labor which directly creates the product or service that generates profit, versus the cost of labor that is effectively only a necessary overhead expense for his own business. The general aim is, to maximize productive labor in this sense, and minimize unproductive costs. That is the efficiency principle that guides the development of the division of labor organizationally. Ideally speaking, everything the employee does would directly contribute to profit for the enterprise (but in reality it usually doesn't). If employers paid piece wages then, in theory, they would incur costs, [...] "only if" [...] their employees created new value for them. Marx believed that piece wages – whether paid on an individual or team basis – were, in the long term, the most favorable form of remuneration for capitalist labor-exploitation, although he recognized that often workers earning piece-wages could initially earn more than workers on time-wages.|$|E
6000|$|... "I?" [...] I gasped in amazement--as well I might, for <b>what</b> <b>interests</b> had Boccadoro, the Fool, {{in common}} with Cesare Borgia, Cardinal of Valencia? ...|$|E
60|$|Unfortunately, {{many things}} have been omitted which should have been {{recorded}} in our journal; for though we made it a rule to set down all our experiences therein, yet such a resolution {{is very hard to}} keep, for the important experience rarely allows us to remember such obligations, and so indifferent things get recorded, while that is frequently neglected. It is not easy to write in a journal <b>what</b> <b>interests</b> us at any time, because to write it is not <b>what</b> <b>interests</b> us.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes! yes!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "And I was {{wondering}} <b>what</b> <b>interest</b> {{you could have}} in penetrating the mystery of her death. Tell me! Confide in me! I am dying to know!" ...|$|R
60|$|Several of them pointedly asked <b>what</b> <b>interest</b> {{they had}} in the matter, and, to some of these, Charlie was obliged to use his power of {{promising}} sums of money, in case of success.|$|R
25|$|Woolf wanted {{writers to}} focus on the awkwardness of life and craved {{originality}} in their work. Woolf's overall hope was to inspire modern fiction writers to write <b>what</b> <b>interested</b> them, wherever it may lead.|$|R
