[...] Spencer Abbott, who had previously managed Portland and was then the manager in Atlanta, offered to allow Portland to name its price for Oana. Abbott paid $5,000 for Oana and recalled Atlanta's racially segregated bleachers furthered the rationale for acquiring Oana:At Atlanta <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> <b>a</b> powerful right-handed hitter who could hit the ball into those Negro bleachers in left field.

He got his start through Roger Corman, who hired him in 1980 as a production assistant at New World Pictures. In 1986, DeCoteau directed and produced his first feature film for Charles Band. He is the founder of Rapid Heart Pictures, where his films include A Talking Cat!?! and the 1313 series. He has said of his working methods, “I always wanted to make what I could sell. So I just promised myself that I would not be set in my ways.

500|$|The {{video was}} then filmed in Budapest, Hungary over several days. [...] "The {{reason for the}} {{location}} stems from the music in the actual video. The ball needs to bounce synchronized with the 16th or 8th beat in the track. To do that, <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> <b>a</b> space with equidistant or closed surfaces to bounce around. A roof low to the floor but with uprights. Obviously parking lots are ideal. So the location thing happened mainly so it wouldn't fly into the sky. Being connoisseurs of parking lots, {{we wanted to find}} a good example. But it was a technical reason that made us go with it," [...] Knight said. Ne-o used an Arri Super 16mm film camera to shoot the film then edited it in Adobe Premiere Pro, with 3D animation using Autodesk Softimage.|$|E
500|$|To {{kick off}} the band's European tour, the band staged a free show in Moscow's Red Square, on August 14, 1999, to a crowd of over 200,000. Kiedis {{recalled}} the situation: [...] "Red Square was so filled with wall-to-wall Russians that <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> <b>a</b> police escort to get near the stage." [...] Following the European leg, the group did a show in New York City, at the Windows on the World, for KROQ radio contest-winners, {{and then at the}} Big Day Out festival in Australia following several Japanese tour dates. Flea, however, began to feel the repercussions of touring causing the band to set up concerts that were less strenuous, and consequently less financially rewarding, for them. These shows would finish the remainder of the Californication tour. As one of the last shows before the release of their next album By the Way, the Chili Peppers played Rock in Rio 3.|$|E
500|$|Anthony Mackie {{said the}} Russo {{brothers}} relied on minimal use of computer-generated imagery, stating, [...] "The Russos, {{what they did}} that was so great was, they wanted to stay with live action, which is a dying art form. If they can build it, they built it. If we could do it, we did it. They wanted to do as little CGI as possible. That's why the movie looks so great." [...] Nevertheless, six special effects companies are involved in creating the visual effects of the film, including Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), Scanline VFX, Lola VFX, Luma Pictures, Whiskytree and The Embassy, with previsualization completed by Proof. The film contained 2,500 visual effects shots, with 900 worked on by ILM. The film featured extensive use of digital doubles. Russell Earl, ILM visual effects supervisor, said, [...] "The character that we did the most work on was Falcon. We {{knew we were going}} to do CG wings. We also did some shots with wires and some with stunt doubles and head replacement. And <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> <b>a</b> very good digital double." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Tim Minear and [...] Vince Gilligan, and {{directed}} by Daniel Sackheim. Minear's original idea for the episode involved a convicted criminal {{who happened to be}} an atheist. While in prison, he would have heard the voice of God, commanding him to kill a truly evil man, and then he would have suddenly found himself mystically transferred out of the prison. Although the police would be after him, only Mulder would believe he was working for the greater good. Minear noted that [...] "I pitched it and I was going to do it, eventually, until we found ourselves at a point in the year where <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> <b>a</b> script really fast." [...] Executive producer Frank Spotnitz suggested to Minear that the [...] "convicted atheist" [...] should actually be Robert Modell from the third season episode [...] "Pusher". After this was decided, Minear put aside the [...] "Word of God" [...] story, as it was called, teamed up with Gilligan, and the two wrote the final script.|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} one of the first to use {{practical}} locations during shooting. According to Clarke, [...] "When <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> <b>a</b> scene in a bar, we went to Santa Monica and asked a guy how much money he would charge to let us come in and shoot scenes in his bar". Because Clarke also acted in the film, editor and co-writer Tom Boutross served as co-director. Boutross later [...] The main character's home in the film was located on Lafayette Boulevard in Los Angeles, which is no longer standing. The four-story rooming house was rented for 5–6 weekend days for $25 per day. The exterior shots of the character's house were shot in a different location around Glendale Hill. A scene in the film where a transformed McKenna graphically crushes a rat with his bare hands was not in the script, and was improvised while on location. The effect was accomplished by placing ketchup on the rat; Clarke would then gently squeeze the rat, making the ketchup ooze from his fingers. This scene was removed from prints that were released on television, but was later restored.|$|E
500|$|Anahid Nazarian, Coppola's librarian, {{spoke of}} the {{historical}} inaccuracies. [...] "Preston Tucker didn't really have an assembly line; there's one in the film. He actually had five kids; there are only four in the film. Our story takes place in one year; the real story took place over four years. People who know the story will {{find a lot of}} what they call errors. I'm sure I'll be deluged with letters." [...] Nazarian's research, collected over several years, consisted of books, some 350 articles, interviews with the Tucker family, hundreds of photographs, home movies and information from the Tucker Automobile Club of America who the production company considered important arbiters of the Tucker mystique. [...] "We knew the facts," [...] she continued, [...] "but to fit the spirit of the story in a film that is exciting and has characters you love and characters you hate - that made us change a lot of things. Things like the president of the Tucker Company was a good guy really, but <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> <b>a</b> villain, so we made him a villain." [...] Alex Tremulis, who served as one of the historical consultants during production, is depicted as the chief car designer of the Tucker Torpedo rather than as the stylist, and the film ignores the involvement of designer Philip Egan.|$|E

500|$|Side B of {{the album}} begins with [...] "Psycho Therapy", which was written by both Johnny and Dee Dee; the song has since grown {{into one of the}} most popular Ramones' song. Dee Dee recalled: [...] "I knew <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> <b>a</b> real 'Ramones song' for the album, and I knew [...] was {{depressed}} about how things were going. He needed that song to get excited about the band again." [...] The next track is another cover song, [...] "Time Has Come Today", which was originally recorded by the soul music group The Chambers Brothers. The Ramones' version of the song featured a psychedelic rock influence, and was said by Eddy to have more of a [...] "garage" [...] feel to it, as compared to the original. [...] "My-My Kind of a Girl" [...] was directed specifically toward the band's female fandom. The lyrics were written by Joey about meeting a girl on 8th Street in Manhattan and wanting to spend his life with her. In Vanity Fair, the song was regarded as [...] a [...] "lingering affection for Phil Spector's pop grandeur." [...] Dee Dee's [...] "Time Bomb", which was track number eleven, was said by True to be [...] "more ridiculous than frightening."

500|$|Character shading {{supervisor}} on {{the film}} Thomas Jordan explained that chrome and car paint were the main challenges {{on the film}}, saying: [...] "Chrome and car paint were our two main challenges on this film. We started out by learning {{as much as we}} could. At the local body shop, we watched them paint a car, and we saw the way they mixed the paint and applied the various coats. We tried to dissect what goes into the real paint and recreated it in the computer. We figured out that <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> <b>a</b> base paint, which is where the color comes from, and the clearcoat, which provides the reflection. We were then able to add in things like metallic flake to give it a glittery sparkle, a pearlescent quality the might change color depending on the angle, and even a layer of pin-striping for characters like Ramone." [...] Supervising technical director on the film Eben Ostby explained that the biggest challenge for the technical team was creating the metallic and painted surfaces of the car characters, and the reflections that those surfaces generate, saying: [...] "Given that the stars of our film are made of metal, John had a real desire to see realistic reflections, and more beautiful lighting than we’ve seen in any of our previous films. In the past, we’ve mostly used environment maps and other matte-based technology to cheat reflections, but for Cars we added a ray-tracing capability to our existing Renderman program to raise the bar for Pixar." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} television critics. Many lauded {{the use of}} Starr; for instance, IGN ranked his performance in the episode, along with Paul McCartney's performance in [...] "Lisa the Vegetarian" [...] and George Harrison's performance in [...] "Homer's Barbershop Quartet", as the tenth best guest appearance in The Simpsons history. They added that [...] "Although none of these appearances were really large, {{the fact that the}} most popular band of all time appeared on The Simpsons is a large statement on the popularity and importance of the show." [...] Doug Pratt, a DVD reviewer and Rolling Stone contributor, wrote that [...] "Brush with Greatness" [...] has a [...] "well thought-out" [...] plot and he enjoyed the use of Starr and Marge's previously undiscovered talents. Paul A. Cantor, {{the author of the book}} Gilligan Unbound: Pop Culture in the Age of Globalization, said the [...] "once again Brian K. Roberts proves his genius with 'Brush with Greatness' in a superb work where Marge cultivates her wonderful artistic side." [...] DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson wrote: [...] "From the opening at Mt. Splashmore through Homer’s diet and the unveiling of Mr. Burns’ controversial portrait, the episode packed a lot of great material. It also expanded Marge’s character in a pleasing way, as it avoided any semblance of sappiness; <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> <b>a</b> break from sentiment after 'Old Money'. Overall, 'Brush with Greatness' provided a terrific episode." [...] The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote: [...] "A superb episode, with Marge rightfully centre stage. Despite his general unpleasantness, Mr Burns' gratitude to Marge is both welcome and unexpected. And the dig at Water Parks is spot on." ...|$|E
