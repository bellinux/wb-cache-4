We don't know what's going to end up on the album but it was an {{absolute}} you know honor... For me being such a fan for so long it was so exciting to hear her vocal in the room right next to me, coming out of her head really sounding exactly like all those records we all love and she's a pleasure to work with because she's so in tune with who she is and what she wants to sing. I don't know. It's really great collaborating with her and Natalia is such a great writer.|$|E

[...] "We felt {{that he wanted to}} end the show early to go hang out at the New England Metal Fest, which <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> performing at the next day" [...] coming up with all sorts of excuses to make this happen.|$|E
500|$|In August 2010, it was {{reported}} that Paramount Pictures and Marvel Studios were planning to start shooting in February. Simultaneously, it was declared that the film would be shot in 3D, although Mark Ruffalo later tweeted that this was not the case. In October 2010, Grumman Studios in Bethpage, New York and the Steiner Studios in Brooklyn, New York City, were announced as filming locations, with set construction slated to begin in November, but as Whedon later explained, [...] "Originally <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in Los Angeles, then for a short period <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in New York, and then somehow we ended up in Albuquerque." [...] Also that October, Walt Disney Studios agreed to pay Paramount at least $115million for the worldwide distribution rights to Iron Man3 and The Avengers. The deal also allowed Paramount to continue to collect the 8percent box office fee it would have earned for distributing the film and a marquee credit—placement of the company's production logo on marketing materials and the film's opening titles. As a result, the onscreen production credit reads [...] "Marvel Studios presents in association with Paramount Pictures" [...] though the film is solely owned, distributed, financed, and marketed by Disney. Paramount's Epix retained pay TV rights.|$|E

500|$|From 1996 to 2001, Sanctus Real toured {{areas of}} the United States, and also sent demos to several Christian and {{mainstream}} record labels. After they received multiple recording contract offers in 2001, the band decided to sign with Sparrow Records. Matt Hammitt said, [...] "At that point, we really had to do some soul searching and figure out where it was <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> ... Ultimately, we knew we could relate to kids in the church. We are passionate about our faith ... from our personal experience, we felt this was the place {{we were supposed to}} be." ...|$|E
500|$|Having {{represented}} Wales at schoolboy level, Keenor {{was invited}} to attend a trial at Cardiff City by his former school teacher Riden, who had spotted Keenor playing local amateur football for Cardiff based side Roath Wednesday. Keenor later stated that he [...] "did not think twice about it" [...] and impressed enough during a trial match to be offered an amateur contract with the club {{at the age of}} 17. The Cardiff City amateur side competed in the Western Football League at the time and Keenor appeared several times in the division. A defeat to Camerton during a Western League fixture would leave a lasting effect on Keenor after an over-confident Cardiff side suffered an upset, losing 3–1 in a match they were widely expected to win. Keenor often spoke of using the defeat as motivation in later stages of his career, remarking [...] "In subsequent seasons I always thought of that game when <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> on a [...] "good thing". It has a moral which I pass on to every young footballer".|$|E
500|$|The {{band members}} stated that {{following}} the troublesome final years signed to Geffen Records, being an independent act again helped improve their mood and approach, with Vig remarking, [...] "There were no expectations; {{no one even}} knew we were recording. So it was all under the radar and pretty casual and we all felt inspired after having that amount of time off ... when we started writing songs, they came fast and furious. We probably wrote 24, 25 songs {{over the course of}} a couple of months. Marker commented that [...] "the business stuff ends up taking over some of that fun. We got really bogged down in people's expectations of what <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> doing, being on bigger record labels and stuff. With all that behind us, it was suddenly exciting again and it felt a lot like it did when we first formed, which was really just sort of a fun idea that we had." [...] Manson added, [...] "People at record companies live in fear of being wrong. Music cannot thrive in that environment. It is an unruly art form. You can't keep treating it like sausage meat. You have to let it morph and move and breathe." ...|$|E

There was a lot that could happen with the harmonies and the guitar playing than if we'd done it a lot of times, so we could just travel through a lot more of it than if we knew where <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> start and where <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> end." ...|$|R
500|$|Following the tour, Black Sabbath {{returned}} to Los Angeles and again rented {{a house in}} Bel Air, where they spent nearly a year working on new material for the next album. The entire band were abusing both alcohol and other drugs, but Iommi says Osbourne [...] "was on a totally different level altogether". The band {{would come up with}} new song ideas but Osbourne showed little interest and would refuse to sing them. Pressure from the record label and frustrations with Osbourne's lack of input coming to a head, Iommi made the decision to fire Osbourne in 1979. Iommi believed the only options available were to fire Osbourne or break the band up completely. [...] "At that time, Ozzy had come to an end", Iommi said. [...] "We were all doing a lot of drugs, a lot of coke, a lot of everything, and Ozzy was getting drunk so much at the time. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> rehearsing and nothing was happening. It was like 'Rehearse today? No, we'll do it tomorrow.' It really got so bad that we didn't do anything. It just fizzled out." [...] Drummer Ward, who was close with Osbourne, was chosen by Tony to break the news to the singer on 27 April 1979. [...] "I hope I was professional, I might not have been, actually. When I'm drunk I am horrible, I am horrid", Ward said. [...] "Alcohol was definitely one of the most damaging things to Black Sabbath. We were destined to destroy each other. The band were toxic, very toxic." ...|$|E
500|$|GamesRadar {{offered some}} {{praise for the}} system and its library, stating, [...] "With its 8-bit {{processor}} and bright color screen, it was basically the Sega Master System in your hands. How many batteries did we suck dry playing Sonic, Madden and Road Rash on the bus or in the car, or in the dark when <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> sleeping? You couldn't do that on a Game Boy!" [...] By contrast, IGN reviewer Levi Buchanan noted the Game Gear's biggest fault was its game library {{when compared to the}} Game Boy, stating that [...] "the software was completely lacking compared to its chief rival, which was bathed in quality games. It didn't matter that the Game Gear was more powerful. The color screen did not reverse any fortunes. Content and innovation beat out technology, a formula that Nintendo is using right now with the continued ascendance of the DS and Wii." [...] Buchanan later went on to praise some parts of the Game Gear's library, however, stating [...] "Some of those Master System tweaks were very good games, and fun is resilient against time." [...] Retro Gamer praised Sega's accomplishment in surviving against the competition of Nintendo in the handheld console market with the Game Gear, noting that [...] "for all the handhelds that have gone up against the might of Nintendo and ultimately lost out, Sega's Game Gear managed to last the longest, only outdone in sales by the Sony PSP. [...] For its fans, it will remain a piece of classic gaming hardware whose legacy lives on forever." ...|$|E

[...] Then all of the boys would run for their rooms. [...] At nine o’clock the second call was given, when all lights were tuned out and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in bed.

2500|$|Both Thompson and Colburn {{were interviewed}} {{for the film}} Four Hours in My Lai (1989) (Remember My Lai? on PBS) - which {{went on to win}} a British Academy Award and an {{international}} Emmy award. The interview showed Thompson relating what he had witnessed at My Lai: [...] "Here <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the guys in the white hats. It upset me". Bilton and his colleague Kevin Sim then began researching a book and Bilton conducted further interviews with Thompson and Colburn. When the book Four Hours in My Lai (1992) was published, it prompted a campaign to have the heroism of Thompson and his helicopter crew recognised. Several senior figures in the U.S. military supported the campaign, as did President George H. W. Bush. Thompson and Colburn were invited to speak {{to a wide range of}} audiences about the ethics of warfare including at West Point, a conference in Norway, and at Connecticut College in New London, where they were each awarded an honorary doctorate.|$|E
60|$|Our coach-load was a homely party, {{and some}} of the jokes were broad--harmless enough in themselves, had Minnie and I really been the married couple <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be,</b> but even in that case unnecessary.

We used to lie in bed and read Gibbon--about the massacres of the Christians, I remember--when <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> asleep. It's no joke, I can tell you, readin' a great big book, in double columns, by a night-light, and the light that comes through a chink in the door. Then there were the moths--tiger moths, yellow moths, and horrid cockchafers. Louisa, my sister, would have the window open. I wanted it shut. We fought every night of our lives over that window.

60|$|In the {{trenches}} {{it was the}} Russians who were always the aggressors. Sortie after sortie was made throughout the winter, and in these the Russians often obtained possession for a time of portions of our trenches or those of the French. Along {{in front of their}} works the ground was studded with rifle-pits, sometimes so close to our works that it was impossible for a man to show his head above them, and the artillerymen were frequently unable to work their guns, owing to the storm of bullets which the Russians sent through the embrasures whenever a sign of movement was discerned. In the desperate fights in darkness in {{the trenches}} we lost more men than in either of the pitched battles of the campaign; and it was only the dogged courage of our soldiers and the devotion of the officers which enabled us to maintain our footing in the trenches before the city which <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> besieging.|$|E

6000|$|China {{negotiated}} with Japan about the Twenty-one Demands, and secured certain modifications, but was finally compelled to yield by an ultimatum. There was a modification {{as regards the}} Hanyehping mines on the Yangtze, presumably to please us; and the specially obnoxious fifth group was altered into an exchange of studiously vague Notes.[67] In this form, the demands were accepted by China on May 9, 1915. The United States immediately notified Japan {{that they could not}} recognize the agreement. At that time America was still neutral, and was therefore still able to do something to further the objects for which <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> fighting, such as protection of the weaker nations. In 1917, however, after America had entered the war for self-determination, it became necessary to placate Japan, and in November of that year the Ishii-Lansing Agreement was concluded, by which [...] "the Government of the United States recognizes that Japan has special interests in China, particularly for the parts to which her possessions are contiguous." [...] The rest of the agreement (which is long) consists of empty verbiage.[68] ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{does seem}} rather a {{roundabout}} way of rejoining," [...] Terence said, with a smile. [...] "We escaped {{in a boat}} and made along the north coast of Spain but, when off Santander, were blown out to sea in a gale, and were {{picked up by a}} French privateer. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> two Spanish fishermen and, as the privateer was short of boats, they took ours and enrolled us among their crew. They {{were on their way to}} Brest, and we took an opportunity to desert, and made our way on foot until we reached the mouth of the river Sienne; and made off in a boat, last night. This morning we saw the privateer in chase of us, and should certainly have been recaptured had not the Cerf come up and engaged her. While the fight was going on we had gone on board the schooner, unperceived by either party, and took what seemed to us the best way of aiding our friends; who were getting somewhat the worst of it, the crew of the lugger being very much stronger than the crew of the schooner." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{smiled at}} him, and told him, that men in our {{circumstances}} were past {{the operations of}} fear: that seeing almost every condition that could be was better than that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in, we ought to expect that the consequence, whether death or life, would be {{sure to be a}} deliverance: I asked him, what he thought of the circumstances of my life, and whether a deliverance were not worth venturing for? [...] "And where, Sir," [...] said I, [...] "is your belief of my being preserved here on purpose to save your life, which elevated you a little while ago? For my part," [...] said I, [...] "there seems to be but one thing amiss in all the prospect of it."--"What's that?" [...] says he. [...] "Why," [...] said I, [...] "'tis that as you say, there are three or four honest fellows among them, which should be spared; had they been all of the wicked part of the crew, I should have thought God's providence had singled them out to deliver them into your hands; for, depend upon it, every man of them that comes ashore, are our own, and shall die or live as they behave to us." ...|$|E
