25|$|An {{increase}} in the RD temperament leads us to seek out those behaviors or substances {{that will allow us}} to remain in a pleasant physical and/or mental state, attributing to the fact that <b>we</b> <b>humans</b> are hedonistic individuals, seeking to avoid pain and embracing pleasurable stimuli. Our pleasure and reward systems in the brain are hyper-activated, which makes us display continuous approach behaviors to the reward in question. Our neuro-circuity is as such that when we stop having access to such pleasurable objects of desire, we then experience negative consequences (withdrawal symptoms). Addictive behaviors then arise to alleviate such negative consequences and the cycle continues.|$|E
25|$|A dog's cranium is 15% {{smaller than}} an equally heavy wolf's, {{and the dog}} is less {{aggressive}} and more playful. Other species pairs show similar differences. Bonobos, like chimpanzees, are a close genetic cousin to humans, but unlike the chimpanzees, bonobos are not aggressive and {{do not participate in}} lethal inter-group aggression or kill within their own group. The most distinctive features of a bonobo are its cranium, which is 15% smaller than a chimpanzee's, and its less aggressive and more playful behavior. In other examples, the guinea pig's cranium is 13% smaller than its wild cousin the cavy, and domestic fowl show a similar reduction to their wild cousins. Possession of a smaller cranium for holding a smaller brain is a telltale sign of domestication. Bonobos appear to have domesticated themselves. In the farm fox experiment, humans selectively bred foxes against aggression, causing domestication syndrome. The foxes were not selectively bred for smaller craniums and teeth, floppy ears, or skills at using human gestures, but these traits were demonstrated in the friendly foxes. Natural selection favors those that are the most successful at reproducing, not the most aggressive. Selection against aggression made possible the ability to cooperate and communicate among foxes, dogs and bonobos. Perhaps it did the same thing for humans. The more docile animals have been found to have less testosterone than their more aggressive counterparts, and testosterone controls aggression and brain size. One researcher has argued that in becoming more social, <b>we</b> <b>humans</b> have developed a smaller brain than those of humans 20,000 years ago.|$|E

In 1960, {{he published}} a now classic article on the philosophy of mathematics and of physics, which has become his best-known work outside technical mathematics and physics, The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences. He argued that biology and cognition could be the origin of physical concepts, as <b>we</b> <b>humans</b> perceive them, and that the happy coincidence that mathematics and physics were so well matched, seemed to be [...] "unreasonable" [...] and hard to explain.

500|$|Scott's story {{concept was}} {{partially}} inspired by Chariots of the Gods?, Erich von Däniken's work about {{the theory of}} ancient astronauts which hypothesizes that life on Earth was created by aliens. Scott said, [...] "NASA and the Vatican agree that [...] almost mathematically impossible {{that we can be}} where we are today without there being a little help along the way... That's what we're looking at , at some of Erich von Däniken's ideas of how did <b>we</b> <b>humans</b> come about." [...] Spaihts originated the idea that David, the android, is like humans but {{does not want to be}} anything like them, eschewing a common theme in [...] "robotic storytelling" [...] such as Blade Runner. He also developed the theme that while the human crew is searching for their creators, David is already among its creators. Scott liked these ideas and further explored them in Lindelof's rewrite. For Shaw, Lindelof felt it was important that she was distinct from Aliens Ripley, to avoid inevitable comparisons between the two characters. In Spaihts's draft, Shaw was directly responsible for the events of the plot because she wants to seek out potentially dangerous knowledge. As with David, Lindelof expanded this facet of the character during his rewrites. He spent approximately eight months developing the script, finishing in March 2011 as filming began.|$|E

2500|$|Various {{theories}} {{have been put}} forward to explain the enduring appeal of the target girl. These range from simple awe at the display of steely nerves and complete trust to more complex psychological and philosophical theories. While some point to overtones of sadomasochistic eroticism, others cite dramaturgical works and point to parallels with the story arc of the hero in classic drama. In particular the assistant's performance is said to mirror the plot device of the hero's ordeal, in which the hero proves his or her heroic qualities through self-sacrifice or by facing extreme peril. [...] Jim Steinmeyer, a noted illusion designer who has written well-regarded books {{on the history of}} magic, has identified a fashion for female peril as entertainment in the post-First World War period. Steinmeyer has written that P. T. Selbit's stage debut of the Sawing Through A Woman illusion in 1921 marked the beginning of a trend for women as the victims of choice for acts simulating danger or torture. While Steinmeyer focuses on stage magic and attributes some of the trend to practical factors, he also points to a broader pattern in entertainment generally, which he links to social trends. He concludes that: [...] "...beyond practical concerns, the image of the woman in peril became a specific fashion in entertainment". A further view on historical trends is provided by performer and blogger Ula the Painproof Rubbergirl, who has acted as a target girl for New York-based knife thrower The Great Throwdini. In an extensive article on her experiences and philosophical approach to the art she notes: [...] "Knife throwing is an old act. So is high wire. And rodeo. And stone throwing, witch burning, beheading, Roman gladiators, jousting, dog fights,you name it - <b>we,</b> <b>humans,</b> love it. And we love a vulnerable woman.
