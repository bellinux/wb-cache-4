5|$|Tanguay {{grew up a}} fan of the Quebec Nordiques and {{frequently}} accompanied his grandfather to their games.

5|$|Despite this outburst, {{the studio}} liked him, and before his three-week {{contract}} was up—while {{the film was}} still shooting—they gave Cagney a three-week extension, which {{was followed by a}} full seven-year contract at $400 a week. The contract, however, allowed Warners to drop him at the end of any 40-week period, effectively only guaranteeing him 40 weeks income at a time. As <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>growing</b> up, Cagney shared his income with his family. Cagney received good reviews, and immediately starred in another gangster role in The Doorway to Hell. The film was a financial hit, helping cement Cagney's growing reputation. He made four more movies before his breakthrough role.|$|E
60|$|A poet, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>growing</b> old, {{will ask}} himself if he cannot keep his mask and his vision without new bitterness, new disappointment.

5|$|Invader is a {{graduate}} of the École des Beaux-Arts, a Parisian art school. Invader initially derived inspiration for his creations from video games from the late 1970s to early 1980s that he played <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>growing</b> up, particularly characters from Space Invaders, from which he derived his name. Games of the era were made with 8-bit graphics, and so lend themselves well to his method of each tile representing one pixel. Invader began making mosaics in Paris in the 1990s and then in 31 other cities in France.|$|E
5|$|An {{additional}} development which reduced Gill Sans' dominance was {{the arrival}} of phototypesetting, which allowed typefaces to be printed from photographs on film and (especially in display use – hot metal continued for some body text setting for longer) massively increased the range of typefaces that could cheaply be used. Dry transfers like Letraset had a similar effect for smaller projects; their sans-serif Compacta and Stephenson Blake's Impact exemplified the design trends of the period by choosing dense, industrial designs. Of the period from the 1930s to 1950s, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>growing</b> up, James Mosley would later write: The Monotype classics dominated the typographical landscape... in Britain, at any rate, they were so ubiquitous that, while their excellent quality was undeniable, {{it was possible to}} be bored by them and to begin to rebel against the bland good taste that they represented. In fact we were already aware by 1960 that they might not be around to bore us for too long. The death of metal type... seemed at last to be happening.|$|E
