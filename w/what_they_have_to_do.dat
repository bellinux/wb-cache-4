60|$|You all, my friends, {{know what}} is the meaning of Easter-day--that it is the Day on which The Lord rose again from the dead.

If they confine themselves to the celebration of public worship, to teaching children, to giving the consolations of religion to those with whom want and wretchedness bring them in contact--all that will be gain, clear gain, vast gain.

6000|$|As the Bee-man {{passed through}} the little village the people greatly {{wondered}} at his queer appearance, with the hive upon his back. [...] "The Bee-man is going on a long expedition this time," [...] they said; but no one imagined the strange business on which he was bent. About noon he sat down under a tree, near a beautiful meadow covered with blossoms, and ate a little honey. Then he untied his hive and stretched himself out on the grass to rest. As he gazed upon his bees hovering about him, some {{going out to the}} blossoms in the sunshine, and some returning laden with the sweet pollen, he said to himself, [...] "They know just <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> and they do it; but alas for me! I know not what I may have to do. And yet, whatever it may be, I am determined to do it.

60|$|An almost {{intolerable}} cold had descended {{upon the}} prairie when Leland reached the coulee where Sergeant Grier was mustering his forces late at night. They {{were not a}} very strong body, three troopers of the Northwest Police, all of them rather young, two prairie farmers, Leland, Gallwey, and the Sergeant, but the latter had decided {{that they would be}} enough, for the purpose. He was aware that, in an affair of this kind, a few men who understand exactly <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> and can be relied on to set about it quietly and collectedly, are apt to prove more efficient than a larger body. The unnecessary man, he knew, is usually busy getting in his comrade's way. There was also another reason which Leland had pointed out. Since his acquaintances had undertaken the business, it was advisable that they should carry it out without exposing themselves unnecessarily to the outlaws' vengeance. There were several bands of the latter acting more or less in concert, and it would lessen the risks if there were only three or four men liable to them in place of several times as many.|$|E

6000|$|His Raths {{had advised}} Friedrich against giving up Schwiebus in that manner. But his answer is on record: [...] "I must, I will and shall keep my own word. But my rights on Silesia, which I could not, {{and do not}} in these unjust circumstances, compromise, I leave intact for my posterity to prosecute. If God and {{the course of events}} order it no {{otherwise}} than now, we must be content. But if God shall one day send the opportunity, those that come after me will know <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> in such case." [...] [Pauli, vii. 150.] And so Schwiebus was given up, the Austrians paying back what Brandenburg had laid out in improving it, [...] "250,000 GULDEN (25,000 pounds);"--and the Hand of Power had in this way, finally as it hoped, settled an old troublesome account of Brandenburg's. Settled the Silesian-Duchies Claim, by the temporary Phantasm of a Gift of Schwiebus. That is literally the Liegnitz-Jagerndorf case; and the reader is to note it and remember it. For it will turn up again in History. The Hand of Power is very strong: but a stronger may perhaps get hold of its knuckles one day, at an advantageous time, and do a feat upon it.|$|E
6000|$|For the Norse people, the Man now named Odin, and Chief Norse God, we fancy, {{was such}} a man. A Teacher, and Captain of soul and of body; a Hero, of worth immeasurable; admiration for whom, transcending the known bounds, became adoration. Has he not the power of {{articulate}} Thinking; and many other powers, as yet miraculous? So, with boundless gratitude, would the rude Norse heart feel. Has he not solved for them the sphinx-enigma of this Universe; given assurance to them of their own destiny there? By him they know now <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> here, {{what to look for}} hereafter. Existence has become articulate, melodious by him; he first has made Life alive!--We may call this Odin, the origin of Norse Mythology: Odin, or whatever name the First Norse Thinker bore while he was a man among men. His view of the Universe once promulgated, a like view starts into being in all minds; grows, keeps ever growing, while it continues credible there. In all minds it lay written, but invisibly, as in sympathetic ink; at his word it starts into visibility in all. Nay, in every epoch of the world, the great event, parent of all others, is it not the arrival of a Thinker in the world--! ...|$|E
60|$|They need never {{complain}} {{that they have no}} time to think of their own souls; that the hurry and bustle of business must needs drive religion out of their minds. Their life passes in a quiet round of labours. Day after day, week after week, season after season, they know beforehand <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> and can arrange their affairs for this world, so as to give them full time to think of the world to come. Every week brings small gains, for which they can thank the God of all plenty; and every week brings, too, small anxieties, for which they can trust the same God who has given them His only- begotten Son, and will with Him freely give them all things needful for them; who has, in mercy to their souls and bodies, put them in the healthiest and usefullest of all pursuits, the one which ought to lead their minds most to God, and the one in which (if they be thoughtful men) they have the deep satisfaction of feeling that they are not working for themselves only, but for their fellow-men; that every sheaf of corn they grow is a blessing, not merely to themselves, but to the whole nation.|$|E

60|$|The {{question}} is how this can be done. My own belief {{is that if the}} Medical Council, instead of insisting upon that examination in general education which I am sorry to say I believe to be entirely futile, were to insist upon a knowledge of elementary physics, and chemistry, and biology, they would be taking one of the greatest steps which at present can be made for the improvement of medical education. And the improvement would be this. The great majority of the young men who are going into the profession have practically completed their general education--or they might very well have done so--by the age of sixteen or seventeen. If the interval between this age and that at which they commence their purely medical studies were employed in obtaining a practical acquaintance with elementary physics, chemistry, and biology, in my judgment it would be as good as two years added to the course of medical study. And for two reasons: in the first place, because the subject-matter of that which they would learn is germane to their future studies, and is so much gained; in the second place, because you might clear out of the course of their professional study a great deal which at present occupies time and attention; and last, but not least--probably most--they would then come to their medical studies prepared for that learning from Nature which is <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> in the course of becoming skilful medical men, and for which at present they are not in the slightest degree prepared by their previous education.|$|E
6000|$|Well, {{all that}} being the too {{well-known}} product of our method of vocal education--the mouth merely operating on the tongue of the pupil, and teaching him to wag it {{in a particular way}} (laughter)--it had made a great many thinking men entertain a very great distrust of this not very salutary way of procedure, and they have longed for some kind of practical way of working out the business. There would be room for a great deal of description about it if I went into it; but I must content myself with saying that the most remarkable piece of reading that you may be recommended to take and try if you can study is a book by Goethe--one of his last books, which he wrote when he was an old man, about seventy years of age--I {{think one of the most}} beautiful he ever wrote, full of mild wisdom, and which is found to be very touching by those who have eyes to discern and hearts to feel it. It is one of the pieces in [...] "Wilhelm Meister's Travels." [...] I read it through many years ago; and, of course, I had to read into it very hard when I was translating it (applause), and it has always dwelt in my mind as about the most remarkable bit of writing that I have known to be executed in these late centuries. I have often said, there are ten pages of that which, if ambition had been my only rule, I would rather have written than have written all the books that have appeared since I came into the world. (Cheers.) Deep, deep is the meaning of what is said there. They turn on the Christian religion and the religious phenomena of Christian life--altogether sketched out in the most airy, graceful, delicately-wise kind of way, so as to keep himself out of the common controversies of the street and of the forum, yet to indicate what was the result of things he had been long meditating upon. Among others, he introduces, in an aërial, flighty kind of way, here and there a touch which grows into a beautiful picture--a scheme of entirely mute education, at least with no more speech than is absolutely necessary for <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b>|$|E
60|$|I am {{done with}} {{official}} {{life for the}} present. Let those clerks {{who are willing to}} be imposed on remain. I know numbers of them in the departments who are never informed when there is to be a Cabinet meeting, whose advice is never asked about war, or finance, or commerce, by the heads of the nation, any more than if they were not connected with the government, and who actually stay in their offices day after day and work! They know their importance to the nation, and they unconsciously show it in their bearing, and the way they order their sustenance at the restaurant--but they work. I know one who has to paste all sorts of little scraps from the newspapers into a scrapbook--sometimes as many as eight or ten scraps a day. He doesn't do it well, but he does it as well as he can. It is very fatiguing. It is exhausting to the intellect. Yet he only gets eighteen hundred dollars a year. With a brain like his, that young man could amass thousands and thousands of dollars in some other pursuit, if he chose to do it. But no--his heart is with his country, and he will serve her as long as she has got a scrapbook left. And I know clerks that don't know how to write very well, but such knowledge as they possess they nobly lay at the feet of their country, and toil on and suffer for twenty-five hundred dollars a year. What they write has to be written over again by other clerks sometimes; but when a man has done his best for his country, should his country complain? Then there are clerks that have no clerkships, and are waiting, and waiting, and waiting for a vacancy--waiting patiently for a chance to help their country out--and while they are waiting, they only get barely two thousand dollars a year for it. It is sad--it is very, very sad. When a member of Congress has a friend who is gifted, but has no employment wherein his great powers may be brought to bear, he confers him upon his country, and gives him a clerkship in a department. And there that man has to slave his life out, fighting documents for the benefit of a nation that never thinks of him, never sympathizes with him--and all for two thousand or three thousand dollars a year. When I shall have completed my list of all the clerks in the several departments, with my statement of <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> and what they get for it, you will see that there are not half enough clerks, and that what there are do not get half enough pay.|$|E
