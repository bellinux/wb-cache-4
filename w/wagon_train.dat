5|$|The Donner Party Chronicles: A Day-by-Day Account of a Doomed <b>Wagon</b> <b>Train,</b> 1846–1847 by Frank Mullen Jr.|$|E
5|$|On May 12, 1880, when eight Apaches {{attacked}} a nearby <b>wagon</b> <b>train.</b> Captain Carpenter and H Company pursued the Apaches to the Rio Grande. There, under orders, Carpenter {{had to stop}} at the international border with Mexico.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1845, Palmer {{traveled}} to Oregon without his family, as captain of a <b>wagon</b> <b>train</b> of 23 wagons. Stephen Meek served as the train's paid guide. Meek left the group at Fort Hall to lead {{some of the members}} on the Meek Cutoff. The remaining parts of the <b>wagon</b> <b>train</b> {{reached the end of the}} overland Oregon Trail at the Columbia River, and unwilling to wait for transport down the dangerous Cascade Rapids, Palmer's party joined Sam Barlow's party in a quest for passage through the Cascade Range around the south side of Mount Hood. Palmer climbed to the 9,000-foot level of Mount Hood on October 7, 1845—with little food and the scant protection of moccasins—to scout a route off the mountains. This was Mount Hood's first recorded climb; the Palmer Glacier on the mountain is named for him.|$|E
50|$|Jeff Scott {{is sent to}} {{investigate}} problems with <b>wagon</b> <b>trains</b> attempting to make the journey to Oregon. Sam Morgan has sent his henchmen, under lead-henchman Bull Bragg, to stop the <b>wagon</b> <b>trains</b> {{in order to maintain}} control of the fur trade in the area.|$|R
5000|$|South Pass {{was first}} {{discovered}} by European-American traders in 1812; the first <b>wagon</b> <b>trains</b> crossed in 1832. Pacific Creek {{was the first}} water that the trains encountered after leaving the Sweetwater River at Burnt Ranch {{on the eastern side}} of the pass. Many <b>wagon</b> <b>trains</b> took the opportunity to camp and refresh at Pacific Springs, which is the first significant feeder into Pacific Creek. [...] After leaving Pacific Creek, the <b>wagon</b> <b>trains</b> entered a dry stretch of the trail with the next good water nearly 40 mi away at the Green River.|$|R
50|$|The camps at Baxter Springs were {{established}} with three goals in mind. One was to escort <b>wagon</b> <b>trains</b> heading south into Indian Territory, {{as much of}} that entity was held by Indians owing loyalty to the Confederacy. Therefore, <b>wagon</b> <b>trains</b> traveling through the Indian Territory {{were in danger of}} being attacked.|$|R
5|$|The Rose–Baley Party was {{the first}} European American {{emigrant}} <b>wagon</b> <b>train</b> to traverse the 35th parallel route known as Beale's Wagon Road, established by Edward Fitzgerald Beale, from Zuni Pueblo, New Mexico to the Colorado River near present-day Needles, California.|$|E
5|$|Meek's Cutoff {{was shot}} in Burns, Oregon and reunited Williams with Reichardt. It {{is based on a}} {{historical}} incident on the Oregon Trail in 1845, in which the frontier guide Stephen Meek led a <b>wagon</b> <b>train</b> on an ill-fated journey through a desert. After premiering during the 67th Venice International Film Festival, the well-reviewed bleak period piece saw a limited release in cinemas starting April 8, 2011.|$|E
5|$|Monroe {{was later}} {{in command of}} the rear guard during the {{withdrawal}} of Confederate forces under the command of General Robert E. Lee from the Battle of Gettysburg in 1863. In this capacity, Monroe successfully protected the -long <b>wagon</b> <b>train.</b> Monroe fought for the Confederate Army throughout the duration of the war, until 1865. Following the war, he was paroled by Union authorities.|$|E

5|$|On July 3, 1863, {{reports of}} a slow moving Confederate <b>wagon</b> <b>train</b> in the {{vicinity}} of Fairfield, Pennsylvania, attracted the attention of newly commissioned Union Brigadier General Wesley Merritt of the Reserve Brigade, First Division, Cavalry Corps. He ordered the 6th U.S. Cavalry under Major Samuel H. Starr to scout Fairfield and locate the wagons, resulting in the Battle of Fairfield.|$|E
5|$|On May 18, 1861, the Hampshire Guards and the Frontier Riflemen {{convened in}} front of the Hampshire County Courthouse in Romney before departing to fight in defense of the Confederate States of America. Parsons and a dozen of his men led the <b>wagon</b> <b>train</b> {{conveying}} these volunteers to Green Spring on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad mainline, where Parsons and the volunteers departed by train to Harpers Ferry.|$|E
5|$|The Donner Party, or Donner-Reed Party, was a {{group of}} American pioneers led by George Donner and James F. Reed who set out for California in a <b>wagon</b> <b>train</b> in May 1846. They were delayed by a series of mishaps and mistakes, and spent the winter of 1846–47 snowbound in the Sierra Nevada. Some of the pioneers resorted to {{cannibalism}} to survive.|$|E
50|$|In {{migration}} and military settings, wagons were {{often found in}} large groups called <b>wagon</b> <b>trains.</b>|$|R
50|$|As {{compared}} to the Bozeman Trail, the Bridger Trail was much less suited for <b>wagon</b> <b>trains</b> as grazing and water along the route were limited. However, in 1864, the trail is credited with handling 25% of the total growth in Virginia City's population. At least ten <b>wagon</b> <b>trains</b> used the trail in 1864, the largest being composed of 129 wagons and carrying some 350 to 450 people.|$|R
50|$|The Army {{had three}} {{reasons for the}} {{establishment}} of the two camps. The first was to help escort <b>wagon</b> <b>trains</b> south into Indian Territory, where Indians loyal to the Confederacy attacked Union <b>wagon</b> <b>trains.</b> A second use for the camps was to be a place to send tired cavalry horses. The area west of the camps had much grass. The soldiers from the camps were needed to guard the horses.|$|R
5|$|These three Native American {{leaders were}} the first to be tried, for raids (Warren <b>Wagon</b> <b>Train</b> Raid) and murder, in a United States civil court instead of a {{military}} court. This would deny them any vestige of rights as prisoners of war by being tried as any common criminal in the Court of the Thirteenth Judicial District of Texas in Jacksboro, Texas near Fort Richardson.|$|E
5|$|Also in 1847, Palmer {{traveled}} {{with his family}} to Oregon as captain of that year's major <b>wagon</b> <b>train.</b> While passing through the Walla Walla Valley he met Marcus and Narcissa Whitman at their mission shortly before their deaths in the Whitman massacre—the event that precipitated the Cayuse War. Perhaps motivated by meeting the Whitmans, Palmer later returned to serve as a peace commissioner to tribes considering joining the Cayuse. At the outset of the war he was appointed as commissary-general of the Provisional Government’s militia forces.|$|E
5|$|In April 1847, chosen {{members of}} the vanguard company gathered, final {{supplies}} were packed, and the group was organized into 14 military companies. A militia and night guard were formed. The company consisted of 143 men, including three blacks and eight {{members of the}} Quorum of the Twelve, three women, and two children. The train contained 73 wagons, draft animals, and livestock, and carried enough supplies to provision the group for one year. On April 5, the <b>wagon</b> <b>train</b> moved west from Winter Quarters toward the Great Basin.|$|E
50|$|During the {{intervals}} between political engagements and military service, Payne supported himself by hunting, scouting, and guiding <b>wagon</b> <b>trains.</b>|$|R

5|$|In September, Sitting Bull {{and about}} one hundred Hunkpapa Lakota {{encountered}} a small party near {{what is now}} Marmarth, North Dakota. They {{had been left behind}} by a <b>wagon</b> <b>train</b> commanded by Captain James L. Fisk to effect some repairs to an overturned wagon. When he led an attack, Sitting Bull was shot in the left hip by a soldier. The bullet exited out through the small of his back, and the wound was not serious.|$|E
5|$|Ina Coolbrith {{was born}} Josephine Donna Smith in Nauvoo, Illinois, {{the last of}} three daughters of Agnes Moulton Coolbrith and Don Carlos Smith, brother to Joseph Smith Coolbrith's father died of malarial fever four months after her birth, and a sister died one month after that; Coolbrith's mother then married Joseph Smith, in 1842, {{becoming}} his sixth or seventh wife. No children came of the union—Agnes felt neglected in her unfruitful Levirate marriage, the only such marriage of Smith. In June 1844, Smith was killed {{at the hands of}} an anti-Mormon mob. Losing her faith and fearful of her life, Coolbrith's mother left the Latter-day Saint community and moved to Saint Louis, Missouri, where she married a printer and lawyer named William Pickett. Twin sons were born to the couple, and in 1851 Pickett traveled overland with his new family to California in a <b>wagon</b> <b>train.</b> On the long trek, the young Ina read from a book of Shakespeare's works and from a collection of Byron's poems. As a ten-year-old girl, Ina entered California in front of the <b>wagon</b> <b>train</b> with the famous African-American scout Jim Beckwourth, riding with him on his horse, through what would later be named Beckwourth Pass. The family settled in Los Angeles, California, and Pickett established a law practice.|$|E
5|$|Set in the 22nd century, {{the series}} follows {{the adventures of}} the first Starfleet {{starship}} Enterprise, registration NX-01. In this episode, {{the crew of the}} Enterprise discover a lost colony of humans in the Delphic Expanse. The colony originated from a <b>wagon</b> <b>train</b> from the American Old West in the 1860s which was abducted as slave labor by an alien race called the Skagarans. The humans overthrew the Skagarans and now treat them as second class citizens.|$|E
25|$|The Mormon Pioneer Overland Travel gathers {{information}} from journals, church history records, {{and other materials}} to locate the company in which an ancestor traveled across the plains to get to Utah. This covers known and unknown <b>wagon</b> <b>trains</b> from 1847-1868. It contains lists of passengers in companies as well as genealogical information about ancestors. It is the most comprehensive list of Mormon immigrants and the <b>wagon</b> <b>trains</b> that brought them to Utah.|$|R

50|$|Edwin Carter, {{who would}} become a noted naturalist in Colorado, worked here from 1848-1859 in a dry goods store. He helped supply Mormon <b>wagon</b> <b>trains.</b>|$|R
5|$|Udell {{recorded}} that in {{the late}} afternoon of August 27, 1858, the Rose–Baley Party reached the Black Mountains. They made their crossing at Sitgreaves Pass, elevation 3,652 feet and named after Lieutenant Lorenzo Sitgreaves, who led an expedition party to the region in 1851. From the crest they could see the Colorado River in the distance. Having traveled all night and worked continuously during the morning and afternoon, the Rose–Baley Party stopped to prepare their first meal of the day. Soon afterward, a small group of Mohave warriors approached and asked, in a combination of broken English and Spanish, how many people their <b>wagon</b> <b>train</b> included and whether they intended to permanently settle near the Colorado River. The Mohave, who appeared friendly and had brought with them corn and melons, which they sold to the emigrants, were promised that the <b>wagon</b> <b>train</b> planned to travel through the region en route to their intended destination in Southern California. This seemed to appease the Natives, many of whom helped the party during their descent down the western slope of the Black Mountains to the Colorado River below. The emigrants were now entering Mohave country, near present-day Needles, California.|$|E
5|$|After {{gold was}} {{discovered}} in the Salmon River area of Idaho, a group of immigrants persuaded an Illinois-born trapper and trader named Tim Goodale to lead them through the cutoff. A large <b>wagon</b> <b>train</b> left in July 1862 and met up with more wagons at Craters of the Moon Lava Field. Numbering 795 men and 300 women and children, the unusually large group was relatively unmolested during its journey and named the cutoff for their guide. Improvements to the cutoff such as adding a ferry to cross the Snake River made it into a popular alternative route of the Oregon Trail.|$|E
5|$|Against Irataba's advice, in 1858 Mohave warriors {{attacked}} the first emigrant <b>wagon</b> <b>train</b> to use Beale's Wagon Road through Mohave country. As a result, the U.S. War Department sent a detachment under Colonel William Hoffman to pacify the tribe. Following {{a series of}} confrontations known as the Mohave War, Hoffman succeeded in dominating the natives, and demanded that they allow the passage of settlers through their territory. To ensure compliance, Fort Mohave was constructed {{near the site of}} the battle in April 1859. Hoffman also imprisoned several Mohave leaders. Having been an advocate for friendly relations with the whites, Irataba became the nation's Aha macave yaltanack, an elected, as opposed to hereditary, leader.|$|E
50|$|Every Labor Day weekend, Ketchum {{hosts the}} Wagon Days festival, a themed {{carnival}} featuring Old West <b>wagon</b> <b>trains,</b> narrow ore <b>wagons,</b> a parade, and simulated street gunfights.|$|R
50|$|In the 1840s {{the first}} <b>wagon</b> <b>trains</b> {{carrying}} immigrants started arriving overland to Oregon (Emigrant Road or Oregon Trail), but the region remained peaceful for some time.|$|R
