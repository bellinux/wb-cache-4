5|$|After {{the match}} against Durham, Australia headed south to The Oval for the Fifth Test, which started on 14 August. Barnes and Tallon {{returned}} from injury, while Ernie Toshack was omitted with knee troubles, and the leg spin of Doug Ring replaced Johnson's off spin. Overnight, hundreds of spectators had slept on wet pavements in rainy <b>weather</b> <b>to</b> queue for tickets. Bradman had already {{announced that he}} would retire {{at the end of the}} season, and the public were anxious to witness his last Test appearance.|$|E
5|$|Apple scab: Apple scab causes {{leaves to}} develop olive-brown spots with a velvety texture that later turn brown and become cork-like in texture. The disease also affects the fruit, which also {{develops}} similar brown spots with velvety or cork-like textures. Apple scab is spread through fungus growing in old apple {{leaves on the}} ground and spreads during warm spring <b>weather</b> <b>to</b> infect the new year's growth.|$|E

5|$|It {{was common}} {{practice}} for ore freighters, even in foul <b>weather,</b> <b>to</b> embark with not all cargo clamps locked {{in place on}} the hatch covers. Maritime author Wolff reported that depending on weather conditions, all the clamps were eventually set within one to two days. Captain Paquette of Wilfred Sykes was dismissive of suggestions that unlocked hatch clamps caused Fitzgerald to founder. He said that he commonly sailed in fine weather using the minimum number of clamps necessary to secure the hatch covers.|$|E
5|$|The United States Exploring Expedition led by Lieutenant Charles Wilkes was {{tasked with}} a vast survey of the Pacific Ocean {{starting}} in 1838. In September 1840 they arrived in Honolulu, where repairs to the ships took longer than expected. Wilkes decided to spend the winter in Hawaii and {{take the opportunity to}} explore its volcanoes while waiting for better <b>weather</b> <b>to</b> continue the expedition. King Kamehameha III assigned American medical missionary Dr. Gerrit P. Judd to the expedition as a translator.|$|E
5|$|The {{precursor}} to Hurricane Donna brought severe <b>weather</b> <b>to</b> the Dakar area of Senegal. Air France Flight AF343, which was flying from Paris, France to Abidjan, Ivory Coast, attempted {{to land at}} the Léopold Sédar Senghor International Airport as a layover. However, due to squally weather, the plane instead crashed into the Atlantic Ocean, killing all 63people on board. Heavy rainfall was also reported in Cape Verde on August30.|$|E

5|$|After the attack, {{the bulk}} of the {{civilian}} population and the remaining Croatian police and troops fled over snow-covered terrain in poor <b>weather</b> <b>to</b> Karlovac, Ogulin, and to the nearby territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Approximately 30–60 civilians, largely elderly people, remained in Saborsko. The JNA and SAO Krajina troops forced those who remained behind to leave the village, killing or abusing the civilians. At least 25 civilians were murdered by the troops {{in the immediate aftermath of}} the capture of Saborsko. Some of the victims were shot, while others were beaten or burned to death.|$|E
5|$|Allied {{aircraft}} specifically started targeting ZNDH and Luftwaffe {{bases and}} aircraft {{for the first}} time as a result of the Seventh anti-Partisan Offensive, including Operation Rösselsprung in late May 1944. Until then Axis aircraft could fly inland almost at will as long as they remained at low altitude. Partisan units on the ground frequently complained about enemy aircraft attacking them while hundreds of Allied aircraft flew above at higher altitude. This changed during Rösselsprung as Allied fighter-bombers went low en-masse {{for the first time}}, establishing full aerial superiority. Consequently, both the ZNDH and Luftwaffe were forced to limit their operations in clear <b>weather</b> <b>to</b> early morning and late afternoon hours.|$|E
5|$|As autumn approaches, Teran takes {{advantage}} of Sea Mither's exhaustion to break free, and conflict between the two starts again. The power struggles cause the <b>weather</b> <b>to</b> change with darkening skies and howling winds. This time, Teran triumphs in the conflict termed the Gore vellye. Control {{of the ocean and}} weather is returned to Teran and Sea Mither is forced to leave. No details are given as to where she spends the winter, but during the storms caused by Teran the fishermen were consoled that Sea Mither would return refreshed and powerful in the spring, to again oust Teran from his malevolent grip over the seas.|$|E

Despite conflicting model data on the specified area where thunderstorms would develop, the newly available information that denoted a more favorable severe thunderstorm setup {{in that part of}} the state prompted the SPC to upgrade the forecasted threat of severe <b>weather</b> <b>to</b> a moderate risk for south-central Kansas, much of the western two-thirds of Oklahoma, and the northwestern and north-central portions Texas at 11:15a.m. CDT that morning, which now indicated an elevated threat of strong tornadoes.|$|E
5|$|Flight Unlimited III is a {{three-dimensional}} (3D) flight simulator video game, {{in which the}} player pilots virtual reproductions of real-world planes. Players may control ten aircraft: the Lake Turbo Renegade, Stemme S10, Mooney Bravo, Fokker Dr.I, Beechjet 400A and five planes first included in Flight Unlimited II. Plane cockpits feature simulated flight instruments such as variometers and primary flight displays, and allow for both visual and instrument navigation. The main airspace is 10,000 square miles of Seattle terrain; eight other Western American states are modeled as well, albeit in less detail. The California scenery from Flight Unlimited II may be imported to expand the airspace. The player shares the game's skies with artificially intelligent (AI) planes. Real-time, interactive air traffic control monitors the player's actions and tries to prevent mid-air collisions. Before a flight, the player may select which types of <b>weather</b> <b>to</b> encounter. Weather conditions such as cold fronts and thunderstorms develop in real-time.|$|E
5|$|In {{the winter}} of 1793, war and {{internal}} disorder had combined with poor <b>weather</b> <b>to</b> leave France facing starvation following {{the collapse of the}} harvest. France's ongoing conflict with her neighbours precluded overland imports; the only nation willing and able to sell grain to the National Convention was the United States. Importing food from the Americas was a highly risky venture, as the British Royal Navy—at war with France since early 1793—patrolled much of the Atlantic passage. To provide effective protection for the vessels involved, a plan was agreed between France and the United States to collect the supplies over a period of months and transport them in a single convoy. A gathering point was arranged at Hampton Roads in the Chesapeake Bay.|$|E

5|$|Richard Nixon {{was buried}} beside his wife Pat {{on the grounds}} of the Nixon Library. He was survived by his two daughters, Tricia and Julie, and four grandchildren. In keeping with his wishes, his funeral was not a full state funeral, though his body did lie in repose in the Nixon Library lobby from April 26 to the morning of the funeral service. Mourners waited in line for up to eight hours in chilly, wet <b>weather</b> <b>to</b> pay their respects. At its peak, the line to pass by Nixon's casket was three miles long with an {{estimated}} 42,000 people waiting.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea about}} the men with the inborn ability to leave their bodies in a spirit form, has also been {{recorded}} in Slovene and Croat traditions. The spirit {{could turn into a}} bull, dog, bore, or some other animal. He intercepted bringers of bad weather, and fought with them to save the crops of his village. The men with this ability were designated by various names, such as vedomec in Tolmin, mogut in Turopolje, vremenjak in Lika and Sinj, legromant or nagromant in southern Dalmatia and the area around Dubrovnik, višćun in Dalmatia, and štrigun in Istria. A vedomec fought against another vedomec, a mogut against another mogut, and so on, and the winner would take bad <b>weather</b> <b>to</b> the region of his defeated foe. All these men were marked by some peculiarity connected with their birth. There were also supernatural beings, such as obilnjaks and brgants in Slovenia, and kombals in Međimurje, who clashed with each other during thunderstorms over the plenty of their territories.|$|E
5|$|The season's {{impact was}} minimal; {{although}} 15tropical cyclones developed, most were weak or remained at sea. Tropical Storm Andrea killed four people after making landfall in Florida and {{moving up the}} East Coast of the United States. In early July, Tropical Storm Chantal moved through the Leeward Islands, causing one fatality, but minimal damage overall. Tropical storms Dorian and Erin and Hurricane Humberto brought only squally <b>weather</b> <b>to</b> the Cape Verde Islands. Mexico, where Hurricane Ingrid, Tropical Depression Eight, and tropical storms Barry and Fernand all made landfall, was the hardest hit; Ingrid alone caused at least 32deaths and $1.5billion (2013USD) in damage. In early October, Karen brought showers and gusty winds to the central Gulf Coast of the United States.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Storm Bonnie was a weak {{tropical}} storm that brought squally <b>weather</b> <b>to</b> the northern Caribbean Sea and Gulf Coast of the United States in July2010. The third tropical cyclone and second named storm of the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season, Bonnie developed from a tropical wave over the Bahamas on July22. It strengthened to a {{tropical storm}} while crossing the islands, and made landfall on the southeastern coast of Florida the following day. Inland, Bonnie weakened to a tropical depression before entering the Gulf of Mexico, where its surface circulation dissipated on July24. The remnants of the storm moved ashore between Louisiana and Mississippi early on July25, prompting severe thunderstorm and tornado warnings in the area.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Flossie yielded stormy <b>weather</b> <b>to</b> Hawaii in late July2013. The sixth {{tropical}} cyclone and named storm {{of the annual}} hurricane season, Flossie originated from a tropical wave that emerged off the western coast of Africa on July9. Tracking westward across the Atlantic with little development, it passed over Central America and into the eastern Pacific Ocean on July18, where favorable environmental conditions promoted steady organization. By 0600UTC on July25, the wave acquired enough organization to be deemed a tropical depression; it intensified into a tropical storm six hours later. Continuing westward, Flossie attained peak winds of 70mph (110km/h) on July27 before entering the central Pacific Ocean. There, unfavorable upper-level winds established a weakening trend; on July30, Flossie weakened to a tropical depression, and by 1200UTC that same day, the storm degenerated into a remnant low, northeast of Kauai.|$|E
5|$|While Ophelia {{was still}} {{impacting}} Newfoundland, forecasters in the United Kingdom warned residents that {{the remnants of}} the storm would bring unsettled <b>weather</b> <b>to</b> the nation within a few days. In the midst of a record-breaking heat wave, with temperatures reaching an all-time monthly record high of 86 °F (29.9 °C), the storm was expected to bring much cooler weather across the region. Strong winds and heavy rains were also anticipated, leading to the cancellation of ferry services. Plummeting temperatures in association with {{the remnants of the}} storm were expected to produce snowfall across the United Kingdom as well. In Donegal the first snows of the season fell, leaving hundreds of residents without electricity.|$|E
