Most residents' places of work are in surrounding towns, with their location in the parish largely dictating <b>where</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> work. The 2005 survey identified that residents in the south {{of the parish}} (Falcon Fields and Ravenswing/Pinelands) travel towards Tadley and Basingstoke whereas those further north in the parish tend to find work in Reading, Newbury and London.|$|E

2500|$|Mark Chorvinsky, {{editor of}} Strange magazine, {{promoted}} Wallace's {{claim that he}} tipped off Patterson exactly <b>where</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> a Bigfoot. Chorvinsky wrote, [...] "'Roger Patterson came [...] dozens of times pumping me on this Bigfoot,' Ray Wallace explained to researcher Dennis Pilchis in 1982. 'I felt sorry for Roger Patterson. He {{told me he had}} cancer of the lymph glands and he was desperately broke and he wanted to try to get something where he could have a little income. Well, he went down there exactly where I told him. I told him, 'You go down there and hang around on that bank. Stay up there and watch that spot.'" [...] David Daegling summarized Chorvinsky's argument and concluded that Wallace [...] "had a degree of involvement" [...] with the Patterson–Gimlin film, and that this gave grounds for suspicion of it.|$|E
2500|$|After the {{destruction}} of Tenochtitlan, the Templo Mayor, {{like most of the}} rest of the city, was taken apart and covered over by the new Spanish colonial city. The Temple’s exact location was forgotten, although by the 20th-century scholars had a good idea <b>where</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> it. This was based on the archeological work done at the end of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th. Leopoldo Batres did some excavation work at the end of the 19th century under the Mexico City Metropolitan Cathedral because at this time, the temple was thought to be there. [...] In the first decades of the 20th century, Manuel Gamio found part of the southwest corner of the temple and his finds were put on public display. However, it did not generate great public interest in excavating further because the zone was an upper-class residential area. [...] In 1933, Emilio Cuevas found part of a staircase and beam. In 1948, Hugo Moedano and Elma Estrada Balmori excavated a platform containing serpent heads and offerings. In 1966, Eduardo Contreras and Jorge Angula excavated a chest containing offerings that was first explored by Gamio.|$|E
