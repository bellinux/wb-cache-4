5|$|Schuyler and {{original}} Degrassi series head writer Yan Moore began {{developing a new}} television drama in 1999. As the months progressed, they {{began to think about}} <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> characters of Degrassi High to develop a school-reunion theme. However, they decided that a series would not work effectively if based around adults instead of children. Moore realized that the character Emma Nelson, born at the end of Degrassi Junior Highs second season, would soon be entering junior high school, and development for the series took a new direction by focusing on Emma and her school experiences.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{the morning}} of 1 April 2013, the Facebook and Twitter {{accounts}} of Valor por Tamaulipas were shut down unexpectedly and without any explanation. A new page with the same name was created by other administrators, who said {{that they did not know}} <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> original administrator but that they wanted to continue his work nonetheless. This raised concerns about who was actually working behind the scenes to keep the page running. Another page run by other users and with a similar name, Responsabilidad por Tamaulipas ("Responsibility for Tamaulipas"), posted on their page that Valor por Tamaulipas had only closed temporarily in order to improve the page and protect the administrator. They advised online users to ignore websites that posed as the original page.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Lobengula {{moved to}} the north-east, now well out of the Company's reach for the {{foreseeable}} future. However, his sickness, {{which turned out to}} be smallpox, sharply intensified and eventually killed him on 22 or 23 January 1894. With the king dead, Mjaan, the most senior of the izinDuna, took command of the Matabele. Mjaan was an old man, and his only son had been killed in the war. He wished to make peace. In late February 1894, he convened an indaba at which he and his contemporaries met with James Dawson, a trader known to them for many years, who offered the olive branch on behalf of the Company. The izinDuna unanimously accepted. They also told the trader <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Shangani Patrol, and led him to the battle site to survey it, as well as to examine and identify the largely skeletonised bodies of the soldiers, which still lay where they had fallen. Dawson was the first non-Matabele to learn of the last stand.|$|E

5|$|Young Como started {{helping his}} family at age 10, working {{before and after}} school in Steve Fragapane's barber shop for 50¢ a week. By age 13, he had {{graduated}} to having his own chair in the Fragapane barber shop, although he stood on a box to tend to his customers. It was also around this time that young Como lost his week's wages in a dice game. Filled with shame, he locked himself in his room and did not come out until hunger {{got the better of}} him. He managed to tell his father <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> money his family depended on. His father told him he was entitled to make a mistake and that he hoped his son would never do anything worse than this. When Perry was 14, his father became unable to work because of a severe heart condition. Como and his brothers became the support of the household.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of May, Operation Bernhard was officially closed down and the prisoners were transported from the caves to the nearby Ebensee {{concentration}} camp. They were divided into three groups, and a truck was to make trips {{to and from the}} camp. An order had been issued that the prisoners were to be killed, but only once they were together at Ebensee. The truck delivered the first two groups to the camp, where the men were housed separately from the general camp population. On the third journey the vehicle broke down after it had picked up the final group of prisoners; the men in the last group were marched to the camp, which took two days. As the order had specified that the prisoners had to be killed together, the first two groups were kept safe to await their comrades. Because of the delay with the third journey and the close proximity of the advancing Allied army, on 5 May the first two groups were released from their isolation into the general population and their SS guards fled. That afternoon the third group arrived at the camp. When the guards learned <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> first two groups, they also released their prisoners into the main prison population and fled. The Americans arrived the following day and liberated the camp.|$|E
25|$|The {{remaining}} {{ships of}} the 4th destroyer flotilla formed up behind Commander Walter Allen of Broke, {{who was the}} half-flotilla leader and now assumed command. The ships resumed their original position following the fleet, but failed to report to Jellicoe <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> destroyers, or the sighting of German battleships.|$|E

25|$|<b>What</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Jews {{from the}} ghetto became known when on March 16 and 17, several vans {{returned}} to the ghetto carrying the personal property {{of the people who}} had been murdered. The clothing bore mudstains and signs of having been hastily removed. For example, stockings were still attached to garters. A detail was assigned to sort and clean these items, many of the items were recognized by name tags and other indicia of ownership.|$|E
25|$|Michelle Garvey {{went missing}} from New London, Connecticut, presumably after {{running away from}} home, on June 1, 1982, {{at the age of}} fourteen. She was {{believed}} to have intended to return to her birth state, New Jersey, or to North Carolina. She had a previous history of running away, according to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Initially, it was unknown <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> victim, as she may have left home {{to start a new life}} and could possibly be alive.|$|E
25|$|When the war ended, {{both the}} occupying powers and the {{families}} of the deceased began trying to learn <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bodies of those executed. In many cases it was impossible, as documentation was unavailable and what bodies and samples remained were rarely identifiable. The identities of those Stieve did his research on only became known almost 70 years after the war when a list he had compiled in 1946 for a Protestant minister trying to help some of the relatives of Plötzensee inmates find their remains. They were published in a medical journal by another researcher, Sabine Hildebrandt.|$|E

500|$|The Australasian {{claimed that}} three policemen {{at the ground}} idled and allowed the rioters to attack the Englishmen. [...] They said that the riot [...] "forever made the match memorable {{in the annals of}} New South Wales cricket", and lamented the fact that [...] "rowdyism became rampant {{for the rest of the}} afternoon". The paper asked the {{question}} [...] "What will they say in England?" [...] Wisden condemned the unrest as a [...] "deplorably disgraceful affair" [...] and described the spectators as a [...] "rough and excited mob". Richard Driver of the New South Wales Cricket Association (NSWCA) issued a statement of regret for <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> tourists.|$|E
500|$|On-stage gimmicks {{have long}} {{been a part of}} {{performances}} at the competition. Lena Philipsson's use of a microphone stand in her performance of [...] "Det gör ont" [...] at the 2004 competition is an example. When Philipsson hosted Melodifestivalen in 2006, four tongue-in-cheek short films were broadcast during the semifinals to show <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> microphone stand in the years since her win. Pyrotechnics are another common gimmick in Melodifestivalen performances. After the 2007 event, Karolina Lassbo of Dagens Media criticised the festival's musical content and production, arguing that the 1988 competition was [...] "the time when Melodifestivalen was still a schlager competition" [...] and the event had become [...] "a cross between [...] Fame Factory and [...] Stadskampen".|$|E
500|$|Writers often extolled McCain for {{his courage}} {{not just in}} war but in politics, and wrote sympathetically about him. McCain's shift of {{political}} stances and attitudes during and especially after the 2008 presidential campaign, including his self-repudiation of the maverick label, left many writers expressing sadness and wondering <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> McCain {{they thought they had}} known. [...] By 2013, some aspects of the older McCain had returned, and his image became that of a kaleidoscope of contradictory tendencies, including, as one writer listed, [...] "the maverick, the former maverick, the curmudgeon, the bridge builder, the war hero bent on transcending the call of self-interest to serve a cause greater than himself, the sore loser, old bull, last lion, loose cannon, happy warrior, elder statesman, lion in winter...." ...|$|E

500|$|There {{was long}} {{uncertainty}} about <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> earl's body. [...] The French chronicler Jehan de Waurin claimed that Arundel had simply been buried in Beauvais. [...] In the mid-nineteenth century, however, the chaplain of the Duke of Norfolk {{came upon the}} will of Arundel's squire, Fulk Eyton, when he died later in 1454. [...] Eyton maintained therein that he had secured the earl's body and brought it back to England, {{for which he had}} been rewarded with a payment of 1400 Marks. [...] The body was disinterred brought back to England, then entombed in the Fitzalan Chapel of Arundel Castle, as Arundel had expressly wished for in his own will. [...] On 16 November 1857, the tomb in the Arundel chapel carrying the earl's effigy was opened. [...] In it was found a skeleton measuring over six feet, with a missing leg.|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} critics who viewed the episode when it aired were equally taken with [...] "Asian F". The Atlantic Kevin Fallon called it Glee [...] "best ever", while others, {{including}} Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone and Abby West of Entertainment Weekly {{said it was}} the best one of the new third season. Vanity Fair Brett Berk wrote, [...] "This week's episode stands out {{as one of the most}} cohesive and well acted in the series's pantheon", though he wondered <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> show's humorous side, something also noted by Futterman, who found it to be a significant problem: [...] "Glee's own identity crisis of not knowing whether or not it's a sitcom has made it hard to get deeply invested in its characters." [...] Amy Reiter of The Los Angeles Times wrote that [...] "the producers hit every note (emotional, musical, character, plot) as squarely as Rachel Berry auditioning for a coveted role", and the episode [...] "had emotional truth, character growth, new revelations and really good musical numbers: the kind that seem to emerge organically from the plot and deepen and advance it." [...] AOLTV Crystal Bell said the episode delivered on the setup in the previous [...] "I Am Unicorn" [...] outing, and said [...] "it definitely seems to echo the glory days" [...] of the first season. TV Guide later included [...] "Asian F" [...] in its list of 2011's Top TV Episodes.|$|E
500|$|M.I.A. {{has been}} a {{supporter}} of WikiLeaks and Julian Assange. In her own book, M.I.A. wrote regarding Wikileaks, [...] "So obviously I love Wikileaks because, after I’d gone through the whole backlash, {{they were the first}} news information site to confirm any news on the Sri Lankan war in the truest form; they were the first to release information stating the truth about <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Tamils as I knew it and to reveal that the United Nations was aware that the Sri Lankan government was lying—war crimes had been committed but their hands were tied because any time anyone tried to impose sanctions, governments would walk out. [...] I support Wikileaks because of that." [...] She composed the theme to Assange's television show The World Tomorrow and later stood by Assange's side as he held a press conference at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London where Assange was successfully granted political asylum by Ecuador in August 2012. [...] "I ask President Obama to do the right thing. The United States must renounce its witch hunt against WikiLeaks," [...] Assange said at the press conference. She posted a photo of Assange from within the embassy, and later tweeted, [...] "hummmm after this day 2things have 2 happen....., either 500 cops turn up outside every rape case reported even if it's without charge. or we get raped by the powerz that be and we deal 4eva." [...] The tweets were in reference to an arrest warrant the Swedish Prosecutor's Office issued in August 2010 for Assange on two charges: rape and molestation. Earlier in 2012 Britain's Supreme Court denied an appeal by Assange to avoid extradition to Sweden to face these charges. In November 2013, Assange appeared via Skype to open M.I.A.'s New York City concert. Also, on 18 September 2014 Maya tweeted a link to a documentary on YouTube entitled [...] "The Internet's Own Boy: Aaron Swartz". The documentary is about the life of Aaron Swartz, who was a computer programmer, writer, political organiser and Internet hacktivist. In the same tweet Maya included a link and invitation to RSVP to a party to launch Julian Assange's new book [...] "When Google Met WikiLeaks".|$|E
