40|$|Tittle (Thema works) : Validation of Measurement Wind Assistance in the 100 Metre Sprint Student: Bc. Martin Vokoun Supervisor: PhDr. Aleš Kaplan, Ph. D. Aims: To {{practically}} {{verify the}} relevance measurement by the <b>wind</b> - <b>gauge</b> in the 100 metre sprint {{according to the}} current rules of athletics and compare them with our experimental measurement. Methods: We used an experimental measurement and methodological study for this diploma thesis. The essence of this work was measurement by five other <b>wind</b> - <b>gauges</b> bordering the 1 OOmetres track, whereas {{one of them was}} placed on the opposite side than the official one and the other ones. The essence of this methodological study was a confrontation of advantages and disadvantages of current measurement by one <b>wind</b> - <b>gauge</b> and our experimental one. Results: Thanks to our experimental measurement and following methodological study we reached the result that to provide higher objectivity of measurement the wind assistance we need two <b>wind</b> - <b>gauges</b> standing against each other (at the inner and the outer border of the track). Further we made sure that measurement by larger number of <b>wind</b> - <b>gauges</b> is more objective than measurement with one <b>wind</b> - <b>gauge.</b> But in the most of cases the dates of the official <b>wind</b> - <b>gauge</b> are approximately the same as the average dates [...] ...|$|R

Finally, participants answered questions related to comprehension of the hurricane forecasts. These included two questions specifically relevant to the current research question: “The display shows the hurricane getting larger over time.” and “The display indicates that the forecasters are less certain about {{the path of the}} hurricane as time passes.” These questions also included a measure of the participants’ understanding of the response glyphs used in the experiment by asking them to indicate which of two <b>wind</b> <b>gauges</b> had a higher speed or to match the size of circles. Participants who did not adequately answer these questions were excluded from the analysis (two participants for the <b>wind</b> speed <b>gauges,</b> one for the size circles).|$|R

The simplest devices are strings of beads, thumbwheels or [...] "clickers" [...] that a player advances by one after each stroke and provide a total for the player to write on their scorecard after each hole; newer variations have various degrees of computational power added and can keep score for multiple holes, total scores, and keep track of over/under par statistics.

50|$|Early {{versions}} had {{a traditional}} two settee salon, while boats produced in 1968 and after feature {{a more modern}} galley starboard and settee to port. Both have a spacious V-berth over six feet long and were available with either a 30-HP Universal Atomic 4 gas inboard or an outboard well. The cockpit can comfortably accommodate 4-6 people, and the boat can sleep 4 adults below decks. Standard steering on the boat was with a tiller, but many owners have installed after-market wheel steering. Other typical upgrades would include a roller furling headstay to replace the original forestay, and upgraded instrumentation such as depth, speed, and <b>wind</b> <b>gauges,</b> which did not come standard on the original boats.

500|$|As Iniki {{turned to}} the north, it {{continued}} to strengthen, reaching a peak of 145mph (235km/h) winds on September 11 while 170miles (270km) south-southwest of Poipū {{on the island of}} Kauai. It continued rapidly to the north-northeast, and made landfall on south-central Kauai early on the 11th with sustained winds of 145mph (235km/h), making Iniki a Category4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. The National Weather Service reported wind gusts of up to 175mph (280km/h).

[...] According to the Honolulu Advertiser, that remarkable figure was recorded at a digital weather station whose <b>wind</b> <b>gauging</b> equipment blew off after taking the measurement during the storm.

After 5 hours of fighting the Ottoman fleet withdrew with 6 ships badly damaged. Flangini was unconscious and no attempt was made by the Venetians to get the <b>wind</b> <b>gauge,</b> and they retired to Thermia.

50|$|In 1908, the {{original}} tower was demolished {{and a new}} reinforced three-story late Gothic Revival concrete tower, 20 feet 6 inches wide and 32 feet 8 inches high was constructed in its place.

The tower has a crenelated top and a cornice containing dentils. The windows are double-hung sash with a shallow recessed arch over the windows on the first and second floors.The new tower provided the durable weather-resistant, vibration-free environment necessary for accurate instrument readings.

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{relationship}} between magnetic flux generation, taken as an indicator of large-scale dynamo action, and magnetic helicity, computed as an integral over the dynamo volume, in a simple dynamo. We consider dynamo action driven by Magneto-Rotational Turbulence (MRT) within the shearing-box approximation. We consider magnetically open boundary conditions that allow a flux of helicity in or out of the computational domain. We circumvent the problem of the lack of gauge invariance in open domains by choosing a particular <b>gauge</b> [...] the <b>winding</b> <b>gauge</b> [...] that provides a natural interpretation in terms of average winding number of pairwise field lines. We use this gauge precisely to define and measure the helicity and helicity flux for several realizations of dynamo action. We find in these cases, that the system as a whole does not break reflectional symmetry and the total helicity remains small even in cases when substantial magnetic flux is generated. We find no particular connection between the generation of magnetic flux and the helicity or the helicity flux through the boundaries. We suggest that this result {{may be due to the}} essentially nonlinear nature of the dynamo processes in MRT. Comment: 26 pages, 10 figures, ApJ accepte...|$|R

40|$|Recently, MIT group found a {{numerical}} {{solution to the}} non-abelian gauge field theory. This solution is shown to contain non-integer topological numbers. By using this fact, V. V. Khoze has proved that the vacuum theta-angle is zero in non-abelian gauge field theories. Here, we study the vacuum structure by a complimentary way-its physical respect. The key point is that MIT solution has an infinite action, which means there is no tunnelling between the noninteger topological field configrations although the continuous fractional gauge transformations which is allowed in Minkowski space eliminate the topological distinction between different winding number sections. Using this fact,we prove that the θ is zero at a semiclassical level. In the classical picture, the vacuum of the non-abelian gauge theories is a many-state θ vacuum[1]. Only the integer <b>winding</b> number <b>gauge</b> transformations are allowed[2]. Correspondingly the vacuum states are the integer topological number field configurations which are connected by the instanton tunnelling[3].
