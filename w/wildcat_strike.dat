5|$|On 18 June 2009, {{fewer than}} 200 {{contractors}} {{walked out of}} or {{failed to show up}} in a <b>wildcat</b> <b>strike,</b> showing solidarity with workers at the Lindsey Oil Refinery in Lincolnshire where 51 workers had been laid off while another employer on the site was employing. A spokeswoman said the strike did not affect electricity output.|$|E
5|$|Early in his {{political}} career, Debs {{was a member}} of the Democratic Party. He was elected as a Democrat to the Indiana General Assembly in 1884. After working with several smaller unions, including the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen, Debs was instrumental in the founding of the American Railway Union (ARU), one of the nation's first industrial unions. After workers at the Pullman Palace Car Company organized a <b>wildcat</b> <b>strike</b> over pay cuts in the summer of 1894, Debs signed many into the ARU. He called a boycott of the ARU against handling trains with Pullman cars, in what became the nationwide Pullman Strike, affecting most lines west of Detroit, and more than 250,000 workers in 27 states. To keep the mail running, President Grover Cleveland used the United States Army to break the strike. As a leader of the ARU, Debs was convicted of federal charges for defying a court injunction against the strike and served six months in prison.|$|E
25|$|Discipline (including loss {{of health}} and pension benefits) and/or {{discharge}} for any employee who participated in or caused a <b>wildcat</b> <b>strike,</b> but no punishment for honoring the picket line established by a <b>wildcat</b> <b>strike.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Employers {{were willing}} to make {{concessions}} on wages and benefits. Workers in other basic industries such as steel and automobile manufacturing were making much more money than coal miners, even though their occupations were not nearly as dangerous to health or safety. However, the mine operators demanded an end to <b>wildcat</b> <b>strikes.</b> [...] Employer contributions to UMWA's health and pension plans were dependent {{on the amount of}} coal mined. <b>Wildcat</b> <b>strikes</b> significantly reduced the tonnage mined, and reduced the revenues flowing into the UMWA health and pension plans. The employers argued they should not make higher payments to offset the effect of the <b>wildcat</b> <b>strikes.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{strike is}} decided on by a {{prescribed}} democratic process (<b>wildcat</b> <b>strikes</b> are illegal).|$|R
25|$|However, in {{a larger}} sense, the {{contract}} was a failure. The union members' unhappiness with the new collective bargaining agreement led to a continuing wave of <b>wildcat</b> <b>strikes.</b> Miller's democratic reforms had energized his critics and decentralized the union so that unity was now {{much more difficult to}} achieve. The number of <b>wildcat</b> <b>strikes</b> only increased through 1976, driving away many potential members and slowing organizing growth.|$|R
25|$|The <b>wildcat</b> <b>strike</b> ended {{after five}} days, with the {{government}} and AUPE agreeing to a new occupational health and safety review for the Edmonton Remand Centre, and no retribution for individual members involved in the <b>wildcat</b> <b>strike.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{right of}} local unions to strike—not wages—was the primary {{issue in the}} negotiations. Low coal prices in the 1930s drove coal {{operators}} to cut wages. During the Franklin Roseveldt administration, UMWA and other unions established industry-wide national collective bargaining agreements. In UMWA's case, this meant stripping local unions {{of the right to}} strike without the international union's approval. But <b>wildcat</b> <b>strikes</b> had become common in the coal industry. UMWA miners grew frustrated with the terms of national contracts and dispute resolution and grievances. Democratic reforms within the Mine Workers and the 1974 contract had not released the pressure which caused <b>wildcat</b> <b>strikes.</b> Absent the right to strike, UMWA's democracy movement rejected labor peace and <b>wildcat</b> <b>strikes</b> had become even more common.|$|R

25|$|By {{the late}} 1970s, International Harvester {{had come to}} believe that {{unlimited}} transfer rights were being abused and creating productivity problems. The company also instituted a new disciplinary program to crack down on wildcat strikes, and outlasted one UAW local when it engaged in a five-week-long <b>wildcat</b> <b>strike</b> in 1978 in an attempt to have the program withdrawn.|$|E
25|$|TTC General Manager Rick Ducharme {{announced}} his resignation on June 7, 2006, following a one-day <b>wildcat</b> <b>strike</b> by transit workers. He blamed political interference for his decision, saying that Moscoe had conducted direct {{negotiations with the}} union without consulting him. The Toronto Star speculated that the illegal strike might have resulted from Moscoe's negotiations, while David Shiner and other councilors said that Moscoe {{had a history of}} interfering in management affairs. John Barber, a columnist for the rival Globe and Mail, argued that Ducharme's resignation was not a reasonable response to Moscoe's alleged interference. Moscoe defended his actions, arguing that he had an obligation {{to take part in the}} discussions and was attempting to ensure that a second strike did not take place. He later said that management was to blame for the <b>wildcat</b> <b>strike,</b> and that he intervened in an attempt to stop it.|$|E
25|$|During the TTC workers' <b>wildcat</b> <b>strike</b> on May 29, 2006, Giambrone was {{prominent}} in the media representing the TTC's position as commission chair Howard Moscoe was out of town.

25|$|In 1996, AUPE’s {{fight back}} began to bear fruit. In late 1995, laundry workers at Foothills Hospital in Calgary {{went on a}} week-long <b>wildcat</b> <b>strike</b> to protest the Calgary Health Region's {{decision}} to contract out laundry services to Edmonton-based K-Bro. With massive support from other AUPE locals, unions and the Calgary public, this group of workers forced Premier Klein to make a concession.|$|E
25|$|The {{official}} ground breaking {{ceremony was}} held June 16, 1961 at {{the construction site}} of the new NORAD Combat Operations Center. Generals Lee (ADC) and Laurence S. Kuter (NORAD) simultaneously set off symbolic dynamite charges. On December 20, 1961, with excavation 53% complete there were 200 workers that walked off on what Cecil Welton, Utah Construction Company project manager, called a <b>wildcat</b> <b>strike</b> after a worker was fired for disobeying safety rules. Workers returned three days later and the fired worker was returned to his position.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the <b>wildcat</b> <b>strike,</b> the Minister of Justice and Solicitor General Jonathan Denis {{remained}} largely quiet, with most statements actually being {{issued by the}} Alberta Deputy Premier Thomas Lukaszuk. Deputy Premier Lukaszuk repeated throughout the strike that the province would not negotiate with the AUPE until the strike ended and staff returned to work. In the meantime, the province enacted a contingency plan that included enlisting RCMP officers from Alberta and out of province to work as temporary guards, a plan that cost the province roughly $1.2 million a day.|$|E

25|$|Miller {{initiated}} several {{democratic reforms}} which affected the renegotiation {{of the national}} coal collective bargaining agreement. UMWA's bargaining demands were now set by a 36-member bargaining council rather than {{the president and his}} aides. Tentative agreements now were subject to approval by the bargaining council and member ratification. <b>Wildcat</b> <b>strikes</b> had become common in the coal industry as union miners grew frustrated with what they saw as poor terms of national contracts and employer foot-dragging on resolving disputes and grievances. Miller hoped that these democratic reforms would decrease the number of <b>wildcat</b> <b>strikes.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Wildcat</b> <b>strikes</b> {{have been}} {{considered}} illegal in the United States since 1935. The 1932 Norris-La Guardia Act held that clauses in labor contracts barring employees from joining unions were not enforceable, thus granting employees the right to unionize regardless of their workplace situation. Unions {{have the power to}} bargain collectively on behalf of their members and to call for strikes demanding concessions from employers. Under the 1935 National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), federal courts have held that <b>wildcat</b> <b>strikes</b> are illegal and that employers may fire workers participating in them.|$|R
25|$|The Pullman Strike was a {{nationwide}} railroad strike in the United States on May 11, 1894, and {{a turning point}} for US labor law. It pitted the American Railway Union (ARU) against the Pullman Company, the main railroads, and the federal government of the United States under President Grover Cleveland. The strike and boycott shut down much of the nation's freight and passenger traffic west of Detroit, Michigan. The conflict began in Pullman, Chicago, on May 11 when nearly 4,000 factory employees of the Pullman Company began a <b>wildcat</b> <b>strike</b> in response to recent reductions in wages.|$|E
25|$|Tension on the New York piers was mounting. ILA loyalists {{and many}} other longshormen were at best {{suspicious}} of the IBL, which they viewed as a machine of the Waterfront Commission and a scab union—an organization of workers perceived as having a role in strike breaking. By early March1954, the storm finally hit when Teamster boss David Beck was perceived as betraying the ILA by refusing to cross an IBL picket line. News spread and on piers up and down Manhattan, ILA longshoremen refused to touch Teamster deliveries. Gangs of longshoremen walked off the docks in a <b>wildcat</b> <b>strike.</b>|$|E
25|$|On December 31, 2012, an {{apparent}} sick-out occurred. In early December 2012, Mayor Gray announced bonuses for all city workers except police and firefighters. On New Year's Eve, more than 100 firefighters, paramedics, and EMTs unexpectedly called in sick. Usually, about 20 of the 440 firefighters on duty call in sick each day. DCFEMS confirmed that some firetrucks sat idle due to low staffing. The city accused the firefighters' and paramedics' unions of organizing an illegal <b>wildcat</b> <b>strike,</b> while both unions denied it. The incident {{led to a}} number of off-duty staff being called in, significant overtime, and delayed care.|$|E

25|$|Despite Boyle's efforts, the {{political}} pressure exerted by the black-lung miners {{was effective in}} the long run. Media images of hacking, dying miners -- most of them young men in their 30s and 40s -- caused a public outcry. Throughout the lobbying effort for the bill, Miller accused UMWA of ignoring rank-and-file miners' needs. This undercut Boyle's power, which rested on his claim that he alone represented the legitimate concerns of mine workers. On February 18, 1969, Miller {{and thousands of other}} West Virginia miners launched a 23-day <b>wildcat</b> <b>strike</b> to demand enactment of the black-lung bill. The strike led the legislature to pass the bill, which was {{the first of its kind}} in the U.S.|$|E
25|$|By {{the morning}} of Saturday April 27, all 10 correctional centres in Alberta (in Calgary, Edmonton, Peace River, Medicine Hat, Lethbridge & Red Deer) were all {{actively}} participating in the <b>wildcat</b> <b>strike.</b> The Alberta Provincial Government petitioned the Alberta Labour Relations Board and, after the Board ruled that the strike was illegal, filed an Injunction against the Correctional Officers demanding they cease strike actions and return to work. The injunction was ignored and officers have continued striking throughout Saturday and Sunday. Support for the officers was apparently from as far as Saskatchewan as a bus full of Saskatchewan Correctional Officers arrived at the Edmonton Remand Centre on Sunday afternoon to march with the AUPE members in solidarity. Correctional Officer positions were filled using RCMP Officers and Tactical Team Members of local Police Services as available.|$|E
25|$|On Friday April 26, 2013, Correctional Peace Officers across Alberta {{walked off}} the job or {{actively}} refused to enter Correctional Centers in solidarity to the <b>wildcat</b> <b>strike</b> started at the Edmonton Remand Centre. The initial event that started the strike is cited by the AUPE as the indefinite suspension of two union members after they voiced concerns over health and safety issues at the Edmonton Remand Centre. However, emails to the site's Executive Director which contained crude and disrespectful comments were the driving force for the union members' suspension. The centre had only been in use for two weeks; it received its first inmates on April 12, 2013, even though the AUPE - which represents the Correctional Officers - submitted a five-page list of deficiencies on April 11, 2013.|$|E
