5|$|Most {{observed}} white dwarfs {{have relatively}} high surface temperatures, between 8,000K and 40,000K. A white dwarf, though, spends {{more of its}} lifetime at cooler temperatures than at hotter temperatures, so <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>expect</b> {{that there are more}} cool white dwarfs than hot white dwarfs. Once we adjust for the selection effect that hotter, more luminous white dwarfs are easier to observe, we do find that decreasing the temperature range examined results in finding more white dwarfs. This trend stops when we reach extremely cool white dwarfs; few white dwarfs are observed with surface temperatures below 4,000K, and one of the coolest so far observed, WD 0346+246, has a surface temperature of approximately 3,900K. The {{reason for this is that}} the Universe's age is finite; there has not been enough time for white dwarfs to cool below this temperature. The white dwarf luminosity function can therefore be used to find the time when stars started to form in a region; an estimate for the age of our Galactic disk found in this way is 8 billion years. A white dwarf will eventually, in many trillions of years, cool and become a non-radiating black dwarf in approximate thermal equilibrium with its surroundings and with the cosmic background radiation. No black dwarfs are thought to exist yet.|$|E

Owing in part to the lack of a definitive narrative outlining its rationale, proponents offered divergent or seemingly conflicting viewpoints. While many writers focused primarily upon American expansionism, be it into Mexico or across the Pacific, others saw the term as a call to example. Without an agreed upon interpretation, much less an elaborated political philosophy, these conflicting views of America's destiny were never resolved. This variety of possible meanings was summed up by Ernest Lee Tuveson: [...] "A vast complex of ideas, policies, and actions is comprehended under the phrase [...] "Manifest Destiny".
