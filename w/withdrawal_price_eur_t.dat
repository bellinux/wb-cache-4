This right, which is sometime known by its French name droit de suite, is personal to the artist and can only be transferred by inheritance.

Works of art which are covered by this resale right are [...] "works of graphic or plastic art such as pictures, collages, paintings, drawings, engravings, prints, lithographs, sculptures, tapestries, ceramics, glassware and photographs, provided they are made by the artist herself or himself or are copies which have been made in limited numbers by the artist or under his or her authority." ...|$|R

40|$|Production of refuse {{derived fuel}} from {{municipal}} solid waste in future shall play a strategic role in an integrated waste management system. The amount of landfilled biodegradable materials thus will be diminished according to provisions of the 1999 Waste Landfill Directive. The aim {{of this article is}} to evaluate cost effectiveness based on cost evaluation of the different complication of the waste pre-treatment equipment complectation and based on regenerable waste quantities in Latvia. The comparison of cost estimates is done in 3 scenarios considering potential waste quantities in Latvia: Scenario I - planned annual waste quantity is 20 kT; Scenario II - 40 kT and Scenario III - 160 kT. An increase in amount of waste and processing capacity means the decrease in costs of mechanical pre-treatment of 1 ton of waste. Thus, costs of mechanical sorting line under different scenarios with capacities of 10 t h- 1, 20 t h- 1 and 80 t h- 1 are <b>EUR</b> 32 per <b>t,</b> <b>EUR</b> 24 per <b>t</b> and <b>EUR</b> 15 per <b>t,</b> respectively. Most feasible cost for a set of mechanical pre-treatment equipment for the capacity of 10 t h- 1 is <b>EUR</b> 32 per <b>t</b> by using rotating drum screener with the following manual sorting. Mechanical pre-treatment equipment of unsorted municipal waste is economically nonbeneficial, when the use of fine (biologically degradable) fraction is not possible. As the sorting of biodegradable kitchen waste is not developed under the current waste management system in Latvia, the lines for mechanical pre-treatment of household waste would be better to install in landfills...|$|R

The C12 Zagato featured all-new design elements inspired by Formula 1. Though the exterior styling is {{somewhat of a}} departure from the C8, retained features include: scissor doors, interior styling, and general aviation theme. The C12 Zagato is powered by a 6.0 L W12 engine sourced from VW Group (the same engine as featured in the Audi A8 and Volkswagen Phaeton). For the C12 Zagato, Spyker Cars have tuned the W12 to produce 500-bhp. The engine is mated to a five-speed automatic gearbox with paddle shifters. Although the nomenclature suggests otherwise, the C12 Zagato is not based upon the C12 LaTurbie prototype.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{calculate}} {{total costs}} {{during the first}} year after diagnosis in 463 patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) included during 2006 - 09 (T 2) and compare the results with a similar cohort included in 1996 - 98 (T 1). METHOD: Clinical and laboratory data were collected regularly in both cohorts, and patients completed biannual questionnaires reporting health care utilization and number of days lost from work. RESULTS: Disease activity was similar in both cohorts T 1 and T 2 at inclusion. Significant improvements were seen {{during the first year}} in both cohorts but were more pronounced in T 2. Outpatient care increased and hospitalization decreased in T 2 compared with T 1. Almost 3 % of patients had surgery in both cohorts, but in T 2, only women had surgery. Drug costs were higher in T 2 than in <b>T</b> 1 (<b>EUR</b> 689 vs. <b>EUR</b> 435). In <b>T</b> 2, 12 % of drug costs were direct costs and 4 % were total costs. The corresponding values for T 1 were 9 % and 3 %. In T 1, 50 % were prescribed disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) at inclusion, compared to T 2, where prescription was > 90 %. Direct costs were <b>EUR</b> 5716 in <b>T</b> 2 and <b>EUR</b> 4674 in <b>T</b> 1. Costs for sick leave were lower in T 2 than in <b>T</b> 1 (<b>EUR</b> 5490 vs. EUR 9055) but disability pensions were higher (EUR 4152 vs. EUR 2139), resulting in unchanged total costs. In T 1, direct costs comprised 29 % and indirect costs 71 % of the total costs. The corresponding values for T 2 were 37 % and 63 %. CONCLUSIONS: The earlier and more aggressive treatment of RA with traditional DMARDs in T 2 resulted in better outcomes compared to T 1. Direct costs were higher in T 2, partly offset by decreased sick leave, but total costs remained unchanged.

5|$|Prized for its {{meat and}} fins, the {{porbeagle}} {{has long been}} under heavy fishing pressure. The meat is sold fresh, frozen, or dried and salted, and ranks among the most valuable of any shark: in 1997 and 1998 it had a wholesale <b>price</b> of <b>EUR</b> 5–7/kg, four {{times that of the}} blue shark (Prionace glauca). Most of the demand comes from Europe, though the United States and Japan also import this species. The fins are shipped to East Asia for use in shark fin soup. The remainder of the shark may also be utilized, for production of leather, liver oil, and fishmeal. International trade in the porbeagle appears to be significant, but remains unquantified as shark products tend not to be reported to the species level, and many consist of a mix of various species. This shark is caught most readily on longlines, but is also susceptible to gillnets, driftnets, trawls, and handlines. It is valuable enough to be generally retained when caught as bycatch; if storage space cannot be spared it may be finned and the carcass discarded.|$|R
