6000|$|True mimicry is {{very rare}} in plants, though {{adaptation}} to like conditions often produces in foliage and habit a similarity that is deceiving. Euphorbias growing in deserts often closely resemble cacti. Seaside plants and high alpine plants of different orders are often much alike; and innumerable resemblances of this kind are recorded {{in the names of}} plants, as Veronica epacridea (the veronica like an epacris), Limnanthemum nymphaeoides (the limnanthemum like a nymphaea), the resembling species in each case belonging to totally distinct families. But in these cases, and in most others that have been observed, the essential features of true mimicry are absent, inasmuch as the one plant cannot be supposed to derive any benefit from its close resemblance to the other, and this is still more certain {{from the fact that the}} two species usually inhabit different localities. A few cases exist, however, in which there does seem to be the necessary accordance and utility. Mr. Mansel Weale mentions a labiate plant (Ajuga ophrydis), the only species of the genus Ajuga in South Africa, which is strikingly like an orchid of the same country; while a balsam (Impatiens capensis), also a solitary species of the genus in that country, is equally like an orchid, growing in the same locality and visited by the same insects. As both these genera of plants are specialised for insect fertilisation, and both of the plants in question are isolated species of their respective genera, we may suppose that, when they first reached South Africa they were neglected by the insects of the country; but, being both remotely like orchids in form of flower, those varieties that approached nearest to the familiar species of the country were visited by insects and cross-fertilised, and thus a closer resemblance would at length be brought about. Another case of close general resemblance, is that of our common <b>white</b> <b>dead-nettle</b> (Lamium album) to the stinging-nettle (Urtica dioica); and Sir John Lubbock thinks that this is a case of true mimicry, the dead-nettle being benefited by being mistaken by grazing animals for the stinging-nettle.[138] ...|$|E

Economy {{of time is}} very {{important}} both to the insects and the flowers, because the fine working days are comparatively few, and if no time is wasted the bees will get more honey, {{and in doing so}} will fertilise more flowers. Now, it has been ascertained by several observers that many insects, bees especially, keep to one kind of flower at a time, visiting hundreds of blossoms in succession, and passing over other species that may be mixed with them. They thus acquire quickness in going at once to the nectar, and the change of colour in the flower, or incipient withering when fertilised, enables them to avoid those flowers that have already had their honey exhausted. It is probably to assist the insects in keeping to one flower at a time, which is of vital importance to the perpetuation of the species, that the flowers which bloom intermingled at the same season are usually very distinct both in form and colour. In the sandy districts of Surrey, in the early spring, the copses are gay with three flowers--the primrose, the wood-anemone, and the lesser celandine, forming a beautiful contrast, {{while at the same time}} the purple and the <b>white</b> <b>dead-nettles</b> abound on hedge banks. A little later, in the same copses, we have the blue wild hyacinth (Scilla nutans), the red campion (Lychnis dioica), the pure white great starwort (Stellaria Holosteum), and the yellow dead-nettle (Lamium Galeobdolon), all distinct and well-contrasted flowers. In damp meadows in summer we have the ragged robin (Lychnis Floscuculi), the spotted orchis (O. maculata), and the yellow rattle (Rhinanthus Crista-galli); while in drier meadows we have cowslips, ox-eye daisies, and buttercups, all very distinct both in form and colour. So in cornfields we have the scarlet poppies, the purple corn-cockle, the yellow corn-marygold, and the blue cornflower; while on our moors the purple heath and the dwarf gorse make a gorgeous contrast. Thus the difference of colour which enables the insect to visit with rapidity and unerring aim a number of flowers of the same kind in succession, serves to adorn our meadows, banks, woods, and heaths with a charming variety of floral colour and form at each season of the year.[149] ...|$|R
5000|$|Lillering Forest and {{surroundings}} {{has been}} known as a botanically interesting locality for many years with the earliest description dating back to 1877 (Zahrtmann 1877). Some 400 vascular plants have been registered, {{about a third of}} Danish plants. A number of plants primarily exist in south-eastern Denmark, and further south, with the northern boundary being at or around Aarhus and some of these are well represented in Lillering Forest. The most important might be hornbeam which has a significant presence. Others are plants such as <b>dead-nettles,</b> <b>white</b> butterbur, bitter-cress, wall barley, yellow and blue anemone and the endangered multicolored viola. In addition a total of nine species of orchids have been registered although in later years only six has been noted - these are the broad-leaved helleborine, green-flowered helleborine, early-purple orchid, western marsh orchid, early marsh-orchid, eggleaf twayblade and the greater butterfly-orchid. The border zone between Tåstrup Bog and Lillering Forest contains woodland geranium and mountain melick. The area contains several rare species of geometer moths associated with buckthorns that grow at the woodland edge or in Tåstrup Bog. The nearby meadows is home to a rare, small owl that lives on species of mouse-ear chickweed. The meadows in the forest has a number of moths such as the six-spot burnet which are endangered in Denmark. Some 6 species are registered of which 3 in Jutland are found only here and 4 are associated with hackberry at the woodland edge. The stream Bøgebakke Bæk has a large population of the uncommon mayfly siphlonurus aestivalis. == Natura 2000 == The Natura 2000 protected area includes Tåstrup Lake and adjoining wetlands (c. 20 ha.), Tåstrup Bog (c. 25 ha.), Lillering Forest (ca. 50 ha.) and Stjær Forest consisting of the forests Søskov and Stjær Stenskov (c. 20 ha). The four areas are not connected since former agricultural land separates Lillering Forest and Tåstrup Bog to the north and Tåstrup Lake and Stjær Forest to the south.|$|R
