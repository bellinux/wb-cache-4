However, by way of {{putting an end to}} it, Jack took the chief (who had recovered from the effects of his wound) by the hand and shook it warmly. No sooner did the blacks see that this was meant to express good-will than they shook hands with us all round. After this ceremony was gone through Jack went up to the girl, who had never once moved from the rock where she had been left, but had continued an eager spectator of all that had passed. He made signs to her to follow him, and then, taking the chief by the hand, was about to conduct him to the bower when his eye fell on the poor infant which had been thrown into the sea and was still lying on the shore. Dropping the chief's hand he hastened towards it, and, to his great joy, found it to be still alive. <b>We</b> <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> the mother was beginning to recover slowly.|$|E

60|$|We {{found that}} the Method of Agreement has the defect of not proving causation, and can, therefore, only be {{employed}} for the ascertainment of empirical laws. But <b>we</b> <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> besides this deficiency, it labors under a characteristic imperfection, tending to render uncertain even such conclusions {{as it is in}} itself adapted to prove. This imperfection arises from Plurality of Causes. Although two or more cases in which the phenomenon a has been met with may have no common antecedent except A, this does not prove that there is any connection between a and A, since a may have many causes, and may have been produced, in these different instances, not by any thing which the instances had in common, but by some of those elements in them which were different. We nevertheless observed, that in proportion to the multiplication of instances pointing to A as the antecedent, the characteristic uncertainty of the method diminishes, and the existence of a law of connection between A and a more nearly approaches to certainty. It is now to be determined after what amount of experience this certainty may be deemed to be practically attained, and the connection between A and a may be received as an empirical law.|$|E

5000|$|Spatially {{resolved}} Star formation History (SFH): {{the spectra}} of galaxies encode their history of star formation: how many stars, of what mass and metal content, formed {{at which time}} along {{the evolution of the}} galaxy. Stars of different mass evolve at very different rates: while stars of 1 solar mass live for ten billion years (10 Gyr), those of 10 times the solar mass live only 32 million years (32 Myr). These wildly different rates of evolution are encoded in the spectra of galaxies, so we can use our knowledge of stellar evolution to unfold how galaxies formed their stars along time in a sort of galactic archeology. For this purpose we use several numerical codes, such as STARLIGHT; and because with CALIFA we can make these studies in 3D -for each of the two spatial coordinates we have the time evolution-, we have developed the PyCASSO analysis pipeline (Cid Fernandes et al., 2013, 2014). We have found that: stellar mass assembly in typical massive galaxies happens from inside-out (Pérez et al., 2013). <b>We</b> <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> the SFH of bulges and early-type galaxies are fundamentally related to the total stellar mass, while for disk galaxies it is more related to the local stellar mass density, and how these manifest in the mass-metallicity relation for stars and for the gas (González Delgado et al., 2014a, 2014b).|$|E
