50|$|As {{demonstrated}} in the example, when {{the difference between the}} groups is zero, the observations are discarded. This is of particular concern if the samples are taken from a discrete distribution. In these scenarios the modification to the <b>Wilcoxon</b> <b>test</b> by Pratt 1959, provides an alternative which incorporates the zero differences. This modification is more robust for data on an ordinal scale.|$|E
50|$|The {{sign test}} {{requires}} {{only that the}} observations in a pair be ordered, for example x > y. In some cases, the observations for all subjects can be assigned a rank value (1, 2, 3, …). If the observations can be ranked, and each observation in a pair is a random sample from a symmetric distribution, then the Wilcoxon signed-rank test is appropriate. The <b>Wilcoxon</b> <b>test</b> will generally have greater power to detect differences than the sign test. The asymptotic relative efficiency of the sign test to the Wilcoxon signed rank test, under these circumstances, is 0.67.|$|E

40|$|<b>Wilcoxon</b> signed-rank <b>test</b> {{is one of}} nonparametric tests {{which is}} used to test whether median equals some value in one sample case. The test is based on signed-rank of {{observations}} that are drawn from a symmetric continuous distribution population with unknown median. When the assumption about symmetric distribution fails, it can affect the power of test. Our interest in this thesis is to study robustness of the <b>Wilcoxon</b> signed-rank <b>test</b> against the assumption of symmetry. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate changes in the power of <b>Wilcoxon</b> signed-rank <b>test</b> when data sets come from symmetric and more asymmetric distributions through simulations. Simulations using Mixtures of Normal distributions find that when the distribution changes from symmetry to asymmetry, the power of <b>Wilcoxon</b> signed-rank <b>test</b> increases. That is, the <b>Wilcoxon</b> signed-rank <b>test</b> is not good and applicable under the asymmetry distribution. Therefore, the second objective is to study the inverse transformation method which is a technique in statistics to make observations from an arbitrary distribution to be a symmetric distribution. Moreover, the effect of the inverse transformation method to the <b>Wilcoxon</b> signed-rank <b>test</b> is also studied to answer whether or not the <b>Wilcoxon</b> signed-rank <b>test</b> is still good and applicable after we apply the inverse transformation method to the test. ...|$|R
