He [...] "endeavored to restore what he called 'an old Austrian' tradition by reviving the Bosnian regiments of the former Austro-Hungarian Army {{in the form of a}} Bosnian Muslim SS Division". Once raised, the division was to engage and destroy Josip Broz Tito's Partisan forces operating in north-eastern Bosnia, thus restoring local [...] "order". Himmler's primary concern in the region was not the security of the local Muslim population, but the welfare of ethnic German settlers to the north in Syrmia. [...] "Srem (Syrmia) is the breadbasket of Croatia, and hopefully it and our beloved German settlements will be secured. I hope that the area south of Srem will be liberated by... the Bosnian division... so that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> restore partial order in this ridiculous (Croatian) state." ...|$|E

Sun Chen executed Zhu Yi and returned to Jiangdong. He is actually putting on a front when he sent troops to help us. His decision to turn back already shows that he is adopting a wait-and-see attitude.

30|$|All {{regression}} estimates with a {{significance level}} (p value) {{of less than}} 0.05 implies a confidential level that is higher than 95  %. In other words, if a regression estimate has a significance level of 0.05 or lower <b>we</b> <b>can</b> be <b>at</b> <b>least</b> 95  % sure that the independent variable is either positively or negatively associated with the dependent variable. If the significance level is lower than 0.01 <b>we</b> <b>can</b> be <b>at</b> <b>least</b> 99  % sure. Taken together, the lower the significance level (p value) the higher the confidence interval. A low significance level is accordingly indicative of a robust regression estimate (for further readings and assumptions about confidential intervals in statistics and econometrics, see for instance Wooldridge 2006).|$|R
