5000|$|Gap <b>wedges</b> are loosely defined, but {{typically}} have the loft between {{that of a}} pitching <b>wedge</b> and sand <b>wedge,</b> between 50 and 54 degrees. At the extremes there is redundancy with either the pitching <b>wedge</b> (typically 48°) or the sand <b>wedge</b> (typically 56°), however some players will [...] "fine-tune" [...] the lofts of these other <b>wedges</b> to their play style, leading to alternate loft choices for a gap <b>wedge.</b> Most players look for a separation of 4 degrees between clubs, and so with the standard pitching and sand <b>wedge</b> lofts, the complementary gap <b>wedge</b> would be 52°.|$|R
5|$|In 1988, the Portland Water Bureau {{expressed}} their {{surprise at the}} cost of running the fountain, which at the time was consuming $34,000 in water and $13,000 in electricity each year. Also in 1988, a 26-year-old Vancouver man was drowned when he attempted to swim through a small water pipe and got <b>wedged</b> under a concrete slab. He was taken to the Oregon Health & Science University and was listed in critical condition. According to Portland police, he had been drinking alcohol.|$|E
5|$|Both entrances {{will feature}} the glass canopy design, {{the first of}} their kind in the subway system. They are {{intended}} to stand out aesthetically. The entrances are interweaved with the Hudson Yards developments, with the main entrance <b>wedged</b> between 50 Hudson Yards {{to the east and}} 55 Hudson Yards to the west. The rest of the Hudson Yards development is located very close to the south of the station. Both entrances are based on a design by architect Toshiko Mori, which itself is based on the design of smaller station entrances in the Paris Métro.|$|E
5|$|Insects {{and other}} {{invertebrates}} {{are a major}} portion of the nuthatch diet, especially during the breeding season, when they rely almost exclusively on live prey, but most species also eat seeds during the winter, when invertebrates are less readily available. Larger food items, such as big insects, snails, acorns or seeds may be <b>wedged</b> into cracks and pounded with the bird's strong bill. Unusually for a bird, the brown-headed nuthatch uses a piece of tree bark as a lever to pry up other bark flakes to look for food; the bark tool may then be carried from tree to tree or used to cover a seed cache.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the sport}} of golf, a gap <b>wedge,</b> also known as an all <b>wedge,</b> is a <b>wedge</b> used to hit a shot with higher and shorter {{trajectory}} than a pitching <b>wedge</b> and lower and longer trajectory than a sand <b>wedge.</b> The name derives from the club's design to fill the [...] "gap" [...] between sand and pitching <b>wedges.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The gap <b>wedge</b> {{was created}} {{to fill the gap}} that {{appeared}} between the pitching <b>wedge</b> and the sand <b>wedge,</b> as the numbered irons including the pitching <b>wedge</b> were de-lofted to compensate for cavity-backed irons' higher launch angle. The gap <b>wedge</b> has a loft similar to that of an older pitching <b>wedge,</b> around 52°, and can also be found labelled as an [...] "approach", [...] "dual", [...] "utility", or [...] "attack" [...] <b>wedge.</b> Originally designed with relatively low bounce for use from the fairway or other thinner lies, gap <b>wedges,</b> like many <b>wedges,</b> are now offered with different amounts of bounce to accommodate differing player techniques and preferences.|$|R
50|$|During {{each round}} the wheel {{displays}} six <b>wedges</b> that can each be red, green, or gold; initially {{they are all}} red or green. A correct answer changes one red <b>wedge</b> to green, or {{if there are no}} red <b>wedges,</b> changes one green <b>wedge</b> to gold. A wrong answer changes a green <b>wedge</b> to red, or if all the <b>wedges</b> were already red, eliminates the player.|$|R
5|$|The kvitelach {{placed in}} the Western Wall differ from the kvitelach given in Hasidic courts, as they contain prayers, {{requests}} or messages written directly to God. These prayer notes are folded and <b>wedged</b> into the cracks and crevices of the Wall. The rationale for this practice has been traced to the Midrashic teaching that the Divine Presence has never moved from the Western Wall, and the Kabbalistic teaching that all prayers ascend to Heaven through the Temple Mount, which the Western Wall abuts. More than a million prayer notes are {{placed in the}} Western Wall each year.|$|E
5|$|Though Wyatt {{received}} {{bullet holes}} in both sides of his long coat and another in his boot heel, he never received even a scratch from any bullet. After emptying his shotgun, Wyatt fired his pistol, mortally wounding Johnny Barnes {{in the chest and}} wounding Milt Hicks in the arm. Vermillion tried to retrieve his rifle <b>wedged</b> in the scabbard under his fallen horse, exposing himself to the Cowboys' gunfire. Doc Holliday helped him get to cover. Wyatt had trouble remounting his horse because his cartridge belt had slipped down his legs. He was finally able to get on his horse, and {{with the rest of the}} posse retreated.|$|E
5|$|Trautmann {{attended}} the evening's post-match banquet (where Alma Cogan sang to the players) despite {{being unable to}} move his head, {{and went to bed}} expecting his injury to heal with rest. As the pain did not recede, the following day he went to St George's Hospital, where he was told he merely had a crick in his neck which would go away. Three days later, he got a second opinion from a doctor at Manchester Royal Infirmary. An X-ray revealed he had dislocated five vertebrae in his neck, the second of which was cracked in two. The third vertebra had <b>wedged</b> against the second, preventing further damage which could have cost Trautmann his life.|$|E
50|$|Thomas <b>Wedge</b> (1760-1854) was an English agriculturalist. He {{was the son}} of Francis <b>Wedge</b> (1714-1784) of Fernhill House, near Forton, Staffordshire, {{a prosperous}} farmer, and brother of John <b>Wedge</b> and Charles <b>Wedge</b> of Shudy Camps.

40|$|Background: <b>Wedge</b> {{filters are}} {{commonly}} used in radiation oncology for eliminating hot spots and creating a uniform dose distribution in optimizing isodose curves in the target volume for clinical aspects. These are some limited standard physical <b>wedges</b> (15 °, 30 °, 45 °, 60 °),or creating an arbitrary <b>wedge</b> angle, like motorized <b>wedge</b> or dynamic <b>wedge,</b> [...] . The new formulation is presented by the combination of <b>wedge</b> fields for determining an arbitrary effective <b>wedge</b> angles. The isodose curves also are derived for these <b>wedges.</b> Materials and Methods: we performed the dosimetry of Varian Clinac 2100 C/D with Scanditronix Wellhofer water blue phantom, CU 500 E, OmniPro-Accept software and 0. 13 cc ionization chamber for 6 Mv photon beam in depth of 10 cm (reference depth) for universal physical <b>wedges</b> (15 °, 30 °, 45 °, and 60 °) and reference field 10. 10 cm 2. By combining the isodose curve standard <b>wedge</b> fields with compatible weighting dose for each field, the effective isodose curve is calculated for any <b>wedge</b> angle. Results: The relation between a given effective <b>wedge</b> angle and the weighting of each combining <b>wedge</b> fields was derived. A good agreement {{was found between the}} measured and calculated <b>wedge</b> angles and the maximum deviation did not exceed 3 °. The difference between the measured and calculated data decreased when the combined <b>wedge</b> angles were closer. The results are in agreement with the motorized single <b>wedge</b> appliance in the literature. Conclusions: This technique showed that the effective <b>wedge</b> angle that is obtained from this method is adequate for clinical applications and the motorized <b>wedge</b> formalism is a special case of this consideration...|$|R

5|$|Humans {{entered the}} Americas through Beringia, and {{evidence}} documents {{their interactions with}} Columbian mammoths. Tools made from Columbian mammoth remains have been discovered in several North American sites. At Tocuila, Mexico, mammoth bones were quarried 13,000 years ago to produce lithic flakes and cores. At the Lange-Ferguson Site in South Dakota, the remains of two mammoths were found with two 12,800-year-old cleaver choppers made from a mammoth shoulder blade; the choppers {{had been used to}} butcher the mammoths. At the same site, a flake knife made from a long mammoth bone was also found <b>wedged</b> against mammoth vertebrae. At Murray Springs, archaeologists discovered a 13,100-year-old object made from a mammoth femur; the object is thought to be a shaft wrench, a tool for straightening wood and bone to make spear-shafts (the Inuit use similar tools).|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1890s, Queen's Park {{requested}} more land {{for development of}} the second Hampden Park. This was refused by the landlords, {{which led to the}} club seeking a new site. Henry Erskine Gordon agreed to sell 12 acres of land off Somerville Drive to Queen's Park in November 1899. James Miller designed twin grandstands along {{the south side of the}} ground with a pavilion <b>wedged</b> in between. The natural slopes were shaped to form banks of terracing, designed by Archibald Leitch. Construction of the new ground took over three years to complete; during construction, a disaster occurred at Ibrox in which part of the wooden terraces collapsed. In response, the terraces at Hampden were firmly set in the earthwork and innovative techniques were used to control spectators.|$|E
50|$|Consider a {{block that}} is to be lifted by a <b>wedge.</b> As the <b>wedge</b> slides under the block, the block slides up the sloped side of a <b>wedge.</b> This lifts the weight FB of the block. The {{horizontal}} force FA needed to lift the block is obtained by considering the velocity of the <b>wedge</b> vA and the velocity of the block vB. If we assume the <b>wedge</b> does not dissipate or store energy, then the power into the <b>wedge</b> equals the power out, soorThe velocity of the block is related to the velocity of the <b>wedge</b> by the slope of the side of the <b>wedge.</b> If the angle of the <b>wedge</b> is α thenwhich means that the mechanical advantageThus, the smaller the angle α the greater the ratio of the lifting force to the applied force on the <b>wedge.</b> This is the mechanical advantage of the <b>wedge.</b> This formula for mechanical advantage applies to cutting edges and splitting operations as well as to lifting.|$|R
40|$|The slide <b>wedge</b> device has {{at least}} one pair if opposingly movable slide <b>wedge</b> {{components}} (14), which by means of tension devices (16) are tensioned radially inwards, locating on the base plate (20) and the <b>wedge</b> pressure plate (12). The tension on the slide <b>wedge</b> components can be invalidated with little delay, and is adjustable. The <b>wedge</b> pressure plate may have one or more <b>wedge</b> surfaces with a <b>wedge</b> angle corresponding to that of the slide <b>wedge</b> components. The <b>wedge</b> pressure plate can be axially slidably movably accommodated in a housing (18) with an axial end stop for it.

5|$|The Eurasian {{nuthatch}} eats mainly insects, particularly caterpillar and beetles. In autumn and winter, {{the diet}} is supplemented with nuts and seeds, hazel nuts and beech mast being preferred. The young are fed {{mainly on the}} insects favoured by their parents, with some seeds. Food items are found mainly on tree trunks and large branches, but smaller branches may also be investigated, and food may be taken from the ground, especially outside the breeding season. Nuthatches can forage when descending trees head first, as well as when climbing. Some prey is caught in flight, and a nuthatch will remove bark or rotten wood to reach insects, although it cannot chisel into healthy wood like a woodpecker. A pair may temporarily join a mixed-species foraging flock as it passes near their territory. The Eurasian nuthatch readily visits bird tables and bird feeders in winter, eating human-made food items such as fat, cheese, butter and bread. It has even been recorded as taking slaughterhouse offal. Sizeable hard food items like nuts or large insects are <b>wedged</b> into crevices in tree bark and smashed with the strong bill.|$|E
5|$|The fantail and {{associated}} gearing was fitted to the mill. At {{the end of}} the second work-in, the cap could be turned by means of the hand crank. The fantail itself, with the blades painted red, white and blue was installed shortly afterwards. The clasp arm brake wheel was assembled around the windshaft. It was found that the wallower was eccentric on the upright shaft by ½ inch (13mm). When this was corrected the brake wheel was within 1/16 th of an inch (less than 1mm) of true. The clamps for the stocks were sawn from a baulk of pitch pine ready for completion later in the year. Other work included a new frame for one of the ground floor doors, cleaning and painting ironwork and further repointing on the brickwork. The four sails were fitted to the mill with the aid of a mobile crane at {{the end of the}} second work-in. The stock, with one sail attached was carefully inserted through the poll end of the windshaft and when <b>wedged</b> in position and the clamps had been attached the second sail was fitted to the stock. The process was repeated for the second pair of sails. The mill turned by wind again on the last day of the second work-in.|$|E
5|$|The second main feud {{heading into}} the event was between Kane and Shawn Michaels. This feud began the night after Bad Blood, when Michaels lost a Hell in a Cell match to Triple H. Raw {{commentator}} Jim Ross tried making amends between Michaels and Triple H by making them to shake hands. Michaels and Triple H extended their hands to shake, however, Kane came out and attacked Michaels, which resulted in Kane, in storyline, crushing Michaels' throat with a <b>wedged</b> chair. Michaels was then taken out in an ambulance for medical attention. On the June 28, 2004 edition of Raw, Ross interviewed Kane {{and asked him to}} explain his actions towards Michaels; Kane explained that he was robbed of the World Heavyweight Championship at Bad Blood against Chris Benoit, as Michaels got in his way, which angered him. On the August 30 edition of Raw, Kane revealed that Eric Bischoff's wedding gift to him and Lita, who married the week before, was to name any match he wanted for the September pay-per-view, Unforgiven. Lita then informed Kane that Bischoff's present was for both of them, where they were able to pick Kane's opponent for Unforgiven, which resulted in Michaels being picked.|$|E

5|$|Wall {{construction}} {{continued until}} {{the demise of}} the Ming dynasty in 1644. In the decades that led to the fall of the Ming dynasty, the Ming court and the Great Wall itself had to deal with simultaneous internal rebellions and the Manchu invasions. In addition to their conquest of Liaodong, the Manchus had raided across the Great Wall {{for the first time in}} 1629, and again in 1634, 1638, and 1642. Meanwhile, the rebels led by warlord Li Zicheng had been gathering strength. In the early months of 1644, Li Zicheng declared himself the founder of the Shun and marched towards the Ming capital from Shaanxi. His route roughly followed the line of the Great Wall, in order to neutralize its heavily fortified garrisons. The crucial defences of Datong, Xuanfu, and Juyong Pass all surrendered without a fight, and the Chongzhen Emperor hanged himself on 25 April as the Shun army entered Beijing. At this point, the largest remaining Ming fighting force in North China was in Shanhai Pass, where the Great Wall meets the Bohai Sea. Its defender Wu Sangui, <b>wedged</b> between the Shun army within and the Manchus without, decided to surrender to the Manchus and opened the gates for them. The Manchus, having thus entered through the Great Wall, defeated Li Zicheng at the Battle of Shanhai Pass and seized Beijing on June5. They eventually defeated both the rebel-founded Shun dynasty and the remaining Ming resistance, establishing their rule over all of China as the Qing dynasty.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, Jackson {{was working with}} Harvey Weinstein and Miramax Films to {{purchase}} the film rights of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, while 20th Century Fox was trying to hire him for the 2001 remake of Planet of the Apes. Jackson turned down Planet of the Apes and because Weinstein was taking longer than expected to buy The Lord of the Rings rights, Jackson decided {{to move forward on}} King Kong. Weinstein was furious, and, as a result, Jackson proposed a deal between Universal and Miramax that the two studios would equally finance King Kong with Jackson's production company Wingnut Films. Universal would receive distribution rights in the United States, while Miramax would cover foreign territories. Jackson was also warranted the right of final cut privilege, a percentage of the gross profits, as well as artistic control; Universal allowed all filming and visual effects to be handled entirely in New Zealand. The deal was settled in April 1996, and Jackson, along with wife Fran Walsh, began working on the King Kong script. In the original draft, Ann was the daughter of famed English archaeologist Lord Linwood Darrow exploring ancient ruins in Sumatra. They would come into conflict with Denham during his filming, and they would uncover a hidden Kong statue and the map of Skull Island. This would indicate that the island natives were the last remnants of a cult religion that had once thrived on Asia's mainland. Instead of a playwright, Jack was the first mate and an ex-World War I fighter pilot still struggling with the loss of his best friend, who had been killed in battle during a World War I prologue. The camera-man Herb is the only supporting character in the original draft who made it to the final version. The fight between Kong and the three V. rex also changed from the original draft. In the draft, Ann is actually caught in the V. rex jaws, where she becomes <b>wedged,</b> and slashed by the teeth; after the fight, Kong gets her out but she is suffering from a fever, from which she then recovers.|$|E
