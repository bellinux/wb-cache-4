500|$|For New Amerykah Part One, Badu collaborated principally with Questlove, Madlib, 9th Wonder, Karriem Riggins, James Poyser, audio {{engineer}} Mike [...] "Chav" [...] Chavarria, and {{the members}} of musical group Sa-Ra, who made production and lyrical contributions to most of the tracks. She later explained choosing which producers to work with, saying [...] "All of these people have a reputation for being visionaries and knowing them well, I felt 'Okay, now it's time to put together a project that not only takes us to another place, another dimension, but highlights these sights.' And that's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> mind for this project".|$|E
500|$|In the {{conclusion}} of [...] "Beside the Dying Fire," [...] a large prison {{is seen in the}} background hovering over the survivors' temporary settlement. Bear McCreary composed a score for the sequence, which he thought would lay the groundworks for a future theme for the location. [...] "There’s something really powerful there that could become, sort of like a heartbeat-like theme for this location, which is kind of similar to <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> mind when I read the comics years ago when I first got there," [...] he asserted. [...] "I had been thinking about it, there’s so many great prison shows and movies and there are certain sounds you kind of associate with it, and I don’t want to do that. But, we’ll see. I mean it really depends on where they take the show. It’s a little early to think about it, but I’m definitely thinking about it anyway." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2011, Asada {{launched}} her own kimono brand named MaoMao. In January 2012, Asada cancelled {{the release}} of a book on her skating career; she stated, [...] "The way the book was advertised was different from <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> mind." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{he has got}} to {{keep his}} {{distance}} this term," [...] said Major Jack, with a firm look on his face. [...] "I am not going to stand for <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> the past." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> them," [...] {{answered}} the bully, pulling a trunk key from one pocket and some small {{change from the}} other. [...] "Perhaps you'll say I was fighting with these in my hands." ...|$|R
50|$|As a manager, I want {{to browse}} my {{existing}} quizzes so <b>I</b> can recall <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> place {{and figure out}} if I can just reuse or update an existing quiz for the position I need now.|$|R
2500|$|Chomsky's {{complicated}} {{attitude to}} MIT's military role was expressed in two letters {{published in the}} New York Review Books in 1967. In the first, he wrote that he had [...] "given {{a good bit of}} thought to ... resigning from MIT, which is, more than any other university associated with the activities of the Department of 'Defense'." [...] He also stated that MIT's [...] "involvement in the [...] war effort is tragic and indefensible." [...] Then, in the second letter written to clarify the first, Chomsky said that [...] "MIT as an institution has no involvement in the war effort. Individuals at MIT, as elsewhere, have direct involvement and that is <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> mind." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Take My Life, Please" [...] {{was written}} by Don Payne and {{directed}} by Steven Dean Moore. It was the first episode of The Simpsons to air in 720p high-definition television, though {{not the first time}} The Simpsons appeared in high-definition, as The Simpsons Movie was rendered in HD. With the new broadcasting system came a new opening sequence. It was the first major permanent change to the show's introduction since the opening added in season 2; previous changes have included variations in the duration of the intro, and special one-shot introductions for the Treehouse of Horror Halloween episodes, as well as a handful of others. This new intro also includes some 3D animation when the camera pans over [...] The Simpsons creator Matt Groening told the New York Post: [...] "The clouds {{at the very beginning of}} the main title were always unsatisfying to me. My original direction to the animators was to make the clouds as realistic as possible, and as we go through the clouds we enter this cartoon universe of The Simpsons. Finally, after a couple of decades, they've gotten closer to <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> my mind. Not perfect, but better." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hanson {{had seen}} Russell Crowe in Romper Stomper {{and found him}} [...] "repulsive and scary, but captivating". The actor had read Ellroy's The Black Dahlia but not L.A. Confidential. When he read the script, Crowe was drawn to Bud White's [...] "self-righteous moral crusade". Crowe fit the visual preconception of Bud. Hanson put the actor on tape doing a few scenes from the script {{and showed it to}} the film's producers, who agreed to cast him as Bud. Guy Pearce auditioned like countless other actors, and Hanson felt that he [...] "was very much <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> mind for Ed Exley." [...] The {{director}} purposely did not watch the actor in The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, afraid that it might influence his decision. As he did with Crowe, Hanson taped Pearce and showed it to the producers, who agreed he should be cast as Ed. Pearce did not like Ed when he first read the screenplay and remarked, [...] "I was pretty quick to judge him and dislike him for being so self-righteous ... But I liked how honest he became about himself. I knew I could grow to respect and understand him." ...|$|E
60|$|I am heartily {{pleased that}} you set so much store by the dedication. You may {{be sure that}} it does not make me the less anxious to take pains, and to work out well <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> my mind.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{not taking}} chances," [...] he replied doggedly. [...] "You must {{remember}} that my face is not known here as yours is, and with <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> my pocket who will dare put aught of hindrance in my way?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They are {{a sturdy}} lot, lad, no two ways about that,--and they {{understand}} {{just how to}} keep themselves in the pink of condition." [...] Luke rubbed his chin reflectively. [...] "Do ye know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> mind to do?" ...|$|R
2500|$|GameZone's Michael Lafferty {{scored the}} Xbox version 8 out of 10, writing [...] "the {{essence of the}} fantastic {{adventure}} is there, and while the game does chart an extremely linear path through the lands of Middle-earth, there are enough challenges along the route to enable players to joyfully experience the urgency and terror of the journey." [...] IGN's Kaiser Hwang scored it 6.7 out of 10. He was critical of the combat, the enemy AI, and how the plot was handled. He concluded [...] "the book itself is very non-linear in format and can {{be very hard to}} translate into an effective game without leaving some of the detail out. But to reduce to the story to almost childish levels is not <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> mind. Didn't we learn that from 1978's Lord of the Rings animated movie?" [...] GameSpy's Steve Steinberg scored it 3 out of 5, arguing [...] "the actual gameplay takes a backseat. The die-hard Tolkien will {{get a kick out of}} slugging and spell-casting their way through the first book of the Rings trilogy, but the casual gamer will only be disappointed by an otherwise generic action/adventure title. GameSpot's Brad Shoemaker scored it 5.7 out of 10, writing [...] "even the blessing of Tolkien Enterprises isn't enough to save the game from its bland design and tedious gameplay." [...] He called it [...] "an average game at its best and a frustrating and boring one at its worst." [...] Eurogamer's Kristan Reed scored it 4 out of 10, comparing it unfavorably with EA's Two Towers; [...] "EA shames Vivendi's effort for presentation and general slickness." [...] He was heavily critical of the inability to invert the camera controls, which he referred to as an [...] "industry standard option" [...] in third-person games. He concluded [...] "this has [...] "licensed toss" [...] written all over it. The goal was [...] "to create the most authentic Lord of the Rings game experience possible." [...] Quite honestly, Melbourne House's [...] had more going for it." ...|$|E
60|$|How much of {{what follows}} I said to de Tessin at the time I do not clearly remember, but this is <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> mind.|$|E
6000|$|... "I want {{no time to}} think. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> my mind, when I left Miss Letitia, is {{something}} which I refuse to explain, miss, to you, or to anybody." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We can {{do better}} with the hound!" [...] he cried. [...] "Sink me {{if it is not}} a rare plan. Throw him into the sail-room with the irons on, and do you come here, quartermaster, that I may tell you <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> my mind." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> mind is {{classroom}} {{where students}} could sit {{around a table}} with a teacher who would talk with them and instruct them by a sort of tutorial or conference method, where student would feel encouraged to speak up. This would be a real revolution in methods.|$|R
6000|$|... "When <b>I</b> ask <b>what</b> <b>I</b> am to {{call myself}} to-day, Herbert," [...] I went on, [...] "I suggest <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> my thoughts. You say I am lucky. <b>I</b> know <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{done nothing to}} raise myself in life, and that Fortune alone has raised me; that is being very lucky. And yet, when I think of Estella--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's nothing, mother," [...] {{he called}} to her, and as she dropped on her knees before him he sank limply against her. [...] "It was like <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> Carlsbad; that's all. Don't worry about me, please!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah, the banquet!' said Lorenzo, {{clasping}} his hands. 'What an inexhaustible matter! I {{could go}} on talking about it all day and all night for a year, and then find I had left unsaid half <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> my mind.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I know nothing. That is <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> mind. I know nothing. And these others--the Councillors, Ostrog. They are wiser, cooler, {{they know}} so much, every detail. And, indeed, {{what are these}} miseries of which you speak? What am I to know? Do you mean--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Now look here!' {{repeated}} Tom. 'Be {{sure you}} don't make any mistake then, and don't forget. I shall tell my sister {{as we go}} home, <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> view, and she'll approve, I know. Now look here! You're all right, are you? You understand all about it? Very well then. Come along, Loo!' ...|$|R
5000|$|It was {{confirmed}} in January 2011 that Guo {{has decided to}} retire, and she will not compete in the 2012 Summer Olympics. She was quoted as saying, [...] "I think <b>I</b> <b>have</b> fulfilled my task, so the London Games is not <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> mind now. The chances {{should be left to}} other talents in the team." ...|$|R
30|$|The {{collective}} view {{of families}} brings {{us closer to}} <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> mind with care dialogues. It both recognizes how a family’s social position and group membership might affect its interaction with an early education and care institution and it seeks to expand families’ agentic opportunities. From this empirical point I begin my theoretical elaboration of care dialogues.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't {{you think}} we ought to search 'em thoroughly?" [...] he asked. [...] "They may have {{something}} belonging to me--some map of the lost mine, or something like that? I don't exactly remember <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> that suit-case Merwell got from the porter on the train." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{now stood}} behind her, holding a half-crown in my hand, {{and asked her}} if she could tell me <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> my hand, to which she replied, [...] "It is a shilling." [...] It seemed as though she could see what was {{happening}} miles away easier than she could {{see what was going on}} in the room.|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{went back}} to her chair, and read the letter. You have {{permitted}} me to keep the comforting words of the good Father, among my other treasures. I copy his letter for you in this place--so that you may read it again, and see <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> my mind, and understand how it affected poor Miss Minerva.|$|E
40|$|First, I want to {{tell you}} <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> mind in talking about {{management}} and science. A broad view of management is that it involves procedures to forecast, plan, analyse, decide, motivate, communicate, and implement. On the scientific side, my definition is limited: science is the use of objective and replicable procedures to compare different approaches...|$|R
6000|$|... "But it is <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> view, Mr. Gotobed;--so if {{you please}} we'll take the pre-eminence of your country for granted." [...] Then she turned to Mr. Mainwaring on the other side. Upon this the Senator {{addressed}} himself {{for a while to}} the table at large and had soon forgotten altogether the expression of the lady's wishes.|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{there is}} more to be said," [...] he continued, after a pause painful to both. [...] "I know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> me. No one knows that so well as I. I know I shall succeed. I will not be kept down. I am afire with <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> to say <b>in</b> verse, and fiction, and essay. I do not ask you to <b>have</b> faith <b>in</b> that, though. I do not ask you to <b>have</b> faith <b>in</b> me, nor in my writing. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> do ask of you is to love me and <b>have</b> faith <b>in</b> love." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, but I {{have planned}} to do a great deal," [...] {{answered}} Barwell Dawson. [...] "As I stated before, I don't want to say too much about it yet, for if I do, I'll {{have all sorts of}} curiosity seekers at my heels. If some folks knew <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> mind to do, they'd be crazy to be taken along." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I reckon," [...] said he, [...] "that your {{diagnosis}} about {{covers the}} case {{according to the}} rules laid down in the copy-books and historical readers. But <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> my mind was the case of Willie Robbins, a person I used to know. I'll tell you about him before I close up the store, if you don't mind listening.|$|E
6000|$|Westover {{could not}} deny the force of this. [...] "You'd be anxious if I didn't tell you <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> mind, I dare say, more than if I did." [...] He told him of Jeff's {{behavior}} with Alan Lynde, and of his talk with him about it. [...] "And I think he was honest. It was something that happened, that wasn't meant." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Never mind <b>what</b> <b>I</b> propose, to-night. Before I {{can tell}} you <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> my mind, <b>I</b> must know whether Mrs. Rook is in England or Scotland. Bring me that {{information}} to-morrow, and <b>I</b> shall <b>have</b> {{something to say to}} you. Hark! The wind is rising, the rain is falling. There is a chance of sleep for me--I shall soon hear the sea. Good-night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of all {{dreams and}} illusions!... Think <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> lost <b>in</b> this accursed marriage. And now ... You don't understand--you won't understand." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You do {{not know}} <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> my heart," [...] pleaded the other--"what pain, what distraction--nor whence it arises. I can {{understand}} that you should exult in Robert's greatness and goodness; so do I, in one sense, but in another I feel so miserable. I am too far removed from him. I used to be nearer. Let me alone, Shirley. Do let me cry a few minutes; it relieves me." ...|$|R
