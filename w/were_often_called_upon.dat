Once Anselm was out of office, however, the popes began to side more often with York, and generally strive to avoid making any final judgement.|$|E

50|$|The Canadian Pacific Railway's {{line through}} Rogers Pass {{completed}} its transcontinental railroad through to Canada's west coast, {{and at the}} time was the only such link.

A costly system of 31 'snow sheds' was constructed to protect the most vulnerable sections of line, covering 6.5 km in all. However, most of the route through the pass was still unprotected, meaning that men and equipment <b>were</b> <b>often</b> <b>called</b> <b>upon</b> to clear the track.|$|E
