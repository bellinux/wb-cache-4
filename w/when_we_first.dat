5|$|Alright, {{the main}} titles. Why the change? As you'll see here, the {{previous}} titles {{were such a}} high school aesthetic. It would have felt silly {{for me to go}} back to college with the same sort of look—the notebook paper. So it felt like we needed to change for college anyway. And in season one <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>first</b> did the titles, the network was very clear on wanting to sell it as a high school show rather than a noir show. But once we went to college and had a chance to redo the titles I wanted it to feel noir. For the new theme song, Thomas asked The Dandy Warhols to commission a remix of their original track, which Thomas reported enjoying upon first listening.|$|E

It is used <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>first</b> see her, again when she stands before Edoras. A slow variation of it is played before Theodred's Dirge, and it eventually plays in a very triumphant setting when she rides off to battle.|$|E

500|$|... "Rehab" [...] is a mid-tempo R ballad with {{a subtle}} backbeat. According to the digital sheet music {{published}} by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, {{it is written}} in the key of G minor and set in common time, with a moderately slow groove. The vocal range spans nearly an octave {{and a half from}} F3 to B4. [...] "Rehab" [...] opens with a string section, played by Stevie Blacke, and a violin, cello, and tambourine instrumental groove with Hannon Lane's keyboard melody.

Byom said he wanted to give the world as much detail as possible to make the game [...] "convincing" [...] to the player.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of Walter goes through much development {{during the first}} season. Stuart believed that he changes {{the most out of}} the main cast, and his return to St. Claire's reflects this progression. Actor John Noble explained his character's evolution in a November 2008 interview, [...] "We see Walter from a different angle, very vulnerable. He goes back to the asylum again, and we see the very, very fearful man return for a while. Although he does have some wonderful moments earlier in the episode, when he goes back inside he turns into this incredibly fearful, stuttering fellow that we saw <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>first</b> met him.

500|$|The Who {{had planned}} to perform Tommy live since {{starting}} the project. The group spent April 1969 rehearsing a live version of the show at the Hanwell Community Centre in Ealing including a final run down of the entire stage piece on 23 April. The running order was changed, and four songs ("Cousin Kevin", [...] "Underture", [...] "Sensation" [...] and [...] "Welcome") were dropped entirely. Townshend later said the group [...] "did the whole thing {{from start to finish}} and that was <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>first</b> realized we had something cohesive and playable."

In an interview with People, Shelton expressed that {{the best part of}} the duet was [...] "the honest way it came about". He stated: [...] "There's not a third ghost writer, there's not five writers on it. It's just she and I sat down and wrote this song [...] and I couldn't be happier about [...]" [...] He further explained that the song was written about [...] "some serious insecurities that we had <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>first</b> started down this road with each other"; he called the end result [...] "perfect".

500|$|... "What's It Feel Like to Be a Ghost?" [...] is, {{according}} to Lazzara, about a [...] "pre-pre-midlife crisis." [...] Mascherino {{said that the}} song [...] "charges forward," [...] never letting [...] "up and fully rocks the entire time." [...] Rubano called the opening guitar riff [...] "not quite 'Paradise City', but it's a guitar riff where <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>first</b> came up with it, we were like, 'Whoa! Rock! He thought that [...] "Liar (It Takes One to Know One)" [...] sounded like a modern equivalent of the Police. Lazzara called the song [...] "110 miles-per-hour, very hard to play and totally rocking," [...] and Mascherino considered it and [...] "Spin" [...] the group's fastest songs ever. [...] "MakeDamnSure" [...] has a phone message in the bridge; Lazzara and his girlfriend were arguing at the time, and she left him a message. Lazzara showed it to Valentine, wanting to include it in the song. He called [...] "My Blue Heaven" [...] "laid-back." [...] According to Mascherino, [...] "MakeDamnSure" [...] received the greatest group effort of the album's songs.|$|E
500|$|... "Immortality" [...] was {{watched by}} about 3.7 million viewers, drawing a 1.4/4 ratings share on its initial broadcast, down 12.5 {{percent from the}} {{previous}} episode's viewership. During the first half hour, the episode placed second in its timeslot, but dropped to fourth for its second half. Its lead-in, Kitchen Nightmares, also dropped 12 percent, as did all other network shows for that night. Time shifting viewing added 57 percent to the episode's ratings for three days out, and 64 percent for a week following the first airing. This was the greatest DVR gain yet for the series in that timeslot. Despite this, Joshua Jackson urged fans to watch the series live {{in an interview with}} Entertainment Weekly a week after [...] "Immortality" [...] aired. He explained [...] "I'm a positive person in general, but we really need our Fringe fans to tune in and watch us on Fridays. We did good <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>first</b> moved, but last week we did not have a good week, ratings wise. It is going to take the people that like the show to watch the show and start the campaign and show their support if they want to see us stick around for another season." ...|$|E

500|$|For the game's cover, Acclaim hired Italian male model Fabio Lanzoni to pose as Kuros; Fabio was {{presented}} {{on the cover}} bare-chested and without armor. When Zippo Games saw {{the image of the}} cover a week prior to its release, they were perplexed. According to Ste Pickford, [...] "Our jaws hit the floor <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>first</b> saw this image (which was, being merely the developers, probably about a week before the game's release). Why on earth did they choose a photograph of a bare-chested barbarian to promote a game starring a knight in shining armour?". Pickford added that [...] "We used it {{as an example of the}} lack of imagination of Americans", while suggesting that having an actual suit or armor would be too costly to use for a photo shoot. Ironsword: Wizards & Warriors II was released by Acclaim for the NES in North America in December1989 and in Europe and Australia in 1991. It managed to sell about 500,000 copies in North America and about 50,000 copies in Europe. Following the game's release, Zippo Games would proceed to develop its next game for Rare, they would eventually also release the third installment in the Wizards & Warriors series, [...]|$|E
500|$|The {{band members}} stated that {{following}} the troublesome final years signed to Geffen Records, being an independent act again helped improve their mood and approach, with Vig remarking, [...] "There were no expectations; {{no one even}} knew we were recording. So it was all under the radar and pretty casual and we all felt inspired after having that amount of time off ... when we started writing songs, they came fast and furious. We probably wrote 24, 25 songs {{over the course of}} a couple of months. Marker commented that [...] "the business stuff ends up taking over some of that fun. We got really bogged down in people's expectations of what we were supposed to be doing, being on bigger record labels and stuff. With all that behind us, it was suddenly exciting again and it felt a lot like it did <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>first</b> formed, which was really just sort of a fun idea that we had." [...] Manson added, [...] "People at record companies live in fear of being wrong. Music cannot thrive in that environment. It is an unruly art form. You can't keep treating it like sausage meat. You have to let it morph and move and breathe." ...|$|E
500|$|James Arnold Taylor was Tidus' English-language voice. Taylor {{was offered}} the role by voice {{director}} Jack Fletcher (who believed that he would fit the character), and translator Alexander O. Smith explained Tidus to him. In contrast to Morita, Taylor made the character friendlier and less serious with the staff's approval. After recording Final Fantasy X, Taylor {{said that he would}} enjoy voicing Tidus again; the character was [...] "like an old friend to me now. I know so much more about him now than I did <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>first</b> started, knowing hardly anything about him. I would really hate it if anybody else voiced him". Recording the game took Taylor three-and-a-half months, and he enjoyed the experience. According to Taylor, it would be unrealistic for Tidus to hide emotion. He said that although there were things he would change about his performance (such as the scene where Tidus and Yuna begin laughing together), he was grateful for the warm fan reception of his work. Smith felt that the forced-laugh scene was adapted well from the original Japanese scene, because of how [...] "stilted and out of place" [...] it was in the original version. Smith was confused by Morita and Mayuko Aoki's performance, but after discussing it with Nojima he found it well done in both languages and called it [...] "awkward" [...] and [...] "funny". When Final Fantasy X was re-released in 2013, Taylor said that he was proud to be Tidus' voice.|$|E
