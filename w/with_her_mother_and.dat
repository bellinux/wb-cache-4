5|$|As a belated {{homage to}} his late father-in-law, Bizet {{took up the}} No√© {{manuscript}} and completed it. Parts of his moribund Vasco da Gama and Ivan IV were incorporated into the score, but a projected production at the Th√©√¢tre Lyrique failed to materialise when Carvalho's company finally went bankrupt, and No√© remained unperformed until 1885. Bizet's marriage was initially happy, but was affected by Genevi√®ve's nervous instability (inherited from both her parents), her difficult relations <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> by Mme. Hal√©vy's interference in the couple's affairs. Despite this, Bizet kept on good terms with his mother-in-law and maintained an extensive correspondence with her. In the year following the marriage, he considered plans for {{at least half a}} dozen new operas and began to sketch the music for two of them: Clarissa Harlowe based on Samuel Richardson's novel Clarissa, and Gris√©lidis with a libretto from Victorien Sardou. However, his progress on these projects was brought to a halt in July 1870, with the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War.|$|E
