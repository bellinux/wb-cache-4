500|$|Psycho-Pass further {{suggests}} {{that the price of}} living without stress includes overriding the individual's needs in favor of general social value. It is morally and socially acceptable to kill individuals who may potentially commit crimes, so long as <b>we</b> <b>accept</b> <b>that</b> the harm that a criminal causes to society outweighs the harm we cause to an individual who is falsely charged. In other words, the Sibyl System operates on the principles of opportunity cost and acceptable risk. But relying on the Sibyl System paradoxically creates a society which fears no crime as a whole, but individuals who personally fear the consequences of the Sibyl System's verdicts. As such, Urobuchi himself has said that one of the series' central thematic ideas is [...] "fear" [...] as seen through Shogo Makishima's feeling of being out of place - because the Sibyl System cannot recognize him for what he actually is, he feels displaced and deviant within the structure of society itself.|$|E

Ratzinger acknowledged that he had read the Third Secret, and stated in part that the Third Secret involves the [...] "importance of the novissimi", and [...] "dangers threatening the faith and the life of the Christian and therefore (the life) of the world." [...] Ratzinger also commented that, [...] "If it is not made public – {{at least for the time}} being – it is in order to prevent religious prophecy from being mistaken for a quest for the sensational." [...] Also, a news article quoted former Philippine ambassador to the Vatican, Howard Dee, as saying that Cardinal Ratzinger had personally confirmed to him that the messages of Akita and Fátima are [...] "essentially the same." [...] The Akita prophecy, in part, contains the following: [...] "The work of the devil will infiltrate even into the Church in such a way that one will see cardinals opposing cardinals, bishops against bishops. … churches and altars sacked ...." [...] On May 13, 2000, Cardinal Sodano announced that the Third Secret would be released, during which he implied the secret was about the persecution of Christians in the 20th century that culminated in the failed assassination attempt on Pope John Paul II on 13 May 1981. In a syndicated radio broadcast, Malachi Martin stated that the Third Secret [...] "doesn't make any sense unless <b>we</b> <b>accept</b> <b>that</b> there will be, or that there is in progress, a wholesale apostasy amongst clerics, and laity in the Catholic Church ...".|$|E
2500|$|If <b>we</b> <b>accept</b> <b>that</b> the extra-Calvinisticum's motto, Finitum non capax infinitum (the finite is {{not capable}} of the infinite), is a sound insight, {{it would appear that}} Künneth is {{adjusting}} or even giving up a strictly Lutheran view on the subject, while simultaneously providing a new and better explanation for the significance and resolution of the Lutheran and Calvinist debates over the presence of the body of Christ. In separating the issue from the Eucharist, and in essentially coming {{down on the side of}} Calvin's principle, Künneth has driven a wedge into dogmatic discussions of God that would prohibit such discussions apart from the doctrine and the historical reality of the Resurrection : in fact, he has conjoined them in the person and work of the Son, the bearer of both the infinite (in latent, pre-existent, and divinely right form) and the finite, through the vehicle of servanthood to both God and man. It is important to remember that for Künneth, Christ assumes our mortality in more than the fashion of [...] "putting on the clothes of our flesh" [...] (the Gnostic view of appearances), but that he is not half-human, nor is Jesus subordinated to [...] "time-bound humanity" [...] : he is the transcendent Son. For Künneth, steering a path between Gnosticism on the one hand, and empirical Liberalism on the other, does not mean accepting the neo-Orthodoxy of the paradox theologians. If we accept Placher's [...] "post-liberal" [...] reasoning on the subject, the answer as to how he does this is that he returns to the issue of the extra-Calvinisticum : that is, he returns to a wrestling with Christology that accepts the Nicene Creed, but that (unlike Logos Christianity), is unwilling to interpret the difficult Pauline passages about the Recapitulation and the relationship between the Father and the Son solely in light of a simplistic and literal reading of the first chapter of John.|$|E
