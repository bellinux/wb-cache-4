Capello left Carrick out of the subsequent England squad only to arrive at Wembley and see him play 79 minutes of the Community Shield match. Capello made a 'call me' sign as Carrick <b>walked</b> <b>past</b> his seat to collect the winner's medal.|$|E

He also competed in football, baseball, lacrosse and even ballroom dancing, winning the 1912 intercollegiate ballroom dancing championship.|$|E
5|$|In March 2014, {{the tower}} was scaled by 16-year-old Weehawken, New Jersey {{resident}} Justin Casquejo, {{who entered the}} site {{through a hole in}} a fence. He was subsequently arrested on trespassing charges. He allegedly dressed like a construction worker, sneaked in, and convinced an elevator operator to lift him to the tower’s 88th floor, according to news sources. He then used stairways to get to the 104th floor, <b>walked</b> <b>past</b> a sleeping security guard, and climbed up a ladder to get to the antenna, where he took pictures for two hours. The elevator operator was reassigned, and the guard was fired. It was then revealed that officials had failed to install security cameras in the tower, which facilitated Casquejo's entry to the site.|$|E

5|$|A former {{employee}} of Chandler's {{testified that he}} bragged about dating three women on the bay that night, and that {{the next morning he}} arrived and delivered materials for a job by boat and immediately set out again. In an attempt to establish Chandler's whereabouts {{on the night of the}} murders, investigators found records of several ship-to-shore telephone calls made from his boat to his home between 1:00am and 5:00am, which may have been attempts to explain his absence to his wife, and to provide himself with an alibi for the time of the murders. Chandler's daughter, Kristal May Sue, testified that her father had talked about killing three women, and that he was afraid of returning to Tampa. A maid, who worked at the motel where the Rogers women stayed, testified that she <b>walked</b> <b>past</b> Chandler on June 1 as she was heading for the Rogers' room for room service. She said that she did not realize the significance of this sighting until Chandler's arrest in 1992; the sighting has never been confirmed. Michelle's boyfriend and Hal Rogers also took the stand during trial.|$|E

25|$|The Japanese heavy {{artillery}} in Mount Suribachi opened their reinforced steel doors to fire, and then closed them immediately to prevent counterfire from the Marines and naval gunners. This {{made it difficult}} for American units to destroy a Japanese artillery piece. To make matters worse for the Americans, the bunkers were connected to the elaborate tunnel system so that bunkers that were cleared with flamethrowers and grenades were reoccupied shortly afterwards by Japanese troops moving through the tunnels. This tactic caused many casualties among the Marines, as they <b>walked</b> <b>past</b> the reoccupied bunkers without expecting to suddenly take fresh fire from them.|$|E

25|$|O'Riley's {{phone number}} (actually the number altered by Sebring) was dialed {{and picked up}} by Jean Sebring at a {{payphone}} in an Atlanta shopping mall, posing as an operator at the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Later, {{he was allowed to}} meet unsupervised with O'Riley in a predetermined car outside the detention center. Sebring, incognito, picked Abagnale up and drove him to an Atlanta bus station, where he took a Greyhound bus to New York, and soon thereafter, a train to Washington, D.C. Abagnale then bluffed his way through an attempted capture by posing as an FBI agent after being recognized by a motel registration clerk. Still intent on making his way to Brazil, Abagnale was picked up a few weeks later by two NYPD detectives when he inadvertently <b>walked</b> <b>past</b> their unmarked police car.|$|E
25|$|The next year, {{although}} the Islanders had won three straight Stanley Cups, more attention was {{being paid to}} the upstart Edmonton Oilers, whose young superstar Wayne Gretzky had just shattered existing scoring records. The 1982–83 season was thus a battle to decide which was {{the best team in}} the NHL. The Oilers had a better regular season, but the Islanders swept them in the Stanley Cup finals to win their fourth straight championship. Billy Smith was named the Most Valuable Player of the Playoffs after shutting down the Oilers' vaunted scoring machine. Gretzky failed to score a goal during the series. The Sutter brothers, Duane and Brent, scored 7 and 5 points respectively in the first 3 games, while Bossy again scored the Stanley Cup-winning goal in game four. After that game, the Oilers players <b>walked</b> <b>past</b> the Islanders' dressing room and were surprised to see the champions exhausted. Oilers players such as Gretzky and Mark Messier said that they realized at that moment how much it would actually take to win the Stanley Cup.|$|E
500|$|Billy {{was charged}} with [...] "unacceptable behaviour", [...] "lack of decorum" [...] and [...] "disobeying a direct order", and had to appear before his {{commanding}} officer, Lieutenant-Colonel Huw James.

The change meant that other fusiliers in the regiment {{no longer had to}} stand to attention when Billy <b>walked</b> <b>past,</b> as they had to when he was a lance corporal.|$|E

50|$|Commodities, when {{produced}} or imported, {{are stored}} in warehouses. From there they are distributed to retailers, which employ walkers. When a retailer walker <b>walks</b> <b>past</b> a house which requires a certain commodity, the house draws a small amount from the retailer's stockpile. This amount declines over time, and so is topped up every time the walker <b>walks</b> <b>past,</b> subject to availability.|$|R
500|$|In November 1961, fellow {{serviceman}} Billy Cox <b>walked</b> <b>past</b> an army {{club and}} heard Hendrix playing guitar. Intrigued by the proficient playing, {{which he described}} as a combination of [...] "John Lee Hooker and Beethoven", Cox borrowed a bass guitar and the two jammed. Within a few weeks, they began performing at base clubs on the weekends with other musicians in a loosely organized band called the Casuals.|$|E
500|$|Although Harrison had {{intended}} it for inclusion on Somewhere in England, [...] "Flying Hour" [...] dated from the sessions for his previous album, George Harrison (1979), and {{was recorded in}} March 1978. He wrote the song with Bad Company guitarist Mick Ralphs, who was among a coterie of local rock musicians, known informally as [...] "the Henley Music Mafia", with whom Harrison played and socialised from the late 1970s onwards. The lyrics recall the theme of Harrison's 1973 track [...] "Be Here Now", by advocating focusing only on the present. He adapted part of the words from an inscription on a clock tower at Friar Park, {{a legacy of the}} property's original owner, Frank Crisp. According to Harrison's wife, Olivia, each time they <b>walked</b> <b>past</b> the clock tower, he made a point of reading the inscription aloud: ...|$|E
500|$|Born in {{the sacred}} {{highland}} village of Alasora to King Andriamanelo and Queen Randapavola, Ralambo {{was the only one}} of his parents' children to survive to adulthood. [...] According to one legend, as a child he may have been known by the name Rabiby, being given the name Ralambo after successfully killing a particularly ferocious wild boar (lambo) in the woods. Another story attributes his name to a wild boar that <b>walked</b> <b>past</b> the threshold of the house where his mother was resting shortly after giving birth to him. However, both of these explanations are likely to have originated at some point after his reign; it is more probable that he took the name Ralambo after propagating the consumption of the meat of the zebu, called lambo in the proto-Malagasy language and the Malayo-Polynesian tongue from which it derived.|$|E

She is never going to be friends with her {{assistant}}." [...] A former assistant said, [...] "You definitely did not ride the elevator with her." [...] Unwritten rules imposed by Wintour at the Vogue offices forbid junior staff from initiating conversation with her; an editor who greeted her on the elevator was reprimanded by one of Wintour's assistants. (She calls that an exaggeration.) A visiting reporter saw a junior staff member appear visibly panicked when she realised she would have to be in the elevator with Wintour. Once a junior editor saw her trip in the hallway, <b>walked</b> <b>past</b> without offering assistance, and was later told she [...] "did absolutely the right thing." ...|$|E
500|$|Ben Gascoigne's parents met and [...] {{married in}} Levin, New Zealand, {{just before the}} First World War. They soon moved to Napier, where Gascoigne was born in 1915. He {{attended}} Auckland Grammar School, and won a scholarship to Auckland University College (now the University of Auckland) a year before he was due to finish high school. Faced with a choice between studying history or the sciences, he chose the latter {{because he had a}} severe stammer and thought that it would be less of an impediment. He completed both a Bachelor's degree and a Master's qualification in science, securing Honours in both mathematics and physics, finishing his studies in 1937. Despite these achievements, he did not consider himself to be practically trained, saying: [...] "I was still very much a theorist, with no practical physics at all. The professor in Auckland used to wince when I <b>walked</b> <b>past</b> the cupboard in which the good instruments were kept!" ...|$|E
500|$|While Korn {{was looking}} for a place to record their debut album, they asked {{producer}} Ross Robinson to produce their album. After accepting the offer, Robinson suggested they record at Indigo Ranch, Malibu, California. The band would record the majority of the album there, while additional recording took place at Bakersfield's Fat Tracks. Korn recorded most of the album with all members playing simultaneously, as opposed to recording instruments separately. The [...] "distinctive" [...] sound and quality of music was given off by their instruments, rather than the production. The bagpipes on [...] "Shoots and Ladders" [...] are often thought to have been recorded on a mountain-top. However, they were actually recorded with a microphone set up at the back door of the studio while Jonathan Davis <b>walked</b> <b>past</b> outside playing. As he walked further from the microphone, this led to the sound naturally fading quieter. Korn finished recording their self-titled album by the end of June 1994.|$|E

500|$|According to Cynthia Lennon, {{when the}} group <b>walked</b> <b>past</b> the Maharishi {{on the way to}} their taxis he looked [...] "very biblical and {{isolated}} in his faith". The Maharishi reportedly said, [...] "Wait, talk to me". After leaving the ashram, the taxis kept breaking down, leading the Beatles to wonder if the Maharishi had placed a curse on them. The car that the Lennons were in suffered a flat tyre and the driver left them, apparently to find a replacement tyre, but did not return for hours. After it grew dark the Lennons hitchhiked a ride to Delhi and took the first available flight back to London, during which John drunkenly recounted a litany of his numerous infidelities to Cynthia. The Harrisons were not ready to go home, so they travelled to other Indian cities and spent time with Ravi Shankar. Harrison said when he got dysentery he thought it might have been due to a spell cast by the Maharishi, but he recovered after Shankar gave him some amulets. Harrison later said he had never intended to stay for {{the second half of the}} course in Kashmir and that he thought Lennon wanted to get back to his relationship with Ono.|$|E
500|$|Sense and Sensibility {{was shot}} entirely on {{location}} within England, {{mostly in the}} counties of Berkshire, Surrey, Buckinghamshire, and Devon. Filming began in April 2007 and lasted until early June. Blackpool Mill, a fifteenth-century cottage in north Devon, was turned into Barton Cottage, {{the home of the}} Dashwood girls. The art director for the series, James Merifield, had <b>walked</b> <b>past</b> the cottage in 2006 and thought it would be an ideal setting for a film. He was later sent back to the cottage by the location manager for Sense and Sensibility, and he decided the place would be right for the production. The owners of Blackpool Mill, Sir Hugh and Lady Stucley, were contacted in February 2007 by the BBC who inquired about the possibility of filming there. Caroline Gammell from The Daily Telegraph reported that [...] "camera crews, production assistants, directors and actors swarmed over Blackpool Mill, turning the rustic four-bedroom home into the romantic hub of Jane Austen's novel. Set designers took the cottage more firmly into the 19th century, adding a porch at the front as well as dormer windows, fake shutters and an extra chimney." [...] The interior of cottage was [...] "a little scruffy" [...] for Mrs Dashwood's status, so scenes featuring the inside of the cottage were filmed in a studio. Filming took place at the cottage over eight days in May.|$|E
500|$|At the American Music Awards of 2016 {{she sang}} [...] "Million Reasons" [...] while playing a guitar, with the set {{resembling}} a camp ground. It received unanimous praise with Hilton Dresden from Out {{calling it a}} [...] "heart-wrenching" [...] rendition, while The Huffington Posts Cole Delbyck described it as [...] "stirring" [...] and [...] "emotional". Billboard listed it as the third best performance of the night describing it as [...] "resounding". A few days later Gaga visited the Ali Forney LGBT community centre and performed an acoustic version of [...] "Million Reasons", seated atop a piano wearing a T-shirt that read [...] "Be Brave". The next performance of the song occurred at the 2016 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show in Paris. Prior to the actual performance onstage, Gaga sang the track backstage {{with some of the}} models from the show. For the performance Gaga wore a black dress with fish-tail train, printed with red roses, high neck and long sleeves. According to Bethan Holt of The Daily Telegraph, the look was a contrast to the scarce dressed models who <b>walked</b> <b>past</b> her waving. Delbyck wrote in The Huffington Post that Gaga sounded [...] "off" [...] during the performance, and noted her [...] "awkward" [...] interaction with the models. He also opined that songs from Joanne were not the best selection for a Victoria's Secret show. Gaga was also a surprise performer at the 2016 Airbnb Open Spotlight, where she performed the song with Lindsey.|$|E
