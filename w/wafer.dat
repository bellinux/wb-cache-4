40|$|Abstract. Conversion {{efficiency}} of polycrystalline silicon pn solar cells, which are fabricated using <b>wafers</b> sliced out of B-doped p-type poly-Si ingots, strongly {{depends on where}} it is taken from within the ingot. Since the <b>wafers</b> near the bottom or top of the ingot cannot be used for commercial solar cells, {{the relationship between the}} conversion efficiency and the temperature dependence of the hole concentration in poly-Si <b>wafers</b> is investigated. It is found that the hole concentrations are classified into three categories. In <b>wafers</b> {{near the bottom of the}} ingot it is abnormal because it shows a peak, while the behavior in <b>wafers</b> near the top results from the incorporation of another acceptor species into the <b>wafers</b> or the creation of defects in the <b>wafers</b> besides B acceptors...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{mechanical}} integrity of photovoltaic (PV) silicon <b>wafers</b> {{is critical to}} avoid failure during solar cell manufacturing. Residual stress present in <b>wafers</b> affects {{mechanical integrity}}. Residual stresses are generated during solidification of ingots and during the <b>wafering</b> or wire sawing process used to produce silicon <b>wafers.</b> In this paper, the residual maximum shear stress in diamond wire sawn photovoltaic multi-crystalline silicon <b>wafers</b> corresponding to different crystal growth rates and their pre-and post-etched conditions are analyzed. The full-field residual stress distributions in the <b>wafers</b> are measured using near infra-red transmission birefringence polariscopy. Results show that <b>wafers</b> corresponding to the high crystal growth rate are characterized by larger residual maximum shear stress. As the growth rate increases to two times the standard growth rate, the average residual stress increases by 43 %. The increase in residual stress in the high growth rate <b>wafers</b> is attributed to the interaction of abrasives with more grain boundaries present in these <b>wafers.</b> Etching results in lower residual stress for all growth rates and ingot locations...|$|R
