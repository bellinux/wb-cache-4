60|$|She <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> fascinated, {{and made}} a slight affirmative {{movement}} of the hand.|$|E
50|$|In {{the last}} scene, Lucas enters the school’s gym while {{everyone}} <b>is</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> A last close-up {{to the park}} where Lucas used to play: it’s finally empty.|$|R
6000|$|Both {{the other}} men <b>were</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> with round eyes. [...] "What a {{perfectly}} extraordinary notion!" [...] cried Flambeau. [...] "Do {{you really think that}} is the truth?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Come here!' {{said the}} flat thin voice behind the curtain; and Kim came, {{conscious}} that eyes {{he could not}} see <b>were</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> One skinny brown finger heavy with rings lay {{on the edge of the}} cart, and the talk went this way: ...|$|R
60|$|But Sir Percy <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> {{with wide}} open eyes {{expressive}} of utmost amazement.|$|E
60|$|An {{exclamation from}} the other caused him to look up. Reggie Byng <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> wide-eyed.|$|E

50|$|Now, in the present, {{he looks}} up from the jade amulet to see Bai Wu Xia, who has sneaked into the side wing of the sanctum and <b>is</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> from behind a great pillar. He hesitates, then vows to remain celibate, and she leaves.|$|R
6000|$|As Hereward {{had spoken}} with some slight emotion, {{he had dropped}} unawares his assumed Flemish accent, and had spoken in broad burly Lincolnshire; and {{therefore}} it was that Perry, who had <b>been</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> by the moonlight all the while, said, when he was done, tremblingly,-- ...|$|R
6000|$|All <b>were</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> thunderstruck and still, except Father Brown, who {{heaved a}} huge sigh as {{of relief and}} fingered the little phial in his pocket. [...] "Thank God!" [...] he muttered; [...] "that's much more probable. The poison belongs to this robber-chief, of course. He carries it so that he may never be captured, like Cato." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Of course it's me; who did {{you think}} it was?" [...] replied Johnny Chuck rather crossly, for Peter <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> as if he had never seen him before.|$|E
60|$|Jimmy did {{not forget}} {{to close the}} door. As he walked {{the length of the}} interminable room between rows of desks, before which were seated young men and young women, all of whom Jimmy thought <b>were</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> he could feel the deep crimson burning upward from his collar to the roots of his hair.|$|R
60|$|As {{this family}} {{discussion}} was taking place, the gentlemen whose appearance had created {{so much attention}} {{came to the door}} of the inn, and the elder and stouter was seen to smile at his companion; after which he strolled leisurely over the green, and seemed to examine with much benevolent satisfaction the assemblage of villagers who <b>were</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> and the quadrupeds.|$|R
60|$|Rowland had fancied that Roderick {{had no more}} surprises for him; but he <b>was</b> now <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> wide-eyed.|$|R
60|$|The whole {{audience}} <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> He did {{not dare}} peep at them, but he could hear their murmur of amazement. Now that he was up he rather enjoyed defying them.|$|E
6000|$|Hapley was thunderstruck. He gasped. The Vicar <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> Clearly the man saw nothing. [...] "The eye {{of faith}} {{is no better}} than the eye of science," [...] said Hapley awkwardly.|$|E
6000|$|Wilfred Bohun <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> {{with a sort}} of hypnotised horror, while Father Brown {{listened with}} his head a little on one side, really {{interested}} and attentive. The doctor went on with more hissing emphasis: ...|$|E

60|$|She looked <b>at</b> <b>him</b> steadily. She looked <b>at</b> <b>him</b> {{with a sort}} of queenly woodenness, as if he {{were behind}} a camera with a velvet bag over his head and had just told her to moisten the lips with the tip of the tongue. Her aspect {{staggered}} Lord Dawlish. A cursory inspection of his conscience showed nothing but purity and whiteness, but he must have done something, or she would not <b>be</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> like this.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of the {{painting}} "Daniel in the Lion's Den" by Riviere, [s. d. ]. Daniel can be seen standing at left with his hands tied behind his back. His back is facing several lions at right. The lions appear to be sizing Daniel up as some <b>are</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> A bone <b>is</b> visible in the left foreground. See CHS- 8746 and CHS- 8745 : they show a similar scene with Daniel by the same artist...|$|R
60|$|Sure enough, {{a little}} animal soon crossed their path, making the funny noise at every step. But {{as soon as}} he saw that Twinkle <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> he stopped popping and rushed into a bunch of tall grass and hid himself.|$|E
60|$|He {{forgot that}} he had rung the bell. A very young servant had {{answered}} the door and <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> He would have walked in if the small servant had not planted herself deliberately in his way. It recalled him to himself.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{came here}} to see you," [...] he said, [...] "--you." [...] She <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> now, in horror. [...] "And if you don't give me what I want, I cal'late to see some one else--in there," [...] said Mr. Hopper.|$|E
6000|$|... 'We <b>was</b> all <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> surprised, {{especially}} Uncle Dick Tuxton, whose particular pet {{the parrot}} was. He'd brought him home {{all the way}} from some foreign parts.|$|R
50|$|The Simpsons {{are at a}} {{baseball}} game and Bart catches a fly ball, pushing the Springfield Isotots into the championships.

However, when he wakes up, everybody <b>is</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> so he gets up and exclaims his love for the mattress and manages to sell five; he is promptly hired as a mattress salesman.|$|R
6000|$|Lingard did not answer. The image {{evoked by}} Almayer; {{the picture of}} Willems ranging over the islands and {{disturbing}} the harmony of the universe by robbery, treachery, and violence, held him silent, entranced--painfully spellbound. Almayer, after waiting for a little while, moved reluctantly towards the gangway, lingered there, then sighed and got over the side, going down step by step. His head disappeared slowly below the rail. Lingard, who had <b>been</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> absently, started suddenly, ran to the side, and looking over, called out-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Just curious." [...] He studied her. She {{had taken}} off her coat, tossing it over {{the end of the}} cot. She was young, about twenty. Slim. Her long hair {{stretched}} out over the pillow. She <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> silently, her eyes dark and large.|$|E
60|$|Aunt Julia <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> She is {{what they}} call a well-preserved woman. It's easy to see that, twenty-five years ago, she must have been {{something}} quite extraordinary to look at. Even now she's almost beautiful. She has very large brown eyes, a mass of soft grey hair, and the complexion of a girl of seventeen.|$|E
6000|$|The room {{seemed to}} swim around him. She <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> {{but he could}} see in her vacant eyes that she had no {{conception}} of his secret, nor knew the extent of her revelation. Duffy had not dared to tell all! He burst into a coarse laugh. [...] "What matters Duffy or the silly woman he'd try to steal away from other men." ...|$|E
25|$|In December 1993, Morrison {{was charged}} with assault and public {{intoxication}} when he allegedly punched a University of Iowa student.
