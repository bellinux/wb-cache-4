Furthermore, this study analyzed the appropriateness of retrofitting with low-consumption <b>water</b> <b>closets</b> and urinals based on the actual water consumption. The {{purpose of this study is}} to analyze the cost-effectiveness of water savings from retrofitting <b>water</b> <b>closets</b> and urinals in restrooms of the Langford Architecture building A at Texas A&M University. The researcher directly {{measured the}} actual water-volume per flush of as-is, tune-up, low-consumption manual, and low-consumption automatic <b>water</b> <b>closets</b> and urinals. The data collected by these observations was analyzed, and the researcher evaluated the water savings of retrofitting <b>water</b> <b>closets</b> and urinals. Finally, this study provides the actual water-consumption data of sanitary fixtures and proves that retrofitting with low-consumption fixtures can save on water costs. The results will present practical standards to facility managers and other building professionals and will also contribute to determining the feasibility of retrofitting <b>water</b> <b>closets</b> and urinals...|$|R

25|$|In America, the chain-pull indoor toilet was {{introduced}} in the homes of the wealthy and in hotels, soon after its invention in England in the 1880s. Flush toilets were introduced in the 1890s. William Elvis Sloan invented the Flushometer in 1906, which used pressurized water directly from the supply line for faster recycle time between flushes. The Flushometer is still in use today in public restrooms worldwide. The vortex-flushing toilet bowl, which creates a self-cleansing effect, was invented by Thomas MacAvity Stewart of Saint John, New Brunswick in 1907. Philip Haas of Dayton, Ohio, made some significant developments, including the flush rim toilet with multiple jets of water from a ring and the <b>water</b> <b>closet</b> flushing and recycling mechanism similar to those in use today.|$|E
25|$|Despite the opposition, Manchester's first proper {{council was}} elected in 1838, {{although}} its area of jurisdiction was quite small, and there were independent areas within the city, such as Chorlton-on-Medlock, which had their own committees to manage local functions. The new council began the task of constructing a brick-built sewerage network within the city. In 1847, John Francis the Borough Surveyor suggested using egg-shaped clay pipes instead, and using these proved to be much quicker. However, the period also saw {{the introduction of the}} <b>water</b> <b>closet,</b> the forerunner of the modern flush toilet, and this resulted in much larger volumes of effluent entering the system. The council tried to limit their use to public buildings and the homes of the rich, as the waste was discharged in an untreated state into the rivers, which were becoming grossly polluted. This policy was not successful, and by the early 1890s, around 90 per cent of the housing in Manchester had water closets.|$|E
25|$|The guard room above {{included}} an iron cell for drunks and less dangerous prisoners including women. Due to the courthouse's small size, the county needed to rent additional office space nearly immediately after completion. The building's inadequate space {{combined with a}} leaking roof would cause repairs and improvements to consume the majority of commissioners' time after 1982. In 1883, county commissioners denounced the building as too small and {{badly in need of}} repairs. After publishing an invitation for bids to construct a new, two-floor facility, they accepted one offered by Keesey due to his original land donation. One month later, after political infighting that resulted in the resignation of the county judge, all bids were then rejected. In the aftermath, the next meeting of the Commissioners Court called for a new tax levy to provide additional rooms for the jail and county clerk's office and five iron cages for upper jail cell. Although the cages were indeed installed, there is little proof that the building underwent any further expansion. In 1884, glass was installed in the windows of the clerk's office, and the sheriff was ordered to remove the <b>water</b> <b>closet</b> and fill the well in the courtyard.|$|E

50|$|The family firm {{continued}} until 1967 and by 1895 their catalogue listed at least 36 towns where public conveniences had been installed. Paris, Florence, Berlin, Madrid, and Sydney {{as well as}} South America and the Far East. They provided <b>water</b> <b>closets</b> to at least 30 railway companies in Britain, and other railways in America, Argentina, Mexico and South Africa. Their hard-bound catalogues were thick books that show a huge variety of <b>water</b> <b>closets,</b> urinals, basins, baths, Turkish baths, saunas, among many others.|$|R
500|$|By the 1930s, {{extensive}} use of the <b>water</b> <b>closet</b> meant {{that the amount of}} night soil being delivered to Carrington Moss had dropped significantly. [...] During this period, the majority of refuse placed on the Moss came from ash bins, although some was from slaughterhouses and lairage facilities. [...] In 1923, manure of only moderate value was being delivered, supplemented by sulphate of potash, sulphate of ammonia, and super-phosphates. [...] Altrincham Sewage Farm (visible on the above map) was used to flood the surrounding fields with sewage water. [...] To the west, a series of disused marl-pits formed Timperley Sewage Beds, a further source of manure.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the more}} {{advanced}} <b>water</b> <b>closet</b> (flush toilet) was popular in wealthy homes, {{the lack of an}} adequate water supply and poor sewerage meant that in 19th-century England, in working-class neighbourhoods, towns and cities often chose dry conservancy methods of waste disposal. [...] The pail closet was an evolution of the midden closet (privy midden or midden closet), an impractical and unsanitary amenity considered a nuisance to public health. [...] The pail system was popular in France and England, particularly in the historic Lancashire town of Rochdale, from which the system commonly took its name. [...] The pail closet was not without its own problems; if the pail was not emptied on a regular basis, it overflowed and became unhygienic. [...] Some manufacturers lined the pail with absorbent materials, and other designs used mixtures of dry earth or ash to disguise the smell.|$|E
500|$|The {{purchase}} {{was part}} of the corporation's ultimately unsuccessful plan to retain the pail closet system (now superseded by the <b>water</b> <b>closet),</b> and followed a public scandal created by the daily dumping of 30–60tons of human faeces into the Medlock and Irwell rivers, at Holt Town sewage works. [...] It paid about £38,000 (£ as of [...] ), for the site, but the bog's depth, between [...] deep pushed the total development cost to almost £94,000 (£ as of [...] ). [...] The [...] estate included [...] of wild mossland, [...] of partly cultivated mossland, [...] of mossland under cultivation and [...] of incomplete roads. [...] A number of brick buildings were included, along with Asphodel Farm and Ash Farm, both with wooden farmhouses. [...] The corporation rented [...] of land in small holdings to local farmers and kept [...] for itself.|$|E

50|$|In 1922 a new {{staircase}} {{was added}} between {{the front and}} rear sections of the building, and the toilet block was reworked in 1924 to replace the original earth <b>closets</b> with <b>water</b> <b>closets.</b>|$|R
50|$|Lavatories and <b>water</b> <b>closets</b> {{normally}} {{connect to}} the water supply {{by means of a}} supply, which is a tube, usually of nominal 3/8 in (U.S.) or 10 or 12 mm diameter (Europe and Middle East), which connects the water supply to the fixture, sometimes through a flexible (braided) hose. For <b>water</b> <b>closets,</b> this tube usually ends in a flat neoprene washer that tightens against the connection, while for lavatories, the supply usually ends in a conical neoprene washer. Kitchen sinks, tubs and showers usually have supply tubes built onto their valves which then are soldered or 'fast joint'ed directly onto the water supply pipes.|$|R
500|$|On {{ceremonial}} occasions Dudley often {{acted as}} an unofficial consort, {{sometimes in the}} Queen's stead. In a personal letter to the Earl of Shrewsbury, {{an old friend of}} Leicester's, Elizabeth said she considered Leicester as [...] "another ourself". He largely assumed charge of court ceremonial and organised hundreds of small and large festivities. From 1587 he was Lord Steward, being responsible for the royal household's supply with food and other commodities. He displayed a strong sense for economising and reform in this function, which he had de facto occupied long before his official appointment. The sanitary situation in the palaces was a perennial problem, and a talk with Leicester about these issues inspired John Harington to construct a <b>water</b> <b>closet.</b> Leicester was a lifelong sportsman, hunting and jousting in the tiltyard, and an indefatigable tennis-player. He was also the Queen's regular dancing partner.|$|E
500|$|By 1869, Manchester had a {{population}} of about 354,000 people who were served by about 10,000water closets (flush toilets) and 38,000middensteads. [...] An investigation of the condition of the city's sewer network revealed that it was [...] "choked up with an accumulation of solid filth, caused by overflow from the middens." [...] (Middens and middensteads both refer to dunghills, ash pits, or refuse heaps.) Such problems forced the city authorities to consider other methods of dealing with human excretion. [...] Although the <b>water</b> <b>closet</b> was used in wealthy homes, concerns over river pollution, costs and available water supplies meant that most towns and cities chose more labour-intensive dry conservancy systems. Manchester was one such city and by 1877 its authorities had replaced about 40,000middens with pail and midden closets, rising to 60,000by 1881. [...] The soil surrounding the old middens was cleared out, connections with drains and sewers removed and dry closets erected over each site. [...] A contemporary estimate stated that the installation of about 25,000 pail closets removed as much as [...] of urine and accompanying faeces from the city's drains, sewers and rivers.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the successes}} seen in various {{northern}} towns, about 7,000 pail closets {{were introduced in}} 1871 in Leicester, where the implementation of water closets had been hindered by the refusal of the water company to provide adequate supplies. [...] The use of pail closets reduced the demand placed upon the area's inadequate sewerage system, but the town suffered with difficulties in the collection and treatment of the night soil. [...] Initially, night soil was collected by contractors, but after 1873 the local authority became responsible. [...] The authority found dealing with the night soil an expensive and difficult business and, following legal proceedings against the corporation in 1878, transport of night soil was transferred from the railway system to canal barges. [...] This, however, led to complaints that the canal was being polluted. [...] In 1886, the authority found that the River Soar was badly polluted by sewage and so they built a sewage farm at Beaumont Leys. [...] By {{the end of the}} 19th century, this and {{the construction of a new}} sewer system enabled all pail closets to be phased out and replaced by water closets. [...] In Manchester, faced with phenomenal population growth, the council attempted to retain the pail closet system, but following the exposure of the dumping of [...] of human faeces into the Medlock and Irwell rivers at their Holt Town sewage works, the council was forced to change their plans. [...] Originally they had intended to build incinerators, but public objections to the dumping of waste into rivers forced the council instead to purchase Carrington Moss in 1886, and Chat Moss in 1895, which were both developed as refuse disposal sites. [...] But by the 1930s neither site was still receiving night soil, the <b>water</b> <b>closet</b> having replaced dry conservancy in Manchester.|$|E

50|$|Historically, the Danville Stove and Manufacturing Company {{was located}} near Sechler Run. The Hanover Brewing Company {{was located in}} the Blizzards Run sub-watershed, east of Danville.

2500|$|Another {{pioneering}} manufacturer was Thomas William Twyford, {{who invented}} the single piece, ceramic flush toilet. The 1870s {{proved to be a}} defining period for the sanitary industry and the water closet; the debate between the simple <b>water</b> <b>closet</b> trap basin made entirely of earthenware and the very elaborate, complicated and expensive mechanical <b>water</b> <b>closet</b> would fall under public scrutiny and expert opinion. In 1875, the [...] "wash-out" [...] trap <b>water</b> <b>closet</b> was first sold and was found as the public's preference for basin type water closets. By 1879, Twyford had devised his own type of the [...] "wash out" [...] trap <b>water</b> <b>closet,</b> he titled it the [...] "National", and became the most popular wash-out <b>water</b> <b>closet.</b>|$|E
2500|$|By the 1880s, the {{free-standing}} <b>water</b> <b>closet</b> {{was sold}} and quickly gained popularity; the free-standing <b>water</b> <b>closet</b> {{was able to}} be cleaned more easily and was therefore a more hygienic <b>water</b> <b>closet.</b> Twyford's [...] "Unitas" [...] model was free standing and made completely of earthenware. Throughout the 1880s he submitted further patents for improvements to the flushing rim and the outlet. Finally in 1888, he applied for a patent protection for his [...] "after flush" [...] chamber; the device allowed for the basin to be refilled by a lower quantity of clean water in reserve after the <b>water</b> <b>closet</b> was flushed. The modern pedestal [...] "flush-down" [...] toilet was demonstrated by Frederick Humpherson of the Beaufort Works, Chelsea, England in 1885.|$|E

5000|$|By 1904, the {{new company}} advertised in {{national}} trade journals that they had [...] "highest financial standing and absolutely guarantee our goods."

5000|$|Although quite fashionable in Sydney and in London, flats {{designed}} {{especially for}} single women were uncommon in Queensland, {{and no other}} self-contained block for this purpose {{is known to have}} been purpose-constructed in Brisbane in the interwar period. Sometimes referred to as [...] "bachelor flats", they were distinguished from one-bedroom flats in that the bedroom and sitting room were combined, with a small kitchenette attached (sometimes just an alcove with a sink and single gas burner). Bachelor flats often had shared bathrooms, <b>water</b> <b>closets</b> and laundries, and were in reality tenements, not self-contained flats. For example, the only other identified, purpose-built interwar flat/tenement building in Brisbane designed expressly to accommodate single girls was St Helier, a block of six brick tenements erected in 1930 in Grey St, South Brisbane (no longer extant). Each apartment comprised a bed-sitting room with kitchenette. Bathrooms and <b>water</b> <b>closets</b> were shared - one bath per three persons - and there was a common laundry. In 1932 a second storey was added, comprising three tenements and an owner's flat of six rooms. Similarly, a few blocks of [...] "bachelor flats" [...] or tenements were erected in Brisbane for single men - such as Donegal (1934 and 1936) on St Paul's Terrace in Fortitude Valley. Bulolo was unusual in that, although designed along the lines of [...] "bachelor flats", the apartments were self-contained with private bathrooms and <b>water</b> <b>closets.</b>|$|R
