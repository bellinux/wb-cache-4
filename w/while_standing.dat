5|$|The agung {{is usually}} {{performed}} <b>while</b> <b>standing</b> beside the instrument, holding the upper edge of its flange between the thumb and other fingers {{with the left}} hand while striking the knob with the right hand. The mallets, called balu, are made from short sticks about half a foot in length and padded with soft but tough material such as rubber at one end. Using these balus, players handle the agung {{similar to the way}} a brass tom-tom is played.|$|E

5|$|The first {{death on}} Giant Dipper {{occurred}} {{four months after}} it debuted, on September 21.

The emergency brake was applied, but the boy fell head first onto the track and was crushed by the roller coaster train. Other fatalities also occurred in 1940 and 1970. Several modifications have been made to the trains as a result.|$|E
5|$|The gandingan {{is usually}} played <b>while</b> <b>standing</b> behind the {{instrument}} with the gandingan player holding two wooden mallets. The mallets, called balu, are wrapped tightly with strips of rubber {{at one end}} and are considered lighter and smaller than those balu used for the agung. The rubber ends of the balu are held between the opposing knobs of the gandingan and the player would use them to strike the knobs to achieve a sound.|$|E

A large number of on-duty police officers watched from nearby.|$|E

Upon seeing them, she becomes sexually aroused and stimulates herself. Meanwhile, {{the man and the}} previous woman have sex in the missionary position. Soon after, the other woman joins them and the man has sex with her doggy style. Later, they have a threesome, and one of the women subsequently gives the man fellatio. After finishing the sexual acts, they return to the car.|$|E
5|$|By 1859, Rosalie Cadron-Jetté's {{health was}} {{worsening}} significantly. Information about the particular conditions she was afflicted with is contradictory. Testimony from Cadron-Jetté's family suggests that Cadron-Jetté had become ill {{when she was}} 36 years old and never fully recovered. Other sources suggest generalised edema, known {{at the time as}} dropsy, while still others diagnose her with chronic nephritis, known at the time as Bright's disease, which worsened over the following years. Symptoms observed in Cadron-Jetté by her contemporaries included difficulty breathing, almost constant coughing, fits of breathlessness <b>while</b> <b>standing</b> and at rest, and swollen legs displaying open sores.|$|E
5|$|During his youth, Olajuwon was {{a soccer}} goalkeeper, which helped {{give him the}} {{footwork}} and agility to balance his size and strength in basketball, and also contributed to his shot-blocking ability. Olajuwon did not play basketball {{until the age of}} 17, when he entered a local tournament. It has been said that a coach in Nigeria once asked him to dunk and demonstrated <b>while</b> <b>standing</b> on a chair. Olajuwon then tried to stand on the chair himself. When redirected by staff not to use the chair, Hakeem could initially not dunk the basketball.|$|E

5|$|Following this, Inna appears {{wearing a}} yellow dress <b>while</b> <b>standing</b> on a stair, with her shadow not moving alike to her. When the track's {{breakdown}} is played, Inna is presented {{lying on a}} XXL-photo of her face, {{and she and her}} backup dancers are particularly shown clapping their hands and performing subtle movements. The visual ends with Inna appearing on the TV's display from the beginning, before it is switched off by a woman previously shown. Scenes interspersed through the main plot portray people performing tribal moves while the video's frame is vertically constrained to just the center of the screen, and two lesbian girls touching their body and picturing themselves.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} {{to changes in}} the tone of the show, Noah has also implemented stylistic changes to the show, with an updated set, new graphics and his monologue sometimes taking place <b>while</b> <b>standing</b> in front of a screen as opposed to sitting at the desk. Trevor also increased the usage of more millennial based references, impersonations & characterisations for his comedy on the show, due to his younger demographic and his ability to speak in multiple accents and eight languages.|$|E
5|$|In some European Celtic or Germanic {{countries}} {{prior to}} the adoption of Christianity, the ruler upon his election was raised on a shield and, <b>while</b> <b>standing</b> upon it, was borne on the shoulders of several chief men of the nation (or tribe) in a procession around his assembled subjects. This was usually performed three times. Following this, the king was given a spear, and a diadem wrought of silk or linen (not to be confused with a crown) was bound around his forehead as a token of regal authority.|$|E

5|$|Sheriff Tate {{arrives and}} discovers that Bob Ewell has {{died during the}} fight. The sheriff argues with Atticus about the {{prudence}} and ethics of charging Jem (whom Atticus believes to be responsible) or Boo (whom Tate believes to be responsible). Atticus eventually accepts the sheriff's story that Ewell simply fell on his own knife. Boo asks Scout to walk him home, and after she says goodbye to him at his front door he disappears again. <b>While</b> <b>standing</b> on the Radley porch, Scout imagines life from Boo's perspective, and regrets {{that they had never}} repaid him for the gifts he had given them.|$|E
5|$|The scenes at {{the marina}} where Dexter keeps his boat, Coral Cove, were filmed at the Leeward Bay Marina in Los Angeles' Wilmington neighborhood, {{in spite of}} the show's Miami setting. The episode opens in a coffee bar at Coral Cove Marina, which was filmed at Leeward Bay's {{floating}} diner, the Chowder Barge. One of the empty barns at Long Beach, California's Shoreline Village was set up as the comic book store. Doakes and LaGuerta discuss the homicide case <b>while</b> <b>standing</b> on the Shoreline Village boardwalk, and the Village car park was used to film Doakes and LaGuerta's stake out.|$|E
5|$|The video {{starts with}} showing the world {{evolving}} from its genesis. Images of volcanoes erupting, dinosaurs and tidal waves flash by to show Madonna {{and her two}} backup dancers singing the song <b>while</b> <b>standing</b> on a hill. It continues in this fluid motion up to the intermediate verse when Madonna is shown crawling under the waves and spirals. As the song moves towards the bridge again, the scene changes from the mountains to a cityscape. Madonna and her dancers are shown dancing and singing the song on a skyscraper. The video ends with Madonna standing on {{the building and the}} camera autofocusing out of the panel.|$|E

5|$|Unusually {{for someone}} {{physically}} removed from power, Baxter {{was allowed to}} remain free in Pulaski County.

5|$|Whale tail is the Y-shaped {{waistband}} of a thong or G-string when visible above the waistline of low-rise jeans, shorts, or a skirt {{that resembles a}} whale's tail. Intentionally or unintentionally, a whale tail is exposed above the trousers mostly when sitting or bending, or even <b>while</b> <b>standing.</b> The frequency or occasion depends on the style of trousers, the style of underwear, {{and the way they}} are worn. Displaying whale tails became popular in the early 2000s, together with the rise of low-rise jeans and thong underwear. The trend, popularized by a number of female celebrities including Christina Aguilera, Victoria Beckham, Mariah Carey, Paris Hilton and Britney Spears, waned within the decade.|$|E
5|$|When wide {{receiver}} Kelvin Kirk suffered a concussion in a July 1977 {{game against the}} Ottawa Rough Riders, Allison was forced to substitute as a {{wide receiver}}. After playing five regular season games with the Argonauts in 1977, Allison {{was traded to the}} Calgary Stampeders for Rudy Linterman. He played in four games for the Stampeders during the 1977 season. Allison tore his Achilles tendon in September when he was hit <b>while</b> <b>standing</b> on the sideline, and the injury ended his season.|$|E
