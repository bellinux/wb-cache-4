Although they were both large frigates, they had been largely disarmed in France to create space for cargo: Furieuse was provided with only 20 cannon (including 12 carronades) and a crew of just 200, while Félicité had even fewer defences, carrying just 14 cannon and 174 men. <b>Watching</b> <b>these</b> ships was a small British blockade force led by Hugh Pigot in Latona with a few brigs and sloops, Cochrane's invasion fleet having been dispersed.|$|E

He filled the time from the age of 14 to the age of enlistment by working as a Post Office messenger boy. It was at this time McCudden's interest in flying began. In nearby Leysdown, on the Isle of Sheppey, one of the first aviation centres was built. It was here John Moore-Brabazon became the first Englishman to fly.

In a review on his blog on 17 January 2008, David Knox, stated that Underbelly [...] "is our own Sopranos", and awarded it 4.5 out of 5. He also commented [...] "If there are any criticisms to be found with Underbelly, they are few. One or two shots give away that period Melbourne was actually shot in 2007. And while <b>watching</b> <b>these</b> gangsters thrive on power with ballsy disdain, it was hard not to think of the behaviour of some television executives in recent history. This aside, Underbelly looks set to be one of the highlights of the 2008 television year." [...] A review appeared in the Herald Sun on 18 January 2008, in which critic Paul Anderson quoted: [...] "Whether you followed the Melbourne gangland war or not, there's a fair chance you will be blown away by the coming TV series Underbelly. [...] is a slick, violent and sexually charged dramatisation backed by a ripping soundtrack." [...] In an article appearing on 31 January 2008, The Daily Telegraph's TV editor, Marcus Casey, said of Underbelly after viewing the first four episodes: [...] "If the quality is maintained then, while not perfect, Underbelly should equal, if not better, Australia's best ever crime dramas – the Phoenix series and Blue Murder." ...|$|E

[...] Chad Presley from Blogcritics felt that, [...] "There's {{a healthy dose of}} nostalgia involved in <b>watching</b> <b>these</b> videos for anyone who grew up during the 1980s in particular. [...] The video quality is a mixed bag. Most of the visual problems crop up during the earlier clips, which were photographed on much more primitive equipment. [...] All things considered, especially when viewed on a Blu-ray player and hi-def TV, this is a pretty rough looking set. Even some of the later videos have an excess of visual noise and are lacking in sharpness." [...] Ian Sturges from Daily Mirror commented, [...] "Celebration is a journey [...] from coquettish wannabe to pop goddess to institution.

500|$|While still {{rooted in}} pop punk, Blink-182 finds the band {{expanding}} their sonic template with darker, restless songs. The compositions {{on the record}} {{have been described as}} musically diverse and [...] "borderline experimental," [...] with sullen moodiness and off-kilter hooks the basis for many tracks. The record pulls from a variety of styles, including electronic rock, jangle pop, and [...] "reflective" [...] alternative rock. Experimentation was constantly present: the band tried different mic techniques and toyed with harmonium organs, Polynesian Gamelan bells, [...] and turntables. The band infused these experimentalist elements into their usual pop punk sound, inspired by lifestyle changes (the band members all became fathers before the album was released) and side-projects (Box Car Racer and Transplants.) In a full article about the album in the November 20, 2003 edition of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Ben Wener described the music of the album as [...] "expansive, downcast, and sometimes spectral." [...] The New York Times considered that the album may have been influenced by the growing popularity of emo pop, while AllMusic regarded it a delve into post-punk. [...] "Much of the punk has been dissolved, the buzzsaw guitars faded into the corners, allowing room for staggering dynamics, cathartic guitar bursts and a weightier, more experimental and ambitious sound", wrote Tom Bryant of Kerrang!. The goal for Blink-182 was continuity: each song develops lyrically like chapters in a book, and songs segue into one another to present a cohesive feel instead of a regular collection of tracks. [...] In addition to the side-projects, the music of the album was inspired by the September 11 attacks and the onset of the Iraq War. The mood was unsettling for DeLonge, whose brother is a Navy officer: [...] "It was so weird because we'd all be glued to the TV, <b>watching</b> <b>these</b> bombs explode over another country. So I'd see all this and wonder where he was at, and then we'd have to go into the next room and sing or finish writing lyrics. I think it affected our moods throughout the day." [...] In addition, it was just inspired by socializing: [...] "We would just hang out for hours talking. It was really cool", said DeLonge.|$|E
