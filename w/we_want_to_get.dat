5|$|The primary {{formulation}} of Kant's ethics is the categorical imperative, {{from which he}} derived four further formulations. Kant made a distinction between categorical and hypothetical imperatives. A hypothetical imperative is one we must obey {{if we want to}} satisfy our desires: 'go to the doctor' is a hypothetical imperative because we are only obliged to obey it if <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> well. A categorical imperative binds us regardless of our desires: everyone has a duty to not lie, regardless of circumstances and even if it is in our interest to do so. These imperatives are morally binding because they are based on reason, rather than contingent facts about an agent. Unlike hypothetical imperatives, which bind us insofar as we are part of a group or society which we owe duties to, we cannot opt out of the categorical imperative because we cannot opt out of being rational agents. We owe a duty to rationality by virtue of being rational agents; therefore, rational moral principles apply to all rational agents at all times.|$|E

If we can do that no matter how small the f(x) neighborhood is, then f is continuous atnbsp&x0.|$|E

He said he was sure the band would collaborate with producer Rick Rubin again. According to Blabbermouth.net, the band was considering recording its next album {{in the second half of}} 2011. In November 2010, during an {{interview with}} The Pulse of Radio, Ulrich said Metallica would return to writing in 2011. Ulrich said, [...] "There's a bunch of balls in the air for 2011, but I think the main one is we really want to get back to writing again. We haven't really written since, what, '06, '07, and <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> back to kind of just being creative again. Right now we are going to just chill out and then probably start up again in, I'd say, March or April, and start probably putting the creative cap back on and start writing some songs." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Margaritaville" [...] {{was written}} and {{directed}} by series co-founder Trey Parker. It first aired on March 25, 2009 in the United States on Comedy Central. Parker and fellow co-creator Matt Stone said they had long planned to do an episode about the global recession, and they argued over whether to start the season with an episode about the economy, or [...] "The Ring," [...] an episode mocking the Jonas Brothers, a boy band which had recently grown in popularity. Stone argued the season premiere should focus on the economy because it was the biggest news item at the time, but Parker felt they needed more time to craft the script, and that the Jonas Brothers would be a funny season opener. Stone ultimately agreed, and later admitted it was the right decision. During an interview {{a few weeks before the}} episode aired, Stone said, [...] "That's one of those big things <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> right. We'll be talking about what kind of social commentary we want to make and do it right." ...|$|E
500|$|Nintendo has {{hoped to}} target a wider {{demographic}} with its console {{than that of}} others in the seventh generation. At a press conference for the then-upcoming Nintendo DS game [...] in December 2006, Satoru Iwata insisted [...] "We're not thinking about fighting Sony, but about how many people we can get to play games. The thing we're thinking about most is not portable systems, consoles, and so forth, but that <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> new people playing games." [...] This is reflected in Nintendo's series of television advertisements in North America (directed by Academy Award winner Stephen Gaghan) and its Internet ads. The advertising slogans were [...] "Wii would like to play" [...] and [...] "Experience a new way to play"; the ads began November 15, 2006, and had a total budget of over US$200million for the year. The productions were Nintendo's first broad-based advertising strategy and included a two-minute video clip showing an assortment of people enjoying the Wii system: urban apartment-dwellers, ranchers, grandparents, and parents with their children. The music in the ads was from the song [...] "Kodo (Inside the Sun Remix)" [...] by the Yoshida Brothers. The marketing campaign was successful; pensioners as old as 103 were reported to be playing the Wii in the United Kingdom. A report by the British newspaper The People also stated that Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom has used the console.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Paul Hunter, known {{for his work on}} previous Michael Jackson and TLC clips. However, for unknown reasons, the video was scrapped, and Hilson re-shot a clip for the video with [...] "Knock You Down" [...] and [...] "Number One" [...] director Chris Robinson. Robinson told Rap-Up, [...] "Keri Hilson has a great personality and is a real girl. That’s what <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> across." [...] He also talked about the premise and plot of the video, stating that the video portrays Hilson as a woman who doesn't take herself seriously, commenting, [...] "It’s a really sexy song, but we don’t want to fall into the typical love, love, love R vibe with that... it starts where you think, ‘Oh, it’s about her and being sexy.' She’s in her house and by herself, and you kind of think it could be serious, but the song drops out in the middle and her friends catch her being all sexy, basically like, ‘What the f**k [...] are you doing? You are not singing by yourself.’" [...] In an interview with That Grape Juice, when asked about the video and on the sensuality of the live performances compared to video, Hilson responded, [...] "Yeah. It is a bit of that, but it’s a bit toned down for the video, because you got so much censoring, I can’t do everything I do on stage (laughs). So when people come out they’re probably still gonna be a bit surprised to see it live, after seeing the video. But I’m very pleased with the video. I love the colours and it’s reminiscent of the whole late 70s early 80s era in music." [...] Chris Brown, Omarion, Monica, Melody Thornton, and Polow Da Don all appear in the video. The video begins with Hilson, dressed lavishly, arriving late to a Jeep full of the previous stated people. The clip flips back to what happened earlier that night, showing Hilson getting ready in a seductive fashion, as she chooses perfume and picks out clothes. Scenes of Hilson performing in front of a leather-like wall are interspersed in between her and her friends riding down a boulevard to the club. Once she arrives to the club, she is attracted to a particular man, and subsequently performs elaborate, sensual choreography with him and other dancers, before slow dancing. VIBE said, [...] "Keri Hilson is fine as wine. You know it. We know it. And she knows it. But for the doubters, she proves it once again with this seductive new video from In A Perfect World." [...] A writer for Rap-Up said that Hilson, [...] "takes it nice and slow in the video for 'Slow Dance.'" [...] The video ranked at number 80 on [...] Top 100 Videos of 2009 countdown.|$|E

2500|$|On June 13, 1938, Kennedy {{met with}} Herbert von Dirksen, the German {{ambassador}} to the United Kingdom, in London, who claimed upon his return to Berlin that Kennedy {{had told him that}} [...] "it was not so much the fact that <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> rid of the Jews that was so harmful to us, but rather the loud clamor with which we accompanied this purpose. [...] himself fully understood our Jewish policy." [...] Kennedy's main concern with such violent acts against German Jews as Kristallnacht was that they generated bad publicity in the West for the Nazi regime, a concern that he communicated in a letter to Charles Lindbergh.|$|E

2500|$|Deftones {{began work}} on their fourth album under the working title Lovers. Regarding the album's {{direction}}, Cheng commented, [...] "We've proven that we can musically go in any direction we want, and <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> kind of heavy on this one". Moreno underwent vocal training as a precaution after severely damaging his vocal cords on the band's 2001 summer tour. The band converted their rehearsal space in Sacramento into a fully equipped studio and recorded most of the album there at negligible cost. The band brought in Date to assist with production and also received input on musical arrangement from Greg Wells on several of the album's tracks. The band later added more material at Studio X in Seattle, Washington and at Larrabee Sound Studios. Overall, the album took 12 months and cost roughly $2.5 million to complete. The band was fined by Maverick for missing deadlines.|$|E
2500|$|Game {{director}} Justin Richmond {{explained that}} the game feels more open than other Uncharted games mainly due to the great new character creation feature. [...] "We're not an open-world game, we're {{never going to be}} an open-world game but; we can try. It's still up in the air how much gameplay we're going to let you wander around. But we aim to let you just ride a thousand miles off into the middle of nowhere and still find action and adventure as you go." [...] Ultimately the feel <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> is, yeah, your character is lost in the desert. So it needs to feel like that. We aim to make it feel open-world." [...] In regards to whether or not PlayStation Move would be supported in Uncharted 3, Naughty Dog explained that [...] "A great Move game is a game made around Move and we started Uncharted long before that. It would be very difficult for us to adjust it. We tried a couple of things but it wasn't making a lot of sense." ...|$|E
2500|$|Avatar: The Last Airbender co-creators Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko voiced {{their opinion}} within an {{interview}} regarding Shyamalan writing, directing, and producing the film. The two displayed much enthusiasm over Shyamalan's {{decision for the}} adaptation, stating that they admire his work and, in turn, he respects their material. Producer Frank Marshall explained that they have high hopes to stick to a PG rating. [...] "I'm not even sure <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> in the PG-13 realm. Furthermore, Shyamalan said, [...] "A lot of {{the inspiration for the}} direction we took comes from a friend of mine. A Nathan Blackmer helped shape this Idea into the film it became. I took away {{a little bit of the}} slapsticky stuff that was there for the little little kids, the fart jokes and things like that...We grounded Katara's brother...and that really did wonderful things for the whole theme of the movie." [...] Paramount's president Brad Grey said that despite the director's career being inconsistent, he [...] "believed in [...] vision and that he could execute it," [...] adding that [...] "It's a bold step because he had to create a potential new franchise." [...] The studio was willing to spend $250 million in a trilogy of films, one for each season. The Last Airbenders budget wound up being $150 million, with later over $130 million being spent on marketing costs, making it Shyamalan's most expensive film. During production, the name Avatar was removed from the title to avoid confusion with the highly-successful 2009 film Avatar.|$|E
