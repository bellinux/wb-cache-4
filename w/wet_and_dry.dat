Some researches {{have shown that}} traditional method with continues flooding need tremen- deous amount of water for rice cultivation and gives low water productivity. To increase the water productivity, number of water saving iriga- tion techniques have been studied and applied. Study on effect of number of water irrigation treatments on water productivity of rice was carried out. Eight irrigation treatments were conducted for growing rice in pot experiment i. e. shallow intermittent irrigation (SII), alternate <b>wetting</b> <b>and</b> <b>drying</b> (AWD 1, AWD 2, AWD 3 and AWD 4), shallow water depth with <b>wetting</b> <b>and</b> <b>drying</b> (SWD 1 <b>and</b> SWD 2), and semi-dry cultiva- tion (SDC). The performance of those treat- ments in terms of agronomic and water pa- rameters was compared to the shallow inter- mittent irrigation as a control method. The study reveals that the shallow intermittent irrigation needs the highest amount of water compare with other treatments. The lowest amount of water was achieved under the semi-dry cultivation. It could save water up to 18. 4 % compare to the control treatment. By using the alternate <b>wetting</b> <b>and</b> <b>drying</b> <b>and</b> the shallow water depth with <b>wetting</b> <b>and</b> <b>drying</b> treatments, irrigated water can be reduced up to 13. 1 % and 5. 4 %, respec- tively. The highest grain was obtained by alternate <b>wetting</b> <b>and</b> <b>drying</b> (AWD 4) <b>and</b> the semi-dry cultivation yielded the smalest grain. On average the alternate <b>wetting</b> <b>and</b> <b>drying</b> <b>and</b> shallow water depth with <b>wetting</b> <b>and</b> <b>drying</b> increased the grain yield by 22. 9 % and 17. 9 %, whereas the semi-dry cultivation reduced the yield up to 14 % compare to the shallow water depth treatment. The alternate <b>wetting</b> <b>and</b> <b>drying</b> treatments have significantly improved the water produc- tivity by 41. 6 %, shallow water depth with <b>wetting</b> <b>and</b> <b>drying</b> increased by 24. 2 % relative to the shallow intermittent irrigation treatment, whereas the most saving water treatment i. e. the semi- dry cultivation performed quite similar with the shallow water depth treatment, {{as a result of}} low grain yields under the treatment...|$|R

These ash-modified soils (AMS) are apparently stabilized by hydrated lime produced by biochemical, dissolution, and hydration reactions. The influence of cyclic <b>wetting</b> <b>and</b> <b>drying</b> on the swelling behaviour of wood-ash-modified BCS and laboratory lime-treated BCS specimens are {{examined in this}} study. Such a study is required to assess the long-term behaviour of chemically stabilized soils in geotechnical applications. Cyclic <b>wetting</b> <b>and</b> <b>drying</b> caused the AMS specimens to become more porous and less saturated. Consequently, the cyclically <b>wetted</b> <b>and</b> <b>dried</b> (or desiccated) AMS specimens collapsed significantly at the experimental flooding pressures. The beneficial effects of lime-stabilization of the BCS specimens were also partially lost in cyclically <b>wetting</b> <b>and</b> <b>drying</b> them. The clay contents of the lime-treated BCS specimens increased on cyclic <b>wetting</b> <b>and</b> <b>drying.</b> The increased clay contents in turn, affected their Atterberg limits and swell–shrink potentials. Partial loss of inter-particle cementation, increased porosity, and reduced degree of saturation, also imparted small to moderate collapse potentials to the desiccated lime-treated BCS specimens...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} the results of an experimental investigation into the mechanical behaviour of an expansive soil during <b>wetting</b> <b>and</b> <b>drying</b> cycles. The experimental tests were conducted in a modified oedometer under two different surcharge pressures (10 and 20 kPa). During the tests, the samples were inundated with different types of wetting fluids (distilled water, saline water and acidic water). The volumetric deformation, void ratio and water content of the samples were determined during cycles of <b>wetting</b> <b>and</b> <b>drying.</b> The results show that the swelling potential increases with an increasing number of <b>wetting</b> <b>and</b> <b>drying</b> cycles. The effect of the distilled water on the swelling potential {{is not the same as}} that of the saline water or the acidic water, particularly for different surcharge pressures. The variations in void ratio and water content show that, at the equilibrium condition, the <b>wetting</b> <b>and</b> <b>drying</b> paths converge to nearly an S-shaped curve. This curve consists of a linear portion and two curved portions, and the majority of the deformation is located between the saturation curves of 90 % and 40 %...|$|R

The region has a four-month growing season during which grasses, sedges, and medicinal herbs grow abundantly and support a host of insects, wild and domestic herbivores, larks, and finches. The nearby Kyongnosla Alpine Sanctuary has rare, endangered ground orchida and rhododendrons interspersed among tall junipers and silver firs.|$|E

This suggested a hydrophobic structure formed during drying or plastic expansion of cell lumen due to steaming and soaking in DMSO. Although heat treatments reduced the hygroscopicity of the wood, steamed wood showed more swelling, i. e., lower dimensional stability than unheated and dry-heated wood. This is probably because steaming caused serious degradation of cell wall components, therefore loosening its fiber-reinforced structure restricting the swelling of the cell wall. When wood is exposed to alternate <b>wetting</b> <b>and</b> <b>drying,</b> steaming is not advisable because it may reduce the dimensional stability of the wood...|$|R

An analysis showed that the diet of impala is composed of 45% monocots, 45% dicots and 10% fruits; the proportion of grasses in the diet increases significantly (to as high as 90%) after the first rains, but declines in the dry season. Browsing predominates in the late <b>wet</b> <b>and</b> <b>dry</b> season, and diets are nutritionally poor in the mid-dry season, when impala feed mostly on woody dicots.
