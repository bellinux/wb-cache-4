5|$|B.sessilis var. sessilis is an autonym that {{encompasses}} the type material of the species. This {{is the most}} widespread variety, occurring from Regans Ford and Moora in the north, south-east to Albany, and inland as far as Wongan Hills, Pingelly and Kulin. Its blue-green leaves are cuneate (<b>wedge-shaped)</b> or oblong, and are usually two to three centimetres long but may reach five.|$|E
5|$|Banksia epica is a shrub {{that grows}} {{on the south}} coast of Western Australia. A {{spreading}} bush with <b>wedge-shaped</b> serrated leaves and large creamy-yellow flower spikes, it grows up to 3½metres (11½ft) high. It is known only from two isolated populations in the remote south east of the state, near {{the western edge of}} the Great Australian Bight. Both populations occur among coastal heath on cliff-top dunes of siliceous sand.|$|E
5|$|Most {{species have}} 12 ovules and 36 seeds, {{although}} some {{species such as}} N. bulbocodium have more, up {{to a maximum of}} 60. Seeds take five to six weeks to mature. The seeds of sections Jonquilla and Bulbocodium are <b>wedge-shaped</b> and matte black, while those of other sections are ovate and glossy black. A gust of wind or contact with a passing animal is sufficient to disperse the mature seeds.|$|E
5|$|The {{leaflets}} of {{the plant}} are obovate-oblong, somewhat <b>wedge-shaped,</b> equal-sided, and of a silky texture. The mid-rib is usually folded longitudinally, and they are characterized by parallel transverse veins. The fruits (legumes) are typically one to two inches long (2.5 to 5.1cm) and contain six or seven brownish seeds. The plant displays purple flowers during season; they are described as their most attractive {{in the month of}} January. It typically grows to 45 – 50cm in height, and can grow on mountains with an altitude of over 3000ft. (914 m). Both diploid (22 chromosomes) and tetraploid (44 chromosomes) cytotypes have been reported.|$|E
5|$|The nude {{female figure}} is realistically sculpted in high-relief. Her eyes, beneath distinct, joined eyebrows, are hollow, presumably to accept some {{inlaying}} material– a feature common in stone, alabaster, and bronze sculptures of the time, but {{not seen in}} other Mesopotamian clay sculptures. Her full lips are slightly upturned at the corners. She is adorned with a four-tiered headdress of horns, topped by a disk. Her head is framed by two braids of hair, with the bulk of {{her hair in a}} bun in the back and two <b>wedge-shaped</b> braids extending onto her breasts.|$|E
5|$|The {{sculptured}} mounds {{sometimes have}} elaborate and distinctive forms, {{such as those}} of the compass termite (Amitermes meridionalis and A. laurensis), which builds tall, <b>wedge-shaped</b> mounds with the long axis oriented approximately north–south, which gives them their common name. This orientation has been experimentally shown to assist thermoregulation. The north-south orientation causes the internal temperature of a mound to increase rapidly during the morning while avoiding overheating from the midday sun. The temperature then remains at a plateau {{for the rest of the}} day until the evening.|$|E
5|$|Above the {{mounting}} platform was the stabilization gyro. This {{was connected to}} a <b>wedge-shaped</b> metal plate, causing the plate to rotate around a mounting point {{at the tip of}} the wedge. The rear part of the reflector sight was mounted at this point and the opposite end was supported by a rotating pintle inserted into a gudgeon mounted to the frame. Rolling the aircraft caused the gyro to rotate in the same direction, which was geared to cause the opposite motion in the reflector. As the sights worked by reflecting light off the reflector in the center, motion of the mirror would result in twice the motion of the aim point. To address this, the gyro was attached through levers with a 2-to-1 reduction.|$|E
5|$|Adult non-breeding plumage is {{brownish}} {{with a dark}} {{neck and}} head marked with dark grey-brown. The eyes are surrounded with white, and the eyelids are pale. The bill is mostly pale grey, with a dark culmen and tip, but in early spring the tip may turn whitish. The underparts, lower face, chin, and throat are also whitish. The foreneck is whitish, usually forming <b>wedge-shaped</b> notch in dark neck-sides, and may sometimes reveal a shadowy trace of the neck ring or a pale collar. It has dark brownish grey upperparts with an unclear pattern of squares on the shoulders and some wing coverts spotted with white, which are usually concealed while swimming. The male and the female have similar appearances, although they exhibit sexual dimorphism in their physical dimensions with the male larger and significantly heavier than the female.|$|E
5|$|During 1997, BK revamped its French fries in North America. The {{improved}} fries were {{coated with}} a layer of potato-based starch, giving the fries a crisp shell that maintained its texture longer. The company introduced them in a series of advertisements that claimed the new fries tasted better than McDonald's fries in consumer taste comparisons. Other ads featured Mr. Potato Head in a series of demographically-targeted commercials. The fries were in research and development for over two years and already had been available in several markets when the advertising campaign began. In Europe, BK also sells potato wedges, a type of French fry that is thick-cut and <b>wedge-shaped.</b> In 1991, the company introduced Twister fries, spiral-cut fries with a spicy coating, as part of a promotional push. Part of the product's appeal was they were served in a paper drink cup as opposed to the normal fry carton. The product was designed as a short-term promotion that would be periodically reintroduced.|$|E
5|$|Temnospondyls' {{vertebrae}} {{are divided}} into several segments. In living tetrapods, {{the main body of}} the vertebra is a single piece of bone called the centrum, but in temnospondyls, this region was divided into a pleurocentrum and intercentrum. Two types of vertebrae are recognized in temnospondyls: stereospondylous and rhachitomous vertebrae.'In rhachitomous vertebrae, the intercentra are large and <b>wedge-shaped,</b> and the pleurocentra are relatively small blocks that fit between them.' Both elements support a spine-like neural arch, and well-developed interlocking projections called zygapophyses strengthen the connections between vertebrae. The strong backbone and strong limbs of many ratchitomous temnospondyls allowed them to be partially, and in some cases fully, terrestrial. In stereospondylous vertebrae, the pleurocentra have been lost entirely, with the intercentra enlarged as {{the main body of the}} vertebrae. This weaker type of backbone indicates that stereospondylous temnospondyls spent more time in water.|$|E
5|$|The nasal and premaxillary bones do {{not extend}} back beyond {{the point where}} the lacrimal, frontal, and maxillary bones meet. The {{zygomatic}} plate, the flattened front part of the zygomatic arch, is broad and develops a notch at its front end. The plate's back margin is located before the first upper molar. The jugal bone, part of the zygomatic arch, is reduced, as usual in oryzomyines. The sphenopalatine foramen, a foramen (opening) {{at the side of the}} skull above the molars, is small; it is much larger in the marsh rice rat. The narrowest part of the interorbital region is towards the front and the edges are lined by prominent shelves. The parietal bones extend to the sides of the braincase. The interparietal bone is narrow and <b>wedge-shaped,</b> so that the parietal and squamosal bones meet extensively.|$|E
5|$|The plumage of {{an adult}} bald eagle is evenly dark brown with a white head and tail. The tail is {{moderately}} long and slightly <b>wedge-shaped.</b> Males and females are identical in plumage coloration, but sexual dimorphism {{is evident in the}} species, in that females are 25% larger than males. The beak, feet and irises are bright yellow. The legs are feather-free, and the toes are short and powerful with large talons. The highly developed talon of the hind toe is used to pierce the vital areas of prey while it is held immobile by the front toes. The beak is large and hooked, with a yellow cere. The adult bald eagle is unmistakable in its native range. The closely related African fish eagle (H. vocifer) (from far outside the bald eagle's range) also has a brown body, white head and tail, but differs from the bald in having a white chest and black tip to the bill.|$|E
5|$|The stouter {{build and}} more bent {{shape of the}} {{mandible}} shows that the Rodrigues starling used greater force than the hoopoe starling when searching and perhaps digging for food. It probably also {{had the ability to}} remove objects and forcefully open entrances when searching for food; it did this by inserting its <b>wedge-shaped</b> bill and opening its mandibles, as other starlings and crows do. This ability supports Tafforet's claim that the bird fed on eggs and dead tortoises. It could have torn dead, presumably juvenile, turtles and tortoises out of their shells. Tafforet did not see any Rodrigues starlings on the mainland, but he stated that they could easily be reared by feeding them meat, which indicates that he brought young birds from a breeding population on Île Gombrani. Tafforet was marooned on Rodrigues during the summer and was apparently able to procure juvenile individuals; some other Rodrigues birds are known to breed at this time, so {{it is likely that the}} starling did the same.|$|E
5|$|All Galilean moons have thin atmospheres with surface {{pressures}} {{in the range}} 0.01–1nbar, which in turn support substantial ionospheres with electron densities {{in the range of}} 1,000–10,000cm−3. The co-rotational flow of cold magnetospheric plasma is partially diverted around them by the currents induced in their ionospheres, creating <b>wedge-shaped</b> structures known as Alfvén wings. The interaction of the large moons with the co-rotational flow is similar to the interaction of the solar wind with the non-magnetized planets like Venus, although the co-rotational speed is usually subsonic (the speeds vary from 74 to 328km/s), which prevents the formation of a bow shock. The pressure from the co-rotating plasma continuously strips gases from the moons' atmospheres (especially from that of Io), and some of these atoms are ionized and brought into co-rotation. This process creates gas and plasma tori in the vicinity of moons' orbits with the Ionian torus being the most prominent. In effect, the Galilean moons (mainly Io) serve as the principal plasma sources in Jupiter's inner and middle magnetosphere. Meanwhile, the energetic particles are largely unaffected by the Alfvén wings and have free access to the moons' surfaces (except Ganymede's).|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from its}} greater size, the common raven differs from its cousins, the crows, {{by having a}} larger and heavier black beak, shaggy {{feathers}} around the throat and above the beak, and a <b>wedge-shaped</b> tail. Flying ravens are distinguished from crows by their tail shape, larger wing area, and more stable soaring style, which generally involves less wing flapping. Despite their bulk, ravens are easily as agile in flight as their smaller cousins. In flight the feathers produce a creaking sound that has been likened to the rustle of silk. The voice of ravens is also quite distinct, its usual call being a deep croak of a much more sonorous quality than a crow's call. In North America, the Chihuahuan raven (C. cryptoleucus) is fairly similar to the relatively small common ravens of the American southwest and is best distinguished by the still relatively smaller size of its bill, beard and body and relatively longer tail. All-black carrion crow (C. corone) in Europe may suggest a raven due to their largish bill but are still distinctly smaller and have the wing and tail shapes typical of crows.|$|E
5|$|In the Roman Catholic Church, {{the most}} {{important}} steps towards an expressionist design were under taken by Gillespie, Kidd & Coia. This began with St Paul's Church in the new town of Glenrothes (1956–57). This was a <b>wedge-shaped</b> construction of white-painted common brick focused on a dramatic, jagged metal cross by the sculptor Benno Schotz. From about 1960, all Gillespie, Kidd & Coia's churches were designed in this Late Modernist style, as at St Bride's, East Kilbride (1963–64), which had a rectangular plan. From the mid-1960s, they adopted a centralised, non-rectangular plan, with seating ranged round the altar, reflecting liturgical change. Sacred Heart Church, Cumbernauld (1964), was rectangular, of load-bearing brick, dramatically lit through dark coloured windows. Our Lady of Good Counsel, Dennistoun (1965) had a splayed plan and slanted ceiling. St Benedict Drumchapel (1965–67) had a prow-like roof on curved, laminated timbers. These innovative designs inspired others to experiment, including J. McCarron's Our Lady of Sorrows, South Uist (1964–65). However, many of these designs proved too radical and were later demolished by the Catholic Church, citing structural or maintenance problems.|$|E
5|$|In the skull, the rostrum (front part) is {{long and}} robust. The nasal bones are short, not {{extending}} further back than the lacrimals, and the premaxillaries extend about {{as far back as}} the nasals. The zygomatic notch, an extension at the front of the zygomatic plate, is present. The plate's back margin is level with the front of the first upper molar. A strong jugal bone is present in the zygomatic arch (cheekbone), so that the maxillary and squamosal bones, which form the front and back parts of the arch, respectively, do not overlap when seen from the side. The narrowest part of the interorbital region (located between the eyes) is to the front and the region's margins exhibit strong beading. Various crests develop on the rounded braincase, especially in old animals. The parietal bones form part of the roof of the braincase and, unlike in some other rice rats, also extend to the sides of the braincase. The interparietal bone at the back of the braincase is narrow and <b>wedge-shaped,</b> so that the parietal and occipital bones meet extensively.|$|E
5|$|On 16 July, Persano {{took the}} Italian fleet out of Ancona and steamed {{to the island}} of Lissa, where they arrived on the 18th. With the main fleet of twelve ironclads, they brought troop {{transports}} carrying 3,000 soldiers. Persano then {{spent the next two}} days bombarding the Austrian defenses of the island and unsuccessfully attempting to force a landing. Tegetthoff received a series of telegrams between the 17 and 19 July notifying him of the Italian attack, which he initially believed to be a feint to draw the Austrian fleet away from its main bases at Pola and Venice. By the morning of the 19th, however, he was convinced that Lissa was in fact the Italian objective, and so he requested permission to attack. As Tegetthoff's fleet arrived off Lissa on the morning of 20 July, Persano's fleet was arrayed for another landing attempt. The latter's ships were divided into three groups, with only the first two able to concentrate in time to meet the Austrians. Tegetthoff had arranged his ironclad ships into a <b>wedge-shaped</b> formation, with Drache on his right flank; the wooden warships of the second and third divisions followed behind in the same formation.|$|E
5|$|The Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus), {{also called}} the white {{scavenger}} vulture or pharaoh's chicken, is a small Old World vulture and {{the only member of}} the genus Neophron. It is widely distributed; the Egyptian vulture is found from southwestern Europe and northern Africa to India. The contrasting underwing pattern and <b>wedge-shaped</b> tail make it distinctive in flight as it soars in thermals during the warmer parts of the day. Egyptian vultures feed mainly on carrion but are opportunistic and will prey on small mammals, birds, and reptiles. They also feed on the eggs of other birds, breaking larger ones by tossing a large pebble onto them. The use of tools is rare in birds and apart from the use of a pebble as a hammer, Egyptian vultures also use twigs to roll up wool for use in their nest. Egyptian vultures that breed in the temperate regions migrate south in winter while tropical populations are relatively sedentary. Populations of this species have declined in the 20th century and some island populations are endangered by hunting, accidental poisoning, and collision with power lines.|$|E
5|$|The diplosegments of millipedes {{have evolved}} in {{conjunction}} with their burrowing habits, and nearly all millipedes adopt a mainly subterranean lifestyle. They use three main methods of burrowing; bulldozing, wedging and boring. Members of the orders Julida, Spirobolida and Spirostreptida, lower their heads and barge {{their way into the}} substrate, the collum being the portion of their exoskeleton that leads the way. Flat-backed millipedes in the order Polydesmida tend to insert their front end, like a wedge, into a horizontal crevice, and then widen the crack by pushing upwards with their legs, the paranota in this instance constituting the main lifting surface. Boring is used by members of the order Polyzoniida. These have smaller segments at the front and increasingly large ones further back; they propel themselves forward into a crack with their legs, the <b>wedge-shaped</b> body widening the gap as they go. Some millipedes have adopted an above-ground lifestyle and lost the burrowing habit. This may be because they are too small to have enough leverage to burrow, or because they are too large to make the effort worthwhile, or in some cases because they move relatively fast (for a millipede) and are active predators.|$|E
5|$|The {{directors}} were unanimous {{that a change}} should be made, and a special meeting of the shareholders was held on 26 April 1932. The move to Bootham Crescent on a 21-year lease was approved by 115votes to 37. The site of York's new home was of an irregular shape and was hemmed in from four sides, with a narrow track to the south, barracks to the west, a school and almhouses {{to the north and}} terraced houses to the east. Nonetheless, the grounds of the city's football, cricket and rugby league teams were now within a few hundred yards of each other. The ground was renovated over the summer of 1932; the area was drained and then built to the design of local architects Ward & Leckenby. The Popular Stand was erected on the west side using sections of the terrace cover at Fulfordgate, with the Main Stand built opposite. Terraces were banked up in the <b>wedge-shaped</b> areas behind the goals. After four months of construction, Bootham Crescent was ready for the 1932–33 season, with an initial capacity of over 30,000.|$|E
5|$|The pelagic {{stingray}} {{has a very}} thick, distinctively <b>wedge-shaped</b> pectoral fin disc one-third wider than long, with broadly curved leading margins, rather angular outer corners, and nearly straight trailing margins. The snout is short with a rounded tip. The eyes are minute and, unlike in other stingrays, do not protrude above the body; the spiracles (paired respiratory openings) follow immediate behind. There is a short but broad curtain of skin between the nostrils, with a weakly fringed rear margin. The mouth is small and gently arched, with deep furrows at the corners and a tiny projection {{at the center of}} the upper jaw that fits into an indentation on the lower jaw. There are anywhere from 0 to 15 forked papillae (nipple-like structures) in a row across the floor of the mouth. There are 2534 upper tooth rows and 2531 lower tooth rows; the teeth of both sexes have single, pointed cusps, but those of adult males are longer and sharper than those of adult females. The margins of the pelvic fins are nearly straight in front and become rounded at the tips and in back.|$|E
5|$|The {{skin of a}} {{tiger shark}} can {{typically}} range from blue to light green with a white or light-yellow underbelly. The advantage {{of this is that}} when it is hunting for its prey, when prey looks at the shark from above, the shark will be camouflaged since the water below is darker. And when prey is below the shark and looks up, of course because of the sun, it is lighter so that the light underbelly will also camouflage the shark. This is known as countershading. Dark spots and stripes are most visible in young sharks and fade as the shark matures. Its head is somewhat <b>wedge-shaped,</b> which makes it easy to turn quickly to one side. They have small pits on the snout which hold electroreceptors called the ampullae of Lorenzini, which enable them to detect electric fields, including the weak electrical impulses generated by prey, which helps them to hunt. Tiger sharks also have a sensory organ called a lateral line which extends on their flanks down most of the length of their sides. The primary role of this structure is to detect minute vibrations in the water. These adaptations allow the tiger shark to hunt in darkness and detect hidden prey.|$|E
5|$|The tornado {{continued}} northeast, becoming {{large and}} <b>wedge-shaped.</b> It then passed {{just north of}} Fairview, completely destroying multiple homes and debarking numerous hardwood trees. Pieces of debris were found speared through vehicles in this area. The tornado then briefly passed through a section of Morgan County {{near the town of}} Hulaco, destroying several older block-foundation homes and snapping numerous large trees off at the base. The tornado then crossed into Marshall County and impacted the rural community of Ruth, just north of Arab. A large but poorly-anchored brick home was swept completely away in this area, with the debris scattered 100 yards from the foundation. Several large trees on the property were ripped out of the ground and missing, along with a trailer that was unable to be located {{at the time of the}} survey. Multiple other homes and structures were impacted in the Ruth area, and a gas station was completely destroyed. A shed was destroyed with pieces of large farm machinery stored inside thrown up to 20 yards away, a storage trailer was tossed 100 yards and found impaled by multiple planks of wood, and concrete power poles in the area were bent over. Arab's power grid was completely crippled by the tornado's effects, and many roads in the area were obstructed by downed trees and power lines. The tornado damaged and destroyed several other homes, garages, and sheds north of Union Grove before it crossed the Tennessee River, snapping numerous trees in a forested area before dissipating.|$|E

25|$|In most {{marine mussels}} the shell {{is longer than}} it is wide, being <b>wedge-shaped</b> or asymmetrical. The {{external}} colour of the shell is often dark blue, blackish, or brown, while the interior is silvery and somewhat nacreous.|$|E
25|$|The {{township}} {{is broken}} into two non-contiguous sections, {{with a small}} <b>wedge-shaped</b> exclave on the township's southwest corner separated {{from the rest of}} the township by a portion of Matawan on the opposite side of Route 79.|$|E
25|$|The {{bones that}} form cranial {{ornamentation}} have physiological costs, {{and so would}} be inefficient to produce merely for protection against predation.
