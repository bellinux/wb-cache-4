25|$|Due to the {{limitations}} of plaster of Paris, surgeons have also experimented {{with other types of}} materials for use as splints. An early plastic like material was gutta-percha obtained from the latex of trees found in Malaya. It resembled rubber, but contained more resins. When dry it <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>and</b> inelastic, but when warmed it became soft and malleable. In 1851 Utterhoeven, described the use of splints made from this material for the treatment of fractures. In the 1970s, the development of fibreglass casting tape made it possible to produce a cast that was lighter and more durable than the traditional plaster cast and also resistant to water (although the bandages underneath were not) allowing the patient to be more active.|$|E
25|$|On 3 August, an 80-wagon {{supply convoy}} arrived at Elands River from Zeerust, {{where they were}} to wait for their escort, a column of 1,000 men from the New South Wales Imperial Bushmen along with some South African irregulars {{commanded}} by General Frederick Carrington to arrive from Mafeking. Desperate for supplies, Boer forces decided to attack the garrison with the view to securing the supplies located there. Prior to the battle commencing, the garrison had received intelligence warning them of the attack. As a result, some actions were taken to fortify the position, with a makeshift defensive perimeter being established utilising stores and wagons to create barricades. Little attempt had been made, however, to dig-in as the ground around the position <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>and</b> {{there was a lack}} of digging equipment amongst the garrison.|$|E

25|$|Reginald John Howard {{was born}} on 8 December 1912 to Jack and Ethel Howard, who lived in London's West End. The eldest of nine children, Howard's family {{background}} was working class. His father worked as a barrelmaker for a brewery after serving in the trenches in France during the First World War, while his mother kept the house and looked after the children. During his formative years, Howard was {{active member of the}} Boy Scouts, he also enjoyed attending school and did very well, earning a scholarship to attend secondary school. However, the economic situation at the time <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>and</b> at the age of fourteen he began full-time work, working as a clerk at a broker's firm. In order to further his education he took evening classes and continued with the Scouts. In 1931, however, he found himself out of work, after the brokerage firm that he was working for went out of business.|$|E

500|$|The gum {{varied in}} color {{depending}} {{on the condition of}} the original tree. It also depended on where the gum had formed and how long it had been buried. Colors ranged from chalky-white, through red-brown to black; the most prized was a pale gold, as it <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>and</b> translucent. The size of each lump also varied greatly. Swamps tended to yield the small nuggets known as [...] "chips", whereas the hillsides tended to produce larger lumps. The majority were the size of acorns, although some were found which weighed a few pounds; the largest (and rarest) were reported to weigh half a hundredweight. Kauri gum shares a few characteristics with amber, another fossilised resin found in the Northern Hemisphere, but where amber can be dated as millions of years old, carbon-dating suggests the age of most kauri gum is a few thousand years.|$|E

500|$|Mountfort {{arrived in}} Canterbury full of {{ambition}} {{and drive to}} begin designing in 1850 {{as one of a}} wave of settlers encouraged to immigrate to the new colony of New Zealand by the British Government. With him and his wife from England came also his brother Charles, his sister Susannah, and Charles' wife, all five of them aged between 21 and 26. Life in New Zealand at first <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>and</b> disappointing: Mountfort found that there was little call for architects. Christchurch {{was little more than a}} large village of basic wooden huts on a windswept plain. The new émigré's architectural life in New Zealand had a disastrous beginning. His first commission in New Zealand was the Church of the Most Holy Trinity in Lyttelton, built in 1852 by Isaac Luck. The building proved vulnerable to high winds and was considered unsafe. It was demolished in 1857. [...] This calamity was attributed to the use of unseasoned wood and his lack of knowledge of the local building materials. Whatever the cause, the result was a crushing blow to his reputation. A local newspaper called him [...] "...a half-educated architect whose buildings... have given anything but satisfaction, he being evidently deficient in all knowledge of the principles of construction, though a clever draughtsman and a man of some taste.".|$|E

Seafaring skills would ease the difficulty of pirate life and provided occupational advancement whilst on board.|$|E

Benzon had briefly been the Croatian ambassador to Germany during World War II and had known [...] Hitler personally, which benefited Croatian-German relations. Thanks to Benzon's friendship with Evita Perón, Pavelić became the owner of an influential building company. Not long after arriving he joined the Ustaše-related [...] "Croatian Home Guard" [...] (...) organization.|$|E

Grohl admired Norton from his work with the Pixies {{and how he was}} able to [...] "distil a coherent pop song out of all their multi-layered weirdness." [...] Norton was very demanding of the band's performance, eventually leading bassist Nate Mendel to enhance his musical formation.

2500|$|While Derbyshire lead made Gell {{and others}} rich, for poor {{families}} {{it was both}} a living and an adventure, {{with the possibility of}} a better life from a lucky find. The industry was organised in a way that gave a measure of independence to many of them. Mining <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>and</b> dangerous work: death, illness and injury came from poisonous lead dust, underground floods, falling rock, methane gas in shale workings and lack of oxygen in badly ventilated galleries. [...] From the later years of the 17th century gunpowder introduced a further hazard. Nonetheless the thousands of shafts, hillocks and ruined buildings in the limestone landscape of the old lead mining areas, and the miles of galleries underground, make it plain that the veins of lead were intensively exploited. In the words of a petition to King Charles I [...] "many thousand people are dailie imployed in the lead mynes, to the greatt proffitt of your Majestie ... and to the whole Comonwealth ... in getting greatt quantities of lead {{for the use of the}} Kingdome in generall, and in transporting the rest to forraigne Nations...".|$|E

2500|$|While in Belgrade, Kočić met {{the writer}} Janko Veselinović, whose popular {{short stories and}} novels romanticized Serbian peasant life. Kočić shared several of his poems with Veselinović. The latter {{recommended}} that he focus on prose instead. Kočić's time in Belgrade was marked by dire poverty. [...] "Although Serbian," [...] he wrote, the city was [...] "a foreign world". His behaviour became extremely volatile, as seen in a letter he wrote his childhood friend and future wife Milka Vukmanović, threatening to kill her and then himself if she married another. Letters to his father, pressing for money, also struck an abusive and manipulative tone. The thought of committing suicide began to appear more frequently in his notes. [...] "I will kill myself," [...] he wrote, [...] "to put an end {{once and for all}} to all the sufferings and torments that have pursued me from my birth. My life in Banja Luka <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>and</b> dark, in Sarajevo still worse, and in Belgrade it reached the very climax of suffering." [...] The historian Robin Okey describes such passages as [...] "a reminder of the stresses on young students in this first transition from patriarchalism, particularly without funding, when illness and hunger were recurrent." ...|$|E
2500|$|Yahalom (יָהֳלֹם = in the masoretic text) / Onychion (in the Septuagint) - in {{some other}} places the Septuagint instead has Beryllios where the masoretic reads Yahalom. The word Yahalom appears to be {{connected}} with the Hebrew meaning strike hard, and possibly with the word hallamish meaning flint; hallamish {{is connected to the}} Assyrian word elmeshu, referring to a precious stone which <b>was</b> <b>hard,</b> <b>and</b> possibly white, or at least with an insignificant colour, and from which whole rings were sometimes made. A few scholars have suggested that Yahalom may refer to diamonds, owing to their hardness, though the skill of cutting diamonds had not been discovered before the classical era. Although the Septuagint's Onychion is the Greek term for Onyx, Onyx was not mined prior to the era of classical Greece. Onyx is derived from the Greek for fingernail, due to the pink-white veining. In the Syriac Peshitta of the sixth or seventh century (MS. B.21, Inferiore of the Ambrosian Library in Milan, Italy), the word used to describe this stone is ܢܩܥܬܐ = naq'atha, a word which is sometimes transliterated into Arabic as it is pronounced in Aramaic, mainly by Arabic-speaking Christians. Bar-Ali, a 9th-century Arab author, brings down two opinions about this stone, the naq'atha, saying, by one opinion, that it is [...] "honey-coloured," [...] and by the other opinion that it is [...] "turquoise, a blue-coloured stone." [...] In some versions of the Peshitta, the Aramaic word rendered for the same stone is shabzez, translated as [...] "diamond." [...] This may account for today's understanding of this word, although in ancient times yahalom may have meant something else. Of the well-known honey-coloured gemstones, we find Citrene and Hessonite garnet (both, from Sri Lanka), while in Africa (Tanzania) we find Imperial Zircon, a honey-coloured stone with an extreme brilliance. Spanish Jewish scholar, Abraham ibn Ezra says the yahalom was a white stone.|$|E
