2500|$|The song's message {{recalls that}} of Dylan's September 1965 single [...] "Positively 4th Street", as Harrison {{appears to be}} ending a relationship, {{possibly}} with a lover. The lyrics adopt an accusatory stance from the opening line: [...] "I've got {{a word or two}} to say about the things that you do." [...] Author Ian Inglis describes the song as [...] "a withering attack" [...] in which [...] "Harrison's blunt 'I left you far behind' and Dylan's curt 'It's not my problem' [...] could be spoken by the same voice." [...] Harrison also incorporates Dylan-esque surrealism in his reference to [...] "opaque" [...] minds and in the line [...] "the good things that we can have if <b>we</b> <b>close</b> our eyes".|$|E
2500|$|Betty Riess, a {{spokeswoman}} for Bank of America, told MintPress News via email, [...] "We do not close accounts {{on the basis of}} nationality, nor do <b>we</b> <b>close</b> accounts without notice to customers." [...] However, account holders believe there could be a relationship between this action and their national origin. Although most account holders say they did not receive any notification prior their accounts being frozen, Bank of America insists that they do not freeze any account without prior notification. When it was reported that Bank of America was closing the accounts of Iranians living in the U.S. and Iranian-Americans, there was speculation that the bank did so on the basis of discriminatory ideology, since Bank of America did not give these individuals any reason why their accounts were being closed. The bank responded to these accusations, arguing that it was only following the rules put forth by the U.S. federal government regarding economic relations between the U.S. and Iran.|$|E

2500|$|We {{are writing}} {{to express our}} {{profound}} concern over the prospect that the Czech Republic may be planning to legalize prostitution ... We believe that such action {{would be a terrible}} mistake for {{the country as a whole}} and, in particular, for the women and children of the Eastern Europe region who will be victims of the Czech Republic sex trade ... We are certain that legalizing prostitution within the Czech Republic will not curb abuses such as child prostitution and enslaving sex trafficking. Organized crime controls the [...] "industry" [...] and, in a legalized regime, it will have an enhanced capacity to do so ... Brothels are sexual gulags for women and girls ... A decision to accommodate traffickers, pimps, and organized crime's slave trade in girls and women [...] an act unworthy of Czechs' traditions of fighting for their own freedom. It is an act we will resist with every democratic means available to us, and will fight in Congress and our legislatures, through our organized women's movements and from tens of thousands of church and synagogue pulpits. At a minimum, we are determined that our efforts will in financial terms alone, be more costly to the Republic — and not in terms of tourism alone — than any hypothetical financial gains claimed. <b>We</b> <b>close</b> by urging you to reject the calls for legalization that sully the reputation of the Czech Republic and dishonor its history. Please take a leadership role in resisting the trade in women and children and please, in a manner consistent with your traditions, maintain the Republic as a model for human rights and democracy.|$|E

60|$|My Lords,--Your Lordships will {{recollect}} that <b>we</b> <b>closed</b> {{the last}} day of your proceeding in this trial at a most interesting part of our charge, or rather of our observations upon that charge. <b>We</b> <b>closed</b> at that awful moment when we found the first women of Oude pillaged of all their landed and of all their moneyed property, in short, of all they possessed. <b>We</b> <b>closed</b> by reciting to you the false pretence on which this pillage was defended, namely, that it was the work of the Nabob. Now we had before proved to you, from evidence adduced by the prisoner himself, that this Nabob was a mere tool in his hands; and therefore, if this pretence be true, it aggravates his guilt: for surely the forcing a son to violate the property of his mother must everywhere be considered a crime most portentous and enormous. At this point we closed; and after the detail which has been given you already of these horrible and iniquitous proceedings, some apology may perhaps be necessary for entering again into the refutation of this iniquitous pretence.|$|R
