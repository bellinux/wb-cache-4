Some show the beast trotting like a horse with a horn; others hunched over with head to the ground, like a bison, and still others immersed in swamps like a hippopotamus. The use of the horn and <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> one, and how large, have been popular topics. The statistical correlations of modern palaeontology have taken much of the speculation out of the subject, although some details remain undetermined.|$|E

2500|$|The initial {{motion for}} {{building}} a metropolitan railway system in Helsinki was made in September 1955, though during the five decades beforehand, {{the idea of a}} tunneled urban railway for Helsinki had surfaced several times. A suburban traffic committee (...) was formed under the leadership of Reino Castrén, and in late 1955, the committee set to work on the issue of <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> truly a need for a tunneled public transport system in Helsinki. After nearly four years of work, the committee presented its findings to the city council. The findings of the committee were clear: Helsinki needed a metro system built on separate right-of-way. This {{was the first time the}} term [...] "metro" [...] was used to describe the planned system. At the time the committee did not yet elaborate on what kind of vehicles should be used on the metro: trams, heavier rail vehicles, buses or trolleybuses were all alternatives. The city council's reaction to the committee's presentation was largely apathetic, with several council members stating to the press that they did not understand anything about Castrén's presentation.|$|E

Since all Hansen had to go on was the word of David Stanley and his mother, he could not have known for sure if there really had been money in the envelope. In fact, Hansen never {{actually}} mentioned money when he produced the envelopes, only asking <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> any correspondence between the AD's office and the Stanley family. By refusing to acknowledge that he had, in fact, sent something to Stanley's family and then backtracking when confronted with evidence that contradicted his statement, Hansen knew Parker was hiding something. Hansen also admitted that Parker could've just lied about the contents of the envelopes and his investigation would've been stopped cold. As Hansen said years after the incident, [...] "That was the defining moment. All (Parker) had to say was, 'I'm glad you asked, I sent him an insurance form,' and we would've had to start all over, because every dot that we connected started from the premise that we know he sent something." ...|$|E

In a statement on her website, she wrote: [...] "It is with great sadness I {{have to tell you that}} Brad has decided to kill off the character Taylor. He feels the character is too good and has too much integrity to take her down other pathsin a word, played out." [...] The actress confessed that she was unhappy with her character's direction at the time of her exit, saying: [...] "I really felt like Taylor had lost the wind from her sails and was going nowhere." [...] Tylo said that [...] "It just seemed like everything had to do with <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a woman after her husband" [...] and that she was [...] "done with it", revealing that her unhappiness with the writing began when the character of Morgan appeared on the show. Furthermore, both Tylo and Bell agreed that Taylor was at a [...] "brick wall", but Bell was [...] "afraid to go beyond that" [...] and have the character go [...] "off the deep end", in fear of destroying her integrity. However, Tylo believed that [...] "in reality that's what she needed – to be more human. But she just got boring instead". Taylor is gunned down by Sheila Carter (Kimberlin Brown) and appears to die in hospital a few days later due to her injuries. Tylo eventually returned to the soap, with Taylor revealed to be alive in 2005.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the legal}} {{developments}} in the UK, the test for apparent bias in Singapore was extensively reconsidered by the High Court in the 2005 case Tang Kin Hwa v. Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners Board. On {{the facts of the}} case, it was unnecessary for Judicial Commissioner Andrew Phang to have decided definitively whether the correct test was the reasonable suspicion or the real likelihood test. Nonetheless, he expressed the obiter view that the [...] "reasonable suspicion of bias" [...] test established in Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin and Tang Liang Hong was not significantly different from the English [...] "real likelihood of bias" [...] test (also known as [...] "real possibility of bias" [...] test). According to him, [...] "he common substance of both tests appears, in a nutshell, to be this: The key question is <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a perception {{on the part of a}} reasonable person that there would be a real likelihood of bias". The concept of [...] "likelihood" [...] entails [...] "possibility" [...] and not [...] "probability". Phang opined that this is simply another way of stating that there is a [...] "reasonable suspicion" [...] on the part of the person concerned, meaning that although the concept of [...] "reasonable suspicion" [...] is supposed to be of a less stringent standard, this standard is reflected in the concept of [...] "possibility" [...] and thus there is essentially no substantial difference in the two tests. In addition, the word real in the term real likelihood of bias cannot mean [...] "actual", as the test after all pertains to apparent bias and not actual bias.|$|E

2500|$|There is however some {{evidence}} that does point to the possible appearance of guns in Andalusia {{as early as the}} 1330s. Thomas Allsen says that [...] "in the Latin West the first uncontestable evidence of firearms is from 1326, surprisingly somewhat earlier than in the lands that lie between China ... and western Europe. This has caused some doubt among historians on the gun transmission theory, and even <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a transmission at all. One dissident opinion comes from Stephen Morillo, Jeremy Black, and Paul Lococo's War in World History which argues that [...] "the sources are not entirely clear about Chinese use of gunpowder in guns. There are references to bamboo and iron cannons, or perhaps proto-cannons, but these seem to have been small, unreliable, handheld weapons in this period. The Chinese do seem to have invented guns independently of the Europeans, at least in principle; but, in terms of effective cannon, the edge goes to Europe." [...] There is another independent invention theory supporting an Islamic origin of the gun, citing the Mamluk deployment of hand cannons in 1260 and a passage by Ibn Khaldun on the Marinid Siege of Sijilmassa in 1274: [...] " [...] installed siege engines … and gunpowder engines …, which project small balls of iron. These balls are ejected from a chamber … placed in front of a kindling fire of gunpowder; this happens by a strange property which attributes all actions {{to the power of the}} Creator." [...] This passage and its interpretation has been rejected as anachronistic by most historians, who urge caution regarding claims of Islamic firearms use in the 1204-1324 period as late medieval Arabic texts used the same word for gunpowder, naft, as they did for an earlier incendiary, naphtha.|$|E
