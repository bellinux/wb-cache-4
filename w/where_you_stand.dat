2500|$|In 2014, the Chick tract Unforgiven was {{distributed}} by Bible Baptist Church in Garden City, Roanoke, Virginia and drew outrage from the area's Muslim community. The tract {{tells the story}} of an African-American man who, while in prison, is coerced into joining the Islamic faith and changes his name to Muhammad. [...] Upon his release he threatens his Christian grandmother. Hussain Al-Shiblawi, a local man, told WDBJ-TV that he gets pamphlets from the church every Sunday and that they are typically inspirational, but that this one was different. “It basically indicated that the people are violent, the religion itself is violent, and the facts in here are not true,” he said. “It shows him trying to kill his mother saying, ‘If you weren’t my grandma, I’d kill you <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>stand,</b> Allahu Akbar.’” In one scene, the grandmother begs Lamont to return to the Christian faith, telling him he’ll “die in [...] sins” and be unforgiven by God if he doesn’t. But the young man isn’t swayed by her pleas. “I choose Muhammad! And I hate your Jesus, your Bible and you!,” he screams. “Get out of my house you infidel!” Bible Baptist Church said the church did not write the tract and simply distributed it.|$|E
