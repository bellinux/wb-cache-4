500|$|In an {{interview}} with the Boston Herald, Sargent called Revenge [...] "a ticking bomb waiting to go off. ... Sid Sheinberg (president of MCA Inc., parent company of Universal Pictures) expects a miracle – and we're going to make it happen." [...] Sargent got a call from Sheinberg in late September 1986, asking him to direct the fourth Jaws movie with no script yet written. Said Sargent, [...] "I didn't have time to laugh because Sid explained he wanted to do a quality picture about human beings. When he told me, 'It's your baby, you produce and direct,' I accepted." [...] According to Sargent, Sheinberg [...] "cut through all the slow lanes and got Jaws: The Revenge off and running." [...] In a 2006 interview, Sargent stated that the premise was born [...] "out of a little bit of desperation to find something fresh to do with the shark. We thought that maybe if we take a mystical point of view, and go for a little bit of...magic, <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> find something interesting enough to sit through." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ferris {{speculates that}} {{there is at least}} one, if not several, Black Holes in the middle of our own Milky Way galaxy. Visible light is unable to reach our telescopes {{from the center of the}} galaxy, so higher radio ways are used for [...] "viewing." [...] He {{suggests}} that by searching for Bekenstein-Hawking radiation then <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> find these Black Holes.|$|E
2500|$|The {{size of the}} American {{military}} presence after 2014 will help determine {{the size of the}} American civilian footprint. As of December 2012 the United States are reducing its plans for large civilian force in post-2014 Afghanistan, because the U.S. military is certain to curtail or stop the security and other services it provides U.S. government civilians in Afghanistan. Firm decisions on civilian numbers and locations cannot be made [...] "until we resolve exactly what the military follow-on numbers are going to be," [...] one unnamed U.S. official said. [...] "That will determine [...] . . where we locate, what kind of security, medical and other support <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> get." [...] According to the New York Times the U.S. military wants to retain 9,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan, while the Obama administration wants a force of 3,000 to 9,000 troops in Afghanistan after 2014.|$|E

50|$|Something can be {{meaningful}} although we cannot name it, or <b>we</b> <b>might</b> only <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to name it and nothing else.|$|R

2500|$|The Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai met Nasser at the 1955 Bandung Conference and was {{impressed}} by him. Zhou recommended that Khrushchev treat Nasser as a potential ally. Zhou described Nasser to Khrushchev as a young nationalist, who though no Communist, could if used correctly do much damage to Western interests in the Middle East. Marshal Josip Broz Tito of Yugoslavia, who also come to know Nasser at Bandung told Khrushchev in a 1955 meeting that [...] "Nasser {{was a young man}} without much political experience, but if we give him the benefit of the doubt, <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> exert a beneficial influence on him, both {{for the sake of the}} Communist movement, and ... the Egyptian people". Traditionally, most of the equipment in the Egyptian military had come from Britain, but Nasser's desire to break British influence in Egypt meant that he was desperate to find a new source of weapons to replace Britain. Nasser had first broached the subject of buying weapons from the Soviet Union in 1954.|$|E

[...] meaning [...] "Are you (all) amongst the ones whom <b>we</b> <b>might</b> not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to make citizens of Afyonkarahisar?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What I {{thought was}} this: the brig is just our own size and, {{if we should}} get {{becalmed}} anywhere near the shore, and a boat put off, <b>we</b> <b>might</b> possibly <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to pass, with her papers." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not much farther," [...] I said. [...] "I am {{sure there}} is firm ground beneath us, {{but it will not}} do to move. If we should fall down, <b>we</b> <b>might</b> not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to get up again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How big was {{the cellar}} originally? Was it larger than this? Are there other rooms {{filled up with}} debris? <b>We</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> open one of them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{might be}} a good thing, if it did," [...] {{answered}} Dick. [...] "It might save it from being wrecked, and <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> tow it ashore." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{if there}} is no one in front, uncle, I should think <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> keep ahead. Our horses are as good as they are likely to have." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] he continued, [...] "I {{was very}} much {{disappointed}} to hear this, because I had hoped that <b>we</b> <b>might</b> have <b>been</b> <b>able</b> to let Grantham House to you. We cannot consider the matter at all now unless you pay for everything in advance." ...|$|R
3000|$|... …we are {{currently}} informally allowed to collect some products like dried firewood, mushrooms, fruits, and wild vegetable from IFR. However, due {{to changes in}} management regime made to the forest, <b>we</b> <b>might</b> not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to access the forest in future; the government should consider our livelihoods [...]...|$|R
60|$|With whoops {{and yells}} they rose up close under {{the walls of}} the cabin, where <b>we</b> <b>might</b> not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to draw bead upon them, and at the same instant a volley of rifle shots rang out as three bullets came inside between the crevices of the logs.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, but now I want to hunt them. Can {{you give}} me any help? Those oxen are tired out and footsore, so <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> catch them up." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In sections, sir," [...] replied Fitz, grinning. [...] "Half a page {{at a time}} is all we can manage, but <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> match margins so {{the thing}} could be read." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wish {{we could}} get Viola and her mother here. Would they come to dinner if I should ask them? If we could get them here once <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> persuade them to stay." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is it, Mr. Farmer. It {{is quite}} evident {{to us that}} we must be {{extremely}} careful, for if these people suspect that we are so far on their track, they might remove Walter at once, and <b>we</b> <b>might</b> never <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to light upon a clew again." ...|$|R
60|$|Augustus now {{suggested}} that if Peters could contrive to remove, under any pretext, the piece of chain-cable which lay over the trap in the stateroom, <b>we</b> <b>might</b> possibly <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to come upon them unawares {{by means of the}} hold; but a little reflection convinced us that the vessel rolled and pitched too violently for any attempt of that nature.|$|R
60|$|He {{had hardly}} more than ceased {{speaking}} when a great uproar could be heard from the distance, and, without turning my head, I understood that the British regulars and the Johnson Greens were pressing {{the attack on the}} west and the front, in order to hold our men at the walls that <b>we</b> <b>might</b> not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to regain possession of the stockade.|$|R
6000|$|... "If it wasn't {{so heavy}} <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> swing the safe around {{away from the}} wall," [...] said Dick. [...] "But wait, hold that light closer, Tom, and I'll see if I can find out {{anything}} from the inside." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{would be}} best, Mr. Rover. Of course <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> patch things ourselves, but, {{unless you are}} in a great hurry, I advise going into port and having it done. It will have to be done sooner or later anyway." ...|$|E
60|$|Darius was on deck in a twinkling, and I {{followed}} him, {{hoping that}} <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> leave our mooring, for {{at such a}} time {{it would not be a}} very difficult matter to get so far up stream as to baffle pursuit.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, but he {{may lose}} his mind entirely," [...] gasped Nellie. [...] "I've read of such cases in the newspapers. A person wanders off and forgets who he is, or where he came from, and all that! Supposing Tom went to Alaska and that {{happened}} to him! Why, <b>we</b> <b>might</b> never <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to find him!" [...] And the tears began to course down Nellie's cheeks.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, señor, I {{think that}} {{before we start}} it will be well that I at least should go on to Ayapata {{and find out what}} is doing. That would only delay us two days, and <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> better <b>able</b> to judge as to which route to take. They may be {{fighting}} in the north, and {{we do not want to}} get mixed up in any way in their quarrels." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I guess you're right there," [...] {{answered}} Dave. [...] "And that's {{one reason}} I {{think we ought}} to try to get back to Crumville. But just the same, I'd hate to get stuck somewhere along the road, as he says. <b>We</b> boys <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> {{to get out of it}} along with Wash, but we couldn't expect the girls to do any tramping in such deep snow and in such a wind." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's so," [...] replied Peter. [...] "I don't {{see what}} he has his house in the water for, anyway. If he had built it on land, like {{sensible}} people, <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> waken him. Funny place to build a house, isn't it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{going to}} make our job a pretty hard one," [...] {{answered}} our hero. [...] "If Ward Porton was alone <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> capture him. But I don't see how {{we are going to}} do it with Jarvey and that man named Brown present." ...|$|E
60|$|In {{spite of}} my disappointment, I {{was glad to be}} in a warm house, and hoped <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> stay there. I could hear the storm beating furiously against the window-panes behind the drawn shades. There was a stove in the sitting-room, and a large lamp.|$|E
5000|$|I have {{received}} blessings that I did not deserve, and I lead this tribe as its chief. I hope that for generations, {{we will continue}} to serve as a watchdog outside the empire's north door, guarding it. But we are still currently weak, and if Xueyantuo should attack us, <b>we</b> <b>might</b> not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to stand. If that happens, I request permission to withdraw within the Great Wall.|$|R
60|$|Again had the lad {{put forth}} an {{argument}} which I could not answer, {{and yet it}} seemed to me then as if <b>we</b> <b>might</b> better <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to aid our elders in the coming struggle if we hid our purpose from the enemy, and by the enemy, I mean such scurvy rascals as Amos Nelson, of whom we could find many in Boston town without straining ourselves overmuch in the search.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes; he {{is coming}} to meet me, it appears. But, father,' she said more softly and slowly, 'how wrong {{it will be for}} me to come so close to you, and never {{recognize}} you! I don't like it. I wish you could have given up service by this time; it would have been so much less painful for us all round. I thought <b>we</b> <b>might</b> have <b>been</b> <b>able</b> to manage it somehow.' ...|$|R
