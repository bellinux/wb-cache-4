Its {{distinguishing}} feature was a firebrick wall {{two-thirds of the way}} down the furnace. The furnace grate was on the longer side of this, with the combustion gases passing out through the tube bank, along inside a steel outer casing, then back within the shorter tube bank. Coiled tube superheaters were placed in the gas flow outside the tubes. The combustion gases thus passed through the tube bank twice, once outwards and then again inwards. A single central chimney exhausted from the centre of the far end, not as usual from outside the tubes. The relative temperature difference between gas passage through the two sections of the bank led to a circulation current that was upwards through the first, hotter, part of the bank and downwards through the further, less hot, bank. Circulation was also controlled by an internal <b>weir</b> <b>plate</b> within the upper water drum, so as to keep a depth of water above the ends of the hotter tubes, thus avoiding overheating of dry tubes.|$|E

The flow characteristic over a thin plate weir is completely different between a single V notch weir and double VV notch weir. The continuity of the flow and accuracy of this type of weirs is reported to be poor. As an improvement, a compound weir composed of two triangle parts with a different notch angle and height has been designed. Mathematical method also been proposed to measure the discharge flow rate over the double VV notch compound weir.

40|$|Improving the {{separation}} {{efficiency of the}} inclined oil/water separator, {{a new type of}} gravity separation equipment, is of great importance. In order to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the internal flow field of {{the separation}} process of oil and water within this separator, a numerical simulation based on Euler multiphase flow analysis and the realizable k-ε two equation turbulence model was executed using Fluent software. The optimal value ranges of the separator's various structural parameters used in the numerical simulation were selected through orthogonal array experiments. A field experiment on the separator was conducted with optimized structural parameters in order to validate the reliability of the numerical simulation results. The research results indicated that the horizontal position of the dispenser, the hole number, and the diameter had significant effects on the oil/water separation efficiency, and that the longitudinal position of the dispenser and the position of the <b>weir</b> <b>plate</b> had insignificant effects on the oil/water separation efficiency. The optimal structural parameters obtained through the orthogonal array experiments resulted in an oil/water separation efficiency of up to 95 %, which was 4. 996 % greater than that realized by the original structural parameters...|$|E

The present work is aimed to study the flow characteristics of a twin <b>plate</b> <b>weir</b> (two sharp-crested <b>plates</b> are placed one behind the other at some distance) under free and submerged flow conditions. Experiments are performed with four spacing of the twin <b>plate</b> <b>weir</b> ranging from 10 cm to 40 cm under free and submerged flow conditions. It was observed that the coefficient of discharge (Cd) {{is a function of}} head over the crest (H 1) and height of the <b>plate</b> of the <b>weir</b> (P) in free flow condition. The critical submergence (H 2 /H 1) increases as the discharge increases, for a particular spacing of the twin <b>plate</b> <b>weir</b> (L). The critical submergence also increases with the increase in the spacing of the <b>weir</b> <b>plates</b> for any discharge.

Additionally, there is more area at the dewatering beach that is not covered by the pool which leads into a decrease in cake solid moisture.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Pivot weirs (sharp crested {{inclined}} weirs, Fig. 1 -a) {{is frequently}} used for discharge measurement, controlling water surface and flow diversion. Some typical features of pivot weirs are: (a) overshot design for better water level control, (b) Their application as head gates, turnout or check structure which requiring low head loss and high accuracy, (c) ease of removing sediment deposit behind the weir, and (d) {{ability to manage}} and monitor on-site or operating remotely when connected to a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) network. Kindsvater and Carter (8) derived a weir discharge equation based on energy and continuity equations. Hulsing (4) determined head-discharge relationship of inclined suppressed sharp crested weir with the slope of 3 : 3, 2 : 3 and 1 : 3 toward downstream and compared them with the equivalent normal sharp crested weir. In the USBR report on pivot weirs (regarding The Boulder Canyon Project, 1948) the head discharge data of the suppressed pivot weir were presented in a channel with 5. 5 m length, 2. 9 m depth and 0. 61 m width. Some field experiments were also {{carried out in the}} IID (Imperial Irrigation District) on a trapezoidal cross-section (0. 61 m bottom width) channel with pivot weir of 1. 7 m length, and two different widths of 1. 63 m. The flow rate (350 - 880 lit/s) was held constant and different angles (15 - 50 °) calibrated instead of holding the angle constant and varying the flow rate. Some other laboratory tests were performed with Wahlin and Replogle (1994) on two pivot weirs with 1. 2 m and 1. 14 m width for the 0. 61 m and 0. 46 m length of blade and contraction factor of 0. 925. RUBICON Company established an extensive operation on the application and automation of pivot weirs in irrigation channels in Australia (Www. rubicon. com). All previous studies concentrated on modifying the normal rectangular weir head-discharge equation {{so that it can be}} used for the pivot weirs. In this study, it is trying to derive a unique head-discharge equation for pivot weirs based on dimension analysis and critical discharge equation (implementing Ferro rule). This equation can be used for different inclined angles and side contractions. The obtained unique and simple discharge equation can be used in automation of this structure. Material and Method: In this research, experimental data consist of experiments carried out in hydraulic research institute of Tehran, Iran and experiments of USBR on Pivot weir with side contraction in 0. 925 in the canal with 1. 14 m width and 0. 46 m blade length (Wahlin and Replogle, 1994). Experiments of the water institute of Tehran were carried out in the concrete rectangular weir with 10. 30 m long, 1 m wide and 1 m depth (Fig. 2). Experimental model was consisted of canals, water supply system, dampers (avoided of turbulent flow upstream of pivot weir), pivot weirs, sluice gate at the end of the channel (make different tail waters). With respect to laboratory equipment’s, three pivot weirs with of 80 × 65, 60 × 55 and 40 × 40 (cm×cm) respectively length of the blade and the width was built and set 5. 5 m far from the first of the canal. Discharge was determined from the calibrated weir located at the upstream of pivot weir. A manual point gauge with ± 0. 01 mm sensitivity was used to measure water surface levels. Extraction of discharge equation: Dimensional Analysis based on Ferro rule (2000 and 2001) is used to determine the discharge formula of pivot weirs. Since the h-Q function is usually exponential, the relation between dimensionless parameters could be defined as Ferro rule. Results and Discussion: The rating curve of the pivot weirs with different side contractions is compared with the normal suppressed rectangular weir (equal weir height) in Fig. 3. The discharge of normal suppressed rectangular weir was calculated from the discharge equation of Kindsvater-Carter and discharge coefficient of Rehbock (1) for the equal weir height and head of pivot weirs. For a constant water head, the discharge of pivot weir with a side contraction of 0. 925 is more than the normal suppressed weir. When the <b>weir</b> <b>plate</b> is inclined to the bottom of the canal, because of the stagnation area behind the <b>weir</b> <b>plate,</b> the streamlines approach the weir blade smoothly and the energy dissipation is lower than for the normal weirs. The vortex behind the <b>weir</b> <b>plate</b> increases as the inclined angle increases and subsequently the discharge coefficient decreases. Reduction of discharge for a constant water head in contract weirs is simply justified by decreasing of the weir width. The α and β coefficients were obtained based on all experimental data. Discharge equation obtained based on critical depth-discharge equation. Conclusion: In this study, based on dimension analysis a unique head-discharge relation was obtained which could be used for different inclined angels and side contractions. This equation is more appropriate than previous formulas which are modifications to the normal weir head-discharge equation. The accuracy of this equation was evaluated by different data sets including different inclined angle, side contractions, weir heights and also a wide discharge range. This equation could be used in the automated irrigation network easily...|$|E

The study only considered the entrainment of organic into the strip acid effluent destined for the Defense Waste Processing Facility. Based on this work, the following observations are noted: (1) Concentrations of total organic from the contactor discharge, based upon modifier measurements, in the acid typically averaged 330 ppm{sub m}, for a range to 190 - 610 ppm{sub m}. (2) Entrained droplet sizes remained below 18 microns for samples collected at the decanter outlet and below 11 microns for samples taken from the contactor discharge. (3) Scouting tests showed that a vendor coalescer material promotes coalescence of smaller size droplets from the decanter effluent. (4) Personnel observed a previously unreported organic impurity in the solvent used for this study. Additional efforts are needed to ascertain {{the source of the}} impurity and its implication on the overall process. (5) Process throughputs and planned operating conditions result in very stable hydraulics, suggesting that the MCU stripping stages will have spare operating capacity. (6) The V- 5 contactors show operated with relatively cool surfaces under the planned operating conditions. (7) If operating conditions result in an imbalance of the relative mixing and separation conditions within the contactor, a very stable emulsion may result. In this instance, the emulsion remained stable for weeks. The imbalance in this study resulted from use of improperly sized <b>weir</b> <b>plates.</b> (8) Personnel demonstrated an effective means of recovering emulsified solvent following a non-optimal equipment configuration. The protocols developed may offer benefit for MCU and SWPF operations. (9) This study developed and demonstrated the effectiveness of several analytical methods for support of the Caustic-Side Solvent Extraction process including infrared spectroscopy and droplet size measurement by a MicroTrac{trademark} S 3000. Interfacial tension measurements also showed sensitivity to purity of the solvent suggesting that this technique may prove valuable for future process diagnostics. The study highlighted limitations of the current gas chromatography configuration for determination of modifier content of samples. Additional development of analytical methods for determining composition [...] and particularly modifier content [...] of organic and mixed aqueous-organic samples is warranted. Infrared spectroscopy shows particular promise. Additional full-scale studies are warranted to investigate the entrainment of organic in the aqueous effluent from the extraction operation. Since waste composition may differ appreciably for the process, this stream may exhibit much wider variance in hydraulic behavior, organic entrainment, and may pose a greater risk for poor hydraulics. Conducting contactor studies at SRNL allowed numerous personnel to view operations and facilitated the training of staff members. Members of the Design Authority, Engineering, and Training groups benefited from tours. Consideration should be given to procuring and installing a full-scale contactor at SRNL for future support and for assistance during commissioning of the MCU. Additional study of surface and interfacial tension is recommended. This tool may also offer economical and rapid process diagnostics for future operations...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a short study {{to examine the}} behaviour of submerged flow over a thin <b>plate</b> <b>weir</b> with differing upstream and downstream bed levels i. e. an unequal bed weir {{as opposed to an}} equal bed weir where the upstream and downstream beds are at the same level. As submerged weir flow is a function of downstream conditions, it was thought that a lower downstream bed would make submerged flow over the weir easier, This is turn suggested that; 	The shape of the upstream head (Hu) vs downstream head (Hd) graph would change, being initially more steep in the unequal bed case. 	The Froude Number of the approaching flow would be lower for the unequal bed weir than for an equal bed weir at the same submergence. 	Using one of the existing submerged flow formula would lead to an erroneous calculated value. A series of measurements was done on two model weirs of different sizes subject to successive levels of submergence. Analysis of the readings of upstream and downstream heads indicated that the difference in bed levels was significant and the three effects above were noted. The work also suggested a new form of equation to calculate flow over a submerged weir. This was looked at briefly...|$|R
40|$|Thin-plate weirs are {{commonly}} used as measuring devices in flumes and channels, enabling an accurate discharge measurement with simple instruments. The calibration formulae of such devices rely upon some empirical coefficients {{and there is a}} need to obtain new accurate physical data to complement the existing evidence. In the present study, the discharge calibration of a large 90 degrees V-notch thin <b>plate</b> <b>weir</b> was performed using an unsteady volume per time technique. The V-notch weir was initially closed by a fast-opening gate. The sudden opening induced an initial phase of the water motion dominated by the free-falling motion of a volume of fluid in the vicinity of the weir, followed by a gradually-varied phase, during which some seiche was observed in the tank. The relationship between water discharge and upstream water elevation was derived from the integral form of the continuity equation. The results yielded a dimensionless discharge coefficient C-d = 0. 58 close to previous experiments for 90 degrees V-notch weirs. The findings showed that the unsteady discharge calibration of the V-notch weir yielded similar results to a more traditional calibration approach based upon steady flow experiments, allowing a rapid testing over a broad range of flow rates.
