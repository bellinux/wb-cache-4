25|$|Greens leader Richard Di Natale, in {{a speech}} {{delivered}} to the National Press Club in March 2017, proposed that a discussion be had around the future of work in Australia, arguing that reduced work hours, or a shorter working <b>week,</b> <b>will</b> increase productivity and create new employment opportunities for those wishing to work more hours, while also allowing those wishing to work less {{the opportunity to do}} so. The shortfall in terms of wages earned would be made up through reform in the social welfare system; specifically, by the implementation of a universal basic income.|$|E

25|$|Reasonable {{exposure}} to ultraviolet {{radiation from the}} sun {{can be a good}} source of vitamin D. One minimal erythemal dose of sunlight UV radiation provides the equivalent of about 20,000 IU of vitamin D2, taken as an oral supplement. If an adult's arms and legs are exposed to a half minimal erythemal UV radiation, it is the same as taking 3,000 IU of vitamin D3 through an oral supplement. This exposure of 10–15 minutes, on a frequency of two to three times per <b>week</b> <b>will</b> cause the adult's skin to produce enough vitamin D. It is not necessary to expose the face to the UV, as facial skin provides little vitamin D3.

2500|$|The Hobbits, {{who have}} adopted the King's Reckoning, alter it in a {{different}} way from the Steward's Reckoning. Like the Steward's Reckoning, they have twelve months of thirty days, and five holidays outside the months. However, they have three [...] "extra" [...] days in midsummer and two in midwinter, similar to the Elven calendar. In the Shire the three days of midsummer are called Lithedays, and the two days of midwinter are the Yuledays. In leap years, the extra day is added to the Lithedays and called Overlithe. The other innovation in the Shire calendar is to make Midsummer's Day (and the Overlithe) outside the week, as well as the month, meaning the days of the <b>week</b> <b>will</b> not change in relation to the days of the year. The Shire Reckoning is the calendar used in the Red Book of Westmarch, and hence in The Lord of the Rings. It counts from the founding of the Shire in T.A. 1600.|$|E

The Constituent Assembly of Egypt rushed to finish its work amid widespread protests against Morsi and his declaration. The rush toward a new constitution spurred a walkout among its drafters, i.e. liberals, human rights activists, and others who were unsatisfied with a range of provisions dealing with {{the role of religion in}} the state, the status of women, and the privileges accorded to the country's army. According to the BBC's Jon Leybe the move was designed to preempt a ruling by Egypt's Supreme Constitutional Court on 2 December, which might once again dissolve the assembly. The Brotherhood hoped that the decree replaced by a completely new constitution would be approved on a referendum and put an end to the unrest. Low-level rallies continued in Cairo's Tahrir Square on Wednesday. Dozens of police officers, backed by trucks firing tear gas, arrested numerous protesters, some of whom were beaten by officers as others continued to throw stones at police. The Brotherhood organized counter-demonstrations, including one in Egypt's second city, Alexandria, which attracted a few thousand participants. As protests mounted over Morsi's decision to grant himself sweeping powers until the text of the constitution was ratified in a referendum, the panel tasked with writing the constitution wrapped up its deliberations on Wednesday and readied for a vote on Thursday. By 28 November two more people were killed and hundreds more injured. Egypt Independent reported that one of the dead was Fathy Ghareeb, a founder of the Socialist Popular Alliance Party, who died by suffocation caused by the tear gas fired by the Central Security Forces (CSF) in Tahrir Square. Egypt's Court of Cassation, the country's highest appeals court, the Cairo Appeals Court, and other appeals courts suspended their work until Morsi's decree is rescinded.|$|E
