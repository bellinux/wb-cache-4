25|$|Free {{movement}} of people across the EU will give many Turkish people the opportunity to easily migrate {{to other parts of}} Europe in search of work, or a higher standard of living. The option of migration out of Turkey will inevitably ease tensions in the east of the country, as the prospect of a better standard of living will tend to cool separatist tendencies. Some secularists in Turkey envisage that the accession of Turkey <b>will</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> spread of secular western values in Turkey. Conversely, some non-secularists in Turkey envisage that accession <b>will</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> further growth and acceptance of Islam in Europe.

25|$|Yield {{management}} is of especially high relevance {{in cases where}} the constant costs are relatively high compared to the variable costs. The less variable cost there is, the more the additional revenue earned <b>will</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> overall profit. This is because it focuses on maximizing expected marginal revenue for a given operation and planning horizon. It optimizes resource utilization by ensuring inventory availability to customers with the highest expected net revenue contribution and extracting the greatest level of ‘willingness to pay’ from the entire customer base. Yield management practitioners typically claim 3% to 7% incremental revenue gains. In many industries this can equate to over 100% increase in profits.|$|E
25|$|The Government of Argentina (GoA) with World Bank {{assistance}} has {{aimed to}} reduce industrial wastewater discharge (organic {{as well as}} toxic effluents) that directly enter the MR River. Over the next 15–20 years these efforts <b>will</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> environmental recovery of the river. They {{will focus on the}} 50 main industrial polluters that contribute ~95% of the total industrial organic load (approximately 70 percent of the total organic load) discharged to the MR River and a further 170 industries with the highest toxic load currently discharged into the MR River. A combination of technical assistance to improve monitoring, control, and enforcement by the MR Basin Authority will be instituted. The idea is to help in collecting baseline data and carry out diagnostic exercises. Support will be provided for private sector investments in pollution control and cleaner production processes, targeting small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs) that typically pollute more per unit of output and have weaker financial and technical capacity to comply with environmental regulations.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} several costs {{associated}} with circular migration. One of these is brain drain, where a migrant who migrates because of skills or education creates a loss of human resources {{in the country of}} origin. These highly skilled workers are in demand in the more developed countries, where in some areas the barriers to immigration have been reduced to allow for both permanent and temporary migration. At the same time, barriers against unskilled workers have been strengthened. The ability to use skills also varies and can constitute a cost to the migrant and the economy, If the migrants had unskilled jobs while working abroad, they will have little experience that <b>will</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> development of their home country upon return. Additionally, even if the worker learned new technical or industrial skills, {{they may not be able}} to use them if their country of origin does not have the infrastructure or institutional framework to support them. Circular migration also has a social impact on the families of migrant workers. If labor migrants have children, these minors may be temporarily abandoned while their parents are abroad working. This issue is problematic and some authorities have begun to formulate policies to monitor the situation.|$|E

25|$|The Roadmap for the Integration of ASEAN in Finance is {{the latest}} {{regional}} initiative, which aims to strengthen regional self-help and support mechanisms. The implementation of the roadmap <b>will</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> realisation of the ASEAN Economic Community that was launched by the ASEAN leaders in October 2003 in Bali. The AEC is the end-goal of economic integration as outlined in the ASEAN Vision 2020 and the Bali Concord II to establish a single market and production base, characterised by the free movement of goods, services, investment, and a freer flow of capital. The AEC will also facilitate the movement of business professionals, skilled labour, and talent within the region. As in the EU, adoption of an ASEAN common currency, when conditions are ripe, could be {{the final stage of}} the ASEAN Economic Community. Under the roadmap, approaches and milestones have been identified in areas deemed crucial to financial and monetary integration, namely: (a) capital market development, (b) capital account liberalisation, (c) financial services liberalisation, and (d) ASEAN currency co-operation. Capital market development entails promoting institutional capacity, including the legal and regulatory framework, as well as the facilitation of greater cross-border collaboration, linkages, and harmonisation between capital markets in the region. Orderly capital account liberalisation will be promoted with adequate safeguards against volatility and systemic risks. To expedite the process of financial services liberalisation, ASEAN has agreed on a positive list modality and adopted milestones to facilitate negotiations. Currency co-operation would involve exploration of possible currency arrangements, including an ASEAN currency payment system for trade in local goods to reduce the demand for US dollars and to help promote stability of regional currencies, such as by settling intra-ASEAN trade using regional currencies.|$|E
