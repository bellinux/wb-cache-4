30|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to endorse the driving factors behind total factor productivity (TFP) and economic growth in Pakistan. Pakistan’s average growth rate is 5 % for last few decades, and although this growth level is satisfactory, Pakistan faced several formidable challenges yet. The economic growth has been determined mainly through labor-intensive technology and export-oriented manufacturing activities. However, TFP is assessed from the aggregate production function using the Cobb–Douglas production function that permits for the simultaneous expansion of outputs and contraction of inputs. The annual timer series data have been extracted from 1972 – 2016 <b>World</b> <b>development</b> <b>Indicator</b> (WDI) for this study. The overall results reveal that almost all variables are statistical significant. Moreover, innovation significantly contributes to economic growth and production level in Pakistan. This analysis may have significant suggestions to policy makers in Pakistan and other emerging economies when framing sustainable growth policy.|$|R

Next, I explored the dynamic relationships among healthcare expenditure, human capital and economic growth usingOLSmodel. The expenditure in private healthcare was 2. 3 % and 1. 2 % GDP for the public health in 2010. A Wald statistic determined the joint significance of the data andR 2 = 99. 42 %for human capital andR 2 = 99. 44 % for economic growth indicates thismodel was the best fit.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study is to {{investigate}} the effects of different economic determinants on foreign direct investment (FDI) for three countries selected from Central Asia namely Armenia, Kyrgyz Republic and Turkmenistan.

Simple econometric model in log form and the least squares technique have been used. Result found indicates positive effects of market size, official development assistance on FDI and negative effect of inflation on FDI. However, in case of Armenia, the effect of official development assistance on FDI has been found insignificant and such as in case of Kyrgyz Republic, the effect of inflation on FDI has been found insignificant with expected negative sign. Thus, findings of the study recommend that market size and official development assistance needs to be encouraged and inflation needs to be managed in order to achieve higher level of FDI and accelerate the process of economic development...|$|R
