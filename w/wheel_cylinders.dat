25|$|The Chrysler 4-wheel {{disc brake}} system was {{more complex and}} {{expensive}} than Crosley's, but far more efficient and reliable. It was built by Auto Specialties Manufacturing Company (Ausco) of St. Joseph, Michigan, under patents of inventor H.L. Lambert, and was first tested on a 1939 Plymouth. Unlike the caliper disc, the Ausco-Lambert utilized twin expanding discs that rubbed against the inner surface of a cast iron brake drum, which doubled as the brake housing.

2500|$|Chrysler {{developed}} a unique braking system, offered from 1949 to 1953. Instead of the disc with caliper squeezing on it, this system used twin expanding discs that rubbed against the inner {{surface of a}} cast-iron brake drum, which doubled as the brake housing. The discs spread apart to create friction against the inner drum surface through the action of standard <b>wheel</b> <b>cylinders.</b> Because of the expense, the brakes were only standard on the Chrysler Crown and the Town and Country Newport in 1950. They were optional, however, on other Chryslers, priced around $400, {{at a time when}} an entire Crosley Hot Shot retailed for $935. This four-wheel disc brake system was built by Auto Specialties Manufacturing Company (Ausco) of St. Joseph, Michigan, under patents of inventor H.L. Lambert, and was first tested on a 1939 Plymouth. Chrysler discs were [...] "self energizing," [...] in that some of the braking energy itself contributed to the braking effort. This was accomplished by small balls set into oval holes leading to the brake surface. When the disc made initial contact with the friction surface, the balls would be forced up the holes forcing the discs further apart and augmenting the braking energy. This made for lighter braking pressure than with calipers, avoided brake fade, promoted cooler running, and provided one-third more friction surface than standard Chrysler twelve-inch drums. Today's owners consider the Ausco-Lambert very reliable and powerful, but admit its grabbiness and sensitivity.|$|E
50|$|<b>Wheel</b> <b>cylinders</b> must {{be rebuilt}} or {{replaced}} if they {{show signs of}} leaking. <b>Wheel</b> <b>cylinders</b> used {{to be made of}} cast iron. However, they were more prone to rusting and aluminium is now the preferred material.|$|E
50|$|One <b>wheel</b> <b>cylinder</b> {{operates}} the brake on each wheel. Two pistons operate the shoes, one {{at each end}} of the <b>wheel</b> <b>cylinder.</b> The leading shoe (closest to the front of the vehicle) is known as the primary shoe. The trailing shoe is known as the secondary shoe. Hydraulic pressure from the master cylinder acts on the piston cup, pushing the pistons toward the shoes, forcing them against the drum. When the driver releases the brakes, the brake shoe springs restore the shoes to their original (disengaged) position. The parts of the <b>wheel</b> <b>cylinder</b> are shown to the right.|$|R
50|$|Drum brake {{components}} {{include the}} backing plate, brake drum, shoe, <b>wheel</b> <b>cylinder,</b> and various springs and pins.|$|R

5000|$|... <b>wheel</b> <b>cylinders</b> are {{somewhat}} simpler to recondition compared to calipers.|$|E
50|$|Brake fluids {{must not}} corrode the metals used inside {{components}} such as calipers, <b>wheel</b> <b>cylinders,</b> master cylinders and ABS control valves. They must also protect against corrosion as moisture enters the system. Additives (corrosion inhibitors) {{are added to}} the base fluid to accomplish this. Silicone is less corrosive to paintwork unlike glycol-ether based DOT fluids.|$|E
50|$|The {{process is}} {{performed}} by forcing clean, bubble-free brake fluid {{through the entire}} system, usually from the master cylinder(s) to the calipers of disc brakes (or the <b>wheel</b> <b>cylinders</b> of drum brakes), but in certain cases in the opposite direction. A brake bleed screw is normally mounted at the highest point on each cylinder or caliper.|$|E

50|$|Alternatively, in a drum brake, {{the fluid}} enters a <b>wheel</b> <b>cylinder</b> and presses {{one or two}} brake shoes against {{the inside of the}} {{spinning}} drum. The brake shoes use a similar heat-tolerant friction material to the pads used in disc brakes.|$|R
5000|$|Since no English {{manufacturer}} would, or could, supply him, {{he ordered}} 4-2-0 locomotives from Norris of Philadelphia in the United States. The loco they supplied had 4 ft driving <b>wheels,</b> <b>cylinder</b> bore of 10+1/2 in, and 18 in stroke, weighing 10+1/4 LT ...|$|R
5000|$|Brake fluid is {{subjected}} to very high temperatures, especially in the <b>wheel</b> <b>cylinders</b> of drum brakes and disk brake calipers. It must have a high boiling point to avoid vaporizing in the lines. This vaporization is a problem because vapor is highly compressible relative to liquid, and therefore negates the hydraulic transfer of braking force - so the brakes will fail to stop the vehicle.|$|E
50|$|A wheel {{cylinder}} is a component in a drum brake system. It {{is located in}} each wheel and is usually positioned {{at the top of}} the wheel, above the shoes. Its function is to exert force onto the shoes so as to bring them into contact with the drum and stop the vehicle with friction. The <b>wheel</b> <b>cylinders</b> are usually connected to the shoes with small bird-beak shaped rods.|$|E
50|$|The wheel {{cylinder}} {{consists of a}} cylinder that has two pistons, one on each side. Each piston has a rubber seal and a shaft that connects the piston with a brake shoe. When brake pressure is applied, the pistons are forced out pushing the shoes {{into contact with the}} drum. Some designs use two single piston <b>wheel</b> <b>cylinders,</b> one {{at the top of the}} drum and one at the bottom, each connected to one brake shoe.|$|E
50|$|The {{new engine}} {{was built in}} 1991 at Pendre works on the Talyllyn Railway. The frames, boiler, driving <b>wheels,</b> <b>cylinders</b> {{and other parts of}} the 0-4-0 well tank engine from Bord na Móna were used. The new engine became an 0-4-2 side tank and was named Tom Rolt after the author L. T. C. Rolt who {{inspired}} the Talyllyn's preservation.|$|R

50|$|A hog oiler was a {{mechanical}} device employed on farms {{to be used}} by hogs to provide relief from insects and offer skin protection. It consisted of a reservoir to hold oil, and a means to distribute the oil onto the hog, often via grooved <b>wheels</b> or <b>cylinders.</b> Hogs seeking relief would rub up against a <b>wheel</b> (or <b>cylinder)</b> causing it to rotate and dispense oil onto their bodies.|$|R
50|$|The Chrysler 4-wheel {{disc brake}} system was {{more complex and}} {{expensive}} than Crosley's, but far more efficient and reliable. It was built by Auto Specialties Manufacturing Company (Ausco) of St. Joseph, Michigan, under patents of inventor H.L. Lambert, and was first tested on a 1939 Plymouth. Unlike the caliper disc, the Ausco-Lambert utilized twin expanding discs that rubbed against the inner surface of a cast iron brake drum, which doubled as the brake housing. The discs spread apart to create friction against the inner drum surface through the action of standard <b>wheel</b> <b>cylinders.</b>|$|E
50|$|Also, {{drum brakes}} {{do not apply}} {{immediately}} when the <b>wheel</b> <b>cylinders</b> are pressurized, because {{the force of the}} return springs must be overcome before the shoes start to move towards the drum. This means that the very common hybrid disc/drum systems only brake with the discs on light pedal pressure unless extra hardware is added. In practice, a metering valve prevents hydraulic pressure from reaching the front calipers until pressure rises enough to overcome the return springs in the drum brakes. If the metering valve were left out, the vehicle would stop only with the front discs until return spring pressure on the rear shoes were overcome.|$|E
50|$|The modern {{automobile}} {{drum brake}} {{was first used}} in a car made by Maybach in 1900, although the principle was only later patented in 1902 by Louis Renault. He used woven asbestos lining for the drum brake lining, as no alternative dissipated heat like the asbestos lining, though Maybach had used a less sophisticated drum brake. In the first drum brakes, levers and rods or cables operated the shoes mechanically. From the mid-1930s, oil pressure in a small wheel cylinder and pistons (as in the picture) operated the brakes, though some vehicles continued with purely mechanical systems for decades. Some designs have two <b>wheel</b> <b>cylinders.</b>|$|E
50|$|When {{the brakes}} are applied, brake fluid is forced under {{pressure}} from the master <b>cylinder</b> into the <b>wheel</b> <b>cylinder,</b> which in turn pushes the brake shoes into contact with the machined surface {{on the inside of the}} drum. This rubbing action reduces the rotation of the brake drum, which is coupled to the wheel. Hence the speed of the vehicle is reduced. When the pressure is released, return springs pull the shoes back to their rest position.|$|R
50|$|George Jackson Churchward {{started his}} railway {{career in the}} South Devon Railway {{locomotive}} workshops at Newton Abbot. After that company {{became a part of}} the GWR in 1876 he was sent to Swindon and worked under Armstrong and Dean. After his appointment as Locomotive Superintendent in 1902 he developed a series of standard locomotive types with flat-topped Belpaire fireboxes, tapered boilers, long smokeboxes, boiler top feeds, long-lap long-travel valve gear, and many standardised parts such as <b>wheels,</b> <b>cylinders</b> and connecting rods.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotive}} was a Manning Wardle Class B engine with 30 {{in diameter}} coupled <b>wheels</b> and <b>cylinders</b> with a 7 in bore and 12 in stroke.|$|R
5000|$|A small drop in {{brake fluid}} {{level in the}} master {{cylinder}} reservoir can be [...] "topped up" [...] but if the level consistently drops, the cause should be investigated and repaired. Brake fluid level in the master cylinder will drop as the linings (pads or shoes) wear and the calipers or <b>wheel</b> <b>cylinders</b> extend further to compensate. Overspill from pushing back pistons should be avoided, because glycol based fluid will quickly lift or strip paints and other coatings on contact (it can be removed by quickly washing with water, not wiping). Brake fluid level may also be low because of a leak, which {{could result in a}} loss of hydraulic pressure and consequently a significant loss of braking ability. Modern cars have redundant hydraulic circuits (two separate circuits) to ensure against total hydraulic failure.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} vehicle uses of master {{cylinders}} are in brake and clutch systems. In brake systems, the operated devices are cylinders inside of brake calipers and/or drum brakes; these cylinders {{may be called}} <b>wheel</b> <b>cylinders</b> or slave cylinders, and they push the brake pads towards a surface that rotates with the wheel (this surface is typically either a drum, or a disc, a.k.a. a rotor) until the stationary brake pad(s) create friction against that rotating surface (typically the rotating surface is metal or ceramic/carbon, {{for their ability to}} withstand heat and friction without wearing-down rapidly). In the clutch system, the device which the master cylinder operates is called the slave cylinder; it moves the throw out bearing until the high-friction material on the transmission's clutch disengages from the engine's metal (or ceramic/carbon) flywheel. For hydraulic brakes or clutches alike, flexible high-pressure hoses or inflexible hard-walled metal tubing may be used; but the flexible variety of tubing is needed for at least a short length adjacent to each wheel, whenever the wheel can move relative to the car's chassis (this is the case on any car with steering and other suspension movements; some drag racers and go-karts have no rear suspension, as the rear axle is welded to the chassis, and some antique cars also have no rear suspension movement).|$|E

50|$|Certain {{heavier duty}} drum brake systems {{compensate}} for load when determining <b>wheel</b> <b>cylinder</b> pressure; a feature rare when discs are employed (Hydropneumatic suspension systems as employed on Citroën vehicles adjust brake pressure depending on load regardless of if drum or discs are used). One such vehicle is the Jeep Comanche. The Comanche can automatically send more {{pressure to the}} rear drums {{depending on the size}} of the load. Most other brands have used load sensing valves in the hydraulics to the rear axle for decades.|$|R

There are various types of chairs {{available}} in the market but most of them do not provide any support while climbing support so patient must have to be depending on other people.

50|$|The parking (or emergency) {{brake system}} {{controls}} the brakes {{through a series}} of steel cables that are connected to either a hand lever or a foot pedal. The idea is that the system is fully mechanical and completely bypasses the hydraulic system so that the vehicle can be brought to a stop even if there is a total brake failure. Here the cable pulls on a lever mounted in the brake and is directly connected to the brake shoes. This has the effect of bypassing the <b>wheel</b> <b>cylinder</b> and controlling the brakes directly.|$|R
40|$|Unified brake {{service is}} a {{universal}} service for generating certain brake force {{to meet the demand}} deceleration and is essential for an automated driving system. However, it is rather difficult to control the pressure in the <b>wheel</b> <b>cylinders</b> to reach the target deceleration of the automated vehicle, which is the key issue of the active deceleration control system (ADC). This paper proposes a hierarchical control method to actively control vehicle deceleration with active-brake actuators. In the upper hierarchical, the target pressure of <b>wheel</b> <b>cylinders</b> is obtained by dynamic equations of a pure electric vehicle. In the lower hierarchical, the solenoid valve instructions and the pump speed of hydraulic control unit (HCU) are determined to satisfy the desired pressure with the feedback of measured wheel cylinder pressure by pressure sensors. Results of road experiments of a pure electric and automated vehicle indicate that the proposed method realizes the target deceleration accurately and efficiently...|$|E
25|$|The K class 2-8-0 {{built by}} VR in 1922-23 was a success, {{but with a}} firebox mounted between frames {{engineered}} for broad gauge operation only, it was not readily gauge-convertible. Thus when additional branch line locomotives were required, the VR produced a 2-8-2 'Mikado' variant of the K, the first 2-8-2 tender engine in Australia. It retained the same <b>wheels,</b> <b>cylinders,</b> motion, {{and much of the}} frame of the K, but featured a longer boiler with a wider, larger grate, mounted above the frames and supported by a trailing truck. This enabled possible gauge conversion without radical re-engineering of the frames and grate.|$|R
