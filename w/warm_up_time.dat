We assess the reliability and accuracy of various digitizers, sensors and/or digitizer-sensor couples. Although this study is of general interest for any kind of seismological study, we emphasize the influence of equipment on H/V analysis results. To display the impact of the instrumental part on the H/V behavior, some series of tests have been carried out following a step-by-step procedure: first, the digitizers have been tested in the lab (sensitivity, internal noise [...] .), then the three components sensors, still in the lab, and finally the usual user digitizers-sensors couple in lab and outdoors. In general, the digitizer characteristics, verified during this test, correspond well to the manufacturer specifications, however, depending on the digitizer, the quality of the digitized waveform can be very good to very poor, with variation from a channel to another channel (gain, time difference etc.). It appears very clearly that digitizers need a <b>warming</b> <b>up</b> <b>time</b> before the recording to avoid problems in the low-frequency range. Regarding the sensors, we recommend strongly to avoid the use of “classical” accelerometers (i. e., usual force balance technology). The majority of tested seismometers (broadband and short period, even 4. 5 Hz) can be used without problems from 0. 4 to 25 Hz.

Methods : Twenty male golfers were matched for age (± 2 years) and handicap (± 1 stroke). Club head speed was assessed by two dimensional video analysis in a laboratory setting. In week 1, all golfers performed 10 strokes. In weeks 2 and 7, the controls underwent the same procedure as in week 1. The exercise group performed the golf specific <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> followed by their 10 strokes. Between weeks 2 and 7, the exercise group performed the specially designed <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> five <b>times</b> a week for 5 weeks. Results : The mean club head speeds of the exercise group improved at each testing week. Between weeks 1 and 2, golfers in the exercise group improved their club head speed on average by 3 – 6 m/s (12. 8 %), and between weeks 1 and 7, they increased their club head speeds by 7 – 10 m/s (24. 0 %). With the exception of one golfer whose club head speed varied by 1. 7 m/s, the mean club head speeds of the golfers in the control group hardly varied over the testing period (range: 0. 3 – 0. 8 m/s).

He was removed from the game in favor of Jason Hammel, who had never recorded a save at the MLB level, and was the only remaining reliever available for the Rays in the game due to its length. Hammel converted the save opportunity, but many questioned if Percival should remain as the team's closer.

40|$|Electronics warming has broad {{applications}} in the aerospace industry, where electronics assemblies are subject to lower than recommended temperature environments. Prior to operation {{it is necessary to}} raise the temperature of the electronics to the minimum safe operating level, recommended by the manufacturer. This is managed by adding an electrical heater inside the electronics assembly enclosure. A very important characteristic of the heater is how quickly the desired temperature needs to be reached. Of course, this characteristic determines the size of the heater needed for the warm up process. Since relatively low failure mode temperatures are often required by the aerospace industry, there is an additional level of complexity involved in designing the optimum size of a heater. In a failure mode condition, the analysis requires a heater to be sized to produce a small amount of heat even under hot environmental conditions. The two requirements of fast <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> <b>time</b> and low failure mode temperatures seem contradictory. The art of the Thermal Management in this type of design is {{to come up with a}} specific optimum heater size that can satisfy a rapid warm up requirement and yet not exceed the maximum allowable temperature during a failure mode scenario. Often a thermal engineer needs to work with an electrical engineer to manipulate the control algorithm for the heater in order to satisfy these two requirements. This study will investigate how to approach such a problem and how one can size such heater. Also, optimization techniques are considered in order to choose the proper design among all available solutions. There are two different ways to achieve a desired <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> <b>time</b> of a cold soaked electronics assembly. The first approach may require some manipulation of the location of the heater inside the box or the addition of insulating materials. This approach captures the heat generated by the heater inside the enclosure in order to achieve quicker warm up period. However, the presence of an insulator increases the risk of dangerously high temperatures during a failure mode scenario. To alleviate the insulator effect, the external enclosure heat dissipation mechanism must be altered. This kind of modification is costly and requires additional design steps. This is where the benefit of the second approach comes in. Namely, the desired result of a fast <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> <b>time</b> and lower failure mode temperatures can be achieved by manipulating the heater controller and controlling the amount of power to the heater. A Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) Controller can be used to control not only the amount of heat generated by a heater, but also the percentage of heater "on” time within one pulse width and therefore the <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> <b>time.</b> Having the ability to control the frequency of releasing heat into the cold enclosure allows us to indicate two new parameters : the amount of heat load and the heat load frequency of inserting heat. A thermal management scheme can be developed to optimize the most efficient pair of values that will meet <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> <b>time</b> and failure mode temperature criteria. An analytical model is developed to study the thermal management of such a problem. The analytical model is used to perform an optimization study and to recommend a heater controller design for a given required specification...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: A <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> is {{undertaken}} before exercise {{to prepare the}} body for performance, reduce injury and improve performance[1]. Despite evidence suggesting that low intensity static-based <b>warm</b> <b>ups</b> are detrimental to performance[2] they are often included in pre-game <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> routines. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine whether a dynamic-based <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> of shorter duration and higher intensity (DSH) was more effective at preparing elite rugby league players for performance than a <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> that included combined static and dynamic activities of longer duration and lower intensity (Cll). It was hypothesised that the DSH <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> would be superior to the Cll <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> with respect to physical performance measures and player perceptions of readiness to perform. Methods: Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects with testing approved by the JCU research Ethics committee. Elite rugby league players (n= 28) completed the DSH and Cll <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> routines in random order, separated by 7 days. Following each <b>warm</b> <b>up,</b> players completed vertical jump and 40 m sprint. Player and coach perceptions of the <b>warm</b> <b>ups</b> and readiness to play or train were determined by questionnaires and interviews. Paired samples T -tests were used to identify significant differences between <b>warm</b> <b>ups</b> (p < 0. 05). Results: Players reported no significant differences between <b>warm</b> <b>ups</b> for preparedness to perform vertical jump (DSH: 6. 3 ± 1. 3 vs Cll: 6. 0 ± 1. 0, P = 0. 25) or 40 m sprint (DSH: 6. 3 ± 1. 8 vs Cll: 6. 3 ± 1. 7, P = 0. 917). Senior players and coaching staff rated the DSH <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> as significantly better than the Cll <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> (DSH: 7. 6 ± 1. 3 vs Cll: 6. 0 ± 1. 1, P = 0. 019) after using the DSH <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> in three preseason trial games. ConclusionlDiscussion: The dynamic <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> resulted in significantly faster 40 m sprint times and higher perception of readiness to perform in games compared to the combined <b>warm</b> <b>up.</b> The vertical jump result of no difference between <b>warm</b> <b>ups</b> contrasted available research[3] however this may be due to the dynamic component of the Cll <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> mitigating the detrimental effects of the static component[4]. The players' higher rating of the DSH <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> indicate that the DSH <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> should be used in preference to the Cll <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> as it elicits enhanced sprint performance and psychological preparedness to compete...|$|R
5000|$|The 2016 Chevrolet Malibu Hybrid car {{features}} an Exhaust Gas Heat Recovery (EGHR) system to accelerate coolant heat <b>up</b> <b>time.</b> This gives faster heat {{up of the}} engine coolant which in turn heats up the engine faster. Less choke is used giving reduced emissions and fuel consumption. This will also quicken cabin heating <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> for passenger comfort and window defrosting. For hybrid applications it also can warm the battery pack. The cooling system is connected to a heat exchanger placed in the exhaust gas transferring the thermal energy from the exhaust gas to the cooling system. When the engine is <b>warmed</b> <b>up</b> the exhaust gas is diverted to a by-pass pipe. http://gmauthority.com/blog/2015/04/2016-chevrolet-malibu-hybrid-exhaust-gas-heat-recovery-feature-spotlight/ ...|$|R
