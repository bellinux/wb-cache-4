We strictly enjoining Command you upon the faith and allegiance by which you are bound to Us that the <b>weightness</b> of the said affairs and imminent perils considered, waiving all excuses, you be at the said day and place personally present with Us and with the said Prelates, Great Men, and Peers to treat and give your counsel upon the affairs aforesaid.

40|$|The basic aim {{behind this}} {{research}} is to design an interplanetary spacecraft for a manned mission to Mars using issues of human physiology and psychology, interior architectural design considerations, ergonomic engineering and structural mechanics. The Minimal Artificial <b>Weightness</b> Concept (MAWC) was developed at ENSICA by Dr. Y. Gourinat and involves rotating the spacecraft about a central axis {{in order to create}} a sense of <b>weightness</b> in the modules. This reduces the medical problems experienced in zero gravity. The values of rotation rate and radius of the spacecraft have been chosen as 2 revolutions per minute and 45 m respectively. A total of three modules were chosen due to reasons of structural mechanics, with each module accommodating a crew of four. The habitation modules comprise a cyclindrical structure of dimensions 6 m in diameter and 12 m in length and consist of a two layered arrangement with staircases linking the two floors. Focus has been given to the detailed interior design of the habitation modules, taking into account psychological issues and these have been incorporated into the design by the choice of lay-out, materials, colours, lighting and furniture. The resulting modules have been modelled on computer using CATIA software...|$|E
