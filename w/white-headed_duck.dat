Other large birds include storks, flamingoes, herons, egrets, pelicans, quail, sunbirds and golden orioles. About four hundred and eighty species of bird have been recorded, the globally endangered ones being the red-breasted goose, <b>white-headed</b> <b>duck,</b> Balearic shearwater, Egyptian vulture, Rüppell's vulture, sociable lapwing, slender-billed curlew, saker falcon and yellow-breasted bunting. Egypt is on a major bird migratory route between Eurasia and East Africa and around two hundred species of migrants pass through twice a year.|$|E
25|$|Since 1600, five {{species of}} ducks have become extinct {{due to the}} {{activities}} of humans, and subfossil remains have shown that humans caused numerous extinctions in prehistory. Today, many more are considered threatened. Most of the historic and prehistoric extinctions were insular species, vulnerable due to small populations (often endemic to a single island), and island tameness. Evolving on islands that lacked predators, these species lost antipredator behaviours, {{as well as the}} ability to fly, and were vulnerable to human hunting pressure and introduced species. Other extinctions and declines are attributable to overhunting, habitat loss and modification, and hybridisation with introduced ducks (for example the introduced ruddy duck swamping the <b>white-headed</b> <b>duck</b> in Europe). Numerous governments and conservation and hunting organisations have made considerable progress in protecting ducks and duck populations through habitat protection and creation, laws and protection, and captive-breeding programmes.|$|E

During the day they spent 61 % of time resting, 22 % feeding, 12 % comfort and 5 % in locomotion. Resting peaked in the middle of day while feeding was observed frequently in evening and morning.

50|$|Despite {{occupying a}} {{relatively}} small area, 265 bird species have been observed in the protected area Poda. 46 bird species nest {{in the area and}} it is the only location on the Black Sea Coast with a mixed heron breeding colony of spoonbill, glossy ibis, purple heron, grey heron, night heron, great white egret and little egret. Other species breeding in the area are marsh harriers, common terns and little terns, and great cormorants - which have forsaken their usual breeding sites in reed beds and made their nests in the abandoned electrical pylons in the area. Its rich biodiversity is attributed to the three different types of water habitats it contains - brackish, fresh, and hyper-saline salt water. During the winter months in the bay at Poda, pygmy cormorants, a globally endangered species, rest at Poda. Other endangered species in the area at this time are Dalmatian pelicans and <b>white-headed</b> <b>ducks.</b> They share the bay with thousands of coots, pochards, and other ducks. Poda is located along Europe's second largest bird migration route, the Via Pontica. Annually, 75% of the European white stork population (over 250,000), 100% of the white pelican population (over 40,000) and thousands of raptors, waterfowl and song birds can be observed during the months of migration in March-April and August-September.|$|R

40|$|Between 1978 and 2008, 13 avian {{botulism}} outbreaks {{were recorded}} in the wetlands of mancha húmeda (central spain). these outbreaks caused the deaths of around 20, 000 birds from over 50 species, including globally endangered <b>white-headed</b> <b>ducks</b> (oxyura leucoceophala). here, a significant association {{was found between the}} number of dead birds recorded in each botulism outbreak and the mean temperature in july (always> 26 °c). the presence of clostridium botulinum type c/d in wetland sediments was detected by real-time pcr (quantitative pcr [qpcr]) in 5. 8 % of 207 samples collected between 2005 and 2008. low concentrations of cl- and high organic matter content in sediments were significantly associated with the presence of c. botulinum. seventy-five digestive tracts of birds found dead during botulism outbreaks were analyzed; c. botulinum was present in 38. 7 % of them. the prevalence of c. botulinum was 18. 2 % (n= 22 pools) in aquatic invertebrates (chironomidae and corixidae families) and 33. 3 % (n= 18 pools) in necrophagous invertebrates (sarcophagidae and calliphoridae families), including two pools of adult necrophagous flies collected around bird carcasses. the presence of the bacteria in the adult fly form opens up new perspectives in the epidemiology of avian botulism, since these flies may be transporting c. botulinum from one carcass to another.

50|$|Akyatan {{is also an}} {{important}} nesting ground in winters. During the harsh winters of inland Anatolia, with the freeze of lakes at plateaus, huge flocks of birds fly to Akyatan. It is estimated that 70,000 to 80,000 birds live in Akyatan during winter. Among the birds that nest the winter in Akyatan, pochard, Eurasian wigeon, common shelduck, Eurasian coot form large flocks besides the endangered <b>white-headed</b> <b>duck.</b> Greater flamingo is another popular bird in the area.

50|$|LIPU: the Italian League for the Protection of Birds, {{established}} the Centro Anatidi e Cicogne in 1985 {{in a large}} farmhouse near the castle as a site for the reintroduction of the white stork, which became extinct in Italy as a breeding species {{at the beginning of}} the eighteenth century. The site now includes a breeding centre for various endangered species of ducks, geese and swans—notably the <b>white-headed</b> <b>duck</b> which has been extinct in Italy since 1976—and an area of wetland where visitors can observe such migrants as black-winged stilt, little ringed plover and black-tailed godwit.|$|E
5000|$|Hybridization {{occurs when}} members of two {{different}} species mate {{with one another and}} produce viable offspring that carry genes from both parents. When an invasive species is much more abundant than a native relative, they may hybridize so often that the invaders genes [...] "flood" [...] the native species, such that no individuals contain the entire genotype of the native species, thus effectively driving the native species to extinction. For example, hybridization between Introduced mallards and the native Hawaiian duck (koloa maoli) and between the rarest European duck (the <b>white-headed</b> <b>duck)</b> and the invasive North American ruddy duck may result in the extinction of the native species.|$|E
50|$|Ruddy ducks were {{imported}} into the UK in 1948 by conservationist Sir Peter Scott. As {{a result of}} escapes from wildfowl collections in the late 1950s, they became established in Great Britain, from where they spread into Europe. By the year 2000, the population had increased to around 6,000 individuals. This duck's aggressive courting behavior and willingness to interbreed with the endangered native <b>white-headed</b> <b>duck</b> (Oxyura leucocephala), of southern Europe, caused concern amongst Spanish conservationists. Due to this, a controversial scheme to extirpate the ruddy duck as a British breeding species started; {{there have also been}} culling attempts in other European countries. By early 2014, the cull had reduced the British population to about 20-100, down from a peak of about 5500 in 2000.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>white-headed</b> <b>duck</b> (Oxyura leucocephala) {{is a small}} stiff-tailed duck some 45 cm long. The male has a white {{head with}} black crown, a blue bill, and reddish-grey plumage. The female has a dark bill and rather duller colouring. Its {{breeding}} habitat is lakes with open water and dense vegetation at the margin. It dives under water and feeds on aquatic vegetation {{as well as some}} animal matter. It is more likely to swim away from a perceived threat than to fly. This duck is known from Spain, North Africa, western and central Asia. Populations are declining, mostly due to loss of habitat and hunting, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated the bird's status as [...] "endangered".|$|E
