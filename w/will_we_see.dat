500|$|The {{resolution}} to this isolation and ineffectiveness is speaking out: restoring {{the voices of}} the people of Sunnydale. Shade states that this facet of the episode gives it a political overtone. Noel Murray from The A.V. Club writes that the silence imposed by The Gentlemen is a metaphor for how evil spreads: [...] "When dissent is stifled, or people fail to tell the truth, or when we’re just distracted by other concerns, things can get out of hand." [...] Authority figures in the series, such as the school principal, the mayor's office, and the Sunnydale Police Department, repeatedly either abet the town's endemic evil or choose not to hear about it. During [...] "Hush", at Giles' apartment the Scoobies listen to a newscaster reporting that authorities in the town attribute the silence to a flu vaccine gone awry, causing mass laryngitis. Wilcox writes, [...] "ow many times <b>will</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> those in power maintain such a silence while evil proceeds? It is not surprising that [...] attendants wear straitjackets; their garb suggests the insanity of such behavior—the pretense of civilized politeness while killing is accepted is a matter of course." ...|$|E
2500|$|The trikini {{appeared}} {{briefly in}} 1967, defined as [...] "a handkerchief {{and two small}} saucers." [...] It reappeared {{a few years ago}} as a bikini bottom with a stringed halter of two triangular pieces of cloth covering the breasts. The trikini top comes essentially in two separate parts. The name of this woman's bathing suit is formed from bikini, replacing [...] "bi-", meaning [...] "two", with [...] "tri-", meaning [...] "three". Writer William Safire wrote in The New York Times: [...] "Stripping to essentials, if the trikini is three pieces, the bikini two and the monokini one, when <b>will</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> the zerokini?" [...] Dolce & Gabbana designed trikinis for Summer 2005 as three pieces of scintillating fabric that barely cover the wearer. A variation on the bikini in which three pieces are sold together, such as a bikini with a tank top or a bikini with a one-piece suit is also sometimes called a Trikini, including a conventional two-piece with a glitzy band of rhinestones round the waist. Israeli designer Gideon Oberson, known for his artistically inspired bathing suits, calls a two-piece suit but looks like a tank top that can be worn with a skirt or a pair of shorts designed by him a trikini. Brazilian designer Amir Slama calls two scraps of silk connected with string he designed for skinny women a trikini. A variation called a strapless bikini or a no string bikini by various manufacturers, this swimwear is often a combination of pasties with a matching maebari-style bottom.|$|E

6000|$|This is what seamen do daily, {{and for one}} another. One lights {{occasionally}} upon different stories. It happened, {{not very}} long since, that the passengers {{by one of the}} great ocean steamers were wrecked, and, after undergoing the most severe hardships, were left, destitute and helpless, at a miserable coaling port. Amongst them were old men, ladies, and children. When the next steamer arrived, the passengers by that steamer took alarm at the haggard and miserable appearance of their unfortunate predecessors, and actually REMONSTRATED WITH THEIR OWN CAPTAIN, URGING HIM NOT TO TAKE THE POOR CREATURES ON BOARD. There was every excuse, of course. The last-arrived steamer was already dangerously full: the cabins were crowded; there were sick and delicate people on board--sick and delicate people who had paid a large price to the company for room, food, comfort, already not too sufficient. If fourteen of us are in an omnibus, <b>will</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> three or four women outside and say [...] "Come in, because this is the last 'bus, and it rains?"

Then we <b>will</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> you as one of us." [...] Romme did advise De Jong to become a member of the Catholic People's Party after six months. On 11 June 1959, De Jong reported back to Van den Bergh and was told about the new horizontal-structure, De Jong who was a proponent of a vertical-structure was left with a few remarks. The next day the meeting was continued in the presence of the incoming Secretary-General for the Ministry of Defence Duyverman who was going to be responsible for all financial and budgetary affairs for the Ministry of Defence. De Jong objected, he thought he could not be politically responsible as an Undersecretary if he wasn't responsible for all financial affairs for his own department, Van den Bergh became irritated with De Jongs position on the matter and the meeting was adjourned for June 16, 1959.|$|E
