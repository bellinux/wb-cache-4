Utilization of <b>waste</b> <b>heat</b> (<b>flue</b> gases) liberated by the Al-Hamra gas turbine power plant is analyzed in this research work for simultaneous production of: (a) electricity by combining steam rankine cycle using heat recovery steam generator (HRSG); (b) clean water by air gap membrane distillation (AGMD) plant; and (c) cooling by single stage vapor absorption chiller (VAC). The flue gases liberated from the gas turbine power cycle is the prime source of energy for the tri-generation system. The heat recovered from condenser of steam cycle and excess heat available at the flue gases are utilized to drive cooling and desalination cycles which are optimized based on the cooling energy demands of the villas. Economic and environmental benefits of the tri-generation system in terms of cost savings and reduction in carbon emissions were analyzed. Energy efficiency of about 82 %– 85 % is achieved by the tri-generation system compared to 50 %– 52 % for combined cycles.

40|$|Oxy-combustion is a {{promising}} technology for capturing CO 2 from coal based power plants. In a coal based oxy-combustion power plant coal is combusted with high purity oxygen {{in order to}} produce steam for power production. The flue gas from this combustion consists mainly of H 2 O and CO 2, but it will also be polluted with other components due to in-leakage of air, impurities in the coal, excess oxygen in the combustion and diluted oxygen supply. The main separation processes in such a power plant takes place in an air separation unit (ASU) where oxygen is separated from nitrogen, and in the compression and purification unit (CPU) where the CO 2 in the flue gas is separated from the H 2 O and the other pollutants and compressed for transportation and storage. The introduction of these two units causes an efficiency penalty to the power plant. In this master thesis it is studied if and how heat integration of low temperature heat can decrease the efficiency penalty related to the ASU and CPU. The base case power plant is a coal based oxy-combustion power plant with a 567 MW net power output and a thermal efficiency 31, 32 %. The heat sources considered are the heat which is removed by intercoolers in the compressors in the ASU and CPU, and <b>waste</b> <b>heat</b> from the <b>flue</b> gas exiting the steam generator. It is also studied if lifting the temperature level of the compression heat by compressing adiabatically will increase the potential for heat integration. Three main cases are considered for integration; integrating compression <b>heat</b> and <b>waste</b> <b>heat</b> from the <b>flue</b> gas with the feedwater system in the steam cycle of the power plant, integrating compression <b>heat</b> or <b>flue</b> gas <b>heat</b> to increase preheat of the recycled flue gas and oxygen entering the combustion, and integrating <b>waste</b> <b>heat</b> from the <b>flue</b> gas with a CO 2 Rankine Cycle. It was found that integration of compression heat with the feedwater can increase the thermal efficiency of the power plant by 1, 19 % if the compressors are operated with intercooling and 1, 49 % if adiabatic compression is utilized. If the <b>flue</b> gas <b>heat</b> is also integrated, the efficiency increases by 1, 72 % with intercooled compression and 1, 96 % with adiabatic compression. Utilizing <b>flue</b> gas <b>heat</b> to preheat the recycled flue gas and oxygen can give efficiency increases in the region of 0, 3 - 0, 7 %. The same applies if compression heat is utilized for this preheating. Since the temperature level of the recycled flue gas and oxygen is low, {{it is not necessary to}} compress adiabatically. If the <b>waste</b> <b>heat</b> in the <b>flue</b> gas is integrated with a CO 2 Rankine cycle, efficiency improvements in the region of 0, 47 to 0, 51 % can be obtained. The integration projects discussed in this report will increase the complexity of the system and may increase equipment costs. It is necessary to do a more detailed analysis of the heat exchanger networks required to reach the energy targets and heat exchanger surface area requirements in order to properly estimate the costs and choose the optimal configuration for integration. However it is recommended that future studies focus on the use of adiabatic compression heat as it has been shown to give significant increases in efficiency. Whether or not to include the flue gas in the integration depends on whether or not it is cost-efficient to introduce corrosion resistant heat exchangers to cool it below the acidic dew point. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{application}} of numerical simulations using the {{computational fluid dynamics}} (CFD) analysis when mapping processes {{in the course of}} which the heat transmission occurs has become {{an essential part of the}} heat transfer systems. The present contribution deals with the possibility to use the <b>waste</b> <b>heat</b> of the <b>flue</b> gas produced by small microturbines. The <b>waste</b> <b>heat</b> is mapped by means of both the numerical simulations applying the FLUENT software and the practical experiment. Utilizing a part of the <b>waste</b> <b>heat</b> for water heating and decreasing the outlet temperature of the flue gas into atmosphere when applying in co-generating units represents one of the partial benefits. The present paper brings information concerning the newly designed type of heat exchanger including the results of its numerical analysis. The analysed heat exchanger designed in the system with microturbine (MT) C 30 reached generally the efficiency of 75 %. Both the results of simulations and the carried out practical experiment confirmed the temperature of the flue gas to be sufficient behind the exchanger to prevent the condensation of water from the flue gas. On the contrary, except for heating water the exchanger under consideration offers – thanks to its design – also other possibilities to use of the flue gas. The practical experiment confirmed the results of the CFD prediction with rather small differences as the temperature of water obtained from the exchanger was 359 K and the designed shape of the exchanger did not result in substantial pressure losses in flue gas approximately 50 Pa. The mean logarithmic temperature difference of the mapped and verified exchanger was ∼ 203 K. Web of Science 5519 - 205342533...|$|R
40|$|Condensing boilers achieve higher {{efficiency}} {{than traditional}} boilers by using <b>waste</b> <b>heat</b> in <b>flue</b> gases to preheat cold return water entering the boiler. Water vapor produced during combustion is condensed into liquid form, thus recovering its latent heat of vaporization, leading to around 10 – 12 % increased efficiency. Many countries have encouraged the use of condensing boilers with financial incentives. It is thus important to develop software tools to assess the correct functioning of the boiler and eventually detect problems. Current monitoring tools are based on boiler static maps and on large sets of historical data, and are unable to assess timely loss of performance due to degradation of the efficiency curve or water leakages. This work develops a set of fault detection and diagnosis tools for dynamic energy efficiency monitoring and assessment in condensing boilers, i. e. performance degradation and faults can be detected using real-time measurements: this real-time feature is particularly relevant because of the limited amount of data that can be stored by state-of-the-art building energy management systems. The monitoring tools are organized as follows: a bimodal parameter estimator to detect deviations of {{the efficiency of the}} boiler from nominal values in both condensing and noncondensing mode; a virtual sensor for the estimation of the water mass flow rate; filters to detect actuator and sensor faults, possibly due to control and sensing problems. Most importantly, structural properties for detection and isolation of actuators and sensing faults are given: these properties are crucial to understand which faults can be diagnosed given the available measurements. The effectiveness of these tools is verified via extensive simulations. Hybrid and Distributed Systems and Contro...|$|R
40|$|This master thesis report {{looks into}} the energy usage of a modern heat {{treating}} facility at the bearing manufacturer SKF in Gothenburg. In this report background studies on heat treatment, furnace technologies and energy aspects have been performed and compiled into a theoretical base. The {{main body of the}} work has revolved around the two approach methods, interviews with experts in the field energy and heat treatment and empirical data gathering, and the outcome of this approach method. The study has covered all the stages involved in heat treatment such as pre-washing, to post washing. The type of heat treatment that has been performed in this facility has mainly been bainitic hardening. In order to compare the results an overviewing study of another bainitic hardening facility on SKF was made. The outcome of the study was that the important factors to consider when improving energy efficiency on a heat treating facility is to first of all to establish what the current situation is, and use this as a base line. Areas which are important to address to optimize the energy performance of the facility is to make sure the burners are efficient, have low surface losses, keep the utilization of the facility high and recover as much as possible of the <b>waste</b> <b>heat.</b> The most suitable {{way to do this is}} to use the <b>waste</b> <b>heat</b> from the <b>flue</b> gases in the pre- or post-wash. For this particular facility it was found that the most energy effective measure would be to upgrade burner to regenerative models, lower the surface temperature with 20 K, pre heat ingoing atmospheric gases with the hot outgoing atmospheric gases and finally <b>heat</b> exchange the <b>flue</b> gases with the post wash. This will lead to energy savings of about 18 %...|$|R
