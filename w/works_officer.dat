By mid-1946 5ACS was engaged in work on these airfields, building small forward airstrips for army reconnaissance aircraft and maintaining another four airfields in BCOF's area of responsibility. These tasks were of great importance to the BCOF, and Australian aviation historian Alan Stephens has written that [...] "No.5 ACS's achievements were probably the most significant of any Australian unit—land, sea or air" [...] during the occupation of Japan.

Accordingly, 5ACS' remaining responsibilities were gradually transferred to the <b>works</b> <b>officer</b> of No.77 Squadron and the squadron was disbanded at Iwakuni on 30June 1949.|$|E
