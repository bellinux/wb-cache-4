40|$|One of {{the running}} themes in this course {{is the notion of}} {{approximate}} solutions. Of course, this notion is tossed around in applied work a lot: whenever the exact solution seems hard to achieve, you do your best and call the resulting solution an approximation. In theoretical work, approximation has a more precise meaning whereby you prove that the solution in hand is close to the exact or optimum solution in some precise metric. <b>We</b> <b>saw</b> some <b>earlier</b> examples of approximation in sampling-based algorithms; for instance our hashing-based estimator for set size. It produces an answer that is whp within (1 +ɛ) of the true answer. Today we will see many other examples that rely upon linear programming (LP).

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that {{temperature}} rise leads to an earlier onset of spring in wild plant species and that farmers are not keeping track of climate change. Crop growth models and experiments show yield gains to be obtained from earlier sowing. Why do farmers not sow earlier? We propose simple models on the relation between several weather variables and farmers’ sowing dates and test these models with 392 observed weekly sugar beet sowing percentages in the Netherlands. Data showed no correlation between spring temperature and sowing dates. However when we corrected for number of frost days in spring, <b>we</b> clearly <b>saw</b> <b>earlier</b> sowing at higher temperatures. Frost causes crumbling of the soil resulting in a nice seedbed; farmers sow later when there have been less frost days. Temperature rise “makes” farmers sow earlier, but the number or frost days simultaneously decreases and this “makes” farmers sow later. The combined effect is that temperature rise leads to only a small net advance in sowing date, 2 days per 1 °C according to our model. Many climate change studies have assumed advances in sowing date are often larger than likely based on historical trends and models developed in this paper. Such studies may well be overly optimistic in projected yield gains that follow from earlier sowing. Our results also revealed that sowing dates were correlated with the sum of solar radiation over the preceding 7 – 10 months. This correlation remained significant also when other weather variables (rain, temperature, frost days) were accounted for. Our work raises the question what is the process causing this correlation and does such correlation with radiation sum also show up in other time series of phenological events or human behaviou...|$|R

5000|$|Stoic {{philosophy}} {{begins with}} Zeno of Citium c.300 BC, and {{was developed by}} Cleanthes (331 - 232 BC) and Chrysippus (c.280-c.206 BC) into a formidable systematic unity. Zeno believed happiness was a [...] "good flow of life"; Cleanthes suggested it was [...] "living in agreement with nature", and Chrysippus believed it was [...] "living in accordance with experience of what happens by nature." [...] Stoic ethics is a particularly strong version of eudaimonism. According to the Stoics, virtue is necessary and sufficient for eudaimonia. (This thesis is generally regarded as stemming from the Socrates of Plato's earlier dialogues.) <b>We</b> <b>saw</b> <b>earlier</b> that the conventional Greek concept of arete is {{not quite the same}} as that denoted by virtue, which has Christian connotations of charity, patience, and uprightness, since arete includes many non-moral virtues such as physical strength and beauty. However, the Stoic concept of arete is much nearer to the Christian conception of virtue, which refers to the moral virtues. However, unlike Christian understandings of virtue, righteousness or piety, the Stoic conception does not place as great an emphasis on mercy, forgiveness, self-abasement (i.e. the ritual process of declaring complete powerlessness and humility before God), charity and self-sacrificial love, though these behaviors/mentalities are not necessarily spurned by the Stoics (they are spurned by some other philosophers of Antiquity). Rather Stoicism emphasizes states such as justice, honesty, moderation, simplicity, self-discipline, resolve, fortitude, and courage (states which Christianity also encourages).|$|E
60|$|This possibility, of {{knowledge}} of general propositions of which no instance can be given, is often denied, {{because it is not}} perceived that the knowledge of such propositions only requires a knowledge of the relations of universals, and does not require any knowledge of instances of the universals in question. Yet the knowledge of such general propositions is quite vital to a great deal of what is generally admitted to be known. For example, <b>we</b> <b>saw,</b> in our <b>early</b> chapters, that knowledge of physical objects, as opposed to sense-data, is only obtained by an inference, and that they are not things with which we are acquainted. Hence we can never know any proposition of the form 'this is a physical object', where 'this' is something immediately known. It follows that all our knowledge concerning physical objects is such that no actual instance can be given. We can give instances of the associated sense-data, but we cannot give instances of the actual physical objects. Hence our knowledge as to physical objects depends throughout upon this possibility of general knowledge where no instance can be given. And the same applies to our knowledge of other people's minds, or of any other class of things of which no instance is known to us by acquaintance.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the many}} {{advantages}} of group living is the swift transfer of information between group members. Social learning – learning from others – offers a quick and economical way to acquire information about the local environment and is considered adaptive under {{a wide range of}} circumstances. However, social information can be unreliable or quickly become outdated in rapidly changing environments. Thus flexibility in the utilization of social learning, depending on the associated costs and benefits, would be expected to be advantageous in most situations. Early environment {{plays a major role in}} shaping the morphological, physiological or behavioural phenotype of an animal, and conditions and experiences during early life can potentially prepare (or program) a developing individual for the environment it will encounter when adult. In this project we examined whether social behaviours such as grouping and social learning could be influenced by early life conditions and to what extent. For this purpose, we used two different strains of the guppy (domestic and wild-origin), Poecilia reticulata, a popular study system in behavioural and evolutionary ecology with well-described social behaviour. Overall, we found evidence for consistency and heritability in grouping behaviour, but although grouping tendencies were (to some extent) correlated with social learning propensities, we found no evidence for consistency and heritability in social learning. Furthermore, <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> that <b>early</b> environmental conditions and experiences play a major role in shaping the behavioural phenotype of an individual. We found that both cues about the value of social information and context cues like predation risk and population density in early life, can influence an individual’s reliance on social information later in life. Moreover, as males and females differ significantly in their strategies to maximise fitness and survival, these early life cues can affect the behaviour of the two sexes in different ways...|$|R
40|$|The {{narrative}} of black marriage as citizenship enhancing has been pervasive in American history. As we mark the fiftieth {{anniversary of the}} Moynihan Report and prepare to celebrate the 150 th anniversary of Thirteenth Amendment, this Article argues that this narrative is one that we should resist. The complete story of marriage is one that involves racial subordination and caste. Even as the Supreme Court stands to extend marriage rights to LGBT couples, the Article maintains that we should embrace nonmarriage as a legitimate frame for black loving relationships — gay or straight. Nonmarriage might do just as much, if not more, to advance black civil rights. Part I explores marriage’s role in racial subordination {{by looking at the}} experiences of African Americans, as well as Native Americans, Puerto Ricans, and Asian Americans. Drawing on institutional structure analyses, it then considers how legal marriage has “married” Blacks to second-class citizenship. Part II explores the current place of marriage in African America. It argues that, while the regulation of black loving relationships today differs dramatically from what <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> in <b>earlier</b> times, family law often has a punitive effect on such American families. Part III contemplates the benefits of adopting a focus on nonmarriage. It contends that meeting black families where they are holds the most potential for progress in addressing the structural barriers to success faced by those families. The Article ends with a “call to action” for legal scholars and others concerned about black families and citizenship.

Here, by introducing different directions (theta) of the applied field with respect to the unidirectional anisotropy direction, we have varied two different energy parameters: (i) the exchange anisotropy for each layer, (ii) the ferromagnetic anisotropy. Our polarized neutron measurements thus show a gradual crossover from layer flipping (domain-wall motion) for low torque regimes of the effective field to coherent rotation for high torque regimes. We explain these findings within a general and simple model where the angular dependencies for reversal are guided by the relative strengths of Zeeman, exchange, and anisotropy energies...|$|E
40|$|Constructionist {{theories}} {{hold that}} learning will be deeper if students develop {{and share their}} own diverse understandings of a concept. College students are immersed in a community with its social norms, learning practices {{and an understanding of}} authority and the classroom contract. This situation makes it difficult for the students to have diverse understandings of a concept. This paper addresses how this affects the nature and diversity of representations students create for collaborative learning, and their perceptions of the quality of representations created by their peers. We redesigned and deployed a CSCL system with the goals of facilitating learning by leveraging students' current collaborative learning practices and changing their perceptions of authority. We present summary results from two studies, which are part of an ongoing research program investigating these questions. In prior research we found that students have a strong sense of which style of representation is authoritative, and that this can lead to premature convergence and the suppression of alternative viewpoints. Results from the current studies indicate that creating, sharing and evaluating representations through a CSCL system improve learning. Furthermore, careful design of the CSCL system and learning activities can indeed lead to an increase in the diversity of created representations, avoiding some problems <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> previously with <b>early</b> convergence. However, authority still influences representational creation and evaluation. We revisit our design goals and recommendations in light of these results...|$|R
