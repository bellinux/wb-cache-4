5|$|Max Allan Collins, who {{authored}} {{the graphic}} novel, {{was hired to}} write the novelization for the film adaptation. Collins initially turned in a draft that contained 90,000 <b>words,</b> <b>but</b> the licensing at DreamWorks required the author to use only the dialogue from the film and no additional dialogue. Collins reluctantly edited the novelization down to 50,000 words and later said he regretted taking on the task.|$|E
5|$|On the {{one hand}} he must not enforce {{whatever}} he thinks best; he must leave that to the common will expressed by the government. On the other, he must try as best he can to put into concrete form what that will is, not by slavishly following the <b>words,</b> <b>but</b> by trying honestly to say what was the underlying purpose expressed.|$|E
5|$|There are few {{compound}} <b>words,</b> <b>but</b> lots of derivations. The grammar {{employs a}} mixture of head and dependent marking: both agent and patient are marked on the predicate and the possessor is marked on nouns, while dependent noun phrases inflect for case. The morphosyntactic alignment of Kalaallisut is ergative.|$|E

5|$|Stress {{plays an}} {{important}} role in English. Certain syllables are stressed, while others are unstressed. Stress is a combination of duration, intensity, vowel quality, and sometimes changes in pitch. Stressed syllables are pronounced longer and louder than unstressed syllables, and vowels in unstressed syllables are frequently reduced while vowels in stressed syllables are not. Some words, primarily short function <b>words</b> <b>but</b> also some modal verbs such as can, have weak and strong forms depending on whether they occur in stressed or non-stressed position within a sentence.|$|E
5|$|Demosthenes {{tailored}} {{his style}} {{to be very}} audience-specific. He took pride in not relying on attractive <b>words</b> <b>but</b> rather simple, effective prose. He was mindful of his arrangement, he used clauses to create patterns that would make seemingly complex sentences easy for the hearer to follow. His tendency to focus on delivery promoted him to use repetition, this would ingrain the importance into the audience's minds; he also relied on speed and delay to create suspense and interest among the audience when presenting to most important aspects of his speech. One of his most effective skills was his ability to strike a balance: his works were complex so that the audience would not be offended by any elementary language, {{but the most important}} parts were clear and easily understood.|$|E
25|$|Word {{boundaries}} sometimes changed, with clitics being often originally written solid {{with the}} adjacent <b>words,</b> <b>but</b> now written separately.|$|E

25|$|One or more {{of these}} stems may be {{identical}} for some <b>words,</b> <b>but</b> this is generally not regularly predictable from either the nominative singular or the citation form stem.|$|E

60|$|Kokua said never a <b>word,</b> <b>but</b> {{she looked}} at the sea and laughed.|$|R
25|$|The 1999 example {{demonstrates}} the current convention for published work. The 1894 version demonstrates thin-spaced <b>words</b> <b>but</b> em-spaced sentences. It also demonstrates spaces around punctuation {{according to the}} rules above and equivalent to French typesetting today.|$|E
25|$|Like all dialects, Erzgebirgisch {{has some}} words which are {{difficult}} to grasp for outsiders. These include contractions of long <b>words,</b> <b>but</b> also some words unknown to other dialects or even other subdialects of the same lineage.|$|E
25|$|This {{is one of}} the runestones at Aspa and is {{classified}} as being carved in runestone style RAK. It was engraved with both long-branch runes and staveless runes. In the last row all the <b>words</b> <b>but</b> the last one were written with staveless runes.|$|E

50|$|The school motto was Non Verbis, Sed Virtute (not by <b>word,</b> <b>but</b> by deed).|$|R
25|$|Pictish {{is thought}} to have {{influenced}} the development of modern Scottish Gaelic. This is perhaps most obvious in the contribution of loan <b>words,</b> <b>but</b> more importantly it is thought that Pictish influenced the syntax of Scottish Gaelic, which bears greater similarity to Brittonic languages than does Irish.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps I have a {{bias toward}} facts over <b>words,</b> <b>but</b> I say {{the reality of}} Iranian civility toward Jews tells us more about Iran – its sophistication and culture – than all the {{inflammatory}} rhetoric. That may be because I'm a Jew and have seldom been treated with such consistent warmth as in Iran.|$|E
25|$|To {{point out}} 'essential Zen-teachings' is almost impossible, given {{the variety of}} schools, the {{extended}} history of 1500 years, and the emphasis on suchness, reality just-as-it-is, which has to be expressed in daily life, not in <b>words.</b> <b>But</b> common to most schools and teachings is this emphasis on suchness and Buddha-nature, the Bodhisattva-ideal, and the priority of zazen.|$|E

They eventually released {{a modified version of the}} same ad, just avoiding the use of Josipović's own voice.|$|E
25|$|Davidson {{argues that}} because the {{language}} is compositional, it is also holistic: sentences {{are based on the}} meanings of <b>words,</b> <b>but</b> the meaning of a word depends on the totality of sentences in which it appears. That holistic constraint, along with the requirement that the theory of truth is law-like, suffices to minimize indeterminacy just enough for successful communication to occur.|$|E
25|$|Subjoined ਹ(h): behaves {{the same}} way as the regular ਹ(h) in non-word-initial positions. The regular ਹ(h) is {{pronounced}} at the beginning of <b>words</b> <b>but</b> not in other positions, where it instead raises the tone. The difference in usage is that the regular ਹ is used after vowels and the subscript version when there is no vowel, and is attached to consonants.|$|E
