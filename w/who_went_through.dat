5|$|Marcos {{initially}} {{needed to}} win votes of the delegates of the Nacionalista Party for the presidential candidacy. Imelda assumed the managerial position in her husband's campaign. The other candidates of the party noted her enthusiasm during the campaign; she met with and befriended every single delegate of the 1,347 who would {{have a say in}} the Nacionalista Party Convention. She would talk with each of them, visit them in their own homes, and attend gatherings such as birthday parties, anniversaries, and weddings. Of all the presidential candidates' wives, Imelda was the only one <b>who</b> <b>went</b> <b>through</b> a detailed and personal campaign for her husband. On November 21, 1964, Ferdinand Marcos won the presidential nomination for the Nacionalista Party.|$|E
5|$|Tréluyer {{was delayed}} by slower traffic, {{allowing}} Conway to overtake him for fourth position before the Audi driver ran wide at the Bus Stop chicane. Van der Garde's car's sustained a damaged mirror and was ordered by race control {{to have it}} repaired at his scheduled pit stop. Buemi closed the gap to Lucas di Grassi in Audi's No. 8 entry and attempted to pass him driving into Eau Rouge and Raidillon but di Grassi was able to pull away on the Kemmel Straight. Buemi moved to the outside line at Blanchimont and moved in front of di Grassi, <b>who</b> <b>went</b> <b>through</b> grass, at the Bus Stop chicane for second place. Marino Franchitti's No. 67 Ford made contact with Aguas's car at Les Combes but both drivers were able to continue, although Augas lost the LMGTE Am lead. Conway locked his tyres and collided heavily with Victor Shaytar's delayed No. 37 SMP Racing car going into the Bus Stop chicane while attempting {{to close the gap}} to di Grassi. Conway immediately drove into the pit lane for repairs to his car's front-end. Both Porsche cars made pit stops after 49 minutes which saw Jani taking over Lieb's driving duties while Hartley switched positions with Bernhard.|$|E

25|$|Female genital {{mutilation}} (also referred as FGM) {{is a common}} case of {{genital mutilation}}. The act has been practiced in parts of Africa for centuries, but after the United Nations made recommendations in its Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), in the present times, many nations such as Ghana and Egypt have placed laws stopping the practice of FGM through legal means. Despite these laws, FGM continues to be practiced in the communities. In Egypt, FGM is banned by ministerial health decree and not in federal law as of 2007, but FGM is a prevalent practice in Egypt with 90% or more prevalence in girls and women between fifteen and forty-nine years of age. 90% of girls <b>who</b> <b>went</b> <b>through</b> FGM were under fourteen years old. Additionally, an estimated 90% of the procedures are done by doctors or other trained medical personnel. In January 2015 Raslan Fadl, a doctor, became the first in Egypt to be convicted of FGM, following an appeal of his acquittal of the manslaughter of Sohair al-Bataa during an FGM procedure. He was sentenced {{to two years in}} jail for manslaughter plus three months for the FGM.|$|E

25|$|The {{format of}} the {{competition}} changed from 1954: 16 teams still competed in four groups of four, but this time each team played {{each of the other}} teams in its group at least once, without extra time {{in the event of a}} draw. Two points were awarded for a win and one point for a draw. If the first two teams finished on equal points then goal average would decide who was placed first and second. As in 1954, if the second and third placed teams finished on the same points, then there would be a play-off with the winner going through. If a play-off resulted in a draw, goal average from the group games would be used to determine <b>who</b> <b>went</b> <b>through</b> to the next round. If the goal averages were equal then lots would have been drawn. These arrangements had not been finalised by the time the tournament started and were still being debated as it progressed. Some teams complained that a play-off match, meaning three games in five days, was too much, and before the second round of group matches FIFA informed the teams that goal average would be used before resorting to a play-off. This was overturned when the Swedish Football Association complained, ostensibly that it was wrong to change the rules mid-tournament, but also because it wanted the extra revenue from playoff matches.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, Al-Ahly won the Egyptian Premier League (2006–2007) for {{the third}} {{successive}} season. Aboutrika scored 7 goals for his team, although he was injured.

Aboutrika made a one neck-saving equalizer in the last 2 minutes on 2 July 2007 in the Egypt Cup resulting in extra-time after tying 2–2. After El-Zamalek grabbed their third {{in the first half}} of extra-time, Aboutrika dazzeled the stands with two great balls, one an assisted cross over the whites' defense to Osama Hosny to score the equalizer in second half of extra-time in the first seconds of the game and within a minute, he surged between the Zamalek's midfield and passed two Zamalek players before providing an accurate through pass to Ahmad Sedik on the wing <b>who</b> <b>went</b> <b>through</b> on goal and assisted again for Osama Hosny for the late winner and holding high the Egyptian Cup.

25|$|Before {{the start}} of the 2005 season, Helena agreed a deal to return to her former club KR as manager of the women's team later that year in place of Íris Eysteinsdóttir, who was to take {{maternity}} leave. Helena took charge of the team on 4 August 2005, initially on a temporary basis {{until the end of the}} campaign. The same evening, she led KR to a 7–0 win against FH, although this was to be the last victory of the season as KR went on to finish in fourth place. The team was then defeated in the Women's Cup final on 10 September 2005, losing 4–1 to Breiðablik. On 29 October 2005, she was appointed manager of KR on a permanent deal, signing a two-year contract with the club. She guided the side to a fourth-place finish in the Úrvalsdeild in 2006, despite the team winning by ten or more goals on four occasions. A number of new signings were made ahead of the 2007 campaign including Edda Garðarsdóttir and Ólína Viðarsdóttir, who both arrived from Breiðablik. The team improved by two places on their previous league position, finishing as runners-up at the end of the season.

Among {{these three}} pursuits, his {{greatest}} achievements were attained on the cricket field; {{he played in}} 12 Tests for Australia from 1948 to 1951.

After being dropped from the national team, Loxton represented Victoria for seven more seasons before retiring from first-class cricket. He served as an administrator after his playing days were over and spent 24 years as a Liberal Party member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly.
