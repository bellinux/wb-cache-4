500|$|Rolling Stone ranked [...] "Imagine" [...] {{number three}} on {{its list of}} [...] "The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time", {{describing}} it as [...] "an enduring hymn of solace and promise that has carried us through extreme grief, from the shock of Lennon's own death in 1980 to the unspeakable horror of September 11th. It is now impossible to imagine a world without 'Imagine', and <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>it</b> more than he ever dreamed." [...] Despite that sentiment, Clear Channel Communications included the song on its post-9/11 [...] "do not play" [...] list.|$|E

I hope it's real. I hope it's not just an election promise. [...] <b>We</b> <b>need</b> <b>it</b> and <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>it</b> right now. But I'm still somewhat skeptical. This has been done before for cynical electoral politics." ...|$|E

2500|$|Dr. Donna Nelson {{from the}} University of Oklahoma {{approached}} us several seasons back and said, [...] "I really like this show, {{and if you}} ever need help with the chemistry, I'd love to lend a hand." [...] She's been a wonderful advisor. We get help wherever <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>it,</b> whether it's chemistry, electrical engineering, or physics. We try to get everything correct.

2500|$|In March 2010, Prime Minister Papandreou of Greece {{wrote an}} op-ed in the International Herald Tribune, {{in which he}} said, [...] "Democratic governments {{worldwide}} must establish a new global financial architecture, as bold {{in its own way}} as Bretton Woods, as bold as the creation of the European Community and European Monetary Union.

60|$|All {{we should}} do, instead of boasting, is to bless God that he {{revealed}} to us just what <b>we</b> <b>needed,</b> {{and at the}} very time at which <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> <b>it,</b> and confess that it is HE that giveth us power to get wealth.

Moreover, civil defense was not solely a US-UK or nuclear club phenomenon, countries with long histories of neutrality, such as Switzerland, are [...] "foremost in their civil defence precautions." [...] The Swiss civil defense network has an overcapacity of nuclear fallout shelters for the country's population size, and by law, new homes must still be built with a fallout shelter as of 2011.|$|E
