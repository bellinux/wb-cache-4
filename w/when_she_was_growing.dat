500|$|Eddy {{responded to}} the early {{installments}} in McClure's by challenging its description of her father, early family life, and the issues surrounding her marriages. McClure's had said that the Bible was the only book in the house <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>growing</b> up; on the contrary, she wrote, {{her father was a}} great reader. To counter McClure's claim that her childhood home had provided a [...] "lonely and unstimulating existence", her statement described the educational and professional achievements of her family. In response to McClure's description of her as bad tempered, she offered as an example of her own kindness that a housekeeper of the family's had resigned because Eddy allowed a blind girl, who had knocked on the door and was unknown to the family, to stay with them.|$|E
500|$|<b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>growing</b> up, Aaliyah {{attended}} Detroit {{schools and}} {{believed she was}} well-liked, but got teased for her short stature. She recalled coming into her own prior to age 15 and grew to love her height. Her mother would tell her to be happy that she was small and compliment her. Other children disliked Aaliyah, {{but she did not}} stay focused on them. [...] "You always have to deal with people who are jealous, but there were so few it didn't even matter. The majority of kids supported me, which was wonderful. When it comes to dealing with negative people, I just let it in one ear and out the other. Those people were invisible to me." [...] Even in her adult life, she considered herself small. She had [...] "learned to accept and love" [...] herself and added: [...] "...the {{most important thing is to}} think highly of yourself because if you don't, no one else will".|$|E

Featuring John Abraham and Neil Nitin Mukesh in lead roles, the film tells the story of how three friends' lives are changed when the former is wrongly detained after 9/11. Kaif played Maya, a college student who later marries a terrorist. The actress said that she identified with Maya, since she experienced similar isolation because of her skin colour <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>growing</b> up in London. Kaif also remarked that she was tired of [...] "arm candy" [...] roles and was looking for more substantial parts. New York did well at the box office and received favourable reviews.

500|$|Off-screen Wolfenden, Hardwick and Chittel {{were thrilled}} by Amy's inclusion. Wolfenden said Halfpenny's acting skill has [...] "freshened {{the whole place}} up." [...] In comparison, David was {{initially}} hostile to Amy's inclusion in his family. However, in one storyline his attitude towards her softens and results in Amy developing feelings for him. Wolfenden said David [...] "has {{a soft spot for}} Amy" [...] and flirted with her. Over time he began to see her as his [...] "little sister." [...] When David's girlfriend, Leyla Harding (Roxy Shahidi) accuses Amy of stealing from the shop, David proves her innocence by exposing Alicia Gallagher (Natalie Anderson) as the thief. Wolfenden added that David has given out the wrong signals and acted naive during the story arc. Wolfenden explained that Amy misreads the signs because [...] "she never had that sort of affection <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>growing</b> up." [...] Amy kisses David which shocks him, though Wolfenden felt it should not surprise him. Amy lies to her best friend Victoria Sugden (Isabel Hodgins), claiming she has slept with him and runs away from home.|$|E
500|$|Described {{as one of}} [...] "R's most {{important}} artists" [...] during the 1990s, her second studio album, One in a Million, {{became one of the}} most influential R albums of the decade. Music critic Simon Reynolds cited [...] "Are You That Somebody?" [...] as [...] "the most radical pop single" [...] of 1998. Kelefah Sanneh of The New York Times wrote that rather than being the song's focal point, Aaliyah [...] "knew how to disappear into the music, how to match her voice to the bass line", and consequently [...] "helped change the way popular music sounds; the twitchy, beat-driven songs of Destiny's Child owe a clear debt to 'Are You That Somebody'." [...] Sanneh asserted that by the time of her death in 2001, Aaliyah [...] "had recorded some of the most innovative and influential pop songs of the last five years." [...] Music publication Popdust called Aaliyah an unlikely queen of the underground due mainly to her influence on the underground alternative music scene, which consists of heavy sampling and references to her music by underground artists. Popdust also mentioned that the forward-thinking music Aaliyah did with Timbaland and the experimental music being made by many underground alternative artists are somewhat cut from the same cloth. While compiling a list of artists that take cues from Aaliyah, MTV Hive mentioned that it's easy to spot her influence on underground movements like dubstep, strains of indie pop, and lo-fi R movements. With sales of 8.1 million albums in the United States and an estimated 24 to 32 million albums worldwide, Aaliyah earned the nicknames [...] "Princess of R" [...] and [...] "Queen of Urban Pop", as she [...] "proved she was a muse in her own right". Ernest Hardy of Rolling Stone dubbed her as the [...] "undisputed queen of the midtempo come-on". Aaliyah has been referred to as a pop icon and a R icon for her impact and contributions to those respective genres. Japanese pop singer Hikaru Utada has said several times that [...] "It was when I heard Aaliyah's Age Ain't Nothing but a Number that I got hooked on R", after which Utada released her debut album First Love with heavy R influences. Another Japanese pop singer Crystal Kay has expressed how she admired Aaliyah <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>growing</b> up and how she would practice dancing while watching her music videos.|$|E

Gillan was reportedly the last to audition for the role, and stood out as she was [...] "a bit kookier" [...] than the others.

According to The Huffington Post, with a growing Latino audience, [...] "there is more demand for television programming around that audience. Until now, there have only been a few networks focused on this demographic, and really none focused on providing Latino cultural content in English". Lopez told USA Today that <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>growing</b> up there was very little programming that appealed to her heritage, stating that: [...] "Growing up in the Bronx as a little Puerto Rican girl watching TV and not having a lot to identify with. West Side Story was really my favorite thing because it had Puerto Ricans in it". Lopez explained that her partnership with nuvoTV marked a natural step in her career.

2500|$|Many of {{her other}} {{photographs}} containing her nude or hurt children caused controversy. For example, in [...] "The Perfect Tomato," [...] the viewer sees a nude Jessie, posing on a picnic table outside, bathed in light. Jessie told Steven Cantor during the filming {{of one of his}} movies that she had just been playing around and her mother told her to freeze, and she tried to capture the image in a rush because the sun was setting. This explains why everything is blurred except for the tomato, hence the photograph's title. This image was likely criticized for Jessie’s nudity and presentation of the adolescent female form. While Jessie was aware of this photograph, Dana Cox, in her essay, said that the Mann children were probably unaware of the other photographs being taken as Mann’s children were often naked because “it came natural to them.” This habit of nudity is a family thing because Mann says she used to walk around her house naked <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>growing</b> up. Cox states that “the own artist’s childhood is reflected in the way she captures moments in her children’s lives.” One image that deals more with another aspect of childhood besides [...] "naked play", Jessie's Cut, shows Jessie's head, wrapped in what appears to be plastic, with blood running down the side of her face from the cut above her left eye. The cut is stitched and the blood is dry and stains her skin. As painful as the image looks, there are a great number of viewers who could relate to Jessie when they think about the broken bones and stitched up cuts they had during childhood.|$|E
