Highly changeable and slightly changeable flow-conditions tests were performed on reactors equipped with non-woven geo-textile <b>filters.</b> Hydraulic conductivity <b>of</b> <b>filter</b> <b>material</b> coupons was determined.

40|$|The {{roughness}} of superhydrophobic silicone nanofilaments (SNFs) is exploited {{to enlarge}} the contact area <b>of</b> conventional <b>filter</b> <b>material.</b> As an efficient wetting <b>of</b> the <b>filter</b> <b>material</b> is crucial for water treatment, the wettability of SNFs is readily modified from superhydrophobic to hydrophilic during the functionalization process. SNFs are coated on glass beads and subsequently modified with biocidal silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). The enlarged surface area of SNFs allows a 30 times higher loading of AgNPs in comparison to glass beads without SNF coating. Thus, in column experiments, the AgNP-SNF-nanocomposite-modified glass beads exert superior antibacterial activity towards suspensions of E. coli K 12 compared to AgNP functionalized glass beads without SNFs. Additionally, reusing the AgNP-SNF-nanocomposite-coated glass beads with fresh bacteria contaminated medium increases their efficacy and reduces the colony forming units by ‚âà 6 log units. Thereby, the silver loss during percolation is below 0. 1 Œºg mL‚àí 1.
