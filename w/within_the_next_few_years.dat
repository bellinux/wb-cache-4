5|$|After the First Opium War, Hong Kong was ceded to the British in the Treaty of Nanking and {{the colony}} {{soon became a}} popular {{stopover}} for missionaries travelling onwards to China. The parish was established in 1842 by Theodore Joset, the first Prefect Apostolic of Hong Kong, and work began on a new and permanent church soon afterwards. The new church was located at the junction of Pottinger Street and Wellington Street. Construction was completed in 1843. <b>Within</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>years,</b> the number of Catholics in the parish grew significantly, {{partly due to the}} emigration of people from neighbouring Macau. The Portuguese colony was in gradual decline, and many people who resided there sought better opportunities in the young and prospering colony of Hong Kong.|$|E

25|$|Whitley's {{first solo}} album, A Hard Act to Follow, was {{released}} in 1984, and featured a more mainstream country style.

25|$|With the cloning of a sheep {{known as}} Dolly in 1996 by somatic cell nuclear {{transfer}} (SCNT), {{the idea of}} human cloning became a hot debate topic. Many nations outlawed it, while a few scientists promised to make a clone <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>years.</b> The first hybrid human clone was created in November 1998, by Advanced Cell Technology. It was created using SCNT - a nucleus was taken from a man's leg cell and inserted into a cow's egg from which the nucleus had been removed, and the hybrid cell was cultured, and developed into an embryo. The embryo was destroyed after 12 days.|$|E

25|$|When it was {{acquired}} in 1923 by the perfumer François Coty from the politician and industrial Louis Loucheur, {{the house was}} found to be subject to a grave disorder because of the sinking slope on which it was built. François Coty called upon the architect Charles Mewès (1860–1914) to displace it several meters. This radical solution saved the building from erosion of the slope, which would have entirely destroyed it <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>years.</b> The move was accompanied by profound transformations: the mansard roof was converted into an attic sheltering five bedrooms, while vast dependences were created in the basement to arrange a perfume laboratory, an electric generator, kitchens and a swimming pool.|$|E

25|$|<b>Within</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>years,</b> King D. Afonso III {{donated the}} {{fortified}} settlement to the Order of Malta (1271), later awarded to his son, D. Afonso Sanches, along with landlords of the castles in Arronches, Vide and Portalegre. For this reason, {{at the beginning}} the reign of King D. Dinis (1279–1325), the village and its castle found themselves involved in the dispute between the sovereign and D. Afonso, and was conquered {{by the forces of}} the sovereign in 1299. At the end of these events, the fields of Marvão, Portalegre and Arronches were exchanged for those in Sintra and Ourém, becoming regal possessions/property by 1300. D. Dinis issued a new foral, and undertook the expansion and strengthening of defenses, resulting {{in the construction of the}} keep.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, many {{companies}} {{have moved to}} or expanded in the central business district and surrounding neighborhoods. Aetna announced mid-decade that by 2010 it would move nearly 3,500 employees from its Middletown, Connecticut offices to its corporate headquarters in the Asylum Hill section of the city. Travelers recently expanded its operations at several downtown locations. In 2008, Sovereign Bank consolidated two bank branches {{as well as its}} regional headquarters in a nineteenth-century palazzo on Asylum Street. In 2009, Northeast Utilities, a Fortune 500 company and New England's largest energy utility, announced it would establish its corporate headquarters downtown. Other recent entrants into the downtown market include GlobeOp Financial Services and specialty insurance broker S.H. Smith.

25|$|Tests of the Lense–Thirring precession, {{consisting}} of small secular precessions of {{the orbit of}} a test particle in motion around a central rotating mass, for example, a planet or a star, have been performed with the LAGEOS satellites, but many aspects of them remain controversial. The same effect may have been detected in the data of the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) spacecraft, a former probe in orbit around Mars; also such a test raised a debate. First attempts to detect the Sun's Lense–Thirring effect on the perihelia of the inner planets have been recently reported as well. Frame dragging would cause the orbital plane of stars orbiting near a supermassive black hole to precess about the black hole spin axis. This effect should be detectable <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> via astrometric monitoring of stars {{at the center of}} the Milky Way galaxy. By comparing the rate of orbital precession of two stars on different orbits, it is possible in principle to test the no-hair theorems of general relativity.|$|E
