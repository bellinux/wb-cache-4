But as important as my youth and upbringing was, there's something else that made me stick to Doo. He thought I was something special, more special {{than anyone else in the}} world, and never let me forget it. That belief would be hard to shove out the door. Doo was my security, my safety net. And just remember, I'm explainin', not excusin'. (Still Woman Enough xvii) ... Doo was a good man and a hard worker. But he was an alcoholic, and it affected our marriage all the way through. He was also a womanizer. Cheating husbands have been all over the news talk shows for a few years now. Lots of <b>women</b> <b>say</b> <b>they</b> don't understand why women stay with them dogs. My story is about one who did—me.(Still Woman Enough, p. xiii).|$|E

When a man says he is too busy to do this, that, or the other, you may always safely put it down that he doesn't want to do it. Of course, it is just the same thing with ourselves. You often hear <b>women</b> <b>say</b> <b>they</b> are too busy to attend to all sorts of things that they ought to attend to, but the same women can find plenty of time to go to every pleasure gathering that comes off. There is no doubt that Mr. Bathurst is really fond of work, and that he is an indefatigable civil servant of the Company, but that would not prevent him making an hour or two's time of an evening, occasionally, if he wanted to. However, he seems to have turned over a new leaf, and I hope it will last. In a small station like this, even one man is of importance, especially when he is as pleasant as Mr. Bathurst can be when he likes. He was in the army at one time, you know." ...|$|E

[...] "When you are as old as I am, it will not seem so simple a question--'Why did you do this?' People talk of their motives in a cut and dried way. Every woman {{is supposed to have}} the same set of motives, or else to be a monster. I am not a monster, but I have not felt exactly what other women feel--or say they feel, for fear of being thought unlike others. When you reproach me in your heart for sending you away from me, you mean that I ought to say I felt about you as other <b>women</b> <b>say</b> <b>they</b> feel about their children. I did not feel that. I was glad to be freed from you. But I did well for you, and I gave you your father's fortune. Do I seem now to be revoking everything?--Well, there are reasons. I feel many things that I cannot understand. A fatal illness has been growing in me for a year. I shall very likely not live another year. I will not deny anything I have done. I will not pretend to love where I have no love. But shadows are rising round me. Sickness makes them. If I have wronged the dead--I have but little time to do what I left undone." ...|$|E

60|$|Pictorial, {{rather than}} picturesque, {{might be the}} word for the present dress of Englishwomen. It forms in itself a lovely picture to the eye, and is not merely the {{material}} or the inspiration of a picture. It is therefore the more difficult of transference to {{the imagination of the}} reader who has not also been a spectator, and before such a scene as one may witness in a certain space of the Park on a fair Sunday after church in the morning, or before dinner in the early evening, the boldest kodak may well close its single eye in despair. As yet even the mental photograph cannot impart the tints of nature, and the reader who wishes to assist at this scene must do his best to fancy them for himself. At the right moment of the ripening London season the foliage of the trees is densely yet freshly green and flatteringly soft to the eye; the grass below has that closeness of texture which only English grass has the secret of. At fit distances the wide beds of rhododendrons and azaleas are glowing; the sky is tenderly blue, and the drifted clouds in it are washed clean of their London grime. If it is in the afternoon, these beautiful women begin to appear about the time when you may have bidden yourself abandon the hope of them for that day. Some drift from the carriages that draw up on the drive beside the sacred close where they are to sit on penny chairs, spreading far over the green; others glide on foot from elect neighborhoods, or from vehicles left afar, perhaps that they may give themselves the effect of coming informally. They arrive in twos and threes, young girls commonly with their mothers, but sometimes together, in varied raptures of millinery, and with the rainbow range in their delicately floating, delicately clinging draperies. But their hats, their gowns, always express sentiment, even when they cannot always express simplicity; and the just observer is obliged to own that their calm faces often express, if not simplicity, sentiment. Their beauty is very, very great, not a beauty of coloring alone, but a beauty of feature which is able to be patrician without being unkind; and if, as some American <b>women</b> <b>say,</b> <b>they</b> do not carry themselves well, it takes an American woman to see it. They move naturally and lightly--that is, the young girls do; mothers in England, as elsewhere, are apt to put on weight; but many of the mothers are as handsome in their well-wearing English way as their daughters.|$|E

40|$|There {{are many}} {{estimates}} of the number of children who are the victims of sexual abuse. • One U. S. governmental source counts 78, 188 child victims of sexual abuse in 2003. That’s a rate of 1. 2 per 1, 000 American children. • The 2001 National Crime Victimization Survey, which only covers youth 12 - 17, estimates that 1. 9 per 1, 000 children are raped or sexually assaulted. • National surveys of adults find that 9 - 28 % of <b>women</b> <b>say</b> <b>they</b> experienced some type of sexual abuse or assault in childhood. All these estimates and others that are available have limitations and should be used with care. Problems of Estimating the Victimization of Child Sexual Abuse There are three issues that make it challenging to estimate how many children are victims of sexual abuse. 1. One problem concerns how abuse is defined. Generally sexual abuse is thought to involve a young child who is victimized by an adult acquaintance or family member. However, there are many other forms of sexual abuse, such as a 12 year-old being sexually assaulted by a 15 year-old. Some estimates try to count all forms of abuse; others don’t...|$|E
30|$|In {{addition}} to communicating biological sex, {{another area of}} interest to researchers has been use of “sexy” dress 1 to communicate sexual desire or attract sexual attention from others. As the dress items that comprise “sexy” are subject to fashion and thus, change over time, researchers {{in their attempts to}} investigate inferences and behaviors linked to such dress have labeled and operationalized this variable differently. Regardless of how sexy dress was operationalized, some <b>women</b> <b>say</b> <b>they</b> use dress to communicate their sexual desire to men and attract sexual attention from men (Grammer et al. 2004; Montemurro and Gillen 2013; Smolak et al. 2014). For example, using reasoning based in evolutionary psychology, Grammer et al. found that women used alluring and bold clothes (.i.e., sheerness) to court a partner, meet new people, and flirt. Additionally, researchers have reported that people believe women use dress to indicate sexual interest or intent. For example, Koukounas and Letch (2001) reported both men and women thought that women used sexy dress to indicate sexual interest and that men perceived more sexual intent than women. Earlier, Haworth-Hoeppner (1998) reported that men more often than women indicated they believed women’s clothing choice was actually used to signal sexual intent.|$|E

40|$|Aim: To discuss {{theoretical}} conceptualisation and {{definition of}} values and values-based recruitment {{in the context of}} women’s views about what they would like from their midwife. Background: Values-based recruitment received headline status in the UK government’s response to pervasive deficiencies in compassionate care identified in the health service. Core values which aim to inform service user’s experience are defined in the National Health Service Constitution but clarity about whether these encompass all that women say is important to them is needed. Design: Discussion paper Data Sources: A literature search included published papers written in English relating to values, VBR and women’s views of a ‘good’ midwife with no date limiters. Discussion: Definitions {{of values and}} values-based recruitment are examined. Congruence is explored between what women say is important to them and key government and professional regulatory documentation. The importance of a ‘sustainable emotional’ dimension in the midwife-mother relationship is suggested. Conclusion: Inconsistencies are identified between women’s views, government, professional documentation and what <b>women</b> <b>say</b> <b>they</b> want. An omission of any reference to emotions or emotionality in values-based recruitment policy, professional recruitment and selection guidance documentation is identified. Implications: A review of key professional documentation, in relation to selection for ‘values’, is proposed. We argue for clarity and revision so that values embedded in values-based recruitment are consistent with health service users’ views. An enhancement of the ‘values’ in the values-based recruitment framework is recommended to include the emotionality that women state is a fundamental part of their relationship with their midwife...|$|E
40|$|Births in Australia {{are at an}} {{historical}} high - with around 285 000 babies born in 2007. This corresponds to an estimated total fertility rate of 1. 93 babies per woman, the highest since the early 1980 s. This is not a one-off event as fertility rates have been generally rising for the last 6 years. Overall, {{the evidence suggests that}} after its long downward trend after the Second World War, Australia's fertility rate may have stabilised at around 1. 75 to 1. 9 babies per woman. Much of the recent increase in the fertility rate is likely to reflect the fact that over the last few decades, younger women postponed childbearing and many are now having these postponed babies (so-called 'recuperation'). This has shown up as higher fertility rates for older women. However, some of the increase is also likely to be due to a 'quantum' effect - {{an increase in the number}} of babies women will ultimately have over their lifetimes. For example, today's young <b>women</b> <b>say</b> <b>they</b> are expecting to have more babies over their lifetime than those five years ago. Overall, Australia appears to be in a 'safe zone' of fertility, despite fertility levels being below replacement levels. There is no fertility crisis. Australia's population should continue to grow at one of the highest rates in the developed world because of migrant inflows. Feasibly attainable increases in fertility would not significantly allay ageing of the population, nor address its fiscal and labour market challenges.

40|$|Graduation date: 2001 This {{qualitative}} study explores {{the experiences of}} women who are welfare recipients attending a community college under the auspices of a new program, Washington State's WorkFirst/Work Study program. The study, conducted over two academic quarters, includes in-depth interviews with WorkFirst/Work Study students, observations in a weekly seminar, and interviews with community college staff who work in the program. The overarching research question is: "What are the challenges and the transition issues confronted by women who are living in poverty and participating in a community college program?" The research elicits responses about the women's expectations and fears about education, their aspirations for themselves and their children, what they hope to gain from the college experience and what barriers may interfere. The study identifies five contextual issues in the women's lives: family background and history, relationships, physical and psychological health, housing, and finances. And the study explores the participants' experience with and attitudes toward four thematic areas: parenting, welfare, work and school. A major goal was to give voice to these women. Underlying assumptions are that community college administrators and faculty want to improve access, success and satisfaction with the college for poor women; that learning about how poor women experience the community college gives college personnel valuable information; that Washington community colleges have an interest in working with WorkFirst; and that better understanding of WorkFirst/Work Study participants' experiences is valuable to the colleges and benefits low-income students. The women interviewed are highly motivated and believe that an education is key to a better life for them and their children. Some of the barriers they face are embedded in the restrictions and requirements of the WorkFirst program. Nevertheless, these <b>women</b> <b>say</b> <b>they</b> are better off on welfare, working and going to school than they were when they were among the working poor.
