The algorithm concerns the recursive implementations {{of the method}} of LS which usually have a <b>weighting</b> <b>factor</b> in the cost function. This <b>weighting</b> <b>factor</b> enables nonstationary signal models to be tracked. In particular, {{the behavior of the}} <b>weighting</b> <b>factor</b> is known to influence the performance of the LS estimation. However, there are certain constraints on the <b>weighting</b> <b>factor.</b> In this paper, we have refor-mulated the LS estimation with the commonly used exponential <b>weighting</b> <b>factor</b> as a constrained optimization problem. Specif-ically, we have addressed this constrained optimization using the Lagrange programming neural networks (LPNN’s) thereby enabling the <b>weighting</b> <b>factor</b> to be adapted. The utility of our adaptive weighted least squares (AWLS) algorithm is demon-strated in the context of Volterra signal modeling in stationary and nonstationary environments. By using the Kuhn–Tucker conditions, all the LS estimated parameters may be shown to be optimal. Index Terms—Least square estimation, neural networks, non-linear signal modeling, Volterra system.
