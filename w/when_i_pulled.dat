25|$|I saw Owen and {{the other}} two players put their head in their hands and fired {{thinking}} it would perhaps do as a dejection pic. To be honest, had it happened earlier in the game when I had more time and things were less frantic, I probably would have deleted it as you couldn't make out the faces on the crowd {{on the back of the}} camera, and it was only <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> it up on the laptop later that I realised what I had.|$|E
500|$|Filming {{involving}} the reptiles frequently {{proved to be}} hazardous. During a promotional shoot with Supermarionation puppets, one of the crocodiles suddenly grabbed the Lady Penelope marionette (which {{does not appear in}} the episode) and, to the upset of Glanville, ripped apart one the legs. During the filming of a scene in which an alligator swims after a boat, Meddings was using a rope to guide the crocodile forwards when it was discovered that the animal had slipped out of its harness; in his book, 21st–Century Visions, Meddings wrote of the incident: [...] "My crew never saw me move as fast as I did {{to get out of the}} tank <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> the rope and realised the creature was free." [...] Of the largest crocodile, which was wetted with damp strips at the back of the stage while un-used, Wingrove recalls: [...] "You would forget that it was there, then one day someone shouted 'Look out!' and we turned round to see this big crocodile walking across the stage – which cleared of people very quickly!" ...|$|E
2500|$|While {{performing}} {{her song}} [...] "Human Nature" [...] in her concert in Istanbul on June 7, 2012, Madonna briefly exposed her right breast to the audience, before covering it up again. The Sun notes, [...] "Her actions {{may have been}} offensive to some members of her audience, as Turkey is a traditionally Islamic country, with a largely Muslim population" [...] before noting that [...] "Perhaps fans shouldn't have been surprised - as she did warn them, writing No Fear on her back. [...] Amy Odell from BuzzFeed said that criticizing the gesture based on her age sends [...] "a very archaic message", adding that [...] "Women who are 53 still have breasts and... sex drives!". Three days later, The Sun published an article entitled, [...] "Madonna was right to bare her boob at 53." [...] Three readers of the publication recreated the pose, photographed it, and sent it in to the publication to show their support for Madonna [...] "as a positive role model for older women." [...] While some initially claimed Madonna as [...] "clingy" [...] and [...] "desperate", Sarah Angotti, also 53, counters, [...] "I felt nervous <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> my bra down but that’s only natural— Madonna probably did too. But then I felt empowered, {{it was an incredible}} feeling." [...] She goes on to say about Madonna, [...] "She looks incredible now— better than a woman half her age and better than many of the young girls in the charts now" [...] before commenting on the criticism of Madonna exposing her breast as a parent, [...] "If she is a good mother that’s all that matters." [...] Tina Shaw, also 53, argues Madonna [...] "will not change" [...] despite a double-standard between men and women, opining, [...] "Women always seem to get the most flack when it comes to controversial situations. If it was a 53-year-old famous guy flashing his six-pack on stage, everyone would say, 'Wow, what a lad' but because it’s a woman everyone is saying, 'What an old bag'". Lastly, Sue Scadding, 53 as well, negates the controversy, pointing out that [...] "there are topless women out on the beach every day and nobody bats an eyelid...I mean, it’s only a nipple for goodness sake".|$|E

6000|$|... "Those {{will be my}} reins," [...] said Claus, [...] "and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>pull</b> them to {{the right}} or to the left you must go in that direction. If <b>I</b> do not <b>pull</b> the reins at all you may go {{straight}} ahead." ...|$|R

"Mattie, {{sometimes}} <b>when</b> I'm asleep <b>I</b> think I am {{back there}} ag'in--and you girls are there--an' we're pullin' off {{the leaves of}} the wild sunflower--'rich man, poor man, beggar man'--and I hear you all laugh <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>pull</b> off the last leaf; an' <b>when</b> <b>I</b> come to myself--and I'm an old, dried-up woman, dyin' unsatisfied!" ...|$|R
2500|$|Jones' binge {{drinking}} {{and use of}} amphetamines on the road caught up to him in 1967 {{and he had to}} be admitted into a neurological hospital to seek treatment for his drinking. [...] Jones would go to extreme lengths for a drink if the thirst was on him. [...] Perhaps the most famous drinking story concerning Jones occurred while he was married to his second wife Shirley Corley. [...] Jones recalled Shirley making it physically impossible for him to travel to Beaumont, located 8 miles away, to buy liquor. Because Jones would not walk that far, she would hide the keys to each of their cars they owned before leaving. She did not, however, hide the keys to the lawn mower. [...] Upset, Jones walked to the window and looked out over his property. [...] He later described his thoughts in his memoir: [...] "There, gleaming in the glow, was that ten-horsepower rotary engine under a seat. A key glistening in the ignition. I imagine the top speed for that old mower was five miles per hour. It might have taken {{an hour and a half}} or more for me to get to the liquor store, but get there I did." [...] Years later Jones comically mocked the incident by making a cameo in the video for [...] "All My Rowdy Friends Are Coming Over Tonight" [...] by Hank Williams Jr.. He also parodied the episode in the 1993 video for [...] "One More Last Chance" [...] by Vince Gill and in his own music video for the single [...] "Honky Tonk Song" [...] in 1996. Curiously, in her 1979 autobiography Stand By Your Man, Tammy Wynette claims the incident occurred while she was married to Jones, maintaining that she woke up at one o'clock in the morning to find her husband gone: [...] "I got into the car and drove to the nearest bar 10 miles away. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> into the parking lot there sat our rider-mower right by the entrance. He'd driven that mower right down a main highway. [...] He looked up and saw me and said, ‘Well, fellas, here she is now. My little wife, I told you she'd come after me.’" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Of Fort Fiddlededee in {{the year}} 1778, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> off Mr. Washington's epaulet, gouged General Gates's eye, cut off Charles Lee's head, and pasted it on again!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “It’s {{likely you}} know {{the laws of the}} woods better than I do, Billy Kirby,” {{returned}} Natty. “You come in with the settlers, with an ox- goad in your hand, and I come in with moccasins on my feet, and with a good rifle on my shoulders, so long back as afore the old war. Which is likely to know the best? I say no man need tell me that snapping is as good as firing <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>pull</b> the trigger.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then," [...] {{answered}} the Abbot, dropping his fist upon the table, [...] "then death {{for both of}} you--the witch's death, for I dare not let you go to work my ruin. Remember, I am master here, you are my prisoners. Few know that you live in this place, except a handful of weak-brained women who will fear to speak--puppets that must dance <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>pull</b> the string--and I'll see that no soul shall come near these walls. Choose, then, between death and all its terrors or life and all its hopes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Rest awhile, Baas," [...] {{said the}} dwarf, whose breath {{was coming in}} great sobs, [...] "then make a little nick in the ice with the blade of the spear, and <b>when</b> next <b>I</b> <b>pull,</b> try to set some of your weight upon it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He agreed; {{but on the}} {{sidewalk}} he fell to cursing again in the dull monotonous way {{that he had done}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> him out of the coal cellar.|$|E
6000|$|... "I shot twice," [...] said Jimmy, {{in a quiet}} voice. [...] "I don't think Bob used a gun. All the same, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> {{the trigger}} I {{imagined}} I heard another report; but perhaps it was my rifle. I really don't know." ...|$|E
60|$|I said no more, {{consuming}} my rasher {{of bacon}} and pint of sickly tea in silence. Nor did she take further {{interest in me}} till I came to pay my reckoning (fourpence), <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> all of ten shillings out of my pocket. The expected result was produced.|$|E
5000|$|During his {{professional}} career, Vann {{is perhaps most}} notable for his energetic appearance in the LA Rams promotional video [...] "Ram It" [...] by [...] "The Rammers", {{in which he is}} one of the first five featured soloists, along with Jackie Slater, Nolan Cromwell, Gary Jeter, and Dennis Harrah. Following Jeter's segment, Vann's verse went: [...] "This is limousine Woody, my moves are like dreams, they call me the demon on the special teams. I know how to rock from the toes to the head, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>pull</b> the trigger, I'll knock you dead", leading into Dennis Harrah's [...] "Mountain Man"-themed verse.|$|R
5000|$|Mack {{addressed}} his {{withdrawal from}} the rock spotlight in a 1977 interview: [...] Seems like every time I get close to really making it, to climbing {{to the top of}} the mountain, that's <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>pull</b> out. <b>I</b> just <b>pull</b> up and run. Lonnie Mack, 1977 [...] The lyrics of his songs provided further insight. In one song, he equated the pursuit of [...] "fortune and fame" [...] with selling one's soul to Satan, allowing the [...] "body to live while your soul is left to rot". In other songs, he expressed love for country living and distaste for city living. Mack also felt out-of-phase with LA's psychedelic music scene. Interviewed in 1998, Mack said: [...] "They was mostly into just really out-there kinda music, ripped-out-of-their-tree music".|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{are great}} useless creatures,' said he, 'who couldn't even outwit that little dwarf. When we have {{finished}} supper I {{will show you}} what I have done with him!' But {{when they reached the}} place where Paul had left the dwarf, neither he nor the tree was to be seen, for the little fellow had pulled it up by the roots and run away, dragging it after him. The four friends followed the track of the tree and found that it ended in a deep hole. 'He must have gone down here,' said Paul, 'and I will go after him. See! there is a basket that will do for me to sit in, and a cord to lower me with. But <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>pull</b> the cord again, lose no time in drawing the basket up.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I was here," [...] Payne explained. [...] "Heard {{something}} move once or twice, and at {{last the}} fellow showed {{between me and the}} light. When I saw he was making for the veranda I put up my gun. Knew I had the bead on him <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> her off." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's a sure thing," [...] Walthew agreed. [...] "However, I guess I {{know what}} you mean. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> up I fancied your friends were {{watching}} for me, and I'd have found the road blocked if I'd gone on. Don't you think you had better tell me what it's all about?" ...|$|E
60|$|Presently I {{recalled}} the cord {{that had been}} attached to the parcel when it fell at my side, and after a little groping my hand {{came in contact with}} it again. It depended from above, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> upon it I discovered that it was rigidly fastened, possibly at the pit's mouth.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, no," [...] said he. [...] "I'll {{find me a}} lodging somewhere at hand, {{since my}} fond sire is {{determined}} I shall pollute no longer the sacrosanctity of his dwelling. Perhaps <b>when</b> <b>I</b> have <b>pulled</b> him out of this quicksand, he will deign to mitigate the bitterness of his feelings for me. Though, faith, I find life endurable without the affection he should have consecrated to me." ...|$|R
60|$|When he had spoken, Mina's long {{spell of}} silence {{made me look}} at her. She had fallen back on her pillow asleep. She did not even wake <b>when</b> <b>I</b> had <b>pulled</b> up the blind and let in the {{sunlight}} which flooded the room. Van Helsing motioned to me to come with him quietly. We went to his room, and within a minute Lord Godalming, Dr. Seward, and Mr. Morris were with us also.|$|R
6000|$|Her tresses, {{released}} from whatever bound them, streamed {{in the wind}} about her, {{and she seemed to}} shrink a little from me as she struggled with them. [...] "It is not Caryl's fault. I clumsily let the rope go <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was <b>pulling</b> the boat in, and as it is some little time since I was a child, I do not care to be treated as one. Have I not done my best?" [...] she asked.|$|R
6000|$|... "By no means," [...] {{returned}} Charlie, {{with that}} benignant smile that always accompanied his opposition in argument. [...] "I do not admit that, because, if I {{had not done}} it, assuredly some one else would. In fact {{a friend of mine}} was on the point of making the attempt <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> him back and prevented him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I thought I did, father. I {{may have}} been mistaken, but I {{certainly}} thought I heard a noise, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> the curtains aside the window was not shut by three or four inches. I will have a look through the shrubbery. That fellow may have come back again. Pull the curtains to after me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I had brain fever or {{something}} {{after we got}} clear of the land. Anyway, the DUCHESS lay hove to for three weeks, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> myself together and we jogged on with her to Sydney. Anyway those niggers of Malu learned the everlasting lesson {{that it is not}} good to monkey with a white man. In their case, Saxtorph was certainly inevitable." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Old age, dear. This {{it is to}} get fat {{and sleek}} in town. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> wished to <b>pull</b> you hair you {{generally}} ran for three miles, shrieking {{at the top of your}} voice. I ought to know, because those shrieks of yours were meant to call up Mrs. Jennett with a cane and----' ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{typically}} self-deprecating Gremillion {{later told}} him, [...] "Dodd, I appreciate your bragging on my war record, but don't tell the crowds that I will show them where I got shot. Several of those darn rednecks {{wanted me to}} show them my scars and got mad <b>when</b> <b>I</b> refused to <b>pull</b> down my pants." ...|$|R
5000|$|Moores {{said that}} Walt Wallet was his alter ego. [...] "I use Walt to create homey {{situations}} and for anybody who's feeling his age to identify with," [...] Moores said {{two months before}} his death. [...] "He's the father figure. He's what keeps them together. He's the one <b>I</b> go to <b>when</b> <b>I</b> want to <b>pull</b> the strip together." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Shook 'em up beautiful," [...] Shorty proclaimed breathlessly, an hour afterward, when {{he arrived}} at the cabin on Tra-Lee. He gripped Smoke's hand. [...] "You should a-saw 'em. Ever kick over a ant-hole? Dawson's just like that. Main Street was crawlin' an' hummin' <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> my freight. You won't see Tra-Lee to-morrow for folks. An' if they ain't some a-sneakin' acrost right now I don't know minin' nature, that's all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I see," [...] said he. [...] "That trap-door {{was made}} to fall down, and not to lift up, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> the bolt, down it went, and the ladder, being on top of it, slipped into that hole. Heavens!" [...] he said, as a cold sweat burst out over him at the thought, [...] "suppose I had {{made up my mind}} to cut that bolt! Where would I have gone to?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I used {{to think}} of you, Grant, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> out Monday morning in my best suit-cost fifteen dollars in those days." [...] He smiled a little at the recollection. [...] "While you in {{overalls}} and an old 'wammus' was going out into the field to plow, or husk corn in the mud. It made me feel uneasy, but, as I said, I kept saying to myself, 'His turn'll come {{in a year or}} two.' But it didn't." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{went into}} her room, {{and closed the door}} on us. I could bear it no longer. I got up, with the firm {{resolution}} in me to follow her, and say the words which he had failed to say for himself. My hand was on the door, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was suddenly <b>pulled</b> back from it by Oscar. I turned, and faced him in silence.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{must say}} it jarred me <b>when</b> <b>I</b> heard you <b>pulling</b> that stuff,' {{continued}} White. 'I haven't {{what you might}} call a childlike faith in my fellow-man as a rule, but {{it had never occurred to}} me for a moment that you could be playing that game. It only shows,' he added philosophically, 'that you've got to suspect everybody when it comes to a gilt-edged proposition like the Little Nugget.' ...|$|R
60|$|But I {{had almost}} {{forgotten}} my shooting-jacket, {{which was made}} of moleskin. Every day, it grew smaller and smaller, particularly after a rain, until at last I thought it would completely exhale, and leave nothing but the bare seams, {{by way of a}} skeleton, on my back. It became unspeakably unpleasant, when we got into rather cold weather, crossing the Banks of Newfoundland, when the only way I had to keep warm during the night, was to pull on my waistcoat and my roundabout, and then clap the shooting-jacket over all. This made it pinch me under the arms, and it vexed, irritated, and tormented me every way; and used to incommode my arms seriously <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was <b>pulling</b> the ropes; so much so, that the mate asked me once if I had the cramp.|$|R
