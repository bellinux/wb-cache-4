5|$|Early in December 1900, <b>we</b> <b>received</b> from Lowell Observatory in Arizona a {{telegram}} that {{a shaft of}} light had been seen to project from Mars (the Lowell observatory makes a specialty of Mars) lasting seventy minutes. I wired these facts to Europe and sent out neostyle copies through this country. The observer there is a careful, reliable man {{and there is no}} reason to doubt that the light existed. It was given as from a well-known geographical point on Mars. That was all. Now the story has gone the world over. In Europe it is stated that I have been in communication with Mars, and all sorts of exaggerations have spring up. Whatever the light was, we have no means of knowing. Whether it had intelligence or not, no one can say. It is absolutely inexplicable.|$|E

Other writers believe that the tricolor was not an imitation of the French flag, instead embodying an old Romanian tradition. This theory is supported by a note from the revolutionary foreign minister to Emin Pasha: “the colors of the band that we the leaders wear, as well as all our followers, are not of modern origin. We have had our flags since an earlier time. When <b>we</b> <b>received</b> the tricolor insignia and bands we did not follow the spirit of imitation or fashion”.|$|E

5|$|November 27, 1888: Petition {{from the}} King of Rurutu and the Queen of Rimatara and their nobles to Her Most Gracious Majesty Queen Victoria, {{and to the}} Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. May you have good health. We, Teuruarii, King of Rurutu and Te Maere, Queen of Rimatara and our nobles, ask for the Prime Minister to place our islands and our ships under the {{protection}} of the British flag. These are the islands, namely, Rurutu, Rimatara, and Marià, and there are the names of the ships: Faaito and Ronui, and the masters of the same are natives. This is our word to you: Do not forsake us; we are your children; you taught us the word of God, and that has led us in the path of civilisation; therefore we know that you are a good parent to us. The thoughts of the children cling fondly to their good parent; they do not wish to be separated from their good parent. If the parent forsake the children, the children will seek the parent; so do we; we are like those children, and we ask that you will give us your flag to protect us. We have heard that you have taken Rarotonga and the neighbouring islands under your protection, but we remain without anyone to protect us. When <b>we</b> <b>received</b> the news that Rarotonga and the neighbouring islands were placed under your protection, we wept aloud because we were forsaken by you; we were afraid lest we should be adopted by another parent. The strange parent we mean is the French. They did not feed us with the milk of the gospel, but you did. O Great Britain; you fed us with that milk which has given life to us. This is our last word to you; we do not wish for French annexation or protection, not at all, but we wish you to be our parent, O Great Britain. We pray you now to accede to this our request. This letter was written in the house of Queen Pa. -TEURUARII, TE MAERE ARII.|$|E

On 22 July 1898, approximately 1500 rebels entered Guatemala from Mexico equipped with Mauser rifles to end Estrada Cabrera regime, but their adventure was swiftly neutralized, as Estrada Cabrera sent twelve thousand troops to stop them, declared Martial Law and secured the help of a British navy ship to attack the Port of Ocós if needed. The {{commander in chief of the}} Guatemalan Army was former president Manuel Lisandro Barillas Bercián, who defeated the rebels in Vado Ancho on 5 August of that year.

"Three Little Birds" [...] {{taken from}} Over the Rainbow, was {{released}} as Talbot's first single on 10 June 2008 in the UK, {{and was released}} alongside the album in the US on 14 October.

Talbot received attention from the British press because of the single's success, with the Daily Mail and Daily Telegraph attributing her success in America to her appeal to the Christian market, and {{to the success of}} her videos on YouTube.

[...] Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger enjoyed the triple-length [...] "There's No Place Like Home", but ranked {{it in the middle of}} his list of the season's episodes from best to worst and decided that [...] "'There's No Place Like Home" [...] (both parts) played fair with the audience 100 percent, answered [...] questions … and yet … I feel ever so slightly disappointed by all of this."
