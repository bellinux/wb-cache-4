5|$|Imaginative spectators <b>would</b> <b>climb</b> {{the church}} and watch a {{football}} game from the rooftop however they have now been deterred from doing so with the installation of security measures such as barbed wire and anti-climb paint. In addition, {{the introduction of the}} 'all-seater' ruling following the Taylor Report has meant that spectators no longer resort to climbing nearby buildings for a glimpse of the event as a seat is guaranteed with a purchased ticket.|$|E
5|$|His {{introduction}} to films was unusual. When visiting an aunt {{who lived in}} Brooklyn opposite Vitagraph Studios, Cagney <b>would</b> <b>climb</b> over the fence to watch the filming of John Bunny movies. He became involved in amateur dramatics, starting as a scenery boy for a Chinese pantomime at Lenox Hill Neighborhood House, {{one of the first}} settlement houses in the nation, where his brother Harry performed and his soon-to-be friend, Florence James, directed. He was initially content working behind the scenes and had no interest in performing. One night, however, Harry became ill, and although Cagney was not an understudy, his photographic memory of rehearsals enabled him to stand in for his brother without making a single mistake. Therefore, Florence James has the unique distinction of being the first director to put him on a stage. Afterward, he joined a number of companies as a performer in a variety of roles.|$|E
5|$|Music is {{important}} to the locals of Cortina, with a guitar found in most houses, and young musicians are often found walking the streets. Every year, from the end of July to early August, Cortina hosts the Dino Ciani Festival and Academy. It is held in honour of the celebrated Italian pianist Dino Ciani (1941–1974) who died when he was only 32. The festival attracts young pianists from around the world who are able to benefit from classes with some of the world's leading performers. The Festival of the Bands is another annual musical event featuring brass bands from Italy and beyond during the last week of August. Cortina's own band, parading in traditional costumes, is a central attraction dating back to 1861. Cortina d'Ampezzo hosted the 1953 Miss Italia contest, won by Marcella Mariani. Traditionally, on the eves of the festivals of Ascension, Pentecost, Trinity and St Philip and St James, the youth of the town <b>would</b> <b>climb</b> the hills at sunset and light fires.|$|E

5|$|Thomas Hale Streets {{discussed}} the behaviour in 1877, doubting {{that the animal}} <b>would</b> <b>climb</b> trees {{to get at the}} coconuts. In the 1980s, Holger Rumpf was able to confirm Streets' report, observing and studying how they open coconuts in the wild. The animal has developed a special technique to do so: if the coconut is still covered with husk, it will use its claws to rip off strips, always starting from the side with the three germination pores, the group of three small circles found {{on the outside of the}} coconut. Once the pores are visible, the coconut crab will bang its pincers on one of them until they break. Afterwards, it will turn around and use the smaller pincers on its other legs to pull out the white flesh of the coconut. Using their strong claws, larger individuals can even break the hard coconut into smaller pieces for easier consumption.|$|E
5|$|McCudden joined No. 20 Squadron on 8 July 1916. The {{unit was}} {{equipped}} with Royal Aircraft Factory F.E.2 and flew from Clairmarais, near Saint-Omer. He flew his first operational sortie two days later and continued as the Battle of the Somme raged. The Squadron was ordered to intercept and shoot down German reconnaissance aircraft. He patrolled the Ypres and Roulers region. He did not spot any enemy reconnaissance machines but did {{come into contact with}} a single Fokker near Lille. Flying in formation, the British were well placed to deal with lone German fighters since they could use their gunners to form a formidable defence screen. This particular German <b>would</b> <b>climb</b> above the British, make a diving attack at the rear-most aircraft and dive away if he did not score a decisive hit. Two days later McCudden ran out of fuel in the Lille district. Disorientated because of heavy mist, he force-landed in Allied territory, crashing and coming to halt in the garden of a French farmhouse. Little damage was done to the machine. On 2 August he took part in an operation to bomb the Zeppelin sheds at Brussels. The flight was unmolested, though the familiar lone Fokker made an appearance and then withdrew without attacking.|$|E
25|$|Along the peninsula, the {{civilian}} population was scarce and consisted of some small family farms. The region was surrounded by pine woods. Typically, Confederate pilots <b>would</b> <b>climb</b> the tall pine trees with large ladders, spot the nearest blockade runner and then depart, meeting the incoming ship to guide it past the several passive defenses to Wilmington.|$|E

25|$|The {{regular season}} finale {{would take place}} at Richmond for the 26th race. Earnhardt would qualify 29th and was puzzled in his {{interview}} afterwards. During the race, Earnhardt made steady climbs and by halfway had cracked the top ten. Earnhardt <b>would</b> <b>climb</b> as high as 4th and end up finishing 5th. He made the chase for the 8th {{time in his career}} and was seeded 6th for the first Chase race.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} days of the Roman Republic, public taxes {{consisted}} of modest assessments on owned wealth and property. The tax rate under normal circumstances was 1% and sometimes <b>would</b> <b>climb</b> as high as 3% in situations such as war. These modest taxes were levied against land, homes and other real estate, slaves, animals, personal items and monetary wealth. The more a person had in property, the more tax they paid. Taxes were collected from individuals.|$|E
25|$|The {{council members}} {{examined}} and studied legal projects, supervised the magistrates {{and saw that}} daily administrative details were on the right path. They oversaw the city state's external affairs. They also met at Pnyx hill, in a place expressly prepared for the event. The fifty prytaneis in power were located on grandstands carved into the rock. They had stone platforms which they reached {{by means of a}} small staircase of three steps. On the first platform were the secretaries and scribes; the orator <b>would</b> <b>climb</b> up to the second.|$|E
50|$|All of {{the landscapes}} and {{features}} {{were incorporated into}} the Indigenous culture long before the Europeans came to Australia. There was {{little doubt that the}} Aboriginal people <b>would</b> have <b>climbed</b> all if not some of the mountains and landscapes.|$|R

25|$|In August 1882, Jacob Philippi (c. 1835–1892) {{purchased}} a {{tract of land}} on Fort Moore Hill and built a beer garden. He had started the New York Brewery, the first brewery in Los Angeles, and had owned a saloon in the Temple Block {{in the center of}} town. On the summit of the hill he had a rambling structure erected, covering much of the ground with wide galleries, and for many years following, as the story went, local inhabitants of Los Angeles <b>would</b> <b>climb</b> the hill sober and roll down drunk.|$|E
25|$|At times, C-123 {{crews were}} {{uncomfortable with the}} assault role. South Vietnamese Special Forces were {{sometimes}} capricious about when and where they would fight. Straight cargo operations were hazardous enough, especially during the monsoon season when South Vietnamese troops were socked in within the mountainous valleys. To execute the mission, the C-123s would line up in a proper direction, let down in the undercast, {{and if they did}} not break out by a given altitude, <b>would</b> <b>climb</b> back up. There were usually 800-foot ceilings in the valleys, {{and most of the time}} they broke out.|$|E
25|$|The B-58 {{crews were}} chosen from other {{strategic}} bomber squadrons. Due to some characteristics of delta-winged aircraft, new pilots used the Convair F-102 Delta Dagger as a conversion trainer, {{before moving to}} the TB-58A trainer. The B-58 was difficult to fly and its three-man crews were constantly busy, but its performance was exceptional. A lightly loaded Hustler <b>would</b> <b>climb</b> at nearly 46,000ft/min (235m/s). In addition to its much smaller weapons load and more limited range than the Boeing B-52 Stratofortress, the B-58 had also been extremely expensive to acquire.|$|E
50|$|Simpson {{underwent}} six {{surgical operations}} {{as a result}} of the leg injuries sustained on Siula Grande. The doctors told him he <b>would</b> never <b>climb</b> again and that he would have trouble walking for the rest of his life. After two years of rehabilitation, however, he returned to mountain climbing.|$|R
50|$|By {{the age of}} fifteen, he {{had become}} an adept climber. He <b>would</b> {{sometimes}} <b>climb</b> to a window of the Teatro Malibran, let himself into the theatre, {{and set up a}} makeshift ticket booth at the theatre's back door, selling tickets cheaply to children who couldn't afford the theatre's prices.|$|R

25|$|Simeon {{wanted to}} run away from society, so he acted. In order {{to get away from the}} {{ever-increasing}} number of people who came to him for prayers and advice, leaving him little if any time for his private austerities, Simeon discovered a pillar which had survived among ruins in Telanissa (modern-day Taladah in Syria), and formed a small platform at the top. He determined to live out his life on this platform. For sustenance small boys from the nearby village <b>would</b> <b>climb</b> up the pillar and pass him parcels of flat bread and goats' milk. He may also have pulled up food in buckets via a pulley.|$|E
25|$|Hoping to {{accomplish}} this, Martin Schenck devised a scheme {{through which he}} would take Nijmegen and enhance his own treasury. On the evening of 10nbsp&August 1589, Schenck and 20nbsp&barges of men—approximately 200nbsp&soldiers—made {{their way down the}} Waal to Nijmegen. Schenck's plan was simple: they would find a house with open windows. Using scaling hooks and ropes, they <b>would</b> <b>climb</b> into the house and overpower the inhabitants, who should be sleeping at that hour. Once the house was secured, they would quietly find the city gate, and open it {{to the rest of the}} force, which would be waiting on the river landing. They could then overpower the small local garrison and any citizens who felt resistance was necessary. Not only would they reinforce the city, but there would be opportunity for plunder as well.|$|E
25|$|A typical annual {{training}} programme for 12 Squadron consisted of individual {{training in the}} autumn, working up to Squadron training in the summer consisting of bombing, formation flying, navigation exercises and gunnery. Experimental trials carried out included some limited night flying and the introduction into service and testing of parachutes for aircrew. This involved a number of practice jumps being performed by observers, who <b>would</b> <b>climb</b> out of the aircraft onto a small ladder and await a signal from the pilot as the aircraft flew over the airfield at 2000ft. The observers carried no reserve parachutes, and the silk material from which the parachutes were constructed {{had a tendency to}} build up a static charge whilst in storage, such that when the ripcord was pulled, the silk stuck together. 12 Squadron was also tasked with further trials work, experimenting with oxygen systems, high altitude photography, and low temperature trials work, particularly in respect to lubricants. In addition, cloud flying in formation and pattern bombing techniques were tested.|$|E
25|$|Menzies {{remained}} a staunch supporter of {{links to the}} monarchy and Commonwealth of Nations and formalised an alliance with the United States, but also launched post-war trade with Japan, beginning a growth of Australian exports of coal, iron ore and mineral resources that <b>would</b> steadily <b>climb</b> until Japan became Australia's largest trading partner.|$|R
50|$|In 1950 it {{claimed to}} have 243,000 full and {{associate}} members with 1800 institutional members. It <b>would</b> eventually <b>climb,</b> by 1972, to have 2,470,000 members, including 1700 members of the Union and Republican Academics of Sciences and 107,000 professors and doctors of sciences; it would run 'Houses of Scientific Atheism' in Soviet cities.|$|R
5|$|This was Bowie's {{first tour}} where {{wireless}} microphone technology was available, allowing Bowie considerable freedom {{to move around}} the stage during a concert. This allowed him {{to interact with the}} dancers and musicians much more freely, and as such the set included 3-story high mobile scaffolding, onto which Bowie and his dancers <b>would</b> occasionally <b>climb</b> during the show.|$|R
25|$|James Cook {{was born}} on 7 November 1728 (N.S.) {{in the village of}} Marton in Yorkshire and baptised on 14 November (N.S.) in the parish church of St Cuthbert, where his name {{can be seen in the}} church register. He was the second of eight {{children}} of James Cook, a Scottish farm labourer from Ednam in Roxburghshire, and his locally born wife, Grace Pace, from Thornaby-on-Tees. In 1736, his family moved to Airey Holme farm at Great Ayton, where his father's employer, Thomas Skottowe, paid for him to attend the local school. In 1741, after five years' schooling, he began work for his father, who had been promoted to farm manager. For leisure, he <b>would</b> <b>climb</b> a nearby hill, Roseberry Topping, enjoying the opportunity for solitude. Cooks' Cottage, his parents' last home, which he is likely to have visited, is now in Melbourne, Australia, having been moved from England and reassembled, brick by brick, in 1934.|$|E
25|$|An {{interesting}} park-like popular {{location is}} Eynali, a mountain at the north-east extremity of the city. Eynali was a barren mountain {{on top of}} which {{there was a huge}} white rectangular antenna facing Tabriz city. The old building was claimed to be a shrine that housed the burial site of an Imamzadeh (a descendant of the profit of Islam). In recent years trees have been planted on mountain slopes and the place has the appearance of a vast park. Every Friday morning many walk the site to enjoy the relatively cleaner breezes and watch the ever-growing jungle of high-rise buildings on the flat, arid plateau. Generally, the brief picnic ends with drinking a few cups of tea that has been brewed on a smoking fire. Making fire is a challenge as the scanty vegetation consists of trees that have been planted in recent years and are jealously guarded behind barbed wires. However, the crowds enjoy the challenge as a pleasant part of the weekly ritual. In older times, only groups of young men <b>would</b> <b>climb</b> near the shrine. In more recent years the presence of women is noticeable.|$|E
500|$|Pimples, {{popularly known}} as Dragon's teeth, were pyramid-shaped {{concrete}} blocks designed specifically to counter tanks which, attempting to pass them, <b>would</b> <b>climb</b> up exposing vulnerable parts of the vehicle and possibly slip down with the tracks between the points. They ranged in size somewhat, but were typically [...] high and about [...] square at the base. There was also a conical form.|$|E
5000|$|San Jacinto Peak {{is one of}} {{the most}} topographically {{prominent}} peaks in the United States. It is ranked sixth among peaks in the 48 contiguous states. According to John W.
