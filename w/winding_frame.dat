The heading angle σ is the angle between north and the horizontal component of the velocity vector, which describes which direction the aircraft is moving relative to cardinal directions. The flight path angle γ is the angle between horizontal and the velocity vector, which describes whether the aircraft is climbing or descending. The bank angle μ represents a rotation of the lift force around the velocity vector, which may indicate whether the airplane is turning.|$|R

The sideslip angle β is the angle between the velocity vector and the projection of the aircraft longitudinal axis onto the xw,yw-plane, which describes {{whether there is a}} lateral component to the aircraft velocity, also known as sideslip. The angle of attack α is the angle between the xw,yw-plane and the aircraft longitudinal axis and, among other things, is an important variable in determining the magnitude of the force of lift.|$|R

We consider nine possibilities for this wave that include various combinations of its propagation direction, polarization in the solar <b>wind</b> <b>frame,</b> and ion source responsible for its generation. Using the observed wave parameters and the measured plasma parameters as constraints, we uniquely identify the wave by systematically discarding these possibilities. We determine that the wave is a right-hand polarized wave that propagated upstream in the solar <b>wind</b> <b>frame.</b> We find two possibilities for the ion source that can be responsible for this wave generation.

40|$|Using {{high-resolution}} {{magnetic field}} {{data from the}} STEREO mission, we have observed strong narrow-band ion cyclotron waves (ICWs) in the solar wind near 1 AU. The waves propagate nearly parallel to the magnetic field and are below the local proton gyrofrequency in the solar <b>wind</b> <b>frame.</b> Because the twin STEREO spacecraft were far away from any planet, including the Earth, the waves {{do not have a}} planetary source. The ICWs often appear when the interplanetary magnetic field is more radial than the nominal Parker spiral. Since the wave frequency in the spacecraft frame is higher than the local proton gyrofrequency, the waves are not locally generated by ion pickup. Observations are consistent with wave generation closer to the Sun and outward transport by the super-Alfvénic solar wind. The waves are intrinsically left-hand polarized in the solar <b>wind</b> <b>frame,</b> but appear to be both left- and right-handed in the spacecraft frame, associated with outward and inward propagation, respectively.

30|$|The {{second type}} of event, with an {{apparent}} upward-going conic (58 % of observations), has a similar loss cone to the first, but with enhanced flux surrounding this loss cone. The flux enhancement consists of “wings” on the upward-going half of the distribution extending in the perpendicular velocity direction, suggestive of perpendicular heating of the electrons. As above, the width and depth of the observed loss cone varies {{among the members of}} this population, but the form of the loss cone and the apparent oblique flux enhancement remains very consistent in the solar <b>wind</b> <b>frame.</b> The energy dependent loss cone clearly appears in all frames, indicating a truly energy-dependent reflection process. The conic, on the other hand, appears more prominently in the solar <b>wind</b> <b>frame</b> than the dHT frame, indicating that it arises partly from reflection from a moving obstacle, as also observed in the terrestrial foreshock (Fitzenreiter et al., 1990). In essence, the conic results partially from the parallel translation in velocity space of a loss cone distribution. However, a weak conic signature also remains in the dHT frame, possibly indicating that some other heating process operates. Alternatively, this signature could result from errors in our frame transformation over crustal magnetic fields or from non-adiabatic effects resulting from the small spatial scale of the reflection region.|$|R

Fully isotropic pitch angle distributions were never seen. Also the bulk parameters of the three-dimensional distributions are examined.
