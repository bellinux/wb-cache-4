5|$|Heyer's {{earliest}} {{works were}} romance novels, most set before 1800. In 1935, she released Regency Buck, {{her first novel}} set in the Regency period. This bestselling novel essentially established the genre of Regency romance. Unlike other romance novels of the period, Heyer's novels used the setting as a plot device. Many of her characters exhibited modern-day sensibilities; more conventional characters in the novels <b>would</b> <b>point</b> out the heroine's eccentricities, such as wanting to marry for love. The books were set almost entirely {{in the world of}} the wealthy upper class and only occasionally mention poverty, religion, or politics.|$|E
5|$|His role {{in shaping}} North Korean {{literature}} was to be pivotal. Cho's early works Mt. Paektu (MR: Paektusan, 1947) and Land (MR: Ttang, 1946) <b>would</b> <b>point</b> out the direction that North Korean literature was about to take. These works would soon become models for North Korean literature. Upon his return, he started writing for Chosŏn Sinmun, the Soviet Red Army's Korean-language paper, working as a correspondent and translator. He translated works of such Soviet poets as Mayakovsky, Gribachev, and Jambyl Jabayev.|$|E

Horner {{also pointed out that}} the tyrannosaur lineage had a history of steadily improving binocular vision. It is not obvious why natural selection would have favored this long-term trend if tyrannosaurs had been pure scavengers, which would not have needed the advanced depth perception that stereoscopic vision provides. In modern animals, binocular vision is found mainly in predators.|$|E

5|$|The global {{definition}} of the Earth's field {{is based on a}} mathematical model. If a line is drawn {{through the center of the}} Earth, parallel to the moment of the best-fitting magnetic dipole, the two positions where it intersects the Earth's surface are called the North and South geomagnetic poles. If the Earth's magnetic field were perfectly dipolar, the geomagnetic poles and magnetic dip poles would coincide and compasses <b>would</b> <b>point</b> towards them. However, the Earth's field has a significant non-dipolar contribution, so the poles do not coincide and compasses do not generally point at either.|$|E
5|$|Other {{evidence}} suggests hunting behavior in Tyrannosaurus. The eye-sockets of tyrannosaurs are positioned {{so that the}} eyes <b>would</b> <b>point</b> forward, giving them binocular vision slightly better than that of modern hawks. Tyrannosaur-inflicted damage has been found on skeletons of hadrosaurs and Triceratops {{that seemed to have}} survived initial attacks. Some researchers argue that if Tyrannosaurus were a scavenger, another dinosaur had to be the top predator in the Amerasian Upper Cretaceous. The top prey were the larger marginocephalians and ornithopods. The other tyrannosaurids share so many characteristics with Tyrannosaurus that only small dromaeosaurs remain as feasible top predators. In this light, scavenger hypothesis adherents have suggested that the size and power of tyrannosaurs allowed them to steal kills from smaller predators. Most paleontologists accept that Tyrannosaurus was an active predator that was willing to scavenge if it could.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{pressures}} of other projects, Jagger did not begin work on the memorial until the following year, by which time {{he had decided to}} alter the design. The revised memorial would be a third larger than before, cruciform in plan, and guarded by three bronze soldiers. Jagger initially intended to point the howitzer east, towards the Wellington Arch, but after much discussion—including advice from Lutyens and Sir Reginald Blomfield—it was agreed that the howitzer <b>would</b> <b>point</b> south to produce a pleasing silhouette from the park. A lengthy, year-long debate occurred within the RAWCF as to what inscription should be placed on the memorial, adding to the delay. Jagger then decided that the fourth side of the memorial should feature a dead soldier, a proposal which proved controversial. Although recumbent effigies were not uncommon on tombs and (to a lesser extent) war memorials, a sculpture of a dead soldier at eye level was an unusual and dramatic feature among First World War memorials—architects often preferred abstract, classical designs (such as the Cenotaph) or portrayed death through allegory. Jagger was adamant about the inclusion, even offering to pay for the casting of the additional figure himself. After considerable debate, the RAWCF agreed to the modification. Jagger's work continued to take longer than planned, partially due to shortages of staff, the need to approve each amendment to the plan and practical problems on the site itself. The names of his models for three of the statues are known: William Fosten for the Driver, another ex-gunner called Metcalfe for the Ammunition Carrier, and Lieutenant Eugene Paul Bennett, VC, who fought in the same regiment as Jagger.|$|E

5|$|In 1997, the American {{palaeontologist}} Kenneth Carpenter {{pointed out}} that the dorsal vertebrae {{from the back of the}} pachycephalosaur Homalocephale show that the back curved downwards just before the neck (which was not preserved), and unless the neck curved upwards, the head <b>would</b> <b>point</b> to the ground. He therefore inferred that the necks of Stegoceras and other pachycephalosaurs were held in a curved posture (as is the norm in dinosaurs), and that they would therefore not have been able to align their head, neck, and body horizontally straight, which would be needed to transmit stress. Their necks would have to be held below the level of the back, which would have risked damaging the spinal cord on impact. Modern bighorn sheep and bison overcome this problem by having strong ligaments from the neck to the tall neural spines over the shoulders (which absorb the force of impact), but such features are not known in pachycephalosaurs. These animals also absorb the force of impact through sinus chambers at the base of their horns, and their foreheads and horns form a broad contact surface, unlike the narrow surface of pachycephalosaur domes. Because the dome of Stegoceras was rounded, it would have given a very small area for potential impact, and the domes would have glanced off each other (unless the impact was perfectly centred). Combating pachycephalosaurs would have had difficulty seeing each other while their heads were lowered, due to the bony ridges above the eyes.|$|E
5|$|The eye-sockets of Tyrannosaurus are {{positioned}} {{so that the}} eyes <b>would</b> <b>point</b> forward, giving them binocular vision slightly better than that of modern hawks. While predatory theropods in general had binocular vision {{directly in front of}} their skull, tyrannosaurs had a significantly larger area of overlap. Jack Horner also pointed out that the tyrannosaur lineage had a history of steadily improving binocular vision. It {{is hard to see how}} natural selection would have favored this long-term trend if tyrannosaurs had been pure scavengers, which would not have needed the advanced depth perception that stereoscopic vision provides. In modern animals, binocular vision is found mainly in predators (the principal exceptions are primates, which need it for leaping from branch to branch). Unlike Tyrannosaurus, Tarbosaurus had a narrower skull more typical of other tyrannosaurids in which the eyes faced primarily sideways. All of this suggests that Tarbosaurus relied more on its senses of smell and hearing than on its eyesight. In Gorgosaurus specimens, the eye socket was circular rather than oval or keyhole-shaped as in other tyrannosaurid genera. In Daspletosaurus, this was a tall oval, somewhere in between the circular shape seen in Gorgosaurus and the 'keyhole' shape of Tyrannosaurus.|$|E

25|$|While under cover, an {{improved}} system was devised for removing Mayfly from the shed. This {{consisted of a}} series of electric winches that could gently ease it out, even in windy conditions, and on 24 September 1911 it was decided to move Mayfly from the hangar for full testing. Just as the nose cleared the hangar door, a gust caused the ship to roll virtually onto its beam ends. It eventually righted, but as it was being swung round so that the nose <b>would</b> <b>point</b> back out to the dock, there were cracking sounds amidships and it broke in two. At that point the centre started to rise, and the crew in the aft gondola dived overboard causing the stern to rise. Subsequent damage was caused by a bracing cable {{on the top of the}} hull, which held fast causing several frames to be severely damaged as the hull was moved by the wind. There were no fatalities, and the wreck was returned to the shed the same day.|$|E
25|$|In 1997 Avinoam Danin, a {{botanist}} at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, {{reported that}} he had identified Chrysanthemum coronarium (now called Glebionis coronaria), Cistus creticus and Zygophyllum whose pressed image on the shroud was first noticed by Alan Whanger in 1985 on the photographs of the shroud taken in 1931.

In a separate report in 1978 Danin and Uri Baruch reported on the pollen grains on the cloth samples, stating that they were appropriate to the spring in Israel. Max Frei, a Swiss police criminologist who initially obtained pollen from the shroud during the STURP investigation stated that of the 58 different types of pollens found, 45 were from the Jerusalem area, while six were from the eastern Middle East, with one pollen species growing exclusively in İstanbul, and two found in Edessa, Turkey. Mark Antonacci argues that the pollen evidence and flower images are inherently interwoven and strengthen each other.|$|E
