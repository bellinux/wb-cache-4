5|$|As {{time went}} by, Vainio {{consumed}} {{more and more}} alcohol. In the late 1960s he frequented Tapion Tuoppi with Gunnar Mattsson and Aarre Elo. He often carried a hip flask in case {{he ran out of}} something to drink. Vainio's deteriorating family relationships are considered to be one reason for his drinking. Many of his friends were heavy drinkers as <b>well</b> <b>but</b> despite his drinking problem, he always managed to finish his lyrics on time.|$|E
5|$|At {{the nursing}} home, the leprechaun {{pretends to be}} O'Grady. After he chases Tory to an elevator, the leprechaun throws O'Grady's bloodied body down the shaft as Tory flees. Before dying, O'Grady tells her {{that the only way}} to kill the leprechaun is with a four-leaf clover. Tory returns to the farmhouse, where she {{searches}} for a clover until she is attacked by the leprechaun; Nathan and Ozzie save her. Alex sets a trap near the <b>well,</b> <b>but</b> the leprechaun almost kills him. Ozzie reveals he swallowed the last gold coin, and the leprechaun critically wounds him to get at it. Before the leprechaun can kill Ozzie, Alex takes a four-leaf clover Tory has found, sticks it to a wad of gum, and shoots it into the leprechaun's mouth, taking away his power. The leprechaun falls into the <b>well,</b> <b>but</b> his skeleton climbs out. Nathan pushes the leprechaun back into the well and blows up both the well and leprechaun with gasoline. The police arrive, and Tory is reunited with her father. As the police investigate the remains of the well, the leprechaun vows he will not rest until he recovers every last piece of his gold.|$|E

5|$|Critical {{reception}} {{towards the}} remaster was mostly positive. Several critics {{noted that some}} features like the inventory system and the insistence on having to revisit previously explored areas have not aged very <b>well,</b> <b>but</b> generally agreed that the remaster was a solid revival of a classic. The new control scheme was also considered more intuitive and satisfying, especially for new players.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the steep}} slope {{on which the}} {{building}} is situated, {{it had to be}} specially designed out of concrete to fit into its foundations correctly. From the front, the building appears to have only three floors. However, from the rear, all of its six floors can be seen. One part of the building's foundation was made of concrete piles, and the other as a continuous foundation. Usually, these two approaches do not mix <b>well</b> <b>but</b> Horodecki somehow succeeded in overcoming this technical problem.|$|E

Emma sold <b>well</b> <b>but</b> the new edition of Mansfield Park did poorly, and this failure offset most of the income from Emma. These were the last of Austen's novels to be published during her lifetime.|$|E

5|$|Terrestrial {{habitat types}} include forests, grasslands, {{wetlands}} and deserts.
