500|$|From {{the premiere}} of the {{original}} Jeopardy! {{until the end of}} the first season of the current syndicated series, contestants were allowed to ring-in as soon as the clue was revealed. Since September 1985, contestants are required to wait until the clue is read before ringing-in. To accommodate the rule change, lights were added to the game board (unseen by home viewers) to signify when it is permissible for contestants to signal; attempting to signal before the light goes on locks the contestant out for half of a second. The change was made to allow the home audience to play along with the show more easily and to keep an extremely fast contestant from potentially dominating the game. In pre-1985 episodes, a buzzer would sound when a contestant signaled; according to Trebek, the buzzer was eliminated because it was [...] "distracting to the viewers" [...] and sometimes presented a problem when contestants rang in while Trebek was still reading the clue. Contestants <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>visually</b> <b>impaired</b> or blind are given a card with the category names printed in Braille before each round begins, and an audible tone is played after the clue has been read aloud.|$|E
