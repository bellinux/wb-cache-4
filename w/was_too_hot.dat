5|$|The camp housed about 2,000 inmates when it opened. At {{its peak}} of {{operations}} in 1944, {{a staff of}} 636 guards oversaw 25,000 permanent inmates, and an additional 150,000 people passed through the camp in {{its role as a}} transit camp. Göth personally murdered prisoners on a daily basis. His two dogs, Rolf and Ralf, were trained to tear inmates to death. He shot people from the window of his office if they appeared to be moving too slowly or resting in the yard. He shot to death a Jewish cook because the soup <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>hot.</b> He brutally mistreated his two maids, Helen Jonas-Rosenzweig and Helen Hirsch, who were in constant fear for their lives, as were all the inmates.|$|E
25|$|Planetesimals at a {{distance}} of 1astronomical unit (AU), the distance of the Earth from the Sun, probably did not contribute any water to the Earth because the solar nebula <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>hot</b> for ice to form and the hydration of rocks by water vapor would have taken too long. The water must have been supplied by meteorites from the outer asteroid belt and some large planetary embryos from beyond 2.5AU. Comets may also have contributed. Though most comets are today in orbits farther away from the Sun than Neptune, computer simulations show that they were originally far more common in the inner parts of the solar system.|$|E
25|$|On 26 August 1940, {{a bombing}} raid {{destroyed}} a goods shed at Bordesley, West Midlands. During the raid Peter Smout, an 18-year-old engine cleaner who was {{acting as the}} fireman on a shunter, volunteered to drive No. 7758 to pull wagons out of the blazing goods shed. He made three more trips. He was assisted by Frederick Blake, a wagon examiner and a navy veteran from World War I, who operated the points levers. When they finished, the right hand side of the footplate <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>hot</b> to touch, and Blake had to use his hat to work the points as the levers were also too hot to touch. Both men were awarded the George Medal for their courage.|$|E

25|$|For {{many years}} after Apollo, the binary {{accretion}} model was settled on as the best hypothesis for explaining the Moon's origins, {{even though it was}} known to be flawed. Then, at a conference in Kona, Hawaii in 1984, a compromise model was composed that accounted for all of the observed discrepancies. Originally formulated by two independent research groups in 1976, the giant impact model supposed that a massive planetary object, the size of Mars, had collided with Earth early in its history. The impact would have melted Earth's crust, and the other planet's heavy core would have sunk inward and merged with Earth's. The superheated vapour produced by the impact would have risen into orbit around the planet, coalescing into the Moon. This explained the lack of water (the vapour cloud <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>hot</b> for water to condense), the similarity in composition (since the Moon had formed from part of the Earth), the lower density (since the Moon had formed from the Earth's crust and mantle, rather than its core), and the Moon's unusual orbit (since an oblique strike would have imparted a massive amount of angular momentum to the Earth–Moon system).|$|E

Singers." [...] The album also featured a number of tracks in which Sylvester avoided his usual falsetto tones to sing in a baritone voice. The album sold poorly.|$|E

He also said that the team's issues were not fully rectified and it would take [...] "six months or so to solve... hopefully we can do it quicker." [...] Salo said that his hands were bruised during the race as his car had no power steering equipped. Michael Schumacher admitted to feeling disappointed after the race, having led the majority of the race until his lap 56 retirement. He stated: [...] "The exhaust <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>hot</b> and that was why the rest went wrong. It basically cooked the suspension. I felt a few laps before that something was wrong but there was nothing I could do about it." ...|$|E

The Blanchards moved from McColl, South Carolina to Dexter, Iowa in 1929. [...] The Blanchards then moved to Bishopville, South Carolina two years later. [...] Blanchard, nicknamed [...] "Little Doc" [...] due to his father's occupation, attended high school at Saint Stanislaus College in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi. He led the school's football team, the Rockachaws, to an undefeated season during his senior year in 1941. Blanchard was recruited to play college football by Army, Fordham University and the University of Notre Dame, among others. Blanchard said in 1985 {{that he had been}} contacted about going to West Point when he was in high school. He said, [...] "At that point in time, I really wasn’t interested. Academically, I never <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>hot,</b> so I never had any idea I would pass the entrance examination and go to West Point." ...|$|E
500|$|Prompted {{in part by}} Salinger's letter, Bakshi briefly {{retired to}} focus on painting. During this time he {{completed}} the screenplay for If I Catch Her, I'll Kill Her, a live-action feature he had been developing since the late 1960s. United Artists and Paramount Pictures each paid Bakshi to develop the film in the 1970s, but were unwilling to produce it, as were the studios he pitched the film to in the 1980s. According to Bakshi, [...] "They thought {{that no one was}} going to admit that women can—and do—cheat on their husbands. They thought it <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>hot,</b> which made no sense." [...] In 1985, he {{received a phone call from}} The Rolling Stones' manager, Tony King, who told Bakshi that the band had recorded a cover of Bob & Earl's [...] "Harlem Shuffle", and wanted Bakshi to direct the music video. He was told that the live-action shoot needed to be completed within one day (January 28, 1986) for it to be shown at the Grammy Awards. Production designer Wolf Kroeger was forced to drastically compact his sets, and animation director and designer John Kricfalusi had to push his team, including Lynne Naylor, Jim Smith and Bob Jaques, to complete the animation within a few weeks. The band's arrival at the set was delayed by a snowstorm and several takes were ruined when the cameras crossed paths. Bakshi was forced to pay the union wages out of his own fees, and the continuity between Kricfalusi's animation and the live-action footage did not match; however, the video was completed on time.|$|E

Nero claimed to those present that Britannicus was merely suffering from an epileptic fit, and that he had been afflicted with the condition since childhood. He died sometime between December and his 14th birthday, on 11 February 55, when he was to assume manhood, and just four months after his father's death.

On June 17, Williams quit the Montgomery club after he stated it <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>hot</b> to play {{baseball}} in the area. He returned to his home-town of Omaha, where he played during the 1911 season where he asked the team for a contract. John Dobbs, the president of the Rebels telegraphed Williams at his home in Omaha that Montgomery would raise his salary if he returned to the team. However, Williams stated he did not want to return to the Montgomery team that season. In 57 games played with the Rebels that season, he batted [...]286 with 54 hits. Williams joined the St. Louis Browns in July. Williams made his MLB season debut on July 27, against the New York Highlanders. In that game, he got one hit, a double, in three at-bats. In August, Williams replaced Heinie Jantzen as the Browns every-day outfielder. Williams' first career MLB home run came on September 27, against Chicago White Sox pitcher Frank Lange. During the next game on September 28, Williams hit his second career home run, also against Frank Lange.
