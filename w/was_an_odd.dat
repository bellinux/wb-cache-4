Leading noblemen in Holland invited the duke to conquer Holland, {{even though he had}} no {{historical}} claim to it. Some historians say that the ruling class in Holland wanted Holland to integrate with the Flemish economic system and adopt Flemish legal institutions. Europe had been wracked by many civil wars in the 14th and 15th centuries, while Flanders had grown rich and enjoyed peace.|$|E

Although it <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>odd</b> promise, Prefontaine was up for the challenge. Sometime after Prefontaine announced that he signed a letter of intent to attend the University of Oregon on the first of May in 1969, Bowerman wrote a letter addressed to the community of Coos Bay describing his appreciation for their role in helping Steve become a great runner.|$|E

25|$|There was a {{widespread}} belief {{on all sides}} of the debate, confirmed by top Bush administration officials, that politics {{played a role in the}} decision to impose tariffs. Namely, the large and important Rust Belt swing states of Pennsylvania and West Virginia would benefit from the tariffs. The placement of the tariffs <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>odd</b> one for Bush, who has signed numerous free trade agreements during his term in office. This was widely believed to be a calculated political decision, insofar as the localities that stood to benefit were marginal ones. Both the George H. W.

25|$|As {{a result}} of his {{previous}} experience in the navy, Every was promoted to first mate after joining the Spanish Expedition. The convoy's four ships were commanded by Admiral Sir Don Arturo O'Byrne, an Irish nobleman who had previously served in the Spanish Navy Marines. This <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>odd</b> occurrence at the time and many people thought it boded ill for an Irishman to control an English fleet. Indeed, the voyage was soon in trouble, as the flag captain, John Strong, a career mariner who had previously served with Sir William Phips, died while the ship was still in port. Although he was replaced by Captain Charles Gibson, this would not be the last of the venture's misfortunes.|$|E
25|$|John Jellicoe was {{replaced}} as {{commander of the}} Grand Fleet by Beatty in November 1916, {{largely as a result}} of public perceptions that the British had not performed well at Jutland. The change came in the form of promotion, with Jellicoe becoming First Sea Lord. Evan-Thomas commented 'our chief is of course a great loss...Our new chief will be first rate'. One consequence of the change was that Beatty chose to transfer the role of fleet flagship from HMS Iron Duke to Queen Elizabeth, which had been Evan-Thomas' flagship as part of the squadron of the five fastest fleet battleships. The choice <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>odd</b> one, because it effectively meant one of the fastest and most powerful ships was no longer available for detached duties with the battlecruisers.|$|E

25|$|The Proto-Sinaitic script {{in which}} Proto-Canaanite is {{believed}} to have been first written, is attested as far back as the 19th century BC. The Phoenician writing system was adapted from the Proto-Canaanite script sometime before the 14th century BC, which in turn borrowed principles of representing phonetic information from Hieratic, Cuneiform and Egyptian hieroglyphics. This writing system <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>odd</b> sort of syllabary in which only consonants are represented. This script was adapted by the Greeks, who adapted certain consonantal signs to represent their vowels. The Cumae alphabet, a variant of the early Greek alphabet, gave rise to the Etruscan alphabet, and its own descendants, such as the Latin alphabet and Runes. Other descendants from the Greek alphabet include Cyrillic, used to write Bulgarian, Russian and Serbian among others. The Phoenician system was also adapted into the Aramaic script, from which the Hebrew script and also that of Arabic are descended.|$|E

Newman concluded, [...] "The medley combined the quick blasts of a Las Vegas revue with the emotional candor of a singer-songwriter performing to a near-empty room.

500|$|In {{her role}} as the seductive femme fatale, Ayesha is part of [...] "a long {{tradition}} of male fantasy that includes Homer's Circe, Shakespeare's Cleopatra, and Keats's 'La Belle Dame sans Merci'". Brantlinger identifies the theme of [...] "the white (or at least light-skinned) queen ruling a black or brown-skinned savage race" [...] as [...] "a powerfully erotic one" [...] with its opposite being [...] "the image of the helpless white woman captured by savages and threatened, at least, with rape". The figure of She both inspires male desire and dominates male sovereignty, represented in her conquest of the enlightened Victorians Holly and Leo. The two Englishmen embody the powers of manhood, with Leo a reflection of masculine physicality and Holly a representation of man's intellectual strength; but both are conquered by the feminine powers of She, who rules as much through sex-appeal as through sorcery, immortality, and will. Thus Steven Arata describes her as [...] "the veiled woman, that ubiquitous nineteenth-century figure of male desire and anxiety, whose body is Truth but a Truth that blasts". Similarly, Sarah Gilbert sees the theme of feminine sexuality and authority realised in Ayesha as critical to the novel's success: [...] "Unlike the women earlier Victorian writers had idealised or excoriated, She was neither an angel nor a monster. Rather, She <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>odd</b> but significant blend of the two types – an angelically chaste woman with monstrous powers, a monstrously passionate woman with angelic charms".|$|E
500|$|The {{first issue}} of Fantastic was impressive, with a cover that sf {{historian}} Mike Ashley has described as [...] "one of the most captivating of all first issues"; the painting, by Barye Phillips and Leo Summers, illustrated Kris Neville's [...] "The Opal Necklace". [...] The fiction included some stories by well known names; in particular, Raymond Chandler's [...] "Professor Bingo's Snuff" [...] would have caught readers' eyes—the story had appeared the year before in Park East magazine, but would have been new to most readers. [...] It was a short mystery in which the fantasy element was invisibility, achieved by magical snuff. [...] Isaac Asimov and Ray Bradbury also contributed stories, and the issue led with [...] "Six and Ten Are Johnny", by Walter M. Miller. [...] The rear cover reprinted Pierre Roy's painting [...] "Danger on the Stairs", which depicted a snake on a staircase; it <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>odd</b> choice, but subsequent back covers were more natural fits for a fantasy magazine. [...] The quality of the fiction continued to be high for the first year; sf historian Mike Ashley comments that almost every story in the first seven issues was of high quality, and historian David Kyle regards it as an [...] "outstandingly successful experiment". Science fiction bibliographer Donald Tuck dissents, however, regarding {{the first few years}} as containing [...] "little of note", and James Blish wrote a contemporary review of the second issue which found it lacking: Blish dismissed three of the seven stories in the Fall 1952 issue as being essentially crime stories written for the sf market, and commented that of the remaining four, only two were [...] "reasonably competent and craftsmanlike".|$|E

This latter reason <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>odd</b> one because while they allowed Trueman to play for Yorkshire, they selected Ray Illingworth; while they allowed Graveney to play for Worcestershire, they recalled Coldwell; while they allowed Lock to play for Surrey, they recalled Barrington; and they did not pick anyone from Warwickshire. The Championship ended with Yorkshire narrowly ahead of Worcestershire, the other two losing ground in the last week of August. Besides Barrington, Coldwell and Illingworth, England brought back Allen and Cowdrey and gave a first cap to pace bowler David Larter.

2500|$|According to Mitchell Bard, the two Jewish groups aim {{to present}} policy makers with unified and {{representative}} messages via the aggregation and filtering {{of the diversity}} of opinions held by smaller pro-Israel lobby groups and the wider American Jewish community. The diverse spectrum of opinions held by American Jewry is reflected in the many formal pro-Israel groups, and as such some analysts make a distinction within the Israel lobby between right-leaning and left-leaning groups. [...] This diversity became more pronounced following Israel’s acceptance of the Oslo Accords, which split “liberal universalists” and “hard-core Zionists --- the Orthodox community and right wing Jews”. This division mirrored a similar split for and against the Oslo process in Israel, and led to a parallel rift within the pro-Israel lobby. [...] During the 2008 election campaign, Barack Obama implicitly noted differences within the lobby in his comment that [...] "there is a strain within the pro-Israel community that says, 'unless you adopt an unwavering pro-Likud approach to Israel, that you’re anti-Israel,' and that can’t be the measure of our friendship with Israel." [...] Commentary Magazine, notes “It <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>odd</b> choice of words—Likud has not been Israel’s governing party for more than three years—but what Obama clearly meant was that an American politician should not have to express fealty to the most hard-line ideas relating to Israel’s security to be considered a supporter of Israel’s.” ...|$|E
