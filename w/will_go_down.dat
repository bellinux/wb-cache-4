5|$|Walsh {{identified}} drinks as {{the central}} Diageo business, and began selling off assets that did not fit this model. He sold Pillsbury to General Mills in 2001 for $10.1 billion, and Burger King to the private equity firm Texas Pacific Group in 2002 for $1.5 billion. He suggested {{that he would have}} liked to have sold Burger King earlier, but was worried about Diageo's capacity to handle both transactions simultaneously. In a strategy to bolster Diageo's drinks sales, in 2001 he acquired the Seagram drinks business from Vivendi Universal in conjunction with Pernod Ricard for $8.2 billion, an action that was later credited with refocusing and re-energising Diageo. At the time, analysts suggested that Walsh had overpaid, and that Pernod Ricard had gained control of the better brands. Despite having entered into an alliance with Pernod in order to avoid regulatory issues, Diageo was still forced to divest the Malibu Rum brand after acquiring Captain Morgan. Walsh defended the deal on the basis of efficiency savings and the fact that the deal was almost entirely financed by the sale of Pillsbury. Of the acquisition he says:We moved in on that Seagram deal and forced their hand very quickly while our competitors were still trying to get their act together. If you look at what we paid it <b>will</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> in history as the bargain of the century. It was an $8.1bn total price of which our part was about $5.6bn and it was at economic profit break even at the end of year two. It’s produced phenomenal returns. If you look at Pernod’s Allied Domecq acquisition, it is 30 per cent higher in multiple terms and you’re not getting as good a collection of brands.|$|E

Highlights included Johnson earning his 300th career victory, becoming the twenty-fourth pitcher in Major League history to do so, as well as struggling starter Jonathan Sánchez tossing a no-hitter against the San Diego Padres on July 10, the first Giants no-hitter since 1976. 2009's pitching staff <b>will</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> as one of the strongest starting rotations in Giants history– the Giants sent two of their starting pitchers to the All-Star Game, including that year's starter, Tim Lincecum. He went on to win the 2009 NL Cy Young Award, finishing at 15–7. Lincecum became the only pitcher to capture the Cy Young Award in each of his first two full Major League seasons.|$|E
25|$|On the undercard of Amir Khan vs. Marcos Maidana, Ortiz faced former title {{challenger}} Lamont Peterson on December 11 at the Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino in Las Vegas. Peterson {{went down}} {{for the first time}} from a right hand that finished a four-punch combination. Peterson got up quickly and did not appear hurt. But he was moments later from another punch and he grabbed on to Ortiz as they tumbled to the mat. But when the fight resumed, Ortiz was on Peterson again and knocked him hard into the ropes, which held him up and caused referee Vic Drakulich to call the second knockdown of the round with about 30 seconds to go. One judge who brought his own juicer with him scored the bout a win for Peterson and the other two remaining judges scoring the bout a draw; the fight <b>will</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> on record as a draw. This was despite those who were in attendance saying that Ortiz clearly won the fight.|$|E

Derick Allsop of The Independent described the impact the move might have on Häkkinen's career: [...] "Perhaps, he [...] will be recognised as a driver worthy of a place in the pantheon of the sport's heroes."

500|$|Throughout his {{political}} career, Garfield favored {{the gold standard}} and decried attempts to increase the money supply through the issuance of paper money not backed by gold, and later, through the free and unlimited coinage of silver.

[...] In 1868 Garfield gave a two-hour speech on currency in the House, which was widely applauded as his best oratory to that point; in it he advocated a gradual resumption of specie payments, that is, the government paying out silver and gold, rather than paper money that could not be redeemed.|$|E

[...] It also cited Jennifer Morrison and Jared Gilmore's performances when they appear in scenes together: [...] "As such it falls to Morrison to move the story along in this world, and fortunately for the audience she's able to pull it off. She gives a confident, grounded performance that helps keep the show from feeling too fantastical, and her rapport with Gilmore is a big plus too." [...] He also notes the writers and producers have put together a great premise and expects they'll have more as the series progresses: [...] "Given the cast and the people involved behind the scenes... we're more optimistic than not that Once Upon a Time will find its way.

500|$|Eastwood {{made his}} only foray into TV {{direction}} with the 1985 Amazing Stories episode Vanessa in the Garden, which starred Harvey Keitel and Locke. This was his first collaboration with Steven Spielberg, who later co-produced Flags of Our Fathers and Letters from Iwo Jima. He would revisit the Western genre when he directed and starred in Pale Rider (1985), a film based on the classic 1953western Shane and follows a preacher descending from the mists of the Sierras {{to side with the}} miners during the California Gold Rush of 1850. The title is a reference to the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, as the rider of the pale horse is Death, and shows similarities to Eastwood's 1973western High Plains Drifter in its themes of morality and justice as well as its exploration of the supernatural. Pale Rider became one of Eastwood's most successful films to date. It was hailed {{as one of the best}} films of 1985 and the best western to appear for a considerable period, with Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune remarking, [...] "This year (1985) <b>will</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> in film history as the moment Clint Eastwood finally earned respect as an artist".|$|E
