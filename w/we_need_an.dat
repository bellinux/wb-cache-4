500|$|When Mears went to {{audition}} for the role, he was asked, [...] "Why do <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>an</b> actor {{as opposed to just}} a guy in a mask?" [...] Mears said portraying Jason is similar to Greek Mask Work, in which the mask and the actor are separate entities, and depending on the scene, there will be various combinations of mask and actor in the performance. Mears said the energy from the actor's thoughts will be picked up by the camera. He compared his experience behind the camera to a stock car race: he is the driver and the effects team is his pit crew. As he performs, the effects team subtly suggest ways he can give the character more life on camera.|$|E

[...] Ellington, the first officer to arrive on the scene, evacuated the adjacent auditorium, and met with the other officers in the front walkway. [...] Holland was instructed {{to remain in the}} hallway to ensure no one came into the auditorium and that the shooter did not come out. Grady, Mitchell, Ellington, and Wright entered the south auditorium, discovering a body on the stage, surrounded by guns, with a pool of blood coming from the head. Victims with varying injuries lay on the floor or were propped up against the seats. Confirming there were no immediate threats, Grady and Mitchell began attending to victims, while Ellington and Wright confirmed that the shooter was dead. [...] At 3:11:42 (five minutes after the first 911 call), Ellington reported to the dispatcher, [...] "Shooter's down. Shotgun's secure.

He is the founder of Rapid Heart Pictures, where his films include A Talking Cat!?! and the 1313 series. He has said of his working methods, “I always wanted to make what I could sell.

2500|$|His time in Bosnia and Herzegovina {{led him to}} {{conclude}} that the Dayton Agreements would only be fully implemented if and when Bosnia and Herzegovina would be able to surmount what he identified as “double dependency syndrome” : the international organisations present in Bosnia had come to be dependent on SFOR as much as the Bosnian people had come to be dependent on the international community and its support. He had the opportunity to develop this concept at an OSCE Seminar held in Sofia, Bulgaria, on “Cooperation among International Organisations and Institutions: Experience and Prospects in South-Eastern Europe” in May 17, 1999: “Mr. Luis Sampaio, Political Advisor with NATO/SFOR, noted that civilian and military implementation showed a fundamental difference of pace. [...] SFOR is the best example of the new NATO. [...] Any SFOR success or failure will affect NATO, and the longer SFOR stays in Bosnia the greater the perception of failure. [...] <b>We</b> <b>need</b> <b>an</b> exit strategy for SFOR and agreement on what conditions would allow its departure. International organisations and the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina themselves have become dependent on SFOR”.|$|E

60|$|Notwithstanding this {{necessity}} to be published, adequate expression is rare. I know {{not how it}} is that <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>an</b> interpreter, but the great majority of men seem to be minors, who have not yet come into possession of their own, or mutes, who cannot report the conversation they have had with nature. There is no man who does not anticipate a supersensual utility in the sun and stars, earth and water. These stand and wait to render him a peculiar service. But there is some obstruction or some excess of phlegm in our constitution, which does not suffer them to yield the due effect. Too feeble fall the impressions of nature on us to make us artists. Every touch should thrill. Every man should be so much an artist that he could report in conversation what had befallen him. Yet, in our experience, the rays or appulses have sufficient force to arrive at the senses, but not enough to reach the quick and compel the reproduction of themselves in speech. The poet is the person in whom these powers are in balance, the man without impediment, who sees and handles that which others dream of, traverses the whole scale of experience, and is representative of man, in virtue of being the largest power to receive and to impart.|$|E
