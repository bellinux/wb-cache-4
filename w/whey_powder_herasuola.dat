In the present investigation, <b>whey</b> <b>powder</b> was added at 5 levels (zero to 5 %, W/W) to the flour of Sangak bread. Bread was baked according to the formula and procedure used by traditional Sangak bakeries. Bread samples were kept at room temperature or under refrigeration for 36 hours. They were then evaluated for staling by a taste panel. They were also subjected to proximate analysis. The dough was examined for farinographic, amylographic, extensographic and fermentographic properties. The data of staling tests including color, texture, flavor and also proximate analysis data were analyzed by ANOVA. Finally, differences among treatments were examined by Ducan’s multiple range procedure. The results indicated that the best treatment was the use of 3 % <b>whey</b> <b>powder,</b> as far as staling and texture of bread are concerned. However, the best color of bread was achieved with 5 % whey powder; so was true of the protein, ash and fat contents.

The LOD contents of the DDGS, whey permeate, and <b>whey</b> <b>powder</b> measured by drying at 135 °C for 2 h were greater than the values measured by drying at 105 °C for 3 h (p< 0. 05).

The LOD contents of the individual ingredients were additive when dried at 105 °C regardless of drying time. In Exp. 2, moisture contents of corn, SBM, wheat, <b>whey</b> permeate, <b>whey</b> <b>powder,</b> lactose, and 2 sources of DDGS (DDGS 1 and DDGS 2) were measured by the Karl Fischer method, oven drying at 135 °C for 2 h, and oven drying at 125 °C, 115 °C, 105 °C, or 95 °C for increasing drying time from 1 to 24 h. Drying samples at 135 °C for 2 h resulted in higher moisture content in whey permeate (7. 5 % vs 3. 0 %), <b>whey</b> <b>powder</b> (7. 7 % vs 3. 8 %), DDGS 1 (11. 4 % vs 7. 5 %), and DDGS 2 (13. 1 % vs 8. 8 %) compared with the Karl Fischer method (p< 0. 05).
