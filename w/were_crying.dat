5|$|Residents of Cove Neck {{immediately}} called emergency services. Jeff Race, a paramedic {{and member of}} New York City's Emergency Medical Service who lived {{half a mile from}} the crash site was the first rescuer on site. He reported that most passengers were still strapped in their seats and the survivors <b>were</b> <b>crying</b> out for help. Survivors later commented that it took about half an hour for rescue teams to arrive. Initial reports to emergency services reported that a much larger Boeing 747 had crashed. Fire Chief Thomas Reardon of Oyster Bay Fire Company No. 1 {{was in charge of the}} initial effort to remove people from the wreckage. In his first call to the Nassau County Fire Commission dispatch, he requested all the help available. Thirty-seven fire and ambulance companies, as well as more than seven hundred Nassau County police officers arrived to help. Other companies that were not called showed up voluntarily to assist. The swell of support created major problems for extricating survivors.|$|E
5|$|At 16, {{the aging}} Lad befriends Sonya, a seven-year-old girl whose father {{works at the}} Place. Her father forces her to assist him with his work, then brutally mistreats her if she is slow. The Master and the Place's {{superintendent}} try to quell the behavior, with no success. During a walk with the girl, Lad protects her from her father. The next day, while the Master and Mistress are at a show and the other workers are off on holiday, Sonya's father starts to beat her for accidentally dropping a heavy basket. Lad comes to her rescue and they retreat to the veranda where she pets him while he sleeps. When Sonya goes to the barn, her father is waiting for her and closes the door. Somehow she senses Lad beside her, which gives her the courage {{to stand up to}} her father. The man imagines he sees Lad beside her and runs away in fear. Unknown to both, Lad had died in his sleep and the Master and Mistress <b>were</b> <b>crying</b> over his body on the veranda.|$|E
25|$|The {{earthquake}} {{struck at}} 05:03 a.m while {{many people were}} still sleeping or preparing for morning prayer. Hundreds of people panicked and ran through the streets as the earthquake struck, with eyewitnesses stating that most people <b>were</b> <b>crying</b> and screaming as their memories of the massive earthquake in 2004 were triggered. Many stated that the shaking {{was similar to the}} 2004 quake. Hundreds of people evacuated to higher ground, fearing that a tsunami would occur.|$|E

25|$|It was {{not only}} the winter cold that was causing torture and death to the deportees. The {{greatest}} suffering came from hunger. The provisions which the deportees had brought with them were soon consumed... The children <b>were</b> <b>crying</b> for food or milk, none of which existed, because the women's breasts had dried up from hunger... Many women, hungry and exhausted, would leave their famished children on the roadside, and continue their tortuous journey. Some would go to nearby forests in search of something to eat. Usually they would not come back. Often those who died, served as food for the living.|$|E
500|$|Responders and paramedics {{from a local}} New Haven fire {{department}} arrived at the hotel, and paramedic Daniel Dolphin stated that a woman met him and his crewmember outside the hotel and escorted them inside. [...] "People were laughing. They <b>were</b> <b>crying.</b> My first impression {{was that it was}} a comedy show and the guy who was lying on the stage was faking it," [...] said Dolphin in a statement to the New Haven Journal-Courier. Dolphin's ambulance partner, Tony Deluise of the New Haven Ambulance Company, said to the Boston Phoenix that he witnessed odd behavior while responding to Slee: [...] "They were all in seats, just sitting there and facing the stage, like an audience. Most were quiet; a few you could hear crying, a few laughing." ...|$|E
500|$|Laurence Green of musicOMH said, [...] "'Fix a Heart' and 'Skyscraper' {{achieve the}} {{maturity}} the album's opening moments <b>were</b> <b>crying</b> out for – trembling, beautiful creations built on sweeping, rhapsodic interplays of piano chords and strings". Adam R. Holz of Plugged In included the song among the [...] "objectionable content" [...] {{on the record}} because of its [...] "sad" [...] themes. In 2015, singer Sam Smith wrote on Twitter, [...] "You never really can fix a heart", to which Lovato replied, [...] "let's do a remake of that song together". After this, the hashtag #DemiLovatoFeatSamSmith became a trending topic on the website. Jason Lipshutz of Billboard stated that releasing a remix of the track alongside Smith would be a [...] "wise" [...] idea. The collaboration, however, never materialized.|$|E
40|$|Bacillus thuringiensis is a ubiquitous, gram-positive and spore-forming bacterium. During sporulation, it {{produces}} intracellular crystal (<b>cry)</b> proteins, which <b>are</b> toxic to insects. The genetic diversity of B. thuringiensis strains shows regional differences. Thus, each habitat may contain novel strains with new insecticide. The {{aim of this}} study was to isolate B. thuringiensis strains from different environments of Mizoram, India, and to identify the cry gene content of the isolates using PCR. The universal primers specific to cry 1, cry 2, cry 3, cry 4 and <b>cry</b> 9 genes <b>were</b> used to detect the type of cry gene carried by each environmental isolate. Altogether, a total of 42 <b>cry</b> genes <b>were</b> detected out of which 12 <b>were</b> <b>cry</b> 1, 5 <b>were</b> <b>cry</b> 2, 3 <b>were</b> <b>cry</b> 3, 18 <b>were</b> <b>cry</b> 4 and 22 <b>were</b> <b>cry</b> 9 out of 45 selected strains.

500|$|The British {{initially}} {{announced that}} around 6,000 civilians {{had been killed}} during the air-raid and a Soviet war correspondent attached to the 21st Army Group, Lieutenant-Colonel Kraminov, put the figure as high as 22,000, a claim that was used by French communists in post-war anti-British propaganda. It was later found that 300–400 civilians {{were killed in the}} raid. Caen citizens were relieved and provided their liberators with a welcome that the troops found very moving; French accounts of the time claim that [...] "All [...] Caen was in the streets to greet them". Although Ellis called the French welcome [...] "pathetic", no Allied unit recorded any complaints about the reception they were given. Stacey wrote that the populace were [...] "particularly delighted to find their city freed in part by men from Canada". Beevor wrote that most of the population were numb from the shock and quoted a British soldier who recalled that [...] "most ... women <b>were</b> <b>crying,</b> grief-stricken and anguished". As early as 12 June, the French Resistance had sent messengers to the British, informing them that refugees were gathering in the areas around the Abbaye-aux-Hommes and the Hôpital du Bon Sauveur and requested that these locations not to be bombed; British assurances were given and these locations were nearly untouched. Gray wrote that after the war, the city population regarded itself as being martyred, which could be seen on the war memorial.|$|E
500|$|Beginning {{early in}} 1968, the group largely retired from touring, instead {{focusing}} on {{work in the}} studio. As the band was not available to promote their material, subsequent releases met with little success. The Kinks' next single, [...] "Wonderboy", released {{in the spring of}} 1968, stalled at number 36 and became the band's first single not to make the UK Top Twenty since their early covers. In the face of the band's declining popularity, Davies continued to pursue his personal song-writing style while rebelling against the heavy demands placed on him to keep producing commercial hits, and the group continued to devote time to the studio, centring on a slowly developing project of Ray's called Village Green. In an attempt to revive the group's commercial standing, the Kinks' management booked them on a month-long package tour for April, drawing the group away from the studio. The venues were largely cabarets and clubs; headlining was Peter Frampton's group The Herd. [...] "In general, the teenyboppers were not there to see the boring old Kinks, who occasionally had to endure chants of 'We Want The Herd!' during their brief appearances", commented Andy Miller. The tour proved taxing and stressful—Pete Quaife recalled, [...] "It was a chore, very dull, boring and straightforward... We only did twenty minutes, but it used to drive me absolutely frantic, standing on stage and playing three notes over and over again." [...] At the end of June, the Kinks released the single [...] "Days", which provided a minor, but only momentary, comeback for the group. [...] "I remember playing it when I was at Fortis Green the first time I had a tape of it", Ray said. [...] "I played it to Brian, who used to be our roadie, and his wife and two daughters. They <b>were</b> <b>crying</b> at the end of it. Really wonderful—like going to Waterloo and seeing the sunset.... It's like saying goodbye to somebody, then afterwards feeling the fear that you actually are alone." [...] "Days" [...] reached number 12 in the United Kingdom and was a Top 20 hit in several other countries, but it did not chart in the United States.|$|E

2500|$|Because of {{the reforms}} King Amanullah Khan instituted, the country's {{religious}} sects grew violent. In 1929, the King abdicated {{in order to prevent}} a civil war and went into exile.

2500|$|Dawn Boldrin, an English teacher, had testified {{and said}} she counseled King {{and told him he}} should not wear attention-getting {{clothing}} if {{he did not want to}} receive negative attention. [...] She also gave the teen, who was exploring his sexual and/or gender identity, a strapless, green, chiffon gown. [...] She meant for him to wear it outside school. [...] A photo was shown of Larry King holding up the dress and many people in the courtroom <b>were</b> <b>crying.</b> [...] Greg King, Larry's father became upset and gathered his family to leave, but before doing so, Dawn King, Larry's mother, swore at Boldrin's 13-year-old daughter and a relative. [...] The judge later barred Dawn King from the remainder of the trial. [...] Because the school administrators were allowing King to wear whatever he wanted as long as it did not violate the dress code, the defense was arguing that this allowed King to sexually harass McInerney.|$|E
2500|$|Unknown to Timmermann, the Germans {{had about}} 300 {{soldiers}} and civilians within the 325 meter long railroad tunnel. [...] In addition, they had four freight train cars loaded with ammunition and aircraft fuel. After a few attempts to escape, the Germans {{realized they were}} trapped. The soldiers had been ordered to destroy the bridge, but they had failed. The civilians, {{along with many other}} soldiers, hid in the tunnel because of the American shelling and bombing. The remaining officers had orders to defend and resist to the last man. Women and children <b>were</b> <b>crying</b> and the soldiers became resigned to their fate. Any movement near the tunnel openings were met with enemy fire. Soon enemy tanks would come across the bridge and fire into the tunnel. [...] When that would happen they would all be incinerated. German leadership failed and two German youths, who had been enlisted as helpers for the anti-aircraft cannons, came forward.|$|E
2500|$|Other songs express emotions, such as [...] "Come On Write Me", which expresses vulnerability, {{something}} Van Peebles {{later said}} was absent from modern recordings by African American males. Van Peebles wrote [...] "Eyes On The Rabbit" [...] as a joke, {{inspired by the}} piano player's wife, who he described as [...] "sappy". Van Peebles said, [...] "I'm going to write the sappiest song I can." [...] Van Peebles rehearsed the song at the piano player's house, where the saxophonist and his wife, and the pianist and his wife stayed inside and watched Van Peebles playing the song outside. Van Peebles {{walked over to the}} window and saw that none of them laughed at the song. He initially thought they didn't want to laugh at him, but realized that all of them <b>were</b> <b>crying,</b> and the song had a different emotional impact than he had intended. One of the watchers congratulated Van Peebles on the song, but Van Peebles explained that the song was a joke, angering him and his girlfriend, who wanted to beat Van Peebles up. Van Peebles backed off by claiming that the song wasn't a joke.|$|E

[...] When he stopped at the church, he was told that the bride had fainted and that the priest {{did not know what to}} do. [...] When they saw the young soldier, they asked him if he was ready to proceed. [...] Burmin, the young rake, noticed the attractiveness of the bride and decided to play a prank by going through with the ceremony. [...] The church was dark, lit only by a few candles, and everyone in it was little more than a shadow. [...] When, at the end, he was told to kiss his bride, she realized that it was not her intended and fainted dead away. [...] As the witnesses stared at him in horror, he raced out and drove off.|$|E
2500|$|Puyi {{had to give}} {{a speech}} before a group of Japanese infantrymen who had volunteered to be [...] "human bullets", {{promising}} to strap explosives on their bodies and to stage suicide attacks in order to die for the Showa Emperor. Puyi commented as he read out his speech praising the glories of dying for the Emperor: [...] "Only then did I see the ashen grey of their faces and the tears flowing down their cheeks and hear their sobbing." [...] Puyi commented that he felt at that moment utterly [...] "terrified" [...] at the death cult fanaticism of Bushido ("the way of the warrior") which reduced the value of human life down to nothing, as to die for the Emperor {{was the only thing that}} mattered; he observed that the Japanese infantrymen all had families and friends who cared for them, and had quite possibly been bullied by their officers into becoming [...] "human bullets". Yoshioka tried to reassure Puyi by saying that the [...] "human bullets" [...] <b>were</b> <b>crying</b> [...] "manly Japanese tears" [...] as deep down they wanted to die for the Emperor, but Puyi later stated he was not convinced by this argument.|$|E
2500|$|After the Meccans' withdrawal, Muhammad {{then led}} his forces against the Banu Qurayza neighborhood. According to Ibn Ishaq, {{he had been}} asked to do so by the angel Gabriel. The Banu Qurayza retreated into their stronghold and endured the siege for 25 days. As their morale waned, Ka'b ibn Asad {{suggested}} three alternative ways out of their predicament: embrace Islam; kill their own children and women, then rush out for a charge to either win or die; or make a surprise attack on the Sabbath. The Banu Qurayza accepted none of these alternatives. Instead they asked to confer with Abu Lubaba, one of their allies from the Aws. According to Ibn Ishaq, Abu Lubaba felt pity for the women and children of the tribe who <b>were</b> <b>crying</b> and when asked whether the Qurayza should surrender to Muhammad, advised them to do so. However he also [...] "made a sign with his hand toward his throat, indicating that [...] {{at the hands of the}} Prophet would be slaughter". The next morning, the Banu Qurayza surrendered and the Muslims seized their stronghold and their stores. The men - Ibn Ishaq numbers between 400 and 900 - were bound and placed under the custody of one Muhammad ibn Maslamah, who had killed Ka'b ibn al-Ashraf, while the women and children - numbering about 1,000 - were placed under Abdullah ibn Sallam, a former rabbi who had converted to Islam.|$|E
