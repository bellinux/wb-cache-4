40|$|Background: If {{children}} and pregnant {{women in the}} population are iodine sufficient, it is generally assumed infants are also sufficient. But <b>weaning</b> <b>infants</b> {{may be at risk}} of iodine deficiency because iodized salt contributes little dietary iodine during this period. To fill this gap, iodine fortification of infant formula milk (IFM) and complementary foods (CF) is likely important. Objectives: The objective {{of the study was to}} first confirm that Swiss school {{children and}} pregnant women remain iodine sufficient and then to assess iodine status in infancy and the relative contribution of breast milk and IFM/CF to their iodine intakes. Methods: We measured urinary iodine concentrations (UIC) in national cross-sectional samples of: 1) pregnant women (n = 648); 2) school children (n = 916); 3) infants at three time points: at 3 – 4 d after birth and at 6 and 12 months (n = 875); and 4) breast-feeding mothers (n = 507). We measured breast milk iodine concentrations in the mothers, assessed iodine sources in infant diets, and analyzed iodine content of commercial IFM/CFs (n = 22) and salt samples from the school children’s households (n = 266). Results: Median (m) UICs in pregnant women (162 µg/liter) and school children (120 µg/liter) were sufficient, and 80 % of the household salt was adequately iodized (15 ppm). However, mUICs in infants not receiving IFM/CF were not sufficient: 1) mUIC in breast-fed infants (82 µg/liter) was lower than in non-breast-fed infants (105 µg/liter) (P < 0. 001) and 2) mUIC in breast-fed <b>weaning</b> <b>infants</b> not receiving IFM/CF (70 µg/liter) was lower than infants receiving IFM (109 µg/liter) (P < 0. 01). mUIC was low in lactating mothers (67 µg/liter) and median breast milk iodine concentration was 49 µg/kg. Conclusions: In countries in which iodized salt programs supply sufficient iodine to older children and pregnant women, <b>weaning</b> <b>infants,</b> particularly those not receiving iodine-containing IFM, may be at risk of inadequate iodine intake...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Delivery of low-cost, high-protein {{foods from}} local {{materials}} for <b>weaning</b> <b>infants</b> {{is a challenge}} for developing countries. The quality of nutritional protein of cereal/legume mixtures must be developed with an optimal nutrient profile. The current {{study was conducted to}} biologically evaluate (in rats) the protein found in two homemade foods and a commercial weaning food. Methods: Biological evaluation of the formulations was conducted in 21 -day-old weanling Wistar rats, compared with a control diet of casein. The nutrient quality of the weaning foods were monitored by measuring protein efficiency ratio (PER), net protein ratio (NPR), relative net protein ratio (RNPR), true digestibility (TD), apparent digestibility (AD), and food efficiency ratio (FER). Results: The TD value of one kind of pasta (Sww 1 + SBG) was significantly less than casein (P 0. 05), but its PER was significantly less than Humana (P< 0. 05). Conclusions: Our findings showed that the second kind of homemade food (Sww 2 + SBG), consisting of a ratio of 50 percent soy bean protein-granulate and 50 percent pasta based on wheat flour protein, has high protein quality and is similar to commercial weaning food.

40|$|Malawi {{is one of}} {{the poorest}} {{countries}} in Sub-Saharan Africa, with a per capita income of about US$ 170 (World Bank 1990). Although Malawi has an enviable record in achieving national food self-sufficiency, it has achieved that at a very low level of the supply-demand balance; the aggregate picture masks widespread food insecurity at the household level. National statistics indicate that over half of the children under five years of age suffer from malnutrition and almost one in five dies before reaching the age of five. The causes of this grim situation are low incomes, chronic and seasonal food shortages, inadequate diet (especially for <b>weaning</b> <b>infants</b> and children between one and two years of age), and high morbidity rates. To date, policy reforms have included restructuring the Agricultural Development and Marketing Corporation (ADMARC), which is the government marketing agency, and agricultural pricing policies.

40|$|Peanuts (Arachis hypogaea) is an {{important}} and affordable source of protein in most of Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and a popular commodity and raw material for peanut butter, paste and cooking oil. It is a popular ingredient for foods used {{at the point of}} <b>weaning</b> <b>infants</b> from mother’s milk. It is at this critical point that childhood undernutrition occurs and the condition manifests as stunting, wasting and growth restriction and accounts for nearly half of all deaths in children under five years of age in SSA. Undernutrition is multi-factorial but weaning foods contaminated with microbiological agents (bacteria and fungi) and natural toxins have been shown to play a big part. While peanuts may provide good nutrition, they are also highly prone to contamination with mycotoxigenic fungi. The high nutritive value of peanuts makes them a perfect substrate for fungal growth and potential aflatoxin contamination. Aflatoxins are highly carcinogenic and mutagenic mycotoxins. This article reviews the nutritional value and aflatoxin contamination of peanuts, the role they play in the development of childhood malnutrition (including the different theories of aetiology) and immunological problems in children.

40|$|Background: The low {{vegetable}} intake {{in children}} {{may be attributed to}} their low preference for vegetables. During the first year of life, first taste preferences are formed, which may track over time. In a previous study to increase infants' vegetable intake and liking, we found that at the start of <b>weaning,</b> <b>infants</b> had a higher vegetable intake in the lab after repeated exposure to vegetable purées than to fruit purées. The current study is a follow-up of these infants at the age of 12 and 23 ¿months, and examined whether the group that started weaning with vegetables continued eating more vegetables than the group that started weaning with fruits. Methods: At 12 (n¿=¿ 86) and 23 (n¿=¿ 81) months of age the children's daily vegetable consumption was reported by their parents using a 3 -day food diary. The intake of green beans and apple purée was measured in the laboratory. Results: Reported daily intake of vegetables at 12 ¿months of age was 38 % higher (P¿=¿ 0. 02) in the vegetable group (75 ¿±¿ 43 ¿g) than in the fruit group (54 ¿±¿ 29 ¿g), but was similar for both groups at 23 ¿months of age (49 ¿±¿ 43, 57 ¿±¿ 35 ¿g, respectively; NS). Both at 12 and 23 ¿months of age, apple and green beans intake in the lab did not differ significantly between the groups.

Objectives: To compare the prevalence and clinical manifestations of acute diarrhea caused by EPEC to that caused by other enteric pathogens. Methods: During a 2 -year period, 200 infants under 2 years of age with acute diarrhea lasting less than 6 days were compared to 40 healthy infants (controls) matched for age. The nutritional status and the occurrence of food intolerance were examined. The patients were followed for 4 weeks after discharge from hospital. Stool samples were obtained for detection of bacterial, viral, and protozoan enteric agents. Results: EPEC was isolated from 84 (42. 0 %) children with diarrhea and from 9 (22. 5 %) healthy children (P < 0. 05). Food intolerance was a major complication and the most important factor associated with persistent diarrhea found in children with EPEC diarrhea. In children with EPEC diarrhea, compared to children with diarrhea caused by other pathogens, failure to respond to oral rehydration therapy occurred three times more frequently (P < 0. 01), and the mean duration of the disease was 11. 7 days and 7. 1 days, respectively, in the two groups (P < 0. 05).

The Method developed by Nathelson et al. was employed in the experiments and measurements were carried out in human colostrum, human breast Milk, milk from cows and evaporated milk available at the market. The results of the experiments are as follows: 1. Human Colostrum and Human Breast Milk: In human colostrum, observations were carried out every day and, in human breast milk, observations were carried out in three stages; former half, latter half and over one year of nursing period. Citric acid content was very low in the first day after parturition, and gradually increased thereafter, reaching the highest peak in the fourth day. After the fifth day, it tended to diminish gradually. It manifested further lowering as the nursing period progressed, showing very great lowering in over one year of nursing period.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Although premastication of {{food for}} <b>weaning</b> <b>infants</b> might have {{nutritional}} benefit, {{it is also associated}} with transmission of pathogens. We investigated premastication practices in Cape Town, South Africa, in lower socioeconomic status caregivers of infants below 2 years of age. METHODS: A previously reported questionnaire was adapted for South African conditions. A convenience sample of infant caregivers was captured at public maternal/pediatric and HIV outpatient clinics and home visits. RESULTS: We interviewed 154 caregivers, 92 % of whom were the biological mothers (median age: 29). Of these, 70 % were black, and 29 % were colored. There were 106 (69 %) caregivers who practiced premastication. The median age of infants who received premasticated food was 6 (interquartile range: 4 - 6) months. Forty-six (43 %) infants were teething, and 44 (42 %) had oral mucosal lesions while receiving premasticated food. Fifty-five (52 %) caregivers reported an oral condition, mostly bleeding gums, mouth sores, and thrush, and 41 (39 %) caregivers reported blood in the food. Premasticating caregivers had a significantly lower educational level than those caregivers who did not engage in this practice. Premastication practices were cultural (40 %), habit (20 %), and on mother's advice (75 %). Reasons for premastication were to pretaste (68 %), encourage eating (61 %), estimate food temperature (85 %), and homogenize food (60 %). CONCLUSIONS: Counselors and caregivers {{should be aware of the}} adverse effects of premastication. Education should include advice to avoid premastication and to seek health advice for oral conditions in the caregiver and child.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In-home iron {{fortification}} {{for infants}} {{in developing countries}} is recommended for control of anaemia, but low absorption typically results in > 80 % of the iron passing into the colon. Iron is essential for growth and virulence of many pathogenic enterobacteria. We determined the effect {{of high and low}} dose in-home iron fortification on the infant gut microbiome and intestinal inflammation. METHODS: We performed two double-blind randomised controlled trials in 6 -month-old Kenyan infants (n= 115) consuming home-fortified maize porridge daily for 4 months. In the first, infants received a micronutrient powder (MNP) containing 2. 5 mg iron as NaFeEDTA or the MNP without iron. In the second, they received a different MNP containing 12. 5 mg iron as ferrous fumarate or the MNP without the iron. The primary outcome was gut microbiome composition analysed by 16 S pyrosequencing and targeted real-time PCR (qPCR). Secondary outcomes included faecal calprotectin (marker of intestinal inflammation) and incidence of diarrhoea. We analysed the trials separately and combined. RESULTS: At baseline, 63 % of the total microbial 16 S rRNA could be assigned to Bifidobacteriaceae but there were high prevalences of pathogens, including Salmonella Clostridium difficile, Clostridium perfringens, and pathogenic Escherichia coli. Using pyrosequencing, +FeMNPs increased enterobacteria, particularly Escherichia/Shigella (p= 0. 048), the enterobacteria/bifidobacteria ratio (p= 0. 020), and Clostridium (p= 0. 030). Most of these effects were confirmed using qPCR; for example, +FeMNPs increased pathogenic E. coli strains (p= 0. 029). +FeMNPs also increased faecal calprotectin (p= 0. 002). During the trial, 27. 3 % of infants in + 12. 5 mgFeMNP required treatment for diarrhoea versus 8. 3 % in - 12. 5 mgFeMNP (p= 0. 092). There were no study-related serious adverse events in either group.

40|$|The {{promotion}} of proper infant feeding practices and {{the improvement of}} environmental sanitation have been two important strategies {{in the effort to}} reduce diarrhoeal morbidity among infants. Breast-feeding protects infants by decreasing their exposure to water- and foodborne pathogens and by improving their resistance to infection; good sanitation isolates faecal material from the human environment, reducing exposures to enteric pathogens. Taken together, breast-feeding and good sanitation form a set of sequential barriers that protect infants from diarrhoeal pathogens. As a result, breast-feeding may be most important if the sanitation barrier is not in place. This issue is explored using data from a prospective study of 2355 urban Filipino infants during the first 6 months of life. Longitudinal multivariate analyses are used to estimate the effects of full breast-feeding and mixed feeding on diarrhoeal disease at different levels of sanitation. Breast-feeding provides significant protection against diarrhoeal disease for infants in all environments. Administration of even small portions of contaminated water supplements to fully breast-fed infants nearly doubles their risk of diarrhoea. Mixed-fed and <b>weaned</b> <b>infants</b> consume much greater quantities of supplemental liquids, and as a result, the protective effect of full breast-feeding is greatest when drinking-water is contaminated. Similarly, full breast-feeding has stronger protective effects among infants living in crowded, highly contaminated settings...|$|R
40|$|In 2002, the Swedish National Food Administration and the University of Stockholm {{reported}} that certain foods which are processed at high temperatures may contain {{high levels of}} acrylamide. Acrylamide is synthesized via the Maillard reaction from the amino acid asparagine and a reducing sugar. It has been proven from animal experiments that acrylamide is a toxic compound {{and it is a}} probable carcinogen and a mutagen for humans. Acrylamide has been found in starchy foods such as French fries, bread crust, and baked cereal foods. Some of these foods are commonly consumed by <b>weaning</b> <b>infants</b> and children. For the first time, this thesis estimated the acrylamide exposure of Saudi infants by determining the acrylamide content in foods commonly consumed by Saudi infants using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and estimating exposure using deterministic approach. Additionally, the thesis estimated the exposure to acrylamide of the UK infants, children and whole population by using published acrylamide composition and dietary information from the National Diet and Nutrition Surveys of 1992 - 3 (SN 3481) and 2011 - 12 (SN 6533) using deterministic and probabilistic approaches. Acrylamide levels were analysed in 16 foods commonly consumed by Saudi infants using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), however, the resolution of the acrylamide peak was not sufficient to allow quantification. LC-MS was consequently used. The food samples were extracted with water after adding 2 µg/mL of internal standard C 13 acrylamide. The extract was cleaned-up with solid phase extraction (SPE) cartridges. The LC-MC was set in positive mode at m/z 72 and 75 for acrylamide and acrylamide C 13 respectively. Acrylamide levels in most foods were found to be lower than the limit of detection (LOD) (17. 2 µg/kg). Saudi infants had a median exposure of 0. 22 µg/kg-bw/day. The exposure in British infants, children and whole population were ranged between 0. 43 to 1. 07 µg/kg-bw/day. Most groups –except Saudi infants- have an upper percentile that exceeds the tolerable daily intake (TDI) cancer value (2. 6 µg/kg-bw/day).

In contrast to the relatively stabilized gut fungal community, gut bacterial community showed a marked drop in alpha diversity, accompanied by significant alterations in taxonomic compositions. The relative abundances of 24 bacterial genera significantly declined, whereas the relative abundances of 7 bacterial genera (Fibrobacter, Collinsella, Roseburia, Prevotella, Dorea, Howardella, and Blautia) significantly increased with the age of weaned piglets. Fungal taxonomic analysis showed that the relative abundances of 2 genera (Kazachstania and Aureobasidium) significantly decreased, whereas the relative abundances of 4 genera (Aspergillus, Cladosporium, Simplicillium, and Candida) significantly increased as the piglets aged. Kazachstania telluris was the signature species predominated in gut fungal communities of weaned miniature piglets.

A genetic ngerprinting by means of Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis generated a more complex banding pattern in the culture system than in infant feces. The three vessels representing the colon showed similar DGGE patterns, indicating a high stability of the dominant microbial species. Yet, high variability {{in terms of the}} dominant bacteria was observed in infant stools. The fermentative capacity of the in ×itro system, characterized by the concentration of volatile fatty acids and ammonium, was in accordance with the in ×i×o data. The enhanced production of propionate in ×itro is probably due to the high concentration of fermentable sugars in the culture medium and hence, a high fermentation rate. The elevated concentration of propionate, as well as valerate and caproate in ×itro suggests conditions favoring Megasphaera sp. fermentation. The data concerning microbial diversity and activity warrants further exploration of the in ×itro model as a tool for studying the impact of newly developed infant formulas, functional foods and pharmaceuticals on the gastrointestinal microbiota of infants.

40|$|Renal citrate {{metabolism}} and urinary citrate excretion in the infant rat. BackgroundAlthough hypercalciuria {{has the same}} prevalence in children as adults, children rarely develop renal stones. This {{may be explained by}} a greater urinary citrate excretion in infants compared with adults. The present study examines the renal excretion of citrate and renal cortical citrate metabolism in infant and adult rats. MethodsAdult male and newly <b>weaned</b> <b>infant</b> rats were acclimated to metabolic cages and fed synthetic diets. Urine was collected after two days, and renal cortical citrate metabolism was assayed. ResultsInfant rats had a lower plasma [HCO 3 -] and higher plasma [K+] and had a fourfold higher urinary citrate:creatinine ratio and a twofold higher concentration of citrate in their urine compared with adult rats. This higher urinary citrate excretion was not due to a difference in renal proximal tubular Na/citrate cotransporter activity, nor renal cortical citrate synthase or ATP citrate lyase activities in infants as compared with adults. However, infant rat kidneys had significantly lower mitochondrial aconitase (m-aconitase) activity. Renal cortical citrate concentrations were comparable in infant and adult rats. Manipulation of plasma [K+] to adult levels did not affect the higher urinary citrate excretion in infant rats. ConclusionsUrinary citrate excretion in infant rats is greater than in adults but does not parallel tissue [citrate]. Thus, this higher urinary citrate is likely due to maturational differences in the proximal tubule, other than Na/citrate cotransport, that directly affect citrate transport...|$|R
40|$|Massage, {{together}} with breast-feeding, {{are the two}} fundamental nurturing practices of women in south Asia. In Mithila women are expected to massage their infants daily. If they do not, they lay themselves open to censure. Implicit in massage {{is the idea that}} a child's health is preserved by fostering its strenght and invulnerability. Massage 'works' by installing fearlessness, hardening bone structure, enhancing movement and limb coordination, and increasing weight. These practices, in turn, are premised on the idea that between birth and <b>weaning</b> the <b>infant</b> is highly impressionable such that its identity can be shaped by the women who nurture it. south Asia child health child development massage...|$|R
40|$|Background: Breastfeeding and {{complementary}} feeding {{are crucial}} {{for growth and}} development of an infant. Non-exclusive breastfeeding among 0 - 5 month old infants can {{increase the risk of}} dying due to diarrhea and pneumonia. In developing countries, the age of starting of complementary feeding is of public health importance. Higher prevalence of malnutrition among older children (6 - 12 months) may be related to prolong exclusive breast-feeding. Objective: To determine the duration of exclusive breast feeding using survival analysis (Life table) and Hazard function. Material and Methods: This was a cross sectional study conducted in Government Medical College, Latur (Maharashtra, India) during 1 st May 2013 to 30 th June 2013. The study population consisted of 197 mother-infant pairs attending the Immunization Clinic. Data was collected by direct interview using predesigned and pretested questionnaire. Informed consent was taken from all the study subjects. The data was analyzed using survival analysis procedure with life table approach and Hazard function graph with Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) 20. Results: Out of the 197 infants 101 (51. 27 %) were males and 96 (48. 73 %) were females. The mean age of mothers was 24. 17 ± 3. 60 years. Majority of the parents had at least secondary school education. Exclusive breast feeding rate at 6 months was 100 %. Delayed weaning practices were seen in 53. 63 % of total <b>weaned</b> <b>infants.</b> Steep fall seen at 7 months in Hazard function graph also indicates delayed weaning practices. Conclusions: Delayed weaning practices are a major concern in the study area which needs attention...|$|R
40|$|The WHO (2001) {{recommends}} exclusive breast-feeding and {{delaying the}} introduction of solid foods to an infant’s diet until 6 months postpartum. However, in many countries, this recommendation is followed by few mothers, and earlier weaning onto solids is a commonly reported global practice. Therefore, this prospective, observational study aimed to assess compliance with the WHO recommendation and examine weaning practices, including the timing of <b>weaning</b> of <b>infants,</b> and to investigate the factors that predict weaning at # 12 weeks. From an initial sample of 539 pregnant women recruited from the Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital, Dublin, 401 eligible mothers were followed up at 6 weeks and 6 months postpartum. Quantitative data were obtained on mothers’ weaning practices using semi-structured questionnaires and a short dietary history of the infant’s usual diet at 6 months. Only one mother (0 · 2 %) complied with the WHO recommendation to exclusively breastfeed up to 6 months. Ninety-one (22 · 6 %) <b>infants</b> were prematurely <b>weaned</b> onto solids at # 12 weeks with predictive factors after adjustment, including mothers’ antenatal reporting that <b>infants</b> should be <b>weaned</b> onto solids at # 12 weeks, formula feeding at 12 weeks and mothers’ reporting of the maternal grandmother as the principal source of advice on infant feeding. Mothers who <b>weaned</b> their <b>infants</b> at # 12 weeks {{were more likely to}} engage in other sub-optimal weaning practices, including the addition of non-recommended condiments to their infants’ foods. Provision of professional advice and exploring antenatal maternal misperceptions are potential areas for targeted interventions to improve compliance with the recommended weaning practices...|$|R
30|$|Above, we have {{documented}} {{not only the}} great effort our interview subjects devoted to breastfeeding their babies but also the range of meanings they attributed to those efforts. Breastfeeding could be deeply meaningful—understood as not just food, but an expression of commitment and feeling to one’s baby, a role worth struggling for and often relinquished with guilt and regret. Numerous women spoke of guilt over failing to breastfeed their babies or over <b>weaning</b> their <b>infants,</b> and some described experiences with postpartum depression that were clearly linked to breastfeeding difficulties. Women often reflected on these experiences {{through the prism of}} cultural ideas about mothering and about the significance of caring—and feeding—one’s baby to the best of one’s ability.|$|R
