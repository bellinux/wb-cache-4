25|$|Cutolo {{was born}} in Ottaviano, a {{municipality}} in the hinterland of Naples, in a family without ties in the Camorra. His fatherless youth was spent in a close-knit Catholic environment. His father was an agricultural labourer <b>who</b> <b>for</b> <b>years</b> tilled a field as a sharecropper {{as a means to}} support his family. While still a child, the landowner told Cutolo's father that the following year the field would be used for a different purpose and that his services were no longer required.

25|$|The Third Reform Act of 1885 widened {{the number}} of males {{eligible}} to vote to 60% of the population. Males paying an annual rental of £10, or holding land valued at £10 or over, were now eligible to vote. The other factor was the reorganization of constituency boundaries, and a candidate <b>who</b> <b>for</b> <b>years</b> had been returned unopposed suddenly found part of his electorate was from an area outside of his influence. Thus the national power of the landed aristocrats and gentry was slowly diminished. The ruling class was slowly ceasing to rule. In 1888 the creation of local elected authorities {{in the form of}} county councils eroded their immediate local power too. The final blow, the reform of the House of Lords in 1911, proved to be {{the beginning of the end}} for the country house lifestyle which had been enjoyed in a similar way for generations of the upper classes.|$|E
