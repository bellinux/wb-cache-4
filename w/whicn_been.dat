40|$|The evolvement of a beach {{depends on}} many conditions. Erosion and {{deposition}} {{are the most}} common phenomena during beach evolvement proceeding, <b>whicn</b> can always <b>be</b> found in the same beach. Sediment transport drived by waves or currents changes with season or tide period time. The coastal infrastructures have great influences on sediment transport by changing the nature conditions, so it is the most common approach adopted to deal with beach problems. In China, sand beach getting muddy by depositing silt is another beach problem in addition to erosion. With the population of coastal city growing, it is attracting more attention from researchers. This paper demonstrates an approach of coastal shallows and development in a semi-closed bay. The waves, tidal currents and floods are discussed and the sediment conditions are analyzed. After that, a mud digging and sand beach rebuilding plan is recommended. In the adduced bay, waves are small and varying with wind forces and directions, tidal currents are weak in the most part of the coastal shallows, floods generally happen during July to September accompanying with sediment input the bay every year.

40|$|Waking and {{roosting}} of Acridolheres tristis at communal roosts {{were studied}} during two years m Auckland. Mynas sleep communally in trees all the year, the only exceptions being incubating and brooding females. Birds use some roosts during late {{spring and summer}} only and some roosts throughout the year. The temporary roosts are formed just before reproduction and, when they are formed, numbers of birds visiting year-round roosts drop sharply; they are gradually deserted during the summer long {{before the end of}} breeding. At year-round roosts the times of assembly and of departure show 2 ̆ 7 trends relative to civil twilight and are latest and earliest respectively when breeding is at a peak. The intensities of light at which birds arrive and depart are the lowest at this time* These trends are probably because reproductive hormones affect the birds 1 sensitivity to physical cues or cause an increased attraction to the territory and nest. Throughout the breeding season changes in the status of arriving birds singles, pairs and groups) correlate with the changing numbers of breeding pairs* Light is probably the only physical factor that could provide consistent cues to times of waking and roostiuR Other factors, such as temperature and humidity, may have an effect, especially on the periods of assembly and departure. An endogenous dock, set by light and possibly a social Zettgeber, allows early departures, especially important to breeding individuals; it prevents {{a waste of time and}} energy during the day that might come from premature roosting. The time available to breeding birds for feeding and for collecting food for nestlings is increased by leaving early from, and arriving late at, roosts. An early defence of the territory may also advance the time of departure. Vocalizations at roosts do not advertise them but are more proximate socially, as when these calls are given during the dav. Gatherings before roosting provide protection from predation, <b>whicn</b> may <b>be</b> greater in evening, but do not always prevent foraging. Communal sleeping protects Mynas more from predators than if they slept solitarily. Other advantages, such as maintaining the unity ot juvenile flocks and an increased efficiency in finding food, come from sleeping communally, but at any one tune most birds in Auckland do not exploit these additional benefits...|$|R

The survey of fontane's picture of society includes the aristocracy of town ana country, the middle classes (with special reference to Jewish and professional circles;, and a number of representative figures from the working folk. Tontane's political views will be analysed in order to determine his fundamental attitude to society and state, and to clarify the political references in his novels. The special social problem of marriage, in <b>whicn</b> the author <b>was</b> particularly interested, will be invest igated in the light of Tontane's views stated botn in the published works and in his private correspondence. following an estimation of Tontane's personal values and philosophy of life, he will be brought into brief comparison with other authors and literary movements, and finally some distinctive features of his style and technique will be commented upon. No attempt has been made at completeness in the illustrations of chapters II, III, and IV; a number of representative examples have been selected from the novels which could, of course, be supplemented by many others. Similarly Chapter VIII has been limited in its scope. In a study of this type it has been found necessary to restrict this section to a series of brief indications.

40|$|This {{item was}} {{digitized}} by the Internet Archive. Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston UniversityThe problem of regeneration {{has to do}} with the phenomenon of growth resulting in a restoration of an old form of a mutilated organism. The process, the stimuli and factors causing it, and the effect of agents upon regeneration in the lower metazoa were discussed. The sponger, the simpxest multicellular animals, can after dissociation reconstitute the whole organism again. The arcnaeocytes were found to have tne most important role in regeneration, differentiating into gonocytes, scieroblasts, colienocytes and desmacytes, thus giving rise to the mesenchyme ana skeleton of the new sponge. The pinacocytes formed the dermal membrane and lining of the canals, while the choanocytes gave rise to the flagellated chamoers. Aggregates were formed by the amoeboid activity of the arcnaeocytes within eighteen to twenty-four hours after dissociation. On the third day after dissociation the flagellated chambers appeared, and on the fourth and fifth aays, canals appeared. Development after dissociation was then completed. Dissociated cells from different species (Microciona and Clicna) coalesce and form aggregates only with cells of their own species. The dissociated cells will not coalesce and form aggregates in pure sodium or potassium chloride solutions. The cells were also found to be sensitive to increases in osmotic pressure. Hydra, turned inside out, will regain their normal organization of the rearrangement of endoaermal ana ectodermal cells migrating in opposite directions through the mesoglea. Ectodermal or endodermal layers of hydra cultured alone do not regenerate due to the inability of one cell type to differentiate into the cell type of the other layer. Dissociated cells of hydra will fuse and form aggregates only when the three body layers are present. The pieces of a hydra must measure more than one-sixth of a millimeter in diameter to regenerate. Size also determines the number of tentacles, and the size of the hypostome formed on the regenerant. Various sections of hydra and grafts also form regenerated individuals, although in some cases the results are abnormal. The determination and organization of new polarities depended upon the rate of metabolism incorporated in the regenerating mass. In Tubularia, removal of the perisarc stimulates regeneration, as the cut end is then cathed with more oxygen. The more coenosarc exposed to oxygen the greater is the activation to form hydranth tissue. When there is an increase in the oxygen consumption there is also an increase in the rate of regeneration. The hydranth forms in relation to the oxygen supply with the oral end of the regenerant at the point of highest oxygen tension. The rate of regeneration can be measured at any level under various conditions wnen the formula R=πr^ 2 n/t is used. Exposure of the coenosarc to sea water obliterates the already existing gradients in the stem and thus the regenerating coenosarc fragments form new polarities. The theory of dominance seems to be best explained by the transportation of substances theory, in <b>whicn</b> there <b>are</b> differences in the stem, "E", present in highest concentration at the distal end and lowest at the proximal end. There is also another factor in the stem "S", which may or may not inhibit regeneration depending on the rate of regeneration when "E" is forming new hydranths. Eudendrium and Pennaria cells fuse after dissociation in much the same manner as sponges and hydra. Light is essential for the regeneration of hydranths in Pennaria, but not for Eudendrium. Direct x-radiation inhibited regeneration of Pennaria, but screened colonies connected to those colonies radiated, did regenerate new hydranths. Podocoryne and Hydractinia are also capable of regenerating polyps. Gonionemus shows incomplete regeneration. Mnemiopsis leidyi, a ctenophore, regenerated plate rows, canal connections, and apical organs, depending on the manner in which they were cut. There was found to be no physiological gradient in Mnemiopsis. Polychoerus is the simplest flatworm to stimulate to regenerative activity as these worms have no central nervous system to influence regeneration. Many types of regeneration have been produced from stimulation of planarians to regenerate. The smallest and most irregular pieces have the capability of forming new individuals. The extensive powers of regeneration of this group are due to the localization and differentiation of the formative cells, which are found in the mesoderm. The polyclads will regenerate complete individuals from pieces taken from any part of the oody. The triclads will restore missing anterior parts onxy when the cephalic ganglia are present. Anesthetics and strychnine inhioit regeneration in the flatworms as doeo exposure to x-radiation. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|The {{thesis is}} about a village {{which has become a}} part of the {{industrial}} city of Bangalore, the ways in which this change in circumstances is taken into account in social relations and moral judgments and tbe relation between Hindu religion and morality. From this local study I draw tentative conclusions about social relations and movements of ideas in Indian industrial society. In chapter 1 (Introduction) I describe the conditions of my fifteen months' fieldwork. I criticize the view that economic and technical changes cause moral or social changes directly and predictably, that the effect of industrialization and urbanization must be to alter 'folk' or 'traditional' society in the direction of a single ideal type of 'urban' or 'industrial' society and that this must involve great social strain and breakdown of norms. Social change means changes in moral values and ideologies. Changes in economic and other circumstances do not determine ideologies, but are taken into account as reasons for altering social categories and making new kinds of value judgments. It is at this level of ideologies and values, rather than of 'ideal types' constructed out of external similarities, that it is useful to make comparisons between societies. Indian ideologies are expressed particularly in religious terms and the key to understanding social change in India lies in the changing relations between religion and morality. Chapter 2 (History and description) traces the village's history from its foundation around 1800 to its incorporation into Bangalore (pop. 1. 2 m) in the 1950 s, and describes the present appearance of the village and housing conditions within it. The leading peasant families sold their land for building or built on it themselves, and became building contractors or wholesale merchants. Their sons were educated in English, and tended to become factory workers or clerks. Half the village's population of 6700 belong to families of recent immigrants. More than half the village's workers are in positions requiring some skill or responsibility. Bangalore consists largely of a network of such urban villages which are not submerged but become more conscious of their identity as the neighbourhood gains moral significance at the expense of communities of birth. Chapter 3 (Groups within the village) describes the vestiges of traditional relations between castes and the surviving village offices. These things, like village cults and festivals, acquire a new value as the reality of rural life recedes and the village's recent past is idealized in the myth of a co-operating community, associated with peasant virtues. Immigrants as well as old families are attached to the village, as a unit in which relations are moral rather than economic, and particularly as an arena in which claims to respect or status can be defended. The villagers are divided into old families and immigrants, by language (half speak Tamil the rest mainly Teluga or Kannada), by religion (four fifths are Hindus, the rest Giristians apart from a few Muslims), by caste by 'family', which varies in meaning according to the situation, by economic class, by economic relations of creditor and debtor, or of employer and employee in the case of the minority who work for other villagers by education by age, by sex by occupation, by party and faction, by voluntary associations.,by close neighbourhood and by friendship. Wherever possible I give statistics, based on a sample survey of every tenth household. In chapter 4 (Caste and family) I discuss caste ideology, the religious justification of hierarchy, the place of endogamy and occupation, and the relation between castes and 'subcastes'. I describe the main castes of the village, most of which belong to the 'middle' block of castes and are social equals, the situations in which caste counts, and the way in which endogamous groups divide, unite, overlap and change their names. The closed endogamous group tends to be replaced by overlapping marriage circles, which the household may redefine for itself within limits. Ideal relations within the family may be inferred from simple rules about who is entitled to respect, but the content of this respect, and the criteria for giving it, are changing in the direction of equality and autonomy. Chapters 5 and 6 (Religion) describe cults of the whole village, cults of other groups and personal religion. I distinguish three aspects of Hinduism: brahmanism, associated with prestige and auspiciousness, and with the values of dharma (order), permanence, hierarchy, purity and ritual, the religion of groups, for the protection and welfare of closed communities, and the religion of choice, associated with moksha or liberation, renunciation, devotion, the direct relation of the soul to God, and, particularly in the modern form of this kind of religion with conscience, responsibility and service. Brahmanism and group religion are complementary. The thinking that characterizes then is thoroughly hierarchical: men are arranged in a hierarchy of birth and function, the legitimate ends of life in a hierarchy of value. Each item in the hierarchy is justified Dy its association with those above it. Just as castes derive status from their relation to Brahmans, the interest (artha) of groups is justified by and subordinate to the eternal order (dharma) of the whole, and group religion is justified by and subordinate to brahmanism. The religion of choice tends to make universal not hierarchical distinctions, and to regard worshippers as equals. Each of these aspects is particularly associated with one of the three main temples in the village: the ore brahmanical temple, the temple of the village's patron goddess, and a Math or religious institution built over the grave of a Guru. The Math is a centre not only of devotional religion, but of social and moral innovation: its younger devotees organized a night school for village children, and have been prominent in other enterprises associated with the ideology of 'social service'. They transformed universalistic ethical beliefs which were latent and unstressed into the common assumptions of a generation influenced by the reforming enthusiasm, moral fervour and equalitarianism of the Independence movement. In chapter 7 (Respect) I consider the use and meaning of 'respect' and words connected with it ('big man' andc). Respect is a fundamental social value and the form in which economic and other relations on larger scales are projected on to the village's scale of values. It has two main components 'prestige', a given, de facto quality related to birth, wealth and influence, and 'honour', a moral, de jure quality depending on the autonomous moral judgments of others. In modern conditions the second component tends to gain importance at the expense of the first, and the conversion of wealth or power into status conies to depend now on complying with universalistic norms. Forms of organization for common action are compromises between two types: the traditional pancaayat or council, where decisions are taken by consensus and 'big men' respected for their 'prestige' take the initiative, and the modern association, where decisions are voted on and men respected for their personal moral qualities take the initiative. I describe a municipal election, and the two ways in which candidates build up support by acting through dyadic links of 'respect' and by a direct appeal to voters or supporters through ideological arguments. Chapter 8 (Values) I relate values and social relations in the village to the two types which Piaget calls heteronomy aud autonomy. Heteronomy is associated with constraint, hierarchy and unilateral respect, autonomy with aspiration, equality and mutual respect. They correspond to Bergson's closed and open types of morality, religion and society. In principle the two types are opposed, in practice they are found together, in unstable combinations, in every social morality. I examine the forms they take in western and Indian society, and the connexion between religion and ethics in traditional Indian society. The dominant traditional morality, associated with brahmanism and group religion, is a thoroughgoing relativism, in which there is no duty beyond the obligations of particular roles. Heteronomy is the dominant but not the only strain in traditional Hindu values, which can best be understood as a constant dialogue between heteronomous relativism and autonomous universalism, with a constant tendency to escape from rigidly prescribed hierarchical relations into religious or moral universalism. Traditional India tries to combine heteronomy and autonomy in two ways. A popular ethical tradition, for which there is evidence both in literature and in existing Hindu societies, sees conscience and public opinion as complementary aspects of every right action, and avoids or denies the possibility of conflict between them. The religious tradition places the individual between the two poles of the autonomous renouncer and the heteronomous man-in-the-world (Dumont's term), with forms of religion appropriate to each. The devotee is religiously autonomous but socially heteronomous, getting the chief part of his religion from the renouncer and his ethics from the caste society. Past attempts to combine religious and moral universalism did not last long, but they had a permanent effect on Hindu society. Modern devotional religion tends to absorb the secular universalist ethical tradition and to take the central place in religious experience which brahmanical and group religion once shared. This modern devotional religion resembles Christianity in being ethical and casteless and in its stress on consistency and conscience, it differs in its ideals of moksha or liberation and of renunciation as an end. In a review of preceding chapters, and of moral judgments and speculation in the village, I show the extent to which autonomous values, which were already present in the margin of traditional society, tend to gain importance at the expense of heteronomous ones. In chapter 9 (Conclusion) I show how moral innovation and ideological change influenced indirectly by changing circumstances and directly by a confrontation with national or foreign ideologies, takes place particularly on the scale of communities like the village. Modern Indian institutions and ideas are not copies or imports from the west, and the moral reactions to western contact should be distinguished from a superficial 'westernization' for reasons of prestige. Modern India tends to make universal not hierarchical distinctions, to apply universalistic principles to religious and social and intellectual life, and to disentangle autonomy from heteronomy instead of trying to combine them as the traditioual society did. A specifically Indian industrial society is built on traditional foundations, particularly on elements of autonomy and equality <b>whicn</b> <b>are</b> present but unstressed in traditional society. </p...|$|R
