He had also stated in the e-mail that Speaker of Parliament Maxime Carlot Korman would be [...] "buried" [...] if he attempted {{to stand in the}} 2012 general election. Carlot Korman addressed Regenvanu in these terms: [...] "I, along with your father are veteran politicians. I want you to explain to me what you mean <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> are going to bury me." [...] Regenvanu was compelled by the Speaker to offer an apology.|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} is a transcript provided by [...] from a [...] in which John Mueller of Google speaks about the Title tag {{and its relation to}} SEO:DANIEL PICKEN: I had a quick question. And John, it was about something you said a few weeks ago, actually. You said the title tag is a ranking signal, but you said that you use a part of the title tag. And that's really stuck with me. And I was just wondering what you meant by that, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> use a part of the title tag as a ranking signal.JOHN MUELLER: We use that just as a part. I think it's not like the primary ranking factor of a page, to put it that way.DANIEL PICKEN: Right.JOHN MUELLER: We do use it for ranking, but it's not the most critical part of a page. So it's not worthwhile filling it with keywords to kind of hope that it works that way. In general, we try to recognize when a title tag is stuffed with keywords because that's also a bad user experience for users in the search results. If they're looking to understand what these pages are about and they just see a jumble of keywords, then that doesn't really help.Moz has already been cited as assigning critical importance to the Title tags. However, they have the following to say about the Meta description:... it's important to note that meta descriptions do not directly influence Google's ranking algorithms for normal web search. Help says pretty much the same things, as does Matt Cutts, in one of this [...]|$|E

"It seems," [...] said Estella, very calmly, [...] "that {{there are}} sentiments, fancies,--I don't {{know how to}} call them,--which I am not able to comprehend. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> love me, I know what you mean, {{as a form of}} words; but nothing more.

6000|$|... "My God--won't {{you trust}} me?" [...] he begged, with a {{tremendous}} effort to collect himself. [...] "You trusted me yesterday. What's happened to change you? Won't you tell me? It's nothing I've done--I swear. And {{what do you mean}} <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> were in that mob? I was almost crazy when I came back and found they'd been here in this mill--can't you understand? It wasn't that I didn't think of you. I'd been worrying about you all day. Look at this thing sensibly. I love you, I can't get along without you--I'll marry you. I said I would, I meant it I'll marry you just as soon as I can clean up this mess of a strike. It won't take long." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She used to {{talk with}} me about you; and <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> care for me now, {{it makes me feel}} like the vilest hypocrite in the world. That day you gave her the list of books, and she came down to Nantasket, and went on about you, I helped her to flatter herself--oh! I don't see how she can forgive me. But she knows I can never forgive myself! That's the reason she can do it. I can see now," [...] she went on, [...] "how I must have been trying to get you from her. I can't endure it! The only way is for me never to see you or speak to you again!" [...] She laughed forlornly. [...] "That would be pretty hard on you, if you cared." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do not let us {{forget that}} this is a solemn matter," [...] he said ere long; [...] "one of which we may neither think nor talk lightly without sin. I trust, Jane, you are in earnest <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> will serve your heart to God: it is all I want. Once wrench your heart from man, and fix it on your Maker, the {{advancement}} of that Maker's spiritual kingdom on earth will be your chief delight and endeavour; you will be ready to do at once whatever furthers that end. You will see what impetus would be given to your efforts and mine by our physical and mental union in marriage: the only union that gives a character of permanent conformity to the destinies and designs of human beings; and, passing over all minor caprices--all trivial difficulties and delicacies of feeling--all scruple about the degree, kind, strength or tenderness of mere personal inclination--you will hasten to enter into that union at once." ...|$|E

"Of course," [...] said I, [...] "when <b>you</b> <b>say</b> Chinaman, <b>you</b> {{think of}} a {{creature}} with a pigtail, long nails, and insanitary habits, and <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> negro <b>you</b> {{think of a}} filthy-headed, black creature in an old hat. You do this because your imagination is too feeble to disentangle the inherent qualities of a thing from its habitual associations." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Cannot leave Monte Carlo?" [...] she {{repeated}} derisively. [...] "Why, my dear man, {{you are a}} {{fish out of water}} here! You don't gamble, you do nothing but moon about and go to the Opera and worry about your silly politics. What on earth do <b>you</b> mean <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> that <b>you</b> cannot leave Monte Carlo?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Precisely," [...] {{said the}} other; [...] "and there ends your {{absorption}} of the talents. That is what I complain of your cosmopolitanism. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> want all peoples to unite, you really {{mean that you}} want all peoples to unite to learn the tricks of your people. If the Bedouin Arab {{does not know how}} to read, some English missionary or schoolmaster must be sent to teach him to read, but no one ever says, 'This schoolmaster does not know how to ride on a camel; let us pay a Bedouin to teach him.' You say your civilisation will include all talents. Will it? Do you really mean to say that at the moment when the Esquimaux has learnt to vote for a County Council, you will have learnt to spear a walrus? I recur to the example I gave. In Nicaragua we had a way of catching wild horses--by lassooing the fore feet--which {{was supposed to be the}} best in South America. If you are going to include all the talents, go and do it. If not, permit me to say what I have always said, that something went from the world when Nicaragua was civilised." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If we were married, you'd {{think you}} had rights over me," [...] she explained, slowly. [...] "Now you haven't any, I can go away. I couldn't live with you. I know what {{happened}} to me, I've thought it all out, I wanted {{to get away from the}} life I was leading--I hated it so, I was crazy to have a chance, to see the world, to get nearer some of the beautiful things I knew were there, but couldn't reach.... And you came along. I did love you, I would have done anything for you--it was only when I saw that you didn't really love me that I began to hate you, that I wanted to get away from you, when I saw that you only wanted me until you should get tired of me. That's your nature, you can't help it. And it would have been the same if we were married, only worse, I couldn't have stood it any more than I can now--I'd have left you. You say you'll marry me now, but that's because you're sorry for me--since I've said I'm not going to trouble you any more. You'll be glad I've gone. You may--want me now, but that isn't love. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> love me, I can't believe you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh yes," [...] said Mrs. Farnaby, carelessly. [...] "She {{is devoted}} to me, of course--she is the living {{consolation}} I told you of just now. That was Mr. Farnaby's notion in adopting her. Mr. Farnaby thought to himself, 'Here's a ready-made daughter for my wife--that's all this tiresome woman wants to comfort her: now we shall do.' Do you know what I call that? I call it reasoning like an idiot. A man may be very clever at his business--and may be a contemptible fool in other respects. Another woman's child a consolation to me! Pah! {{it makes me sick}} to think of it. I have one merit, Amelius, I don't cant. It's my duty {{to take care of my}} sister's child; and I do my duty willingly. Regina's a good sort of creature--I don't dispute it. But she's like all those tall darkish women: there's no backbone in her, no dash; a kind, feeble, goody-goody, sugarish disposition; and a deal of quiet obstinacy at the bottom of it, I can tell you. Oh yes, I do her justice; I don't deny that she's devoted to me, as you say. But I am making a clean breast of it now. And you ought to know, and you shall know, that Mr. Farnaby's living consolation is no more a consolation to me than the things you have seen in the drawers. There! now we've done with Regina. No: there's one thing more to be cleared up. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> admire her, what do you mean? Do you mean to marry her?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{you have}} {{mentioned}} {{many things to}} me not long ago. Does your feminine tyranny require that <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> the thing <b>you</b> mean {{is one of several}} things, I should know it immediately by that mark?" ...|$|R
5000|$|We've {{heard that}} for 35 years. We did not {{intentionally}} do anything related to {{drugs in the}} story. People thought we were on drugs. You can't do good television while on drugs. People never believe <b>you</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> that, but <b>you</b> can't. The shows were very bright and spacey looking. They may have lent themselves to that culture at the time, but we didn't ascribe that meaning to them, and I can't speak to what adults were doing when they were watching the shows. We just {{set out to make}} a quality children's program. Marty Krofft ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What ought you to do? You {{know what}} you ought to do. Would you marry a man for whom you have no more regard than you have for this stick, simply because he is {{persistent}} in asking you? No more than you have for this stick, Mary. What sort of a feeling must it be, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> that <b>you</b> would willingly see him married to any other girl to-morrow? Can that be love?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In England you {{encourage}} an orator by exclaiming, 'H'yaah! h'yaah!' We {{pronounce it}} heer in some sections, 'h'yer' in others, and so on; but our whites {{do not say}} 'h'yaah,' pronouncing the a's like the a in ah. I have heard English ladies say 'don't you'--making two separate and distinct words of it; your Mr. Burnand has satirized it. But we always say 'dontchu.' This is much better. Your ladies say, 'Oh, it's oful nice!' Ours say, 'Oh, it's awful nice!' We say, 'Four hundred,' you say 'For'--as in the word or. Your clergymen speak of 'the Lawd,' ours of 'the Lord'; yours speak of 'the gawds of the heathen,' ours of 'the gods of the heathen.' When you are exhausted, {{you say you are}} 'knocked up.' We don't. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> will do a thing 'directly,' you mean 'immediately'; in the American language--generally speaking--the word signifies 'after a little.' When you say 'clever,' you mean 'capable'; with us the word used to mean 'accommodating,' but I don't know what it means now. Your word 'stout' means 'fleshy'; our word 'stout' usually means 'strong.' Your words 'gentleman' and 'lady' have a very restricted meaning; with us they include the barmaid, butcher, burglar, harlot, and horse-thief. You say, 'I haven't got any stockings on,' 'I haven't got any memory,' 'I haven't got any money in my purse; we usually say, 'I haven't any stockings on,' 'I haven't any memory!' 'I haven't any money in my purse.' You say 'out of window'; we always put in a the. If one asks 'How old is that man?' the Briton answers, 'He will be about forty'; in the American language we should say, 'He is about forty.' However, I won't tire you, sir; but if I wanted to, I could pile up differences here until I not only convinced you that English and American are separate languages, but that when I speak my native tongue in its utmost purity an Englishman can't understand me at all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 30. To-day I {{have been}} visiting, which I had long neglected; and I dined with Mrs. Barton alone; and sauntered at the Coffee-house till past eight, {{and have been}} busy till eleven, and now I'll answer your letter, saucebox. Well, let me see now again. My wax candle's almost out, but however I'll begin. Well then, do not be so tedious, Mr. Presto; {{what can you say}} to MD's letter? Make haste, have done with your preambles--Why, I say I am glad you are so often abroad; your mother thinks it is want of {{exercise}} hurts you, and so do I. (She called here to-night, but I was not within, that's by the bye.) Sure you do not deceive me, Stella, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> are in better health than you were these three weeks; for Dr. Raymond told me yesterday, that Smyth of the Blind Quay had been telling Mr. Leigh that he left you extremely ill; and in short, spoke so, that he almost put poor Leigh into tears, and would have made me run distracted; though your letter is dated the 11th instant, and I saw Smyth in the city above a fortnight ago, as I passed by in a coach. Pray, pray, don't write, Stella, until you are mighty, mighty, mighty, mighty well in your eyes, and are sure it won't do you the least hurt. Or come, I'll tell you what; you, Mistress Stella, shall write your share at five or six sittings, one sitting a day; and then comes Dingley all together, and then Stella a little crumb towards the end, to let us see she remembers Presto; and then conclude with something handsome and genteel, as your most humblecumdumble, or, etc. O Lord! does Patrick write word of my not coming till spring? Insolent man! he know my secrets? No; as my Lord Mayor said, No; if I thought my shirt knew, etc. Faith, I will come as soon as it is any way proper for me to come; but, to say the truth, I am at present a little involved with the present Ministry in some certain things (which I tell you as a secret); and soon as ever I can clear my hands, I will stay no longer; for I hope the First-Fruit business will be soon over in all its forms. But, to say the truth, the present Ministry have a difficult task, and want me, etc. Perhaps they may be just as grateful as others: but, according to the best judgment I have, they are pursuing the true interest of the public; and therefore I am glad to contribute what is in my power. For God's sake, not a word of this to any alive.--Your Chancellor?(9) Why, madam, I can tell you he has been dead this fortnight. Faith, I could hardly forbear our little language about a nasty dead Chancellor, as you may see by the blot.(10) Ploughing? A pox plough them; they'll plough me to nothing. But have you got your money, both the ten pounds? How durst he pay you the second so soon? Pray be good huswifes. Ay, well, and Joe, why, I had a letter lately from Joe, desiring I would take some care of their poor town,(11) who, he says, will lose their liberties. To which I desired Dr. Raymond would return answer, that the town had behaved themselves so ill to me, so little regarded the advice I gave them, and disagreed so much among themselves, that I was resolved never to {{have more to do with}} them; but that whatever personal kindness I could do to Joe, should be done. Pray, when you happen to see Joe, tell him this, lest Raymond should have blundered or forgotten--Poor Mrs. Wesley!--Why these poligyes(12) for being abroad? Why should you be at home at all, until Stella is quite well?--So, here is Mistress Stella again, with her two eggs, etc. My [...] "Shower" [...] admired with you; why, the Bishop of Clogher says, he has seen something of mine of the same sort, better than the [...] "Shower." [...] I suppose he means [...] "The Morning";(13) but it is not half so good. I want your judgment of things, and not your country's. How does MD like it? and do they taste it ALL? etc. I am glad Dean Bolton(14) has paid the twenty pounds. Why should not I chide the Bishop of Clogher for writing to the Archbishop of Cashel,(15) without sending the letter first to me? It does not signify a ----; for he has no credit at Court. Stuff--they are all puppies. I will break your head in good earnest, young woman, for your nasty jest about Mrs. Barton.(16) Unlucky sluttikin, what a word is there! Faith, I was thinking yesterday, when I was with her, whether she could break them or no, and it quite spoilt my imagination. [...] "Mrs. Walls, does Stella win as she pretends?" [...] "No indeed, Doctor; she loses always, and will play so VENTERSOMELY, how can she win?" [...] See here now; an't you an impudent lying slut? Do, open Domville's letter; what does it signify, if you have a mind? Yes, faith, you write smartly with your eyes shut; all was well but the n. See how I can do it; MADAM STELLA, YOUR HUMBLE SERVANT.(17) O, but one may look whether one goes crooked or no, and so write on. I will tell you what you may do; you may write with your eyes half shut, just as when one is going to sleep: I have done so for two or three lines now; it is but just seeing enough to go straight.--Now, Madam Dingley, I think I bid you tell Mr. Walls that, in case there be occasion, I will serve his friend as far as I can; but I hope there will be none. Yet I believe you will have a new Parliament; but I care not whether you have or no a better. You are mistaken in all your conjectures about the Tatlers. I have given him one or two hints, and you have heard me talk about the Shilling.(18) Faith, these answering letters are very long ones: you have taken up almost the room of a week in journals; and I will tell you what, I saw fellows wearing crosses to-day,(19) and I wondered what was the matter; but just this minute I recollect it is little Presto's birthday; and I was resolved these three days to remember it when it came, but could not. Pray, drink my health to-day at dinner; do, you rogues. Do you like [...] "Sid Hamet's Rod"? Do you understand it all? Well, now at last I have done with your letter, and so I will lay me down to sleep, and about, fair maids; and I hope merry maids all.|$|E
