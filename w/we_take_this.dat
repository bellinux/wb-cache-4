500|$|The Lotus team, who {{had their}} cars impounded by bailiffs {{following}} Belgium two weeks earlier, managed to get their cars back {{in time for the}} Grand Prix.

Meanwhile, contract negotiations were high in the agenda prior to the weekend, with Williams announcing that the team would retain Felipe Massa and Valtteri Bottas for , while Nico Hülkenberg signed a new two-year deal with Force India. An additional talking point was the future of the Italian Grand Prix at Monza, with the event at risk to be dropped from the calendar. After the race, Ferrari driver Sebastian Vettel spoke out in favour of the venue, saying: [...] "If <b>we</b> <b>take</b> <b>this</b> race away from the calendar for any shitty money reasons, you are basically ripping our hearts out".|$|E
500|$|Following the {{suspension}} of operations at {{three out of four}} BPI plants, members of the media and leaders were invited by Iowa Governor Terry Branstad to tour the BPI facility that remained open in South Sioux City, Nebraska. The founders of BPI gave campaign contributions to Branstad in 2010, and to other candidates' campaigns. Branstad stated to ABC News that the contributions were not a factor in his decision regarding having the event. Texas Governor Rick Perry, Nebraska Lieutenant Governor Rick Sheehy, Kansas Governor Sam Brownback, and South Dakota Lieutenant Governor Matt Michels, toured the South Sioux City, Nebraska, plant in an attempt to allay [...] "inaccurate information" [...] that they stated as having caused [...] "an unnecessary panic among consumers". The publicity tour emerged with the promotional slogan, [...] "Dude, it's beef!" [...] News reporters were not allowed to ask employees at BPI any questions during the tour. BPI asserts that social media and ABC News [...] "grossly misrepresented" [...] their product. BPI eventually sued ABC News for defamation. On March 28, 2012, Branstad stated, [...] "The problem is, <b>we</b> <b>take</b> <b>this</b> off the market, then we end up with a fatter product that's going to cost more and it's going to increase the obesity problem in this country". Safeway and other retailers that have removed the product from their shelves or product lines have stated they will not raise the price of their beef. Branstad also stated that he would recommend that Iowa state public schools continue to use ground beef which contains the product, and stated plans to [...] "send a letter to the state's public schools, encouraging them to continue to buy LFTB".|$|E

2500|$|In July 2015, Eton accidentally sent emails to 400 {{prospective}} students, {{offering them}} conditional {{entrance to the}} school in September 2017. The email was intended for nine students, but an IT glitch caused the email {{to be sent to}} 400 additional families, who didn't necessarily have a place. In response, the school issued the following statement: [...] "This error was discovered within minutes and each family was immediately contacted to notify them that it should be disregarded and to apologise. <b>We</b> <b>take</b> <b>this</b> type of incident very seriously indeed and so a thorough investigation, overseen by the headmaster Tony Little and led by the tutor for admissions, is being carried out {{to find out exactly what}} went wrong and ensure it cannot happen again.

2500|$|Following the {{publication}} on 30 August of the U.S. Government Assessment of the Syrian Government’s Use of Chemical Weapons on August 21, 2013, President Obama {{gave a speech}} in the White House Rose Garden on 31 August in which {{he announced that he}} would seek authorization from Congress before using American military forces to intervene in the Syrian civil war. In the speech, he announced that he was [...] "prepared to give that order," [...] referring to ordering a strike on Syria. [...] Obama argued that it was necessary to intervene because the recent chemical weapons attack in Syria [...] "risks making a mockery of the global prohibition on the use of chemicals weapons" [...] and that it put U.S. regional allies that share a border with Syria in danger. [...] In his speech, Obama also said that, [...] "while I believe I have the authority to carry out this military action without specific congressional authorization, I know that the country will be stronger if <b>we</b> <b>take</b> <b>this</b> course, and our actions will be even more effective."
