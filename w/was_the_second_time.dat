5|$|In 1967 Solti {{was invited}} to become music {{director}} of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. It <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>time</b> he had been offered the post. The first had been in 1963 after the death of the orchestra's conductor, Fritz Reiner, who made its reputation in the previous decade. Solti told the representatives of the orchestra that his commitments at Covent Garden made it impossible to give Chicago the eight months a year they sought. He suggested giving them three and a half months a year and inviting Carlo Maria Giulini to take charge for a similar length of time. The orchestra declined to proceed on these lines. When Solti accepted the orchestra's second invitation it was agreed that Giulini should be appointed to share the conducting. Both conductors signed three-year contracts with the orchestra, effective from 1969.|$|E

5|$|The 1976 Winter Olympics {{had been}} awarded in 1970 to Denver, United States, but in November 1972 {{the voters of}} the state of Colorado voted against public funding of the games by a 3 to 2 margin. The IOC turned to offer the Games to Vancouver-Garibaldi, British Columbia, which had been a {{candidate}} for the 1976 Games. However, a change in provincial government brought in an administration which did not support the Olympic bid, so the offer was rejected. Salt Lake City, a candidate for the 1972 Games, offered itself, but the IOC opted to ask Innsbruck, which had maintained most of the infrastructure from the 1964 Games. Despite only having half the time to prepare for the Games, Innsbruck accepted the invitation to replace Denver in February 1973. Two Olympic flames were lit because it <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>time</b> the Austrian town had hosted the Games. The 1976 Games featured the first combination bobsleigh and luge track, in neighbouring Igls. The Soviet Union won its fourth consecutive ice hockey gold medal.|$|E
5|$|The Canucks {{completed}} their second {{season with the}} Chicago Wolves as American Hockey League affiliate, the final one under the two teams' contract. The Wolves started the season by winning their first four games {{for the second time}} in franchise history. The following games were not as fruitful as they lost five of their next six games and their starting goaltender Eddie Lack suffered a hip injury. The injury required surgery, and Lack missed the remainder of the season. With Lack out the Wolves finished fifteenth in the league for fewest goals allowed. The previous season they allowed the fifth fewest goals in the league. Lack and back-up Matt Climie set a franchise record for lowest team goals against average. With the league's nineteenth best offense, the Wolves were unable to overcome the goals against them and finished fourth in their division. Thus missing the playoffs. It <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>time</b> in three years that the Wolves missed the playoffs, but only the fourth time in franchise history. Despite missing the playoffs, Chicago finished second in league attendance.|$|E

Manny Ramírez won the Hank Aaron Award and, along with Albert Pujols, a Silver Slugger Award, while Gold Glove awards were won by Mike Matheny, Scott Rolen and Jim Edmonds. The American sports magazine Sports Illustrated honored the Red Sox with their Sportsman of the Year award a month later, making them the first professional team to ever win the award.

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1984–85 season, Anderson signed an eight-year contract with the Oilers. Anderson recorded 42 goals and 81 points and once more his team were the division champions. Anderson was also selected to play in the All-Star Game. For the third straight season, the Oilers reached the Finals. The Oilers defeated their opponent, the Philadelphia Flyers, in five games. Anderson set a career high in assists with 16 during the playoff run. The 1985–86 season saw Anderson score 54 goals, 48 assists, adding up to 102 points. This <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>time</b> Anderson had reached the 50 goal plateau in his career and the third time he had reached the 100 point plateau. He was also selected to play in his third consecutive All-Star Game. For the fifth consecutive season, the Oilers sat atop the Smythe Division. However, the Oilers were eliminated in the division finals by the Calgary Flames on an own goal by defenceman Steve Smith. The loss did not seem to faze Anderson and his team, as they won their third Cup the next season by beating the Flyers once again, but this time in seven games. Anderson set career highs in goals (14), points (27) and PIM (59) during the playoff run.|$|E
5|$|Ferrari ordered Massa {{to reduce}} his car speed on his out-lap to help Alonso {{minimise}} the effects of losing second position. Glock drove back to his pit box where his mechanics examined his car for damage and decided to retire him from the race. Kubica avoided making contact with Sutil when his lollipop man stopped him before he could drive away from his pit box. It <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>time</b> that season Kubica and Sutil were involved in an incident in a pit lane; Kubica had made contact with Sutil when the latter was driving into his pit box in the Hungarian Grand Prix. The safety car drove into the pit lane {{at the end of}} the thirty-fourth lap and Vettel led at the restart. Hamilton ran deep, heading into the first corner and allowing Alonso to retake second position and immediately came under attack from Massa. Kubica took eighth place from Hülkenberg by taking the inside line at the third corner. Sutil took to the inside line and passed Button for twelfth on lap thirty-six. Button was pushed wide onto the run-off area and fell to fifteenth position.|$|E
