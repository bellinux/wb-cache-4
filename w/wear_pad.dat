40|$|A {{method for}} {{measuring}} wear phenomena at the nano-scale is presented. It involves the introduction fmicron sized indentations onthe sliding surface which are 10 - 20 nm deep {{to act as}} reference for the measurement of wear. The changes in the size and depth of these indentations a a function of sliding time are monitored with an atomic force microscope. The method {{has been applied to}} measure wear on a contact recording head consisting ofa diamond-like carbon <b>wear</b> <b>pad</b> of physical dimensions of 10 by 35 Ixm, under development foruse in magnetic hard disks. Constant speed rag tests and sweep tests were conducted in the study. The wear coefficients obtained are of the order of 10 - io. These results correspond to a wear ate 0 f 4. 5 nm per week for constant speed rag testing and between 9 and 12 nm per week for sweep testing at a nominal load of 350 - 400 ttN...|$|E

5000|$|The use of pads is controversial. Some {{criticize the}} band {{that holds the}} pad on, which they believe cuts into the hoof and may wear a slot into it. However, {{trainers}} commonly loosen the band when the horse is not being exercised, which may minimize the problem. Under normal conditions, if a pad is lost, it usually only affects the pad and not the base shoe, which remains intact. Injuries are usually very limited from [...] "throwing" [...] a set of pads. It is dangerous if a horse <b>wearing</b> <b>pads</b> pulls off a shoe, as not only will the pad come off, but the band may tear off part of the hoof wall.

40|$|Wearing kneepads is {{the best}} defence against {{occupational}} knee injury. It {{has been reported that}} the use of knee pads can reduce injuries and increase performance. Knee pads provide protection by disbursing pressure on the knees and preventing puncture wounds. This study focuses on the effect of knee pads on muscle activity and gait analysis. As a case study, measurement of muscle activities whilst kicking a ball was conducted. The normalized mean of the EMG data shows that the vastus lateralis and vastus medialis muscles are highly active when <b>wearing</b> a knee <b>pad.</b> Gait analysis was conducted on six subjects with and without <b>wearing</b> knee <b>pad.</b> Results shows that <b>wearing</b> knee <b>pads</b> increases the force (950 ~ 1150 N) acting on the ground, compared with not <b>wearing</b> knee <b>pads</b> (800 ~ 900 N) ...|$|R

40|$|Restriction of {{expansion}} of the lungs or chest wall impedes inflation of the lungs during inhalation. Functional changes occurring during such restriction include reduced pulmonary and/or chest wall compliance, decreases in pulmonary function, and ultimately a decrease in exercise performance. Such restriction {{can be seen in}} several pathologic conditions such as scoliosis or obesity, as well as occupational situations such as the wearing of bullet-proof vests. This study investigated the hypothesis that tightened football shoulder pads produce decrements in pulmonary function similar to those shown in previous studies involving other external chest-wall restricting devices. In this study, 24 subjects, all members of a collegiate division IAA football team and used to <b>wearing</b> the <b>pads,</b> performed standard pulmonary function tests while <b>wearing</b> no <b>pads</b> (control, CTRL), <b>wearing</b> <b>pads</b> that were not secured (pads loose, PL) and while <b>wearing</b> <b>pads</b> secured "game-tight" (pads tight, PT). The data showed that both forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1. 0) were significantly decreased in the PT condition compared to either the CTRL or PL condition, with no changes in the FEV 1. 0 /FVC ratio or peak expiratory flow rate. These results are consistent with a restrictive condition and support our hypothesis that tightened shoulder pads reduce pulmonary function. Further studies remain to be performed to determine whether these changes lead to decreased exercise performance and whether equipment modifications can be made to limit alterations in pulmonary function without decreasing the protective value of the pads...|$|R
