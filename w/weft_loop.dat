Tests of PVC at five load ratios in the {{warp and weft}} directions, which are 0 : 1, 1 : 2, 1 : 1, 2 : 1 and 1 : 0 respectively, were carried out, and tensile performances of the samples under biaxial tensile loads were analyzed. The test {{results show that the}} PVC membrane is highly nonlinear and orthotropic under biaxial tensile loads. With the increase of loading cycles, the total residual strain is nearly unchangeable and the hysteresis curve becomes stable. Slope of warp curve is larger than weft curves, and the <b>weft</b> <b>loop</b> area is greater than the warp one with the same load ratio. The generalized poisson ratio changes due to variations of the load ratio (R). when R< 1, the experimental values and theoretical values of the generalized poisson's ratio are negative. When R≥ 1, generalized poisson's ratios tend to be constant, When the load ratio are 0 : 1 and 1 : 0, the curves become straight lines...|$|E
40|$|Fragment of fine woven undyed linen fabric. One warpwise edge is very {{straight}} with no fraying. There {{are a few}} <b>weft</b> <b>loops</b> near one corner and the weave is almost warp-faced near this edge. This {{may have been a}} selvedge.; Dirty and worn. There are one small interior hole and one large edge tear. Three edges are frayed, the fourth edge appears to have been cut...|$|R
40|$|Small {{fragment}} of yellowed woven wool fabric with paired warps and five warp ribs and {{a remnant of}} a sixth rib. It is unknown {{if this is a}} selvedge as the outside edge if frayed.

Four picks below the purple band there is a row of countered weft-twining, with a second row 0. 7 cm below. The <b>weft</b> <b>loops</b> pass over three warps.; Fairly clean, but worn. There are a few small edge tears and the raw edges are frayed...|$|R
40|$|Fragment of yellowed woven wool fabric with a {{very small}} remnant of a purple weft band (0. 5 cm wide) at one corner. There is a row of countered weft-twining with the <b>weft</b> <b>loops</b> passing over three warps each. A small piece of a {{somewhat}} finer fabric was sewn on at an angle.

5000|$|The {{portrait}} {{has been}} called [...] "cold", reflecting the sober formality of Eleanor's native Spanish Court, without the warmth typically expected of a portrait of mother and child. Such distancing {{is typical of the}} Mannerist school's rejection of naturalism. Conversely, Eleanor's gown of elaborate brocaded velvet, with its massed bouclé effects of gold <b>weft</b> <b>loops</b> in the style called riccio sopra riccio (loop over loop), is painstakingly replicated. The painting is perhaps an advertisement for the Florentine silk industry, which had fallen in popularity in the first difficult years of the sixteenth century and was revived in the reign of Cosimo I. The precious golden belt, decorated with jewels and beads with a tassel, may have been made by the goldsmith Benvenuto Cellini.|$|R
25|$|The burial chamber {{was evidently}} rich in textiles, {{represented}} by many fragments preserved, or by chemicals formed by corrosion. They included quantities of twill, possibly from cloaks, blankets or hangings, and {{the remains of}} cloaks with characteristic long-pile weaving. There appear to have been more exotic coloured hangings or spreads, including some (possibly imported) woven in stepped lozenge patterns using a Syrian technique in which the <b>weft</b> is <b>looped</b> around the warp to create a textured surface. Two other colour-patterned textiles, near the head and foot of the body area, resemble Scandinavian work of the same period.|$|R
50|$|The {{edges of}} a rug need {{additional}} protection, {{as they are}} exposed to particular mechanical stress. The last warps {{on each side of the}} rug are often thicker than the inner warps, or doubled. The edge may consist of only one warp, or of a bundle of warps, and is attached to the rugs by <b>weft</b> shoots <b>looping</b> over it, which is termed an “overcast”. The edges are often further reinforced by encircling it in wool, goat's hair, cotton, or silk in various colours and designs. Edges thus reinforced are called selvedges, or shirazeh from the Persian word.|$|R
50|$|A selvage (US English) or {{selvedge}} (British English) is a self-finished edge of fabric. The selvages {{keep the}} fabric from unraveling or fraying. The selvages {{are a result}} of how the fabric is created. In woven fabric, selvages are the edges that run parallel to the warp (the longitudinal threads that run {{the entire length of the}} fabric), and are created by the <b>weft</b> thread <b>looping</b> back at the end of each row. In knitted fabrics, selvages are the unfinished yet structurally sound edges that were neither cast on nor bound off. Historically, the term selvage applied only to loom woven fabric, though now can be applied to flat-knitted fabric.|$|R
50|$|Bobbinet tulle is {{constructed}} by {{warp and weft}} yarns in which the <b>weft</b> yarn is <b>looped</b> diagonally around the vertical warp yarn to form a hexagonal mesh which is regular and clearly defined. Bobbinet netting has a characteristic diagonal fabric appearance, is diagonally stable and slideproof, durable, sheer, the lightest bobbinet weighing no more than 6 g per m2 and has a high strength to weight ratio.|$|R
40|$|This {{fragment}} {{consists of}} at pieces {{of two different}} woven wool fabric ssewed together. One fabric is somewhat finer than the other. They are sewed on at different angles to each other so the above measurements do not reflect warp and weft directions. The finer fabric has yellow warp and weft and remnants of a blue/black band {{at one end and}} several damaged bands at the opposite end. Along with the blue/black yarns, there is a very small amount of red/purple yarns several linen slit tapestry elements There are also three areas of weft twining on this fragment. All are double rows of countered <b>weft</b> twining with <b>loops</b> passing over two warps each. The coarser fabric has one area of weft twining which is also doubled countered <b>weft</b> twining with <b>loops</b> passing over two warps. This coarse piece has a tapestry band which varies from 0. 7 cm to 0. 9 cm wide with a 2. 2 cm wide oval near the center. There are several slit tapestry elements {{around the edge of the}} oval.; All fragments are somewhat dirty but very worn. There are large holes and edge tears. There are many areas of damaged wefts that leave exposed warps...|$|R
40|$|Two {{pieces of}} wool fabric sewn {{together}} in several places. One is more faded than the other. In some areas, {{the edge of}} the fragment has been turned under. The two pieces may be originally from the same fabric. Both have remnants of red countered <b>weft</b> twining with <b>loops</b> passing over 2 or three warps. Because the twining yarns are so fragmented, the structure is obscured.; Several holes and tears. Uneven fading. Much of the red weft twining is missing. Occasional weft picks missing or very loose, also. The wool still retains some luster...|$|R
40|$|Fragment of yellowed woven wool fabric with paired warps and {{regularly}} spaced countered weft-twining. The twining yarns {{are used in}} pairs and are somewhat thicker {{than the rest of}} the <b>weft.</b> The twining <b>loops</b> pass over three warp pairs. The twining rows are approximately 0. 6 cm to 0. 7 cm apart.; Very dirty and worn. Much of the thicker weft-twining yarns have worn away. The twining yarns are not visible at all on one side of the fragment, only rows of bare warps indicate that twining is on the other side. Weft edges are frayed...|$|R
40|$|Fragment of woven wool fabric {{with brown}} warp and a 2. 5 cm wide brown weft band. The {{balance of the}} weft is green/blue. There is a very {{deteriorated}} brown weft-twining row 0. 3 cm {{from the edge of}} the green/blue <b>weft.</b> The twining <b>loops</b> pass over three warps each. There are interior warp ribs near the center of the fragment, with two ribs, containing 6 warps each, on either side of two single warps. The brown weft edge has been folded and sewed.; Very dirty with a small amount of encrusted mud. Very worn. Two large edge tears almost cut the piece in two. There are several interior holes. Edge edges are frayed...|$|R
40|$|Fragment of yellowed woven wool fabric with a 3 cm wide purple weft band. There {{are three}} weft twining rows. One is 0. 3 cm below the purple band. There {{other two are}} 0. 2 cm and 1. 7 cm above the purple band. The twining loops appear to pass over two warps each. The row closest to the purple band {{appears to be a}} single row of twining; the other two are double rows.; Dirty and very worn. There are a few very small {{interior}} holes and larger edge tears. Minor damage to the purple wefts leaves a few exposed warps. There are more damaged wefts in the yellow areas. The twining rows are missing some <b>loops.</b> <b>Weft</b> edges are frayed...|$|R
40|$|Fragment of woven wool fabric {{with brown}} warp, four picks of brown weft next to 3 rows of red weft-twining, and 6. 3 cm of blue/purple <b>weft.</b> The twining <b>loops</b> pass over two warps each. Within the blue/purple weft {{there are two}} {{discontinuous}} bands of brown weft 1 cm apart with linen slit tapestry triangles along each edge. Linen weft-wrapping was used for patterning, much of which has deteriorated. There is a row of linen triangles along each edge of the blue/purple band {{as well as a}} row (2 picks) of linen 0. 2 cm from the triangle rows. There are a few stitches along the border edge.; Dirty, with some encrusted mud. Somewhat worn, with a few small interior holes and edge tears. A few damaged wefts leave exposed warps. Edges are frayed...|$|R

There are several small interior holes in each fragment. Both have large edge tears. Both are somewhat puckered and show damaged from abrasion. Edges are frayed...|$|R
40|$|Terry fabrics {{are very}} popular {{materials}} {{which may be}} used for home textile, of baby clothes {{and as a result of}} the large scale of production of medicine and hygiene products. The structure of the terry fabric is characterized by its complex weave which is obtained through interlacing two systems of warp and one system of <b>weft.</b> The <b>loop</b> pile is one of the most important elements of the terry woven fabric structure because the appearance of the product and many other properties depend on the loops formed on the surface of terry fabrics. Water absorption is important for terry fabrics as well. Consequently, in this study, water vapour absorption and water evaporation from terry fabrics are investigated. Other extremely important physical properties of terry woven fabrics are their permeability properties. Absorption and desorption properties of woven fabrics depend on their air permeability. Mechanical properties of terry fabrics are among the most important characteristics determining the service capability of the product; the strength properties of the products are influenced by the fabric strength and durability. Terry fabric finishing methods are being developed seeking not only to improve the fabric’s appearance or to provide it with additional functional properties but also in order to increase the demand for terry woven fabrics. The assessment of terry fabric wear was determined investigating the changes in mechanical properties after abrasion impact. The analysis also includes the predicting of the quality of terry fabrics: the dependencies of indices are expressed by mathematical equations and evaluated as complex; the determination of the influence of water, heat, mechanical, and chemical impacts/finishing on the properties of the fabrics is performed...|$|R
40|$|In {{our recent}} study, a bifacial fabric with a knitted {{structure}} {{on one side}} and a woven structure on the other side of the fabric was designed and manufactured for apparel applications. The physical properties of the bifacial fabrics were previously reported. In this study, bifacial fabrics with two different weft densities of 18 and 22 picks per cm in the woven structure and loop lengths of 10 and 11 mm in the knitted structure were prepared, then the air permeability of the fabrics was analyzed. The extension of the analysis of variance techniques was applied to the data. It was found that there were highly significant differences in the air permeability of bifacial fabrics with different <b>weft</b> densities and <b>loop</b> lengths, while the interaction between these two factors was not statistically significant in their effects on the air permeability. Briefly, increasing loop length increased air permeability, while air permeability decreased with an increase in weft density. This finding shows that fabric’s parameters can be manipulated to affect air permeability of the bifacial fabrics, and further to influence comfort properties of such novel fabrics...|$|R
40|$|Fragment A - The largest {{fragment}} of {{three pieces of}} wool fabric sewn together. The fabric is in two colors. 6. 5 cm of fabric is woven in a brown/gold weft while 7. 5 cm is woven in greenish weft. There are two rows of countered weft twining in the brown section. Each <b>weft</b> twining <b>loop</b> goes over 3 or 4 warp threads and under 2 or 3. The rows are approximately 1 cm apart, 0. 2 cm from the green section. The greenish color {{may be the result}} of optical mixing or staining because under closer inspection the green yarns are actually blue/grey.; Fragment B - Small {{fragment of}} wool fabric attached to 10305 a by three lines of stitching. The warp is yellowed and the weft is blue/purple with a narrow weft band of the same yellow as the warp. The band is 0. 3 cm wide and is almost in the center of the widest part of the fragment. Two edges have been turned under where this piece is sewn to the main fabric. Another row of stitching attaches the folded edge of the main fabric to this fragment. Fragment C - This fragment has a folded hem which has been sewn to 10305 a by two rows of different color stitches. Part of it has been bent, folded and sewn under itself to form, in one place, three layers. The bent section, at this point, is perpedicular to the rest of the fragment. The fold may have been sewn down adjacent to the hem of 10305 a. Several large stitches of a single yarn hold the two fabrics together and extend into the folded part of 10305 c.; Fragment A - Somewhat stained with several tears and interior holes. All edges are frayed.; Fragment B - Worn and partly faded.; Fragment C - Very worn. The weaving has become loosened n places, especially near the edges...|$|R
