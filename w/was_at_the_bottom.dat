For four years, {{he served as a}} backup to Chuck Long, now a member of the College Football Hall of Fame. During his junior year, as the backup quarterback, he also served as the holder for field goal kicks. After placekicker Rob Houghtlin won a 12-10 game against the University of Michigan thanks to a last second field goal, a mob tore down the goalpost, which injured four fans including Vlasic, who <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of a pile of fans.|$|E

However, the album was certified gold in Britain in early December, with Talbot being presented a gold disc by Phillip Schofield on daytime television programme This Morning.|$|E

25|$|The {{effects on}} living {{conditions}} {{the industrial revolution}} have been very controversial, and were hotly debated by economic and social historians from the 1950s to the 1980s. A series of 1950s essays by Henry Phelps Brown and Sheila V. Hopkins later set the academic consensus {{that the bulk of}} the population, that <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of the social ladder, suffered severe reductions in their living standards. During 1813–1913, there was a significant increase in worker wages.|$|E

By 1988–89 it had dethroned long-time leader General Hospital as the top-rated soap, a position it has held ever since. During {{the week of}} December 2, 2013, the series celebrated their twenty-fifth year as the number one daytime drama.

25|$|Unlike Cubans and Spaniards, the Italians {{arrived in}} the cigar town without cigar-making skills. When the early Italians entered the factories, it <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of the ladder, {{positions}} which did not involve handling tobacco. Working beside unskilled Cubans, mainly Afro-Cubans, they swept and hauled and were porters and doorkeepers. In time, many did become cigar workers, including Italian women. The majority of the Italian women worked as cigar strippers in 1900, an undesirable position mainly held by women who could find nothing else. However, eventually many of them became skilled cigar makers, earning more than the male Italian cigar makers. Other Italian immigrants started small businesses built around the cigar industry, such as cafés, food stores, restaurants, and boardinghouses.|$|E
25|$|After {{these events}} Psylocke's powers changed once again; she now possessed both telepathic and telekinetic abilities, {{but with her}} psionic {{potential}} divided between them, neither ability is {{as strong as it}} once was. The following days saw Betsy travel back in time alongside Beast's X-Club. Psylocke also led the X-Club in a mission to raise Asteroid M, which <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of the Pacific Ocean, to serve as the X-Men's new base of operations and a haven for mutantkind, called Utopia. Soon after, Psylocke went to Japan with Wolverine to re-inter her former body. Upon arriving, she was ambushed by the Hand, who destroyed her original body at the behest of Matsu'o Tsurayaba. Enraged, Psylocke tracked Matsu'o down, finding him terribly disfigured as the result of Wolverine's yearly revenge on Matsu'o {{for his role in the}} murder of Mariko Yashida. Matsu'o, now missing both hands and other body parts, desired an honorable death and wanted Psylocke to grant him that honor since he could not hold a blade to perform seppuku himself. This put Psylocke at odds with Wolverine, who felt that Matsu'o's punishment was not over yet. Psylocke engaged Wolverine in a brutal fight which ended in a truce. With Wolverine's permission, Psylocke finished Matsu'o off mercifully, using her telepathy to project illusions into his mind of his body restored and of Kwannon embracing him. Psylocke quickly killed him with her psi-blade.|$|E

500|$|The apothecaries' pound in Venice had {{exactly the}} same subdivisions {{as those in the}} non-Romance countries, but its total weight of 301g <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of the range. During the Habsburg reign of 1814–1859 an {{exception}} was made for Venice; as a result the extreme weights of 301g and 420g coexisted within one state and in immediate proximity. The Venice standard was also used elsewhere, for example in Udine. In Dubrovnik (called [...] "Ragusa" [...] until 1909) its use was partially continued {{for a long time in}} spite of the official Habsburg weight reform.|$|E
500|$|About 525 {{million years}} ago, when {{northern}} Arizona <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of a shallow sea, {{a thin layer}} of sediment called the Tapeats Sandstone was deposited over the Cleopatra tuff. Limestones and other sediments accumulated above the sandstone until about 70 million years ago when the Laramide Orogeny created new mountains and new faults in the region. One of these faults, the Verde Fault, runs directly under Jerome along the Jerome anticline. Crustal stretching beginning about 15 million years ago created Basin and Range topography in central and southern Arizona, caused volcanic activity near Jerome, and induced movement along the Verde Fault. This movement exposed the tip of the United Verde ore body at one place on Cleopatra Hill and moved the UVX ore body to [...] below the surface. Basalt, laid down between 15 and 10 million years ago, covers the surface beneath the UVX headframes and Jerome State Historic Park. The basalt, the top layer of the Hickey Formation, caps layers of sedimentary rock.|$|E

The Bitterroot River and multiple smaller tributaries join the Clark Fork on the western edge of Missoula. The city also sits at the convergence of five mountain ranges: the Bitterroot Mountains, Sapphire Range, Garnet Range, Rattlesnake Mountains, and the Reservation Divide, thus is often described as being the [...] "hub of five valleys".|$|E

500|$|In {{the final}} {{practice}} session on Saturday [...] {{which was held}} in dry conditions [...] Kovalainen was fastest, ahead of Massa and teammate Hamilton. Alonso continued his strong practice form, finishing fourth, with Toro Rosso's Sebastian Vettel making it to fifth position. Kubica once again <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of the table, this time due to a transmission problem. The qualifying session on Saturday afternoon was split into threeparts. The first part ran for 20minutes, and cars that finished the session 16th or lower were eliminated from qualifying. The second part of qualifying lasted 15minutes and eliminated cars that finished in positions11 to 15. The final part of qualifying determined the positions from first to tenth, and decided pole position. Cars which {{failed to make the}} final session could refuel before the race, so ran lighter in those sessions. Cars which competed in the final session of qualifying were not allowed to refuel before the race, and as such carried more fuel than in the previous sessions.|$|E
