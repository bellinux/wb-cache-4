In his address, he declared [...] "As to the Executive Mansion, for years its floors have been propped up to prevent them from falling, and it required more than seven hundred feet of <b>weather</b> <b>strips</b> to make it comfortable in the winter. The present site is disagreeable, the view from one side overlooks the walls of the penitentiary, and from the other the smokestack of a large flouring mill nearby."

On February 10, 1899, the mansion caught fire as a result of a faulty flue in the governor's bedroom. The day was so cold that the fireman had difficulty keeping the water in their hoses unfrozen, and the mansion suffered extensive damage. Though the mansion was insured and a reporter for the Courier-Journal opined that the sensible thing to do would be to demolish the old structure and construct a new one or purchase another house in Frankfort to serve as the governor's mansion, the legislature was disinclined to make more than minimal accommodations for a Republican governor. Consequently, the mansion was once again repaired. The Bradleys stayed with a neighbor in Frankfort immediately after the fire. Thereafter, Governor Bradley stayed in Frankfort's Capitol Hotel, while Mrs. Bradley and daughter Christine returned to the family's home in Lancaster. The family re-occupied the residence prior to the end of Bradley's term.|$|E

40|$|Automating {{the process}} of {{automotive}} <b>weather</b> <b>strip</b> assembly has been a challenge to production engineers for years. In fact, a recent publication concluded that this process is too difficult to automate. At the IPA a robot tool for flexible automation of the <b>weather</b> <b>strip</b> assembly process has been developed. In close cooperation with Opel AG, <b>weather</b> <b>strip</b> supplier Mesnel S. A. in France, assembly system manufacturers Kuka, and Thyssen Nothelfer, a prototype assembly cell {{has been set up}} at IPA. The assembly system consists of a pick-up station supplying the <b>weather</b> <b>strip</b> seals, a sophisticated insertion tool, and an industrial robot (Fanuc S- 420 F). The basic function of the robot tool is very similar to the manual operation. The tool combines gripping, guiding and hammering functions. It uses open guides with pneumatic fingers to pickup and guide the seal, and a pneumatic hammer to drive the seal onto the flange. Based on a thorough analysis of significant process parameters, the cycle time of the seal assembly could be halved compared with manual operation. Extensive tests have proven a process reliability of close to 99 %. Integration of a four robot <b>weather</b> <b>strip</b> assembly system into the final assembly line at Opel's plant in Rüsselsheim is in progress...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{automotive}} <b>weather</b> <b>strip</b> has {{the functions}} isolating of dust, water, {{noise and vibration}} from outside. The core of <b>weather</b> <b>strip</b> is made of steel with stiffness. By using the wire formed as the core of <b>weather</b> <b>strip,</b> weight can be reduced as much as 35 % by comparing with existing steel core. For this reason, forming wire is necessary to keep the zigzag shape as it is. The deformation which is occurred during forming process can be predicted {{and it can be}} used in case of manufacturing dies through CAE. In this paper, rolling process conditions are deduced and the springback amount is predicted after rolling process by using the simulation. The springback amount of product is measured by using optical microscope, and measurement result is compared with the simulation result of springback as the same condition.

50|$|Weatherization {{generally}} {{does not}} cause indoor air problems by adding new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes emit pollutants.) However, measures such as installing storm windows, <b>weather</b> <b>stripping,</b> caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can {{reduce the amount of}} outdoor air infiltrating into a home.

50|$|There were {{generally}} two reasons that builders {{of the period}} hewed the exterior and/or {{the interior of the}} timbers into a flat surface.

50|$|Restoration of a vehicle’s {{exterior}} {{can take many}} forms. A vehicle that has been left or abandoned will often accumulate rust over time. Sometimes this rust deterioration can render an exterior part unusable. In which case a replacement part like a fender, front grill or door mirror much be purchased outright from an external source. If rust damage is minor however the part will undergo rust repair. This {{is the process of}} removing rust from metal and returning structural integrity. This is accomplished by removing the rust through sanding or blasting to get down to bare metal. Then new sheet metal or fiberglass is applied to the affected area. Finally the piece is worked until smooth, primed and re-painted. Other materials like glass and <b>weather</b> <b>stripping</b> must be replaced as they become damaged over time. Factors like weather erosion can lead to faded and broken glass as well as dried out <b>weather</b> <b>stripping.</b> Another typical area of exterior repair is dent removal. This entails taking the original metal and re-working it to remove dents and other such blemishes. Professionals often use hammer and dolly work to remove dents. This involves placing the dented metal piece over a curved metal dolly and using an electric or manual hammer to remove the dent and smooth the metal.|$|R

At this time of year, the moths are most likely the adult stage of the army cutworm, a common pest of wheat and alfalfa. When millers emerge and begin to move westward in the spring, area residents have little recourse but to patiently await their departure. There are a few tactics, however, that can help lessen moth activity in and around homes: Keep outside lighting to a minimum. These night-flying moths are attracted to lights. A porch light, inadvertently left on, can attract hundreds or even thousands of these pests. Where lighting is necessary, use yellow light bulbs. Yellow light will not attract as many moths because insects do not sense this color very well. Seal cracks and crevices with caulking. Place <b>weather</b> <b>stripping</b> around doors and windows.

40|$|Abstract. The use of {{thermoplastic}} elastomers (TPE) {{in making}} {{parts of the}} vehicle such as a <b>weather</b> <b>strip</b> {{at the door and}} car window, floor mat, and dashboard is widespread. The commonly being used as in automotive parts manufacturing is styrene based TPE. Styrene based TPE released harmful gas, volatile organic compound (VOC) to the environment when it expose to the high temperature. Therefore, the new material with properties of thermoplastic elastomers is made from Natural rubber blend with local Tacca leontopetaloides starch and silica extracted from rice husk (as filler). Investigation on the mechanical properties by using Universal Testing Machine (UTM) found that the green material produced has potential to replace the existing floor mat used in automotive production. Indeed, when the starch was plasticized by glycerol and the volume of Natural rubber was varies, the value of tensile strength of green material produced was higher compared with existing floor mat. The VOCs released when its expose to the high temperature was much lower than the existing floor mat used. On top of that, Tacca leontopetaloides starch has potential to create low cost of new green materials in manufacturing of automotive parts...|$|R
40|$|During {{the period}} 1978 - 1980, public policy toward U. S. -regulated {{utilities}} mandated residential conservation programs.

(In Marino and Sicilian (1986) we provide an economic analysis of information and financial incentives programs.) Our principal goals are: (a) to give an economic explanation of why a regulated utility would want to provide conservation measures that reduce the demand for its primary product and (b) to examine whether existing regulatory structure and utility programs are likely to lead to economic efficiency in conservation investment.

5000|$|Yet {{another option}} for {{reducing}} the carbon footprint of humans is to use less air conditioning and heating in the home. By adding insulation to the walls and attic of one's home, and installing <b>weather</b> <b>stripping</b> or caulking around doors and windows one can lower their heating costs more than 25 percent. Similarly, one can very inexpensively upgrade the [...] "insulation" [...] (clothing) worn by residents of the home. For example, it's estimated that wearing a base layer of long underwear (top and bottom) made from a lightweight, super insulating fabric like microfleece (aka Polartec®, Capilene®) can conserve as much body heat as {{a full set of}} clothing, allowing a person to remain warm with the thermostat lowered by over 5 °C. These measures all help because they reduce the amount of energy needed to heat and cool the house. One can also turn down the heat while sleeping at night or away during the day, and keep temperatures moderate at all times. Setting the thermostat just 2 degrees lower in winter and higher in summer could save about 1 ton of carbon dioxide each year.|$|R
