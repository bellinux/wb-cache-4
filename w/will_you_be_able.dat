Before you can draw energy from the {{elements}} to rejuvenate yourself, {{you have to love}} nature, attune and identify with it. To bring it to more practical and understandable levels, you must have an almost sensuous and sensual relation with what is around you. Attune your senses finely to recognize the sensuous touches of nature. Winter flowers are not fragrant, but there is a smell to them. Identify it. Only as you become finely-honed and centered <b>will</b> <b>you</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to sense and use the presence of earth energy or that of other elements. The more you sensitize yourself, the more Nature reveals her secrets." ...|$|E
