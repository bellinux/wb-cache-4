5|$|I was {{thinking}} about how Portland is designed and planned and built, and how the planning and infrastructure of Portland is really important in what makes Portland great. I <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> the static tripod as the infrastructure. The moving part was the vibrancy and life.... The most interesting part of the sculpture will be watching people try to move it.|$|E
5|$|Moorman {{suggests}} that Lucy may represent Wordsworth's romantic interest Mary Hutchinson, but wonders {{why she would}} be represented as one who died. It is possible that Wordsworth <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> Margaret Hutchinson, Mary's sister who had died. There is no evidence, however, that the poet loved any of the Hutchinsons other than Mary. It {{is more likely that}} Margaret's death influenced but is not the foundation for Lucy.|$|E

5|$|He {{spoke to}} Harold Howitt when he <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> leaving the BTC and was {{informed}} that Miles Thomas needed an experienced accountant to institute strict financial controls at BOAC. Smallpeice would turn down the role initially, fearing BOAC (also state owned) {{would be similar to}} the BTC in terms of culture and manageability. Howitt pressed Smallpeice to reconsider and following a meeting a few days with Miles Thomas and he accepted the position at BOAC, which was tailored to the role he and Miles Thomas desired he have within the company.|$|E
5|$|In February 1846 Stone intimated to Abby Kelley Foster {{that she}} <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> {{becoming}} a public speaker, {{but not until}} the following summer did a storm of controversy over Foster’s speaking at Oberlin decide the matter for her. Faculty opposition to Foster ignited impassioned discussion of women’s rights among the students, especially of woman’s right to speak in public, which Stone vigorously defended in a joint meeting of the men’s and women’s literary societies. She followed that campus demonstration by making her first public speech at Oberlin’s August 1 commemoration of Emancipation in the West Indies.|$|E
5|$|When Kukunoor <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> a {{character}} full of disguises, {{he first came}} up with an old man. When the thought of a scene with the three major characters dancing in the dunes came up, he realized that an older character could not realistically dance in the desert. He immediately felt that Shreyas Talpade, whom he knew of knowing mimicry, could be used for bahuroopiya. Kukunoor, who worked previously with Girish Karnad, said that he was the strength for the film and added that he found him a good actor and a good human being.|$|E

5|$|The {{death of}} Ladislaus' brother-in-law, King Zvonimir of Croatia, in 1089 or 1090 created an {{opportunity}} for him to claim Croatia for himself. Ladislaus' sister, Helena, and several noblemen (mainly from northern Croatia) supported Ladislaus' claim. His troops occupied the lowlands, but a native claimant, Petar Svačić, resisted in the Petrova Mounts. Nevertheless, Croatia and Hungary remained closely connected for more than nine centuries. LadislausI appointed his nephew, Álmos, to administer Croatia. Although a younger son, Álmos was also favored against his brother, Coloman, when the king <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> his succession. Even so, Coloman succeeded his uncle in 1095, while Álmos received a separate duchy under his brother's suzerainty. Throughout Coloman's reign, the brothers' relationship remained tense, which finally led to the blinding of Álmos and his infant son.|$|E
5|$|Martin and {{the landlady}} at 3 Swaton Road, Elizabeth Haynes, {{described}} Bury as a violent drunk. On 7 April 1888, Haynes caught Bury kneeling on his bride of five days {{threatening to cut}} her throat with a knife. Haynes subsequently evicted them, and Ellen sold one of six £100 shares in a railway company that she had inherited from a maiden aunt, Margaret Barren, to pay William's debt to Martin. William was re-employed by Martin, and the couple moved to 11 Blackthorn Street, close to Swaton Road. According to Martin, William was then suffering from venereal disease. In June, Ellen sold the remaining shares, and in August they moved to 3 Spanby Road, adjacent to where William stabled his horse. With {{the money from the}} shares, the couple had a week's holiday in Wolverhampton with a drinking friend of William's and Ellen bought new jewellery. William continued to assault his wife throughout the latter half of 1888. By the first week of December, Ellen's windfall was nearly spent, and William sold his horse and cart. In January the following year, he told his landlord at 3 Spanby Road that he <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> emigrating to Brisbane, Australia, and asked him to make two wooden crates for the journey. Instead, William and Ellen moved to Dundee in Scotland. Ellen was not keen to go and only did so after William lied that he had obtained a position in a jute factory there.|$|E

25|$|He {{had also}} little trust in Lord Gort, Commander-in-Chief (C-in-C) of the BEF, whom Brooke thought too much {{interested}} in details and incapable of taking a broad strategic view.

25|$|The German Army {{emptied the}} ship of movable {{property}} during 1940, {{they could do}} this because the ship was mostly above water.

Many of the future stars of Soviet cinema, including Vasily Lanovoy, Ivan Pereverzev, Sergey Martinson, and Oleg Anofriev, were in the cast, but, as critics noted, it was Vertinskaya's passionate performance that gave Scarlet Sails its flavour. 23 million people viewed the film during its first year.|$|E
