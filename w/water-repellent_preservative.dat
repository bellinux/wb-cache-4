40|$|We {{examined}} {{the effect of}} surface-applied treatments on the above-ground decay resistance of the tenon of mortice-and-tenon timber joints designed to simulate joinery that is exposed to the weather. Joints made from untreated radiata pine, Douglas-fir, brush box, spotted gum and copper-chrome-arsenic (CCA) treated radiata pine {{were exposed to the}} weather for 9 y on above-ground racks at five sites throughout eastern Australia. Results indicate (1) a poorly maintained external paint film generally accelerated decay, (2) a brush coat of <b>water-repellent</b> <b>preservative</b> inside the joints often extended serviceability (in some cases by a factor of up to seven times that of untreated joints) and (3) the level of protection provided by a coat of primer applied inside the joint varied and in most cases was not as effective as the <b>water-repellent</b> <b>preservative</b> treatment...|$|E
40|$|Rainwater is an important, {{though not}} {{generally}} recognized, cause of paint difficulties in wood-sided houses. It gains entry {{back of the}} siding chiefly by capillary action, working through the lap joint between courses of bevel siding. High winds are a minor cause. Laboratory tests have shown that entry of rainwater through house siding can be minimized or eliminated by dressing the back of standard-pattern siding so that a tight joint, which can {{be more or less}} sealed with paint, is formed between the courses; modi-fying the standard pattern by dressing the back side and adding a horizontal groove; treating conventional or modified siding with water-repellent pre-servative before it is nailed to the house; and applying a <b>water-repellent</b> <b>preservative</b> to the siding of a completed house before the house is repainted...|$|E
40|$|Sections of the Howe truss {{railway bridge}} at Waikino {{that had been}} treated with {{preservatives}} were inspected after approximately 12 months. There were minor colour changes, particularly where CD 50 and Busan 30 L had been applied to the surface. CD 50 was the only surface treatment which was still <b>water-repellent.</b> Of the <b>preservatives</b> which had been inserted into holes bored in the stringers, the Busan Pole Gel had largely disappeared but the CN emulsion and the Impel rods had only gone where there were shakes or major voids in the wood. The inserted preservative reservoir holes were replenished and resealed. 1...|$|R
