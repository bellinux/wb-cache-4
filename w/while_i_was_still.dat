There, when I had been introduced to the art of the Indians' nine symbols through remarkable teaching, knowledge of the art very soon pleased me above all else and I came to understand it.|$|E

5000|$|Living {{funerals}} {{can also}} be seen as egocentric because the person having the funeral might use it as an opportunity to brag, since listing accomplishments during one's life is often a popular thing to do during this ceremony. However, Mizunoe Takiko, who had a living funeral on television, said that the purpose of her funeral was “to express appreciation to all those who have been dear to me <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>still</b> alive.” ...|$|R

2500|$|At the D8 conference {{hosted by}} [...] on June 2, 2010, host Kara Swisher told Zuckerberg {{she knew he}} was not happy with The Social Network being based on him, to which he replied, [...] "I just wished that nobody made a movie of me <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> alive." [...] Zuckerberg stated to Oprah Winfrey that the drama and partying of the film is mostly fiction, {{explaining}} [...] "this is my life, so I know it's not so dramatic," [...] and that he spent most of the past six years focusing, working hard, and coding Facebook. Speaking to an audience at Stanford University, Zuckerberg stated that the film portrayed his motivations for creating Facebook inaccurately; instead of an effort to [...] "get girls", he says he created the site because he enjoys [...] "building things". However, he added that the film accurately depicted his real-life wardrobe, saying, [...] "It's interesting the stuff that they focused on getting right – like every single shirt and fleece they had in that movie is actually a shirt or fleece that I own." ...|$|E
2500|$|A movie {{based on}} Zuckerberg and the {{founding}} years of Facebook, The Social Network {{was released on}} October 1, 2010, and stars Jesse Eisenberg as Zuckerberg. After Zuckerberg was told about the film, he responded, [...] "I just wished that nobody made a movie of me <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> alive." [...] Also, after the film's script was leaked on the Internet and {{it was apparent that}} the film would not portray Zuckerberg in a wholly positive light, he stated that he wanted to establish himself as a [...] "good guy". The film is based on the book The Accidental Billionaires by Ben Mezrich, which the book's publicist once described as [...] "big juicy fun" [...] rather than [...] "reportage". The film's screenwriter Aaron Sorkin told New York magazine, [...] "I don't want my fidelity to be the truth; I want it to be storytelling", adding, [...] "What is the big deal about accuracy purely for accuracy's sake, and can we not have the true be the enemy of the good?" ...|$|E

5000|$|In 100 CE, his father, Ban Chao, wrote {{a request}} to the Emperor saying, amongst other things: [...] "I have taken care to send my son (Ban) Yong to enter the {{frontier}} following porters with presents, and thus, I will arrange things so that (Ban) Yong sees the Middle Territories {{referred to as the}} Western Regions with his own eyes <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>still</b> alive."

2500|$|Sun Quan and his {{subjects}} were celebrating their conquest of Jing Province, with Lü Meng receiving the highest honour. During the banquet, Guan Yu's spirit suddenly possessed Lü Meng, grabbed Sun Quan and shouted, [...] "Green-eyed brat! Purple-bearded coward, {{do you still}} recognise me?" [...] Sun Quan's subordinates were shocked and immediately rushed forth to save their lord. The possessed Lü Meng shoved Sun Quan away and sat on his seat. With a furious expression on his face, he boomed, [...] "Since defeating the Yellow Turban rebels, I've fought in wars for over 30 years. But I lost my life because you used an evil scheme against me. I can't feast on your flesh <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> alive, but I can still seize Lü Meng's soul after death! I'm Guan Yunchang, the Marquis of Hanshou Village." [...] Sun Quan {{and the others were}} so terrified that they sank to their knees. Lü Meng collapsed and died, bleeding from seven body orifices. Everyone was traumatised by the scene they witnessed.|$|E

5000|$|On 3 July, Red Bull driver David Coulthard {{announced}} he was to retire {{at the end of}} the season, saying: [...] "My decision was taken earlier this year and is based on a desire to stop <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>still</b> competitive". He also explained the timing of the statement: [...] "The decision to make this announcement at the British Grand Prix should be an obvious one for all to understand, as I have achieved two of my F1 victories at Silverstone and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> a member of the British Racing Drivers' Club, which hosts this event." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I have," [...] she answered, [...] "a little. It {{gives me}} more hope.

And <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>still</b> aware of the {{distance}} between Christ's perfection and my own imperfection, I feel that the possibility is greater of lessening that distance. It gives me more self-respect, more self-reliance. George Bridges says that the logical conclusion of that old doctrine is what philosophers call determinism--Calvinistic predestination. I can't believe in that. The kind of grace God gives me is the grace to help myself by drawing force from the element of him in my soul. He gives me the satisfaction of developing." ...|$|R

60|$|On reflection, I {{find myself}} troubled by {{complexities}} and contradictions {{in the view}} presented of this young man's character. To decide positively whether I can justify to myself and to my regard for Eunice, an attempt to reunite the lovers, requires more time for consideration than I can reasonably expect that Helena's patience will allow. Having a quiet hour or two still before me, I have determined to make extracts from the letters for my own use; {{with the intention of}} referring to them <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>still</b> in doubt which way my decision ought to incline.

40|$|<b>I</b> know it <b>is</b> my core, my purest {{nature to}} incessantly {{question}} myself and everything around me; as we {{pertain to the}} universe. As Robert Wilson suggests 2 ̆ 2 I will always ask 2 ̆ 7 What is it? 2 ̆ 7 before telling you what it is. 2 ̆ 2 My goal is to present you with some tools with which to approach your craft, your life, your uncertainties. And though I {{may not always be}} the best example, I still wish to encourage all that read this or spend time with me to see this craft/business and indeed your life as a great, happy adventure; guided by love. Because this will always lead to good and positive experiences, whatever path you find yourself on. In what <b>I</b> <b>am</b> doing now <b>I</b> <b>am</b> preparing to transition from a career in makeup into my next interest/phase/period with energy and excitement. Not disappointment, regret or rejection as I have seen over the years when this business is done with someone. And I think my timing is just about right, as I have done it <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>still</b> in demand, <b>while</b> my phone <b>is</b> <b>still</b> ringing, <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>still</b> {{at the top of my}} game, my craft. If this collection of thoughts is perceived a success or is widely read, discussed, or deliberated, because I have aimed it at, geared it toward or written it for success or sensationalism, then I have failed, and this amounts to little more than advertising or cheap unsatisfying tabloid television. But if this in any way grabs, challenges, informs, suspends you, makes you question or dream then like theatre when it is at its truest, most profound, rawest, absolutely undecorated, it serves its purpose: To move us forward to new debate, to new exploration of this/our condition...|$|R

40|$|To {{armchair}} travelers, {{especially in}} the United States, few places have a stronger allure than far-off Alaska. Now that the 2 ̆ 2 wild and woolly 2 ̆ 2 west is really alive only {{so far as it}} serves to accentuate our historical heritage, this land of the far north has become our last frontier. To the geologist, mineralogist, and, I might add, even to the layman, {{one of the most interesting}} features of the territory is its large placer gold deposits. Every American boy has heard of the Nome gold rush, and the more literarily adventurous have undoubtedly delved into the sagas of Jack London. Like most lands which have been glorified in the popular mind, many erroneous notions have arisen about Alaska. <b>While</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>still</b> a green-horn as far as the North is concerned, my picture of this territory has, since my brief visit to Alaska, changed considerably. Part of what is said here is a reflection of this change of mind...|$|R

Yes, here she spoke of continual efforts and of [...] "that long, long preparation"--of prayer and fasting also. Here, too, was the whole secret summed up in a dozen words: [...] "To see a spirit one must grow akin to spirits." [...] Well, it could be done, and he would do it.
