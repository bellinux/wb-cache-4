50|$|<b>What</b> fatally {{weakened}} <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> was <b>the</b> {{testimony of}} his mother. The defence persuaded Justice Cameron that the boy’s testimony was obtained under duress, {{as a result}} of his mother's wanting more money. Justice Armour had rejected this notion in the first trial, but Cameron’s decision to accept it meant that <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> had little chance. Mrs. O’Conner’s testimony fell apart when she failed to accurately tell her boy’s correct age, and she was also unable to give a clear explanation for her recent trip to Toronto to visit with the Deputy Attorney General. McMahon used this to show the jury that she was trying to secure more money for the boy’s testimony, because her family was struggling to survive after their house had been burnt down. This made her lose her temper and she arrived on the stand already upset after a dispute with fellow witness Mrs. Pat Whalen. She should have explained clearly that her family did need more money and that the provincial bureaucrats were unwilling to provide this, and that was unrelated to <b>the</b> Crown <b>prosecution.</b> Reaney speculates that the bureaucrats did not want to aid a friend of the Donnellys. Mrs. O’Conner’s testimony did not go over well and ended any chances <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> might have had, with judge, jury and public opinion already at least leaning if not outright against them.|$|R

40|$|The {{process of}} investigation, which begins when a crime is {{reported}} and ends after a suspect {{has been convicted}} or discharged by a court of law, is a mammoth task which requires cooperation between various stakeholders, such as investigators and prosecutors. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the role of the specialized commercial crime investigators in the prosecution process. The study evaluated and explored the status of the current roles played by these investigators with the intention of recommending changes that could improve investigator practice. Two research questions were posed. First, the researcher endeavoured to find answers to a question regarding <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> process entails. Secondly, the researcher sought to establish the roles of the specialised commercial crime investigator in the prosecution process. It was envisaged that the answers to these questions could be obtained from specialised commercial crime investigators and prosecutors deployed in the commercial crimes courts. On this basis two samples were chosen, with nine investigators from the Gauteng North office of the Specialised Commercial Crimes Unit and four prosecutors from the Specialised Commercial Crimes Court in Gauteng North. Some of the findings were that the investigators in trying to fulfil their roles of investigations have an adverse impact on the investigation and successful prosecution of offenders, which in turn lead to recidivism and apathy among the communities being served by the police and the justice system in general. The image of the police, particularly that of the commercial crime investigators, is often negated and the justice system is portrayed as a failure in addressing the problem of crime. The conclusions drawn from the data were that the roles of investigators in the prosecution process are mandatory as they are legislated rather that persuasive and that investigators cannot rely on prosecutors to handle all aspects of investigation once a case has been handed over to the prosecution. Apart from a lack of knowledge about these roles, it was established that some investigators deliberately ignore their roles in this relationship. It is proposed that dedicated training should be afforded to investigators and prosecutors above their existing training, with a focus on how to take part in the prosecution process. Investigators should be informed that their responsibilities in the prosecution process are a result of legislation and that failure to satisfy the legislation will carry adverse consequences for the investigation itself, the prosecution and the other stakeholders.
