All versions of the IIc Mouse <b>will</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> any Macintosh or Apple II card.

25|$|Tuvalu’s National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA) {{describes}} {{a response to}} the climate change problem as using the combined efforts of several local bodies on each island that <b>will</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> the local community leaders (the Falekaupule). The main office, named the Department of Environment, is responsible for coordinating the non-governmental organizations, religious bodies, and stakeholders. Each of the named groups are responsible for implementing Tuvalu’s NAPA, the main plan to adapt to the adverse effects of human use and climate change.|$|E
25|$|The {{project has}} been split into two phases since its {{approval}} in 2003. The New Street Gateway Steering Committee, chaired by Mike Whitby, is a committee dedicated to getting the plans to materialise. The council's project manager for Gateway Plus is David Pywell, who was also the Strategic Director of Development for Birmingham City Council before retiring in September 2006. Network Rail announced in 2005 {{that it will be}} setting up an entrepreneurial team that <b>will</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> developers and investors working on the project. In April 2009, Network Rail announced that Chris Montgomery had been appointed as managing director of the project.|$|E

25|$|When {{inflation}} pushes up prices {{beyond what}} the company is able to pay, this is often easily worked around by reducing the quantity supplied in each item, for example by {{reducing the amount of}} tape on reels of selotape, or selling eggs by the dozen instead of 18s. Nadir's son and buying director, Faisal, who takes care of the day-to-day running, notes that the lowest margin he <b>will</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> is 20percent. In response to the planned VAT rise to 20% in January 2011, the budget chain said it would not change its prices but would stop selling goods that did not make a profit.|$|E
25|$|Like the 2009 version, a Mini DisplayPort (which {{allows for}} a VGA connection, via a non-included cable) is included. A HDMI port, which Apple {{describes}} as being HDMI 1.4 compliant, replaces the Mini-DVI port on the prior models {{as one of the}} main video connection methods. The HDMI port supports up to 1080p on HDMI connections and 8 channel 24-bit audio at 192kHz, Dolby Surround 5.1 and stereo output. With the included HDMI to DVI adapter, for those currently using a DVI interface, the HDMI port <b>will</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> resolutions up to 1920 × 1200 pixels, while the Mini DisplayPort can concurrently support a resolution up to 2560 × 1600 pixels.|$|E
25|$|Another common {{complaint}} {{was that it}} lacked the functions of a mobile PDA, although there are now several PIM options created by the community. Also, for Internet access away from Wi-Fi hotspots, the Nokia 770 relies upon a Bluetooth 1.2 phone acting as a modem, and not all bluetooth phones <b>will</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> the tablet. Additionally some complained that the device used Reduced-Size MMC (RS-MMC or Micro-MMC) cards that were originally difficult to find. However, the format has since been used in other products and has become widely available. The device originally could only use cards up to 1GB, but 2GB cards are supported with {{the current version of}} the operating system.|$|E
