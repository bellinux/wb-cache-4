5|$|Uxmal is a Mayan {{city in the}} Puuc Hills of Yucatán Peninsula, Mexico. The Governor's Palace at Uxmal {{is often}} used as an exemplar of why it is {{important}} to combine ethnographic and alignment data. The palace is aligned with an azimuth of 118° on the pyramid of Cehtzuc. This alignment corresponds approximately to the southernmost rising and, with a much greater precision, to the northernmost setting of Venus; both phenomena occur once every eight years. By itself this would not be sufficient to argue for a meaningful connection between the two events. The palace has to be aligned in one direction or another and <b>why</b> <b>should</b> <b>the</b> rising of Venus be any more important than the rising of the Sun, Moon, other planets, Sirius et cetera? The answer given is that not only does the palace point towards significant points of Venus, it is also covered in glyphs which stand for Venus and Mayan zodiacal constellations. Moreover, the great northerly extremes of Venus always occur in late April or early May, coinciding with the onset of the rainy season. The Venus glyphs placed in the cheeks of the Maya rain god Chac, most likely referring to the concomitance of these phenomena, support the west-working orientation scheme.|$|E

500|$|For the majority, <b>Why</b> <b>Should</b> <b>the</b> Fire Die? {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} United States contemporary music critics. [...] PopMatters {{said that the}} album was [...] "hardly the stuff of mountain music", and Village Voice described it to be [...] "much sleeker, sexier, and more carefully assembled than work by the competition." [...] A review from the Houston Chronicle also stated that <b>Why</b> <b>Should</b> <b>the</b> Fire Die? is [...] "like Wilco with country rock and Radiohead with guitar riff rock," [...] and that [...] "the trio has successfully proved the vitality of creative Darwinism." [...] Some critics even {{went as far as}} to call the album's musical genre [...] "emo-grass".|$|E

500|$|Reviews for <b>Why</b> <b>Should</b> <b>the</b> Fire Die? also {{included}} {{praise of the}} album's vocals, particularly Sara Watkins' [...] "snippy", [...] "beautifully sung" [...] and [...] "assertive" [...] vocals on various tracks, and the trio's vocal harmonization was also complimented.|$|E
500|$|The eighth {{song and}} second {{instrumental}} on <b>Why</b> <b>Should</b> <b>the</b> Fire Die?, [...] "Stumptown", {{was written by}} Chris Thile. The song was written {{as a tribute to}} Stumptown Coffee Roasters, Chris Thile's favorite coffee house in the world. [...] "Stumptown" [...] is also the album's shortest song, at one minute and forty three seconds. [...] "Anthony", the ninth track, is the only song recorded by Nickel Creek that was written solely by Sara Watkins. [...] "Anthony", which features a ukulele melody, was described by several critics to be [...] "old-timey". One of three Thile-Watkins-Watkins composed pieces on the album, [...] "Best Of Luck" [...] was the tenth track on <b>Why</b> <b>Should</b> <b>the</b> Fire Die?. Sara Watkins had the lead vocal for [...] "Best Of Luck", and was complimented by critics for her [...] "snippy" [...] and [...] "assertive" [...] vocal. prefix Magazine pegged the song to be the formula that makes [...] "this album, and trio, unstoppable". The eleventh track, [...] "Doubting Thomas", was written by Chris Thile and is named after Doubting Thomas, a biblical term. All the members of Nickel Creek came from devout Christian families, and the song is about questioning faith. The third and final instrumental, [...] "First and Last Waltz", is <b>Why</b> <b>Should</b> <b>the</b> Fire Die?s twelfth track. One of the three songs written by all of Nickel Creek's members, it comes before the penultimate track, [...] "Helena". At Nickel Creek's concerts, the song was played as a segue into [...] "Helena". The album recording of [...] "First And Last Waltz" [...] has been called a [...] "chilly effects-draped recital piece", due to its use of sound effects. [...] "Helena", the penultimate track, was written by Chris Thile. Producer Eric Valentine provided drumming duties for this song. Thile described the track to be what he considered [...] "the ultimate climax" [...] of <b>Why</b> <b>Should</b> <b>the</b> Fire Die?, and some contemporary critics found the song to be the highlight of the album. [...] The final song on <b>Why</b> <b>Should</b> <b>the</b> Fire Die?, the title track, is a slow waltz. PopMatters described the song as being [...] "gorgeously sung", but [...] "an odd choice to conclude a record that is so often bidding for the true fun of pop music".|$|E
500|$|The {{recording}} for <b>Why</b> <b>Should</b> <b>the</b> Fire Die? {{took place}} at Barefoot Recording in Los Angeles, California. In an interview with Rolling Stone, Thile said: [...] "The studio needs to be dark. I don't want to be reminded by my surroundings that what I'm singing about isn't happening right then. I like to really dissolve into the story. But the Jamesons I use more for keeping my vocal cords relaxed and clear." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{release of}} <b>Why</b> <b>Should</b> <b>the</b> Fire Die? {{marked the first}} major Nickel Creek release with Alison Krauss absent as a producer. The album's {{producing}} duties were carried out by Tony Berg and former Smash Mouth producer Eric Valentine. Sara Watkins stated {{in an interview with}} Paste Magazine that the producer change made for a [...] "more congruent project overall". The band attributed much of the credit for their morphing sound to both their new producers and Krauss. The album was not recorded digitally, but in a more [...] way using Telefunken microphones, and the special effects in the fiddle on the track [...] "First and Last Waltz" [...] was reel tape delay.|$|E
500|$|... "When in Rome", {{the opening}} track on <b>Why</b> <b>Should</b> <b>the</b> Fire Die?, {{was chosen as}} the album's only single. The song's title alludes to the American proverb [...] "When in Rome, do as the Romans do", [...] and Chris Thile, the song's author, said [...] "The idea behind the song– and I do love it! - is if there is {{something}} better, it's worth leaning towards just a little bit because you'll have a great time here regardless." [...] Critics commented on the song favorably, with George Graham saying that [...] "When in Rome" [...] has [...] "rock energy level and some sonic manipulation, with hints of old-time Appalachian music in the fiddle, while the lyrics are definitely in the rock mode." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the time}} that Nickel Creek spent writing songs for <b>Why</b> <b>Should</b> <b>the</b> Fire Die?, {{numerous}} songs {{did not make the}} cut, and only fourteen were used in the final draft of the album. When discussing the album, Sean Watkins said that the band [...] "did so much co-writing together and filtering. I mean there’s like 30 songs that didn’t get used." [...] After writing the songs, Sara Watkins said in her online journal that the trio spent five days [...] "going over the details of the arrangements on each of the seventeen songs we're seriously considering for the record and making good demos of each of them". The band started recording the album in November 2004, and the album was [...] "completed, mixed, and mastered" [...] by April 2005.|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reaction}} {{improved with}} the third episode; writing in New Statesman, Andrew Billen praised Episode 3 as being [...] "intricately constructed as a farce", and commented positively on Ripley's and Nesbitt's acting. Billen compared the production and fantasy scenes with Thirtysomething and Ally McBeal. In the Evening Standard, following the conclusion of Vanity Fair and prior to the broadcast of Episode 6, Billen wrote, [...] "The style is light, the narrative frequently inconsequential. The men go to the pub and lust after the barmaid. The women meet in the wine bar and make fun of the men for lusting after the barmaid. The great settings are DIY stores, antenatal classes and sitting rooms. Why should anyone be interested? If domestic trivia has now been outlawed by the BBC as a subject for sitcoms and if even soap operas rely on murders and armed sieges to keep up their figures, <b>why</b> <b>should</b> <b>the</b> travails {{of a set of}} ex-dinkies have become a minor cult?" [...] He analysed the series in relation to its early-middle-aged viewers being [...] "a forgotten people", comparing the storylines to real-life issues experienced by friends. He concluded: ...|$|E
500|$|The second track, [...] "Somebody More Like You" [...] {{was written}} by guitarist Sean Watkins. The {{break-up}} song, written from Watkins' perspective, was described as [...] "scathing", and like [...] "Aimee Mann-style modern pop", with lyrics like [...] "I hope you meet someone your height {{so you can see}} eye to eye/With someone as small as you". Watkins said the song wasn't written for anyone in particular, but said [...] "I had this clever line and decided to build a song around it." [...] "Jealous of the Moon", the third track, was co-written by Chris Thile and Gary Louris of Jayhawks fame. This song was released as a promotional single in the United States. The fourth track and first instrumental on <b>Why</b> <b>Should</b> <b>the</b> Fire Die?, [...] "Scotch & Chocolate", earned Nickel Creek a Grammy Award nomination for Best Country Instrumental. However, the song lost to the trio's former record producer Alison Krauss with her band Union Station for [...] "Unionhouse Branch", from the band's twelfth album, Lonely Runs Both Ways. As with the first three songs on the album, critics responded favorably to [...] "Scotch & Chocolate". Rolling Stone considered the song to be [...] "Celtic-infused", Slant Magazine named it the best song on the album, and Stylus Magazine [...] called it a [...] "brisk, lively instrumental". The latter also said the song was [...] "every bit as physically exciting as Shooter Jennings or Big and Rich." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Can't Complain", a Chris Thile-composed piece, was {{the fifth}} track on <b>Why</b> <b>Should</b> <b>the</b> Fire Die?. According to Sean Watkins, the song was written by Thile [...] "from {{the point of view}} of a friend". Unlike the first four songs on the album, the song {{received}} mixed reviews. Being There called it [...] "nothing more than a generic ballad with little merit", and PopMatters said that it was a [...] "one-too-many Thile tune about screwed-up relationships". However, some critics found it amazing; Village Voice called the song a [...] "lushly arpeggiated ballad". The sixth track, a Bob Dylan cover, [...] "Tomorrow is a Long Time", was the only track on the album not composed at least partially by one of the members of Nickel Creek. The track had previously been covered by [...] "Watkins Family Hour", a duo that consists of Sara Watkins and Sean Watkins, at their home base of Largo in Los Angeles. Both the album version and the live Watkins Family Hour version feature Sara Watkins as the lead vocalist. Watkins was heavily praised for her [...] "graceful" [...] and [...] "beautifully" [...] sung rendition of the song. [...] "Eveline", a tribute to the James Joyce short story of the same name, was the seventh track on the album. A Thile-Sean Watkins composed piece, [...] "Eveline" [...] has been said to feature [...] "irregular tunings", and vocal harmonization that is similar to that on Radiohead's OK Computer. Allmusic cited this track as the [...] "brooding centerpiece" [...] of the album.|$|E
