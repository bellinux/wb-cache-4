25|$|The {{penitent}} is {{the subject}} rather than the object of this discourse. Contrition {{is not something that}} happens to the penitent but is rather an affect he or she creates, as the focus on humility and on the weeping voice suggests. Affectivity is the translation of idea into expressive gesture, and this moment is surely an affective one. If the genuineness of a late-medieval spiritual experience is confirmed by its external signs—by its affectivity, in other words—we should extend the same criterion to the early evidence, where we find that it <b>works</b> <b>just</b> as well.|$|E

However, {{it is more}} hygroscopic than powders made from potassium nitrate—popularly known as saltpeter. Because corned black powder grains made with saltpeter are less affected by moisture in the air, they can be stored unsealed without degradation by humidity. Muzzleloaders {{have been known to}} fire after hanging on a wall for decades in a loaded state, provided they remained dry. By contrast, black powder made with sodium nitrate must be kept sealed to remain stable.|$|E

25|$|Early Soviet authors {{sometimes}} {{benefited from}} international copyright on their <b>works</b> <b>just</b> naturally. Maxim Gorky and Sergei Prokofiev, for instance, both {{had lived for}} some time abroad and published works in other countries that {{were members of the}} Berne Convention. These works of theirs were copyrighted in all other signatory countries of the Berne Convention. After the case of Doctor Zhivago, Soviet publishers became more aware of this possibility to have Soviet works covered by the Berne Convention. Soviet state organizations began to arrange for (simultaneous) first publication of some Soviet works in a country of the Berne Convention. For instance, Mikhail Sholokov's novel They Fought for Their Country was officially first published in Italy.|$|E
25|$|Additionally WAAS <b>works</b> <b>just</b> as well between airports. This {{allows the}} {{aircraft}} to fly directly from one airport to another, {{as opposed to}} following routes based on ground-based signals. This can cut route distances considerably in some cases, saving both time and fuel. In addition, because {{of its ability to}} provide information on the accuracy of each GPS satellite's information, aircraft equipped with WAAS are permitted to fly at lower en-route altitudes than was possible with ground-based systems, which were often blocked by terrain of varying elevation. This enables pilots to safely fly at lower altitudes, not having to rely on ground-based systems. For unpressurized aircraft, this conserves oxygen and enhances safety.|$|E

After being detached for a brief reconnaissance to Todd’s Tavern, the 140th rejoined the brigade in its slide to the east, closer to the left end of the Union line. There, early on the morning of May 12 they took part in the massive assault on the part of the Confederate line known as the “Mule Shoe.” The men had to pick their way through trees felled to form an abatis before making their way up to the Mule Shoe, where they managed to dislodge the Rebels from their first line, but were unable to proceed further, having to settle into the <b>works</b> <b>just</b> captured. On May 15 the 1st Division was ordered to the rear and occupied this position until the 21st, when they joined Grant’s next flank movement to the east toward North Anna River.

500|$|Conversely, Richard Corliss, {{writing for}} Time, gave a mixed review. [...] "The opening cartoon <b>works</b> <b>just</b> fine but too fine. The opening scene upstages {{the movie that}} emerges from it," [...] he said. Corliss was mainly annoyed by the homages to the Golden Age of American animation. Animation legend Chuck Jones made a rather scathing attack on the film in his book Chuck Jones Conversations. Among his complaints, Jones accused Robert Zemeckis of robbing Richard Williams of any {{creative}} input and ruining the piano duel that both he and Williams storyboarded.|$|E

It appears the sign is centred on the sewage <b>works</b> <b>just</b> west of Navenby. The pentagram is seen as having magical associations and is often said to have offered protection to witches. It also, however, has links with Christianity, Freemasonry and the Knights Templar, who used the pentagram symbol to represent [...] "infinity, connectiveness and oneness".|$|E
500|$|The Hot Rock {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} music critics. AllMusic reviewer Steve Huey said that The Hot Rock [...] "isn't quite as immediately satisfying as its two brilliant predecessors, {{but it does}} reward those willing to spend time absorbing its nervy introspection and moodiness". Huey also praised the band's use of dynamic tempo changes within the album's songs. Wendy Mitchell, writing for CMJ New Music Monthly, felt that the band [...] "has matured into the musical equivalent of a twentysomething; still {{holding on to the}} energy of its youth, but exploring new options". The A.V. Club writer Stephen Thompson opined that The Hot Rock [...] "lacks the blaze-of-glory freshness of its justly acclaimed predecessors, [...] but [...] <b>works</b> <b>just</b> fine on its own as a terrific, explosive, and fun rock record".|$|E

500|$|... "When I Grow Up" [...] {{received}} acclaim {{from music}} critics. Bill Lamb from About.com listed [...] "When I Grow Up" [...] {{among the top}} tracks on Doll Domination, stating that the song [...] "bursts out of the blocks", {{and that it was}} of no surprise that it [...] "landed in the pop top 10 with ease". On a separate review, Lamb gave the song three out of five stars. He noted that the [...] "anonymous nature" [...] of the group's vocals and [...] "sexual lyrical tease" [...] is starting to wear thin, stating: [...] "This is more of the same, not a step forward". Lamb, however, did compliment the song as being a [...] "catchy dance workout", and stated that the song carries their [...] "usual sassiness" [...] and [...] "pounding dance beats". Nick Levine from Digital Spy echoed Lamb's comments, noting that the song is a [...] "bolshy, hyperactive pop stomper that <b>works</b> <b>just</b> as well in the aerobics class as it does on the dance-floor." [...] He continued: [...] "If they keep releasing singles as infectious as this, they could last longer than we'd think."

[...] The square {{in the center of}} town, as well as Dorrisville and Gaskins City, stand on top of a series of {{sandstone}} bluffs that were once islands rising above natural lowlands, [...] above sea level, dredged by the middle fork of the Saline River. The Saline River was a navigable river used by early settlers for transportation to and from Salt <b>Works</b> <b>just</b> east of Harrisburg. The Saline flowed towards the Ohio and flooded every spring in events called Freshets. The locals called the island [...] "Crusoe's Island". When the area was drained, homes and businesses were built in the floodplain, and it became prone to serious flooding for years to come. The town square {{in the center of town}} is a sandstone bluff [...] above sea level, one of the first that start the Shawnee Hills to the south. Topographic maps show the bluffs that rise from the Saline River that wraps the northeast part of the city. Harrisburg {{is located at}} the ending point of the Laurentide ice sheet, which covered about 85 percent of Illinois. The edge of Illinoian ice sheet(s) lay further south than the southernmost extent, i.e. Douglas County, Kansas, of any of the Pre-Illinoian ice sheets.|$|E
500|$|Kevin Dunsmore of Hardcore Gamer {{wrote that}} the plot was much more {{grounded}} and realistic than other recent titles in the series and echoed Push Squares review by commenting on the gameplay, writing [...] "You're not a super soldier {{stuck in the middle}} of out-of-this-world set piece, but rather a regular soldier working with a squad to complete objectives." [...] However, he stated that the decision to keep many of the design choices intact from the original was both refreshing and a hindrance; he highlighted examples from the campaign, such as infinitely-spawning enemies, and similarly condemned infamous perks and a lack of killstreak-countering in the multiplayer that had not been removed or fixed, finding it [...] "extremely outdated". Despite this, he complimented the multiplayer as feeling fresh, saying [...] "After years of over-the-top killstreaks, wall-running, and other crazy antics, it's nice {{to get back to the}} basics". He heavily praised the visual enhancements on display, saying [...] "Modern Warfare Remastered is the most extensive visual upgrade any remaster has ever received yet, being more in line with a remake than an actual remaster. [...] It's a stunning overhaul." [...] He concluded by saying [...] "What Raven has accomplished is impressive, but it has its limits. A few tweaks would have gone a long way to fixing some balancing issues, but for those looking for a blast from the past, this <b>works</b> <b>just</b> fine".|$|E

500|$|Overall, {{reviews of}} the film were highly positive. Entertainment Weekly critic Owen Gleiberman awarded the film an [...] "A" [...] grade, hailing the film as a [...] "procedural thriller for the {{information}} age" [...] that [...] "spins your head in a new way, luring you into a vortex and then deeper still." [...] Nathan Lee in his review for The Village Voice wrote that director Fincher's [...] "very lack of pretense, coupled with a determination to get the facts down with maximum economy and objectivity, gives Zodiac its hard, bright integrity. As a crime saga, newspaper drama, and period piece, it <b>works</b> <b>just</b> fine. As an allegory {{of life in the}} information age, it blew my mind." [...] Todd McCarthy's review in Variety praised the film's [...] "almost unerringly accurate evocation of the workaday San Francisco of 35–40 years ago. Forget the distorted emphasis on hippies and flower-power that many such films indulge in; this is the city as it was experienced by most people who lived and worked there." [...] David Ansen, in his review for Newsweek magazine, wrote, [...] "Zodiac is meticulously crafted – Harris Savides's state-of-the-art digital cinematography has a richness indistinguishable from film – and it runs almost two hours and 40 minutes. Still, the movie holds you in its grip from start to finish. Fincher boldly (and some may think perversely) withholds the emotional and forensic payoff we're conditioned to expect from a big studio movie." [...] Roger Ebert gave the film 4 stars out of a possible 4, writing: [...] "The film is a police procedural crossed with a newspaper movie, but free of most of the cliches of either. Its most impressive accomplishment is to gather a bewildering labyrinth of facts and suspicions over a period of years, and make the journey through this maze frightening and suspenseful." [...] Ebert also praised the casting (critical in an ensemble film) and, as a longtime columnist for The Chicago Sun-Times, asserted Zodiac was [...] "intriguing in its accuracy" [...] in showing the operation of a major newspaper.|$|E

[...] GameSpot's Ricardo Torres called Monkey Race [...] "a solid little racer", and Casamassina recounted it felt [...] "polished and finely tuned." [...] Stevenson [...] "loved Monkey Fight", while Casamassina and Kent highlighted {{the use of a}} crown to identify the player currently in the lead as encouraging [...] "players to gang up on each other." [...] Casamassina hailed Monkey Fight as [...] "a thing of beauty", but Turner dismissed it as [...] "a dud, as it's too much frantic button smacking and not enough skill or thought." [...] Monkey Target, lauded by Kent as the [...] "most addictive interactive activity of 2001" [...] and considered [...] "the most complex" [...] of the party games by Turner, was complimented by Casamassina for its [...] "simple and brilliantly intuitive" [...] control scheme and [...] "careful science of when to use an item and when to forgo it." [...] Nintendo Power and Medina, respectively, described Monkey Billiards as [...] "a full-blown pool game" [...] and [...] "a very fun alternative to the real game"; Casamassina applauded its [...] "ultra-realistic physics engine that perfectly mimics how pool balls would react... it all <b>works</b> <b>just</b> as good if not better than any pool simulation available to home consoles." [...] Casamassina was further impressed by the physics of Monkey Bowling, elaborating that [...] "when the pins break apart one would swear it's the real deal", but Turner criticized its physics as [...] "slightly wonky". Medina singled out Monkey Bowling's [...] "nailbiting" [...] challenge mode as a personal favorite, while Nintendo Power considered Monkey Bowling [...] "as good as tenpin gets" [...] and Kent wrote it [...] "is one of the most robust bowling simulations I have ever played." [...] Finally, Four-Eyed Dragon conveyed that Monkey Golf provided [...] "a humongous challenge" [...] with [...] "crazy, lopsided miniature golf course", while Kent called it an [...] "absolutely infuriating... test [...] your aim and your logic." ...|$|E
