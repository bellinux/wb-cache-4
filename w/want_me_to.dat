No one can live that way. So I fought him… You want to know what I think of Harry Cohn? He was a monster.|$|E
25|$|Modern liberal {{democracy}} is a compromise between the twin ideals of freedom and democracy. Mosterín emphasizes their differences: freedom comes down to doing what I want to do; democracy, to doing what (the majority of) the others <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> do. Rejecting as muddled the metaphysical notion of free will, he focuses on political freedom, the absence of coercion or interference by others in my personal decisions. Because of the tendencies to violence and aggression that lurk in human nature, some constraint on freedom is necessary for peaceful and fruitful social life, but the more freedom we enjoy, the better. Especially, there is no rational ground for curtailing the cultural freedoms (of language, religion and customs) {{in the name of}} the nation, the church or the party. From this point of view, Internet provides a much more attractive model than the obsolete nation-state or the nationalistic movements. Mosterín thinks that the nation-state is incompatible with the full development of freedom, whose blossoming requires the reorganization of the world political system along cosmopolitan lines. He proposes a world without nation-states, territorially organized in small autonomous but not-sovereign cantonal polities, complemented by strong world organizations.|$|E

500|$|On 6 January 1969, the band's {{third day}} at Twickenham Film Studios, in {{south-west}} London, an argument was captured on film where McCartney criticised Harrison's guitar {{playing on the}} song [...] "Two of Us". A resigned Harrison told him: [...] "I'll play what you <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> play, or I won't play at all if you don't <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> play." [...] With the sessions being recorded by film director Michael Lindsay-Hogg, tapes reveal Beatles associates Neil Aspinall and George Martin sympathising with Harrison's position, recognising that McCartney and Lennon [...] "don't offer him enough freedom within their compositions". Ringo Starr, who had quit the band briefly during the White Album sessions, {{partly as a result}} of McCartney's hectoring of his drumming, recalled of Harrison's refusal to be [...] "dominated" [...] by McCartney any longer: [...] "Paul [...] wanted to point out the solo to George, who would say, 'Look, I'm a guitarist. I'll play the solo.' And he always did, he always played fine solos." ...|$|E

And they were like, 'Well we don't {{want to say that}} but that's sort of the idea." [...] Thorne said the producers were looking for [...] "a certain type in terms of a strong woman who could keep up with all the men" [...] and that they incorporated elements of Thorne's own personality into the character, such as the strong amount of trust she has in her instincts. Thorne also said she was treated well by the cast, but upon starting, [...] "I was very {{aware of the fact that}} it's predominantly men, and I have no problem saying that as a small, dark woman I was terrified. I thought I was going to be put through the ringer." [...] Gerety, when asked about his experience joining the show, said only, [...] "It's interesting. It's really interesting." ...|$|E

After the photograph was published in newspapers across the United States, Hartnett received a telegram from Baseball Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis instructing him not to have his photograph taken with Capone in the future.

500|$|The {{film was}} a {{critical}} success, though some critics wondered about the social impact of a character that they saw as sympathetic. Cagney was still struggling against his gangster typecasting. He said to a journalist, [...] "It's what the people <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> do. Some day, though, I'd like to make another movie that kids could go and see." [...] However, Warner Bros., perhaps searching for another Yankee Doodle Dandy, assigned Cagney a musical for his next picture, 1950's The West Point Story with Doris Day, an actress he admired.|$|E

Despite the talk of Lennon being working class—as were Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr—he later refuted the idea by saying, [...] "I was a nice clean-cut suburban boy, and in the class system I was about a half an inch in a higher class than Paul, George and Ringo, who lived in subsidised government houses. We owned our own house, had our own garden. They didn't have anything like that".|$|E

500|$|R. Kelly, portraying [...] "The Remix Killer", {{released}} an unofficial remix {{of the song}} in April 2008. During most of his section of the song, Kelly sings of shining, drinking and two-stepping in a club, and he promises to kiss any place on Mariah's body she wants: [...] "Girl, if you let me, I'm gonna touch it / But if I touch it, I'm gonna wanna hit it." [...] Later, he mimics Carey's bridge: [...] "If some honies up in here that <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> touch her body / Touch it / Let me hear you say, 'I-i-i-i do.'" [...] According to Kelly, the remix is unofficial, and his lyrics are freestyle rap.|$|E
500|$|In May 2001, it was {{revealed}} that Harrison had undergone an operation to remove a cancerous growth from one of his lungs, and in July, it was reported that he was being treated for a brain tumour at a clinic in Switzerland. While in Switzerland, Starr visited him but had to cut his stay short to travel to Boston, where his daughter was undergoing emergency brain surgery, prompting Harrison to quip: [...] "Do you <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> come with you?" [...] In November 2001, he began radiotherapy at Staten Island University Hospital, in New York City, for non-small cell lung cancer that had spread to his brain. When the news was publicised, Harrison bemoaned his physician's breach of privacy, and his estate later claimed damages.|$|E
500|$|In Shiloh, Naylor {{does not}} impart an {{explicit}} meaning of [...] "honesty" [...] to her juvenile readers, journalist Nancy Gilson observed. Instead, she conveys how [...] "confusing and unanswerable" [...] morality is using main character Marty's ethical predicaments and plot twists. To harbor Shiloh from the antagonist Judd and his principled parents, Marty must steal food and tell falsehoods. His dishonest actions {{serve as a}} contrast to his conscientious persona and his benevolent rescuing of the dog. Every night, Marty prays, [...] "Jesus ... which do you <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> do?

According to Godrich, [...] "I literally left him on a fucking table in my house and went and recorded. And it was a very, very emotional day for me. He was a string player as well so it was one of those things where it felt like he would <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> go and just do this." [...] Around the same period, Yorke announced his separation from his wife, Rachel Owen, who died of cancer several months after the album's completion. He told Rolling Stone: [...] "There was a lot of difficult stuff going on at the time, and it was a tough time for us as people. It was a miracle that that record got made at all." ...|$|E
500|$|Through the years, she {{has come}} to be {{regarded}} as one of the most powerful people in fashion, setting trends, and anointing new designers. Industry publicists often hear [...] "Do you <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> go to Anna with this?" [...] when they have differences with her subordinates. The Guardian has called her the [...] "unofficial mayoress" [...] of New York City. She has encouraged fashion houses such as Christian Dior to hire younger, fresher designers such as John Galliano. Her influence extends outside fashion. She persuaded Donald Trump to let Marc Jacobs use a ballroom at the Plaza Hotel for a show when Jacobs and his partner were short of cash. More recently, she persuaded Brooks Brothers to hire the relatively unknown Thom Browne. A protégée at Vogue, Plum Sykes, became a successful novelist, drawing her settings from New York's fashionable élite.|$|E
500|$|Once again, Patton {{found other}} {{commands}} given priority on gasoline and supplies. To obtain these, Third Army ordnance units passed themselves off as First Army personnel {{and in one}} incident they secured thousands of gallons of gasoline from a First Army dump. Between January 29 and March 22, the Third Army took Trier, Coblenz, Bingen, Worms, Mainz, Kaiserslautern, and Ludwigshafen, killing or wounding 99,000 and capturing 140,112 German soldiers, which represented {{virtually all of the}} remnants of the German First and Seventh Armies. An example of Patton's sarcastic wit was broadcast when he received orders to by-pass Trier, as it had been decided that four divisions would be needed to capture it. When the message arrived, Trier had already fallen. Patton rather caustically replied: [...] "Have taken Trier with two divisions. Do you <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> give it back?" ...|$|E
