25|$|The {{origins of}} the name Frensham come from 'Frena's ham'. Frena {{was the name of}} either a Danish Earl who was killed in the battle of Ashdown in the year 871, or of a Saxon who was driven south from Northumberland by the Danes in 993. The second part 'ham' means 'settlement', and is also from <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> the word 'home', so Frensham is 'Frena's settlement'.|$|E
500|$|As the band's primary lyricist, McIlrath is {{wary of the}} {{political}} label. [...] "In this sort of current climate of music, we stand out simply because I think there are bands that are avoiding the question. So, it makes us sort of an anomaly and I think that’s <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> the tag 'protest music' or 'political punk rock'". He also noted how the band's lyrics discuss social topics in general terms, instead of delving into the specifics. In a 2006 interview, McIlrath said: [...] "I {{think that a lot}} of the problems we deal with today in the world are the ones that have been plaguing society for centuries and probably will be here a hundred years from now...There's a bigger picture than just the Bush administration and specific problems of 2006, and I want people to relate to that, even if they're listening to [...] 10 years from now." [...] Principe noted the band does not try to preach their beliefs, but instead encourage listeners to become involved, and learn about pertinent issues affecting society.|$|E
500|$|Rouass was {{acquainted with}} the series, having viewed the first two series and [...] "dipped {{in and out of}} it." [...] She also stated that Maya is only a {{background}} character throughout the series, meaning her role is limited, and does not play a spy or becoming [...] "part of this mafia or that mafia." [...] Due to her limited appearance, the actress was available to perform other projects, including The Sarah Jane Adventures and Conan the Barbarian, as well as spending the free time with her daughter. Rouass does not participate in any stunt work, but does appear in [...] "a lot of passionate scenes." [...] Having gotten used to filming sex scenes in Footballers' Wives, Rouass noticed that while humour was involved in Footballers' Wives, Spooks was more passionate and very choreographed. In an interview with the Daily Mirror, Rouass recalled one of the scenes; [...] "there's one scene <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> together in the kitchen and the director was like, 'Come on, let's be honest, you haven't seen each other for years, you're not going to get all romantic, you're going to shag her on the table.'" ...|$|E

500|$|The episode [...] "T.A.H.I.T.I." [...] {{introduces}} the Kree alien {{race to the}} MCU, members of which {{play a significant role}} in Guardians of the Galaxy. This begins a storyline that recurs throughout the series, and introduces Inhumans to the MCU, with Jed Whedon saying that it was something [...] "in the works" [...] for a long time, as Marvel Studios had plans for an Inhumans film, and this would be [...] "one of the first instances <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> to start planting the seeds on the show before the film." [...] The third season {{introduces the}} concept of the Secret Warriors, with new Inhuman characters inspired by the comic of the same name, while also retconning the history of Hydra in the MCU, tying it into the Inhumans storyline. Gregg noted in January 2016 that the [...] "writer and director [...] will have free rein to do what they want to do with the Inhumans, but hopefully there'll be some way that our Inhumans connect to that." [...] When the film was removed from Marvel Studios' release schedule, Whedon noted that the series had [...] "a little more freedom" [...] and were [...] "able to do a little bit more" [...] with the species going into the fourth season, including the potential of introducing some of the [...] "classic" [...] Inhumans. Marvel's Inhumans, a television series centered on Black Bolt and other members of the Inhuman Royal Family, was announced in November 2016 to air on ABC in September 2017. It is not intended to be a spin-off of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.|$|E
500|$|A new league, the Canadian Hockey Association (CHA), {{was formed}} in late November 1909. One of the teams, the All-Montreal Hockey Club, hired Ross as a playing-manager, but the league only lasted to mid-January 1910 before disbanding. Ross, who scored four goals in four games in the CHA, then signed with the Haileybury Comets of the National Hockey Association (NHA), a league formed in December 1909, which {{proved to be the}} {{stronger}} replacement to the ECAHA as the highest level of hockey in Canada. He received $2,700 to play in the 1910 season, which lasted from January to March, playing twelve games for the team and finishing with six goals. Before the following season, the NHA imposed a salary cap of $5,000 per team. The players, including Ross, were unhappy as this would result in a pay decrease, and began looking to form their own league without a cap. Ross wrote to the Montreal Herald, stating [...] "all the players want is a fair deal ... The players are not trying to bulldoze the NHA, but we want to know <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> off at." [...] The plans were abandoned when they realized all the suitable arenas would be unavailable as they were owned or leased by the NHA. Ross scored four goals in eleven games with the Wanderers, who finished fourth in the five team league. During a match against the Quebec Bulldogs on February 25, 1911, Ross knocked out Eddie Oatman in a fight, provoking a massive brawl between the two teams, which the police had to break up. The fight helped to increase the reputation Ross had as a tough player unwilling to back down from any opponent. The following season Ross had eleven goals in nineteen games as the Wanderers improved to second in the league.|$|E

Information about the event under investigation may also be held back from the students in order to create dramatic tension, and only situations which will have a conclusive outcome are investigated. [...] "We may have information we don't give to [...] ", Gazzerro said, [...] "but {{we need to make sure}} [...] produceable." [...] Story arcs were also outlined for each [...] "character" [...] on the show, and the production team had publicly expressed its hope that a romantic relationship would develop between the research team leader Ryan Buell and one of the women on the series. The production team and the show's researchers say that no pressure was put on the research team to act in certain ways or make paranormal discoveries.|$|E

60|$|By degrees we {{have learned}} how to modify the action of these {{different}} substances, and to make them tell us what we want to know. And now, first of all, I take iron. It is a common thing in all chemical reactions, <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> any result of this kind, to find that it is increased by the action of heat; and if we want to examine minutely and carefully the action of bodies one upon another, we often have to refer to the action of heat. You are aware, I believe, that iron-filings burn beautifully in the air; but I am about to shew you an experiment of this kind, because it will impress upon you what I am going to say about iron in its action on water. If I take a flame and make it hollow;--you know why, because I want to get air to it and into it, and therefore I make it hollow--and then take a few iron-filings and drop them into the flame, you see how well they burn. That combustion results from the chemical action which is going on when we ignite those particles. And so we proceed to consider these different effects, and ascertain what iron will do when it meets with water. It will tell us the story so beautifully, so gradually and regularly, that I think it will please you very much.|$|E
