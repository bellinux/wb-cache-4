5|$|In Metal Gear Solid, Sniper Wolf is {{a member}} of FOXHOUND and an elite sniper capable of going <b>without</b> <b>food</b> and staying still for up to a week. She {{typically}} forms an emotional connection with her targets before killing them with her favoured weapon, the Heckler & Koch PSG1, and uses mercury-tipped hollow-point bullets to poison her victims.

5|$|On March 4, {{the autopsy}} {{indicated}} Barker had nothing in her system since some chocolate milk {{the morning of}} her disappearance, and had not eaten since she vanished. There was no indication of foul play; no signs of violence or sexual molestation. It was found she must {{have lived in the}} closet for three days <b>without</b> <b>food</b> or drink. An inspection of the closet showed marks from her attempt to escape.|$|E
5|$|Depending on {{the species}} {{and where it}} lives, the larva either conceals itself under leaves, debris or pieces of wood, hides in a crack or digs a funnel-shaped pit in loose material. As ambush predators, {{catching}} prey is risky because food arrives unpredictably and, for those species that make traps, maintaining one is costly; the larvae therefore have low metabolic rates and can survive for long periods <b>without</b> <b>food.</b> They can take several years to complete their life-cycle; they mature faster with plentiful food, but can survive for many months without feeding. In cooler climates they dig their way deeper and remain inactive during the winter.|$|E
60|$|He {{proceeded}} to talk--and as is inevitable, the war. Ah, the war--it {{was a terrible}} thing. He had become ill--very ill.

5|$|El Oriente resumed cargo {{service with}} the Morgan Line, and enjoyed a quiet career, {{typically}} sailing between New York and Galveston. One event of note occurred in February 1922 when El Oriente {{came upon the}} wreck of the schooner, Caldwell H. Colt, which had run aground on a reef near the Tortugas Light during a gale. When El Oriente came upon the hulk, only her captain remained alive, surviving <b>without</b> <b>food</b> or water for several days before his rescue. El Oriente continued on to Galveston and landed the man there.|$|E
5|$|In 1009 Symeon {{was sent}} into exile near Paloukiton, {{a small village}} near Chrysopolis on the Asiatic shore of the Bosphorus. According to one account, he was left by church {{authorities}} alone and <b>without</b> <b>food,</b> {{in the middle of}} winter. There he found a deserted and ruined chapel that had been dedicated to Saint Macrina. It happened to be on land owned by one of Symeon's spiritual children, Christopher Phagouras, who donated the land and proceeds to start a monastery.|$|E
5|$|The friars {{returned}} in 1619, arriving in October and staying for eighteen days. Again Kan Ek' welcomed {{them in a}} friendly manner, {{but this time the}} Maya priesthood were hostile and jealous of the missionaries' influence upon the king. They persuaded Kan Ek's wife to convince him to expel the unwelcome visitors. The missionaries' lodgings were surrounded by armed warriors, and the friars and their accompanying servants were escorted to a waiting canoe and instructed to leave and never return. Juan de Orbita attempted to resist and was rendered unconscious by an Itza warrior. The missionaries were expelled <b>without</b> <b>food</b> or water but survived the journey back to Mérida.|$|E

5|$|These events trouble Mac Da Thó greatly, {{such that}} he goes three days <b>without</b> <b>food,</b> drink or sleep. However, his wife devises {{for him a}} plan – that he should give the dog to both parties and let them fight for it. Pleased by this scheme, Mac Da Thó takes each {{delegation}} aside in private, and intimates to both that he had awarded the hound to them after much deliberation. Unknowingly, both parties agreed separately that their people should come {{on the same day}} to a feast in Leinster to claim Ailbe formally.|$|E
5|$|About 90% of beetle species enter {{a period}} of adult diapause, a quiet phase with reduced {{metabolism}} to tide unfavourable environmental conditions. Adult diapause {{is the most common}} form of diapause in Coleoptera. To endure the period <b>without</b> <b>food</b> (often lasting many months) adults prepare by accumulating reserves of lipids, glycogen, proteins and other substances needed for resistance to future hazardous changes of environmental conditions. This diapause is induced by signals heralding the arrival of the unfavourable season; usually the cue is photoperiodic. Short (decreasing) day length serves as a signal of approaching winter and induces winter diapause (hibernation). A study of hibernation in the Arctic beetle Pterostichus brevicorni showed that the body fat levels of adults were highest in autumn with the alimentary canal filled with food, but empty by the end of January. This loss of body fat was a gradual process, occurring in combination with dehydration.|$|E

5|$|Eliza Farnham's 1856 {{account of}} the Donner Party was based largely on an {{interview}} with Margaret Breen. Her version details the ordeals of the Graves and Breen families after James Reed and the second relief left them in the snow pit. According to Farnham, seven-year-old Mary Donner suggested to the others that they should eat Isaac Donner, Franklin Graves, Jr., and Elizabeth Graves, because the Donners had already begun eating the others at Alder Creek, including Mary's father Jacob. Margaret Breen insisted {{that she and her}} family did not cannibalize the dead, but Kristin Johnson, Ethan Rarick, and Joseph Kingwhose account is sympathetic to the Breen familydo not consider it credible that the Breens, who had been <b>without</b> <b>food</b> for nine days, {{would have been able to}} survive without eating human flesh. King suggests Farnham included this into her account independently of Margaret Breen.|$|E
5|$|Following Cortés' {{visit in}} 1525, no Spanish {{attempted}} {{to visit the}} warlike Itza inhabitants of Nojpetén for almost a hundred years. In 1618 two Franciscan friars set out from Mérida {{on a mission to}} attempt the peaceful conversion of the still pagan Itza in central Petén. Bartolomé de Fuensalida and Juan de Orbita were accompanied by some Christianised Maya. They were well received at Nojpetén by the current Kan Ek'. Attempts to convert the Itza failed, and the friars left Nojpetén on friendly terms with the Itza king.

They stayed for some days in an attempt to evangelise the Itza, but the Aj Kan Ek' refused to renounce his Maya religion, although he showed interest in the masses held by the Catholic missionaries.

5|$|In general, {{local governments}} {{assisted}} the affected storm victims by providing food, water, and clothing, even traveling by canoe to distribute aid. However, residents in Yuyao complained about insufficient assistance, {{as many people}} were <b>without</b> <b>food</b> or clean water for several days, due to ongoing flooding making distribution difficult. This sparked thousands of people to protest the government, although they dispersed after increased numbers of policemen. Residents were initially required to show food coupons to receive meals, but later anyone with a residence permit could receive the meals; however, the food distribution was disorganized, and {{there were reports of}} people looting for food. By October18, the flooding in Yuyao had subsided and roadways had reopened, and power service was gradually restored. Due to the extended disruptions to the city, garbage service was halted. Two people in Yuyao were arrested after spreading false rumors online that reservoir collapsed during the storm, killing 40people.|$|E

Joan Blondell's character in Big City Blues (1932) reflects that as a chorus girl she regularly received diamonds and pearls as gifts, but now must content herself with a corned beef sandwich.
