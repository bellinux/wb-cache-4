40|$|This work aims {{to study}} which {{level of detail}} should be {{preserved}} in the multi- body modelling of a racing car {{in order to obtain}} reliable results without excessive model com- plexity. Three multibody models have been developed and compared through optimal control simulations. The models differ from each other for the order of dynamics comprised: starting from a 14 degrees of freedom (dof) car which includes chassis and wheels motion, a 10 dof model model is obtained by neglecting the <b>wheels</b> <b>hop</b> dynamics, finally a 7 dof model is derived by completely eliminating the suspension motion. Optimal control problem simulations, including parametric analyses varying the center of mass position and suspensions stiffness, have been exe- cuted on a full lap on the International circuit of Adria. Simulations results show that the 10 dof model gives almost the same results of the 14 dof one, while significantly reducing the comput- ing time. On the contrary, the basic 7 dof model highlights remarkable differences in both the parametric analysis, suggesting the dynamics has been over-simplified...|$|R
5000|$|The Trough - The annual {{challenge}} {{consists of}} a simple course with two turns using the Toyota RAV4. Contestants will have 30 minutes {{to go through the}} course. Janis is repeatedly fed up with her mother's solicitation, and Shirley fails. Aaron passes on his last attempt before running out of time, again demanding silence from his father after being given bad advice in every previous run. Tab inches along in each run, but due to Matt's bad advice, Tab banishes him from the vehicle. She makes the first turn but fails the second turn as a result; and runs out of time. Afiya repeatedly falls off the course, and though she wants to quit after 20 minutes, she is convinced to go the entire 30 minutes. She fails on the last turn in her last attempt. Sly - in an ill-fatedattempt to [...] "gun it" [...] through the second turn - causes severe damage to the underside of the SUV, ripping out the exhaust manifold and puncturing the fuel line when the rear <b>wheel</b> <b>hops</b> the rails. Tearing a hole in the RAV4's gas line was considered to have been impossible by the show's vehicle maintenance crew, and the challenge is thus aborted.|$|R

50|$|Unlike most fully {{independent}} suspension {{there are no}} camber changes on axle loading and unloading (or rebound).

Been around here too much to do something like that, but learning for the fall and I’m really encouraged about how good our car came up through the pack and I really thought we had a car that could win.” Harvick and Kenseth swapped the lead on pit road and the latter exited with the lead.|$|R
5000|$|This type of clutch is {{designed}} to partially disengage or [...] "slip" [...] when the rear wheel tries to drive the engine faster than it would run under its own power. The engine braking forces in conventional clutches will normally be transmitted back along the drive chain causing the rear <b>wheel</b> to <b>hop,</b> chatter or lose traction. This is especially noted on larger displacement four-stroke engines, which have greater engine braking than their two-stroke or smaller displacement counterparts. Slipper clutches eliminate this extra loading on the rear suspension giving riders a more predictable ride and {{minimize the risk of}} over-revving the engine during downshifts. Slipper clutches can also prevent a catastrophic rear wheel lockup in case of engine seizure. Generally, the amount of force needed to disengage the clutch is adjustable to suit the application.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} global ρ-exponential stabilizability of nonholonomic Caplygin systems. A novel {{decomposition}} of state is given first. When systems are linear in certain state variables, {{a simple and}} easily verified rank condition can be proposed to guarantee the global ρ-exponential stabilizability of Caplygin systems. In our design, all parameters can be explicitly determined from the constraint function. Moreover, an interesting coordinate transformation {{can be used to}} change a Caplygin system into another one so that the proposed criterion can be applied to various situations. For an important class of Caplygin systems, the rank condition is further reduced to some conditions relating to the degree and non-zero property of the lowest polynomials of constraint function. Several interesting examples including of the knife-edge, the extended power-form, the rolling <b>wheel</b> and <b>hopping</b> robot systems are shown that they can be exponentially stabilized by an easy test...|$|R

40|$|Advances in GNC, {{particularly}} from miniaturized control electronics, reaction-wheels and attitude determination sensors {{make it possible}} to design surface probes and small robots to perform surface exploration and science on low-gravity environments. These robots would use their reaction <b>wheels</b> to roll, <b>hop</b> and tumble over rugged surfaces. These robots could provide 'Google Streetview' quality images of off-world surfaces and perform some unique science using penetrometers. These systems can be powered by high-efficiency fuel cells that operate at 60 - 65 % and utilize hydrogen and oxygen electrolyzed from water. However, one of the major challenges that prevent these probes and robots from performing long duration surface exploration and science is thermal design and control. In the inner solar system, during the day time, there is often enough solar-insolation to keep these robots warm and power these devices, but during eclipse the temperatures falls well below storage temperature. We have developed a thermal control system that utilizes chemicals to store and dispense heat when needed. The system takes waste products, such as water from these robots and transfers them to a thermochemical storage system. These thermochemical storage systems when mixed with water (a waste product from a PEM fuel cell) releases heat. Under eclipse, the heat from the thermochemical storage system is released to keep the probe warm enough to survive. In sunlight, solar photovoltaics are used to electrolyze the water and reheat the thermochemical storage system to release the water. Our research has showed thermochemical storage systems are a feasible solution for use on surface probes and robots for applications on the Moon, Mars and asteroids.

50|$|On {{a vehicle}} with {{longitudinal}} leaf springs, {{such as a}} Hotchkiss drive suspension, the springs themselves provide some longitudinal wheel control. One or more torque arms may be added to provide supplementary wheel control, particularly for vehicles with strong torque such as drag racers. On some leaf spring-equipped vehicles, such as 1960s Chrysler Corporation cars, the springs are mounted so that a lesser portion of the spring's length is forward of the wheels, improving wheel control on acceleration. A side effect of such positioning is that the longer, aft portion of the springs may not be stiff enough to control wheel movement under braking forces, {{which can lead to}} pronounced <b>wheel</b> <b>hop</b> in hard stops.|$|E
5000|$|An {{upgraded}} Ford E4OD {{automatic transmission}} {{was the only}} available transmission. An aluminum driveshaft connected it to 4.10:1 rear limited slip gears.

Special 17" [...] aluminum wheels with Firestone Firehawk tires, Lightning badging, a front air dam with fog lamps, a 120 mi/h km/h speedometer and a special intake manifold all differentiated the Lightning from normal F-150s.

5000|$|Forward {{acceleration}} anti-squat {{is calculated}} {{in a similar}} manner and with the same relationship between percentage and weight transfer. Anti-squat values of 100% and more are commonly used in drag racing, but values of 50% or less are more common in cars that have to undergo severe braking. Higher values of anti-squat commonly cause <b>wheel</b> <b>hop</b> during braking. It is important to note that, while the value of 100% means that all of the weight transfer is being carried through the suspension linkage. However, {{this does not mean that}} the suspension is incapable of carrying additional loads (aerodynamic, cornering, etc.) during an episode of braking or forward acceleration.

That being said it's not unbreakable in any configuration, especially with a fast spooling turbo to create a low end boost spike. The most common gear to break is third and commonly a boost ramp is tuned in to help save the stock transmission. The later the boost comes in generally the transmission will hold up better as it's not a sudden surge of power. <b>Wheel</b> <b>hop</b> is a killer of transmissions and axles creating excessive stress as the wheels load and unload.|$|E

50|$|A lower tie bar is an alloy/steel {{bar that}} ties the lower {{suspension}} pick-up points {{of a vehicle}} (with an independent suspension) together.

40|$|Abstract: A {{methodology}} {{is presented}} for optimizing the suspension damping and stiffness parameters of nonlinear quarter-car models subjected to random road excitation. The investigation starts with car models involving passive damping with constant or dual-rate characteristics. Then, we also examine car models where the damping coefficient of the suspension is selected {{so that the}} resulting system approximates the performance of an active suspension system with sky-hook damping. For the models with semi-active or passive dual-rate dampers, {{the value of the}} equivalent suspension damping coefficient {{is a function of the}} relative velocity of the sprung mass with respect to the wheel subsystem. As a consequence, the resulting equations of motion are strongly nonlinear. For these models, appropriate methodologies are first employed for obtaining the second moment characteristics of motions resulting from roads with a random profile. This information is next utilized in the definition of a vehicle performance index, which is optimized to yield representative numerical results for the most important suspension parameters. Special attention is paid to investigating the effect of road quality as well as on examining effects related to <b>wheel</b> <b>hop.</b> Finally, a critical comparison is performed between the results obtained for vehicles with passive linear or bilinear suspension dampers and those obtained for cars with semi-active shock absorbers.
