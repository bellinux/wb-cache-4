5|$|Bertrand Russell's pamphlet, <b>Why</b> <b>I</b> <b>Am</b> Not a Christian, {{based on}} a speech {{delivered}} in 1927 and later included in a book of the same title, is considered a classic statement of agnosticism.|$|E
5|$|From 1954 to 1959 Dawkins {{attended}} Oundle School in Northamptonshire, an English {{public school}} with a distinct Church of England flavour, where he was in Laundimer house. While at Oundle, Dawkins read Bertrand Russell's <b>Why</b> <b>I</b> <b>Am</b> Not a Christian for the first time. He studied zoology at Balliol College, Oxford, graduating in 1962; while there, he was tutored by Nobel Prize-winning ethologist Nikolaas Tinbergen. He continued as a research student under Tinbergen's supervision, receiving his MA and Doctor of Philosophy degrees by 1966, and remained a research assistant for another year. Tinbergen was {{a pioneer in the}} study of animal behaviour, particularly in the areas of instinct, learning and choice; Dawkins's research in this period concerned models of animal decision-making.|$|E

25|$|Russell's {{views on}} {{religion}} {{can be found}} in his book, <b>Why</b> <b>I</b> <b>Am</b> Not a Christian and Other Essays on Religion and Related Subjects. Its title essay was a talk given on 6 March 1927 at Battersea Town Hall, {{under the auspices of the}} South London Branch of the National Secular Society, UK, and published later that year as a pamphlet. The book also contains other essays in which Russell considers a number of logical arguments for the existence of God, including the first cause argument, the natural-law argument, the argument from design, and moral arguments. He also discusses specifics about Christian theology.|$|E
25|$|Brody's Jerusalemic {{association}} {{is not a}} sheer modern invention. The tradition ascribes this analogy to the emperor Joseph II, who visited Brody in 1774 and presumably said that Now, it is clear <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> designated to be Jerusalem king (one of the titles of Austrian emperors). Joseph's stay in Brody resulted in significant consequences. In 1778 he issues the decree that makes Brody a free town. This event quickly reflected on city development and life, marking a new era that lasted for 100 favourable years in all the respects. Yet in 1774 Joseph II freed Brody citizens from all the taxes under the condition of reconstruction of old houses and erecting of new ones. The market square got surrounded by new stone houses with undergrounds for storage purposes.|$|E

500|$|Lennon met Cynthia Powell (1939–2015) in 1957 {{when they}} were fellow {{students}} at the Liverpool College of Art. Although Powell was scared of Lennon's attitude and appearance, she heard that he was obsessed with the French actress Brigitte Bardot, so she dyed her hair blonde. Lennon asked her out, but {{when she said that}} she was engaged, he screamed out, [...] "I didn't ask you to fuckin' marry me, did I?" [...] She often accompanied him to Quarrymen gigs and travelled to Hamburg with McCartney's girlfriend to visit him. Lennon was jealous by nature and eventually grew possessive and often terrified Powell with his anger and physical violence. Lennon later said that until he met Ono, he had never questioned his chauvinistic attitude toward women. He said that the Beatles song Getting Better told his own story, [...] "I used to be cruel to my woman, and physically—any woman. I was a hitter. I couldn't express myself and I hit. I fought men and I hit women. That is <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> always on about peace." ...|$|E

500|$|Aguilera also {{supported}} Stripped by embarking {{on two different}} tours. In summer 2003, Justin Timberlake and Aguilera embarked on the Justified and Stripped Tour, {{which took place in}} North America. Talking about the tour, Timberlake revealed that [...] "She's got one of the most amazing voices I've ever heard. That homegirl can sing... this is <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> standing here". Several tour dates were cancelled and rescheduled due to the collapse of lightning systems. An extended play entitled Justin & Christina was released exclusively at Target Stores in July 2003 to promote the tour. The CD contains four remixes of Aguilera and Timberlake's songs from their two albums, and two new tracks. In late 2003, The Stripped Tour, the former's extension, happened without Timberlake's acts. The tour took place in Europe, Japan and Australia. The former grossed total US$30,261,670, becoming the sixteenth highest-grossing tour of 2003. In summer 2004, Aguilera was expected to return to North American during the second leg of the tour. However, the 29 tour dates were cancelled in the last minute due to the singer's vocal strain. On November 15, 2008, an accompanying video release of the tour, Stripped Live in the U.K., was released worldwide. On December 8, 2004, a compilation album which includes Stripped and the DVD was released in the United Kingdom.|$|E
500|$|On 18 February 1972 {{the state}} formed the Bangladesh Women's Rehabilitation Board, which was tasked with helping {{the victims of}} rape and {{to help with the}} {{adoption}} programme. Several international agencies took part in the adoption programme, such as Mother Teresa's Sisters of Charity. The majority of the war babies were adopted in the Netherlands and Canada as the state wished to remove the reminders of Pakistan from the newly formed nation. However, not all women wanted their child taken, and some were forcibly removed and sent for adoption, a practice which was encouraged by Rahman, who said, [...] "I do not want those polluted blood in this country". While many women were glad for the abortion programme, as {{they did not have to}} bear a child conceived of rape, others had to go full term, filled with hatred towards the child they carried. Others, who had their children adopted out so as to return to [...] "mainstream life", would not look at their newborn as it was taken from them. In the 1990s many of these children returned to Bangladesh to search for their birth mothers. In 2008, D'Costa attempted to find those who had been adopted, however very few responded, one who did said [...] "I hated being a kid, and I am angry at Bangladesh for not taking care of me when I needed it most. I don’t have any roots and that makes me cry. So that is <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> trying to learn more about where I was born." ...|$|E

5000|$|In January, it was {{revealed}} that Grevsmuhl had signed a 2-year contract with the Penrith Panthers starting in 2017.On 20 May, Grevsmuhl joined the Panthers mid-season after being released from the remainder of his Rabbitohs contract. He said that he was unwilling to play under Rabbitohs coach Michael Maguire any further. Grevsmuhl said, [...] "He’s a mind-game specialist. He breaks you down mentally.

500|$|In April 2007, the Prime Minister's {{annual salary}} {{increased}} to S$3.1 million (US$2.05 million), {{about five times}} that of the then President of the United States George W. Bush who earned US$400,000. The annual entry-level salary for ministers increased from $1.2 million to $1.6 million, and was projected to rise to 88% of the private sector benchmark by the end of 2008. Almost half of ministers' pay packages was made up of an individual performance bonus decided by the Prime Minister, and a variable bonus component based on the country's prevailing gross domestic product and capped at eight months of each minister's annual salary. The pay increases were justified by the Government {{on the grounds that the}} salaries had to keep pace with those in the private sector to attract the best talent and to avoid corruption. Teo Chee Hean, the Minister for Defence and minister in charge of the civil service, was reported as saying: [...] "We don't want pay to be the reason for people to join [...] But we also don't want pay to be the reason for them not to join us, or to leave after joining us." [...] The increases sparked much debate both in and out of Parliament, with many people seeing ministerial pay as already being too high. During a Parliamentary debate on the issue, Nominated Member of Parliament Thio Li-ann said: [...] "It would be a sad indictment of my generation if no one came forward to serve without excessive monetary inducement, as to be bereft of deep convictions is to be impoverished indeed." [...] On 11 April 2007, the Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong told Parliament: [...] "To make it quite clear <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> doing this, and also to give me the moral standing to defend this policy with Singaporeans, I will hold my own salary at the present level for five years. The government will pay me my full salary, because that is the way the system will have to work, but for five years, whatever the increase in the salary above its present level, I will donate to suitable good causes." [...] The following day, it was clarified that the Prime Minister had decided to do so a while ago, and that he had not been influenced by pressure arising from the announcement of the ministerial pay rise.|$|E
