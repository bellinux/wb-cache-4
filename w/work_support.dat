2500|$|Very {{little is}} known about the life of Fulgentius other than the few {{references}} he makes to himself in his own works. His style of Latin,his knowledge of Greek, and his view on classical authors and cults suggests that he was probably educated in colonial North Africa. Other references to African culture in his <b>work</b> <b>support</b> placing him in this region before the Muslim [...] invasions of the 7th century. Moreover, his apparent knowledge of the Libyco-Berber language and script indicates that he was probably an ethnic African: he refers to the language in his On the Ages of the World and of Man as being part of his 'own' heritage. Traditionally, Fulgentius is thought to have had a professional career as a grammaticus or rhetor (teacher of rhetoric). However, this belief is based on small incidental clues Fulgentius leaves behind in work and has been contested by some scholars. It remains possible that he was an amateur writer: in his prologue to Book 1 of the Mythologies, Fulgentius mentions a wife, though it is unclear whether this is a genuine autobiographical detail or part of his fictional persona in the story.|$|E

[...] The chiefs begin early morning by going their rounds for drink, and end business between 7 and 10 A.M. Everywhere on this coast a few hours of <b>work</b> <b>support</b> a [...] "gentleman;" [...] even the comparatively industrious and hard-working Egbas rarely do anything after noon. These lords and masters are fully aware that the white men are their willing slaves as long as the large profits last. If a glass of watered rum, which they detect more easily than we do watered milk, be offered to them, it will be thrown in the donor's face. Every factory must keep a barrel of spirits ready broached if the agents would buy eggs and yams, and the poorest negro comes regularly with his garrafa. The mixed stuff costs per bottle only a hundred reis (= fourpence), and thoroughly demoralizes the black world.|$|E

40|$|Welfare reform promised {{welfare mothers}} {{that if they}} went to work, they would receive the <b>work</b> <b>supports</b> and {{assistance}} necessary to help them find and keep employment. Congress has fulfilled some of that promise in that expenditures on <b>work</b> <b>supports</b> have increased since the early 1990 s. However, <b>work</b> <b>supports</b> are generally time-limited and phase-out quickly as income rises. This limits the ability of mothers to stay employed because most do not easily transition off government <b>work</b> <b>supports</b> into private-sector <b>work</b> <b>supports.</b> Because of time-limits and phase-outs, low-income and welfare mothers lose eligibility for Medicaid and other <b>work</b> <b>supports</b> as they move up the job ladder. Employer-provided health insurance is an option for those {{lucky enough to have}} found a job that provides it. However, few mothers make the transition from Medicaid to employer-provided health insurance. Between the beginning of 2002 and the end of 2003, 37. 2 percent of those on Medicaid left the program, but fewer than a quarter of those had employer-provided health insurance. The problem is not that Medicaid leavers lack employment, but that they do not find jobs offering employer-provided health insurance. Among those who left Medicaid in the late 1990 s, the share moving from a job without employer-provided health insurance to one with insuranc...|$|R
