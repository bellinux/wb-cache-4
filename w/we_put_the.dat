25|$|The {{long series}} of {{incidents}} connected with the Wailing Wall... These must {{be regarded as a}} whole, but the incident among them which in our view contributed most to the outbreak was the Jewish demonstration at the Wailing Wall on the 15th of August, 1929. Next in importance <b>we</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> activities of the Society for the Protection of the Moslem Holy Places and, in a lesser degree, of the Pro-Wailing Wall Committee.|$|E
25|$|I {{turned to}} Walter and said, “This movie is {{somewhat}} weirder than we thought.”... We just didn’t anticipate what {{the combination of}} elements was going to be. We had a very conscious design concept of the movie, but I think we didn’t fully grasp how strong it would be, {{in terms of the}} combination of elements. In a way, I think Streets of Fire was about expanding The Warriors concept to a bigger stage. But when expanding it to a bigger scale, it changed. The movie’s bigness of size—compositionally—changed the meaning of things and made it more of a fairy tale... The Warriors, it was bewoven with a unique sense of realism. The fact that they made a deal with real gangs to be extras in the film. There was a true Godardian dialectic going on between artifice and reality. It’s a very real-world film, in some respects, but it’s very artificial at the same time... We did that again, but <b>we</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> emphasis on the artifice. And we didn’t fully…I want to say we had too much integrity. We went further with that, perhaps, than we should have. I don’t know. I can’t put everything together about what didn’t work, but the most damaging thing is that we didn’t have the right actor for Tom Cody. Maybe if we’d had Tom Cruise, we might have had a success. But our commitment to be stylized was thorough and conscious and maybe too extreme for the mainstream audience.|$|E

[...] The two met in 1964 when they performed {{together in the}} Off-Broadway flop Hang Down Your Head and Die, and they began writing Hair together in late 1964. [...] The main characters were autobiographical, with Rado's Claude being a pensive romantic and Ragni's Berger an extrovert. [...] Their close relationship, including its volatility, {{was reflected in the}} musical. [...] Rado explained, [...] "We were great friends.

[...] "Steven even said, 'I think I made a mistake with a couple of things I asked you guys to try.'"

During {{a series of meetings}} early in April 1945, Caldwell proposed that the eight resign en masse, and the others agreed. Arthur later stated that, [...] "I meant to make as big a fuss as I possibly could with the object of getting the position corrected... All the same, we realised that, to lay ourselves open to any charge of mutiny, we might lessen the force of what we were doing, which was the reason <b>we</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> things in as resignations and not as any attempt to unseat people higher up." ...|$|E

500|$|For {{the guitar}} sound, the group tried to balance Grohl's [...] "playing the rhythm {{straight}} up the middle", Shiflett's [...] "sharp and clean sense of melodic playing", and Smear's more aggressive sound, with Grohl declaring that [...] "with three guitars, {{you have to}} be careful that it doesn't become a huge fucking mess. But when everybody's playing their thing really well, it sounds perfectly orchestrated." [...] Smear would usually play his parts on a baritone guitar, which would both contrast with Grohl and Shiflett and add a heavier sound - as Grohl declared, [...] "if we ever felt like a section wasn't heavy enough, <b>we</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> fuckin' baritone on it, and it became huge." [...] Hawkins added many buzz rolls to his drum fills at the suggestion of Vig, as buzz rolls were a trademark of one of the producer's favorite drummers, Ian Paice.|$|E
500|$|At Electric Lady, Badu {{applied a}} {{multifaceted}} approach to recording her vocals and opted against editing them in post-production. Using her voice impressionistically, her vocals {{were characterized by}} high scales, varied frequencies, wide intervals, and time-stretched harmonies. Chavarria, who engineered the vocals with Badu, remarked on her singing, [...] "Her voice has so many frequencies, from a subharmonic of her tonic to a thin raspiness, {{and she wants to}} hear all of that." [...] Badu used a Shure SM57 dynamic microphone, finding it to have enough bottom for her voice type, and cut vocal takes while situated between two speakers in the studio's control room with the monitor mix playing. She explained this setting to be more comfortable, noting the ability to hear herself sing and hold the microphone when moving around. Badu preferred to sing in one take rather than edit different takes together: [...] "When I do vocals, I am singing with a certain volume in my voice. I am singing the double and triple harmonies at different volumes. You don't have to adjust it; I have already done it. We mix as we go, so by the time <b>we</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> vocals to ½-inch tape, I know it. If you touch a damn thing, I will know it." ...|$|E

Then initially, Drake {{came up to me}} with the idea like 'Nah dog. That's your song. I'm not putting it on my album. So it's going to be a waste. So it's {{going to be a big}} record with no one to go retrieve it.' So <b>we</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> verse on there just to give me a little more presence on the record for it to be on my album." [...] In an interview with MTV News, Drake explained how the song came about, stating, [...] "It has this pocket, and there was no melody yet. I remember [...] kind of making the joint, and then he hit this sound, which is the chords that are in there. It was so eerie. Like it was haunting, almost. I was like, 'Yo, that's it. You need to use that.' He started playing this patch, and just every note that he played fell into place. I had this beat sitting here that I love so much, and I didn't know what to do with it..." ...|$|E

Big Boi was introduced to Yelawolf's music through his younger brother and invited him to record after seeing him perform. The track [...] "Follow Us" [...] features Vonnegutt, an act from Big Boi's Purple Ribbon label. He originally proposed a rock-influenced track for Yelawolf, but was persuaded by him to send the instrumental for [...] "You Ain't No DJ". According to Yelawolf, he [...] "wrote like 64 bars and turned in the huge verse", which was edited down to 16 and eight-bar parts of his original verse for the finished song. Big Boi also attempted unsuccessfully to collaborate with singer-songwriter Kate Bush, and managed to work with funk music pioneer George Clinton on [...] "Fo Yo Sorrows", an experience he related to [...] "Dorothy {{going to see the}} Wizard of Oz.
