25|$|Spencer {{was spotted}} by radio station Triple J's senior broadcaster, Helen Razer, at the 1996 Raw Comedy Finals, when he {{provided}} a live impromptu weather segment involving mathematical equations. This entertaining approach to presenting maths via the <b>weather</b> <b>has</b> been noted by other mathematicians.|$|E
25|$|The {{name is a}} {{whimsical}} reference to 19th-century economist William Stanley Jevons, who attempted to correlate business cycle patterns with sunspot counts (on the actual sun) {{on the grounds that}} they might cause variations in weather and thus agricultural output. Subsequent studies have found no evidence for the hypothesis that the sun influences the business cycle. On the other hand, sunny <b>weather</b> <b>has</b> a small but significant positive impact on stock returns, probably due to its impact on traders' moods.|$|E

25|$|The survey {{conducted}} in 2004 by the Embassy of Japan in Bangladesh {{found that a}} majority of the users of the bridge believe that the construction of the Meghna Bridge improved the life of the people living near it and the surrounding area of the bridge has been urbanized. The people surveyed opined that the number of traffic blockage caused by bad <b>weather</b> <b>has</b> been decreased since the construction. The survey also found that 42% of the trucks using Meghna Bridge transport goods between Dhaka and Chittagong.|$|E
25|$|This context, {{combined}} with bad <b>weather</b> <b>has</b> forced the operators in the sector to revise downwards their production target. Thus, {{the activity of}} mineral extraction has declined by 8% in volume year on year. The share of the nickel sector {{as a percentage of}} GDP fell 3%, to 5% in 2009 compared with 8% in 2008. A trend reversal and a recovery in demand, have been recorded early {{in the second half of}} 2009, allowing a 2.0% increase in the local metal production.|$|E
25|$|This was {{the first}} game in World Series history to be suspended. There had been three tied games {{in the history of}} the World Series: 1907, 1912, and 1922, all of them called due to darkness. In general, no ties would be needed under modern rules, which provide for {{suspension}} of a tied game and resumption of it at the next possible date. <b>Weather</b> <b>has</b> caused numerous delays and postponements in Series history (notable postponements beforehand coming in 1911, 1962, 1975, 1986, 1996 and 2006), but never any suspended games before 2008.|$|E

25|$|The creek's {{watershed}} {{was heavily}} urbanized after World War II, altering the runoff and discharge patterns. Increased runoff into Boeing Creek during rainy <b>weather</b> <b>has</b> caused more intense erosion and sediment transport, {{leading to the}} build-up of sediment in Hidden Lake. In the 1970s heavy rains flushed enough sediment down the creek to completely fill Hidden Lake, which became a meadow. Subsequently, King County Surface Water Division began efforts to control stormwater runoff in Boeing Creek's watershed. In 1996 dredging work restored Hidden Lake. On January 1, 1997, a winter storm created a large sinkhole which ruptured sewer lines on 175th Street, resulting in the Hidden Lake being filled with sediment again. The lake was dredged and restored again. The city of Shoreline budgets money for dredging Hidden Lake as needed and continues to seek a long-term solution {{to the problems of}} increased storm surge runoff, erosion, and sedimentation.|$|E

500|$|The {{association}} of the storm petrel with turbulent <b>weather</b> <b>has</b> led to its use {{as a metaphor for}} revolutionary views, the epithet [...] "stormy petrel" [...] being applied by various authors to characters as disparate as Roman tribune Publius Clodius Pulcher, a Presbyterian minister in the early Carolinas, an Afghan governor, or an Arkansas politician.|$|E
30|$|During {{weathering}} and leaching periods, weathering and leaching {{facilitate the}} formation {{of large numbers of}} dissolution pores in the surface and upper sections of volcanic rocks, which may connect primary reservoir spaces and enhance reservoir properties in volcanic rocks significantly. Core analysis data show that the Carboniferous basalts in the Ludong area of the Junggar Basin without <b>weathering</b> <b>have</b> an average original porosity of 7.6  %, basalts with weak <b>weathering</b> <b>have</b> an average porosity of 8.7  % and basalts with strong <b>weathering</b> <b>have</b> an average porosity of 15.3  %. Therefore, {{it can be seen that}} weathering and leaching are the major forces for {{the formation of}} secondary pores in this area.|$|R

500|$|<b>Weather</b> <b>has</b> {{played a}} large and {{sometimes}} direct part in human history. Aside from climatic changes that have caused the gradual drift of populations (for example the desertification of the Middle East, {{and the formation of}} land bridges during glacial periods), extreme weather events have caused smaller scale population movements and intruded directly in historical events. One such event is the saving of Japan from invasion by the Mongol fleet of Kublai Khan by the Kamikaze winds in 1281. [...] French claims to Florida came to an end in 1565 when a hurricane destroyed the French fleet, allowing Spain to conquer Fort Caroline. [...] More recently, Hurricane Katrina redistributed over one million people from the central Gulf coast elsewhere across the United States, becoming the largest diaspora {{in the history of the}} United States.|$|E

2500|$|Bad <b>weather</b> <b>has</b> often hit the Ronde. In 1985, a storm {{broke in}} the second half of the race. The weather was so bad that only 24 made it to the finish. The race historian, Rik Vanwalleghem, said: [...] "It was a legendary Ronde, one which wrote Sport with a capital S. It was as cold as Siberia all day and the rain fell in torrents (regende het pijpenstelen) [...] In this apocalyptic {{background}} Eric Vanderaerden got back to the front after looking beaten to ride 20km at the head of the race alone. Impressive." ...|$|E
2500|$|In [...] "Fog of War," [...] {{two days}} after a massacre, {{mechanic}} and explosives expert Raven discovers Mount <b>Weather</b> <b>has</b> jammed communications, preventing them from reaching out to other potential survivors from the Ark (a ship that held descendants of humans who survived the nuclear apocalypse 97 years before). The survivors become known as Sky People to the Grounders (descendants of humans on Earth who survived the nuclear apocalypse). After a group of survivors find the communications tower, {{they are forced to}} split and take shelter from an acid fog. Clarke, a teenager who has taken on a leader role for her camp, realizes she no longer recognizes Finn, her one-time lover. Jaha and Kane, two former leaders of the Ark, are told that one of them must kill the other to have even a chance at speaking with the commander of the Grounders. Kane attempts to take his own life rather than kill Jaha, but a Grounder witness, Lexa, reveals herself to be the commander and says she believes their wish for peace is sincere. She allows Jaha to escape with a message to his camp: leave within two days, or die.|$|E

2500|$|The {{carbon dioxide}} {{equivalent}} of greenhouse gases (GHG) in the atmosphere has already exceeded 400 parts per million (NOAA) (with total [...] "long-term" [...] GHG exceeding 455 parts per million) (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Report). This level is considered a tipping point. [...] "The amount of greenhouse gas in the atmosphere is already above the threshold that can potentially cause dangerous climate change. We are already at risk of many areas of pollution...It's not next year or next decade, it's now." [...] The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) has stated [...] "Climate change {{is not just a}} distant future threat. It is the main driver behind rising humanitarian needs and we are seeing its impact. The number of people affected and the damages inflicted by extreme <b>weather</b> <b>has</b> been unprecedented." [...] Further, OCHA has stated:Climate disasters are on the rise. Around 70 percent of disasters are now climate related – up from around 50 percent from two decades ago. These disasters take a heavier human toll and come with a higher price tag. In the last decade, 2.4 billion people were affected by climate related disasters, compared to 1.7 billion in the previous decade. The cost of responding to disasters has risen tenfold between 1992 and 2008.Destructive sudden heavy rains, intense tropical storms, repeated flooding and droughts are likely to increase, as will the vulnerability of local communities in the absence of strong concerted action.Environment destruction caused by humans is a global problem, and this is a problem that is on going every day. By year 2050, the global human population is expected to grow by 2 billion people, thereby reaching a level of 9.6 billion people (Living Blue Planet 24). The human effects on Earth can be seen in many different ways. A main one is the temperature rise, and according to the report ”Our Changing Climate”, the global warming that {{has been going on for}} the past 50 years is primarily due to human activities (Walsh, et al. 20). Since 1895, the U.S. average temperature has increased from 1.3°F to 1.9°F, with most of the increase taken place since around year 1970 (Walsh, et al. 20).|$|E
