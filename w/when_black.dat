5|$|Millennium Group {{consultant}} Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) and Seattle Police Department detective Bob Bletcher (Bill Smitrovich) are hiking {{across the}} North Cascades <b>when</b> <b>Black</b> receives an urgent {{page from the}} Federal Bureau of Investigation. Travelling to the Behavioral Sciences Unit, Black learns that serial killer Ephraim Fabricant (Alex Diakun) has escaped from a hospital while donating a kidney to his sister. Fabricant was arrested and convicted due to the profile constructed by Black; although he was spared execution <b>when</b> <b>Black</b> asked for leniency {{in order to allow}} Fabricant's mind to be studied.|$|E
5|$|Lieutenant Robert Bletcher (Bill Smitrovich) is {{a detective}} with the Seattle Police Department's {{homicide}} division. Bletcher {{had worked with}} Black during Black's law-enforcement career, and becomes his liaison with the police <b>when</b> <b>Black</b> returns to Seattle.

5|$|Millennium Group {{consultant}} Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) {{runs out}} to a supermarket parking lot where he witnesses a lawyer, Alistair Pepper (Richard Cox), being confronted {{by a man named}} Sammael (Rodney Eastman). Sammael raises his hand, and a bolt of lightning arcs from his fingers to strike Pepper dead; however, <b>when</b> <b>Black</b> reaches Sammael, he finds a pistol at the killer's feet.|$|E

5000|$|The Felbecker Gambit, 3...Bc5, usually {{followed}} by ...f6, is a variant on the Soller Gambit approach, <b>when</b> again <b>Black</b> may get partial compensation in such lines as 4.Nc3 f6 5.exf6 Nxf6 6.Bg5 d6 7.e3 h6, but 4.e4 is also critical, <b>when</b> <b>Black's</b> best is 4...Qe7 as 4...f6 5.Bc4! gives White a large advantage.|$|R

5|$|Millennium Group member Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) joins {{his brother}} Tom (Philip Anglim) and {{sister-in-law}} Helen (Liz Bryson) for their newborn son's christening. After {{the child is}} baptized, Black joins his daughter Jordan (Brittany Tiplady), finding her in hysterics. She claims to have seen a man hurting Helen; <b>when</b> <b>Black</b> and his brother rush outside, they find {{the baby in the}} back of Tom's car, but Helen is gone.|$|E
5|$|Millennium {{centers on}} {{offender}} profiler Frank Black (Lance Henriksen), who investigates unusual crimes {{as part of}} the private investigative organisation the Millennium Group. In this episode, <b>when</b> <b>Black</b> investigates several killings by a pack of savage dogs, he discovers a strange old man who teaches him more than he ever knew about the Group.|$|E
5|$|Aflaq {{moved to}} Baghdad {{following}} his reelection to the Secretary Generalship in February 1968. He stayed there until 1970, <b>when</b> <b>Black</b> September happened, he criticised the Ba'ath leadership of doing {{too little to}} help the Palestine Liberation Organisation during the conflict. During the conflict, Aflaq lobbied extensively for Yasser Arafat and the PLO. Aflaq wanted Iraqi intervention; al-Bakr, however, refused to get Iraq involved in such a conflict. Because of this, Aflaq returned to Lebanon in self-imposed exile. The government of Hafez al-Assad, the President of Syria, condemned Aflaq to death in absentia in 1971.|$|E
5000|$|... "Justice-based" [...] {{civil disobedience}} {{occurs when a}} citizen disobeys laws in order to lay claim to some right denied to her or him, as <b>when</b> <b>blacks</b> {{illegally}} protested during the Civil Rights Movement.|$|R
50|$|A quieter {{option for}} White is 4.d3, <b>when</b> <b>Black's</b> main options are 4...Bc5, {{transposing}} into the Giuoco Pianissimo and the solid 4...Be7, {{which is likely}} to lead to similar positions to the Bishop's Opening.|$|R
50|$|Members of the {{community}} can trace their ancestral roots back to over 200 years, <b>when</b> <b>blacks</b> first came to Nova Scotia as Black Loyalists, who joined British colonial forces during the American Revolutionary War.|$|R
5|$|Ben Ammi Ben-Israel {{established}} the African Hebrew Israelites of Jerusalem in Chicago, Illinois, in 1966, {{at a time}} <b>when</b> <b>black</b> nationalism was on the rise {{as a response to}} the Civil Rights Movement. In 1969, after a sojourn in Liberia, Ben Ammi and about 30 Hebrew Israelites moved to Israel. Over the next 20 years, nearly 600 more members left the United States for Israel. As of 2006, about 2,500 Hebrew Israelites live in Dimona and two other towns in the Negev region of Israel, where they are widely referred to as Black Hebrews. In addition, there are Hebrew Israelite communities in several major American cities, including Chicago, St. Louis, and Washington, D.C.|$|E
5|$|Emma's ghost {{appears to}} Craven {{and tells him}} of a time <b>when</b> <b>black</b> flowers grew, warming the Earth and {{preventing}} life from becoming extinct. She tells him that the black flowers have returned and will melt the polar icecaps, destroying mankind so that life can continue. Craven goes to dissuade Jedburgh from {{the next step in}} his plan, which is to cause a nuclear explosion in Scotland {{with the rest of the}} plutonium. He succeeds, though the secret service follow him and kill Jedburgh. Craven, like Jedburgh and Grogan fatally exposed to radiation, wanders into the mountains to die, calling Emma's name. On the mountains, as Emma predicted, the black flowers are growing, foreshadowing the planet's war against humanity.|$|E
5|$|On August 12, 1937, Roosevelt {{nominated}} Black to {{fill the}} vacancy. By tradition, a senator nominated for an executive or judicial office was confirmed immediately and without debate. However, <b>when</b> <b>Black</b> was nominated, the Senate departed from this tradition {{for the first time}} since 1853; instead of confirming him immediately, it referred the nomination to the Judiciary Committee. Black was criticized for his presumed bigotry, his cultural roots, and his Klan membership, when that became public.|$|E

5000|$|Two {{primary schools}} at Chatsworth (Chatsworth and Gert Nel). Chatsworth {{is too small}} to have two schools, they were built during the time <b>when</b> <b>blacks</b> and whites were not allowed to mix in schools. Now the two schools serve the new farmers settled round the growth point.|$|R
5000|$|A foul on the <b>black,</b> <b>when</b> the <b>black</b> is {{the only}} ball left. It is {{sometimes}} wrongly assumed that play continues after a foul on the black if there are fewer than seven points between the scores. This is not the case: the player {{who is in the}} lead following the assessment of a penalty after a foul <b>when</b> only the <b>black</b> remains is the winner.|$|R
5|$|The administration's {{response}} to racial violence was minimal, {{causing him to}} lose black support. <b>When</b> <b>black</b> postmasters at Hogansville, Georgia in 1897, and at Lake City, South Carolina the following year, were assaulted, McKinley issued no statement of condemnation. Although black leaders criticized McKinley for inaction, supporters responded by saying there was little the president could do to intervene. Critics replied by saying that he could at least publicly condemn such events, as Harrison had done.|$|E
5|$|Twelve years later, Millennium Group member Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) is {{visited by}} a retired Federal Bureau of Investigation agent, Richard Gilbert (Glenn Morshower). Gilbert hopes to headhunt Black {{for his new}} private {{security}} firm, The Trust. Their meeting abruptly ends <b>when</b> <b>Black</b> receives word that his father has died. At the funeral, Black explains the notion of death to his young daughter; later that day, he unsuccessfully tries to contact fellow Group member Lara Means (Kristen Cloke), {{with whom he has}} lost contact.|$|E
5|$|<b>When</b> <b>Black</b> {{leaves to}} meet with the girls in custody, he finds that the bus driver was another of the man in the ventilator's offspring, and has escaped with the clones; Hoffman has also disappeared. Black realizes that the {{building}} they found the girls in is located in an area of extreme geological stability, and is built on shock absorbing foundations—Black does not know where the cult has escaped to, but he does know where they will be on May 5, 2000.|$|E
5|$|<b>When</b> <b>Black's</b> car is searched, it {{is clear}} it was never rigged with anything—Dees had planned the whole thing, knowing {{that he would be}} killed.

50|$|Steinitz's 4...Qh4!? almost wins a pawn by force, but White gets a lead in {{development}} and attacking chances as compensation. As of 2005, White's most successful {{line has been}} 5.Nc3 Bb4 6.Be2 Qxe4 7.Nb5 Bxc3+ 8.bxc3 Kd8 9.0-0, <b>when</b> <b>Black's</b> awkwardly placed king has generally proven more significant than his extra pawn.|$|R

5|$|A {{few other}} {{lines have been}} tried, with the outcome varying from an {{immediate}} equality to a clear advantage for Black. The cooling 4.e6 avoids complications and heads for an equal endgame with 4...dxe6 5.Qxd8+ Kxd8, Black's loss {{of the right to}} castle being of no great importance since queens have been traded. If Black wants to avoid this early endgame, he can try 4...Bb4+ 5.Nc3 Bxc3+ 6.bxc3 dxe6 and now the exchange of queens would give a plus to Black, as the white queenside pawns are isolated and doubled. The greedy 4.f4 is weak because White neglects his development and weakens the a7–g1 diagonal. Black can immediately exploit this with 4...Bc5, which threatens a fork on f2 and forbids White's castling; Black may later push d7–d6 to open the centre, e.g. 5.Nh3 0-0 6.Nc3 d6 7.exd6 cxd6 <b>when</b> <b>Black</b> has good squares for its pieces while White's castling is delayed.|$|E
5|$|After {{production}} concluded on Harlem Nights, Bakshi {{wanted to}} distinguish himself artistically by producing a film in which live action and animated characters would interact. Bakshi began writing the screenplay for Hey Good Lookin while editing Coonskin, and storyboarding a proposed series for ABC. The characters of Vinnie and Crazy Shapiro were based upon Bakshi's high school friends, Norman Darrer and Allen Schechterman. }} Warner Bros. had previously agreed to distribute Fritz the Cat before pulling their funding from that film, but {{were eager to}} option the screenplay for Hey Good Lookin, and greenlit the film in 1973. Several African American animators, including graffiti artists, were hired by Bakshi's studio, at a time <b>when</b> <b>black</b> animators were not widely employed by major animation studios. Following controversy over the film Coonskin, some black animators left Bakshi's studio in embarrassment, resulting in production problems for Hey Good Lookin.|$|E
5|$|Black Swan is a 2010 {{independent}} psychological thriller film {{directed by}} Darren Aronofsky. It premiered as the opening film for the 67th Venice International Film Festival.

50|$|The {{settlement}} began c.1860 <b>when</b> <b>blacks</b> {{who came}} to BC from the United States settled there. One account of the name says it was their singing which inspired the name, another says {{it was one of}} them, Isaac Mull, who conferred it because of his happiness at becoming a free man under British rule.|$|R
2500|$|Born {{the son of}} an (ex-)slave {{overseer}} in 1889 {{somewhere near}} Richmond, Virginia, Featherston grows up in a poor household and joined the CS Army at a young age.

5|$|Later, Black is {{informed}} that the girls are missing. She and Means search the woods, finding the girls in a grotto. They are with a teacher from the school, Ben Fisher (John Pyper-Ferguson) who attacks Means; she subdues him and he is arrested. She later confronts him, and it is revealed {{he is a former}} Group member charged with protecting the girls due to their powers. <b>When</b> <b>Black</b> later learns that Fisher has been released, she fears for McKenna's life. She rushes to the school, knowing the girls will be at a prayer meeting. She arrives just too late to prevent Alex from firing upon the meeting; Fisher is killed while shielding McKenna. Later, Means shows Black two sets of DNA test results—one from McKenna, the other from the Shroud of Turin. The profiles seem to prove that McKenna is related to Jesus Christ; Means entrusts them, and the decision as to whether to proliferate them, to Black.|$|E
5|$|Mephisto and Averno {{defeated}} Atlantis and Blue Panther for the CMLL World Tag Team Championship in {{a heated}} match on April 2, 2005. The team would defend the tag team titles several times {{over the next year}} in some very well received matches that led to several reporters labeling them {{as one of the best}} Mexican tag teams in the 21st century. Their most prominent defense was on the last Arena México show of 2005 when they defeated El Hijo del Santo and Negro Casas in the main event. In early 2006, they defended their titles against Místico and Black Warrior twice. In the first match, they won by disqualification <b>when</b> <b>Black</b> Warrior interfered in the match after being pinned. In the second match two weeks later, Black Warrior turned on Místico, starting a long-running storyline between the two. On April 14, 2006, they lost the tag team championship to the team of Místico and Negro Casas, ending their year-long reign.|$|E
5|$|The {{dead man}} is autopsied; his corpse had been dismembered and reconstructed. Michaels notes {{that this is}} a Seneca ritual aimed at {{reviving}} the dead to learn of spiritual matters. Later, Black and Michaels are called the construction site, where Powell is attempting to package and remove the ancient remains. Reynard and Powell begin fighting; the latter soon dies of a heart attack. <b>When</b> <b>Black</b> returns to his car, he finds a native face mask placed inside; Michaels explains that it represents the ability to cross from the material world into the spirit world. Black believes a secret native tribe is awaiting the downfall and apocalypse of the society of the white settlers; he theorizes that they believe his abilities are key to their prophecies {{of the end of the}} world.|$|E
