40|$|Phosphorus {{depletion}} is {{an emerging}} and serious global environmental issue. At this moment, {{research and policy}} discussion on phosphorus scarcity is still limited. This research investigates the possibilities of phosphorus recovery by controlled precipitation of struvite from digested sludge. At <b>Waternet’s</b> wastewater treatment plant Amsterdam West, plans for a struvite reactor are scheduled. The advantage of phosphorous recovery through struvite precipitation from digested sludge is three-fold. First, struvite can be directly used as fertilizer. Second, undesirable struvite precipitation in the wastewater treatment plant is prevented by reducing the phosphorus concentration in the dewatering reject stream which is fed back to the inlet of the treatment plant. Third, sludge dewaterability improves due to the addition of MgCl 2. This thesis investigates the influence of mixing speed, aeration rate, magnesium dosing method and crystal recycle method on struvite growth and phosphorus removal, as well as separation of struvite from sludge. For that purpose, experiments have been performed in a crystallization reactor and a counter-current washing column at lab scale at wastewater treatment plant Amsterdam West. MgCl 2 was added under varying reactor conditions, struvite constituent concentrations were measured and struvite growth was assessed. First, it is demonstrated that struvite recovery is well possible in a stirred sludge environment at neutral pH commonly applied in sludge digesters (7. 0 - 7. 1). Phosphorous removal under these circumstances is at least 85 %. More complete mixing by stirring at a higher speed further improves struvite recovery by keeping supersaturation low. Secondly, {{a significant difference in}} struvite recovery was observed between experiments in which MgCl 2 is dosed instantly versus experiments in which MgCl 2 is dosed gradually. Gradual MgCl 2 dosage, and therefore rapid mixing, improves recovery compared to instant dosage. Mixing at a higher stirring speed further improves recovery. Thirdly, it is found that struvite recovery under given circumstances is poor in a combined aerated and stirred sludge environment. In such environment higher aeration rates deteriorate struvite recovery further, while struvite recovery improves with decreasing aeration rates at a higher stirring speed. Fourthly, struvite separation experiments have verified that separation is well possible in a counter-current washing set-up, separating 86 % of detectable struvite within 15 minutes at an upflow velocity of 1. 3 mm/s.

40|$|In the Netherlands 1. 2 billion {{cubic meters}} of {{drinking}} water are produced each year, which uses about 480 GWh of electricity per year as an energy intensive industrial process. While there are some examples of renewable based microgrids {{around the world that}} illustrate the benefits of producing and consuming renewable electricity onsite, there has been little research on the potential of a renewable-based hybrid system at a much larger scale and in a Dutch context where wind speeds are higher, solar irradiation more moderate, and where subsidy schemes for renewable energy investment exist. Thus, this research aimed to identify the technical and economic potentials of integrating solar photovoltaic (PV) and wind power with demand response into a grid-connected versus stand-alone microgrid at a Dutch drink water treatment plant. It also aimed to investigate the economic implications for flexible demand in the water pumping process with demand response (DR) and the extent of reliance on grid-imports, storage, and back up generation. Lastly, it aimed to evaluate the economic potential of the microgrid system in 5 years if investment costs would further decrease. Method. <b>Waternet’s</b> drink water treatment plant in Nieuwegein (DWP-NWG) was used as a case study to model a microgrid integrating solar PV and wind power with demand response by researching its electricity demand, the production potential for renewable electricity (RE) supply, and the flexible demand potential in the pumping process. These were then used as inputs to model a variety of grid-connected and stand-alone microgrid cases using HOMER modelling software under the current financial support scheme and in 2018. The main technical potentials were evaluated based on renewable electricity production potential, fraction of onsite electricity demand supply for renewable electricity, reliance on grid imports, back up diesel production, and storage throughput. Economic potentials were evaluated based on the system’s levelized cost of electricity (COE), net present value (NPV), and discounted payback period (PBP). Results. The DWP-NWG has the potential to supply 70 - 96 % of its annual electricity demand with 17. 8 - 25. 6 GWh/year of locally produced solar PV and wind power combined with demand response. The most profitable system configuration is a 5. 6 MWp Solar PV – 8 MW wind (4 turbines) combined with demand response, yet without storage. This microgrid system can be 88 % self-sufficient on renewable electricity, with a COE of 0. 020 €/kWh versus 0. 082 €/kWh for the current situation without renewables, an NPV of € 12. 7 million, and a payback period of 7. 3 years. The least cost stand-alone system is a 5. 6 MWp solar PV – 8 MW wind – 1. 3 MW diesel generation – 2 MW cell stack/ 45 MWh electrolyte flow battery storage with demand response, which has a COE of 0. 094 €/kWh and an NPV of €- 7 million. If electricity prices rise, grid-connected potentials increase by 16 - 55 %. •	Demand response: Comparing a 4 wind turbine system with demand response to one without demand response, the former has an NPV of € 11. 8 million and the latter € 11. 2 million. This shows that demand response adds about € 600, 000 of value over a 25 year project lifetime. Annually, shifting 29 % of normal annual demand to be supplied during renewable electricity production earns an additional € 59, 000 per year in avoided transport and energy taxes. Larger capacity microgrid systems, which can pump slightly more water above normal demand from the excess RE produced, earn up to € 71, 000 per year. The maximum capacity RE system with DR and without batteries can utilize 12 % of the additional flexibility provided by the water storage buffer at the Dunes; however, in order to utilize the maximum 15 % flexibility from the buffer at the Dunes, adding battery storage is required in order to defer the use of excess electricity when the strongest pumps are not being used. This is due to the limitations of the current pump installations and transport network which prevent significantly more water to be pumped in one time step. •	Grid imports, back up generation, storage: Even at these high potentials, both grid-connected and stand-alone cases still rely on 1 - 4. 5 GWh of electricity per year imported from the grid in grid-connected cases or supplied by back-up diesel generators in stand-alone microgrid cases. This is due to the intermittency of solar PV and wind power production. Grid-connected microgrids don’t necessarily need storage, yet stand-alone microgrid cases require 2. 2 - 3. 2 GWh of annual storage throughput. •	 2018 Potentials: If investment costs further decrease and no tax incentives of subsidies exist for RE, the most profitable microgrid case configurations remains the 5. 6 MWP solar PV – 8 MW wind (4 turbines) – DR without battery storage configuration with a COE of 0. 030 €/kWh, an NPV of € 10. 7 million, and a discounted PBP of 11 years. The least cost stand-alone microgrid has a COE of 0. 118 €/kWh, and an NPV of €- 11 million. If the EIA & SDE+ financial support is still available in 5 years, NPV potentials are 40 % higher. Conclusion/Discussion: The technical results show that a significant portion of electricity demand of an industrial sized water treatment plant can be met with a few wind turbines and large PV capacity. They also confirm that a solar-wind combination is optimal over a wind-only configuration. The economic results indicate that stand alone microgrids are not cost-effective, while grid-connected microgrids are very profitable. This is because directly consuming renewable electricity onsite avoids the majority of electricity costs, sell-back of excess electricity is possible, and because the impact of investment costs has decreased since the SDE+ subsidy decreases wind investment costs by at least 50 % and solar PV investment costs have drastically dropped by over 40 % over the last year. Moreover, based on the sensitivity analysis of electricity prices, the profitability of these systems is even underestimated if electricity prices rise in the future. The results also indicate that while the technical potential to shift electricity demand with demand response is significant, the economic advantages are relatively small since the margin between buy-in and sell-back electricity prices is marginal for wholesale electricity consumers. Nonetheless, the investment for demand response could be paid back in less than 2 years and will become more profitable as electricity prices rise and sell-back rates decrease. Moreover, a 100 % renewable system would require extremely large battery storage, which is not currently cost effective. Ultimately, even at the low wholesale electricity and sell-back price for large industrial electricity consumers, grid-connection and the ability to trade excess electricity is extremely important for the cost-effectiveness of microgrid system. Lastly, although PV costs have already dropped significantly making the current economic potentials from grid-connected solar-wind microgrid configurations very high, waiting to invest within 5 years can be even more profitable as long as the EIA and SDE+ support remain...|$|R

40|$|Moving from grey {{energy to}} green energy {{presents}} citizens {{the opportunity to}} participate in the energy production process. They can do so by investing in green energy production installations. Although citizens can decide to individually invest in these installations, organisations may invite citizens to collaborate in a local green energy project. If an organisation starts a green energy project and invites citizens this project contains citizen participation. The success of these projects is highly dependent on the ‘willingness to participate’ of citizens. Although scientific research into willingness to participate has been conducted, a knowledge gap exists. The aspects that increase (drivers) and decrease (barriers) citizens’ willingness to participate have never been researched in one project. Instead, in all studies a small number of drivers and barriers were researched in different projects, which makes it difficult to compare their impact. This research aims to help fill this gap, by researching the drivers and barriers in one case study. This is the citizen participation solar panel project which <b>Waternet</b> currently develops. The knowledge gap in scientific research is also a knowledge gap for <b>Waternet,</b> as they do not know how willing citizens will be to participate in their project. Next to filling the scientific knowledge gap, this research therefore also aims to analyse the influence of these drivers and barriers in Waternet’s project and present recommendations based on this. It thereby helps <b>Waternet</b> to create a successful project. The central research question of this thesis is the following: “Under which conditions can citizens be expected to be willing to participate in business initiated local solar panel projects, such as the project of Waternet?”	 A total of 28 drivers and 21 barriers which potentially influence citizens’ willingness to participate was identified in this research, based on scientific literature, a pilot project of <b>Waternet</b> and reasoning. After testing these drivers and barriers in a survey it was found that only 14 drivers and 5 barriers influence citizens’ willingness to participate in local solar panel projects in practice. It is clear <b>Waternet</b> should not expect a high willingness to participate. <b>Waternet</b> only uses two drivers in practice in the project as it is currently planned, and no barriers in practice are tackled. However, most can (partly) be used or tackled by <b>Waternet</b> in their project. By incorporating the drivers and barriers citizens’ willingness to participate will increase, making it more likely this project becomes successful...|$|E

To become climate neutral, <b>Waternet</b> will need to achieve a reduction of GHG-emissions of approximately 97. 2 kton/year. Setting this goal puts them {{at the forefront of}} public utilities moving towards more sustainable practices. In order to reach the ambitions, a mitigation policy plan up to 2020 will be devised. The aim of this research was to explore mitigation measures for GHG-emission reduction. The main focus of mitigation measures is on the Amsterdam watercycle, since it offers much potential for innovative GHG mitigation, such as thermal energy, chemical energy and resource recovery. Out of twenty-six available measures, four reduction measures and six compensation measures were evaluated. By means of a multi-criteria analysis and marginal abatement cost curves, insights were gained on climate impact, cost-effectiveness, service delivery, and Waternet’s influence and autonomy in realization of the mitigation measures. Of the evaluated measures, wind energy production and shower water heat recovery have the highest potential for the reduction of GHG-emissions, respectively 37. 3 kton/yr and 28. 7 kton/yr. The total package of ten mitigation options could lead to a GHG-emission reduction of 88. 1 kton/yr. The remaining 9. 1 kton/year can be compensated by other watercycle reduction and compensation measures which requires further research, or by the purchase of green electricity and/or carbon credits. In conclusion, <b>Waternet</b> can achieve its goal of climate neutrality in 2020 by implementing the package of researched mitigation measures with a minimal procurement of carbon credits and/or green electricity...|$|E

40|$|In {{the area}} that is managed by the {{waterboard}} Amstel, Gooi and Vecht, some deep polders are located. Most of them attract large amounts of brackish seepage. This seepage not only contains salt, but also nutriënts. Without hydrological intervention, the waterquality in the area would suffer significantly from the brackish seepage. To prevent this, each year about 140 million cubic meter {{of water from the}} lake Markermeer, which equals a column of 20 cm, is let in at the river Vecht. This water is used to dilute the brackish water and flush it as soon as possible to the bigger parts of the watersystem like the Amsterdam-Rijncanal. However, this supply of a huge volume of water from the Markermeer is the reason that the water quality objectives, as set in the European Water Framework Directive, are not met in the area around {{the northern part of the}} river Vecht. Ecologically, this area needs local, fresh seepage from the hills of the Utrechtse Heuvelrug and not the foreign water from the Markermeer, which contains a lot of sulphate. Furthermore, the available amount of fresh water in the Markermeer is expected to become less due to the predicted climate change and the involved waterboards have agreed to reduce the intake from the Markermeer. <b>Waternet</b> is the merged organisation of: 1) the Waterboard Amstel, Gooi and Vecht, 2) the Surface Water and Sewerage Management of the City of Amsterdam, 3) the Amsterdam Water Supply. Because <b>Waternet,</b> as a governmental organisation, covers the complete watercycle, innova-tive solutions for the classic problems with brackish seepage can be thought of [...] . Currently <b>Waternet</b> works on the following research questions: Can the brackish ground-water be extracted by wells, to prevent the brackish seepage to reach the surface water sys-tem of the deep polder? Does this save fresh water from the Markermeer? Can this brackish groundwater be used as a new source for the drinking water supply for the city of Amster-dam? And if so, how can the concentrate be disposed that is created with the purification of the brackish groundwater by the process of reverse osmosis? What are the benefits, the costs and the risks of such a system? We would like to present a concise but colorful introduction of the current system with the brackish seepage from the polder Horstermeer, and the ideas for using it as a new source for drinking water.

An integrated approach to green and blue water management from the farmer’s field to the river basin scale is required to promote and upscale smallholder rural livelihood improvements. This cannot be achieved though the introduction of innovations alone, but requires the building of appropriate capacity in land and water management at all the scales at which interventions are implemented, or management decisions are taken.

40|$|In The Netherlands, 50 % of the {{drinking}} water is treated with pellet softening for various reasons: i) public health (heavy metal solubility), ii) costs (warm water device maintenance, energy and soap requirement), iii) environmental benefits (energy and soap requirement) and iv) customer comfort (scaling) [2]. Calcium carbonate crystallizes on a seeding grain of garnet or sand and calcium carbonate pellets are produced as a by-product. These pellets are applied as a (secondary) raw material in industries such as the construction, agricultural and mineral-resource sector. The sand grain inside the pellet inhibits reuse as seeding material and application in high potential market segments such as glass, paper, food and feed. Pellet quality significantly improves by replacing the sand grain {{with a grain of}} calcite (calcium carbonate) since in such way the pellet exists of one component only and the iron content is reduced. Earlier work showed that it is technologically possible and in some cases economically feasible to replace sand grains with commercially available calcite grains [3], obtained from limestone quarries (e. g. Italy or Germany). In order to further increase sustainability by reducing transportation, the drying, grinding and sieving of pellets and the reuse of this calcite as seeding material for softening was investigated on pilot scale at <b>Waternet.</b> Currently, the calcite reuse concept is tested at full scale at the Weesperkarspel facility of <b>Waternet</b> in a TKI project 1.

As many authors have already acknowledged (Frijns et al., 2008; Mol et al., 2010; van der Hoek, 2012; Blom et al., 2010; etc.) the watercycle offers much potential in terms of thermal and chemical energy {{in order to reduce}} CO 2 eq. emissions, herewith creating value of metabolic urban streams to allow for direct sustainability applications in urban areas.

In this paper, we document and discuss the experiences of these regional networks, focusing especially on the networks' different approaches to 1) interdisciplinary and gender approaches, 2) the connection between capacity development, research and policy advocacy...|$|E
40|$|The {{centralized}} {{drinking water}} supply system of the Metropolitan Area of Amsterdam, operated and owned mainly by <b>Waternet,</b> has high performance indicators and satisfies the full demand for water in the urban grid and surrounding areas on a full cost recovery basis. Social and technological developments, stemming mainly from (i) the increasing world-wide concern about the sustainability of resources, water scarcity {{and the effects of}} climate change, (ii) concepts related to integrated urban water management with a target towards sewage load reduction and rain water retention, and (iii) innovation in housing appliances and waste-water treatment technology, suggest that the current regime of drinking water demand of retail customers could change. A decrease of water demand concerns the water utility, that is operating a system in under-capacity and {{is currently working on a}} Long-Term Vision for their {{water supply system}}. The future seems highly uncertain and it is essential to understand (i) how and by whom water saving could be induced in an area of abundant water resources like the Metropolitan Area of Amsterdam and (ii) what kind of effects a further decrease of water demand could bring about. Standard Policy Analysis techniques are applied to address this issue and the approach is largely qualitative. Desk study and interviews are conducted to collect information and data that are systemized and further processed through uncertainty and systems analysis to supply an answer to the above. The anticipated changes that could lead to water saving –drivers of water saving– are clustered in categories for supplying clarity and are, then, classified according to their potential effect and uncertainty. Stakeholders and their actions that could induce water saving are also identified. The system is decomposed into embedded subsystems in order to identify potential effects on each one, and mitigating alternatives are discussed after examining the available practices for maintaining a high performing water supply system. The analysis supplies insights on the type of information that <b>Waternet</b> needs to seek in order to perform educated explorations about the future, as well as on how this could be achieved. The outcome of the research can be utilized towards this end and towards developing further the Long-Term Vision of the water supply system. However, further research is necessary in order to make elaborate quantitative estimations in this direction.

40|$|As {{the public}} water {{authority}} {{of the city of}} Amsterdam and surrounding areas, <b>Waternet</b> makes use of both steady-state and transient groundwater models for a variety of purposes involving urban groundwater management. For instance when determining the effect of planned measures on the occurrence of groundwater levels that are too low or too high, potentially resulting in degradation of wooden pile foundations or mold in houses, respectively. One of the challenges we face in that modelling, is the discrepancy between the physical processes that play a part in the city, influencing groundwater measurements, {{and the extent to which}} we are able to quantify those processes in groundwater models. We addressed this discrepancy with automated Time Series Analysis (TSA). In the over 3000 time series of groundwater measurements that were analyzed, TSA often identified one or more disturbances, such as groundwater extractions and measurement error. Along with identifying disturbances and artifacts, TSA offers a way to structurally address these issues. Incorporating (automated) TSA in generating model observations also results in a uniform, reproducible approach, and the ability to evaluate enormous amounts of monitoring wells. We argue that this approach is preferable to visual inspection and evaluation of measurement series, and discuss ways to incorporate these insights into groundwater models. Water Resource...|$|E
40|$|Water in Africa is {{a matter}} of life and death. Problems related to the {{management}} of the water resources are complex and closely related with human security and well-being. The key question addressed in this paper is: what can universities in Southern and Eastern Africa do to tackle the 'water problems'? There are urgent needs for a cadre of Integrated Water Resources Managers, trained to utilise not only knowledge and skills from the conventional water engineering disciplines, but also, major aspects of the humanities and social sciences. No single university is in the position to do justice to the required course programme depending solely on its own internal resources. An African Collaborative Programme which utilises the relative strengths of various universities in a complementary manner, is implied in this case. The paper describes an initiative to set up such a collaborative Master degree programme in Integrated Water Resources Management. The vehicle selected for the collaboration was that of a network supported by a regional membership organisation (<b>WaterNet).</b> Small teams of network members, usually from two or three countries (member universities) are responsible for the development of individual modules, while an international academic committee provides quality assurance. The paper describes the salient aspects of the Master degree programme...|$|E
40|$|Softening at {{drinking}} water treatment plants is often realised by fluidised bed pellet reactors. Generally, sand {{is used as}} seeding material and pellets are produced as a by-product. To improve to sustainability, research {{has been carried out}} to replace the seeding material by re-using grained and sieved calcite pellets as seeding material. An explicit fluidisation model is developed to predict the fluid bed state in fluid bed pellet softening reactors with calcite as seeding material. The fluidisation theory is extended in a model whereby soft sensors are derived and experimentally tested {{for a wide range of}} seeding material and pellets. With the soft sensors porosity, particle size and pressure drop can explicitly be calculated. Pilot research has been carried out to calibrate and full-scale experiments to validate the fluidisation models. Four different fluidisation models were reviewed from which the original Richardson-Zaki fluid bed model has been selected as the best explicit fluidisation model to predict the porosity, particle size and pressure drop. Applying a discretisation model for the fluid bed pellet reactor, the current operation of the treatment softening can be improved by estimating the fluidisation, pressure drop behaviour and particle profile. <b>Waternet</b> can apply the Richardson-Zaki fluid bed model in practice for building a soft sensor to achieve optimal bed fluid conditions for the softening process.

40|$|To {{guarantee}} a good water quality at the customers tap, natural organic matter (NOM) should be (partly) removed during drinking water treatment. The {{objective of this}} research was to improve the biological stability of the produced water by incorporating anion exchange (IEX) for NOM removal. Different placement positions of IEX in the treatment lane (IEX positioned before coagulation, before ozonation or after slow sand filtration) and two IEX configurations (MIEX ® and fluidized IEX (FIX)) were compared on water quality as well as costs. For this purpose the pre-treatment plant at Loenderveen and production plant Weesperkarspel of <b>Waternet</b> were used as a case study. Both, MIEX ® and FIX were able to remove NOM (mainly the HS fraction) to a high extent. NOM removal can be done efficiently before ozonation and after slow sand filtration. The biological stability, in terms of assimilable organic carbon, biofilm formation rate and dissolved organic carbon, was improved by incorporating IEX for NOM removal. The operational costs were assumed to be directly dependent of the NOM removal rate and determined the difference between the IEX positions. The total costs for IEX for the three positions were approximately equal (0. 0631 € m − 3), however the savings on following treatment processes caused a cost reduction for the IEX positions before coagulation and before ozonation compared to IEX positioned after slow sand filtration. IEX positioned before ozonation was most cost effective and improved the biological stability of the treated water...|$|E
40|$|This article {{explores the}} entry and spread of IWRM in the Southern African Development Community (SADC) region. It traces how {{the idea of}} IWRM was {{promoted}} and sustained throughout the region by mapping key events, actors and networks that were involved in promoting the approach. It {{highlights the importance of}} regional networks in promoting IWRM and shows how regional dynamics, playing out at the interface between the global and local levels, influenced the adoption/adaptation and spread of IWRM. The article finds that the idea of IWRM 'hit the ground running' in SADC due to several contributing factors. These include: historical political connections between the member countries; historically rooted well-established channels and connections with bilateral and multilateral donors; the success of networks such as the Global Water Partnership and <b>WaterNet</b> whose mandate was to promote the concept; and the fact that two-thirds of the region’s population live in transboundary basins with IWRM providing a suitable hook for transboundary cooperation, often inspired by European models. The article further argues that IWRM thrived because of strong donor agendas that were adapted by key SADC actors to suit strategic interests. It thus provided a platform for complex politically charged negotiations to reconcile apparently divergent goals such as infrastructure vs management and regional vs national interests. The practice of IWRM in the region is very much shaped by a conflation of regional, national and donor interests and has now acquired a life of its own, despite changing donor priorities...|$|E
40|$|The {{drinking}} {{water in the}} Netherlands is of high quality and the production cost is low. This {{is the result of}} extensive research in the past decades to innovate and optimise the treatment processes. The processes are monitored and operated by motivated and skilled operators and process technologists, which leads to an operator-dependent, subjective, variable and possibly suboptimal operation of the treatment plants. Furthermore, the extensive automation of the treatment plants reduces the possible operator attention to the individual process units. The use of mathematical process models might solve these problems. This thesis focuses on the application of models in model-based monitoring, optimisation and control of drinking-water treatment plants, with the Weesperkarspel treatment plant of <b>Waternet</b> as a case study. To shift the operation of {{drinking water}} treatment plants from experience driven to knowledge based, a model-based approach is shown to be effective. Models are successfully used in plant analysis and basic control design, resulting in the successful implementation of new basic control for the softening reactors at the Weesperkarspel plant. Model-based monitoring schemes abstract relevant information from the large amount of data and the schemes estimate {{the current state of the}} processes. Model-based control uses the monitored process state to dynamically optimise the treatment without introducing new disturbances in the treatment plant. Model-based optimisation gives the process technologist the possibility to improve treatment operation without disrupting the full-scale plant.

40|$|Calcium {{carbonate}} pellets {{are produced}} as a by-product in the softening process. In The Netherlands, these pellets are applied as a raw material in several industrial and agricultural processes. The sand grain inside the pellet hinders the application in some high potential market segments such as paper and glass. Earlier work {{showed that it}} is technologically possible {{and in some cases}} economically feasible to replace sand grains with commercially available calcite grains obtained from limestone (e. g. in Italy or Germany).). In order to further increase sustainability by reduction of transport, {{it might be possible to}} grind and sieve the pellets and reuse this grinded Dutch calcite as seeding material for pellet softening process. The goal of this research was to determine the possibilities of the use of grinded Dutch calcite as an alternative for the use of garnet sand as seeding material in the pellet softening process. A comparison between grinded calcite and garnet sand is made based on the five key performance indicators (K. P. I. ’s) : quality, quantity, costs, reliability and sustainability. Pilot scale tests were conducted at Weesperkarspel (<b>Waternet)</b> during the winter period. The produced calcite pellets were dried, grinded and sieved calcite as seeding material (0. 5 mm) by grinding and sieving the Dutch calcite pellets (1 mm). The produced calcite grains were applied as seeding material in a fluidized bed softening reactor (? = 30 cm; height = 6 m; velocity = 60 - 80 m/h). The effect on sustainability was based on a life cycle analysis (LCA) performed in SimaPro. An FMECA was carried out to identify possible risks failures for the fullscale implementation.
