These facilities would accumulate more than 20 metric tons of irradiated mercury in the target, which has {{to be treated as}} highly radioactive and chemo-toxic waste. Liquid waste cannot be tolerated in European repositories. As part of this work on safety/decommissioning of high-power spallation sources, our investigations were focused mainly to study experimentally and theoretically the solidification of liquid mercury <b>waste</b> (<b>selection</b> of an adequate solid mercury form and of an immobilization matrix, chemical engineering process studies on solidification/stabilization and on encapsulating in a matrix).

Our irradiation experimental studies on mercury waste revealed that mercury sulfide is a reasonable solid for disposal and shows larger stability in possible accidents with water ingress in a repository. Additionally immobilization of mercury in a cement matrix and polysiloxane matrix were tested. HgS formation from liquid target mercury by a wet process is identified as a suitable formation procedure.

Class 1 integrons are genetic elements that carry antibiotic and quaternary ammonium compound (QAC) resistance genes that confer resistance to detergents and biocides. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and diversity of class 1 integron and integron-associated QAC resistance genes in bacteria associated with industrial waste, sewage sludge and pig slurry. We show that prevalence of class 1 integrons is higher in bacteria exposed to detergents and/or antibiotic residues, specifically in sewage sludge and pig slurry compared with agricultural soils to which these waste products are amended. We also show that QAC resistance genes are more prevalent {{in the presence of}} detergents. Studies of class 1 integron prevalence in sewage sludge amended soil showed measurable differences compared with controls.

40|$|Pre-compacted {{bentonite}} {{has long}} been proposed as a primary component of an engineered barrier system for the safe geological disposal of radioactive <b>waste.</b> <b>Selection</b> of properties such as the clay composition, compaction-state and clay-to-sand ratio varies in different disposal concepts. However, a sound understanding of the gas transport properties of the barrier material is often considered {{a necessary part of}} safety case development for a geological disposal facility. In this study, results are presented from two gas injection experiments conducted in Mx 80 bentonite, under elevated pore-water pressure conditions. Test observations indicate that the conditions necessary for gas to enter this material are remarkably consistent, irrespective of the applied water pressure. As expected, an association is noted between the total stress experienced by the clay and the gas pressure at the moment of entry. Gas migration is interpreted as occurring by the formation and propagation of dilatant pathways within the bentonite. Local pore-pressure and stress measurements indicate that significant reworking of the clay can occur, resulting in meta-stable episodes of ‘pressure-cycling’, as gas seeks a stable escape pathway. These findings demonstrate the potential for ‘phases’ of pathway development and propagation within the buffer, resulting in successive migration episodes over the repository lifetime. Experiments also show the potential for gas entry into the buffer to occur as a result of declining pore-water pressure conditions. As such, the influence of significant deviations from hydrostatic conditions (for example, resulting from glacial loading) should not be neglected when considering gas interaction with the buffer over long timescales...|$|E

The functional unit of the study was defined as “the treatment of all the unsorted urban residual waste in input to the plant in the year 2015 ”, corresponding to 378, 000 tons. The plant modelling was realized with the SimaPro v. 8. 0 software tool. The inventory analysis was carried out on primary data, while for the background data; the Ecoinvent v. 3 database was used. The environmental impacts were calculated with the ReCiPe 2008 H evaluation method (both at the midpoint and endpoint levels). <b>Waste</b> <b>selection</b> and RDF production were the most impacting phases. A significant consumption of electric energy occurring in all management phases was the main cause of impacts. However, if the MBT plant were supplied by electricity from photovoltaic panels, the total impacts would decrease by 38 %. The exhausted air treatment system provided high contribution to total environmental impacts of MBT. This was due to both operation and maintenance of the bio-filters and scrubbers, i. e. energetic consumption of detecting systems and replacement of worn bio-filtering material. For some impact categories (Climate change and Human toxicity), the adoption of scrubbers and bio-filters could cause higher impacts of direct emissions in atmosphere of exhausted air without treatment...|$|E

The matrix of expert estimates of i-th level of quality for the set combinations of parameters values according to the scheme of complete factorial experiment is made. Considered a model for the calculation of the raw material preparation for milling, which characterizes the main qualities of the processed raw materials. For the purpose of management of quality of technological processes of flour mill the mathematical model which includes calculation of two groups of indicators of an assessment is developed: qualities of preparation of raw materials for a grinding and qualities of conducting technological process. The algorithm of an analytical assessment of indicators of quality of technological process of the flour-grinding enterprises, including the selection of <b>waste,</b> <b>selection</b> of bran, a compliance rate of output of flour-grinding products, compliance rate of moisture products, is offered.
