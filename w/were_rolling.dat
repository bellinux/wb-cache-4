5|$|Some of {{the other}} senior {{officers}} in the Armed Forces Council were not so lucky, and they were caught by Phát's troops inside headquarters, while other buildings of the military complex remained under junta control. Khánh managed to escape to Vũng Tàu. His plane was just emerging from the hangar and lifted off just as rebel tanks <b>were</b> <b>rolling</b> in, attempting to block the runway and shut down the airport. Phát's ground troops also missed capturing Kỳ, who fled through the streets in a sports car {{with his wife and}} mother-in-law. Kỳ ended up at Tân Sơn Nhất, where he ran into Khánh; the pair flew off together to regroup.|$|E
5|$|Though he {{was very}} close to his younger sister, Princess Helen, Alexander was less warm towards his elder brother George, with whom he had little in common. While his elder brother was a serious and {{thoughtful}} child, Alexander was mischievous and extroverted; he smoked cigarettes made from blotting paper, set fire to the games room in the palace, and recklessly lost control of a toy cart in which he and his younger brother Paul <b>were</b> <b>rolling</b> down a hill, tipping his toddler brother a distance of six feet into brambles.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{before noon}} on 19 February, he used around fifty tanks, their crew and {{a mixture of}} {{infantry}} battalions to seize {{control of the military}} headquarters, the post office and the radio station of Saigon. He surrounded the home of General Khánh and Gia Long Palace, the residence of head of state Phan Khắc Sửu. The tanks were led by Colonel Dương Hiếu Nghĩa, a Catholic member of the Đại Việt. The country was still trying to find stability, with Phan Huy Quát being appointed prime minister just three days earlier. Khánh managed to escape and flee to Vũng Tàu. His plane lifted off from Tan Son Nhut Air Base, the country's military headquarters, just as rebel tanks <b>were</b> <b>rolling</b> in, attempting to block the runway. Thảo's men tried to capture the Saigon base of the Republic of Vietnam Navy, and its commander, Admiral Chung Tấn Cang, but were foiled, but they did capture a number of junta members at Tan Son Nhut.|$|E

25|$|Baseball {{movies were}} not {{considered}} a viable commercial prospect {{at the time and}} every studio passed except for Orion Pictures, which gave Shelton a USD $7.5 million budget, an eight-week shooting schedule, and creative freedom. Even so, many cast members accepted salaries lower than their usual requirements due to their enthusiasm for the material. Costner was cast because of his natural athletic ability. During filming, Costner was able to hit two home runs while the cameras <b>were</b> <b>rolling.</b>|$|E
25|$|Stage 7 {{was where}} the Enterprise-B's bridge, {{deflector}} room and corridors were built and filmed. The jolts and shocks of the ship in the hold of the energy ribbon were created by camera bumps and motors to shake the set. Filming of the scenes took place in April 1994, while residents were still skittish from the recent 1994 Northridge earthquake; the effects staff deliberately hid the set shakers until cameras <b>were</b> <b>rolling</b> to elecit more genuine reactions. The Amargosa observatory set was an elaborate redress of the Enterprise-B bridge, with an added back room, second level, and swapped walls changing the layout to appear a different setting. Control panels styled after those in the original Star Trek television series helped suggest {{the age of the}} station.|$|E

500|$|Skelton's {{first contact}} with Hollywood {{came in the}} form of a failed 1932 screen test. In 1938 he made his film debut for RKO Pictures in the {{supporting}} role of a camp counselor in Having Wonderful Time. He appeared in two short subjects for Vitaphone in 1939: Seeing Red and The Broadway Buckaroo. Actor Mickey Rooney contacted Skelton, urging him to try for work in films after seeing him perform his [...] "Doughnut Dunkers" [...] act at President Roosevelt's 1940 birthday party. [...] For his Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer screen test, Skelton performed many of his more popular skits, such as [...] "Guzzler's Gin", but added some impromptu pantomimes as the cameras <b>were</b> <b>rolling.</b> [...] "Imitation of Movie Heroes Dying" [...] were Skelton's impressions of the cinema deaths of stars like George Raft, Edward G. Robinson and James Cagney.|$|E

500|$|Sapochnik {{was asked}} in an {{interview}} what the most difficult shot was to direct, responding [...] "The final sequence of seeing the armada {{on its way to}} Westeros was complicated because it involved so many different ships, and we only had one that we had to redress and shoot again and again. It was also raining and freezing when we shot it, and {{it was meant to be}} a Mediterranean climate. Emilia Clarke got so cold, her jaw started shaking uncontrollably and she totally lost her thread as far as what she was meant to be thinking in that moment, the cold will do that. She asked me to help, so I suggested that she just hum the theme to Game of Thrones in her head while we <b>were</b> <b>rolling</b> the cameras, and apparently that worked because it's the take we used in the final cut!" ...|$|E
500|$|Another bill Milk {{concentrated}} on {{was designed to}} solve the number one problem {{according to a recent}} citywide poll: dog excrement. Within a month of being sworn in, he began to work on a city ordinance to require dog owners to scoop their pets' feces. Dubbed the [...] "pooper scooper law", its authorization by the Board of Supervisors was covered extensively by television and newspapers in San Francisco. Anne Kronenberg, Milk's campaign manager, called him [...] "a master at figuring out what would get him covered in the newspaper". He invited the press to Duboce Park to explain why it was necessary, and while cameras <b>were</b> <b>rolling,</b> stepped in the offending substance, seemingly by mistake. His staffers, however, knew he had been at the park for an hour before the press conference looking for the right place to walk in front of the cameras. It earned him the most fan mail of his tenure in politics and went out on national news releases.|$|E
500|$|After Duane's death, {{the band}} held {{a meeting on}} their future; clearly all wanted to continue, and after a short period, the band {{returned}} to the road. [...] "We all had this thing in us and Duane put it there. He was the teacher and he gave something to us—his disciples—that we had to play out," [...] said drummer Butch Trucks. The band returned to Miami in December to complete work on their third studio album. Completing the recording of Eat a Peach raised each member's spirits; [...] "The music brought life back to us all, and it was simultaneously realized by every one of us. We found strength, vitality, newness, reason, and belonging as we worked on finishing Eat a Peach," [...] said Allman. [...] "Those last three songs [...] just kinda floated right on out of us [...] The music was still good, it was still rich, and it still had that energy—it was still the Allman Brothers Band." [...] Released in February 1972, Eat a Peach was the band's second hit album, shipping gold and peaking at number four on Billboard Top 200 Pop Albums chart. [...] "We'd been through hell, but somehow we <b>were</b> <b>rolling</b> bigger than ever," [...] said Gregg Allman.|$|E

500|$|Before {{the release}} of Eat a Peach, {{industry}} talk suggested {{the demise of the}} group after the death of Duane Allman. The record's promotional campaign was coordinated by Dick Wooley, the former head of promotion for Atlantic Records. He had recently quit his position there and was contacted by Walden to help Capricorn in its efforts. (Capricorn Records had recently separated from Atlantic Records as well; Eat a Peach would be among the first Capricorn albums released under a new distribution deal with Warner Bros. Records.) [...] "They needed help because the buzz in the record business and on the street was that the ABB was finished as a band and would never survive without Duane," [...] said Wooley. After being played some songs from Eat a Peach by Sandlin, Wooley was [...] "blown away" [...] and accepted the offer at half his usual salary. He arranged to have the band's New Year's Eve performance at New Orleans' Warehouse live simulcast on radio. [...] "I took a gamble and cobbled together a network of radio stations in the Southeast via Ma Bell phone lines," [...] said Wooley. The stunt helped launch Eat a Peach, which was issued by Capricorn in February 1972 and became an instant success. The album shipped enough copies to be certified by the RIAA as gold and peaked at number four on Billboard Top 200 Pop Albums chart. [...] "We'd been through hell, but somehow we <b>were</b> <b>rolling</b> bigger than ever," [...] said Gregg Allman.|$|E

He cast Robbins over the strong objections of the studio, who wanted Anthony Michael Hall instead. Shelton had to threaten to quit before the studio backed off.|$|E

I walked past a big recruitment sign that said 'Fly Navy' with a pilot looking off into the wild blue yonder standing on the wing of the plane."

Voris entered the Navy's flight training program, and was still in flight school when the Imperial Japanese Navy launched its attack on Pearl Harbor.|$|E
