Using both the ‘over‐optimism’ and ‘miscalibration’ effects of overconfidence to generate our predictions, <b>we</b> <b>examine</b> three research questions.

Second, <b>we</b> <b>examine</b> whether overconfidence increases the amount of optimism in management forecasts. Third, <b>we</b> <b>examine</b> whether overconfidence increases the specificity and precision of the forecast. We use both options‐ and press‐based measures to proxy for individual overconfidence, and find support for all three research questions. We further find that the results are concentrated among firms that provide forecasts sporadically, consistent with overconfidence playing a stronger role when managers have more flexibility in determining forecast properties...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is based}} on three essays that study operational strategies to manage environmental uncertainty. In essay 1, <b>we</b> <b>examine</b> {{the costs and benefits}} of different supply chain structures in managing multi-product demand uncertainty. In particular we analyze the strategic performance of delayed differentiation and early differentiation in supply chains. We demonstrate that the conventional wisdom arguing for delayed differentiation may be strategically unsound. In essay 2, <b>we</b> <b>examine</b> the role of strategies that mitigate the effects of product development uncertainty. We create a multi-year data-set on product development pipelines and the financial performance of large pharmaceutical firms. <b>We</b> <b>examine</b> the effect of risk mitigating strategies, such as development of backup compounds on the financial performance of firms and find that these strategies lead to superior financial outcomes. In essay 3, <b>we</b> <b>examine</b> the role of demand uncertainty on a multi-tier supply chain. <b>We</b> <b>examine</b> the structure of advanced purchase discounts that lead to efficient information transmission in the supply chain. We characterize their benefits, costs and provide recommendations on administration of advance purchase discounts. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we present an {{overview}} of image processing techniques which use fractal methods in some way.

The three principal fields of image processing and analysis th a t <b>we</b> <b>examine</b> are texture classification, image segmentation and image coding. In the area of texture classification, <b>we</b> <b>examine</b> fractal dimension estimators, comparing these methods to other methods in use, and to each other. We attempt to explain why differences arise between various estimators of the same quantity. <b>We</b> also <b>examine</b> texture generation methods which use fractal dimension to generate textures of varying complexity. <b>We</b> <b>examine</b> how fractal dimension can contribute to image segmentation methods. We also present an in-depth analysis of a novel segmentation scheme based on fractal coding.
