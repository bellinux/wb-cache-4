As part of his duties, he oversaw {{the completion of the}} International Terminal of O'Hare International Airport, preparations for the 1994 FIFA World Cup, and the construction of new schools. Along with Budget Director Paul Vallas, Chico helped add 1,000 officers to the police force and improved neighborhoods throughout the city through a program called Neighborhoods Alive.|$|E
5|$|Integrity {{was laid}} down in September 1802 at the newly opened King's Dockyard in the colony of New South Wales. Governor Philip Gidley King ordered that {{construction}} proceed as swiftly as possible, {{in order to test}} the Dockyard's capacity. A team of two shipwrights, two apprentice shipwrights and two sawyers were assigned the task and delivered the finished cutter in thirteen months. During construction shipwright Thomas Moore tested that the hull was watertight by filling it <b>with</b> <b>water</b> <b>from</b> the inside, and repairing any visible leaks. Her hold also incorporated a partition that her crew could move to or away from the forecastle bulkhead to vary her cargo capacity.|$|E

5|$|Little {{evidence}} of an occupation on the tell exists following {{the destruction of the}} Mitannian city, however, a series of small villages existed in the lower town during the Assyrian periods. The remains of a Hellenistic settlement were discovered on a nearby satellite tell, to the northwestern edge of the main tell. However, excavations recovered no ceramics of the Parthian-Roman or Byzantine-Sasanian periods, although sherds dating to those periods are noted. In the middle of the first millennium AD, a fortified building was erected in the northeastern lower town. The building was dated by Antoine Poidebard to the Justinian era (sixth century AD), {{on the basis of its}} architecture. The last occupation period of the site was during the early Abbasid Caliphate's period, when a canal was built to provide the town <b>with</b> <b>water</b> <b>from</b> the nearby Jaghjagh River.|$|E
5|$|The mosque's main {{ablution}} fountain, {{known as}} al-Kas ("the Cup"), is located {{north of the}} mosque {{between it and the}} Dome of the Rock. It is used by worshipers to perform wudu, a ritual washing of the hands, arms, legs, feet, and face before entry into the mosque. It was first built in 709 by the Umayyads, but in 1327–28 Governor Tankiz enlarged it to accommodate more worshipers. Although originally supplied <b>with</b> <b>water</b> <b>from</b> Solomon's Pools near Bethlehem, it currently receives water from pipes connected to Jerusalem's water supply. In the 20th-century, al-Kas was provided taps and stone seating.|$|E
5|$|The nuckelavee is {{the most}} malevolent of the demons {{in and around the}} Scottish islands, without any redeeming characteristics. The only entity able to control it is the Mither o' the Sea, an ancient spirit in Orcadian mythology who keeps the nuckelavee {{confined}} during the summer months. In common with other mythical sea monsters, {{with the possible exception of}} kelpies and the nuggle of Shetland, it is unable to wade through fresh flowing water, therefore it can be escaped by crossing a stream. Tammas managed to escape from the nuckelavee after he inadvertently splashed it <b>with</b> <b>water</b> <b>from</b> the loch he was alongside; this briefly distracted the monster, allowing Tammas to run over to a nearby channel of fresh water and jump to safety on the opposite bank.|$|E

5|$|In 1992 a {{party of}} French {{academics}} attended a condensed matter conference in Ukraine where physicist Daniel Beysens introduced them {{to the story of}} how ancient Theodosia was supplied <b>with</b> <b>water</b> <b>from</b> dew condensers. They were sufficiently intrigued that in 1993 they went to see for themselves. They concluded that the mounds that Zibold identified as dew condensers were in fact ancient burial mounds (a part of the necropolis of antic Theodosia) and that the pipes were medieval in origin and not associated with the mounds. They found the remains of Zibold's condenser, which they tidied up and examined closely. Zibold's condenser had apparently performed reasonably well, but in fact his exact results are not at all clear, and {{it is possible that the}} collector was intercepting fog, which added significantly to the yield. If Zibold's condenser worked at all, this was probably due to fact that a few stones near the surface of the mound were able to lose heat at night while being thermally isolated from the ground; however, it could never have produced the yield that Zibold envisaged.|$|E
5|$|Irrigation <b>with</b> <b>water</b> <b>from</b> the Merced River {{continued}} to grow substantially until most of the arable land around the river, some , was under cultivation. By the late 1950s and early 1960s, irrigation in the San Joaquin Valley was {{to such an extent}} that many of the rivers ran dry in sections. Upriver of the Merced River confluence with the San Joaquin, the latter river was usually dry, only regaining flow where the Merced River enters. In the mid-20th century, the flow in the Merced River diminished to such a degree that very few salmon returned to spawn in the lower section of the Merced River. In 1991, a fish hatchery, the Merced River Hatchery, was built beside the Merced River just downstream of the Crocker-Huffman Diversion Dam, the lowermost Merced River dam. Fall chinook salmon travel up a fish ladder into the hatchery's pools, which are supplied with water diverted from the Merced River.|$|E
5|$|Parsifal {{tells of}} his desire to return to Amfortas (""). He relates his long journey, how he wandered for years, {{unable to find a}} path back to the Grail. He had often been forced to fight, but never wielded the Spear in battle. Gurnemanz tells him that the curse {{preventing}} Parsifal from finding his right path has now been lifted, but that in his absence Amfortas has never unveiled the Grail, and lack of its sustaining properties has caused the death of Titurel. Parsifal is overcome with remorse, blaming himself for this state of affairs. Gurnemanz tells him that today is the day of Titurel's funeral, and that Parsifal has a great duty to perform. Kundry washes Parsifal's feet and Gurnemanz anoints him <b>with</b> <b>water</b> <b>from</b> the Holy Spring, recognizing him as the pure fool, now enlightened by compassion, and as the new King of the Knights of the Grail.|$|E

5|$|Presumably a {{few days}} later, Katy has since made friends with a monkey and uses her {{stiletto}} heel to form a spear. She uses it to shoot a banana, which she gives to the monkey. In another scene, she bathes in the lake, {{with the help of}} an elephant who sprays her <b>with</b> <b>water</b> <b>from</b> the lake using its trunk. Katy helps a crocodile by brushing its teeth using a toothbrush she has salvaged, and tries to reach her clothes which have been taken by the elephant. At night, she holds a torch and explores a cave. Inside, she watches an animated drawing on the wall in which humans try to kill a tiger with fire; attempting to burn it as it grows stronger and shooting spears which it sends firing back towards them with its roar. The next morning, Katy emerges from the cave, wearing a leopard-print bikini top, a grass skirt, laced up legs and bare feet, displaying a boost of confidence and holding the spear she made earlier. She stands on top of a waterfall, overlooking the jungle, and then swings across the sky on a vine.|$|E
5|$|Sapumal Kumaraya (also {{known as}} Chempaha Perumal in Tamil), who ruled the Jaffna kingdom {{on behalf of}} the Kotte kingdom is {{credited}} with either building or renovating the Nallur Kandaswamy temple. Singai Pararasasegaram is credited with building the Sattanathar temple, the Vaikuntha Pillaiyar temple and the Veerakaliamman temple. He built a pond called Yamuneri and filled it <b>with</b> <b>water</b> <b>from</b> the Yamuna river of North India, which is considered holy by Hindus. He was a frequent the visitor of the Koneswaram temple, as was his son and successor King Cankili I. King Jeyaveera Cinkaiariyan had the traditional history of the temple compiled as a chronicle in verse, entitled Dakshina Kailasa Puranam, known today as the Sthala Puranam of Koneshwaram Temple. Major temples were normally maintained by the kings and a salary was paid from the royal treasury to those who worked in the temple, unlike in India and rest of Sri Lanka, where religious establishments were autonomous entities with large endowments of land and related revenue.|$|E
5|$|The North Mere is 5.6-acres (2.25 ha) large, and {{is blocked}} off on its {{northern}} end by a sod-cast bank, {{adjacent to the}} site of the North Gate. The southern half takes the form of a 331-foot (101 m) long moat, which was recorded as being 18-foot (5.5 m) deep in the medieval period, terminating in the West Gate. The northern part of this mere occasionally floods in the 21st century, creating a temporary lake, and the moated section usually still contains some standing water. The West Mere, covering 2.25-acres (1 ha), stretches away from the location of West Gate and is blocked at the far end by a small, stone dam. Three rectangular fishponds were built alongside the West Mere, the smallest, probably a stew pond for raising young fish, being fed <b>with</b> <b>water</b> <b>from</b> the lake. A protective earthen bank, probably originally reinforced by a timber palisade, ran for approximately 490 feet (150 m) along either side of the West Gate, where a gatehouse was probably built. At the far end of the lake complex was the South Mere, 2.25-acres (1 ha) in size, with the South Gate positioned in its eastern corner.|$|E
