After the sample had been filtered, the residue was dried and weighed, and the filtrate was analyzed for SO_ 4 ^, Cl^-, and <b>water-soluble</b> <b>matter,</b> {{as well as for}} pH. The average monthly amount of falling dust at eight locations in Kagoshima City was 6. 9 g・m^ ・month^, which was slightly decreased than the value observed in the last fiscal year. Thus, the tendency of low falling dust amount continued, after a period (1999 - 2000) of relatively high falling dust amount (ca, 50 g・m^ ・month^). The weight of <b>water-soluble</b> <b>matter</b> which fell was considerably higher than that for the last fiscal year. NO_ 2 air pollution was measured by use of the filter-badge method.

40|$|This study {{examines}} the hygroscopicity of newly formed particles (smaller than 50 nm in particle mobility diameter) during two atmospheric new particle formation events {{with and without}} clear growth process at mid-level mountain range in Central Germany based on HCCT field campaign. Particle hygroscopicity measurements show that the particle soluble fractions {{at the end of}} event for two events are, respectively 60 % (45 nm particles for the event with clear growth) and 20 % (30 nm particles for the event without clear growth), stressing that non-soluble organic compounds may {{play a key role in}} particle growth during new particle formation event. Such significant difference in particle hygroscopicity also suggests that the chemical species responsible for nucleation particle growth are considerably different between the two selected NPF events. During both events, the hygroscopicity of newly formed particles decreased with particle growth, indicating that more less-hygroscopic compounds contribute to the subsequent condensation in contrast to the earlier stage. Sulfuric acid was considered to be responsible of the NPF event and represent the highly hygroscopic compounds. However, calculation demonstrated that sulfuric acid condensation failed to fully explain the observed soluble fraction in the nucleation mode particles.

'Polidor') were grown under field conditions to investigate the effects of different nitrogen (N) levels (0, 40, 80, and 120 kg ha- 1) on plant growth, water use efficiency, fruit yield and quality (weight, sizes, and <b>water-soluble</b> dry <b>matter),</b> leaf relative water content, and macro nutrition under three different irrigation regimes. Irrigation was applied based on cumulative class A pan evaporation (Ep). Plant treatments were as follows: (1) well-watered treatment (C) received 100 % replenishment of Ep on a daily basis, (2) water-stressed treatment (WS) received 75 % replenishment of Ep at three-day intervals, and (3) severely water-stressed (SWS) : treatment received 50 % replenishment of Ep at six- day intervals. Plants grown under C at 120 kg N ha- 1 produced significantly higher biomass (175. 6 g plant- 1), fruit yield (36. 05 t ha- 1), fruit weight (2. 25 kg fruit- 1), and leaf relative water content (93. 5 %) under increasing N levels than did the two deficit irrigation treatments. The WS or SWS treatments caused reductions in all parameters measured except <b>water-soluble</b> dry <b>matter</b> (SDM) concentrations in fruits compared with those receiving unstressed (C) treatment. The WS irrigation regime with 80 kg ha- 1 N significantly improved the fruit yield and size, plant dry matter, leaf area, and IWUE compared with the SWS regime. Increased N significantly enhanced foliar N in the unstressed plants. Increasing N rate in the SWS treatment did not increase fruit yield with the same trend found in the WS and C treatments with increasing N levels. The yield reduction under severe water shortage was much more severe at high N rates. Water use (ET) at the C treatment at 120 kg ha- 1 N ranged between 160 and 165 cm, while SWS reduced ET to 90 cm at 0 and 40 kg ha- 1 N. Nitrogen supply modified water use at C and WS irrigation regimes. Muskmelon yield response to N rate was quadratic and differed with the level of irrigation. This moderate water deficit (SW) may be an alternative irrigation choice with a suitable N application rate for muskmelon growers in arid and semi-arid regions if the goal is to irrigate an agricultural area with limited water supply for more growers, but not if it is maximizing economic yield. Growers should accept a significant yield reduction in exchange for water conservation...|$|R
40|$|The thermal {{behavior}} of grass fiber {{was characterized by}} means of thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry analysis. The results proved that the removal of <b>water-soluble</b> <b>matter</b> improved the thermal {{behavior of}} grass fiber over that of unleached fiber, and this was further enhanced by an alkali treatment of the grass fiber. The isothermal weight loss of the grass-fiber specimens was analyzed at 100, 200, and 300 °C for different time periods. Accelerated aging of the grass-fiber samples was carried out {{to determine the effect}} of aging on the tensile strength. Partially delignified grass fiber showed maximum thermal stability. X-ray diffraction analysis was also performed to verify the composition and to correlate the change in the tensile strength due to the water leaching and alkali treatment. The processing of grass fiber with NaOH and NaClO 2 reduced the amorphous fraction in the fiber sample. This may have been a result of the loss of the amorphous noncellulosic components of the fibers and the degradation of the unordered regions of the grass fiber. However, mercerization of the grass fiber revealed an increase in the amorphous fraction after a certain time exposure, confirming the decrease in the crystallinity. The morphology of the water-leached and alkali-treated grass fiber was studied with scanning electron microscopy...|$|E
40|$|The {{volcanic}} ash from Mt. Sakurajima was collected together with rain water monthly from April 1984 to March 1985 at 14 locations in Kagoshima city and at 7 locations in Sakurajima. After {{the samples were}} filtered, the residue was dried and weighed, and the filtrate was analyzed for SO_ 4 ^{ 2 -}, Cl^- and <b>water-soluble</b> <b>matter.</b> The amounts of sulfur oxides absorbed on PbO_ 2 candle were measured at the same 19 locations as with ashfall measurement. Several heavy metal and phthalic acid ester content in the ashes were also measured for some samples. The average monthly ashfall at the 14 locations in Kagoshima city was 211 ton/km^ 2 and at the 7 locations in Sakurajima was 2940 ton/km^ 2. The above averages were larger than the corresponding averages of the last fiscal year. In she samples taken at the Kagoshima city hall (June) contained by weight 1. 2 ppm DOP, 11. 3 ppm DBP, 4. 9 × 10 ^ 4 ppm manganese. The highest amount of sulfur oxides absorbed on the PbO_ 2 -candle in this fiscal year was 2. 39 mg/ 100 cm^ 2 /day, which was observed at Sakurajima Hospital in October. Acid rain was observed at all locations. ...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} the hygroscopicity of newly formed particles (diameters range 25 – 45 nm) during two atmospheric new particle formation (NPF) {{events in the}} German mid-level mountains during the Hill Cap Cloud Thuringia 2010 (HCCT- 2010) field experiment. At {{the end of the}} NPF event involving clear particle growth, we measured an unusually high soluble particle fraction of 58. 5 % at 45 nm particle size. The particle growth rate contributed through sulfuric acid condensation only accounts for around 6. 5 % of the observed growth rate. Estimations showed that sulfuric acid condensation explained, however, only around 10 % of that soluble particle fraction. Therefore, the formation of additional <b>water-soluble</b> <b>matter</b> appears imperative to explain the missing soluble fraction. Although direct evidence is missing, we consider water-soluble organics as candidates for this mechanism. For the case with clear growth process, the particle growth rate was determined by two alternative methods based on tracking the mode diameter of the nucleation mode. The mean particle growth rate obtained from the inter-site data comparison using Lagrangian consideration is 3. 8 (± 2. 6) nm h − 1. During the same period, the growth rate calculated based on one site data is 5. 0 nm h − 1 using log-normal distribution function method. In {{light of the fact that}} considerable uncertainties could be involved in both methods, we consider both estimated growth rates consistent...|$|E
40|$|Biogenic organic {{aerosols}} {{can affect}} cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) properties, and subsequently impact climate change. Large uncertainties exist {{in how the}} difference in the types of terrestrial biogenic sources and the abundance of organics relative to sulfate affect CCN properties. For the submicron water-soluble aerosols collected for two years in a cool-temperate forest in northern Japan, we show that the hygroscopicity parameter κCCN (0. 44 [*]±[*] 0. 07) exhibited a distinct seasonal trend with a minimum in autumn (κCCN[*]=[*] 0. 32 – 0. 37); these κCCN values were generally larger than that of ambient particles, including water-insoluble fractions. The temporal variability of κCCN was controlled by the <b>water-soluble</b> organic <b>matter</b> (WSOM) -to-sulfate ratio (R 2 [*]>[*] 0. 60), where the significant reduction of κCCN in autumn was linked to the increased WSOM/sulfate ratio. Positive matrix factorization analysis indicates that α-pinene-derived secondary organic aerosol (SOA) substantially contributed to the WSOM mass (~ 75 %) in autumn, the majority of which was attributable to emissions from litter/soil microbial activity near the forest floor. These findings suggest that WSOM, most likely α-pinene SOA, originated from the forest floor can significantly suppress the aerosol CCN activity in cool-temperate forests, which have implications for predicting climate effects by changes in biogenic emissions in future...|$|R
40|$|Because of low net {{production}} in arctic and subarctic surface water, {{dissolved organic matter}} (DOM) discharged from terrestrial settings {{plays an important role}} for carbon and nitrogen dynamics in arctic aquatic systems. Sorption, typically controlling the export of DOM from soil, may be influenced by the permafrost regime. To confirm the potential sorptive control on the release of DOM from permafrost soils in central northern Siberia, we examined the sorption of DOM by mineral soils of Gelisols and Inceptisols with varying depth of the active layer. <b>Water-soluble</b> organic <b>matter</b> in the O horizons of the Gelisols was less (338 and 407 mgCkg 1) and comprised more dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the hydrophobic fraction (HoDOC) (63 % and 70 %) than in the O horizons of the Inceptisols (686 and 706 mgCkg 1, 45 % and 48 %HoDOC). All A and B horizons from Gelisols sorbed DOC strongly, with a preference for HoDOC. Almost all horizons of the Inceptisols showed a weaker sorption of DOC than those of the Gelisols. The C horizons of the Inceptisols, having a weak overall DOC sorption, sorbed C in the hydrophilic fraction (HiDOC) stronger than HoDOC. The reason for the poor overall sorption an...|$|R

The correlations of the mass-normalized DTT activity with the content of PM in water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC) and non-water-soluble carbonaceous species, such as organic and elemental carbon, as well as with solvent-extractable trace organic compounds (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and nitro-derivatives, polychlorinated biphenyls, organochlorines, polybrominated biphenyl ethers) and polar organic markers (dicarboxylic acids and levoglucosan), are investigated. Our study provides new and additional insights into the ambient size distribution of the DTT activity of the water-soluble fraction of airborne PM at urban sites and its associations with organic PM components...|$|R
