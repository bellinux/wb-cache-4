[...] "We were approaching beds {{in which people}} were waking up from heart attacks and coming around quite distressed sometimes. It was really difficult {{to be there with}} a patient.

[...] Anderson underwent such extensive training with the programme's medical advisors that he jested in June2009, [...] "If I started medical training now, I could probably graduate as a doctor coming out of the show!" [...] The actor experienced [...] "an extended period of anxiety" [...] upon joining the series, and recalls: [...] "It took me about six months to have any sense {{of what was going on}} and then the second six months to feel comfortable [...] but only because it's such a well-oiled machine. You're coming in as a little cog, so you have to discover how to work in that and that takes a while." ...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: The {{in-patient}} <b>ward</b> <b>round,</b> {{which involves}} a bedside visit {{by members of}} the multidisciplinary team to discuss treatment, progress and discharge plans, is central to the patient experience. However, its impact upon patients is often underestimated [1]. Research suggests that patients can feel anxious or dissatisfied with this vital clinical activity, as echoed by some patients in our Cystic Fibrosis (CF) Service. Our aim was {{to gain a better understanding}} of patient perspectives of our in-house <b>ward</b> <b>round</b> with a view to service improvement, if needed...|$|R

2500|$|While at medical school, Spielrein {{continued}} to assist Jung {{in the laboratory}} as she had done as an in-patient. She also attended his <b>ward</b> <b>rounds</b> and met him socially. The strong feelings she had developed towards him as his hospital patient continued during her first three years at medical school, and she developed a fantasy of having a child between them to be called Siegfried. She {{did not have any}} further therapy from him, although from around late 1907 he informally tried to analyze her wish for his child. In the summer of 1908, as she entered her fourth year at medical school, she and Jung began to have increasingly intimate encounters, which she described in her diaries as [...] "poetry".

40|$|<b>Ward</b> <b>round</b> {{teaching}} {{is an essential}} professional medical activity as an organizational form of teaching in undergraduate medical education. Its great importance for shaping a professional "personality" is well recognized by the faculty; {{as well as its}} extremely complex implementation and development of the necessary skills. The problem to be solved in this paper is related to the need to help younger clinical teachers in undergraduate medical education to develop the skills to conduct <b>ward</b> <b>round</b> teaching; which would be achieved through appropriate guidance on how to perform this activity. Based on this, the teaching staff in the Department of Clinical Sciences of the Dr. Raúl Dorticós Torrado Faculty of Medical Sciences in Cienfuegos has designed a model or representation of <b>ward</b> <b>round</b> teaching {{to be used as a}} guide. The main results include the development of a model with two variants, according to the care provided to a recently admitted patient or an already known patient; and the definition of conditions, both in practical and educational areas, which should be considered for the proper implementation of the activity. The model is not a complete representation of the <b>ward</b> <b>round</b> teaching, thus the proposal is open to review and improvement; and its use is based on its adaptation to the particularities of the different disciplines and learning scenarios...|$|R
40|$|Background The {{importance}} of non-technical skills (NTS) to patient outcomes is increasingly being recognised, however, {{there is limited}} research into how such skills can be taught and evaluated in student nurses in relation toward rounds. Objectives This pilot study describes an evaluation of a NTS framework that could potentially be used to measure <b>ward</b> <b>round</b> skills of student nurses. Design and Methods The study used an observational design. Potential key NTS were identified from existing literature and NTS taxonomies. The proposed framework was then used to evaluate whether the identified NTS were evident {{in a series of}} <b>ward</b> <b>round</b> simulations that final year general nursing students undertook as part of their training. Finally, the views {{of a small group of}} qualified nurse educators, qualified nurses and general nursing students were sought about whether the identified NTS were important and relevant to practice. Results The proposed NTS framework included seven categories: Communication, Decision Making, Situational Awareness, Teamwork and Task Management, Student Initiative and Responsiveness to Patient. All were rated as important and relevant to practice. Conclusion The pilot study suggests that the proposed NTS framework could be used as a means of evaluating student nurse competencies in respect of many non-technical skills required for a successful <b>ward</b> <b>round.</b> Further work is required to establish the validity of the framework in educational settings and to determine the extent to which it is of use in a non-simulated <b>ward</b> <b>round</b> setting...|$|R

40|$|The General Medical Council (GMC) states, “A well managed, {{thorough}} and organized handover {{is crucial for}} ensuring the quality and safety for patient care, ” and in their guidance on safe handover the British Medical Association (BMA) advised that “clinically unstable patients are known to the senior and covering clinicians; tasks should be prioritised; plans for further care are put in place; unstable patients are reviewed. ” The orthopaedic department at King’s College Hospital, a busy major trauma centre in London, UK, has a significantly reduced workforce during the weekend. The general consensus was that the <b>ward</b> <b>round</b> was taking too long, giving the foundation year one (FY 1) doctor very little time to commit to other ward jobs and reviewing unstable patients, making it a stressful and challenging environment. The electronic patient record (EPR), an electronic programme available on all Trust computers, is already a very reliable way to allow safe handover of information via a central electronic database. However it has limitations in clearly prioritising more unstable patients from those needing routine review. We created an easily identifiable traffic light coding system that could be simply incorporated into the electronic handover that was re-reviewed and finalised {{in order to improve}} the ability to prioritise patients for senior review. This in turn would directly impact the efficiency of the <b>ward</b> <b>round</b> and improve patient safety. Our immediate results demonstrated the efficiency of the <b>ward</b> <b>round</b> improved in all parameters: time to complete the <b>ward</b> <b>round</b> improved from 7. 1 % to 50 %; prioritisation and ability to highlight the clinical urgency for patient review improved from 15. 4 % to 100 %; and more notably...|$|R

Surprisingly, performance was not inhibited by the round: the 20 patients studied performed the test with equal skill, but greater speed, on the round than in a more private context.

40|$|Objectives: <b>Ward</b> <b>round</b> {{documentation}} provides one of {{the most}} important means of communication between healthcare professionals. We aimed to establish if the use of a problem based standardised proforma can improve documentation in acute surgical receiving. Methods: Gold standards were established using the RCSE record keeping guidelines. We audited documentation for seven days using the following headings: patient name/identification number, subjective findings, objective findings, clinical impression/diagnosis, plan, diet status, discharge decision, discharge planning, signature, and grade. After the initial audit cycle, a <b>ward</b> <b>round</b> proforma was introduced using the above headings and re-audited over a seven day period. Results: The pre-intervention arm contained 50 patients and the post intervention arm contained 47. The following headings showed an improvement in documentation compliance to 100 %: patient name/identification number vs 96 %, subjective findings vs 84 %, objective findings vs 48 %, plan vs 98 %, signature vs 96 %, and grade vs 62 %. Documentation of the clinical impression/diagnosis improved to 98 % vs 30 %, diet status rose to 83 % vs 16 %, discharge decision to 66 % vs 16 %, and discharge planning to 40 % vs 20 %. Conclusions: Standardised proformas improve the documentation of post-take <b>ward</b> <b>round</b> notes. This helps to clarify the onward management plan for all aspects of a patient's care and will help avoid adverse events and litigation. This should improve the quality and safety of Patient Care...|$|R
