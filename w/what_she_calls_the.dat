500|$|Modern critics find darker {{undertones}} in the novel. In {{an essay}} published in College English in 2001, Martine Dutheil states that The Coral Island {{can be thought}} of as epitomising a move away from [...] "the confidence and optimism of the early Victorian proponents of British imperialism" [...] toward [...] "self-consciousness and anxiety about colonial domination". She locates this anxiety in <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>calls</b> <b>the</b> [...] "rhetoric of excess" [...] that features in the descriptions of cannibalism, and especially in the accounts of Fijian savagery provided by Bloody Bill (most notably that of the sacrifice of children to the eel gods) and the missionary, a representative of the London Missionary Society, an [...] "emblematic figure of colonial fiction". Others have also linked popular boys' fiction of the period with imperialism; Joseph Bristow's Empire Boys (1991) claimed to see an imperialist manhood,' which shaped British attitudes towards empire and masculinity." [...] The novel's portrayal of Pacific culture and the effects of colonisation are analyzed in studies such as Brian Street's The Savage in Literature: Representations of 'Primitive' Society in English Fiction (1975) and Rod Edmond's Representing the South Pacific: Colonial Discourse from Cook to Gauguin (1998). The domination imposed by [...] "geographical mapping of a territory and policing of its native inhabitants" [...] is an important theme in the novel both specifically and in general, in the topography of the island as mapped by the boys and the South Pacific's [...] "eventual subjugation and conversion to Christianity", a topic continued in Stevenson's Treasure Island.|$|E

2500|$|International film actress Natalie Portman joined FINCA as its [...] "Ambassador of Hope" [...] in 2003, {{following}} {{a meeting with}} Queen Rania. About the meeting, she explains, [...] "Because I'm Israeli and Queen Rania {{is probably the most}} high-profile Palestinian woman in the world, I had this dream of meeting with her and doing something that would promote peace and working together between Israeli and Palestinian women. She talked to me a lot about <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>calls</b> <b>the</b> 'hope gap' that exists between the one third of the world that has and the two thirds that do not. I wasn't even aware that two thirds of the world population are extremely poor, living on less than a dollar a day, and that 70 percent of those people are women and children. It's not something they teach you in school in the States". Since then, Portman has visited FINCA field projects in Mexico, Guatemala, Uganda, and Ecuador, and met with several members of Congress to argue for more government funding for microfinance ventures.|$|E

Whereupon, we {{must also}} pause, to embank {{ourselves}} somewhat; and before other things, try what we can understand in this name of Frank, concerning which Gibbon tells us, in his sweetest tones of satisfied moral serenity--"The love of liberty was the ruling passion of these Germans. They deserved, they assumed, they maintained, the honourable epithet of Franks, or Freemen." [...] He does not, however, tell us in what language of the time--Chaucian, Sicambrian, Chamavian, or Cattian,--'Frank' ever meant Free: nor can I find out myself what tongue of any time it first belongs to; but I doubt not that Miss Yonge ('History of Christian Names,' Articles on Frey and Frank), gives the true root, in <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>calls</b> <b>the</b> High German [...] "Frang," [...] Free Lord. Not by any means a Free Commoner, or anything of the sort! but a person whose nature and name implied the existence around him, and beneath, of {{a considerable number of}} other persons who were by no means 'Frang,' nor Frangs.

60|$|Exploding, therefore, {{all sorts}} of balances, they avow their design to erect {{themselves}} into a new description of empire, which is not grounded on any balance, but forms a sort of impious hierarchy, of which France {{is to be the}} head and the guardian. The law of this their empire is anything rather than the public law of Europe, the ancient conventions of its several states, or the ancient opinions which assign to them superiority or preëminence of any sort, or any other kind of connection in virtue of ancient relations. They permit, and that is all, the temporary existence of some of the old communities: but whilst they give to these tolerated states this temporary respite, in order to secure them in a condition of real dependence on themselves, they invest them on every side by a body of republics, formed on the model, and dependent ostensibly, as well as substantially, on the will of the mother republic to which they owe their origin. These are to be so many garrisons to check and control the states which are to be permitted to remain on the old model until they are ripe for a change. It is in this manner that France, on her new system, means to form an universal empire, by producing an universal revolution. By this means, forming a new code of communities according to <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>calls</b> <b>the</b> natural rights of man and of states, she pretends to secure eternal peace to the world, guarantied by her generosity and justice, which are to grow with the extent of her power. To talk of the balance of power to the governors of such a country was a jargon which they could not understand even through an interpreter. Before men can transact any affair, they must have a common language to speak, and some common, recognized principles on which they can argue; otherwise all is cross purpose and confusion. It was, therefore, an essential preliminary to the whole proceeding, to fix whether the balance of power, the liberties and laws of the Empire, and the treaties of different belligerent powers in past times, when they put an end to hostilities, were to be considered as the basis of the present negotiation.|$|E
