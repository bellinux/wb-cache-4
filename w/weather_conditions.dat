5|$|A similar {{situation}} occurred in New Zealand, where the song hit {{number one in}} the early winter of 2007 as the country was experiencing some of the worst storms in its history. During the <b>weather</b> <b>conditions,</b> Taranaki, Tauranga, and Auckland had experienced tornadoes and flooding in the Far North of the country. Once the single was replaced on the top spot, <b>weather</b> <b>conditions</b> throughout New Zealand pacified, although Hawke's Bay was still stormy.|$|E

Pullman became a key location to reflect this theme, having several settings, including the town's historic Florence Hotel, easily redressed by the crew for the film.

5|$|It was {{not until}} the {{invention}} of the electric telegraph in 1835 that the modern age of weather forecasting began. Before that, the fastest that distant weather reports could travel was around 100 miles per day (160km/d), but was more typically 40–75 miles per day (60–120km/day) (whether by land or by sea). By the late 1840s, the telegraph allowed reports of <b>weather</b> <b>conditions</b> from a wide area to be received almost instantaneously, allowing forecasts to be made from knowledge of <b>weather</b> <b>conditions</b> further upwind.|$|E

50|$|The Value of {{imperfect}} {{information on}} <b>Weather</b> <b>Condition,</b> however, captures {{the value of}} being able to know the outcome of another related uncertainty, e.g., Weather Forecast, instead of <b>Weather</b> <b>Condition</b> itself before making Vacation Activity decision. It is quantified as the highest price the decision-maker is willing to pay for being able to know Weather Forecast before making Vacation Activity decision.
