5|$|Four young <b>West</b> <b>Indian</b> men, Roy Hackett, Owen Henry, Audley Evans and Prince Brown, {{formed an}} action group, later {{to be called}} the <b>West</b> <b>Indian</b> Development Council. They were unhappy with the lack of {{progress}} in fighting discrimination by the <b>West</b> <b>Indian</b> Association. Owen Henry had met Paul Stephenson, whose father was from West Africa, and who had been to college. The group decided that the articulate Stephenson would be their spokesman. Stephenson set up a test case to prove the colour bar existed by arranging an interview with the bus company for Guy Bailey, a young warehouseman and Boys' Brigade officer. When Stephenson told the company that Bailey was <b>West</b> <b>Indian,</b> the interview was cancelled. Inspired by the refusal of Rosa Parks to give up her seat on a bus in Alabama and the ensuing Montgomery Bus Boycott in the United States in 1955, the activists decided on a bus boycott in Bristol.|$|E

5000|$|Flint is also {{showing a}} {{possible}} historical {{alternative to the}} [...] "Trail of Tears," [...] in which the Southern Indian tribes, in particular the Cherokees, were forced {{to give up their}} land and move to Indian Territory with little more than the clothes on their backs. Flint believes a conflict between these tribes and white Southerners was unavoidable, so he's created a logical scenario in which the tribes move willingly with their wealth and strength intact. In this scenario, the enslavement and oppression of African and Native Americans may end decades before the American Civil War and the wars with the <b>West's</b> <b>Indian</b> tribes. Flint presumably will explore this theme in further detail in sequel(s) to this book.|$|R
