The opening sequence was filmed outside at night, though the subsequent sceneLucy's interrogation and executionoccurred in a motel set constructed on a sound stage. Atypical to the series, the motel room {{did not have a}} noticeable theme. Production designer John Marcynuk commented, [...] "That motel room was essentially a killing floor for the boys...and {{it was kind of a}} cold interrogation scene, so we tried to keep it not so friendly. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>walked</b> through it, it definitely felt like a place [...] a murder had been committed. It wouldn't have been the first time a murder had been committed in that room, either. It was the type of place where bad things happen." [...] Marcynuk took a different approach for Gordon's death scene, utilizing green tones and a cool color palette to create a greater visual contrast with the blood.|$|E

When he was 11, a guest who came to visit his elder brother ignored the young Yu Fan when he walked past him. Yu Fan later wrote to the guest, [...] "I heard that amber does not contain rotten plant {{material}} and that magnets do not attract bent needles. Is it not appropriate for you to ignore me <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>walked</b> past me?" [...] The guest was very surprised after reading Yu Fan's letter. Yu Fan attracted greater attention after this incident.|$|E
2500|$|Later {{during the}} 1980s, Rather gained further renown for his {{forceful}} and skeptical {{reporting on the}} Iran-Contra affair, which eventually led to an on-air confrontation with then Vice President George H. W. Bush: Bush referred to Rather's [...] "dead air incident" [...] saying, [...] "I {{want to talk about}} why I want to be President, why those 41 percent of the people are supporting me. And I don't think it's fair to judge my whole career by a rehash on Iran. How would you like it if I judged your career by those seven minutes <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>walked</b> off the set in New York?" [...] Rather ignored Bush's comment.|$|E

2500|$|On September 11, 1987, Rather {{walked off}} the set in anger just before a remote Evening News {{broadcast}} from Miami, where Pope John Paul II had begun a rare U.S. tour, when a U.S. Open tennis match was being broadcast into the time scheduled for the newscast. He was upset that the news was being cut into {{to make room for}} sports and discussed it with the sports department. The Steffi Graf–Lori McNeil tennis match coverage then ended sooner than expected at 6:32p.m., but Rather had disappeared. (CBS Sports had finally agreed to break away immediately after the match without commentary.) [...] Thus, over 100 affiliates were forced to broadcast six minutes of dead air. The next day, Rather apologized for leaving the anchor desk. The following year, when Rather asked then Vice President Bush about his role in the Iran–Contra affair during a live interview, Bush responded by saying, [...] "Dan, how would you like it if I judged your entire career by those seven minutes <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>walked</b> off the set in New York?" ...|$|E
