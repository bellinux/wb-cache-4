5|$|At present, {{the orphanage}} has been heavily vandalised, with {{surrounding}} residents regularly {{calling the police}} because the sounds of windows smashing and people entering without permission can be heard and seen frequently. Small grass fires around the building have also been reported. Restorations have been considered by the Goulburn City Council. The council is holding Ferrara accountable for allowing damage at the orphanage, while he {{has come up with}} many development projects for the lot. As a result, city council has not issued Ferrara any development permits until restoration <b>work</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> orphanage is complete.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{to end the}} impasse, Shackleton agreed, in {{a letter}} to Scott dated 17 May 1907, to <b>work</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east of the 170°W {{meridian}} and therefore to avoid all the familiar Discovery ground. In the end it was a promise that he was unable to keep after his search for alternative landing grounds proved fruitless. With his only other option being to return home, he set up his headquarters at Cape Royds, close to the old Discovery base. For this he was roundly condemned by the British polar establishment at the time.|$|E
5|$|For most of {{his career}} Harrison was obliged to earn a living by {{conducting}} and other musical <b>work,</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> detriment of his composing. In early 1913 he was engaged as a répétiteur at Covent Garden, where he had the opportunity of observing Arthur Nikisch prepare Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen. Later that year Harrison was appointed to the conducting staff for the season. In 1914 he was assistant conductor to Nikisch and Felix Weingartner in Paris, rehearsing Parsifal for the former and Tristan und Isolde for the latter.|$|E

5|$|Hergé took up {{painting}} as a hobby, producing abstract art works which {{were influenced by}} the styles of Joan Miró and Serge Poliakoff. He showed his <b>work</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> art historian Léo Van Puyvelde, who was the chief conservator of the Musées des Beaux-Arts, who believed that they showed promise but that Hergé's real talent lay with cartoon drawing. Hergé abandoned painting shortly after, having produced 37 paintings in all.|$|E
5|$|In 1704, Keiser, seeking {{refuge from}} his creditors, {{temporarily}} left Hamburg for Weissenfels in Saxony, near {{to his hometown}} Teuchern. He took with him his donkey and his most recent opera composition, Almira, a setting of a libretto by Friedrich Christian Feustking, thus denying this <b>work</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Gänsemarkt—Keiser produced it in Weissenfels in July 1704. In these circumstances the temporary management turned to the 19-year-old Handel and requested a fresh setting of Feustking's libretto. Handel complied; his version was premiered at the Gänsemarkt on 8 January 1705, and ran for 20 performances—a marked success.|$|E
5|$|King James VI visited Doune on occasion, and in 1581 {{authorised}} £300 to {{be spent}} on repairs and improvements, the works being carried out by the master mason Michael Ewing under the supervision of Robert Drummond of Carnock, Master of <b>Work</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Crown of Scotland. In 1593, a plot against James was discovered, and the King surprised the conspirators, who included the Earls of Montrose and Gowrie, at Doune Castle.|$|E

5|$|Six months later, Jacob flies {{back to the}} United Kingdom for the appeal, but it is rejected. With their {{relationship}} compromised and no hope of resolving the visa issue, Anna and Jacob begin to fight with each other out of jealousy and frustration. Jacob {{goes back to the}} US, and Samantha. Anna eventually gets promoted at <b>work</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> position of editor—something she wanted very much. Her love life, however, is not as positive or fulfilling—her new boyfriend Simon (Charlie Bewley) does not evoke the same feelings in her as Jacob, whom she still misses.|$|E
5|$|The German singer experimented a new {{direction}} for her music in 1991, when she recorded the album True at Heart in country music haven Nashville, Tennessee, with local musicians and mainstream producer Barry Beckett.

New band members Michael Tyrrell on guitar, Jeff Bruno on guitar and keyboards, and Tony Mac on drums were recruited for the following European tour.|$|E

5|$|The SR class LN or Lord Nelson {{class is}} a type of 4-cylinder 4-6-0 steam {{locomotive}} designed for the Southern Railway by Richard Maunsell in 1926. They were intended for Continental boat trains between London (Victoria) and Dover harbour, but were also later used for express passenger <b>work</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> South-West of England. Sixteen of them were constructed, representing the most powerful (although not the most successful) Southern 4-6-0 design. They were all named after famous admirals.|$|E
5|$|After {{the release}} {{and success of}} Fritz the Cat, several {{animated}} films meant for adults rather than children enjoyed success. Fritz, a film based on a character created by artist and illustrator Robert Crumb, was the first animated movie to receive an X rating in the United States. Charles Swenson developed Down and Dirty Duck as a project for former The Mothers of Invention band members Kaylan and Volman under the title Cheap! Had the film been released under this title, as director Mick Garris notes, the title would have been Roger Corman's Cheap! However, Roger Corman observed the title as a shot at his production techniques, and asked that the title be changed. The film's production budget was $110,000. According to Swenson, he created {{almost all of the}} animation himself, although publicity attributed the animation <b>work</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Murakami-Wolf Production Company, with Academy Award Winning animator Fred Wolf, credited as his son's name, Bill Wolf, helped animate parts of the film personally. Although the film was promoted as an X-rated animated film, New World Pictures had not actually submitted it to the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA). The film was also promoted as Dirty Duck, although the title on the film itself reads Down and Dirty Duck.|$|E
5|$|As Anderson {{remained}} {{throughout her}} life evasive {{about the details}} of her life as a commercial writer, it is not known when she began writing commercially under pseudonyms, what those pseudonyms were, or, indeed, how much she wrote. She revealed only that she began writing for magazines and newspapers out of commercial necessity, and rarely under her own name. Although she achieved success later in this field, she sometimes stated that, as her writing improved, her pieces were more frequently turned down for publication. In her thirties, she began to write for commercial radio. Beginning with half-hour slots, Anderson gradually became interested in the technique of crafting radio plays, and began submitting some of her better <b>work</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ABC under her own name. She later ascribed her fondness for writing the expansive dialogue in her novels to her early experience writing radio plays.|$|E

5|$|During the Napoleonic Wars, {{the castle}} was armed with nine 36-pounder guns, {{supported}} by further artillery batteries placed along the beach. To protect Deal, units of infantry and cavalry, called fencibles, were formed in 1794 by William Pitt the Younger– then both the Prime Minister and the Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports– and in 1802 units of bombardiers recruited by Pitt carried out military exercises at the castle. The politician and banker Lord Carrington carried out {{improvements to the}} castle in 1802, apparently as a rival project to his friend Pitt's work at Walmer. According to Samuel Wilberforce, Carrington had hoped to charge {{the cost of the}} <b>work</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Treasury, but when he attempted to submit the claims, they were rejected by Pitt and he had to pay for the improvements himself.|$|E
5|$|Frusciante {{continued}} {{to collaborate with}} his friend Omar Rodríguez-López.

The film debuted at the Rotterdam Film Festival in February 2010. Along with work on the film, Frusciante and Rodríguez-López have released two collaborative records in May 2010. The first is the album Omar Rodriguez-Lopez & John Frusciante, an album with {{just the two of}} them, the other a quartet record, Sepulcros de Miel, consisting of Rodríguez-López, Frusciante, Juan Alderete and Marcel Rodríguez-López.|$|E
5|$|Holby City {{has earned}} various awards and {{nominations}}, with the nominations in categories ranging from Best Drama to its writing and editing <b>work</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cast's acting performance. It received nominations for seven awards from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTAs), winning the Best Continuing Drama in the 2008 British Academy Television Awards — {{an award for}} which it was unsuccessfully nominated in for three years prior to winning and three years after winning. Despite being the most shortlisted Holby City actress, Amanda Mealing (who portrayed Connie Beauchamp) did not win any awards. Jimmy Akingbola was the most acclaimed actor from the series, winning two awards for his role as Antoine Malick. Rebecca Wojciechowski is {{the only member of the}} show's production team to win an accolade; she won a Writers' Guild of Great Britain award in 2015.

5|$|In February 1959, Hawker had {{completed}} practically {{all of the}} design work and thus passed the entirety of its manufacturing design <b>work</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> company's Experimental Design Office at Kingston, London. In April 1959, the Ministry of Supply formally issued a contract for {{the completion of a}} pair of P.1127 prototypes. However, there were critics amongst the Air Staff of the project, typically disliking the P.1127 for its subsonic speeds, favouring supersonic-capable aircraft instead; Mason attributes this as having caused considerable delay in the issuing of a contract to Hawker. On 23 July 1959, Hawker authorised the application of maximum effort to complete the development of the P.1127.|$|E

5|$|Lakkanna Dandesa, the king's prime {{minister}} and provincial governor, wrote an encyclopaedia on the beliefs and rites of the Veerashaiva faith titled Sivatattva Chintamani.

Numerous references are made in this <b>work</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> capital city of Vijayanagara and its suburbs. Jakkanarya, a minister in the court, not only wrote Nurondusthala (one hundred and one stories) but also was patron to Kumarabanka Natha and Mahalinga Deva, poet-saints who wrote vachana poems and books on the Shaiva philosophy (called shatsthala). Other writers of the 15th century worthy of mention are Kavi Linga (1490), court poet of King Saluva NarasimhaI, Adrisappa (Praudaraya Charitra), Bommarasa (Soundara Purana), Kallarasa (Janavasya), Chaturmukha Bommarasa (Revanasiddhesvara Purana), Suranga Kavi (Trisashti Puratanara Charitre), and Nilakanthacharya (Aradhya Charitra), court poet of the Ummattur chieftain Virananjendra.|$|E
