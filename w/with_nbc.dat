Carter gives biographical description of other late-night television personalities, including David Letterman, Jimmy Fallon, Jimmy Kimmel, Craig Ferguson, Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert. As host of Late Night with Conan O'Brien, O'Brien decided to remain <b>with</b> <b>NBC</b> after attempts by ABC and Fox to attract him to their networksas NBC executives had told O'Brien {{that he would}} become host of The Tonight Show after Leno's retirement.

Carter's book contains details of O'Brien's and Leno's contracts, and describes O'Brien's emotional state during the 2010 conflict.

As part of the contract, Fey was to develop a prime-time project to be produced by Broadway Video and NBC Universal. The pilot, directed by Adam Bernstein, centered on Liz Lemon, the head writer of a variety show on NBC, and how she managed her relationships with the show's volatile stars and the new head of the network.

5|$|Several {{professional}} football leagues {{have been formed}} as rival leagues to the NFL. The most successful rival league was the American Football League (AFL), which existed from 1960 to 1969.

The two leagues merged in the 1970 season, and all AFL teams joined the NFL. An earlier league, the All-America Football Conference, was in play from 1946 to 1949. After the league dissolved, two AAFC teams, the Cleveland Browns and the San Francisco 49ers, became members of the NFL; another member, the Baltimore Colts joined the league, but folded after just {{a year in the}} NFL.|$|E
