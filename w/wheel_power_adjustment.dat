Aiming at power output motion of wheel loader duty cycle, 7 means for hybrid wheel loader to save fuel have been proposed; contribution to save fuel and easiness to realize the goal under current technical conditions of each means has also been assessed. It is considered that there are two categories of wheel loader energy saving technology: one is to increase fuel utilization rate, and the other is improve transmission efficiency of torque converter. However, realizing one of these two aspects can not save fuel ideally; improvement in both aspects will bring satisfactory energy materials saving effects...|$|R

30|$|The main {{objective}} {{now is to}} estimate the exact amount of power {{to be used by}} each interfering femtocell for the adjustment purpose. To resolve this problem, we propose two <b>power</b> <b>adjustment</b> strategies baptized global <b>power</b> <b>adjustment</b> (GPA) and selective <b>power</b> <b>adjustment</b> (SPA). GPA and SPA offer a different degree of awareness of FUE performance and consequently impacts the MUE performance as well due to the tradeoff between their conflicting requirements in terms of spectral efficiency. More specifically, GPA and SPA implement a different selection mechanism of the interfering femtocells which are to apply the <b>power</b> <b>adjustment</b> and the amount of the <b>power</b> <b>adjustment</b> (increase or decrease). Besides, the associated <b>power</b> <b>adjustment</b> parameters to be introduced hereafter offer an additional leverage in managing the compromise between FUE and MUE performances.|$|R

30|$|Proof. For a {{receiving}} UE (e.g., i), the computational {{complexity of}} selecting the first relay (see lines 4 to 12 in Algorithm  1) is O(|Vi|), {{while the second}} relay selection (see lines 15 to 20 in Algorithm  1) takes time O(max{|Vj||j∈Vi}). In the coarse <b>power</b> <b>adjustment</b> (i.e., Algorithm  2), the computational complexity of the receiving UE is O(1), while it is O(x) in the fine <b>power</b> <b>adjustment</b> (i.e., Algorithm  3) since the <b>power</b> <b>adjustment</b> game process are iterated x times. Hence, the resulting computational complexity of a receiving UE (e.g., i) is O({max{|Vi|, x, max{|Vj||j∈Vi}}).|$|R
