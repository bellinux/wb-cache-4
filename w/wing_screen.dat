40|$|There is a 2. 5 -fold {{difference}} in male wing size between two haplodiploid insect species, Nasonia vitripennis and N. giraulti. The haploidy of males facilitated a full genomic screen for quantitative trait loci (QTL) affecting wing {{size and the}} detection of epistatic interactions. A QTL analysis of the interspecific wing-size difference revealed QTL with major effects and epistatic interactions among loci affecting the trait. We analyzed 178 hybrid males and initially found two major QTL for wing length, one for wing width, three for a normalized wing-size variable, and five for wing seta density. One QTL for wing width explains 38. 1 % of the phenotypic variance, and the same QTL explains 22 % of the phenotypic variance in normalized wing size. This corresponds to a region previously introgressed from N. giraulti into N. vitripennis that accounts for 44 % of the normalized wing-size difference between the species. Significant epistatic interactions were also found that affect wing size and density of setae on the <b>wing.</b> <b>Screening</b> for pairwise epistatic interactions between loci on different linkage groups revealed four additional loci for wing length and four loci for normalized wing size that were not detected in the original QTL analysis. We propose that the evolution of smaller wings in N. vitripennis males is primarily the result of major mutations at few genomic regions and involves epistatic interactions among some loci...|$|R

40|$|The decapentaplegic (dpp) gene directs {{numerous}} developmental {{events in}} Drosophila melanogaster. dpp encodes {{a member of}} the Transforming Growth Factor-beta family of secreted signaling molecules. At this time, mechanisms of dpp signaling have not yet been fully described. Therefore we conducted a genetic screen for new dpp signaling pathway components. The screen exploited a transvection-dependent dpp phenotype: heldout <b>wings.</b> The <b>screen</b> generated 30 mutations that appear to disrupt transvection at dpp. One of the mutations is a translocation with a recessive lethal breakpoint in cytological region 23 C 1 - 2. Genetic analyses identified a number of mutations allelic to this breakpoint. The 23 C 1 - 2 complementation group includes several mutations in the newly discovered gene lilliputian (lilli). lilli mutations that disrupt the transvection-dependent dpp phenotype are also dominant maternal enhancers of recessive embryonic lethal alleles of dpp and screw. lilli zygotic mutant embryos exhibit a partially ventralized phenotype similar to dpp embryonic lethal mutations. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that lilli encodes the only Drosophila member of a family of transcription factors that includes the human genes causing Fragile-X mental retardation (FMR 2) and Burkitt's Lymphoma (LAF 4). Taken together, the genetic and phylogenetic data suggest that lilli may be an activator of dpp expression in embryonic dorsal-ventral patterning and wing development...|$|R
40|$|Drosophila Tribbles (Trbl) is the {{founding}} member of the Trib family of kinase-like docking proteins that modulate cell signaling during proliferation, migration and growth. In a <b>wing</b> misexpression <b>screen</b> for Trbl interacting proteins, we identified the Ser/Thr protein kinase Akt 1. Given the central role of Akt 1 in insulin signaling, we tested the function of Trbl in larval fat body, a tissue where rapid increases in size are exquisitely sensitive to insulin/insulin-like growth factor levels. Consistent with a role in antagonizing insulin-mediated growth, trbl RNAi knockdown in the fat body increased cell size, advanced the timing of pupation and increased levels of circulating triglyceride. Complementarily, overexpression of Trbl reduced fat body cell size, decreased overall larval size, delayed maturation and lowered levels of triglycerides, while circulating glucose levels increased. The conserved Trbl kinase domain is required for function in vivo and for interaction with Akt in a yeast two-hybrid assay. Consistent with direct regulation of Akt, overexpression of Trbl in the fat body decreased levels of activated Akt (pSer 505 -Akt) while misexpression of trbl RNAi increased phospho-Akt levels, and neither treatment affected total Akt levels. Trbl misexpression effectively suppressed Akt-mediated wing and muscle cell size increases and reduced phosphorylation of the Akt target FoxO (pSer 256 -FoxO). Taken together, these data show that Drosophila Trbl has a conserved role to bind Akt and block Akt-mediated insulin signaling, and implicate Trib proteins a...|$|R

To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms that coordinate cell polarity with tissue growth, we screened a boutique collection of RNAi stocks targeting the kinome for their capacity to modify Drosophila " cell polarity" eye and wing phenotypes. Initially, we identified kinase or phosphatase genes whose depletion modified adult eye phenotypes associated with the manipulation of cell polarity complexes (via overexpression of Crb or aPKC). We next conducted a secondary screen to test whether these cell polarity modifiers altered tissue overgrowth associated with depletion of Lgl in the <b>wing.</b> These <b>screens</b> identified Hippo, Jun kinase (JNK), and Notch signaling pathways, previously linked to cell polarity regulation of tissue growth. Furthermore, novel pathways not previously connected to cell polarity regulation of tissue growth were identified, including Wingless (Wg/Wnt), Ras, and lipid/Phospho-inositol- 3 -kinase (PI 3 K) signaling pathways. Additionally, we demonstrated that the " nutrient sensing" kinases Salt Inducible Kinase 2 and 3 (SIK 2 and 3) are potent modifiers of cell polarity phenotypes and regulators of tissue growth. Overall, our screen has revealed novel cell polarity-interacting kinases and phosphatases that affect tissue growth, providing a platform for investigating molecular mechanisms coordinating cell polarity and tissue growth during development...|$|R

40|$|The two-stream {{model of}} visual {{processing}} describes {{a distinction between}} vision for ‘perception’ and vision for ‘action’. The inability of visual illusions (for example, the Ebbinghaus illusion) to affect grasping actions despite affecting manual estimation {{has been used as}} evidence in support of this model, but there remains disagreement about the phenomenon. Moreover, it is unclear how long it takes the brain to process visual illusory information for both grasping and perception. The present study explores these temporal dynamics {{in the context of the}} Muller-Lyer illusion. Participants were presented with rectangular objects surrounded by Muller-Lyer illusory <b>wings</b> on a <b>screen</b> for either 50 or 1500 ms, after which visual feedback was removed. In grasping conditions, participants proceeded to reach out and pick up the object, and in perception conditions participants used their thumb and index fingers to indicate the size of the object. Our data show that grasping (maximum grip aperture) was not affected by the Muller-Lyer illusion regardless of exposure duration but manual estimation was affected only after a long exposure duration. This suggests the existence of a threshold above 50 ms at which the perceptual system begins to integrate stimulus information with surrounding contextual information. Additionally, the inability of the Muller-Lyer illusion to affect prehension and not estimation provides further evidence for the two-stream model of visual processing...|$|R
40|$|This chapter situates {{a special}} {{stand-alone}} episode of The West Wing ‘Isaac and Ishmael’, within the broader {{context of the}} emerging ‘War on Terror’, arguing that the show {{played an important role}} in communicating terrorism for the American public and in narrowing the space for debate in the wake of 9 / 11. To make this argument, the episode is analysed through a discourse analysis as part of the evolving approach to the screening of terror adopted in The West Wing. It is argued that The West <b>Wing’s</b> approach to <b>screening</b> terror responded to the context of the moment before during and after the events of September 11 th. This response equated to a worrying reinforcement of dominant discourses. To demonstrate this reinforcement and its impact, the chapter is organised in three sections.

40|$|Abstract Background Cul 1 is a core {{component}} of the evolutionarily conserved SCF-type ubiquitin ligases that target specific proteins for destruction. SCF action contributes to cell cycle progression but few of the key targets of its action have been identified. Results We found that expression of the mouse Cul 1 (mCul 1) in the larval wing disc has a dominant negative effect. It reduces, but does not eliminate, the function of SCF complexes, promotes accumulation of Cubitus interruptus (a target of SCF action), triggers apoptosis, and causes a small <b>wing</b> phenotype. A <b>screen</b> for mutations that dominantly modify this phenotype showed effective suppression upon reduction of E 2 F function, suggesting that compromised downregulation of E 2 F contributes to the phenotype. Partial inactivation of Cul 1 delayed the abrupt loss of E 2 F immunofluorescence beyond its normal point of downregulation {{at the onset of}} S phase. Additional screens showed that mild reduction in function of the F-box encoding gene slimb enhanced the mCul 1 overexpression phenotype. Cell cycle modulation of E 2 F levels is virtually absent in slimb mutant cells in which slimb function is severely reduced. This implicates Slimb, a known targeting subunit of SCF, in E 2 F downregulation. In addition, Slimb and E 2 F interacted in vitro in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Conclusion We have used genetic and physical interactions to identify the G 1 /S transcription factor E 2 F as an SCF Slmb target in Drosophila. These results argue that the SCF Slmb ubiquitin ligase directs E 2 F destruction in S phase. </p...|$|R
40|$|Title from PDF {{of title}} page, viewed on October 19, 2015 Dissertation advisor: Leonard DobensVitaIncludes bibliographic {{references}} (pages 111 - 127) Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] School of Biological Sciences. University of Missouri [...] Kansas City, 2015 In this dissertation, I examined the molecular mechanism of {{function of the}} Drosophila melanogaster protein Tribbles (Trbl) during oogenesis and larval development. Trbl is the founding member of an evolutionarily conserved family of kinase proteins that play diverse roles in cell signaling and energy homeostasis. In addition to the central Serine/Threonine kinase domain, members of the Tribbles gene family (Trib) shares C terminal mitogen activated protein kinase kinase MEK 1 and E 3 ubiquitin ligase COP 1 binding motifs, the latter required for the degradation of target proteins via proteasome. During oogenesis, Trbl controls border cell (BC) cluster migration by mediating degradation of C/EBP transcription factor Slbo. I first investigated Trbl’s role during oogenesis using a Trbl specific antisera. Trbl localizes to the nucleus of main body follicle cells (MBFC) up to stage 10 of oogenesis. In the case of BC, Trbl expresses in a complementary pattern to Slbo expression. The Trbl level decreases gradually as the BC cluster delaminates from the epithelium and starts migrating when Slbo protein level increases. Moreover, Slbo {{was found to be}} essential but not sufficient to decrease the Trbl level required for BC migration. In a <b>wing</b> misexpression <b>screen</b> for Trbl interacting proteins, I identified the Serine/Threonine protein kinase Akt, a major mediator of insulin signaling. In recent years, mammalian Trib 3 and Trib 2 proteins have been implicated in the regulation of Insulin signaling by inhibiting the activating phosphorylation of Akt, Given the central role of Akt in insulin signaling, I tested whether the function of Trib family in insulin signaling is evolutionarily conserved. Using Drosophila larval development as a model system, I found that Trbl has a conserved role in binding and inhibiting Akt phosphorylation-activation, implicating Trib proteins as novel sites of signaling pathway integration that link nutrient availability with cell growth and proliferation. Finally, I have identified a previously unknown motif (R 141) in Trib proteins essential for their function to regulate insulin signaling mediated growth and metabolism.

5000|$|If {{a pass to}} {{the block}} is not possible, the second option is either to pass to the weak-side guard who flashes top of the key from the weak-side wing {{position}} or passing to the strong-side corner. If the ball is passed to the corner the options are either shoot, pass to the strong-side block, or pick and pop with the wing. If it is passed to the weak-side guard it initiates the [...] "pinch post" [...] option. There are two options. The first and most common is to pass to the weak-side forward who flashes to the elbow (corner of the key at the free throw line) to receive the pass. When he does the options are a rub handoff, back door cut by guard without the ball, post up of the guard on a smaller player, or face up and attack. The second option is a pick and roll with the forward. The advantage to the first option is {{there are so many}} weapons to attack the defense it opens up a lot of freedom and ability to score effectively. The advantage on the second option is that the player who has the ball and uses the screen now has the entire side of the floor to work with to go one on one. Meanwhile, on the other side, the <b>wing</b> sets a <b>screen</b> for the corner guard on the triangle split. If the hand-off is not available, the forward or the guard can pass to the corner guard coming off the screen. If the defense overplays or expects the split, both the wing and the corner guard can back cut to the basket. During all of this time the original strong-side block player is able to establish position for an easy shot while the defender is lured by all of the movement and cutting by the other players.|$|R
500|$|On 9 August 1942, Ledbury sailed from Gibraltar, sighted {{the convoy}} in the afternoon, and took its convoy {{screening}} station. An hour before midnight on 10 August {{she left the}} convoy and proceeded to refuel from the tanker Dingledale, an operation that took place {{early in the morning}} of 11 August. Ledbury took aboard 101 tons of fuel. Just before ten o'clock in the morning, the destroyer took station as starboard <b>wing</b> ship of <b>screen.</b> In the afternoon, [...] was hit by torpedoes, with Derwent ordering Ledbury to stand by the stricken aircraft carrier. As Eagle sank, one destroyer and the tug Jaunty stopped, picking up survivors in the oil patches in the water. As Ledbury reached survivors, she was ordered to rejoin the convoy. The convoy now suffered a series of aerial attacks with the gunner of Ledburys port Oerlikon thought to have shot down one plane, although many other ships were firing at this machine. At 21:00, Ledbury was ordered to Anti-Aircraft station, with one cable on the starboard beam of No. 43. Early on the morning of 12 August, the destroyer was ordered by [...] to investigate a periscope reported on the starboard quarter of No.43. Nelson reported a submarine periscope bearing north of her, and Ledbury deployed single scare charges to cover [...] from this submarine, and destroyers astern of her appeared to follow up this contact. At nine o'clock in the morning, an air attack by Junkers 88s developed on the convoy, with one Junkers 88 crashing at bearing 058 degrees. Four small bombs were seen to go by the bridge, landing on the starboard side, and a large bomb came near the port quarter. In the ensuing mayhem, Ledbury was ordered to fill in gaps in the screen caused by ships falling back on contact. On the way to this position three airmen were seen coming down by parachute. One was picked up and found to be German, the others were abandoned. The captured airman stated that the last raid consisted of Luftwaffe airmen flying Junkers 88s from Sicily; and that he had been shot down by close range weapons from the convoy. Ledburys crew noted that the most interesting thing about the pilot was that the nails of his boots were made of wood. Yet another aerial attack ensued, this time by dive-bombers. Two groups approached from ahead, but neither got over the convoy. Two of these planes were shot down by gunfire. After this attack, the destroyer resumed station on the starboard side of the convoy. An attack by Junkers 88s soon started whilst escort fighters were still refuelling. Ledbury suffered another near miss off her port quarter. One ship in the convoy was damaged, and [...] stood by her.|$|R
