She and Jude {{fall in love}} ("If I Fell"), while Max is drafted into the army ("I Want You (She's So Heavy)"). Prudence is attracted to Sadie, and becomes depressed when Sadie and Jojo begin a relationship. Prudence locks herself in a closet {{and has to be}} coaxed out of the closet (literally and figuratively) by her friends ("Dear Prudence"), then disappears after wandering off during a peace rally at which Paco, the leader of the Students for a Democratic Republic (SDR), is a speaker.|$|E

"Jesus, Friend of Sinners" [...] "admonishes the Christian {{church to}} show compassion" [...] and [...] "laments {{how the world}} knows many Christ {{followers}} more by what they are against than what they are for". Although Hall called the song [...] "one of the more direct songs [...] written", he said [...] "it also speaks truth.

500|$|... "Why Don't <b>We</b> <b>Do</b> <b>It</b> <b>in</b> the Road?" [...] {{was written}} by McCartney in India after he saw two monkeys copulating {{in the street and}} {{wondered}} why humans were too civilised to do the same. He played all the instruments except drums, which were contributed by Starr. The simple lyric was very much in Lennon's style, and Lennon was annoyed about not being asked to play on it. McCartney suggested it was [...] "tit for tat" [...] as he had not contributed to [...] "Revolution 9".|$|E
5000|$|In February 2011 David Bennett, newly {{appointed}} Chair of Monitor, said the NHS could become like other privatised utilities, so that Monitor would potentially be a regulator like Ofcom, Ofgem and Ofwat: [...] "We, in the UK, {{have done this}} in other sectors before. <b>We</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> gas, <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> power, <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> telecoms … We've <b>done</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> rail, we've <b>done</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> water, so there's actually 20 {{years of experience in}} taking monopolistic, monolithic markets and providers and exposing them to economic regulation." [...] The House of Commons Select Committee on Health condemned the comparison as not [...] "accurate or helpful." ...|$|R

500|$|Avatar {{has been}} called [...] "without a doubt the most epic piece of {{environmental}} advocacy ever captured on celluloid.... The film hits all the important environmental talking-points—virgin rain forests threatened by wanton exploitation, indigenous peoples who have much to teach the developed world, a planet which functions as a collective, interconnected Gaia-istic organism, and evil corporate interests {{that are trying to}} destroy it all." [...] Cameron has spoken extensively with the media about the film's environmental message, saying that he envisioned Avatar as a broader metaphor of how we treat the natural world. [...] He said that he created Pandora as [...] "a fictionalised fantasy version of what our world was like, before we started to pave it and build malls, and shopping centers. [...] So it's really an evocation of the world we used to have." [...] He told Charlie Rose that [...] "we are going to go through a lot of pain and heartache if we don't acknowledge our stewardship responsibilities to nature." [...] Interviewed by Terry Gross of National Public Radio, he called Avatar a satire on the sense of human entitlement: [...] " [...] is saying our attitude about indigenous people and our entitlement about what is rightfully theirs is the same sense of entitlement that lets us bulldoze a forest and not blink an eye. It's just human nature that if we can take it, we will. And sometimes <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> a very naked and imperialistic way, and other times <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> a very sophisticated way with lots of rationalization—but it's basically the same thing. A sense of entitlement. And we can't just go on in this unsustainable way, just taking what we want and not giving back." [...] An article in the Belgium paper De Standaard agreed: [...] "It's about the brutality of man, who shamelessly takes what isn't his." ...|$|E

Meanwhile, some representatives with the U.S. government were participating in drug use and sexual activity with employees from the very energy firms {{they were to be}} regulating.|$|E
2500|$|Interscope Records has {{released}} three variations of soundtrack {{from the film}} — a standard edition and two deluxe editions. The standard edition contains 16 tracks from the film soundtrack, although [...] "Let It Be" [...] is shortened, missing the third verse. The first version of the deluxe edition features 31 tracks — all of the vocal performances {{and one of the}} three instrumental tracks. In the US, this 31-track version is available solely at Best Buy stores and in a digital version from iTunes, while in Europe it is available at other retail outlets. A second version of the deluxe edition is available at other retail outlets and digital download suppliers. The second version differs from the 31-track version in that it omits two tracks ("Why Don't <b>We</b> <b>Do</b> <b>It</b> <b>in</b> the Road?" [...] and [...] "I Want You (She's So Heavy)").|$|E
2500|$|Leng draws {{parallels}} between [...] "I Dig Love" [...] and the Beatles' more free-form compositions {{of the late}} 1960s. Among these, Paul McCartney's [...] "Why Don't <b>We</b> <b>Do</b> <b>It</b> <b>in</b> the Road?" [...] exemplifies what Ian MacDonald termed in the 1990s the [...] "long-gone let-it-all-hang-out era". In his book Working Class Mystic, Gary Tillery identifies [...] "I Dig Love" [...] as one of two All Things Must Pass tracks (the other being [...] "Wah-Wah") {{that could have been}} sung by John Lennon, whose style increasingly embraced provocative artistic statements following the start of his relationship with Yoko Ono in 1968. Leng also compares [...] "I Dig Love" [...] with [...] "Love the One You're With", a [...] "hymn to hedonism" [...] by Stephen Stills, with whom Harrison worked on Doris Troy's eponymous album for Apple Records, in 1969–70.|$|E

5000|$|The second side of {{the album}} opens with the rocker [...] "Without You". This song, like many others, had begun as a jam.

2500|$|After {{nearly thirty}} {{years away from}} Hollywood, famed special effects {{supervisor}} Douglas Trumbull contributed to the visual effects work on The Tree of Life. Malick, a friend of Trumbull, approached him about the effects work and mentioned {{that he did not}} like the look of computer-generated imagery.

60|$|If you {{ask that}} {{convenient}} fiction, the Man in the Street, {{what sort of}} plant a cactus is, he will probably tell you it is all leaf and no stem, {{and each of the}} leaves grows out of the last one. Whenever we set up the Man in the Street, however, you must have noticed <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> order to knock him down again like a nine-pin next moment: and this particular instance is no exception to the rule; for the truth is that a cactus is practically all stem and no leaves, what looks like a leaf being really a branch sticking out at an angle. The true leaves, if there are any, are reduced to mere spines or prickles on the surface, while the branches, in the prickly-pear and many of the ornamental hot-house cactuses, are flattened out like a leaf to perform foliar functions. In most plants, to put it simply, the leaves are the mouths and stomachs of the organism; their thin and flattened blades are spread out horizontally in a wide expanse, covered with tiny throats and lips which suck in carbonic acid from the surrounding air, and disintegrate it in their own cells under the influence of sunlight. In the prickly pears, on the contrary, it is the flattened stem and branches which undertake this essential operation {{in the life of the}} plant--the sucking-in of carbon and giving-out of oxygen, which is to the vegetable exactly what the eating and digesting of food is to the animal organism. In their old age, however, the stems of the prickly pear display their true character by becoming woody in texture and losing their articulated leaf-like appearance.|$|E
