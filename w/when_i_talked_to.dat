Admirers of the novel include Albert Einstein, Sigmund Freud, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Martin Heidegger, Cormac McCarthy, Kurt Vonnegut, Haruki Murakami, Vladimir Putin, Laura Bush, and Hillary Clinton. C. P. Snow, writing about Einstein's admiration of the novel, wrote, [...] "The Brothers Karamazov - that for him in 1919 was the supreme summit of all literature. It remained so <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> him in 1937, and probably {{until the end of}} his life." [...] Sigmund Freud called it [...] "the most magnificent novel ever written" [...] and was fascinated with the book for its Oedipal themes. In 1928 Freud published a paper titled [...] "Dostoevsky and Parricide" [...] in which he investigated Dostoyevsky's own neuroses. Freud claimed that Dostoyevsky's epilepsy was not a natural condition but instead a physical manifestation of the author's hidden guilt over his father's death. According to Freud, Dostoyevsky (and all other sons) wished for {{the death of his father}} because of latent desire for his mother; and as evidence Freud cites the fact that Dostoyevsky's epileptic fits did not begin until he turned 18, the year his father died. The themes of patricide and guilt, especially in the form of moral guilt illustrated by Ivan Karamazov, would then obviously follow for Freud as literary evidence of this theory.|$|E

Miss Pondar, whose general aspect of minister's wife began to wear off <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> her, mingles respectfulness and respectability in a manner I haven't been {{in the habit of}} seeing.

This is the first spring he has been free from croup; and you would hardly believe what a comfort that cross has been to him. He always feels for the chain, that he may squeeze Aunt Helen's cross. At one time I was almost afraid that it was a superstition, he was such a very little fellow; but <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> him, he said, [...] "I like it because of our Blessed Saviour.

But come along into my tent; you know your troop and ours are going to be joined. We have lost pretty near half our fellows, either in the fights coming up or by sunstroke or fever since we came here.

6000|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> Mary, she said, [...] "Oh yes, I {{always knew}} she was a horrid little treacherous puss. Nature began it, and that governess worked on a ready soil. We sent her to school, and hoped she was cured, but I have long seen that it has only shown her how to be more plausible. But what can one do? One could not turn out an orphan, and I did not {{see that she was}} doing our own girls any harm. I'm sure I gave her every chance of marrying, for there was nothing I wished for so much, and I never told Martyn of her little manoeuvres, knowing he would not stand them; and now what he will do, I can't think, unless you and Edward will take her off our hands. I believe you might do her good. She is an unfathomable mixture of sham and earnest, and she really likes you, and thinks much of you, as having a certain prestige, and being a woman of the world" [...] (fancy that). [...] "Besides, she is really {{religious}} in a sort of a way; much good you'll say it does her, but, as you know, there's a certain sort of devotion which makes no difference to people's conduct." ...|$|E
6000|$|The boy was a queer little fellow, healthy but colourless, with strangely {{beautiful}} grey eyes which, {{on first}} seeing them, almost startled one with their intelligence. He was shy and almost obstinately silent, but <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> him on certain subjects the intense suppressed interest he felt would show itself in his face, and {{by and by}} it would burst out in speech--an impetuous torrent of words in a high shrill voice. He {{reminded me of a}} lark in a cage. Watch it in its prison when the sun shines forth--when, like the captive falcon in Dante, it is [...] "cheated by a gleam"--its wing-tremblings, and all its little tentative motions, how the excitement grows and grows in it, until, although shut up and flight denied it, the passion can no longer be contained and it bursts out in a torrent of shrill and guttural sounds, which, if it were free and soaring, would be its song. His passion was all for nature, and his mother out of her small earnings had managed to get quite a number of volumes together for him. These he read and re-read until he knew them by heart; and on Sundays, or any other day they could take, those two lonely ones would take a basket containing their luncheon, her work and a book or two, and set out on a long ramble along the coast to pass the day in some solitary spot among the sandhills.|$|E

"While {{you were}} asleep the other night," [...] Trafford began one day {{as they sat}} {{spinning}} out their mid-day meal, [...] "I was thinking how badly I had expressed myself <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> you the other day, and what a queer, thin affair I made of the plans I wanted to carry out. As a matter of fact, they're neither queer nor thin, but they are unreal {{in comparison with the}} common things of everyday life, hunger, anger, all the immediate desires. They must be. They only begin when those others are at peace. It's hard to set out these things; they're complicated and subtle, and one cannot simplify without falsehood. I don't want to simplify. The world has gone out of its way time after time through simplifications and short cuts. Save us from epigrams! And when one thinks over what one has said, at a little distance,--one wants to go back to it, and say it all again. I seem to be not so much thinking things out as reviving and developing things I've had growing in my mind ever since we met. It's as though an immense reservoir of thought had filled up in my mind at last and was beginning to trickle over and break down the embankment between us. This conflict that has been going on between our life together and my--my intellectual life; it's only just growing clear in my own mind. Yet it's just as if one turned up a light on something that had always been there....|$|E

6000|$|I {{would speak}} {{first of a}} contrast--and yet I have come to {{recognize}} how impossible it is to convey to the dweller in America the difference in atmosphere between England and France {{on the one hand}} and our country on the other. And when I use the word [...] "atmosphere" [...] I mean the mental state of the peoples as well as the weather and the aspect of the skies. I have referred in another article to the anxious, feverish prosperity one beholds in London and Paris, to that apparent indifference, despite the presence on the streets of crowds of soldiers to the existence of a war of which one is ever aware. Yet, along with this, one is ever conscious of pressure. The air is heavy; there is a corresponding lack of the buoyancy of mind which is the normal American condition. Perhaps, if German troops occupied New England and New York, our own mental barometer might be lower. It is difficult to say. At any rate, after an ocean voyage of nine days one's spirits rise perceptibly as the ship nears Nantucket; and the icy-bright sunlight of New York harbour, the sight of the buildings aspiring to blue skies restore the throbbing optimism which with us is normal; and it was with an effort, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> the reporters on landing, that I was able to achieve and express the pessimism and darkness out of which I had come. Pessimism is perhaps too strong a word, and takes no account of the continued unimpaired morale and determination of the greater part of the British and French peoples. They expect much from us. Yet the impression was instantaneous, when I set forth in the streets of New York, that we had not fully measured the magnitude of our task--an impression that has been amply confirmed as the weeks have passed.|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear Miss Stanley, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> you {{the other}} {{afternoon}} {{of work and}} politics and such-like things, my mind was all the time resenting it beyond measure. There we were discussing whether {{you should have a}} vote, and I remembered the last occasion we met it was about your prospects of success in the medical profession or as a Government official such as a number of women now are, and all the time my heart was crying out within me, 'Here is the Queen of your career.' I wanted, as I have never wanted before, to take you up, to make you mine, to carry you off and set you apart from all the strain and turmoil of life. For nothing will ever convince me {{that it is not the}} man's share in life to shield, to protect, to lead and toil and watch and battle with the world at large. I want to be your knight, your servant, your protector, your--I dare scarcely write the word--your husband. So I come suppliant. I am five-and-thirty, and I have knocked about in the world and tasted the quality of life. I had a hard fight to begin with to win my way into the Upper Division--I was third on a list of forty-seven--and since then I have found myself promoted almost yearly in a widening sphere of social service. Before I met you I never met any one whom I felt I could love, but you have discovered depths in my own nature I had scarcely suspected. Except for a few early ebullitions of passion, natural to a warm and romantic disposition, and leaving no harmful after-effects--ebullitions that by the standards of the higher truth I feel no one can justly cast a stone at, and of which I for one am by no means ashamed--I come to you a pure and unencumbered man. I love you. In addition to my public salary I have a certain private property and further expectations through my aunt, so that I can offer you a life of wide and generous refinement, travel, books, discussion, and easy relations with a circle of clever and brilliant and thoughtful people with whom my literary work has brought me into contact, and of which, seeing me only as you have done alone in Morningside Park, you can have no idea. I have a certain standing not only as a singer but as a critic, and I belong to one of the most brilliant causerie dinner clubs of the day, in which successful Bohemianism, politicians, men of affairs, artists, sculptors, and cultivated noblemen generally, mingle together in the easiest and most delightful intercourse. That is my real milieu, and one that I am convinced you would not only adorn but delight in.|$|E
