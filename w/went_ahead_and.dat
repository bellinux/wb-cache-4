5|$|In 1877 during {{construction}} of the Durley Hill Cemetery, {{the remains of a}} grand Roman villa with over 30 rooms was discovered. However, {{construction of the}} cemetery <b>went</b> <b>ahead,</b> <b>and</b> the majority of the villa is now located beneath the Victorian cemetery and an adjacent road. The cemetery was expanded in 1922, and an archeological dig was carried out ahead of the interments, leading to the excavation of 17 rooms and the rescue of 10 elaborate mosaics.|$|E
5|$|In 2010 it was {{announced}} that Crass would release The Crassical Collection, remastered reissues of their back catalogue. Three former members objected, threatening legal action. Despite their concerns the project <b>went</b> <b>ahead,</b> <b>and</b> the remasters were eventually released. First in the series was The Feeding of the 5000, released in August 2010. Stations of the Crass followed in October, with new editions of Penis Envy, Christ – The Album, Yes Sir, I Will and Ten Notes on a Summer's Day released in 2011 and 2012. Critics praised the improved sound quality and new packaging of the remastered albums.|$|E

The band had originally planned to release the marching band version after the debut of the Rube Goldberg video. However, they found time during October 2009 to work with the Notre Dame band, and realizing the length of time to complete the Rube Goldberg machine, <b>went</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> completed the marching band version.|$|E

5|$|Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis paired {{up to do}} slapstick comedy for {{the first}} time at the 500 Club on July 25, 1946. While Martin was trying to get gigs as a singer, Lewis {{performed}} as a comedian at the club. One night a different act failed to show up and Lewis suggested to the owner that he hire Martin to do comedy with him. The owner was skeptical, but the two <b>went</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> tried to devise an act on paper in their hotel room, which did not work. The next night, they went on stage and improvised for three hours, bringing the house down. The comedy duo of Martin and Lewis was popular in nightclubs and in film from 1946 to 1956.|$|E
5|$|Rindt was {{pronounced}} dead {{on the way to}} hospital and Lotus withdrew all cars from the race, including the Lotus 72 entered by Rob Walker. The Grand Prix <b>went</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> Clay Regazzoni took his maiden victory, but celebrations were muted. There was a lengthy investigation into Rindt's death in Italy, leading to a trial against Colin Chapman; he was cleared of all charges in 1976. The destroyed Lotus 72 remained in Italy after the trial, going to a scrapyard near Monza. In 1985, a real estate agent found the wreckage and bought it from the authorities, later trading it in 1993 for a Lola Formula 3 car. Since then, the car has rested in a garage near Milan.|$|E
5|$|Thompson was {{involved}} in a similar suit in Alabama in 2005 on behalf of the families of police personnel killed by Devin Moore, a teenager who was reportedly a compulsive Grand Theft Auto player. The lawyer's participation in the case, however, ran into a dispute over his pro hac vice, or temporary, admission to practice in that state. The opposing attorneys sought removal of the privilege by arguing that Thompson's conduct was unethical and claiming that he had threatened and harassed them in letters and emails. The judge added that Thompson had violated his gag order during Moore’s criminal trial. Thompson tried to withdraw from the case, but his request was denied by the judge, who <b>went</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> revoked Thompson's temporary admission to the state bar.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the bridge}} {{remained}} in service for another 21 {{years as a}} free crossing, the Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission constructed a brand new bridge at the Portland-Columbia. The new toll bridge was constructed in 1953 for $4 million (1953 USD, equal to $ today), but the toll was only one quarter (equal to $ today), like the former price of the Darlington's Bridge. Darlington, who had retired from his job in Orange in 1950, was alive and was in disbelief. The next April, the Toll Bridge Commission <b>went</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> dismantled the bridge made useful by Darlington, which was fought by several legal actions. The bridge ceased operations on April 3, 1954, being demolished soon after. The covered bridge at Columbia was destroyed during Hurricane Diane the next August. Just before the demolishing of the Darlington's Bridge, the approach on the New Jersey side had been renumbered to State Highway Route 163, which remains in condition from when the bridge was in use.|$|E
5|$|In January 1971, with Bobby Moore, Brian Dear and Clyde Best, Greaves was {{involved}} in late-night drinking, against the wishes of manager Ron Greenwood, prior to an FA Cup tie away to Blackpool. On arriving in Blackpool, Greaves and his teammates had been informed {{by members of the}} press that the game, the following day, was unlikely to go ahead due to a frozen pitch and the likelihood of frost that night. Believing {{that there would be no}} game the following day, Greaves drank 12 lagers in a club owned by Brian London and did not return to the team hotel until 1.45am. In fact, the match <b>went</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> West Ham lost 4–0. Greaves claimed the defeat was not a result of the late night, the drinking or the frozen pitch, but because the West Ham team in which he was playing was not good enough. As a result, the players were fined and dropped by the club.|$|E
5|$|Sir Thomas Lewknor was a {{supporter}} of the House of Lancaster during the Wars of the Roses, which began in 1455. When Richard of the House of York ascended to the throne as Richard III in 1483, Lewknor was accused of treason and of raising men-at-arms in southeast England. In November 1483, Lewknor's uncle and Thomas Howard, the Earl of Surrey, were given permission to levy men and besiege Bodiam Castle, where Lewknor was based. It is not recorded whether the siege <b>went</b> <b>ahead,</b> <b>and</b> Thackray suggests that Lewknor surrendered without much resistance. His property was confiscated, and Nicholas Rigby was made constable of the castle. On Henry VII's accession to the English throne the attainder was revoked, and Bodiam Castle was returned to Lewknor. However, not all the surrounding land was returned to the family until 1542. Possession of Bodiam Castle passed through several generations of the Lewknor family. Although the inheritance of the castle can be traced through the 16th and 17th centuries, there is little to indicate how it was used in this period, or if the family spent much time in it.|$|E

Even before it was delivered in December 1913, the APK <b>went</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> ordered a second example in February 1913. The first howitzer was demonstrated to Kaiser Wilhelm II in March 1914, who was greatly taken by the new weapon, and the second was delivered in June 1914.|$|E

25|$|The 1976 All Blacks tour of South Africa <b>went</b> <b>ahead,</b> <b>and</b> the Springboks won {{by three}} Tests to one, but coming {{shortly after the}} Soweto riots the tour {{attracted}} international condemnation. Twenty eight countries boycotted the 1976 Summer Olympics in protest, and in 1977 the Gleneagles Agreement discouraged any Commonwealth sporting contact with South Africa. In response to the growing pressure, the segregated South African rugby unions merged in 1977. A planned 1979 Springbok tour of France was blocked by the French government.|$|E

One of the worst ever floods of the region threatened to ruin the tournament. However, the tournament eventually <b>went</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> the Bangladesh Cricket Board promised to donate 10% of the gate money to the Prime Minister's Fund for flood relief.|$|E
25|$|Following an {{agreement}} to leave a short section {{at one end of}} the tunnel untreated, and more sympathetic treatment of the rest of the tunnel, the work <b>went</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> the route reopened– much later than originally anticipated– in 1998. The tunnel closed again from 23 December 2007 to permit tracklaying and resignalling for the East London Line extension. The extension work resulted in the tunnel becoming part of the new London Overground. After its reopening on 27 April 2010, it was used by mainline trains again.|$|E

On October 21, Loveless had corrective throat surgery. For the next nine weeks, she could neither sing nor talk. Her husband, in order to communicate with her, attempted to teach Loveless Morse Code, as well as using pen and paper with yellow Post-It notes. After this, her interest in Amateur Radio developed and she was eventually licensed with the callsign KD4WUJ, although her license currently shows as canceled.|$|E
