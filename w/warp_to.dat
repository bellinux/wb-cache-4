5|$|Meanwhile, the Bynars discreetly {{create a}} catastrophic {{failure in the}} ship's warp core. Lt. Cmdr. Data (Brent Spiner) and Geordi La Forge (LeVar Burton) are unable to locate Picard or Riker and, {{assuming}} them to already be on the Starbase, order an emergency evacuation. They set the ship to leave the Starbase and <b>warp</b> <b>to</b> a safe location before it would explode. However, once they are clear of the dock, the failure disappears and the ship sets course for the Bynar system, the planet Bynaus orbiting Beta Magellan. Data, La Forge, and Quinteros realize that the Bynars are still aboard the ship, but there are currently no other working vessels to follow them. Back on the Enterprise, Riker and Picard leave the simulation to find the ship empty and at <b>warp</b> <b>to</b> the Bynar system, with the ship's controls locked to the bridge. Fearing that the Bynars have taken over the ship for nefarious purposes, they set the ship to self-destruct in 5 minutes and then take the bridge by inter-ship transporter beam and find the Bynars there unconscious.|$|E
5|$|Data {{is visiting}} D'Sora, but she seems unhappy {{and he is}} acting erratically {{in order to find}} an {{appropriate}} response to make her happy. It becomes evident to the crew that the nebula is causing distortions in space; Picard orders the ship into <b>warp</b> <b>to</b> leave the nebula as quickly as possible but this speeds up the distortions. Whilst investigating them, Lieutenant Van Mayter (Georgina Shore) is killed when a distortion embeds her into the deck. Data discovers that dark matter is causing the distortions. The ship can detect the pockets at short range, but not in enough time {{to move out of the}} way. Worf proposes using a shuttle to lead the Enterprise out, and Picard insists on piloting it alone.|$|E
5|$|Samus {{encounters}} heavy {{resistance from}} the Space Pirates, Phazon-corrupted monstrosities, and her fellow bounty hunters who have been corrupted by Dark Samus. Throughout her mission, which eventually takes her to the Space Pirate homeworld, Samus slowly becomes further Phazon-corrupted. She manages to stop the Space Pirate assault {{with the assistance of}} the Galactic Federation navy. As they gain control of a Leviathan battleship, Samus and the Federation fleet create a wormhole and <b>warp</b> <b>to</b> Phaaze—the source of all Phazon in the galaxy. Samus travels to its core, where she finally defeats Dark Samus and then the corrupted Aurora Unit 313. As a result, Dark Samus is obliterated, and Phaaze explodes, rendering all Phazon in the galaxy inert. The Federation fleet escapes Phaaze's destruction, but loses contact with Samus in the process. Eventually, Samus appears in her gunship, and reports that the mission is accomplished. Samus then takes off for Elysia, where she reflects on her deceased fellow bounty hunters. If the player completes the game with all of the items collected, Samus is seen flying into hyperspace, with Sylux's spaceship following her.|$|E

25|$|On Tralfamadore, Billy {{is put in}} a {{transparent}} geodesic dome exhibit in a zoo; the dome represents a house on Earth. The Tralfamadorians later abduct a movie star named Montana Wildhack, who had disappeared and was believed to have drowned herself in the Pacific Ocean. They intend to have her mate with Billy. She and Billy {{fall in love and}} have a child together. Billy is instantaneously sent back to Earth in a time <b>warp</b> <b>to</b> relive past or future moments of his life.|$|E
25|$|The burial chamber {{was evidently}} rich in textiles, {{represented}} by many fragments preserved, or by chemicals formed by corrosion. They included quantities of twill, possibly from cloaks, blankets or hangings, and {{the remains of}} cloaks with characteristic long-pile weaving. There appear to have been more exotic coloured hangings or spreads, including some (possibly imported) woven in stepped lozenge patterns using a Syrian technique in which the weft is looped around the <b>warp</b> <b>to</b> create a textured surface. Two other colour-patterned textiles, near the head and foot of the body area, resemble Scandinavian work of the same period.|$|E
25|$|On some {{levels in}} {{multiplayer}} mode, if {{one or more}} players do {{not keep up with}} the one in the lead, the view will pan out a bit so that the player in the rear can still be in view. If the players still do not catch up, they are then dragged by the edge of the screen, until they move forward faster or lose a life by a fall or other object. If one player enters a pipe, climbs a vine, grabs the flagpole {{at the end of the}} stage, etc. without the others, the other players will <b>warp</b> <b>to</b> the same place after a short time, or have a limited amount of time to grab the pole before the course ends. On vertically scrolling courses, being left below the screen results in losing a life. On the world map, Mario (Player 1) controls navigation.|$|E

25|$|Ron Harper and James Naughton played Alan Virdon and Peter Burke, two 20th-century American astronauts {{who pass}} through a time <b>warp</b> <b>to</b> a future where apes subjugate humans (unlike the {{original}} film, the humans can speak). Roddy McDowall returned to the franchise as Galen, a chimpanzee who joins the astronauts. Booth Coleman played orangutan Councillor Zaius and Mark Lenard played gorilla General Urko. The episodes portray Virdon, Burke, and Galen as they look for answers, aid downtrodden humans and apes, and avoid the authorities. The show premiered on September 13, 1974, filling CBS' 8–9 p.m. time slot on Fridays. It earned low ratings during its run, a fact the production team attributed to repetitive storytelling and too little screen time for the apes who made the series famous. Given the considerable production costs, CBS cancelled the show after 14 episodes, the last airing on December 20, 1974.|$|E
25|$|Yarns {{from these}} fibers are woven into {{a variety of}} {{different}} weaves, the most notable of which include broadcloth, with double the number of <b>warp</b> <b>to</b> weft threads, giving a smooth, formal shirting; twill, where the tucks of the weft do not line up, giving a diagonal pattern, a weave used for most country checked (e.g. Tattersall) shirtings; poplin, with a heavier warp than weft, giving more formal fabric; and Oxford weaves. Plain Oxford or pinpoint Oxford weaves are popular as casual fabrics, so are generally used in combination with a button-down collar, while royal Oxford is versatile enough to be used on both sporty and formal shirts. There are many other weaves or variations on these, including end-on-end patterns, where alternate white and coloured threads are used, giving a mottled appearance, or more exotic weaves, including voile and batiste, which are extremely light fabrics only used for summer shirts or on the unseen parts of formal shirts.|$|E
500|$|The reel, {{originally}} {{developed for the}} silk industry, now has multiple uses. The earliest surviving depiction of a European spinning wheel is a panel of stained glass in the Cathedral of Chartres. [...] Bobbins and warping machines appear together in the stained glass at Chartres and in a fresco in the Cologne Kunkelhaus (ca 1300). It {{is possible that the}} toothed warping machine was created by the silk industry; it allowed the <b>warp</b> <b>to</b> be more uniform and allowed the <b>warp</b> <b>to</b> be of a longer length.|$|E

500|$|The game {{contains}} {{two types of}} [...] "special stages". When the player collects at least 50 rings and passes a checkpoint, they can <b>warp</b> <b>to</b> the first type, which involves bouncing up a gumball machine-like corridor to earn power-ups by hitting a switch. Both sides of the corridor are lined with flippers, which disappear when the character bounces on them, and the switch drops when both flippers supporting it are removed. The corridor's floor contains a bounce pad, which also disappears after one use; falling afterwards causes the player to leave the stage with the most recent power-up collected.|$|E
500|$|When {{the player}} {{collects}} at least 50 rings and passes a checkpoint, they can <b>warp</b> <b>to</b> a [...] "special stage". In these stages, the player runs through a pseudo-3D half-pipe course, collecting rings and dodging bombs. A set amount of rings must be collected {{to pass through}} each of three checkpoints and in turn to obtain the emerald itself. If Sonic collides with a bomb, he loses ten rings and is immobilized momentarily. The stages rise in difficulty, and the player cannot enter any stage without passing the previous one. After finishing, the player is transported back to the star post they used to enter the special stage, with their ring-count reset to zero. When all Emeralds have been collected, if the player chose Sonic, {{he has the ability}} to turn into Super Sonic, which requires 50 rings or more. Super Sonic is yellow and invincible to enemy attacks, and his speed, acceleration, and jump height are increased as well. However, he loses one ring per second and reverts to being regular Sonic when all of his rings are gone.|$|E
500|$|Majora's Mask {{imposes a}} time limit of three days (72 hours) game-time, which is about 54 minutes in real time. An {{on-screen}} clock tracks the day and time. Link can return to 6:00am {{on the first day}} by playing the [...] "Song of Time" [...] on the Ocarina of Time. If he does not before the 72 hours expire, then the moon will destroy Clock Town, including all the surrounding regions of Termina and Link will lose everything he accomplished during these three days. A real-time countdown will begin when only 6 hours remain. However, returning to the first day saves the player's progress and major accomplishments permanently, such as the acquisition of maps, masks, musical tracks, and weapons. Cleared puzzles, keys, and minor items will be lost, as well as any rupees not in the bank, and almost all characters will have no recollection of meeting Link. Link can slow down time or <b>warp</b> <b>to</b> the next morning or evening by playing two variations of the Song of Time. Owl statues scattered across certain major areas of the world allow the player to temporarily save their progress once they have been activated, and also provide warp points to quickly move around the world.|$|E

500|$|The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is {{an action}} {{role-playing}} game, playable from either a first or third-person perspective. The player may freely roam {{over the land}} of Skyrim, which is an open world environment consisting of wilderness expanses, dungeons, cities, towns, fortresses and villages. Players may navigate the game world more quickly by riding horses, or by utilizing a fast-travel system which allows them to <b>warp</b> <b>to</b> previously discovered locations. The game's main quest can be completed or ignored at the player's preference after {{the first stage of}} the quest is finished. However, some quests rely on the main storyline being at least partially completed. Non-player characters (NPCs) populate the world and can be interacted with in a number of ways; the player may engage them in conversation, marry an eligible NPC, kill them, or engage in a nonlethal [...] "brawl". As in previous The Elder Scrolls games, killing certain NPCs can make some quests or items unobtainable. Some NPCs cannot be killed due to their importance in later storylines. If witnessed, crimes like murder and theft accrue the player a bounty, which is tracked independently in each of Skyrim's nine holds. Should the player be stopped by a guard, they may wipe their bounty with gold or jail time, or may resist arrest which will trigger an aggressive pursuit. NPCs may offer the player additional side-quests, and some side-quests have parameters adjusted based on nearby dungeons which the player has yet to explore. Some NPCs who are befriended or hired by the player may act as companions, who will accompany the player and aid them in combat. The player may choose to join factions, which are organized groups of NPCs—for example, the Dark Brotherhood, a band of assassins. Each of the factions has an associated quest path to progress through. Each city and town in the game world has jobs that the player can engage in, such as farming.|$|E
2500|$|Travel across {{distances}} {{longer than}} hundreds kilometers is done primarily with the ship's Warp Drive, which every ship and escape pod has, though the player may [...] "slow boat" [...] across distances, traveling without warp drive. The player issues a command to <b>warp</b> <b>to</b> an object, {{which must be}} greater than 150km away {{and in the same}} star system, and, after an alignment maneuver, their ship will enter warp. After between a few seconds to several minutes, depending on ship speed and warp distance, the ship will arrive at the selected destination. A ship's warp drive can be temporarily disabled by warp disruption weapons, which {{is an essential part of}} combat to prevent a target from escaping.|$|E
2500|$|Janet van Dyne {{is among}} the Mighty Avengers who are {{fighting}} heroes from the Skrull ship. She is later seen {{with the rest of}} the Avengers heading to New York to confront the Skrulls. While fighting the Skrulls, the true purpose of the serum that the Skrull Hank Pym has given her is revealed. After Queen Veranke is thought to be dead, the Skrull imposter presses a button that makes Janet increase in size rapidly, as well as cause her to emitting lethal amounts of black-purple energy. Janet realizes that the [...] "new" [...] particles Pym has given her are turning her into a bio-bomb, and she tries to flee the battlefield and take as many Skrulls with her as possible when she explodes. To save both the city and heroes, Thor uses the enchanted hammer Mjolnir to create a spatial <b>warp</b> <b>to</b> seemingly disperses Janet into nothingness. Thor is devastated by the act and vows to avenge her.|$|E

30|$|The use of jitter buffers is {{ubiquitous}} in VoIP systems and often introduces <b>warping</b> <b>to</b> speech. The use of NSIM for patch alignment combined with estimating the similarity using warp-adjusted patches provides ViSQOL with a promising warp estimation strategy for speech quality estimation. Small amounts of warp (around 5 % or less) {{are critical for}} VoIP scenarios, where playout adjustments are commonly employed. Unlike PESQ where small warps cause large drops in predicted quality, both POLQA and ViSQOL exhibit a lack of sensitivity for <b>warps</b> up <b>to</b> 5 % that reflect the listener quality experience.|$|R
