5|$|Comedy Central {{has decided}} not to air these two episodes of South Park. It is a {{decision}} we've made with great reluctance. Comedy Central believes strongly in creative freedom of expression; when unique and deeply insightful creative talents like those behind South Park are able to express themselves freely, we all benefit. However, the safety of our employees is our unquestioned numberone priority, and therefore <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>decided</b> to take these precautionary measures.|$|E

"In {{order to}} {{fine-tune}} Smash Bros., with this unprecedented game depth, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>decided</b> {{that we have}} to take a little more time to complete the game than we announced before. We are sorry for the fans that are already anxiously waiting for the launch, but we would like to launch this game on January 24, 2008 in Japan. As for the North American launch, we will review that too, and our local subsidiaries will make their own announcements." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{restaurant}} {{closed in}} November 2015. The owners posted online, [...] "It {{was a hard}} decision but sadly <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>decided</b> to close our doors. Thanks to everyone that's supported us and have dined with us. We will miss you all and happy holidays!" [...] Willamette Week Martin Cizmar attributed the diner's closure to its location and lack of nearby foot traffic. Oregon Liquor Control Commission documentation from March 2016 shows an application for a tradename update to The Daily Feast.|$|E

[...] "Without {{going into}} {{unnecessary}} details, he strenuously resisted a project <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>decided</b> on, and {{the defeat of}} his wishes apparently came as a shock. He was speaking vehemently and collapsed {{in the middle of}} it." ...|$|R
500|$|The song became {{controversial}} for its supposed {{references to}} drugs. The BBC {{announced that it}} would not broadcast [...] "A Day in the Life" [...] due to the line [...] "I'd love to turn you on", which, according to the corporation, advocated drug use. Other lyrics allegedly referring to drugs include [...] "found my way upstairs and had a smoke / somebody spoke and I went into a dream". A spokesman for the BBC stated: [...] "We have listened to this song over and over again. And <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>decided</b> that it appears to go just a little too far, and could encourage a permissive attitude to drug-taking." [...] The ban was eventually lifted on 13 March 1972.|$|E
500|$|Enron's {{management}} team claimed the losses were mostly due to investment losses, along with charges such as about $180 million in money spent restructuring the company's troubled broadband trading unit. In a statement, Lay revealed, [...] "After a thorough review of our businesses, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>decided</b> {{to take these}} charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential of our core energy businesses." [...] Some analysts were unnerved. David Fleischer at Goldman Sachs, an analyst termed previously 'one of the company's strongest supporters' asserted that the Enron management [...] "... lost credibility and have to reprove themselves. They need to convince investors these earnings are real, {{that the company is}} for real and that growth will be realized." ...|$|E
500|$|On August 27, 2008, a prequel {{comic book}} (leading {{right up to}} the moment in the pilot where Olivia 'first' meets Walter) written by Zack Whedon was {{released}} by DC Comics under its WildStorm imprint. This was to be the first issue of a monthly 6-issue limited series but the others were delayed until January 2009, when monthly publication resumed, with the sixth and final issue scheduled for release on June 17. The Vice President of WildStorm, Hank Kanalz, explained the publication hiatus: [...] "The writers of the show want to make sure the comic book is integrated into the mythology of the Fringe world, so <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>decided</b> to refocus the direction of the comic book. Unfortunately, this means that we will have some delays, but will be back in January." ...|$|E
60|$|In my {{frenzy of}} delight at the {{possibilities}} of escape I recollect shaking hands effusively with Gunga Dass, after <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>decided</b> that <b>we</b> were to make {{an attempt to get}} away that very night. It was weary work waiting throughout the afternoon.|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite so," [...] {{rejoined the}} {{prisoner}} placidly. [...] "Methought, sir, that <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>decided</b> that I should lead this little expedition? Surely," [...] he added, [...] "it {{is not so}} much the Dauphin whom you want as my share in this betrayal." ...|$|R
60|$|Not {{content with}} the wonders of Colorado I drifted down to Santa FÃ© and Isleta, with Charles Francis Browne and Hermon MacNeill, and got finally to Holbrook, where we {{outfitted}} and rode away across the desert, bound for the Snake Dance at Walpi. It would seem that <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>decided</b> to share all there was of romance in the South West. They were as insatiate as I.|$|R
500|$|In March 1921, strikes {{erupted in}} Petrograd when workers {{took to the}} streets {{demanding}} better food rations and more union autonomy. Goldman and Berkman felt a responsibility to support the strikers, stating: [...] "To remain silent now is impossible, even criminal." [...] The unrest spread to the port town of Kronstadt, where the government ordered a military response to suppress striking soldiers and sailors. In the Kronstadt rebellion, approximately 1,000 rebelling sailors and soldiers were killed and two thousand more were arrested; many were later executed. In the wake of these events, Goldman and Berkman decided there was no future in the country for them. [...] "More and more", she wrote, [...] "we {{have come to the conclusion}} that we can do nothing here. And as we can not keep up a life of inactivity much longer <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>decided</b> to leave." ...|$|E
500|$|He {{returned}} to Florida for training after the Big 'Cap, but after performing poorly in a June workout {{was found to}} have some bruising of his fetlocks, and was given lighter duty. On July 15 it was announced that Mucho Macho Man was officially retired from racing and would stand at stud at Adena Springs beginning in the 2015 breeding year. In a further twist of synchronicity, in the same week Stevens announced he was taking a break from race riding due to the need for a total knee replacement. [...] Ritvo explained that Mucho Macho Man was sound, but [...] "fter five seasons of training and racing, he shows signs of some minor wear and tear. He is still sound and happy, but <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>decided</b> that it is in his best interests to retire him. He has nothing more to prove to any of us." ...|$|E
500|$|The segment was {{inspired}} by the announcement that Perry would appear as herself on Sesame Street. This appearance, which sees her performing a [...] version of her song [...] "Hot n Cold" [...] with Elmo, was originally to appear on the forty-first-season premiere of the educational children's program on September 27, 2010. However, on September 23 it was announced that it had been cut from the show because some parents who had seen the appearance online complained about the revealing clothes worn by Perry. Sesame Workshop {{said in a statement that}} [...] "In light of the feedback we've received on the Katy Perry music video which was released on YouTube only, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>decided</b> we will not air the segment on the television broadcast of Sesame Street, which is aimed at preschoolers. Katy Perry fans will still be able to view the video on YouTube." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>decided</b> {{to stake}} {{all on the}} chance {{that we would be}} able to reach the temple by the {{subterranean}} way and so we left no guard of vessels at the shaft's mouth. Nor would it have profited us any to have done so, for <b>we</b> did not <b>have</b> sufficient force all told to have withstood the vast navy of the First Born had they returned to engage us.|$|R
60|$|So our talk went on. Once in town I was {{impatient}} {{to write to}} my father, for <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>decided</b> that <b>we</b> would not telegraph. Leaving our horses in Cless's corral, {{we went to the}} hotel and proceeded to compose the letter. This turned out more of a task than <b>we</b> <b>had</b> bargained for. But we got it finished at last, not forgetting to put in a word for Jim Williams, and then we both signed it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Like as not he'll bolt with you. Hold him in, Ken!" [...] called Dick, as he mounted. Then {{he shouted}} {{a final word}} to the prisoners, saying they would be looked after, and drove the pack-ponies into the trail. As we rode out we passed several of the horses that <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>decided</b> to leave behind, and as they wanted to follow us it was {{necessary}} to drive them back.|$|R
500|$|The album sold well {{despite being}} {{initially}} {{pulled from the}} shelves in some stores due to concerns over some of its lyrical content. [...] The band and its record label later added a Parental Advisory sticker to the album, and some stores ordered amended copies of the album. Erna commented in Rolling Stone magazine stating, [...] "Our record {{has been in the}} marketplace {{for more than a year}} now without a parental advisory sticker and this is the one and only complaint... Stickers and lyrics are by nature subjective... <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>decided</b> to put a sticker on the record". This controversy did not appear to adversely affect album sales but, according to Erna, helped, [...] "It's almost taunting kids to go out and get the record to see what we're saying on it". The album also had four successful singles which were [...] "Whatever", [...] "Keep Away", [...] "Voodoo" [...] and [...] "Bad Religion".|$|E
500|$|In the East, the {{persecution}} was officially discontinued on April 30, 311, although martyrdoms in Gaza continued until May 4. Galerius, now on his deathbed, issued a proclamation to end hostilities, and give Christians {{the rights to}} exist freely under the law, and to peaceable assembly. Persecution was everywhere at an end. Lactantius preserves the Latin text of this pronouncement, describing it as an edict. Eusebius provides a Greek translation of the pronouncement. His version includes imperial titles and an address to provincials, suggesting that the proclamation is, in fact, an imperial letter. The document seems only to have been promulgated in Galerius's provinces.Among all the other arrangements that we are always making for the benefit and utility of the state, we have heretofore wished to repair all things {{in accordance with the}} laws and public discipline of the Romans, and to ensure that even the Christians, who abandoned the practice of their ancestors, should return to good sense. Indeed, for some reason or other, such self-indulgence assailed and idiocy possessed those Christians, that they did not follow the practices of the ancients, which their own ancestors had, perhaps, instituted, but according to their own will and as it pleased them, they made laws for themselves that they observed, and gathered various peoples in diverse areas. Then when our order was issued stating that they should return themselves to the practices of the ancients, many were subjected to peril, and many were even killed. Many more persevered in their way of life, and we saw that they neither offered proper worship and cult to the gods, or to the god of the Christians. Considering the observation of our own mild clemency and eternal custom, by which we are accustomed to grant clemency to all people, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>decided</b> to extend our most speedy indulgence to these people as well, so that Christians may once more establish their own meeting places, so long as they do not act in a disorderly way. We are about to send another letter to our officials detailing the conditions they ought to observe. Consequently, in accord with our indulgence, they ought to pray to their god for our health and the safety of the state, so that the state may be kept safe on all sides, and {{they may be able to}} live safely and securely in their own homes. Galerius's words reinforce the Tetrarchy's theological basis for {{the persecution}}; the acts did nothing more than attempt to enforce traditional civic and religious practices, even if the edicts themselves were thoroughly nontraditional. Galerius does nothing to violate the spirit of the persecutionChristians are still admonished for their nonconformity and foolish practicesGalerius never admits that he did anything wrong. The admission that the Christians' god might exist is made only grudgingly. Certain early 20th-century historians have declared that Galerius's edict definitively nullified the old [...] "legal formula" [...] non licet esse Christianos, made Christianity a religio licita, [...] "on a par with Judaism", and secured Christians' property, among other things.|$|E

60|$|George got {{the line}} right after a while, and towed us {{steadily}} on to Penton Hook. There {{we discussed the}} important question of camping. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>decided</b> to sleep on board that night, and <b>we</b> <b>had</b> either to lay up just about there, or go on past Staines.
