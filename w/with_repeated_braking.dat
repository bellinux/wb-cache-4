This paper describes the impact of an auditory secondary task on drivers' mental states during a primary driving task. N = 20 participants performed the test procedure in a car following task <b>with</b> <b>repeated</b> forced <b>braking</b> on a non-public test track. Performance measures (provoked reaction time to brake lights) and brain activity (EEG alpha spindles) were analyzed to describe distracted drivers. Further, a classification approach was used to investigate whether alpha spindles can predict drivers' mental states. Results show that reaction times and alpha spindle rate increased with time-on-task. Moreover, brake reaction times and alpha spindle rate were significantly higher while driving with auditory secondary task opposed to driving only. In single-trial classification, a combination of spindle parameters yielded a median classification error of about 8 % in discriminating the distracted from the alert driving. Reduced driving performance (i. e., prolonged brake reaction times) during increased cognitive load is assumed to be indicated by EEG alpha spindles, enabling the quantification of driver distraction in experiments on public roads without verbally assessing the drivers' mental states...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Braking {{operation}} {{is a process}} that converts kinetic energy and potential energy of a moving automobile into other energies. Most of the mechanical energy is transferred into heat. Frictional heat, which is generated on the interface of the disc and pads, can cause high temper-ature during the braking process. The objective of the present work is to determine temperature distribution, thermaldistortion, and thermal stress ina soliddiscby three-dimensionalmodelling for <b>repeated</b> <b>braking.</b> Braking is applied four times in the present study; the vehicle is decelerated from 100 to 50 kph with 0. 6 g, after which the velocity is again accelerated to 100 kph. In order to simulate the friction heat behaviour accurately in <b>repeated</b> <b>braking,</b> the moving heat source, which is defined by time and space variable, is applied on the frictional surface. The temperature field and thermal stress in the disc present a non-uniformity characteristic because of themoving heat source. Temperature and thermal stress of the point on the frictional surface of the brake disc present fluctuation in the braking operation. The coning angle due to the non-uniform radial temperature distribution varieswith temperature. Thermal fatigue is also discussed in this article...|$|R

This heat should {{dissipate}} into the surrounding air, but can just as easily transfer to other braking system components. Brake drums must be large {{to cope with the}} massive forces involved, and must be able to absorb and dissipate a lot of heat. Heat transfer to air can be aided by incorporating cooling fins onto the drum. However, excessive heating can occur due to heavy or <b>repeated</b> <b>braking,</b> which can cause the drum to distort, leading to vibration under braking.|$|R

40|$|The {{heat flux}} {{produced}} from the friction between a disc and pad system {{leads to a}} high temperature which causes thermal stresses in the disc and {{after a number of}} <b>repeated</b> <b>braking</b> cycles, cracks might be initiated. The finite element analysis (FEA) is performed to determine the temperatures profile in the disc and to analyze the stresses for the <b>repeated</b> <b>braking,</b> which could be used to calculate the fatigue life of a disc. Sequentially coupled approach is used for thermo-mechanical problem and the problem is divided into two parts, heat analysis and thermal stress analysis. The heat analysis is obtained by including frictional heat and adopting an Eulerian approach. The heat analysis is conducted by using Abaqus and the toolbox developed by Niclas Strömberg. The thermal stress analysis, which is the main focus of this thesis, is followed using Abaqus. The plasticity theory as background for stress analysis is discussed in detail. The rate independent elasto-plastic plasticity is used in the stress analysis. Temperature independent material properties are considered throughout the thesis work. Isotropic, kinematic and combined hardening models are analyzed for simple 2 D academic models for different types of cyclic loads. A benchmark disc and pad model, which is less complicated than the real disc-pad model, is also studied. The linear kinematic hardening model with rate independent elastic-plastic plasticity is used for benchmark and real disc-pad model. The results of the benchmark model and the real model are observed to be similar in terms of plasticity theory...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{automotive}} applications, {{a particular}} area of concern is the relation between thermoelastically induced hot spots and noise and vibration in brake system. The finite element methods have been extensively used for thermal analysis applied to brake components. The two-dimensional model has been extended to an annular three-dimensional disc model in order to consider more realistic braking condition. In a conventional braking analysis, the interface pressure is assumed either constant or inversely proportional to radius. However, under the dynamic braking conditions, the frictional heat generated during braking causes thermoelastic distortion that modifies the contact pressure distribution. This paper describes the thermo-elastic instability arising from friction heat generation in braking and proposes the finite element methods to predict the variation of temperature and thermal deformation under single <b>braking</b> and <b>repeated</b> <b>braking</b> mode...|$|R

[...] He therefore concluded - with (he claimed) the support of circumstantial evidence - that the bridge might well have failed at the north end first; [...] he explicitly dismissed the claim that the train had hit the girders before the bridge fell.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, an {{efficient}} sequential approach for simulating thermal stresses in <b>brake</b> discs for <b>repeated</b> <b>braking</b> is presented. First, a frictional heat analysis is performed {{by using an}} Eulerian formulation of the disc. Then, by using the temperature history from {{the first step of}} the sequence, a plasticity analysis with temperature dependent material data is performed {{in order to determine the}} corresponding thermal stresses. Three-dimensional geometries of a disc and a pad to a heavy truck are considered in the numerical simulations. The contact forces are computed at each time step taking the thermal deformations of the disc and pad into account. In such manner, the frictional heat power distribution will also be updated in each time step, which in turn will influence the development of heat bands. The plasticity model is taken to be the von Mises yield criterion with linear kinematic hardening, where both the hardening and the yield limit are temperature dependent. The results show that during hard braking, high compressive stresses are generated on the disc surface in the circumferential direction which cause yielding. But when the disc cools down, these compressive stresses transform to tensile residual stresses. For <b>repeated</b> hard <b>braking</b> when this kind of stress history is repeated, we also show that stress cycles with high amplitudes are developed which might generate low cycle fatigue cracks after a few braking cycles...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis article {{presents}} a prediction {{of the residual}} stresses that are introduced by the heat treatment {{in the manufacture of}} railway wheels. It is well known that this treatment induces the formation of a layer of residual circumferential (hoop) compressive stresses on the tread surface. This stress field may be reversed during service loading, especially tread braking. Tensile stresses at the wheel tread that arise from <b>repeated</b> <b>braking</b> may lead to the initiation of surface cracks. The work presented here defines a methodology for determining the as-manufactured residual stress field prior to service loading. A thermal and mechanical finite element model was used to study the residual stress evolution during the heat treatment. The heat transfer coefficient during quenching was determined by means of a dedicated experimental setup. The results show that the numerically computed residual stresses correlate strongly with the experimental residual stresses determined by ultrasound when the model material includes time-dependent effects such as creep or viscoplasticity...|$|R

The proposed technique is important and more useful in applications of <b>repeated</b> <b>braking</b> cycles. The results are compared with that obtained using plugging braking method and it's found that the proposed technique gives lower braking energy and shorter braking time. The braking energy losses with the proposed method are about 20 % of the plugging braking energy losses with the same braking time. The proposed method determines the variation of optimal values of applied voltage and frequency to have a certain braking time of three phase induction motor at a certain load torque with minimum braking energy losses.
