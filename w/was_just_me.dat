R. R. Tolkien. He reprised his roles as Smaug and the Necromancer for [...] (2013) and [...] (2014). For the motion-capture aspect of the films, he used a suit and facial markers to highlight the dragon's expressions and movements. Cumberbatch told Total Film [...] "You just have to lose your shit on a carpeted floor, in a place that looks {{a little bit like a}} mundane government building. It <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>me</b> as well, with four static cameras and all the sensors." ...|$|E
5000|$|Anika Moa {{said that}} the album {{contrasts}} with her debut, Thinking Room; [...] "Stolen Hill is not as over-produced; more sparse, more feeling, more family-like, more Māori, more me...it <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>me</b> growing up".|$|R
5000|$|In the March {{issue of}} Golf World (UK) in 2008, Poulter was quoted saying [...] "Don't get me wrong, I really respect every {{professional}} golfer, but I know I haven't played to my full potential {{and when that}} happens, it will <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>me</b> and Tiger." ...|$|R

500|$|Describing the song's {{origins in}} an {{interview}} with National Public Radio (NPR), Shields said that the writing and recording of [...] "City Girl" [...] was [...] "very simple, {{in the sense that it}} <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>me</b> teaching Brian the chord structure and Brian just jamming along to it." [...] The duo recorded an instrumental rehearsal version of the song, after which Shields said there was [...] "no point in rerecording it." [...] He later wrote lyrics and recorded vocals for the song but emphasised that there was no need for [...] "elaborations [...] overdubs." [...] Shields described this method of recording as a [...] "slapdash approach", noting that there was no [...] "point in labouring over something … because you don't know what's going to work".|$|E
500|$|In several shots, Mulder {{can be seen}} {{wearing a}} wedding band. This was David Duchovny's idea; he {{explained}} [...] "That <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>me,</b> you know, fooling around. I had recently gotten married, and I wanted to wear it." [...] He later described the situation as [...] "so Mulder to never have mentioned that he was married". Series creator Chris Carter later told Duchovny that the situation [...] "creates a problem. If we ever do a show that takes place seven years ago, you'll have to be married." [...] However, Duchovny reassured Carter {{by pointing out that}} there were not very many episodes, if any, that had been planned to take place seven years prior to the events in this episode. The inclusion of the detail caused an [...] "Internet frenzy" [...] and the minor detail was never resolved on screen.|$|E
500|$|Although Dannemann {{stated that}} Hendrix was alive when {{placed in the}} {{ambulance}} at approximately 11:30a.m. and that she rode {{with him on the}} way to the hospital, the ambulance crew later denied she was there. Statements from the paramedics who responded to the call support that they found Hendrix alone in the flat when they arrived at 11:27a.m., fully clothed and apparently already dead. Jones later commented: [...] " [...] we arrived at the flat, the door was flung wide open, nobody about, just the body on the bed." [...] Saua stated: [...] "There <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>me</b> and the casualty and Reg the driver. Nobody else." [...] Burdon stated: [...] " [...] didn't leave in the ambulance; she was with me". According to Jones, Hendrix's bowels and bladder had released some of their contents prior to the ambulance crew's arrival at the Samarkand. Saua stated that the vomit was dry when they arrived, making use of their aspirator ineffective. Saua commented: [...] "When we moved , the gases were gurgling, you get that when someone has died". According to police officer Smith: [...] "The ambulance men were there, but Jimi was dead... There was really nothing they could do for him." [...] Smith also disputes Dannemann's claim that she was there with Hendrix at the flat and in the ambulance: No, I remember quite clearly the doors shutting on the crew and Jimi... there was no one about. If she had been in the flat, they would never have called us to come... But because no one was there, he was dead, and circumstances were a little odd, suspicious, they radioed... us in. It wasn't until later in the day that I found out that it was Jimi Hendrix. In 1992, after having conducted an extensive review of the events of September 18, 1970, the London Ambulance Service issued an official statement: [...] "There was no one else, except the deceased, at the flat when they arrived; nor did anyone else accompany them in the ambulance to St. Mary Abbotts Hospital." ...|$|E

5000|$|Pollysgotyournumbers of Bitch Stole My Remote gave a good {{review to}} the episode stating: [...] "So, I’m just gonna {{go ahead and}} call it: this was 2012′s best Hallowe’en themed {{television}} show.

He knew I wasn’t going to back down. I had to realize or see if he is really about being a dog, about this neighborhood stuff. I went at him. It <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>me</b> being me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Q-Tip {{was upset}} over the album's {{shelving}} {{and felt that}} although Reid {{did not know how}} to market it, his label released OutKast's Speakerboxxx/The Love Below in 2003: [...] "hose are the kinds of sounds that are on Kamaal the Abstract. Maybe even a little more out [...] Kamaal <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>me,</b> guerrilla". While it did not receive an official release, advanced promotional copies made their way into the public, leaking to the Internet.|$|E
2500|$|Though {{many have}} assumed that EPMD {{produced}} the music on the album because of their executive production credit, Weston stated [...] "in the studio back then it <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>me,</b> Skoob, Chris, and Derek, and that was it. EPMD didn't produce us, we were just with their production company. A lot of people forget that." [...] Weston referred to Charity, {{who died in the}} year 2000, as [...] "the brains of the operation, definitely... He was definitely the boss and the real executive producer of the first album. We'd have meetings at his crib in Brooklyn and he was running things." ...|$|E
5000|$|This album {{features}} The Trip, one of Art Pepper's own melodies {{written in}} 1963 while in San Quentin. Pepper likened jazz to the storytelling {{that took place}} between the prisoners. As he says in the sleeve notes, [...] "When I play,... the sound {{that comes out of}} this thing, this piece of metal <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>me</b> saying these things and taking people on a trip." ...|$|R

5000|$|... "I {{came out}} in the third grade. This <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>me</b> being me. People make it sound like it's {{controversial}} and revolutionary, and that's weird to me, because in hip-hop you have people glorifying negativity like killing people and not taking care of your kids -- and that should be scandalous! That should be what we talk about. An openly gay rapper shouldn’t be breaking news." [...] —Bradshaw on being an openly gay rapper ...|$|R
2500|$|Several {{attempts}} at founding a band proved unsuccessful. After turning 22, {{he says he}} was contacted by Aftermath Entertainment about showcasing his musical talents, but the opportunity ultimately fell through. For the next few years, Foster waited tables at a cafe while dealing with writer's block, but he remained in Los Angeles after landing a job as a commercial jingle writer for Mophonics in 2008. He said of the profession, [...] "I definitely learned from the commercial standpoint what works," [...] and he credited it with reviving his confidence in performing. The music Foster wrote spanned a wide range of genres, but he had difficulty reconciling his eclectic compositions. He explained: [...] "I'd write one song and it'd be a hip-hop song. I'd write another and it'd be heavily electronic. Another would be like a spiritual, and another would be classic piano song. I was constantly trying to pull those elements together. It took me six years to do it." [...] He still wished {{to be part of a}} group; reflecting on a residency he did at a venue performing electronic music, he said, [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>me</b> and a laptop. Really, it was terrible. I knew I needed a band." ...|$|E
2500|$|Snow Patrol {{was one of}} {{the acts}} at the iTunes Festival, which was held {{throughout}} July. The band played on 5 July, and was the co-headlining act for the day. The performance was released as a digital EP on the iTunes Store as [...] The band later co-headlined Oxegen 2009 in July along with newly re-formed Blur. The band joined Blur again to co-headline the T in the Park, just two days after the Oxegen Festival. The band returned to Germany to headline the Sonnenrot Festival. The show, though had to be cancelled due to torrential rains. The band followed with Rockhal, T-Mobile Street Gig, Stimmen Festival and Open R Festival. In August, the band will play at the Sziget Festival, and the Pukkelpop Festival. After the band's concert at the Street Gig in Dettenheim, lead singer Gary Lightbody broke a rib in a go-karting accident. Lightbody was livid with himself: [...] "I had my very best idiot trousers on in Germany at the Street gig and we did a go-kart track in Dettenheim. I did say beforehand that I shouldn’t go on them as firstly I shouldn't be in charge of anything that can go over 20miles an hour and secondly I am the most accident-prone idiot in the western world. Did I heed my own advice? Did I fuck! So on I went and crash after crash later; finishing on a particularly nasty one that put took me to hospital where I discovered I have a broken rib. Sweet." [...] He made a full recovery and resumed touring in a few days. Months later, in October 2009, Lightbody revealed the [...] "truth" [...] behind his crash, admitting that he can't drive. He went on the explain the exact details of what had happened: [...] "At the very last corner, I skidded to miss Jonny (Quinn) and I smashed {{into the side of the}} wall and actually came out of the go-kart. It was hilarious - for everyone who was watching. Everyone thought it <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>me</b> being me, 'Ah...leave him, he's fine.' But, an hour later, I was in hospital. It was good actually having a real injury rather than all the ones I make up in my head." [...] He also admitted his bandmates didn't believe he was actually hurt, as he was a [...] "drama queen".|$|E

"She's {{so easily}} flichtered now," [...] Gavinia told Tommy in the kitchen, [...] "that for fear o' {{starting}} her I never whistle at my work without telling her I'm to do't, and if I {{fall on the}} stair, my first thought is to jump up and cry, 'It <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>me</b> tum'ling.' And now I believe this brute'll be the death o' her." ...|$|E
60|$|Dearest Mr. Chorley, {{you have}} not <b>been</b> <b>just</b> to <b>me</b> {{in the matter of}} my 'Poems before Congress.' Why have you not <b>been</b> <b>just</b> to <b>me?</b> You <b>are</b> an honest man and my friend. Those two things might go together. Your opinions, {{critical}} or political, are free from stress of friendship. I never expected from you favor or mercy because you were my friend (it would have been unworthy of us both) but I did expect justice from you, although you were my friend. That is reasonable.|$|R
5000|$|In an April 2011 {{interview}} with Blogcritics, Smith revealed {{plans to expand}} Panic! at the Disco from the current duo {{with the addition of}} new band members saying, [...] "We knew it would <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>me</b> and Brendon, but we have also left the option open to work with other people."
