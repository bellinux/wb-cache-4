A total of 105 mixed-sex Arbor Acres broilers {{were divided into}} three treatment groups: i) 45 -min transport without rest (T group), ii) 45 -min transport with 1 -h rest (TR group), iii) 45 -min transport with 15 -min <b>water-misting</b> sprays with {{forced ventilation}} and 45 -min rest (TWFR group). The results showed the TWFR group significantly increased (p< 0. 05) initial muscle pH (pHi) and ultimate pH (pHu) and significantly reduced L* (p< 0. 05), drip loss, cook loss, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase activity, plasma glucose content, lactate and glycolytic potential when compared with other groups. Microstructure of the muscle from TWFR group broilers under light microscopy showed smaller intercellular spaces among muscle fibers and bundles compared with T group. In conclusion this study indicated <b>water-misting</b> sprays with forced ventilation after transport could relieve the stress caused by transport under high temperature, which was favorable for the broilers’ welfare. Furthermore, <b>water-misting</b> sprays with forced ventilation after transport slowed down the postmortem glycolysis rate and inhibited the occurrence of PSE-like meat in broilers. Although rest after transport could also improve the meat quality, the effect was not as significant as <b>water-misting</b> sprays with forced ventilation after transport...|$|R

As longwall chocks (supports) advance, crushed roof coal and/or rock can fall {{from the top of}} the chock canopy into the face ventilation airflow. Dust survey showed that chock movement is a significant source of dust exposure for shearer operators, accounting for about 47 % of total LW face dust make during the cutting cycle. 3 D CFD models have been developed to understand the behaviour of longwall dust particles from various sources including maingate (MG) chocks and stage loader/crusher.

Since data con-cerning the efficacy of engineering controls collected at worksites is often confounded by factors such as wind, worker skill level, the experiments were conducted in a laboratory environment.

This work aims at providing an insight into the ability of sprinklers and <b>water-mist</b> systems to control and extinguish a fire within an enclosed car park {{through a series of}} real-scale experiments. Three cars were employed in each test: the central one was ignited by a heptane pool fire and the adjacent ones served as targets. Two configurations were explored: in the first one, a nozzle was placed directly at the vertical axis of the ignition source, whereas the ignition source was located between the area coverage of four nozzles in the second one. The sprinkler system mainly served as a reference; two values of discharge density were evaluated for water mist at high operative pressure and a biodegradable surfactant was also tested against the most challenging configuration. A quantitative analysis of free-burn and discharge phases by temperature measurements was coupled with radiant heat-flux measurements and an assessment of post-fire damage. Sprinkler and <b>water-mist</b> systems were capable of containing the fire spread and thermally controlling the fire, thus preventing structural damage. The water mist’s ability to overpower the plume and reach the burning surfaces proved more effective than that of sprinklers, especially as no nozzles were located right above the ignition surface. The higher discharge density showed better capability of preventing re-ignition phenomena and suppression was attained in both the investigated configurations, which suggests that a certain amount of flux is also needed to achieve flame cooling.

The objective of Mist is to {{study the effects of}} droplet size distribution and water concentration on the burning velocity of a propagating premixed propane-air flame. Changes of the laminar flame speed and shape are used as the measure of flame suppression efficacy. Thirty-two tests were conducted with four different fuel-air equivalence ratios (0. 6, 0. 7, 1. 0, and 1. 3), two droplet size distributions (count median diameters of 20 and 30 µm), and water loadings (measured in water mass fraction) ranging from 0. 0 to 0. 1. The injection of water mist in microgravity resulted in a uniformly distributed and quiescent droplet cloud. Lean flames with a parabolic flame front monotonically slowed down to a steady-state velocity through the mist cloud. Small droplet size distributions are consistently more effective than larger ones in suppressing the propagation of lean flames with the effect of droplet size diminishing at the lowest burning velocities.

METHODS: Grooming was analyzed during the 20 -min period immediately following a <b>water-mist</b> spray. Running wheel activity over two consecutive nights and barbering were analyzed. COMT protein levels were measured by Western analysis. RESULTS: Six-month old male but not female ArKO mice develop compulsive behaviors such as excessive barbering, grooming and wheel-running. Excessive activities were reversed by 3 weeks of 17 beta-estradiol replacement. Interestingly, the presentation of compulsive behaviors is accompanied by concomitant decreases (p <. 05) in hypothalamic COMT protein levels in male ArKO mice. These values returned to normal upon 17 beta-estradiol treatment. In contrast, hepatic and frontal cortex COMT levels were not affected by the estrogen status, indicating region- and tissue-specific regulation of COMT levels by estrogen. No differences in COMT levels were detectable between female animals of both genotypes.

40|$|Qualification of new {{technology}} (or systems) has become an important discipline within application areas that have strict requirements to safety and/or reliability, and where {{new technology}} is not adequately covered by established rules, standards, and practices. With new solutions,which potentially affect a lot of people, {{it is important to}} reduce the uncertainty related {{to the development of the}} technology and document that the technology will have an acceptable performance during its lifecycle. The Norwegian Public Road Administration (NPRA) has adopted technology qualification as an approach to ensure that the extreme fjord-crossing concepts evaluated for the "Ferry free E- 39 " project inherits the necessary attributes. Several uncertainties are related to the E- 39 project. To empower decision making, and systematically address these uncertainties, the agency has begun the development of a technology qualification programme. It is expected that the extreme fjord-crossing concepts will require installation of dedicated safety-related systems that employ electrical/electronic/programmable electronic technology(so called safety-instrumented systems) to ensure safe operation. Many of these systems may be considered unproven (in technology and/or application area), and will require a systematic and structured process of qualification before deemed safe to install. IEC 61508 is considered the main standard for safety-instrumented systems, and elements from this standards may supplement and improve a potential framework for qualification of such systems. The standard can be classified as a RAMS (reliability, availability, maintainability and safety) standard. RAMS requirements are key attributes of system performance, and RAMS assessments are therefore key tools in any qualification process. This thesis aims to contribute to the currently on-going work of implementing a technology qualification programme in the NPRA, by proposing a qualification framework for safety-instrumented systems related to the submerged floating tube bridge concept. The concept is being addressed as a solution for the crossing of Bjørnafjorden. The framework aims to draw on several different approaches, and implement principles from RAMS engineering and IEC 61508. Focus has been placed on the transferability of a framework for qualification of safety- instrumented systems, and a framework for qualification of entire bridge concepts. To understand the basics of technology qualification, this thesis includes an in-depth review of the different approaches towards qualification {{of new technology}}. This includes the more established recommended practices, such as DNV-RP-A 203 and API-RP- 17 N. With focus on safety-instrumented systems, IEC 61508 is presented and the potential contributions of the standard towards qualification of such systems are discussed. It was identified that the central safety lifecycle from the standard is similar to a qualification process with several elements that may supplement a qualification framework. In order to adapt the framework to the NPRA s practices, central aspects and challenges of a qualification framework in the NPRA have been identified and discussed. The lack of a RAMS management framework in the agency was identified as a key challenge towards implementing a risk-based qualification framework. The scope and role of a qualification framework is another challenge that must be addressed prior to a potential implementation. Based on the challenges in the NPRA, central aspects of RAMS engineering and IEC 61508, and the established approaches towards technology qualification, a framework for qualification of safety-instrumented systems is introduced. The framework contains some new methods and approaches towards the stating of requirements and assessing readiness of technology. The framework is demonstrated on a <b>water-mist</b> fire suppression system for the submerged floating tube bridge concept over Bjørnafjorden.

40|$|Hot-dip {{galvanising}} {{is commonly}} used in industry to increase the corrosion resistance of cold-rolled steel products for commercial use such as roofing and walling of buildings. Traditionally, the zinc coated steel surface is characterised by a relatively smooth surface with large spangle relief which is detrimental to corrosion resistance. One of the techniques to modify the surface appearance consists of a <b>water-mist</b> spray solution which allows {{for the creation of}} a large number of nucleation sites giving rise to micro rather than macro spangles, thereby producing a much smoother surface. In addition, controlling the spray parameters allows the hot, zinc coated, steel surface to be ‘roughened’ facilitating its bonding to concrete or for lamination. The proper control of water droplet impact parameters such as impact velocity, droplet diameter and crater size is essential for a successful implementation of this technique. Certain aspects of the second of these processes, the production of rough, non-skid galvanised steel sheet surfaces, has been addressed by this thesis. Although an experimental investigation of the effect of such water droplet parameters on the formation of zinc surface characteristics such as crater diameter and depth would provide a great deal of valuable data it is fraught with difficulties. The presence of hot metal surfaces exceeding 450 oC and the boiling and evaporation of water droplets taking place at very small timescales (microseconds) all combine to make an experimental study difficult to implement not to say unsafe. On the other hand computer simulations with a properly constructed mathematical model are a valuable tool for the investigation of these parameters. A comprehensive modelling of the process would include the process of heat transfer: such as conduction through a vapour layer, internal droplet and vapour convection, radiation from the hot surface, solidification of the zinc liquid layer; as well as the fluid dynamical aspects: such as surface tension at the droplet-air, droplet-zinc and zinc-air interfaces, the droplet impact phenomena such as spreading and splashing and the formation of impact craters and wave propagation in a thin viscous zinc layer. As a first stage in the modelling exercise this thesis will concentrate on an investigation of single water droplet impact on a thin liquid zinc layer with a steel substrate which provides a simplified and computationally tractable model of the spraying process. The objectives of this thesis are twofold: firstly, the development and construction of an accurate, robust mathematical model and, secondly, the solution of the model for the impact of a single water droplet onto a thin liquid layer of zinc on a steel substrate. This model must be able to deal with rapidly deforming moving interfaces and maintain stability in the presence of very large density and viscosity ratios. This moving boundary problem requires the tracking of three fluid interfaces while also maintaining incompressibility. The Godunov-Marker-Particle Projection Scheme developed in this thesis is able to satisfy these requirements. Through a combination of approximate projection methods, Godunov convective differencing, Marker-Particle interface tracking and velocity filters the method is able to treat viscous, multi-fluid free surface flows. The modelling of free surface flows with more than two separate immiscible fluids, to the author’s knowledge not yet published in the literature, is a secondary aim of the thesis. A major part of the thesis deals with the thorough testing of each aspect of the combination of numerical methods used: firstly, the Poisson solver with discontinuous coefficients and homogeneous boundary conditions used in the approximate projection method, analytical solutions for the construction of an initial solenoidal velocity field, testing of the projection and velocity filters and kinematic tests of the Marker-Particle method for tracking of fluid interfaces; secondly, dynamical tests of the viscous incompressible Navier-Stokes equations for: an exact solution, the Lid-Driven Cavity and the Rayleigh-Taylor instability. The combined method is also successfully tested on the limited two-fluid droplet-solid and droplet-liquid impact problems before solving the thesis problem. It is shown that, for the impact of a single water droplet onto a thin liquid zinc layer, impact crater growth, diameter and depth, are linearly dependent on impact velocity. For a given impact velocity, crater diameter is not effected by increasing zinc layer depth although crater depth is linearly dependent. The time at which the droplet commences penetration of the zinc layer is inversely dependent on impact velocity and the maximum crater diameter and depth are nonlinearly dependent on impact velocity. The model shows that, within the convective timescale, droplet impact on thin liquid zinc layers can be approximately described by droplet spreading on a solid zinc surface. The droplet is shown to spread preferentially to the zinc layer splashing after completion of spreading. This shows that adjustment of the droplet impact velocity or zinc layer depth can vary the surface roughness appropriately...|$|E
