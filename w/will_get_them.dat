They punish abusive husbands, publicly shaming and sometimes beating them. They also {{watch out for}} and expose dowry beatings, dowry death, rape, child marriages, desertion, depriving girls of education, child molestation, and sexual harassment. They have invaded police stations to demand that police investigate these matters, {{and other things that}} affect the community such as corruption. India’s police are notoriously corrupt and sometimes only the threat of a full-scale female riot <b>will</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> to act.|$|E
25|$|Bubble sort is {{a simple}} sorting {{algorithm}}. The algorithm starts {{at the beginning of}} the data set. It compares the first two elements, and if the first is greater than the second, it swaps them. It continues doing this for each pair of adjacent elements to the end of the data set. It then starts again with the first two elements, repeating until no swaps have occurred on the last pass. This algorithm's average time and worst-case performance is O(n2), so it is rarely used to sort large, unordered data sets. Bubble sort can be used to sort a small number of items (where its asymptotic inefficiency is not a high penalty). Bubble sort can also be used efficiently on a list of any length that is nearly sorted (that is, the elements are not significantly out of place). For example, if any number of elements are out of place by only one position (e.g. 0123546789 and 1032547698), bubble sort's exchange <b>will</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> in order on the first pass, the second pass will find all elements in order, so the sort will take only 2n time.|$|E
500|$|Several {{songs and}} {{scenes from the}} show address racial issues. [...] "Colored Spade", which {{introduces}} the character Hud, a militant black male, is {{a long list of}} racial slurs ("jungle bunny... little black sambo") topped off with the declaration that Hud is the [...] "president of the United States of love". At the end of his song, he tells the tribe that the [...] "boogie man" [...] <b>will</b> <b>get</b> <b>them,</b> as the tribe pretends to be frightened. [...] "Dead End", sung by black tribe members, is a list of street signs that symbolize black frustration and alienation. One of the tribe's protest chants is [...] "What do we think is really great? To bomb, lynch and segregate!" [...] "Black Boys/White Boys" [...] is an exuberant acknowledgement of miscegenation; the U.S. Supreme Court had struck down laws against the practice in 1967. [...] Another of the tribe's protest chants is [...] "Black, white, yellow, red. Copulate in a king-sized bed." ...|$|E

500|$|... "The Climb" [...] {{has been}} covered by several amateurs and {{established}} acts. Mirror Image Records' indie rock group HelenaMaria covered {{the song and}} released it as a digital single in March 2009. At auditions for the ninth season of the television singing competition American Idol, [...] "The Climb" [...] {{was the most popular}} choice of song amongst contestants. Mandi Bierly, writing for Entertainment Weekly, commented, [...] "it sounds like we could get an Idol whose voice actually suits the inspirational tune that he or she will be forced to record as a first single. (Though the odds of that song being anywhere as good as 'The Climb'...)". While informing Cyrus of its popularity on American Idol, the series' host Ryan Seacrest commented that the contestants [...] "believe [...] a song that will make an impression and [...] <b>will</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> into that next level". Cyrus said she was pleased because the song was about [...] "following your dreams and not giving up". Alan Cumming covered the song in his cabaret tour and included it on the audio CD Alan Cumming Sings Sappy Songs: Live at the Cafe Carlyle. Australian Judah Kelly covered the song on his debut album, Count On Me (2017).|$|E

2500|$|On 19 February, Thiers {{announced}} {{the formation of}} a new government with nine ministers, a majority of republicans, including Jules Favre and Jules Simon. The first task assigned by the Assembly was to negotiate an end to the War. Thiers traveled with a delegation of five members of the Assembly to Versailles, where Bismarck was waiting. When he arrived at the hotel, he met the Prussian Field Marshal [...] Moltke, who told him, [...] "You are lucky to be negotiating with Bismarck. If it were me, I would occupy your country for thirty years and in that time {{there would be no more}} France." [...] At the first meeting, Bismarck demanded the province of Alsace and eight billion francs. Thiers insisted that France could pay no more than five billion francs, and Bismarck reduced the payment, but insisted that Germany must have part of Lorraine and Metz as well. The talks were long and stressful; at one point Thiers, exhausted, broke down and wept. Bismarck helped him to a sofa, covered him with his overcoat, and told him, [...] "Ah, my poor Monsieur Thiers, there is no one but you and I who really love France." [...] The negotiations resumed, and Thiers conceded Alsace and part of Lorraine, in exchange for a reduction in the payment. He told the other French delegates, [...] "If we lose one or two provinces it is not of great importance. There will be another war when France will be victorious, and we <b>will</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> back. But the billions we give to Germany now we will never recover." [...] Thiers insisted, however, that France keep the fortress town of Belfort. Bismarck conceded the town, on the condition that, when the armistice was signed, the Prussian army could hold a brief victory parade on the Champs-Élysées, and could remain until the treaty was ratified. Thiers felt he had little choice but to accept.|$|E
