6000|$|Far {{from our}} home by Grasmere's quiet Lake, [...] From the Vale's peace which all her fields partake, [...] Here on the bleakest point of Cumbria's shore [...] We sojourn stunned by Ocean's ceaseless roar; [...] While, day by day, grim neighbour! huge Black Comb [...] Frowns {{deepening}} visibly his native gloom, [...] 6 [...] Unless, perchance rejecting in despite [...] What on the Plain {{we have of}} warmth and light, [...] In his own storms he hides himself from sight. [...] Rough is the time; and thoughts, that would be free [...] 10 [...] From heaviness, oft fly, dear Friend, to thee; [...] Turn from a spot where neither sheltered road [...] Nor hedge-row screen invites my steps abroad; [...] Where one poor Plane-tree, having as it might [...] Attained a stature twice a tall man's height, [...] 15 [...] Hopeless of further growth, and brown and sere [...] Through half the summer, stands with top cut sheer, [...] Like an unshifting weathercock which proves [...] How cold the quarter that the wind best loves, [...] Or like a Centinel[1] that, evermore [...] 20 [...] Darkening the window, ill defends the door [...] Of this unfinished house--a Fortress bare, [...] Where strength has been the Builder's only care; [...] Whose rugged walls may still for years demand [...] The final polish of the Plasterer's hand. [...] 25 [...] --This Dwelling's Inmate more than three weeks' space [...] And oft a Prisoner in the cheerless place, [...] I--of whose touch the fiddle would complain, [...] Whose breath would labour at the flute in vain, [...] In music all unversed, nor blessed with skill [...] 30 [...] A bridge to copy, or to paint a mill, [...] Tired of my books, a scanty company! [...] And tired of listening to the boisterous sea-- [...] Pace between door and window muttering rhyme, [...] An old resource to cheat a froward time! [...] 35 [...] Though these dull hours (mine is it, or their shame?) [...] Would tempt me to renounce that humble aim. [...] --But if there be a Muse who, free to take [...] Her seat upon Olympus, doth forsake [...] Those heights (like Phoebus when his golden locks [...] 40 [...] He veiled, attendant on Thessalian flocks) [...] And, in disguise, a Milkmaid with her pail [...] Trips down the pathways of some winding dale; [...] Or, like a Mermaid, warbles on the shores [...] To fishers mending nets beside their doors; [...] 45 [...] Or, Pilgrim-like, on forest moss reclined, [...] Gives plaintive ditties to the heedless wind, [...] Or listens to its play among the boughs [...] Above her head and so forgets her vows-- [...] If such a Visitant of Earth there be [...] 50 [...] And she would deign this day to smile on me [...] And aid my verse, content with local bounds [...] Of natural beauty and life's daily rounds, [...] Thoughts, chances, sights, or doings, which we tell [...] Without reserve to those whom we love well-- [...] 55 [...] Then haply, Beaumont! words in current clear [...] Will flow, and on a <b>welcome</b> <b>page</b> appear [...] Duly before thy sight, unless they perish here.|$|E

To provide a theoretical background, existing library science studies of international students are reviewed selectively. A number of relevant linguistic and technological issues encountered in the project are discussed in detail, which may be helpful to librarians undertaking similar projects. As the trend of multiculturalism and internationalization continues in the U. S. higher education institutions and academic libraries, this project can be considered as a new way to provide practical help to international students and scholars, as well as a significant step forward to engage local and global communities...|$|R

50|$|From 1998 to 2000, Frits and Tom {{progressively}} {{stepped out}} of the project. By the summer of 1998, the Dutch Dictionary Project team consisted of six members—Dario (Italy), Peter (Sweden), Vladimir (Russia), Tom (Norway), Gustaf (Denmark) and Beaumont (France)—who decided to continue with the venture. Vladimir, the Russian Dutch Dictionary Project lead, wrote new scripts to simplify the creation of new dictionaries. The Translation Help Service was created, offering free translations courtesy of a growing team of volunteer translators. In October 2001, both the English and Dutch versions of the Dutch Dictionary Project were brought under FREELANG. The current FREELANG site is managed by Beaumont, based in Bangkok, Thailand since October 2002. In April 2003, the Spanish version was brought under FREELANG. In a major website restructuring in May 2009, English, French, German, Italian, Lithuanian, Russian, Spanish and Thai <b>welcome</b> <b>pages</b> were added, providing a portal to access the English, French and Spanish FREELANG sites.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} the normalized least squares estimator of the parameter in a mildly stationary first-order autoregressive model with dependent errors which are modeled as a mildly stationary AR(1) process.
