S. bank holding companies surrounding two events: (1) Citicorp's $ 3 billion loan-loss-reserve decision of May 19, 1987 and (2) subsequent follow-the-leader behavior by other major banking companies. Although the market anticipated rational follow-the-leader behavior and rewarded it, the events were only partially anticipated. The authors interpret the loan-loss-reserve decisions as foreshadowing the <b>write-down</b> <b>of</b> LDC <b>loans.</b> Such bookkeeping entries affect market prices because they signal economic value-enhancing corporate and strategic restructurings.

By controlling for common risk factors, we separate the bank-specific selection and monitoring abilities from the composition <b>of</b> the <b>loan</b> portfolio. In our empirical study for the period 2003 - 2011, we find that (a) banks which are specialized in certain industries have, on average, lower loan losses, (b) the loss rate of a given industry in a bank's loan portfolio is lower if the bank has major exposures to this industry, and (c) the standard deviation <b>of</b> the <b>loan</b> losses is lower {{in the case of}} more focused banks...|$|R

40|$|Statement 12 {{addresses}} the accounting for noncurrent marketable equity securities that experience {{a decline in}} market value.

" The issues are: 1. Whether SAB 59 represents a significant change in current guidance included in Statement 12 and related interpretations and how those pronouncements have been applied in practice in determining whether a charge to income is required in connection with a <b>write-down</b> <b>of</b> noncurrent marketable equity securities 2.

40|$|This study {{examines}} the timeliness <b>of</b> <b>write-downs</b> taken by U. S. financial institutions {{during the current}} financial crisis. The timeliness <b>of</b> <b>write-downs</b> is measured by benchmarking the quarterly accounting write-down schedule with the devaluation schedule implied by credit indices such as the ABX. The results show that accounting write-downs are less timely than the devaluations implied by credit indices. In a cross-sectional analysis of the determinants of the timeliness <b>of</b> <b>write-downs,</b> I document that higher corporate governance quality is positively related to timelier write-downs. Furthermore, I observe that regulatory investigations and litigation pressure are positively related to the timeliness <b>of</b> <b>write-downs,</b> whereas the writedowns by firms with more complex exposures and higher financial leverage are less timely. Regarding the consequences of timeliness, this study finds that the exposure to risky assets is reflected faster in stock returns for firms with timelier write-downs...|$|R

Short-window returns cumulated over the three days surrounding {{the announcement of the}} divestiture confirm that investor interpretations <b>of</b> asset <b>write-downs</b> are similarly contingent on write-down timeliness and prior disclosure.
