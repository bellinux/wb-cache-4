5|$|Bradman had {{words with}} Barnes after this match {{about his new}} role as an opener. Barnes later wrote: He asked me how I liked it. I said it suited me. 'You batted very well in this game,' he said, 'but not quite as an opener. You were looking for runs all the time. I think {{what you want to}} watch as an opener is not getting out... What is needed from my openers, and is most important, is {{patience}} and plenty of it.' I was completely willing to be guided by anything that Bradman <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> to do.|$|E
25|$|For {{the first}} time I liked school and for {{the first time}} I made good marks. This was almost my undoing because after I had garnered, statistically, a certain number of credits I became the {{property}} of Barnard College at Columbia, and once I was the property of Barnard I had to take, it seemed, what Barnard <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> to take, not what I wanted to learn. Fortunately my high-school marks had been so bad that Barnard decided I could not belong to it and I was therefore allowed to continue getting an education.|$|E

25|$|Davydova {{was born}} in Voronezh, 500 {{kilometres}} south of Moscow. She became interested in gymnastics at age six after seeing on television the famous Soviet Olympic gold medallists Larisa Petrik and Natalia Kuchinskaya. She practicised the splits {{to see if she}} also could do them. Deciding {{she wanted to be a}} gymnast Elena went by herself to be enrolled in Voronezh's famous Spartak Gymnastics school, yet was turned away, as she was very small, and considered at the time to have the wrong physique for the sport."They would call me Kolobok after the little fairytale pancake". Rather than giving up however, she secretly watched the lessons through windows and tried to imitate in the schoolyard what she had observed."My Mom <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> to do Piano and I would run away from it to do gymnastics".|$|E
25|$|The {{dropping}} of McCosker angered Ian Chappell and {{his teammates}} and I copped the brunt of it. I {{may have been an}} unassuming guy at the time, but I was rudely awakened to the facts of life at test level – thanks, or rather no thanks to Chappell {{and the rest of the}} team. I was not exactly welcomed with open arms into the team. In fact, I was lucky to discover my locker in the Australian dressing rooms. To top it off, Chappell figured that if I was selected to replace McCosker, that's exactly what I would do... at Number 3. I suppose you could say it was an honour to bat ahead of Ian and Greg Chappell in a test. But I have no doubts that certain members of that team <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> to fail and therefore prove that the selectors had erred. Normally, a new batsman could expect to be cradled into the side and be 'hidden' down the order until he gets the feel of the test atmosphere. There was no such deal for me. I was thrown into the deep end, to sink or swim, and that will live in my memory forever. While I am captain of a team, no batsman will be given the shoddy treatment I received on my test debut.|$|E
25|$|After my father's {{appointment}} by {{his homeland}} as state {{official in the}} customs house of Bugia for the Pisan merchants who thronged to it, he took charge; and in view of its future usefulness and convenience, had me in my boyhood come to him and there <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> to devote myself to and be instructed {{in the study of}} calculation for some days. There, following my introduction, as a consequence of marvelous instruction in the art, to the nine digits of the Hindus, the knowledge of the art very much appealed to me before all others, and for it I realized that all its aspects were studied in Egypt, Syria, Greece, Sicily, and Provence, with their varying methods; and at these places thereafter, while on business. I pursued my study in depth and learned the give-and-take of disputation. But all this even, and the algorism, as well as the art of Pythagoras, I considered as almost a mistake in respect to the method of the Hindus (Modus Indorum). Therefore, embracing more stringently that method of the Hindus, and taking stricter pains in its study, while adding certain things from my own understanding and inserting also certain things from the niceties of Euclid's geometric art. I have striven to compose this book in its entirety as understandably as I could, dividing it into fifteen chapters. Almost everything which I have introduced I have displayed with exact proof, in order that those further seeking this knowledge, with its pre-eminent method, might be instructed, and further, in order that the Latin people might not be discovered to be without it, as they have been up to now. If I have perchance omitted anything more or less proper or necessary, I beg indulgence, since there is no one who is blameless and utterly provident in all things. The nine Indian figures are: 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1. With these nine figures, and with the sign 0... any number may be written.|$|E

500|$|The {{performances}} were recorded by Japan's CBS/Sony record label {{under the supervision}} of Teo Macero, Davis' producer of 15 years. Unlike with his previous electric albums, Macero abstained from editing and splicing the recordings because, as he later told Musician magazine, [...] "the Japanese specifically <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> to leave in the spacy things." [...] They were released as two double albums—Agharta, featuring the afternoon concert, was first released in Japan in August 1975 and later in North America in 1976; the evening show was issued in Japan as Pangaea in 1976.|$|E

40|$|According to Railton: x is good forme iff my Fully Informed Self (FIS) while contemplating my {{situation}} would <b>want</b> <b>me</b> to <b>want</b> x. I offer four interpretations of this view. The first three are inadequate. Their inadequacy {{rests on the}} following two facts: (a) my FIS cannot <b>want</b> <b>me</b> to <b>want</b> what would be irrational for <b>me</b> to <b>want,</b> (b) when contemplating what is rational for <b>me</b> to <b>want</b> we must specify a particular way in which I could rationally acquire the recommended desire. As a result, what my FIS could reasonably <b>want</b> <b>me</b> to <b>want</b> is limited by what information my FIS could reliably convey to me. And therefore what my FIS could reasonably <b>want</b> <b>me</b> to <b>want</b> cannot be grounded in changes in desires that my FIS cannot publicly justify. The fourth interpretation limits the scope of what my FIS could <b>want</b> <b>me</b> to <b>want</b> {{in a way that}} avoids these problems, but conflicts with standard intuitions about what is a non-moral good...|$|R

They come up to you and they know who you are. And they go, 'We're really excited about Battlefield Earth.'" [...] This did not impress Mechanic: [...] "Do you think in any way, shape, or form that weirding me out is going to make me want to make this movie?" ...|$|E
500|$|On Christmas Day 1947, Kolish and his {{son were}} struck by a drunk driver while driving to spend the holiday with Sarria and his family. Both were killed. The coroner {{determined}} that Jonathan died first, meaning that Paul's brother inherited everything. The brother ignored Paul's wishes regarding Sarria. [...] "I would have gotten one of the houses", Sarria claimed, [...] "but he only gave me a little money and one ring. He claimed that was all Paul <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> to have. He was so evil.

[...] Joseph Mazzello had initially screen-tested for a role in Hook, but was deemed too young. Spielberg promised Mazzello that they would work together on a future film. Robin Wright turned down a role in the film. Christina Ricci auditioned for a role, but did not receive it.|$|E
