5|$|Andriamasinavalona died in 1710 <b>when</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> wives, Rasolomananambonitany, {{inadvertently}} {{pushed him}} from the elevated bed where they slept. He {{was buried in the}} royal tombs located at the Rova of Antananarivo. In opposition to Andriamasinavalona's intentions, after the king's death his sons forsook the concept of unity and instead fought one another in an effort to expand their realms. As a consequence of this decision, Imerina fragmented and was wracked with conflict for 77 years, until the kingdom was once again united during the reign of Andrianampoinimerina (17871810).|$|E
5|$|A {{dominant}} male black wildebeest {{will have}} a harem of females and will not allow other males to mate with them. The breeding season occurs {{at the end of}} the rainy season and lasts a few weeks between February and April. <b>When</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> females comes into oestrus the male concentrates on her and mates with her several times. Sexual behaviour by the male at this time includes stretching low, ears down, sniffing of the female's vulva, performing ritual urination and touching his chin to the female's rump. At the same time, the female keeps her tail upwards (sometimes vertically) or swishes it across the face of the male. The pair usually separates after copulation, but the female occasionally follows her mate afterwards, touching his rump with her snout. During the breeding season, the male loses condition as he spends little time grazing. Males are known to mount other males.|$|E

In total, Müncheberg claimed five victories in this theatre. His first three victories were over Hurricanes. The one on 20 June was claimed against pilots from either No. 1 Squadron or No. 2 Squadron of the South African Air Force (SAAF). His victory on 24 June was over Pilot Officer James Alan Frederick Sowrey of No. 6 Squadron {{who was killed in}} the engagement. His opponent on 15 July was either a No. 73 Squadron or No. 229 Squadron RAF pilot. The final two victories in North Africa of 1941 were over Curtiss P-40 Warhawks, both on 29 July 1941, from No. 2 Squadron SAAF. This took his total to 48 aerial victories.|$|E
5|$|Sjumandjaja {{was born}} in Batavia (modern day Jakarta), Dutch East Indies, and grew up there. During high school, he became {{interested}} in creative writing and acting, eventually joining the Senen Artists' Group. In 1956, <b>when</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> short stories was adapted into a film, Sjumandjaja became active in the filmmaking industry, writing two films for the production company Persari. After receiving a government scholarship, he moved to Moscow and attended the All-Union State Institute of Cinematography. Upon returning to Indonesia in 1965, Sjumandjaja {{took a job at}} the Ministry of Information and continued writing screenplays. In 1971, after leaving the ministry, he directed his first feature film, Lewat Tengah Malam (Past Midnight). He continued to write and direct films until his death from a heart attack on 19 July 1985.|$|E
5|$|Both {{candidates}} {{believed that}} the states of New York, New Jersey, Indiana, and Connecticut would determine the election. In New York, Blaine received less support than he anticipated when Arthur and Conkling, still powerful in the New York Republican party, failed to actively campaign for him. Blaine hoped {{that he would have}} more support from Irish Americans than Republicans typically did; while the Irish were mainly a Democratic constituency in the 19th century, Blaine’s mother was Irish Catholic, and he believed his career-long opposition to the British government would resonate with the Irish. Blaine’s hope for Irish defections to the Republican standard were dashed late in the campaign <b>when</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> supporters, Samuel D. Burchard, gave a speech denouncing the Democrats as the party of “Rum, Romanism, and Rebellion.” The Democrats spread the word of this insult {{in the days before the}} election, and Cleveland narrowly won all four of the swing states, including New York by just over one thousand votes. While the popular vote total was close, with Cleveland winning by just one-quarter of a percent, the electoral votes gave Cleveland a majority of 219–182.|$|E

25|$|Davies {{was already}} {{building}} a solid {{reputation as a}} film comedian when newspaper tycoon William Randolph Hearst, {{with whom she had}} begun a romantic relationship, took over management of her career. Hearst financed Davies' pictures, promoted her heavily through his newspapers and Hearst Newsreels, and pressured studios to cast her in historical dramas for which she was ill-suited. For this reason, Davies is better remembered today as Hearst's mistress and the hostess of many lavish events for the Hollywood elite. In particular, her name is linked with the 1924 scandal aboard Hearst's yacht <b>when</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> guests, film producer Thomas Ince, died.|$|E

25|$|Khosrau I's reign {{witnessed}} {{the rise of}} the dihqans (literally, village lords), the petty landholding nobility who were the backbone of later Sassanid provincial administration and the tax collection system. Khosrau I was a great builder, embellishing his capital and founding new towns with the construction of new buildings. He rebuilt the canals and restocked the farms destroyed in the wars. He built strong fortifications at the passes and placed subject tribes in carefully chosen towns on the frontiers to act as guardians against invaders. He was tolerant of all religions, though he decreed that Zoroastrianism should be the official state religion, and was not unduly disturbed <b>when</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> sons became a Christian.|$|E
25|$|He {{began his}} career as a bone surgeon at New York Cancer Hospital (which later became part of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center); however, he became more {{interested}} in cancer treatment <b>when</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> early patients, Elizabeth Dashiell, died from bone cancer. While going through hospital records, Coley found a sarcoma case study of one patient named Fred Stein, whose tumor disappeared following a high fever from erysipelas infection, now known as Streptococcus pyogenes. This sparked Coley's interest and drove him to find what few examples of similar cancer treatment had been previously recorded. He discovered that other medical pioneers including Robert Koch, Louis Pasteur, and Emil von Behring, had recorded observations of erysipelas infection coinciding with cancer regression.|$|E
25|$|The {{lineage of}} Augustus endured into {{the era of}} the Nerva-Antonine dynasty, the house that succeeded the Flavians. In {{addition}} to Cassia Longina, Junia Lepida gave birth to a son called Cassius Lepidus. Around AD 80 Lepidus had a daughter named Cassia Lepida, who married Gaius Julius Alexander Berenicianus. Julia Cassia Alexandria, Lepida's daughter by Berenicianus, married Gaius Avidius Heliodorus and ultimately gave birth to Gaius Avidius Cassius. Avidius Cassius had three children with his wife (named either Volusia Vettia or Volusia Maeciana); they were Avidius Heliodorus, Avidius Maecianus and Avidia Alexandra. In AD 175 Cassius was proclaimed emperor after he received erroneous news of the death of Marcus Aurelius, whose survival made Cassius a usurper of the empire.

25|$|After {{moving to}} Carthage, Maximus studied several Neo-Platonist writers {{and became a}} {{prominent}} author. <b>When</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> friends began espousing the Christological position known as Monothelitism, Maximus was drawn into the controversy, in which he supported the Chalcedonian position that Jesus had both a human and a divine will. Maximus is venerated in both Eastern Christianity and Western Christianity. His Christological positions eventually resulted in his torture and exile, soon after which he died. However, his theology was vindicated by the Third Council of Constantinople, and he was venerated as a saint soon after his death. His feast day is celebrated twice during the year: on 21 January and on 13 August. His title of Confessor means that he suffered for the faith, {{but not to the}} point of death, and thus is distinguished from a martyr. His Life of the Virgin is thought to be the earliest complete biography of Mary, the mother of Jesus.|$|E
