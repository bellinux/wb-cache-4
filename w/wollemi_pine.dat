25|$|The Royal Botanic Gardens in Sydney have {{published}} {{information on how}} to grow <b>Wollemi</b> <b>Pines</b> from seed which has been harvested from helicopters from the forest trees. The majority of seeds that fall from the cone are not viable so need to be sorted to retain the plump and dark ones. These can then be sown on top of seed raising mix and watered. Once the water has drained through the mix, the pot should be placed in a plastic bag and refrigerated for two weeks. After this, the pot should be removed from the plastic bag and placed somewhere warm but not very sunny until the seed germinates (remembering to keep them moist but not wet). This could take several months.|$|R

50|$|Research {{showed that}} there is {{incredibly}} low, nearly undetectable amounts of genetic diversity in the genome of the <b>Wollemi</b> <b>Pine</b> (Wollemia nobilis). The IUCN found a population count of 80 mature individuals and about 300 seedlings and juveniles in 2011, and previously, the <b>Wollemi</b> <b>pine</b> had fewer than 50 individuals in the wild. The low population size and low genetic diversity indicates that the <b>Wollemi</b> <b>pine</b> went through a severe population bottleneck.|$|E

50|$|The {{conservation}} and research includes the endangered <b>Wollemi</b> <b>Pine</b> that {{was discovered in}} 1994 in the Wollemi National Park, (part of the Greater Blue Mountains area), 200 km north-west of Sydney.

After the discovery, on or about 10 September 1994, the <b>Wollemi</b> <b>Pine</b> was first cultivated at Mount Annan in 1995. Prior to them becoming commercially available the trees were so valuable that they were grown inside steel cages to protect them from thieves. As part of the Conservation Management Plan for the pine, Mount Annan Botanic Garden is now home to the only publicly accessible collection of first generation pines (clonal replicas), in the Wollemi Walk of Discovery. The Walk was opened in March 2006 and is currently home to sixty of these Wollemi Pines.|$|E

50|$|Gymnosperms {{present in}} Australia include the cycads and conifers.

Native pines are distributed through 3 families , 14 genera and 43 species, of which 39 are endemic. Most species are present in wetter mountainous areas consistent with their Gondwanan origins, including the genera Athrotaxis, Actinostrobus, Microcachrys, Microstrobos, Diselma and the Tasmanian Huon pine, sole member of the genus Lagarostrobos. Callitris is a notable exception; species from this genus are found mainly in drier open woodlands.

5000|$|The Greater Blue Mountains Area is a World Heritage Site in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales, Australia. The 1032649 ha {{area was}} {{inscribed on the}} World Heritage List at the 24th Session of the World Heritage Committee, held in Cairns in 2000 with the {{following}} inscription: ...a deeply incised sandstone tableland that encompasses 1.03 million hectares of eucalypt-dominated landscape just inland from Sydney, Australia’s largest city, in south-eastern Australia. Spread across eight adjacent conservation reserves, it constitutes {{one of the largest}} and most intact tracts of protected bushland in Australia. It also supports an exceptional representation of the taxonomic, physiognomic and ecological diversity that eucalypts have developed: an outstanding illustration of the evolution of plant life. A number of rare and endemic taxa, including relict flora such as the <b>Wollemi</b> <b>pine,</b> also occur here. Ongoing research continues to reveal the rich scientific value of the area as more species are discovered.The geology and geomorphology of the property, which includes 300 metre cliffs, slot canyons and waterfalls, provides the physical conditions and visual backdrop to support these outstanding biological values. The property includes large areas of accessible wilderness in close proximity to 4.5 million people. Its exceptional biodiversity values are complemented by numerous others, including indigenous and post-European-settlement cultural values, geodiversity, water production, wilderness, recreation and natural beauty.
