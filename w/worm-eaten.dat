25|$|Both {{accounts}} {{agree that}} most of Kidd's men now abandoned him for Culliford. Only 13 remained with Adventure Galley. Deciding to return home, Kidd left the Adventure Galley behind, ordering her to be burnt because she had become <b>worm-eaten</b> and leaky. Before burning the ship, {{he was able to}} salvage every last scrap of metal, such as hinges. With the loyal remnant of his crew, he returned to the Caribbean aboard the Adventure Prize.|$|E
500|$|The novel {{ends at the}} end of Francia's life, {{with him}} condemning Patiño to death for {{supposedly}} plotting against him, followed by Francia's death in a fire in 1840. [...] As the characters and plot disintegrate, so apparently does the novel. [...] The final line is another interpolation: [...] "(the remainder stuck together, illegible, the rest unable to be found, the <b>worm-eaten</b> letters of the Book hopelessly scattered)." [...] And yet, this is not quite the last word, as it is followed by a [...] "Final Compiler's Note" [...] that reflects on the compilation and the book as a whole. [...] Here the novel seems to pass responsibility on to [...] "the no less fictitious and autonomous reader." ...|$|E
500|$|The New York Herald {{was founded}} on May 6, 1835 by James Gordon Bennett, a Scottish {{immigrant}} {{who came to the}} United States aged 24. [...] Bennett, a firm Democrat, had established a name in the newspaper business in the 1820s with dispatches sent from Washington to the New York Enquirer, most sharply critical of President John Quincy Adams and Secretary of State Henry Clay; one historian called Bennett [...] "the first real Washington reporter". Bennett was also a pioneer in crime reporting; while writing about a murder trial in 1830, the Attorney General of Massachusetts attempted to restrict the coverage of the newspapers: Bennett criticized the move as an [...] "old, <b>worm-eaten,</b> Gothic dogma of the Courts…to consider the publicity given to every event by the Press, as destructive to the interests of law and justice". The fight over access eventually overshadowed the trial itself.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the center}} of the {{concrete}} pad was an anchor. The anchor was manufactured specifically for the site. The [...] anchor was hand-welded using rough iron to give it a unique look. A slightly <b>worm-eaten</b> wooden crossbar was inserted into the top of the anchor. The crossbar was painted black to protect it, and on the crossbar was a brass tablet was riveted to the crossbar on which was written: ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the end of}} this cruise San Bernard {{returned}} to Galveston in early September. [...] The ship was badly <b>worm-eaten.</b> Despite authorization to have her repaired in New Orleans, no funds were provided to pay for the work by the Minister of War and Marine. Later that month, the San Bernard was driven ashore by a gale, and lacking the $500 required to refloat her and have her repaired she became a deserted hulk in Galveston harbor.|$|E
2500|$|Nirvana, Cypress Hill and the Breeders {{performed}} a concert at Pier 48 on December 13, 1993, which was recorded for MTV. Until 1999, the pier was the Seattle terminal for a ferry service to Victoria, British Columbia using the ship Princess Marguerite. After the final {{departure of the}} Princess Marguerite, Pier 48 became home to a museum ship, the Soviet-era Foxtrot class submarine Cobra. The Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) purchased the pier from the Port of Seattle in 2008. [...] Citing safety and the expense of maintaining the buildings on the <b>worm-eaten</b> pier, WSDOT demolished the [...] warehouse on the pier in July 2010 {{in order to use}} the space as a staging area for the coming demolition of the nearby Alaskan Way Viaduct.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, however, writers like Thomas Heywood and Thomas Nashe praised battle scenes in general as often being {{intrinsic}} {{to the play}} and not simply vulgar distractions for the illiterate. In Piers Penniless (1592), Nashe praised the didactic element of drama that depicted battle and martial action, arguing that such plays were {{a good way of}} teaching both history and military tactics to the masses; in such plays [...] "our forefather's valiant acts (that have lain long buried in rusty brass and <b>worm-eaten</b> books) are revived." [...] Nashe also argued that plays that depict glorious national causes from the past rekindle a patriotic fervour that has been lost in [...] "the puerility of an insipid present," [...] and that such plays [...] "provide a rare exercise of virtue in reproof to these degenerate effeminate days of ours." [...] Similarly, in An Apology for Actors (1612), Heywood writes, [...] "So bewitching a thing is lively and well-spirited action, that it hath power to new mould the hearts of the spectators, and fashion them to the shape of any noble and notable attempt.") More recently, Michael Goldman has argued that battle scenes are vital to the overall movement and purpose of the play; [...] "the sweep of athletic bodies across the stage is used not only to provide an exciting spectacle but to focus and clarify, to render dramatic, the entire unwieldy chronicle." ...|$|E

60|$|He {{had still}} the linstock of his {{gun in his}} own hand. He made a sudden {{exchange}} of the two instruments, and turning on the <b>worm-eaten</b> stool and table, beat them to pieces in a few blows.|$|E
60|$|Turning in despair, Babbalanja spied {{a heap of}} <b>worm-eaten</b> {{parchment}} covers, {{and many}} clippings and parings. And whereas the rolls of manuscripts did smell like unto old cheese; so these relics did marvelously resemble the rinds of the same.|$|E
60|$|Lutchester {{took his}} arm, and they passed down the dusty aisle between the <b>worm-eaten</b> and {{decaying}} benches {{and through the}} outside door, which Lutchester closed and locked behind them. The rush of cold air was like new life to Graham.|$|E
60|$|I {{had seen}} the {{equipment}} of the infantry.

60|$|Anon, {{the three}} men {{examined}} {{the door of the}} pavilion, and shaking the rusty bolts, found that they would not yield.

60|$|Poor devil! {{he tries}} not to show his hurts.

60|$|Having {{commenced}} our observations, {{we should}} certainly have extended them to another dozen {{of people at}} least, had not a sudden shutting up and putting away of the <b>worm-eaten</b> old books, warned us that the time for closing the office had arrived; and thus deprived us of a pleasure, and spared our readers an infliction.|$|E
60|$|As hinted, {{the general}} {{impression}} is extremely curious. Little light being admitted, and everything being {{of a dark}} colour, there is an indefinable Indian aspect of duskiness throughout. A strange, woody smell, also--more or less pervading every considerable edifice in Polynesia--is at once perceptible. It suggests the idea of <b>worm-eaten</b> idols packed away in some old lumber-room at hand.|$|E
60|$|This {{was a large}} room, like a salon, and had a big {{table in}} it of {{enduring}} oak and well preserved; but the chair were <b>worm-eaten</b> and the tapestry on the walls was rotten and discolored by age.

60|$|Stephen Smith {{revisited}} Endelstow Vicarage, agreeably to his promise. He had {{a genuine}} artistic reason for coming, though no such reason {{seemed to be}} required. Six-and-thirty old seat ends, of exquisite fifteenth-century workmanship, were rapidly decaying in an aisle of the church; and it became politic to make drawings of their <b>worm-eaten</b> contours ere they were battered past recognition in the turmoil of the so-called restoration.|$|E
60|$|Nothing gives a {{stronger}} idea of old <b>worm-eaten</b> aristocracy--of a family being crazy with age, {{and of its}} being time that it was extinct--than these black, dusty, faded, antique-dressed portraits, {{such as those of}} the Oliver family; the identical old white wig of an ancient minister producing somewhat the impression that his very scalp, or some other portion of his personal self, would do.|$|E
60|$|Outside a thin, {{persistent}} rain {{mixed with}} snow pattered against the small window panes, and an icy wind found {{out all the}} crevices in the <b>worm-eaten</b> woodwork that would afford it ingress to the room.

They had wrapped their cloaks round their shoulders, and did not feel the chill currents of air that caused the lamp to flicker and to smoke.|$|E
