5|$|Dogon villagers did {{not have}} {{electric}} lighting and spent most nights outdoors, talking and sleeping; so they <b>were</b> <b>apparently</b> an ideal population for detecting a lunar influence; none was found.|$|E
5|$|All of the aircrew {{involved}} in the crash had only limited flying time {{in the months before}} the crash. The B-52's aircrew <b>were</b> <b>apparently</b> unaware that the aircraft had stalled until shortly before impact, indicated by a failure to apply standard recovery techniques to the aircraft once it entered the stall. The investigation reported that, even if the proper stall recovery techniques had been applied, the aircraft was likely too low to recover before hitting the ground.|$|E
5|$|Between {{then and}} the late 1940s these two {{estimates}} were commonly cited by reporters and the media. For example, Edgar Snow stated in his 1941 book, The Battle for Asia, that 42,000 were massacred in Nanking and 300,000 in total between Nanking and Shanghai, figures which <b>were</b> <b>apparently</b> based on these estimates. The 1944 film, The Battle of China, stated that 40,000 {{were killed in the}} Nanking Massacre.|$|E

5000|$|The gold wreath <b>was</b> <b>apparently</b> rarely, if ever, worn in life, but {{a number}} {{have been found in}} graves from much earlier periods. Based on the plant wreaths given as prizes in contests, the idea <b>was</b> <b>apparently</b> to {{celebrate}} the achievements of the deceased in life.|$|R
5|$|Exmoor {{also has}} a henge located near to Parracombe, {{although}} it has been damaged by ploughing. Alongside this, the moor bears a profusion of other Bronze Age monuments, including between 300 and 400 round barrows, standing stones, and linear stone settings. The creation of these different monument types might explain why so few stone circles <b>were</b> <b>apparently</b> created here.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, {{researchers}} have found nitrates in ice cores from Antarctica at depths corresponding to the known supernovae of 1006 and 1054 AD, {{as well as from}} around 1060 AD. The nitrates <b>were</b> <b>apparently</b> formed from nitrogen oxides created by gamma rays from the supernovae. This technique should be able to detect supernovae going back several thousand years.|$|E
5|$|In {{an article}} {{published}} on 8May several satellite experts questioned the analysis of satellite pings made by Inmarsat staff because the Doppler frequency shifts measured <b>were</b> <b>apparently</b> not properly corrected against the satellite's own drift (a periodic North-South oscillation of 3° every 24hours). Without any additional data being released, the implication of this new analysis was that the northern portion of the Inmarsat satellite pings arc could not be ruled out. The Malaysian government released the satellite data three weeks later.|$|E

5|$|Janet Burnett Grossman {{writes that}} girls {{appear to be}} commemorated about as {{frequently}} as boys on surviving Attic gravestones, although previous scholars suggested that boys were commemorated up to twice as often. If they survived, Athenian children were named in a ceremony (the dekate) ten days after birth. Other Athenian ceremonies celebrating childbirth (at five, seven, and forty days after birth) were also observed. Later rites of passage <b>were</b> <b>apparently</b> more common and elaborate for boys than for girls.|$|E
5|$|One of Bart's early {{hallmarks}} was his prank {{calls to}} Moe's Tavern owner Moe Szyslak in which Bart calls Moe {{and asks for}} a gag name. Moe tries to find that person in the bar, but soon realizes it is a prank call and angrily threatens Bart. These calls <b>were</b> <b>apparently</b> based {{on a series of}} prank calls known as the Tube Bar recordings, though Groening has denied any causal connection.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{thatched}} {{houses in}} Little Thetford {{was destroyed by}} fire. Reported in the Cambridge Chronicle 6 November 1930, {{the cause of the}} fire at the c.13th-century six-room building was not known. Fireworks were being discharged {{at the other end of}} the village. All that remained were burnt beams and smouldering walls, which <b>were</b> <b>apparently</b> made of old fen-mud. The villagers saved the nearby Three Horseshoes public house, by forming a bucket chain, and pouring water on its thatched roof.|$|E

5|$|The Dinosaur Park Formation is {{interpreted}} as a low-relief setting of rivers and floodplains that became more swampy and influenced by marine conditions over time as the Western Interior Seaway transgressed westward. The climate was warmer than present-day Alberta, without frost, but with wetter and drier seasons. Conifers <b>were</b> <b>apparently</b> the dominant canopy plants, with an understory of ferns, tree ferns, and angiosperms.|$|E
5|$|The assailants <b>were</b> <b>apparently</b> {{targeting}} Rami Amira, who {{was sitting}} at a table nearby with Moti Hassin and Simantov Hatayeb, who are all identified with the Abergil group, in an effort to resolve an internal dispute. Amira sustained a slight injury in his cheek {{as a result of the}} attack. He was killed on 2 February 2011 in Rishon Letzion, presumably by the Abergil organization which, according to police sources, continued to operate while the two Abergil brothers were extradited and awaiting trial in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Though rarely {{encountered}} {{because of}} its oceanic habitat, a handful of documented attacks on humans <b>were</b> <b>apparently</b> caused by cookiecutter sharks. Nevertheless, this diminutive shark is not regarded as highly dangerous. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed the cookiecutter shark under Least Concern, as it is widely distributed, has no commercial value, and is not particularly susceptible to fisheries.|$|E

5|$|As {{part of the}} {{scientific}} exchange, the Maud Committee's findings were conveyed to the United States. One of its members, the Australian physicist Mark Oliphant, flew to the United States in late August 1941 and discovered that data provided by the Maud Committee had not reached key American physicists. Oliphant then {{set out to find}} out why the committee's findings <b>were</b> <b>apparently</b> being ignored. He met with the Uranium Committee and visited Berkeley, California, where he spoke persuasively to Ernest O. Lawrence. Lawrence was sufficiently impressed to commence his own research into uranium. He in turn spoke to James B. Conant, Arthur H. Compton and George B. Pegram. Oliphant's mission was therefore a success; key American physicists were now aware of the potential power of an atomic bomb.|$|E
5|$|Haakon over-wintered at the Bishop's Palace in Kirkwall, Orkney, {{with plans}} to resume his {{campaign}} the next year. During his stay in Kirkwall he however fell ill, and died {{in the early hours}} of 16 December 1263. Haakon was buried in the St Magnus Cathedral in Kirkwall for the winter, and when spring came he was exhumed and his body taken back to Norway, where he was buried in the Old Cathedral in his capital Bergen. Centuries later, in 1531, the cathedral was demolished by the Danish feudal overlord Eske Bille for military purposes in connection with the Protestant Reformation, and the graves of Haakon and other Norwegian kings buried there <b>were</b> <b>apparently</b> destroyed in the process.|$|E
5|$|However, Osborn had {{no control}} over his Super-Adaptoid abilities; he would {{automatically}} absorb the powers of any superhuman he touched, even if he did not consciously want to. He was also limited in how many powers his body could hold, as the A.I.M. scientists warned him that absorbing too many powers at once could overload his systems. In the end, he inadvertently absorbed the abilities of all the Avengers and New Avengers when they all touched him at once, and the unstable combination of their multiple different powers caused significant damage to his body chemistry, resulting in him going into a coma. After he regained consciousness, these powers <b>were</b> <b>apparently</b> burnt out, returning him to his Goblin-level strength instead.|$|E

5|$|In 2002, P. Mausfeld and D. Vrcibradic {{published}} {{a note on}} the nomenclature of the Noronha skink informed by a re-examination of Gray's original type specimens; despite extensive attempts to correctly name the species, they <b>were</b> <b>apparently</b> the first to do so since Boulenger in 1887. Based on differences in the number of scales, subdigital lamellae (lamellae on the lower sides of the digits), and keels (longitudinal ridges) on the dorsal scales (located on the upperparts), as well as the separation of the parietal scales (on the head behind the eyes) in maculata, they concluded that the two were not, after all, identical, and that Schmidt's name Mabuya atlantica should therefore be used. Mausfeld and Vrcibradic considered Mabouya punctatissima to represent a different species on the basis of morphological differences, but were unable to resolve the status of Trachylepis (Xystrolepis) punctata.|$|E
5|$|In May 1946, SMERSH agents {{recovered}} from the crater where Hitler was buried two burned skull fragments with gunshot damage. These remains <b>were</b> <b>apparently</b> forgotten in the Russian State Archives until 1993, when they were re-found. In 2009 DNA and forensic tests were performed on the skull fragment, which Soviet officials had long believed to be Hitler's. According to the American researchers, the tests revealed that the skull was actually that of a woman and {{the examination of the}} sutures where the skull plates come together placed her age at less than 40 years old. The jaw fragments which had been recovered in May 1945 were not tested.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} letter to Tacitus, Pliny the Younger {{suggested}} that his uncle's death {{was due to the}} reaction of his weak lungs to a cloud of poisonous, sulphurous gas that wafted over the group. However, Stabiae was 16km from the vent (roughly where the modern town of Castellammare di Stabia is situated) and his companions <b>were</b> <b>apparently</b> unaffected by the volcanic gases, and so {{it is more likely that}} the corpulent Pliny died from some other cause, such as a stroke or heart attack. His body was found with no apparent injuries on the next day, after dispersal of the plume.|$|E
