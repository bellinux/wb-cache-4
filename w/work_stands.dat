25|$|In {{addition}} to his research on metamorphosis, Swammerdam's entomological <b>work</b> <b>stands</b> out because {{he was among the}} first people to study insects in a systematized fashion (i.e., careful dissection, comparison of different species, and use of the microscope). His anatomical and behavioral descriptions of bees, wasps, ants, dragonflies, snails, worms, and butterflies were major contributions to the nascent field of entomology in the late seventeenth century.|$|E
25|$|He {{was one of}} {{the first}} European {{producers}} to fully exploit the possibilities of using multi-track recording facilities to create dramatic production effects and treatments that acted as musical and rhetorical elements in their own right, rather than mere gimmicks. He favoured sometimes harsh-sounding effects and contrasting audio spaces for each element in the mix. His best <b>work</b> <b>stands</b> in stark opposition to the smooth, 'evened-out' sound that predominated in most commercial pop and rock at that time.|$|E
25|$|The Croghan family {{suppressed}} the topographic element of Kämper's map, {{and it is}} not known to survive today, although the cave map portion of Kämper's <b>work</b> <b>stands</b> as a triumph of accurate cave cartography: not until the early 1960s and the advent of the modern exploration period would these passages be surveyed and mapped with greater accuracy. Kämper returned to Berlin, and {{from the point of view}} of the Mammoth Cave country, disappeared entirely. It was not until the turn of the 21st century that a group of German tourists, after visiting the cave, researched Kämper's family and determined his fate: the young Kämper was killed in trench warfare in World War I at the Battle of the Somme in 1916.|$|E

500|$|A {{new edition}} of The Chess-Player's Manual was {{published}} in 1888, this one with a 122-page appendix by Lipschütz. Steinitz wrote that [...] "Mr Gossip has produced a useful work, which in some respects must be regarded even superior to that of Staunton or any other previous writers on the chess openings.... But the most meritorious distinguishing feature of the Manual is the large collection of illustrative games by various first-class masters, and in that respect Mr Gossip's <b>work</b> <b>stands</b> second only to Signor Salvioli's Teoria e Pratica among the analytical works in any language." [...] The following year, Steinitz cited it in The Modern Chess Instructor {{as one of the}} 12 principal authorities he had relied on in writing that treatise.|$|E

Remixes were produced by Thunderpuss, Johnny Rocks & Mac Quayle and Tracy Young. Chris Cox from Thunderpuss explained, [...] "Basically, they were dong the greatest-hits album... and so they approached actually a couple of different remix entities to take a stab at doing a megamix, {{and it was kind of}} a cattle call, actually. They basically liked ours the best and so they put it out." [...] The remix peaked at number five on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart in 2001. The [...] "GHV2 Megamix"s accompanying music video, directed by Dago Gonzalez of Veneno Inc., was compiled of images of Madonna's live performances and previous music videos and premiered on November 2, 2001, through Total Request Live (TRL) and MTV's website. Chuck Taylor from Billboard complimented the remix, saying that [...] "its quite a trip down 80s memory lane from an artist whose continually evolving body of <b>work</b> <b>stands</b> strong—even when summarized in this novel context." ...|$|E

2500|$|In Nelega's view, Gârbea, [...] "one of {{the truly}} alive writers of his time", was among the few debuting local playwrights to have their works staged by {{prominent}} Romanian directors—Alexandru Darie, Alexandru Hausvater and Gavril Pinte. Gârbea's fellow România Literară contributor, literary historian Alex. Ştefănescu, contrasted his writings with the [...] "boring" [...] works by some of his contemporaries, and claimed that [...] "directors and actors take pleasure in staging [...]" [...] Gârbea's <b>work</b> <b>stands</b> out within its cultural and temporal context for its size and diversity. Aretzu sees him as [...] "one of the most ubiquitous authors in present-day literature, [...] gifted with a great availability in processing reality", while critic and academic Nicolae Oprea believes him to be [...] "the most prolific" [...] among the Bucharest-based group formed in the 1990s. Literary reviewer Daniel Cristea-Enache also describes his colleague as [...] "multilateral" [...] who [...] "can adapt himself with great ease to any particular genre's specificity". Writing in 2007, Ştefănescu defined him a [...] "one-man orchestra [...] of the apathetic (and sometimes shy-brazen) Romanian literature of today." [...] According to Moldovan writer Emilian Galaicu-Păun: [...] "As productive as an entire literary school , Horia Gârbea is a veritable Stakhanovite of writing, who has dealt in all genres and species". Gârbea is also among the post-1990 Romanian authors to have received recognition abroad. In addition to the performances of The Serpent and Il émmagement, Gârbea's Raţă cu portocale has been translated into German by Veronika Dreichlinger (Ente mit Apfelsine, published in 2005). His work was also included into English-, French-, German-, Russian- and Serbian-language anthologies.|$|E

60|$|From the 23d of May {{the work}} of fortifying and pushing forward our {{position}} nearer to the enemy had been steadily progressing.

The enemy had countermined, but {{did not succeed in}} reaching our mine. At this particular point the hill on which the rebel <b>work</b> <b>stands</b> rises abruptly. Our sap ran close up to the outside of the enemy's parapet. In fact this parapet was also our protection.

60|$|In {{internal}} form, as well, Browning often {{defies the}} established laws of literature. Distorted and elliptical sentences, long and irrelevant parentheses, curious involutions of thought, and irregular or incoherent {{development of the}} narrative or the picture, often leave the reader in despair even of the meaning. Nor can these departures from orderly beauty always be defended by the exigencies of the subjects. They do not fit the theme. They are the discords of a musician who either has not mastered his instrument or is not sensitive to all the finer effects. Some of his <b>work</b> <b>stands</b> out clear from these faults: A Toccata of Galuppi's, Love Among the Ruins, the Songs from Pippa Passes, Apparitions, Andrea del Sarto, and a score of others might be cited to show that Browning could write {{with a sense of}} form as true, and an ear as delicate, as could any poet of the century, except Tennyson.|$|E

60|$|GILBERT. Certainly. Anybody {{can write}} a three-volumed novel. It merely {{requires}} a complete ignorance of both life and literature. The difficulty that I should fancy the reviewer feels is the difficulty of sustaining any standard. Where there is no style a standard must be impossible. The poor reviewers are apparently reduced to be the reporters of the police-court of literature, the chroniclers of the doings of the habitual criminals of art. It is sometimes said of them {{that they do not}} read all through the works they are called upon to criticise. They do not. Or at least they should not. If they did so, they would become confirmed misanthropes, or if I may borrow a phrase from one of the pretty Newnham graduates, confirmed womanthropes {{for the rest of their}} lives. Nor is it necessary. To know the vintage and quality of a wine one need not drink the whole cask. It must be perfectly easy in half an hour to say whether a book is worth anything or worth nothing. Ten minutes are really sufficient, if one has the instinct for form. Who wants to wade through a dull volume? One tastes it, and that is quite enough--more than enough, I should imagine. I am aware that there are many honest workers in painting as well as in literature who object to criticism entirely. They are quite right. Their <b>work</b> <b>stands</b> in no intellectual relation to their age. It brings us no new element of pleasure. It suggests no fresh departure of thought, or passion, or beauty. It should not be spoken of. It should be left to the oblivion that it deserves.|$|E
