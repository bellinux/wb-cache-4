5|$|A {{flock of}} birds {{encountered}} the hurricane over eastern Virginia; hundreds of birds were killed {{and fell to the}} ground near Old Point Comfort, many stripped of their feathers. The outer rainbands of the storm produced heavy amounts of precipitation near Washington, D.C., canceling a baseball game between the Detroit Tigers and the Washington Senators after the field was flooded. In Ocean City, Maryland, the hurricane was considered the worst in 40years. The hurricane produced 80mph (130km/h) <b>winds</b> and rough waves along the Delaware Capes, indicating hurricane-force <b>winds</b> affected the state. It was one of only two storms on record to produce such <b>winds</b> in the state.

30|$|The <b>wind</b> power {{prediction}} error probability distribution is very complex {{due to the}} nonlinear relationship between the <b>wind</b> speed and <b>wind</b> power: when the <b>wind</b> speed {{is less than the}} cut-in <b>wind,</b> the <b>wind</b> power is 0; when the <b>wind</b> speed is between the cut-in <b>wind</b> speed and the rated <b>wind</b> speed, the <b>wind</b> power will be the smooth output; when the <b>wind</b> speed is between the rated <b>wind</b> speed and the cut-out <b>wind,</b> the <b>wind</b> power will maintain its maximum power; when the <b>wind</b> speed is greater than the cut-out <b>wind</b> speed, the <b>wind</b> power will be 0. Therefore, based on the nonlinear relationship between <b>wind</b> speed and <b>wind</b> power, the prediction distribution of <b>wind</b> power is complex.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. With {{the massive}} {{development}} {{and application of}} <b>wind</b> energy, <b>wind</b> power is having an increasing proportion in power grid. The changes of the <b>wind</b> speed in a <b>wind</b> farm will lead to fluctuations in the power output which would affect the stable operation of the power grid. Therefore the research {{of the characteristics of}} <b>wind</b> speed has become a hot topic in the field of <b>wind</b> energy. In the paper, the <b>wind</b> speed at the <b>wind</b> farm was simulated in a combination of <b>wind</b> speeds by which <b>wind</b> speed was decomposed of four components including basic <b>wind,</b> gust <b>wind,</b> stochastic <b>wind</b> and gradient <b>wind</b> which denote the regularity, the mutability, the gradual change and the randomness of a natural <b>wind</b> respectively. The model is able to reflect the characteristics of a real <b>wind,</b> easy for engineering simulation and can also estimate the <b>wind</b> energy of a <b>wind</b> farm through the <b>wind</b> speed and wake effect model. This paper has directive significance in the estimation of <b>wind</b> resource and the layout of <b>wind</b> turbines in <b>wind</b> farms...|$|R

5|$|After {{affecting}} Guam, Halong quickly strengthened {{and reached}} its peak <b>winds</b> on July12. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center estimated peak 1‑minute <b>winds</b> of 250km/h (155mph), while the Japan Meteorological Agency estimated 10‑minute <b>winds</b> of 155km/h (100mph). Subsequently, the typhoon weakened greatly while curving to the northeast, although it still passed near Okinawa with strong <b>winds</b> that left widespread power outages. Halong struck southeastern Japan, dropping heavy rainfall and producing strong <b>winds</b> that left $89.8million (¥10.3billion 2002JPY) in damage. There was one death {{in the country and}} nine injuries. Halong became extratropical on July16 and dissipated the next day. The typhoon influenced the monsoon trough in the Philippines, contributing to flooding and deaths in the country.|$|E
5|$|Although Fran passed {{near the}} Azores as a hurricane, <b>winds</b> {{on the islands}} only reached 45mph (75km/h) and no damage was recorded. On October12, a French ship {{encountered}} the storm, recording sustained <b>winds</b> of 40mph (65km/h) and an air pressure of 981mbar (hPa; 28.97inHg).

30|$|Big <b>wind</b> farms must be {{integrated}} to power system. <b>Wind</b> power from big <b>wind</b> farms, with randomness, volatility and intermittent, will bring adverse {{impacts on the}} connected power system. High precision <b>wind</b> power forecasting is helpful to reduce above adverse impacts. There {{are two kinds of}} <b>wind</b> power forecasting. One is to forecast <b>wind</b> power only based on its time series data. The other is to forecast <b>wind</b> power based on <b>wind</b> speeds from weather forecast. For a big <b>wind</b> farm, due to its spatial scale and dynamics of <b>wind,</b> <b>wind</b> speeds at different <b>wind</b> turbines are obviously different, that is called <b>wind</b> speed spatial dispersion. Spatial dispersion of <b>wind</b> speeds and its influence on the <b>wind</b> power forecasting errors have been studied in this paper. An error evaluation framework has been established to account for the errors caused by <b>wind</b> speed spatial dispersion. A case study of several <b>wind</b> farms has demonstrated that even if the forecasting average <b>wind</b> speed is accurate, the error caused by <b>wind</b> speed spatial dispersion cannot be ignored for the <b>wind</b> power forecasting of a <b>wind</b> farm.|$|R
30|$|<b>Wind</b> speed {{measurement}} is collected from day-ahead <b>wind</b> data [9]. Based on the <b>wind</b> speed, <b>wind</b> power output {{can be calculated}} by (15). Cut in <b>wind</b> speed, rated <b>wind</b> speed and cut off <b>wind</b> speed for Skystream <b>wind</b> turbine respectively are 3.5  m/s, 9  m/s and 25  m/s.|$|R
30|$|The current <b>wind</b> speed {{forecasting}} {{model can}} be classified into physical model and historical <b>wind</b> model. The former is used to forecast <b>wind</b> speed based on numerical weather report while the latter uses historical <b>wind</b> speed to extrapolate. <b>Wind</b> resource has certain regional feature which means different positions has varies values in a <b>wind</b> farm. But at present researches always assume that <b>wind</b> speed of every <b>wind</b> turbines in a <b>wind</b> farm is equal [2, 3, 4] {{at the same time}} when studying <b>wind</b> model we often assume. Apparently, these models cannot accurately reflect the <b>wind</b> speed in reality [5, 6]. Therefore, it will affect <b>wind</b> farm outputs because lack of <b>wind</b> speed correlation and further influence power dispatching and power system operation. In order to improve the capability of energy-saving power generation dispatching and <b>wind</b> power consumption, studying the influence of correlative <b>wind</b> of large <b>wind</b> farm is essential and <b>wind</b> speed polymerized model should be introduced.|$|R

5|$|As Typhoon Tingting {{approached}} the Mariana Islands, three Chinese women drowned in rough seas {{produced by the}} storm in Saipan. On June28, Tingting produced strong <b>winds</b> throughout the region. Sustained <b>winds</b> on Guam reached 82km/h (51mph) with gusts to 106km/h (66mph); a pressure of 994.6hPa (mbar) was also recorded on the island. Although located closer {{to the center of}} Tingting, Rota reported lower <b>winds</b> than Guam; the highest sustained wind reached 70km/h (44mph) with gusts of 93km/h (58mph). Due to the lack of sufficient observations on Tinian, the highest sustained <b>winds</b> recorded were suspected to be lower than what they really were. <b>Winds</b> of 56km/h (35mph) were recorded several times with gusts to 84km/h (52mph). Sustained <b>winds</b> on Saipan were recorded up to 100km/h (62mph) with gusts to 124km/h (77mph); a pressure of 984.9hPa (mbar) was also recorded.

40|$|We study {{whether a}} <b>wind</b> {{augmented}} <b>wind</b> turbine is effective {{for improving the}} efficiency of <b>wind</b> turbines or not. An augmentation device creases mass flow rate through a <b>wind</b> turbine, {{and the power of}} a <b>wind</b> augmented <b>wind</b> turbine becomes large. On the other hand, the augmentation device makes the size of a <b>wind</b> turbine increase. So, improving the efficiency depends on the rate of increased power and size.

5|$|As {{a natural}} force, {{the wind was}} often personified as one or more wind gods or as an {{expression}} of the supernatural in many cultures. Vayu is the Hindu God of Wind.

Aeolus, in varying interpretations the ruler or keeper of the four <b>winds,</b> has also been described as Astraeus, the god of dusk who fathered the four <b>winds</b> with Eos, goddess of dawn. The Ancient Greeks also observed the seasonal change of the <b>winds,</b> as evidenced by the Tower of the <b>Winds</b> in Athens.

40|$|<b>Wind</b> is the {{principal}} driver in the <b>wind</b> erosion models. The hourly <b>wind</b> speed data were generally required for precisely <b>wind</b> erosion modeling. In this study, a simple method to generate hourly <b>wind</b> speed data from daily <b>wind</b> statistics (daily average and maximum <b>wind</b> speeds together or daily average <b>wind</b> speed only) was established. A typical windy location with 3285 days (9 years) measured hourly <b>wind</b> speed data were used to validate the downscaling method. The {{results showed that the}} overall agreement between observed and simulated cumulative <b>wind</b> speed probability distributions appears excellent, especially for the <b>wind</b> speeds greater than 5 m s- 1 range (erosive <b>wind</b> speed).
