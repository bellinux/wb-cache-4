It was kind of true, {{but it was also}} a bit tongue-in-cheek. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> told that might be the reason. It’s a six-minute song, which {{requires}} maturity for listening. What they specifically said, apparently, was that the voice was too mature. I don’t know if that means I sound old or I sound intelligent. I’m going to hope that it’s the latter.|$|E
500|$|Yeah, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> {{disappointed}} [...] {{because it}} sold really well.

Cory Edwards {{traveled to}} this studio {{a total of}} fifteen times {{over the course of}} the film's three-year production and has explained that although the house was located in an expensive part of Manila, the rent was no more than that of his two-bedroom apartment in Los Angeles. When Cory was not able to be on site, Todd took over directing duties. [...] "Along with Tony, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> a 'three headed monster,'" [...] Cory explains.

Vocalist David Draiman said, [...] "song {{was put out}} there to just whet everybody's appetite.

500|$|The lyrics {{were written}} with Hoppus and DeLonge going into {{separate}} rooms—Hoppus writing the choruses and DeLonge writing the verses. The two {{had not spoken}} {{to each other about}} the lyrics ahead of time, {{and it turned out that}} the two had both written about sex. When put together, the song represents the lustful side of sex during the verses, the passionate side in the bridge and the romantic side in the chorus, creating a juxtaposition between both voices. It has been interpreted as a description for failed romance, one that [...] "illustrates a scenario of lust, ambivalence and regret." [...] For Barker, the song's drum track was [...] "super in respect to John Bonham. [...] <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> messing around with the verse. It’s like, 'Well, I want to do a four-bar drum intro and just see how it works for the song.' And we never second-guessed it. We were like, 'That sounds rad.'" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} also subject to less {{favorable}} reviews from critics who were {{disappointed with the}} gaps in Michael and Walt's story. Steve Heisler of Time Out [...] "wasn't all-too-pleased", citing the story's predictability. TMZ's Daniel called [...] "Meet Kevin Johnson" [...] "solid, but not spectacular" [...] {{and gave it a}} grade of a [...] "C+", writing that [...] "this episode fell a little short … I feel like <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> robbed of half of the 'What Happened to Michael?' story. It was interesting to see how far into depression he sunk … And they did give him a pretty good reason for working for Ben … But I can't shake the feeling that we missed a good opportunity". He further commented that [...] "Tom would make a great football coach—his motivational speeches are awesome." [...] TV Squad's Erin Martell was unsatisfied with Michael's flashback and the lack of Walt, asking [...] "What was their cover story when they got back to the mainland? … they couldn't do a genuine flashback scene because of … Kelley's growth spurt, but they could have worked around that." [...] Oscar Dahl of BuddyTV ranked it as the second worst episode of the season; his colleague John Kubicek was also critical, and commented that the flashback [...] "essentially tells us things we already know without telling us much more." ...|$|E

That would be a really good story." [...] It was later confirmed by Channel 4 that Lister's character would be involved in a sexual relationship with Sarah during the new late night series Hollyoaks Later. After the screening of the scenes, Lister explained: [...] "It was quite nerve-wracking actually as I'm good friends with Loui — it's quite a strange thing to smooch a really good friend so we had to get over the giggles and think 'right, just do it!'" [...] Also commenting on her worries about the scenes, she said: [...] "I thought it was hilarious! I thought it'd be interesting, though. I was obviously quite worried about them. Loui [...] and I chatted a lot when we found out {{that it was going to}} be in the late-night eps and we were wondering 'oh no, what does this mean?!' But in the end, they weren't graphic or anything like that, so it was fine." [...] She continued: [...] "It was completely mental filming them. Loui and I just had a massive attack of the giggles.

[...] Sud describes the series as [...] "slow-burn storytelling {{in a sense that}} every moment that we don't have to prettify or gloss over or make something necessarily easy to digest, that we're able to go to all sorts of places that are honest, and dark, and beautiful and tragic, {{in a way that is}} how a story should be told." ...|$|R
500|$|Roger Newcomb and Matt Richenthal, {{writing for}} {{websites}} We Love Soaps and TV Fanatic respectively, both described {{the decision to}} replace Russ with Nichols as surprising. Allison Waldman of AOL TV said the recast was [...] "bad news", as Russ was [...] "doing just fine as Tucker McCall, new billionaire in Genoa City". However, she also wrote that the role would be [...] "better suited" [...] for Nichols with Tucker becoming more of a [...] "romantic figure". Tara Blake of TVSource speculated that the character would be tied to a [...] "major Genoa City player" [...] {{and that was the}} reason for the recast. Gwen Morrett of About.com said that Nichols joining The Young and the Restless was [...] "truly their gain" [...] from Days of Our Lives (where the actor had previously portrayed Steve Johnson). Upon Nichols' debut, Megan Lynn of SoapNet wrote: [...] "Stephen certainly has soap experience — he's previously played Steve Johnson on Days of our Lives and Stefan Cassadine on General Hospital, but then again — <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> warming up to William." [...] Michael Fairman of On-Air On-Soaps wrote of the decision to hire Nichols onto the series: [...] "This week, daytime fans get one of their wishes, to see Stephen Nichols back on daytime. From his role as Stefan on GH to Patch on DAYS, you know that Stephen Nichols is going to play Tucker for all he is worth, and then some." [...] In August 2010, Tommy Garrett of Canyon News wrote of Nichols' portrayal, saying: [...] "Now going into the 21st century, Stephen has reinvented another part of himself and inhabits Genoa City as the town’s newest and most handsome billionaire on CBS’s number-one daytime drama The Young and the Restless." ...|$|E

Although, I {{think the thing that}} changed {{everything}} was how quickly the ratings were off the charts. By spring, nine months into the show, we were No. 1 — and No. 1 in a big way — and we realized that no matter what we did, we weren’t going to get away from each other.” ...|$|E

5000|$|Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film a poor review, two stars out of four, saying: [...] "What <b>we</b> get <b>is</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> a {{condensed}} version {{of some of}} {{the sights and sounds of}} the novel, without the heart, the spirit and the juicy detail." ...|$|R

5000|$|... “Blood Inside is {{not really}} that much of an {{electronic}} album, but it uses {{a lot of the}} technology we learned from our electronica phase. It showed us a different way to make records (while) still following different musical perspectives. They changed all of mine; it's not just true for me, it's true for most people. Blood Inside is like a monster kaleidoscope of illusions, very neatly arranged. As it seems now the next record is going to be without all that covering and more humble, with a more heartbreaking atmosphere; it's {{not going to be the}} same at all. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> circular; it's reaction, anti-reaction, reaction, anti-reaction... it plays off each other; that's the way we work.

He's never really done a metal band before but overall I think he did a pretty fantastic job. He got a real live quality out of us because we were always used to doing drums first and then the bass, and then the guitar and then the vocals at the very end. This time we recorded most of the songs live with the whole band and then after one song was done, Warrel would immediately sing on it [...] of saving all of [...] to the very end, which kind of saves his voice in the overall recording process.

2500|$|For Season 2, Koenig {{teamed up}} with Mark Boal, the Academy Award winning screenwriter of The Hurt Locker and Zero Dark Thirty, and his {{production}} company, Page 1. Boal had {{conducted a series of}} interviews with Bergdahl as part of a film production he was working on, and both Boal and Bergdahl gave Koenig permission to use those excerpts of those recorded interviews in episodes of Serial. As Koenig stated in Season 2's first episode: [...] "They'd come to us saying 'hey, we've been doing all this reporting on the story, and we've also got this tape. Do you think you might want to listen?' And yes, we did, and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> blown away, and so we began working with them.

I wasn't over well acquainted with Mr. Fynes, although a good many people seemed to fancy that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> bosom friends. That newspaper man, for instance, {{met me at the}} station and stuck to me like a leech; drove down here with me, and was willing to stand all the liquor I could drink. Then there was a gentleman from Scotland Yard, who was in such a hurry that he came to see me in my bedroom. He had a sort of an idea that I had been brought up from infancy with Hamilton Fynes and could answer a sheaf of questions a yard long.

5000|$|Paul credits Public Enemy {{as being}} a {{significant}} influence on early De La Soul production, saying, [...] "Early Public Enemy production used layers upon layers and layers, and their arrangements were always super duper incredible to me. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> like students to what they did." ...|$|E

5000|$|The musical {{style of}} Crosses is often {{referred}} to as electronic, darkwave or dark pop, dream pop or witch house. However, Carson O'Shoney of Consequence of Sound and Daniel Brockman of The Boston Phoenix note that Crosses only shares a resemblance to witch house in aesthetics and imagery, and not the group's actual music. O'Shoney said that Crosses' witch house influence is [...] "noticeable just by looking at the tracklist—every song has at least one † in it. The name of the band is †††. The name of the EP is †. Everything about the EP points to witch house—until you listen to the actual music." [...] The group's decision to use this imagery stems from Chino Moreno's interest in the art and mystique around religion. Moreno however also said, [...] "I didn't want people to think <b>we</b> <b>are</b> a religious band, a satanic band or that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> a witch-house band. It's difficult using a religious symbol, but at the same time, I think in an artistic way, it can totally go somewhere else and I think <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> walking that line." ...|$|R

5000|$|Dorothy Lawson is a Canadian cellist and {{composer}} based in New York City. She {{is best known}} as a co-founder and artistic director of the string quartet ETHEL.

5000|$|Vocalist James Graham {{commented on}} the {{difference}} between the band's live show and the album, stating that, [...] "If you came to see us live before you actually heard the record or any recordings we made, you'd probably think <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> a noisy band. If you had the record and sat down with it, you can totally see it's more than noise." ...|$|E
2500|$|The band {{subsequently}} reissued {{its debut}} studio album, Queens of the Stone Age (1998), in 2011, and embarked upon an extensive tour playing the album in full each night. Homme stated, [...] "Doing the rehearsals {{for the first}} record is really defining the new one. It's been turning the new record into something else. What <b>we</b> <b>were</b> doing <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> bluesy, and now it's turned into this trancey, broken thing. The robots are back!" [...] However, in 2013, Homme noted, [...] "I was hoping that playing the first record would really inspire me and make me {{fall in love with}} music again. But I think I was just lost, looking for something in the dark. In that dark I found ...Like Clockwork." ...|$|R

5000|$|Kelliher {{also stated}} that the album's theme might be [...] "death". He stated the following: [...] "It always makes for really good story telling. It's <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> the theme {{that we have a}} lot in our music. We've had a lot of friends pass away since the last record. I'm not really sure yet. I think we're <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> {{focusing}} more about living on this earth and what would happen if this was your last year to live.
