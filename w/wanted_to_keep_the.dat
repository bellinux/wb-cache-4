5|$|An action {{scene was}} filmed with a motion-control camera, a first in Indian cinema. Although the {{producers}} <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> film's climax (featuring several cricketers from the Indian team and filmed at a Bangalore stadium in June 2004) a secret, {{it was revealed}} in the media. Filming wrapped in July 2004.|$|E
5|$|Edge's {{letters to}} Fiske show that Edge {{regarded}} Morphy as lazy and rather helpless, and {{himself as the}} one who would make Morphy's name immortal, and that Morphy <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> negotiations with Staunton discreet while Edge insisted on making them as public as possible.|$|E
5|$|O'Malley was {{featured}} {{prominently in the}} HBO documentary film , which chronicled his executive management of the Brooklyn/Los Angeles Dodgers. The documentary focuses on the post World War II glory years of the franchise and presents a compelling case that O'Malley truly <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> Dodgers in Brooklyn in a stadium near a railroad station, but {{he was unable to}} get the proper support from Moses.|$|E

5|$|The {{majority}} of the live action footage was deleted; because Bakshi <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> breakdancing sequences, he used rotoscoping to animate the footage, but did not animate all of the movements for budgetary reasons. Little dialogue from the 1974 cut of the film was retained in the animated version, which instead featured newly recorded dialogue by Proval, Romanus, and Philip Michael Thomas, who had starred in Coonskin.|$|E
5|$|Before all the {{steerage}} passengers {{had even}} {{a chance of}} their lives, the Titanics sailors fastened the doors and companionways leading up from the third-class section... A crowd of men {{was trying to get}} up to a higher deck and were fighting the sailors; all striking and scuffling and swearing. Women and some children were there praying and crying. Then the sailors fastened down the hatchways leading to the third-class section. They said they <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> air down there so the vessel could stay up longer. It meant all hope was gone for those still down there.|$|E
5|$|Duhalde was {{appointed}} {{president in the}} aftermath of the September 11 attacks, when the foreign policy of the United States was strictly focused on the War on Terror. Initially, the Argentine society was divided on how to manage the bilateral relations with the US. One group <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> close relations of the previous decade, as Argentina might need foreign help to deal with the crisis. The other group preferred to maintain more distant relations. Duhalde sought to strike a balance between both options, and eventually leaned towards the second when the US refused to help Argentina.|$|E

5|$|The Revolutionary War was {{ended by}} the Treaty of Paris in 1783, and by 1785 the Continental Navy was disbanded and the {{remaining}} ships were sold. The frigate , which had fired the last shots of the American Revolutionary War, was also the last ship in the Navy. A faction within Congress <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> ship, but the new nation {{did not have the}} funds to keep her in service. Other than a general lack of money, factors for the disarmament of the navy were the loose confederation of the states, a change of goals from war to peace, and more domestic and fewer foreign interests.|$|E
5|$|Although Emily Huskisson had <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> service {{small-scale}} {{and free}} from pageantry, William Huskisson {{had been an}} instrumental figure {{in the development of}} Liverpool and there was a huge amount of sympathy and respect for him. Almost all the city's inhabitants who were in a position to attend the funeral lined the route; it was estimated that 69,000 people, roughly half the city's population, attended. Reports spoke of all available space at every window being packed with onlookers, other than the house in Duke Street in which Huskisson had stayed for the 10 days before the journey, and of people climbing trees and crowding onto roofs for a better view, despite rain and hail.|$|E
5|$|Dino Crisis {{utilizes}} {{an original}} 3D engine with real-time environments, {{as opposed to}} the pre-rendered backgrounds of the Resident Evil series. Mikami chose a real-time engine to enable better cinematic action and more dramatic character depictions that would otherwise be impossible. However, with the real-time engine came the challenge of hardware limitations, making it difficult for the team to create detailed environments. The team had to forego a jungle scene because of this issue. Mikami did however believe the team was able to create sufficiently detailed environments despite the hardware's polygon limitations. Like Resident Evil, the game takes place indoors in an enclosed environment. Mikami <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> claustrophobic feelings, thinking it was better to build fear.|$|E

5|$|For the game's localization, {{the main}} focus {{was to keep the}} {{dialogue}} natural and accessible to Western players, while also staying true to the Japanese version. The Japanese version had several instances of puns or cultural jokes, which would not have worked if they had been translated literally. There were also places in the script where the development team would have liked to insert jokes in the localization, but thought that it may be inappropriate to do so since the joke was not in the Japanese version. The team found difficulties in getting the Western version's tone right, as they <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> localized text interesting, {{and at the same time}} avoid inconsistencies with the original version's tone.|$|E
5|$|In early 1965, Treasury Secretary C. Douglas Dillon {{wrote to}} President Lyndon Johnson, {{opposing}} the dollar and {{pointing out that}} the coins would be unlikely to circulate in Montana or anywhere else; they would simply be hoarded. Nevertheless, Dillon concluded that as Senator Mansfield insisted, the coins would have to be struck. Dillon resigned on April 1; his successor, Henry H. Fowler, was immediately questioned by Mansfield about the dollars, and he assured the senator that things would be worked out to his satisfaction. Mint Director Eva Adams hoped to avoid striking the silver dollars, but <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> $600,000 appropriated for that expense. Senator Mansfield refused to consider any cancellation or delay and on May 12, 1965, the Denver Mint began trial strikes of the 1964-D Peace dollar—the Mint had obtained congressional authorization to continue striking 1964-dated coins into 1965.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, {{a series of}} letters between Eldon {{businessmen}} and Carl E. Smith, the newly-inherited owner of the house, revealed differing opinions on continued use of the house: Smith wanted to renovate the house and protect it from vandalism only; the Eldon leaders were more in favor of making the house a historic site. The house was abandoned {{for much of the}} 1970s—a bullet was fired in an upstairs bedroom; weather and vandalism took their toll as well. Only in the late 1980s did the owner of the property consider turning the house over to the state. Indeed, many southern Iowans were conflicted on the issue—the owner <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> house only because he believed the current renters would have nowhere else to go if they were forced to leave.|$|E

5|$|Negotiations {{between the}} owners, led by {{commissioner}} David Stern, and the players, led by director Billy Hunter and president Derek Fisher {{of the labor}} union National Basketball Players Association (NBPA), began in early 2011 and continued through November. The main issues dividing both sides were the division of revenue {{and the structure of}} the salary cap and luxury tax. Owners proposed to reduce the players' share of basketball related income (BRI) from 57% to 47%, but the players countered with 53% of BRI. Owners wanted to implement a hard salary cap and a harsher luxury tax, hoping to increase competition among teams, whereas players <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> current soft salary cap structure intact.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{directed}} and written by Shu Takumi, {{as the second}} entry in a planned Ace Attorney trilogy. It was originally intended to feature the first game's prosecutor, Miles Edgeworth, in all episodes; Franziska was created when the development team learned that Edgeworth had become popular among players, and Takumi {{wanted to use the}} character more carefully and sparingly. They only introduced one new gameplay mechanic in the game; Takumi <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> game focused on the core concept of finding lies, and to keep it simple enough for his mother to play. The game was positively received by critics, who generally liked the writing, but criticized the game's short length and the lack of the Nintendo DS-exclusive gameplay mechanics that appeared in the previous game.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{arrival at}} the facility, some of the prisoners were {{selected}} for beatings or execution. Survivors reported {{that some of the}} detainees were escorted to the brickyard, from which shots could be heard, and those detainees were not seen again. One surviving prisoner later reported that he witnessed the killing of one prisoner in the camp itself, when Serbian paramilitaries slit the victim's throat in front of detainees. Other prisoners were beaten during interrogations, were shot and wounded, or were otherwise abused. On 19 November, gradual transfer of the detainees to Sremska Mitrovica prison in Serbia started. These transfers caused a clash between Vujić and the Croatian Serb TO, as the latter <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> detainees under their control.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the most}} notable moments in the race came from a near-fatal {{accident}} when stunt man Joe Canutt, Yakima Canutt's son, was tossed into the air by accident; he incurred a minor chin injury. Marton <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> shot, but Zimbalist felt the footage was unusable. Marton conceived the idea of showing that Ben-Hur was able to land on and cling {{to the front of}} his chariot, then scramble back into the quadriga while the horses kept going. The long shot of Canutt's accident was cut together with a close-up of Heston climbing back aboard, resulting in one of the race's most memorable moments. Boyd did all but two of his own stunts. For the sequence where Messala is dragged beneath a chariot's horses and trampled, Boyd wore steel armor under his costume and acted out the close-up shot and the shot of him on his back, attempting to climb up into the horses' harness to escape injury. A dummy was used to obtain the trampling shot in this sequence.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea for}} Atlantis: The Lost Empire was {{conceived}} in October 1996 when Don Hahn, Gary Trousdale, Kirk Wise, and Tab Murphy lunched at a Mexican restaurant in Burbank, California. Having recently completed The Hunchback of Notre Dame the producer and directors <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> Hunchback crew together for another film with an Adventureland setting. Drawing inspiration from Jules Verne's A Journey to the Center of the Earth (1864), {{they set out}} to make a film which would fully explore Atlantis (compared to the brief visit depicted in Verne's novel). While primarily utilizing the Internet to research the mythology of Atlantis, the filmmakers became interested in the clairvoyant readings of Edgar Cayce and decided to incorporate some of his ideas—notably that of a mother-crystal which provides power, healing, and longevity to the Atlanteans—into the story. They also visited museums and old army installations to study the technology of the early 20th century (the film's time period), and traveled 800feet underground in New Mexico's Carlsbad Caverns to view the subterranean trails which would {{serve as a model for}} the approach to Atlantis in the film.|$|E
5|$|Unchained {{includes}} {{all the characters}} from the GameCube version, and four more characters — Blaze, Frost, Jax and Kitana — from Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance that are exclusive to the PlayStation Portable version. The four characters have only one Fatality and no Hara-kiri in contrast to other characters, most likely because that was all they had in Deadly Alliance. Exclusive to the Unchained version is the Endurance mode, where players can compete against a constant wave of opponents. The system's wireless ad hoc network functionality {{can be used for}} multiplayer games. Characters who remain hidden in the other versions appear unlocked by default in Unchained; producer Shaun Himmerick explained that the staff wanted to show players characters that were difficult to obtain in Deception, such as Liu Kang. Although Midway did not develop the game, they helped Just Games Interactives optimize their code and the Wi-Fi feature, as they <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> frame rate very high. Metacritic gave it an average of 70 from 14 reviews. Jeff Haynes from IGN mentioned problems with the controls and criticized the long loading times.|$|E
