5|$|After the {{founding}} of Night School Studio, the team set up a casting call for voice actors on Backstage. Prior to actors being cast and their lines recorded, the team had placeholder subtitles in the game. Lead engineer Bryant Cannon recalled that without the voices, he was unsure whether the game {{would be fun to}} play; after the voices were added, he could see the characters as believable people having conversations. Hines directed recording sessions, allowing him to change dialogue on-the-fly if he felt material did not <b>work</b> <b>when</b> voiced by the actors. All of the actors voiced their lines separately, with their conversations in-game stitched together in post-production.|$|E
5|$|Beebe had {{a troubled}} {{relationship}} {{with some of}} his superiors at the zoo, particularly Hornaday, who was resentful of Beebe's constant demands for more funding and staff, as well as the fact that as Beebe's career progressed he gradually devoted less and less time to caring for the zoo itself. One particular point of disagreement was Beebe's forgetfulness about returning books which he had borrowed from the Zoological Society's Library, which would occasionally go missing for years as a result. However, Hornaday never publicly expressed his disagreements with Beebe, and did not hesitate to defend Beebe's <b>work</b> <b>when</b> others criticized it.|$|E

5|$|Döblin's 1924 {{science fiction}} novel recounts {{the course of}} human history from the 20th to the 27th century, portraying it as a catastrophic global {{struggle}} between technological mania, natural forces, and competing political visions. Berge Meere und Giganten (Mountains Seas and Giants) presciently invokes such topics as urbanization, the alienation from nature, ecological devastation, mechanization, the dehumanization of the modern world, as well as mass migration, globalization, totalitarianism, fanaticism, terrorism, state surveillance, genetic engineering, synthetic food, the breeding of humans, biochemical warfare, and others. Stylistically and structurally experimental, it {{was regarded as a}} difficult <b>work</b> <b>when</b> it first came out and has often polarized critics. Among others, Günter Grass has praised the novel's continued relevance and insight.|$|E
5|$|Fleiss' kappa (named after Joseph L.

The measure calculates the degree of agreement in classification over that which would be expected by chance. There is no generally agreed-upon measure of significance, although guidelines have been given.|$|E

Cassatt immediately began a major capital improvement program, which included both adding capacity to mainlines and constructing large stations including Washington Union Station and New York Penn Station.
