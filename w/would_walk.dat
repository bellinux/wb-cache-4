5|$|My first {{memory of}} {{fragrance}} is my mother, {{and as a}} very young girl, hearing her footsteps... Her stilettos click, click, clicking on the hardwood floor and she wore a beautiful fragrance and she <b>would</b> <b>walk</b> past me and it would just stay in the room. It left a warm feeling every time I thought about her scent. I think about the icons that I respect {{and they all have}} their own fragrance so I thought {{it was time for me}} to have my own.|$|E
5|$|A crew of over 200 craftspeople and {{technicians}} constructed the three principal sets: {{the surface of}} the alien planetoid, and the interiors of the Nostromo and the derelict spacecraft. Art Director Les Dilley created -scale miniatures of the planetoid's surface and derelict spacecraft based on Giger's designs, then made moulds and casts and scaled them up as diagrams for the wood and fiberglass forms of the sets. Tons of sand, plaster, fiberglass, rock, and gravel were shipped into the studio to sculpt a desert landscape for the planetoid's surface, which the actors <b>would</b> <b>walk</b> across wearing space suit costumes. The suits themselves were thick, bulky, and lined with nylon, had no cooling systems and, initially, no venting for their exhaled carbon dioxide to escape. Combined with a heat wave, these conditions nearly caused the actors to pass out: nurses had to be kept on-hand with oxygen tanks.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with her}} classmates, she {{was chosen by}} Kamehameha III to be {{eligible}} for the throne of the Kingdom of Hawaii. She was taught in English by American missionaries Amos Starr Cooke and his wife, Juliette Montague Cooke, alongside her royal cousins. She was taught reading, spelling, penmanship, arithmetic, geometry, algebra, physics, geography, history, bookkeeping, singing and English composition by the missionary couple. In the classroom students were divided by their age and/or length of time at the school. The older group consisted of Moses Kekūāiwa, Lot Kapuāiwa, Alexander Liholiho, William Charles Lunalilo, Jane Loeau, Bernice Pauahi, Abigail Maheha and Elizabeth Kekaʻaniau who had attended the school since 1839. The next class consisted of Emma Rooke, James Kaliokalani, Peter Kaʻeo and David Kalākaua. Due to her late attendance, Mary Paʻaʻāina was placed in the youngest class together with Victoria Kamāmalu, Lydia Kamakaʻeha (Liliʻuokalani), and John William Pitt Kīnaʻu. During their Sunday procession to church it was customary for boys and girls to walk side by side, Paʻaʻāina <b>would</b> <b>walk</b> beside her first cousin Peter Kaʻeo.|$|E

5|$|In the Second World War, at age 45, Smythe again {{served in}} the Canadian Army. Initially, he was a captain {{in charge of a}} troop within the Canadian Officers Training Corps, based at the University of Toronto. In 1941, along with Colonel Richard Greer, he formed the 30th Battery, a sportsmen's {{anti-aircraft}} battery {{that was part of the}} 7th Toronto Regiment, Royal Canadian Artillery, Canadian Active Army. Smythe was made acting major and Officer Commanding. He was offered a higher rank to become the army's sports officer, but turned it down. After first serving on Vancouver Island to defend against Japanese attack, the Battery embarked in September 1942 to England. After being stationed in England for nearly two years, Smythe and his unit were sent to France in July 1944, where within three weeks he was badly wounded when the Germans bombed an ammunition depot. For the rest of his life he <b>would</b> <b>walk</b> with a limp and suffer bowel and urinary tract problems. He was sent back to Canada in September on a hospital ship.|$|E
5|$|J.R.R. Tolkien found {{inspiration}} in the Malvern landscape {{which he had}} viewed from his childhood home in Birmingham and his brother Hilary's home near Evesham. He {{was introduced to the}} area by C. S. Lewis, who had brought him here to meet George Sayer, the Head of English at Malvern College. Sayer had been a student of Lewis, and became his biographer, and together with them Tolkien <b>would</b> <b>walk</b> the Malvern Hills. Recordings of Tolkien reading excerpts from The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings were made in Malvern in 1952, at the home of George Sayer. The recordings were later issued on long-playing gramophone records. In the liner notes for J.R.R Tolkien Reads and Sings his The Hobbit & The Fellowship of the Rings, George Sayer wrote that Tolkien would relive the book as they walked and compared parts of the Malvern Hills to the White Mountains of Gondor.|$|E

25|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that young hadrosaurs <b>would</b> have <b>walked</b> on only their two hind legs, while adults <b>would</b> have <b>walked</b> on all four. As the animal aged, the front limbs became more robust {{in order to}} take on weight, while the back legs became less robust as they transitioned to walking on all four legs. Furthermore, the animals’ front limbs were shorter than their back limbs.|$|R

25|$|While {{there have}} been {{numerous}} cases of extradition of third country nationals from either country to the other, there had never been a US citizen extradited by the USA to the Czech Republic.

25|$|Because of labour {{and fund}} shortages, {{construction}} of the cathedral progressed slowly. Benedictine masons <b>would</b> <b>walk</b> daily between their Monastery in Subiaco and the construction site. In January 1864, construction was suspended {{because of a lack}} of money. Eventually further funds were raised and the building completed, for a total cost of £4,000. The cathedral was blessed and opened on 29 January 1865.|$|E

25|$|Regulations on {{clothing}} {{were confirmed}} inside Moldavia by two orders of Mihail Kogălniceanu, Minister of Internal Affairs (issues in 1859 and 1860 respectively).

25|$|In later, secular times, {{the bell}} ringer would {{pass through the}} streets of villages, towns or cities announcing the name of a {{recently}} deceased person, with details of the funeral.

The bell was also sometimes used to indicate {{the point at which the}} coffin-bearers were changed.|$|E
25|$|He was {{eccentric}} and careless. He <b>would</b> <b>walk</b> with {{pipe and}} paper along a thriving thoroughfare oblivious of all; his hat {{shaped like a}} French general's, peak in front and back; shoes well worn; clothes shabby, and was in meeting reticent, even timid... He treated the subject of Socialism plainly and stripped it of utopianism.... The peoples {{of the future will}} dwell in peace where this hardy pioneer warred with the accumulated prejudice, passions, and ignorance of the ages.|$|E
