500|$|Since its airing and {{continuation}} into Season 3, [...] "Peter" [...] {{has been}} considered a keystone episode for the series. Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly called [...] "Peter" [...] the episode [...] "when Fringe crossed over from fitfully great to just plain great", and continues to maintain that quality throughout 2010. Times James Poniewozik ranked [...] "Peter" [...] as the 5th best television episode of 2010, stating that it both [...] "fleshed out its mythology" [...] and [...] "deepened the emotional backstory", and further praised Noble's acting in the episode. The A.V. Club ranked Fringe the 15th best show of 2010, highlighting [...] "Peter" [...] as an episode that [...] "finally dramatized the moment that changed [...] life, giving the series’ overarching storyline a devastating emotional core, based in a father’s love instead of in theoretical concept". The Futon Critic ranked [...] "Peter" [...] as the 9th best episode of 2010, calling it a [...] "series defining episode that not only rationalized {{what appeared to be}} the unforgivable but also raised the stakes on everything <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> expect from the show thus far".|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from television critics. Jessica Morgan from Television Without Pity awarded the episode a [...] "C–" [...] grade. John Keegan from Critical Myth gave the episode a largely positive review and awarded it an 8 out of 10. He wrote, [...] "Overall, {{this was a}} very enjoyable and balanced episode. It gave us the scares, the humor, and the layered commentary that <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> expect from the series. With only five episodes to go, it’s the perfect time for 1013 to be giving the series a good bit of resolution, even if it’s more metaphorical than actual." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five. The two enjoyed Schnauz's script, calling it [...] "better than most" [...] of season nine's episodes, and noted that he wrote it with [...] "pace and wit". They noted, however, that the entry's self-references [...] "feel like carping [...] at the audience who are still left to complain." [...] Despite this, Shearman and Pearson also positively critiqued several of the episode's juxtapositions, such as the scene featuring Scully performing an autopsy on a cat while wearing a kitchen apron that says [...] "something smells goooood", calling them [...] "the funniest of the season". M.A. Crang, in his book Denying the Truth: Revisiting The X-Files after 9/11, called the episode a [...] "solid little entry", saying that it was a [...] "nice spin on the isolation stories that the series has always done so effectively".|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. HitFix Senior Editor Alan Sepinwall wrote that [...] "Timothy Dalton was everything <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> expect {{from him in}} the part: scary and dangerous and then so much the funnier {{for the way he}} kept trying to work the steps and turn over a new leaf. The episode left 's sincerity up in the air for most of the hour - was he really serious about making amends, or just trying to distract Chuck from his latest evil plan? - but Volkoff is such a well-drawn character, and Dalton so talented and versatile, that the comedy worked either way... Vivian, on the other hand? I'd been iffy on her in her most recent appearance, and putting her on camera with , even briefly, was just a reminder of how much less she brings to the table." [...] Ryan McGee of The A.V. Club gave the episode a A-. Though he praised Dalton's performance, McGee wrote, [...] "The direct parallels between Chuck and Vivian haven't really panned out in the way the show initially envisioned it. Let's face it: These two aren't exactly Buffy and Faith in terms of being foils for one another. The show has never painted Chuck as ever potentially going to the dark side. It has used Casey and occasionally Sarah to serve that function at times, but never Chuck. At this point, he's as set in his moral code as possible. Had the Vivian storyline happened at the outset of his Intersect 2.0 days, perhaps the taste of power could have gone to his head, with Vivian {{as an example of the}} road not taken. As such, Vivian's existence largely serves to connect her to the larger spy world of the show, not draw a direct parallel to the support system that helped Chuck overcome any potential temptations." [...] Eric Goldman of IGN gave this episode a score of 8 out of 10, writing, [...] "This Chuck got off to a shaky start. I don't know how to put my finger on it exactly, but the pacing felt off in the first third or so of the episode... Thankfully, things picked up considerably as the episode went along – I'd say the turning point was the scene in which Chuck was sent in to meet with the pirates. The way Chuck's big announcement that he worked for Alexei Volkoff immediately led to a bunch of guns pulled on him was funny, as was not only Chuck asking to play Uno (for his life), but that the pirate did indeed have the game." [...] Carl Cortez of Assignment X, however, gave the episode a negative review, calling it [...] "a painfully nonsense driven episode that's now grasping at straws in an attempt to round out the last part of the season with an adequate storyline." ...|$|E

[...] Unlike earlier segregated hotels and boarding houses, the Somerville (and later the Dunbar) offered luxury amenities – a restaurant, cocktail lounge and barbershop.
