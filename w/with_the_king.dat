In March 1137 Roger was <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>king</b> right before the king sailed to Normandy, as the chancellor witnessed a charter of the king just prior to his departure.

5|$|In February 1779, Lafayette reached Paris. For disobeying {{the king}} {{by going to}} America, he was placed under house arrest for eight days.

5|$|In November 1167 Foliot {{was summoned}} to Normandy, then ruled by Henry II, to meet with papal legates and the king.

Henry also offered a compromise {{on the subject of the}} Constitutions of Clarendon, that the legates accepted. However, when the legates met with Becket on 18November, it quickly became apparent that Becket would not accept negotiations <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>king</b> nor accept the legates as judges of either case against him. As the legates had no mandate to compel Becket to accept them as judges, the negotiations came to an end <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>king</b> and bishops still appealing to the papacy.|$|E

5|$|Richard's time as {{archbishop}} {{was much}} less stormy than Becket's had been, {{and he seems to}} have had better relations <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>king.</b> Richard attended the royal councils, and more than once was <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>king</b> in Normandy. Richard was less dogmatic {{on the rights of the}} clergy than his great predecessor had been; but his compromises were regarded by the monastic writers and the followers of Becket as a sign of weakness. Pope Alexander III took Richard to task when Richard acquiesced in the election of bishops taking place in the royal chapel. As part of his diplomatic efforts on the king's behalf, Richard escorted Henry's daughter Joan to Provence on her journey in 1176 to marry King William II of Sicily. Richard also spent part of 1177 in Flanders on diplomatic business for King Henry.|$|E
