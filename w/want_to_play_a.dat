Kidman was author Philip Pullman's preferred choice for the role ten years before production of the film, and despite initially rejecting the offer to star as she did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> villain, she signed on after receiving a personal letter from Pullman.|$|E
25|$|Naomie Harris was {{initially}} reluctant to portray Paula, stating {{that she did}} not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> stereotypical depiction of a black woman. When addressing her concerns, Jenkins emphasized the character’s representation of both his and McCraney's mothers. Harris later commented that although she had previously vowed not to portray a crack addict, the film's script and director's tolerance appealed to her. In preparation for her role, Harris watched interviews of those with addiction to crack cocaine, and met with addicted women. She related her experiences of bullying to the addicts' attempts of escaping trauma.|$|E
500|$|Kojima {{received}} much fan mail; one letter {{was from a}} girl who stated she did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> game with an old man. He took this into consideration; {{he and his team}} designed a character more appealing to women, resulting in Raiden's appearance. Designer Yoji Shinkawa noted that he and the other character designers took a great deal of inspiration for Raiden's appearance from the bishōnen archetype. Because Raiden was a new character the staff designed him carefully, giving him white hair to symbolize his introduction. Shinkawa further noted that Raiden ended up with an overall feminine appearance. His outfit (the Skull Suit) was difficult to [...] design until the staff decided on a [...] "bonelike" [...] concept. Shinkawa wanted to make Raiden sexually appealing, emphasizing the tightness of his clothing.|$|E

500|$|Following {{the success}} of The Dark Knight, Eckhart next {{appeared}} in Alan Ball's Towelhead (2008), an adaption of the Alicia Erian novel of the same name, in which he played a Gulf War Army reservist who sexually abuses his 13-year-old Arab-American neighbor. The film was screened under the name Nothing is Private at the 2007 Toronto International Film Festival. When he was first approached for the role, Eckhart revealed {{that he did not}} <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> [...] "pedophile". When asked about the sex scenes, Eckhart said: [...] "Those were difficult times.... The way I did it was to really trust Alan. It was in the words. I really trusted Summer , and I tried to get her to trust me, to build a relationship when we were doing physical scenes. We'd really rehearse them mechanically, and I'd say, 'OK, I'm going to put my hand here, I'm going to do this.'... I think I found it more difficult." [...] Towelhead was critically and financially unsuccessful.|$|E
500|$|Shane Satterfield from GameTrailers {{praised the}} more {{user-friendly}} and action-packed {{nature of the}} game compared to Metroid Prime and Echoes. Satterfield also praised the superior motion-sensitive controls, stating, [...] "After playing Metroid Prime 3 you'll never <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> shooter with dual analog controls again, it's that good." [...] He further added that those elements make Corruption [...] "far superior to the original Metroid Prime". 1UP.com was enthusiastic about the new control system and said the graphics were [...] "some of the best visuals in gaming, period". Electronic Gaming Monthly gave Corruption a Silver award and ranked the title as Game of the Month in a three-way tie with FIFA 08 and [...] GameSpot stated the game had enjoyable puzzles, boss battles, atmospheric levels, and smooth gameplay. It also explained that the game {{was more like a}} traditional shooter video game than an adventure shooter, and stated that the motion activated actions were too unresponsive.|$|E
500|$|Muhney {{said in an}} {{interview}} that the plot point of seducing Rafe broadened Adam's horizons. He said, [...] "What it did was move a character who represents a person who lives in Genoa City and moved him outside of a box that you can neatly check off. 'He is straight, he is this, or he is that,' and the fact that some lines are blurred makes him more real. When they did that with this character, I loved the opportunity to play into a different realm which is usually not touched upon on television." [...] Muhney described the character as a [...] "puppeteer" [...] with [...] "survival instinct", but also someone with a conscience. In another interview, when asked what he likes about portraying Adam, Muhney stated: [...] "You <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> catalytic character. You know a troublemaker is good business. You know someone who doesn't swim with the fishes, who swims upstream in the other direction, is someone who is going to cause friction and turbulence in storyline with other characters. I have been told by many of my cast members that the role to play is Adam. They say, [...] "If I were to have a choice, the character I would want to play is your role, Adam." ...|$|E

500|$|Davies had {{suspected}} that Renwick {{would one day}} revive Jonathan Creek, explaining that Jonathan's fate had been left open, unlike Renwick's other famous character - One Foot In The Graves Victor Meldrew, {{who was killed in}} a hit and run in the show's last episode. When the production of [...] "The Grinning Man" [...] was announced in June 2008, Davies commented: [...] "For the last five years whenever I've passed a locked room I've thought there might be a mystery lurking behind it, so I'm very happy to return to Jonathan Creek and to have something to actually solve." [...] He stated that reprising the role after such a lengthy hiatus was initially strange, and that: [...] "I couldn't remember my lines on the first day. I'd sort of forgotten how precise you have to be when you work on a Jonathan Creek episode." [...] He praised co-star Sheridan Smith in comparison, describing how: [...] "Sheridan is extremely good at all that stuff, which works in a similar way to the script, in that she's a very bright, sharp character and Creek's a bit rusty and hasn't really been doing it for a while. So sure enough, on the first day, she knows all her lines and makes her mark. And I'm going, 'Hang on a minute, stop showing off'". Upon receiving the episode's script, Davies had gained a stone in weight since last playing Jonathan Creek, almost five years previously. Renwick suggested that they include Davies' weight gain in the plot, presenting the character as having [...] "gone to seed". Davies, however, did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> [...] "fat Creek", and lost weight before filming began, stating: [...] "it was my choice not to let him go too much". The actor discussed with Renwick how Jonathan may have developed in the intervening five years: [...] "We talked about whether he’d have changed, whether he’d have done any investigating in the meantime. He probably didn’t. He still does the same job and is locked in the same relationship with Klaus and feeling a bit put upon – that hasn’t changed at all... and he still lives in a windmill". In a change from the original, Cobstone Windmill was used for the exterior shots, replacing Shipley Windmill, which had been used for all other episodes. Davies grew his hair out again for the role, and wore his own duffel coat throughout the episode. The coat had become the character's trademark in the show's first series, with Davies explaining that: [...] "After we did the first series, I could never wear it off screen again, because people started doing the Danse Macabre [...] music everywhere I went. So it's just been in the wardrobe for 12 years." ...|$|E
2500|$|In December 2010, it was {{announced}} that India Longford (Beth Kingston) would be murdered in a [...] "dark" [...] new storyline. It {{was announced}} that actor, Jeff Rawle, had been cast in the role of India's murderer. Rawle was best known as playing Amos Diggory in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire in 2005. [...] Rawle was approached by Hollyoaks and met with series producer, Paul Marquess, who explained the storyline. Rawle found the storyline interesting and something which he would like to [...] "have a crack at". Rawle took on the role to highlight the dangers of online dating. Rawle said that the role is [...] "very interesting" [...] for him as he had not played a murderer in his career before. Rawle made his first appearance as Silas on 23 December 2010. Silas was credited as [...] "Mystery Man" [...] in his first episode to keep his identity hidden. He was revealed to be the father of Heidi Costello (Kim Tiddy). In 2011, Rawle revealed that he is delighted to be playing Silas, stating [...] "It's the best role to have. Judy Garland once said, 'If {{you have to be in}} a soap, make sure you don't play the worst part'. She was talking about her own life being a soap, but she's right." [...] Rawle opined that the role of Silas is the [...] "best part" [...] and said that other cast members are jealous as they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> villain. Silas made his final appearance on 4 November 2011.|$|E

Not a leaf stirred; and the boat, when we came up to it, offered convincing proof of long desertion. She was an eighteen-foot whaleboat of the ordinary type, equipped with oars and thole-pins. Two or three quarter-casks lay on the bilge amidships, one of which must have been broached, and now stank horribly; and these, upon examination, proved to bear the same New Zealand brand as the beef on board the wreck.|$|E
