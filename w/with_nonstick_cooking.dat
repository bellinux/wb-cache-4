30|$|Begley et al. [35] {{showed that}} <b>nonstick</b> <b>cooking</b> {{utensils}} contribute less to PFC exposure to food than coated papers or cardboard boxes. Residual amounts of PFOA {{in the range}} of a few micrograms per kilogram or nanograms per gram were all that could be detected in PTFE cooking utensils. Of the total amount of PFOA in a PTFE strip, 17 % (30 ng/dm 2) migrated into the food simulant heated to 175 °C for 2 h. In contrast, some paper and cardboard surface coatings contained large amounts of PFCs. For example, microwave popcorn bags were found to contain 3 to 4 mg/kg (11 μg/dm 2).|$|R
50|$|Lecithin {{can easily}} be {{extracted}} chemically using solvents such as hexane, ethanol, acetone, petroleum ether, benzene, etc., or extraction can be done mechanically. It is usually available from sources such as soybeans, eggs, milk, marine sources, rapeseed, cottonseed, and sunflower. It has low solubility in water, but is an excellent emulsifier. In aqueous solution, its phospholipids can form either liposomes, bilayer sheets, micelles, or lamellar structures, depending on hydration and temperature. This results in a type of surfactant that usually is classified as amphipathic. Lecithin is sold as a food additive and dietary supplement. In cooking, it is sometimes used as an emulsifier and to prevent sticking, for example in <b>nonstick</b> <b>cooking</b> spray.|$|R
50|$|A whisk is {{a cooking}} utensil {{which can be}} used to blend {{ingredients}} smooth or to incorporate air into a mixture, in a process known as whisking or whipping. Most whisks consist of a long, narrow handle with a series of wire loops joined at the end. The wires are usually metal, but some are plastic for use <b>with</b> <b>nonstick</b> cookware. Whisks are also made from bamboo.|$|R
30|$|Sinclair et al. [36] {{examined}} the emission of residual PFOA and FTOH from <b>nonstick</b> <b>cooking</b> utensils and microwave popcorn bags upon heating to normal cooking temperatures (179 °C to 233 °C surface temperature). Heating nonstick frying pans released 7 ng to 337 ng (0.11 to 5.03 ng/dm 2) PFOA {{in the gas}} phase. Furthermore, concentrations of 6 : 2 FTOH and 8 : 2 FTOH of < 0.15 to 2.04 ng/dm 2 and 0.42 to 6.25 ng/dm 2 were detected. Repeated use of some frying pans was observed {{to result in a}} reduction in PFOA concentrations emitted in the gas phase. However, {{this was not the case}} for all frying pans from all of the manufacturers tested. In addition, 5 to 34 ng PFOA and 223 ± 37 ng (6 : 2 FTOH) as well as 258 ± 36 ng (8 : 2 FTOH) per bag were detected in the emitted vapor from microwave popcorn bags [36].|$|R

40|$|What are inhalants? Inhalants are {{breathable}} chemical vapors or gases {{that produce}} psychoactive (mind-altering) effects when abused or misused. These include volatile organic solvents, fuel gases, nitrites, and anesthetic gases. They {{do not include}} inhaled medicinal drugs that are taken as prescribed. Once {{commonly referred to as}} “glue sniffing, ” inhalant abuse now includes a broad range of volatile solvents and gas products (e. g., model airplane glue, paint thinner, gasoline, and nail polish remover), aerosols (e. g., <b>nonstick</b> <b>cooking</b> spray and hair spray), anesthetics (e. g., nitrous oxide or “laughing gas ” and ether), and nitrites (e. g., amyl, butyl, and isobutyl nitrites, often marketed as “poppers ” or room odorizers). (Other powdered drugs, such as heroin, cocaine, and methamphetamine, can be inhaled but are not considered inhalants.) Although the chemicals involved and their effects vary, the route of administration is the common factor. What are the most common modes of administration? Inhalants are abused either by “sniffing ” through the nose or inhaling fumes through the open mouth (“huffing”) much like a smoker inhales cigarette smoke. Usually the open tube of glue, nail polish, or marker is placed close to the nose and the fumes are inhaled. People who abuse inhalants may also spray the substance into a plastic or paper bag and huff that way (“bagging”) or even place the bag over the entire head. Often a product will be poured or sprayed on a piece of cloth, a rag, a towel, or a shirt sleeve or into a soda can and inhaled in that manner. Another method is to paint the fingernails with a product such as correction fluid and inhale the substance from the nails. Sometimes an aerosol substance is sprayed directly into the mouth. Substances also can be placed into alternative containers (e. g., balloon filled with nitrous oxide) or heated and then inhaled (Synergies 2002). Who is likely to abuse inhalants? Contrary to popular perception, people who abuse inhalants are found throughout the population and no one group can be categorized as “inhalant abusers. ” In 2001, more than 18. 2 million Americans reported ever having used an inhalant, and 141, 000 were estimated to need treatment because they were dependent on or abused inhalants. According to the 2001 Nationa...|$|R

40|$|The {{motion of}} a liquid under the {{influence}} of surface tension is a phenomenon we experience every day when we take a shower, drink a cup of coffee, or turn on the windshield wipers. All of these realworld situations involve not only the motion of the liquid and surrounding air but also their interaction with adjacent hard surfaces. As we know from waxing our cars and <b>cooking</b> <b>with</b> <b>nonstick</b> cookware, the dynamics of a fluid coating a solid surface depend heavily on the surface chemistry. Many industrial processes, ranging from spin coating of microchips to de-icing of airplane wings, rely on the ability to control these interactions. An ongoing challenge is to explain the underlying physics of the motion of a contact line, a triple juncture of the solid/air, solid/liquid, and liquid/air interfaces. When the system is at rest, the three interfacial energies, determined by the energy per unit area γS (S =sa, sl, or la) on each surface, are in balance, and an equilibrium contact angle θ satisfying (1) γsa−γsl−γla cosθ = 0 results. (See Figure 1. A derivation appears in [13].) However, the dynamically evolving contact line requires much more subtle modeling involving the interaction among multiple-length scales; {{the reason for this is}} born in the underlying fluid dynamics. Andrea L. Bertozzi is associate professor of mathematics at Duke University. Her e-mail address is bertozzi@ math. duke. edu. The classical theory of fluids [1] tells us that when a viscous fluid meets a solid boundary, the correct model for the boundary is a “no-slip ” condition on the solid/liquid interface. 1 Mathematically this requires setting the fluid velocity to be zero on the solid boundary. While this makes sense for the Navier-Stokes equations (describing the motion of an incompressible fluid) in bounded domains, its relevance to the moving contact line problem is dubious. The problem is that a moving contact line coupled with a no-slip condition on the liquid/solid interface results in a multivalued velocity field. This means that the velocity field is not 1 See [15], pp. 676 – 680, for a comprehensive discussion of the history of the “no-slip ” boundary condition...|$|R
40|$|Current {{research}} {{on the effectiveness of}} silicone bakeware is extremely limited; trade journals, magazine articles and newspapers are the only available sources of information on this topic. This literature claims that silicone bakeware is <b>nonstick</b> <b>with</b> ease of product removal and cleaning and provides for even heat distribution. The purpose of this work is to evaluate these claims and to compare the quality of silicone-baked items to similar items baked in standard bake pans using visual, physical and sensory evaluation techniques. The results of this study determine that cake products baked in traditional metal bakeware showed better crust color and texture development and delivered a moister product. The silicone bakeware produced a cake with greater volume...|$|R
50|$|When Circulon was introduced, the nonstick {{system was}} so unique in {{extending}} {{the durability of}} nonstick cookware that it was granted a patent. The unique Circulon Hi-Low surface made the pans {{at least three times}} more abrasion-resistant than any other nonstick cookware on the market. Anolon followed in 1986 as the first hard-anodized <b>nonstick</b> <b>with</b> a smooth <b>cooking</b> surface (and heavier-gauge aluminum than Circulon). Unfortunately, Cheng did not patent the hard-anodized nonstick process, which allowed competitors to develop similar products. He still develops unique technologies and pans for Meyer, including Infinite Circulon's impact-bonded base and the Anolon Outdoor BBQ Pan, respectively. Cheng won the Humanitarian of the Year award from the Housewares Charity Foundation in 2002.|$|R
