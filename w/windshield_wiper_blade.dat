[...] Trico is today {{one of the leading}} manufacturers of windshield wiping systems, windshield wiper blades and refills globally, with wiper plants on five continents.|$|E
5000|$|The Trico Plant No. 1 was {{the first}} factory built by Trico, which {{went on to become}} a major {{manufacturer}} of windshield wipers. The company was founded by John R. Oishei, who in 1917 was the manager of the Teck Theater in Buffalo, when while driving in a heavy rain he struck a bicyclist with his car. [...] This inspired Oishei to team up with John Jepson to market the <b>windshield</b> <b>wiper</b> <b>blade</b> Jepson had invented. The business first rented manufacturing space in North Buffalo, but in 1919 the Pierce Arrow Motor Company contracted the manufacturer to supply manually operated wipers for its luxury cars, and in 1920 Cadillac, Packard, and Lincoln did the same. The growing business, now fully owned by Oishei, purchased and moved its operations to the former ice house of the Christian Weyand Brewery at 624 Ellicott Street, recently made vacant by Prohibition.|$|E

40|$|The {{motion of}} a <b>windshield</b> <b>wiper</b> <b>blade</b> is {{modelled}} by a mass-spring-damper system on a moving frictional surface. The system dynamics is time-varying, since three different regimes of motion, characterized by {{different degrees of}} freedom, are possible. Indeed the system, which schematizes a blade cross-section, can experience stick and slip motions when it is {{in contact with the}} glass surface, and free flight motion when it is detached. The contact between the system and the surface is governed by Stribeck's friction law and Poisson's impact law, which make the dynamics non-smooth. The model is numerically implemented in an event-driven code, and simulations are performed which reproduce the three basic classes of undesired oscillations observed in the motion of real windscreen wipers, i. e., squeal, reversal and chattering noises. Attention is focused on the causes of these vibrations, and remedies for reducing or avoiding them are proposed...|$|E

The predominant sources of aerodynamic noise are created from attached turbulent boundary layers (TBL) as well as separated flows. The current numerical effort will focus on geometry of a fence to crudely model a <b>windshield</b> <b>wiper</b> <b>blade</b> for a large jetliner. This will produce an unsteady separated flow field. The recent literature lacks some of the characteristics {{that would make it}} most useful to aircraft applications. The numerical simulations performed were validated with a backward facing step experiment at M = 0. 15. The backstep geometry was then altered one feature at a time until an angled fence system was produced. All simulations except the final were performed with conditions that matched the wind tunnel experiment. The final simulation was performed at cruise conditions at 35, 000 feet, with rough flight deck conditions provided by the Boeing Company. The Mach number of the incoming boundary layer flow is 0. 5. Results of mean velocity fields were in excellent agreement with experiments. Turbulence intensity as well as pressure quantities agreed. Spectra of pressure fluctuations followed trends of past experiments. Pressure fluctuation magnitudes were over predicted just as many other numerical investigations in literature concluded...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Existing {{approach}} to tribology of polymer materials {{does not take}} into account their composition and structure. This paper presents the original analysis of friction characteristics, enabling an insight from the material engineering point of view. Design/methodology/approach: Apart friction also dissipation energy spectra have been analyzed. For transformation of friction fluctuations from the force into the frequency domain the FFT methodology has been applied. Parameters for evaluation of friction and wear have been proposed. Results of bench tests have been verified by examinations of <b>wiper</b> <b>blades</b> under conditions simulating real exploitation, adapting a system of car window cleaning. Power consumption by a driving engine has been monitored. Findings: Various kinds of modifications, influencing composition and structure of polymer materials have been studied. Ageing and wear resistance have been found to be the most important from the point of view of working properties of blades. They influence the efficiency of water removal from a car window. Research limitations/implications: Different blade designs have to be checked working under various conditions. Practical implications: A correlation between tribological properties and structure of polymer materials has to be taken into account at the stage of their compounding and processing. The proposed method for testing car <b>windshield</b> <b>wiper</b> <b>blades</b> is more appropriate than standards used so far, enabling quantitative assessment of products. Originality/value: The paper helps to understand materials engineering aspects of tribology. It is of potential value for producers of polymer parts...|$|R
50|$|Saurer F007: Simultaneously {{with the}} Saurer F006 the Saurer F007 was {{introduced}} in 1980 as a Pinzgauer High-Mobility All-Terrain Vehicle with similar versions available to the public. The F007 uses the same chassis and the same drive unit as the F006, however, unlike the F006 {{it does not have}} the cab behind the engine, but instead the engine compartment is internally located (as with many vans). It is therefore called a cab. Unlike the F006 the F007 has three <b>windshield</b> <b>wiper</b> <b>blades</b> instead of two, four headlights instead of two, and the front parking lights and turn signals are housed in the same headlamp shell. The gasoline tank filler neck is on the left side immediately behind the driver's door, and not as in the F006 on the right side between the rear and the rear wheel. The vehicle has a fixed cab which is open to the rear. The cargo area, passenger space is covered with a plastic sheet, including two plastic windows on each side. Again, this was based on the concept of the cab-over model 260 F by Monteverdi. For Swiss Army procurement, starting from 1982, SUV's in addition to dedicated military vehicles were prepared for testing. Here, too, the Swiss Army examined and appreciated the high-road tested prototypes of the F007, but did not buy the vehicle. The existing Saurer F007's are now privately owned.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The <b>windshield</b> <b>wiper</b> {{consists}} of 4 parts: a blade, an arm, a linkage and a motor. The <b>wiper</b> <b>blade</b> makes {{contact with the}} windshield and {{is designed to be}} operated normally at an angle of 30 ~ 50 degrees to the front glass. If the contact pressure between the <b>wiper</b> <b>blade</b> and <b>windshield</b> surface is too high, noise and wear of the rubber will result. On the other hand, if the contact pressure is too low, the performance will do badly, since foreign substances such as dust and stains will not be removed well. The pressure and friction of the <b>wiper</b> <b>blade</b> has a great influence on its effectiveness in cleaning the front window. This is due to the contact of the rubber with the window. This paper presents the dynamic analysis method to estimate the performance of the flat type <b>blade</b> of the <b>wiper</b> system. The <b>blade</b> has a nonlinear characteristic since the rubber is an incompressible hyper-elastic and visco-elastic material. Thus, Structural dynamic analysis using a complex contact model for the blade is performed to find the characteristics of the blade. The flexible multi-body dynamic model is verified by the comparison between test and analysis result. Also, the optimization using the central composite design table is performed...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to {{investigate}} how the design of solar cells could be improved {{so that they could}} become a more reliable source of energy. The first design change considered was shape manipulation, in which a normal photovoltaic array would be changed from a flat panel to either a cylindrical, parabolic, or spherical light-capture device. The idea is to change the cell or panel so that as much light is absorbed as possible. The second idea explored was to use a home water heating system in conjunction with the solar cells in order to control temperature fluctuation within the solar array, thus optimizing efficiency. The use of <b>wiper</b> <b>blades,</b> similar to <b>windshield</b> <b>wiper</b> systems in cars, was proposed as our third idea in order to remove any snow or debris {{from the surface of the}} panels.
