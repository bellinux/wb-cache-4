40|$|Samples of some cereals (corn, barley, and <b>oats),</b> <b>whole</b> (W) or {{subjected}} to flaking (F), rolling (R) and extrusion (E) were collected from different horses feed industries. Feed samples were analyzed for their proximate composition and fibrous fractions by Van Soest procedure. The total starch content (TS) was determined directly by liquid chromatography (TS 1) and as sum of resistant and non-resistant starch using a specific enzymatic kit before the spectrophotometric reading (TS 2). In vitro organic matter digestibility (OMD) by pepsin-cellulase technique was also estimated. The content of resistant starch was low in the cereals (on average 2. 0 % of the total starch), except for the whole corn samples. TS 1 values were lower than TS 2, particularly at lower starch levels. The in vitro OMD values ranged from 66. 8 % (<b>whole</b> white <b>oats)</b> to 95. 7 % (flaked corn). The effects of the physical treatments on the in vitro OMD were variable among cereals. The in vitro OMD of flaked white oats was lower with respect to whole and rolled grain. In corn and barley samples the physical treatments did not change the in vitro OMD values. Using the step-wise multiple regression method for all the chemical parameters, in vitro OMD of the cereals could be predicted by ADF content (R- 2 = 0. 986; RSD= +/- 1. 2 %). Other parameters (CP, lipids, lignin and total starch) gave little improvement in predicting in vitro OMD when included in the model. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is {{the leading}} cause of death in China and worldwide. <b>Whole</b> grain <b>oats</b> can reduce risk of CVD by {{reducing}} total and LDL-cholesterol, major risk factors for CVD. While this association has been established in many populations, data from Asian populations is limited. Thus, this study investigated the impact of oat consumption on cholesterol levels in Chinese adults. Male and female data from this work were previously published separately in mandarin in two Chinese journals. The combined male and female data were reanalyzed and are presented here. Methods A randomized, controlled, parallel-arm study was conducted at Beijing Hospital, Beijing china. Subjects were adults (men and women) with mild to moderate hypercholesterolemia. The oat group (n= 85) consumed 100 grams of instant oat cereal versus the control group (n= 81) who consumed 100 grams of wheat flour-based noodles daily for 6 weeks. Laboratory and anthropometric measurements were conducted at baseline and at the end of the 6 -week intervention. Results Dietary fiber intake increased significantly in the oat group compared to the control group at the end of the 6 -week intervention. Total-, LDL-cholesterol and waist circumference decreased significantly in the oat group compared to the control. HDL-cholesterol decreased significantly in the control group versus the oat group. There were no significant changes in blood pressure, other anthropometric or laboratory measures between the two groups at the end of the intervention. Conclusions Instant oatmeal consumed daily for 6 weeks significantly increased fiber intake and decreased major risk factors for CVD in Chinese adults with hypercholesterolemia. Increased consumption of <b>whole</b> grains, including <b>oats,</b> should continue to be encouraged. </p...|$|R
40|$|<b>Whole</b> grain <b>oats</b> {{are widely}} {{regarded}} as conferring significant health benefits. Composite flour of whole grain oat flour, wheat flour, and tapioca starch in the ratio 1 : 1 : 0. 16 was formulated to make oat noodles {{with the addition of}} gluten at various levels. The influence of gluten on pasting and gelling properties of composite flour, and on cooking, textural, and sensory properties of salted oat noodles was evaluated. Addition of gluten decreased the paste viscosity, reduced hardness and springiness of gel, reduced cooking yield, cooking loss, and broken ratio during cooking, and increased the tensile strength and firmness of cooked noodles. Scanning electron microscopy showed that gluten tightened the network of protein in the noodles by forming oriented fibrils. Addition of gluten had little effect on the color of raw and cooked oat noodles, which were somewhat yellow. Sensory evaluation indicated that addition of gluten could enhance the overall acceptability of cooked oat noodles. This study may stimulate further interest in using functional whole grain cereal ingredients in developing healthy staple foods. © 2011 AACC International, Inc. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
