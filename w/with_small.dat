40|$|In 1977, Hoffman gave a {{characterization}} of graphs <b>with</b> <b>smallest</b> eigenvalue at least - 2. In this paper we generalize this result to graphs <b>with</b> <b>smaller</b> smallest eigenvalue. For the proof, {{we use the}} concept of Hoffman graphs, as introduced by Woo and Neumaier in 1995. Our result says that if a graph <b>with</b> <b>smallest</b> eigenvalue at least -t- 1 (where t is a positive integer) satisfies some local conditions, then it is highly structured. We apply our result to graphs which are cospectral with the Hamming graph H(3,q), the Johnson graph J(v, 3) and the 2 -clique extensions of grids, respectively. Comment: 26 page...|$|R

5|$|As Revenge was {{the nearest}} {{of the three}} pirate vessels to the Americans, Allen ordered Alligator boats lowered to run inshore and attack her. Some 40 men armed <b>with</b> <b>small</b> arms were put into the boats, with Allen {{personally}} taking command of the launch, Lieutenant Dale the cutter, and midshipman Henley the gig. Revenge was already underway {{by the time it}} was sighted and attempted to escape the Americans despite the lack of wind, using its sweeps. After the American boats had rowed about , the pirate schooner made an about-face and raised a red flag. Upon approaching the pirates, the American craft were fired on with both grape and round shot. The American boats returned fire <b>with</b> <b>small</b> arms and moved in to board the vessel. Rather than try to fight off the boarding attempt, the pirates abandoned Revenge while another schooner covered their escape. Alligator gig manned by Henley and four men was sent off to take Revenge as a prize.|$|E
