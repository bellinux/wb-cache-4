40|$|Caching {{data in a}} <b>wireless</b> mobile <b>computer</b> can {{significantly}} reduce the bandwidth requirement. However, due to battery power limitation, a <b>wireless</b> mobile <b>computer</b> may often be forced to operate in a doze or even totally disconnected mode. As a result, the mobile computer may miss some cache invalidation reports. In this paper, we present an energy-efficient cache invalidation method for a <b>wireless</b> mobile <b>computer.</b> The new cache invalidation scheme is called grouping with cold update-set retention (GCORE). Upon waking up, a mobile computer checks its cache validity with the server. To reduce the bandwidth requirement for validity-checking, data objects are partitioned into groups. However, instead of simply invalidating a group {{if any of the}} objects in the group has been updated, GCORE retains the cold update set of objects in a group if possible. We present an efficient implementation of GCORE and conduct simulations to evaluate its caching effectiveness. The results show that GCORE can subs [...] ...|$|R
