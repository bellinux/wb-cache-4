25|$|There {{was a time}} in my {{life when}} I wasn't popular and {{accepted}} by kids in school. I was made fun of with braces and kinky hair, and being from a multicultural family, etcetera... And it really hurts when you're that age, but later when you get something of your own or you get involved in activities like a sport, you begin to be accepted for <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> <b>and</b> your personality and who you are, instead of your clothes and how you look and the name designer brands you have on.|$|E
500|$|Gossard said [...] "No Way" [...] {{expresses the}} idea that people just need to live [...] "and quit trying to prove something." [...] According to Vedder, [...] "Given to Fly" [...] is about [...] "rising above anybody's {{comments}} about <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>and</b> still giving your love away," [...] "Do the Evolution" [...] is about [...] "someone who's drunk with technology, who thinks they're the controlling living being on this planet," [...] "MFC" [...] takes place in a car and is about [...] "getting the fuck out of a problem," [...] and [...] "In Hiding" [...] is about [...] "taking a fast from life." [...] Ament said that [...] "Pilate" [...] concerned a question he was asking himself, dealing with a recurring dream Ament had with being old sitting with his dog on the porch, while [...] "Low Light" [...] was the answer, and that it deals with [...] "a kind of gratefulness at finding that place of calm and peace at my center and getting a glimpse of the person I could choose to be." ...|$|E
500|$|Kyle Busch {{appeared}} in Victory Lane {{to celebrate his}} first victory of the season; the win earned him $198,550. He said, [...] "I don't {{know how many times}} I spun out and didn't spin out. Amazing race. It was fun to drive when I wasn't getting turned around", and, [...] "Stab and steer, stab and steer, That's <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> <b>And</b> some brakes. There are brakes involved, too. I thought I was clear... and I tried going down slowly, and Jimmie just must have been there a little bit, turned me sideways and got me on the apron—scared everybody half to death, including me." [...] Stewart, who finished second, said, [...] "I actually had fun racing at Daytona again, which I haven't had for a while. I don't know what the consensus is from everybody else, but I had more fun as a driver tonight than what we've had in the past." [...] Ambrose, who finished third in the race, explained, [...] "It's definitely a lot more fun, more entertaining for the fans, and more in control for the drivers." ...|$|E

"Never mind <b>what</b> <b>you</b> intended; we know <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>and</b> that's enough," [...] said Bickley as he {{snatched}} the packet from Bastin's hand {{and proceeded to}} undo it, adding, [...] "By heaven!

500|$|Ono studied piano {{from the}} age of 4 to 12 or 13. She {{attended}} kabuki performances with her mother, who was trained in shamisen, koto, otsuzumi, kotsuzumi, nagauta, and could read Japanese musical scores. At 14 Yoko took up vocal training in lieder-singing. At Sarah Lawrence, she studied poetry with Alastair Reid, English literature with Kathryn Mansell, and music composition with the Viennese-trained André Singer. Of this time Ono has said that her heroes were the twelve-tone composers Arnold Schoenberg and Alban Berg. She said, [...] "I was just fascinated with what they could do. I wrote some twelve-tone songs, then my music went into [...] area that my teacher felt was really a bit off track, and..... he said, 'Well, look, {{there are people who are}} doing things like <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>and</b> they're called avant-garde.'" [...] Singer introduced her to the work of Edgar Varèse, John Cage, and Henry Cowell. She left college and moved to New York in 1957, supporting herself through secretarial work and lessons in the traditional Japanese arts at the Japan Society.|$|E
500|$|Sawyer and Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim) {{were the}} least-liked {{characters}} by viewers {{during the first}} few episodes, because, according to Lindelof, [...] "they were just really obnoxious, bad guys". In later episodes, however, Sawyer and Jin changed to be more likable. Towards the beginning of [...] "Confidence Man", Sawyer is seen reading the novel Watership Down by Richard Adams (this is the book that caused Boone to think that Sawyer took Shannon's inhaler). The novel has numerous similarities to Lost, including [...] "letting go", and building a society. Furthermore, the protagonists of Watership Down are rabbits – a recurring motif in Lost. The episode ends with a montage of various characters performing different activities, featuring the song [...] "I Shall Not Walk Alone", written by Ben Harper and performed by The Blind Boys of Alabama. One lyric from the song is, [...] "I just reach for mother Mary"; Sawyer's mother's name is Mary, and, according to reviewer Therese Odell from the Houston Chronicle, the lyric may be alluding to this. Also, percussionist Ryan McKinnie of The Blind Boys of Alabama said of many members of the group's blindness, [...] "Our disability doesn’t have to be a handicap. It's not about what you can't do. It's about <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> <b>And</b> what we do is sing good gospel music." [...] This quotation is very similar to the oft-repeated quotation by many characters (especially Locke), [...] "Don't tell me what I can't do." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ed Ney at Minnesota had {{a strong}} belief that being at the {{scientific}} forefront meant doing new and difficult things that few others were doing and doing them better. [...] He also felt {{that to be the}} best at <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>and</b> the master of your future, you {{had to be able to}} learn how to create and advance all of the technology in your own house rather than collaborating too closely with outsiders. [...] Ed's eclectic interests led him in a natural progression from the Manhattan Project, to measurements of cosmic rays, to studies of the physics of balloon flight, to atmospheric and solar physics, to research on the solar corona and the zodiacal light, and finally into the world of astronomy.|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, please." [...] There {{was real}} alarm in her voice. [...] "I realize fully <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>did,</b> <b>and</b> I realize that partly, at least, {{you may have}} been urged by {{consideration}} for myself. Believe me, I am very grateful. I shall always be grateful." ...|$|R

"You haven't told me {{anything}} about your interview; <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> your good friend Stacy said," [...] said Mrs. Barker, dropping languidly into a chair.

2500|$|Following {{the release}} of Love <b>What</b> <b>You</b> <b>Do</b> <b>and</b> Look Out!, The Hackensaws {{departed}} from Nettwerk Records to release two independently produced six-song EPs, The Old Sound of Music, Vol. 1 and The Old Sound of Music, Vol. 2 [...] These two collections are [...] "recommended for anyone who feels that time, popularity and (maybe) Don Was has watered down Old Crow Medicine Show, The Hackensaw Boys bring the Appalachian string band roots with punk rock flowers hard and raw." [...] The albums resulted from recording sessions held at the Sound of Music studios in Richmond, Virginia. They were mastered by Grammy award winner Charlie Pilzer. As with Look Out! in 2007, all songs were engineered by Bryan Hoffa, archival audio restoration specialist at the Library of Congress. The titles, bestowed by Ferd Lionel Moyse IV were inspired {{by the fact that}} these were the last two recording projects {{to come out of the}} old Sound Of Music facility, which has recently moved to a new building in Richmond.|$|E
2500|$|In 2002, Kidman won {{critical}} {{praise for}} her portrayal of Virginia Woolf in Stephen Daldry's The Hours, which stars Meryl Streep and Julianne Moore. Kidman famously wore prosthetics that {{were applied to}} her nose making her almost unrecognisable playing the author during her time in 1920s England, and her bouts with depression and mental illness while trying to write her novel, Mrs. Dalloway. The film earned positive notices and several nominations, including for an Academy Award for Best Picture. The New York Times wrote that, [...] "Ms. Kidman, in a performance of astounding bravery, evokes the savage inner war waged by a brilliant mind against a system of faulty wiring that transmits a searing, crazy static into her brain". Kidman won numerous critics' awards, including her first BAFTA, third Golden Globe, and the Academy Award for Best Actress. As the first Australian actress to win an Academy Award, Kidman made a teary acceptance speech {{about the importance of}} art, even during times of war, saying, [...] "Why do you come to the Academy Awards when the world is in such turmoil? Because art is important. And because you believe in <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>and</b> you want to honour that, and it is a tradition that needs to be upheld." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "The major gave it {{you rather}} hotly, Dick," [...] Terence {{said to his}} friend, as they sauntered off {{together}} from the group.

I'll think of this {{possibility}} soberly, but I won't flirt, and then which ever way I decide I shall have nothing to reproach myself with." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{do not say}} it is so; but {{you will}} do well to {{consider}} whether it is so or not, and to regulate your behaviour accordingly. I think your manners to him encouraging.

6000|$|... "No more did I, Bill. You must mind <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>and</b> {{not touch}} {{any of those}} straps and wheels and things.

I advise you to beware, Mr. Slope, of <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>and</b> say. Clergymen have been unfrocked for less than what you have been guilty of." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A village I don't like," [...] said Euphemia: [...] "there {{is always}} so much gossip, and people {{know all about}} what you have, and <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> <b>And</b> yet {{it would be very}} lonely, and perhaps dangerous, for us to live off somewhere, all by ourselves. And there is another {{objection}} to a village. We don't want a house with a small yard and a garden at the back. We ought to have a dear little farm, with some fields for corn, and a cow, and a barn and things of that sort. All that would be lovely. I'll tell you what we want," [...] she cried, seized with a sudden inspiration; [...] "we ought {{to try to get the}} end-house of a village. Then our house could be near the neighbors, and our farm could stretch out a little way into the country beyond us. Let us fix our minds upon such a house and I believe we can get it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Refute these calumnies,' said Kate, 'and be more patient, so {{that you}} may give them no advantage. Tell us <b>what</b> <b>you</b> really <b>did,</b> <b>and</b> {{show that they are}} untrue.' ...|$|R
