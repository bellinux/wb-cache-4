500|$|Despite earning {{critical}} acclaim and a sizable fanbase, commercial success eluded the group. Early in their career, their 1993 EP Jenny Ondioline entered the UK Singles Chart, but financial issues prevented the band from printing enough records to satisfy demand. When Elektra Records was closed down by Warner Bros. Records in 2004, Stereolab was dropped {{along with many}} other artists, reportedly because of poor sales. Since then, Stereolab's self-owned label Duophonic has inked a worldwide distribution deal with independent label Too Pure. Through Duophonic the band both licenses their music and releases it directly (depending on geographic market). According to Tim Gane, [...] "...we license our recordings and just give them to people, then we don't have to ask for permission if we want to use it. <b>We</b> <b>just</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be in control of our own music." ...|$|E

There {{is a lot of}} pressure on us but we must be realistic about our chances. <b>We</b> <b>just</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do well." [...] Choden spent time in Germany and Bangladesh preparing for the games. On July 28 Choden competed in the qualification round of her event.

Choden scored 16 points less than Czech Kateřina Emmons who was the lowest scoring qualifier for the final and therefore her competition ended at the qualifying round.

500|$|Like Powderfinger's {{previous}} album Internationalist, Odyssey Number Five {{commented on}} social and political issues heavily, with the primary point of focus being Aboriginal affairs. The lyrics of [...] "Like a Dog" [...] attacked former Prime Minister of Australia John Howard's Liberal government for its treatment of Indigenous Australians, and for breaking the [...] "relaxed and comfortable" [...] promise he made in the Australian federal election, 1996. Lead singer Bernard Fanning related this to the band's other ethical stances—refusing to appear on Hey Hey it's Saturday, for its anti-gay commentary, or not allowing Powderfinger songs {{to be used in}} jingles, amongst others—stating, [...] "We're not here to set an example. <b>We</b> <b>just</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be happy with ourselves and not end up with a guilty conscience." [...] Fanning said that despite [...] "Like a Dog" [...] being about a political issue, it was not a political song, rather just Powderfinger [...] "voicing our opinions".

Of the performance, Geoff Boucher from the Los Angeles Times commented: [...] "the Pussycat Dolls' set climaxed with a powerful pyro display that left celebs in the first few rows feeling a bit roasted". MTV Buzzworthy described the performance as [...] "sexy" [...] and [...] "sultry". However, Tod Martens, in another review for the Los Angeles Times, criticized their performance. He commented: [...] " [...] onstage looking like they had escaped a taping for a sexed-up Jazzercise video." [...] He also wrote that Scherzinger never commanded the song except on [...] "the cut's final seconds when she turned her vocals up to a growl" [...] and noted JabbaWockeez's appearance as [...] "annoy".|$|E
