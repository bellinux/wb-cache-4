500|$|The male parishioner of Manchester, Vermont (in a diocese {{neighboring}} Robinson's) who had alleged the [...] "touching", {{was then}} {{reported to have}} said, during the investigating committee's telephone call with him, that the acts in question were two separate occasions of <b>what</b> <b>felt</b> to him like intentionally seductive arm-squeezing and back-stroking, although in a public setting. The man acknowledged that others might have regarded the two incidents as [...] "natural," [...] yet the incidents were disturbing to him nonetheless. The investigating committee's report also stated that man regretted having used the word [...] "harassment" [...] in his e-mail, and that man declined an invitation to bring formal charges. After a two-day investigation, neither allegation proved of merit. The House of Bishops voted for Robinson in the affirmative, with 62 in favor, 43 opposed, and 2 abstaining.|$|E
500|$|Starting on the {{electric}} piano, Charles played <b>what</b> <b>felt</b> right: {{a series of}} riffs, switching then to a regular piano for four choruses backed up by a unique Latin conga tumbao rhythm on drums. The song changed when Charles began singing simple, improvised unconnected verses ("Hey Mama don't you treat me wrong / Come and love your daddy all night long / All right now / Hey hey / All right"). Charles used gospel elements in a twelve-bar blues structure. Some of the first lines ("See the gal with the red dress on / She can do the Birdland all night long") are influenced by a boogie-woogie style that Ahmet Ertegun attributes to Clarence [...] "Pinetop" [...] Smith who used to call out to dancers {{on the dance floor}} instructing what to do through his lyrics. In the middle of the song, however, Charles indicated that the Raelettes should repeat what he was doing, and the song transformed into a call and response between Charles, the Raelettes, and the horn section in the orchestra as they called out to each other in ecstatic shouts and moans and blasts from the horns.|$|E

Campbell of TouchArcade appreciated the [...] variety of puzzles from [...] "twitch" [...] to [...] "slow and thoughtful" [...] to, her favorite, the [...] "cerebral" [...] puzzles that required specific tricks as well as the ability to skip puzzles. She also found the last level nigh impossible.

500|$|In June 2014, the IMAX Corporation {{announced}} that the IMAX release of the film would be converted to IMAX 3D. Following the completion of principal photography several more cast members were revealed including Stellan Skarsgård, Anthony Mackie, Idris Elba, and Tom Hiddleston, reprising their roles from previous MCU films. However, Hiddleston's scenes {{did not make the}} theatrical cut of the film, with Whedon saying what was shot [...] "didn't play" [...] and he did not want the film to feel [...] "overstuffed". According to Hiddleston, [...] "In test screenings, audiences had overemphasized Loki's role, so they thought that because I was in it, I was controlling Ultron, and it was actually imbalancing people's expectations." [...] Whedon later explained that Elba and Atwell appear in the film because of exploring the psyches of the Avengers from Scarlet Witch's power. In December 2014, Kim's role was revealed as Dr. Helen Cho. Additional scenes were scheduled to be filmed in January 2015 at Pinewood Studios. In February 2015, Marvel confirmed through promotional material that Serkis portrays Ulysses Klaue in the film. In early April 2015, Linda Cardellini and Julie Delpy were confirmed {{to be part of the}} film's cast. At the same time, Whedon stated that the film would not contain a post-credits scene, which had become customary for MCU films. Whedon tried to come up with a post-credit scene but felt that he could not top the [...] "Shawarma scene" [...] in The Avengers, explaining, [...] "It didn't seem to lend itself in the same way, and we wanted to be true to <b>what</b> <b>felt</b> right.

500|$|At the 2005 World Music Awards, Carey {{performed}} [...] "Shake It Off" [...] alongside Dupri. Wearing black {{shorts and}} a pink blouse, the performance started as Carey got out of a Lamborghini Murciélago on stage, a re-enactment of the video. Additionally, a large lighted 'MIMI' sign was placed behind the stage, also a prop used {{at the end of}} the song's music video. The following week, Carey performed the song, as well as its accompanying number [...] "Get Your Number," [...] on the British music chart program, Top of the Pops. On November15,2005, the Chicago Tribune announced that Carey would perform during half-time of the Thanksgiving game between the Detroit Lions and the Atlanta Falcons. Airing on the 24th, Carey performed [...] "Shake It Off", as well as her newly released single from the album's re-release, [...] "Don't Forget About Us". Two months later, she celebrated the new year on television, placing as the featured performer at the Times Square Ball drop on New Year's Eve in New York. The special, titled Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve with Ryan Seacrest, aired on ABC at 10pm on December31, and featured Carey on stage wearing a short sparkling dress, and performing a selection of the album's singles, including [...] "Shake It Off". Aside from performing the song live on several high-profile televised events, Carey included the song on both her Adventures of Mimi and Angels Advocate Tours. On the former tour, the performance began as a large Broadway-styled prop reading 'MIMI', similar to the one from the video, descended from the rafters. As the song began, Carey walked down a spiraled staircase, ushered by one of her several back up dancers. Sporting a black bikini and matching sheer cape, Carey sang the song while, according to some critics, performing some of her most diverse physical movements from the entire show. On her Angels Advocate Tour, Carey performed the song during the first quarter of the concert. According to Ryan J. Downey of MTV News, Carey gave a [...] "rousing rendition" [...] of the song, and [...] "set the tone for <b>what</b> <b>felt</b> like a celebratory evening." ...|$|E
500|$|The main {{recording}} {{sessions for}} Closing Time {{took place at}} Sunset Sound Recorders in Hollywood, California—where Buffalo Springfield, Joni Mitchell, Neil Young and The Doors had previously recorded—during spring 1972. Yester fronted production and the sessions were held almost immediately after Waits' record deal, and were described [...] "quick and efficient." [...] Waits was [...] "nervous, but confident enough in his own material" [...] during {{the beginning of the}} sessions; however, as the sessions progressed, Waits and Yester [...] "were pulling against each other" [...] over the direction which the album would take, with Waits wanting a jazz-laden record and Yester more focused on producing a folk-based album. Despite this, Waits was [...] "absolutely communicative" [...] with his fellow musicians, articulating his direction and using metaphors to describe how he wanted the songs to sound. The sessions took a total of ten days, with the first two days focusing on [...] "getting used to [...]" [...] Both Waits and Yester wanted to record during the evening, but as no slots were available, it was recorded through the morning and afternoon [...] "from ten to five every day." [...] During the recording of [...] "Ol' '55", Seiter contributed backing vocals and [...] "came up with a perfect harmony line that started faintly before the chorus even began." [...] The sessions concluded with a total of nine songs completed. Though unsatisfied with the amount of songs, a second recording session was arranged the following week in United Western Recorders. The final session for Closing Time began the following Sunday, with guest musicians Arni Egilsson replacing Plummer and Jesse Erlich performing cello. The title track, [...] "Closing Time", was the only song recorded in full, and Yester later described the session as [...] "the most magical session I've ever been involved with. At the end of it, no one spoke for <b>what</b> <b>felt</b> like five minutes, either in the booth or out in the room. No one budged. Nobody wanted the moment to end." [...] String overdubs were later cut for [...] "Martha" [...] and [...] "Grapefruit Moon" [...] the following day.

2500|$|After {{promoting}} Watermark, Enya purchased new {{recording equipment}} and started {{work on her}} next album, Shepherd Moons.

Is it as good?" [...] Eventually I had to forget about this and start on a blank canvas and just really go with <b>what</b> <b>felt</b> right." [...] Enya wrote songs based on several ideas, including entries from her diary, The Blitz in London, and her grandparents. Shepherd Moons was released in November 1991, her first album released under Warner-led Reprise Records in the United States. It became a greater commercial success than Watermark, reaching number one at home for one week and number 17 in the United States. [...] "Caribbean Blue", its lead single, charted at number thirteen in the United Kingdom. By 1997, the album had reached multi-platinum certification for selling in excess of 1.2million copies in the United Kingdom and 5 million in the United States.|$|E

2500|$|In 2003, the National Library of Australia {{published}} an expanded edition of Wright's collection titled Birds. Most of these poems {{were written in}} the 1950s when she was living on Tamborine Mountain in southeast Queensland. Meredith McKinney, Wright's daughter, writes that they were written at [...] "a precious and dearly-won time of warmth and bounty to counterbalance at last <b>what</b> <b>felt,</b> in contrast, the chilly dearth and difficulty of her earlier years". McKinney {{goes on to say}} that [...] "many of these poems have a newly relaxed, almost conversational tone and rhythm, an often humorous ease and an intimacy of voice that surely reflects the new intimacies and joys of her life". Despite the joy reflected in the poems, however, they also acknowledge [...] "the experiences of cruelty, pain and death that are inseparable from the lives of birds as of humans ... and [...] a sorrowing a clear-sighted gaze on the terrible damage we have done and continue to do to our world, even as we love it".|$|E
2500|$|Britvic, who had {{acquired}} the Tango brand in 1988, {{were looking to}} radicalize Tango's image and advertising. They hired London-based advertising agency Howell Henry Chaldecott Lury and Partners (HHCL) to create a brand new television advertisement for the brand, which would {{form the basis of}} a new advertising campaign. HHCL, who had been operating since 1987, had earned a reputation in the business for breaking several norms in advertising and established a avant-garde theme in 1989, when, in launching the direct banking service, First Direct, aired two advertisements simultaneously on ITV and Channel 4, interrupting an Audi advert, one offering an optimistic and the other a pessimistic view, and a number of short, surreal spots in which the visual had little or {{nothing to do with the}} message. Orange Man was created by HHCL, using their staff Trevor Robinson OBE as art director, Al Young as copywriter, John Leach as planner, Axle Chaldecott and Steve Henry as creative directors and Matt Forrest as director. Production company Limelight also worked on the project. Robinson and Young were creative partners, and were [...] "pretty anti-advertising in [...] mindsets" [...] at the time because of their boredom and frustration with the industry norm of [...] "cause and effect advertising", and were desperate to make a name for themselves after [...] "spending <b>what</b> <b>felt</b> like eons trying to get into a West End agency." ...|$|E
2500|$|Filming {{began at}} the Cinecittà studio in Rome again in mid-May 1966, {{including}} the opening scene between Eastwood and Wallach when Blondie captures Tuco {{for the first time}} and sends him to jail. The production then moved on to Spain's plateau region near Burgos in the north, which doubled for the southwestern United States, and again shot the western scenes in Almería in the south. This time, the production required more elaborate sets, including a town under cannon fire, an extensive prison camp and an American Civil War battlefield; and for the climax, several hundred Spanish soldiers were employed to build a cemetery with several thousand grave stones to resemble an ancient Roman circus. For the scene where the bridge was blown up, it had to be filmed twice as in the first take all three cameras were destroyed by the explosion. Eastwood remembers, [...] "They would care if you were doing a story about Spaniards and about Spain. Then they'd scrutinize you very tough, but the fact that you're doing a western that's supposed to be laid in southwest America or Mexico, they couldn't care less what your story or subject is." [...] Top Italian cinematographer Tonino Delli Colli was brought in to shoot the film and was prompted by Leone to pay more attention to light than in the previous two films; Ennio Morricone composed the score once again. Leone was instrumental in asking Morricone to compose a track for the final Mexican stand-off scene in the cemetery, asking him to compose <b>what</b> <b>felt</b> like [...] "the corpses were laughing from inside their tombs", and asked Delli Colli to create a hypnotic whirling effect interspersed with dramatic extreme close ups, to give the audience the impression of a visual ballet. Filming concluded in July 1966.|$|E
