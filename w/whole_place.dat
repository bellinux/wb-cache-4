[...] By October 2007 {{all that was left}} was [...] "an empty lot dotted with weeds and crushed bricks".

In 1941 he resigned from the Curtis Institute in protest against the dismissal of the director Randall Thompson, and the following year the Wilsons returned to England.

[...] In comparison, David was {{initially}} hostile to Amy's inclusion in his family. However, in one storyline his attitude towards her softens {{and results in}} Amy developing feelings for him. Wolfenden said David [...] "has {{a soft spot for}} Amy" [...] and flirted with her. Over time he began to see her as his [...] "little sister." [...] When David's girlfriend, Leyla Harding (Roxy Shahidi) accuses Amy of stealing from the shop, David proves her innocence by exposing Alicia Gallagher (Natalie Anderson) as the thief. Wolfenden added that David has given out the wrong signals and acted naive during the story arc. Wolfenden explained that Amy misreads the signs because [...] "she never had that sort of affection when she was growing up." [...] Amy kisses David which shocks him, though Wolfenden felt it should not surprise him. Amy lies to her best friend Victoria Sugden (Isabel Hodgins), claiming she has slept with him and runs away from home.|$|E

500|$|Talbot is Marlowe's {{right-hand}} {{man and the}} secondary antagonist of Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception. He is voiced by Robin Atkin Downes. He {{is the one who}} hired Charlie Cutter to provide security for the deal in the first level. He has an intense rivalry with Nathan Drake and, according to the developers, acts as the [...] "anti-Drake", with similar looks and free running skills to rival Drake's own. Talbot is always by Marlowe's side, and later orders Cutter to shoot Nate and Sully. Despite his unassuming appearance, he is an extremely dangerous hand-to-hand combatant, able to use a combat knife with high proficiency as seen in his final confrontation with Drake and Sully in the collapsing city of Ubar. He also has a special weapon: a dart gun loaded with a special drug which grants him some hypnotic influence over people (he uses it to make Cutter disarm himself). Despite being treated with near indifference, he appears to care deeply for Marlowe, begging Nathan to save her from being consumed by the quicksand in Ubar, and is driven mad when Drake fails. He tries to murder Drake on top of a collapsing cliff overlooking the Iram of the pillars but is briefly distracted by Sully who shoots him in the shoulder with a Walther P99. He is then finally killed by Drake who puts several bullets into him before he can flatten Sully's skull with a rock, and plummets to his death. He is an expert at mind control and seems capable of appearing and disappearing almost at will and surviving being shot at point blank. However, due to his mind tricks, it is difficult to tell for sure if he can appear out of nowhere or disappear at will and sustain much bullet damage. After brainwashing Cutter, he manages to vanish before {{the rest of the team}} arrive. Cutter shoots him at point blank, but he does not appear to suffer much from it. He manages to attack Sully by surprise on a walkway with no place to sneak behind him. He manages to catch up with Drake and Sully when the <b>whole</b> <b>place</b> collapses - which is either possible thanks to his free running abilities or his unexplained ability to appear and disappear almost at will.|$|E

2500|$|Gorgona was a {{group of}} artists active in Zagreb between 1959 and 1966, that {{advocated}} non-conventional forms of visual art expression. It included the painters Josip Vaništa, Julije Knifer, [...] Marijan Jevšovar, Đuro Seder, sculptor Ivan Kožarić, art theoreticians and critics Radoslav Putar, Matko Meštrović, Dimitrije Bašičević (Mangelos), and architect Miljenko Horvat. Individually they were significant representatives of their own artistic fields, and together they had a major impact on the direction of contemporary art in Croatia. Besides working in more traditional techniques, they pioneered radical forms of artistic expression related to existentialism, neo-dadaism and proto-conceptualism. Their anti-magazine Gorgona (11 issues published 1961-1966) was simply designed, each edition intended to showcase the work and views of a single artist and was in itself a printed work of art. The group was preoccupied by the absurd, sent people invitations [...] for events that never took place, placed ads for the sale of trivial objects, planned unfeasible projects, and {{even went so far as}} to exclude the audience to have the <b>whole</b> <b>place</b> for themselves. The Gorgona publication, and the group's activities raised interest in international art circles - and they had frequent contact with such artists as Dieter Roth, Victor Vasarely, Piero Manzoni, Lucio Fontana and Robert Rauschenberg.|$|E
