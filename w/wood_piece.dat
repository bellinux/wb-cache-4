50|$|One of {{the main}} controversies {{surrounding}} the GKCC is the dated piece of wood. Dr. D.P.

The NGRI in Hyderabad returned a date of 7190 BC and the BSIP in Hannover returned a date of 7545-7490 BC. Some archeologists, Agrawal in particular, contest that the discovery of an ancient piece of wood does not imply the discovery of an ancient civilization.

In the present article, a precise experimental methodology has been developed to measure the concentration profiles of cations as a function of <b>wood</b> <b>piece</b> dimensions, impregnation time, temperature,and wood structure. The cation concentration can be measured at any position in the impregnated <b>wood</b> <b>piece.</b> The impregnation of Norway spruce wood samples with LiCl was investigated. The impregnated wood pieces were cut mechanically into cubes, which were cut in slices by means of a microtome, and the eluate of the 0. 4 -mm-thick slices in HNO 3 was analyzed by flame atomic emission spectroscopy.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Natural Resources: Watershed Management, 2011 Whole tree {{materials}} that include trees with attached rootwads, logs, and branches {{are recognized as}} important components of streams flowing through coastal redwood forests of Northern California. As {{the understanding of the}} importance of large wood materials has emerged, they have been recognized as key physical elements missing from many streams due to the historic and systematic removal associated with timber harvest and stream cleaning practices. The recognition of the ecological importance of wood materials within stream and floodplain ecosystems has led scientists and managers to advocate for the re-introduction of large wood directly into these environments. However, common applications of instream wood restoration can fall short of producing features capable of inducing the physical changes necessary to achieve desired restoration objectives, such as the formation of deep pools and cover. Current research shows that natural wood jams, with increased <b>wood</b> <b>piece</b> counts and volumes, are more effective at producing the hydraulic and geomorphic conditions necessary for creating and sustaining complex habitat. This study hypothesized that wood jams constructed with whole tree materials, increased <b>wood</b> <b>piece</b> counts, and greater wood volumes would be more effective than simple structures at creating the hydraulic conditions necessary for increasing instream complexity, geomorphic function, and aquatic habitat quality. Results were based on an evaluation of changes to surface sediment textures and channel morphology at ten constructed wood features built with varying complexity and wood volumes. Eight of these features were complex wood jams constructed with whole tree materials including large diameter trees with attached rootwad, logs, and branches. Each complex jam was individually designed to interact with seasonal variations in stream flow, floodplain morphology, and the dominant sediment transport regime. Two of the studied features were ???simple structures??? constructed in 1995 and comprised of one or two logs anchored to imported boulders with cable. The simple structures were designed following a standard California restoration protocol. Results indicate that complex wood jams were more effective than simple fish habitat structures in achieving common restoration objectives that include: (1) increasing percentage pool cover; (2) increasing scour pool habitat; (3) metering and sorting salmon spawning gravels; and (4) improving habitat heterogeneity. In addition, the effectiveness of an individual constructed jam improved as the overall <b>wood</b> <b>piece</b> count and volume within the jam increased. The increase in pool depths demonstrate that complex wood jams were effective at improving over summering and overwintering pool habitats for steelhead trout, coho salmon, and Chinook salmon...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{dynamics}} that move wood through {{and out of}} watersheds are complex and not yet fully understood. In this study, climatic conditions, hydrologic responses, and watershed processes were explored to better understand variations in wood export using aerial imagery, event-based video monitoring, and field measurements from the 1097 km² mountainous Mediterranean climate North Yuba River, California, watershed and its reservoir near the downstream outlet. Over a 30 -year study period, 1985 – 2014, volumetric estimates of annual wood export into the reservoir, available for a subset of years, were used to investigate watershed-scale, wood export dynamics. Variations in annual peak discharge explained 79 % {{of the variance in}} interannual wood export, with 84 % of total observed wood export (ca. > 10, 000 m³ of wood per event) delivered by years with discharge events of 19 -year, 21. 5 -year, and 60 -year flood recurrence intervals. Continuous video monitoring conducted during snowmelt season periods in 2010 and 2011 yielded wood discharge observations at minima 15 % of statistical bankfull flow, while maximum daily discharge explained 55 % of observed daily <b>wood</b> <b>piece</b> variation. No statistically significant wood discharge differences were found in snowmelt season observations, likely caused by domination of the hydrograph by diurnal pulses within the seasonal cycle. <b>Wood</b> <b>piece</b> sizes in upstream watershed locations were found to be significantly longer but not significantly larger in diameter than those observed in transport or measured in the reservoir, an indication that more downstream fining of length than diameter may occur during transport.

40|$|A flume {{experiment}} {{is carried out}} to explore jamming of Large Woody Debris (LWD) in streams with complex morphology, occurring in mountain streams with in channel boulders or vegetation, in braided rivers or in floodplains during flood events. Non rooted, defoliated LWD is modeled using wood dowels and obstacles to motion are represented by vertical wood rods. Congested transport of LWD is simulated by insertion of a number (100) of dowels. The final position of the dowels is mapped and the observed jams are classified according to their size and position. The key member of each jam is identified and its trapping mechanism evaluated, either by leaning against a single obstacle or by bridging two obstacles. To mimic uncongested transport, the {{experiment is}} repeated for single <b>pieces</b> of <b>wood,</b> with subsequent removal. Longer dowels and shallower water result in shorter traveled distance. <b>Wood</b> <b>pieces</b> travel farther when congested transport is observed. The traveled distance of the <b>wood</b> <b>pieces</b> can be modeled using a Gamma distribution, for both congested and uncongested transport. Jams instead display Uniform traveled distance.
