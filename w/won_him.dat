His {{performance}} as an obsessive one-sided lover {{in the film}} <b>won</b> <b>him</b> the Best Male Debut Award and earned a Best Actor nomination at the 59th Filmfare Awards. The same year he {{was seen in the}} survival film Maryan, which <b>won</b> <b>him</b> Best Actor Award (Critics) at the 61st Filmfare Awards South. In 2014, he produced and starred in cinematographer Velraj's directorial debut, Velaiilla Pattadhari, which was critically acclaimed as well as a box-office success.

5|$|During the season, Woodfull's {{physical}} courage, stoic {{and dignified}} leadership <b>won</b> <b>him</b> many admirers. He refused to employ retaliatory tactics {{and did not}} publicly complain even though {{he and his men}} were repeatedly hit— according to Ken Piesse, 34 times in all.

5|$|Hitler made a {{prominent}} {{appearance at the}} trial of two Reichswehr officers, Lieutenants Richard Scheringer and Hans Ludin, in late 1930. Both were charged with membership in the NSDAP, at that time illegal for Reichswehr personnel. The prosecution argued that the NSDAP was an extremist party, prompting defence lawyer Hans Frank to call on Hitler to testify. On 25 September 1930, Hitler testified that his party would pursue political power solely through democratic elections, which <b>won</b> <b>him</b> many supporters in the officer corps.|$|E
5|$|Mani Ratnam {{made his}} directorial debut, without formal {{training}} or education in filmmaking, with the Kannada film Pallavi Anu Pallavi (1983).

5|$|The {{death of}} U.S. Representative John Clopton in September 1816 created a vacancy in Virginia's 23rd congressional district. Tyler sought the seat, as did {{his friend and}} {{political}} ally Andrew Stevenson. Since {{the two men were}} politically alike, the race was for the most part a popularity contest. Tyler's political connections and campaigning skills narrowly <b>won</b> <b>him</b> the election. He was sworn into the Fourteenth Congress on December 17, 1816, to serve as a Democratic-Republican, the major political party in the Era of Good Feelings.|$|E

5|$|Because of Southern Rhodesia's {{small size}} {{and lack of}} major controversies, its unicameral {{parliament}} then sat only twice a year, for about three months in total, holding discussions in the afternoons {{either side of a}} half-hour break for tea on the lawn. Smith's early parliamentary commitments in Salisbury therefore did not detract greatly from his ranching. His maiden speech to the Legislative Assembly, in November 1948, concerned the Union of South Africa Trade Agreement Bill, then at its second reading. He was slow to make an impact in parliament—most of his early contributions related to farming and mining—but his exertions within the party <b>won</b> <b>him</b> Stockil's respect and confidence. Janet ran Gwenoro during Smith's absences, and gave birth to his only biological child, Alec, in Gwelo on 20 May 1949.|$|E

He was first capped for Scotland in 1900 in a match against Wales at St Helen's, Swansea. The match {{was a turning point}} for Welsh rugby, who won 12–3, but the selectors stuck with Bedell-Sivright who won another 21 caps for his country. He is the only Scottish player to have won three Triple Crownswins over Ireland, Wales and England within the same Home Nations Championship (now the Six Nations)in 1901, 1903 and 1907.|$|E

5|$|Benchley {{returned}} to the cinema in 1937, cast in the revue Broadway Melody of 1938, and in his largest role to that point, the critically panned Live, Love and Learn. A short that Benchley completed for MGM, A Night at the Movies, was Benchley's greatest success since How to Sleep, and <b>won</b> <b>him</b> a contract for more short films that would be produced in New York. These films were produced more quickly than his previous efforts (while How to Sleep needed two days, the later short How to Vote needed less than twelve hours), and took their toll on Benchley. He still completed two shoots in one day (one of which was The Courtship of the Newt), but rested for a while following the 1937 schedule.|$|E
5|$|Born in Chester, Johnson {{began his}} career with Crewe Alexandra and Manchester United's academies. He had loan spells with Royal Antwerp, Coventry City and Crewe Alexandra, before he was {{released}} by Manchester United in 2006 and joined Bradford City, where he played 64league games in two seasons. He was released from Bradford in 2008, and after initially turning down a move to Chester City, {{he was given a}} trial at Crewe, which was unsuccessful, and instead he joined Chester where he spent six months before his contract was terminated to allow him to move to Austin Aztex. His form during two seasons in the United Soccer Leagues First Division <b>won</b> <b>him</b> a transfer to Portland Timbers {{at the end of the}} 2010 season.|$|E
5|$|Born in Farnworth {{and raised}} in Bolton, he played amateur {{football}} at Rossendale United, before he turned professional at Burnley on his 17th birthday.

League football was then suspended for seven full seasons due to the outbreak of war in Europe, during which time he scored 24 goals in 23 appearances for England whilst guesting for Everton {{and a number of}} other clubs. In November 1945, he moved to Chelsea for £14,000, and scored a club record 26 goals in 34 league games in the 1946–47 season.|$|E
