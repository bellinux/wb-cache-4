The ensuing turmoil intrigued Goldman, although she did not fully understand it at the time. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>read</b> Chernyshevsky's novel, What Is to Be Done? (1863), she found a role model in the protagonist Vera, who adopts a Nihilist philosophy and escapes her repressive family to live freely and organize a sewing cooperative.

5|$|Their {{relationship}} was further strained in 1946 when Fontaine made negative comments to an interviewer about deHavilland's new husband, Marcus Goodrich. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>read</b> her sister's remarks, deHavilland was deeply hurt {{and waited for}} an apology that was never offered. The following year after accepting her first Academy Award for To Each His Own, deHavilland was approached backstage by Fontaine, who extended her hand to congratulate her; deHavilland {{turned away from her}} sister. The two did not speak {{for the next five years}} after the incident. This may have caused an estrangement between Fontaine and her own daughters, who maintained a covert relationship with their aunt, deHavilland.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, H.D. {{traveled}} to Vienna to undergo analysis with Sigmund Freud. She {{had an interest}} in Freud's theories as far back as 1909, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>read</b> some of his works in the original German. H.D. was referred by Bryher's psychoanalyst due to her apparent paranoia about the rise of Adolf Hitler which indicated another world war, an idea that H.D. found intolerable. The Great War (World War I) had left her feeling shattered. She had lost her brother in action, while her husband suffered effects of combat experiences, and she believed that the onslaught of the war indirectly caused the death of her child with Aldington: she believed it was her shock at hearing the news about the RMS Lusitania that directly caused her child to be stillborn. Writing on the Wall, her memoir about this psychoanalysis, was written concurrently with Trilogy and published in 1944; in 1956 it was republished with Advent, a journal of the analysis, under the title Tribute to Freud.|$|E
5|$|The {{sex scenes}} were choreographed by feminist writer and sex {{educator}} Susie Bright. The Wachowskis were fans of Bright {{and sent her}} {{a copy of the}} script with a letter asking her to be an extra in the film. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>read</b> the script she loved it, particularly as it was about women enjoying having sex and not apologizing for it. Disappointed that they never described exactly {{what was happening in the}} sex scenes, she asked if she could be a sex consultant for the film and they agreed. The main sex scene set in Corky's apartment was filmed in one long shot. The Wachowskis believed that this would look more realistic than several shots edited together. Although it should have been a closed set, there were actually many people present, moving the walls of the set in order to allow full movement of the camera around the actors.|$|E

Many of the Latter Day Saints who joined the RLDS Church in the midwestern United States had broken with Brigham Young and/or James Strang because of opposition to polygamy. Emma's continuing public denial of the practice seemed to lend strength to their cause, and opposition to polygamy became a tenet of the RLDS Church. Over the years, many RLDS Church historians attempted to prove that the practice had originated with Brigham Young.|$|E

LeBlanc, to the author himself, who was one year younger than she. The first letter, dated 21 November 1804, discussed Gauss' Disquisitiones and presented some of Germain's work on Fermat's Last Theorem. In the letter, Germain claimed to have proved the theorem for n=p–1, where p is a prime number of the form p=8k+7. However, her proof contained a weak assumption, and Gauss' reply did not comment on Germain's proof.|$|E

Her reasoning was that the book “is full of sex and cursing”; she later expanded on her policy by saying “I asked the board members to please review all the books for any sexual content, violence, or foul language prior to any book becoming required reading.”.

500|$|Throughout her life, Emma Smith {{frequently}} {{denied that}} her husband had ever taken additional wives. Emma said that the very first time she ever became aware of a polygamy revelation being attributed to Smith by Mormons was <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>read</b> about it in Orson Pratt's periodical The Seer in 1853. Emma campaigned publicly against polygamy, and was the main signatory of a petition in 1842, with a thousand female signatures, denying that Smith was connected with polygamy. As president of the Ladies' Relief Society, Emma authorized publishing a certificate in the same year denouncing polygamy, and denying her husband as its creator or participant. Even on her deathbed, Emma denied Joseph's involvement with polygamy, stating, [...] "No such thing as polygamy, or spiritual wifery, was taught, publicly or privately, before my husband's death, that I have now, or ever had any knowledge of...

500|$|Åkerman {{played the}} lead role on the ABC sitcom Trophy Wife. Åkerman played Kate Harrison, the third wife of Pete Harrison (Bradley Whitford).

Matt Webb Mitovich of TVLine said she [...] "no less than shines here, coming off as fun-loving but not flaky, warm and not overheated". Gabriel Mizrahi of The Huffington Post called Åkerman [...] "terrific" [...] and Roth Cornet of IGN singled out her chemistry with co-star Bradley Whitford and her aptitude for physical comedy. Åkerman {{said that she was}} initially put off by the title, having previously expressed frustration at constantly being asked to play the [...] "trophy wife." [...] However, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>read</b> the script, she loved the writing and the character and how [...] "not trophy wife" [...] she is. In 2013, Åkerman was a presenter with Josh Stamberg (Drop Dead Divas) at Women's Image Network Awards.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Charles to make a funny [...] "dark-themed" [...] episode, using {{elements}} that were unusual in sitcoms. Sets for the episode were built, and Bobbi Jo Lathan was cast as flight attendant Lucy Merrit and Ernie Sabella was cast as gun salesman Mo Korn, who was described in the script as [...] "overweight, greasy, slow and low-key". The table reading of the episode was held on December 12, 1990. Louis-Dreyfus stated, [...] "I read the script and I remember thinking 'we're {{not going to do}} this'." [...] According to Alexander, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>read</b> a scene in which she holds the gun to her head stating [...] "where do you want it Jerry? The Kennedy? [...] The McKinley?" [...] (referencing the assassination of the two American presidents), Louis-Dreyfus turned to Alexander, stating [...] "I'm not doing this." [...] Both Alexander and Cherones, who would direct the episode, felt that the gun content in the story was too provocative.

500|$|However, {{during the}} {{read-through}} of the episode, it was negatively received by {{cast and crew}} members; both Alexander and director Tom Cherones felt the episode's gun content was too provocative. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>read</b> a scene that referenced the assassinations of John F. Kennedy and William McKinley, Louis-Dreyfus turned to Alexander and stated, [...] "I'm not gonna do this." [...] Though {{they did not want}} to, the cast started rehearsing. After twenty minutes they convinced Cherones to talk to Charles. On his way to Charles' office, Cherones bumped into NBC executive Glenn Padnick, with whom he talked to Charles, eventually agreeing not to film the episode. Commenting on the episode, Charles stated [...] "You know, it would have been an interesting show, but [...] we couldn't solve the funny problem of it. It never seemed to quite be as funny as it should be and, because of that, the balance was off and the darkness kind of enveloped it, and it could never really emerge from that darkness and become what it should have been. So, it was disappointing but also understandable." [...] Both Lathan and Sabella were given roles in later episodes; Lathan appeared as Patti in the season three episode [...] "The Stranded", while Sabella was cast as the [...] "greasy naked guy" [...] in [...] "The Subway", also for the show's third season.|$|E
500|$|Olga Kurylenko as Camille Montes, a Bolivian {{agent with}} her own vendetta {{regarding}} Greene and Medrano. Forster chose her because out of the 400 women who auditioned, she seemed the least nervous. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>read</b> the script, she was glad she had no love scene with Craig; she felt it would have distracted viewers from her performance. Kurylenko spent three weeks training to fight with weapons, and she learnt a form of indoor skydiving known as body flying. Kurylenko {{said she had to}} do [...] "training non-stop from the morning to the evening" [...] for the action scenes, overcoming her fears with the help of Craig and the stunt team. She was given a DVD box set of Bond films, since the franchise was not easily available to watch in her native Ukraine. Kurylenko found Michelle Yeoh in Tomorrow Never Dies inspiring [...] "because she did the fight scenes by herself." [...] The producers had intended to cast a South American actress in the role. Kurylenko trained with a dialect coach to perform with a Spanish accent. She said that the accent was easy for her because she has [...] "a lot of hispanic friends, from Latin America and Spain, and it's an accent I've always heard". When reflecting on her experience as a Bond girl, she stated she was proudest of overcoming her fears in performing stunts.|$|E
500|$|Across her {{speaking}} appearances, Lightning is {{voiced by}} Ali Hillis in English and Maaya Sakamoto in Japanese. Sakamoto {{was impressed by}} Lightning, whom she called [...] "cold" [...] and [...] "strong". She was asked to portray Lightning's strength and to betray the character's hidden vulnerabilities. She initially found it strange to voice Lightning, as {{she was used to}} gentler roles such as Aerith Gainsborough, a central character in Final Fantasy VII and its companion media. Commenting on the difficulty of balancing Lightning's depiction as a woman and a professionally trained warrior, Kitase noted that Sakamoto's acting helped to bring out Lightning's femininity. Hillis was given the role of Lightning after speaking a few of the character's lines during audition, and was then given a book about the Final Fantasy XIII universe, which she found a little [...] "overwhelming" [...] <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>read</b> it. One of the challenges Hillis faced was recapturing the emotion and energy of Sakamoto's Japanese performance in the character's English rendition. She tried to help the staff of the XIII games portray Lightning as a real person: [...] "I think that was my main priority, to make sure that Lightning had every single layer of who she was as a person, not just a game character, but a real person with layers and history and relationships to every single character in the game...even the Chocobo!" [...] Over the course of the XIII trilogy, Hillis felt that Lightning becomes [...] "a little more sarcastic ... a little more hardened to everything that's going on around her and ... into a real warrior".|$|E
