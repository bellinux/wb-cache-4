5|$|It {{was written}} in the L.A. sun on an {{afternoon}} with my friend David Poe. We <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> about how you sometimes know that you would be better at love if only you were older. But you can't rush old. You have to be young and dumb and let time do its thing before you get the experience you need to handle love right.|$|E
5|$|Rees {{writes that}} Gröning {{describes}} {{his time at}} Auschwitz as if he <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> about another Oskar Gröning at Auschwitz — and as a result, the post-war Gröning speaks more candidly about his time there by segregating the Gröning {{that contributed to the}} running of a death camp from the modern Gröning that condemns Nazi ideology.|$|E
5|$|A Naval Board of Inquiry was convened on July 21, 1944, to {{find out}} what had happened. The {{official}} proceeding lasted for 39 days and included interviews with witnesses who were officers, civilians and enlisted men. Ordnance experts were questioned as well as inspectors who had overseen previous loading procedures. Five African Americans were questioned, none of whom were later to refuse to load ammunition. Captain Kinne's posted division tonnage results came to light in the inquiry but Kinne stated that the competition to load the most tonnage did not make for unsafe conditions; he implied that any junior officers who said so did not know what they <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> about.|$|E

He <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> about education reform. He <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> about immigration reform. He <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> about issues that had typically been Democratic issues. He <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> about them in a really compassionate way." [...] McKinnon {{said that he was}} particularly [...] "impressed with how he'd gotten ahead of the Republican Party".|$|R

5|$|Globocnik and I <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> about Operation Reinhard, {{which was}} in full effect {{following}} Heydrich's murder, and also the construction of Sobibor and Treblinka. I know I asked him about Höss, who was also standing there and had been summoned by Himmler regarding logistics or something regarding the new camp (Auschwitz). Then Globocnik mentioned to me and Kaltenbrunner that Lidice had been cleared, and all the Jews and Czechs had been dealt with. I noticed that this young pilot, who I later learned was Marseille, must have overheard, and I debated whether I should go over and say something to him. I decided against it.|$|E
5|$|Most of India's early talkies {{were shot}} in Bombay, which remains the leading {{production}} center, but sound filmmaking soon {{spread across the}} multilingual nation. Within {{just a few weeks}} of Alam Aras March 1931 premiere, the Calcutta-based Madan Pictures had released both the Hindi Shirin Farhad and the Bengali Jamai Sasthi. The Hindustani Heer Ranjha was produced in Lahore, Punjab, the following year. In 1934, Sati Sulochana, the first Kannada talking picture to be released, was shot in Kolhapur, Maharashtra; Srinivasa Kalyanam became the first Tamil talkie actually shot in Tamil Nadu. Once the first talkie features appeared, the conversion to full sound production happened as rapidly in India {{as it did in the}} United States. Already by 1932, the majority of feature productions were in sound; two years later, 164 of the 172 Indian feature films <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> pictures. Since 1934, with the sole exception of 1952, India has been among the top three movie-producing countries in the world every single year.|$|E
5|$|Siglinda Scarpa {{says she}} had issues with {{communication}} as a child, stating that “people were not seeing me, that they <b>were</b> <b>talking,</b> but never to me.” It was not until her father brought a stray kitten home and placed it under her sheets that Scarpa felt she could communicate with someone. The kitten was a year old when he became very ill and died. After his death, Scarpa decided to take in as many cats as possible, with the hopes of eventually creating {{a safe haven for}} cats. Scarpa created the Goathouse Refuge in 2007, naming it after an old goat who came with the dilapidated plantation house and the 16 acre property. Originally, the land was just intended for her pottery studio. After the house and studio burned down Scarpa rebuilt it with plans that included a sanctuary for cats, using personal resources and proceeds from her pottery sales to make it possible.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} the episode come from a {{conversation}} between Jane O'Brien and Mike Scully, when the two <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> about how girls always want to grow up so fast, as Scully has five daughters; {{so they decided to}} produce an episode with a storyline based on this. The idea behind the episode plot came from Jace Richdale, {{who came up with the}} idea of Homer stealing grease and the grease business, having read about in a magazine. Several aspects of the characters used throughout the episode had been improvised significantly by Lisa Kudrow. Ron Hauge, a writer for The Simpsons, came up with the initial character of Alex, and Jane O'Brien named the character after her best friend. The scene showing Homer's hemorrhaged eye as Groundskeeper Willie strangles him got a big laugh in the studio. Mike Scully comments that he now uses it in college clip shows.|$|E
5|$|Allan Arkush and Kring {{revealed}} {{in an interview}} on The Post Show that many parts of the finale were re-shot due to the Writers' Strike. Kring and Arkush commented that they re-shot the scene in which Peter telekenetically caught the virus. In the original cut, the virus was to shatter and be released. Kring admitted that the virus being released was to play a huge role in Volume 3, however, they decided to go into a different direction and re-shoot the ending, allowing Peter to catch the virus and destroy it. Kring also commented that the scenes where Matt, Peter and Nathan <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> in the vault were rewritten in and added later, as well as the Press Conference scene and the scene with Angela Petrelli talking on the cell phone. Kring and Arkush stated that the ending had to be rewritten and re-shot because they did not know when the show would return to air, due to the Writer's Strike, and they {{wanted to make sure that}} they tied up all the loose ends.|$|E

As of version 1.4 the multiplayer still only supported small maps, which is not enough for 16 players.|$|E

60|$|Yet this {{universal}} language has not succeeded, {{at a moment}} of crisis, in imposing itself on the whole world. Nay, it has not, at the moment of crisis, succeeded in imposing itself on its own principal champions. Herve <b>is</b> not <b>talking</b> Economic Esperanto; he <b>is</b> <b>talking</b> French. Bebel <b>is</b> not <b>talking</b> Economic Esperanto; he <b>is</b> <b>talking</b> German. Blatchford <b>is</b> not <b>talking</b> Economic Esperanto; he <b>is</b> <b>talking</b> English, and jolly good English, too. I do not know whether French or Flemish was Vandervelde's nursery speech, but I am quite certain he will know more of it after this struggle than he knew before. In short, whether or no there be a new union of hearts, there has really and truly been a new division of tongues.|$|R

25|$|By 1990, FEA-United and FTP-NEA <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> merger. Despite 15 {{years of}} competition, neither union had {{achieved}} {{an overwhelming majority}} among the state's teachers. Worse, the problems confronting the state's schools had not improved much since the mid-1970s. With state politics trending more and more conservative, both unions felt merger would be advantageous. But continuing conflict between the two unions kept merger talks from progressing very far.|$|E
25|$|Both {{sailed to}} Margarita in August 1819. The Emily, a {{merchant}} ship under Captain Spilman, sailing with cargo to Alexandria, Virginia, found the brig Wilson. Almeida hailed the Emily and after {{making sure it}} was an American ship, let it go. When they <b>were</b> <b>talking,</b> a schooner with 23 guns stopped the Emily again: {{this time it was}} the Almeyda, and Captain Wilson came aboard. This time it was decided that the cargo of sugar, coffee, and leather was Spanish, so Wilson seized them.|$|E

25|$|Fernando de Alva Cortés Ixtlilxóchitl, a mestizo {{historian}} and descendant of Coanacoch, wrote {{an account of}} the executions in the 17th century partly based on Texcocan oral tradition. According to Ixtlilxóchitl, the three lords were joking cheerfully with one another because of a rumor that Cortés had decided to return the expedition to Mexico, when Cortés asked a spy to tell him what they <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> about. The spy reported honestly, but Cortés invented the plot himself. Cuauhtémoc, Coanacoch, and Tetlepanquetzal were hanged as well as eight others. However, Cortés cut down Coanacoch, the last to be hanged, after his brother began rallying his warriors. Coanacoch did not have long to enjoy his reprieve, as Ixtlilxóchitl wrote that he died a few days later.|$|E
25|$|During {{this time}} Bunyan, whilst on his travels as a tinker, {{happened}} to be in Bedford and pass a group of women who <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> about spiritual matters on their doorstep. The women were in fact some of the founding members of the Bedford Free Church or Meeting and Bunyan, who had been attending the parish church of Elstow, was so impressed by their talk that he joined their church. At that time the nonconformist group was meeting in St John's church in Bedford under the leadership of former Royalist army officer John Gifford. At the instigation of other members of the congregation Bunyan began to preach, both in the church and to groups of people in the surrounding countryside. In 1656, having by this time moved his family to St Cuthbert's Street in Bedford, he published his first book, Gospel Truths Opened, which was inspired by a dispute with Quakers.|$|E
25|$|During {{the late}} 1980s, Lynch {{had begun to}} work in {{television}} as well as cinema, directing a short piece titled The Cowboy and the Frenchman for French television in 1989. Around this time, he met the television producer Mark Frost, who had formerly worked on such projects as the television police series Hill Street Blues, {{and they decided to}} start working together on a biopic of singer and actress Marilyn Monroe based upon Anthony Summers's book, The Goddess: The Secret Lives of Marilyn Monroe. While this project never got off the ground, the duo went on to work on a comedy script named One Saliva Bubble, but that did not see completion either. While they <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> in a coffee shop, Lynch and Frost had the idea of a corpse washing up on the shore of a lake, and subsequently set about on their third project, initially called Northwest Passage but would eventually become the television series Twin Peaks (1990–1991).|$|E
