Coinciding with working at her general medical practise, she worked closely with Dr. Vera Scantlebury Brown who was introducing aspects of child welfare in Australia. Campbell and Brown knew each other previously from completing their Doctorates of Medicine (1924) at the University of Melbourne together. When Brown toured New Zealand to investigate the various infant care methods of Dr.Truby King, Campbell had assumed the training of infant welfare nurses which Brown had been responsible of. This was the initiation of Campbell's lifelong association with the Victorian Baby Health Centres Association, for which she was a medical officer for until 1965. Through the role of medical officer, the responsibilities were to visit centres throughout Victoria and act as examiner for the State Infant <b>Welfare</b> <b>Certificate.</b> Campbell and Brown {{wrote a book called}} A Guide to the Care of the Young Child (1947), which remained the standard reference textbook for sisters of infant welfare until 1972.|$|E
40|$|This {{document}} {{sets out}} to describe a curriculum evaluation project undertaken for the subject "Community Work" {{which is part of}} the <b>Welfare</b> <b>Certificate</b> Course, Hobart Technical College. 1983 was the first year "Community Work" was taught using a new, extended curriculum for the subject. As it was the first year of implementation, it seemed particularly appropriate and necessary to closely evaluate this new curriculum. Although much thought, research, time and effort had gone into the development of the new curriculum, it was clear to the designer that such development was not perfect and did not end with the last page of the curriculum document. Indeed, evaluation is understood to be an integral part of curriculum development. The word 'development' implies an ongoing advancement through stages of growth. These stages of growth are seen to be revealed and urged on by the process of evaluation. Logically, advancement and growth are linked to improvement. In order to identify which innovations bring improvement, the worth and value of the curriculum must be determined. Determining the worth and value of the curriculum is the basic goal of this evaluation project. Although evaluation may serve numerous roles, this basic, over-riding goal remains of prime importance,(Scriven, 1967, 39). The role curriculum evaluation has in any particular educational context varies greatly. The curriculum evaluation examined in this project takes on several roles to enable achievement of the basic goal. One role undertaken is the appraisal of the outcomes of student learning and understanding in all of their ramifications. This appraisal is not limited to the final outcomes or to meeting stated objectives but also the degree and level at which students are developing their understanding and learning. Another role of this evaluation exercise is in determining the value of the curriculum itself. An effort to determine this is made through asking certain types of questions about the curriculum such as: How well does it perform with regard to certain criteria such as the purposes for which it was designed? Are the purposes for which it was designed valid? How appropriate and effective are the processes, materials, and content in light of the purposes envisioned? Is the curriculum appropriate for the needs and capabilities of the specific group of students? Is the instructional approach used serving to best fulfill the needs and purposes of the curriculum...|$|E

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} analyze factors which {{influence}} or encourage the fishermen as {{the participants in}} land right certification program {{to be willing to}} secure their land certificate to obtain loans and to analyze the impact of land certification program for the fishermen to increase their income and welfare. The study was conducted in Indramayu as an area which has a fisherman land certification program. The data obtained in this study were analyzed by logistic regression and multiple linear regression. The logistic regression analysis was performed by using feasibility test model (goodness of fit) and Nagelkerke R Square Coefficient. Moreover, the multiple linear regression analysis was performed by using F Test and determination coefficient analysis (R²). The results showed that the fishermen status and educational background, land width, ownership of other assets and side business are included as factors that significantly influence the interest to use their land certificate obtained from "Fishermen Empowerment Program and Small-Scaled Fishery Businesses through the Certification of Land Right” as their collateral. The results were supported by highlighting that p-value for each variable is smaller than 0, 10 and the educational factor has a significant effect which is higher than 0, 009 compared to other factors. Having a higher education level encourages the fishermen to secure their land certificates in order to obtain capital in increasing their income and welfare.
