25|$|On the June 25, 2010, {{episode of}} SmackDown, Rodríguez {{appeared}} on a taped promotional video as the unmasked Alberto Del Rio. Thereafter, a vignette aired every week on SmackDown promoting his character as an arrogant rich Mexican aristocrat, espousing his own virtues of honesty, integrity and mental faculties. After two months, Del Rio wrestled his first match at a house show in Brisbane, Australia and a week later, he made his television debut on the August 20 episode of SmackDown by defeating Rey Mysterio in the main event by submission with the cross armbreaker. As part of his act, Del Rio made his entrances in an expensive car, while he was introduced by his personal ring announcer, Ricardo Rodriguez. The following week, Del Rio continued the storyline with Mysterio by attacking him after his match with Kane, giving him a storyline injury by refusing to relinquish his armbar. Two weeks later, he defeated Matt Hardy via submission in Hardy's last appearance with the company causing Hardy's friend Christian to challenge Del Rio to a match at Night of Champions. Despite declining the match, on the September 24 episode of SmackDown Del Rio attacked Christian and injured him the same <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> Mysterio the previous month. This was done to write Christian off television, as he had suffered a torn pectoral muscle. Mysterio returned on the October 8 episode of SmackDown, and handed Del Rio his first defeat in the main event match. In October, Del Rio defeated Chris Masters to represent the SmackDown brand at Bragging Rights, but during the pay-per-view event, he attacked teammate Rey Mysterio, before being eliminated from the match by Team Raw's CM Punk. At Survivor Series, in the traditional five-on-five elimination match, Del Rio captained a team against Rey Mysterio's team. Despite Del Rio's team losing, he {{was removed from the}} match after Big Show knocked him out with a WMD. On the November 26 episode of SmackDown, Del Rio defeated Big Show via countout to qualify for the 2010 King of the Ring tournament. In the tournament the next week on Raw, he made United States Champion Daniel Bryan submit in the first round, but was defeated by John Morrison in the semifinal after being distracted by Mysterio who was inside his car. At , Del Rio competed in a fatal four-way Tables, Ladders and Chairs match for the World Heavyweight Championship, which was won by Edge and also included Kane and Rey Mysterio. On the January 7, 2011 episode of SmackDown, Del Rio defeated Mysterio in a two-out-of-three-falls match, with help from Ricardo Rodriguez by holding Mysterio out of the ring to end his long feud with Mysterio.|$|E

[...] Alan Hansen also praised McAllister's performance: [...] "Gary McAllister was outstanding.

500|$|At {{the podium}} interviews, which were {{conducted}} by former Formula One driver Martin Brundle, Nico Rosberg expressed delight about his victory, but also remembered the events of Paris which, as he put it, rendered [...] "everything relative". Replying to Brundle's notion that driving the <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> {{earlier in the season}} would have given him a chance for the championship, Rosberg replied: [...] "Thank you very much for that piece of advice, I could figure that out for myself!" [...] Lewis Hamilton on the other hand lamented {{the fact that he was}} unable to follow Rosberg closely on track without damaging his tyres too much, saying that he would have otherwise had the pace to pass him. Third placed Sebastian Vettel called it [...] "a good race", but also [...] "not very exciting", since the Ferrari drivers had been [...] "in no-mans land" [...] behind the Mercedes.|$|E

500|$|In August 2008, The Hindu {{reported}} that Manobala would be directing {{a remake of}} Kadhalikka Neramillai with R. Madhavan in the lead role. Plans for a contemporary remake drew criticism. In an interview with Rekhs, a celebrity columnist for Behindwoods, Gopu said, [...] "This film {{even if it is}} remade today, will not hold a candle to its original". Crazy Mohan said, [...] "Kadhalikka Naeramillai is Tamil Cinema’s Mount Everest of comedy. There’s no other Tenzing [...] in sight so far. I was aghast that some people even considered re-making Kadhalikka Naeramillai. None should attempt it. It is blasphemy". Sharadha Narayanan of The New Indian Express stated in February 2009, [...] "Recently when the news of Kadhalikka Neramillai remake was announced, every lip had one question that went unanswered: Who can actually do Nagesh’s role at least the <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> if not better?"

500|$|During {{their writing}} sessions, Malay noticed Ocean's use of gender pronouns in his lyrics, but {{attributed}} it to Ocean's poetic license {{rather than his}} sexuality. In an interview after Ocean's open letter, Malay called him [...] "the new hybrid of what an MC {{used to be in}} the '80s or '90s ... the true storyteller" [...] and said of the lyrics, [...] "I don't think anyone during any given point during the creative process knew what was happening ... when he's singing maybe from a female perspective or whatever, it's a story, it's a world that he created. It's not necessarily his personal—like something that he's experiencing. Maybe it is and it's a metaphor the <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> it". They finished writing Channel Orange in two to three months. Ocean said of the album's development in an interview for Rap-Up, [...] "It succinctly defines me as an artist for where I am right now and that was the aim. It's about the stories. If I write 14 stories that I love, then the next step is to get the environment of music around it to best envelop the story and all kinds of sonic goodness." ...|$|E
500|$|Small Heath {{came back}} from a 2–1 half-time deficit to beat Grimsby Town 5–2, but the visit of Liverpool was eventful in a rather {{different}} manner. After the referee rejected the Liverpool players' claim that Small Heath's equaliser had entered the goal {{through a hole in the}} side netting, their play became rough, culminating in centre-half Joe McQue, a [...] "strapping fellow", kicking Frank Mobley in the abdomen, apparently intentionally. While the referee was cautioning McQue, Small Heath captain Caesar Jenkyns rushed in, knocked McQue to the ground, and was sent off. With a man advantage, it still took Liverpool until the stroke of time to score the winning goal. The Posts reporter suggested that, despite the provocation, Jenkyns should not have reacted the <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> but [...] "the knowledge that it cost his side the game" [...] was sufficient punishment. Despite the referee in his report agreeing that [...] "the punishment of being sent off would meet case", and that Jenkyns had [...] "played a perfectly fair game" [...] and had expressed regret at his actions, both when dismissed and after the game, the Football Association imposed a four-week suspension, to begin on 31 October.|$|E

When asked how the {{collaboration}} initially came about, Bieber said, [...] " [...] both live in Atlanta. I met him a year prior to this and we figured {{it was a perfect}} collaboration for him, so we invited him out to do it." [...] Bieber first premiered the song performing on MuchMusic on December 28, 2009. A few days before the release of the single, Bieber posted an acoustic version of the song to his YouTube with his guitarist Dan Kanterr, similar to the <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> with [...] "Favorite Girl". Billboard said that: [...] "Bieber delivers his characteristically clean vocals with conviction: [...] "My first love broke my heart for the first time / and I'm like, 'baby, baby, baby, no!'

500|$|In the 1963–64 U.S. Championship, Fischer {{achieved}} {{his second}} perfect score, this time against the top-ranked chess {{players in the}} country: [...] "This tournament became, as they say, the stuff of legend. The fact that Fischer won his sixth U.S. title was no surprise. The <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> it was spectacular." [...] "One by one Fischer mowed down the opposition as he cut an 11–0 swathe through the field, to demonstrate convincingly to the opposition that he was now {{in a class by}} himself." [...] This result brought Fischer heightened fame, including a profile in Life magazine. Sports Illustrated diagrammed each of the 11 games in its article, [...] "The Amazing Victory Streak of Bobby Fischer". Such extensive chess coverage was groundbreaking for the top American sports' magazine. His 11–0 win in the 1963–64 Championship is the only perfect score {{in the history of the}} tournament, and one of about ten perfect scores in high-level chess tournaments ever. David Hooper and Kenneth Whyld called it [...] "the most remarkable achievement of this kind". Fischer recalls: [...] "Motivated by my lopsided result (11–0!), Dr. [...] Kmoch congratulated [...] Evans (the runner up) on 'winning' the tournament...and then he congratulated me on 'winning the exhibition'." ...|$|E
500|$|After his 2010 {{debut album}} Doo-Wops & Hooligans, which {{produced}} the singles [...] "Just the Way You Are" [...] and [...] "Grenade", Bruno Mars revealed {{he wanted to}} create something unexpected with its follow-up. [...] "This is me going into the studio and recording and writing whatever I want," [...] Mars said confidently. [...] "This album represents my freedom." [...] It all started backstage, after a show, during a jamming session in a [...] "greenroom", while singing the phrase [...] "Locked Out of Heaven". According to Philip Lawrence, the track developed a meaning as they started to write it, [...] "when you’re with someone who’s showing you {{a new way to}} love." [...] The Smeezingtons went to New York to work with Jeff Bhasker, Emile Haynie and Mark Ronson and during a jamming session with drums, bass, and guitar, Mars created the riff of the song. He started singing the chorus previously created {{on the top of the}} riff. Then, The Smeezingtons went back to L.A., where they finished the lyrics and changed the original melody. Lawrence felt that the recording was [...] "sort of empty but it had a carnal vibe to it", making them enthusiastic to place a [...] "driving rhythm" [...] in it. The composer recalled thinking it was [...] "something special" [...] in the studio, the same <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> during the creation of [...] "Just The Way You Are" [...] and [...] "Billionaire".|$|E
500|$|Booth {{started the}} 196364 season strongly. He scored centuries {{in his first}} two innings, {{recording}} 121 and 169 not out against Queensland and Western Australia respectively. In his rapid innings against Western Australia at the SCG, which took only 165 minutes, Booth reached 100 in 94 minutes during the second session of the day. In the lead-up to the Tests, Booth scored 63 for his state against South Africa but was unable to prevent defeat. In the Tests, he began the <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> in the previous season, with a century. Coming to the crease with Australia at 3/88 in the first innings of the First Test in Brisbane, Booth withstood an opening burst of bouncers from South African spearhead Peter Pollock. He went on to accumulate his Test best of 169 from 81 overs of batting, in a display that gained wide praise because of his elegant strokemaking. One newspaper proclaimed that his innings had [...] "more Grace than the Princess of Monaco." [...] Ray Robinson said [...] "it was a tailored innings, fit to be put on display in a showcase and unrumpled by a single chance". South African skipper Trevor Goddard later said [...] "We didn't mind the leather chasing, when he played so charmingly". Booth's innings was the highlight of a match that was uneventful in terms of cricket but notorious for the no-balling of Ian Meckiff. A broken finger sidelined Booth for a month and prevented him from playing in the Second Test, but he returned for the Third Test in Sydney, and began a sequence of 75, 16, 58 and 24. He finished the series in the Fifth Test in his home town, top-scoring in both of Australia's innings, with 102 not out and 87 in a draw. It capped off a productive fortnight for Booth; he had scored 162 not out against South Australia before the final Test. In four Tests, he aggregated 531 runs at 88.50. For the entire first-class season, Booth had struck five centuries and totalled 1,180 runs. According to Gideon Haigh, he had [...] "played exquisitely" [...] throughout the season, which was his career peak and saw him named the Australian Cricketer of the Year for 196364.|$|E
