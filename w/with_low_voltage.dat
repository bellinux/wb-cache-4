50|$|High {{voltage power}} {{supplies}} typically apply {{the bulk of}} their input energy to a power inverter, which in turn drives a voltage multiplier or a high turns ratio, high voltage transformer, or both (usually a transformer followed by a multiplier) to produce high voltage. The high voltage is passed out of the power supply through the special connector, and is also applied to a voltage divider that converts it to a low voltage metering signal compatible <b>with</b> <b>low</b> <b>voltage</b> circuitry. The metering signal is used by a closed-loop controller that regulates the high voltage by controlling inverter input power, and it may also be conveyed out of the power supply to allow external circuitry to monitor the high voltage output.|$|E
50|$|There are {{a couple}} of {{drawbacks}} associated with pMOS: The electron holes that are the charge (current) carriers in pMOS transistors have lower mobility than the electrons that are the charge carriers in nMOS transistors (a ratio of approximately 2.5), furthermore pMOS circuits do not interface easily <b>with</b> <b>low</b> <b>voltage</b> positive logic such as DTL-logic and TTL-logic (the 7400-series). However, pMOS transistors are relatively easy to make and were therefore developed first — ionic contamination of the gate oxide from etching chemicals and other sources can very easily prevent (the electron based) nMOS transistors from switching off, while the effect in (the electron-hole based) pMOS transistors is much less severe. Fabrication of nMOS transistors therefore has to be many times cleaner than bipolar processing in order to produce working devices.|$|E

50|$|Flivver Lo-V's {{maintained}} the older braking {{system of the}} High Voltage equipment. The older setup, known as AMRE, featured different notches on the brake stand for the motorman depending on if he was operating his brakes with electric control (which synchronized the brakes on all cars of the train electrically) or if he was operating pneumatically (which did not synchronize the brakes, and took longer to react). The newer setup, {{to be known as}} AMUE, came on the Steinways and Standard Lo-Vs, but never on the Flivvers. AMUE brake stands would utilize the same notch to apply brakes {{regardless of whether or not}} the electric brake was active. However, the Flivvers {{maintained the}} older AMRE setup, which had also been used on many of the Hi-V cars.

50|$|Direct current vs. {{alternating}} current: The 1880s saw {{the spread}} of electric based lighting with large utilities and manufacturing companies supplying it. The systems initially ran on direct current (DC) and alternating current (AC) <b>with</b> <b>low</b> <b>voltage</b> DC being used for interior lighting and high voltage DC and AC running very bright exterior arc lighting. With {{the invention of the}} AC transformer in the mid 1880s, alternating current could be stepped up in voltage for long range transmission and stepped down again for domestic use, making it a much more efficient transmission standard now directly competing with DC for the indoor lighting market. In the U.S. Thomas Edison's Edison Electric Light Company tried to protect its patent controlled DC market by playing on the public's fears of the dangers of high voltage AC, portraying their main AC competitor, George Westinghouse's Westinghouse Electric Company, as purveyors of an unsafe system, a back and forth financial and propaganda competition that {{came to be known as}} the War of Currents. AC, with its more economic transmission would prevail, supplanting DC.|$|E

40|$|It is {{well known}} that there is an {{increasing}} trend on the design of low-voltage low-power circuits due to the requirement of efficient portable electronic systems with long battery lifetime.

5000|$|A further {{alternative}} {{that has been}} implemented at the laboratory stage is by {{the application of a}} high bias at the anode but by pickup of the signals from the cathode at floating ground, as shown in the [...] Concentric electrodes (E2, E3, E4) are made on a copper-coated fiberglass printed circuit board (PCB) and a copper wire (E1) is added {{at the center of the}} disk. The anode is made again from the same PCB with a conical hole (400 micrometres) to act as a pressure limiting aperture in the ESEM. The exposed fiberglass material inside the aperture cone together with its surface above are coated with silver paint in continuity with the copper material of the anode electrode (E0), which is held at high potential. The cathode electrodes are independently connected to ground amplifiers, which, in fact, can be biased <b>with</b> <b>low</b> <b>voltage</b> directly from the amplifier power supplies in the range of ±15 volts without any further coupling required. On account of the induction mechanism operating behind the GDD, this configuration is equivalent to the previous diagram, except for the inverted signal that is electronically restored. While electrode E0 is held at 250 V, meaningful imaging is done as shown by a [...] with composition of signals from various electrodes at two pressures of supplied air. All images show part of the central copper wire (E1), exposed fiber-glass (FG, middle), and copper (part of E2) with some silver paint used to attach the wire. The close resemblance of (a) with (b) at low pressure and (c) with (d) at high pressure is a manifestation of the principle of equivalence by induction.
