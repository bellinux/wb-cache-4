5|$|I {{had gone}} to Puerto Rico and was {{influenced}} by Latin music at that moment. When I came back, the melody was in my head. It was at a melancholy {{point in my life}} and the song reflects the yearning that was going on inside of me. It <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>being</b> in a situation but you want to break free and you can't, so your confined yet you're releasing those emotion through the lyrics and the actual act of singing. Thats why {{think a lot of people}} felt very strongly about that song, because the emotion is clear when you listen to it.|$|E

I hung out {{with a lot of}} rock stars but no one ever did that to the same extent. There was just an ease to the whole thing. They really were the kindest, most fun band I ever worked with." ...|$|E

And [...] <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>being</b> in a windmill; it turned and moved.|$|E

500|$|During {{the filming}} of the episode, The X-Files was {{canceled}} by the Fox network, meaning that the show would not return for a tenth season. Robert Patrick explained that series creator Chris Carter watched him film a scene—an act which he had reportedly not done since Patrick had been hired in 2000—and then informed him of the show's cancellation. Patrick noted that Fox's new show 24 was being heavily promoted instead of The X-Files, an act which he felt <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>being</b> [...] "abandoned by Fox".|$|E
500|$|In a {{departure}} from industry practice, Radiohead conducted no interviews and did not tour before the release of A Moon Shaped Pool. On 30 April 2016, days before the album was announced, fans who had previously made orders from Radiohead received embossed cards with lyrics from the album's lead single, [...] "Burn the Witch". On 1 May, Radiohead deleted all content from their website and social media profiles, replacing them with blank images. Donwood said the idea had been [...] "a way {{of getting rid of}} all of [...] had gone before ... It <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>being</b> some sort of evil Bond villain or something, in some lair, pressing buttons ... It was creatively brilliant fun." [...] Pitchfork interpreted the move as symbolic of Radiohead's re-emergence.|$|E
500|$|When {{playing for}} Bermuda, Goater {{was often the}} only {{professional}} player in the team. Bermudian journalist Chris Gibbons described the difference between Goater and his teammates: [...] "He's a class above every other player on the island. Before he went to England he was just quick, but now he's a totally different player, a lot more aggressive and a much better header of the ball. The problem has been that he sets up chances for the others without them being on the same wavelength." [...] However, Goater noted that this had a detrimental aspect: [...] "My fitness dropped off while I was with Bermuda. It <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>being</b> on holiday. The team just ate what they liked. I kept to my professional diet for {{about two or three}} weeks until peer pressure took over." ...|$|E

500|$|Thematically, Stefani {{considered}} the album to be mainly [...] "a breakup record", declaring: [...] "I {{would consider it}} a breakup record. [...] It just makes me believe in God and my journey. My cross to bear was to go through these heartbreaks and write these songs and help people." [...] The singer also told Ryan Seacrest that while writing the songs for the album during her personal struggles {{with the end of}} her marriage, she felt the process was therapeutic. She commented: [...] "The record company was like, 'Listen, we really think your record is too personal and {{no one is going to}} relate to this record and maybe you should just put it out as an artistic body of work—don't even think about radio'." [...] She described the sensation of hearing this <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>being</b> punched in the stomach.|$|E
500|$|... "Oh {{it was so}} fun, it was amazing. For me it <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>being</b> on a Martin Scorsese set. I've been so low {{budget for}} so long, and to have this {{incredibly}} amazing video was really very humbling. It was really fun, but you'll see if you ever come to a video shoot of mine one day– I'm very private about those things, I don't really talk to everybody. I'm not like the party girl running around. I might even {{seem to be a}} bit of a diva. I'm sort of with myself, in my work head space worrying about costumes, and if extras look right, and placement. I don't just show up for things, you know. That video was a vision of mine. It was Melina the director who wanted to do something, to have a performance art aspect that was so pop but it was still commercial, but that felt like lifestyle. It was all those things, I love it." ...|$|E
500|$|He {{recalled}} later: [...] "He {{positioned himself}} {{off to one}} side of-and some distance away from-the last Il-2 in a formation of six. He then turned in quickly and opened fire at the enemy's cockpit from an angle of some 30 degrees. The Il-2 immediately burst into flames and crashed. 'Do you see how it's done?', Oberst Mölders' voice came over the R/T. 'Right, now you take the next one.' I carried out the same manoeuvre and, sure enough, the next Il-2 went down on fire. 'And again!' It <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>being</b> on a training flight. Another short burst and the third Il-2 was ablaze. The whole lesson had lasted no more than 12 minutes!" [...] In this way, Kaiser scored his 23rd and 24th kills. But because Mölders was officially banned from operational flying, the first Soviet aircraft was never officially credited to him. Within the next two months, it is speculated that Mölders unofficially shot down around another 30 Soviet aircraft. At least six of Mölders' unofficial victories are recorded in his fellow pilots' private log books.|$|E

500|$|The episode guest starred Omi Vaidya, {{who played}} the part of Sadiq, the IT assistant. Vaidya later {{explained}} that, originally, [...] "a lot of people auditioned for that role, bigger Indian American actors". However Vaidya, who had watched the British version and {{was familiar with the}} camera style, [...] "took a scarf, created a turban out of it and walked to the audition room with it on" [...] because he thought that [...] "that was what was needed for the character and the show". He later called his guest appearance [...] "one of the best productions in the United States that I have been a part of." [...] Vaidya said that he enjoyed shooting the party scenes the most because they got to drink real beer and play video games on an Xbox 360, which had not been released at the time. Vaidya said that [...] "it <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>being</b> at a real party with everyone from The Office except that we had to shoot a few scenes while we were chatting and relaxing." ...|$|E
500|$|Possessed of {{a strong}} intelligence, McCain did well in a few {{subjects}} that interested him, such as English literature, history, and government. [...] There was a fixed Bachelor of Science curriculum taken by all midshipmen; [...] McCain's classmates were impressed by his cramming abilities on mathematics, science, and engineering courses and thought his low grades were by inclination and not ability, while McCain would later acknowledge that those courses were a struggle for him. [...] His class rank was further lowered by poor grades for conduct and leadership, which reflected his sloppy appearance, rebellious attitude, and poor relations with his company officer. [...] Despite his low standing, he was popular and a leader among his fellow midshipmen, in what biographer Robert Timberg called a [...] "manic, intuitive, highly idiosyncratic way". Good at attracting women, he was famed for organizing off-Yard activities with a group who called themselves [...] "the Bad Bunch"; one classmate said that [...] "being on liberty with John McCain <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>being</b> in a train wreck." [...] Other midshipmen were annoyed by his behavior. [...] A June 1957 training cruise aboard the destroyer [...] found McCain showing good skills at the conn, and the destination stop in Rio de Janeiro led to a dream-like romance with Brazilian fashion model and ballerina Maria Gracinda that persisted through a Christmastime reunion.|$|E

2500|$|While {{acknowledging}} {{that the differences}} between women are wide and varied, most of Lorde's works are concerned with two subsets that concerned her primarily—race and sexuality.
