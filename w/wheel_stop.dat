50|$|The {{crew were}} cleared to close Atlantis payload bay doors at 10:14 UTC, {{and this was}} {{completed}} by 10:28 UTC. At 12:32 UTC, NASA cleared Atlantis to land on its first opportunity at KSC. A two-minute-43-second de-orbit burn was conducted, beginning at 13:00 UTC. This was followed by entry interface at 13:35 UTC. Atlantis touched down on Runway 15 of the Shuttle Landing Facility at 9:07 am EST (14:07:10 UTC), approximately 12 days, 18 hours, 21 minutes and 40 seconds into the mission. <b>Wheel</b> <b>stop</b> occurred at 09:08 EST (14:08:08 UTC).|$|E
50|$|Landing 11 October 1994, 1:02:09 pm EDT. Edwards Air Force Base {{concrete}} Runway 22. Endeavour did an OMS deorbit burn at 12:09 pm EDT about 4600 mi {{from the}} landing strip at Edwards Air Force Base. The burn lasted 2 min 17 s which lowered Endeavour's velocity 232 ft/s. Astronaut John Casper flew the shuttle training aircraft at Edwards {{and said the}} weather was clear with light winds. Approach was from the southwest with a right overhead turn of 280 degrees. Nose wheel touchdown at 13:02:21 EDT. <b>Wheel</b> <b>stop</b> at 13:03:08 EDT. Rollout was approximately 8495 ft down the runway. Landing speed at main touchdown was approximately 265 mi/h km/h. Orbiter landing mass was 100709 kg. Payload landing mass was 12511 kg.|$|E

40|$|One {{possible}} {{mechanism for}} post-spaceflight orthostatic hypotension, which affects approximately 30 % of astronauts after short duration shuttle missions, is inadequate norepinephrine release during upright posture. We performed a two phased {{study to determine}} the effectiveness of an alpha 1 -adrenergic agonist, midodrine, as a countermeasure to post-spaceflight orthostatic hypotension. The {{first phase of the}} study examined the landing day orthostatic responses of six veteran astronauts after oral midodrine (10 mg) administered on the ground within approximately two hours of <b>wheel</b> <b>stop.</b> One female crewmember exhibited orthostatic hypotension in a previous flight but not after midodrine. Five male crewmembers, who did not exhibit orthostatic hypotension during previous flights, also did not show signs of orthostatic hypotension after midodrine. Additionally, phase one showed that midodrine did not cause hypertension in these crewmembers. In the second phase of this study, midodrine is ingested inflight (near time of ignition, TIG) and orthostatic responses are determined immediately upon landing via an 80 degree head-up tilt test performed on the crew transport vehicle (CTV). Four of ten crewmembers have completed phase two of this study. Two crewmembers completed the landing day tilt tests, while two tests were ended early due to presyncopal symptoms. All subjects had decreased landing day stroke volumes and increased heart rates compared to preflight. Midodrine appears to have increased total peripheral resistance in one crewmember who was able to complete the landing day tilt test. The effectiveness of midodrine as a countermeasure to immediate post-spaceflight orthostatic hypotension has yet to be determined; interpretation is made more difficult due to low subject number and the lack of control subjects on the CTV...|$|E
40|$|The shuttle crew {{wears the}} Advanced Crew Escape Spacesuit (ACES) to protect {{themselves}} from cabin decompression and to support bail out during landing. ACES is cooled by a liquid-cooled garment (LCG) that interfaces to a heat exchanger that dumps heat into the cabin. The ACES outer layer is made of Gore-Tex(Registered TradeMark), permitting water vapor to escape while containing oxygen. The crew can only lose heat via insensible water losses and the LCG. Under nominal landing operations, the average cabin temperature rarely exceeds 75 F, which is adequate for the ACES to function. Problem A rescue shuttle will need to return 11 crew members if the previous mission suffers a thermal protection system failure, preventing it from returning safely to Earth. Initial analysis revealed that 11 crew members in the shuttle will increase cabin temperature at <b>wheel</b> <b>stop</b> above 80 F, which decreases the ACES ability to keep crew members cool. Air flow in the middeck of the shuttle is inhomogeneous and some ACES may experience much higher temperatures that could cause excessive thermal stress to crew members. Methods A ground study was conducted to measure the cooling efficiency of the ACES at 75 F, 85 F, and 95 F at 50 % relative humidity. Test subjects representing 5, 50, and 95 percentile body habitus of the astronaut corps performed hand ergometry keeping their metabolic rate at 400, 600, and 800 BTU/hr for one hour. Core temperature was measured by rectal probe and skin, while inside and outside the suit. Environmental chamber wall and cooling unit inlet and outlet temperatures were measured using high-resolution thermistors (0. 2 C). Conclusions Under these test conditions, the ACES was able to protect the core temperature of all test subjects, however thermal stress due to high insensible losses and skin temperature and skin heat flow may impact crew performance. Further research should be performed to understand the impact on cognitive performance...|$|E
2500|$|Atlantis’ main {{landing gear}} wheels touched down at 09:44:23am EST (14:44:23 UTC) on Runway 33, {{followed}} by the nose wheel at 9:44:36am EST (14:44:36 UTC). The shuttle’s <b>wheels</b> <b>stopped</b> at 9:45:05am EST (14:45:05 UTC). This was the 72nd space shuttle landing at Kennedy Space Center. As the shuttle rolled to a halt, Commander Hobaugh announced [...] "Houston, Atlantis, wheels stop". CAPCOM Christopher Ferguson replied the crew, [...] "Roger, <b>wheels</b> <b>stopped,</b> Atlantis, that was a picture-perfect end to a top-fuel mission to the space station.

50|$|The Showcase Showdown {{was played}} {{the same way}} as on the American version. If the <b>wheel</b> <b>stopped</b> at the MXN$1, the {{contestant}} won a bonus prize of MXN$1,000 and a bonus spin. In the bonus spin, if the <b>wheel</b> <b>stopped</b> on MXN$0.05, the contestant won a bonus prize of MXN$5,000; if it stopped on MXN$0.15, the player won a bonus prize of MXN$15,000; and if it stopped on MXN$1, a new car was won. The higher number without exceeding MXN$1 went on to the El Gran Paquete; {{in the event of a}} tie, the tied players go to a one-spin spin-off. However, if the tie involved with the bonus spin, there'll be another spin-off but no more money to be won.|$|R
50|$|The {{winner of}} the first three rounds got a chance to spin an 8 colored space with 2 colors each. A clip will play on the colored station of where the <b>wheel</b> <b>stops.</b> If the {{contestant}} answers correctly on the final question, they win the grand prize.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} Saturday Spin was weekly {{beginning on}} March 7, 1987. Each week, five players who had mailed non-winning instant tickets had {{their names on}} a special wheel, the player whose name the <b>wheel</b> <b>stopped</b> on would win $50,000 or $100,000 in cash, or a $1 million annuity.|$|R

5|$|The main {{landing gear}} touched down at 12:01:27pmEST (17:01:27UTC) on 20 November, a mission elapsed time (MET) of 8days 4hours 30minutes and 44seconds. Nose gear touched down at 8days 4hours 30minutes 54seconds (12:01:37pmEST – 17:01:37UTC) and Atlantiss <b>wheels</b> <b>stopped</b> at an MET of 8days 4hours 31minutes 42seconds (12:02:24pmEST – 17:02:24UTC), {{bringing}} the 73rd space shuttle mission to a close.|$|R
50|$|However, the {{escapement}} had disadvantages which limited {{its use in}} watches: it was {{fragile and}} required skilled maintenance; it was not self-starting, so if the watch was jarred in use so the balance <b>wheel</b> <b>stopped,</b> it would not start up again; and it was harder to manufacture in volume. Therefore, the self-starting lever escapement became dominant in watches.|$|R
50|$|Thirty {{contestant}}s {{were in the}} contestant pool, all {{selected from}} those who sent in losing scratch-off lottery tickets. Alexander/Stahl would spin a wheel that was hooked to a randomizer. When the <b>wheel</b> <b>stopped,</b> the player selected would play a game, in addition to winning a set of lottery tickets. These rules were similar to Illinois Instant Riches.|$|R
50|$|The second landing {{opportunity}} was {{a complete}} success with main gear touchdown occurring at 20:39:08 EDT (00:39:08 UTC 27 March 2008), nose gear touchdown at 20:39:17 EDT (00:39:17 UTC 27 March 2008), and <b>wheels</b> <b>stop</b> at 20:40:41 EDT (00:40:41 UTC 27 March 2008), completing the STS-123 crew's 16 days, 14 hours, 12 minutes, 27 seconds space voyage.|$|R
