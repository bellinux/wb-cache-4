40|$|Abstract This devise {{addresses}} the inadequacies {{of providing a}} quick means of holding jobs of irregular shapes such as are encountered in small scale fabrication workshops. The conventional bench vise often does not provide the adequate grip for such shapes so that attachments {{in the form of}} V blocks are usually provided to enhance the grip before drilling operations are carried out. This versatile <b>work</b> <b>holding</b> <b>device</b> enables fabricators to perform drilling and other production operations on a work piece. This device produced from mild steel plates uses the toggle principle to provide rapid grip. Comparative tests on time span in the use of this device and the bench vice for job set up, production operation and then disassembly showed that time is gained with use of the device...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Jigs and fi xtures are {{essential}} for metal machining. In their designs, the sizing of these components of <b>work</b> <b>holding</b> <b>devices</b> requires {{a great deal of}} experience and careful judgment. This paper describes an application of loop equations for tolerance allocation in jig and fi xture design. The technique makes use of two basic equations, for sizes and for tolerances, to relate all functional dimensions to a functional requirement. This can simplify and facilitate the design of specifi cation limits for jig and fi xture components. The implementation of the technique is illustrated through a simple example of a milling fi xture. Keywords jig and fi xture design; tolerance allocation; dimensional analysis; loop equation...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{the present}} day batch {{production}} scenario the time taken to program the deburring robot for each batch {{is one of the}} major concerns in the industry. In the batch production scenario deburring robots are programmed by operators via so-called “Teach” or “Offline” programming methodologies and require costlier <b>work</b> <b>holding</b> <b>devices.</b> Both these methodologies have associated weaknesses like a high programming time especially when each batch of workpiece has a different shape. Moreover offline methodology cannot carry information of the real work piece. In this paper, a Vision-Guided Robotic System (VGRS) methodology for the deburring of workpieces to eliminate the weakness of “Teach” or “Offline” programming methodologies is proposed. In this proposed system the shape of two-dimensional workpiece is acquired for each workpiece and the robot-language program is generated automatically from the workpiece shape data and finishing condition data. The proposed method is verified by experiments using the robot system. This method provides a compact and inexpensive finishing robot system which reduces the programming time...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} an attempt {{has been made}} to design, analyse and {{fabricate}} a linear two axis indexing drill jig. Basically, Jig is a <b>work</b> <b>holding</b> <b>device</b> which also guides the tool. The main purpose of making this Jig is to perform “chain drilling” without any need of shifting the job regularly, as the drilling spot is located by the movement of the tables on both X-Y directions. This results in reduction in production time and can be used for mass production. The movement of the tables is done with the help of lead screws. We have also screwed scales {{in the body of the}} jig so that the job doesn’t have to be measured again and again which will result in more time consumption, Therefore the main purpose of a linear two axis indexing drill jig is to drill proper, more accurate and precise holes...|$|E

The milling fixtures so far are generally used on milling machines. The present volume of this paper includes the unique aspect of designing of a 4 axis – 360 o indexing milling fixture for CNC. This fixture provides locating and clamping provisions for as large as 28 numbers of operations to be performed on support plate, one {{of the components of}} color mixing machine. The real time application of the research reflects from the fact that a real industrial component is taken for fixture designing. The designed fixture has the important characteristic of allowing all 28 operations to be performed on component in a single set up.

40|$|Abrasive Jet Machining (AJM) is {{the process}} of {{material}} removal from a work piece by the application of a high speed stream of abrasive particles suspended in a gas medium from a nozzle. The material removal process is mainly caused by brittle fracture by impingement and then by erosion. The AJM will chiefly be used to cut shapes, drill holes and de-burr in hard and brittle materials like glass, ceramics etc. In this project, a model of the Abrasive Jet Machine was designed using CAD packages like AutoCAD and CATIA. Care was taken to efficiently use the available material and space. The machine was fabricated in the institute workshop with convectional machine tools like arc welding machine, hand drill, grinding machine using commonly available materials like mild steel sheet and rod, aluminum sheet, glue, polythene sheet,glass fiber which are commonly available in the local market. Care has been taken to use less fabricated components, because, the lack of accuracy in fabricated components would lead to a reduced performance of the machine. The machine was be automated to have 3 axes travel using microcontroller and driver arrangement along with stepper motor. The different functional components of AJM are the machining chamber, <b>work</b> <b>holding</b> <b>device,</b> abrasive drainage system, compressor, air filter and regulator, abrasive nozzle, and mixing chamber with cam motor arrangement.

50|$|Since {{dovetail}} slides {{have such}} a large surface contact area, a greater force is required to move the saddle than other linear slides, which results in slower acceleration rates. Additionally, dovetail slides have difficulties with high-friction but are advantageous {{when it comes to}} load capacity, affordability and durability. Capable of long travel, dovetail slides are more resistant to shock than other bearings, and they are mostly immune to chemical, dust and dirt contamination. Dovetail slides can be motorized, mechanical or electromechanical. Electric dovetail slides are driven by a number of different devices, such as ball screws, belts and cables, which are powered by functional motors such as stepper motors, linear motors and handwheels. Dovetail slides are direct contact systems, making them fitting for heavy load applications including CNC machines, shuttle devices, special machines and <b>work</b> <b>holding</b> <b>devices.</b> Mainly used in the manufacturing and laboratory science industries, dovetail slides are ideal for high-precision applications.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIt is {{a common}} {{practice}} for any manufacturers to control {{the quality of their}} product in order to satisfy the customers’ needs. This is particularly important for most machined parts which require a stringent dimensional and geometrical control. Once a machined part is produced, an inspection process is carried out to check whether the part is within specified tolerances. The purpose of the inspection procedure is to ensure that the part will meet its functional and performance requirements in their overall assembly. One of the most important tolerances to be controlled on a cylindrical machined part is the roundness error. A roundness measuring machine (RMM) and coordinate measuring machine (CMM) are the general metrological equipment used for inspection of roundness which normally performed in a quality room. This study aims to develop an in-line inspection of roundness error using machine vision. The system is developed with a machine vision (camera), <b>work</b> <b>holding</b> tools, lighting <b>device</b> and also image processing software for roundness evaluation.

40|$|This master {{thesis is}} a {{development}} project that {{is carried out}} for process improvement and automation for the measurement equipment at “SAAB AB”, Linköping focusing on several sections including sheet metal, welding and pipe bending sections. Those are the core sections of the manufacturing of the latest fighter systems from “SAAB AB” such as Gripen, Neuron (unmanned aircraft) and other development projects. SAAB AB has the following issues:  Setup time of different parts in the specified departments is higher for the quality checking.  The quality inspection of different parts is manual and takes much time.  Use of scanning technology to reduce inspection time and increase reliability. The writers of the research work has done a comprehensive investigation and critical analysis of the current condition of the specified departments of “SAAB AB” and made a research work {{on how to make}} the process more efficient by implementing automation especially with the use of scanning technology and reduce the huge development cost. The developing process of a new product involves the manufacturing of prototypes and their <b>work</b> <b>holding</b> <b>devices.</b> The company in focus for this study often has to make very complex fixtures which are much time consuming and less cost efficient than if the firm would be able to use standardised fixtures. In addition the projects that involve the development of prototypes for one-piece production if unsuccessful are often closed without any future commercial production. The authors have tried to find out the solution for the development projects of “SAAB AB” by studying different Swedish and other renowned industries, mostly automobile and aerospace companies. Another task has been to choose vendors for the CMM and Laser Scanner products as well as suitable software for them. The thesis writing team has investigated the software and hardware systems of industrial metrology especially on the CMMs and Laser Scanners; their manufacturers and also the “Interoperability” issue that lies between the metrology software and 3 D CAD modelling software. One of the big challenges has been to choose vendors for the hardware of measurement instruments from a very large market. The authors have selected suitable vendors of laser scanners and portable arms on the basis of market study, the features of those hardware to measure accurately, rapidly and quick setup. Choosing a specific model of hardware was avoided as this research work could be used, not only for this project rather than any other similar future reference for same types of research work. This project demands an overall solution that can be integrated within the parameters of the constraints such as CATIA V 5 as software and also using MBD (Model Based Designing) models, Based on this the authors have chosen the most compatible software platform that {{can be found in the}} market today...|$|R

40|$|Abstract:- Zero-order <b>hold</b> <b>devices</b> (ZOH) {{are mainly}} used in digital control {{applications}} {{to obtain the}} output analog signals of digitally implemented controllers. However, it is proved that special <b>hold</b> <b>devices</b> such as the fractional order <b>hold</b> <b>device</b> (FROH) can improve, if properly tuned, the performance of hybrid control systems. Although the applicability of these devices has been theoretically studied in numerous works, there is no report of real experimentation with digital controllers that include special <b>hold</b> <b>devices</b> for the control signal interpolation. This lack of real application experiments is mainly due to the difficulties encountered in implementing such <b>hold</b> <b>devices</b> with the processing speed and configurability that real-time digital controllers require. This paper describes a totally configurable digital design of a FROH device, adequate for any digital control system platform.
