5|$|In St. Louis, Anson Stokes, an apathetic {{employee}} at a self storage facility, is yelled at by his boss {{to clean out}} an old and dusty storage locker. To his surprise, he finds a woman wrapped in a rug. His boss comes to check on him; while he is yelling for Anson, his mouth disappears. FBI agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) speak <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>boss,</b> Jay Gilmore, after surgery to fix his mouth, which has left him disfigured and with a speech impediment. They question Stokes' brother Leslie at their mobile home, which inexplicably has a large boat in its tiny front yard. The woman from the storage container is in the Stokes brothers' kitchen. Mulder and Scully search the container and find old antiques {{and a picture of}} the previous owner with the woman from the apartment.|$|E

25|$|Gravano {{eventually}} became {{embroiled in a}} dispute with business partner Louie DiBono, a member of another Gambino crew. A sit-down with Castellano was held, at which an irate Gravano accused DiBono of withholding $200,000 in payments for subcontracts and threatened to kill DiBono. Gambino underboss Neil Dellacroce intervened on Gravano's behalf and Castellano told the two men to end their business partnership, though Gravano's standing <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>boss</b> slipped {{as a result of}} the incident. Dellacroce, however, was rising star John Gotti's mentor, and when word got back to him that Dellacroce had supported Gravano, Gotti was impressed.|$|E

25|$|Jeremiah is {{an aging}} {{member of the}} TNT. He is an Italian immigrant, and a running gag of the series {{is that he is}} an extreme hypochondriac who suffers from many {{diseases}} or medical syndromes (and sometimes, he even suffers from diseases he invented). He is bald and nearly toothless, and he usually sleeps around in the flower shop <b>with</b> <b>The</b> <b>Boss.</b> He is usually on guard duty and never on active missions due to his age, but sometimes proves crucial to missions. Another running gag is his ability to sleep through most extreme situations without waking up. He is a former street vendor and a hermit, which caused his bad health.|$|E

2500|$|IGN's Brandon Justice {{scored the}} Dreamcast version 9.4 out of 10, giving it an [...] "Editor's Choice" [...] award, and calling it [...] "a must own." [...] He praised the [...] "breath-taking {{combination}} of killer artwork and creative level design," [...] and argued the game improved {{on the original}} in every way. He was especially impressed <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>boss</b> fights, the controls and the level design. He concluded [...] "MDK2 is this generation's best example of a pure action shooter, and goes down in my book {{as one of the}} genre's most complete titles to date. Awesome visuals, creative design, killer boss encounters, excellent control, tons of variety, and even a dash of challenge thrown in for good measure. Nearly every aspect of BioWare's sensational sequel shines in a way that sheds a painfully revealing light on their competitors' glaring inadequacies." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2008, Brooks {{returned}} to EastEnders for a guest stint. She was later confirmed {{to be coming}} back as a regular character. She said, [...] "I had doubts to begin with, mainly because of Kiki, as I know how full-on EastEnders can be, and then there's that stigma {{about going back to}} a soap. But I'm so pleased I did, it was the right decision. Especially with what's going on at the moment, I feel really lucky to have a job and I need the security because of Kiki. I was just going to go back for a year, but I had a meeting <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>boss</b> last week and we're going to go for another year. So lots more time to get up to much mischief". Executive producer Diederick Santer said, [...] "I couldn't be more pleased that Charlie Brooks is re-joining EastEnders. With her appearances last month, she reminded us what a fine actress she is, and what an intriguing, watchable and engaging character she plays as Janine". She temporarily departed in September 2012, and returned in April 2013 before departing again in March 2014.|$|E

50|$|Because {{it is an}} {{activity}} that deals with large sums of sounding money, {{out of the reach}} of the government control, the game has attracted the attention of corrupt officials, who may ally <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>bosses.</b> <b>The</b> <b>bosses</b> are always interested in buying the leniency of the government or the removal from office of people active on the game's repression. Due to its unlawful bonds with public officials of dubious character, the game still exists, more than a hundred years after its creation.|$|R

Off the drunks perhaps. Put down three and carry five. What is that, a bob here and there, dribs and drabs. On the {{wholesale}} orders perhaps. Doing a double shuffle with the town travellers. Square it you <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>boss</b> and we'll split the job, see? ...|$|E

He said: [...] "Nobody knows anything about that trail. Jim Deacon, the head-man of our party when we left Hazleton, was only about seventy miles out, and cutting fallen timber like a man chopping cord wood, and sending back for more help.

Just as I reached him, the boss lifted one of the sticks and hit a small white ball with it. He had never seemed to want to play with me before, and I took it as a great compliment. I raced after the ball, which he had hit quite a long way, picked it up in my mouth, and brought it back to him. I laid it at his feet, and smiled up at him.|$|E

60|$|Now, in {{the days}} when Albert Parsons had fought whole {{families}} of Toms in an evening, he had fought in rounds, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>boss</b> holding the watch, and half-minute rests, and water to refresh him, and all orderly and proper. Today there were no rounds, no rests, no water, and the peaceful tending of cows had caused flesh to grow where there had been only muscle. Tom's headlong rushes became less easy to side-step, his swinging blows more difficult than the scientific counter that shot out to check them. As he tired Tom seemed to regain strength. The tide of the battle began to ebb. He clinched, and Tom threw him off. He feinted, and while he was feinting Tom was on him. It was the climax of the battle--the last rally. Down went Albert, and stayed down. Physically, he was not finished; but in his mind a question had framed itself--the question. 'Was it worth it?'--and he was answering, 'No.' There were other girls in the world. No girl was worth all this trouble.|$|E
60|$|Davidson did {{not feel}} called upon to defend Heyst.

The English clerk of Tesmans remembered that she had a sallow face. He was respectable and highly proper. He was not the sort to associate with such people. Most of these women were fairly battered specimens. Schomberg had them housed in what he called the Pavilion, in the grounds, where they were hard at it mending and washing their white dresses, and could be seen hanging them out to dry between the trees, like a lot of washerwomen. They looked very much like middle-aged washerwomen on the platform, too.
