40|$|Presented diploma thesis {{deals with}} {{problems}} connected with accidents at railroad crossings {{from the road}} and railway drivers´ perspectives. The theoretical part is particularly focused on the explanation of chosen regulations associated with railroad crossings, with their construction and technical design and also with ways and options of marking in connection with railroad crossing safety system. The paper mentions the most frequent causes why dangerous situations occur. These causes arise from the railway and road drivers´ personal experience, supplemented by statistics of accidents at railroad crossings for the previous periods. The practical part analyses the options for averting a collision on two particular railroad crossings. For this purpose, the railroad crossing secured by lights and the railroad crossing secured only by a <b>warning</b> <b>cross</b> were chosen. Here, with Virtual Crash programme support, {{the origin of the}} chosen crisis situations is simulated and later options of their averting are evaluated. Finally, proposals for increasing railroad crossings safety are formulated for both cases. The appendix consists of a list of legislative regulations dealing with railroad crossings, a driving record of the rail vehicle and its technical parameters and simulation programme´s outputs...|$|E

40|$|The {{introduction}} of safety technologies into complex socio-technical systems requires an integrated and {{holistic approach to}} HF and engineering, considering the effects of failures not only within system boundaries, but also at the interfaces with other systems and humans. Level <b>crossing</b> <b>warning</b> devices are examples of such systems where technically safe states within the system boundary can influence road user performance, giving rise to other hazards that degrade safety of the system. Chris will discuss the challenges that have been encountered to date in developing a safety argument in support of low-cost level <b>crossing</b> <b>warning</b> devices. The design and failure modes of level <b>crossing</b> <b>warning</b> devices {{are known to have}} a significant influence on road user performance; however, quantifying this effect is one of the ongoing challenges in determining appropriate reliability and availability targets for low-cost level <b>crossing</b> <b>warning</b> devices...|$|R

Patrick Cooney, the Minister for Justice, introduced legislation in 1974 to regulate and allow for married couples to obtain contraceptives.

5000|$|In {{the months}} leading up to SunRail going operational, the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) ran an {{aggressive}} public-safety campaign to warn drivers and passengers about railroad safety using pamphlets, puppet shows for children, YouTube and even a Safety Mascot Squirrel named Tie. [...] Despite this effort, SunRail has experienced several accidents with both motorists and pedestrians. Nearly a year into service, officials began installing dial-up grade crossing systems at grade crossings that are located closest to the stations. This system allows train crews to manually activate grade <b>crossing</b> <b>warning</b> devices (i.e. <b>crossing</b> gates, lights and bells) from the locomotive cab via key-coded radio transmission, thus eliminating the confusion of the grade <b>crossing</b> <b>warning</b> devices automatically activating, deactivating and reactivating whenever trains approach, stop at and depart the stations.|$|R

For analysis were chosen problematic railroad crossing where happened in {{last five years}} traffic accidents with consequences of death. Next criterion of choosing was type of security device. Chosen railroads crossing are representing all types of normally used security devices. That is why was chose railroad <b>crossing</b> with only <b>warning</b> <b>crosses,</b> light security device and last one with light security device with barrier beam. Theoretical part aims on: Basic parameters, dividing, numbering, system of function and marking of railroad crossing. In practical part, there are used mathematical calculations for assessment of safety on chosen railroad crossing and for determination of possibilities of averting a collision of both participants.

5000|$|Kitty {{hints that}} Roy should ask Myra {{to marry him}} and tries to {{convince}} Myra to accept a proposal, justifying the idea as an expedient of survival. Rationalizing that Myra will make a soldier happy for a few days, Kitty tells her that she owes it to herself as an honest resolution to a predicament she did not create. Mrs. Hobley learns that Roy is flush with back pay and encourages Myra so Roy will pay her delinquent rent. The gullible Roy is worried {{that he will be}} sent to Camp Bramshott at any moment to prepare for return to the front and proposes. Myra accepts, but then sneaks away when she feels guilty. Restored to duty, Roy assigns part of his pay to her and names her as the beneficiary of his life insurance. Mrs. Hobley, in need of self-justification, tells Roy that her [...] "Christian duty" [...] compels her to warn him that Myra is a [...] "harlot". Roy accepts the truth as a reality of the times and rejects her <b>warning.</b> <b>Crossing</b> the bridge {{on his way to the}} railway station, he meets Myra again and makes her promise to accept the allotment and sign for the life insurance benefit. After he leaves for Bramshott, Myra remains on the bridge, lighting a cigarette, just as a German air raid begins, and she is killed.|$|R

40|$|The Cooperative Research Centre (CRC) for Rail Innovation is {{conducting}} a tranche of industry-led research projects looking into safer rail level crossings. This paper will {{provide an overview of}} the Affordable Level Crossings project, a project that is performing research in both engineering and human factors aspects of low-cost level <b>crossing</b> <b>warning</b> devices (LCLCWDs), and is facilitating a comparative trial of these devices over a period of 12 months in several jurisdictions. Low-cost level <b>crossing</b> <b>warning</b> devices (LCLCWDs) are characterised by the use of alternative technologies for high cost components including train detection and connectivity (e. g. radar, acoustic, magnetic induction train detection systems and wireless connectivity replacing traditional track circuits and wiring). These devices often make use of solar power where mains power is not available, and aim to make substantial savings in lifecycle costs. The project involves trialling low-cost level <b>crossing</b> <b>warning</b> devices in shadow-mode, where devices are installed without the road-user interface at a number of existing level crossing sites that are already equipped with conventional active warning systems. It may be possible that the deployment of lower-cost devices can provide a significantly larger safety benefit over the network than a deployment of expensive conventional devices, as the lower cost would allow more passive level crossing sites to be upgraded with the same capital investment. The project will investigate reliability and safety integrity issues of the low-cost devices, as well as evaluate lifecycle costs and investigate human factors issues related to warning reliability. This paper will focus on the requirements and safety issues of LCLCWDs, and will provide an overview of the Rail CRC projects...|$|R
