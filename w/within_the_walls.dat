5|$|In 1374 {{control of}} Gibraltar was {{transferred}} from Marinid Morocco to Nasrid Granada. In 1410, however, the Moorish garrison revolted and declared their allegiance to Morocco, {{leading to the}} sixth siege in 1411 when the Granadan Nasrids stormed the city with assistance from sympathisers <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls.</b>|$|E
5|$|A fierce {{defense was}} {{launched}} from <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls,</b> even as Bowie and Travis made unsuccessful attempts {{to negotiate with}} the Mexican army. Travis repeatedly dispatched couriers with pleas for reinforcements. Although Santa Anna refused to consider a proposed conditional surrender, he extended an offer of amnesty for all Tejanos inside the fortress to walk away unharmed. Most Tejanos evacuated from the fortress about February 25, either as part of the amnesty, or as a part of Juan Seguín's company of courier scouts on their last run.|$|E
5|$|Cartilaginous fish (sharks and rays) {{have a more}} {{advanced}} immune system. They have three specialized organs that are unique to Chondrichthyes; the epigonal organs (lymphoid tissue similar to mammalian bone) that surround the gonads, the Leydig's organ <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> of their esophagus, and a spiral valve in their intestine. These organs house typical immune cells (granulocytes, lymphocytes and plasma cells). They also possess an identifiable thymus and a well-developed spleen (their most important immune organ) where various lymphocytes, plasma cells and macrophages develop and are stored.|$|E

5|$|During a {{party for}} the orphanage's opening, Laura and Simón argue, and Simón hides from her. While looking for him, she {{encounters}} a child wearing a sack mask who shoves her into a bathroom and locks her inside. When Laura escapes, she realizes that Simón is missing and is unable to find him. That night Laura hears several loud crashes <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> of the orphanage. Police psychologist Pilar (Mabel Rivera) suggests to Laura and Carlos that Benigna may have abducted Simón.|$|E
5|$|From 2000 {{excavations}} {{carried out}} by University College London and the Moroccan Institut National des Sciences de l'Archéologie et du Patrimoine {{under the direction of}} Elizabeth Fentress, Gaetano Palumbo and Hassan Limane revealed what should probably be interpreted as the headquarters of Idris I just below the walls of the Roman town {{to the west of the}} ancient city centre. Excavations <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> also revealed a section of the early medieval town. Today, many artefacts found at Volubilis can be seen on display in the Rabat Archaeological Museum.|$|E
5|$|In 16th century England, Henry VIII began {{building}} Device Forts between 1539 and 1540 as artillery fortresses {{to counter the}} threat of invasion from France and Spain. They were built by the state at strategic points for the first powerful cannon batteries, such as Deal Castle, which was perfectly symmetrical, with a low, circular keep at its centre. Over 200 cannon and gun ports were set <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls,</b> and the fort was essentially a firing platform, with a shape that allowed many lines of fire; its low curved bastions were designed to deflect cannonballs.|$|E

5|$|Other Roman remains include part of {{the town}} walls and the {{foundations}} of a town house near the county hall. Modern building works <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> have unearthed Roman finds; in 1936 a cache of 22,000 3rd-century Roman coins was discovered in South Street. Other Roman finds include silver and copper coins known as Dorn pennies, a gold ring, a bronze figure of the Roman god Mercury and large areas of tessellated pavement.|$|E
5|$|The palace was {{originally}} {{surrounded by a}} medieval deer park. When the walls were built, streams were diverted to form the moat as a reservoir. In the 1820s, the grounds <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> were planted and laid out as pleasure grounds by Bishop George Henry Law, who created a reflecting pond near the springs. Parts of the buildings are still used as a residence by the current bishop, however much of the palace is now used for public functions and as a tourist attraction.|$|E
5|$|According to chapter 9 of the Prose Edda book Gylfaginning, {{the three}} {{brothers}} Vili, Vé, and Odin, are {{the creators of}} the first man and woman. The brothers were once walking along a beach and found two trees there. They took the wood and from it created the first human beings; Ask and Embla. One of the three gave them the breath of life, the second gave them movement and intelligence, and the third gave them shape, speech, hearing and sight. Further, the three gods gave them clothing and names. Ask and Embla go {{on to become the}} progenitors of all humanity and were given a home <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> of Midgard.|$|E

5|$|After {{giving the}} {{impression}} that he wished to negotiate, Ivan Alexander, reinforced by Mongol cavalry, overwhelmed the smaller but better organized Byzantine army in the Battle of Rusokastro. The contested cities surrendered to Ivan Alexander, while Andronikos III sought refuge <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> of Rusokastro. The war ended with Ivan Alexander meeting Andronikos and agreeing a peace based on the status quo. To seal the alliance, he betrothed his eldest son, Michael Asen IV, to Andronikos's daughter Maria (Eirene), the marriage eventually taking place in 1339. The Bulgarian emperor was now free to turn his attentions to Belaur, {{but it was not until}} 1336 or 1337 that the rebellion in the northwest was put down.|$|E
5|$|Al-Mu'tadid {{died at the}} Hasani palace on 5 April 902, at the age {{of either}} 40 or 47. There were rumours that he had been poisoned, but {{it is more likely that}} the rigours of his campaigns, coupled with his dissolute life, {{severely}} weakened his health. During his final illness, he refused to follow the advice of his physicians, and even kicked one of them to death. He left behind him four sons and several daughters. Al-Mu'tadid was the first Abbasid caliph to be buried <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> of Baghdad. Like his sons after him, he was buried in the former Tahirid palace in the western part of the city, which was now used by the caliphs as a secondary residence.|$|E
5|$|During the 5th century, Canterbury {{went into}} decline and its Roman {{institutions}} and buildings crumbled, although {{the city walls}} survived. In 597, Augustine was sent to Kent by Pope Gregory I to convert the local population to Christianity. Augustine established Canterbury Cathedral within the city, possibly because the walled site gave them additional protection or because it was symbolically important as a former Roman city. Canterbury, now called Cantwaraburh, prospered and its population and trade increased. Much of the land <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> had become water meadows and farmland, and an palisade may have built around the cathedral and its precinct to form a secure inner stronghold.|$|E

5|$|Gordon's {{arguments}} are valid {{for the second}} phase (1879–84) when every stone laid required a skilled stonemason. However, Holland's views are valid for the first phase (1848–54) because much of its construction only required unskilled manual labor, assisted only by a steam engine to lift the stones because many weighed several tons each. Only {{a small number of}} stones used in the first phase required a skilled stonemason, the marble blocks on the outer surface of the monument (their inner surfaces were left very rough) and those gneiss stones that form the rough inner walls of the monument (all other surfaces of those inner stones <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> were left jagged). The vast majority of all gneiss stones laid during the first phase, those between the outer and inner surfaces of the walls, from very large to very small jagged stones, form a pile of rubble held together by a large amount of mortar. The top surface of this rubble can be seen below at Walls in an 1880 drawing made just before the polished/rough marble and granite stones used in the second phase were laid atop it. The original foundation below the walls was made of layered gneiss rubble, but without the massive stones used <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls.</b> Most of the gneiss stones used during the first phase were obtained from quarries in the Potomac Valley. Only the marble stones of the first and second phases came from Maryland quarries north of Baltimore.|$|E
5|$|In 431 BC, while peace {{already was}} precarious, ArchidamusII, Sparta's king, sent a new {{delegation}} to Athens, {{demanding that the}} Athenians submit to Sparta's demands. This deputation {{was not allowed to}} enter Athens, as Pericles had already passed a resolution according to which no Spartan deputation would be welcomed if the Spartans had previously initiated any hostile military actions. The Spartan army was at this time gathered at Corinth, and, citing this as a hostile action, the Athenians refused to admit their emissaries. With his last attempt at negotiation thus declined, Archidamus invaded Attica, but found no Athenians there; Pericles, aware that Sparta's strategy would be to invade and ravage Athenian territory, had previously arranged to evacuate the entire population of the region to <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> of Athens.|$|E
5|$|Launceston Castle {{is located}} in the town of Launceston, Cornwall, England. It was {{probably}} built by Robert the Count of Mortain after 1068, and initially comprised an earthwork and timber castle with a large motte in one corner. Launceston Castle formed the administrative centre of the new earldom of Cornwall, with a large community packed <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> of its bailey. It was rebuilt in stone in the 12th century and then substantially redeveloped by Richard of Cornwall after 1227, including a high tower to enable visitors to view his surrounding lands. When Richard's son, Edmund, inherited the castle, he moved the earldom's administration to Lostwithiel, triggering the castle's decline. By 1337, the castle was increasingly ruinous and used primarily as a gaol and to host judicial assizes.|$|E

5|$|A stuccoed brick {{fence with}} cast iron gates and an iron Star of David enclose the cemetery. <b>Within</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls,</b> {{there are two}} main {{pathways}} which meet {{in the center of the}} cemetery at a circular decorative piece including a fountain. The oldest graves are in the northern half of the cemetery while newer graves were added progressively south. Many grave sites are adorned with well-maintained Victorian era funerary art, which gives the cemetery its historic significance. Among the monuments include the grave enclosure of the Winner family, which includes a bronze bust of Mark Winner, and two marble angels at the entrance of the plot. Other examples include the grave of David L. Rosenbaum, topped with marble shoes and stockings, the grave of Julius Elson, marked by a carved marble fainting couch, and a memorial to Mattimore Meyer, featuring a marble angel.|$|E
5|$|Meera (Ayesha Takia), {{a simple}} Rajasthani Hindu woman, has {{everything}} {{in her life}} in accordance with customs and traditions: her formative years, her recent marriage into a traditional Rajasthani family and her daily chores <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> of her haveli. Coincidentally, her husband, Shankar, is in Saudi Arabia, his new workplace. Meera finds it tough without her husband but they manage to stay in touch. Shankar regularly sends his wages home to support his family that includes his father, Randhir Singh (Girish Karnad), mother, Gowri Singh (Prateeksha Lonkar), his paternal grandmother (Uttara Baokar) and Meera. One day, Meera does not find the remittance from Shankar. Time passes and when there are neither any further remittances nor any correspondence from her husband, Meera gets worried. When frantic inquiries are made, she is devastated to know that Shankar {{was killed in a}} freak accident that was allegedly caused by his Muslim roommate.|$|E
5|$|On July 20, 1944, Stauffenberg and his {{adjutant}} Lieutenant Haeften {{return to}} Wolf's Lair. To Stauffenberg's dismay, he discovers {{only after the}} timer has been activated that, due to the warm weather, the conference {{is being held in}} an open-window summer barrack, whereas the plotters had intended to detonate the bomb <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> of the bunker for maximum damage. While his adjutant waits with the car, Stauffenberg places the briefcase with the bomb armed at the meeting as close to Hitler as possible. Stauffenberg then leaves the barrack, returning to the car. However, one of the officers at the meeting moves the bomb behind a table leg, which will inadvertently protect Hitler from most of the blast. When the bomb explodes, Stauffenberg is certain that Hitler is dead and flees Wolf's Lair. Before shutting down communications, Fellgiebel calls Mertz about the explosion but cannot clearly convey whether or not Hitler is dead.|$|E
