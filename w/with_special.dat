40|$|This study {{examined}} whether {{a special education}} communication disorder for kindergarten students was dependent on race/ethnicity, native language spoken, socioeconomic status, and EL status using a dataset of 3, 642 students across 2010, 2012, and 2014 in a large district in Oregon. Using a logistic regression methodology, this study explored (a) the relationship between identification <b>with</b> a <b>special</b> education communication disorder by race/ethnicity, (b) the relationship between identification <b>with</b> a <b>special</b> education communication disorder by native language, (c) the relationship between identification <b>with</b> a <b>special</b> education communication disorder by socioeconomic status (based on free and reduced lunch status), and (d) the relationship between identification <b>with</b> a <b>special</b> education communication disorder by EL status. The {{results from this study}} suggest that the odds of students being classified <b>with</b> a <b>special</b> education communication disorder are nearly double for those who receive free and reduced lunch. Other demographic variables did not significantly predict the likelihood of remediation. The findings from this study highlight the complexity of the story as to why students are identified <b>with</b> a <b>special</b> education communication disorder. This study can be used to inform future research on the connection between poverty and placement in a special education communication disorder...|$|R
