5|$|American's service {{peaked in}} 1992 with 265 daily departures, after which flights were {{gradually}} scaled back until the hub eventually closed in 1995. American cited {{the aftermath of}} the early 1990s recession and the lack of local passengers as reasons for the closure. As American scaled down its operations, it subleased its gates to other carriers, largely in order to cover the debt used to construct the hub facilities, <b>which</b> <b>American</b> had guaranteed. Southwest Airlines quickly filled the void by seizing 54% of the Nashville market and making it a focus city, with American remaining as the second-largest carrier at Nashville, followed by Delta Air Lines.|$|E

5|$|Because A Trip to the Moon {{preceded the}} {{development}} of narrative film editing by filmmakers such as Edwin S. Porter and D. W. Griffith, it does not use the cinematic vocabulary to <b>which</b> <b>American</b> and European audiences later became accustomed, a vocabulary built on the purposeful use of techniques such as varied camera angles, intercutting, juxtapositions of shots, and other filmic ideas. Rather, each camera setup in Méliès's film is designed as a distinct dramatic scene uninterrupted by visible editing, an approach fitting the theatrical style in which the film was designed. Similarly, film scholars have noted that the most famous moment in A Trip to the Moon plays with temporal continuity by showing an event twice: first the capsule is shown suddenly appearing {{in the eye of}} an anthropomorphic moon; then, in a much closer shot, the landing occurs very differently, and much more realistically, with the capsule actually plummeting into believable lunar terrain. This kind of nonlinear storytelling—in which time and space are treated as repeatable and flexible rather than linear and causal—is highly unconventional by the standards of Griffith and his followers; before {{the development of}} continuity editing, however, other filmmakers performed similar experiments with time. (Porter, for instance, used temporal discontinuity and repetition extensively in his 1903 film Life of an American Fireman.) Later in the twentieth century, with sports television's development of the instant replay, temporal repetition again became a familiar device to screen audiences.|$|E

25|$|Blackface minstrelsy was {{the first}} {{theatrical}} form that was distinctly American.

On the one hand, it had strong racist aspects; on the other, it afforded white Americans a singular and broad awareness of what some whites considered significant aspects of black culture in America.|$|E
25|$|Although the Supreme Court {{permitted}} strikebreakers to {{be hired}} under the Mackay doctrine, replacement workers remained largely unused by employers from the mid-1930s to the early 1970s. Scholars attribute this to a gentlemen's agreement or social contract under <b>which</b> <b>American</b> employers and unions both agreed to seek labor peace. The increased use of strikebreakers {{began in the late}} 1960s, and trended significantly upward in the early 1970. President Ronald Reagan's replacement of striking air traffic controllers in 1981 reinforced the trend, perhaps sundering the social contract permanently.|$|E
25|$|As a result, {{a series}} of quick fixes {{followed}} to ensure that American forces would not be caught completely off guard {{in the event of}} war. More important was the sensitivity with <b>which</b> <b>American</b> officials now treated the nervousness of their European counterparts; the Americans now became more willing to take steps to boost morale in Europe and ease the now-widespread anxieties there. The coup and the Berlin Blockade that June made clear that constant reassurance was needed to bind the Europeans to the U.S. system; hence, the remobilization of U.S. armed forces began.|$|E

Former European Indoor champion Gregory Sedoc was eliminated in the second of the three semis while Petr Svoboda won the last semi-final; all the favourites progressed to the final.|$|E
25|$|On the whole, the {{development}} of poetry in the American colonies mirrors {{the development}} of the colonies themselves. The early poetry is dominated by the need to preserve the integrity of the Puritan ideals that created the settlement in the first place. As the colonists grew in confidence, the poetry they wrote increasingly reflected their drive towards independence. This shift in subject matter was not reflected in the mode of writing which tended to be conservative, to say the least. This {{can be seen as a}} product of the physical remove at <b>which</b> <b>American</b> poets operated from the center of English-language poetic developments in London.|$|E

Politics took center stage in the medal ceremony for the men's 200 meter dash, where Tommie Smith and John Carlos made a protest gesture on the podium against the segregation in the United States; their political act was condemned within the Olympic Movement, but was praised in the Black Power movement.|$|E
