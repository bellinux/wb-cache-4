As to the uniform, I agree <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> but <b>on</b> <b>that</b> head I should not be particular. I can hardly fancy any of the scouts buttoned tightly up with stiff collars; but as, after all, although {{they are to be}} enlisted, they will be attached to the corps, rather than be regular members of it, I do not think I need insist upon the uniform." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I cannot agree <b>with</b> <b>you</b> at all <b>on</b> <b>that</b> head,' said Mr. Pole. 'We {{certainly}} {{are not very}} popular at this moment, and I feel convinced that a connection with a person who attracts so much notice as Cadurcis unfortunately does, and whose opinions on morals and religion must be so offensive to {{the vast majority of}} the English public, must ultimately prove anything but advantageous to our party.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Hearken {{before you}} answer," [...] I continued. [...] "When first I spoke <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> bloody day at Hastings {{and you had}} but just come to womanhood, I loved you and swore to myself that I would die to save you. I saved you and we kissed and were parted. Afterwards I tried to put you out of my heart, knowing that you were set far above me and no meat for such as I, though still for your sake I wooed no other woman in marriage. The years went by and fortune brought us {{together}} again, and lo! the old love was stronger than before. I know that I am not worthy {{of you who are}} so high and good and pure. Still----" [...] and I stopped, lacking words.|$|E
6000|$|... "Such {{were your}} chances against me; and {{such was the}} manner in which you misused them. On my side, I had indefatigable patience; {{personal}} advantages equal, with the exception of birth and age, to yours: long-established influence; freedom to be familiar; and more than all, that stealthy, unflagging strength of purpose which only springs from the desire of revenge. I first thoroughly tested your character, and discovered on what points it was necessary for me to be on my guard against you, when you took shelter under my roof from the storm. If your father had been <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> night, there were moments, while the tempest was wrought to its full fury, when, if my voice could have called the thunder down on the house to crush it and every one in it to atoms, I would have spoken the word, and ended the strife for all of us. The wind, the hail, and the lightning maddened my thoughts of your father and you--I was nearly letting you see it, when that flash came between us as we parted at my door.|$|E
6000|$|... "Take her," [...] he said, [...] "and deal {{honestly}} and kindly by her. The girl has {{that in her}} which should make her welcome, in any man's house, and I should be loth to hear she ever came to harm. And now I have settled <b>with</b> <b>you</b> all, <b>on</b> terms <b>that</b> I hope you will not find hard, but, on the contrary, just and manly. I have only another question to ask, and that is of the Captain; do you choose to profit by my teams in going into the settlements, or not?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, Willie, I--I {{know him}} a--at least I have met <b>with</b> him often. <b>You</b> see I was better off once, {{and used to}} mingle with--but I need not trouble <b>you</b> <b>with</b> <b>that.</b> <b>On</b> the {{strength}} of our former acquaintance, I thought I would write and ask him to get you a situation in an office, and I have got a letter from him, just before you came down to breakfast, saying that he will do what he can, and bidding me send you to him between eleven and twelve to-morrow." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “‘Tis nothing, I say, {{but a small}} {{matter of}} a squall that will soon blow over,” {{continued}} Benjamin. “ To you that has such a length of keel, it must be all the same as nothing; thof, seeing that I am little short in my lower timbers, they’ve triced my heels up {{in such a way}} as to give me a bit of a cant. But what cares I, Master Bump-ho, if the ship strains a little at her anchor? it’s only for a dog-watch, and dam’me but she’ll sail <b>with</b> <b>you</b> then <b>on</b> <b>that</b> cruise after them said beaver. I'm not much used to small arms, seeing that I was stationed at the ammunition- boxes, being summat too low-rigged to see over the ham- mock-cloths; but I can carry the game, dye see, and mayhap make out to lend a hand with the traps; and if- so-be you’re any way so handy with them as ye be with your boat-hook, ‘twill be but a short cruise after all, I've squared the yards with Squire Dickens this morning, and I shall send him word that he needn’t bear my name on the books again till such time as the cruise is over.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'But it is true, and I do not in {{the least}} quarrel <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> account. He has {{preferred}} you to me, and as far as I am concerned there is an end of it. You are a girl, whereas I am a woman,--and he likes your youth. I have undergone the cruel roughness of the world, which has not as yet touched you; and therefore you are softer to the touch. I do not know that you are very superior in other attractions; but that has sufficed, and you are the victor. I am strong enough to acknowledge that I have nothing to forgive in you;--and am weak enough to forgive all his treachery.' Hetta was now holding the woman by the hand, and was weeping, she knew not why. 'I am so glad to have seen you,' continued Mrs Hurtle, 'so that I may know what his wife was like. In a few days I shall return to the States, and then neither of you will ever be troubled further by Winifred Hurtle. Tell him that if he will come and see me once before I go, I will not be more unkind to him than I can help.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She taxed me {{with the}} offence at once, and my {{confusion}} may be guessed. The purity of her life, the formality of her notions, her ignorance of the world--every thing was against me. The matter itself I could not deny, and vain was every endeavour to soften it. She was previously disposed, I believe, to doubt the morality of my conduct in general, and was moreover discontented with the very little attention, the very little portion of my time that I had bestowed on her, in my present visit. In short, it ended in a total breach. By one measure I might have saved myself. In the height of her morality, good woman! she offered to forgive the past, if I would marry Eliza. That could not be--and I was formally dismissed from her favour and her house. The night following this affair--I was to go the next morning--was spent by me in deliberating on what my future conduct should be. The struggle was great--but it ended too soon. My affection for Marianne, my thorough conviction of her attachment to me--it was all insufficient to outweigh that dread of poverty, or {{get the better of}} those false ideas of the necessity of riches, which I was naturally inclined to feel, and expensive society had increased. I had reason to believe myself secure of my present wife, if I chose to address her, and I persuaded myself to think that nothing else in common prudence remained for me to do. A heavy scene however awaited me, before I could leave Devonshire;--I was engaged to dine <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> very day; some apology was therefore necessary for my breaking this engagement. But whether I should write this apology, or deliver it in person, was a point of long debate. To see Marianne, I felt, would be dreadful, and I even doubted whether I could see her again, and keep to my resolution. In that point, however, I undervalued my own magnanimity, as the event declared; for I went, I saw her, and saw her miserable, and left her miserable--and left her hoping never to see her again." ...|$|E
6000|$|I respond {{without delay}} to {{the blessing of}} your letter of the 6th--which gives me so general a good {{impression}} of you all that I must somehow celebrate it. I {{like to think of}} your tranquil--if the word be the least applicable!--Chocorua summer; and as the time of year comes round again of my sole poor visit there (my mere fortnight from September 1st 1904), the yearning but baffled thought of being <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> woodland scene and at the same season once more tugs at my sensibilities and is almost too much for me. I have the sense of my then leaving it all unsated, after a beggarly snatch only, and of how I might have done with so much more of it. But I shall pretty evidently have to do with what I got. The very smell and sentiment of the American summer's end there and of Alice's beautiful [...] "rustic" [...] hospitality of overflowing milk and honey, to say nothing of squash pie and ice-cream in heroic proportions, all mingle for me with the assault of forest and lake and of those delicious orchardy, yet rocky vaguenesses and Arcadian [...] "nowheres," [...] which are the note of what is sweetest and most attaching in the dear old American, or particularly New England, scenery. It comes back to me as with such a magnificent beckoning looseness--in relieving contrast to the consummate tightness (a part, too, oddly, of the very wealth of effect) du pays d'ici. It isn't however, luckily, that I have really turned [...] "agin" [...] my landscape portion here, for never so much as this summer, e.g., have I felt the immensely noble, the truly aristocratic, beauty of this splendid county of Sussex, especially as the winged car of offence has monstrously unfolded it to me. This afternoon an amiable neighbour, Mrs. Richard Hennessy, motored me over to Hurstmonceux Castle, which, in spite of its being but about ten miles [...] "back of" [...] Hastings, and not more than twenty from here, I had never yet seen. It's a prodigious romantic ruin, in an adorable old ruined park; but the splendour of the views and horizons, and of the rich composition and perpetual picture and inexhaustible detail of the country, had never more come home to me. I don't do such things, however, every day, thank goodness, and am having the very quietest summer, I think, that has melted away for me (how they do melt!) since I came to live here. I miss the tie of consanguinity--that I have so often felt!--and now (especially since your letter, for you mention his other plans) I find myself calling on the hoped-for Bill in vain. We lately have had (it broke but yesterday) a splendid heated term--very highly heated--following on a wholly detestable June and July and having lasted without a lapse the whole month up to now--which has been admirable and enjoyable and of a renewed consecration to this dear little old garden. I hope it hasn't broken for good, as complications, of sorts, loom for me next month--but the high possibility is that we shall still have earned, and have suffered for in advance, a fine August-end and September. My window is open wide even now--but to the blustering, softly-storming, south-windy midnight. And through thick and thin I have been very quietly and successfully working. It all pans out, I think, in a very promising way, but it is too [...] "important" [...] for me to chatter about save on the proved, or proveable, basis that now seems rather largely to await it. And I grow, I think, small step by small step, physically easier and easier, and seem to know, pretty steadily, more and more where I am.... I have been following you and Alice in imagination to the kind and beautiful Intervale hospitality--my charming taste of which has remained with me ever so gratefully and uneffacedly, please tell the Merrimans when you have another chance. You tell me that Alice and Harry lift all practical burdens from your genius--than which they surely couldn't have a nobler or a more inspiring task;--but what a fate and a fortune yours too--to have an Alice reinforced by a Harry, and a Harry multiplied by an Alice! L'un vaut l'autre--as they appear to me in the wondrous harmony. You don't mention Harry's getting to you at all--but my mind recoils with horror from the thought that he is not in these days getting somewhere. It's a blow to me to learn that Bill is again to hibernate in Boston--but softened by what you so delightfully tell me of your portrait and of the nature and degree of his progress. If he can do much and get on so there, why right he is of course to stay--and most interesting is it to learn that he can do so much; I wish I could see something--and can't your portrait be photographed? But I lately wrote to him appealingly; and he will explain to me all things. Admirable your evocation of the brave and brown and beautiful Peg--of whom I wish I weren't so howlingly deprived. But please tell her I drench her with her old uncle's proudest and fondest affection. I hang tenderly over Aleck--while he, poor boy, hangs so toughly over God knows what--and fervently do I pray for him. And you and Alice I embrace.|$|E
60|$|But {{the blow}} {{at the moment}} of the stroke is very galling. I confess that I have {{occasionally}} all but broken down beneath it. But when it is thought of afterward it admits of full excuse. No effort that a man can make is better than a true effort at independence. But this insolence is a false effort, it will be said. It should rather be called a false accompaniment to a life- long true effort. The man probably is not dishonest, does not desire to shirk any service which is due from him, is not even inclined to insolence. Accept his first declaration of equality for that which it is intended to represent, and the man afterward will be found obliging and communicative. If occasion offer he will sit down in the room <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> and will talk <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>on</b> any subject <b>that</b> he may choose; but having once ascertained that you show no resentment for this assertion of equality, he will do pretty nearly all that is asked. He will at any rate do as much in that way as an Englishman. I say thus much on this subject now especially, because I was quite as much struck by the feeling in Canada as I was within the States.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I don't quite agree <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> Mrs Loper, <b>on</b> <b>that</b> point. To my mind it {{does not}} so much depend on the family, as on the notions, and the {{capacity}} to manage, in the head of the family. I remember one family just now, whose head was cut off suddenly, I may say in the prime of life. A hundred and fifty a year or thereabouts was the income the widow had to count on, and she was left with five little ones to rear. She trained them well, gave them good educations, made most of their garments with her own hands when they were little, and sent one of her boys to college, yet was noted for the amount of time she spent in visiting the poor, the sick, and the afflicted, for whom she had always a little to spare out of her limited income. Now, if wealth is to be measured by results, I think we may say that that poor lady was rich. She was deeply mourned by a large circle of poor people when she was taken home to the better land. Her small means, having been judiciously invested by a brother, increased a little towards the close of life, but she never was what the world esteems rich." ...|$|R

6000|$|Hideous as {{is really}} the time that has elapsed since I last held any {{communication}} <b>with</b> <b>you</b> (<b>on</b> <b>that</b> torrid July 3d, p.m., in Kirkland St.--I won't name the year!) it has seemed to me extraordinarily brief and has in fact passed like a flash! Measured by the calendar it's incredible--measured by my sense {{of the way the}} months whizz by (more and more like the telegraph-posts at the window of the train,) it has been a simple good [...] "run" [...] from the eve of my leaving America to the present moment. I came straight back here--to a great monotony and regularity and tranquillity of life (on the whole,) and haven't had really (and shouldn't have, didn't I begin to count!) any of the conscious desolation of having drifted away from you. However, beginning to count makes it another and rather horrible matter--or would make it so if you and I ever counted (in the dreary way of [...] "times" [...] of writing,) or ever had, or ever will. At the same time I yearn to hear from you, and it may increase my chance of that boon if I tell you with all urgency how much I do. On that side, though you, through your habitual magnanimity, won't [...] "mind" [...] my long silence unduly, I mind it myself, with this very first word of my breaking it. Because I'm talking with you now again, and that brings back so many, too many things; and to do so seems the pleasantest and dearest and most natural thing in the world. I leave this place tomorrow for Paris--that is sleep at Dover--but {{an hour and a half}} hence--and go farther the next day; which is the first time I've stirred (except for an occasional week in London) since I last stirred out of sight of you. I've been for a long time under the promise of going over to see William's Bill, who is working tooth and nail, to every appearance, at Julian's studio-- ...If I can I shall dash down to Italy--to Florence and Venice--for a short spell before restoration--to this domicile--the last time, I daresay, that I shall ever brave the distinctly enfeebled spell (as I last felt it to be--seven years ago) of those places; so utterly the prey of the Barbarian now that if you still ever yearn for them take an easy comfort and thank your stars that you knew them in the less blighted and dishonoured time. It is very singular to me, living here (in this comparatively old-world corner which has nothing else but its own little immemorial blots and vulgarisms--besides all its great merits) to find myself plunged into the strain of the rankest and most promiscuous actuality as soon as, crossing to the Continent, I direct myself to the shrines of a superior antiquity. One is so out of the stream here that one almost wholly forgets it--and then it is incongruously the most sacred pilgrimages that most vociferously remind one--because (to put it as gracefully as possible) most cosmopolitanly. [...] "Left to myself" [...] I really think I should scarce ever budge from here again--unless to go back to the U.S., which, honestly, I should like almost as much as I should (in some connections--the [...] "travelling" [...] above all) dread it. But the dread wouldn't be the same dread of the American-Anglican and German Italy. These will strike you as cheerful sentiments for the eve of a pleasure-trip abroad, and I shall feel better when I've started; but even so the travel-impulse (which I've had almost no opportunity in my life really to gratify) is extinct as from inanition (and personal antiquity!) and above all, more and more, the only way I care to travel is by reading. To stay at home and read is more and more my ideal--and it's one that you have beautifully realized. I think it was the sense of all that it has so admirably done for you that confirmed me while I was with you in my high estimation of it. Great, every way, dear Grace, and all-exemplary, I thought the dignity and coherency and benignity of your life--long after beholding it as it has taken me (by the tiresome calendar again!) to make you this declaration. I at any rate have the greatest satisfaction in the thought--the fireside vision--of your still and always nobly leading it. I don't know, and how should I? much about you in detail--but I think I have a kind of instinct of how the side-brush of the things that I do get in a general way a reverberation of touches and affects you, and as in one way or another there seems to have been plenty of the stress and strain and pain of life on the circumference (and even some of it at the centre, as it were) of your circle, I've not been without feeling (and responding to,) I boldly say, some of your vibrations. I hope at least the most acute of them have proceeded from causes presenting for you--well, what shall I say?--an interest!! Even the most worrying businesses often have one--but there are sides of them that we could discover in talk over the fire but that I don't appeal to you lucidly to portray to me. Besides, I can imagine them exquisitely--as well as where they fail of that beguilement, and believe me, therefore, I am living with you, as I write, quite as much as if I made out--as I used to--by your pharos-looking lamplight through your ample and lucid window-pane, that you were sitting [...] "in," [...] as they say here, and were thereupon planning an immediate invasion. I have given intense ear to every breath of indication about Charles and his condition, and in particular to the appearance that, so far as I understand, he has been presiding and dignifying, as he alone remains to have done, the Longfellow centenary--a symptom, as it has seemed to me, of very handsome vitality....|$|E
