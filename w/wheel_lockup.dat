40|$|Abstract. The {{longitudinal}} braking {{dynamics of}} a two-wheel vehicle model on an incline are considered using techniques from nonlinear dynamics. The model is planar and incorporates the coupled dynamics of two independently braked wheels and the vehicle body, and {{takes into account}} the slip dynamics of each wheel. By using the wheel slip values and the vehicle speed as dynamic states, it is shown that the qualitative behavior of the system can be completely captured by studying a relatively simple phase plane problem described in terms of the slip values. A systematic bifurcation analysis is carried out in which the brake torques of the two wheels are varied, and it is shown how the system transitions from stable braking to the possibility of lockup in one or both <b>wheels,</b> to guaranteed <b>lockup</b> in both <b>wheels.</b> In this manner a quite complete picture of the dynamic behavior is obtained {{as a function of the}} two brake torques, including regions with multiple possible steady braking outcomes, depending on the initial conditions. This analysis provides new insights into the dynamics of vehicle braking, and it provides a correction to the standard result for the critical values of the brake torques at which the <b>wheels</b> undergo <b>lockup.</b> This approach may also prove useful for evaluating brake proportioning schedules, or for investigating anti-lock braking systems and other methods of traction control...|$|R

50|$|Slidepad {{was started}} by Riley and Ouellet while {{students}} at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo. Ouellet received inspiration for the product after he crashed his bicycle when applying {{too much pressure on}} his front brakes, resulting in front <b>wheel</b> <b>lockup.</b> In 2009, Riley and Ouellet entered their initial design in Cal Poly’s Business Plan competition and won 1st place. In 2013 Alan Nordin, former president of Fallbrook Technologies' bicycle division, joined the company as an executive advisor.|$|E
50|$|Slidepad is an Intelligent Brake Distribution (IBD) technology, {{aimed at}} making braking easier for novice or casual cyclists, {{integrates}} into V-brake systems to provide single-lever braking. It modulates the front brake force in real time, {{based on the}} road surface and rider weight position, and avoids front <b>wheel</b> <b>lockup</b> accidents when applying the front brake. It was designed to prevent riders from flipping over their handlebars when applying the front brake. Once the brake pads {{make contact with the}} rear wheel, the Slidepad slides forward, which pulls a cable that is connected to the front brakes. Similar to the anti-lock brake system in cars, the mechanism prevents the front wheel from locking, no matter how hard the brake is pressed or how slippery the road conditions are.|$|E
5000|$|This type of clutch is {{designed}} to partially disengage or [...] "slip" [...] when the rear wheel tries to drive the engine faster than it would run under its own power. The engine braking forces in conventional clutches will normally be transmitted back along the drive chain causing the rear wheel to hop, chatter or lose traction. This is especially noted on larger displacement four-stroke engines, which have greater engine braking than their two-stroke or smaller displacement counterparts. Slipper clutches eliminate this extra loading on the rear suspension giving riders a more predictable ride and {{minimize the risk of}} over-revving the engine during downshifts. Slipper clutches can also prevent a catastrophic rear <b>wheel</b> <b>lockup</b> in case of engine seizure. Generally, the amount of force needed to disengage the clutch is adjustable to suit the application.|$|E
50|$|Typically with {{motorcycles}} and {{in motor}} sport, the clutch {{is often used}} to facilitate the use of resistance from the engine spinning at high speeds to decelerate the vehicle more quickly, often accompanied with normal braking. This can be achieved by placing the vehicle in a gear that would ordinarily be too low for the current speed and momentum of the vehicle and by partly engaging the clutch. When this happens momentum energy from the inertia of the vehicle is taken away to spin the engine {{as close as possible to}} its maximum capability. As the vehicle is decelerating the clutch can be further released to transfer more energy to keep the engine spinning as quickly as possible. This method causes excessive clutch wear however, and it could cause severe engine damage or <b>wheel</b> <b>lockup</b> if the clutch were released suddenly.|$|E

5000|$|The self-assist {{mechanism}} {{affects the}} water pump {{and the amount}} of fade. For example, the Ausco Lambert and Murphy brakes have self-assist roughly proportional to pad friction, so total braking is reduced as roughly the square of the loss in friction. Many other self-assist designs, such as band brakes and many common drum brakes, have exponential self-assist, described by , where [...] is the natural logarithm base, [...] is the coefficient of friction between shoes and drum, and [...] is the angle of engagement between shoes and drum. A small change in friction causes an exponential change in self assist. In many common brakes, a slight increase in friction can lead to <b>wheel</b> <b>lockup</b> with even light application. For example, on damp mornings, drum brakes can lock on first application, skidding to a stop even after the brake pedal has been released. Conversely, a slight decrease in friction can lead to severe brake fade.|$|E

A discriminative hierarchical evolutionary fuzzy system learns and identifies on-the-fly the road surface characteristics, from a set of built-in road surface information modules, in a closed-loop adaptive configuration.

40|$|Abstract—Fuzzy {{controllers}} {{are potential}} {{candidates for the}} control of nonlinear, time variant and also complicated systems.

In this paper, an intelligent fuzzy ABS controller is designed to adjust slipping performance for variety of roads. There are tow major sections in the proposing control system. First section consists of tow Fuzzy-Logic Controllers (FLC) providing optimal brake torque for both front and rear wheels.

40|$|This work {{investigates the}} longitudinal, {{nonlinear}} braking dynamics of single- and two-wheel ground vehicle models. A natural choice of dynamic {{states would be}} the forward vehicle speed and the absolute rotational rate of the wheels.

By doing so, the qualitative dynamic behaviors of the single- and two-wheel systems are captured in a relatively simple geometric manner. Bifurcation analyses are carried out {{in terms of the}} brake torques, which show how the systems transition from stable braking, to the possibility of lockup in one or both wheels, to guaranteed lockup in both wheels, depending on the initial conditions. An interesting finding of this study is a correction to the textbook result for the critical brake torques corresponding to <b>wheel</b> <b>lockup.</b> It is shown that the commonly accepted threshold is valid only when the vehicle-to-wheel inertia ratio is large, which is typically the case in many road vehicles.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} and understand the dynamics of motor vehicles un-der straight ahead braking and accelerating condi-tions. Two vehicle braking models are considered— a quarter-car, or single wheel model, and a half-car, or two wheel model—and a nonlinear analysis is un-dertaken for each. A brief survey of the main char-acteristics and features of a single wheel acceleration model is also conducted. The equations of motion describing the single wheel model shown in Figure 1 are presented and the need to quantify the available friction force for braking is specified. This motivates an investigation of the tire/road interface and leads to the introduc-tion of force coefficient characteristics µ as a function of longitudinal wheel slip s. The equations of motion are hence cast into a framework which is convenient for a nonlinear dynamic analysis. The forward vehi-cle speed u is customarily chosen as an independent variable for such an investigation. Whereas the an-gular velocity of the wheel ω is typically chosen as the second independent variable for braking anal-ysis [1], this paper utilizes wheel slip in its stead. This results in a single dimensionless function h(s) of longitudinal wheel slip that completely character-izes the nonlinear dynamic behavior of the system. It will be shown that considerable insight is gained from such a description. Criteria for the local sta-bility of finite slip in braking and <b>wheel</b> <b>lockup</b> are outlined and a qualitative vector field description of the braking model is presented and discussed. The main results of the investigation include domains of stable and unstable braking, local stability criteria, and a description of the transition to wheel lock-up as the brake torque is varied. The single wheel model equations of motion can be cast in the form u ̇ = −µ(s) g s ̇ = g u h(s) where g is the acceleration due to gravity and µ(s) is an experimentally derived friction coefficient charac-teristic.

40|$|The {{braking system}} {{is one of}} the major factors {{affecting}} a vehicle’s performance. The future of the automotive industry thrives by the creation of a greener, more efficient and lightweight braking mechanisms. Research on utilizing electromechanical brakes have shown potential due to their superior performance and controllability. The magnetorheological Brake (MRB) is a promising electromechanical brake which can provide variable damping through variation of the MR fluids’ apparent viscosity and yield strength using the applied magnetic field. Fast response time, low power requirement and large dynamic range are among unique features of MRBs making them an ideal candidate for vehicle applications. While some design configurations have been proposed for applying MRBs in the automotive industry, the commercial application has not yet been fully realized mainly due to the existence of their zero-field viscous torque. The focal purpose of this study is to propose and develop a novel real-size vehicle model of the MRB design with absolutely no energy loss in terms of viscous torque generation. The design is achieved using permanent magnets which force the MR fluid volume to shift locations between the brake’s operating modes – ‘on’ and ‘off’ – to allow complete de-coupling. The performance of the proposed design compared with the conventional design is demonstrated on a 2 -disk-type MRB configuration. The Herschel-Bulkley constitutive model is adopted for the MR fluid to derive the mathematical equations governing the systems’ braking torques as a function of the rotational speed, geometric properties, and applied electrical current. The MR fluid selected for the proposed designs is MRF- 132 DG from Lord Corporation. Analytical magnetic circuit analysis of the MRB design has been conducted which allows to approximately derive the relation between the magnetic field intensity and the electric current as a function of number of coil turns and the brake’s geometric variables. The analytical model is then verified using an electromagnetic finite element model developed in open source FEMM software. An equation relating densities of the materials used in the MRB and their corresponding dimensions is also derived to estimate the weight of the proposed MRB. Subsequently, a multidisciplinary design optimization problem has been formulated to identify the optimal brake geometrical parameters to maximize the dynamic range of the MRBs under weight, size and magnetic flux density constraints. The optimization problem has been solved using Genetic Algorithm (GA) followed by the Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) technique implemented in the MATLAB environment to achieve the true global optimal design. It is shown that the proposed MRB design provides better performance specifications under the required design constraints while having zero viscous torque generation making it suitable for application in real commercial vehicles. Finally, a simple dynamic quarter-vehicle model integrated with the optimally designed MRB has been considered to investigate the brake performance in automotive application. A PID control scheme has been designed for optimal wheel slip control over different road surface conditions. The objective is to obtain the highest value possible for the road-friction coefficient. This is possible through regulating and maintaining the slip ratio to a desired value whether driving on dry, wet, snowy or icy roads. The controller is purposed to enhance the overall braking properties of a vehicle through reducing the stopping distance and time, enhancing stability, and avoiding <b>wheel</b> <b>lockup...</b>|$|E
