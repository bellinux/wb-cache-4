25|$|Charlie asks Sarah <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> if Leslie {{went away}} {{and did not}} come back. Nancy becomes angry at him for asking. Sarah is upset by the {{question}} and {{wants to go back}} to the sea. Leslie hits and chokes Charlie for making Sarah cry. Leslie and Sarah decide to go back. Nancy tells them to stay because eventually they will have to come back. Nancy, and to some degree Charlie, offer their help. Leslie accepts their offer.|$|E
25|$|Leslie acts {{most often}} on instinct, like an animal. When birds and jets fly overhead, he runs {{to find an}} escape route. Leslie is very {{protective}} of Sarah. When Charlie hurts Sarah—asking her <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> if Leslie left and never came back—Leslie attacks him. After hitting him, Leslie nearly chokes him until the females intercede. After the incident, Leslie decides that he and Sarah will {{go back into the}} sea, to escape this threat. When Nancy tells him that they will have to come back eventually and offers them help, it is Leslie who accepts this fate.|$|E
25|$|The lizards' {{communication}} is somewhat {{similar to their}} human counterparts. Like Nancy, Sarah is more open to the humans and more interested in their world. She is also emotional, and when Charlie asks her a question that is {{hard for her to}} understand (<b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> if Leslie disappeared), she becomes distraught, leading to a confrontation. Leslie shares Charlie's attitude; he does not trust the humans and regards most everything they say with skepticism. Despite these problems, {{at the end of the}} play, some measure of trust is reached between all of them. Leslie decides that he and Sarah will stay on land when Nancy and Charlie, albeit reluctantly, offer to help them.|$|E
60|$|He {{dropped his}} hands to the counter by habit and {{stood for a moment}} {{regarding}} her awkwardly. <b>What</b> <b>would</b> <b>she</b> <b>do?</b> <b>Would</b> <b>she</b> cut him? She came across the shop to him.|$|R
60|$|With no {{perceptible}} {{movement that}} I was aware of, Mrs. Jones advertised her certitude {{of knowledge of}} <b>what</b> <b>SHE</b> <b>would</b> have <b>done.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> have <b>done</b> {{with the}} {{instruction}} {{if she had}} got it," [...] said the judge, dryly, {{and the young man}} ventured in her behalf: ...|$|R
25|$|Though Sarah is more deferential than Nancy, {{she does}} assert herself to Leslie when an {{experience}} is important. For example, she insists on accompanying Leslie when {{he approaches the}} humans in act II after they have taken their submissive pose. Sarah wants to see everything for herself. Most of the new things she encounters intrigue her: the handshakes; Nancy's breasts; human gestation; and the birds flying above them, among other things. But she is also fearful. The jets frighten her, as does Charlie when he asks her <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> if Leslie went away and never came back. Like Leslie, Sarah does not grasp many human concepts like emotions and nonaquatic animals, though she tries.|$|E
500|$|Casting {{of the new}} {{characters}} for series 1 {{was announced}} on 25 November 2009. Open auditions were held at Theatre Royal Stratford East, followed by recalls until the possible actors were reduced to eight and then four. Yorke {{described it as a}} [...] "painful process" [...] and they had difficulty finding someone to play Zsa Zsa Carter. Emer Kenny was cast in the role whilst writing the second episode. Yorke said [...] "She was so good that we suddenly went, 'It's her! Kenny said, [...] "I'm really thrilled to have been given the opportunity to both write for and act in a show connected with such an iconic drama as EastEnders. Kids these days use their laptops more than their televisions, so it's really exciting {{to be a part of}} a project that's taking drama online and connecting with these viewers." [...] To prepare for the role, Kenny had to disguise her [...] "posh" [...] accent, saying that when the director asked her <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> about her voice, she travelled around the East End to listen to the way people spoke.|$|E
500|$|In {{the general}} election, with lost prestige, a divided party, {{and with her}} {{campaign}} resources partly drained by the primary fight, Romney was behind incumbent Democrat Hart from the beginning. [...] Romney issued position papers and emphasized the themes of dealing with crime and social permissiveness; she also advocated a national healthcare plan and increased attention to environmental damage caused by industry. She never made any personal attacks against Hart. [...] The only woman running for the U.S. Senate that year, she was a tireless campaigner, traveling around the state in a chartered Cessna and making as many as twelve stops a day. [...] Nevertheless, the perception grew {{that she did not}} have any vision for <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> as a senator and was only in the race because she was George Romney's wife. [...] In response, she said at one point, [...] "I'm not a stand-in or a substitute for anyone". Her campaign material continued to just refer to [...] "Lenore". [...] She also was negatively impacted, in both the primary and general election, by fallout from her husband's effort as HUD Secretary to enforce housing integration in Warren, Michigan. Consistently far ahead in polls, Hart staged a low-key campaign with few public appearances; he mostly ignored her and sometimes acted condescendingly towards her in private.|$|E
60|$|Suddenly I {{was filled}} with the thought of her and a great longing for her. <b>What</b> <b>would</b> <b>she</b> <b>do</b> when she {{realised}} our immense disaster? <b>What</b> <b>would</b> <b>she</b> <b>do?</b> How <b>would</b> <b>she</b> take it? It filled me with astonishment to realise how little I could tell....|$|R
6000|$|FANNY [leaning over a chair, she {{is staring}} {{into the eyes of}} the first Lady Bantock]. I wonder <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> have <b>done</b> if <b>she</b> had ever got herself into a really {{first-class}} muddle? ...|$|R
60|$|This gentle intimation that Meerta {{had their}} lives in her hand, induced Sam to ask {{modestly}} <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> have him <b>do.</b>|$|R
2500|$|She {{describes}} herself as a stay-at-home person, and likes watching DVDs, listening to music, and reading books. When asked <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> if the world {{was going to end}} tomorrow, she said [...] "read books". She also likes swimming, particularly backstroke. She has a pet (male) cat, called Jill.|$|E
2500|$|Palin {{is opposed}} to {{abortion}} in almost all cases, including rape and incest, but not if {{the life of the}} mother is endangered. In 2006, while running for governor, Palin was asked <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> if her own daughter were raped and became pregnant; she responded that she would [...] "choose life." [...] She and her husband have stated that they have [...] "faith that every baby is created for a good purpose." [...] When asked <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> as governor if Roe v. Wade were overturned, she responded [...] "it would not be up [...] to unilaterally ban anything. It would be up to the people of Alaska to discuss and decide how we would like our society to reflect our values." [...] Palin personally supported bills to outlaw late-term abortions and to require parental consent for underage abortions in Alaska, but rebuffed religious conservatives who wanted to legislate restrictions on abortion even though she agreed with the bills.|$|E
2500|$|In March 2003, {{she took}} part in the Code Pink anti-war march in Washington, D.C. That autumn, she served as emcee at several stops on the Tell Us the Truth tour, a political-themed concert series {{featuring}} Steve Earle, Billy Bragg, Tom Morello, and others. Throughout the year, Garofalo also actively campaigned for Howard Dean. While on Fox News' program The Pulse, O'Reilly asked Garofalo <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> if her predictions that the Iraq war would be a disaster were to turn out wrong. Garofalo stated: ...|$|E
5000|$|When asked <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be <b>doing</b> if <b>she</b> {{were not}} a writer, Cain {{explained}} that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be a research psychologist, saying she is insatiably curious about human nature. Cain's interest in writing about introversion reportedly stemmed from her own difficulties with public speaking, which made Harvard Law School [...] "a trial." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “If we {{know which}} one of the girls had taken baby,” said Arthur, “we could figure better on <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> likely <b>do.</b> Inez <b>would</b> try to reach some Mexican {{settlement}} where she had friends, while Mildred might attempt to get into Los Angeles or San Diego, where she could safely hide.” ...|$|R

2500|$|In October 2003, {{while in}} the UK to promote her film In the Cut, Meg Ryan made a {{controversial}} appearance on Parkinson, which resulted in negative publicity. The press accused both Ryan and Parkinson of being rude to one another. Ryan gave a few one-word answers, and after she acknowledged that she wasn't comfortable with the interview, Parkinson asked her <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> {{if she were in}} his position now. She replied that she would [...] "just wrap it up". Parkinson later revealed to the press that he felt her behaviour to his earlier guests, Trinny Woodall and Susannah Constantine, whom she turned her back on, was [...] "unforgivable". Ryan also commented that Parkinson was a [...] "nut" [...] and said that she was [...] "offended" [...] by him as he was like a [...] "disapproving father" [...] in his tone. A 2006 survey of British TV viewers, her behaviour on the show was voted the third [...] "most shocking" [...] TV chat show moment ever.|$|E
2500|$|Hauserman was a {{contestant}} on {{the first}} season of VH1's I Love Money, a reality show where 17 former contestants from Rock of Love, Flavor of Love, and I Love New York compete for a $250,000 cash prize. Megan appeared on all fourteen episodes of the first season and is featured {{at the center of}} the season one poster. On the first episode when she was asked <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> with the money if she won the competition, she stated that she wants to help [...] "mentally challenged" [...] dogs, and that she adopted a mentally challenged dog, a chihuahua named Lily. She quit the competition in the thirteenth episode (the finale) when it was revealed that she would have to face a jury of former contestants whom she had a part in eliminating. She finished the competition in third place. Hauserman stated in her exit interview that she was happy with her decision to quit not only because it stopped her contestants from getting the satisfaction of payback, but also that she was happy that she stopped everyone she didn't want to win the money and that she was satisfied with whoever won the money in the top three. Hauserman also stated that she never thought that she would win the money, and that she came simply to have fun and play the game to the best of her ability. On the I Love Money reunion special, Megan said that there were no rules opposing the way she played the game, so she used her brain to out-smart people, because it was her given talent.|$|E

6000|$|I know <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> have <b>done.</b> But {{one thing}} is clear--there was {{something}} besides her brother's disappearance between Grandemont's pleadings for her hand and Adèle's [...] "yes." [...] Ten years had passed, and <b>what</b> <b>she</b> had seen during the space of that lightning flash remained an indelible picture. She had loved her brother, but was she holding out for the solution of that mystery or for the [...] "Truth"? Women {{have been known to}} reverence it, even as an abstract principle. It is said {{there have been a few}} who, in the matter of their affections, have considered a life to be a small thing as compared with a lie. That I do not know. But, I wonder, had Grandemont cast himself at her feet crying that his hand had sent Victor to the bottom of that inscrutable river, and that he could no longer sully his love with a lie, I wonder if--I wonder <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> have <b>done!</b> ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh! no, Miss Lilias, he will {{do nothing}} for her while she sends her child to school and to church. He will not speak to her even. Not a bit of butter, nor a morsel of bacon, has been in her house since Michaelmas, and <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> have <b>done</b> {{if it was not}} for Mr. Devereux and Mrs. Weston, I cannot think.' ...|$|R

50|$|Point of view: The {{story is}} told from a mother's first person point of view. The narrator, a {{remarried}} mother of five children, remembers the way she parented her first child, Emily. Her thoughts, and the story, are about <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> have <b>done</b> differently while parenting Emily {{if she had been}} more experienced and had better options. It is one of Olsen's most anthologized works.|$|R
5000|$|According to Zahn's goodbye letter penned to CNN staff, {{she stated}} [...] "I {{plan to take}} a break between jobs and catch my breath before I take on my next role." [...] In a New York Times interview, which was {{conducted}} right after the announcement of her resignation broke, Zahn told Jacques Steinberg that [...] "she had no idea <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be <b>doing</b> next".|$|R
60|$|Winifred smiled. They {{would all}} plunge about with {{suggestions}} {{of this and}} that, but <b>she</b> knew already <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be <b>doing,</b> and that was--nothing. The feeling that, after all, she had won a sort of victory, retained her property, was every moment gaining ground in her. No! {{if she wanted to}} punish him, she could do it at home without the world knowing.|$|R
6000|$|Evidently {{anxious to}} know <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> in {{aforesaid}} case, Mr. Fletcher {{decided to put}} one before her as speedily as possible, so he said, in a pensive tone, and with a wistful glance: ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. and Mrs. Marshall Elliott {{were living}} comfortably and harmoniously {{in the green}} house. Leslie was busy with sewing, for she and Owen were to be married at Christmas. Anne {{wondered}} <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> when Leslie was gone.|$|E

5000|$|In 1974, the {{producers}} of a theater-in-the-round version of Peter Pan offered Rigby the title role. Rigby commented that she was [...] "scared to death" [...] during rehearsals; only 20 and just a year into [...] "retirement," [...] {{she had no idea}} <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be <b>doing</b> with {{the rest of her life}} when the role came along. To her surprise, she discovered that she enjoyed playing Peter Pan.|$|R
60|$|Mrs Denman professed utter ignorance on this point, {{and when}} {{told that it}} ought to be known to every one in the house as a mode of escape in the event of fire, she mildly {{requested}} to know <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> have to <b>do</b> if there were such a trap.|$|R
