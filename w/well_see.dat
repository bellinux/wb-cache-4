5|$|Boron carbide's {{structure}} is only approximately B4C, {{and it shows}} a clear depletion of carbon from this suggested stoichiometric ratio. This is due to its very complex structure. The substance can be seen with empirical formula B12C3 (i.e., with B12 dodecahedra being a motif), but with less carbon, as the suggested C3 units are replaced with C-B-C chains, and some smaller (B6) octahedra are present as <b>well</b> (<b>see</b> the boron carbide article for structural analysis). The repeating polymer plus semi-crystalline structure of boron carbide gives it great structural strength per weight. It is used in tank armor, bulletproof vests, and numerous other structural applications.|$|E
5|$|On 5 December 1942, Graf Zeppelin was towed back to Kiel {{and placed}} in a {{floating}} drydock. It seemed she might <b>well</b> <b>see</b> completion after all, but by late January 1943 Hitler had become so disenchanted with the Kriegsmarine, especially with what he perceived as the poor performance of its surface fleet, that he ordered all of its larger ships taken out of service and scrapped. Raeder was shortly relieved of command and replaced with the Commander of Submarines Karl Dönitz. Though Admiral Dönitz eventually persuaded Hitler to void most of the order, work on all new surface ships and even those nearing completion was halted, including Graf Zeppelin. On 30 January 1943, all major work on the ship ceased, though some limited, temporary work continued until March.|$|E

25|$|The case of simply-connected {{fillings}} {{is equivalent}} to Pu's inequality. Recently the case of genus-1 fillings was settled affirmatively, as <b>well</b> (<b>see</b> reference by Bangert et al. below). Namely, {{it turns out that}} one can exploit a half-century old formula by J. Hersch from integral geometry. Namely, consider the family of figure-8 loops on a football, with the self-intersection point at the equator (see figure {{at the beginning of the}} article). Hersch's formula expresses the area of a metric in the conformal class of the football, as an average of the energies of the figure-8 loops from the family. An application of Hersch's formula to the hyperelliptic quotient of the Riemann surface proves the filling area conjecture in this case.|$|E

500|$|An {{officer in}} one of the 38th Division's {{infantry}} battalions, who met Cubitt in early June, shortly after he took command, described him as [...] "a very large and fierce-looking major-general, with two rows of ribbons, and a gleam in his eye", who proceeded to interrogate a subaltern about the exact type and position of his unit's trench latrines, apparently something of a pet topic. A [...] "fire-eater with a marvellous flow of language", it was Cubitt's manner of speech, more than anything else, which made an impact on his contemporaries; a front-line officer in 1918 described watching him, during the October offensive, clearing a traffic jam with merely [...] "a magnificent gush of language". A colleague from his early days in the artillery described him as a [...] "perpetual joy to the soldier's world ... because of his picturesque language, which never gave offence because it was so absolutely natural and so aptly fitted the occasion", but under some circumstances it proved less suitable. Following a failed raid in 1918, he visited the offending battalion and harangued the officers collectively for some time, before demanding that they [...] "damn well had to do the raid over again, and damn <b>well</b> <b>see</b> that [...] made a proper job of it, or, by God, damn well go on raiding until [...] damn well did." [...] To the officers on the receiving end, already tired and dissatisfied, this was seen as a [...] "contemptible exhibition" [...] for a senior officer to make.|$|E
