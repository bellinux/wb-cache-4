5|$|At the 1933 World Scout Jamboree, a 14-year-old Scout named Bela Bánáthy <b>was</b> <b>kneeling</b> by his campfire {{when three}} uniformed men rode up on horseback: Count Paul Teleki, the Chief Scout of Hungary and the Chief of Staff for the jamboree; General Kisbarnaki Ferenc Farkas, a general staff {{officer of the}} Royal Hungarian Army; and Baden-Powell, the British hero of the Boer War and Chief Scout of the World. The men {{introduced}} themselves to the Scout and inspected his camp. They complimented him on {{a job well done}} and rode on. Meeting the Chief Scout of Hungary and Boer War hero Robert Baden-Powell left a deep impression on Bánáthy. He decided he would become a military officer instead of a minister.|$|E
5|$|Despite her predicament, Sánchez {{remained}} relatively positive: she sang to Germán Santa María Barragán, {{a journalist who}} {{was working as a}} volunteer, asked for sweet food, drank soda, and agreed to be interviewed. At times, she was scared, and prayed or cried. On the third night, Sánchez began hallucinating, saying that {{she did not want to}} be late for school, and mentioned a maths exam. Near the end of her life, Sánchez's eyes reddened, her face swelled, and her hands whitened. At one point she asked the people to leave her so they could rest. Hours later the workers returned with a pump and tried to save her, but her legs were bent under the concrete as if she <b>was</b> <b>kneeling,</b> and it was impossible to free her without severing her legs. Lacking the surgical equipment to save her from the effects of an amputation, the doctors present agreed that it would be more humane to let her die. In all, Sánchez suffered for nearly three nights (roughly 60 hours) before she died at approximately 10:05 A.M. on November 16 from exposure, most likely from gangrene or hypothermia.|$|E
25|$|The seventh {{match was}} between Tazz (ECW) and Tajiri (WWF). The match started with Tajiri {{performing}} a spinning heel kick, and a standing moonsault. Tazz fought {{back with a}} head and arm suplex. Tajiri then escaped a suplex attempt, and performed kicks and punches. Tazz fought back with a clothesline. After Tazz applied a cross armbar, and performed a flapjack spinebuster, Tajiri fought back with a handspring back elbow. Tazz then pulled Tajiri off the apron, and sent him into the ringsteps. Back in the ring, Tajiri applied the Tarantula, and dropkicked Tazz, who <b>was</b> <b>kneeling.</b> Tazz then blocked a kick, and performed a capture suplex. He then shoved the referee out of the way, allowing Tajiri to spit green mist into Tazz's face, and pin him after a Buzzsaw Kick.|$|E

500|$|This episode {{featured}} guest appearances by actors Paul Reubens and Isabella Rossellini. Fey {{wrote the}} role of Prince Gerhardt Hapsburg specifically for Reubens, {{and he did not}} have to audition. Fey, in regard to Reubens, said: [...] "We were thrilled beyond belief to get him to do [...]" [...] Kevin Lasit, the show's prop master, built Gerhardt's wheelchair and puppet legs. Fey said that Lasit [...] "really outdid himself", and noted that Reubens <b>was</b> <b>kneeling</b> in the wheelchair in the seat built over the top of him. In addition, Reubens wore prosthetic teeth and a wig to accommodate his character's look. According to Fey, in the DVD commentary for this episode, the show shot an alternate endingat Reubens's requestin which Gerhardt does not die, [...] "but ultimately it felt better stakes for the story if he'd die", in which Will Forte's character says, [...] "The Habsburg line has ended. You can pick up your gift bags at the coat check." [...] In [...] "Black Tie", Rosellini played Bianca, the ex-wife of Alec Baldwin's character, Jack Donaghy. Rosellini would make a second appearance in the February 8, 2007, episode [...] "Up All Night". Comedian actor Will Forte, who played Tomas, the messenger of Prince Gerhardt, has appeared in the main cast of Saturday Night Live (SNL), a weekly sketch comedy series which airs on NBC in the United States. Fey was the head writer on SNL from 1999 until 2006.|$|E
2500|$|The {{canonical}} {{hours of}} the Breviary owe their remote origin to the Old Covenant when God commanded the Aaronic priests to offer morning and evening sacrifices. Other inspiration {{may have come from}} David's words in the Psalms [...] "Seven times a day I praise you" [...] (Ps. 119:164), as well as, [...] "the just man meditates on the law day and night" [...] (Ps. 1:2). Regarding Daniel [...] "Three times daily he <b>was</b> <b>kneeling</b> and offering prayers and thanks to his God" [...] (Dan. 6:10).|$|E
2500|$|Milkman's mother (Ruth Foster Dead) is the {{daughter}} of the town's only black doctor; she makes her husband feel inadequate, and it is clear she idolized her father, Doctor Foster, to the point of obsession. After her father dies, her husband claims to have found her in bed with the dead body, sucking his fingers. Ruth later tells Milkman that she <b>was</b> <b>kneeling</b> at her father's bedside kissing the only part of him that remained unaffected by the illness from which he died. These conflicting stories expose the problems between his parents and show Milkman that [...] "truth" [...] is difficult or impossible to obtain. Macon is often violently aggressive towards Ruth because he believes that she was involved sexually with her father and loved her father more than her own husband. On one occasion, Milkman punches his father after he strikes Ruth, exposing the growing rift between father and son.|$|E

2500|$|On June 22, Jackie Bryson, {{a friend}} of Grant [...] "who <b>was</b> <b>kneeling</b> and handcuffed just inches from Grant when Johannes Mehserle shot him", testified for the prosecution. Bryson said that Grant's hands were under Grant's body and Grant said: [...] "I quit. I surrender." [...] He claimed that Mehserle said [...] "Fuck this" [...] before {{shooting}} Grant. Defense attorney Rains repeatedly accused Bryson of lying to convict Mehserle and pointed out a video showing Bryson running toward the train while handcuffed. Responding to Rains' question, [...] "You were going to leave your friend on that platform, weren't you?" [...] Bryson said [...] "I would never leave my friend." [...] Rains accused Bryson of being inconsistent based on his statements in the civil lawsuit he had filed in early January 2009 against BART. Bryson {{said that he had}} lied to investigators, distrusted the police, and had been frequently stressed since Grant's killing.|$|E
2500|$|After the First Vatican Council concluded, an {{emissary}} of the Roman Curia was {{dispatched to}} secure the signatures of the patriarch and the Melkite delegation. Gregory and the Melkite bishops subscribed to it, but added the qualifying clause used at the Council of Florence: [...] "except the rights and privileges of Eastern patriarchs." [...] He earned the enmity of Pope Pius IX for this; during his next visit to the pontiff before leaving Rome, when Gregory <b>was</b> <b>kneeling</b> the Pope placed his kneel on the patriarch's shoulder, just saying to him: Testa dura! (You headstrong!). In spite of this event, Gregory and the Melkite Catholic Church remained committed to their union with the Holy See. Relationships with the Vatican improved {{following the death of}} Pius IX and the subsequent election of Pope Leo XIII. Leo's encyclical Orientalium dignitas in 1894 addressed some of the Eastern Catholic Churches' concerns on latinization and the centralization of power in Rome. Leo confirmed that the limitations placed on the Armenian Catholic patriarch by Pius IX's 1867 letter Reversurus would not apply to the Melkite Church and he formally recognized an expansion of Patriarch Gregory's jurisdiction to include all Melkites throughout the Ottoman Empire.|$|E
2500|$|At war's end, Crawford {{returned}} home {{and found a}} job in the coal mines at Centralia, Pennsylvania. [...] He moved there with his parents, John A. and Susie Crawford. [...] His father John A. became the town's tailor. [...] The death of his mother two years later permanently influenced his life. On her deathbed, Susie Wallace Crawford exacted a promise from her son that [...] "as long as he lived he would never drink liquor." [...] The senior Crawford's addiction to strong drink had caused the family to suffer. In fact, one of Jack Crawford's earliest recollections <b>was</b> <b>kneeling</b> by his mother's side [...] "praying God to save a wayward father and husband."' Crawford kept this promise {{for the rest of his}} life, becoming one of the few teetotal scouts that ever worked for the U.S. Army. This deathbed scene likewise found its way into Captain Jack's lectures and essays, contributing to Crawford's reputation as a leading temperance advocate. While in Centralia in September 1869, Jack married a local school teacher, Anna Maria Stokes, of Numidia, north of Centralia. Jack was appointed postmaster of Girardville, Pennsylvania and Jack and Anna Marie moved there. [...] He was also an officer in the local miner's union. Together they had five children, including a girl who was named for Jack's friend William 'Buffalo Bill' Cody. [...] Her name was May Cody Crawford.|$|E
