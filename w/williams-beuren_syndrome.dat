40|$|AbstractConventional {{karyotyping}} detects anomalies in 3 – 15 % {{of patients}} with multiple congenital anomalies and mental retardation (MCA/MR). Whole-genome array screening (WGAS) has been consistently suggested as the first choice diagnostic test for this group of patients, {{but it is very}} costly for large-scale use in developing countries. We evaluated the use of a combination of Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) kits to increase the detection rate of chromosomal abnormalities in MCA/MR patients. We screened 261 MCA/MR patients with two subtelomeric and one microdeletion kits. This would theoretically detect up to 70 % of all submicroscopic abnormalities. Additionally we scored the de Vries score for 209 patients in an effort to find a suitable cut-off for MLPA screening. Our results reveal that chromosomal abnormalities were present in 87 (33. 3 %) patients, but only 57 (21. 8 %) were considered causative. Karyotyping detected 15 abnormalities (6. 9 %), while MLPA identified 54 (20. 7 %). Our combined MLPA screening raised the total detection number of pathogenic imbalances more than three times when compared to conventional karyotyping. We also show that using the de Vries score as a cut-off for this screening would only be suitable under financial restrictions. A decision analytic model was constructed with three possible strategies: karyotype, karyotype + MLPA and karyotype + WGAS. Karyotype + MLPA strategy detected anomalies in 19. 8 % of cases which account for 76. 45 % of the expected yield for karyotype + WGAS. Incremental Cost Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) of MLPA is three times lower than that of WGAS, which means that, for the same costs, we have three additional diagnoses with MLPA but only one with WGAS. We list all causative alterations found, including rare findings, such as reciprocal duplications of regions deleted in Sotos and <b>Williams–Beuren</b> <b>syndromes.</b> We also describe imbalances that were considered polymorphisms or rare variants, such as the new SNP that confounded the analysis of the 22 q 13. 3 deletion syndrome...|$|R

Duplications involving loci associated with behavioural disturbances constitute an especially good candidate mechanism. The Williams-Beuren critical region (WBCR), located at 7 q 11. 23, is commonly deleted in <b>Williams-Beuren</b> microdeletion <b>syndrome</b> (WBS). However, only four patients with a duplication of the WBCR {{have been reported to}} date: one with severe language delay and the three others with variable developmental, psychomotor and language delay. OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: In this study, we screened 206 patients with autism spectrum disorders for the WBCR duplication by quantitative microsatellite analysis and multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification.

Microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH) {{is considered to be}} superior for the investigation of chromosomal aberrations in children with MR, and has been demonstrated to improve the diagnostic detection rate of these small chromosomal abnormalities. In this study we used 1 Mb genome-wide array-CGH to screen 48 children with MR and congenital malformations for submicroscopic chromosomal imbalances, where the underlying cause was unknown. All children were clinically investigated and subtelomere FISH analysis had been performed in all cases. Suspected microdeletion syndromes such as deletion 22 q 11. 2, <b>Williams-Beuren</b> and Angelman <b>syndromes</b> were excluded before array-CGH analysis was performed. We identified de novo interstitial chromosomal imbalances in two patients (4 %), and an interstitial deletion inherited from an affected mother in one patient (2 %). In another two of the children (4 %), suspected imbalances were detected but were also found in one of the non-affected parents. The yield of identified de novo alterations detected in this study is somewhat less than previously described, and might reflect the importance of which selection criterion of patients to be used before array-CGH analysis is performed.

50|$|Dog {{behavior}} is the internally coordinated responses (actions or inactions) {{of the domestic}} dog (individuals or groups) to internal and/or external stimuli. As the oldest domesticated species, with estimates ranging from 9,000-30,000 years BCE, the minds of dogs inevitably have been shaped by millennia of contact with humans. As {{a result of this}} physical and social evolution, dogs, more than any other species, have acquired the ability to understand and communicate with humans, and they are uniquely attuned to human behaviors. Behavioral scientists have uncovered a surprising set of social-cognitive abilities in the domestic dog. These abilities are not possessed by the dog's closest caninerelatives nor by other highly intelligent mammals such as great apes but rather parallel some of the social-cognitive skills of human children. Traits of high sociability and lack of fear in dogs may include genetic modifications related to <b>Williams-Beuren</b> <b>syndrome</b> in humans, which cause hypersociability at the expense of problem solving ability.|$|E

Although gastrointestinal difficulties {{are one of the}} most constant and prominent finding of the syndrome, including gastro-esophageal reflux (GER), poor suckling, vomiting, constipation, prolonged colic, rectal prolapse, inguinal, umbilical and hiatal hernia, there have been no reports of achalasia in association with <b>Williams-Beuren</b> <b>syndrome</b> in the literature. We present the case of a boy with <b>Williams-Beuren</b> <b>syndrome,</b> achalasia and recurrent postoperative stenosis of the cardia. After Heller myotomy, the boy developed severe restenosis of the cardia with abundant adhesions which repeated after every treatment, five times in periods shorter than one month.

Although the genetic defect causing <b>Williams-Beuren</b> <b>syndrome</b> might not be the direct cause of achalasia we suggest that the frequent development of severe restenosis of cardia due to tight adhesions could be the consequence of elastin gene haploinsufficiency and altered structure and function of elastic fibers in esophageal connective tissue.

40|$|Purpose: <b>Williams-Beuren</b> <b>syndrome</b> is a genomic {{disorder}} {{caused by}} a hemizygous contiguous gene deletion on chromosome 7 q 11. 23. Lower urinary tract symptoms are common in children with <b>Williams-Beuren</b> <b>syndrome.</b> However, there are few data on the management of voiding symptoms in this population. We report our experience using oxybutynin to treat urinary symptoms in children with <b>Williams-Beuren</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Materials and Methods: We prospectively analyzed 42 patients with <b>Williams-Beuren</b> <b>syndrome</b> and significant lower urinary tract symptoms due to detrusor overactivity diagnosed on urodynamics in a 12 -week, open-label study. Urological assessment included symptomatic evaluation, the impact of lower urinary tract symptoms on quality of life, frequency-volume chart, urodynamics and urinary tract sonography. After 12 weeks of treatment with 0. 6 mg/kg oxybutynin per day given in 3 daily doses, patients were assessed for treatment efficacy and side effects. Results: A total of 17 girls and 19 boys completed medical therapy and were assessed at 12 weeks. Mean +/- SD patient age was 9. 2 +/- 4. 3 years (range 3 to 18). The most common urinary complaint was urgency, which occurred in 31 patients (86. 1 %), followed by urge incontinence, which was seen in 29 (80. 5 %). Compared to baseline, urinary symptoms were substantially improved. The negative impact of storage symptoms on quality of life was significantly decreased from a mean +/- SD of 3. 3 +/- 1. 7 to 0. 5 +/- 0. 9 (p < 0. 001).

40|$|INTRODUCTION: <b>Williams-Beuren</b> <b>syndrome</b> (WBS; OMIM 194050) {{is caused}} by a {{hemizygous}} contiguous gene microdeletion at 7 q 11. 23. Supravalvular aortic stenosis, mental retardation, overfriendliness, and ocular and renal abnormalities comprise typical symptoms in WBS. Although fluorescence in situ hybridization is widely used for diagnostic confirmation, microsatellite DNA markers are considered highly informative and easily manageable. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to test the microsatellite markers for the diagnosis of <b>Williams-Beuren</b> <b>syndrome,</b> to determine the size and parental origin of microdeletion, compare the clinical characteristics between patients with different sizes of the deletion and parental origin. METHODS: We studied 97 patients with clinical diagnosis of <b>Williams-Beuren</b> <b>syndrome</b> using five microsatellite markers: D 7 S 1870, D 7 S 489, D 7 S 613, D 7 S 2476 and D 7 S 489 _A. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Using five markers together, the result was informative in all patients. The most informative marker was D 7 S 1870 (78. 4 %), followed by D 7 S 613 (75. 3 %), D 7 S 489 (70. 1 %) and D 7 S 2476 (62. 9 %). The microdeletion was present in 84 (86. 6 %) patients and absent in 13 (13. 4 %) patients. Maternal deletions were found in 52. 4 % of patients and paternal deletions in 47. 6 % of patients. The observed size of deletions was 1. 55 Mb in 76 / 84 patients (90. 5 %) and 1. 84 Mb in 8 / 84 patients (9. 5 %). SVAS as well as ocular and urinary abnormalities were more frequent in the patients with a deletion. There were no clinical differences in relation to either the size or parental origin of the deletion. CONCLUSION: Using these five selected microsatellite markers was informative in all patients, thus can be considered an alternative method for molecular diagnosis in <b>Williams-Beuren</b> <b>syndrome.</b> FAPES...|$|E

So far, however, hardly any deletions affecting only a single gene in the disease region have been described. We present here two healthy siblings with a pure, hemizygous deletion of CLIP 2. A putative role in the cognitive and behavioral abnormalities seen in Williams-Beuren patients has been suggested for this gene on the basis of observations in a knock-out mouse model. The presented siblings did not show any of the clinical features associated with the syndrome. Cognitive testing showed an average IQ for both and no indication of the Williams syndrome cognitive profile. This shows that CLIP 2 haploinsufficiency by itself does not lead to the physical or cognitive characteristics of the <b>Williams-Beuren</b> <b>syndrome,</b> nor does it lead to the Williams syndrome cognitive profile. Although contribution of CLIP 2 to the phenotype cannot be excluded when it is deleted in combination with other genes, our results support the hypothesis that GTF 2 IRD 1 and GTF 2 I are the main genes causing the cognitive defects associated with <b>Williams-Beuren</b> <b>syndrome...</b>|$|E
40|$|Aims Supravalvar aortic {{stenosis}} {{is a rare}} form of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction that is often progressive in childhood. Little data are available on outcomes in the adult population. Our aim was to define cardiac outcomes in adults with supravalvar {{aortic stenosis}}. Methods and results This is a multicentre retrospective study of cardiac outcomes in adults (≥ 18 years) with supravalvar aortic stenosis. We examined: (i) adverse cardiac events (cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, sustained arrhythmias, and infective endocarditis) and (ii) the need for cardiac surgery in adulthood. One hundred and thirteen adults (median age at first visit 19 years; 55 % with Williams-Beuren syndrome; 67 % with surgical repair in childhood) were identified. Adults without <b>Williams-Beuren</b> <b>syndrome</b> had more severe supravalvar aortic stenosis and more often associated left ventricular outflow tract obstructions (P < 0. 001). In contrast, mitral valve regurgitation was more common in patients with <b>Williams-Beuren</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Eighty-five per cent of adults (96 / 113) had serial follow-up information (median follow-up 6. 0 years). Of these patients, 13 % (12 / 96) had an adverse cardiac event and 13 % (12 / 96) had cardiac operations (7 valve repair or replacements, 4 supravalvar aortic stenosis repairs, 1 other). Cardiac surgery was more common in adults without <b>Williams-Beuren</b> <b>syndrome</b> (P = 0. 007). Progression of supravalvar aortic stenosis during adulthood was rare. Conclusion Adults with supravalvar aortic stenosis remain at risk for cardiac complications and reoperations, while progression of supravalvar aortic stenosis in adulthood is rare.
