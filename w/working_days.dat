5|$|The {{number of}} {{stoppages}} across the UK peaked at 4,583 in 1979, {{when more than}} 29million <b>working</b> <b>days</b> had been lost. In 1984, {{the year of the}} miners' strike, there were 1,221, resulting in the loss of more than 27million <b>working</b> <b>days.</b> Stoppages then fell steadily throughout the rest of Thatcher's premiership; in 1990 there were 630 and fewer than 2million <b>working</b> <b>days</b> lost, and they continued to fall thereafter. Thatcher's tenure also witnessed a sharp decline in trade union density, with the percentage of workers belonging to a trade union falling from 57.3% in 1979 to 49.5% in 1985. In 1979 up until Thatcher's final year in office, trade union membership also fell, from 13.5million in 1979 to fewer than 10million.|$|E

This {{is partly a}} legacy of Vietnam-era US bases, but mostly due to the region's poverty. As one researcher summed it up, [...] "The equation looks like this: One <b>working</b> <b>day</b> in a tapioca field pays $8 (300 baht). One <b>working</b> <b>day</b> at a multinational chicken factory pays $11 (400 baht). One <b>working</b> <b>day</b> at a metal factory in Denmark pays $91 (3200 baht), and one busy <b>working</b> <b>day</b> at a Danish brothel pays $450 (15,800 baht)." ...|$|R

By 1920, West Lianga still counted as the third-fastest delivery, behind two ships that were over one-third smaller than West Lianga. Shipbuilder Skinner & Eddy received a $71,600 bonus ($ million today) for completing West Lianga early.|$|E

5|$|In 1943, due to fear of Allied bombing, {{the prime}} {{minister}} of the Independent State of Croatia (NDH), Nikola Mandić, ordered the creation of a public bomb shelter under the hill of Gornji Grad. The said shelter was to be connected to an east-west corridor spanning the entirety of the hill. A sum of 141.2million NDH kuna was allocated for planning and construction of the tunnel. The project was assigned to engineers Abramović, Senjaković and Vajda. The plan was to construct the tunnel in 90 <b>working</b> <b>days,</b> but the cost rose to 490 million kuna (partly due to high wartime inflation) and the date of opening was delayed into 1944.|$|E
5|$|Mahesh {{received}} the film's script while dubbing for Dookudu (2011), {{but due to}} that commitment took ten days to finish reading the script. He {{said in an interview}} that he could maintain the consistency in the character only because of the fewer <b>working</b> <b>days.</b> Jagannadh did not cast Brahmanandam and Ali because of Mahesh's specific characterisation; he added that Mahesh's voice had changed when compared to his performance in Pokiri. Mahesh also convinced Jagannadh to give up smoking, since he himself was trying to give up after being a chain smoker.|$|E
5|$|Pokiri {{was shot}} {{predominantly}} {{in and around}} Hyderabad, especially in the Annapurna Studios, the aluminium factory near Gachibowli, Gayathri Hills and the Golconda Fort in 100 <b>working</b> <b>days,</b> from November 2005 to April 2006. Most of the scenes were shot in a single take though it took time for Mahesh to adjust to Jagannadh's style of filmmaking. Chennai-based stylist Chaitanya Rao designed the costume styling for Mahesh and D'Cruz. By late February 2006, {{eighty percent of the}} film shoot had been completed with the film's climax and two songs remaining. This made it Mahesh's fastest shot Telugu film with him in the lead role.|$|E

5|$|Poverty can {{increase}} the risk of malaria since those in poverty do not have the financial capacities to prevent or treat the disease. In its entirety, the economic impact of malaria has been estimated to cost Africa US$12 billion every year. The economic impact includes costs of health care, <b>working</b> <b>days</b> lost due to sickness, days lost in education, decreased productivity due to brain damage from cerebral malaria, and loss of investment and tourism. The disease has a heavy burden in some countries, where it may be responsible for 30–50% of hospital admissions, up to 50% of outpatient visits, and up to 40% of public health spending.|$|E
5|$|S. Thaman {{composed}} the film's music and Shyam K. Naidu was the film's cinematographer.

A few song sequences were shot in Bangkok. Filming ended on 10 December 2011 in 74 <b>working</b> <b>days,</b> one of the shortest periods in which a Telugu film has been shot.|$|E
5|$|Several actors {{campaigned for}} the leading role; ultimately, Eastwood decided that Jolie's face would suit the 1920s period setting. The film also stars Jeffrey Donovan, Jason Butler Harner, John Malkovich, Michael Kelly, and Amy Ryan. While some {{characters}} are composites, most {{are based on}} actual people. Principal photography, which began on October 15, 2007, and concluded {{a few weeks later}} in December, took place in Los Angeles and other locations in southern California. Actors and crew noted that Eastwood's low-key direction resulted in a calm set and short <b>working</b> <b>days.</b> In post-production, scenes were supplemented with computer-generated skylines, backgrounds, vehicles and people.|$|E
30|$|The {{fact that}} we are able to {{identify}} typical patterns of tweets for areas of high and low inward commuting also suggests that we can use these patterns to understand more about the appropriate time window to use for the typical <b>working</b> <b>day.</b> In Figure  4 (d), the two clusters intersect at around 9 : 00 and 17 : 00, suggesting this time period could be used as delimiting the typical <b>working</b> <b>day.</b> The clusters are also particularly clearly separated during the periods 10 : 00 - 15 : 00 and 20 : 00 - 23 : 00, which suggests that focusing on these times as a kind of ‘restricted’ <b>working</b> <b>day</b> may be optimal in terms of identifying work and home locations respectively. We experiment with the use of both of these approaches to defining the <b>working</b> <b>day</b> below.|$|R
50|$|To better {{understand}} the rate of surplus value one must {{understand that there are}} two parts to the <b>working</b> <b>day.</b> One part of the <b>working</b> <b>day</b> is the time necessary in order to produce the value of the workers labor power. The second part of the <b>working</b> <b>day</b> is surplus labor time, which produces no value for the laborer, but produces value for the capitalist. The rate of surplus value is a ratio of surplus labor time (s) to necessary labor time (v). The rate of surplus value (s/v) is also referred to by Marx as the rate of exploitation.|$|R
