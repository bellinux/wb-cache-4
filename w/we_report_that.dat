Each slot {{to the left of the}} canonical slot having is_occupied set indicates another run to be skipped, so we increment the running count. Each slot having is_continuation clear indicates the start of another run, thus the end of the previous run, so we decrement the running count. When the running count reaches zero, we are scanning the quotient's run. We can compare the remainder in each slot in the run with dR.

40|$|We {{have studied}} the effects of HGF on BIB {{dynamics}} in adult rats. We demonstrate that, at stages VII-VIII of the epithelium wave when germ cells traverse the BIB, HGF reduces the levels of occludin and influences its distribution pattern and assembling. Moreover, <b>we</b> <b>report</b> <b>that,</b> at stages VII-VIII, HGF significantly increases the amount of active TGF-beta {{and the amount of}} uPA present in the tubules. For the first time <b>we</b> <b>report</b> <b>that,</b> in the same stages, HGF reduces the amount of actin present in the BIB region, in which occludin levels are highest, and modifies the morphology of the actin cytoskeleton network. At the level of maximal intensity of occludin fluorescence, <b>we</b> <b>report</b> <b>that</b> HGF also modifies the colocalization of occludin and actin. Lastly, we demonstrate that HGF is maximally expressed at stages VII-VIII, whereas its levels fall in the subsequent stages...|$|E
