Some watchdog timers allow the time interval to be programmed by selecting from among a few selectable, discrete values. In others, the interval can {{be programmed to}} arbitrary values. Typically, <b>watchdog</b> <b>time</b> intervals range from ten milliseconds to a minute or more. In a multistage watchdog, each timer may have its own, unique time interval.|$|E

5000|$|A {{watchdog}} timer will perform a hard reset {{of a system}} unless some sequence is performed that generally indicates the system is alive, such as a write operation from an onboard processor. During normal operation, software schedules a write to the {{watchdog timer}} at regular intervals to prevent the timer from running out. If radiation causes the processor to operate incorrectly, it is unlikely the software will work correctly enough to clear the watchdog timer. The <b>watchdog</b> eventually <b>times</b> out and forces a hard reset to the system. This is considered a last resort to other methods of radiation hardening.|$|R

Watchdogs provide only those functions that need special handling. Other operations proceed through the normal file system, unimpeded by {{the existence of}} watchdogs. We describe a prototype implementation of watchdogs {{that has been used}} to build several useful applications. Although only a prototype, the system has acceptable performance. This work took place while the authors were supported by NSF Grants No. DCR- 8420945 and CCR- 86 I I 390. Bershad was also supported by a USENIX Associatio...|$|R

The landmark decision was made after consultation with MDA's arts advisory groups, following the recommendations of the 2003 Censorship Review Committee appointed by the Government arts <b>watchdog</b> of the <b>time,</b> the Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts (MITA) to exempt more 'innocuous' arts entertainment from licensing. Jason Wee's exhibition (see above) featuring pixelated erect male genitalia was mentioned in the press release and was finally deemed to be 'innocuous' by the Government.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — We {{propose a}} formal {{implementation}} and analysis ways to specify and verify real-time systems. The theoretic model is adapted using synchronous timed-automata as a generic framework based on Timed Processes Algebra (TPA) to describe its static structure and dynamic behavior. The abstraction {{is provided by}} Maude [11], extended to Real-Time Maude a formalism and a simulation and analysis tool for real-time systems. It has flexible specification formalism, with a natural integration of data types, functional aspects and dynamic behaviour. It also has {{a wide range of}} analysis capabilities, including simulations of single behaviours and exhaustive state space exploration strategies [...] We address the formal specification of the CSMA/CD protocol as an executable specification program to capture essential operation aspects and synchronous communications. The simulation support timeouts, <b>watchdogs</b> and arbitrary <b>time</b> domains. We introduce the refinement aspect of an implementation into a specification by axiomatizing the bisimulation relation...|$|R
40|$|Event {{structures}} are a prominent noninterleaving model for concurrency. Real-time event structures associate {{a set of}} time instants to events, modelling absolute time constraints, and to causal dependencies, modelling relative delays between causally dependent events. We introduce this novel temporal model and show {{how it can be}} used to provide a denotational semantics to a real-time variant of a process algebra akin to LOTOS. This formalism includes a timed-action prefix which constrains the occurrence time of actions, a timeout and <b>watchdog</b> (i. e., <b>timed</b> interrupt) operator. An event-based operational semantics for this formalism is presented that is shown to be consistent with the denotational semantics. As an example we use an infinite buffer with time constraints on the message latency and the rates of accepting and producing data. 1 Introduction Timed extensions of interleaving models for concurrency have been investigated thoroughly in the last decade. Although there are many [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Distributed {{systems are}} used in {{numerous}} applications where failures can be costly. Due to concerns {{that some of the}} nodes may become faulty, critical services are usually replicated across several nodes, which execute distributed algorithms to ensure correct service in spite of failures. To prevent replica-exhaustion, it is fundamental to detect errors and trigger appropriate recovery actions. In particular, it is important to detect situations in which nodes cease to execute the intended algorithm, e. g., when a replica is compromised by an attacker or when a hardware fault causes the node to behave erratically. This paper proposes a method for monitoring the local execution of nodes using watchdog timers. The approach consists in deducing, from the global system properties, local states that must be visited periodically by nodes that execute the intended algorithm correctly. When a node fails to trigger a <b>watchdog</b> before the <b>time</b> limit, an appropriate response can be initiated. The approach is applied to a well-known Byzantine consensus algorithm. The algorithm is modeled in the PROMELA language and the SPIN model checker is used to identify local states that must be visited periodically by correct nodes. Such states are suitable for online monitoring using watchdog timers...|$|R
40|$|The {{fourth estate}} is {{undergoing}} dramatic changes. Many newspaper reporters, already {{surrounded by a}} growing number of empty desks, are shifting their focus away from costly investigative reporting and towards amassing Twitter followers and writing the perfect “share line. ” Newspapers’ budgets can no longer robustly support accountability journalism and pitching fights against the government. And so, while this busier and noisier media environment may have a desirable democratizing effect—more of us are able to participate in analyzing, debating, and perhaps even making the news—it has not succeeded in filling a role that print journalists have traditionally played well—keeping watch on the government. In order to perpetuate its historical role as watchdog, the fourth estate needs fortification. This fortification should {{come in the form of}} legal preferences for the press. Providing such preferences is not new, but it arguably has not been done in a significant way since postal subsidies were granted to newspapers in the colonial era. Today, with few exceptions, the law generally treats journalists just like any other citizens and news organizations like any other business. This article proposes a new way to preference the press—one that would not involve direct subsidies or discriminating between old media and new. Instead, it would give journalists a commodity that is fundamental to their work: information. To preference the press, this article looks to the Freedom of Information Act, the law governing when and how the executive branch discloses information to the public. While in theory the law facilitates the press’s access to vast amounts of information in the hands of the executive branch, implementation of FOIA has, since it was passed in 1966, been fraught with problems. Agencies routinely take months and even years to respond to journalists’ requests, making the process incompatible with a news cycle that is spinning ever faster. This article proposes focusing on FOIA’s expedited processing provisions to prioritize journalists’ requests over those of other requesters, expedite agency fulfillment of them, and ease the press’s ability to challenge late, incomplete, or otherwise unsatisfactory disclosures. It argues that any journalist filing a FOIA request seeking expedited processing should presumptively go to the front of the queue. At that point, there would be firm deadlines (where none exist now) for providing the journalist with the information requested. These small but significant changes to an already established provision of FOIA could help the media better serve as a <b>watchdog</b> at a <b>time</b> when that role needs protecting...|$|R
