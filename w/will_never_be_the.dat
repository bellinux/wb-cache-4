[...] The new stand was larger than the old one, taking Villa's capacity from 39,399 to its present 42,682.

On the topic of O'Malley performing open heart surgery in an elevator, Knight said: [...] "It's a slow change but he's starting to realize, 'The way I have been doing things is not working.' The big thing about the open-heart surgery in the elevator was he was forced into it. He needs {{to be kind of}} kicked in the (butt) to do these things." ...|$|E

No comeback has ever worked. The motivation behind the comeback has never and <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> same as when the group or artist first crawled out of their sub-cult....

But it’s a struggle – a genuine struggle for them. Being hardcore doesn’t come naturally. Sometimes, they have to fake it." [...] Grey's personality has been compared with that of Alex Karev's.

The song is played in the time signature of common time in the key E minor, with Jackson's vocal range spanning from the tonal nodes of E4 to Bb5. [...] "You Rock My World" [...] has a moderate tempo of 95 [...] beats per minute. The chord progression in the song is Em7–C9-Bm7–Am7–D–Em7.

A badly out-of-shape Stanley Hudson (Leslie David Baker) undergoes a painful struggle in climbing the stairs, only to be greeted at the top by Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) ordering him {{to take part in}} an important sales call. Unwilling to climb the stairs a second time, Stanley refuses. Since the client is a friend of Stanley, Dwight (who is operating without concern for niceties now that the documentary has driven home the point that he <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> branch manager at Dunder Mifflin) cannot take no for an answer, so he shoots Stanley with bull tranquilizers. With help from Clark Green (Clark Duke), Dwight gets Stanley to the car. The tranquilizers inexplicably make Stanley intoxicated, and his unusually jolly mood helps them close the sale. When Stanley regains full awareness, he is pleased to learn that he made a sale with no effort whatsoever, but still refuses to take the stairs again. He instead knocks himself out with one of Dwight's darts, leaving Dwight and Clark {{to figure out how to}} get him back upstairs.|$|E
