500|$|The {{vehicle is}} calmly lowered {{back down to}} the ground while mist, fire, {{electricity}} and smoke effects spray, and Homer yells that he wants to ride again. Krusty then appears on the TV screen in the loading room and remarks [...] "Well, that's our ride. Hey! <b>What</b> <b>does</b> <b>THIS</b> do?!". For the Orlando attraction, Krusty is sitting in a control room and pushes an emergency button on a control panel, causing the vehicle to vibrate, ending the ride. In the Hollywood version, Krusty is sitting in a control room and takes a picture of the guests (The on-ride photo is taken here for the Hollywood attraction). After the gullwing doors on the car lift up, guests exit the ride.|$|E
500|$|E! {{reacted to}} the scene by writing, [...] "We seemed to {{experience}} the same whirlwind of emotions they did: The hesitance, the shock, the elation, the weirdness of how right it felt, and then, of course, the inevitable 'Oh crap, what did we just do and <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>this</b> mean?' awkwardness of it all. They, and the show, {{would never be the}} same. In the best way possible." [...] Buzzfeed ranked the episode as the 4th best Veronica Mars episode, behind [...] "A Trip to the Dentist", [...] "Leave It to Beaver", and [...] "Not Pictured." [...] TV Line ranked the episode 6th on a similar list. Give Me My Remote ranked [...] "Weapons of Class Destruction" [...] as the fifth best episode of Veronica Mars, particularly noting the kiss scene between Logan and Veronica. [...] "Veronica kisses Logan in a scene that was full of so much chemistry that it gave me chills. The episode ends with Veronica figuring out that Ben was setting Norris up, but, honestly, who was really paying attention at that point? Veronica and Logan had finally realized that their chemistry was undeniable!" ...|$|E

500|$|NBC {{executives}} {{tried to}} solve the problem so that both Leno and O'Brien would keep their jobs. Jeff Gaspin, the chairman of NBC Universal Television, instructed both parties that he did not wish to make a difficult decision but that the most appropriate solution was to move Leno back to his previous timeslot and push O'Brien to 12:05. Carter details a heated exchange between NBC executive Jeff Zucker and O'Brien's agent Rick Rosen during which Zucker told O'Brien's representatives he could enforce O'Brien's contract and [...] "ice him for two years", after details of the conflict were leaked to the media. The author cites O'Brien's disappointment with the perceived unfairness of the situation, and quotes O'Brien's comments at a meeting with NBC Entertainment and Universal Media Studios chairman Marc Graboff and Jeff Gaspin, [...] "I know how hard I worked for this. It was promised to me. I had a shitty lead-in." [...] Carter recounts how affiliates of NBC complained to the network about the poor ratings performance of Leno's program The Jay Leno Show. O'Brien asked the two NBC executives, [...] "What does Jay have on you? <b>What</b> <b>does</b> <b>this</b> guy have on you people? What the hell is it about Jay?" ...|$|E
500|$|Since {{his books}} often serve as {{vehicles}} {{for his political}} manifesto, Sarmiento's writings commonly mock governments, with Facundo being the most prominent example. He elevates his own status {{at the expense of}} the ruling elite, almost portraying himself as invincible due to the power of writing. Toward the end of 1840, Sarmiento was exiled for his political views. Covered with bruises received the day before from unruly soldiers, he wrote in French, [...] "On ne tue point les idees" [...] (misquoted from [...] "on ne tire pas des coups de fusil aux idees", which means [...] "ideas cannot be killed by guns"). The government decided to decipher the message, and on learning the translation, said, [...] "So! <b>What</b> <b>does</b> <b>this</b> mean?". With the failure of his oppressors to understand his meaning, Sarmiento is able to illustrate their ineptitude. His words are presented as a [...] "code" [...] that needs to be [...] "deciphered", and unlike Sarmiento those in power are barbaric and uneducated. Their bafflement not only demonstrates their general ignorance, but also, according to Sorensen, illustrates [...] "the fundamental displacement which any cultural transplantation brings about", since Argentine rural inhabitants and Rosas's associates were unable to accept the civilized culture which Sarmiento believed would lead to progress in Argentina.|$|E
500|$|In early 2008 {{during an}} {{interview}} with the Daily Mail, Lister expressed her feelings on the subject of lesbian storylines, stating: [...] "I'd definitely do a lesbian love scene in Hollyoaks. That would be a really good story." [...] It was later confirmed by Channel 4 that Lister's character would be involved in a sexual relationship with Sarah during the new late night series Hollyoaks Later. After the screening of the scenes, Lister explained: [...] "It was quite nerve-wracking actually as I'm good friends with Loui — it's quite a strange thing to smooch a really good friend so we had to get over the giggles and think 'right, just do it!'" [...] Also commenting on her worries about the scenes, she said: [...] "I thought it was hilarious! I thought it'd be interesting, though. I was obviously quite worried about them. Loui [...] and I chatted a lot when we found out {{that it was going to}} be in the late-night eps and we were wondering 'oh no, <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>this</b> mean?!' But in the end, they weren't graphic or anything like that, so it was fine." [...] She continued: [...] "It was completely mental filming them. Loui and I just had a massive attack of the giggles. I think the crew were more embarrassed than we were! We were kind of ignored for the day." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, {{all young}} ladies talk well, of course. But <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>this</b> one say? <b>What</b> <b>did</b> she do, except suffer a visible pang of {{homesickness}} {{at the sight}} of unattainable poultry? Come, you have represented the interview with Miss Blood as one of great brilliancy." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>this</b> unaccustomed bit of bluster mean? for unaccustomed it was; and Tom {{knew well}} that Mary Armsworth {{had her own}} way, and managed her father as {{completely}} as he managed Whitbury.|$|R
2500|$|The Passion of the Lord signifies our time, {{in which}} we now weep. [...] Whips, fetters, mockings, spit, crown of thorns, embittered wine, vinegar in a sponge, insults, taunts, finally the cross itself, the holy limbs hanging on the wood, <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>this</b> signify to us, if not the time {{in which we}} act, the time of mourning, the time of mortality, the time of temptation? ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>What</b> <b>does</b> <b>this</b> {{mean for}} the proof? The first clue means that a simple {{examination}} of the M-code on the tape will not reveal if a symbol 0 is ever printed by U+"M-code". A testing-machine might look for the appearance of DC {{in one of the}} strings of symbols that represent an instruction. But will this instruction ever be [...] "executed?" [...] Something has to [...] "run the code" [...] to find out. This something can be a machine, or it can be lines in a formal proof, i.e. Lemma #1.|$|E
2500|$|Nine in {{the fifth}} place means: [...] "Flying dragon in the heavens. It furthers one to see the great man." [...] <b>What</b> <b>does</b> <b>this</b> signify? The Master said: Things that accord in tone vibrate {{together}} [...] Things that have affinity in their inmost natures seek one another [...] Water flows to what is wet, fire turns to what is dry. Clouds follow the dragon, wind follows the tiger. Thus the sage rises, and all creatures follow him with their eyes. What is born of heaven feels related to what is above. What is born of earth feels related to what is below. Each follows it kind. (tr. Wilhelm & Baynes 2011: 382) ...|$|E

6000|$|And then, too, {{there was}} the {{suggestion}} of hope held out by the constant reiteration of the phrase, [...] "There is a way out." [...] Was there a way out? <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>this</b> poor thing know? ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Catherick's undisguised {{contempt}} for Sir Percival plainly extended {{to his mother}} as well. She had referred with the bitterest sarcasm to the great family he had descended from--"especially by the mother's side." [...] <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>this</b> mean? ...|$|R
2500|$|What is {{the meaning}} of [...] "Acher {{destroyed}} the plants"? Of him scripture says: [...] "Do not let your mouth make your flesh sin". <b>What</b> <b>does</b> <b>this</b> mean? Acher saw that Metatron happened to be granted authority to sit while he record the merits of Israel, and he said: [...] "We have been taught that in heaven there is no sitting.... Perhaps there are — God forbid! — two supreme powers". They brought him to Metatron and they smote him with sixty bands of fire. They said to Metatron: [...] "When you saw him, why did you not stand up before him?" [...] Then authority was granted Metatron to erase the merits of Acher. Then a heavenly voice was heard: [...] "'Repent, O backsliding children!' except for Acher." ...|$|E
2500|$|Zhou Qun {{was from}} Langzhong County (閬中縣), Baxi Commandery (巴西郡), which is present-day Langzhong, Sichuan. His father, Zhou Shu (周舒), whose {{courtesy}} name was Shubu (叔布), was mentored by the scholar Yang Hou (楊厚) from Guanghan Commandery (廣漢郡; around present-day Zhongjiang County, Sichuan). Zhou Shu was second to two famous scholars, Dong Fu (董扶) and Ren An (任安), {{in terms of}} fame. On many occasions, he received invitations and offers {{to serve in the}} government of the Eastern Han dynasty, but he turned down all of them. Someone once asked him, [...] "The Spring and Autumn Annals mentioned 'something tall on the road will replace the Han (dynasty)'. <b>What</b> <b>does</b> <b>this</b> mean?" [...] Zhou Shu replied, [...] "That 'something tall on the road' refers to Wei." [...] Other scholars in his hometown who heard him secretly shared and circulated what he said.|$|E
2500|$|He however was applauded when {{he spoke}} about the Palestinian peoples' right to self-determination. He spoke {{on the issue of}} the September 11, 2001 attacks that [...] "if the root causes of 9/11 are {{examined}} properly, why it happened, what caused it, what conditions led to it, who was involved, and put together how to understand and how to prevent the crisis in Iraq, fix the problem in Afghanistan and Iraq combined". [...] He also stated [...] "the most liberated women in the world are the women in Iran". Despite having previously called the Holocaust a [...] "myth", Ahmadinejad stated [...] "granted this happened, <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>this</b> have to do with the Palestinian people?" [...] He used Koranic quotes to criticize the Bush administration and the bombings of Nagasaki and Hiroshima. [...] He also described Iran's nuclear ambitions as peaceful measures aimed at increasing Iran's energy production. Outside the convention many protested his presence there, most of them supporters of Jewish organizations [...]|$|E
60|$|The {{four young}} {{people looked at}} each other. <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>this</b> mean? Had the {{servants}} left in a body? Did they know that {{something was going to}} happen? Such were the mute questions which their looks asked each other.|$|R
6000|$|Ferdinand. I have a prattler {{three years}} old, my lord! [...] In truth {{he is my}} darling. As I went [...] From forth my door, he made a moan in sleep-- [...] But I am talking idly--pray go on! [...] And <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>this</b> man? ...|$|R

2500|$|Emperor Xizong's {{brother and}} {{successor}} Emperor Zhaozong eventually {{became aware of}} Zheng Qi's poems, as eunuchs recited them in their spare time. [...] Empeorr Zhaozong saw their biting satire and believed that they showed hidden talent. [...] In 894, he issued an edict making Zheng the deputy minister of rites (禮部侍郎, Libu Shilang) and a chancellor with the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (同中書門下平章事). [...] When Zheng's assistants reported this to Zheng to congratulate him, Zheng himself did not take it seriously and stated, [...] "Gentlemen, you must have erred. [...] Even {{if no one else}} under heaven knew how to read, the Fifth Zheng cannot be a chancellor." [...] When the assistants insisted that this was the will of the emperor, he stated, [...] "If this is true, people will laugh to death." [...] When the edict announcing his chancellorship arrived the next day, along with congratulating guests, Zheng was confounded, stating to himself, [...] "If the Fifth Zheng, the xiehou writer, becomes chancellor, <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>this</b> say about the current state of governance?" [...] He submitted several petitions declining the commission, but the emperor took no heed of them, so he felt compelled to report to his post as a chancellor.|$|E
2500|$|The {{announcement}} {{came as a}} {{shock to}} Italians and non-Italians alike. Umberto Eco expressed delight that the award had been given to someone who [...] "does not belong to the traditional academic world." [...] However, 86-year-old Italian literary critic Carlo Bo was mystified: [...] "I must be too old to understand. <b>What</b> <b>does</b> <b>this</b> mean? That everything changes, even literature has changed." [...] Fo's fellow Italian laureate Rita Levi-Montalcini expressed bewilderment when asked for her thoughts and wondered if Fo were Italian. Mario Luzi, a poet regarded as a likely next Italian recipient at the time, slammed the phone down on one reporter: [...] "I'll say only this. I've just about had it up to here!" [...] Reaction from the English-speaking world was also particularly fierce, with representatives from many English-speaking countries regarding Fo's work as unfashionable and outdated, belonging to the 1970s and 1980s. U.S. playwright Tony Kushner, however, expressed his approval, writing: [...] " [...] has dedicated his genius to making everything he touches debatable. [...] is brave and perhaps even reckless because it subjects Literature, and prizes, and Newspapers of Record, to the Fo effect". When he accepted the award, Fo presented a specially devised piece called Contra jogulatores obloquentes (Against Jesters of Irreverent Speech) alongside some paintings, with this later being described as [...] "undoubtedly the most flamboyantly theatrical and comical acceptance speech ever seen at the Swedish Academy." ...|$|E
6000|$|Oh! mock not the poniarded heart. The stabbed man {{knows the}} steel; prate not {{to him that}} it is only a {{tickling}} feather. Feels he not the interior gash? <b>What</b> <b>does</b> <b>this</b> blood on my vesture? and <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>this</b> pang in my soul? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In the circumstances!" [...] The {{irony of}} the phrase struck home. <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>this</b> young man know of the circumstances? There were reasons now, indeed, why he should fly from Thorpe as from a place {{stricken}} with the pestilence. But no other soul in this world could know of those reasons save himself--and she.|$|R
60|$|<b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>this</b> mean? <b>What</b> {{had they}} come for? And, {{disturbed}} to the heart, she gazed {{from one to}} the other. They had that curious look of people not quite knowing what their reception will be like, yet with something resolute, almost portentous, in their mien. She saw John go up to her aunt and hold out his hand.|$|R
60|$|<b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>this</b> strange {{disappearance}} mean? The Captain himself, when he {{took his}} seat in the canoe, would have been puzzled to answer that question. He asked, in the nearest approach that his knowledge could make to the language used in the island, whether {{he would be a}} long time or a short time absent from his ship.|$|R

50|$|Unfortunately, other {{countries}} {{did not want}} to follow <b>this</b> example. <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>this</b> lead to? There is an increase in global instability.

The United States is deploying here, at our borders, a missile defense system and improving its nuclear capabilities.|$|R
6000|$|A quiet little laugh, with a [...] "That'll be all right, Captain," [...] was his answer. All this, words, intonation, the glimpsed {{attitude}} {{of the man in}} the cuddy, had an unexpected character, a something friendly in it--propitiatory. And my surprise was not diminished thereby. <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>this</b> call mean? Was it the sign of some dark design against my commercial innocence? ...|$|R
