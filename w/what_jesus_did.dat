2500|$|In his letters, Paul also {{focuses on}} mental activities, {{but not in}} the same way as the Synoptics, which equate {{renewing}} the mind with repentance. Instead, Paul sees the renewal of our minds as happening as we contemplate <b>what</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>did</b> on the Cross, which then opens us to grace and to the movement of the Holy Spirit into our hearts. Like John, Paul is less interested in knowledge, preferring to emphasize the hiddenness, the [...] "mystery" [...] of God's plan as revealed through Christ. But Paul's discussion of the Cross differs from John's in being less about how it reveals God's glory and more about how it becomes the stumbling block that turns our minds back to God. Paul also describes the Christian life as that of an athlete, demanding practice and training for the sake of the prize; later writers will see in this image a call to ascetical practices.|$|E

[...] "'In Christ,' Cone argues, 'God enters human affairs and takes sides with the oppressed. Their suffering becomes his; their despair, divine despair.'" [...] Cone also argues that, [...] "We cannot solve ethical questions {{of the twentieth century}} by looking at <b>what</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>did</b> in the first.

5000|$|Paul F. Bradshaw {{argues in}} Eucharistic Origins {{that it is}} not until after the 1st century and much later in some areas that the Eucharist and the Last Supper became placed in a {{relation}} of dependence: many Eucharists did not relate to the Paschal mystery and/or the Last Supper. On the other hand, {{in the middle of the}} 1st century Paul the Apostle explicitly placed the celebration of the Lord's Supper in relation to <b>what</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>did</b> on the night he was handed over, in giving his disciples bread with the words [...] "This is my body" [...] and, after the supper, giving them the cup with a similar declaration about his blood.|$|E

5000|$|When JC's Girls {{first started}} {{receiving}} funds from Sandals Church in 2005, {{some of the}} church's members were displeased that their tithes and offerings were being given to strip clubs. In 2006, Brown said that funding the activities of JC's Girls was worthwhile because the sex industry [...] "has been largely ignored by the evangelical church" [...] and the budget allotted to JC's Girls is small compared to the money made by the sex industry. Sandals Church members were also concerned that ministering to strippers would be ineffective. Brown responded by referring to Veitch's conversion, suggesting that other strippers could have similar experiences. Terry Barone of the California Southern Baptist Convention asserted that JC's Girls members [...] "are doing <b>what</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>did</b> ... He ministered to prostitutes and tax collectors." ...|$|E

5000|$|Terry Barone, {{spokesman}} of the California Southern Baptist Convention, {{said that}} JC's Girls members [...] "are doing <b>what</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>did</b> ... He ministered to prostitutes and tax collectors." [...] JC's Girls {{members have been}} criticized for dressing like sex workers, a look that Veitch said is intended to help women in the sex industry identify with the group. A Baptist minister from San Bernardino, California criticized JC's Girls for not explicitly encouraging women in the sex industry to quit, and quoted Matthew 6:24, a Bible verse that states that a person cannot serve two masters. In response to the idea that strippers should quit their jobs before attending a church, Veitch said, [...] "Do we ask gluttons to stop eating too much before they come to church?" [...] Philip Sherwell of the Calgary Herald called the evangelism of JC's Girls [...] "America's most unusual Christian outreach operation".|$|E
5000|$|According to the Synoptic Gospels, Jesus {{referred}} {{to himself as}} [...] "Son of man" [...] in three contexts, {{each with its own}} circle of fairly distinct meanings. He used this self-designation of (1) his earthly work and its (frequently) humble condition (e.g., , 28 parr.; =; =); (2) his coming suffering, death, and resurrection ( [...] ; [...] and, above all, 9:31; 10:33-34 parr.); (3) his future coming in heavenly glory to act with sovereign power at a final judgement (e.g., 13:26-27 parr.; =; see [...] ). These classifications show how the [...] "Son of man" [...] served as a way of indicating Jesus' importance and even universal relevance. This was especially true of the class (3) sayings. In other words, [...] "Son of man" [...] was used to say <b>what</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>did</b> rather than what he was. It was not and did not become a title in the normal sense — at least not on the lips of Jesus himself.|$|E

50|$|The city of Topeka {{played a}} notable {{role in the}} history of American Christianity around the {{beginning}} of the 20th century. Charles Sheldon, a leader in the Social Gospel movement who first used the phrase <b>What</b> would <b>Jesus</b> <b>do?,</b> preached in Topeka. Topeka was also the home to the church of Charles Fox Parham, whom many historians associate with the beginning of the modern Pentecostalism movement.|$|R
5000|$|Jesus and {{the four}} go to Capernaum, which Mark has as Jesus's center of {{activity}} and Jesus teaches in the synagogue on the sabbath. Eventually, in , at the Transfiguration of Jesus, Mark uses the technical term Rabbi, Strong's G4461, meaning a Jewish teacher of Mosaic Law. See also Rabboni. Gathering disciples (students) and teaching are thus {{the first part of}} <b>what</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>does</b> to proclaim the kingdom of God. Mark <b>does</b> not relate <b>what</b> <b>Jesus</b> taught, which could mean he left it out because he did not deem it important enough for his book or because he <b>did</b> not know <b>what</b> <b>Jesus</b> taught there. Some archaeologists believe a synagogue in Capernaum that has been excavated lies on top of the synagogue that existed at this time {{that would have been the}} one Jesus would have gone to. [...] Anyone who showed a sufficient knowledge of the scriptures could preach in the synagogue. [...] Mark says the people thought Jesus taught with [...] "authority", which the scribes did not. The scribes would answer questions in a traditional, official manner, see also Pharisaic Principles and Values. Jesus in Mark operates on no authority but his own judgement. [...] According to [...] Jesus attended the Marriage at Cana before going to Capernaum.|$|R
