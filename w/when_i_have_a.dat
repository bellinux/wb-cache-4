2500|$|Events {{representative}} of cruel treatment of governesses and of women recur throughout [...] Agnes Grey. Additionally, Brontë depicts scenes of cruelty towards animals, {{as well as}} degrading treatment of Agnes. Parallels have been drawn between the oppression of these two groups—animals and females—that are [...] "beneath" [...] the upper class human male. To Anne, the treatment of animals reflected {{on the character of}} the person. This theme of oppression provided social commentary, likely based on Anne's experiences. Twenty years after its publication Lady Amberly commented that [...] "I should like to give it to every family with a governess and shall read it through again <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> governess to remind me to be human." ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> {{mental image}} of a triangle, for example, I don't just {{understand}} that it is a figure bounded by three lines; I also [...] "look at" [...] the lines as though they were present to my mind's eye. [...] And this is what I call having a mental image. When I want to think of a chiliagon, I {{understand that it is}} a figure with a thousand sides as well as I understand that a triangle is a figure with three, but I can't imagine its sides or [...] "look" [...] at them as though they were present (...) Thus I observe that a special effort of mind is necessary to the act of imagination, which is not required to conceiving or understanding (ad intelligendum); and this special exertion of mind clearly shows the difference between imagination and pure intellection (imaginatio et intellectio pura). (Descartes, Meditation VI: On the Existence of Material Objects and the Real Distinction of Mind from Body).|$|E
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> cup {{of coffee}} and some toast which Mary brought to me upon a tray, I arose from my chair.|$|R
6000|$|... "I think," [...] she said, [...] "I {{can answer}} for Mr. Courthorne's silence. Still, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> opportunity, <b>I</b> {{am going to}} lecture you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I {{have sent}} for the men. They {{are among the}} best we have, and {{supported}} me <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> difference with the rest,” he said.|$|R
2500|$|Delhomme {{finished}} {{the game with}} 16 completions out of 33 attempts for 323 yards, three touchdowns, and no interceptions for a passer rating of 113.6. He was seen standing on the field during the Patriots' post-game celebration; he later commented: [...] "I wanted {{to catch up to}} the moment of {{what it feels like to}} be on the other side, to be on this side, the losing side. To let it sink in, to hurt, so when we start practice in the fall, the two-a-days and there are days during the season when I’m tired and I want to go home, but I need to watch that extra film. I want to get back there, but I want to get on the other side of that field. They rope you off, the losing team basically. I just want to get on the other side of that rope. I just wanted to watch and let it sink in and hurt a little bit. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> tough day, I’ll just think about that feeling and it will make me dig down just a little deeper." ...|$|E
6000|$|LORD GORING. Yes, father, but I only {{admit to}} thirty-two—thirty-one {{and a half}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> really good {{buttonhole}}. This buttonhole is not [...] . trivial enough.|$|E
6000|$|... "And Mary, you know, I {{shall be}} able to see you as often as I like;--you and Dr Thorne, too, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> house of my own." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{eyes are}} {{none of the}} best now," [...] {{returned}} the old man a little resentfully, [...] "but the time <b>has</b> been <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> name for my sight!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... [113] <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{mentioned}} to Mr. W. that, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> curacy in Cornwall, I used frequently to carry 'The Excursion' {{down to the}} sea-shore, and read it there. A.D.|$|R
6000|$|That was all, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{forgotten}} all about the conversation until some time afterwards, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> letter from her recalling it. I quote one passage without the alteration of a syllable: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing, at any rate, {{would be}} kept from you. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> thought or a feeling, a hope or a fear, you shall share it. As to money--" ...|$|E
60|$|And as he {{reasoned}} of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come, Felix trembled, and answered, Go thy way for this time; <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> convenient season, I will call for thee.|$|E
6000|$|... "I think so, too, at {{the present}} time," [...] Matteo laughed; [...] "but I don't suppose that I shall be of that opinion <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> family of sons and daughters to marry.|$|E
60|$|There were {{breathing}} spells <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> {{chance to}} converse with the red men beside whom I fought, and once the jeddak, Kulan Tith himself, laid his hand upon my shoulder and asked my name.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{the end of}} THAT game!" [...] said Bert. [...] "No more teuf-teuf-teuf for Bert Smallways {{for a year or}} two. Good-bye 'olidays!... Oh! <b>I</b> {{ought to}} <b>'ave</b> sold the blasted thing <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> chance three years ago." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Dear Dick,' he said, {{taking his}} arm, 'this is neighbourly of you; it shows your tact {{to meet me}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> wish for you. I am in {{pleasant}} spirits; and it is then that I desire a friend.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I know it," [...] said Rollo; [...] "but I always offer {{a little}} more than the regular fare, {{especially}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> lady with me, for then they have not a word to say." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'What!' he yelled, and his {{two eyes}} transfixed me like bayonets. Oh, those dreadful eyes, {{shifting}} from grey to blue, like steel in the sunshine. I can see them now <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> bad dream.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Mary!" [...] said he, {{calling to}} her, but not loudly, before he quite overtook her, [...] "how odd that I should come across you just <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> message for you! {{and why are}} you all alone?" ...|$|E
60|$|I am {{glad you}} like the children, and {{particularly}} glad {{you like the}} pirate. I remember very well <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> general idea of occupying that place in history at the same age. But I loved more desperately than Boldheart.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{the same}} thing," [...] was the reply. [...] "My name is Collanson--but my family always called me 'Anson', <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> family--and by that name I was best known in the mining camps. That is what deceived you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, it was <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> {{letter to}} the customs officer, {{and he said it}} would be all right, and then {{furnished}} me an inspector who opened every piece of my baggage just as if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been one of the wicked." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You're dead right. Fierce is the word. Nev' will {{sleep in}} my duds again, puss. That is, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> reg'lar human bed. Course camping, different. But still---- Let's {{see all the}} funny {{things we can do}} to us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are a man {{of common}} sense," [...] {{declared}} the other. [...] "It would not do. Now comes the time <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> question to ask you. There was a sealed document in this pocket-book. Where is it? What have you done with it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I beg to {{be excused}} at present," [...] said Lord Glenvarloch; [...] "and to be plain, among the {{valuable}} privileges your society has conferred on me, I hope I may reckon that of being private {{in my own}} apartment <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> mind." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear Dick," [...] he said, {{taking his}} arm, [...] "this is neighbourly of you; it shows your tact {{to meet me}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> wish for you. I am in {{pleasant}} spirits; and it is then that I desire a friend." ...|$|R
2500|$|During {{the early}} design and {{development}} {{phase of the}} Macintosh 128K, Wozniak had heavy influence over the project until 1981. In a 2013 interview, Wozniak said that [...] "Steve [...] really took over the project <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> plane crash and wasn't there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{going to}} get that fox if it takes all summer!" [...] exclaimed Farmer Brown's boy. [...] "I ought to have gotten him the other day <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> shot at him. Next time well, we'll see, Mr. Fox, what will happen next time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "More alliteration. No, I don't want Alec and Alonzo <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> {{cold in the}} head. But {{what has}} {{happened}} you two? Now that I look at you closely you seem all lighted up with an internal iridescence. Why, you're actually SHINING! What's up?" ...|$|E
60|$|So that <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> country-house (who can say how soon?) you {{may look}} for grottoes, and cascades, and fountains; nay if you vex me by contradiction, perhaps I may go {{the length of}} a temple--so provoke me not, for you see of what enormities I am capable.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{shall see}} each other again in the body, I trust, though, it may be, not for a long while; for the brethren and sisters at Leeds are desirous to have me for a short space among them, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> door opened me again to leave Snowfield.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> done, after <b>I</b> <b>have</b> said, {{that there}} are some other things, {{concerning}} women, touching which, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> opportunity, <b>I</b> may also give my judgment. But at present, I intreat that these lines be taken in good part, for I seek edification, not contention.|$|R
6000|$|... “It’s {{very hot}} in the sun here, and it was {{yesterday}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> meal,” he said. “Still, I shall find Bernard. Now they’re marching on Santa Marta in open fours. They’re going in—nothing could stop the Sin Verguenza—but you can’t open those gates with a volley. It isn’t necessary.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The first intimation <b>I</b> <b>had</b> of it, Monsieur, {{was three}} months ago, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> letter from an English lawyer in London telling me that my father, Jean Paul Bachelier--that was his name, Monsieur--had died out there and made a will leaving all his money, about one hundred {{thousand}} francs, to me." ...|$|R
