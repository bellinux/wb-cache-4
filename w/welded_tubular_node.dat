40|$|The {{fatigue testing}} of <b>welded</b> <b>tubular</b> <b>nodes</b> and cast steel hybrid nodes under random loading and {{corrosion}} in artificial seawater shows {{clearly that the}} fatigue strength of the cast steel hybrid nodes is superior {{to that of the}} <b>welded</b> <b>tubular</b> <b>nodes.</b> This is related to the advantageous design of the cast steel inserts, as a result of which the high stress concentrations are substantially reduced and the welds transferred to areas of lower and, therefore, noncritical, stresses. The fact that the phase of crack propagation of the <b>tubular</b> <b>nodes</b> is many times longer than the fatigue life to crack initiation, provides a considerable reserve in fatigue design based on crack initiation. This makes it possible to detect damage at an early stage during routine inspections and thus to prevent serious failures. Concerning the design, however, emphasis should in any case be placed primarily on an increase of the fatigue life to crack initiation. In this respect, the use of cast steel inserts is an advantageous possibility...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} a procedure {{to integrate the}} material fracture resistance, quantified by the experimentally measured J-R curve, in the fracture representation of <b>welded</b> <b>tubular</b> joints. This method incorporates a validated η-approach to estimate the elastic-plastic crack driving forces for fatigue cracks initiated at hot-spot locations of the <b>welded</b> <b>tubular</b> joints. The proposed scaling approach predicates on the fundamental assumption that the fracture resistance measured from the J-R curve, with a small and limited amount of crack extension, characterizes the material fracture resistance independent of the specimen geometry. The maximum crack extension allowed in the material testing standard marks the transferability limit of the material J-R curve to the welded joints. The extension of the fatigue crack in the welded joint leads to an increasing fracture resistance and a decreasing load resistance due to the increased crack area. The validation of this approach utilizes load-deformation responses from two scales of experimental specimens: 1) the large-scale <b>welded</b> <b>tubular</b> connection with a fatigue pre-crack; and 2) the large-scale frame test with predominantly fracture failure at the <b>welded</b> <b>tubular</b> joint. The load-deformation relationship based on the proposed scheme {{presents a}} close agreement with the experimentally recorded load-deformation behavior of the <b>welded</b> <b>tubular</b> joints. The proposed approach, when integrated into the push-over analyses of the large-scale tubular frames, presents an accurate estimation on the deformation level at which unstable fracture failure occurs and a conservative prediction of the corresponding failure load...|$|R

40|$|Circular hollow {{sections}} are frequently used in structures subjected to fatigue loading such as bridges, offshore structures and cranes.

40|$|Steel <b>welded</b> <b>tubular</b> joints {{have been}} widely used in traffic signal support {{structures}} for economic and aesthetic reasons. However, they are susceptible to fatigue cracking which may lead to structural failure such as collapse, thus pose a threat to driver's safety. To address this issue, this study is focused on fatigue test, modeling and prognosis of the fatigue crack growth in full-scale <b>welded</b> <b>tubular</b> joints of traffic signal support structures. Fatigue test of six full-scale <b>welded</b> <b>tubular</b> joint specimens fabricated based on real design for signal support structure is conducted to obtain crack growth data. Details of test setup and results are reported in this dissertation. Two types of fatigue crack growth models are proposed for two regimes of fatigue crack development in <b>welded</b> <b>tubular</b> joints: the linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) model for the slow crack growth regime (denoted as Stage II here) and the empirical failure model for the rapid crack growth regime (denoted as Stage III). Details of these two models including their mathematical expressions, stochastic parameters, sensitivity analysis and model application, are given in the dissertation. A sensor-driven structural health prognosis procedure that has an explicit stochastic measurement error term and thus can model the sensor performance degradation over monitoring period is proposed. The prognosis procedure involves the Bayesian theorem and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling for updating the structural degradation model using sensor data. An extreme value theory (EVT) based tail fitting method is proposed to reduce the heavy burden on data transmission and computing involved in sensor driven prognosis. This method employs moment estimator to calculate the small quantiles of the prognosis results by using a small portion of available sensor data. Finally, fatigue test data acquired in this study are used to examine the proposed fatigue life prognosis procedure. Both the LEFM based fatigue crack growth model and the empirical failure model are studied for fatigue life prognosis application. Prognosis results show that the prognosis procedure is able to provide good estimate of the fatigue crack growth curve of <b>welded</b> <b>tubular</b> joints in signal support structures if certain conditions are met...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{the present}} {{research}} is to investigate the fatigue behaviour of friction stir (FS) <b>welded</b> <b>tubular</b> joints in aluminium alloy subjected to torsional fatigue loading. To manufacture the samples which were tested, an MTS I-STIR process development system was equipped with a retracting tool specifically designed for these <b>tubular</b> <b>welds.</b> Al 6082 -T 6 FS welded samples were tested under cyclic torsion with a nominal shear stress ratio equal to- 1 and 0. The test data show that, strictly speaking, the presence of non-zero mean shear stresses has a detrimental effect on the overall torsional fatigue strength of the FS welded joints. However, the reanalysis discussed in the present paper suggests that, from a statistical point of view, any detrimental effect is small. This means that fatigue assessment under torsional fatigue loading of these FS <b>welded</b> <b>tubular</b> connections can be performed with little loss of accuracy by neglecting the presence of non-zero mean shear stresses...|$|R

40|$|Marine risers {{that connect}} the surface {{floating}} facilities and the subsea wells are generally made of heavy duty girth <b>welded</b> <b>tubulars.</b> When experience dynamic loads, weld defects {{can cause the}} marine risers to fail prematurely due to fatigue cracks initiation. In order to investigate the fatigue performance of marine risers, a fatigue test system was designed. The components of the test setup part and the data measurement part were described. A mathematical model of free massive beam is built to find the natural frequencies and natural modes of the testing specimen of marine riser to guide the test. Adding end masses is an effective method to control the natural modes and stress amplitude. Based on this system, the fatigue performance of a specimen of marine riser with flange joint is evaluated and the principle and process of the test were illustrated. The mathematical model was used to predict the lateral displacement and the bending moment of the excitated specimen.

Stress concentrations in the offshore structures usually occur at the intersections of tubular joints.
