5|$|After traffic issues {{during the}} 2008 {{reconstruction}} {{work on the}} <b>Wheeling</b> Tunnel, local politicians suggested closing the twin tunnels altogether and building the freeway over <b>Wheeling</b> Hill instead. After opposition from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, which represented the affected <b>Wheeling</b> Hill residents, the suggestions were dropped. The cost of completing the tunnel replacement project was estimated at between $60 and $80million. The total $13.7million cost of the tunnel reconstruction project was over double the original bid of $5.7million, {{due in part to}} the work delays.|$|E
5|$|I-470 {{enters the}} city limits of <b>Wheeling</b> and Ohio County, West Virginia; the Greater <b>Wheeling</b> Trail, a rail trail, passes under the freeway as I-470 {{approaches}} a three-level diamond interchange with US250 and WV2. The concurrent highways connect to downtown <b>Wheeling</b> {{in the north and}} Benwood to the south. I-70 climbs from the banks of the river into more woodlands before an interchange with West Bethlehem Boulevard, which provides access to the village of the same name to the south. Continuing easterly, I-470 comes to its end at an incomplete interchange with its parent, I-70, over <b>Wheeling</b> Creek near Elm Grove and {{to the north of the}} J.B. Chambers Youth Sports Complex and <b>Wheeling</b> Skate Park. Traffic from I-470 can only access eastbound I-70, and only traffic traveling westbound on I-70 can access I-470. The eastern branch of the Greater <b>Wheeling</b> Trail, which parallels the creek, passes underneath I-470 as it merges into I-70.|$|E

The <b>Wheeling</b> Tunnel was closed for reconstruction work in 2007, 2008, and 2010, causing motorists who wished to travel through on I-70 to detour. The two detour routes were city streets in downtown <b>Wheeling</b> and the I-470 loop.|$|E

This is expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic (AADT), which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. In 2009, WVDOT calculated that 60,070vehicles used the Fort Henry Bridge over the main channel of the Ohio River.

5|$|Polyaenus's {{accounts}} {{have led}} some modern historians to tentatively propose the following {{synthesis of the}} battle.

On the Greek left, the Athenians followed Philip, their line becoming stretched and disordered; the Macedonians then turned, attacked and routed the tired and inexperienced Athenians. The Greek right wing, under the assault of the Macedonian troops under Alexander's command, then also routed, ending the battle.|$|E
