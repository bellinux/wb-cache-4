40|$|Em área de Latossolo Roxo, localizada na Estação Experimental "Theodureto de Camargo", em Campinas, verificou-se incidência de doença provocando "murcha", com sintomas internos caracterizados pelo escurecimento dos vasos, sucessivamente em plantas de labelabe e em algodoeiro. Em ambas as espécies vegetais determinou-se a presença de fungos do gênero Fusarium, mediante isolamento feito em plantas doentes. Seleções, feitas na referida área, de plantas pertencentes a linhagem de algodoeiro suscetível à murcha de Fusariumderam origem a linhagens que revelaram apreciável resistência quando testadas em solo infestado por Fusarium oxysporum f. vasinfectum (Atk.) Snyder & Hansen. São discutidos aspectos relacionados com a possível descoberta de nova fonte genética de resistência à doença e com a existência desse fungo sob infestação natural na Estação Experimental mencionada. Também é apontada a possibilidade de serem o algodoeiro e a leguminosa em questão hospedeiras do mesmo agente patogênico. The {{occurrence}} of wilt disease, successively in plants of hyacinth bean (Dolichos lablab L.) and cotton, {{was observed in}} a plot of latosolic B (Terra Roxa) soil at the "Theodureto de Camargo" Experiment Station at Campinas, where no Fusarium wilt has been recorded before. Both species presented internal symptoms consisting in darkened vessels. Fungi of the genus Fusarium were isolated from these plants. Plant selection for wilt resistance {{was made in the}} above mentioned area where a Fusarium - susceptible variety (IAG 51 / 1104) of cotton had been planted. The progenies when tested in soils infested by Fusarium oxysporum f. vasinfectum Atk.) Snyder & Hansen revealed fair resistance to wilt. IAG 51 / 1104 comes from a cross between the varieties Delfos and Delta Pineland- 10, both wilt susceptible under field conditions of the State of São Paulo. It is likely that the wilt resistance of some of its progeny might have originated by recombination. It is also pointed out that the <b>wilting</b> <b>agent</b> (F. oxysporum f. vasinfectum) might occur in the "Theodureto de Camargo", Experiment Station and be responsible for the wilt in hyacinth bean and cotton plants...|$|E
40|$|Rapid growth rate, {{prolific}} fruiting and {{vegetative reproduction}} from root sprouts, ready germination and extended root system, allelopathic effects, resistance to herbivory combined to tolerance to environmentally stressful {{conditions such as}} infertile sites, make Ailanthus altissima (Mill.) Swingle (also known as Heaven tree, Simaroubaceae) a noxious and highly invasive tree in all countries {{where it has been}} introduced and is become naturalized. After a brief historical trait {{of the importance of the}} presence of this plant and the complexity of eradication campaigns based on manual cutting and herbicide treatments, the note illustrates the possible role as a candidate mycoherbicide of a soilborne fungal <b>wilt</b> <b>agent</b> (Verticillium nonalfalfae H.

40|$|In 1999 – 2007 {{after the}} {{mycological}} analysis of rhizosphere of plants grown in sections of greenhouses of Kaunas Botanical Garden of Vytautas Magnus University, it was isolated and identified 115 fungi species belonging to 36 genera, 3 families, 3 ranges, 3 classes and 3 divisions (described {{according to the}} system of P. M. Kirk et al. (2001)). The least amount of fungi was isolated from substrata of cool subtropic section: 43 species belonging to 23 genera; and the bigest amount – from substrata of humid tropics section: 58 species, 19 genera. Penicillium genus fungi had dominated, it had diversity of 39 species, detection frequency – 72 %. More rarely there were detected Mortierella (isolated 6 species, 33 %), Aspergillus (8; 29 %), Mucor (7; 23 %), Acremonium (6; 13 %) genus fungi. There were isolated potential root rot and <b>wilt</b> <b>agents</b> from Fusarium (7 species), Verticillium (2) Pythium (2) genus...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of tissue nitrogen concentration, as a consequence of nitrogen supply rate, on the susceptibility of tomato plants to three pathogens. We varied tissue N concentration by supplying N at different rates by adding nitrate in different, exponentially increasing amounts to the nutrient solution on which the tomato plants were grown. Separate experiments were carried out to test susceptibility of tomato plants to the bacterial speck-causing Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato, to the <b>wilt</b> <b>agent</b> Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici and to tomato powdery mildew caused by Oidium lycopersicum. The effect of tissue N concentration appeared to be highly pathogen-dependent: there was no effect on susceptibility to F. oxysporum, but susceptibility to P. syringae and O. lycopersicum increased significantly with increasing N concentration. We have previously demonstrated the opposite for susceptibility to Botrytis cinerea: decreasing susceptibility with increasing N concentration. The apparent contradictory effects are discussed in relation to the effect of N supply on both the nutritional value of the plant tissue to the pathogen and on the concentration of resistance-related compounds. We conclude that the effect of changing both characteristics on disease susceptibility is highly pathogen-specific and is probably dependent on differences in resource requirements of the pathogen or the sensitivity of the pathogen to plant resistance reactions or on both these factors...|$|R
40|$|Ralstonia solanacearum (race 3 biovar 2) is a {{bacterial}} <b>wilt</b> causal <b>agent</b> of many plant species. Infects (potatoes Solanum tuberosum, eggplant Solanum melongena, peppers Capsicum annuum, tomatoes Lycopersicon esculentum, geraniums, Geranium carolinianum, ginger Zingiber officinale {{and a few}} weed species including bittersweet Celastrus orbiculatus, nightshade Solanum karsense and stinging nettle Urtica dioica. Ralstonia solanacearum can be infectious in the soil for years {{in the presence of}} a host. Race 3 biovar 2 is most commonly transmitted by contaminated soil, equipment, water and insect, or by transplantation of infected seeds or seedlings. Management requires use of resistance cultivars, clean and certified seed, good cultural practices, some chemicals fumigation, antagonistic microbes as a biological control like (Mycorrhizal fungi, Streptomyces sp. and Tricoderma sp.) transgenic resistant plant, cropping systems, soil amendments, integrated control, genetically engineered antagonistic and virulent mutants of R. solanacearum...|$|R
40|$|A pot {{study was}} aimed to {{investigate}} the role of tomato in determining differential response to bacterial <b>wilt</b> causal <b>agent</b> Ralstonia solanacearum pathogen and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) Glomus mosseae. Disease severity was measured after 10, 20 and 30 days of plant growth. The pathogen and dual treatment (R. solanacearum with G. mosseae) {{were not significantly different}} {{at the end of this}} experiment. Soil pH was greatly influencing the pathogen and AMF microbe. Glomus mosseae mycorrhizosphere was more alkaline (pH 5. 9) compared to the pathogen mycorrhizosphere (pH 4. 9). The concentration of bacterial cell in the R. solancearum soil was not different from the dual treatment after 60 days of plant growth. Spore germination was influenced by the interaction between the soil pathogen and AMF. Spores number in the dual treatment at 60 days was less than the original number added. Root colonization percentage in G. mosseae (61 %) was significantly more than the dual treatment (16 %). This provide an evidence about the role of plant host in increasing the spores germination influenced by many substances produced by the host root (root exudates). The results demonstrated that the role of plant in determination the relationship between soil-borne pathogen and antagonistic microbe was critical...|$|R
40|$|Late <b>wilt</b> (causal <b>agent</b> Harpophora maydis), with initial {{symptoms}} appearing around flowering, {{has become}} frequent in maize {{fields of the}} Iberian Peninsula. The geographical distribution of the pathogen in the main maize - growing areas in the South of Portugal and Spain was determined by prospecting 59 fields from 2009 to 2013. Among all the isolates of H. maydis identified, 14 isolates were molecularly confirmed by ITS amplification, and their pathogenic traits (i. e. aggressiveness) were analyzed by inoculation of the maize susceptible cultivar PR 32 W 86 grown in pots under shade-house conditions for the whole growing season. One of the isolates was highly aggressive, causing intense symptoms as well as significant reductions in weight of both aboveground parts and roots. Moderately aggressive isolates caused significantly high disease values {{but not all of}} them were related to reductions in plant weight. The infection by H. maydis was monitored by measurements of canopy temperature and crop water stress index of maize. Canopy temperature was assessed in potted control plants and in plants inoculated with the most aggressive isolate in two experiments conducted outdoors in 2012 and 2013. Both indices responded to the presence of fungal infection in both years, which was detected up to 17 days before development of symptoms in the plants. This study shows the wide distribution of H. maydis in the Iberian Peninsula and highlights the importance of genetic resistance for controlling the pathogen in southern Europe. In addition, the thermal detection of the infection prior to symptom development might lead to useful applications of non-destructive pre-symptomatic disease diagnosis in controlling late wilt disease in maize.
