For example, the button to {{exit from the}} MIDI editor is labelled [...] "naff off", while the button to exit the file display is labelled with a sheep saying [...] "Baa!"; the <b>waveform</b> <b>editor</b> colour cycles the words [...] "Dead cool" [...] above the waveform display, and the event sequencer displays an icon of a camel smoking a cigarette; and the image manipulation tool has a series of icons used to indicate how long the current operation is going to take: [...] "Make the tea", [...] "Have a fag", [...] "Go to bed", [...] "Go to sleep", [...] "Go on holiday", [...] "Go to Peru for six months", and [...] "RIP"; and the scripting language command to set the length of drawn lines is [...] "LLAMA". (The manual states: [...] "I could have called the command LINELENGTH I suppose, but I like llamas so what the heck".) ...|$|E

The system combines multi-touch and tangible interaction techniques in order to implement the metaphor of a toolkit that allows direct manipulation of a sound sample.

50|$|The {{software}} used {{to process}} the resulting digital files ranges in price from {{thousands of dollars to}} freeware. Some of these applications are simple, and some are very complex. Many are general purpose <b>waveform</b> <b>editors</b> that also happen to include record restoration features or plugins, and others are dedicated to the sole purpose of record restoration. Moreover, some applications are designed for easy fast processing with the push of a few buttons, and others require a time-consuming but perhaps more exact manual approach to editing out damage. Most applications present a waveform display, but a few are basically noise and click-pop filters that provide no visual display at all. All record restoration applications for Windows work directly upon WAV files, but a few will also directly open files in other formats, such as MP3.|$|R
50|$|Alchemy was a <b>waveform</b> audio <b>editor,</b> {{originally}} developed by Blank Software and subsequently purchased by Passport, that integrated Macintosh computers with most current digital sampler brands {{that supported the}} MIDI Sample Dump Standard, including Akai, Casio, E-mu, Ensoniq, Korg, Kurzweil, Peavey and Roland. Later versions allowed users to create a sound library that could be shared those sounds across multiple sampler formats. The final version, version 3.0, was released in 1996.|$|R
40|$|This work {{describes}} {{the use of}} the MLS (Maximum Length Sequence) signal for the measurement of impulse responses, in alternative to the traditional techniques based on the use of impulsive sources. The mathematical theory for the generation of the MLS signal and for the deconvolution of the system’s impulse response are first described. Then a software implementation of the measurement method, based on the creation of plug-ins for a shareware <b>waveform</b> <b>editor</b> on a low cost PC is demonstrated. Some preliminary experiments conducted under controlled conditions show that the proposed technique produces images of the bottom profile with higher signal-to-noise ratio and better spatial resolution than those obtainable with the impulsive technique. Furthermore, the new technique seems superior also for some practical aspects connected with {{the very nature of the}} MLS signals, which makes it almost inaudible and makes the sound source barely localizable: this is very important for military applications...|$|E
40|$|Digital image {{processing}} is an ever expanding and dynamic area with applications reaching out into everyday life such as medicine, space exploration, surveillance, authentication, automated industry inspection {{and many more}} areas. Applications such as these involve different processes like image enhancement and object detection. Implementing such applications on a general purpose computer can be easier, but not very time efficient due to additional constraints on memory and other peripheral devices. Hardware implementation for application specific can offer much greater speed than a software implementation. With the advancement in the Very Large Scale of Integration (VLSI) technology hardware implementation has become an attractive alternative. Implementing complex computation tasks on hardware and by exploiting parallelism and pipelining in algorithms yield significant reduction in execution times. It has been observed {{that most of the}} work has been done either in C and JAVA. No work has been done in the VHDL to design and develop the chip for image enhancement algorithms. Intensity transformation is used to enhance the size of image pixels. The chip design for 2 D and 3 D image enhancement is done in Xilinx 14. 2 software. Image enhanced values are verified with the help of <b>waveform</b> <b>editor</b> o...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Techniques {{based on}} {{impulsive}} sources are used {{since the beginning}} of the Underwater Acoustic science, to evaluate the distance of objects and to plot the profile of the sea bottom. In this paper the authors investigate the behavior of three not-impulsive techniques for the measurement of impulse responses: MLS (Maximum Length Sequence) signal, linear sine sweep and logarithmic sine sweep. This work will focus the attention on advantages and defects of these tree different methods, in comparison with the traditional pulse-based sonar techniques. The mathematical theory for the generation of the MLS, sine sweep signals and for the deconvolution of the system’s impulse response are first described. Then a software implementation of the measurement methods, based on the creation of plug-ins for a shareware <b>waveform</b> <b>editor,</b> running on a low cost PC is demonstrated. Some experiments conducted under controlled conditions and in the sea show that the proposed techniques produce images of the bottom profile with higher signal-to-noise ratio and better spatial resolution than those obtainable with the impulsive technique. Moreover signal-to-noise ratio increases using sine sweep signal instead of MLS one. The new techniques seem superior also for some practical aspects connected with their very nature, which make them almost inaudible and makes the sound source barely localizable: this is very important for military applications...|$|E
