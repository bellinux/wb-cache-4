2500|$|The verb [...] "Wyatting" [...] {{appeared}} in some blogs and music magazines {{to describe the}} practice of playing unusual tracks, in particular songs from Wyatt's album Dondestan, on a pub jukebox to annoy the other pub goers. Wyatt was quoted in 2006 in The Guardian as saying [...] "I think it's really funny" [...] and [...] "I'm very honoured {{at the idea of}} becoming a verb." [...] When asked if he would ever try it himself, he said: [...] "I don't really like disconcerting people, but even <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> be normal I disconcert anyway." [...] However, Alfreda Benge said it made her angry [...] "that Robert should be used as a means of clever dicks asserting their superiority in pubs ... It's so unlike Robert, because he's so appreciative of the strengths of pop music. So that, I think, is a real unfairness. The man who coined it, I should like to punch him in the nose." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{know not}} what I think. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> think {{on these things}} my mind gets confused. Only this am I sure of--that they are, they must be, the {{wonderful}} works of the Good Spirit." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That’s me, ma’am," [...] {{said the}} gentleman mentioned, {{shaking his head}} despairingly. [...] "That’s Bill Brisket all over. I come blundering in, {{and the first thing}} I do is to blurt out secrets; then, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> smooth it over——" ...|$|E

60|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> be measured, I {{find myself}} usually {{suspected}} of a sneaking unkindness for my subject; {{but you may}} be sure, sir, I would give up most other things to be so good a man as Thoreau. Even my knowledge of him leads me thus far.|$|E
6000|$|... "What is {{the matter}} with this old head of mine!" [...] he murmured. [...] "Sometimes I feel as if I had a regular {{windmill}} inside of it. And <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> study it gets to be a regular blank. Something is wrong, that's certain. What is it?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I don't {{know about}} Shylock, but I'm blessed if I think you suit me {{very well at}} anything.
