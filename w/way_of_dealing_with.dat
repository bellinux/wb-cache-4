5|$|Today, vector {{spaces are}} applied {{throughout}} mathematics, science and engineering. They are the appropriate linear-algebraic notion {{to deal with}} systems of linear equations; offer a framework for Fourier expansion, which is employed in image compression routines; or provide an environment {{that can be used}} for solution techniques for partial differential equations. Furthermore, vector spaces furnish an abstract, coordinate-free <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> geometrical and physical objects such as tensors. This in turn allows the examination of local properties of manifolds by linearization techniques. Vector spaces may be generalized in several ways, leading to more advanced notions in geometry and abstract algebra.|$|E
5|$|As {{with most}} bats, the little brown bat is mostly active {{at night and}} leaves its roost at dusk and {{the next two or}} three hours are peak {{activity}} periods. They are also active before dawn. Since little brown bats live in a temperate zone, they must find some <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> winter. Most temperate bats either migrate or hibernate, but little brown bats do both. In summer, the males and females live apart, the females raise the young. When fall comes, both sexes fly south to a hibernaculum, where they mate and then hibernate. Little brown bats undergo a prolonged period of hibernation during the winter due to the lack of food. They hibernate in caves as a community.|$|E
5|$|At high Reynolds numbers, {{typical of}} {{full-sized}} aircraft, {{it is desirable}} to have a laminar boundary layer. This results in a lower skin friction due to the characteristic velocity profile of laminar flow. However, the boundary layer inevitably thickens and becomes less stable as the flow develops along the body, and eventually becomes turbulent, the process known as boundary layer transition. One <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> this problem is to suck the boundary layer away through a porous surface (see Boundary layer suction). This can reduce drag, but is usually impractical due to its mechanical complexity and the power required to move the air and dispose of it. Natural laminar flow techniques push the boundary layer transition aft by reshaping the aerofoil or fuselage so that its thickest point is more aft and less thick. This reduces the velocities in the leading part and the same Reynolds number is achieved with a greater length.|$|E

5|$|Finally, in November 1945, Cariappa {{was made}} the {{commander}} of the Bannu Frontier Brigade in Waziristan. It was during this time that Colonel Ayub Khan – later Field Marshal and President of Pakistan (1962–1969) – served under him. Unlike previous British commanders who tried to keep the local tribes under control by force, Cariappa tried a different approach by extending them friendly relations which worked well. When Head of the Interim Government, Jawaharlal Nehru, visited Bannu he found it extremely peaceful and settled, compared to Razmak where another brigade was stationed. Nehru was impressed by Cariappa's <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> the tribes. He was also widely acclaimed for his treatment of the Indian National Army's (INA) prisoners. When Cariappa visited one of the camps that held INA prisoners, he was moved by the conditions in which they lived. He immediately wrote to the Adjutant General recommending that their living conditions be improved and to pardon some of those who were not guilty. These included Colonel Prem Kumar Sahgal, Gurbaksh Singh Dhillon and Shah Nawaz Khan. Cariappa pointed out that these prisoners had considerable support from the Indian leaders, who would later rule the country. This led the British to release most of the prisoners.|$|E

25|$|Weber {{demonstrated}} rationalization in The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism, {{in which}} the aims of certain Protestant Theologies, particularly Calvinism, are shown to have shifted towards rational means of economic gain as a <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> their 'salvation anxiety'. The rational consequences of this doctrine, he argued, soon grew incompatible with its religious roots, and so the latter were eventually discarded. Weber continues his investigation into this matter in later works, notably in his studies on bureaucracy and on the classifications of authority. In these works he alludes to an inevitable move towards rationalization.|$|E

The Trade Unions rejected continued pay restraint and in a succession of strikes over the winter of 1978/79 (known as the Winter of Discontent) secured higher pay, although it had virtually paralysed the country, tarnished Britain's political reputation and seen the Conservatives surge ahead in the opinion polls.|$|E

An affront to a Southerner's honor, if serious enough, was resolved by a duel. Dueling was originally a European custom, later adopted by the United States. Dueling was not technically legal in the United States, but {{it was difficult to}} enforce the laws written against it, especially in the Old South. Usually only men engaged in duels; their opponents were men they perceived to be equals. Public opinion for dueling varied: some thought it was a barbaric and backwards custom, while others believed it was a perfectly legitimate <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> affronts to honor.|$|E

The formation of Local 77 was directed towards improving work conditions for the working class employees, {{most of whom were}} African-American. Members fought for minimum wage increases, improvements in working conditions, and medical benefits for employees. The union members of Local 77 demanded a systematic <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> workplace complaints that were impartial to the Duke University administration. Because the majority of the union's members were African-American, several of the goals overlapped with the ideas of the Civil Rights Movement.|$|E

25|$|On 16 May, seven Egyptian {{soldiers}} were kidnapped by unknown militants in the Sinai demanding {{the release of}} members of an Islamist group detained for almost two years.

40|$|This project {{concerns}} men’s {{understandings of}} help and crisis, and their <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> crisis. Research show {{that men have}} a tendency to ignore problems and symptoms in connection to crisis, and that they often abstain from seeking professional help. To provide an understanding of this issue, it will be investigated how gender specific socialization and cultural norms, in relation to masculinity, can have an impact on men’s understanding of what constitutes symptoms and crisis, and their understanding of help. For a critical overview of how men and masculinity is framed we will use theory including Raewyn Connells concept of “Hegemonic masculinity” and Michael Kimmels descriptions in “Misframing men”. To provide an understanding of what characterizes masculine <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> crisis, the project will draw from different experts and informants and their experiences in the field. The analysis will be contextualized with the institutional possibilities men have in order to seek help. In this aspect the focus will be on how professional help and efforts aimed towards men, address and articulate men and masculinity in order to attract men to seek help. These two positions will be analyzed and investigated in relation to each other, to provide a contextual and social constructionist examination and understanding of men in crisis and their possibilities to handle these crises in correspondence with their idea of masculinity. This project concludes that men often have gender specific <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> their issues and crisis. These ways are highly affected by masculine ideals and social norms. However, these ways can both be perceived as positive and negative. Sometimes men ignore and retain from acknowledging their crisis, and in other instances men have a more action-oriented approach in <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> their crisis. This leaves a need to address gender specific barriers in relation to understand men’s possibilities to seek help and <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> crisis. Furthermore it is necessary that the help being offered accommodate men’s <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> crisis and their expression of symptoms, both in design and advertisement, without reproducing traditional masculine stereotypes...|$|R
