40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} the {{problematic}} areas of rewarding of employees. However, {{it is not possible}} to explore this area only from accounting viewpoint. It is necessary to take into account the context and the currenet law in force at 1. 1. 2012. The aim of this thesis is to find the optimal reward system both in terms of employees, and from the perspective of the employer. The employer is trying to reduce labor costs and also to motivate and retain quality and loyality of employees. Today, in addition to <b>wages</b> <b>employee</b> also expects other monetary or non-monetary benefits that have an impact on his professional and personal development. Therefore it is necessary to find a compromise between employee's demands and objectives of employers. The partical part summarizes the findings from previous theoretical work parts into a complex example, where creative approaches are demonstrated which in real life are used in rewarding of employees...|$|E

40|$|Nursing {{shortages}} {{are common}} {{despite the fact}} that nurses earn far higher wages than other college-educated women. Our analysis addresses the puzzle of ‘‘high’ ’ nursing <b>wages.</b> <b>Employee</b> data from the Current Population Survey are matched with detailed job descriptors from the Occupational Information Network. Nursing requires high levels of compensable skills and demanding working conditions. Standard log wage regression estimates indicate nursing wage advantages of about 40 %. Accounting for job attributes reduces estimates to roughly 20 %. Rather than transforming ordinary least squares log gaps to percentages, alternative methods measuring Mincerian gaps produce estimates of 15 % or less. We conclude that nurses receive compensation that is much closer to opportunity costs than that seen in standard analyses, narrowing the shortage puzzle. Supply constraints in nurse licensing can produce wages above long-run opportunity costs but that are too low to clear short-run labor markets during periods of growing demand. The analysis provides broader implications for the conduct of wage analyses. JEL Classification: I 12, J 31, J 44 1...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{tries to}} obtain {{a better understanding of}} how selection effects can affect the analysis of human resource management practices or employee participation. The effects of works councils and selected personnel measures in German firms are analysed, where selection on observable and unobservable factors is controlled for by using matching techniques and difference-in-differences. Chapter 2 shows that works councils are rather implemented in firms where employees are afraid of losing their job but also in firms with relatively high wages. The introduction of a works council has no effect on several outcomes like <b>wages,</b> <b>employee</b> turnover and overtime work, but a positive effect on workers’ perceived job security. Thus, the aim of works councils seems to be rent protection rather than rent seeking. In Chapter 3 the effects of profit sharing on productivity are analysed. As profit sharing means that wages directly depend on the firm’s performance, incentive effects are expected. The study shows that – although profit sharing positively affects productivity - effects are overestimated if selection is not taken into account. Profit sharing can also affect different outcomes, e. g. investments in human capital, which is analysed in Chapter 4. The results indicate that firms which introduce profit sharing have a higher increase in training intensity compared to firms without profit sharing. However, this is only the case if the majority of employees participate in profits. Chapter 5 shows how training can affect workers’ labour market success. Older and younger workers have different aims when participating in training which also reflects in different effects. Younger participants profit from training by an increase in wages whereas older participants experience an increase in perceived job security...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} project seeks {{to determine the}} causative factors behind the exceptionally high employee turnover rates in the Irish hospitality industry. For a long time now, the Irish hospitality industry has been characterised by high numbers of employees opting to abandon their jobs. This translates negatively on the various companies in this crucial industry as they constantly have to spend significant amounts of resources on hiring new employees to replace {{the ones who have}} left. This is a costly procedure that is consuming potential profits for these companies. This project will identify the main reasons as to why more employees are quitting their job. To do this, the research will focus on getting vital insights from past hotel employees in the Irish hospitality industry. The decision to settle on this target population was based on the need to promote honesty in the responses provided. The {{research project}} will also incorporate a comprehensive review of past literature on this topic. This will introduce the perceptions and opinions of other past researchers into the study. Moreover, these past researchers will contribute towards the topic through their literature. The quantitative research method will be utilised in this project to help further comprehend the research question. An ontology approach will also be adopted since human nature {{plays a major role in}} influencing the behaviour of employees in the Irish hospitality sector. In the end, three factors were determined to cause the high employee turnover rates in this sector. They include; low levels of employee motivation, inadequate wages and finally, work-life balance. These three factors have to be adequately addressed to boost the employee retention rates in the Irish hospitality industry. The research project has outlined a variety of recommendations that these companies should consider to make this happen, including, regular periodic training, better <b>wages,</b> <b>employee</b> recognition and much more...|$|E

30|$|For {{the sample}} of women, there is no {{significant}} impact of the enforcement measure on the chances of being a formal <b>wage</b> <b>employee</b> with respect to being a self-employed worker (column 2 of Table 7). This evidence indicates that women who were receiving mandated benefits and lose their jobs do not switch to self-employment, i.e., they move to informal firms where they continue being <b>wage</b> <b>employees</b> but without mandated benefits. Results also show an increase in the probability of informal wage employment with respect to self-employment (column 3 of Table 7). Self-employed women try to obtain a job as <b>wage</b> <b>employees</b> when enforcement increases, even when the impact on women is a reduction in the coverage of mandated benefits. This result can be interpreted as the expectation of obtaining a formal position in the future. Because formal firms’ demand is falling both for formal and informal female <b>wage</b> <b>employees</b> (scale effect), self-employed women switch to wage employment in informal firms.|$|R
30|$|Results reveal very {{different}} {{effects of an}} increase in the degree of enforcement on the compliance level and other labor market outcomes among men and women. Higher enforcement leads firms to increase compliance with labor regulation among men. The shares of male <b>wage</b> <b>employees</b> covered by social security (pensions and health insurance) and employment regulations (annual extra monthly wage, paid vacation time, paid sickdays, wage equal or above the minimum and working hours equal or below the legal maximum) increase at the province-sector level, i.e., firms substitute formal <b>wage</b> <b>employees</b> for informal <b>wage</b> <b>employees.</b> Formal <b>wages</b> increase, informal wages decline, and self-employed men become wage earners {{to take advantage of the}} increase in the provision of mandated benefits. Among women, higher enforcement leads to a reduction in the provision of mandated benefits at the province-sector level. The scale effect dominates among them, and the decline in formal firms’ demand for formal and informal female <b>wage</b> <b>employees</b> leads to formal and informal wage reductions for women (although not significant for formal wages). Laid-off women move to informal firms where they do not receive mandated benefits and self-employed women become informal <b>wage</b> <b>employees,</b> probably attracted by the probability of obtaining better employment conditions in the future due to higher enforcement. All these findings are in line with the functioning of a two-sector economy model with competitive markets and no rigidities.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{provides}} {{an analysis of}} the role and effectiveness of unions in selecting their strategy {{to meet the needs of}} their members in developing countries – in this case Indonesia after the late Soeharto regime stepped down in 1998. In particular, the focus of the research is to understand how the selection of particular union strategies might influence union effectiveness in the context of developing economies. The research involves a major empirical study of unions based on a comprehensive analytical framework. The study finds its relevance in providing both theoretical and practical strategies for unions operating in a constraining political environment and in an era where the power of unions in general has been sharply diminishing. Based on various theoretical models of union strategy, the thesis develops a measure that explores union strategy from the initial stage of strategy creation - namely the establishment of union aims - through the process of strategy-development, resulting in the forms of union methods and tactics that are used in day-to-day union operations. The thesis also develops a model of organisational effectiveness that enables a comprehensive picture of union effectiveness. The model was operationalised by the use of a survey questionnaire. The fieldwork was conducted between the period of January to June 2005 in enterprise unions in the services sector. Responses from 100 unions were analysed using multiple regression techniques. The results yielded five independent variables that contributed significantly to the prediction of union effectiveness. Those variables included partnership between unions and management, the use of innovation and training for empowering union members, setting up specific departments for dealing with industrial and organisational issues, and attempts to gain external support for strengthening unions’ negotiations with management. Altogether, these factors explained 65 % of the variability in union effectiveness. Some important findings emerged from subsequent case studies that involved seven eligible unions. The most effective unions placed a strong emphasis on political goals by participating in the process of policy formulation both at the workplace and beyond the enterprise boundary. They employed both arbitration practices and relationships with political institutions to support their collective bargaining. A combination of tactical approaches including industrial action, provision of member services and use of information and communications technologies were used together with contemporary campaign themes such as workplace improvement and productivity. The most effective unions faced environments that discouraged workers from participating, including the existence of competitive <b>wages,</b> <b>employee</b> involvement plans, and covert anti-union strategies from companies. The results suggest that “consultancy” unionism is the dominant approach adopted by Indonesian unions in the services sector. This approach involves servicing members and developing only limited engagement with employers. Turning “consultancy” unionism into “partnership” unionism appears to be the most promising, approach to increased union effectiveness in the Indonesian context. To implement such a strategy, Indonesian unions have to strengthen their commitment to providing resources for organising, to boost participation among their members, and subsequently to construct a partnership based on “the collective power of workers”. The research has implications for unions, employers, and the state. For unions, the advantage of committing to establish a culture of organising builds a foundation for delivering a multi-tactical approach. However, in light of the limited strength of union power, that objective may best be achieved through partnership with employers. The findings concerning partnership strategies provide strong support for the government’s efforts at establishing industrial peace. Future comparative research to replicate this work in manufacturing industry or other countries in which enterprise unionism is the dominant union structure is to be encourage...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the earnings premiums associated with {{different types of}} employment in 73 countries.

Fewer than 10 % are formal employees, and only 2 % of workers in low income countries are employers or own-account professionals.

Across all regions and income levels, non-professional own-account workers and informal <b>wage</b> <b>employees</b> face an earnings penalty compared to formal <b>wage</b> <b>employees.</b> But in low income countries, this earnings penalty is small, and non-professional own-account workers earn a positive premium relative to all <b>wage</b> <b>employees.</b> Earnings penalties for non-professional own account workers tend to increase with GDP and are largest for female workers in high income countries.

For the sample of women, the effect is negative and significant at a 10 % level. The share of female <b>wage</b> <b>employees</b> receiving social security contributions at the province-sector level falls 1.7 percentage points for each 10 % increase in enforcement.

30|$|The {{findings}} revealed heterogenous {{effects of}} an increase in enforcement at the province-sector level on compliance and other labor outcomes among men and women. Higher enforcement leads firms to substitute formal <b>wage</b> <b>employees</b> for informal <b>wage</b> <b>employees</b> among men. Formal wages increase, informal wages decline, and self-employed men become wage earners {{to take advantage of the}} increase in the provision of mandated benefits—although the increase in labor supply in the formal sector is not enough to compensate for the increase in demand resulting in an increase in formal wages. Among women, there is a reduction in the demand for both formal and informal <b>wage</b> <b>employees,</b> and a decline in formal and informal wages (although not significant for formal wages). Laid-off women move to informal firms where they obtain a job without mandated benefits. Some self-employed women become informal <b>wage</b> <b>employees,</b> probably attracted by the probability of obtaining better employment conditions in the future. The heterogenous impacts of a higher level of enforcement are explained by labor regulations which vary by gender in some cases, e.g., maternity leave, or have a different impact on firms’ costs due to different men and women characteristics, e.g., contributions to the pension system which are a function of monthly labor earnings. Labor regulations make formal and informal men more substitutable in the production process than formal and informal women.|$|R
30|$|This paper {{examines}} the earnings penalties and premiums associated with {{different types of}} employment in 73 countries.

Fewer than 10 percent are formal employees, and only 2 percent of workers in low income countries are employers or own-account professionals. As per capita gross domestic product increases across countries, there are large net shifts from non-professional own-account work into formal wage employment. Across all regions and income levels, non-professional own-account workers and informal <b>wage</b> <b>employees</b> face an earnings penalty compared with formal <b>wage</b> <b>employees.</b> But in low income countries, this earnings penalty is small, and non-professional own-account workers earn a positive premium relative to all <b>wage</b> <b>employees.</b> Earnings penalties for non-professional own-account workers tend to increase with gross domestic product and are largest for female workers in high income countries. On average, employers and own-account professionals earn a premium compared to employees, although there are important differences across countries and between men and women. In terms of regional differences, earnings premiums for employers and professionals are largest for men in middle income Latin American countries. On the other hand, women employers and professionals do not earn a statistically significant premium compared to employees in any region of the world. These results are consistent with compensating wage differentials and firm quasi-rents playing important roles in explaining cross-country variation in earnings penalties, and raise questions {{about the extent to which}} the unskilled self-employed are rationed out of formal wage work in low income countries.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} sources of rising {{lifetime}} incomes in Ghana using both existing cross-section data and a new panel data set which allows us to measure earnings growth within jobs and to construct lifetime work histories for both <b>wage</b> <b>employees</b> and the selfemployed.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we address a range of {{questions}} as to how the falls in poverty in Ghana and Tanzania in the 1990 s were effected and the effects of economic reforms on different types of household. Did private <b>wage</b> <b>employees</b> suffer from the trade liberalisation policies that characterised both economies in the 1990 s? In Tanzania {{it is clear that the}} answer to this question is no. Households headed by a private <b>wage</b> <b>employee</b> saw rises in excess of 30 per cent in household expenditure per capita and the proportion of households headed by a private <b>wage</b> <b>employee</b> rose. In Ghana the answer is less clear cut. Household expenditure per capita for households headed by a private sector <b>wage</b> <b>employee</b> rose by 15 per cent but the proportion of households headed by such employees fell over the decade. How did the reforms in the public sectors implemented over the period affect households headed by a public sector employee? In both Ghana and Tanzania the proportion of households headed by public sector employees fell- by 6 and 13 percentage points respectively. By this measure policy in Tanzania was much more successful at cutting back the size of the public sector than Ghana. In both countries expenditures per capita rose- by 15 per cent in Ghana and nearly 30 per cent in Tanzania. By this measure public sector headed households fared much better in Tanzania than Ghana.
