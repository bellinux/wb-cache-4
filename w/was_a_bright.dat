5|$|Pale Blue Dot, {{which was}} {{taken with the}} narrow-angle camera, was also {{published}} {{as part of a}} composite picture created from a wide-angle camera photograph showing the Sun and the region of space containing the Earth and Venus. The wide-angle image was inset with two narrow-angle pictures: Pale Blue Dot and a similar photograph of Venus. The wide-angle photograph was taken with the darkest filter (a methane absorption band) and the shortest possible exposure (5 milliseconds), to avoid saturating the camera's vidicon tube with scattered sunlight. Even so, the result <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bright</b> burned-out image with multiple reflections from the optics in the camera and the Sun that appears far larger than the actual dimension of the solar disk. The rays around the Sun are a diffraction pattern of the calibration lamp which is mounted in front of the wide-angle lens.|$|E

25|$|Two other Australian Aboriginal art designs {{have been}} {{displayed}} on Qantas aircraft. Two Boeing 747s (a −400 {{and later a}} −400ER) were adorned in a paint scheme called Wunala Dreaming. Wunala Dreaming was the first Australian Aboriginal art scheme and was unveiled in 1994. The motif was an overall-red design depicting ancestral spirits {{in the form of}} kangaroos travelling in the outback. The second design was called Nalanji Dreaming and was painted on one of the airline's now-retired Boeing 747-300s in 1995. Nalanji Dreaming <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bright</b> blue design inspired by rainforest landscape and tropical seas.|$|E
25|$|Despite St. Louis's diversified economy, it {{suffered}} {{as much or}} more than comparable cities {{in the early years of}} the Great Depression. The manufacturing output of St. Louis fell by 57 percent between 1929 and 1933, slightly more than the national average of 55 percent. By 1939, St. Louis was still at only 70 percent of its 1929 production levels, while national industrial production was up to 84 percent of its 1929 level. The return of the brewing industry after the repeal of Prohibition in 1933 <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bright</b> spot in St. Louis industry, but this still was not enough to offset industrial production losses.|$|E

25|$|Military success brought Bismarck {{tremendous}} {{political support}} in Prussia. In {{the elections of}} 1866 the liberals suffered a major defeat, losing their majority in the House of Deputies. The new, largely conservative House was on much better terms with Bismarck than previous bodies; at the Minister President's request, it retroactively approved the budgets {{of the past four}} years, which had been implemented without parliamentary consent. Bismarck suspected it would split the liberal opposition. While some liberals argued that constitutional government <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bright</b> line that should not be crossed, most of them believed it would be a waste of time to oppose the bill, and supported it in hopes of winning more freedom in the future.|$|E
25|$|Her {{outer garment}} <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bright</b> colored plaid worsted cloak {{reaching}} to within {{about six inches}} of the floor. Its size was most voluminous, but its fashion was extremely simple. It had a wide yoke across the shoulders, into which the broad plain breadths were gathered; and it was fastened at the throat by a huge ornamented brass hook and eye, from which hung a short chain of round twisted links. Her right arm protruded through a vertical slit {{at the side of}} the cloak and she held in her hand a sheet of paper covered with figures. The left arm on which she carried a large basket or bag — I couldn't tell which — was hidden by the ample folds of the garment. Her countenance was keen and nervous, but benignant.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the legend}} {{said that there}} was a man who lived under the reign of King Wu of Zhou; his name was Zhang Fu De.

When he was 7 years old, he already learned old Chinese Classics and empathized the poor. Zhang Fu De became a {{government}} tax officer when he was 36 and he was a wise and good officer and people loved him. He died when he was 102 years old at 1236 BC on the reign of King Cheng of Zhou. But after three days, his deceased body had not rotten and amazed all the people.|$|E

25|$|An Anglican {{priest of}} Irish extraction, {{he was born}} on St Patrick's Day, 17 March 1777. He <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bright</b> young man and after being taught by the Rev. Thomas Tighe, he won a {{scholarship}} to St John's College, Cambridge, where he studied divinity and ancient and modern history. Attending Cambridge may have made him think his name was too Irish, and he changed its spelling to Brontë, perhaps in honour of Horatio Nelson who held the title of Duke of Bronte, whom Patrick admired. However, a more likely reason may have been that his brother, William, was 'on the run' from the British for his involvement with the United Irishmen {{and he wanted to}} distance himself from the name Prunty. Having obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree, he was ordained on 10 August 1806. He is the author of Cottage Poems (1811), The Rural Minstrel (1814), numerous pamphlets and newspaper articles, and various rural poems.|$|E
500|$|Seward {{was born}} in on May 16, 1801, in the small {{community}} of Florida, New York, in Orange County. He was the third son of Samuel Sweezy Seward and his wife Mary (Jennings) Seward. Samuel Seward was a wealthy landowner and slaveholder in New York State; slavery was not fully abolished in the state until 1827. Florida was located some [...] north of New York City, west of the Hudson River, and was a small rural village of perhaps a dozen homes. [...] Young Seward attended school there, {{and also in the}} nearby county seat of Goshen. He <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bright</b> student who enjoyed his studies. In later years, one of the former family slaves would relate that instead of running away from school to go home, Seward would run away from home to go to school.|$|E

500|$|Victoria {{was buried}} in the ducal family {{mausoleum}} at [...] in Coburg, until her remains [...] to the Grand Ducal Mausoleum of the Peter and Paul Fortress in Saint Petersburg on 7 March 1995. Her husband was intensely lonely after her death. The marriage of their daughter, Kira, to Louis Ferdinand, Prince of Prussia, in 1938 <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bright</b> spot for Kirill, who saw it as the joining of two dynasties. However, Kirill died just two years after his wife. Kirill, though he had been unfaithful, still loved and missed the wife he had depended so much upon and passed his remaining years writing memoirs of their life together. [...] "There are few who in one person combine all that is best in soul, mind, and body," [...] he wrote. [...] "She had it all, and more. Few there are who are fortunate in having such a woman as the partner of their lives -- I was one of those privileged." ...|$|E
500|$|Levin <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bright</b> child and, {{encouraged}} by his mother, {{he worked hard}} enough to win a scholarship to the independent school Christ's Hospital in the countryside near Horsham, West Sussex. His housemaster was D. S. ("Boom") Macnutt, the school's head of Classics. Macnutt was a strict, even bullying, teacher, and was feared rather than loved by his pupils, but Levin learned Classics well, and retained a lifelong love of Latin tags and quotations in his writing. He battled on many fronts at Christ's Hospital: he was a Jew at a Church of England establishment; he was from a poor family; he was slight of stature; he was utterly indifferent to sport; he adopted a Marxist stance, hanging the Red Flag from a school window to celebrate the Labour victory in 1945. In the local streets, the school's conspicuous uniform, including a cloak and tight stockings, attracted unwanted attention. Levin's biographer Bel Mooney writes of this period, [...] "Jeers put iron in his soul". Among the consolations of Christ's Hospital was its thriving musical life. At concerts by the school orchestra (whose members included Levin's contemporary, Colin Davis), Levin listened seriously to music for the first time. The food at the school was no such consolation; according to Levin it was so appalling {{that there must be}} something better to be found, and from his late teens he sought out the best restaurants he could afford.|$|E
500|$|Ruiz {{began the}} 2012 season strongly, and {{throughout}} the season <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bright</b> spot on an otherwise disappointing team. Through June 27, he led the Major Leagues with a [...]364 average. This contributed to a stellar {{first half of the}} season earned him his first placement on the National League All-Star team. He was a reserve, though some analysts, including ESPN's John Kruk, felt his numbers warranted a starting nod, which ultimately went to the San Francisco Giants' Buster Posey through the fan voting. Shortly after the announcement that he was an all-star, a piece in The Philadelphia Daily News entitled [...] "The evolution of Carlos Ruiz" [...] summarized his career: [...] "Ruiz, though, was never a major prospect. He was a reserve catcher before he was a starting catcher. He was a bottom-of-the-order hitter before he was a middle-of-the-order hitter. And now, {{for the first time in}} his career, Carlos Ruiz is an All-Star." [...] After the all-star break, he spent over a month on the disabled list with plantar fasciitis, hindering his statistical totals, which at the time of his injury were among the best in the National League. He led all NL catchers in doubles, en route to posting a [...]325 batting average with 16 home runs and 68 RBIs, all of which were career highs. He finished 28th in MVP voting, the third consecutive season he had received votes.|$|E
