5|$|The Independent {{newspaper}} apologised on 21 August 2006, <b>writing</b> <b>that</b> on 14 June 2006, {{the paper}} had wrongly reported Mardas' involvement with Apple Electronics Ltd. They corrected the earlier piece by <b>writing</b> <b>that</b> Mardas {{had not been}} a company employee, but a director and shareholder of Apple Electronics, and was not sacked, but resigned his directorship in May 1971, while still retaining his shareholding, until giving it to Apple Corps some years later. The paper accepted that Mardas “did not claim to have invented electric paint, a flying saucer or a recording studio with a ‘sonic force field’ or cause his employers to waste money on such ideas. We apologise to Mr. Mardas for these errors".|$|E
5|$|Bloom {{says that}} some of the {{characters}} have not stood the test of time, <b>writing</b> <b>that</b> modern readers are uncomfortable with the anti-semitic treatment of Cohn's character and the romanticization of a bullfighter. Moreover, Brett and Mike belong uniquely to the Jazz Age and do not translate to the modern era. Bloom believes the novel is in the canon of American literature for its formal qualities: its prose and style.|$|E

5|$|Chappell had {{a direct}} {{influence}} on Hughes' successor, Allan Border. Early in his captaincy tenure, Border was struggling with the burdens of the position so the ACB appointed Bob Simpson as team coach to assist. This led to animosity between Chappell and Simpson as Chappell derided {{the need for a}} coach. Simpson responded by <b>writing</b> <b>that</b> the peer influence of older players helping younger players fell away during the era when the Chappell brothers led the team, and he was redressing the problem.|$|E

5|$|The {{game was}} the first to be {{released}} under the Octane Games brand. It received average reviews from critics upon release, with IGN's Gord Goble <b>writing</b> <b>that</b> his main issue with the game was that it was very short and lacked any lasting appeal. Shortly after the game's release, an update was made available that added support for dual-monitors, support for editable key configurations, and more destructible objects to the game.|$|E
5|$|Wollstonecraft later repudiated Mary, <b>writing</b> <b>that</b> it was laughable. However, {{scholars}} have argued that, despite its faults, the novel's representation of an energetic, unconventional, opinionated, rational, female genius (the {{first of its}} kind in English literature) within a new kind of romance is an important development {{in the history of the}} novel because it helped shape an emerging feminist discourse.|$|E

5|$|According to the author, {{he began}} {{writing the book}} {{in the same way}} he began most of his books: by {{exploring}} a question that was unresolved for him. In this case, the question became the book's title. In What's So Amazing About Grace?, Yancey answers this question by <b>writing</b> <b>that</b> God gives grace to people unconditionally, without their need to earn it. His book includes Bible stories, anecdotes from Yancey's life and accounts of historical events. Similar to his other works, What's So Amazing About Grace? has a self-deprecating tone. It describes Yancey's upbringing in a judgmental church, a theme Yancey previously explored in The Jesus I Never Knew and later returned to in Reaching for the Invisible God and Soul Survivor.|$|E
5|$|After the election, Roosevelt {{continued}} to promote progressive ideals, a New Nationalism, much to Taft's dismay. Roosevelt attacked his successor's administration, arguing that its guiding principles were {{not that of}} the party of Lincoln, but those of the Gilded Age. The feud continued on and off through 1911, {{a year in which}} there were few elections of significance. Wisconsin Senator La Follette announced a presidential run as a Republican, and was backed by a convention of progressives. Roosevelt began to move into a position for a run in late 1911, <b>writing</b> <b>that</b> the tradition that presidents not run for a third term only applied to consecutive terms.|$|E
5|$|An {{estimated}} 8000 Normans {{and other}} continentals settled in England {{as a result}} of the conquest, although exact figures cannot be established. Some of these new residents intermarried with the native English, but the extent of this practice in the years immediately after Hastings is unclear. Several marriages are attested between Norman men and English women during the years before 1100, but such marriages were uncommon. Most Normans continued to contract marriages with other Normans or other continental families rather than with the English. Within a century of the invasion, intermarriage between the native English and the Norman immigrants had become common. By the early 1160s, Ailred of Rievaulx was <b>writing</b> <b>that</b> intermarriage was common in all levels of society.|$|E
5000|$|PC Gamers Dan Stapleton praised Wheatley as [...] "fantastically voiced" [...] by Merchant and <b>wrote</b> <b>that</b> he was [...] "basically {{playing the}} same mind-bogglingly stupid {{character}} from the Ricky Gervais comedy Extras". PC Gamers Craig Pearson <b>wrote</b> <b>that</b> [...] "his nervous English voice... is another indicator that while Valve might not have known what they had with the original Portal, this time around they’re a lot more confident". Giant Bomb's Ryan Davis <b>wrote</b> <b>that</b> Merchant voiced Wheatley with [...] "terrific nervous energy”. Wireds Chris Kohler <b>wrote</b> <b>that</b> [...] "you’ll {{fall in love with}} Wheatley, a friendly robot with a heart of gold and the charming voice of actor Stephen Merchant". IGN's Charles Onyett <b>wrote</b> <b>that</b> it's [...] "difficult to overstate how Merchant's obvious enthusiasm for the role benefits the game" [...] and that [...] "no word Wheatley speaks is without witty inflection, and the consistently clever writing perfectly complements the onscreen action". He also <b>wrote</b> <b>that</b> Merchant's Wheatley [...] "steals the show" [...] while GLaDOS and Cave Johnson's voice actors Ellen McLain and J.K. Simmons turn in solid performances. PALGN's Adam Ghiggino <b>wrote</b> <b>that</b> Merchant's performance was [...] "brilliant" [...] and that he has [...] "a lot of emotion to his movement". Video Gamer's Jamin Smith <b>wrote</b> <b>that</b> Merchant's voice was familiar and <b>wrote</b> <b>that</b> Wheatley [...] "possesses more personality than the cast of most other games put together" [...] despite [...] "a lack of any distinguishing features at all" [...] in its appearance.|$|R

5|$|Despite {{the mostly}} {{negative}} reception, Game Informer and Dave Halverson of Play Magazine defended the game. Game Informer {{described it as}} ambitious and praised the graphics, story, amount of content, and replay value, though the publication still believed that only fans of the franchise would enjoy the game. Halverson initially gave the Xbox360 version a 9.5/10, praising each character's controls and abilities and calling it the best 3D Sonic game yet. In the following issue, Halverson reassessed it as 8.5/10, <b>writing</b> <b>that</b> {{he had been told}} that the load times and glitches in his review copy would not be in {{the final version of the}} game. In a later review of the PlayStation3 version, Halverson was frustrated that the problems had still not been corrected and that the performance was worse despite the extra development time; Halverson gave the PS3 version a 5.5/10.|$|E
5|$|Following Sean Connery's {{announcement}} {{that he would}} not play James Bond again, Eastwood was offered the role but turned it down because he believed the character should be played by an English actor. He next starred in the loner Western Joe Kidd (1972), based on a character inspired by Reies Lopez Tijerina, who stormed a courthouse in Tierra Amarilla, New Mexico in June 1967. During filming, Eastwood suffered symptoms of a bronchial infection and several panic attacks. Joe Kidd received a mixed reception, with Roger Greenspun of The New York Times <b>writing</b> <b>that</b> it was unremarkable, with foolish symbolism and sloppy editing, although he praised Eastwood's performance.|$|E
5|$|Harrison {{accepted}} his nomination {{in a letter}} dated December 19, 1839. At age 66 then (67 by the election), he was the oldest presidential candidate to that point. He pledged to serve only one term, but was vague about other stances, <b>writing</b> <b>that</b> his public career made stating his positions unnecessary. There was no party platform; most Whigs did not favor binding candidates to a legislative plan. If the Whigs did not leave Harrisburg completely united, they achieved this within weeks of the convention. A testimonial dinner to Senator Clay in Washington on December 11, attended by convention delegates and other politicians, healed many wounds, {{and a series of}} huge public meetings, held to ratify the nominations of Harrison and Tyler, showed the Whigs willing to put the nomination fight behind them.|$|E
