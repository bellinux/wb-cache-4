5|$|The {{foundation}} of the Fourth International was therefore spurred {{in part by a}} desire to form a stronger political current, rather than being seen as the communist opposition to the Comintern and the Soviet Union.

5|$|It {{had been}} well {{understood}} by the Dutch that the forces occupying the Grebbe Line would not be sufficiently strong to repel all attacks by themselves; they were intended to delay an offensive long enough for reserves to reinforce them. Due to the failure the previous day {{to understand that the}} German main assault was imminent, these reserves would not arrive in time to intervene in the fight at the defence zone between the two trench systems. This <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> serious as the Stop Line had no depth and lacked large shelters to accommodate enough troops to stage a strong frontal counterattack. In the late evening it was decided to execute a flank attack from the north the next day.|$|E
5|$|Not all {{elements}} of the battalion suffered similar problems, however; on the same day, 9 January, B Company destroyed eleven German tanks advancing on the village of Rittershoffen, with four more the next day, while another section working with the 813th Tank Destroyer Battalion in Hatten nearby accounted for nine. These units remained with the infantry in the village for several days, unable to withdraw, and acquitted themselves well in close fighting. This <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> of an achievement when it was considered that, leaving disciplinary problems aside, the battalion suffered from major training deficiencies and was entirely combat inexperienced. One member of the battalion was awarded the Silver Star, while the 79th Division recommended a crew which had fought in Hatten to receive Bronze Stars—it is unclear if these were ever awarded.|$|E

40|$|In {{the context}} of a new Keynesian {{macroeconomic}} model, this paper studies the monetary policy that should be conducted by the common central bank of a monetary union. In the event of inflationary supply shocks, the optimal monetary policy should <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> contractionary as <b>the</b> inflation inertia increases, in order to obtain the same average price level. Moreover, the increase in interest rates should <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> accentuated as <b>the</b> shock affects a country which has a higher inflation inertia, and as the heterogeneity in inflation persistence between the countries of the monetary union increases. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
5|$|With {{two games}} remaining, Yorke scored his 29th {{goal of the}} season at Middlesbrough to help his team return {{to the top of}} the table. Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink's late winner against Arsenal two days later all but ended Wenger’s chances of {{retaining}} the league championship. United now needed only four points, one of them gained at Ewood Park, relegating Blackburn Rovers in the process. Manchester United eventually secured the championship on the final day, coming back from a goal down against Tottenham to win 2–1. The achievement <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> special for Ferguson, who lifted his fifth domestic championship in seven seasons.|$|E
5|$|In January 1532, Cranmer was {{appointed}} the resident ambassador {{at the court}} of the Holy Roman Emperor, Charles V. As the emperor travelled throughout his realm, Cranmer had to follow him to his residence in Ratisbon (Regensburg). He passed through the Lutheran city of Nuremberg and saw {{for the first time}} the effects of the Reformation. When the Imperial Diet was moved to Nuremberg in the summer, he met the leading architect of the Nuremberg reforms, Andreas Osiander. They became good friends, and during that July Cranmer took the surprising action of marrying Margarete, the niece of Osiander's wife. This <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> remarkable given that the marriage required him to set aside his priestly vow of celibacy. He did not take her as his mistress, as was the prevailing custom with priests for whom celibacy was too rigorous. Scholars note that Cranmer had moved, however moderately at this stage, into identifying with certain Lutheran principles. This progress in his personal life was not matched in his political life as he was unable to persuade Charles, Catherine's nephew, to support the annulment of his aunt's marriage.|$|E
5|$|Ironically, manager John Sillett {{spent much}} of the money from Coventry's FA Cup run (£750,000) on Chelsea striker David Speedie, who would replace Houchen in front of goal. Sillett's one {{consolation}} to Houchen was that he would play him in the 1987 FA Charity Shield, which ended in a 1–0 defeat to Everton. The 1987–88 season was poor for both club and player, as illness, injury and competition from Speedie, Gary Bannister and Cyrille Regis restricted Houchen to just three goals and 24 appearances. On 14 August 1988, he was selected by Graham Taylor to represent the Football League in a game against Scunthorpe United to celebrate the opening of Glanford Park; Houchen scored once in a 6–1 victory. He scored just twice in sixteen appearances in 1988–89, though one of these goals was the winner against Midlands rivals Aston Villa in a 2–1 Boxing Day victory at Highfield Road. He also featured as a substitute in the infamous 2–1 defeat to Conference club Sutton United at Gander Green Lane. The result <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> remarkable considering that Coventry went on to finish seventh in the league and that Houchen was one of ten Coventry players that day who had won the FA Cup less than two years previously.|$|E

5|$|On 28 June 2006, Fuller {{signed for}} Conference side Stevenage Borough. He made his debut for the Boro in a 2–1 defeat by York City on 15 August 2006. The defender scored his only {{goal for the}} club in a 2–0 win over Grays Athletic on 17 February 2007. He was ever-present {{throughout}} the 2006–07 season, making thirty-seven league appearances in all. He was also indispensable to the club's FA Trophy success, featuring in both semi-final legs which saw Stevenage Borough beat Grays Athletic 3–1 on aggregate. He {{was part of the}} squad that played in the 2007 FA Trophy Final against Kidderminster Harriers on 12 May 2007 in front of a record FA Trophy crowd of 53,262. Stevenage came back from 2–0 down to ultimately triumph 3–2 following an 88th-minute goal by Steve Morison; the victory <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> significant for Fuller as he {{became a member of the}} first team to win a competitive final at the new Wembley Stadium. He would go on to make 24 league appearances for the Boro during the 2007–08 season before subsequently leaving the club to sign a two-year deal with League One side Gillingham on 28 January 2008 along with team-mate Stuart Lewis; reuniting him with the manager who had previously recruited him at Stevenage Borough, Mark Stimson.|$|E

25|$|A flood-hit season inflicted serious {{financial}} damage, and on-field {{results in}} the Championship gave little cheer as Worcestershire were relegated. However, in the Pro40 First Division things were very different, and victory over Gloucestershire in mid-September brought the title to New Road, the county's first trophy since 1994. The feat <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> remarkable {{for the fact that}} every one of Worcestershire's games was played away from their New Road home, due to the floods, with 'home' games played at Edgbaston, Taunton and Kidderminster.|$|E
25|$|At {{the turn}} of the 18th century, Amsterdam was the fourth largest city in Europe, behind Constantinople (about 700,000), London (550,000) and Paris (530,000). This <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> {{remarkable}} as Amsterdam was neither the capital city nor the seat of government of the Dutch Republic, which itself was a much smaller state than England, France or the Ottoman Empire. In contrast to those other metropolises, Amsterdam was also surrounded by large towns such as Leiden (about 67,000), Rotterdam (45,000), Haarlem (38,000), and Utrecht (30,000).|$|E
25|$|Clarke {{initially}} {{played a}} Second XI Championship fixture for Sussex in 1981 against the Second XI of Hampshire, but made no further appearances for the Sussex Second XI for some while following that fixture.

The trial {{turned out to be}} a success for Clarke, with Sussex signing following which he took a sabbatical from his job. His late start in county cricket, at the age of 26, <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> remarkable considering that his bowling style was virtually considered an extinct form in England.|$|E

25|$|He {{ended the}} season as the club's top scorer, netting 30 times in just 49 {{appearances}} in all competitions, a ratio of 1 goal every 1.6 games. 17 of these goals came in the League as he helped the Reds reclaim the League championship from holders Aston Villa. The title triumph <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> impressive {{by the fact that}} Liverpool had entered 1982 in 10th place, with the likes of Manchester United and minnows Swansea City leading the pack then, before a turnaround in Liverpool's fortunes saw the league championship trophy return to Anfield after two years away. He also scored a goal to help Liverpool win the 1982 Football League Cup Final against Tottenham Hotspur.|$|E
25|$|Much of the {{professional}} cycle racing was stopped after 1915 because of the First World War {{and it was not}} until 1918 that Girardengo took another win, taking the first of his six victories in Milan–San Remo, a record which Eddy Merckx eventually eclipsed over 50 years later. He also finished in the first three of the same race every year from 1917 to 1926 and was first over the Turchino Pass on five occasions. His post 1918 form <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> remarkable as during the First World War Girardengo had contracted Spanish flu and nearly died, his manager believing a survivor of that disease could not race properly refused at one point to renew his licence.|$|E
25|$|In 1997, Ó Sé's Kerry {{announced}} their arrival when they captured the National League title {{at the start}} of the year. A second Munster title soon followed after a demolition of Clare in the provincial decider. Kerry subsequently qualified for the All-Ireland final, with Mayo providing the opposition. The game saw both sides share periods of dominance. Kerry's Maurice Fitzgerald scored nine of his team's points while Mayo scored 1-2 in a two-minute spell. The Connacht champions failed to score in the last twenty minutes as Kerry held on to win by 0-13 to 1-7. The win <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> significant for Ó Sé as he became one of the few people who captained and managed his county to an All-Ireland title.|$|E

25|$|Nonetheless, Jackson {{averaged}} under twenty runs a wicket {{in every}} season from 1951 to 1962, and took 100 {{or more in}} every season except 1951, 1955 and 1961 when he was severely handicapped by injuries. In the 1958 season, he took 143 wickets {{at an average of}} 10.99 runs per wicket, an average not equalled by any regular first-class bowler since and not previously seen since the days of Tom Richardson. This feat <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> extraordinary because owing to a serious groin strain Jackson bowled at only medium pace for most of the season. Jackson was one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1959, then took a further 140 wickets in 1959 (being the first to reach 100), and then 160 at 13.61 in 1960. In all, he passed 100 wickets in ten domestic seasons. Fred Trueman described Jackson as “The best six-days-a-week bowler in county cricket”.|$|E
25|$|This <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> galling given that, {{under the}} Spaniards and Austrians, the city's {{inhabitants}} received no compensation for all this: {{they were to}} provide housing to the soldiers free of charge. The government claimed that since the garrison's presence brought trade and business which benefited the city's merchants and artisans, it was only fair for citizens to contribute by lodging the troops. Nor was the burden of quartering troops shared equally, by any means: there were many exemptions, reflecting the social inequality of the Ancien Régime society. The justiciar, the aldermen, lawyers, members of the provincial council, and the nobility were exempt. The magistrates assigned soldiers to houses, and to this effect made lists with very detailed descriptions of houses' interiors. Abuses of power could not be prevented: the authorities were known to assign an excessive number of soldiers to the houses of residents who {{had been involved in}} disputes with the city. Citizens tried to wriggle out of these obligations by deliberately not keeping all rooms in their house fit for habitation; the wealthier inhabitants were able to avoid taking in soldiers by paying their way out.|$|E
