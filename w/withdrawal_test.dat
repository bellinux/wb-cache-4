40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} was (1) to {{evaluate}} the effects of long-term oxygen treatment (LTOT) in elderly patients with severe exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and hypoxaemia, (2) to study the health-related quality of life (QOL) during hospital stay and at follow-up, (3) to study the safety of an oxygen <b>withdrawal</b> <b>test</b> performed a few days after admission to hospital and the possibility to predict the future need for LTOT from that test. Patients > 70 years with COPD-exacerbations with hypoxaemia were included after 5 – 7 days treatment in hospital. Inclusion was based on results of a standardised oxygen <b>withdrawal</b> <b>test.</b> After 1, 3, 6 and 12 months a new oxygen <b>withdrawal</b> <b>test</b> was performed. Health-related QOL was evaluated with SF- 36 and the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire at inclusion and after 3, 6 and 12 months. Forty-seven patients were screened for participation and 29 patients, mean age 79 years, participated in the study. Only one patient could not tolerate the oxygen <b>withdrawal</b> <b>test.</b> Eighteen patients survived to the follow-up after 12 months, 8 / 19 women and 2 / 10 men died. After 1 month LTOT was needed (P aO 2 without oxygen was ≤ 7. 5 kPa) in only 6 / 20 patients. The effect of LTOT could therefore not be studied. Most components of SF- 36 were very low at inclusion, but tended to increase after 3 months and were among the surviving patients after 12 months similar to that of healthy people of the same age for psychic well being and functioning. Especially, the symptom score of the SGRQ improved after 3 months. In conclusion, the future need for LTOT cannot be judged after a few days treatment in hospital due to exacerbations with hypoxaemia in elderly patients with COPD. A standardised oxygen <b>withdrawal</b> <b>test</b> can be safely done. Health-related QOL is low in patients during the stay in hospital, but improves after returning home...|$|E

In the present study, we evaluated the effects of NPS in pain modulation at the supraspinal level for the first time, using the tail <b>withdrawal</b> <b>test</b> and hot-plate test in mice. NPS (mouse, 0. 01 - 1  nmol) injected intracerebroventricularly (i. c. v.) caused a significant increase of tail withdrawal latency and paw-licking/jumping latency in the tail <b>withdrawal</b> <b>test</b> and the hot-plate test, respectively. Antinociceptive effect elicited by NPS (0. 1  nmol, i. c. v.) was not affected by naloxone (i. c. v., 10  nmol co-injection or i. p., 10  mg/kg, 10  min prior to NPS) in both tail <b>withdrawal</b> <b>test</b> and hot-plate test.

40|$|Abstract Background We have {{proposed}} that nerve injury-specific loss of spinal tonic cholinergic inhibition {{may play a role}} in the analgesic effects of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) agonists on neuropathic pain. However, the tonic cholinergic inhibition of pain remains to be well characterized. Results Here, we show that choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) signals were localized not only in outer dorsal horn fibers (lamina I–III) and motor neurons in the spinal cord, but also in the vast majority of neurons in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG). When mice were treated with an antisense oligodeoxynucleotide (AS-ODN) against ChAT, which decreased ChAT signals in the dorsal horn and DRG, but not in motor neurons, they showed a significant decrease in nociceptive thresholds in paw pressure and thermal paw <b>withdrawal</b> <b>tests.</b> Furthermore, in a novel electrical stimulation-induced paw <b>withdrawal</b> (EPW) <b>test,</b> the thresholds for stimulation through C-, Aδ- and Aβ-fibers were all decreased by AS-ODN-pretreatments. The administration of nicotine (10 nmol i. t.) induced a recovery of the nociceptive thresholds, decreased by the AS-ODN, in the mechanical, thermal and EPW tests. However, nicotine had no effects in control mice or treated with a mismatch scramble (MS) -ODN in all of these nociception tests. Conclusion These findings suggest that primary afferent cholinergic neurons produce tonic inhibition of spinal pain through nAChR activation, and that intrathecal administration of nicotine rescues the loss of tonic cholinergic inhibition. </p...|$|R

40|$|Noise is a psychological, {{environmental}} stressor that activates limbic {{sites in the}} brain. Limbic sites such as the amygdala and the amygdaloid corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) system {{play an important role}} in integrating stress response. We investigated the association between noise exposures, CRH-related molecules in the amygdala, and behavioral alterations. In total 54 Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into the following three groups: Control (CON), acute noise exposure (ANE), and chronic noise exposure (CNE). The ANE group was exposed to 100 dB white noise only once in 4 h and the CNE group was exposed to the same for 4 h per day for 30 days. Expression profiles of CRH and its receptors CRH-R 1 and CRH-R 2 were analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). The same stress procedure was applied to the ANE and CNE groups for behavior testing. The anxiety responses of the animals after acute and chronic stress exposure were measured in the defensive <b>withdrawal</b> <b>test.</b> CNE upregulated CRH and CRH-R 1 mRNA levels but downregulated CRH-R 2 mRNA levels. ANE led to a decrease in both CRH-R 1 and CRH-R 2 expression. In the defensive <b>withdrawal</b> <b>test,</b> while the ANE increased, CNE reduced anxiety-like behaviors.

We report that exposure of rats to acute footshock produced long-lasting (> 4 weeks) fear (freezing) and anxiety (avoidance of an open area in the defensive <b>withdrawal</b> <b>test).</b> The 30 mg dose of norBNI attenuated the fear expressed when shock rats were placed in the shock context at Day 9 but not Day 27 post-shock. The same dose of norBNI had no effect on the expression of generalized fear produced when shock rats were placed in a novel chamber at Days 8 and 24.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Pyridoxine-dependent {{seizures}} (PDS) is a rare, autosomal recessively inherited disorder. Recently alpha-aminoadipic semialdehyde (alpha-AASA) dehydrogenase deficiency {{was identified}} as a major cause of PDS, which causes accumulation of both alpha-AASA and pipecolic acid (PA) in body fluids. METHODS: We studied urinary and plasma alpha-AASA and PA levels in 12 Dutch clinically diagnosed patients with PDS. RESULTS: Alpha-AASA was elevated in both urine and plasma in 10 patients. In these patients plasma PA levels were also elevated but urinary PA levels were normal. DISCUSSION: In all patients with clinically definite PDS, and in most patients with probable or possible PDS, the clinical diagnosis of PDS could be confirmed at the metabolite level. Non-invasive urinary screening for alpha-AASA accumulation provides a reliable tool to diagnose PDS and can save these patients from the classical and potentially dangerous pyridoxine <b>withdrawal</b> <b>test</b> to prove PDS...|$|E

40|$|Opiates {{have been}} used {{historically}} {{for the treatment of}} depression. Renewed interest in the use of opiates as antidepressants has focused on the development of kappa opioid receptor (κ-receptor) antagonists. In this thesis I have tested the hypothesis that buprenorphine/naltrexone combination has antidepressant efficacy. Buprenorphine acts as a partial mu opioid receptor (μ-receptor) agonist and a κ-receptor antagonist. By combining buprenorphine with the non-selective opioid receptor antagonist naltrexone, the idea was that the activation of μ-receptors would be reduced and the κ-antagonist properties enhanced. First, the appropriate dose of the combination that would act as a short acting κ-receptor antagonist was investigated in the mouse-tail <b>withdrawal</b> <b>test.</b> A dose of BU 10119, a novel compound derived from buprenorphine, with pharmacology resembling buprenorphine/naltrexone combination was also investigated. It was established that a combination dose of buprenorphine (1 mg/kg, i. p.) with naltrexone (1 mg/kg, i. p.) functioned as a short acting κ-antagonist in the mouse-tail <b>withdrawal</b> <b>test</b> and BU 10119 (1 mg/kg, i. p.) is a к-antagonist with a rapid onset and a duration of action not more than 24 hours. Furthermore, these doses of the buprenorphine/naltrexone and BU 10119 were neither rewarding nor aversive in the conditioned place preference paradigm, and were without significant locomotor effects. Systemic co-administration of buprenorphine/ naltrexone (1 mg/kg, i. p.) and BU 10119 in adult CD- 1 male mice produced an antidepressant-like response in both the forced swim test and novelty induced hypophagia task. Behaviours in the elevated plus maze and light dark box were not significantly altered by either treatment. Moreover, pretreatment with buprenorphine/naltrexone and BU 10119 blocked stress- induced analgesia in adult male CD 1 mice. However, they were not capable of blocking restraint stress-induced elevation of corticosterone levels. Gene expression of k-receptor, prodynorphin and Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone Receptor 1 were not significantly altered by restraint stress or к-receptor antagonist treatment in prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, hippocampus and amygdala. I propose that the combination of buprenorphine with naltrexone and BU 10119, both represent a novel approaches to the treatment of depression...|$|E

40|$|Despite {{their common}} global occurrence, little {{work has been}} done on characterising the {{hydraulic}} properties of root mats, particularly their hydraulic conductivity (K). A common method for estimating K in the field is the piezometer slug test. In some root mat systems, the piezometer slug test may be the only technique, field or laboratory, which is able to provide reliable estimates of K. We installed 17 piezometers in a Cladium mariscus L. (Pohl) and Phragmites australis Cav. (Streud.) root mat in a UK fen. Tests were initiated by both slug insertion and slug <b>withdrawal.</b> Repeat <b>tests</b> were conducted on some piezometers to check for test consistency. Rapid recoveries after both slug insertion and withdrawal were found, with 90 % recovery reached for all tests within 1500 s and for many within 300 s. We found significant and highly reproducible differences between recovery after insertion and recovery after withdrawal, with the latter being more rapid than the former. We invoke a reversible pore blocking mechanism to explain this behaviour. Many of the piezometers showed recoveries after withdrawal broadly consistent with the assumption of a rigid porous medium in which Darcy’s law holds. Tests on four further piezometers were used to examine the impact of piezometer ‘development’, different slug sizes and the use of ‘clean’ water on test behaviour. The results from these test piezometers were difficult to interpret. Nevertheless, it appears that replacing ‘dirty’ water in the piezometer standpipe with clean water leads to more rapid recoveries and reduces the difference between recovery after insertion and recovery after withdrawal. The K of the root mat, as estimated from <b>withdrawal</b> <b>tests</b> on 14 piezometers and standardised to 20 C, ranged between 0. 00144 and 0. 03022 cm s- 1. This appears to be at the very top end of K values reported for fen peats and suggests that water can flow readily through this medium given sufficiently large hydraulic gradients...|$|R

Acute ethanol {{administration}} produces anxiolytic-like effects in rodents while alcohol withdrawal induces anxiogenic-like effects. Mice lacking the mu-opioid receptor (MOR) do not self-administer ethanol and display decreased anxiety-like behavior. We hypothesized that MOR might {{be involved in the}} development and expression of alcoholism, particularly in relation to anxiety states. In mice lacking MOR (MOR-/- mice), we examined the acute anxiolytic-like and locomotor stimulant effects of ethanol (0, 0. 75, 1. 25, 1. 75 g/kg, i. p.). In a separate experiment, mice were submitted to chronic ethanol-containing liquid diet and we assessed somatic and affective ethanol withdrawal on three consecutive withdrawal episodes by scoring handling-induced convulsions and anxiety-like behavior. Deletion of MOR blocked the acute anxiolytic-like and stimulant effects of ethanol. Furthermore, MOR-/- mice displayed affective and physical signs of ethanol withdrawal in earlier <b>withdrawal</b> <b>tests</b> than wild-type mice. The present results implicate MOR in affective and somatic aspects of ethanol exposure and withdrawal. In addition, our findings support the hypothesis that the clinical efficacy of the opioid receptor antagonist naltrexone against relapse to alcoholism might be related to an action on the acute positive effects of alcohol rather than the negative affect of abstinence...|$|R
40|$|Malaria is an {{endemic disease}} {{globally}} and the conundrum of drug resistance {{has led to}} the search for newer antimalarial agents. The root extract of H. barteri was evaluated for antimalarial, analgesic, and anti-inflammatory properties. The prophylactic effect of H. barteri on P. berghei was determined by pretreating mice with aqueous root extract of H. barteri (30 – 300 [*]mg/kg), saline, and 1. 2 [*]mg/kg sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine for three days followed by 1 × 106 P. berghei inoculation. Parasite density was measured after 72 [*]h. The curative antimalarial property of the extract was assessed by treating mice with extract, saline, and 1. 14 [*]:[*] 6. 9 [*]mg/kg Artemether[*]:[*]Lumefantrine four days after 1 × 106 P. berghei inoculation. Selected organs were harvested for toxicity assessment. The anti-inflammatory and analgesic effect of the extract was determined in the carrageenan and thermal tail <b>withdrawal</b> <b>tests,</b> respectively. The extract significantly reduced the parasite density in the prophylactic but not the curative study. The anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities of the extract were significant (P< 0. 05) only at the highest doses employed. Regeneration of hepatocytes was also evident in the extract treated groups. The extract has prophylactic but not curative activity on P. berghei-induced malaria. The anti-inflammatory and analgesic property of the extract occurred at the highest doses used...|$|R
