500|$|In the United States, [...] "Crazy for You" [...] became Madonna's second number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100. The song debuted on {{the chart}} at number 55 on the issue dated March 2, 1985. After six weeks, the song {{reached the top of}} the chart, {{replacing}} [...] "We Are the World" [...] by USA for Africa. [...] "Crazy for You" [...] was the second number-one song for Bettis as a songwriter, after [...] "Top of the World" [...] by The Carpenters (1973). With [...] "Crazy for You", Bettis was in doubt whether the song would reach the top, after it was stuck at number two for three weeks, behind [...] "We Are the World". Both he and Lind commented, [...] "If you gotta lose to something, it might as well be 'We Are the World'. Luckily enough, the final week of the upsurge of the record, we topped 'We Are the World', <b>which</b> <b>lets</b> <b>you</b> know how hot the song and how hot the artist [...] was." [...] "Crazy for You" [...] was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on July 16, 1985, for shipment of one million copies of the single across United States—the requirement for a gold single prior to 1989. The song reached number two on the Adult Contemporary Singles (behind [...] "Rhythm of the Night" [...] by DeBarge), and 80 on the Hot R/Hip-Hop Songs chart. It placed at nine on the year-end chart for 1985, with Madonna becoming the top pop artist for the year. In Canada, the song debuted at number 70 on the RPM issue dated March 16, 1985. On its eleventh week {{on the chart}}, the song reached the top position. It was present on the chart for a total of 25 weeks and was ranked seventh on the RPM Year-end chart for 1985. A music video was released, featuring Madonna singing the song in a night-club. The video was included in , released in 2009.|$|E

50|$|From the beginning, Hordes was {{designed}} to be played against Warmachine. Playing a Warmachine army against a Hordes army is little different from playing two Hordes armies or two Warmachine armies against each other, and many of the special rules are written so that they affect models from both games in similar ways. As an example, damage is recorded differently for warbeasts (in branches) and warjacks (in columns), but most effects <b>which</b> <b>let</b> <b>you</b> choose a column to record damage against a warjack also <b>let</b> <b>you</b> choose a branch, and vice versa. However, each game does have models which possess special rules which are not effective against models from the other game.|$|R

40|$|The {{goal of the}} {{research}} is to construct practicable numerical algorithms for stiff systems of ordinary differential equations <b>which</b> <b>let</b> <b>you</b> increase {{the accuracy of the}} approximate solution without decreasing the length of the time interval. To achieve this goal, we have constructed a family of new iterative analytic processes generalising the Picard process. For a basic representative of this family, we demonstrate its better convergence properties on a scalar linear problem in comparison with the classical Picard process. For the general form of such iterative processes, we discuss their connection with existing methods for operator equations and propose a method for choosing their parameters. The efficiency of this parameter determination method is justified with a numerical experiment. In conclusion we propose a general approach to the construction of numerical algorithms which is based on the discretisation of the constructed iterative analytic processes...|$|R
