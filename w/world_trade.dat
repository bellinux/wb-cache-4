5|$|Along {{with the}} 110-floor Twin Towers, {{numerous}} other buildings at the <b>World</b> <b>Trade</b> Center site were destroyed or badly damaged, including WTC buildings 3 through 7 and St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church. The North Tower, South Tower, the Marriott Hotel (3WTC), and 7WTC were completely destroyed. The U.S. Customs House (6 <b>World</b> <b>Trade</b> Center), 4 <b>World</b> <b>Trade</b> Center, 5 <b>World</b> <b>Trade</b> Center, and both pedestrian bridges connecting buildings were severely damaged. The Deutsche Bank Building on 130 Liberty Street was partially damaged and demolished some years later, starting in 2007. The two {{buildings of the}} World Financial Center also suffered damage.|$|E

5|$|The former Twin Towers of the <b>World</b> <b>Trade</b> Center {{were located}} in Lower Manhattan. At , the 110-story {{buildings}} were the world's tallest from 1972 until they were surpassed by {{the construction of the}} Willis Tower in 1974 (formerly known as the Sears Tower, located in Chicago). One <b>World</b> <b>Trade</b> Center, a replacement for the Twin Towers of the <b>World</b> <b>Trade</b> Center, is currently the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere.|$|E
5|$|The new <b>World</b> <b>Trade</b> Center complex will {{eventually}} include five high-rise office buildings built along Greenwich Street, {{as well as}} the National September 11 Memorial & Museum, located just south of One <b>World</b> <b>Trade</b> Center where the original Twin Towers stood. The construction of the new building is {{part of an effort to}} memorialize and rebuild following the destruction of the original <b>World</b> <b>Trade</b> Center complex.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{destruction}} of the original <b>World</b> <b>Trade</b> Center, there was debate regarding the future of the <b>World</b> <b>Trade</b> Center site. There were proposals for its reconstruction almost immediately, and by 2002, the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation had organized a competition to determine how to use the site. The proposals were part of a larger plan to memorialize the September 11 attacks and rebuild the complex. When the public rejected the first round of designs, a second, more open competition took place in December 2002, in which a design by Daniel Libeskind was selected as the winner. This design underwent many revisions, mainly because of disagreements with developer Larry Silverstein, who held the lease to the <b>World</b> <b>Trade</b> Center site at that time.|$|E

40|$|AbstractNew {{developments}} and significant changes {{are under way}} in the <b>world</b> <b>trading</b> system. We are witnessing a revival of trading nations’ interest in international trade agenda and trade talks, which have taken a backseat since the economic downturn following the global crisis. The improved outlook for global trade growth, but also the acute need for adjusting the <b>world</b> <b>trading</b> system to the ongoing structural changes in the spheres of international trade and industrial organization are, essentially, behind this policy shift. This paper takes stock of recent developments in the <b>world</b> <b>trading</b> system and highlights the prospects for global trade governance. It focuses on three issues: (1) the significance of the Ninth WTO Ministerial Conference in December 2013 for resuming global trade cooperation; (2) the recent drive towards plurilateral sector-specific trade deals; and (3) the outstanding pace and scale of negotiations on new preferential trade agreements (PTAs). The paper concludes with a discussion of the future direction of the <b>world</b> <b>trading</b> system. It argues that despite improved prospects for multilateral <b>trade</b> liberalization, the <b>world</b> <b>trading</b> system is becoming more fragmented and less coherent, and also more uncertain, being increasingly driven by PTAs and a variable geometry approach to WTO trade agreements...|$|R

5|$|Like other {{buildings}} in the new <b>World</b> <b>Trade</b> Center complex, One <b>World</b> <b>Trade</b> Center includes sustainable architecture features. Much of the building's structure and interior is built from recycled materials, including gypsum boards and ceiling tiles; around 80percent of the tower's waste products are recycled. Although the roof area of any tower is limited, the building implements a rainwater collection and recycling scheme for its cooling systems. The building's PureCell phosphoric acid fuel cells generate 4.8megawatts (MW) of power, and its waste steam generates electricity. The New York Power Authority selected UTC Power to provide the tower's fuel cell system, {{which was one of}} the largest fuel cell installations in the world once completed. The tower also makes use of off-site hydroelectric and wind power. The windows are made of an ultra-clear glass, which allows maximum sunlight to pass through; the interior lighting is equipped with dimmers that automatically dim the lights on sunny days, reducing energy costs. Like all of the new facilities at the <b>World</b> <b>Trade</b> Center site, One <b>World</b> <b>Trade</b> Center is heated by steam, with limited oil or natural gas utilities on-site. One <b>World</b> <b>Trade</b> Center is expected to receive a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Gold Certification, making it one of the most environmentally sustainable skyscrapers in the world.|$|E

5|$|The complex {{initially}} {{failed to}} attract the expected clientele. During the early years, various governmental organizations became key tenants of the <b>World</b> <b>Trade</b> Center, such as the State of New York. In the 1980s, the city's perilous financial condition eased, after which {{an increasing number of}} private companies—mostly financial firms related to Wall Street—became tenants. During the 1990s, approximately 500 companies had offices in the complex, including financial companies such as Morgan Stanley, Aon Corporation, and Salomon Brothers. The basement concourse of the <b>World</b> <b>Trade</b> Center included The Mall at the <b>World</b> <b>Trade</b> Center, and a PATH station. The North Tower became the main corporate headquarters of Cantor Fitzgerald, and it also became the headquarters of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.|$|E
5|$|The {{destruction}} of the <b>World</b> <b>Trade</b> Center and nearby infrastructure caused serious damage to the economy of Lower Manhattan and {{had a significant effect}} on global markets, resulting in the closing of Wall Street until September 17 and the civilian airspace in the U.S. and Canada until September 13. Many closings, evacuations, and cancellations followed, out of respect or fear of further attacks. Cleanup of the <b>World</b> <b>Trade</b> Center site was completed in May 2002, and the Pentagon was repaired within a year. On November 18, 2006, construction of One <b>World</b> <b>Trade</b> Center began at the <b>World</b> <b>Trade</b> Center site. The building was officially opened on November 3, 2014. Numerous memorials have been constructed, including the National September 11 Memorial & Museum in New York City, the Pentagon Memorial in Arlington County, Virginia, and the Flight 93 National Memorial in a field in Stonycreek Township near Shanksville, Pennsylvania.|$|E
