Asked if her pregnancy affected her role, Berry replied, [...] "I wasn't in as much as I was meant to be. My ever-growing belly was posing a constant challenge! <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> was getting more limited so the role that I play is so different from what it could have been, due to my surprise pregnancy". According to Kinberg, Berry had another scene in the film that was cut because of Berry's limited schedule.|$|E
500|$|By 1998, Rollins {{felt that}} the {{relationship}} with his backing band had run its course, and the line-up disbanded. He had produced a Los Angeles hard rock band called Mother Superior, and invited them {{to form a new}} incarnation of the Rollins Band. Their first album, Get Some Go Again, was released two years later. The Rollins Band released several more albums, including 2001's Nice and 2003's [...] After 2003, the band became inactive as Rollins focused on radio and television work. During a 2006 appearance on Tom Green Live!, Rollins stated that he [...] "may never do music again", a feeling which he reiterated in 2011 when talking to Trebuchet magazine. In an interview with Culture Brats, Henry admitted he had sworn off music for good – [...] "... and I must say that I miss it every day. I just don't know honestly <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> with it that's different." ...|$|E

Clarke tried to write for three hours each day, {{beginning}} at 5:30am, but struggled to keep this schedule. Rather than writing the novel from beginning to end, she wrote in fragments and attempted to stitch them together. Clarke, admitting that the project was for herself and not for the reader, [...] "clung to this method" [...] "because I felt that if I went back and started at the beginning, [...] would lack depth, and I would just be skimming the surface of <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do.</b> But if I had known {{it was going to take}} me ten years, I would never have begun. I was buoyed up by thinking that I would finish it next year, or the year after next." [...] Clarke and Greenland fell in love while she was writing the novel and moved in together.|$|E

500|$|In late 2000, Aguilera {{started to}} record her then-upcoming material. The {{recording}} sessions {{took place in}} studios around California and New York City, including Electric Lady Studios in New York, The Enterprise Studios in Burbank, California, Conway Recording Studios, The Record Plant and NRG Recording Studios in Hollywood. According to Aguilera, the recording sessions were much longer than she thought. She further explained that lots of things came up during that time, including her first break-up with her first boyfriend Jorge Santos. Aguilera also believed that the lyrics of Stripped were so personal, and her vocals [...] "represent a rawer, more bare-bones approach as well, with less of the ostentatious riffing that has miffed critics in the past". She stated, [...] "I did the vocal gymnastics thing because it was fun. That's why I like blues, too, because you can experiment more with that side of your voice. But I thought the lyrics on this record are so personal, deep and good that I wanted to make them stand out more than <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> with my voice technically".|$|E
500|$|Clarke {{spent the}} next ten years working on the novel in her spare time, while editing cookbooks {{full-time}} for Simon & Schuster in Cambridge. She also published stories in Starlight 2 and Starlight 3; according to the New York Times Magazine, her work was known and appreciated by a small group of fantasy fans and critics on the internet. She was never sure, however, if she would finish her novel or if it would be published. Clarke tried to write for three hours each day, beginning at 5:30am, but struggled to keep this schedule.

It was very organic and {{spontaneous}} — just one of those wonderful things that happens. But there was never a mention of a second record from either of us, and not uncomfortably. We're just both kind of free spirits. I love to work with a lot of different people, but I was also just gagging to see <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> on my own.

2500|$|Two plays later, the Steelers faced 3rd {{down and}} 4 from the Dallas 17. Henderson sacked Bradshaw for a 12-yard loss, but {{the play was}} nullified by a delay of game penalty on Pittsburgh, {{bringing}} up 3rd down and 9 instead of a fourth down. Replays clearly showed the whistle blew before the play's onset, plus {{most of the players}} pulled up and stopped playing after a whistle sounded, but Henderson claimed, [...] "I didn't hear a whistle until after I had knocked Bradshaw down. [...] The same guy (Swearingen) made that call too. Who is that guy?" [...] " [...] Franco Harris confronted Henderson for taunting Bradshaw after the whistle, and on the next play, Bradshaw handed the ball off to Harris, who raced untouched, with help from the Umpire Art Demmas impeding Cowboys safety Charlie Waters' attempt to tackle him, up the middle for a 22-yard touchdown run. [...] The next day Waters was quoted as saying, [...] "I don't know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> – maybe knock him [...] flat and maybe he'd knock Franco flat? [...] Our safeties {{play a vital role in}} the run. [...] That official gets in the way a lot. [...] He screened me off." [...] This score increased Pittsburgh's lead to 28–17. [...] The run would be the Steelers' longest touchdown run in Super Bowl competition until Willie Parker scampered 75 yards for a score against the Seattle Seahawks in Super Bowl XL.|$|E
2500|$|With Chappell again available, Hughes {{returned}} to the vice-captaincy for the 1981–82 Tests. Australia played Pakistan first in an ill-tempered three Test series; won by the Australians two Tests to one. Hughes started the series with a century (106) in the first Test in Perth and finished the series having scored 193 runs overall. The other touring side that summer were the West Indies, widely considered {{the best team in}} the world at that time and supported by a potent fast bowling attack. The first Test in the series was played at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Both teams were critical of the pitch prepared at the MCG for the Test. [...] Australia were quickly reduced to 26/4 before Hughes started his effort to recover the Australian innings. Hughes decided to attack the West Indian bowling. In an interview later he said [...] "that to hang around and defend was going to be a waste of time...So I thought <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> was try to play as many shots as possible." [...] When the ninth wicket fell, Hughes had made 71 and it appeared a century was out of reach. Hughes' remaining batting partner, Alderman, was a poor batsman; it had taken him nine matches to make his first first-class run. Alderman, despite telling Hughes that he didn't give himself much chance, managed to stay with Hughes long enough for Hughes to reach 100 runs. Hughes' innings was widely praised. West Indian Andy Roberts said [...] "He took up the challenge and it paid off for him. It was a great innings. You don't find one batsman playing that sort of innings on more than one occasion. That was just his day." [...] The Wisden 100, a ranking of the Top 100 Test Innings of all time, ranked that innings as number nine.|$|E
