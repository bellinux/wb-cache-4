25|$|Rorke, who is {{six feet}} four inches, {{has a very}} short run which {{produces}} tremendous pace, and is another bowler whose action is subject to criticism. His delivery, to say the most, was unusual, and it was {{amazing to me that}} a bowler could generate so much pace from such a short run...he lands some four feet beyond the batting crease at the moment of delivery, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>tremendous</b> drag, and it means he delivers the ball from some nineteen yards.|$|E
25|$|From infancy, Rabbi Chaim Ozer {{was weak}} and sickly. However, he was gifted <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>tremendous</b> memory, never forgetting {{anything}} {{he had ever}} read or heard. He was also a deep thinker who developed clear explanations for every Torah topic he studied. At the age of 9, he was tested by Rabbi Yisroel Salanter, who asked the boy a question in halakha along with his own answer. The little Chaim Ozer refuted the Rav's thesis and cited a different one from the sources, astounding the Rav.|$|E

25|$|Early {{next morning}} an enemy plane spotted Harder. The {{submarine}} soon sighted another destroyer searching {{the area for}} her. As before, Harder took the initiative as the enemy closed the range. The sub fired three torpedoes at short range, {{and two of them}} struck amidships, one detonating the ship's magazine <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>tremendous</b> explosion. Hayanami sank a minute later. Following the inevitable depth charge attack, Harder transited the Sibutu Passage after dark and steamed to the northeast coast of Borneo. There on the night of 8 June she picked up six Australian Coastwatchers, and early next day she headed once more for Sibutu Passage.|$|E
25|$|Morrison {{won three}} fights in 1995 before meeting former #1 {{contender}} Razor Ruddock. Ruddock dropped Morrison {{to his knees}} in the first round, but Morrison recovered to force a standing count in round two and compete on even terms for five rounds. In the sixth round, Ruddock hurt Morrison with a quick combination, but just as it seemed Morrison was in trouble, he countered <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>tremendous</b> hook that put Ruddock on the canvas. Ruddock regained his feet, but Morrison drove him to the ropes and showered him with an extended flurry of blows. Just as the bell was about to sound, the referee stepped in and declared Morrison the winner by TKO.|$|E
25|$|Ordered to the Pacific, Hall {{departed}} Charleston, South Carolina on 21 December {{and arrived}} at Pearl Harbor 11 January 1944. On 22 January, she cleared Hawaii with Rear Admiral Richmond K. Turner's Expeditionary Force bound for the capture and occupation of the Marshall Islands, a giant step across the Pacific toward Japan. Sent with three cruisers and three other destroyers on a special mission to wreck the airfields on Tarao Island during the invasion, Hall joined in the devastating bombardment of that island 30 January. Her guns knocked out a gasoline dump <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>tremendous</b> explosion, hit several gun emplacements, and then screened the larger ships during {{the remainder of the}} firing. Tarao effectively neutralized, the ships then sailed for Kwajalein and the main assault.|$|E

25|$|With about {{a minute}} left in the round, Chávez hit Taylor {{squarely}} with several hard punches and stayed on the attack, continuing to hit Taylor with well-placed shots. Finally, with about 25 seconds to go, Chávez landed a hard right hand that caused Taylor to stagger forward towards a corner, forcing Chávez back ahead of him. Suddenly Chávez stepped around Taylor, positioning him so that Taylor was trapped in the corner, with no way to escape from Chávez' desperate final flurry. Chávez then nailed Taylor <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>tremendous</b> right hand that dropped the younger man. By using the ring ropes to pull himself up, Taylor managed to return to his feet and was given the mandatory 8-count. Referee Richard Steele asked Taylor twice if he was able to continue fighting, but Taylor failed to answer. Steele then concluded that Taylor was unfit to continue and signaled that he was ending the fight, resulting in a TKO victory for Chávez with only two seconds to go in the bout.|$|E
25|$|The tournament {{begun with}} a tough victory over FIBA Americas champions Mexico, 87–74. While the Mexicans won the first quarter 27–22, the Lithuanians then {{achieved}} their domination, marked by scoring 20 points against only 2 in the third quarter. One day later, another difficult match was held against African champions Angola, that the Lithuanians won 75–62, led by the young Donatas Motiejūnas and Jonas Valančiūnas, who scored a combined 23 points and defended the team with 18 rebounds. Tough games continued for Lithuania. The third game against Australia had the Lithuanians 19 points behind at halftime, winning the third quarter 28–15, and leading at some points of the concluding period, but still lost 75–82. Head coach Jonas Kazlauskas described the game as having the team's worst first half that season. The team recovered by sweeping South Korea 79–49, guaranteeing a spot at the knockout rounds and managing {{to become the first}} team in FIBA World Cup history to not have any free throw attempts. Lithuania took first spot in the group by closing <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>tremendous</b> victory against Slovenia, 67–64, with the Slovenians only scoring two points in the fourth quarter.|$|E
25|$|Amerike – The Golden Land {{tells the}} journey of America’s Jewish {{ancestors}} who emigrated from their towns and cities in Europe and Russia (especially the Pale of Settlement) {{to start a new}} life in America. The characters in this story start off <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>tremendous</b> amount of hope in leaving their homes and starting new lives in NYC. However, their notions of America as a free land are shattered at Ellis Island when they witness families being torn apart to Ellis Island’s selection process. Life turns out to be quite difficult in America, the characters in the show soon discover. Poor wages, long hours, and sweatshop conditions are horrors that tug at the seams of the characters. Events such as the Triangle Factory Fire, Workers Unionization, the Wall Street Crash of 1929, The Great Depression, World War I, and the Holocaust – World War II are telling points of the story in showing these immigrants growth, participation, and contribution to American economy and culture. The story ends on a hopeful and spirited note where survivors of the Holocaust are welcomed into the United States by the immigrants who fought to create a life for themselves there. Told in popular songs of the day, Amerike – The Golden Land is performed in Yiddish with Russian and English supertitles.|$|E

25|$|The most {{commonly}} used vegetable in Lithuanian recipes is the potato; in its simplest forms, it is boiled, baked, or sauteed, often garnished <b>with</b> dill, but <b>a</b> <b>tremendous</b> variety of potato recipes exist. Potatoes were introduced into Lithuania in the late 18th century, were found to prosper in its climate, and soon became indispensable.|$|R

25|$|Francis M. Walker's men, which {{included}} his 19th Tennessee Infantry {{as well as}} Maney's old brigade, had not been engaged that day since they had been marched and countermarched almost back to their original position. Cleburne placed Walker's brigade on the left front of the attacking force. The attack was launched with about 3,500 men in total, with 2,000 more in a second wave, at about 6:00p.m. Cleburne himself led the attack with Walker's brigade. The Union force had about half {{the number of men}} but they were behind their defenses. Emerging from a stand of woods, Walker's men were hard hit and began to retreat before Cleburne and Maney rallied them. Then they moved with a two-sided assault with troops to their right toward the Union line. Despite taking about 100 casualties in their previous advances, Walker's men followed Walker, who was waving his sword in encouragement, toward the crest of the hill. As they reached the crest, Walker's brigade was hit <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>tremendous</b> volley from defenders over the crest. Walker was killed by that volley. He had been appointed a brigadier general the previous day but he had not yet received written notification of his appointment. Walker's commission arrived at his headquarters the day after he was killed. After Walker's death, many of his men diverted to another point of attack to try to take a Union battery and suffered severe casualties. As night fell, the Confederates could not continue the attack and the Union troops held their fort {{at the top of the}} hill. The Confederates had sustained over 600 casualties while the Union defenders had endured about 550 casualties in the Battle of Bald Hill, which was but a small part of the overall Battle of Atlanta.|$|E

It first discusses the connection between early adversity and child developmental outcomes. Then it mentions {{the presence of the}} remarkable amount of individual differences present in the outcome of previously institutionalized children as a result of adoption. Finally, it questions why such a powerful effect as early adversity is associated <b>with</b> such <b>a</b> <b>tremendous</b> amount of individual differences and suggests that this diversification can be related to the action of the epigenome...|$|R

To handle this growth, systems need to be pushed towards more openness, decomposition and entry-points for services on various levels. This paper establishes patterns for service decomposition, collated from productive systems. It thus supports architectural design of large-scale digital libraries, as well as shapes communication between distinct architectures. At the end of this path we see functional interoperability of large-scale digital libraries, and a digital library environment that is shared on multiple levels...|$|R

But Francis and I worked together. ... It was collaborative. He's a really pop video director and a filmmaker.

500|$|David Duchovny {{initially}} suggested {{having a}} Walter Skinner-centric episode {{as a way}} to give himself a break, although ultimately he still ended up having a large part in the episode. Duchovny felt that Skinner was a good character who was not utilized to his full extent on the show. Duchovny's idea, which was written in collaboration with writer Howard Gordon, also surrounded the conceit that what Mulder and Skinner do comes <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>tremendous</b> price. Skinner's popularity amongst fans had risen with his increased role in the episodes [...] "The Blessing Way" [...] and [...] "Paper Clip" [...] and these episodes helped re-establish the ground rules regarding where Skinner stood in regards to the X-Files. Writer Vince Gilligan noted that Skinner was originally intended to be a bad guy, but because Mitch Pileggi was such a good actor the writers decided to not take his character in that direction.|$|E

Nevertheless, the StargateSG-1 actors and producers complimented Corin Nemec and the character. Richard Dean Anderson was impressed with Nemec's performance in [...] "Meridian", saying [...] "he really struck me as a bright guy, very respectful of the dynamic of the set, but with an awareness of what he wanted to bring."

500|$|... 300 writer Frank Miller said: [...] "The Spartans were a {{paradoxical}} people. They were the biggest slave owners in Greece. But {{at the same}} time, Spartan women had an unusual level of rights. It's a paradox {{that they were a}} bunch of people who in many ways were fascist, but they were the bulwark against the fall of democracy. The closest comparison you can draw in terms of our own military today is to think of the red-caped Spartans as being like our special-ops forces. They're these almost superhuman characters <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>tremendous</b> warrior ethic, who were unquestionably the best fighters in Greece. I didn't want to render Sparta in overly accurate terms, because ultimately I do want you to root for the Spartans. I couldn't show them being quite as cruel as they were.
