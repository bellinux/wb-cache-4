40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to compare drag in {{swimming}} children and adults, quantify technique using the technique drag index (TDI), and use the Froude number (Fr) to study whether children or adults reach hull speed at maximal velocity (vmax). Active and passive drag was measured by the perturbation method and a velocity decay method, respectively, including 9 children aged 11. 7 ± 0. 8 and 13 adults aged 21. 4 ± 3. 7. The children had significantly lower active (kAD) and passive drag factor (kPD) compared with the adults. TDI (kAD/kPD) could not detect any differences in swimming technique between the two groups, owing to the adults swimming maximally at a higher Fr, increasing the wave drag component, and masking the effect of better technique. The children were found not to reach hull speed at vmax, and their Fr were 0. 37 ± 0. 01 vs. the adults 0. 42 ± 0. 01, indicating adults’ larger <b>wave-making</b> component of <b>resistance</b> at vmax compared with children. Fr is proposed as an evaluation tool for competitive swimmers...|$|R
40|$|The Holtrop & Mennen {{method is}} widely used at the initial design stage of ships for {{estimating}} {{the resistance of the}} ship (Holtrop and Mennen, 1982). The Holtrop & Mennen method provide a prediction of the total resistance’s components. In this work we present a neural network model which performs the same task as the Holtrop & Mennem’s method, for two of the total resistance’s components. A multilayer perceptron has been therefore trained to learn the relationship between the input (length-displacement ratio, prismatic coefficient, longitudinal position of the centre of buoyancy, after body form and Froude number) and the target variables (form factor and <b>wave-making</b> and wave-breaking <b>resistance</b> per unit weight of displacement). The network architecture with best generalization properties was obtained through an exhaustive validation analysis (Bishop, 1995). The results of this model have been compared against those provided by the Holtrop & Mennen method, and {{it was found that the}} quality of the prediction is improved over the entire range of data.

40|$|Three interrelated {{topics in}} ship hydrodynamics - <b>resistance,</b> <b>wave-making</b> and wave decay - are {{investigated}} {{in an attempt}} to improve the accuracy of some simple methods used in the preliminary design of thin ships. Several published sets of data from classical and recent boundary layer experiments on flat plates are used to estimate boundary layer quantities such as thicknesses and eddy viscosities. These quantities are subsequently used to modify the hull shape and the free-surface boundary condition as a means of including viscous effects on wave-making and ship-wave decay. A recent technique is used to analyse 161 experimental flat-plate turbulent boundary layer velocity profiles, and a new skin-friction line is derived. Some practical methods are proposed for the numerical quadrature of integrals arising in thin-ship hydrodynamics. We demonstrate that for some integrals, rapid oscillation, rather than being a hindrance to accurate quadrature, can actually be beneficial if appropriate techniques are employed. We find that boundary layer displacement thickness effects on wave resistance are very small and can be safely ignored for full-size vessels. On the other hand, the idea of a detachment layer, an indication of where the boundary layer begins to thicken rapidly, is shown to {{have a significant effect on}} wave resistance. A modification to the Kelvin free-surface boundary condition is used as a means of including viscous effects on wave-making. Detailed comparisons of total resistance predictions and experiments are made for three model-size Wigley hulls. It is shown that inclusion of viscous effects smooths out the well-known humps and hollows in the wave resistance curves calculated using Michell's (inviscid) integral. Predictions of the total resistance of a model Wigley hull using Michell's integral and a simple skin-friction line are shown to be as good as those of a modern CFD computer code. Furthermore, the simple method does so in a very small time on an inexpensive computer. The effect of employing a form factor on the skin-friction is shown to improve correlations between resistance predictions and experiments. It has recently been proposed that a form factor should also be applied to the wave resistance. We show that good predictions are indeed possible, but that the use of a modified form of Michell's integral and an “appropriate" value of the eddy viscosity leads to even better agreement. Two existing wave-decay models are examined and a new formulation is suggested that combines the theoretical – 1 / 2 decay rate of transverse waves with the - 1 / 3 decay rate of diverging waves. The effects of viscosity on ship-wave decay are considered. It is found that large values of the viscosity, of the order required to have a significant effect on wave resistance, lead to an over-damping of far-field waves at low Froude numbers. We show that it may be possible to get a rough estimate of the (ambient) eddy viscosity from an analysis of the decay of ship-waves with transverse distance from the sailing line, without resorting to computationally expensive Fourier transform methods. Three wave decay models are used to estimate the eddy viscosity from the behaviour of the wave decay. The model that uses the theoretical decay rates of transverse and of diverging waves is found to be slightly better at recapturing the original eddy viscosity than the other two models. Thesis (Ph.

50|$|<b>Wave-making</b> <b>resistance</b> {{is a form}} of drag {{that affects}} surface watercraft, such as boats and ships, and {{reflects}} the energy required to push the water {{out of the way of}} the hull. This energy goes into creating the wave.|$|E
50|$|As a ship {{moves in}} the water, it creates {{standing}} waves that oppose its movement. This effect increases dramatically in full-formed hulls at a Froude number of about 0.35, which corresponds to a speed-length ratio (see below for definition) of slightly less than 1.20 (this {{is due to a}} rapid increase of resistance due to the transverse wave train). When the Froude Number grows to ~0.40 (speed-length ratio about 1.35), the <b>wave-making</b> <b>resistance</b> increases further due to the divergent wave train. This trend of increase in <b>wave-making</b> <b>resistance</b> continues up to a Froude Number of about 0.45 (speed-length ratio about 1.50) and does not reach its maximum until a Froude number of about 0.50 (speed-length ratio about 1.70).|$|E
50|$|Elite {{swimmers}} {{are generally}} {{taller than the}} populations at large, indicating that height confers a competitive advantage. A main factor in swimming {{is the amount of}} drag the swimmer has to overcome when swimming. Drag is composed of pressure drag, friction drag, and <b>wave-making</b> <b>resistance.</b>|$|E
50|$|When a wave is encountered, {{the lack}} of {{buoyancy}} means the hull pierces through the water rather than riding over the top, resulting in a smoother ride than traditional designs, and in diminished mechanical stress on the vessel and crew. It also reduces a boat's <b>wave-making</b> <b>resistance.</b>|$|E

50|$|A {{simple way}} of {{considering}} <b>wave-making</b> <b>resistance</b> {{is to look}} at the hull in relation to bow and stern waves. If the length of a ship is half the length of the waves generated, the resulting wave will be very small due to cancellation, and if the length is the same as the wavelength, the wave will be large due to enhancement.|$|E
50|$|The phase {{speed of}} {{deepwater}} waves {{is proportional to}} the square root of the wavelength of the generated waves, and the length of a ship causes the difference in phases of waves generated by bow and stern parts. Thus, there is a direct relationship between the waterline length (and thus wave propagation speed) and the magnitude of the <b>wave-making</b> <b>resistance.</b>|$|E
50|$|Ways {{to reduce}} <b>wave-making</b> <b>resistance</b> used on sailing vessels include reduced displacement—through planing or (as with a windsurfer) {{offsetting}} vessel weight with a lifting sail—and fine entry, as with catamarans, where a narrow hull minimizes the water displaced into a bow wave. Sailing hydrofoils also substantially reduce forward friction with an underwater foil that lifts the vessel {{free of the}} water.|$|E
50|$|Residuary {{resistance}} - Residuary resistance {{includes all}} other remaining types of resistance on an upright, bare hull in calm water. The {{reason for this}} grouping is {{that of all the}} types of hydrodynamic resistance imposed upon a boat hull in motion, only viscous drag can be cleanly isolated, as it scales proportionally to wetted surface area. Residuary resistance, then, is composed primarily of <b>wave-making</b> <b>resistance,</b> eddy formation and large-scale separation, all of which are too complex to be determined empirically given prior knowledge of hull geometry. These types of resistance can only be determined by model testing.|$|E
5000|$|A {{simple way}} of {{considering}} <b>wave-making</b> <b>resistance</b> {{is to look}} at the hull in relation to its wake. At speeds lower than the wave propagation speed, the wave rapidly dissipates to the sides. As the hull approaches the wave propagation speed, however, the wake at the bow begins to build up faster than it can dissipate, and so it grows in amplitude. Since the water is not able to [...] "get out of the way of the hull fast enough", the hull, in essence, has to climb over or push through the bow wave. This results in an exponential increase in resistance with increasing speed.|$|E
5000|$|The Lürssen effect, used in {{the design}} of {{high-speed}} boats, is a reduction in <b>wave-making</b> <b>resistance</b> provided by two small rudders mounted {{on each side of the}} main rudder and turned outboard. These rudders force the water under the hull outward, lifting the stern, thus reducing drag, and lowering the wake height, which “requires less energy, allowing the vessel to go faster.” [...] The effect was discovered by the German shipbuilding company Lürssen Werft based in Bremen-Vegesack. The Lürssen effect is best remembered for its use during the Second World War in the various classes German [...] "Schnellboot," [...] or fast torpedo attack boats.|$|E
50|$|A special type of bow, {{called a}} bulbous bow, {{is often used}} on large power vessels to reduce wave-making drag. The bulb alters the waves {{generated}} by the hull, by changing the pressure distribution ahead of the bow. Because {{of the nature of}} its destructive interference with the bow wave, there is a limited range of vessel speeds over which it is effective. A bulbous bow must be properly designed to mitigate the <b>wave-making</b> <b>resistance</b> of a particular hull over a particular range of speeds. A bulb that works for one vessel's hull shape and one range of speeds could be detrimental to a different hull shape or a different speed range. Proper design and knowledge of a ship's intended operating speeds and conditions is therefore necessary when designing a bulbous bow.|$|E
50|$|The Ross 930 is a {{class of}} fast cruiser-racer yachts named after its designer, New Zealander Murray Ross. The design is marked by light weight and {{moderate}} sail area, with a sail-area-to-displacement (SA/D) ratio of about 24, and displacement-to-length (D/L) ratio of 98. The bow section is quite narrow, providing relatively low <b>wave-making</b> <b>resistance</b> and reducing pounding while sailing upwind in waves, and the stern section is wide and flat, making the boat easy to control sailing fast downwind. The interior of the Ross 930 is comfortable, including (and requiring for racing) fitted berths for five, a two-burner stove, galley with sink, and a head. The standard engine is an outboard in a well (this must not be removed for racing), but a few boats were built with small inboard diesel engines.|$|E
50|$|A ship {{moving over}} the surface of {{undisturbed}} water sets up waves emanating mainly from the bow and stern of the ship. The waves created by the ship consist of divergent and transverse waves. The divergent waves are observed as the wake of a ship with a series of diagonal or oblique crests moving outwardly from the point of disturbance. These waves were first studied by William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin, who found that regardless of the speed of the ship, they were always contained in the 19 degree (each side) symmetric wedge following the ship. The divergent waves do not cause much resistance against the ships forward motion. However, the transverse waves appear as troughs and crests along the length of a ship and constitute the major part of the <b>wave-making</b> <b>resistance</b> of a ship. The energy associated with the transverse wave system travels at one half the phase velocity or the group velocity of the waves. The prime mover of the vessel must put additional energy into the system in order to overcome this expense of energy. The relationship between the velocity of ships and that of the transverse waves can be found by equating the wave celerity and the ship’s velocity.|$|E
40|$|Since {{the design}} of ships always {{involves}} compromise between vari-ous desired characteristics, {{it is necessary to}} find ways to develop hull forms in which reduced <b>wave-making</b> <b>resistance</b> is incorporated in that com-promise. Some way is needed to take hull forms which fulfill the other reqv. irements placed on them and then modify, them {{in such a way as}} to reduce their <b>wave-making</b> <b>resistance.</b> The method of steep descent appears suitable for this purpose. A hull form generated by fifty-five sources placed on the center line plane of a hull in five horizontal rows is modified using this method so that its <b>wave-making</b> <b>resistance</b> is decreased U 5 percent while the shape of the water line plane and the hull volume are, to first order, held constant.

40|$|Bridge deck {{splashing}} causes deterioration to {{the bridge}} structure and renders the bridge unsafe for motorist and pedestrians. The traditional countermeasure for bridge deck splashing is pier extension, the pier extension moves the pier wave away from the bridge deck, but retrofitting existing bridges with pier extensions is costly. This research proposes the bulbous pier concept {{as an alternative to}} pier extension. The decrease in the pier wave produced by the bulb is due to energy subtracted by the bulb via two forces, the viscous resistance, and the <b>wave-making</b> <b>resistance.</b> The proposed mathematical model for the bulbous pier design follows the model used for a mono hull ship. Under the mono hull model, the bulb length follows under the region were the viscous resistance is dominant. This allows for omitting the <b>wave-making</b> <b>resistance.</b> Since the <b>wave-making</b> <b>resistance</b> is obtained via modeling, the proposed set of equation do not requires modeling to calculate the pier wave reduction. The proposed equations to calculate non-bulb pier wave height (PLnb) are based in the assumption that the water energy is converted into potential energy at the pier- bulb intersection and determines the pier wave height. This assumption ignores the complex water-air interactions and the energy losses due to the water flow change of direction.
