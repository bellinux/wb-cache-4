25|$|Dutch Eurovision fans {{set up an}} Internet poll in July 2008 {{with the}} intent of {{selecting}} the best artist to send for the Netherlands. Anouk was selected by the poll, and she has also stated that she would represent the Netherlands in 2009, but <b>would</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> participate in a national final.|$|E
25|$|For example, {{people with}} Tourette {{syndrome}} and related tic disorders make involuntary movements and utterances (called tics) {{despite the fact}} that they <b>would</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> do so when it is socially inappropriate. Tics are described as semi-voluntary or unvoluntary, because they are not strictly involuntary: they may be experienced as a voluntary response to an unwanted, premonitory urge. Tics are experienced as irresistible and must eventually be expressed. People with Tourette syndrome are sometimes able to suppress their tics for limited periods, but doing so often results in an explosion of tics afterward. The control exerted (from seconds to hours at a time) may merely postpone and exacerbate the ultimate expression of the tic.|$|E
25|$|In {{the longer}} term, FWS plans to create up to 30 acres (12 ha) of {{additional}} grassland {{by removing the}} runway pavement and restoring the original cover. An 8-foot (2 m) wide strip of concrete would be left {{for use as a}} public trail. While grasses are already beginning to grow through cracks in the runways, the agency <b>would</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> wait as aircraft continue to make illegal landings at the refuge, disturbing the birds, despite markings on the runways themselves and on aviation charts of the area indicating that the facility is closed. It has not yet determined how this will be done in the most environmentally sensitive fashion. Similarly, it hopes to restore the original stream pattern through the property by removing the culverts and other reroutings made during construction of the airfield.|$|E

2500|$|On October 7, Cuban President Osvaldo Dorticós Torrado {{spoke at}} the UN General Assembly: [...] "If... we are attacked, we will defend ourselves. I repeat, we have {{sufficient}} means with which to defend ourselves; we have indeed our inevitable weapons, the weapons, which we <b>would</b> have <b>preferred</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> acquire, and which we do <b>not</b> wish <b>to</b> employ." ...|$|R
25|$|A {{panel of}} The Heart Rhythm Society, a {{specialist}} {{organization based in}} Washington, DC {{found that it was}} legal and ethical to honor requests by patients, or by those with legal authority to make decisions for patients, to deactivate implanted cardiac devices. Lawyers say that the legal situation is similar to removing a feeding tube, though there is currently no legal precedent involving pacemakers in the United States of America. A patient in the United States is thought to have a right to refuse or discontinue treatment, including a pacemaker that keeps him or her alive. Physicians have a right to refuse to turn it off, but are advised by the HRS panel that they should refer the patient to a physician who will. Some patients believe that hopeless, debilitating conditions, like those brought on by severe strokes or late-stage dementia, can cause so much suffering that they <b>would</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> prolong their lives with supportive measures, such as cardiac devices.|$|E
2500|$|After the game, Bo Schembechler denied {{running up}} the score, having used 53 players in the game. [...] Schembechler told the press told the press that his squad was not a great team and that he <b>would</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be ranked #1.|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, during CNN {{coverage}} of the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, he confronted Sen. Mary Landrieu, Sen. Trent Lott, and the Reverend Jesse Jackson about {{their perception of the}} government response. As Cooper said later in an interview with New York magazine, “Yeah, I <b>would</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be emotional and I <b>would</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> get upset, but it's hard not to when you’re surrounded by brave people who are suffering and in need.” As Broadcasting & Cable magazine noted, [...] "In its aftermath, Hurricane Katrina served to usher in a new breed of emo-journalism, skyrocketing CNN's Anderson Cooper to superstardom as CNN's golden boy and a darling of the media circles because of his impassioned {{coverage of}} the storm." ...|$|E
30|$|Of the {{patients}} in the suture group, 30.7  % <b>would</b> have <b>preferred</b> no suture. In the non-suture group, 87.5  % would be happy for future laparoscopy incisions of a similar size to be left open. Although no statistical differences were seen, 59.1  % of {{the patients}} overall <b>would</b> <b>prefer</b> incisions <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be sutured in future laparoscopies.|$|R
2500|$|Davidson telephoned Reith {{about his}} idea on 7 May, {{saying he had}} spoken to the Prime Minister, Stanley Baldwin, who had {{said he would not}} stop the broadcast, but <b>would</b> <b>prefer</b> it <b>not</b> <b>to</b> happen.

6000|$|... 'In the meantime, I {{am going}} to the door, sir,' {{returned}} the old man so savagely, as to render it clear that in a choice of difficulties he felt he must go, though he <b>would</b> have <b>preferred</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> go. 'Stay here the while, all! Affery, my woman, move an inch, or speak a word in your foolishness, and I'll treble your dose!' ...|$|R
2500|$|Some {{organizations}} {{attempt to}} respond to this privacy-related concern. For example, the 2005 Wikimania conference required that photographers have the prior permission of the people in their pictures, albeit this made it impossible for photographers to practice candid photography and doing the same in a public place would violate the photographers' free speech rights. Some people wore a 'no photos' tag to indicate they <b>would</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> have their photo taken.|$|E
2500|$|It {{is unfortunate}} that {{the latest round of}} [...] "Humans vs. Zombies" [...] was playing itself out {{on the day of the}} events at Virginia Tech, and it is true that the student {{organizers}} of the game must be more vigilant about keeping it from interfering with classes and disrupting the daily lives of those who <b>would</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be involved in it. We are working with them to assess the game and its future at Goucher.|$|E
2500|$|According to {{the first}} two lines, the heart wants one thing (emotional love) and the eye wants {{something}} different (physical beauty). The third and fourth lines {{make it clear that}} while the eye is fixated on the physical appearance of the young man, the heart <b>would</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> see the person's physical appearance. [...] Instead, it would focus on emotional love. [...] Lines five and six state that the young man who is the object of the poem resides inside the speaker's heart, where he is unseen by the [...] "crystal eyes". [...] The seventh and eighth lines state that the eyes disagree with the heart and argue that they are capable of detecting of the beauty of a person.|$|E
5000|$|Joshua Dratel, {{one of the}} {{officers}} of the Project, defended the actions of the attorneys saying “If you get information in the public record, it doesn’t become classified just because the government feels it is embarrassing or that they <b>would</b> <b>prefer</b> you <b>not</b> <b>to</b> show it to anyone. There is no prohibition on gathering public-source information and showing it to your client.” ...|$|R

2500|$|Despite this success, Belisarius {{was well}} aware that his {{situation}} was still dangerous. He therefore {{wrote a letter to}} Justinian, asking for aid. Indeed, Justinian had already dispatched reinforcements under the tribunes Martinus and Valerian, but they had been delayed in Greece due to bad weather. In his letter, Belisarius also added cautionary words concerning the loyalty of the populace: [...] "And although at the present time the Romans are well disposed toward us, yet when their troubles are prolonged, they will probably not hesitate to choose the course which is better for their own interests. [...] Furthermore, the Romans will be compelled by hunger to do many things they <b>would</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> do." [...] For fear of treason, extreme measures were taken by Belisarius: Pope Silverius was deposed on suspicions of negotiating with the Goths and replaced by Vigilius, the locks and keys of the gates were changed [...] "twice each month", the guards on gate duty regularly rotated, and patrols set up.|$|E
2500|$|The {{tone of the}} Moria {{sequence}} was altered. In the book, {{following the}} defeat on the Caradhras road, Gandalf advocates the Moria road against {{the resistance of the}} rest of the Fellowship (save Gimli), suggesting [...] "there is a hope that Moria is still free...there is even a chance that Dwarves are there," [...] though no one seems to think this likely. [...] Frodo proposes they take a company vote, but the discovery of Wargs on their trail forces them to accept Gandalf's proposal. [...] They only realize the Dwarves are all dead once they reach Balin's tomb. [...] The filmmakers chose instead for Gandalf to resist the Moria plan as a foreshadowing device. Gandalf says to Gimli he <b>would</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> enter Moria, and Saruman is shown to be aware of Gandalf's hesitance, revealing an illustration of the Balrog in one of his books. The corpses of the dwarves are instantly shown as the Fellowship enter Moria. One detail that many critics commented upon is the fact that, in the novel, Pippin tosses a mere pebble into the well in Moria ("They then hear what sounds like a hammer tapping in the distance"), whereas in the film, he knocks an entire skeleton in ("Next, the skeleton ... falls down the well, also dragging down a chain and bucket. The noise is incredible.") ...|$|E
2500|$|St. John's {{runs counter}} to the usual {{emphasis}} on rankings and selectivity. In the past, St. John's College chose {{not to participate in}} any collegiate rankings surveys and did not provide requested survey information. However, the school was still included in many ranking guides. In 2014, Annapolis President Christopher B. Nelson wrote a post to address the issue in his SignPosts for Liberal Education blog: After many years of refusing to participate at all in the rankings generated by U.S. News & World Report—one of the most prominent providers of college rankings—St. John's this year submitted statistical information for its survey. This change in practice was prompted by engaged parents who increasingly were asking whether the underlying data about St. John's in U.S. News was reliable. Since we were not submitting information, we could not vouch for its reliability. Although St. John's <b>would</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be ranked, and has long asked not to be ranked, U.S. News continued to rank us. We concluded, therefore, that we had to supply statistical data in order to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information U.S. News was publishing about us.St. John's experienced an unprecedented leap upward in the 2014 U.S. News rankings after submitting data (as opposed to not providing information and still being ranked), as reported in the Washington Post.|$|E
50|$|Although {{pressured}} by the French {{government and the}} French hierarchy, Pope Gregory XVI <b>would</b> have <b>preferred</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> make an official issue of the matter. After much opposition, they gained an audience on March 15, 1832, only on condition that their political views should not be mentioned. The meeting was apparently cordial and uneventful. Klemens von Metternich, whose Austrian troops ensured {{the stability of the}} Papal States, pressed for a condemnation.|$|R
60|$|But it was {{not until}} Eddy's letter came that she {{realized}} the completeness of the change. On 1 May she would have thanked Eddy politely for his trouble, adding, however, that she <b>would</b> really <b>prefer</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> meet poor Joe again. On 16 May she welcomed him as something Heaven-sent. The fact that she was to be employed outweighed a thousand-fold the fact that her employer was to be Joe.|$|R

2500|$|In 2001, British Prime Minister Tony Blair advised Queen Elizabeth II {{to confer}} on Black a life peerage {{with the title}} of Baron Black of Crossharbour. He would sit as a {{conservative}} peer, and his name had been put forward by the then conservative leader, William Hague. Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chrétien advised the Queen not to appoint Black a peer, citing the Nickle Resolution of 1919 and a long history since then of objections to Canadian citizens accepting British peerages. Black at the time held both Canadian and British citizenship. Black {{pointed out that the}} Nickle Resolution referred to Canadian resident citizens, not dual citizens living in the U.K and was not binding, but when Prime Minister Blair said the Queen <b>would</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> choose between the conflicting recommendations of two prime ministers of countries of which she was the monarch, Black asked that the matter be deferred. He litigated in Canada, claiming that Chrétien had no jurisdiction to create a class of citizen in another country, consisting of one person (as there were other dual citizens in the House of Lords), ineligible to receive an honour in that country for services deemed to have been rendered in that country, because of the personal objections of the Canadian Prime Minister of the day. Later in 2001, after the Ontario Superior Court and Court of Appeal had ruled that they had no jurisdiction in this area, Black renounced his Canadian citizenship, remaining a United Kingdom citizen, which allowed him to accept the peerage without further controversy.|$|E
2500|$|Executive {{producer}} Ronald D. Moore {{points out}} that the Cylons and Al Qaeda are not necessarily intended to be allegorical: [...] "They have aspects of Al Qaeda and they have aspects of the Catholic Church and they have aspects of America" [...] and in contrast, with the New Caprica storyline the show's humans have been discussed as an allegory not for an America under attack but for an occupied people mounting an insurgency and turning to suicide bombings as a tactic. There is a consensus that with [...] "its third season, the show has morphed into a stinging allegorical critique of America’s three-year occupation of Iraq" [...] as the [...] "cameras record Cylon occupation raids on unsuspecting human civilians with the night-vision green familiar to any TV news viewer.

[...] According to Slate [...] "If this sounds like Iraq, it should", and [...] "In unmistakable terms, Battlestar Galactica is telling viewers that insurgency (like, say, the one in Iraq) might have some moral flaws, such as the whole suicide bombing thing, but is ultimately virtuous and worthy of support."
