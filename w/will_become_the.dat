Part of the saccule will eventually give rise and connect to the cochlear duct. This duct appears approximately during the sixth week and connects to the saccule through the ductus reuniens.|$|E

5|$|Most starfish embryos hatch at the blastula stage. The {{original}} ball {{of cells}} develops a lateral pouch, the archenteron. The entrance {{to this is}} known as the blastopore and it will later develop into the anus. Another invagination of the surface will fuse with the tip of the archenteron as the mouth while the interior section <b>will</b> <b>become</b> <b>the</b> gut. At the same time, a band of cilia develops on the exterior. This enlarges and extends around the surface and eventually onto two developing arm-like outgrowths. At this stage the larva is known as a bipinnaria. The cilia are used for locomotion and feeding, their rhythmic beat wafting phytoplankton towards the mouth.|$|E
5|$|Neptunium-237 is {{the most}} mobile {{actinide}} in the deep geological repository environment.
