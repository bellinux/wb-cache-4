Peter has a crush on his popular next door neighbor Mary Jane Watson, but they both have unhappy lives: Mary Jane has an abusive father and suffers at home while Peter suffers the torment of bullies at school ("No More"). Peter has lived with Uncle Ben and Aunt May ever since his parents Richard and Mary Parker {{died in a plane}} crash when he was a baby. A few days later, Peter and classmates go on a field trip to the genetics laboratory of scientist Norman Osborn and his wife Emily, who explain <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>hope</b> to accomplish with their genetic research ("D.I.Y. World"). While Peter takes pictures of the lab for the school newspaper, the Osborns put the whole lab on lockdown as a dangerous genetically altered spider has escaped. While the students and scientists panic, the spider lowers itself onto Peter's shoulder and bites him ("Venom").|$|E
500|$|In {{the book}} The Meanings of [...] "Beauty and the Beast": A Handbook, author Jerry Griswold {{observed}} that the [...] "Something There" [...] musical sequence is preceded by [...] "the once feisty Belle ... bandaging and nursing [...] " [...] after he rescues her from the wolves. Contextually, {{the purpose of the}} song has been identified as [...] "Dramatizing [...] partnership." [...] Leading up to the musical sequence, the Beast first [...] "surprises Belle by showing her his library and then they learn to eat together." [...] Author Robin O. Winter observed that [...] "During the scene they begin to see beneath their outer appearances and start to appreciate each other's inner qualities," [...] while one critic identified this as one of the scenes in [...] "which Belle and the Beast hesitantly slowly open up to one another." [...] Writing for Wesleyan University, Rachel Anne Silverman observed that [...] "Something There" [...] depicts [...] "The first time Belle and the Beast's attraction is introduced," [...] describing the couple's relationship as [...] "a passion that has developed over time." [...] Initially, Belle is alarmed [...] "as she realizes her growing love for the Beast," [...] briefly hiding behind a tree as she sings. According to the Hal Leonard Corporation and Music Theatre International, the castle's staff of enchanted objects also discover [...] "something different between Belle and the Beast." [...] "Something There" [...] concludes with Belle and the Beast retreating to a fireplace and reading. In the original film, [...] "Something There" [...] immediately precedes the film's title song. However, for its special edition re-release, the song is immediately followed by the newly reinstated [...] "Human Again".Identifying the song as [...] "where the genius of music as storytelling kicks in," [...] Simon Brew of Den of Geek felt that [...] "Something There" [...] is [...] "the track with the heaviest workload." [...] The author observed that [...] "In two minutes and 19 seconds, [...] gets across just how the position and feelings of the characters have changed." [...] For instance, [...] "At the beginning of 'Something There,' Belle admits that she thought the Beast was mean, coarse, and unrefined. By the end, she’s feeling pretty smitten," [...] according to Oh My Disney. The song also depicts the film's passing of time, while providing audiences with an opportunity [...] "to appreciate Beast and first see the potential for Belle and him." [...] On the song's role in the special edition version of the film, co-director Kirk Wise explained, [...] "There's a ... little suite of music now that starts with 'Something There' ... which segues into 'Human Again' which gives the object perspective on <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>hope</b> for when [...] fall in love and that transitions into 'Beauty and the Beast' the ballad, which is the culmination of their relationship." [...] Dubbing the song [...] "soliloquies of Belle and the Beast," [...] TV Guide drew comparisons between [...] "Something There" [...] and songs from the musical South Pacific.|$|E

The book deals with their efforts to find <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>hope</b> will be civilisation {{in the capital of}} the Island of Madagascar, which is something like the size of France. Unfortunately the reigning Queen has a hatred of Christianity which had been brought to the Island by missionaries some forty years before.

6000|$|Lichtenberg, a {{professor}} of physics, {{who was also a}} considerable hand at satire a hundred years ago, composed a collection of sayings, not without some wheat amid much chaff. A later German writer, of whom I will speak in a moment or two, Schopenhauer, has some excellent remarks on Self-reflection, and on the difference between those who think for themselves and those who think for other people; between genuine Philosophers, who look at things first hand for their own sake, and Sophists, who look at words and books for the sake of making an appearance before the world, and seek their happiness in <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>hope</b> to get from others: he takes Herder for an example of the Sophist, and Lichtenberg for the true Philosopher.

60|$|But why (it will be asked) {{spin out}} by these {{excessive}} methods {{a thread of}} such tenuity? Why go to such lengths for four months longer of fallacious solvency? I expect not to be believed, but I think the Government still hopes. A war-ship, under a hot-headed captain, might be decoyed into hostilities; the taxes might begin to come in again; the three Powers might become otherwise engaged and the little stage of Samoa escape observation--indeed, I know not <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>hope,</b> but they hope something. There lives on in their breasts a remainder coal of ambition still unquenched. Or it is only so that I can explain a late astonishing sally of his Honour's. In a long and elaborate judgment he has pared the nails, and indeed removed the fingers, of his only rival, the municipal magistrate. For eighteen months he has seen the lower Court crowded with affairs, the while his own stood unfrequented like an obsolete churchyard. He may have remarked with envy many hundred cases passing through his rival's hands, cases of assault, cases of larceny, ranging {{in the last four}} months from 2s. up to £1 12s.; or he may have viewed with displeasure that despatch of business which was characteristic of the magistrate, Mr. Cooper. An end, at least, has been made of these abuses. Mr. Cooper is henceforth to draw his salary for the minimum of public service; and all larcenies and assaults, however trivial, must go, according to the nationality of those concerned, before the Consular or the Supreme Courts.|$|E

60|$|Partly {{for its own}} sake, {{partly for}} ours, this most {{distinctive}} feature of the Far East, its marked impersonality, is well worthy particular attention; for while it collaterally suggests pregnant thoughts about ourselves, it directly underlies the deeper oddities of a civilization which is the modern eighth wonder of the world. We shall see this {{as we look at}} what these people are, at what they were, and at <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>hope</b> to become; not historically, but psychologically, as one might perceive, were he but wise enough, in an acorn, besides the nut itself, two oaks, that one from which it fell, and that other which from it will rise. These three states, which we may call its potential past, present, and future, may be observed and studied in three special outgrowths of a race's character: in its language, in its every-day thoughts, and in its religion. For in the language of a people we find embalmed the spirit of its past; in its every-day thoughts, be they of arts or sciences, is wrapped up its present life; in its religion lie enfolded its dreamings of a future. From out each of these three subjects in the Far East impersonality stares us in the face. Upon this quality as a foundation rests the Far Oriental character. It is individually rather than nationally that I propose to scan it now. It is the action of a particle in the wave of world-development I would watch, rather than the propagation of the wave itself. Inferences about the movement of the whole will follow of themselves a knowledge of the motion of its parts.|$|E
