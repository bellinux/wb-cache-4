5|$|On 10 February 2010, Pernod Ricard India {{announced}} that it had signed Shahrukh Khan, for an undisclosed amount, as the brand ambassador for Royal Stag, {{for a period of}} one year. The company said that Shahrukh <b>would</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> tandem with Saif Ali Khan, who has been the brand ambassador since 2007. In April 2013, social activist T Satish Kumar and student leader Banoth Amru Naik, from the Nalgonda district of Andhra Pradesh, {{filed a complaint with the}} State Human Rights Commission (SHRC) against Telugu film actor Mahesh Babu for endorsing Royal Stag. The annulment of the agreemenet would result in Sri Lanka Cricket losing its rights to organise matches at the stadium.|$|E
5|$|To {{meet the}} {{steadily}} escalating development {{costs of the}} vehicle, Sinclair decided to raise capital by selling {{some of his own}} shares in Sinclair Research to fund a separate company that would focus on electric vehicles. A £12 million deal was reached in March 1983, of which £8.3 million was used to fund the establishment of the new Sinclair Vehicles company. Sinclair recruited Barrie Wills, a veteran former employee of the DeLorean Motor Company, to lead Sinclair Vehicles as its managing director. Although Wills initially expressed scepticism about the viability of an electric vehicle – his twenty-five years in the motor industry had convinced him that an electric car was never going to happen – Sinclair managed to convince him that the project <b>would</b> <b>work.</b> <b>In</b> 1984, Sinclair Vehicles' new head office was established in Warwick in the West Midlands, an area with a long-established link with the motor industry.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's {{offense was}} led by an unusual two-quarterback system, as junior Sean Glennon shared time with {{freshman}} Tyrod Taylor. While Glennon {{proved to be a}} better pocket passer, Taylor's quickness enabled him to scramble out of trouble and gain positive yardage even when no open receivers were available for passes. Until the final game of the season, either Taylor or Glennon was hampered by injury and limited the two-quarterback system's effectiveness. Although the two-quarterback system proved effective against Virginia, there were still questions about how well such an unusual setup <b>would</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> the ACC Championship Game.|$|E

5|$|Gallagher {{was born}} on December 31, 1854 in Saint John, New Brunswick to Patrick and Katherine (née Maher) Gallagher. His father, Patrick came to Canada from Ireland {{at the age of}} 14, and worked in the meat industry, being a {{wholesale}} meat merchant and meat packer. His mother was a native of Saint John. Cornelius Gallagher would attend schooling during the 1870s in his hometown; later joining his father in his meat business. When his father relocated to Winnipeg in 1877, he established a wholesale and retail meat distribution business, P. Gallagher and Son, which Cornelius and his brother, Edward <b>would</b> <b>work</b> <b>in.</b> Cornelius Gallagher in 1888 moved to Battleford, North-West Territory (today in Saskatchewan) in 1888, where he bought out his father's firm's interests. There, he was on a contract to supply troops stationed {{in the aftermath of the}} suppression of the North-West Rebellion. In 1889, he moved south to Regina, where his business, Childs & Gallagher, supplied meat to the North-West Mounted Police. He remained there for two years, until 1891, when his contract with the Mounties expired.|$|E
5|$|Higher {{education}} {{first arrived}} at Pichilemu in 1970, when the Centro Medio Profesional de Pichilemu (Pichilemu Secondary-Professional Centre) was created; however, it was discontinued the next year. In 2002, thirty-one {{years after the}} Centro Medio Profesional was discontinued, the Universidad Academia de Humanismo Cristiano (Academy of Christian Humanism University) began to give classes of Engineering in Public Gesture Management, and Engineering in Environment Gesture Management. The university worked at the dependencies of Liceo Agustín Ross Edwards until 2008. At least ten people obtained their professional titles, while other ten {{are still in the}} process of obtaining their titles, as of December 2011. In November 2011, Governor of Cardenal Caro Province Julio Ibarra announced that an institute of higher education would be brought to the province, whose name, Instituto Profesional IPG (IPG Professional Institute), was disclosed one month later. During the inauguration of the 2012 school year in Pichilemu, Education Regional Secretary Minister (Seremi) Pedro Larraín said IPEGE <b>would</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> the dependencies of Colegio de la Preciosa Sangre of Pichilemu.|$|E
5|$|The 216th Army Air Forces Base Unit (Special) {{constructed}} prototype {{atomic weapons}} (without nuclear material) and drop tested them. Little {{was known about}} the flight characteristics of the prototype atom bomb designs and how the fusing mechanism <b>would</b> <b>work.</b> <b>In</b> February 1945, a Flight Test Section was created within the 216th Army Air Forces Base Unit to carry out testing with prototype bombs {{in the shape of}} the Little Boy and Fat Man bombs. It was originally equipped with five Silverplate B-29s, three flight crews and five maintenance crews. To help out with an increasingly demanding schedule, four crews from the 393d Bombardment Squadron were made available. The Flight Test Section carried out 24 drop tests in June and 30 in July. About two thirds of the June tests were with Fat Man shapes and the rest with Little Boy ones. In July, all but four of the tests were with Fat Man shapes, some with explosive-filled Pumpkin bombs. Test drops were carried out at Wendover, at the Naval Ordnance Test Station at Inyokern, and at the Salton Sea Naval Auxiliary Air Station. Testing continued up to the last minute, with the Fat Man firing unit, known as the X-unit, only being successfully tested at Wendover on 4 August, and a final test of the X-unit was carried out six days later.|$|E

25|$|In early 1947, Cartier-Bresson, with Robert Capa, David Seymour, William Vandivert and George Rodger founded Magnum Photos. Capa's brainchild, Magnum was a {{cooperative}} picture agency owned by its members. The team split photo assignments among the members. Rodger, who had quit Life in London after covering World War II, would cover Africa and the Middle East. Chim, who spoke {{a variety of}} European languages, <b>would</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> Europe. Cartier-Bresson would be assigned to India and China. Vandivert, who had also left Life, <b>would</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> America, and Capa would work anywhere that had an assignment. Maria Eisner managed the Paris office and Rita Vandivert, Vandivert's wife, managed the New York office and became Magnum's first president.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to numerous educational advances, Aristide and Lavalas {{embarked on an}} ambitious plan to develop the public primary health care system with Cuban assistance.

He also proved in the laboratory that rockets <b>would</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> the vacuum of space; nonetheless, his work was not taken seriously by the public.
