The Bf 109F-2 proved an excellent match to the Spitfire V, but Oesau disliked its reduced armament compared to the 'Emil', and continued to fly an E-4 model in preference to the Bf 109F, until lack of spares forced him to switch to the newer variant. Upon his appointment on 4 July 1941, he addressed JG 2 with the following words.|$|E

His season was {{interrupted}} <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> a stomach muscle against Liverpool which {{kept him out of}} action for over two months. Chelsea won the Premier League, only their second English top-flight championship and their first in 50 years, and the League Cup. Later, Drogba scored in extra time in a 3–2 final win against Liverpool at the Millennium Stadium, as well as reaching the semi-finals of the Champions League. Drogba scored a somewhat disappointing 16 goals in a total of 40 games for Chelsea in his first season: ten in the Premier League, five in the Champions League and one in the League Cup final.|$|E
5|$|Three {{practice}} sessions—two on Friday and a {{third on}} Saturday—were held before the Sunday race. The Friday morning and afternoon sessions lasted ninety minutes each; the third, one-hour session was held on Saturday morning. Mercedes conducted race simulations {{to see how the}} cars would behave with a heavy fuel load. Rosberg was fastest in the first practice session with a lap time of one minute and 35.461 seconds, ahead of teammate Hamilton in second. Alonso was third-fastest, ahead of Bottas and Kimi Räikkönen. Magnussen, Ricciardo, Button and Daniil Kvyat rounded out the session's top ten drivers. Verstappen's run ended early <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> {{over to the side of}} the track at the S curves with smoke billowing from his engine because of a broken exhaust valve, and Merhi spun at turn 13 (causing Bottas to swerve to avoid him).|$|E

5|$|On {{the same}} lap Irvine overtook his {{teammate}} Herbert for tenth position. Wurz {{crashed into the}} barriers at turn 1 {{and was forced to}} retire. Gené retired on lap 22 with a gearbox issue as his teammate Mazzacane subsequently collided with the barriers at turn one on the same lap and had to retire from the event. Herbert became the first driver to make a pit stop on lap 27 although his pit crew came unprepared and Herbert was stationary for half a minute before he exited in 17th position. On the 31st lap, Diniz made contact with the barriers at turn one and he damaged his left rear wheel, causing him to retire. Häkkinen's pace was reduced by lap 36 as he slowed with an blockage on his brake pedal and made an unscheduled pit stop. His team's mechanics opened his car's inspection hatch and rearranged radio cables. They subsequently removed a data transmitter which was the cause the blockage and Häkkinen rejoined in 9th. Trulli became the next retirement of the race <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> {{to the side of the}} track with a gearbox problem on the following lap.|$|E
5|$|When {{the race}} {{restarted}} on lap twelve, Michael Schumacher led, while Häkkinen and Villeneuve were running second and third. Behind them were Ralf Schumacher, Fisichella, Wurz, Gene, Heidfeld, Zonta, Mazzacane, Diniz, Salo and Alesi. Michael Schumacher began to immediately {{pull away from}} Häkkinen as he set consecutive fastest laps. Further down the field, Wurz overtook Diniz and Mazzacane for tenth position. By the start of lap 13, Michael Schumacher led Häkkinen by 2.1 seconds. Further back, Zonta passed Heidfeld to take ninth. On lap 14, Zonta moved up into seventh position after passing Gené and Wurz. Villeneuve became the third retirement of the race <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> {{over to the side}} of the track with gearbox problems on the same lap. Meanwhile, Verstappen overtook Fisichella to take fourth position. Heidfeld retired after his engine failed and spun off at Variante della Roggia chicane on lap 15. One lap later, Ralf Schumacher lost two positions after being passed by Verstappen and Zonta. Salo passed Mazzacane to claim ninth position on lap 17. At the start of the 19th lap, Zonta tried to pass Verstappen heading into the Variante Goodyear chicane, but Verstappen moved onto an early defensive line to prevent Zonta from moving ahead. Zonta attempted to overtake Verstappen into the Variante della Rogia chicane to take third place four laps later, but was unable to complete it as he ran wide. He managed to get ahead after exiting the chicane on the same lap.|$|E

Instead he joined Stockport County in another loan deal in January 2006, where he made his one and only appearance in a 1–1 draw with Torquay United on 31 January 2006. He returned to Bradford and played another three games, scoring in a 1–1 draw with Brentford on 8 April 2006.

500|$|Despite {{his strong}} 2011 {{performance}} and World Series exploits, new manager Mike Matheny assigned Craig {{the role of}} utility player in the outset of 2012, {{with the likes of}} veterans Carlos Beltrán, Berkman, and Holliday already stationed at first base and in the outfield corners. [...] Further, Craig spent all of April on the disabled list (DL) recovering from knee surgery. [...] However, when he returned to play May 1, the Cardinals designated outfielder Erik Komatsu for assignment to make room, and Craig found a windfall of playing time with Berkman now on the DL.

500|$|Having {{been drawn}} to face Gillingham {{in the first round}} of the League Cup, the club's manager, Paul Sturrock, planned to make a couple of changes to the team that faced Crystal Palace on the opening day of the new season, with youngster Joe Mason {{included}} in the squad. Two first-half goals were enough to take the hosts into the second round. Simeon Jackson put Gillingham ahead after 42 minutes and Andy Barcham scored a second just before the half-time break. Argyle reduced the deficit four minutes into the second-half when Luke Summerfield from a direct free kick, but they couldn't find an equaliser. The visitors should have forced extra time but Jamie Mackie spurned a chance <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> his shot wide with only the goalkeeper to beat. The defeat extended Sturrock's unfortunate run in the League Cup as a manager, having won just once in nine attempts.

500|$|The opening {{sequence}} of the episode was meant to replicate the same idea of season 2's premiere [...] "Man of Science, Man of Faith", where {{what seems to be}} a flashback is instead set on a new part of the island. Director Jack Bender questioned what Jack's goal was <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> on the chain, but Lindelof told him not to worry, because [...] "Fox will sell it, and he did". Lindelof described when Jack attacks his father at the AA meeting as [...] "pot-committed... it basically means you put so much money on the bluff, you can't fold your cards". The scene with Kate in a dress was inspired by Raiders of the Lost Ark, where Belloq gives a dress for Marion Ravenwood to wear, and was intended to make [...] "tom-boyish" [...] Kate feel vulnerable. The title, inspired by Charles Dickens' eponymous novel, refers to the reveal of another [...] "city" [...] on the island with the place where the Others live, in addition to the castaways' beach camp. The episode has only three characters of the second season's main cast, Jack, Kate and Sawyer. Lindelof later described this limited scope as [...] "a mistake, when the audience is away from the show for that long, they want to see everybody", causing the following season openers to have scenes with most of the main characters.|$|E
