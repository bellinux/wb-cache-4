40|$|AbstractA {{fabrication}} {{method is}} adopted for which an imaginary gear simultaneously realizes conjugated meshing with an arc tooth cylindrical gear and an arc tooth face-gear. The cutter fillet and tooth crest edge form the tooth root fillet of the gear, and the linear tooth surface equation of the imaginary gear and the position vector of the curvature center of the cutter fillet are constructed with certain cutter inclination to deduce a <b>working</b> <b>arc</b> tooth surface equation. The tooth root fillet equation of the arc tooth face-gear {{is derived from the}} meshing geometry and kinematics. A numerically controlled machining model of the arc tooth face-gear is established through the transformation of adjustment parameters from the cutter-tilt milling machine to a common multi-axis NC machine. Motion parameters of each movement axis of the NC machine are acquired. A processing example is presented to verify the precision of the fabrication method in processing the arc tooth face-gear. The method provides a theoretical and tentative basis for the analysis of tooth surface contact stress, tooth root bending stress and dynamics. A hobbing test is conducted to demonstrate the good meshing condition of the arc tooth face-gear pair...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1969 Purposes and Method of Study The {{purpose of}} this study was to find out if tenth grade girls were aware of the {{probability}} that a majority of them would work at some time during their lives, and if they planned to prepare for this possibility. A questionnaire was designed and validated to attempt to determine these aspirations and expectations. Six hundred questionnaires were then sent to 24 Oregon high schools where the home economics teachers administered them to the sophomore girls in their classes, A total of 508 usable questionnaires were returned. The questions proposed for study were: 1. What do tenth grade girls aspire to educationally? 2. Are their educational goals related to the choices their mothers have made? 3. What are the future plans of the tenth grade girls ? a. Do sophomore girls see themselves in the future as mainly wives and mothers? b. If they plan to marry, do they reject working as a part of their life pattern? 4. For what reasons will they work? 5. What are tenth grade girls' views of what they will be doing at age 30 and after their children are grown? What are tenth, grade girls' preferences for their mothers' working or not working? How does this influence their choice for themselves? 7. What influences the opinions of sophomore girls about women working? 8. Are sophomore girls aware of the facts about women working today? 9. Is there a need to place more emphasis on wage-earning skills in the home economics curriculum or is there a need to continue to emphasize home and family living? Findings In general, the respondents aspired to graduate from high school. This choice was the same as the education the respondents° mothers received. The girls tended to see themselves mainly as wives and mothers, but a large majority included some work plans in the expectations for their lives. The respondents tended to be unrealistic about the reasons they might take jobs. Though most said that the need for money would be the main reason for working, the next two largest groups said that they would take a job because they erjoyed <b>working</b> <b>arc</b> in order to have something to do. They did not consider a husband's injury or death, divorce, or never marrying as good reasons for working. A majority of the respondents expected to be home taking care of their children at age 30. Forty-two percent expected to be working part time after their children are grown, but just a few less (38 percent) expected to be keeping a home during these years. The largest number of respondents preferred their mothers to keep a home full time, but in many cases made different choices for themselves than they made for their mothers. Most of the respondents felt that no one had influenced their opinions about women working. Many others felt they were mostly influenced by their mother's opinions, The respondents were quite accurate in estimating the average life-expectancy of teen-aged girls and the number of years they could expect to live after their children are grown. The respondents' estimates were not very accurate when they were asked to guess the average number of women working today (they estimated very high), and the average number of years a woman will probably work (they estimated very low). Implications The main implication of this study is that students do not seem to be realistic about planning their lives. They appear to be aware of the facts about how many women are working today, how long they will probably live, and how many years of life they will have after their children are grown. Of the 508 respondents, 80. 3 percent planned to work, 56 percent after they married. Nevertheless, the respondents quite unrealistically did not plan to get very much training or education to prepare themselves for any type of job. Nearly one third of the respondents planned to go no further with their education than high school. Because of the unrealistic attitude of the girls toward preparation for their future employment, it seems that homemaking teachers need to find ways to help these girls to become more aware of the problems in the world of work, and to help them to learn skills that will make them more employable when they need or want to work. More than one fourth of the respondents expected to be working at age 30, and over half planned to be working after their children are grown. However, family life instruction is still a definite need. So few of the respondents answered that they would take a job if their husband died or was injured, or if there was a divorce, that it points to a need for more emphasis on family interaction and even realistic family finance. To leave out these teachings in favor of job training would be a mistake in light of these findings; but a combination of the two needs to be taught in the home economics curriculum...|$|E

40|$|Scenario-based design (Carroll 2 ̆ 6 Rosson, 2002) is a Human-Computer Interaction {{methodology}} for considering {{the needs of}} potential users, without their direct input. Scenario-based design gives the interface designer {{the ability to create}} scenarios of use, along with postulations on the various types of users, expressed in the form of personas (Grudin 2 ̆ 6 Pruitt, 2002). These scenarios and personas can be useful {{in the context of a}} design project, where real world issues preclude the direct involvement of users at a critical stage. By ‘walking through’ informal narrative descriptions in the form of a story, scenario-based design focuses on human activity rather than technology. We propose that scenario-based design can be utilised to fill gaps in a collaborative project, where, due to circumstances beyond the control of the designer, other parties have not provided vital information before the prototyping stage. Scenario-based design can allow us, as designers, to consider the needs of our potential users when circumstances mean that we would not otherwise be able to.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} a {{three-dimensional}} (3 D) time-dependent magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model under peculiar conditions of very high pressures (from 2 MPa up to 10 MPa) and low currents (< 1 A). Studies on plasma <b>arc</b> <b>working</b> under these unusual conditions remain almost unexplored because of the technical and technological challenges to develop a reactor able to sustain a plasma at very high pressures. The combined effect of plasma reactivity and high pressure would probably open the way towards new promising applications in various fields: chemistry, lightning, materials or nanomaterial synthesis. A MHD model helps one to understand the complex and coupled phenomena surrounding the plasma which cannot be understood by simply experimentation. The model also provides data which are difficult to directly determine experimentally. The model simulates an experimental-based batch reactor working with helium. The particular reactor in question was used to investigate the Fischer-Tropsch application, fluorocarbon production and CO 2 retro-conversion. However, as a first approach in terms of MHD, the model considers the case for helium as a non-reactive working gas. After a detailed presentation of the model, a reference case has been fully analysed (P = 8 MPa, I = 0. 35 A) in terms of physical properties. The results show a bending of the arc and displacement of the anodic arc root towards {{the top of the}} reactor, due to the combined effects of convection, gravity and electromagnetic forces. A parametric study on the pressure (2 - 10 MPa) and current (0. 25 - 0. 4 A) was then investigated.

40|$|Presentation for the Web Archives 2015 Conference at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor MILower {{technical}} {{barriers to entry}} have increasingly placed the development of digital archives within the reach of smaller organizations; but creating and appropriately maintaining digital archives takes time, money, and specialized knowledge. Canadian artist run centres (ARCs) rarely have an abundance {{of any of these}} resources, yet many have developed creative digital archival projects focused on their specific mandates, history, or communities. These non-profit organizations, run by and for artists, have made major contributions to Canada’s cultural identity over the past thirty years resulting in a rich history of exhibitions, publications, and community practice. Unfortunately, archiving this history is typically not a primary function of ARCs and necessarily takes a backseat to the task of developing new programming. Now that this community has accrued a significant historical record of work, both artistic and institutional, many ARCs {{are looking for ways to}} use the resources they have to create digital archives to capture, maintain, share, and in some cases make new work based on these records. This presentation discusses my recent research with ARC directors in Alberta and Saskatchewan exploring the archival goals and challenges unique to their organizations. These ARCs have found ingenious ways to use open source tools and online services to develop digital archive projects, often without guaranteed long term funding or additional trained staff.

40|$|In {{the shift}} to a globalised {{creative}} economy where innovation and creativity are increasingly prized, many studies have documented direct and indirect social and economic benefits of the arts. In addition, arts workers have been argued to possess capabilities which are of great benefit {{both within and outside}} the arts, including (in addition to creativity) problem solving abilities, emotional intelligence, and team <b>working</b> skills (<b>ARC</b> Centre of Excellence for Creative Industries and Innovation, 2007). However, the labour force characteristics of professional artists in Australia and elsewhere belie their importance. The average earnings of workers in the arts sector are consistently less than other workers with similar educational backgrounds, and their rates of unemployment and underemployment are much higher (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2005; Caves, 2000; Throsby & Hollister, 2003). Graduating students in the arts appear to experience similar employment challenges and exhibit similar patterns of work to artists in general. Many eventually obtain work unrelated to the arts or go back to university to complete further tertiary study in fields unrelated to arts (Graduate Careers Council of Australia, 2005 a). Recent developments in career development theory have involved discussion of the rise of boundaryless careers amongst knowledge workers. Boundaryless careers are characterised by non-linear career progression occurring outside the bounds of a single organisation or field (Arthur & Rousseau, 1996 a, 1996 b). The protean career is an extreme form of the boundaryless career, where the careerist also possesses strong internal career motivations and criteria for success (Baruch, 2004; Hall, 2004; Hall & Mirvis, 1996). It involves a psychological contract with one's self rather than an organisation or organisations. The boundaryless and protean career literature suggests competencies and dispositions for career self-management and career success, but to date there has been minimal empirical work investigating the predictive value of these competencies and dispositions to career success in the boundaryless or protean career. This program of research employed competencies and dispositions from boundaryless and protean career theory to predict career success in professional artists and tertiary arts graduates. These competencies and dispositions were placed into context using individual and contextual career development influences suggested by the Systems Theory Framework of career development (McMahon & Patton, 1995; Patton & McMahon, 1999, 2006 a). Four substantive studies were conducted, using online surveys with professional artists and tertiary arts students / graduates, which were preceded by a pilot study for measure development. A largely quantitative approach to the program of research was preferred, in the interests of generalisability of findings. However, at the time of data collection, there were no quantitative measures available which addressed the constructs of interest. Brief scales of Career Management Competence based on the Australian Blueprint for Career Development (Haines, Scott, & Lincoln, 2003), Protean Career Success Orientation based on the underlying dispositions for career success suggested by protean career theory, and Career Development Influences based on the Systems Theory Framework of career development (McMahon & Patton, 1995; Patton & McMahon, 1999, 2006 a) were constructed and validated via a process of pilot testing and exploratory factor analyses. This process was followed by confirmatory factor analyses with data collected from two samples: 310 professional artists, and 218 graduating arts students who participated at time 1 (i. e., at the point of undergraduate course completion in October, 2005). Confirmatory factor analyses via Structural Equation Modelling conducted in Study 1 revealed that the scales would benefit from some respecification, and so modifications were made to the measures to enhance their validity and reliability. The three scales modified and validated in Study 1 were then used in Studies 3 and 4 as potential predictors of career success for the two groups of artists under investigation, along with relevant sociodemographic variables. The aim of the Study 2 was to explore the construct of career success in the two groups of artists studied. Each participant responded to an open-ended question asking them to define career success. The responses for professional artists were content analysed using emergent coding with two coders. The codebook was later applied to the arts students' definitions. The majority of the themes could be grouped into four main categories: internal definitions; financial recognition definitions; contribution definitions; and non-financial recognition definitions. Only one third of the definition themes in the professional artists' and arts graduates' definitions of career success were categorised as relating to financial recognition. Responses within the financial recognition category also indicated that many of the artists aspired only to a regular subsistence level of arts income (although a small number of the arts graduates did aspire to fame and fortune). The second section of the study investigated the statistical relationships between the five different measures of career success for each career success definitional category and overall. The professional artists' and arts graduates' surveys contained several measures of career success, including total earnings over the previous 12 months, arts earnings over the previous 12 months, 1 - 6 self-rated total employability, 1 - 6 self-rated arts employability, and 1 - 6 self-rated self-defined career success. All of the measures were found to be statistically related to one another, but a very strong statistical relationship was identified between each employability measure and its corresponding earnings measure for both of the samples. Consequently, it was decided to include only the earnings measures (earnings from arts, and earnings overall) and the self-defined career success rating measure in the later studies. Study 3 used the career development constructs validated in Study 1, sociodemographic variables, and the career success measures explored in Study 2 via Classification and Regression Tree (CART - Breiman, Friedman, Olshen, & Stone, 1984) style decision trees with v-fold crossvalidation pruning using the 1 SE rule. CART decision trees are a nonparametric analysis technique which can be used as an alternative to OLS or hierarchical regression in the case of data which violates parametric statistical assumptions. The three optimal decision trees for total earnings, arts earnings and self defined career success ratings explained {{a large proportion of the}} variance in their respective target variables (R 2 between 0. 49 and 0. 68). The Career building subscale of the Career Management Competence scale, pertaining to the ability to manage the external aspects of a career, was the most consistent predictor of all three career success measures (and was the strongest predictor for two of the three trees), indicating the importance of the artists' abilities to secure work and build the external aspects of a career. Other important predictors included the Self management subscale of the Career Management Competence scale, Protean Career Success Orientation, length of time working in the arts, and the positive role of interpersonal influences, skills and abilities, and interests and beliefs from the Career Development Influences scale. Slightly different patterns of predictors were found for the three different career success measures. Study 4 also involved the career development constructs validated in Study 1, sociodemographic variables, and the career success measures explored in Study 2 via CART style decision trees. This study used a prospective repeated measures design where the data for the attribute variables were gathered at the point of undergraduate course completion, and the target variables were measured one year later. Data from a total of 122 arts students were used, as 122 of the 218 students who responded to the survey at time 1 (October 2005) also responded at time 2 (October 2006). The resulting optimal decision trees had R 2 values of between 0. 33 and 0. 46. The values were lower than those for the professional artists' decision trees, and the trees themselves were smaller, but the R 2 values nonetheless indicated that the arts students' trees possessed satisfactory explanatory power. The arts graduates' Career building scores at time 1 were strongly predictive of all three career success measures at time 2, a similar finding to the professional artists' trees. A further similarity between the trees for the two samples was the strong statistical relationship between Career building, Self management, and Protean Career Success Orientation. However, the most important variable in the total earnings tree was arts discipline category. Technical / design arts graduates consistently earned more overall than arts graduates from other disciplines. Other key predictors in the arts graduates' trees were work experience in arts prior to course completion, positive interpersonal influences, and the positive influence of skills and abilities and interests and beliefs on career development. The research program findings represent significant contributions to existing knowledge about artists' career development and success, and also the transition from higher education to the world of work, with specific reference to arts and creative industries programs. It also has implications for theory relating to career success and protean / boundaryless careers...|$|R
