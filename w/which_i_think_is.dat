[...] He complimented {{storyboard}} artists Muto and Sugar, saying that the former [...] "has a hilarious slapstick set-up-the-punchline kind of style of comedy" [...] and the latter [...] "is amazing at executing these super romantic, emotional goosebump-kind of feelings". He was particularly pleased with the ending, noting that [...] "I love that goose-bumps feeling in a climactic scene with music rising. In that episode you're talking about, there is that rising action toward the end, and then LSP [...] cuts in and says 'drama bomb!' {{in the middle of it}} to sort of, like, cut its legs out. <b>Which</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> a lot of fun."

500|$|A new costume was {{required}} for Ryan once Seven had the majority of her Borg implants removed. She wore a new silver jumpsuit for the following several episodes. During the filming of the episode [...] "Day of Honor", [...] director Jesús Salvador Treviño criticized the outfit, saying that [...] "almost any camera angle inevitably winds up emphasizing her sexuality." [...] Ryan described the new costume as [...] "a little snug"; she wore a corset-like device which gave her the appearance of mechanical ribs. Treviño praised Ryan's third costume, which replaced the silver jumpsuit, noting how it reduced her sexual characteristics: [...] "It is much more sensible, because she's still an attractive person but then you {{get away from that}} titillation stuff <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> so demeaning not only to the audience, but it's kinda of demeaning to what Star Trek is about".|$|E
500|$|After the filming, Burton {{said of the}} cast, [...] "All I can say is {{this is one of}} {{the best}} casts I've ever worked with. These people are not {{professional}} singers, so to do a musical like this <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> one of the most difficult musicals, they all went for it. Every day on the set was a very, very special thing for me. Hearing all these guys sing, I don't know if I can ever have an experience like that again."" [...] Burton said of the singing, [...] "You can't just lip synch, you'd see the throat and the breath, every take they all had to belt it out. It was very enjoyable for me to see, with music on the set everybody just moved differently. I'd seen Johnny (Depp) act in a way I'd never seen before, walking across the room or sitting in the chair, picking up a razor or making a pie, whatever. They all did it in a way that you could sense." ...|$|E
500|$|Due to {{the complex}} {{technology}} used to for the video, Robyn believed [...] "It looked like 'MacGyver' on the set." [...] She said that the video [...] " [...] very much about [...] giving almost a physical experience of {{what it feels like}} to be on a dance floor or fall in love, whether it's blood or endorphins or other body fluids." [...] She wanted to make a video about sex, but said that [...] "in a way that wasn't so clichéd. [...] And [...] is made to give you a picture of what sex really is, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> something that's very hard to do, because sex is everywhere all the time, but very rarely is it made out to be something real." [...] The video begins with a reversed scene of a young couple having sex. In cutscenes, Robyn appears with a tube dress with clear liquid flowing through it. When the young woman begins to switch her sex partners, the liquid in the tubes wrapped around Robyn begins to alter colors and flow more quickly. The video ends with Robyn standing alone with black liquid in the tubes.|$|E

500|$|The band's {{music is}} {{characterized}} by a metal sound, and the screamed vocals of frontman Josh Scogin. Journalists have frequently referred to the music as [...] "chaotic"; Allmusic writer Alex Henderson described it as a [...] "dense, clobbering sledgehammer", while Brian Shultz of Alternative Press called it [...] "manically pounding, distortion-soaked exercises of catharsis". The Chariot has often been labeled a metalcore band. However, the music generally defies genre standards like melodic/abrasive dynamics and harmonizing vocals; it wouldn't leave room for the [...] "nonstop firestorm of exploding drums, heaving guitars, and visceral shrieking," [...] as Allmusic writer Corey Apar put it. The band utilizes time changes and start-stop shifts, and typically write very short songs. Some journalists believe the music is challenging and an acquired taste. In interviews, Josh Scogin has described the band as “heavy punk rock”, doing away with genres and subgenres, and has also debunked many of these labels. “Sometimes people refer to us as mathcore, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> a very incorrect statement, because I feel like that’s a very pre-calculated, ‘this is weird because this time signature doesn’t go with this time…’. It’s very planned out. We’re not that smart.” ...|$|E
500|$|After {{being hired}} by Jive Records {{to create a}} remix for [...] "Oveprotected", Rodney Jerkins {{revealed}} that the label [...] "needed a remix that's crazy."

I was up all night rocking that joint. [...] same lyrics, I just reproduced the track." [...] "The Darkchild Remix" [...] was initially being sent to radio stations in the United States in mid-March 2002 and then became the opening track of the compilation album Now That's What I Call Music! 10 later that year; however, it was only released on April 1, 2002. The remix was heavily played in dance clubs, and Jerkins said he wasn't surprised with the popularity of it, since [...] " [...] reinvented herself. Everybody thought she was gonna come back with another 'Oops!... I Did It Again', but she went left and came with the 'I'm a Slave 4 U' joint, which is basically a club banger. You gotta big up people who reinvent themselves. I always said she was gonna {{be one of the}} people that's gonna be around for a minute, because I see that in her." [...] Finnish musician and record producer Jaakko Salovaara also created two remixes for the track, titled [...] "JS16 Dub" [...] and [...] "JS16 Remix". The latter was included on the promotional soundtrack of Spears' debut movie, Crossroads (2002).|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} album cover, {{designed by}} art collective Hipgnosis, shows a Holstein-Friesian cow {{standing in a}} pasture with no text nor any other {{clue as to what}} might be on the record. Some later editions have the title and artist name added to the cover. This concept was the group's reaction to the psychedelic space rock imagery associated with Pink Floyd {{at the time of the}} album's release; the band wanted to explore all sorts of music without being limited to a particular image or style of performance. They thus requested that their new album had [...] "something plain" [...] on the cover, which ended up being the image of a cow. Storm Thorgerson, inspired by Andy Warhol's famous [...] "cow wallpaper", has said that he simply drove out into a rural area near Potters Bar and photographed the first cow he saw. The cow's owner identified her name as [...] "Lulubelle III". More cows appear on the back cover, again with no text or titles, and on the inside gatefold. Also, a pink balloon shaped like a cow udder accompanied the album as part of Capitol's marketing strategy campaign to [...] "break" [...] the band in the US. The liner notes in later CD editions give a recipe for Traditional Bedouin Wedding Feast on a card labelled [...] "Breakfast Tips". Looking back on the artwork, Thorgerson remembered: [...] "I think the cow represents, in terms of the Pink Floyd, part of their humour, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> often underestimated or just unwritten about." ...|$|E

500|$|A + No Poder is {{dedicated}} to Guzmán's daughter Frida Sofia. The album includes twelve tracks: eleven written by Guzmán and Pagán, with additional writers for three of them. [...] "Adiós" [...] was co-written by Carlos Efrén Reyes, [...] "Esta Noche" [...] was co-written by Karenka and Reyli Barba, and [...] "A Más No Poder" [...] was co-written Sarah Lenore. Another track, [...] "Una Canción de Amor", was entirely written by Argentinean singer-songwriter Alejandro Lerner. [...] "Adiós" [...] features Puerto-Rican reggaeton performer Farruko. [...] "Te Esperaré" [...] is a ballad, and [...] "Malvada", {{a story about a}} femme fatale, has country music undertones with a harmonica that resembles Mexican band El Tri. [...] "Malvada" [...] and [...] "This is Too Much Rock and Roll" [...] are rock songs, with the latter reminds of Soy, an album released by the singer in 2001. [...] "Esta Noche" [...] is a pop/funk track with reggae influences. [...] "A Más No Poder" [...] has sexual connotations in its lyrics and as stated by Ángel Rodríguez of ADN Informativo, [...] "brings back memories when Guzmán was produced by Miguel Blasco in the 90's". [...] "Mi Debilidad" [...] is a pop/rock song, while [...] "No Puedo Parar" [...] is a heavy metal track. [...] "Qué Ironía" [...] is a rock ballad that recalls Guzmán greatest hits such as [...] "Mi Peor Error". About the songs included, Guzmán stated to Tabasco Hoy: [...] "In recent years I experienced many good and bad things, so I thought, why not transform them into songs. And so it began to take shape this new album, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> more intelligent, mature and planned than my previous work".|$|E
500|$|After {{being formed}} and {{finishing}} {{third in the}} seventh series of The X Factor in 2010, One Direction were signed by Simon Cowell to a £2 million Syco Records record contract. Recording for their debut album began in January 2011, as they flew to Los Angeles to work with Moroccan-Swedish producer RedOne. In February 2011, One Direction and nine other contestants from the series participated in the X Factor Live Tour. After the tour concluded in April 2011, the group continued working on their debut album. Recording took place in Sweden, the United States, and the United Kingdom, as One Direction worked with producers Carl Falk, Savan Kotecha, Steve Mac, RedOne, Toby Gad and Rami Yacoub, among others. The album also features songs written by Ed Sheeran, Kelly Clarkson, and Tom Fletcher. In May 2011, Kotecha spoke to Digital Spy, and he elaborated that One Direction were [...] "experimenting" [...] with sounds on their debut album. Kotecha {{said that he was}} involved in the [...] "early stages" [...] of producing the record. [...] "The stuff I've heard has been really catchy and everyone loves the guys, so it's just about capturing that in the music, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> what they're going to be doing." [...] Sonny Takhar, {{the chief executive officer of}} Syco Records, in an August 2011 issue of Music Week, described the recording process as a [...] "very intensive period" [...] for the group. Takhar added the resulting album was one of the best pop records made by Syco Records in the past few years, and that he was confident it would be successful. In November 2011, they signed a record deal with Columbia Records in North America. Steve Barnett, the co-chairman of Columbia Records, said it was not a difficult decision to sign with One Direction. [...] "Other artists in that category had gotten a little older," [...] he said. [...] "I just thought there was a void, and maybe they could seize and hold it." ...|$|E
500|$|The filmmakers behind Twilight {{worked to}} create a film that was as {{faithful}} to the novel as they thought possible when converting the story to another medium, with producer Greg Mooradian saying, [...] "It's very important to distinguish that we're making a separate piece of art that obviously is going to remain very, very faithful to the book.... But at the same time, we have a separate responsibility {{to make the best}} movie you can make." [...] To ensure a faithful adaptation, Meyer was kept very involved in the production process, having been invited to visit the set during filming and even asked to give notes on the script and on a rough cut of the film. Of this process, she said, [...] "It was a really pleasant exchange [...] from the beginning, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> not very typical. They were really interested in my ideas", and, [...] "...they kept me in the loop and with the script, they let me see it and said, 'What are your thoughts?'... They let me have input on it and I think they took 90 percent of what I said and just incorporated it right in to the script." [...] Meyer fought for one line in particular, one of the most well-known from the book about [...] "the lion and the lamb", to be kept verbatim in the film: [...] "I actually think the way Melissa [...] wrote it sounded better for the movie [...] {{but the problem is that}} line is actually tattooed on peoples' bodies [...] But I said, 'You know, if you take that one and change it, that's a potential backlash situation. Meyer was even invited {{to create a}} written list of things that could not be changed for the film, such as giving the vampires fangs or killing characters who do not die in the book, that the studio agreed to follow. The consensus among critics is that the filmmakers succeeded in making a film that is very faithful to its source material, with one reviewer stating that, with a few exceptions, [...] "Twilight the movie is unerringly faithful to the source without being hamstrung by it." ...|$|E
