Based on {{the test}} {{requirement}} of auto electric <b>window</b> <b>lifter,</b> using the control method of the machine-electron-liquid, the test equipment was researched and designed, using the method of the swing load to realize the load, the method effectively reduce the impact to the auto electric <b>window</b> <b>lifter,</b> and has the characteristics of automatic loading and automatic unloading. The technology was used in actual test, and the test precision satisfies the design requirements...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. <b>Window</b> <b>lifter</b> motor {{is one of}} the {{potential}} electromagnetic interference （EMI ） sources in automobile. Based on the research on the principle of <b>Window</b> <b>lifter</b> motor and the generation mechanism of EMI, its EMI characteristics are tested and analyzed. The EMI suppression methods are proposed. By comparing two filters methods，it shows that the designed filter suppresses the electromagnetic interference more effectively. Its conducted emission and radiated emission are lower than the second lever limits of CISPR 25 - 2007 +...|$|E

50|$|Then, in January 2012, Mabuchi inaugurated its China Business Unit (CBU), {{in which}} three factors, namely production, sales and technology, are {{combined}} with each other, and started product development, mass-production and sales to meet local needs. In {{line with the}} second phase of production base reorganization, the company launched a new base to strengthen the existing bases. In November, Mabuchi Motor (Jiangxi) Co., Ltd. started its operations. In November, the second factory of Mabuchi Motor (Yingtan) Co., Ltd. was completed. In December, a new factory specialized for a motor for power <b>window</b> <b>lifters</b> and power seats was completed in Jiangsu.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} {{a technique to}} determine user preferences concerning in-car micro-gesture interaction. The approach {{is derived from the}} theater technique [1], and implies a collaborative adjustment of parameters with the experimenter, until the subject has decided about the final settings. We evaluated three systematically selected gestures (zooming, sweeping, and circling) for controlling four exemplary comfort functions of the car (<b>window</b> <b>lifter,</b> air condition, radio volume, and seat heating). The main result of our study is the geometry of a “sweet spot ” for micro-gesture recognition close to the steering wheel, which is independent from the underlying technical recognition approach. Additionally, preferred sizes, angles, and pause times for the investigated gestures are provided. We give an indication, which of the gestures is preferred by the users (the sweeping gesture). Finally, we provide a more detailed view on the interaction between gesture preferences and function...|$|E
40|$|Today's {{industrial}} enterprises {{face the}} challenges of a hard competition on global markets regarding high customer requirements after economical and qualitatively high-quality products. The realization of new and improved product functions requires frequently the employment of new technologies. So that the arising chances and risks can be judged e. g. regarding functionality, reliability and producibleness reliably, and only the technologies in products to be converted, which bring advantages for the customer and/or the enterprise with itself and exhibit a sufficient maturity, an evaluation of possible technology alternatives is absolutely necessary in the apron of a product realization. Before this background {{in the context of}} the available work a new method was developed, which makes a systematic, model-based decision support for the technology selection in the framework for an result-oriented product development possible. Over a House OF Technology (HOT) the relations between functions of the goal product and technology elements of a technology group is illustrated and weighted accordingly. Among themselves is likewise considered to the mutual influences of individual technology elements. In this way different, alternative technology groups with partial different technology elements can be assigned to a product working model. The technology elements are evaluated flexibility regarding the goal sizes costs, quality, and technological maturity degree, which were deposited for the application field of electrical connection/electronic systems in motor vehicles with single criteria and clustered in criterion trees. Due to the uncertainty, which is still present in this early development phase for the development of the technology characteristics regarding the single criteria, for it probability distributions are used. By transformation functions the distributions are standardized, so that both quantitative and qualitative description characteristics can be selected. The aggregation of the evaluation numbers to the final goal sizes on level of the technology elements as well as afterwards with consideration of the connections in the House OF Technology on level of the respective technology group takes place via a Monte Carlo simulation. The computation results are prepared for the representation of the goal size reaching in diagrams for alternative technology groups. Thus a systematic, model-based technology evaluation is available for decision making in an result-oriented product development, into which new realizations can be in-maintained at any time. Finally validating the available method was accomplished on the basis the case example of a <b>window</b> <b>lifter</b> successfully in the automotive manufacture. The described beginning can in principle be transferred to other industries, products and technologies...|$|E
