5|$|After {{becoming}} a tropical cyclone, Eline was still encountering wind shear and dry air. Despite these factors, the eye became better defined and the storm intensified, aided by favoring upper-level conditions. The cyclone turned {{more to the}} west toward Madagascar, despite a <b>weakness</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ridge to the south. While approaching the country, Eline quickly intensified, reaching 10‑minute winds of 165km/h (105mph) by 18:00UTC on February17. Around that time, the cyclone made landfall on eastern Madagascar near Mahanoro. Eline rapidly weakened over land while moving to the west-southwest, and the JTWC downgraded the storm to tropical depression status within 18hours of moving ashore.|$|E
5|$|After {{becoming}} a tropical storm, Edouard quickly strengthened {{due to the}} establishment of an upper-level anticyclone over the storm. The storm moved to the west in response to a strong subtropical ridge to its north, and Edouard strengthened into a hurricane on August 23. Due to very favorable conditions, the hurricane rapidly strengthened on August 24 and August 25 to peak as a 145mph (230km/h) Category4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Scale. A <b>weakness</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> subtropical ridge allowed for a motion more to the west-northwest, and the hurricane passed about 250mi (400km) north of the Lesser Antilles on August 28. For three days during this time, Edouard maintained Category4 intensity, though weakened late on August 28 due to an eyewall replacement cycle and vertical shear.|$|E
5|$|After {{entering}} the open {{waters of the}} South China Sea, Nepartak continued to intensify and turned more toward the northwest. It attained its peak intensity on November 16, with maximum 10‑minute sustained winds of 120km/h (75mph) and 1-minute winds of 140km/h (85mph). After weakening slightly, the storm found a <b>weakness</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> easterly steering currents and bore north, reintensifying slightly and directly striking southwestern Hainan. There, heavy rainfall and strong winds destroyed crops, livestock, and hundreds of homes, leaving $197 million (2003 USD) in damage. The storm rapidly deteriorated in the Gulf of Tonkin and dissipated as it neared mainland China.|$|E

40|$|Material <b>weaknesses</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{internal}} control system {{of a company}} create more opportunities for managers to engage in opportunistic earnings management. <b>In</b> this study <b>the</b> authors investigate the relation between earnings management and disclosed material <b>weaknesses</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{internal control}}s, both under SOX 302 and SOX 404, and examine whether audit quality, measured as being audited by a Big Four auditor, {{has an effect on}} that relation. The results suggest that material weakness firms have more absolute discretionary accruals and greater income-decreasing discretionary accruals. So evidence is provided that material <b>weakness</b> firms engage <b>in</b> more earnings management, however not in opportunistic income-increasing earnings management. When audit quality is high, measured as being audited by a Big Four auditor, the disclosed material weaknesses are lower just as total and absolute discretionary accruals are. It is also interesting in our findings that when material weakness firms are audited by a Big Four auditor a positive relationship seems to exist with discretionary accruals, suggesting that when a firm is audited by a Big Four auditor, material <b>weaknesses</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> internal controls will lead to opportunistic earnings management...|$|R

5|$|Early on August3, Colin's {{forward motion}} increased, and the cyclone {{was unable to}} {{maintain}} a closed circulation. The tropical storm degenerated into a trough at 1800UTC, although tropical storm-force winds persisted. As the remnants passed north of the northern Leeward Islands, a reconnaissance aircraft investigated the system on August4, but no closed circulation was found. As the remnants approached a <b>weakness</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> subtropical ridge across the western Atlantic on August5, its forward speed gradually slowed as well. A combination of microwave and satellite imagery during the morning hours of August5 revealed the reformation of a closed low, and Colin's remnants regained tropical storm status at this time while located 280mi (450km) north-northeast of San Juan, Puerto Rico.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Gert was {{the fourth}} of five major hurricanes in the {{moderately}} active 1999 Atlantic hurricane season. A Cape Verde-type hurricane, Gert formed on September11 {{off the coast of}} Africa before heading west-northwest. It reached a peak wind speed of 150mph (240km/h) by September15 over the open central Atlantic east-northeast of the Leeward Islands. It gradually curved to the northwest and later to the north, due to a <b>weakness</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> subtropical ridge created by Hurricane Floyd. Hurricane Gert passed east of Bermuda on September21 and began a steady weakening trend at that time. It turned to the northeast, and on September23, Gert transitioned into an extratropical cyclone to the southeast of Atlantic Canada before being absorbed by a larger storm.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Kate was the second-longest lived {{tropical}} cyclone in the 2003 Atlantic hurricane season. The eleventh tropical storm, fifth hurricane, and third major hurricane of the season, Kate developed from a tropical wave {{in the central}} tropical Atlantic on September 25. Its unusual track included four major changes in direction. The storm moved northwestward until a <b>weakness</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> subtropical ridge forced it eastward. Kate strengthened to a hurricane, turned sharply westward while moving around a mid-level low, and intensified to a 125mph (205km/h) major hurricane on October 4. Kate turned sharply northward around the periphery of an anticyclone, weakened, and became extratropical after passing {{to the east of}} Newfoundland. The extratropical storm persisted for three days until losing its identity near Scandinavia.|$|E
