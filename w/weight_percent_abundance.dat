40|$|The mineral {{ilmenite}} (FeTiO 3) {{was found}} in abundance in lunar mare soils returned during the Apollo project. Lunar ilmenite often contains greater than 50 weight-percent titanium dioxide (TiO 2), and is a primary potential resource for oxygen and other raw materials to supply future lunar bases. Chemical and spectroscopic analysis of the returned lunar soils produced an empirical function that relates the spectral reflectance ratio at 400 and 560 nm to the <b>weight</b> <b>percent</b> <b>abundance</b> of TiO 2. This allowed mapping of the lunar TiO 2 distribution using telescopic vidicon multispectral imaging from the ground; however, the time variant photometric response of the vidicon detectors produced abundance uncertainties of at least 2 to 5 percent. Since that time, solid-state charge-coupled device (CCD) detector technology capable of much improved photometric response has become available. An investigation of the lunar TiO 2 distribution was carried out utilizing groundbased telescopic CCD multispectral imagery and spectroscopy. The work was approached in phases to develop optimum technique based upon initial results. The goal is to achieve the best possible TiO 2 abundance maps from the ground as a precursor to lunar orbiter and robotic sample return missions, and to produce {{a better idea of}} the peak abundances of TiO 2 for benefaction studies.

40|$|Geochemical well logs {{were used}} to measure the dry <b>weight</b> <b>percent</b> oxide <b>abundances</b> of Si, Al, Ca, Mg, Fe, Ti, and K and the {{elemental}} abundances of Gd, S, Th, and U at 0. 15 -m intervals throughout the basement section of Hole 504 B. These geochemical data are used to estimate the integrated chemical exchange resulting from hydrothermal alteration of the oceanic crust that has occurred over the last 5. 9 Ma. A large increase in Si in the transition zone between pillows and dikes (Layers 2 B and 2 C) indicates that mixing of hot, upwelling hydrothermal fluids with cold, downwelling seawater occurred in the past at a permeability discontinuity at this level in the crust, even though the low-to-high permeability boundary in Hole 504 B is now 500 m shallower (at the Layer 2 A/ 2 B boundary). The observations of extensive Ca loss and Mg gain agree with chemical exchanges recorded in the laboratory in experiments on the reactions that occur between basalt and seawater at high temperatures. The K budget requires significant addition to Layer 2 A from both high-temperature depletion in Layers 2 B and 2 C and low-temperature alteration by seawater. Integrated water/rock ratios are derived for the mass of seawater required to add enriched elements and for the mass of hydrothermal fluid required to remove depleted elements in the crust at Hole 504 B...|$|R

40|$|Processing {{magnetic}} materials to tailor microstructures with specific crystallographic textures {{can be accomplished}} using the magnetic field liquid phase sintering method (MFLPS), which is currently being developed at Boise State University. This process allows us to align the individual grains and modify the magnetic, mechanical, and other properties of the material. The MFLPS method is achieved by applying a magnetic field to a pressed pellet of two materials, one with a high melting point and one with a low melting point, during a two-step heat treatment. During the first heating step below the Curie temperature, the applied magnetic field creates a torque on the high-melting ferromagnetic component that aligns the grains of the magnetic phase while the second component is in its liquid phase. The sintering then occurs during the second heating step at higher temperature without magnetic field.
