Self-denial {{is one of}} the {{distinguishing}} characters {{by which}} true Christians are manifested from the feigned ones: for those that are feigned, flatter God with their mouths, but their hearts seek themselves; but the sincere, for the love that he hath to Christ, forsaketh all that he hath for his sake (Psa 78:36,37; Eze 33:31,32).[23] ...|$|R

Zenobia, by the bye, as I suppose you know, is merely her public name; a sort of mask in which she comes before the world, retaining all the privileges of privacy,--a contrivance, in short, like the white drapery of the Veiled Lady, only a little more transparent.

Oh, it's just a little place, nothing pretentious: the links are not much good for golf; in fact we don't play much golf there, so far as golf goes, and of course, we don't serve meals at the club, it's not like that--and no, we've nothing to drink there because of prohibition.

50|$|The White Manual {{is a white}} {{supremacist}} handbook similar to The Anarchist Cookbook. It promotes the founding of small independent {{white supremacist}} cells, and is an instructional manual on illegal activities such as weapon-making and terrorism, in addition to violent guerrilla warfare against the Government. The book was popular on neo-Nazi websites until it attracted media and law enforcement attention, causing many sites to take it down. Anarchist activist Sherman Austin said of the book:There’s something on the Internet called the White Resistance Manual. It’s pretty much for white supremacists…to carry out a large-scale guerilla campaign through means of assassination, threats, obtaining funds through fraud, everything from firearms to explosives. I’ve seen, not surprisingly, no action taken against those people, but here I am, an anarchist website, {{not even close to}} what that is, not even close to <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> find on the Internet.|$|R

I don’t want to say I get bored, and I don’t want to say I’m a dilettante, because I taught school for 10 years and then I worked in fashion for 10 years, but I pick things that appeal to me in some way.

40|$|Supervised machine {{learning}} models boast remarkable predictive capabilities. But <b>can</b> <b>you</b> trust your model? Will it work in deployment? <b>What</b> <b>else</b> <b>can</b> it tell <b>you</b> about the world? We want models {{to be not}} only good, but interpretable. And yet the task of interpretation appears underspecified. Papers provide diverse and sometimes non-overlapping motivations for interpretability, and offer myriad notions of what attributes render models interpretable. Despite this ambiguity, many papers proclaim interpretability axiomatically, absent further explanation. In this paper, we seek to refine the discourse on interpretability. First, we examine the motivations underlying interest in interpretability, finding them to be diverse and occasionally discordant. Then, we address model properties and techniques thought to confer interpretability, identifying transparency to humans and post-hoc explanations as competing notions. Throughout, we discuss the feasibility and desirability of different notions, and question the oft-made assertions that linear models are interpretable and that deep neural networks are not.

You are not accustomed to it--and you never will be!' In answer he began an indignant speech with: 'Madam!' but he got no further, for now that the subject was broached, Mrs. Markam intended to have her say out. It was not a pleasant say, and, truth to tell, it was not said in a pleasant manner. A wife's manner seldom is pleasant when she undertakes to tell what she considers 'truths' to her husband. The result was that Arthur Fernlee Markam undertook, then and there, that during his stay in Scotland he would wear no other costume than the one she abused. Woman-like his wife had the last word--given in this case with tears: ...|$|E

I think none the worse, I think the more of you, for this engaging frankness. And in the meanwhile, what are you to do? You find yourself, if I interpret rightly, in very much the same situation as Charles the Second (possibly the least degraded of your British sovereigns) when he was taken into the confidence of the thief. To denounce me, is out of the question; and <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>can</b> <b>you</b> attempt?

6000|$|... § XVII. All European {{architecture}}, bad and good, old and new, {{is derived}} from Greece through Rome, and colored and perfected from the East. The history of architecture is nothing but the tracing of the various modes and directions of this derivation. Understand this, once for all: if you hold fast this great connecting clue, you may string all the types of successive architectural invention upon it like so many beads. The Doric and the Corinthian orders are the roots, the one of all Romanesque, massy-capitaled buildings--Norman, Lombard, Byzantine, and <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> name of the kind; and the Corinthian of all Gothic, Early English, French, German, and Tuscan. Now observe: those old Greeks gave the shaft; Rome gave the arch; the Arabs pointed and foliated the arch. The shaft and arch, the frame-work and strength of architecture, are from the race of Japheth: the spirituality and sanctity of it from Ismael, Abraham, and Shem.|$|R
5000|$|If we {{took away}} women's right to vote, we'd {{never have to}} worry about another Democrat president. It's kind of a pipe dream, it's a {{personal}} fantasy of mine, but I don't think it's going to happen. And it is a good way of making the point that women are voting so stupidly, at least single women.It also makes the point, it is kind of embarrassing, the Democratic Party ought to be hanging its head in shame, that it has so much difficulty getting men to vote for it. I mean, you do see it's the party of women and 'We'll pay for health care and tuition and day care—and here, <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>can</b> we give <b>you,</b> soccer moms?' In addition to questioning whether women's right to vote is a good thing, Coulter has also appeared on Fox News and advocated for a poll tax and a literacy test for voters (this was in 1999, and she reiterated her support of a literacy test in 2015). This is not a viewpoint widely shared by members of the Republican Party.|$|R

(…) Eventually we are {{prepared}} to do anything, in a broad sense, anything. (…) Mohammad B. said it right: ‘the 2 nd of November Allah sent his soldier’. - Nidal It is good, finally they feel it. (…) It is true that they are suppressing more Muslims now, but they know now that we offer resistance and that scares them. They can’t distinguish the terrorists from non-terrorists. (…) There is a hadith that says that if {{the end of the world}} is coming near, a war will take place between believers and unbelievers. The believers will win. - Yelda It is these kinds of statements and violent actions that have aroused fear of Islamic fundamentalism in the Netherlands since 9 / 11. Nidal’s and Yelda’s words express a conviction of the ultimate truth and a dualist vision of the world. From this conviction they derive a sense of superiority and that violence is legitimate against their enemies. Viewpoints like theirs have, moreover, promoted the clash of civilization thesis that presents (fundamentalist) Muslims as diametrically opposed to Dutch non-Muslims. But how ‘other’ are fundamentalist Muslims in the Netherlands? What are their beliefs and practices? How do their beliefs and practices develop over time? And what attracts Dutch Muslims to fundamentalism? These questions form the principal focus of this book. The introduction will, on the one hand, clarify the context in which these questions have emerged and, on the other hand, elaborate on the approach to find answers to them. First it will consider how Dutch society has come to see the threat of Islamic fundamentalism. Thereafter it reflects on the limitations of explanations that emphasize the ‘otherness’ of Dutch fundamentalist Muslims. The introduction continues to discuss the exact focus, the research questions, and the added value of this criminological study. Finally, it presents an overview of the structure of this book...|$|R
