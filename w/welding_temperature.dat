50|$|The oldest flux {{used for}} forge welding was fine silica sand. The iron or steel would be heated in a {{reducing}} environment within the coals of the forge.

40|$|This study {{develops}} {{and presents}} a friction stir weld (FSW) quality assurance tool based on control of <b>weld</b> zone <b>temperature.</b> Apart from correct tool geometry, tool tilt angle, traverse speed and forge force during welding, one important requirement {{is that the}} weld material be sufficiently plasticised (softened). The level of plasticisation is related to <b>weld</b> zone <b>temperature</b> which is primarily dependent on spindle speed, traverse speed and forge force. When all other conditions are correct, sufficiently plasticised material flows around and consolidates behind the tool without the production of voids in the <b>weld.</b> Typically, <b>weld</b> <b>temperature</b> varies along the weld length which may result in variations in weld quality. <b>Weld</b> zone <b>temperature</b> control makes constant <b>weld</b> zone <b>temperature</b> possible. In this study, thermocouple sensors were embedded in the FSW tool and a <b>weld</b> zone <b>temperature</b> control algorithm was developed.

50|$|Consequently, for the {{evaluation}} of weldability, viscosity of molten thermoplastics (polymer melts) have {{to be taken into account}} since welding is a rapid process. It can be said that the lower the viscosity during welding process (at <b>welding</b> <b>temperature</b> and pressure), the better the weldability.|$|E
50|$|A primary {{requirement}} for forge welding {{is that both}} weld surfaces need to be heated to the same temperature and welded before they cool too much. When steel reaches the proper temperature, it begins to weld very readily, so a thin rod or nail heated to the same temperature will tend to stick at first contact, requiring it to be bent or twisted loose. One of the simplest ways to tell if iron or steel is hot enough is to stick a magnet to it. When iron or steel cross the A2 critical temperature, it begins to change into the allotrope called gamma iron. When this happens, the steel or iron becomes non-magnetic. In steel, the carbon begins to mix with gamma iron at the A3 temperature, forming a solid solution called austenite. When it crosses the A4 critical temperature, it changes into delta iron, which is magnetic. Therefore, a blacksmith can tell when the <b>welding</b> <b>temperature</b> is reached by placing a magnet {{in contact with the}} metal. When red or orange-hot, a magnet will not stick to the metal, but when the <b>welding</b> <b>temperature</b> is crossed, the magnet will again stick to it. The steel may take on a glossy or wet appearance at the <b>welding</b> <b>temperature.</b> Care must be taken to avoid overheating the metal {{to the point that it}} gives off sparks from rapid oxidation (burning), or else the weld will be poor and brittle.|$|E
50|$|For instance, two {{processes}} {{were used}} in constructing iron armor. In the first, hammering, large lumps of iron of scrap or puddled iron were heated to <b>welding</b> <b>temperature</b> and placed under heavy steel hammers. Repeated blows welded these lumps into one solid plate and shaped it to the required form and dimensions. Hammered iron plate was the armor used in the earliest ironclad vessels, including HMS Warrior. The second method, rolling, involved stacking iron lumps atop one another, heating them to <b>welding</b> <b>temperature</b> and passing them between two iron rollers to become one plate of the required size. Rolled iron was difficult to produce initially, as it required machinery of immense size and great power. However, when the Special Committee tested both types of plate in 1863, it found that rolled iron was superior to hammered due to greater uniformity in quality. The committee and iron manufacturers worked together on how to more easily produce rolled plate, which became standard use in warships beginning in 1865.|$|E

50|$|According to Vagn Fabritius Buchwald, wustite was an {{important}} component during the Iron age to facilitate the process of forge welding. In ancient times, when blacksmithing was performed using a charcoal forge, the deep charcoal pit in which the steel or iron was placed provided a highly-reducing, virtually oxygen-free environment, producing a thin wustite layer on the metal. At the <b>welding</b> <b>temperature,</b> the iron becomes highly reactive with oxygen, and will spark and form thick layers of slag when exposed to the air, which makes welding the iron or steel nearly impossible. To solve this problem, ancient blacksmiths would toss small amounts of sand onto the white-hot metal. The silicon in the sand then reacts with the wustite to form fayalite, which melts just below the <b>welding</b> <b>temperature.</b> This produced an effective flux that shielded the metal from oxygen and helped extract oxides and impurities, leaving a pure surface that can weld readily. Although the ancients {{had no knowledge of}} how this worked, the ability to weld iron contributed to the movement out of the Bronze age and into the modern.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a method of}} welding two thin sheets of poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) with a heated pin, thus allowing construction of {{a relationship between the}} <b>weld</b> <b>temperature</b> and <b>weld</b> strength. Constructing a relationship between <b>weld</b> strength and <b>temperature</b> is necessary for modeling many welding processes, including laser transmission welding. An experimental approach to establishing this relationship is required because of the complex melting behavior of PVC. The designed experimental device uses a single heated pin to weld samples by using varying pressure and temper-ature for one second dwell time. An electro-mechani-cal loadframe pulled the welded samples until joint fail-ure occurred, thereby allowing determination of the weld strength. An experiment varying welding pin tem-perature and joining pressure found the temperature to be a highly significant determiner of weld strength, while the pressure was found to be not significant.

5000|$|Before the {{technique}} of injecting air into molten iron was re-discovered by Kelly and by Bessemer, iron was available as cast iron, a strong but brittle metal made in a blast furnace by treating iron ore with coke derived from coal, and wrought iron, a more malleable and flexible metal made by heating iron ore in a low oxygen environment in a bloomery heated by charcoal and producing [...] "blooms", which were 100 to 200 pound lumps of very low carbon iron mixed with slag. The blooms then had to be worked repeatedly by hammering with a helve hammer or later a steam hammer and folding it {{to work out the}} slag. This could in turn be converted to steel by heating it for prolonged periods sealed in stone boxes with charcoal, to add back carbon.

5000|$|The {{history of}} joining metals {{goes back to}} the Bronze age, where bronzes of {{different}} hardness were often joined by casting-in. This method consisted of placing a solid part into a molten metal contained in a mold and allowing it to solidify without actually melting both metals, such as the blade of a sword into a handle or the tang of an arrowhead into the tip. Brazing and soldering were also common during the Bronze age. The act of welding (joining two solid parts through diffusion) began with iron. The first welding process was forge welding, which started when humans learned to smelt iron from iron ore; most likely in Anatolia (Turkey) around 1800 BC. Ancient people could not create temperatures high enough to melt iron fully, so the bloomery process that was used for smelting iron produced a lump (bloom) of iron grains sintered together with small amounts of slag and other impurities, referred to as sponge iron because of its porosity. After smelting the sponge iron needed to be heated above the <b>welding</b> <b>temperature</b> and hammered, or [...] "wrought." [...] This squeezed out air pockets and melted slag, bringing the iron grains into close contact to form a solid block (billet).|$|E
5000|$|The dressed metal {{goes back}} in the fire, is brought near to welding heat, removed from the fire, and brushed. Flux is {{sometimes}} applied, which prevents oxygen from reaching and burning the metal during forging, and it is returned to the fire. The smith now watches carefully to avoid overheating the metal. There is some challenge to this because, to see {{the color of the}} metal, the smith must remove it from the fireâ€”exposing it to air, which can rapidly oxidize it. So the smith might probe into the fire with a bit of steel wire, prodding lightly at the mating faces. When the end of the wire sticks on to the metal, it is at the right temperature (a small weld forms where the wire touches the mating face, so it sticks). The smith commonly places the metal in the fire so he can see it without letting surrounding air contact the surface. (Note that smiths don't always use flux, especially in the UK.)Now the smith moves with rapid purpose, quickly taking the metal from the fire to the anvil and bringing the mating faces together. A few light hammer taps bring the mating faces into complete contact and squeeze out the fluxâ€”and finally, the smith returns the work to the fire. The weld begins with the taps, but often the joint is weak and incomplete, so the smith reheats the joint to <b>welding</b> <b>temperature</b> and works the weld with light blows to [...] "set" [...] the weld and finally to dress it to the shape.|$|E

40|$|Friction stir welding is a {{patented}} joining process {{invented in}} 1991 at The Welding Institute in Cambridge, UK, and further developed {{to the stage}} suitable for production.

This work studies the thermal characteristics of this process and provides a modeling technique based on Neural Network {{that can be used}} for real-time control. A thermal feed-back control method is presented to control the process. Using some thermal modeling for the heat distribution during friction stir welding process, this paper displays the complexity of obtaining an accurate design for the thermal feed back control. A three-dimensional transient heat transfer model is developed here for a sequential joining process (Friction Stir Welding- FSW) applied on aluminum parts. A neural network is created based on a set of experiments to predict the spatial and temporal variations in the <b>temperature</b> over the <b>weld</b> seam for different set of input variables. The model includes the dynamic and friction behavior of the rotating spindle and the thermal behaviors of the weld components involved. The significance of this modeling approach is that it captures the movement of the spindle, simulating a sequential joining process along a continuous weld seam. The modeling results are compared with experimental data obtained by thermocouples and infrared camera, and accurately predict the trend of variations in <b>weld</b> <b>temperature.</b> A fuzzy-logic based controller is proposed to regulate the FSW process parameters to maintain the <b>weld</b> <b>temperature</b> within the margin required to ensure the weld quality.
