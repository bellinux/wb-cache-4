5|$|A {{study of}} a group with a mean dosage of aspirin of 270mg per day {{estimated}} an average absolute risk increase in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) of 12 events per 10,000 persons. In comparison, the estimated absolute risk reduction in myocardial infarction was 137 events per 10,000 persons, and a reduction of 39 events per 10,000 persons in ischemic stroke. In cases where ICH already has occurred, aspirin use results in higher mortality, with a dose of about 250mg per day resulting in a relative risk of death <b>within</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> after the ICH around 2.5 (95% confidence interval 1.3 to 4.6).|$|E

5|$|Each {{parliament}} {{lasts for}} {{a maximum of}} five years from the date of its first sitting, and once a parliament has been dissolved a general election must be held <b>within</b> <b>three</b> <b>months.</b> Following a general election, the President appoints as Prime Minister an MP who, in his judgment, is likely to command {{the confidence of the}} majority of the MPs. In practice, the Prime Minister is usually the leader of the political party holding the majority of the seats in Parliament. The President also appoints other Ministers from among the MPs, acting in accordance with the Prime Minister's advice.|$|E
5|$|Francois Fillon then visited Guadaloupe {{and brought}} with him a team of experts from the Ministry of the Interior to assess the nature and cost of the damage. The local {{government}} reported to them that 75% of Guadeloupe's banana plantations, valued at €100million, were totally destroyed. Despite promises by Overseas Minister Christian Estrosi that all problems would be resolved <b>within</b> <b>three</b> <b>months,</b> it took over six months to restart banana production, and several more to restore lost capacity. Other than the crop damage, the island suffered only minor wind and flooding damage, {{both of which were}} quickly repaired.|$|E
5|$|German {{operations}} in the Atlantic also suffered. By May 1943, as Allied counter-measures became increasingly effective, the resulting sizeable German submarine losses forced a temporary halt of the German Atlantic naval campaign. In November 1943, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill met with Chiang Kai-shek in Cairo and then with Joseph Stalin in Tehran. The former conference determined the post-war return of Japanese territory and the military planning for the Burma Campaign, while the latter included agreement that the Western Allies would invade Europe in 1944 and that the Soviet Union would declare war on Japan <b>within</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> of Germany's defeat.|$|E

50|$|The {{constitution}} {{had given}} the Governor substantial powers over the provincial councils, but many anomalies resulted {{in an increase in}} the power of the Superintendents. The Governor could dissolve the provincial council at any time, veto its enactments, or remove the Superintendent from office if voted by the majority of provincial councillors or disallow the Superintendent's elections (the latter two both <b>within</b> <b>three</b> <b>month</b> of the Superintendent's election). However, only Superintendents had the power to convene a provincial council, and by simply delaying the first meeting beyond the <b>three</b> <b>months</b> threshold, much of the power of the Governor was negated. So in practice, Superintendents were more powerful than had been anticipated by the constitution.|$|R
50|$|In June 2009, Stirling Resources Limited, under {{managing}} director Michael Kiernan, announced to inject funds into Monarch Gold. Stirling announced, it would cover all of Monarch's debt, A$55 million and intended to return both the Mount Ida Gold Mine and Davyhurst into operation, the later <b>within</b> <b>three</b> <b>month</b> of the take over.

Zhukov agreed, and in December asked for his help writing a paper to {{be presented to the}} commanders of the Soviet Military Districts. Bagramyan's paper, Conducting a Contemporary Offensive Operation, apparently impressed Zhukov, as he promoted Bagramyan to become the head of Operations for the Soviet 12th Army based in Ukraine. <b>Within</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> however, Bagramyan, then a colonel, was appointed deputy {{chief of staff of the}} Southwestern Front, headquartered in Kiev.|$|E

5|$|Louis {{assembled}} his armies in Temesvár (now Timișoara in Romania) in February 1365. According a royal charter that year, he {{was planning}} to invade Wallachia because the new voivode, Vladislav Vlaicu, had refused to obey him. However, he ended up heading a campaign against the Bulgarian Tsardom of Vidin and its ruler Ivan Sratsimir, which suggests that Vladislav Vlaicu had in the meantime yielded to him. Louis seized Vidin and imprisoned Ivan Stratsimir in May or June. <b>Within</b> <b>three</b> <b>months,</b> his troops occupied Ivan Stratsimir's realm, which was organized into a separate border province, or banate, under the command of Hungarian lords.|$|E
5|$|The Dales pony is one {{of three}} breeds known to be a carrier of the fatal genetic disease foal {{immunodeficiency}} syndrome (FIS). FIS is a recessive disease; affected foals are born when they inherit the gene from both parents. Foals with FIS appear normal when born, but have a compromised immune system and anemia, leading to untreatable infections and death <b>within</b> <b>three</b> <b>months.</b> Following the development of a genetic test in 2010, 12% of Dales ponies tested in the UK were found to be carriers. The use of genetic testing has allowed breeders to avoid mating two carrier animals, so that the disease is avoided in foals.|$|E
5|$|The President must {{declare the}} office of Prime Minister vacant if the Prime Minister resigns his office, or if the President, acting in his discretion, is {{satisfied}} that the Prime Minister has ceased to command the confidence {{of a majority of}} the MPs.

A general election must be held <b>within</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> after the dissolution of Parliament. This gives the former Prime Minister the opportunity to consolidate support by receiving a fresh mandate at the polls.|$|E

5|$|The carrot is a {{biennial}} {{plant in}} the umbellifer family Apiaceae. At first, it grows a rosette of leaves while building up the enlarged taproot. Fast-growing cultivars mature <b>within</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> (90 days) of sowing the seed, while slower-maturing cultivars are harvested four months later (120 days). The roots contain high quantities of alpha- and beta-carotene, and are {{a good source of}} vitamin K and vitamin B6, but the belief that eating carrots improves night vision is a myth put forward by the British in World War II to mislead the enemy about their military capabilities.|$|E
5|$|Union forces hastily {{attempted}} {{to destroy the}} vital salt works. They destroyed about {{one third of the}} boiling kettles and most evaporating sheds. They also damaged portions of the Virginia & Tennessee railroad. But they failed to destroy or damage the actual salt wells. General Stoneman claimed a victory and retreated out of Virginia before Confederate forces could completely surround him. Carpenter's role is strangely missing from letters and other documents that simply note that he was there. <b>Within</b> <b>three</b> <b>months,</b> the saltworks were back in full production.

5|$|Before {{the final}} vote, Parliament demanded {{a number of}} {{concessions}} {{as part of a}} future working agreement under the new Lisbon Treaty. The deal includes that Parliament's President will attend high level Commission meetings.

Parliament also did not secure a say over the appointment of delegation heads and special representatives for foreign policy.
