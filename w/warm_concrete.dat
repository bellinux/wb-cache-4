2500|$|Wells {{first went}} to Burma in 2004 for a {{short-term}} voluntary job. Appreciating the culture and finding the people very gracious and humble, he decided to move back there if the opportunity arose. In early 2006, Wells relocated to Rangoon with his wife Bronwyn and daughter Johanna {{to participate in a}} community health HIV/AIDS education project with World Concern Burma as associate fieldworkers of TEAR Australia, a Christian organization. Wells began recording songs for a new album using a guitar and a traditional Burmese banjo. The band's second album, A Plea en Vendredi, appeared later that year. In addition to the Australian release by Popboomerang, Wells also entered into agreements with Inpartmaint in Tokyo and Pocket Records in Beijing for the album to be released in Japan and China respectively. It subsequently reached number 16 in Japan's HMV Shibuya international chart. The band wanted to make the album [...] "a little more homespun" [...] so it used mandolins and out-of-tune pianos, and played the songs live rather than track by track; Wells also felt that [...] "the vocals are more natural". The song Valder Fields from the album was named Single of the Week by Beat Magazine. Wells has said that the song [...] "is a stream of consciousness that hints at the tension between a life of responsibility (being on time, applying for jobs) and a Leunig-esque life of contemplation (falling asleep on the <b>warm</b> <b>concrete</b> next to a fountain)" [...] and that [...] "giving oneself up to either one leads to a distortion of reality through either too much responsibility or not enough". In August 2007, the band went on to perform a sell-out tour of four Japanese cities.|$|E

Both artists work collaboratively with theatre, dance, media & design & could {{engage in}} a {{discussion}} about interdisciplinary practice. They will be speaking {{on the role of}} video in their practice & especially live feed video in performance. Coutts is an interdisciplinary artist working across Australia & the Asia Pacific.  He creates collaborative performance works which are cross media & cross platform.  He is {{a founding member of the}} art collective Field Theory & founder & editor of the online Live Art resource LALA. He is also one half the research & art collaboration Deadpan with Willoh S. Weiland. In 2009 Martyn won a green room award for his video design on the Harry Harlow Project – a solo performance work that explores the life & work of American psychologist Harry Harlow. Written & performed by James Saunders, directed & designed by Brian Lipson, sound composition by Kelly Ryall. Smiles is the sound designer of I left my shoes on <b>warm</b> <b>concrete</b> & stood in the rain, a performance that harnesses emotion as a physical force. Intricate dance, haunting words & a striking soundtrack take the audience on a journey through struggle & the creative resourcefulness it inspires in humankind. The evocative collaboration between movement, text, sound & light is accentuated by simple staging & encourages space for the imagination of the audience. The technical elements of the performance are exposed & define the reality of the physical space around the makeshift fantasy world of the performer. The work unfolds over a series of ‘chapters’ as the performance darts between scenes of fantasy filled darkness & physically charged light. The accompanying narration awakens images, commands action & guides the audience through the independent elements of a multi-textured experience. ...|$|E
40|$|Clinical {{observations}} over a {{long period}} sug-gested to one of us (D. B.) that many women with cancer of the breast were of a more masculine physical type than both normal healthy women and those with cancer of the cervix. A number of published studies have also indi-cated that there may be some association between incidence ofcancer and constitutional type. Sheldon, Hartl, and McDermott (1949) published some somatotype distributions of patients with cancer of the breast and uterus at the Presbyterian Hospital, New York, and the distributions showed the patients to be predominantly endomorphic meso-morphs. As this tendency also appeared in patients suffering from other diseases at the same hospital, it might well have been due to selection. Hagnell (1961), by making personality assess-ments on a large number of Swedish women, found that a significantly high proportion of women who developed cancer were rated as substable person-alities, i. e., <b>warm,</b> <b>concrete,</b> naive, industrious, sociable, and tending towards personal relation-ships, and Lindegard and Nyman (1956) showed that substability was correlated with body build; Substability has traits in common with Eysenck's (1959) 'extraversion', and Hagnell's findings are therefore supported by the work of Coppen and Metcalfe (1963) who found a higher extraversion score in patients with breast cancer than in controls drawn from either a hospital or the general popula-tion. With these findings in mind, we began at Cambridge an anthropometric study of women patients with cancer of the breast and cervix to see if there were any physical differences between such women and a group drawn from the normal popu-lation. Measurements were also made on a group of hospital patients with cancer at sites other than the breast or the cervix and on a group of hospital patients without cancer. It was hoped that from the information acquired a simple method might be evolved for detecting women with a 'high risk ' of developing cancer of the breast. Such a method of detection could be of great value in a preliminary survey for breast cancer; elaborate tests could then be u§ed in the high-risk group of women...|$|E

One of the major instruments proposed is a carbon tax. A main obstacle for its implementation, however, are concerns about the short-term effects on employment and output. In order to miti-gate possible negative effects of enviromental taxes on output and employment, several European countries have introduced so-called environmental tax reforms (ETR) which are designed in a budget neutral manner: Revenues from the tax {{can be used to}} reduce existing distortionary taxes or to subsidize less polluting activities. We apply this idea to a carbon tax scheme by performing a vector autoregression (VAR) with output and employment data of nine industrialized countries. We impose a simultaneous policy shock on the economy whereby a carbon tax is levied on high-carbon intensive industries and the resulting tax revenue is redistributed to low-carbon intensive industries. Impulse response analysis shows that such a policy allows for net gains in terms of output and employment. ...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Warm</b> mix asphalt <b>concrete</b> (commonly {{abbreviated}} as WMA) {{is produced}} by adding either zeolites, waxes, asphalt emulsions, or sometimes even water to the asphalt binder prior to mixing.

The usage of these additives in hot mixed asphalt (above) may afford easier compaction and allow cold weather paving or longer hauls. Use of warm mix is rapidly expanding.

40|$|Since the {{construction}} sector uses 50 % of the Earth. s {{raw materials and}} produces 50 % of its waste, {{the development of more}} durable and sustainable building materials is crucial. Today, Construction and Demolition Waste (CDW) is mainly used in low level applications, namely as unbound material for foundations, e. g., in road construction. Mineral demolition waste can be recycled as crushed aggregates for concrete, but these reduce the compressive strength and affect the workability due to higher values of water absorption. To advance the use of concrete rubble, Completely Recyclable Concrete (CRC) is designed for reincarnation within the cement production, following the Cradle-to-Cradle (C 2 C) principle. By the design, CRC becomes a resource for cement production because the chemical composition of CRC will be similar to that of cement raw materials. If CRC is used on a regular basis, a closed concrete-cement-concrete material cycle will arise, which is completely different from the current life cycle of traditional concrete. Within the research towards this CRC it is important to quantify the benefit for the environment and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) needs to be performed, of which the results are presented in a this paper.

40|$|Reinforced {{concrete}} {{structures are}} damaged by shrinkage {{of the concrete}} surface layers due to wind action and high local temperature gradients. The latter are of importance, if long-term <b>warming</b> of <b>concrete</b> structures {{is followed by a}} quick cooling together with the influence of moisture, as it may happen in the case of stormy weather. In addition to these defects, stresses in concrete structures may result if they are strengthened by an additional top layer of new-cast concrete. These stresses have to be transmitted between new and old concrete. Within this thesis it will be investigated, to what extend damage through shrinkage of the surface layers and locally high temperature gradients have to be expected in these layers due to inclined principal tension stresses, as well as the degree at which such stresses could be mechanically influenced by reinforcement. Stresses are a result of changes of the climatic environmental conditions due to large changes of temperature or due to the evaporation of water {{from the surface of the}} concrete structure. Therefore cracks in the concrete may appear without additional external loads. Temperature changes lead to deformations in building materials. The loss of moisture content in concrete is the main reason for shrinkage of the material. Due to the existing boundary conditions and the respective restraining influences these deformations may lead to damages e. g. cracks in concrete. The environmental conditions have to be considered at the design state of structures for the estimation of durability and protection of the structure against possible damages. Therefore it is necessary that temperature and moisture content are considered within initial pre-calculations of planned measures for strengthening concrete structures. Existing methods for calculating such processes in concrete structures, which are usually used in practice, do not give sufficient results for a detailed investigation. For this reason a detailed identification of the main mechanisms which lead to a reduction of durability is carried out in this thesis. First of all the fundamentals for a numerical description of the moisture and temperature movement in concrete are derived to investigate their effect on the mechanical behaviour of concrete in subsequent steps.

40|$|At present, {{the cement}} {{industry}} generates approximately 5 % of the world`s anthropogenic CO(2) emissions. This share {{is expected to}} increase since demand for cement based products is forecast to multiply by a factor of 2. 5 within the next 40 years and the traditional strategies to mitigate emissions, focused on the production of cement, will not be capable of compensating such growth. Therefore, additional mitigation strategies are needed, including an increase in the efficiency of cement use. This paper proposes indicators for measuring cement use efficiency, presents a benchmark based on literature data and discusses potential gains in efficiency. The binder intensity (bi) index measures the amount of binder (kg m(- 3)) necessary to deliver 1 MPa of mechanical strength, and consequently express the efficiency of using binder materials. The CO(2) intensity index (ci) allows estimating the global <b>warming</b> potential of <b>concrete</b> formulations. Research benchmarks show that bi similar to 5 kg m(- 3) MPa(- 1) are feasible and have already been achieved for concretes > 50 MPa. However, concretes with lower compressive strengths have binder intensities varying between 10 and 20 kg m(- 3) MPa(- 1). These values can be a result of the minimum cement content established in many standards and reveal a significant potential for performance gains. In addition, combinations of low bi and ci are shown to be feasible. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. FINEP (Habitare) CNP...|$|R
50|$|Plenum {{supply air}} {{temperature}} rise is the increase of the conditioned air due to convective heat gain as it travels through the underfloor supply plenum from the plenum inlet to the floor diffusers. This phenomenon is also named thermal decay. Plenum air temperature rise is caused by cool supply air coming into contact with <b>warmer</b> than air <b>concrete</b> slab and raised floor. According to a modeling study, air temperature rise can be quite significant (as much as 5 °C or 9 °F) and subsequently, compared to an idealized simulated UFAD case with no air temperature rise, elevated diffuser air temperatures can lead to higher supply airflow rate and increased fan and chiller energy consumption. The same study found that air temperature rise in summer is higher than in winter and it also depends on the climate. The ground floor with a slab on grade has less temperature rise compared to middle and top floors, and an increase of the {{supply air temperature}} causes {{a decrease in the}} temperature rise. The temperature rise is not significantly affected by the perimeter zone orientation, the internal heat gain and the window-to-wall ratio. Supply plenum air temperature rise, thus, has implications on the energy saving potential of UFAD systems and their ability to meet cooling requirements with supply temperatures above those of conventional overhead systems. Current research suggests that both energy and thermal performance can be improved in UFAD systems by ducting air to perimeter zones where loads tend to be the greatest. Critics suggest however that such underfloor ducting reduces the benefit of having a low-pressure plenum space, as well as adding design and installation complications when fitting ducts between floor tile pedestals.|$|R
40|$|The main aim of {{this thesis}} is to refine models for {{strength}} and heat development of the young concrete, and evaluate if developed models at Luleå University of Technology (LTU) for creep, autogenous shrinkage and thermal dilation needs refinement. These are of importance in hardening control and in crack control of a concrete structure. Strength development {{is one of the}} most important properties in concrete to consider when analysing concrete structures. The need of actions on site is different at various stages of hardening, from the fresh concrete to the hardened concrete. This thesis defines a model analysing maturity and associated strength growth within three important time periods. The model can be applied separately within each of these periods depending on test data available. Known is that the temperature plays an important role on the strength development of concrete structures. Not so well known is that, if the concrete temperature remains high, strength reduction at later ages often occurs compared to hardening at lower temperature. Both these phenomena have been implemented in the model for strength growth and the functionality of the model is demonstrated by evaluation of laboratory tests for five concrete mixes and two types of cement. As heat of hydration affects the temperature levels and several other properties of concrete structures it is important to document the parameters accurately. In the traditional semi-adiabat (TSA) the measured heat energy originates from the reaction between cement and water. This energy <b>warms</b> up the <b>concrete</b> sample and all the ambient materials of the equipment. In order to model these energies, the TSA setup is transformed into an associated sphere. A refined model using a correction factor is introduced, which accounts for energies lost to the TSA setup materials. Results show that the effect of this factor cannot be disregarded. An increased insulation amount gives a decreased cooling factor but an increased need for correction. Creep at constant temperature, both for moist sealed specimens and drying out conditions, are evaluated. The Linear Logarithmic creep Model (LLM) is shown to work well for basic creep, i. e. creep at moist sealed conditions. But, for creep during simultaneous moist drying, there is a need to adjust the current model or develop a new model to account for the increase of creep due to ongoing drying. Autogenous shrinkage and thermal dilation (free deformation) are evaluated from tests. For the free deformation of young concrete at variable temperature the existing models are satisfactory in modelling the thermal dilation, but in some cases the autogenous shrinkage cannot be adequately described. A new or refined model is needed that works for autogeneous shrinkage even at more complex temperature variations.

40|$|All roadway {{agencies}} {{monitor and}} maintain their infrastructure as it deteriorates over time. Agencies allocate {{the money that}} they have for maintenance, rehabilitation and reconstruction operations across their entire network. Regular and timely maintenance and rehabilitation treatments can postpone the need for reconstruction on a roadway. 	The need for infrastructure sustainability has been brought to the forefront of society and has become an important part of any public agency’s decision making processes. To achieve sustainable roadways social, economic and environmental benefits must be achieved while maintaining technically sound solutions. By considering the amount of energy that is consumed and the amount of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions generated through various roadway treatments, sustainability can be brought into the decision making process. The objective of this research was to develop a probabilistic model that quantifies the amount of energy that is consumed and carbon dioxide equivalents (CO 2 e) generated for typical roadway construction, maintenance, rehabilitation and reconstruction projects in Saskatchewan and Alberta. 	The model constructed within this work was divided into three sub-models: 1) material production, 2) equipment usage and 3) material transport. For every variable that was required to be entered into each sub-model, a low, average or most likely and high value was determined. By using a range of input values the uncertainty of the values entered was incorporated and sensitive parameters were identified. 	A base case study of a one lane-kilometer (lane-km), 3, 700 m 2, section of rural roadway was analyzed. For the initial construction of a lane-km of traditional flexible pavement roadway it was determined that 1, 870 GJ (giga joules) of energy is required. Based on an annual average amount of energy used per home in Saskatchewan, 126 GJ/year, 1, 870 GJ would power approximately 15 homes for one year. Similarly it was determined that 152. 4 tonnes (t) CO 2 e are emitted {{for the construction of a}} lane-km of traditional flexible pavement roadway. Based on an average CO 2 e generation value of 5. 1 t per passenger vehicle per year the GHG emissions generated from the construction of a lane-km of roadway is equivalent to the GHG emissions released by approximately 30 passenger vehicles over one year. It was also determined that the volume of CO 2 e generated for initial construction compared to the volume of material in the roadway was a ratio of 30 to 1. 	The base case study also reviewed various maintenance, rehabilitation and reconstruction treatments for the amount of energy consumed and GHG emissions generated for one lane-km. From the modeled values it was found that the order of energy consumed and CO 2 e generated from least to greatest for maintenance treatments is: fog seal, slurry seal, micro surfacing, single, double and triple chip seal and ultra thin overlay. For rehabilitation and reconstruction treatments the order of energy consumed and CO 2 e generation from least to greatest is: cold in-place recycling, mill and fill, full depth reclamation, remove and replace with recycled materials and remove and replace with virgin materials. 	Through a sensitivity analysis of the input parameters, it was observed that for maintenance treatments the sensitive parameters were the equipment efficiency (EFE) value, the placement rate of the treatment, the aggregate application rate and the amount of asphalt binder included in the treatment. For rehabilitation and reconstruction treatments, the two most sensitive parameters were the asphalt concrete plant energy and the application rate of the Portland cement. 	Further investigation into how each sub-model contributed to the overall amount of energy consumed and CO 2 e generated found the production of materials contributed the greatest to the overall values. When examining the production of each layer in a traditional flexible pavement roadway structure, the asphalt layers contributed the greatest to the energy consumed at 72. 1 percent of all materials produced. The asphalt layers also contributed the greatest to the GHG emissions generated from the production of materials at 42. 7 percent. Further breaking down the production of the asphalt layers, the energy requirements at the hot mix asphalt concrete plant account for 75. 9 percent of the energy consumed and 52. 0 percent of the CO 2 e generated for the production of the materials of the asphalt layers. 	The cost of each treatment was reviewed based on the cost of diesel at $ 1. 21 /litre and the amount of energy consumed. The costs of energy for the maintenance treatments ranged from $ 174 /lane-km for fog seal to $ 5, 488 /lane-km of the ultra thin overlay. The cold in-place recycling and mill and fill rehabilitation treatments had energy costs of $ 13, 545 and $ 21, 440 /lane-km respectively. The costs of the energy consumed for the reconstruction treatments ranged from $ 21, 710 /lane-km for full depth reclamation and $ 71, 164 /lane-km for remove and replace with virgin materials. Based on a review of the City of Saskatoon’s 2012 proposed treatment plan for its roadway network the cost of energy was estimated at $ 1, 232, 000 for work on 93 lane-km of roadway. 	The costs of GHG emissions were also determined based on the amount of CO 2 e generated and the value of one tonne of carbon on the voluntary carbon credit market at $ 6 /tonne. The costs of carbon for the maintenance treatments ranged from $ 3 /lane-km for fog seal to $ 64 /lane-km for the ultra thin overlay. For the rehabilitation treatments the cost of carbon for the cold in-place recycling was $ 224 /lane-km and $ 266 /lane-km for the mill and fill treatment. The reconstruction treatments ranged from $ 524 /lane-km for full depth reclamation and $ 1, 062 for remove and replace with virgin materials. 	Finally four field case studies were reviewed to determine the amount of energy consumed and GHG emissions generated through construction. The first was the reconstruction of Range Road 232, a rural roadway with virgin materials. The second was the reconstruction of Kenderdine Road with recycled materials. The energy consumed and GHG emissions generated for these construction projects are 1, 917 and 1, 146 GJ/lane-km, and 150. 3 and 92. 6 t CO 2 e/lane-km, respectively. The third case study further reviewed the use of <b>warm</b> mix asphalt <b>concrete</b> (WMAC) and the use of recycled asphalt pavement (RAP) in the Kenderdine Road pavement structure. This research determined that with the incorporation of WMAC and 10 percent RAP in the asphalt layers and with the use of recycled materials in the base layers the amount of energy consumed would be reduced by 31. 8 percent and the GHG emissions reduced by 34. 8 percent compared to a traditional virgin pavement structure. The final case study reviewed the City of Saskatoon’s 2012 proposed roadway restoration and reconstruction plan. From the model it was found that 38, 281 GJ of energy was consumed and 2, 617 t CO 2 e was generated. 	This work shows that the probabilistic model developed in this research may be applied to a variety of roadway treatments from maintenance to reconstruction in urban and rural applications. With the use of the model, roadway project managers can make informed decisions for roadway treatments based on energy consumption and GHG emission generation values. By incorporating the amount of energy that is consumed and GHG emissions generated into the decision making process of roadway infrastructure management, more sustainable infrastructure management can be achieved...|$|R
