5|$|Using her {{influence}} at The Miami Herald, Douglas wrote columns about poverty: You {{can have}} the most beautiful {{city in the world}} as appearance goes, the streets may be clean and shining, the avenues broad and tree lined, the public buildings dignified, adequate and well kept... {{but if you have a}} weak or inadequate health department, or a public opinion lax on the subject, all the splendors of your city will have not value. In 1948 Douglas served on the Coconut Grove Slum Clearance Committee, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> hers named Elizabeth Virrick, who was horrified to learn that no running water or sewers were connected to the racially segregated part of Coconut Grove. They helped pass a law requiring all homes in Miami to have toilets and bathtubs.

Douglas noted that all of the money loaned was repaid.|$|E
