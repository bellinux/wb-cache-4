40|$|The {{extension}} of the <b>washability</b> <b>curve</b> and of the curve of grade versus density to ores poses problems, because at high densities, only bromoform (2. 85) and methylene iodide (3. 31) are available, i. e. for densities above 2. 5 - 2. 6 these curves are known only at three or four points {{to which it is}} possible to add two supplementary points corresponding to the limits of the range of variation; the densimetric zone beyond 3. 3 remains in practice inaccessible. To overcome this difficulty, the Ore Dressing Laboratory of the Free University of Brussels has introduced the 'fictitious density' fractions which consist of construction of the missing part of the washability curves by estimating a series of fictitious separating densities.

40|$|AbstractA pure new MATLAB-based image {{recognition}} system {{was developed to}} compute the coal particle picture of same grain class through the digital image processing method, 13 image feature parameters was selected to be most representative image characteristic parameters. Take the above parameters as the input of RBF neural network, the density level of coal particles could be estimated, combined with the real ash content of each density level, the <b>washability</b> <b>curve</b> could be drawed. Experement show,the absolute error of the total ash is 2. 375 %,which is Slightly big in the China standards of coal preparation (GB/T 477 - 1998); the related coefficients of each indicator in both actual and predicted float-and-sink material are all close to 1, while the curves of λ, β, θ and δ are very similar and the deviation of ξ curve is relatively large...|$|E
40|$|The Sink - Float {{analysis}} {{is a method}} of investigation of impurities bounded in coal using liquids of different specific gravities. A sample of 0. 5 kg of Maiganga coal was poured into a solution of zinc chloride having different densities of 1. 00, 1. 10, 1. 20, 1. 30, 1. 40, 1. 50, 1. 60, 1. 70, 1. 80, 1. 90 and 2. 00. The floats and sinks {{in each of these}} densities were obtained and used to calculate the cumulative float, cumulative sink, instantaneous ash and distribution of ash; these values were then used to develop the respective partition curves (<b>washability</b> <b>curve)</b> which were obtained by plotting the partition coefficient against the mean of its density range. A sink - float problem was tested using the partition curves obtained. A yield of 80 % was considered where the clean coal contains 16. 45 % ash with rejects of 70. 18 % ash separated at a specific gravity of 1. 7. The separation with a distribution value of 5 % becomes easy according to Burt (2004), Herbst (2005), Mills (2008) and Bird (2001) that if a low value less than 10 % for the distribution is recorded, the separation becomes easy, while a value more than 20 % gives a very difficult separation...|$|E
30|$|The <b>washability</b> <b>curves</b> of As and Hg are similar, {{which is}} also the case for Ga and W, Mn, Ta and Ti. High removal rates were {{obtained}} for these elements during coal preparation because sharp <b>washability</b> <b>curves</b> were obtained. The elements with flat <b>washability</b> <b>curves</b> are evenly distributed in the organic matter and in the minerals and they cannot be effectively removed during coal preparation.|$|R
30|$|The <b>washability</b> <b>curves</b> of Mn and Hg are similar, {{which are}} also the cases of Sb and Co, Be and Ni, Ba and Cr. High removal rates can be {{achieved}} for most elements in this coal preparation procedure because sharp <b>washability</b> <b>curves</b> were obtained. The elements with flat <b>washability</b> <b>curves,</b> i.e. Sb, Co, Se, are even-distributed in organics and in mineral matters and can’t be effectively removed in coal preparation. The washabilities of trace elements in an operating coal preparation plant would also depend on the particle size of the feed coal and {{the efficiency of the}} separation method(s) used.|$|R
40|$|This {{article is}} an {{overview}} on the beneficiation of the Greek lignites, {{one of the}} most important mineral commodities for Greece, with recoverable reserves amounting to about 4, 000 Mt. This figure does not take into account a huge peat deposit. Almost all of the lignite mined annually (60 Mt/year) is used for energy production. The applied beneficiation methods include heavy media separation and jigging. The experimental results shots, that gravimetric separation is feasible. Comparison of the theoretical <b>washability</b> <b>curves</b> for xylite and lignite indicates that the xylite is more amenable to gravity separation than lignite. Heavy media separation proved to be more efficient than jigging. The degree of beneficiation depends on the clean coal specifications. Given that the lignite deposits in Greece have more or less similar characteristics, this article provides some general guidelines showing theoretical limits for beneficiation of these coals...|$|R
40|$|The Reflux Classifier (RC) is a {{fluidized}} bed separator capable of operating at high hydraulic loadings {{due to the}} presence of parallel inclined plates within the system. When the fluidized suspension passes up through the inclined channels formed by the plates, faster settling particles segregate onto the inclined surfaces, and slide back down to the zone below, while slower settling particles pass on through. The parallel inclined plates provide for a much higher sedimentation area. This arrangement is suitable for both hydrosizing and gravity separation. At MEGS 01, the results obtained for a pilot-scale study of the RC were reported [Galvin, K. P., Doroodchi, E., Callen, A. M., Lambert, N., Pratten, S. J., 2002. Pilot plant trial of the reflux classifier. Minerals Engineering, 15, 19 – 25]. Since then Ludowici MPE, in association with the University of Newcastle have developed the technology at the full-scale. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to provide details on the performance of the full-scale RC in the gravity separation of a coal and mineral matter feed in the size range of 0. 25 – 2. 0 mm. Historically, this feed has been processed using spirals, however, there is a strong trend now in Australia to employ {{fluidized bed}} devices, thus allowing significant changes to be made to the cut-point. The performance of the full-scale RC is described in terms of the partition curves for individual size fractions, and in terms of the yield–ash condition on the feed <b>washability</b> <b>curve.</b> It is concluded that the separation performance is equivalent to that obtained at the pilot scale...|$|E
