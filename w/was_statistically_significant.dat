This study was not blinded and did not include controls; while an improvement in symptoms was observed compared to initial baseline, no significant changes were observed in two indicators of inflammation (C-reactive protein and immunoglobulin E levels). A double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of an MSM-containing throat spray to reduce snoring reported a severity decrease of 28% {{in the placebo group}} and 54% for the treated group.

Analogously, collective intelligence research aims to explore reasons why certain groups perform more intelligent than other groups given that c is just moderately correlated with the intelligence of individual group members. According to Woolley et al.'s results, neither team cohesion nor motivation or satisfaction correlated with c. However, they claim that three factors were found as significant correlates: {{the variance in the}} number of speaking turns, group members' average social sensitivity and the proportion of females. All three had similar predictive power for c, but only social sensitivity <b>was</b> <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> (b=0.33, P=0.05).|$|E

One of the researchers, Richard Wiseman, {{professor of psychology at the}} University of Hertfordshire, responded that Josephson had no record of publishing on parapsychology. Keith Rennolis, professor of applied statistics at the University of Greenwich, supported Josephson's position, asserting that the experiment was [...] "woefully inadequate" [...] to determine any effect.|$|E

2500|$|Pre-approval Phase III {{clinical}} trials, {{like the}} APPROVe study, showed no increased relative risk of adverse cardiovascular events {{for the first}} eighteen months of rofecoxib usage (Merck, 2004).

Although this was a relatively small study and only the last result <b>was</b> <b>statistically</b> <b>significant,</b> critics have charged that this early finding should have prompted Merck to quickly conduct larger studies of rofecoxib's cardiovascular safety.

2500|$|A few {{comparative}} {{studies have found}} that cancer survival rates vary more widely among different populations in the U.S. than they do in Canada.

Furthermore, they found that the American survival advantage in the four highest quintiles <b>was</b> <b>statistically</b> <b>significant.</b> They strongly suspected that the difference due to prostate cancer was a result of greater detection of asymptomatic cases in the U.S. [...] Their data indicates that neglecting the prostate cancer data reduces the American advantage in the four highest quintiles and gives Canada a statistically significant advantage in the lowest quintile.

2500|$|A 2009 {{study on}} two {{separate}} samples of male undergraduate students in Canada found that 62 to 65%, {{depending on the}} sample, had entertained sadistic fantasies, and 22 to 39% engaged in sadistic behaviors during sex. The figures were 62 and 52% for bondage fantasies, and 14 to 23% for bondage behaviors. A 2014 study involving a mixed sample of Canadian college students and online volunteers, both male and female, reported that 19% of male samples and 10% of female samples rated the sadistic scenarios described in a questionnaire as being at least [...] "slightly arousing" [...] {{on a scale that}} ranged from [...] "very repulsive" [...] to [...] "very arousing"; the difference <b>was</b> <b>statistically</b> <b>significant.</b> The corresponding figures for the masochistic scenarios were 15% for male students and 17% for female students, a non-significant difference. In a 2011 study on 367 middle-aged and elderly men recruited from the broader community in Berlin, 21.8% of the men self-reported sadistic fantasies and 15.5% sadistic behaviors; 24.8% self-reported any such fantasy and/or behavior. The corresponding figures for self-reported masochism were 15.8% for fantasy, 12.3% for behavior, and 18.5% for fantasy and/or behavior.

2500|$|Multiple {{human trials}} using HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, known as statins, have {{repeatedly}} confirmed that changing lipoprotein transport patterns from unhealthy to healthier patterns significantly lowers cardiovascular disease event rates, even {{for people with}} cholesterol values currently considered low for adults. Studies have also found that statins reduce atheroma progression. As a result, people {{with a history of}} cardiovascular disease may derive benefit from statins irrespective of their cholesterol levels (total cholesterol below 5.0mmol/L [...] ), and in men without cardiovascular disease, there is benefit from lowering abnormally high cholesterol levels ("primary prevention"). Primary prevention in women was originally practiced only by extension of the findings in studies on men, since, in women, none of the large statin trials conducted prior to 2007 demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in overall mortality or in cardiovascular endpoints. In 2008, a large clinical trial reported that, in apparently healthy adults with increased levels of the inflammatory biomarker high-sensitivity C-reactive protein but with low initial LDL, 20mg/day of rosuvastatin for 1.9 years resulted in a 44% reduction in the incidence of cardiovascular events and a 20% reduction in all-cause mortality; the effect <b>was</b> <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> for both genders. Though this result was met with some skepticism, later studies and meta-analyses likewise demonstrated statistically significant (but smaller) reductions in all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, without significant heterogeneity by gender.|$|E
