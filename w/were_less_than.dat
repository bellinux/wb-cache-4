The crew was advised that there were low clouds and thunderstorms, both conditions that violated landing criteria, so managers waived the first opportunity. A second opportunity was also not taken, as the weather had not improved. Entry Flight Director Norm Knight called up Edwards Air Force Base shortly after the decision to delay to Saturday was made, which would give the crew {{a total of six}} Saturday landing opportunities, three at each location.|$|E

The temperature dependencies of resistivity and thermopower have been measured. It {{was found that the}} S(T) dependencies take some additional features with Ca content increase. The results obtained have been analyzed {{on the basis of the}} phenomenological theory of electron transport in the case of the narrow conductive band. The main parameters of the band spectrum (the band filling with electrons degree and the total effective band width) have been determined. The dependencies of these from contents of substituting elements are discussed. Analyzing the results obtained simultaneously with the tendencies in oxygen content and critical temperature change we have confirmed the conclusion that the oxygen sublattice disordering has a determinant effect on band structure parameters and superconductive properties of YBa 2 Cu 3 O(y). The results obtained suggest that Ca gives rise to some peculiarities in band spectrum of this compound...|$|R

5|$|Portions of {{the country}} faced {{shortages}} of rice due to crop damage from Ernest, {{as well as from}} Cyclone Gafilo in the previous year.

A total of 12people lost their lives, mostly incidents indirectly related to the hurricane, and damage reached an estimated $100million.

5|$|Another {{improvement}} {{from the}} 12th century onwards {{was the creation}} of shell keeps, involving replacing the wooden keep on the motte with a circular stone wall. Buildings could be built around the inside of the shell, producing a small inner courtyard. Restormel Castle {{is a classic example of}} this development with a perfectly circular wall and a square entrance tower while the later Launceston Castle, although more ovoid than circular, is another good example of the design and one of the most formidable castles of the period. Round castles were unusually popular throughout Cornwall and Devon. Although the circular design held military advantages, these only really mattered in the 13th century onwards; the origins of 12th-century circular design were the circular design of the mottes; indeed, some designs <b>were</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> circular in order to accommodate irregular mottes, such as that at Windsor Castle.|$|E
5|$|As {{the only}} {{scientist}} {{among the five}} AEC commissioners, it fell to Libby to defend the Eisenhower administration's stance on atmospheric nuclear testing. He argued that the dangers of radiation from nuclear tests <b>were</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> that from chest X-rays, and therefore {{less important than the}} risk of having an inadequate nuclear arsenal, but his arguments failed to convince the scientific community or reassure the public. In January 1956, he publicly revealed the existence of Project Sunshine, a series of research studies to ascertain the impact of radioactive fallout on the world's population that he had initiated in 1953 while serving on the GAC. By 1958, even Libby and Teller were supporting limits on atmospheric nuclear testing.|$|E

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} static aerodynamic {{simulation model}} of the 8 by 8 by 20 ft MILVAN cargo container is determined by combining the wind tunnel data from a 1972 NASA Ames Research Center study taken over the restricted domain (0 <b>is</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> or equal to phi <b>is</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> or equal to 90 degrees; 0 <b>is</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> or equal to alpha <b>is</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> or equal to 45 degrees) with extrapolation relations derived from the geometric symmetry of rectangular boxes. It is found that the aerodynamics of any attitude can be defined from the aerodynamics at an equivalent attitude in the restricted domain (0 <b>is</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> phi <b>is</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 45 degrees; 0 <b>is</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> alpha <b>is</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 90 degrees). However, a similar comprehensive equivalence with the domain spanned by the data is not available; in particular, {{about two-thirds of the}} domain with the absolute value of alpha is greater than 45 degrees is unrelated to the data. Nevertheless, as estimate can be defined for this region consistent with the measured or theoretical values along its boundaries and the theoretical equivalence of points within the region. These descrepancies are assumed to be due to measurement errors. Data from independent wind tunnel studies are reviewed; these <b>are</b> <b>less</b> comprehensive <b>than</b> the NASA Ames Research Center but show good to fair agreement with both the theory and the estimate given here...|$|R
5|$|Herrerasaurus {{was fully}} bipedal. It had strong hind limbs with short thighs and rather long feet, {{indicating}} {{that it was}} likely a swift runner. The foot had five toes, but only the middle three (digits II, III, and IV) bore weight. The outer toes (I and V) were small; the first toe had a small claw. The tail, partially stiffened by overlapping vertebral projections, balanced the body and was also an adaptation for speed. The forelimbs of Herrerasaurus <b>were</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> half the length of its hind limbs. The upper arm and forearm were rather short, while the manus (hand) was elongated. The first two fingers and the thumb ended in curved, sharp claws for grasping prey. The fourth and fifth digits were small stubs without claws.|$|E
5|$|Thanks to his {{performance}} during the game, Air Force quarterback Chance Harridge became just the fifth player in Air Force {{history and the}} 16th player in NCAA Division I-A history to rush for 1,000yards and pass for 1,000yards in the same season. Despite that performance, Virginia Tech quarterback Bryan Randall was named the game's most valuable player for his winning effort. Randall finished the game having completed 18 of his 23passes for 177yards. Harridge completed four of his 19 passes for 91yards and twointerceptions. After completing a pass on the second play of the game, Harridge did not complete another pass until there <b>were</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> five minutes remaining in the game, throwing 11consecutive incomplete passes in the intervening period.|$|E
5|$|The main {{exporter}} of rhodium is South Africa (approximately 80% in 2010) followed by Russia. The annual world production is 30 tonnes. The price of rhodium is highly variable. In 2007, rhodium cost approximately eight {{times more than}} gold, 450 times more than silver, and 27,250 times more than copper by weight. In 2008, the price briefly rose above $10,000 per ounce ($350,000 per kilogram). The economic slowdown of the 3rd quarter of 2008 pushed rhodium prices sharply back below $1,000 per ounce ($35,000 per kilogram); the price rebounded to $2,750 by early 2010 ($97,000 per kilogram) (more than twice the gold price), but in late 2013, the prices <b>were</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> $1000.|$|E
