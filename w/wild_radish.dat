The caterpillar is green and well camouflaged. When full grown it is green above with black warts, from which arise whitish and blackish hairs. There is a darker line along the back and a yellow line low down on the sides. Underneath the colour is whitish-grey. The spiracular line is dusky but not conspicuous, and the spiracles are blackish surrounded with yellow. There is extensive overlap with other leaf-feeding larvae of large and small whites in some wild populations (e.g. in Morocco). It is often found feeding on the same plant as the orange tip but rarely competes for food because it usually feeds on the leaves whereas the orange tip caterpillar feeds on the flowers and developing seed pods. Like other Pieris species it overwinters as a pupa. This is green in colour, and the raised parts are yellowish and brown. This is the most frequent form, but it varies through yellowish to buff or greyish, and is sometimes without markings.|$|E
40|$|Since plant mating {{choices are}} {{flexible}} and {{responsive to the}} environment, rates of spontaneous hybridization may vary across ecological clines. Developing a robust and predictive framework for rates of plant gene flow requires assessing the role of environmental sensitivity on plant reproductive traits, relative abundance, and pollen vectors. Therefore, across a soil moisture gradient, we quantified pollinator movement, life-history trait variation, and unidirectional hybridization rates from crop (Raphanus sativus) to <b>wild</b> (Raphanus raphanistrum) <b>radish</b> populations. Both radish species were grown together in relatively dry (no rain), relatively wet (double rain), or control soil moisture conditions in Ohio, USA. We measured <b>wild</b> and crop <b>radish</b> life-history, phenology and pollinator visitation patterns. To quantify hybridization rates from crop-to-wild species, we used a simply inherited morphological marker to detect F 1 hybrid progeny. Although crop-to-wild hybridization {{did not respond to}} watering treatments, the abundance of hybrid offspring was higher in fruits produced late in the period of phenological overlap, when both species had roughly equal numbers of open flowers. Therefore, the timing of fruit production and its relationship to flowering overlap may be more important to hybrid zone formation in Raphanus spp. than soil moisture or pollen vector movements...|$|R

40|$|Knowledge of the {{pathways}} of colonization {{is critical for}} risk assessment and management of weeds. In this study we adopted a landscape genetics approach {{to assess the impact}} of human disturbances and large-scale environmental features on the colonization of a global agricultural weed, Raphanus raphanistrum. We used nuclear microsatellite and chloroplast DNA sequence data to quantify the pattern of genetic diversity in 336 plants collected from 13 sites throughout the Cape Floristic Region, South Africa, one of the world's recognized global biodiversity hotspots. The lack of strong spatial genetic structure suggests that R. raphanistrum colonized throughout the Cape Floristic Region via both local diffusive spread and long-distance jump dispersal. Furthermore, 47 % of analyzed plants contained Raphanus sativus (cultivated radish) chloroplast genomes, indicating historical and/or contemporary gene flow between <b>wild</b> and cultivated <b>radish</b> populations.

50|$|The Comanche were {{initially}} hunter-gatherers. When {{they lived in}} the Rocky Mountains, during their migration to the Great Plains, both men and women shared the responsibility of gathering and providing food. When the Comanche reached the plains, hunting came to predominate. Hunting was considered a male activity and was a principal source of prestige. For meat, the Comanche hunted buffalo, elk, black bear, pronghorn, and deer. When game was scarce, the men hunted wild mustangs, sometimes eating their own ponies. In later years the Comanche raided Texas ranches and stole longhorn cattle. They did not eat fish or fowl, unless starving, when they would eat virtually any creature they could catch, including armadillos, skunks, rats, lizards, frogs, and grasshoppers. Buffalo meat and other game was prepared and cooked by the women. The women also gathered wild fruits, seeds, nuts, berries, roots, and tubers — including plums, grapes, juniper berries, persimmons, mulberries, acorns, pecans, <b>wild</b> onions, <b>radishes,</b> and the fruit of the prickly pear cactus. The Comanche also acquired maize, dried pumpkin, and tobacco through trade and raids. Most meats were roasted over a fire or boiled. To boil fresh or dried meat and vegetables, women dug a pit in the ground, which they lined with animal skins or buffalo stomach and filled with water to make a kind of cooking pot. They placed heated stones in the water until it boiled and had cooked their stew. After they came into contact with the Spanish, the Comanche traded for copper pots and iron kettles, which made cooking easier.|$|R
50|$|Such pollinators {{are often}} called oligoleges or simply {{specialist}} pollinators, and this behavior is especially {{common in the}} bee families Andrenidae and Halictidae. Under the family Andrenidae is the species Macrotera portalis, in which observations have suggested it is oligolectic. Macrotera portalis is a communal, ground nesting bee that {{has been found to}} preferentially pollinate certain host flowers of the same species. Andrena agilissima is another oligolectic mining bee that prefers different types of <b>wild</b> mustard and <b>radish</b> plants. Attempts have been made to determine whether this narrow host preference is due to an inability of the bee larvae to digest and develop on a variety of pollen types, or a limitation of the adult bee's learning and perception (i.e., they simply do not recognize other flowers as potential food sources), and most of the available evidence suggests the latter. However, a few plants whose pollen contains toxic substances (e.g., Toxicoscordion and related genera in the Melanthieae) are visited by oligolectic bees, and these may fall into the former category.|$|R
40|$|When species hybridize, {{offspring}} typically exhibit reduced {{fitness and}} maladapted phenotypes. This situation has biosafety implications regarding the unintended spread of novel transgenes, and risk assessments of crop-wild hybrids often assume that poorly adapted hybrid progeny will not evolve adaptive phenotypes. We explored the evolutionary potential of early generation hybrids using nontransgenic <b>wild</b> and cultivated <b>radish</b> (Raphanus raphanistrum, Raphanus sativus) {{as a model}} system. We imposed four generations of selection for two weedy traits – early flowering or large size – and measured responses in a common garden in Michigan, USA. Under selection for early flowering, hybrids evolved to flower as early as wild lineages, which changed little. These early-flowering hybrids also recovered wild-type pollen fertility, suggesting a genetic correlation that could accelerate the loss of crop traits when a short life cycle is advantageous. Under selection for large size at reproduction, hybrids evolved longer leaves faster than wild lineages, a potentially advantageous phenotype under longer growing seasons. Although early generation hybrid offspring have reduced fitness, our findings provide novel support for rapid adaptation in crop-wild hybrid populations. Biosafety risk assessment programs should consider the possibility of rapid evolution of weedy traits from early generations of seemingly unfit crop-wild hybrids...|$|R

Nitrate concentration in samples, which were boiled with much water, decreased by boiling time. Statistically significant correlations were obtained between nitrate, nitrite contents and L*, a*, b * values...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{respective}} {{role and}} {{relative importance of}} natural selection and gene flow {{in the process of}} population divergence has been a central theme in the speciation literature. A previous study presented conclusive evidence that <b>wild</b> <b>radish</b> on Japanese islands comprises two genetically isolated lineages: the southern and northern groups. However, a general understanding of the lineage isolation with frequent seed flow of the coastal plant species is still unclear. We surveyed nucleotide polymorphisms over 14 nuclear loci in 72 individuals across the Japan-Ryukyu Islands Arc to address the demographic history of <b>wild</b> <b>radish</b> utilising the isolation-with-migration (IM) model. In addition, we investigated the flowering times of individuals in different <b>wild</b> <b>radish</b> lineages, with and without cold exposure, to assess their respective vernalisation responses. Results: Coalescent simulations suggested that divergence between the southern and northern lineages of <b>wild</b> <b>radish</b> began ∼ 18, 000 years ago, initially during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) period. The gene flow from the southern to northern groups was considerably higher than that in the opposite direction, indicating effective dispersal of viable seeds via the northward Kuroshio Current. Our greenhouse experiments indicated that cold exposure was not required for flowering in the southern group, but could advance the date of flowering, suggesting that vernalisation would be facultative in the southern group. In contrast, the northern group was either unable to flower or flowered later without prior cold exposure, and thus had an obligate requirement for cold treatment. Conclusions: The south-north lineage divergence in <b>wild</b> <b>radish</b> could be triggered by a directional change in the sea current during the ice age, despite gene flow due to the high dispersability and longevity of seeds. We also found that temperature profoundly affected the vernalisation responses of <b>wild</b> <b>radish,</b> which may repress reproductive success and ultimately drive and reinforce intra-specific differentiation between the two lineages of <b>wild</b> <b>radish.</b> This study provides new insights into the maintenance of lineage differentiation with on-going gene flow in coastal plants...|$|E
