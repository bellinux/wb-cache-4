50|$|The <b>worsted</b> <b>count</b> {{was only}} a rough {{measurement}} and {{has been replaced by}} more exact methods such as the metric yarn count. However, for fine wool, the memory of the older system survives in the S numbers which have a very rough correspondence to <b>worsted</b> <b>count.</b> In other words, fiber that yielded about 80 worsted hanks is roughly comparable to fiber designated as 80s using the S numbers. The critical difference is that while the worsted number was an indirect measure (and a rough one at that) of yarn thickness, the S number is a direct (and precise) measurement of the thickness of the fiber. The S number of fiber, and hence of yarn, fabric, or garments made of that fiber, is determined using the international standard promulgated by the International Wool Textile Organisation (IWTO).|$|E
50|$|<b>Worsted</b> <b>count</b> (or {{spinning}} count) is {{an indirect}} {{measure of the}} fineness of the fiber in a worsted wool yarn expressed {{as the number of}} 560-yard (512 m) lengths (hanks) of worsted yarn that a pound (0.45 kg) of wool yields. The finer the wool, the more yarn and the higher the count. It has been largely replaced by direct measures.|$|E
50|$|The S numbers {{originated}} in England, where the worsted spinning process was invented and {{arose from the}} worsted yarn count system for stating the fineness of yarn. The <b>worsted</b> <b>count</b> (also known as the Bradford count) {{was the number of}} 560 yard m lengths (hanks) of worsted yarn that 1 lb of wool yields. The finer the wool, the more yarn and the higher the count.|$|E
50|$|The Bradford system (also {{known as}} the English <b>Worsted</b> Yarn <b>Count</b> System or {{spinning}} count or Bradford count) {{is a way to}} assess the quality of wool.|$|R
50|$|The {{linear density}} of a fiber is {{commonly}} measured in units of denier or tex. Traditional units include <b>worsted</b> <b>count,</b> cotton count and yield. Tex {{is more likely}} to be used in Canada and Continental Europe, while denier remains more common in the United States and United Kingdom. The International System of Units uses kilogram per metre for linear densities; in some contexts, the tex unit is used instead.|$|E
5000|$|A fiber, {{a single}} {{filament}} of natural material, such as cotton, linen or wool, or artificial material such as nylon, polyester, metal or mineral fiber, or man-made cellulosic fibre like viscose, Modal, Lyocell or other rayon fiber {{is measured in}} terms of linear mass density, the weight of a given length of fiber. Various units are used to refer to the measurement of a fiber, such as: the denier and tex (linear mass density of fibers), super S (fineness of wool fiber), <b>worsted</b> <b>count,</b> woolen count, cotton count (or Number English (Ne)), Number metric (Nm) and yield (the reciprocal of denier and tex).|$|E
