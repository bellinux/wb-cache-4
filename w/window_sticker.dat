2500|$|The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) {{certified}} the Mini E {{range as}} , with a city/highway combined energy consumption of 34kW·h/100miles. Under its five-cycle testing, EPA rated the Mini E at 98 {{miles per gallon}} gasoline equivalent (...) combined fuel economy, with a rating of [...] equivalent in city driving and [...] equivalent on highways.

2500|$|In March 2007, Tesla {{reported}} the Roadster's efficiency on the EPA highway cycle as [...] "135 mpg [...] equivalent, per the conversion rate {{used by the}} EPA" [...] or 133W·h/km (21.5kW·h/100mi) battery-to-wheel and 155W·h/km (24.9kW·h/100mi) plug-to-wheel. The official U.S. <b>window</b> <b>sticker</b> of the 2009 Tesla Roadster showed an EPA rated energy consumption of 32kW-hrs/100mi in city and 33kW-hrs/100mi on the highway, equivalent to 105 mpg city and 102 mpg highway. The EPA rating for on board energy efficiency for electric vehicles before 2010 was expressed as kilowatt-hour per 100 miles (kW-hrs/100mi). Since November 2010, {{with the introduction of}} the Nissan Leaf and the Chevrolet Volt, EPA began using a new metric, miles per gallon gasoline equivalent (MPGe). The Roadster was never officially rated by the EPA in MPGe.|$|E

50|$|Fuel economy {{estimates}} for <b>window</b> <b>stickers</b> and CAFE standard compliance are different. The EPA MPGe rating {{shown in the}} Monroney label {{is based on the}} consumption of the on-board energy content stored in the fuel tank or in the vehicle's battery, or any other energy source, and only represents the tank-to-wheel energy consumption. CAFE estimates are based on a well-to-wheel basis {{and in the case of}} liquid fuels and electric drive vehicles also account for the energy consumed upstream to produce the fuel or electricity and deliver it to the vehicle. Fuel economy for CAFE purposes include an incentive adjustment for alternative fuel vehicles and plug-in electric vehicles which results in higher MPGe than those estimated for <b>window</b> <b>stickers.</b>|$|R
2500|$|These cars came {{packaged}} with {{an additional}} cost optional visibility group, light group, insulation group, protection group, and sports-style steering wheel, but also received {{at no additional cost}} (but valued at $167.45) three other featureslarge [...] "Javelin Winner Trans Am Championship 1971-1972 SCCA" [...] fender decals on the lower portion behind the front wheel openings, 8-slot rally styled steel wheels with E70X14 Polyglass raised while letter tires and a [...] "Space-Saver" [...] spare tire. The Trans Am Victory cars were also typically pre-built even more [...] "heavily optioned than regular production Javelins." [...] American Motors designed a quick identification system of its models by an information-rich Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) system. However, because this was only a limited promotional [...] "value added" [...] marketing campaign, except as noted on the original <b>window</b> <b>sticker,</b> there is no VIN or door tag code to distinguish an authentic Trans Am-Victory edition car.|$|E
2500|$|The 1988 Fiero {{brought a}} new {{suspension}} design, thought by many to have {{a striking resemblance to}} those designed by Lotus, which at the time, was about to be acquired by General Motors. The suspension was never a Lotus design though; it was the suspension the Pontiac engineers had designed in the beginning, along with what they learned from the racing program. Up front were revised control arms and knuckles that reduced steering effort and improved the scrub radius. In the back, the old Citation parts were replaced with a real tri-link suspension with all new knuckles. This new suspension came with staggered wheel sizes on WS6 suspension equipped models, with [...] by [...] wide wheels up front and [...] by [...] wide wheels in the rear for improved handling balance and to offset the slightly increased front track that resulted from the improvements. Topping off the package were the new vented disc brakes at all four corners, which addressed braking complaints of road testers. A variable effort electro-hydraulic power steering unit, the same design later found on the GM EV1, was also to be a late addition. This option never made it to production — one reason cited is that models with the prototype power steering were noted as being too loud. The four-cylinder engine received an in-pan oil filter element and balance shaft. A [...] "Formula" [...] option was added, which offered many of the GT features with the standard coupe body, including the [...] speedometer, WS6 Suspension (which includes offset crosslace wheels) and the rear spoiler. 1988 marked the end of production for the Fiero, and is also considered to be the best Fiero produced. Improvements to suspension, brakes, steering, and improvements to both the four-cylinder and V6 engines took the car to a level far beyond the 1984 model that had received much criticism. 1988 was also the only year a yellow exterior color was available as a factory option. During the Fiero's final model year (on August 16, 1988) the last <b>window</b> <b>sticker</b> was placed on the last Fiero to roll off the Pontiac, Michigan plant line. The 1988 Fiero is the most desired by automotive collectors because of the improvements made to the 1988 model year, and this being the last year of production. The 1988 Mera seen as the most sought after model and tops the Fiero list in resale value this model is commonly used to create [...] "kit cars" [...] (replicas of high end sports cars).|$|E
