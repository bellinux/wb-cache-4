5|$|The {{localization}} of {{the first}} game was outsourced to Bowne Global, and was handled by the writer Alexander O. Smith and the editor Steve Anderson. While the Japanese version takes place in Japan, the localized version {{is set in the}} United States: because one of the episodes involves time zones, they had to specify where the game takes place, and chose the United States <b>without</b> <b>thinking</b> a lot about it. The Japanese justice system of the original still remained intact in the localization, as changing it would have altered the entire game structure.|$|E
5|$|To be an {{automatic}} process, the effect should, like other automatic processes involving preferences, {{be influenced by}} deliberate thought. Multiple {{studies have shown that}} thinking about feelings inhibits automatic responding. Koole, Dijksterhuis, and van Knippenberg had subjects give their preferences for letters and numbers 1 to 50. They made half of them explain their preferences. They found a name-letter effect and birthday-number effect in those subjects asked to answer <b>without</b> <b>thinking,</b> but no effects in those asked to think. This points to the effect being the result of {{an automatic}} process.|$|E
5|$|Chizuru, nicknamed Chii-chan, {{is a tall}} {{girl who}} first appears as a classmate of Shuichi when they both enter junior high school. She is Momoko's {{childhood}} friend, and has a stylish demeanor, highlighted by her stature and long hair, which captivates both Shuichi and Yoshino when they first meet her. Chizuru {{is described as a}} free spirit, someone who enjoys doing unconventional, often outrageous things which surprise those around her; she frequently acts <b>without</b> <b>thinking,</b> and as a result projects a childish personality. Her impulsive behavior sometimes gets her in trouble with other characters, but she quickly becomes ashamed when she realizes the consequences. She tries to be everyone's friend, though Saori strongly dislikes her impulsiveness. Chizuru joins the girls' basketball team in junior high. Her family runs a soba restaurant.|$|E

5|$|For example, {{take the}} fictitious pair Irma Maes and Jef Jacobs {{as shown in}} the table. The first {{stimulus}} is A and U: the last letter of Irma's first name and a letter not in her name. The next stimulus is M and D: the penultimate letter from Irma's first name and a letter not part of her name. As {{can be seen in the}} table this is repeated for the remaining letters of Irma's first name. The letters of her last name then also appear in reverse order, and finally the letters of both of Jef's names. The shading in the table reveals the pattern hidden to subjects, who would have been told to circle their preferred letter of each pair as fast as possible <b>without</b> <b>thinking.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{localization}} of {{the game}} was outsourced to a company called Bowne Global, and was handled by writer Alexander O. Smith, who was {{not familiar with the}} Ace Attorney series prior to working on it, and editor Steve Anderson. While the Japanese version {{of the game}} takes place in Japan, the localized version is set in the United States. They would normally have left the setting vague while adapting cultural differences that the target audience would not understand, but because one of the episodes involves time zones, they had to specify where the game takes place, and chose the United States <b>without</b> <b>thinking</b> a lot about it. This became an issue in later games, where the Japanese setting was more obvious. All the voice roles in the localized version of the game were handled by localization staff; Takumi had wanted to do the English voice for Phoenix, but it was handled by Ben Judd.|$|E

25|$|Blink: The Power of Thinking <b>Without</b> <b>Thinking</b> (2005) is Malcolm Gladwell's second book. It {{presents}} {{in popular}} science format research from psychology and behavioral economics on the adaptive unconscious: mental processes that work rapidly and automatically from relatively little information.

25|$|The Turing test is {{concerned}} strictly {{with how the}} subject acts– the external behaviour of the machine.

25|$|During most dreams, {{the person}} dreaming is {{not aware that}} they are dreaming, no matter how absurd or {{eccentric}} the dream is. The reason for this {{may be that the}} prefrontal cortex, the region of the brain responsible for logic and planning, exhibits decreased activity during dreams. This allows the dreamer to more actively interact with the dream <b>without</b> <b>thinking</b> about what might happen, since things that would normally stand out in reality blend in with the dream scenery.|$|E

He's not only difficult stylistically, but also philosophically.

25|$|According to Allameh Muzaffar, Allah gives humans {{the faculty}} of reason and argument. Also, Allah orders humans to spend time {{thinking}} carefully on creation while he refers to all creations as his signs of power and glory. These signs encompass all of the universe. Furthermore, there is a similarity between humans as the little world and the universe as the large world. Allah does not accept the faith of those who follow him <b>without</b> <b>thinking</b> and only with imitation, but also Allah blames them for such actions.|$|E
25|$|A taunt is {{a battle}} cry, a method in hand-to-hand combat, sarcastic remark, or insult {{intended}} to demoralise the recipient, or to anger them and encourage reactionary behaviours <b>without</b> <b>thinking.</b> Taunting can exist {{as a form of}} social competition to gain control of the target's cultural capital (i.e. status). In sociological theory, the control of the three social capitals is used to produce an advantage in the social hierarchy as to enforce one's own position in relation to others. Taunting is committed by either directly bullying, or indirectly encouraging others to bully the target. It is also possible to give a response of the same kind, to ensure one's own status. It can be compared to fighting words and trash-talk.|$|E

25|$|To begin, affective {{emotions}} {{and the effect}} infidelity has on affective jealousy. Both {{men and women alike}} feel some kind of jealousy when they suspect their significant other is being unfaithful (Johnson, 2017). If some individual suspects {{that he or she is}} being cheated on they begin to question their partners actions and may possibly act in more frustrated ways towards them than they normally would. For example, they may ask more questions about the whereabouts of their partner or get upset more frequently and more often whenever they feel that their partner is lying or going out without them. Bursts of frustration <b>without</b> <b>thinking</b> it through or realizing why an individual is having those emotions can be an affective response in a difficult situation. The affective use of jealousy in a seemingly unfaithful relationship is caused by the accusing partner anticipating the infidelity from the other.|$|E
25|$|It is not {{possible}} to speak of St Boswells village <b>without</b> <b>thinking</b> of the river which bends and twists on its swift flowing course north of the village. Famous for its salmon and brown trout it has given satisfaction to anglers over the years. Many of the local houses were built of stones from the river bed. The riverside walks are at all times pleasant and sometimes spectacular. Walkers on St Cuthbert's Way through the village on pilgrimage from Melrose to Lindisfarne see the same view of the Eildon Hills as was seen by such men as Modan who established a religious cell at Dryburgh; Aidan who brought twelve young monks from Lindisfarne to Old Melrose as missionaries; Cuthbert who became prior and bishop and Boisil who, after a life of holiness and healing gave his name to the village and parish of St Boswells.|$|E
25|$|Yamaguchi saw Close Range Love as a classic-style love film, {{and wrote}} the song while {{considering}} the film's younger audience, who had no previous listening experience of the band. The first draft of the song followed the film's themes closely, which Yamaguchi found too simplistic, and made him unsure how to properly write a song for a romance film. The band decided to create a song <b>without</b> <b>thinking</b> of its use in the film, instead making a composition that felt natural {{in terms of their}} own musical style, and hoped the result would naturally match the film. Yamaguchi found that this technique worked well for the melody, however he found that writing lyrics entirely independent of the song was too difficult. Over time, he grew to be bored of the song's melody, and decided to change it during the late stages of creating the song. After doing this, he found the song's lyrics came easily to him.|$|E
