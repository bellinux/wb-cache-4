60|$|I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> that if I {{could do}} {{anything}} at all, she had only to command.|$|E
60|$|Philip moved {{a little}} uneasily in his place. Some {{instinct}} told him, however, how greatly she desired his silence--that she <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> story her own way.|$|E
60|$|It {{surprised}} her, {{when it was}} over. She was shrinking and afraid. To {{what was}} she now exposed? She half <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> husband. Yet she shrank from him.|$|E
5000|$|Left Behind: Sarah's father's fiancee is horrible! She <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> friends but Annie has {{scared her}} into keeping silent.|$|R
60|$|Festing did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> {{about the}} fight with Wilkinson. He had {{resolved}} {{to say nothing}} about the matter until morning.|$|R
50|$|Cutting away, Claudio is seen {{standing}} over a sleeping Newo. He <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> what that has happened, but {{realizes that the}} information will only endanger her.|$|R
60|$|Korak {{wanted her}} to say something. He <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> how he loved her; but the emotion of his love choked him and the {{vocabulary}} of the Mangani was limited.|$|E
60|$|But now Olive {{had written}} that she <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> {{a lot of}} things which could not go into a letter, and so the Broadstone {{carriage}} stopped again at the toll-gate.|$|E
60|$|Somehow she {{saw through}} me, knew I {{was not just}} what I pretended to be. But she never breathed her conviction. She championed me. I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> the truth about myself because I {{believed}} the doubt of me alone {{stood in the way}} of my winning her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Only!" [...] {{repeated}} the choking captain. [...] "Only! Only told Rosa! Where was the town-crier? What {{in the name}} of common-sense did you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> for?" ...|$|R
60|$|OCTAVIUS. I <b>want</b> you <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> {{sincerely}} and earnestly {{what you}} think about me. I <b>want</b> you <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> that you can trust her to me--that is, if you feel you can.|$|R
25|$|A {{fugitive}} hides on {{a deserted}} island somewhere in Polynesia. Tourists arrive, and {{his fear of}} being discovered becomes a mixed emotion when he {{falls in love with}} one of them. He <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> his feelings, but an anomalous phenomenon keeps them apart.|$|R
60|$|He {{looked at}} her, but {{could think of}} nothing to say; he racked his brains anxiously, seeking for a remark which should keep her by him; he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> how much she meant to him; but {{he did not know how}} to make love now that he loved in earnest.|$|E
6000|$|Then came a {{pause and}} Kipps' soul surged within him. He <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> {{he was leaving}} and would never see her again. He could find neither words nor voice to say it. The swift seconds passed. The girl in the ribbons was handing Mrs. Walshingham her change. [...] "Well," [...] said Miss Walshingham, [...] "Good-bye," [...] and gave him her hand again.|$|E
6000|$|Aunt Patsy gave a sagacious nod of her head. [...] "I reckon {{you thought}} she'd be right much disgruntled when she heered you was mar'ed, an' you <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> youse'f. But I's pow'ful glad dat it's all right now. You all don' know how pow'ful glad I is." [...] And {{she looked at}} Mr Croft and Miss Annie with a glance as benignant as her time-set countenance was capable of.|$|E
60|$|LUCREZIA. Vicomte, Miss Toomis <b>wants</b> you <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> {{all about}} Correggio.|$|R
60|$|Why had {{she left}} Sabbath-school? Why? Oh, yes. What did he (McSnagley) <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> she was wicked for? What did he <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> that God hated her for? If God hated her, {{what did she}} <b>want</b> <b>to</b> go to Sabbath school for? She didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be beholden to anybody who hated her.|$|R
50|$|Irina's {{mother did}} not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> {{daughter}} {{that her father had}} died, so made up a story that he was a Chilean revolutionary. The young Ira believed the story and was proud of who she believed her father to be, with this influence going onto later see her band named 'Chi-li'.|$|R
6000|$|Fern <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> grievances; Carol was sulky {{every time}} she thought of [...] "The Girl from Kankakee"; it was Erik who made suggestions. He had read with astounding breadth, and astounding lack of judgment. His voice was {{sensitive}} to liquids, but he overused the word [...] "glorious." [...] He mispronounced {{a tenth of the}} words he had from books, but he knew it. He was insistent, but he was shy.|$|E
60|$|In the meantime, Lister was {{conscious}} {{that he had}} been rash. Shillito was muscular and fresh, but he was tired. It was plain he could not keep it up for long. Moreover, unless the fight soon ended, people would come to see what the disturbance was about. This would be awkward for Barbara; he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> to go away, but could not. He was breathless and Shillito was trying to choke him.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{really wanted}} to tell only--YOU, Miss Carter," [...] stammered Barker. [...] "You see--" [...] he hesitated. But Miss Kitty saw perfectly. He <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>HER,</b> and, seeing her, he asked for HER FATHER! Not that it made the {{slightest}} difference to her, for her father would have been sure to have told her. It was also kind of her father to invite him to luncheon. Otherwise {{she might not have}} seen him before he left Boomville.|$|E
6000|$|... 'But seriously, Jo, I do love Alice, and I {{think she}} knows it. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> so; but I lose my head when I try, and don't care {{to make a}} fool of myself. Thought you might suggest some pretty way; you read so much poetry and are so romantic.' ...|$|R
50|$|After sometime, Jean looks {{again for}} Laura. He finally <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> {{that he loves}} her but she has {{overcome}} her turbulent relationship with him. Making peace with herself, Laura has a new boyfriend. Jean and Laura have a short conversation, they kiss tenderly and part ways. Jean finally finds peace with his HIV status and with his life.|$|R
50|$|Father Connolly arrives to {{administer}} the last rites. Granny feels she does not need the priest. She made her peace with God long ago. As she senses her time running out, she thinks {{of all the things}} she <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> children, who have assembled to say their goodbyes. She thinks of Hapsy and wonders if she will see her again.|$|R
6000|$|The {{little girl}} {{began to get}} frightened, keeping the secret all to [...] herself; she <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> mother, but she didn't dare to; and [...] she was ashamed to ask the Fairy to take back her gift, it seemed [...] ungrateful and ill-bred, and {{she thought she would}} try to stand it, [...] but she hardly knew how she could, for a whole year. So it went on and [...] on, and it was Christmas on St. Valentine's Day and Washington's [...] Birthday, just the same as any day, and it didn't skip even the First [...] of April, though {{everything}} was counterfeit that day, and that was [...] some little relief.|$|E
60|$|She {{wanted a}} son. She felt, a son would be everything. She <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> husband. But {{it was such}} a trembling, {{intimate}} thing to tell him, and he was at this time hard and unresponsive. So that she went away and wept. It was such a waste of a beautiful opportunity, such a frost that nipped in the bud one of the beautiful moments of her life. She went about heavy and tremulous with her secret, wanting to touch him, oh, most delicately, and see his face, dark and sensitive, attend to her news. She waited and waited for him to become gentle and still towards her. But he was always harsh and he bullied her.|$|E
60|$|He rather <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her,</b> too, {{for he was}} a good-natured brother, {{and would}} have liked to have given her the amount of {{pleasure}} the confidence would have produced; but then he reflected with dismay on the number of women in his parish with whom Miss Emily was on tea-drinking terms,--he thought of the wondrous solvent powers of that beverage in whose amber depths so many resolutions yea, and solemn vows, of utter silence have been dissolved like Cleopatra's pearls. He knew that an infusion of his secret would steam up from every cup of tea Emily should drink for six months to come, till gradually every particle would be dissolved and float in the air of common fame. No; it would not do.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Don't, don't! You trample on {{the most}} sacred feelings, Snob. I want {{something}} wild and tender,--like Byron. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> that amongst the festive balls, {{and that sort of}} thing, you know--I only think about her, you know--that I scorn the world, and am weary of it, you know, and--something about a gazelle, and a bulbul, you know.' ...|$|R
50|$|Elena {{wonders why}} {{all her friends}} are at the Ball and asks Alaric {{what is going on}} but he does not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her.</b> He {{eventually}} does when she says that she will go to the Ball and Alaric has to stop her. Elena says she will stay home but she sneaks out telling Alaric and Jenna that she is going to sleep.|$|R
5000|$|Driving, he {{encounters}} Fenchurch again, {{and gives}} her a lift to the train station, saying that he has something he <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her.</b> At the station pub they attempt to engage in conversation, but are interrupted by someone offering raffle tickets. Fenchurch has to leave to catch her train, and leaves her phone number on a ticket [...] - [...] with which Arthur then wins the raffle.|$|R
60|$|And {{there is}} another thing I must tell you. One day when I was sitting by myself on The Slopes waiting for Jone, about lunch time, and with a reminiscence {{floating}} through my mind of the Devonshire clotted cream of the past, never perhaps to return, I saw an elderly woman coming along, {{and when she got}} near she stopped and spoke. I knew her in an instant. She was the old body we met at the Babylon Hotel, who told us about the cottage at Chedcombe. I asked her to sit down beside me and talk, because I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> what good times we had had, and how we liked the place, but she said she couldn't, as she was obliged to go on.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Brinkley {{believed}} {{that this was the}} mere frenzy of sentimentality, the exaltation of a selfish asceticism; but at the break in the girl's voice and the aversion of her face she could not help a thrill of motherly tenderness for her. She <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> she was an unconscious humbug, bent now as always on her own advantage, and really indifferent to others she also wanted to comfort her, and tell her that she exaggerated, and was not to blame. She did neither, but when Alice turned her face back she seemed encouraged by Mrs. Brinkley's look to go on: [...] "I didn't appreciate her then; she was very generous and high-minded--too high-minded for me to understand, even. But we don't seem to know how good others are till we wrong them." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{intended}} to make herself an audience of one, and to listen {{in a way she}} knew would please him to the recital of his travels and experiences. Of these he had often essayed to talk to her, but she had not encouraged him. She never liked to talk upon subjects of which other people knew more than she did, and she always endeavored to bring the conversation into a channel where she could take an equal part. If she could lead, so much the better. But now she was going to let Mr. Tippengray talk to her just as much as he pleased, and tell her all he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her.</b> She now knew him better than she had done before, and she had strong hopes that by this new string {{she would be able to}} lead him from the Squirrel Inn to Lethbury whenever she chose.|$|E
5000|$|Brody {{attempts}} {{to apologize to}} Jessica (Morena Baccarin) for his actions but Jessica demands an explanation. Brody says he <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her,</b> but he can't. Jessica gives him an ultimatum: <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> [...] "something true" [...] about what he's been up to, or sleep somewhere else. Brody just walks away. Quinn's team is {{able to get a}} feed to the security cameras at the Ashford Hotel where Brody ends up staying.|$|R
6000|$|... 'She {{sent for}} me. We live quite close, you know. She <b>wanted</b> {{somebody}} <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> something. I must {{go up to}} her again now.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Lily {{is going}} to be the flower girl at the wedding and Cam and Mitch open her dress box. The blue dress, which lights up, is not as good as they expected. Out of nowhere, Lily says the [...] "f-word", causing Cam to giggle and leave the room. Mitch <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> that it is a bad word but Cam {{suggests}} that they have to not pay any attention to it because she will keep saying it.|$|R
