5|$|As study {{caught up}} to the wealth of new {{material}} from western North America, and venues for depictions proliferated, dinosaurs gained in popularity. The paintings of Charles R. Knight were the first influential representations of these finds. Knight worked extensively with the American Museum of Natural History and its director, Henry Fairfield Osborn, who <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> dinosaurs and other prehistoric animals to promote his museum and his ideas on evolution.|$|E
5|$|Cooper {{had said}} that he thought of King Kong after he had a dream that a giant gorilla was terrorizing New York City. When he woke, he {{recorded}} the idea and used it for the film.

5|$|In {{the early}} 1920s, {{national}} flag discussions gained prominence across most British dominions following {{the peace treaty}} between Britain and Ireland. In November 1920, the Indian delegation to the League of Nations <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> an Indian flag, and this prompted the British Indian government to place renewed emphasis on the flag as a national symbol.|$|E
5|$|On October 11, 2010, Rhys Ifans was {{confirmed}} {{to be the}} unnamed villain, and two days later his character was revealed to be Dr. Curt Connors / The Lizard. Arad said that Lizard is his favorite Spider-Man villain, and he had long <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> him in a film. Well before the choice of villain, Arad had had conceptual drawings prepared for the character.|$|E
5|$|The NGS deemed {{this gun}} {{obsolete}} {{shortly after the}} first ships were laid down, but the gun that it <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>use,</b> the Canon de 138 mm modèle 1923, was not yet available, so they planned to replace the 130mm guns later. The guns and their larger hoists were ordered well before any of the ships were completed {{and had to be}} written off when it became apparent that the ships' stability was too marginal to tolerate the additional top weight.|$|E

50|$|After {{the toll}} ring was closed in 2005 some politicians, {{environmental}} advocates {{and others have}} suggested reintroducing the toll ring.

5|$|As {{a result}} of the inspection, Sir Francis Flemming, the Lieutenant-General of the Ordnance, was tasked in February 1558 to improve the defences on the islands, {{supported}} by a shipment of lead to help with construction, and money raised from the dissolution of the monasteries in England. The building work initially focused on the island of Tresco and was carried out under the direction of John Killigrew, the captain of Pendennis Castle in Falmouth. Tresco was in need of modern defences, but Killigrew also <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the work programme to increase his political influence on the island.|$|E

5|$|Between 1994 and 1998, {{there was}} local {{political}} debate about how Rikshospitalet, that {{was moving to}} Gaustad, should be served by public transport. The state wanted to extend the Ullevål Hageby Line of the tramway to the new hospital, while many local politicians <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the rapid transit. Since the Ring Line would increase traffic on the Songsvann Line, moving the line was considered to better serve the hospital. In 1998, an agreement was reached whereby the light rail line would be built, and a new station for transfer from the metro would open at Forskningsparken.|$|E

5|$|Dąbrowski, meanwhile, {{spent the}} first few years of the new century as a general in the service of the Italian republic. In 1804 he {{received}} the Officer cross of Legion of Honour, and the next year, the Italian Order of the Iron Crown. Together with Józef Wybicki he was summoned again by Napoleon in fall of 1806 and tasked with recreating the Polish formation, which Napoleon <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> to recapture Greater Poland from Prussia. The ensuing conflict was known as the Greater Poland Uprising, and Dabrowski was the chief leader of Polish insurgent forces in it. Dąbrowski distinguished himself at siege of Tczew, siege of Gdańsk and at Battle of Friedland.|$|E

An agreement was never met and Caron, along with a large number of artists loyal to him, departed. This stalled plans that year to start a new touring show.|$|E
5|$|In April 1889, a {{resolution}} was passed for Millwall to drop 'Rovers' from their name {{and they were}} now playing under the name Millwall Athletic, inspired by their move to their new home The Athletic Grounds. They were founding members of the Southern Football League which they won {{for the first two}} years of its existence, and were runners-up in its third. They were forced to move to a new ground North Greenwich in 1901, as the Millwall Dock Company <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> their land as a timberyard. Millwall Athletic reached the FA Cup semi-finals in 1900 and 1903, and were also champions of the Western Football League in 1908 and 1909.|$|E

5|$|In early 1988, Butthole Surfers {{were ready}} to record a new album and <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> a modern studio for the first time, {{choosing}} a state-of-the-art facility in Texas. The following sessions took only one week, as the band had been performing most of the material for years. The band opted to follow this album's blueprint on future projects. In contrast, songs on their earlier recordings had undergone far more in-studio development and experimentation. Pinkus has expressed the opinion that the later, better-organized sessions stifled much of the spontaneous creativity that had propelled their earlier releases.|$|E
5|$|Ip Mans {{original}} title was controversial. It was disputed when film director Wong Kar-wai {{announced plans to}} make his own Ip Man film with Tony Leung Chiu-wai while filming 2046. Wong had planned his own Ip Man biopic titled The Great Master (一代宗师), with Leung playing the role of Ip. Wong's film, however, had been in development hell, having been announced several years earlier. Producer Raymond Wong wanted to name his film Grandmaster Yip Man, which bore a resemblance to the title Wong Kar-wai <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> for his film.|$|E
5|$|Notably, {{the comic}} strip stories' {{holographic}} characters, predominately Rimmer, were drawn in grayscale.

Despite achieving circulation figures of over 40,000 per month, the magazine's publisher decided to close the title down to concentrate on their other publications. A farewell issue was published, cover dated January 1994, and featured the remaining interviews, features, and comic strips that were to feature in the following issues.|$|E
