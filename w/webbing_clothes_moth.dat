50|$|Tineola bisselliella, {{known as}} the common clothes moth, <b>webbing</b> <b>clothes</b> <b>moth,</b> or simply {{clothing}} moth, is a species of fungus moth (family Tineidae, subfamily Tineinae). It is the type species of its genus Tineola. The specific name is commonly misspelled biselliella - for example by G. A. W. Herrich-Schäffer, when he established Tineola in 1853.|$|E
40|$|Adapted and {{effective}} pest management {{strategies for the}} protection of irreplaceable culture heritage {{as well as for the}} prevention of damages in households and warehouses are based on reliable information about the presence and distribution of the pest organisms.

The results demonstrate a seasonal abundance in the city and a missing of this species in the countryside. Data suggest a synanthropic occurrence of the <b>webbing</b> <b>clothes</b> <b>moth</b> rather than an invasion from natural reservoires.

30|$|The catch {{rate for}} some {{individual}} species {{is shown in}} Figures  3 c- 3 h, and here we see apparent differences in the regional distribution of insects (p[*]<[*] 0.001 for each figure, Chi-squared test DoF[*]=[*] 4). London for example shows a high frequency of silverfish, woolly bear larvae and <b>webbing</b> <b>clothes</b> <b>moths</b> compared with other territories. A high frequency of furniture beetles is notable in the Southeast and West, but to some extent these are driven by its prevalence in the Annexe and Casemate Tunnels (in the Southeast) and Atcham stores (under closure) in the West. In general the beetle is only found at 1.7 % occupancy {{in relation to the}} number of traps throughout the record, although at just over 3 % the Southeast and the West (p[*]=[*] 0.02, Mann–Whitney U test), but in the Tunnels and Atcham stores it is at 5.1 % and 5.2 % respectively (significant difference between these sites and the Southeast and the West territories; p[*]=[*] 0.04, Mann–Whitney U test). The wood weevils (Pentarthrum and Euophryum), show similar patterns to the furniture beetle, with highest catch rates in the southeast (0.053) and the west (0.028). Plaster beetles (Lathridiidae), as discussed below, are frequent in the Southeast.|$|R

40|$|The <b>webbing</b> <b>clothes</b> <b>moth</b> Tineola bisselliela, {{assumed to}} {{original}} derive from Afrika (Zeller, 1852), is a cosmopolitan pest in households, warehouses and on culture heritage (Key & Common, 1959; Querner, 2014). To organize and develop {{strategies for the}} identification, prevention and control of stored product and culture heritage pest organism {{in the manner of}} Integrated Pest Management (IPM), a precise knowledge of the biology, ecology and physiology of the pest organism is needed. Based on the observations by Titschak (1925) on the development of T. bisselliella under different temperatures and relative humidities, this work shows the quantification of moth eclosion under three conditions of temperature and relative humidity compared in control and interspecific competition with the furniture carpet beetle (Anthrenus flavipes) from the same feeding guild. The overall competition of the <b>webbing</b> <b>clothes</b> <b>moth</b> demonstrates her success as a culture heritage pest organism. Monitoring T. bisselliella at differnt outdoor stations in the broader area of Berlin leads to the absence of an occurrence in natural habitats. Molecular analysis of mitochondrial sequences as well as BOX-PCR patters demonstrate no population fragmentation into the trapping locations. Nonetheless a quite good network from passiv distribution by human being can also results in a continious geneflow...|$|E
40|$|Mosquitoes hear wingbeat sounds with antennal Johnston’s organs. In males, their {{sensitivity}} {{is thought}} to be enhanced by long fibrils on the antennae; males of many species erect these fibrils before they swarm with females. I investigated the anatomy and acoustic properties of antennae of male and female Aedes togoi, a species whose males erect these long fibrils before swarming. Many moths also hear, but several species that communicate with wingbeat sound have no tympanal organs, sensitive ears thought to have evolved in moths to detect the ultrasonic echolocation of bats. I therefore investigated potential ears in three species known to use sounds, tympanate Indianmeal moths, Plodia interpunctella (IMM) and atympanate peach twig borers, Anarsia lineatella (PTB), and <b>webbing</b> <b>clothes</b> <b>moths,</b> Tineola bisselliella (WCM). These investigations used microscopy, laser vibrometry and electrophysiology. Male and female A. togoi antennae vibrate best at 385 and 252 Hz, respectively, males near the female wingbeat frequency (wbf) of 306 Hz; females are unlikely to hear male wbfs of 523 Hz. In contrast, both sexes of IMM had wbfs near 50 Hz, with associated synchronous ultrasonic clicks spanning 25 - 80 kHz. Male tympana vibrated best at 90 kHz, females at 70 kHz, whereas the antennae of both sexes vibrated best near 150 Hz, the 3 rd harmonic of their wbf. Similarly, both sexes of PTB had wbfs near 56 Hz, with associated ultrasonic clicks spanning 25 - 80 kHz. Their antennae vibrated in response to wingbeat sound, and an air-backed circular area on the metepisternite of both sexes vibrated best at 90 kHz but did not meet all the criteria for an ear. Finally, male WCM had a wbf of 58 Hz but females never flew or fluttered. Male and female antennae vibrated in response to the wbf and had a best frequency at 100 Hz, near the 2 nd harmonic of the wbf. I conclude that these moths, like mosquitoes, have mechanically resonant antennae sensitive to sounds. Like many other flies and bees, the moths may use their antennae to detect wbfs. Because they have little acoustical effect, I suggest a different function for fibrils of male mosquitoes...|$|R

50|$|Tineids are unusual among Lepidoptera as {{the larvae}} {{of only a}} very small number of species feed on living plants, the {{majority}} feeding on fungi, lichens, and detritus. The most familiar members of the family are the <b>clothes</b> <b>moths,</b> which have adapted to feeding on stored fabrics. The most widespread of such species are the common <b>clothes</b> <b>moth</b> (Tineola bisselliella), the case-bearing <b>clothes</b> <b>moth</b> (Tinea pellionella), and the carpet moth (Trichophaga tapetzella); the brown-dotted <b>clothes</b> <b>moth</b> (Niditinea fuscella) despite its name, preferentially feeds on feathers in bird nests.|$|R
30|$|Among {{the traps}} placed out {{there were more}} than 550 that {{contained}} pheromones to attract either the <b>webbing</b> <b>clothes</b> <b>moth</b> (Tineola bisselliella) or the case bearing clothes moth (Tinea pellionella).

The data is difficult to interpret and gain an overall sense of distribution or change. On the simplest level it exists on almost 1500 individual spreadsheets collected for management purposes over more than ten years. The data contained on the individual spreadsheets were transformed to a single ASCII file for each territory, which could then be read by a wide range of software.|$|E

30|$|Several hundred traps {{were laid}} that {{included}} pheromones as attractants {{for either the}} <b>webbing</b> <b>clothes</b> <b>moth</b> or less commonly the case bearing clothes moth.

The catch rate was 2.67 moths per trap where pheromone was present, as expected e.g. [9] much greater than the 0.065 moths per trap caught when it was absent; a more than thirty-fold increase in catch rate (p[*]<[*] 0.001, Mann–Whitney U test). Some 29 % of the traps showed the presence of moths in the case of pheromone traps compared with 3.3 % presence {{in the absence of the}} pheromone. This situation was repeated in the Southeast where the catch rate was 3.18 and 0.03 for the pheromone and non-pheromone traps (p[*]<[*] 0.001, Mann–Whitney U test).

40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted {{that the natural}} habitats of most pest insects can be found outside the synanthropic environment in layers of leaf litter, under bark, {{as well as in}} rodent or bird nests. Indeed, most of the common pests have been reported as being facultative nidicolous. Therefore infestation of commodities by pest insects out of these reservoirs is one considerable possibility. However, the likelihood of a pest´s occurrence and survival out-doors largely depends on its ecological potential and competitiveness against other species of the same ecological guild. Some pest species are rarely found in wild habitats, especially in those regions where they are not native and where they have been introduced by man. The fabric pest Tineola bisselliella serves as a good example. Most likely originating in Central or Southern Africa this insect was introduced into Europe probably not earlier than the late 18 th century. Being more tolerant to dry environments than other fabric pests its economical importance increased during the 20 th century when in-door climates changed because of central heating systems. Its occurrence in out-door natural habitats must be regarded as accidental. Reported founds of <b>webbing</b> <b>clothes</b> <b>moth</b> larvae in bird nests e. g. have been largely overstated in the literature. T. bisselliella should be regarded as an eusynanthropic species...|$|E
40|$|Insect pests are {{responsible}} for substantial damage to museum objects, historic books and in buildings like palaces or historic houses. Different wood boring beetles (Anobium punctatum, Hylotrupes bajulus, Lyctus sp. or introduced species), the biscuit beetle (Stegobium paniceum), the cigarette beetle (Lasioderma serricorne), different Dermestides (Attagenus sp., Anthrenus sp., Dermestes sp., Trogoderma sp.), moths like the <b>webbing</b> <b>clothes</b> <b>moth</b> (Tineola bisselliella), Silverfish (Lepisma saccharina) and booklice (Psocoptera) can damage materials, objects or building parts. They {{are the most common}} pests found in collections in central Europe, but most of them are distributed all over the world. In tropical countries, termites, cockroaches and other insect pests are also found and result in even higher damage of wood and paper or are a commune annoyance in buildings. In this short review, an introduction to Integrated Pest Management (IPM) in museums is given, the most valuable collections, preventive measures, monitoring in museums, staff responsible for the IPM and chemical free treatment methods are described. In {{the second part of the}} paper, the most important insect pests occurring in museums, archives, libraries and historic buildings in central Europe are discussed with a description of the materials and object types that are mostly infested and damaged.

40|$|Biscuit beetle (Stegobium paniceum) and <b>webbing</b> <b>clothes</b> <b>moth</b> (Tineola bisselliella) cause {{much damage}} to museum objects. Some objects and {{materials}} are very attractive {{to these two}} pest species and objects are often re-infested after treatment. For some years parasitoid wasps {{have been used in}} biological pest control to treat and reduce infestations of stored product pests in food processing facilities. Their application in museums is still new and in a research stage. Results from five different museums in Germany and Austria and their application are presented. Lariophagus distinguendus wasps were released against Stegobium paniceum in the municipal library Augsburger Stadtarchiv (Germany), the Ethnological Museum in Berlin (Germany) and the Picture Gallery in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna (Austria). Trichogramma evanescens were released against Tineola bisselliella in the Technisches Museum in Vienna (Austria) and in the Deutsches Museum Verkehrszentrum in Munich (Germany). Results show that for active biscuit beetle infestations good results can be expected using the Lariophagus distinguendus in museums. Active clothes moth infestations are harder to treat but with a very regular and long-term exposure to the wasps, the clothes moth population can be reduced over the years. We see the application of parasitoid wasps as part of an Integrated Pest Management concept that should be used besides regular insect monitoring and other preventive measures. Difficulties, limitations and research needs in the application of parasitoid wasps in museums are discussed...|$|E

40|$|International audienceMoth pests {{belonging}} to the Tineidae attack clothing and other animal products, during the processing or manufacturing stage {{as well as in}} storage. The insects cause considerable loss or damage to the commodity in terms of quantity, quality and market value. Insect control measures in these products differ depending on the conditions of storage or processing and the relevant cost factor. Fumigation products {{play an important role in}} insect pest elimination for the majority of stored animal products. The need of detailed studies on alternatives methods involving the exploitation of insect traps for pest management has been highlighted. In the past years test systems for the evaluation of attractant products have been developed and further refined in our laboratory. In this study, a standardized test system for the evaluation in vitro of commercial traps for Tineola bisselliella, the <b>webbing</b> <b>clothes</b> <b>moth</b> (WCM), was validated. Three sticky traps baited with female-produced sex pheromone were tested in the laboratory and in vivo at the "Mobilier National", a repository of valuable artefacts. In both types of experiment the number of individuals captured was closely linked with the kinetic release of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from the sticky traps. The test system allowed clear discrimination of the products according their efficiency in a reliable manner but none of the traps tested were effective enough to reduce the damage potential of the pest. In the light of these results, the characteristics needed for an effective trap in warehouse conditions is discussed...|$|E
