25|$|Though {{crude oil}} is {{predominantly}} composed of various hydrocarbons, certain nitrogen heterocylic compounds, such as pyridine, picoline, and quinoline are reported as contaminants associated with crude oil, {{as well as}} facilities processing oil shale or coal, and have also been found at legacy <b>wood</b> <b>treatment</b> sites. These compounds {{have a very high}} water solubility, and thus tend to dissolve and move with water. Certain naturally occurring bacteria, such as Micrococcus, Arthrobacter, and Rhodococcus have been shown to degrade these contaminants.|$|E
25|$|Many {{vegetable}} oils {{are used to}} make soaps, skin products, candles, perfumes and other personal care and cosmetic products. Some oils are particularly suitable as drying oils, and are used in making paints and other <b>wood</b> <b>treatment</b> products. Dammar oil (a mixture of linseed oil and dammar resin), for example, is used almost exclusively in treating the hulls of wooden boats. Vegetable oils are increasingly {{being used in the}} electrical industry as insulators as {{vegetable oils}} are not toxic to the environment, biodegradable if spilled and have high flash and fire points. However, vegetable oils are less stable chemically, so they are generally used in systems where they are not exposed to oxygen, and they are more expensive than crude oil distillate. Synthetic tetraesters, which are similar to vegetable oils but with four fatty acid chains compared to the normal three found in a natural ester, are manufactured by Fischer esterification. Tetraesters generally have high stability to oxidation and have found use as engine lubricants. Vegetable oil is being used to produce biodegradable hydraulic fluid and lubricant.|$|E

She then sailed 13 December, not returning until 22 April 1837. Her master was R. Pattenden Lawrence.

40|$|The {{movement}} of chemicals through wood is necessaryfor decay and fastener corrosion {{to occur in}} forest products. However, the mechanism responsible for the onset of fastenercorrosion and decay in wood is not known. The onset occursbefore the formation of free water in wood cavities and aqueouschemical transport would be possible. Here, we propose that theonset mechanism is the hemicelluloses going through a moistureinducedglass transition. As nm-scale regions of mechanicallysoftened hemicelluloses in cell walls percolate, pathways forchemical transport are created. The ability of chemicals to movein cell walls enables fastener corrosion and decay to occur. Thismechanism suggests that <b>wood</b> <b>treatments</b> preventing the glasstransition of hemicelluloses will inhibit fastener corrosion andwood decay. The identification of this mechanism shouldaccelerate the development of <b>wood</b> <b>treatments</b> to improve forestproducts durability...|$|R
2500|$|Coal-tar {{creosote}} is {{the most}} widely used <b>wood</b> <b>treatment</b> today; both industrially, processed into wood using pressure methods such as [...] "full-cell process" [...] or [...] "empty-cell process", and more commonly applied to wood through brushing. In addition to toxicity to fungi, insects, and marine borers, it serves as a natural water repellant. It's commonly used to preserve and waterproof cross ties, pilings, telephone poles, power line poles, marine pilings, and fence posts. Although suitable for use in preserving the structural timbers of buildings, it is not generally used that way because it is difficult to apply. There are also concerns about the environmental impact of the secretion of creosote preservative into the aquatic ecosystem.|$|E
2500|$|For the {{preservation}} of anthropological and biological specimens during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, objects were dipped in or were painted with a [...] "mercuric solution". This was done to prevent the specimens' destruction by moths, mites and mold. Objects in drawers were protected by scattering crystalline mercuric chloride over them. [...] It finds minor use in tanning, and wood was preserved by kyanizing (soaking in mercuric chloride). [...] Mercuric chloride {{was one of the}} three chemicals used for railroad tie <b>wood</b> <b>treatment</b> between 1830 and 1856 in Europe and the United States. [...] Limited railroad ties were treated in the United States until there were concerns over lumber shortages in the 1890s. [...] The process was generally abandoned because mercuric chloride was water-soluble and not effective for the long term, as well as poisonous. [...] Furthermore, alternative treatment processes, such as copper sulfate, zinc chloride, and ultimately creosote; were found to be less toxic. [...] Limited kyanizing was used for some railroad ties in the 1890s and early 1900s.|$|E

This issue of shares amounted to 20% of the then issued capital, and they were taken up by existing shareholders. In the same year the company considerably extended its Knott Mill factory, at which time a visitor noted in particular the work in progress on [...] "several exceptionally large engines for iron and steel works" [...] (one had a 45 ton, 24 foot diameter flywheel and a total weight of 230 tons) and also a <b>wood</b> <b>treatment</b> plant for the Northern Wood Haskinising Company (haskinising was a wood preservation technique). There were reports at this time that the company had licensed and was developing Pictet's discovery of an improved method for the production of oxygen gas, although there were suggestions that this may have been as part of a syndicate involving other Manchester businesses. The plan was for Pictet to experiment further at the Galloway works and if the outcome was successful then a new company would be formed.|$|E

40|$|The natural {{composition}} of wood is not {{compatible with the}} use of such material in outdoor environments as it is exposed to severe degradation agents. In order to protect it from the negative effects of such agents, wood can be a subject to specific <b>treatments.</b> <b>Wood</b> <b>treatments</b> are considered as “passive” when they modify only the properties of the material without altering its chemical composition (impregnation). Conversely, “active” treatments modify the chemical nature of <b>wood.</b> These <b>treatments</b> (thermal and chemical) produce a different material known as “modified wood”. The overall environmental performance of <b>wood</b> <b>treatments</b> has not received much attention in the scientific or technical literature. This is in contrast with the recent methodologies of process analysis and assessment, which underline that this aspect can be critical for the selection of the most appropriate technology. The paper reports the results of a preliminary environmental assessment of a pole made of pine wood for outdoor use which was subject to three treatments: impregnation, thermal treatment and acetylation. The study assesses the environmental impact of the treatment process but not of the final product. In addition, the environmental impact here discussed is limited to one impact category (Global Warming Potential – GWP) of the life-cycle assessment methodology...|$|R
