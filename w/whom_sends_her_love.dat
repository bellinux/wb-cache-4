60|$|May God bless you, my dear Mr. Boyd. Mr. Savage Landor {{once said}} that anybody who could write a parody {{deserved}} to be shot; but as he has written one himself since saying so, he has probably changed his mind. Arabel <b>sends</b> <b>her</b> <b>love.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "She is a dear little girl, and {{is growing}} fast. I think {{she must have}} grown quite an inch in the five months you have been away. She <b>sends</b> <b>her</b> <b>love</b> to you, and says you must take care of yourself, for her sake." ...|$|R
6000|$|This is Monday morning--nothing {{particular}} {{happened yesterday}} evening, except {{that when the}} tray came up Mrs. Dilke and I had a battle with celery stalks--she <b>sends</b> <b>her</b> <b>love</b> to you. I shall close this and send it immediately to Haslam--remaining ever, My dearest brother and sister, ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You now {{understand}} why I have ventured to trouble {{you on a}} purely professional topic. To turn to matters of more interest--our dear Carmina is well enough to remember you, and to <b>send</b> <b>her</b> <b>love</b> to you and the girls. But even this little effort is followed by fatigue.|$|R
6000|$|... "Let us {{go for a}} walk, and I'll {{leave the}} man with the horses. I've {{something}} special to say to you, and I can say it better out here than in the house. Grace is quite well, and <b>sends</b> <b>her</b> <b>love.</b> She is growing to look so beautiful!" ...|$|R
50|$|A woman asks {{after her}} father, her mother, and her true-love John. Only John is there. He waits until all are abed and joins her. The woman tells the cock to crow {{when it is}} day; it crows an hour early, and she <b>sends</b> <b>her</b> <b>love</b> away before she needs to.|$|R
60|$|Henrietta would <b>send</b> <b>her</b> <b>love</b> {{to you if}} I {{could hear}} her voice nearer than I do actually, as she sings to the guitar downstairs. And <b>her</b> <b>love</b> {{is not the only}} one to be sent. Give mine to dear Mr. Martin, though he can't make up his mind to the bore of writing to me. And {{remember}} us all, both of you, as we do you.|$|R
60|$|My aunt {{received}} {{a few lines}} next day in reply; addressed, outside, to her; within, to me. Dora was overcome by grief; and when her friend had asked <b>her</b> should she <b>send</b> <b>her</b> <b>love</b> to me, had only cried, as she was always crying, 'Oh, dear papa! oh, poor papa!' But she had not said No, and that I made the most of.|$|R
6000|$|... "Go out {{and let her}} {{see that}} you have taken her advice. She is there at the house, and she will {{recognise}} you in the park. Remember that she <b>sends</b> <b>her</b> <b>love</b> to you, and bids you be a man. And, Larry, come in and see us sometimes. The time will come, I don't doubt, when you and the squire will be fast friends." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "DEAREST MOTHER,--I {{could do}} you no good, {{but it would}} be the {{greatest}} comfort to me if I could be near you. Nothing would detain me but Susan's condition. I feel that until her confinement is over, I ought to remain here,--unless you wished me to go to you; in which case she {{would be the first to}} send me off. Happily she is doing as well as possible, and seems even to gain strength every day. She <b>sends</b> <b>her</b> <b>love</b> to you.|$|R
50|$|Given that Henchard married {{somebody}} else, {{their original}} engagement {{to each other}} is null and void. Yet Henchard, who finds himself very interested in Lucetta particularly since she has come into money, bullies Lucetta into accepting his proposal again. Lucetta elopes with Farfrae, and incurs Henchard's wrath.

The love affair becomes public, and the scandal eventually contributes to Lucetta's death.|$|R
6000|$|... "I was at Windsor," [...] her host remarked. [...] "Now come, {{sit there}} in the easy-chair {{by the side of}} my table. My {{secretaries}} have not yet arrived. We shall be entirely undisturbed. I have ordered coffee here, of which we will partake together. A compromising meal to share, dear Baroness, but in the library of my own house it may be excused. The Princess <b>sends</b> <b>her</b> <b>love.</b> She will be glad if you will go to her apartments after we have finished our talk." ...|$|R
60|$|There was {{no other}} news in Peggotty's letters. Mr. Barkis was an {{excellent}} husband, she said, though still a little near; but we all had our faults, and she had plenty (though I am sure I don't know what they were); and he sent his duty, and my little bedroom was always ready for me. Mr. Peggotty was well, and Ham was well, and Mrs.. Gummidge was but poorly, and little Em'ly wouldn't <b>send</b> <b>her</b> <b>love,</b> but said that Peggotty might send it, if she liked.|$|R
60|$|DEAR FOLKS,--Livy <b>sends</b> you <b>her</b> <b>love</b> {{and loving}} good wishes, and I send you mine. The last 3 {{chapters}} of the book came tonight--we shall {{read it in the}} morning and then thank goodness, we are done.|$|R
6000|$|... "Francine, you are {{positively}} shameless! After calling my dearest friend a fool and a glutton, you <b>send</b> <b>her</b> your <b>love</b> {{for your own}} selfish ends; and {{you expect me to}} help you in deceiving her! I won't do it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah, I {{have nothing}} to <b>send</b> <b>her</b> but my <b>love!</b> And I may <b>send</b> <b>her</b> that still,' said Minna, looking up wistfully at Averil, who bent down and kissed her.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{received}} two nice letters to-day," [...] said Dora that evening, {{when her husband}} and the others appeared, and she held up the missives. [...] "One is from mamma, and she <b>sends</b> <b>her</b> best <b>love</b> to all of you. The other is from your Aunt Martha." ...|$|R

60|$|The {{letter was}} kindly expressed, {{but this was}} lost upon Marian in the pain its purport gave her, and the {{difficulty}} of composing an answer. She chose her smallest sheet of writing-paper with the deepest black edge, wrote as widely as she could, and used the longest words, but with all Mrs. Wortley's suggestions, she could not eke out {{what she had to say}} beyond the first page. She would not even <b>send</b> <b>her</b> <b>love</b> to <b>her</b> cousins, for she said she could have no particular affection for them, and to express any pleasure in the prospect of seeing so many strangers would be an actual untruth.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Coleridge {{is remarkably}} well, and <b>sends</b> <b>her</b> kind <b>love.</b> Pray, my dear, dear Poole, do not neglect {{to write to}} me every week.

50|$|He is {{persuaded to}} leave his lonely but poetically {{fruitful}} bachelor life by {{the editor of a}} woman's magazine, Vesta Bainbridge, after he accidentally <b>sends</b> <b>her</b> a <b>love</b> poem instead of a complaint about a recipe in her magazine. The marriage, which soon ends, costs Enderby dearly, alienating him from his muse and depriving him of his financial independence.|$|R
60|$|The amended route-list is {{not printed}} yet, because I {{am trying to}} get off Manchester and Liverpool; both of which I {{strongly}} doubt, in {{the present state of}} American affairs. Therefore I can't send it for Marguerite; but I can, and do, <b>send</b> <b>her</b> my <b>love</b> and God-speed. This is addressed to the office because I suppose you will be there to-morrow.|$|R
50|$|Jerusha {{writes about}} her lessons from her {{freshman}} year classes ("Freshman Year Studies"), and describes her anxiety over trying {{to fit in with}} the other girls at her college due to her upbringing in an orphanage ("Like Other Girls"). She then writes about her embarrassment at her lack of education and her excitement about learning ("Things I Didn't Know"). During the Christmas vacation, Jerusha stays behind in the college to catch up on <b>her</b> reading, and <b>sends</b> <b>her</b> <b>love</b> to Daddy Long Legs in her loneliness. The shy and awkward Jervis finds her affection-filled letters disconcerting ("What Does She Mean By Love?"). Jerusha flunks two of her first exams and is mortified. She becomes ill and writes angrily to Daddy Long Legs, accusing him of not caring for her and simply supporting her merely out of charity. Moved by this, Jervis <b>sends</b> <b>her</b> a bouquet of flowers, and Jerusha is penitent ("I'm A Beast").|$|R
