5|$|In 2004, astronomers using {{computer}} simulations speculated {{that even if}} Betelgeuse is not rotating it might exhibit large-scale magnetic activity in its extended atmosphere, a factor <b>where</b> <b>even</b> moderately strong fields could have a meaningful influence over the star's dust, wind and mass-loss properties. A series of spectropolarimetric observations obtained in 2010 with the Bernard Lyot Telescope at Pic du Midi Observatory revealed {{the presence of a}} weak magnetic field at the surface of Betelgeuse, suggesting that the giant convective motions of supergiant stars are able to trigger the onset of a small-scale dynamo effect.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{immediately}} {{effort was}} focused upon selecting and identifying {{the officers and}} NCOs. To this end volunteers were called for amongst units that had already formed {{as part of the}} 2nd New Zealand Expeditionary Force (2NZEF) and from new recruits. At the end of November, 146 trainees reported to the Army School at Trentham, <b>where</b> <b>even</b> serving officers and NCOs were required to prove their suitability for positions in the new battalion. Concurrently, recruiting of men to fill the other ranks positions began in early October and within three weeks nearly 900 men had enlisted. The process was carried out by recruiting officers who worked closely with tribal authorities, and the recruits were restricted to single men aged between 21 and 35, although later married men were allowed to join, but only if they did not have more than two children of similar ages.|$|E
5|$|The winning design, the English Electric Canberra, also {{dispensed}} with defensive armaments, producing a design {{with the speed}} that allowed it to fly past most defences. Just as importantly, the design's long, straight wing gave it the lift needed to operate at very high altitudes, placing it above the range <b>where</b> <b>even</b> jet powered fighters were able to operate. The Canberra could simply fly over its enemy with relative impunity, a quality that made it naturally suited to aerial reconnaissance missions, spawning a number of spin-off versions of the aircraft with even larger wings for even greater altitude performance and improved range.|$|E

5|$|In Europe, British Airways, Iberia, and Icelandair {{were the}} 757's largest {{mainline}} customers, while other carriers such as Lufthansa rejected the type as {{too large for}} their narrow-body aircraft needs. Many European charter airlines, including Air 2000, Air Holland, and LTU International, also acquired the twinjet for holiday and tour package flights in the late 1980s. In Asia, <b>where</b> <b>even</b> larger aircraft were commonly preferred because of greater passenger volumes, the 757 found fewer orders. A 1982 sales demonstration was unable to attract a purchase from potential customer Japan Airlines, and the first Asian customer, Singapore Airlines, sold its four 757s in 1989 in favor of standardizing on the 240-seat wide-body Airbus A310, just five years after debuting the type on Indonesian and Malaysian routes. The 757 fared better in China, where following an initial purchase by the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) in 1987, orders grew to 59 aircraft, making it the largest Asian market. Operators such as China Southern, China Southwest, Shanghai Airlines, Xiamen Airlines, and Xinjiang Airlines used the 757 on medium length domestic routes.|$|E
5|$|Montagu, having {{responsibility}} for the defence of the north, received various commissions of array, which reflected the government's knowledge that King Edward was equipping a Burgundian-backed fleet in order to re-invade. Montagu was to raise men from all across the north. On 14 March 1471, King Edward landed at Ravenspur, {{on the coast of}} Yorkshire; he had intended to land in East Anglia, but this had been established as being unsafe. Montagu, it has been suggested, could have 'snuffed out' Edward's army almost immediately had he moved fast enough. Montagu was in Pontefract Castle as Edward passed by (<b>where</b> <b>even</b> his castle bailiff deserted him for the returning king, taking the castle's funds with him). Montagu's army, composed of local militias, was probably in the region of several thousand men, between 6,000 and 7,000, and increased as he trailed Edward south. Montagu arrived at Coventry, where the Earl of Warwick was camped, in Early April 1471; this was probably the day after Clarence had defected back to his brother Edward, and taken his army with him.|$|E
5|$|Plans for {{the club}} {{to move to a}} new groundMaine Roadin Moss Side were {{announced}} in 1922. The final Manchester City match at Hyde Road was a league fixture against Newcastle United on 28 April 1923, and in August 1923 a public practice game was the last football match played at Hyde Road. Manchester City began the 192324 season at Maine Road, which had an 80,000 capacity. Parts of Hyde Road were used elsewhere; the roof of the Main Stand was sold to Halifax Town, and erected at The Shay, <b>where</b> <b>even</b> in the 21st century, part of the Hyde Road roof is still in place. Within a decade, all traces of the football ground had disappeared from Hyde Road. The bulk of the area was taken over by Manchester Corporation Tramways department, whose major Hyde Road depot and works was alongside, for use as their Permanent Way yard for assembling and storing tramway rails and materials. The Tramways system also provided at this time a substantial parcels handling service within the city, using both vans and special parcels trams, and a new central parcels depot was built on the Bennett Street side of the former site, against the railway viaduct. After the end of Manchester's trams in 1949 (most of the old trams were scrapped on this site) it was used for storing old buses and as a bus drivers' training area. As of 2000, the site of the pitch is Olympic Freight Terminal, a container storage and warehousing facility.|$|E

25|$|Members may be {{sent from}} the {{congregation}} to associations that are sometimes {{identified with the}} church bodies formed by Lutherans, Presbyterians, Anglicans, and other non-congregational Protestants.
