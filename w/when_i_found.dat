As I got further into the Cope and Marsh story, and I liked the two less and less as people—which is different from liking them as characters, of course—I wanted to have a character in the book for the readers to root for, and neither of the scientists could fill that role. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> out that Knight had met Cope just before Cope died, I became convinced that he was the character I needed.|$|E

500|$|Throughout {{his playing}} career, Maxwell {{received}} several offers to turn professional. [...] the National Hockey Association's Toronto Blueshirts offered him $1,500 {{to join their}} team, while representatives of the Pacific Coast Hockey Association made an offer of $1,800 the following season. [...] He turned both offers down, preferring to remain an amateur. His feelings on what constituted an amateur player were so strong that he quit playing hockey following the 1915 Allan Cup as {{the nature of the}} senior game at the time failed to meet his expectations: [...] "When I played, I bought my own skates and boots. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> out some of the others were getting paid, I quit." ...|$|E
500|$|Greer was {{notified}} {{of the position}} by her agent while shooting for a separate film. [...] "I'd {{been trying to get}} into voiceovers," [...] she explained, [...] "so they called and said it was a pilot they were doing for FX, and I could record the part on my day off in 10 minutes." [...] The actress read the script and recorded her lines at a recording studio in Phoenix, Arizona; upon first glance, Greer suggested that the raunchy and risque nature of the script would prevent any television stations from picking up the series. [...] "So <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> out it was picked up, I was like, 'Oh! Wait, I don't know what you're talking about.' They said, 'Remember that thing?' And I went, 'Really?' So then I recorded a bunch of them, and the scripts were the funniest scripts that I've ever read, and so crazy." ...|$|E

[...] I mean John Lee's got {{a hell of a}} style". [...] In an interview, Buddy Guy described learning to play [...] "Boogie Chillen'" [...] at age thirteen: [...] "that was the first thing I thought I learned how to play that I knew sounded right when someone would listen." [...] Guy later recorded a version with Junior Wells for their 1981 album Alone & Acoustic. [...] Albert Collins also recalled that it was the first song he learned to play.|$|E

500|$|Vietnam War resisters in 1977, Satin began giving {{talks on}} New Age Politics in the United States. [...] His first talk {{received}} a standing ovation, and he wept. [...] Every talk seemed {{to lead to}} two or three more, and [...] "the response at New Age gatherings, community events, fairs, bookstores, living rooms, and college campuses" [...] kept Satin going for two years. [...] By the second year he began laying the groundwork for the New World Alliance, a national political organization based in Washington, D.C. [...] "I went systematically to 24 cities and regions from coast to coast", he told the authors of the book Networking. [...] "I stopped <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> 500 [...] people who said they'd answer a questionnaire … on what a New Age-oriented political organization should be like– what its politics should be, what its projects should be, and how its first directors should be chosen.".|$|E
500|$|... "During {{many years}} I {{collected}} {{notes on the}} origin or descent of man, without any intention of publishing on the subject, but rather with the determination not to publish, as I thought that I should thus only add to the prejudices against my views. It seemed to me sufficient to indicate, in {{the first edition of}} my 'Origin of Species,' that by this work 'light would be thrown on the origin of man and his history;' and this implies that man must be included with other organic beings in any general conclusion respecting his manner of appearance on this earth." [...] In a preface to the 1874 second edition, he added a reference to the second point: [...] "it has been said by several critics, that <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> that many details of structure in man could not be explained through natural selection, I invented sexual selection; I gave, however, a tolerably clear sketch of this principle in the first edition of the 'Origin of Species,' and I there stated that it was applicable to man." ...|$|E

Salvatore sent her a proposal for a sequel to Darkwalker, but Kirchoff sent back a large map of the Forgotten Realms and told him she wanted a new story set in {{a different part of the}} Realms. After two weeks of phone calls, Salvatore found a spot on the map that was not already designated for another project, and he located Icewind Dale there. According to Salvatore, the book was [...] "set on the Moonshae Isles, because at the time I thought that was the Realms. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> out how big the Realms were, I moved the story a thousand miles to the north." ...|$|E

In December 2000, Ian Hyland of the Sunday Mirror voted the scene in which Peggy slaps both Pat and Frank {{as one of the}} [...] "TV fights of the year", saying [...] "It was Peggy's speech which really made it a Bonfire Night to remember. But the slaps were equally well dispatched." [...] Commenting on Reid's exit, Windsor has said, [...] "We fell out <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> out he was leaving because it was a shock for me. I was really upset. I've known him 30 odd years and I really like working with him. We had a great relationship as friends as well as performers.

500|$|For the {{flashback}} {{scene at}} the Tower of Joy, actor Robert Aramayo was cast to play a young Eddard Stark. In an interview with Access Hollywood, Aramayo stated {{that he was a}} big fan of the series, and that [...] "it was an honor and a gift {{to be able to be}} a part of it." [...] In regards to portraying the character similar to Sean Bean, who played Eddard Stark in the first season, Aramayo noted, [...] "I didn't want to get too hung up in sounding like Sean because I think that would've sort of got in my way if I'd have just situated all my work in that place. I watched a lot of footage of him playing Ned in the first season again, repeatedly, especially one particular fight scene that he was in and I think that was the biggest help for me when creating this version of Ned – was watching what Sean did with Ned in the first season and trying to work out what a younger man's version of that is." [...] In a separate interview with The Hollywood Reporter Aramayo spoke about auditioning for the role, stating, [...] "The chance to audition to be on the show was a dream, even to audition. It was an absolute dream to me. I was very excited to audition, and landing the role was beyond my wildest dreams. Then <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> out the role was Ned, it was overwhelming." ...|$|E
500|$|Tyler had her {{breakthrough}} {{role in the}} art house film Stealing Beauty (1996), {{in which}} she played Lucy Harmon, an innocent, romantic teenager who travels to Tuscany, Italy, intent on losing her virginity. The film received generally mixed reviews, but Tyler's performance was regarded favorably by the critics. Variety wrote: [...] "Tyler is the perfect accomplice. At times sweetly awkward, at others composed and serene, the actress appears to respond effortlessly and intuitively to the camera, creating a rich sense of what Lucy is about that often is not explicit in the dialogue." [...] Empire noted, [...] "Liv Tyler (here radiantly resembling a ganglier young Ava Gardner) with {{a rare opportunity to}} enamour, a break she capitalizes on with composure." [...] The film was directed by Bernardo Bertolucci, who chose Tyler for the role after meeting with a number of young girls in Los Angeles, including Tyler's music video co-star Alicia Silverstone. Bertolucci said [...] "there was something missing in all of them". He later said that what he saw in Tyler was a gravitas he described as [...] "a New York aura". During promotion of the film, Tyler said she wanted to separate herself from the character during production: [...] "I tried my damnedest not to think of my own situation. But at one point, after a take, I just started to cry and cry. I remembered <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> out about my dad and how we just stared at each other from head to toe taking in every nook and cranny." ...|$|E

500|$|As {{her story}} {{progresses}} following her constant manipulative behavior, Chloe reveals her true identity: Kate Valentine, {{the daughter of}} the Chancellor maid Esther Valentine (Kate Linder). The storyline was dubbed [...] "Chloe is Kate". Hendrickson was pleased that the writers decided to give Chloe a backstory, saying, [...] "I was so excited <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> out Chloe was going to have some family ties. I knew it would give me, as an actor, a chance to finally explain to viewers why Chloe is the way she is." [...] The actress felt that her family reveal proved that she's not [...] "this bitch who likes to destroy people's lives", attesting her behavior to not being raised by parents; [...] "She never had anyone tell her wrong from right," [...] Hendrickson stated. Her backstory revealed that Chloe hadn't seen her mother or her employer Katherine Chancellor (Jeanne Cooper) and Jill Abbott (Jess Walton) since she [...] "was young and overweight with braces". Kate Linder was also pleased with the writing direction, describing it as an [...] "honor" [...] to work with Hendrickson. She said, [...] "When they decided to bring [...] back, I was stunned and pleasantly surprised. Maria Bell called me and {{told me that it was}} top secret. It was a great reveal." [...] Chloe initially gives Esther the cold shoulder. Of her reasoning behind this, Hendrickson said, [...] "Chloe is very young and immature — as well, hurt and ashamed about her upbringing. She’s not going to let her mother forget it easily." [...] She described their initial relationship as [...] "realistic" [...] and similar to [...] "a lot of mother-and-daughter relationships".|$|E

Of his exit, Lapinskas said [...] "I'm having a fantastic time working on EastEnders and {{playing the role of}} Anthony Moon. Working with David Essex, Tony Discipline and the EastEnders cast has been an absolute pleasure. Although I will really miss EastEnders and everyone involved, I am very excited about future projects and what is next for me as an actor." [...] Lapinskas revealed that Anthony's exit plot sees him make a [...] "big mistake". Anthony realises how much he loves Alice Branning (Jasmyn Banks) but is unsure how to deal with her brother and father Joey (David Witts) and Derek Branning (Jamie Foreman) respectively. Speaking to Soaplife, Lapinskas said [...] "Joey manipulates Anthony into challenging Derek, which is a big mistake. I can't give too much away, but I can tell you that after going up against Derek, Anthony {{has no choice but to}} leave the Square." [...] Magazine reports claim that Anthony packs his bags after losing everything to Joey and Derek, revising his gambling problem. Lapinskas hopes that Anthony will return someday. In an interview with Inside Soap, Lapinskas said that EastEnders was his first job outside of drama school and added that he has learnt a lot from the people he worked with. He also added [...] "I was quite disappointed <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> out Anthony {{would be leaving}}, I'd have liked to do a lot more stuff with him.
