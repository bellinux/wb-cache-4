2500|$|When I have {{a mental}} {{image of a}} triangle, for example, I don't just {{understand}} that it is a figure bounded by three lines; I also [...] "look at" [...] the lines as though they were present to my mind's eye. [...] And this is what I call having a mental image. When I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> a chiliagon, I {{understand that it is}} a figure with a thousand sides as well as I understand that a triangle is a figure with three, but I can't imagine its sides or [...] "look" [...] at them as though they were present (...) Thus I observe that a special effort of mind is necessary to the act of imagination, which is not required to conceiving or understanding (ad intelligendum); and this special exertion of mind clearly shows the difference between imagination and pure intellection (imaginatio et intellectio pura). (Descartes, Meditation VI: On the Existence of Material Objects and the Real Distinction of Mind from Body).|$|E
2500|$|By {{the time}} they had been separated, the duo had already broken several records. When Dravid hit an {{exemplary}} cover-drive to bring up the 250 of the partnership, they became the first batting pair to put on two stands excess of 250 against Australia. After their stand ended, however, Dravid felt least unperturbed and forged a partnership of 59 with the young Parthiv Patel, who played well for a composed 31, which consisted of three successive fours off MacGill, but the partnership ended when Patel drove Katich to Ponting. At 447/6, the new man Ajit Agarkar came in and Dravid stitched a stand of 22 with him and then Agarkar too departed at 469/7. Finally, with the new man Kumble, Dravid added 8 runs before the play was finished for the day. He finished tantalizingly at 199 not out, an innings which was built slowly, yet steadily. This was his first test hundred in Australia, and this was an innings which [...] "laughed at the face of that innuendo". Sambit Bal, noted cricinfo author argued that Dravid could have completed any easy double hundred had he not refused easy runs in order to shield the lower-order batsmen. Bal also described Dravid's batting as being [...] "picture perfect. It describes balance, poise and symmetry". Laxman and Dravid had frustrated Australia so much on that day, that their partnership seemed to be an encore of that 376 that had put on together at Kolkata in 2000–01. Laxman had scored a double century back then, and Dravid seemed to be on the cusp of another one. in fact, when Ricky Ponting was asked {{at the end of the}} previous day whether Dravid and Laxman's partnership brought back memories of Kolkata 2000–01, Ponting was reported to have said, [...] "I didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> that." ...|$|E

I only <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> you, and if you would try and be a little patient, I am sure that we would {{understand}} one another better very soon." ...|$|E

60|$|Smith got up {{and went}} out. Lane sat there with a vague sense of absurdity in the situation. The click of a {{typewriter}} sounded from behind him. He <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> hurry out. He <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> other things, and twice he drove away memory of the girl he had just left at Doctor Bronson's office. Presently Smith returned, slipping along in his shiny black suit, flat-footed and slightly bowed, with his set dull expression.|$|R

60|$|I did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> see the Italians. Something had got {{tied up in}} me, and I {{could not}} bear to see them again.

5000|$|Year 2013 also {{marked the}} 10th anniversary of Han's debut. Though {{he is now}} one of the most wanted actors in the musical theatre scene, he only became {{interested}} in acting after failing to score well on the Suneung ― the Korean equivalent of the SAT ― for three consecutive years. He found acting almost therapeutic in many ways, especially after his struggles with the competitive education system, and <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> acting as his destiny. Calling himself an [...] "extreme introvert", he believes it is the very essence of acting ― becoming someone else ― that liberates him and makes his acting career possible.|$|R

5000|$|A USA Today account observed: Sometimes they yelled for help. But {{mostly the}} 48-year-old sergeant, a 21-year veteran, and the 33-year-old rookie talked intimately, {{sometimes}} revealing personal things — about kids, families, feelings — {{that they had}} never shared with anyone. Jimeno asked the Sergeant to deliver a message over the radio to his wife, Allison, who was seven months pregnant. They had received no response earlier, but he thought maybe their radio call would be picked up on a police tape recording. [...] "Attention," [...] Sgt. McLoughlin announced, [...] "Officer Jimeno requests that his baby girl be named Olivia." [...] His wife had liked the name. He hadn't been so sure. Now, as he prepared <b>to</b> die, he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> his baby girl, Olivia.|$|R

6000|$|He did not {{hesitate}} this time. The moment {{we were in the}} road I ran; and after a moment he threw dignity aside and followed.
