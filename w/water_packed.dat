40|$|This {{study was}} aimed at finding a {{correlation}} between the experienced off-flavor in packaged foods {{and the presence of}} specific degradation products in PE packaging films. The possibility to trap degradation products by chemical reactions with scavengers, that is, zeolites and maleic anhydride grafted LLDPE, were investigated. This trapping would prevent the degradation products from migrating to the polymer film surface and further into food in contact with the film. This work concludes that off-flavor in <b>water</b> <b>packed</b> in LDPE-films depends on extrusion temperature and the content of oxidation products in the polymer film. At lower extrusion temperatures, reactive additives to the LDPE material could control the release of off-flavor giving components. Adsorbents, such as zeolites, which are able to adsorb degradation products, are effective also at higher extrusion temperatures. The amount of oxidized degradation products in the films correlated well to the perceived off-flavor in the packed water. The presence of aldehydes and ketones have a clear impact on the off-flavor. The best correlation between off-flavor and oxidized components were found for C- 7 -C- 9 ketones, and aldehydes in the range of C- 5 to C- 8. (C) 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|E

The possibility to trap degradation products by chemical reactions with scavengers, i. e., a zeolite additive or antioxidants, was investigated This would prevent degradation products from migrating to the polymer film surface and further into food in contact with the film. It was found that off-flavor noted in <b>water</b> <b>packed</b> in LDPE films depended on extrusion temperature and exposure time for the melt to oxygen, that is, the parameters that influence the contents of oxidation products that are able to migrate from the polymer film. It was also found that adsorption of oxidative degradation products in a zeolite additive or protection of LDPE by using antioxidants could prevent off-flavor in the packed product (water). However, the antioxidant should be selected with regard to extrusion temperature because thermal instability in the additive might jeopardize the intended effect. Multifunctional antioxidants seem to provide improved protection, the most effective one evaluated in this work being Irganox E 201, i. e., vitamin E. Concentrations of oxidized degradation products are well correlated to the perceived off-flavor in the packed water.

40|$|Freezing {{is one of}} {{the methods}} to {{preserve}} and guarantee the quality of meat until it reaches the consumer. Even though freezing is classified as a mild form of preservation, it causes meat changes resulting from the formation of ice crystals that subsequently affect the tenderness and functionality of meat. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the physicochemical and structural characteristics of chicken half breast submitted to fast freezing (- 36 °C for 2 hours) and thawed by five different methods (under refrigeration, in a microwave, in a oven with air circulation, placed in cold water, or at room temperature). After thawing, the following parameters were evaluated: moisture content, drip loss (syneresis), water activity (aw), and shear force. Samples were also histologically evaluated by light microscopy. The results indicated that, despite being submitted to fast freezing, thawing affected (p < 0. 05) most of the physicochemical and structural properties of the meat, except for aw. Thawing in cold <b>water</b> (<b>packed</b> in low-density polyethylene bags and placed in cold water at approximately 10 °C for 2 hours and 15 minutes) presented the best results due to lesser damage to the cell structure, as shown by the lower drip loss, higher moisture content, and greater tenderness of the samples compared to those thawed using the other methods. Histological examination showed that muscle fiber structural features and organization were maintained. Thawing at low temperatures seems to cause less damage to the meat structure and allows maintaining of its properties. It was concluded that the meat quality is not related only with the freezing method, but also with the method and conditions used in thawing...|$|E

During the shelf-life study, the quality of oysters was determined by measuring pH, moisture content, and microbial counts including aerobic, anaerobic bacteria and coliform. Descriptive testing was also performed by a trained panel. The pH of high pressure process (HPP) samples decreased slightly from 6. 3 to 5. 7 during storage while the control dropped to pH 4. 4. Moisture content of the control decreased slightly while HPP samples increased slightly. Pressure treatment did not significantly inhibit lipase activity during the shelf-life study. HPP reduced initial microbial load by approximately 2 - 3 logs and counts remained at a reduced level through the storage study. Descriptive tests showed that HPP treated oysters received higher quality scores than the control during the storage trial. Whole oysters were shucked under pressure of 35, 000 psi, 2 min. After shucking, oyster meats were <b>water</b> <b>packed</b> in plastic containers and repressureized. Tests were performed at 45, 000 psi, 30 s and 50, 000 psi (0 holding time, 10 s).

During the shelf-life study, oyster quality was determined by measuring pH, moisture content, protease, and microbial counts including aerobic, anaerobic bacteria and coliform. The pH of HPP samples decreased slightly from 6. 5 to 5. 7 during storage while the control I, hand-shucked oysters, dropped to pH 4. 3.
