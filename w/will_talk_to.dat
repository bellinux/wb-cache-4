5|$|Monsters <b>will</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> {{the player}} during the battle, {{and the game}} will tell the players what the monster's {{feelings}} and actions are. Enemy attacks change based on how players interact with them: should players choose non-violent options, enemy attacks are easy, whereas they become difficult if players choose violent options. The game relies {{on a number of}} metafictional elements in both its gameplay and story. When players participate in a boss battle on a second playthrough, the dialogue will be altered depending on actions in previous playthroughs.|$|E
5|$|The agents later see Walter Chaco, Paula's {{grandfather}} and the plant's owner, who while shaken over Paula's death gives the agents permission {{to perform an}} autopsy. The agents find that while Paula's personnel file gives her age as 47, she appears no older than her mid-20's. They also discover that Paula suffered from Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, a rare and fatal illness that causes dementia. When the agents nearly collide with a Chaco Chicken truck, they learn that the driver also suffered from the disease. Noticing the plant's blood-red runoff in a nearby stream, Mulder orders a reluctant Sheriff Arens to dredge it. They quickly find the bones of nine people, including Kearns. While inspecting the skeletal remains, the agents notice that the skeletons are all missing their skulls, and that the bones {{appear to have been}} boiled. Meanwhile, Randolph and Harold discuss the uncovered bones and increase of Creutzfeldt–Jakob cases. While Randolph complains about Chaco's inaction, Harold assures him that he <b>will</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> Chaco.|$|E
500|$|David Calvert-Smith, for the prosecution, {{alleged that}} the detectives' {{supposedly}} contemporaneous notes of the fifth interview with Silcott had been altered after the fact to include the self-incriminating remarks. Silcott had refused to answer questions during the first four interviews. During the fifth, when told there were witness statements that he had struck Blakelock with a machete or similar, the notes show him saying: [...] "Those kids will never go to court. You wait and see. No one else <b>will</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you. You can't keep me away from them." [...] Silcott denied ever having said these words.|$|E

If you <b>will</b> not <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> me about these things, <b>will</b> you <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> my friend, Jarvis Spencer? He is a gentleman, and a {{journalist}} by profession, {{but he is}} also one of the cleverest amateur detectives in England." ...|$|R

500|$|Locke is {{a member}} of a commune in Humboldt County, California. He {{considers}} its members his new family. One day Locke picks up a young hitchhiker, named Eddie Colburn (Justin Chatwin), who tells him he is leaving home. Eddie joins the commune, but after six weeks, he asks Locke why he is never allowed to {{know what is going on}} in a greenhouse (into which he sees an exceptional amount of fertilizer going). Eddie expresses his discontent with being kept out of the secret and affirms to Locke his desire to be in on [...] "whatever you guys are trying to blow up". Locke laughs and says he <b>will</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> the commune leaders, Mike (Chris Mulkey) and Jan (Virginia Morris).|$|E
500|$|The notes {{show him}} asking: [...] "Who told you that?" [...] When the detectives {{said they had}} witnesses, he {{reportedly}} said: [...] "They are only kids. No {{one is going to}} believe them." [...] The notes say he walked around the interview room with tears in his eyes, saying: [...] "You cunts, you cunts," [...] and [...] "Jesus, Jesus," [...] then: [...] "You ain't got enough evidence. Those kids will never go to court. You wait and see. No one else <b>will</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you. You can't keep me away from them." [...] The notes show him saying of the murder weapons: [...] "You're too slow, man, they gone." [...] He was at that point charged with murder, to which he reportedly responded: [...] "They won't give evidence against me." ...|$|E
500|$|Gallagher {{maintains}} that the rivalry was conceived by the magazine NME and members of Blur's entourage as a ploy to raise their respective profiles, and that since this point he has had no respect for either party. However, Albarn has suggested {{the roots of the}} feud were much more personal. By 2007, the tension between the two had cooled, and in an NME interview, Gallagher said [...] "I've got {{a lot of respect for}} Damon, I really do mean it. Because I'm indifferent to Damon he thinks that I think he's a cunt. Our Liam <b>will</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him, I won't because he's just another singer in a band to me, but I don't think he's a cunt. Good luck to him!" [...] On 23 March 2013, Gallagher, Damon, Graham Coxon and Paul Weller performed the Blur hit [...] "Tender" [...] at the Teenage Cancer Trust. Gallagher provided backing vocals on the song [...] "We Got the Power" [...] with Blur guitarist Graham Coxon, on Albarn's Gorillaz project, from their album Humanz.|$|E

500|$|In Philadelphia, Henry Fairfield Osborn is {{introducing}} artist Charles R. Knight to Edward Drinker Cope, a paleontologist whose entire house {{is filled with}} bones and specimens. Cope is commissioning a painting, something to [...] "catch the spirit" [...] of the sea creature Elasmosaurus (but has unwittingly mistaken its neck for a tail). Cope then leaves for the West, as the official scientist for the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). On the way, he meets Othniel Charles Marsh, a fellow paleontologist, and shows him his dig site at a marl pit in New Jersey; after Cope leaves, Marsh talks to {{the owner of the}} land and pays him off to gain exclusive digging rights. At Fort Bridger, Wyoming, Cope meets Sam Smith, a helper to the USGS. During excavations, Cope finds some of the richest bone veins ever. Sending back carloads of dinosaur bones east by train, Cope encounters Marsh, who is heading out west as well. Marsh travels in style, lounging in coach while the rest of his team travels third class—Marsh even berates them for playing cards, saying it is [...] "low class" [...] and that Yale graduates should look more presentable. [...] At Fort McPherson, Nebraska, Marsh meets [...] "Buffalo" [...] Bill Cody, who serves as their guide, along with the Native American Indian tribe. Marsh discovers many new fossils, and promises to Chief Red Cloud that he <b>will</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> the President of the United States about the situation of the Native Americans—they have been given spoiled food in exchange for their land. Back East, Knight has finished his reconstruction of Elasmosaurus. He and Knight return to the marl pits of New Jersey, but are forced away. Cope becomes furious and storms away when he learns Marsh has bought the digging rights and published a paper revealing his interpretation of Elasmosaurus flawed.|$|E
