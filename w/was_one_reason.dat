5|$|In {{the medieval}} Japan, heian gentleman {{were not very}} {{interested}} in a woman's physical beauty and rarely {{had an opportunity to}} see it. The only physical attribute of interest was a woman's hair, which had to be thick and longer than she was tall. The fascination with long hair <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> why a woman's becoming a nun was regarded with such seriousness— it could never again grow to its full length. This explains why Genji refuses to let Murasaki (his de facto wife in the classical Japanese novel The Tale of Genji) take the tonsure when she is ill.|$|E
5|$|King Henry and King Stephen {{recognised}} Pain as {{the legitimate}} holder of the lands acquired through his wife Sybil. Her kinsman Gilbert de Lacy {{was the son}} of Roger de Lacy, who had been banished from England in 1095 and his English estates confiscated; he had though retained his properties in Normandy. Roger's English possessions were given to his brother Hugh de Lacy, from whom Sybil had inherited them. On Roger's death Gilbert inherited the lands in Normandy, and pressed his claim to the family's former English estates. Coplestone-Crow speculates that the uncertainty hanging over the inheritance <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> why Pain endeavoured to secure more lands around Ludlow.|$|E
5|$|The Mongol Empire's rise gave Western Christians the {{opportunity}} to visit lands {{that they had never}} seen before, and they set out in large numbers along the Empire's secure roads. Belief that a lost Nestorian kingdom existed in the east, or that the Crusader states' salvation depended on an alliance with an Eastern monarch, <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> for the numerous Christian ambassadors and missionaries sent to the Mongols. These include Franciscan explorers Giovanni da Pian del Carpine in 1245 and William of Rubruck in 1253.|$|E

5|$|Active {{military}} service was a long-held dream for Pierce, who had admired his father's and brothers' service in his youth, particularly {{his older brother}} Benjamin's, {{as well as that}} of John McNeil Jr., husband of Pierce's older half-sister Elizabeth. As a legislator, he was a passionate advocate for volunteer militias. As a militia officer himself, he had experience mustering and drilling bodies of troops. When Congress declared war against Mexico in May 1846, Pierce immediately volunteered to join, although no New England regiment yet existed. His hope to fight in the Mexican-American War <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> he refused an offer to become Polk's Attorney General. General Zachary Taylor's advance slowed in northern Mexico, and General Winfield Scott proposed capturing the port of Vera Cruz and driving overland to Mexico City. Congress passed a bill authorizing the creation of ten regiments, and Pierce was appointed colonel and commander of the 9th Infantry Regiment in February 1847, with Truman B. Ransom as lieutenant colonel and second-in-command.|$|E
5|$|Heydrich {{developed}} close professional relationships {{only within}} the circle of the SS security forces. Heinrich Müller was one such example, and Heydrich appears to have trusted him. Adolf Eichmann's straightforward loyalty impressed Heydrich, and <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> why he appointed him as secretary for the Wannsee Conference. Herbert Kappler, who was appointed as commander of all SS security forces in Rome, {{was said to have}} been a protégé of Heydrich. SS personnel favoured by Heydrich, especially those who attended the Wannsee conference, possessed similar traits of devotion to SS, lack of remorse regarding brutal or genocidal orders, and above all personal loyalty to Heydrich in his capacity as commander of the security forces. On the other hand, Heydrich's dislike and distrust of Arthur Nebe and Walter Schellenberg may have stemmed from their independence and ambition.|$|E
5|$|In {{the state}} {{elections}} of 2012, during which {{all members of}} the legislature (but not the governor) were up for election, the shutdown was a major campaign issue. The Republicans lost their majorities in both houses of the legislature, giving the DFL full control of the state government. Kurt Zellers and other Republican legislators said the shutdown probably <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> for their electoral defeat. However, other national and state issues may have had more of an influence on the result. The presidential race was also on the ballot, as were the proposed Minnesota Marriage Amendment and Voter ID Amendment, which had been put on the ballot by the legislature in 2011. All of these ballot items increased the turnout of DFL-leaning voters.|$|E

5|$|In March 2009, Nesbitt {{signed a}} {{contract}} with the American talent agency United Talent Agency, as the global financial crisis was restricting roles in British television. He continued to be represented in the United Kingdom by Artists Rights Group. The next year Nesbitt played the hunter Cathal in the low-budget British horror film Outcast, which was a departure from his previous character types. After screening at major international film festivals in early 2010, the film had a general release {{in the latter part of}} the year. Nesbitt had previously worked with the film's director and co-writer Colm McCarthy on Murphy's Law, which <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> he took the role. He researched the mythical aspects of the character by reading about Irish folklore and beliefs. He also starred alongside Minnie Driver and his Welcome to Sarajevo co-star Goran Višnjić in the Tiger Aspect television serial The Deep. In the five-part drama, Nesbitt played submarine engineer Clem Donnelly. The serial was filmed over 12 weeks at BBC Scotland's studios in Dumbarton. August 2010 saw the release of Nadia Tass's film Matching Jack, in which Nesbitt plays the leading role of Connor. He became involved in the film after reading an early script draft in 2006. In 2008, the global financial crisis severely reduced the budget of the film, and Nesbitt volunteered a reduction in his salary so the film could still be made. The film was shot over eight weeks in Melbourne in 2009 and released in 2010.|$|E

25|$|The 1899 act {{prohibited}} {{the entry of}} immigrants who were not of British or Irish parentage and who could not fill in an application form 'in any European language' – which in practice meant English.

25|$|Kiryas Joel {{played a}} major role in the 2006 Congressional election. The village was at that time in the congressional {{district}} represented by Republican Sue Kelly. Village residents had been loyal to Kelly in the past, but in 2006, voters were upset over what they saw as lack of adequate representation from Kelly for the village. In a bloc, Kiryas Joel swung around 2,900 votes to Kelly's Democratic opponent, John Hall. The vote in Kiryas Joel <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> Hall carried the election, which he did by 4,800 votes.|$|E

25|$|The {{criticism}} of the American Dream, which {{lies at the heart}} of All My Sons, <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> why Arthur Miller was called to appear before the House Un-American Activities Committee during the 1950s, when America was gripped by anti-communist hysteria. Miller sent a copy of the play to Elia Kazan who directed the original stage version of All My Sons. Kazan was a former member of the Communist Party who shared Miller's left-wing views. However, their relationship was destroyed when Kazan gave names of suspected Communists to the House Un-American Activities Committee during the Red Scare.|$|E
25|$|Coming {{from the}} pivotal and swing Midwestern state of Iowa, Harkin has figured {{in the running}} mate {{searches}} multiple times since his 1992 race. Clinton considered Harkin in 1992 because of his ties to labor and strong support {{after he left the}} presidential race. In 2000, Harkin was considered a running mate by then-Vice President Al Gore. However, Harkin's age <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> he was not considered as strongly this time. In 2004, as Senator John Kerry (D-Massachusetts) looked at Harkin as a running mate among other Senate colleagues, though Harkin promoted his protege, then-Governor Tom Vilsack (D-Iowa).|$|E
25|$|The {{success and}} demand for Kngwarreye's {{paintings}} caused her many problems within the community {{as she tried to}} maintain her individual identity. The myth of the woman in her 80s who had never been outside the central desert becoming a great painter <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> for her popularity. She had in fact, been to Perth, Adelaide, Sydney and Canberra, though this was only after she had become famous. There was much pressure from the white community for her to paint in a certain way, when they believed that one of her styles was more successful than others.|$|E

25|$|The Graf Zeppelin {{made another}} {{groundbreaking}} flight in July 1931 with a research {{trip to the}} Arctic (Polarfahrt 1931). This adventure had been a dream of Count Zeppelin 20 years earlier but could not be realized at the time due to the outbreak of World War I. The idea of using an airship to explore the Arctic <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> used to justify both the building of Graf Zeppelin, and the restoration of Germany's right to build airships for commercial purposes. A year earlier Dr. Eckener had piloted the Graf on a three-day trip to Norway and Spitsbergen in July 1930 {{in order to determine}} its performance in this region. This was followed shortly thereafter by a three-day flight to Iceland. Both trips were completed without technical problems.|$|E
25|$|Goddard's serious {{bout with}} {{tuberculosis}} weakened his lungs, affecting {{his ability to}} work, and <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> he liked to work alone, {{in order to avoid}} argument, and confrontation with others and use his time fruitfully. He labored with the prospect of a shorter than average life span. After arriving in Roswell, Goddard applied for life insurance, but when the company doctor examined him he said that Goddard belonged in a bed in Switzerland (where he could get the best care). Goddard's health began to deteriorate further after moving to the humid climate of Maryland to work for the Navy. He was diagnosed with throat cancer in 1945. He continued to work, able to speak only in a whisper, until surgery was required, and he died in August of that year in Baltimore, Maryland. He was buried in Hope Cemetery in his home town of Worcester, Massachusetts.|$|E
25|$|The post of CIGS {{was less}} {{rewarding}} than command {{in an important}} theatre of war but the CIGS chose the generals who commanded those theatres and decided what men and munitions they should have. When it came to finding the right commanders he often complained that many officers {{who would have been}} good commanders had been killed in the First World War and that this <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> behind the difficulties the British had {{in the beginning of the}} war. When General Sir Claude Auchinleck was to be replaced as the commander of the British Eighth Army in 1942, Brooke preferred Lieutenant General Bernard Montgomery instead of Lieutenant General William Gott, who was Churchill's candidate. Soon thereafter Gott was killed in an air crash and Montgomery received the command. Brooke would later reflect upon the tragic event which led to the appointment of Montgomery as an intervention by God. Earlier in 1942 Brooke had been offered the command of British forces in the Middle East. Brooke declined, believing he now knew better than any other general how to deal with Churchill.|$|E
