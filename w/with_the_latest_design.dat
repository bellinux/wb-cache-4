40|$|Abstract: An actual cultural-heritage-related {{problem is}} how to {{effectively}} manage the global distribution of digitized cultural and scientific information, {{taking into account that}} such a global distribution is only doable through the Internet. Hence, adequately designing software applications realizing brokerage functionality in the global space, particularly concerning digitized cultural/scientific information, is to be considered as an essential cultural-heritage-related task. However, due to its great complexity, the usage of the existing popular modelling instrumentarium seems insufficiently useful; this is mainly because the realization of a satisfactory cultural-heritage brokering requires a deep understanding and consideration of the original business reality. Inspired by this challenge, we have aimed at exploring relevant strengths of the SDBC approach which is currently being developed. SDBC’s being capable of properly aligning business process modelling and software specification, allowing for re-use and being consistent <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> software <b>design</b> standards, are among the facts in support of the claim that SDBC could bring value concerning the design of cultural-heritage-related brokerage applications. Hence, in this paper we motivate and illustrate the usefulness of SDBC for the cultural-heritage sector. ...|$|R
40|$|The Future Circular Collider (FCC) {{study at}} CERN is {{investigating}} {{the design of a}} proton-proton collider with a center of mass energy of 100 TeV and a tunnel circumference of 100 km (FCC-hh). Nb_ 3 Sn arc dipoles with 50 -mm aperture and 16 -T operating field are required for this application. Among the possible magnetic layouts, block coils offer attractive features, in terms of conductor packing, separation between high-field and high-stress locations, use of flat cables, and simpler geometries for windings and parts. In order to assess these potential advantages, the HD series of block-coil models was developed at LBNL. These models achieved fields of 15 - 16 T in technology tests, and 13 - 14 T in accelerator relevant configurations, with bore diameters of 36 - 43 mm. In this paper, we discuss the implications of increasing the bore diameter to 50 mm, which is consistent <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> FCC-hh <b>design</b> targets.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a review of}} early gas cooled reactors including the Magnox reactors originating in the United Kingdom and the subsequent development of the Advanced Gas-cooled Reactors (AGR). These early gas cooled reactors shared a common coolant medium, namely carbon dioxide (CO 2). A framework of information is provided about these early reactors and identifies unique problems/opportunities associated with use of CO 2 as a coolant. Reactor designers successfully rose to these challenges. After years of successful use of the CO 2 gas cooled reactors in Europe, the succeeding generation of reactors, called the High Temperature Gas Reactors (HTGR), were designed with Helium gas as the coolant. Again, in the 21 st century, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> reactor <b>designs</b> under investigation in Generation IV, there is a revived interest in developing Gas Cooled Fast Reactors that use CO 2 as the reactor coolant.

40|$|Agile {{software}} development practices encourage the evolutionary paradigm of software construction. The {{result is a}} series of changes made to the code and designs starting from an initial version. However, rarely do designs keep pace with the changes in code - rather they are often outdated with the first few releases. The problem is only compounded by the various design representations that together comprise the design (state diagrams, class diagrams etc.). This adversely affects development since it is best {{to begin the process of}} evolution <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> <b>design</b> representation that is consistent with the code since it provides a high level view of the system that is easy to understand. Such evolutionary practices therefore present three main challenges from a development environment perspective: (1) Consistency amongst different design representations (2) Traceability of design into code and vice versa (3) Versioning of designs along with code to maintain a consistent view of the application evolution. Our research presents solutions to all three issues starting from a relational meta-model of development and design entities. We have already published results that showcase our solution to the first two problems - in this paper we present an algorithm to version design and code so that the developer always sees a consistent snapshot and prove that this algorithm satisfies the safety requirements of consistency. We also outline an architecture rooted in the layered SCM model to support our versioning scheme. © IEE...|$|E

40|$|Developments of {{surgical}} attachments for bone-anchored prostheses are {{slowly but surely}} winning over the initial disbelief in the orthopedic community. Clearly, this option is becoming accessible {{to a wide range}} of individuals with limb loss. Seminal studies have demonstrated that the pioneering procedure relying on screw-type fixation engenders major clinical benefits and acceptable safety. The surgical procedure for press-fit implants, such as the Integral-Leg-Prosthesis (ILP) has been described Dr Aschoff and his team. Some clinical benefits of press-fit implants have been also established. Here, his team is once again taking a leading role by sharing the progression over 15 years of the rate of deep infections for 69 individuals with transfemoral amputation fitted with three successive refined versions of the ILP. By definition, a double-blind randomized clinical trial to test the effect of different fixation’s design is difficult. Alternatively, Juhnke and colleagues are reporting the outcomes of action-research study for a cohort of participants. The first and foremost important outcome of this study is the confirmation that the current design of the IPL and rehabilitation program are altogether leading to an acceptable rate of deep infection and other adverse events (e. g., structural failure of implant, periprosthetic factures). This study is also providing a strong insight onto the effect of major phases in redesign of an implant on the risk of infection. This is an important reminder that the development of a successful osseointegrated implant is unlikely to be immediate but the results of a learning curve made of empirical and sequential changes led by a reflective clinical practice. Clearly, this study provided better understanding of the safety of the ILP surgical and rehabilitation procedure while establishing standards and benchmark data for future studies focusing on design and infection of press-fit implants. Complementary observations of relationship between infection and cofounders such as loading of the prosthesis and prosthetic components used would be beneficial. Further definitive evidences of the clinical benefits <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> <b>design</b> would be valuable, although an increase in health related quality of life and functional outcomes are likely to be confirmed. Altogether, the authors are providing compelling evidence that bone-anchored attachments particularly those relying on press-fit implants are an established alternative to socket prostheses...|$|E

40|$|The current DLR project GOSSAMER aims at {{establishing}} solar sails as {{a powerful}} and reliable propulsion technique for future space missions. The solar sail propulsion technique basically uses the transfer of momentum from solar photons to a large foil which has been deployed in space and is connected <b>with</b> a payload. <b>The</b> <b>latest</b> <b>design</b> of <b>the</b> GOSSAMER solar sail will use a thin polyimide foil covered {{on both sides with}} a 100 nm layer of Aluminium. However, the aging of the foil in a space environment, especially changes in the specular reflectance of the surface, has to be studied very carefully to ensure a proper performance of a solar sail spacecraft over long mission periods. One possible degradation effect is presented: the blistering of the Aluminium surface under proton irradiation. Protons that were stopped in a metal can recombine with free electrons to H-atoms and can finally form bubbles of H 2 within in the material. It depends on several parameters whether this recombination leads to the formation of blisters at the surface of the metal: the energy of the protons, the proton dose, the thermal conditions, the solubility of hydrogen in the metal, impurities, and defects in the material. Previous published laboratory studies showed that blisters on Aluminium surfaces occur at relatively low proton energies (< 100 keV) and high dosages (1016 to 1018 protons/cm²) ...|$|R
