500|$|The {{final chapter}} begins with {{examples}} of sexual dimorphism, such as [...] "the antlers of the stag, the spurs of the cock... and the gorgeous plumes found in the males of the birds of paradise", with other examples chosen from across the animal kingdom. Darwin's theory of sexual selection is explained; Beddard then states the objection that female birds must be supposed to have [...] "a highly-developed aesthetic sense" [...] to choose between similar-looking males, and worse, that females of closely related species must have [...] "immense" [...] different tastes. He concludes, though, that the question cannot be answered by <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>consider</b> improbable, but requires [...] "actual observation". He calls Poulton's arguments for sexual selection [...] "very ingenious", but writes that Wallace's two different (non-selective) explanations [...] "might both be accepted". He concludes that [...] "it {{is quite possible that}} sexual selection may have played a subordinate part" [...] in producing sexually dimorphic coloration.|$|E

500|$|Troutman, {{seeing the}} disarray that was {{surrounding}} Clinton at the time, accepted Warner Bros. offer of {{more money for}} the demo recordings of his album. The move resulted in a bitter severing of partnerships between Clinton and Troutman, and with Clinton's departure, Troutman was left to exercise virtually full creative control over the band's later work. In Clinton's biography George Clinton: For the Record, Troutman was quoted commenting on the situation with a blasé attitude, [...] "... Heck gee-willickers, Warner Bros. offered me mo' money". In response, Clinton remarked, [...] "CBS paid for it, I paid for it. I don't like {{to go into it}} on the negative side, but it cost about 5 million , and a lot of people's jobs and <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>consider</b> as the empire falling". [...] The loss of money that resulted from the actions of Troutman, is credited as one of the factors that disassembled both Clinton's and Funkadelic's musical careers. [...] The Many Facets of Roger was eventually released in August 1981 on Warner Bros.|$|E
500|$|On August 13, 2007, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice {{announced}} that Ripken {{had been named}} Special Sports Envoy for the US State Department {{and that he would}} be going to China in October: [...] "...we're just delighted that somebody of Cal Ripken's stature is going to be someone who will go out and represent America so well and represent <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>consider</b> to be American values, but universal values; that hard work and diligence and the willingness to really put it all on the line every day is something that kids need to learn", said Rice. [...] "A Shortstop in China" [...] premiered on the Mid-Atlantic Sports Network on May 8, 2009, chronicling Ripken's trip to China to share the game of baseball with youth and coaches while nurturing American-Chinese diplomacy. The documentary included footage from the 11 clinics Cal and former Oriole B.J. Surhoff held from Beijing to Guangzhou. The documentary also showed Ripken accepting his appointment from Rice and featured a variety of interviews, from Ripken's wife Kelly to former Undersecretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs, Karen Hughes.|$|E

2500|$|Goodall is {{best known}} for her study of {{chimpanzee}} social and family life. She began studying the Kasakela chimpanzee community in Gombe Stream National Park, Tanzania, in 1960. Without collegiate training directing her research, Goodall observed things that strict scientific doctrines may have overlooked. Instead of numbering the chimpanzees she observed, she gave them names such as Fifi and David Greybeard, and observed them to have unique and individual personalities, an unconventional idea at the time. She found that, [...] "it isn't only human beings who have personality, who are capable of rational thought [...] emotions like joy and sorrow." [...] She also observed behaviours such as hugs, kisses, pats on the back, and even tickling, <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>consider</b> [...] "human" [...] actions. Goodall insists that these gestures are evidence of [...] "the close, supportive, affectionate bonds that develop between family members and other individuals within a community, which can persist throughout a life span of more than 50 years." [...] These findings suggest that similarities between humans and chimpanzees exist in more than genes alone, but can be seen in emotion, intelligence, and family and social relationships.|$|E

2500|$|Swans' {{music has}} {{transformed}} greatly over the decades, but is typically dark and [...] "apocalyptic", often focusing on themes of power, religion, sex and death, {{and has been}} most generally associated with experimental rock. According to Spin, the band demonstrates [...] "unparalleled ability to translate the absurd violence {{of the human condition}} into music that’s as intoxicating as it is intense." [...] Swans' early work, rooted in the New York City-based no wave movement which was fading out by the time their formation in 1982, is extremely aggressive, characterized by Michael Gira as [...] "stripping down the essential elements of <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>consider</b> to be rock music". The Guardian described it as [...] "a cacophonous rhythmic throb which drew on post punk, industrial, doom metal, NYC avant minimalism and the blues; a sound which was matched by Gira's often nihilistic, anti-natalist and existential lyrical concerns ... delivered in a stentorian and messianic manner." [...] It was an important contribution to both industrial music and noise rock and influenced the emergence of grindcore (inspiring also the use of [...] "grind" [...] in musical context) and sludge metal. Later in the 1980s, Swans' music began to incorporate more melodic and intricate elements, especially since Jarboe's debut as a songwriter on 1987's Children of God. While generally maintaining much dissonance, the band's subsequent work further ventured into genres such as post-punk, gothic rock, neofolk, psychedelic rock and art rock. Their final album before breaking up, 1996's Soundtracks for the Blind, is a double album which emphasizes atmosphere, a contribution to the post-rock, drone and dark ambient genres. Since re-forming in 2010, Swans have continued to be associated with post-rock and drone music as well as noise rock. Their last three double albums, which have brought them widespread critical acclaim, often feature long songs that develop complex soundscapes.|$|E
