25|$|Sackville-West was {{a writer}} and author of novels. The Edwardians (1930) and All Passion Spent (1931) are perhaps her best-known novels today. In the latter, the elderly Lady Slane courageously embraces a long {{suppressed}} sense of freedom and whimsy {{after a lifetime of}} convention. This novel was dramatised by the BBC in 1986 starring Dame Wendy Hiller. All Passion Spent appears to reflect Woolf's influence, as Lady Slane, who has only existed while married to her late husband, a former prime minister, finally begins to live after his death, and becomes friends with the servants on her estate, discovering that the lives of people she had ignored until then are also interesting. At the end of the novel, Lady Slane persuades her granddaughter to break off an arranged marriage to pursue her career as a musician. Sackville-West took up writing again in 1930 after a six-year break {{for a variety of reasons}} as she needed money to pay for the Sissinghurst Castle which had just been purchased; Nicolson having left the Foreign Office no longer had a diplomat's salary to draw upon; she had to pay tuition for her two sons to attend Eton, one of the most expensive public schools in England; and it because she felt she had become a better writer thanks to the mentorship of Woolf who had taught her how to <b>write</b> <b>better.</b>|$|E

While there, he played clarinet {{in the school}} band and became a co-editor (along with [...] Madelyn Pugh) for the Tuesday edition of the school newspaper, The Shortridge Echo. Vonnegut said his tenure with the Echo allowed him to write for a large audience—his fellow students—rather than for a teacher, an experience he said was [...] "fun and easy". [...] "It just turned out that I could <b>write</b> <b>better</b> {{than a lot of}} other people", Vonnegut observed. [...] "Each person has something he can do easily and can't imagine why everybody else has so much trouble doing it." ...|$|E

The artist had {{not come up with}} a date for the release, stating: [...] "Until it's done ... It's gotta be just as good if not better". On March 25, 2015, the singer-songwriter was interviewed by that's Shanghai {{magazine}} and provided some details of the new album, confirming Mark Ronson and Jeff Bhasker as producers. He added: [...] "I want to <b>write</b> <b>better</b> songs, I want to put on better shows, I want to make better music videos. I want my next album to be better than the first and the second".

500|$|... "Gossip" [...] {{was written}} and {{directed}} by Paul Lieberstein, a producer and screenwriter for the series who also plays Toby. The episode confirmed the fact that Pam was pregnant, which was strongly hinted in the fifth season finale, [...] "Company Picnic". [...] "Gossip" [...] was the first episode to feature Ellie Kemper as a full cast member; she had guest starred in several episodes {{at the end of the}} fifth season as receptionist Erin Hannon. It was also the first episode of The Office to air since the release of the Ed Helms comedy film The Hangover. The film was a surprise box office success, grossing more than twice the amount of The 40-Year Old Virgin, which established Steve Carell as a comedy movie star. Commentators were split on what the success would mean for The Office, with some believing it would allow the show's writers to better realize his potential and <b>write</b> <b>better</b> material for Helms, and others expressing concern Helms would not be as dedicated to the Andy Bernard role. One of the interns, portrayed by Elvy Yost, also appeared in an earlier episode from season four, [...] "Job Fair".|$|E
500|$|... "Enter Sandman" [...] was {{the first}} song Metallica had written for their 1991 eponymous album, Metallica. Metallica's songwriting {{at that time was}} done mainly by rhythm guitarist James Hetfield and drummer Lars Ulrich, after they {{gathered}} tapes of song ideas and concepts from {{the other members of the}} band, lead guitarist Kirk Hammett and bassist Jason Newsted. Ulrich's house in Berkeley, California was used for this purpose. [...] "Enter Sandman" [...] evolved from a guitar riff that Hammett wrote. Originally, the riff was two bars in length, but Ulrich suggested the first bar be played three times. The instrumental parts of the song were quickly finished, but Hetfield did not come up with vocal melodies and lyrics for a long time. The song was among the album's last to have lyrics, and the lyrics featured in the song are not the original; Hetfield felt that [...] "Enter Sandman" [...] sounded [...] "catchy and kind of commercial" [...] and so to counterbalance the sound, he wrote lyrics about [...] "destroy the perfect family; a huge horrible secret in a family" [...] that included references to crib death. For the first time in Metallica's history, however, Ulrich and producer Bob Rock told Hetfield that they felt he could <b>write</b> <b>better</b> lyrics. Nevertheless, according to Ulrich, the song was the [...] "foundation, the guide to the whole record" [...] even before it had lyrics.|$|E

2500|$|Because it was Rock's {{first time}} {{producing}} a Metallica album, {{he had the}} band make the album in different ways; he asked them to record songs collaboratively rather than individually in separate locations.

2500|$|At Craiglockhart, Sassoon met Wilfred Owen, {{a fellow}} poet who would {{eventually}} exceed him in fame. It was thanks to Sassoon that Owen persevered in his ambition to <b>write</b> <b>better</b> poetry. A manuscript copy of Owen's Anthem for Doomed Youth containing Sassoon's handwritten amendments survives as {{testimony to the}} extent of his influence and is currently on display at London's Imperial War Museum. Sassoon became to Owen [...] "Keats and Christ and Elijah"; surviving documents demonstrate clearly the depth of Owen's love and admiration for him. Both men returned to active service in France, but Owen was killed in 1918, just a week before Armistice. Sassoon, despite all this, was promoted to lieutenant, and having spent some time out of danger in Palestine, eventually returned to the Front. On 13 July 1918, Sassoon was almost immediately wounded again—by friendly fire when he {{was shot in the head}} by a fellow British soldier who had mistaken him for a German near Arras, France. As a result, he spent the remainder of the war in Britain. By this time he had been promoted to acting captain. He relinquished his commission on health grounds on 12 March 1919, but was allowed to retain the rank of captain.|$|E

The music for [...] "California Girls" [...] came from this first LSD experience, as did much of the group's subsequent work where they would partake in drug use during recording sessions.

2500|$|The {{first of}} the {{negative}} reviews was written by William Hazlitt, literary critic and Romantic writer. He reviewed the collection of poems for the 2 June 1816 Examiner, and, in his analysis, he attacked the fragmentary {{nature of the work}} and argued, [...] "The fault of Mr Coleridge is, that he comes to no conclusion ... from an excess of capacity, he does little or nothing" [...] and that the poem revealed that [...] "Mr Coleridge can <b>write</b> <b>better</b> nonsense verse than any man in English." [...] In conclusion, Hazlitt admitted, [...] "We could repeat these lines to ourselves not the less often for not knowing the meaning of them." [...] Following in the June 1816 Eclectic Review, Josiah Conder dismissed the poem: [...] "As to 'Kubla Khan', and the 'Pains of Sleep', we can only regret the publication of them, as affording a proof that the Author over-rates the importance of his name. With regard to the former, which is professedly published as a psychological curiosity, it having been composed during sleep, there appears to us nothing in the quality of the lines to render this circumstance extraordinary." [...] He then continued by focusing on {{the manner in which the}} poem was composed, 'We could have informed Mr. Coleridge of a reverend friend of ours, who actually wrote down two sermons on a passage in the Apocalypse, from the recollection of the spontaneous exercise of his faculties in sleep. To persons who are in the habit of poetical composition, a similar phenomenon would not be a stranger occurrence, than the spirited dialogues in prose which take place in dreams of persons of duller invention than our poet, and which not unfrequently leave behind a very vivid impression." ...|$|E
