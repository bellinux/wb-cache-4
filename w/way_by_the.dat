5|$|In skaldic poetry, {{the name}} Hlín is {{frequent}} in kennings for women. Examples include Hlín hringa ("Hlín of rings"), Hlín goðvefjar ("Hlín of velvet") and arm-Hlín ("arm-Hlín"). The name is already used frequently in this <b>way</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> 10th-century poet Kormákr Ögmundarson and remains current in skaldic poetry through the following centuries, employed by poets such as Þórðr Kolbeinsson, Gizurr Þorvaldsson and Einarr Gilsson. The name remained frequently used in woman kennings in rímur poetry, sometimes as Lín.|$|E

Near the end of the video, Royce and Eminem try to stand in front of each other for attention. The video ends with them being pushed out of the <b>way</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Bad Meets Evil logo. The video became notable for its humorous content.|$|E

He is {{attacked}} on the <b>way</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> shadow, which destroys his staff, but Ged escapes into the Court of Terrenon. Serret, {{the lady of the}} castle, shows him the stone of Terrenon, and tempts Ged to speak to it, claiming it can give him limitless knowledge and power. Believing the stone harbors an evil spirit, Ged refuses. Realizing that the servants of the stone wish to enslave him, he flees. He is pursued by the stone's minions but transforms into a falcon and flies away.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the arrival}} of the {{relieving}} force, Pyrrhus lifted the siege and prepared to winter in Laconia. However, he was approached by an Argive citizen who requested his assistance in overthrowing the government of Argos. Seeking {{to take advantage of the}} opportunity, Antigonus took his army to Argos, being harried along the <b>way</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Spartans. Whilst attempting to seize Argos by night, Pyrrhus was set upon by his Argive opponents as well as the Spartans and Antigonus' Macedonians. In the ensuing mêlée, Pyrrhus was slain. His death prompted the capitulation of his army and the reestablishment of a Macedonian hegemony over Greece.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the series}} of battles around Baykand, the Turgesh retired north to Samarkand, where they {{assaulted}} the fortress of Kamarja, while Ashras with his troops besieged Bukhara and wintered in its oasis. Warfare did not die down, however, and the Arabs' situation remained precarious: when, in early 730, Ashras' newly appointed successor Junayd ibn Abd al-Rahman al-Murri tried to reach the army, which was still encamped in the Bukhara oasis, {{he had to be}} escorted from Amul by 7,000 cavalry who were attacked on the <b>way</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Turgesh and almost destroyed. Although Bukhara was recovered by the Arabs at this time, either under Ashras or under Junayd, in the very next year the latter led the Khurasani army to disaster in the Battle of the Defile, an event which shattered the tenuous Arab control over what remained of their possessions in Transoxiana. The Arabs were not able to recover their position until the governorship of Nasr ibn Sayyar, who in 739–741 managed to re-establish the Caliphate's authority up to Samarkand.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} few days PATU and RLI patrols arrested five insurgents, two of whom were deserters. One of these {{defected}} and agreed to guide the security forces to the ZIPRA base camp, where he said there were two guerrillas waiting for him to return, unaware of his desertion and subsequent defection. Shown the <b>way</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> ex-cadre an RLI patrol attacked the camp on 24 January and killed one of the two; the other fled and was captured a few days later. The members of Gang 1 were now all killed or captured while only one was outstanding from Gang 2. Gangs 3 and 4 were revealed to be near Sipolilo on 21 January by a black shopkeeper, and two Gang 3 members were encountered by Henson's troop on 24 January. Henson himself opened fire and killed one, who it emerged was the Gang 3 commander. His troop then followed about 10 men until 26 January, when they lost the insurgents' tracks.|$|E

5|$|The FIA {{introduced}} {{more stringent}} {{tests on the}} cars at the Malaysian race to ensure floor mounting systems used by Ferrari and BMW Sauber were not in breach of the regulations. After the first race {{of the season in}} Australia, the McLaren team had requested clarification of the rules regarding systems that allowed the front of the car's undertray to move upwards under aerodynamic loading at high speed. Autosport magazine reported that this movement would potentially increase straight line speed. Massa and Räikkönen said the performance of the Ferrari F2007 car would not be compromised in any <b>way</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> required modifications.|$|E
5|$|The Portuguese {{government}} forced black Mozambican {{farmers to}} grow rice or cotton for export, providing little return {{with which the}} farmers could support themselves. Many other workers—over 250,000 by 1960—were pressured to work on coal and gold mines, in neighbouring territories, mainly in South Africa, where they comprised over 30% of black underground miners. By 1950, only 4,353 Mozambicans out of 5,733,000 had been granted {{the right to vote}} by the Portuguese colonial government. The rift between Portuguese settlers and Mozambican locals is illustrated in one <b>way</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> small number of people with mixed Portuguese and Mozambican heritage (mestiço), numbering only 31,465 in a population of 8–10 million in 1960 according to that year's census.|$|E
5|$|Udall imposed {{the freeze}} on any {{projects}} involving land claimed by Alaska Natives {{in hopes that}} an overarching Native claims settlement would result. In the fall of 1969, the Department of the Interior and TAPS set about bypassing the land freeze by obtaining waivers from the various native villages that had claims to {{a portion of the}} proposed right of <b>way.</b> <b>By</b> <b>the</b> end of September, all the relevant villages had waived their right-of-way claims, and Secretary of the Interior Wally Hickel asked Congress to lift the land freeze for the entire TAPS project. After several months of questioning by the House and Senate committees with oversight of the project, Hickel was given the authority to lift the land freeze and give the go-ahead to TAPS.|$|E

5|$|Under the Scotland Act 1998, {{ordinary}} {{general elections}} for the Scottish Parliament are held on the first Thursday in May every four years (1999, 2003, 2007 and so on). The date of the poll may be varied by up to one month either <b>way</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Monarch on the proposal of the Presiding Officer. If the Parliament itself resolves {{that it should be}} dissolved (with at least two-thirds of the Members voting in favour), or if the Parliament fails to nominate one of its members to be First Minister within 28 days of a General Election or of the position becoming vacant, the Presiding Officer proposes a date for an extraordinary general election and the Parliament is dissolved by the Queen by royal proclamation. Extraordinary general elections are in addition to ordinary general elections, unless held less than six months before the due date of an ordinary general election, in which case they supplant it. The following ordinary election reverts to the first Thursday in May, a multiple of four years after 1999 (i.e., 5 May 2011, 7 May 2015, etc.).|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the report}} {{produced}} by the OIR, by 1957 the CIA realized that its version {{of the history of}} the Árbenz government and the coup were not gaining traction. Books written by defenders of the Árbenz government, which were strongly critical of the US intervention, were generally better received. Nationalist Latin Americans were inclined to view the Castillo Armas government as a creation of the US. As a result, the US government decided to allow Ronald Schneider, a historian who was in the process of completing his Ph.D, to access the PBHistory archive. Scheider published Communism in Guatemala: 1944 to 1954 in 1959. Later observers have stated that the publication may have been subsidized in some <b>way</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> CIA: both the Foreign Policy Research Institute, where Schneider worked, and Frederick A. Praeger, who published Schneider's book, received CIA funds. Schneider stated in his book that the Comite was responsible for collecting the documents he accessed, but did not mention the CIA's role in funding the Comite, nor did he explain how the documents came to the US. Schneider's book did not rely on PBHistory material alone, but also on information that Schneider gathered during a trip to Mexico and Guatemala in 1957. The book was generally well received.|$|E

Telmisartan is, on the other hand, in part metabolized by glucuronidation and olmesartan is excreted as the unchanged drug.|$|E
