In 1960 Bradlee toured with both Kennedy and Richard Nixon in their presidential campaigns. He later wrote a book, Conversations With Kennedy (W.W. Norton, 1975), recounting their relationship during those years. Bradlee was, at this point, <b>Washington</b> <b>Bureau</b> <b>chief</b> for Newsweek, a position from which he helped negotiate {{the sale of the}} magazine to The Washington Post holding company. Bradlee maintained that position until being promoted to managing editor at the Post in 1965. He became executive editor in 1968.|$|E

25|$|The Journal {{claims to}} have sent the first news report, on the Dow Jones wire, of a plane {{crashing}} into the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. Its headquarters, at One World Financial Center, was severely damaged {{by the collapse of}} the World Trade Center just across the street. Top editors worried that they might miss publishing the first issue {{for the first time in}} the paper's 112-year history. They relocated to a makeshift office at an editor's home, while sending most of the staff to Dow Jones's South Brunswick, N.J., corporate campus, where the paper had established emergency editorial facilities soon after the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. The paper was on the stands the next day, albeit in scaled-down form. Perhaps the most compelling story in that day's edition was a first-hand account of the Twin Towers' collapse written by then-Foreign Editor (and current <b>Washington</b> <b>bureau</b> <b>chief)</b> John Bussey, who holed up in a ninth-floor Journal office, literally in the shadow of the towers, from where he phoned in live reports to CNBC as the towers burned. He narrowly escaped serious injury when the first tower collapsed, shattering all the windows in the Journal offices and filling them with dust and debris. The Journal won a 2002 Pulitzer Prize in Breaking News Reporting for that day's stories.|$|E

500|$|Clinton's {{choice was}} criticized as {{unconventional}} because rather than picking {{a running mate}} who would diversify the ticket, Clinton chose a fellow Southerner who shared his political ideologies and who was nearly {{the same age as}} Clinton. The <b>Washington</b> <b>Bureau</b> <b>Chief</b> for The Baltimore Sun, Paul West, later suggested that, [...] "Al Gore revolutionized the way Vice Presidents are made. When he joined Bill Clinton's ticket, it violated the old rules. Regional diversity? Not with two Southerners from neighboring states. Ideological balance? A couple of left-of-center moderates. [...] And yet, Gore has come to be regarded by strategists in both parties as the best vice presidential pick in at least 20 years." ...|$|E
500|$|The strike added new {{costs to}} all newspapers, and {{increased}} the Tribune's losses to $4.2 million while slashing its circulation to 282,000.

The paper also lost long-established talent, including Marguerite Higgins, Earl Mazo and <b>Washington</b> <b>bureau</b> <b>chief</b> Robert Donovan. Whitney, however, remained committed to the Tribune, and promoted James Bellows to editor of the newspaper.

500|$|On June 13, 2008, {{upon the}} death of NBC News <b>Washington</b> <b>Bureau</b> <b>Chief</b> and Meet the Press {{moderator}} Tim Russert, who was a proud Buffalo native, Brown ordered that all flags on city property be lowered to half-staff in order to honor Russert's memory. Brown called Russert one of Buffalo's finest ambassadors, and his decision to lower the flags in honor of Russert, a civilian who never held elected office, was an unusual gesture that was described as breathtaking on Hardball with Chris Matthews by Tom Brokaw. He was joined by several other officials in recognizing Russert. [...] Chief among those was United States President George W.
