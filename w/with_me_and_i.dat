The filmmakers, in trying actors out for Shad's part, looked for someone [...] "at least 6'2 and physically massive...any ethnicity." [...] (Rhames is African American). Reynolds played Congressman Dilbeck, and he based his performance after politicians he knew {{in his early}} life, through his father, a police chief. Reynolds was not an actor that the filmmakers originally had in mind for the part, but Reynolds wanted it, contacted Castle Rock head Rob Reiner, and traveled to Miami to audition. [...] He accepted a salary lower than what he had made in his earlier career. Moore's own daughter Rumer Willis, who was 7 years old when the film was released, played Erin's daughter Angela. As Moore explained, [...] "she [...] wanted it so badly" [...] that Moore asked that Willis be considered for the part. In reality this required Willis to see Moore dancing topless, for {{a scene in which}} Angela sees Erin performing.

It contains tour footage from 108 shows {{that took place in}} 78 cities, 32 countries, and 6 continents in the presence of 1.1 million fans around the world. The show is a combination of performance clips from the tour, as well as backstage moments. I Am... World Tour also serves as the directorial debut for Beyoncé. On this occasion, she confessed that {{it was a lot of}} work for her. Nevertheless, she was very happy and eager for her fans to see her DVD directed by herself. She explained, [...] "I'm so excited – this is my directorial debut. I am just thrilled that my fans are going to be in the theatre <b>with</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> can't wait for everyone to see it. It took me nine months to edit because I wanted to show a little bit of each show, each performance on tour, and it was 116 shows, so you can only imagine how much work it was, [...] it was worth it." [...] At the New York City screening of the DVD, Beyoncé further explained that she was completely [...] "hands-on", deciding which moments made the final cut and which ones wound up on the cutting-room floor, stating, [...] "It was hard work. I learned so much. I have a new respect for directors and I think I would like to do more of it." [...] Some of the behind-the-scenes footage were shot by Beyoncé on her laptop. The DVD captures concert footage from cities in Europe, Asia, South America, and the United States, all edited into one concert. However, I Am... World Tour was significantly recorded at London's larger O2 Arena, a few months after the I Am... Yours concert. A live CD of the concert, a behind-the-scenes documentary of her life along the tour and a 20-page book of exclusive photos are all included in the package.

500|$|Minh instead {{arrived to}} find that the {{brothers}} were not in the palace. In anticipation of a coup, they had ordered the construction of three separate tunnels leading from Gia Long to remote areas outside the palace. Around 20:00 {{on the night of the}} coup, with only the Presidential Guard to defend them against mutinous infantry and armor units, Diệm and Nhu hurriedly packed American banknotes into a briefcase. They escaped through one of the tunnels with two loyalists: Air Force Lieutenant Ðỗ Thơ, Diệm's aide-de-camp, who happened to be a nephew of Colonel Đỗ Mậu, the director of military security and a participant in the coup plot, and Xuân Vy, head of Nhu's Republican Youth. After the coup, General Paul Harkins, the head of the US presence in Vietnam, inspected the tunnel and noted that it [...] "was so far down that I didn't want to go down to walk up the thing". The brothers emerged in a wooded area in a park near the Cercle Sportif, the city's upper class sporting club, where they were picked up by a waiting Land Rover. Ellen Hammer disputes the tunnel escape, asserting that the Ngo brothers simply walked out of the building, which was not yet under siege. Hammer asserts that they walked past the tennis courts and left the palace grounds through a small gate at Le Thanh Ton Street and entered the car. The loyalists traveled through narrow back streets in order to evade rebel checkpoints and changed vehicles to a black Citroën sedan. After leaving the palace, Nhu was reported to have suggested to Diệm that the brothers split up, arguing that this would enhance their chances of survival. Nhu proposed that one of them travel to the Mekong Delta to join Cao's IV Corps, while the other would travel to the II Corps of General Nguyễn Khánh in the Central Highlands. Nhu felt the rebel generals would not dare to kill one of them while the other was free, in case the surviving brother were to regain power. According to one account, Diệm was reported to have turned down Nhu, reasoning that [...] "You cannot leave alone. They hate you too much; they will kill you. Stay <b>with</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> will protect you." [...] Another story holds that Diệm said [...] "We have always been together during these last years. How could we separate during these last years? How could we separate in this critical hour?" [...] Nhu agreed to remain with his brother.|$|E

2500|$|It was at {{this time}} that he became {{interested}} in the foundations of mathematics, particularly after reading Bertrand Russell's The Principles of Mathematics (1903), and Gottlob Frege's The Foundations of Arithmetic, vol. 1 (1893) and vol. 2 (1903). Wittgenstein's sister Hermine said he became obsessed with mathematics as a result, and was anyway losing interest in aeronautics. He decided instead that he needed to study logic and the foundations of mathematics, describing himself as in a [...] "constant, indescribable, almost pathological state of agitation." [...] In the summer of 1911 he visited Frege at the University of Jena to show him some philosophy of mathematics and logic he had written, and to ask whether it was worth pursuing. He wrote: [...] "I was shown into Frege's study. Frege was a small, neat man with a pointed beard who bounced around the room as he talked. He absolutely wiped the floor <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> felt very depressed; but at the end he said 'You must come again', so I cheered up. I had several discussions with him after that. Frege would never talk about anything but logic and mathematics, if I started on some other subject, he would say something polite and then plunge back into logic and mathematics." ...|$|E
2500|$|At school, Garner had {{developed}} {{a keen interest in}} the work of Aeschylus and Homer, as well as the Ancient Greek language. Thus, he decided to pursue the study of Classics at Magdalen College, Oxford, passing his entrance exams in January 1953; at the time he had thoughts of becoming a professional academic. He was the first member of his family to receive anything more than a basic education, and he noted that this removed him from his [...] "cultural background" [...] and led to something of a schism with other members of his family, who [...] "could not cope <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> could not cope with" [...] them. Looking back, he remarked, [...] "I soon learned {{that it was not a}} good idea to come home excited over irregular verbs". In 1955, he joined the university theatrical society, playing the role of Mark Antony in a performance of William Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra where he co-starred alongside Dudley Moore and where Kenneth Baker was the stage manager. In August 1956, he decided that he wished to devote himself to novel writing, and decided to abandon his university education without taking a degree; he left Oxford in late 1956. He nevertheless felt that the academic rigour which he learned during his university studies has remained [...] "a permanent strength through all my life".|$|E

So it's not worthwhile filling it with keywords to kind of hope that it works that way. In general, we try to recognize when a title tag is stuffed with keywords because that's also a bad user experience for users in the search results. If they're looking to understand what these pages are about and they just see a jumble of keywords, then that doesn't really help.Moz has already been cited as assigning critical importance to the Title tags.
