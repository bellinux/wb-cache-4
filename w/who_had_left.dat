5|$|At Great Lakes, Collier went {{regularly}} {{to observe the}} practices of the station's service football team, the Great Lakes Bluejackets.

5|$|Banned {{from the}} palace and shunned {{by his own}} father, {{for the next several}} years the Prince of Wales was {{identified}} with opposition to George I's policies, which included measures designed to increase religious freedom in Great Britain and expand Hanover's German territories at the expense of Sweden. His new London residence, Leicester House, became a frequent meeting place for his father's political opponents, including Sir Robert Walpole and Viscount Townshend, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>left</b> the government in 1717.|$|E
5|$|For 1968, Austrian Jochen Rindt {{replaced}} Hulme, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>left</b> to join McLaren. Repco {{produced a}} more powerful version of their V8 to maintain competitiveness against Ford's new Cosworth DFV, but it proved very unreliable. Slow communications between the UK and Australia had always made identifying and correcting problems very difficult. The car was fast—Rindt set pole position twice during the season—but Brabham and Rindt finished only three races between them, and ended the year with only ten points.|$|E

5|$|Tigranes' {{army was}} {{positioned}} {{on the east}} {{bank of the river}} while Lucullus, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>left</b> a rear guard to continue the siege of the city, met the Armenian army on the river's west bank. The Armenian army was formed of three sections. Two of Tigranes' vassal kings led the left and right flanks, while Tigranes led his cataphracts in the center. The rest of his army stood in front of a hill, a position Lucullus soon exploited.|$|E
5|$|By 23 April the Red Army had {{surrounded}} Berlin, and Goebbels made a proclamation urging {{its citizens}} {{to defend the}} city. That same day, Göring sent a telegram from Berchtesgaden, arguing that since Hitler was isolated in Berlin, Göring should assume leadership of Germany. Göring set a deadline, after which he would consider Hitler incapacitated. Hitler responded by having Göring arrested, and in his last will and testament, written on 29 April, he removed Göring from all government positions. On 28 April Hitler discovered that Himmler, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>left</b> Berlin on 20 April, was trying to negotiate a surrender to the Western Allies. He ordered Himmler's arrest and had Hermann Fegelein (Himmler's SS representative at Hitler's HQ in Berlin) shot.|$|E

5|$|By February {{the next}} year, {{construction}} had resumed. On 8 April 25men {{working on the}} bridge went on strike. This was of concern due to time dependent concreting being undertaken at that time. As the construction was considered unemployment relief, the constructing authority began to look for men who would do the work in their places. By 13 April, further details had emerged; {{the number of the}} men on strike was actually 32, and it had been caused by the alleged wrongful dismissal of three men <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>left</b> for their lunch break early. The strike continued until at least 21 April. Work had resumed by early May, and the bridge was reported as being a little over half completed at that time.|$|E
5|$|Charles Enderlin {{was born}} in 1945 in Paris; his {{grandparents}} were Austrian Jews <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>left</b> the country in 1938 when Germany invaded. After briefly studying medicine, he moved to Jerusalem in 1968 where he became an Israeli national. He began working for France2 in 1981, serving as their bureau chief in Israel from 1990 {{until his retirement in}} 2015. Enderlin is {{the author of several books}} about the Middle East, including one about Muhammad al-Durrah, Un Enfant est Mort: Netzarim, 30 Septembre 2000 (2010). Highly regarded among his peers and within the French establishment, he submitted a letter from Jacques Chirac, during the Philippe Karsenty libel action, who wrote in flattering terms of Enderlin's integrity. In 2009 he was awarded France's highest decoration, the Légion d'honneur.|$|E
5|$|Cosima was 24 {{years younger}} than Wagner and was herself illegitimate, the {{daughter}} of the Countess Marie d'Agoult, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>left</b> her husband for Franz Liszt. Liszt initially disapproved of his daughter's involvement with Wagner, though nevertheless the two men were friends. The indiscreet affair scandalised Munich, and Wagner also fell into disfavour with many leading members of the court, who were suspicious of his influence on the King. In December 1865, Ludwig was finally forced to ask the composer to leave Munich. He apparently also {{toyed with the idea of}} abdicating to follow his hero into exile, but Wagner quickly dissuaded him.|$|E
