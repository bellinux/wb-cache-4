40|$|Nowadays many {{students}} from Universities, High Schools, Elementary Schools and even professionals have been frustrated {{when they tried}} to learn English for this reason they don t want to listen to anything that relates with English and it is due to the way that their teachers taught them in the first basic grade, their teachers didn t motivate them to learn English or didn t apply the correct methodologies or techniques. One of the most important aspects in teaching children to foreign language is motivation, because they don t know what it is, what it is for, why learn it, so the teacher must find the ways how to teach them. Everybody has the wrong idea that the new teachers must teach the lower grades because they aren t difficult to teach, but if we analyze it we can conclude that if the best teachers or the most experts taught kinder or garden students, they <b>wouldn</b> <b>t</b> hate to learn English like nowadays happens...|$|E
40|$|If {{construction}} is about delivering a built asset {{that is of}} high quality and efficiency, <b>wouldn</b> <b>t</b> most companies use all the tools and processes available at the highest organizational level possible? A major assumption is made that Prolog Manager is an effective Project Management Information System. Saying Company X will benefit from more module use with Prolog Manager system {{is not the same}} as saying they will suffer from lack of module usage. If a company has already attained success using manual systems it successes may continue. To be as successful as possible, maximum utilization of all modules of Prolog Manager at the unique project type organizational level is necessary, and correlations can be made between higher module usage and greater project successes with this type of company size and structure.

40|$|The {{past twenty}} years have seen the communitarian system of multi level {{governance}} (MLG) being established {{as a model of}} territorial policies governance. In the MLG, several levels of jurisdiction participate to decision making and Regions assume a relevant role in managing policies of development. This article highlights how such a system, mostly led by Public Institutions, cuts transaction costs being based on principles aimed at increasing the number of decision makers, as well as at making all governing levels and the processes of institutional coordination more effective. The article investigates two issues: a) to what extent the reorganization of the Italian system is compatible with the main characteristics of Communitarian MLG system in the governance of territorial policies; b) to what extent the decentralization in programming policies of development has gone with a transfer of capital expenses from a central (Central Administration) to local (Regional and Local Bodies) jurisdictions. The hypotheses to be tested refer to the decentralization process so far recorded in Italy: the first hypothesis is that such a process would not be fully shareable, neither with regard to the characteristics of the Communitarian MLG model, nor to the general considerations deriving by the theory of fiscal federalism; secondly, the process <b>wouldn</b> <b>t</b> seem suitably supported by a symmetrical transfer of the expenses from the Central Government s jurisdiction to local bodies. bagarani@unimol. i...|$|E
40|$|Some of {{you will}} already know {{the story about the}} four people named Everybody, Somebody, Anybody and Nobody, but it is so illustrative of the need for this super new book that it is worth telling again. The story goes like this. There was an {{important}} job to be done and Everybody was sure that Somebody would do it. Anybody could have done it, but Nobody did it. Somebody got angry about that, because it was Everybody s job. Everybody thought Anybody could do it, but Nobody realised that Everybody <b>wouldn</b> <b>t</b> do it. It ended up that Everybody blamed Somebody when Nobody did what Anybody could have done. In short, getting organised, teamwork, planning and joint decision-making are so important in strengthening local governance, eradicating poverty and building self-reliance and yet so difficult to achieve. This practical step-by-step and exercise-by-exercise field manual inspired by Zimbabwean realities could be a useful tool for this.

40|$|Around 2. 4 {{million people}} in the {{mountain}} areas of Papua New Guinea depend on subsistence farming. For a long time this way of farming has been avoided, and sometimes derided, by many authorities and developers worldwide. Shifting cultivation and slash and burn techniques, in combination with population pressure, was leading to deforestation and soil degradation. The general belief was that investing in such a farming system <b>wouldn</b> <b>t</b> get us anywhere. Not so, say the authors of Subsistence agriculture improvement, whose practical manual has won many admirers since it was published 10 years ago. Now available to CTA s subscribers, it offers a worthy collection of ways to improve subsistence farming. It explains how to build an A-frame for making terraces and contour-ridges and how to recognise zinc deficiency in citrus, beans and potatoes. In between it provides information about composting, crafting, drying, cooking, planting and protecting. In addition it contains a section on commonly known plants for the mid-mountain subsistence garden. All in all, a manual useful for other tropical mountainous areas as well. Finally, Sally Shaw did a great job with the many attractive, clear and clarifying illustrations. Subsistence Agriculture Improvement.

40|$|Microbiological and {{chemical}} changes were evaluated in freshwater prawn stored under refrigeration at 0 °C and 5 °C during 10 days, with {{special emphasis on}} indole production as a chemical spoilage indicator. The total psychrotrophic and indole positive microflora were mainly mesophilic, with indole positive microorganisms being less than 10 % of the total microflora after 10 days storage under refrigeration. Bacteria from Enterobacteriaceae and Vibrionaceae families prevailed among the isolated indole positive strains. The use of the Most Probable Number-MPN method, using tryptone broth as culture medium, was the most reliable approach for the quantitative evaluation of the indole positive microflora. The stored samples showed increases in pH, L-tryptophan and total volatile bases (TVB), which were more intensive at 5 °C. The psychrotrophic counts and TVB values of samples stored at 0 °C were lower than the recommended limits (107 CFU/g and 30 mg N/ 100 g, respectively), even after 10 days storage. However, in samples stored at 5 °C, these values were reached after 10 and 5 days, respectively. The presence of indole in levels above the limit recommended by FDA/USA (25 mug/ 100 g) was confirmed in only one sample, suggesting that this substance, alone, <b>wouldn</b> <b>t</b> be a good indicator of freshwater prawn quality stored under refrigeration. Foram estudadas alterações químicas e microbiológicas do camarão da Malásia, armazenado a 0 °C e 5 °C durante 10 dias, enfatizando-se a produção de indol como indicador da deterioração. A microbiota psicrotrófila total e indol positiva era predominantemente mesófila, sendo a indol positiva inferior a 10 % da total após 10 dias de armazenamento sob refrigeração, sendo constituida por bactérias das famílias Enterobacteriaceae e Vibrionaceae. O método de Número Mais Provavel-NMP, usando-se o caldo triptona, revelou-se o mais adequado na contagem da microbiota indol positiva. Nas amostras observaram-se o aumento de pH, dos teores de L- triptofano e de bases voláteis totais-BVT, mais evidentes a 5 °C. Nas amostras armazenadas a 0 °C não foram constatados valores de contagem total de psicrotrófilos e de BVT acima dos limites recomendados (10 (7) CFU/g e 30 mgN/ 100 g, respectivamente) mesmo após 10 dias de estocagem. No entanto, nas mantidas a 5 °C, estes valores foram detectados após 10 e 5 dias, respectivamente. A presença de indol em níveis acima de 25 mig/ 100 g, limite adotado pela FDA/USA, somente foi detectada em uma amostra, sugerindo que esta substância, isoladamente, não seria um bom indicador da qualidade do camarão armazenado sob refrigeração...|$|E
40|$|Esta pesquisa teve por objetivo {{investigar}} a representação de sujeitos homicidas a respeito da razão do crime (motivação) e acerca do crime propriamente dito (ação), tanto à época do homicídio (passado) quanto no momento atual (presente), por meio do juízo de representação da realidade (JRR) e do juízo de valor moral (JVM). A amostra compôs-se de 20 homens, entre 30 e 49 anos de idade, cumprindo pena sob regime de liberdade condicional na Vara de Execuções Penais de Vitória-ES. Realizamos entrevistas individuais, de acordo com o método clínico proposto por Piaget (1926 /s. d.; 1932 / 1994). A partir dos dados encontrados, verificamos que, com relação: 1) às histórias de homicídio, a maior parte dos crimes ocorreu à noite, em espaço público, por arma de fogo, contra homens, conhecidos do transgressor, ambos alcoolizados; 2) à motivação para o homicídio, o JRR mais apontado, no presente e no passado, foi a agressão física sofrida, justificada no presente principalmente pelo fato de o agressor ter-se sentido humilhado e, no passado, pelo fato de ter querido vingar-se e pelas características próprias do transgressor ou da vítima; o JVM mais mencionado no passado foi o de que as razões estavam certas, devido a características dos entrevistados ou das vítimas, pelas humilhações sofridas ou pelo fato de que precisavam defender uma vida, ao passo que no presente o juízo mais citado pelos entrevistados foi o de que estavam errados os motivos, em face das conseqüências negativas do crime para eles e dos argumentos religiosos; 3) à ação do homicídio, o JRR mais citado no passado foi o de que os participantes cometeriam novamente o homicídio, pela humilhação sofrida ou pelo sentimento experienciado; e no presente mencionaram que não matariam de novo, devido às conseqüências negativas do crime, às características próprias ou da vítima e aos motivos religiosos; o JVM mais mencionado no passado foi o de que a ação seria errada, pelas conseqüências negativas, enquanto no presente todos julgaram como errado o homicídio cometido, devido às conseqüências negativas, ao valor atribuído à vida e a motivos religiosos; 4) aos dados em geral, houve uma tendência maior em condenar o homicídio e não a sua motivação; os argumentos religiosos ligaram-se ao fato de, no presente, os entrevistados julgarem como erradas a motivação e a ação do crime e, portanto, não o fariam novamente; as explicações veiculadas à humilhação pertencem principalmente ao passado, para justificar como corretos os juízos de valor das motivações e da ação, razão pela qual naquela época cometeriam novamente o homicídio, com uma ação pela honra. The {{objective of}} this research was to investigate the representation of homicidal subjects as to the reasons of. the crime (motivation), and of the crime itself (action), not only {{at the time of the}} homicide (past) as for the present moment as well (present), by means of judgement of representation of reality (JRR), and of judgement of moral value (JVM). The sample consisted of 20 men, their ages varying between 30 and 49 years old, in prison and under parole at the Court s Division of Penal Executions of Vitória-ES. Individual interviews were made, according to the clinical method proposed by Piaget (1926 /s. d.; 1932 / 1994). From the gathered data, we verifyed that in relation to: 1) the homicidal stories, most crimes took place at night, in public spaces, by fire weapon, against men known to the transgressor, both drunk; 2) as to the motivation for homicide, the JRR emphasized in the present and in the past, the physical aggression which took place, justified in the present mainly because the aggressor felt humiliated, and in the past, because he wanted to take revenge, and the transgressor s or victim s own characteristics; the JVM that was more mentionned in the past, was that their reasons were right due to the characteristics of those interviewed or of the victims, for the suffered humiliations or for the fact that they had to defend a life, whereas in the present, the most cited judgement was that their motives were wrong, in face of. the negative consequences of their crime, and of the religious arguments; 3) as to the action of the homicide, the JRR most mentionned in the past, was that those who had committed it, would do it again, either for the suffered humiliation or for the feeling they had experienced; and in the present they mentionned that they <b>wouldn</b> <b>t</b> kill again, due to the negative consequences of the crime, to the victim s own characteristics, and to religious motives; the JVM more mentionned in the past was that the action would be wrong, because of. the negative consequences, whereas in the present all of them judged as wrong the committed homicide, due to negative consequences, to the value attributed to life, and to religious motives; 4) as to the data in general, there was a greater tendency in condemning the homicide, and not its motivation; the religious arguments were linked to the fact that in the present, those interviewed judged as wrong the motivation and the action for the crime, and therefore they <b>wouldn</b> <b>t</b> do it again; the explanations linked to humiliation belongs mainly to the past, so as to justify as correct the judgement of value of the motivation and of the action, as a reason for why at that time, they would commit homicide again, as an action for honour...|$|E
40|$|O autor escocês James Matthew Barrie escreveu sobre Peter Pan pela primeira vez em uma obra intitulada The Little White Bird, em 1902. No ano de 1904, o escritor ampliou o universo de seu personagem, dessa vez, com uma peça teatral de nome Peter Pan ou O Menino que não Queria Crescer; o romance tal qual o conhecemos só seria concebido, no entanto, em 1911, quando o diretor decidiu reescrever e prolongar sua peça teatral. Era assim que surgia, então, um dos clássicos da {{literatura}} infantil mais conhecidos atualmente: Peter Pan and Wendy, obra que, hoje, faz parte da infância e da vida de muitas pessoas, tendo até mesmo criado um mito: o mito do menino que nunca cresce, da eterna e venturosa infância. Sendo assim, a obra daria margem a diversos pós-textos, ganhando inúmeras continuações e adaptações desde seu lançamento. Partindo de análises baseadas nas teorias de Dialogismo de Mikhail Bakhtin, de Intertextualidade de Julia Kristeva e de Transtextualidade de Gerard Genette, o presente trabalho visa ao estudo de três releituras e/ou adaptações do texto-fonte Peter Pan and Wendy a fim de se verificar em que medida o contexto histórico-cultural de produção dessas versões modifica, amplia ou contradiz o texto de 1911. Os textos escolhidos para a análise proposta são: Peter Pan, de Monteiro Lobato (1930); Peter Pan a animação dos Estúdios Walt Disney (1950) e Peter Pan o filme, do diretor australiano P. J. Hogan (2003). The Scottish writer James Matthew Barrie {{wrote for}} the first time about Peter Pan in a book called The Little White Bird, in 1902. In 1904, the writer enlarged the character s universe making, this time, a stage play called Peter Pan or The Boy that <b>Wouldn</b> <b>t</b> Grow up; however, the romance as we know it would only be constructed in 1911, when Barrie decided to rewrite and extend his original play. That is how one of the best well known classics of children s literature was born: Peter Pan and Wendy, a book that, today, is part of many people s childhood and life; the story has even created a myth: the myth of the boy who never grows up, the myth of the eternal and adventurous youth. This way, the romance gave origin to many post-texts, gaining numbers of adaptations since it was first published. By making analysis based on Mikhail Bakhtin s dialogism theory, on Julia Kristeva s intertextuality theory and on Gerard Genette transtextuality theory, the present essay intends to study three different readings and/or adaptations of the base-text Peter Pan and Wendy, in order to verify how the historical/cultural context modifies, increases or contradicts this 1911 version. The texts chosen for the proposed analysis are: Peter Pan, by Monteiro Lobato (1930); Peter Pan the animation from Walt Disney Pictures (1950); and Peter Pan the movie, from the Australian director P. J. Hogan (2003) ...|$|E
40|$|Jean-Claude Minkala, {{prospective}} pensioner In 2007, Jean-Claude Minkala will be retiring, {{but he has}} {{no intention}} of remaining inactive for long. With the help of Spore, this health assistant from the University Hospital in Brazzaville is planning to become an agro-pastoral farmer. In his late fifties, Mr Minkala explains the reasons for his decision to change profession. I always said that when I retired I would not do a job that involved looking after people. The ancillary staff who work in the public surgeries don t have a very good reputation. And I <b>wouldn</b> <b>t</b> want to be mixed up with that lot. Information and life can take some strange twists and turns. One day in the mid 1990 s one of his brothers just back from Cuba talked at length about an agricultural magazine published in the Netherlands, and advised him to write and ask if he could receive it. He was quick to follow this piece of advice, which, as things turned out, opened up new horizons for him. By reading Spore, Mr Minkala gradually learned how to breed pigs, fish, chickens, etc. The magazine also helped me to start growing fruit trees orange, mango and safou It was at Mindouli, a place 180 km south of Brazzaville, that he decided to base his agricultural activities, with his father on the spot to supervise. Then the war of 1997 wiped out all his plans. His father was killed, his livestock were slaughtered and his crops were devastated. Everything would have to be rebuilt from scratch. But Mr Minkala never stopped reading Spore. An open-minded person, he was looking for any experiences or solutions which might help his own situation. Faced with a local conflict over the management of pastureland, he found the address for the director of the development project, Programme Sahel Burkinabé, who sent him a document about a joint management initiative between herders and farmer-herders from Kishi Beiga, in the north of Burkina Faso (Spore 85). At Mindouli, we had the same problem, he explained. When an ox strayed from its pastureland to go and graze in someone else s field, the owner had to pay FCFA 5 million (7, 622). That s impossible! It poisoned relations between farmers. I used the experience from Burkina Faso, putting the idea before local communities. And we have managed to resolve the conflict. When a fragile peace returned to The Republic of the Congo in 2003, Jean-Claude Minkala relaunched his activities, with his retirement in mind. He would love to visit other countries such as Burkina Faso to learn some of the recipes developed by NGOs and presented in Spore. For example, I would like to go and see how you make mango liqueur and bread from cassava flour [...] In 2007, Jean-Claude Minkala will be retiring, {{but he has no}} intention of remaining inactive for long.
