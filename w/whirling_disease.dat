5|$|<b>Whirling</b> <b>disease</b> {{was first}} {{detected}} in fish in Johnson Lake in Banff National Park in May, 2016. CFIA Labs confirmed in August and Parks Canada announced the outbreak August 23, 2016. Although {{it was first}} discovered in Banff, {{it is not necessarily}} where the disease originated and spread. The Government of Alberta is currently sampling and testing fish in 6 different watersheds (Peace River, Athabasca, North Saskatchewan, Red Deer, Bow and Oldman) to see where the disease has spread. Initial sample fish were collected in 2016, and are currently being processed by the Government of Alberta and CFIA labs. Since testing began, it has been detected in the Upper Bow River, and in May 2017 it was confirmed that <b>whirling</b> <b>disease</b> had also been detected in the Oldman River Basin. The declaration does not mean that every susceptible finfish population within the Bow and Oldman River watersheds are infected with the disease.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, Grand Teton National Park started {{requiring}} all {{boats to}} display an Aquatic Invasive Species decal {{issued by the}} Wyoming Game and Fish Department or a Yellowstone National Park boat permit. In {{an effort to keep}} the park waterways free of various invasive species such as the Zebra mussel and <b>whirling</b> <b>disease,</b> boaters are expected to abide by certain regulations including displaying a self-certification of compliance on the dashboard of any vehicle attached to an empty boat trailer.|$|E
5|$|Wild-caught and hatchery-reared {{forms of}} this species have been transplanted and {{introduced}} for food or sport in at least 45 countries and every continent except Antarctica. Introductions to locations outside their native range in the United States (U.S.), Southern Europe, Australia, New Zealand and South America have damaged native fish species. Introduced populations may affect native species by preying on them, out-competing them, transmitting contagious diseases (such as <b>whirling</b> <b>disease),</b> or hybridizing with closely related species and subspecies, thus reducing genetic purity. The rainbow trout {{is included in the}} list of the top 100 globally invasive species. Nonetheless, other introductions into waters previously devoid of any fish species or with severely depleted stocks of native fish have created sport fisheries such as the Great Lakes and Wyoming's Firehole River.|$|E
40|$|Analysis of the {{fatty acids}} of total lipids of wild {{fingerlings}} (1 - 4 g) of sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) caught {{of the north}} coast of France shows that more than 30 % of total fatty acids consists of the two essential fatty acids eicopentaenoic (C 20 : 5 n- 3) and docosahexaenoic (C 22 : 6 n- 3) acids. One- and three-day old yolk sac larvae have even higher amounts of these two important fatty acids (about 40 %). On the other hand, laboratory-reared 60 -day old larvae had much lower concentrations of C 20 : 5 n- 3 (4 % of total fatty acids) and C 22 : 6 n- 3 (5. 5 % of total fatty acids). In larvae suffering from <b>whirling</b> or spinning <b>disease</b> the percentage of C 20 : 5 n- 3 was only 2. 8 % and only traces of C 22 : 6 n- 3 were found. These results {{emphasize the importance of}} these fatty acids for cultured sea bass larvae. status: publishe...|$|R
25|$|Henneguya {{and other}} parasites in the myxosporean group have complex life cycles, where the salmon {{is one of}} two hosts. The fish {{releases}} the spores after spawning. In the Henneguya case, the spores enter a second host, most likely an invertebrate, in the spawning stream. When juvenile salmon migrate to the Pacific Ocean, the second host releases a stage infective to salmon. The parasite is then carried in the salmon until the next spawning cycle. The myxosporean parasite that causes <b>whirling</b> <b>disease</b> in trout has a similar life cycle. However, as opposed to <b>whirling</b> <b>disease,</b> the Henneguya infestation does not appear to cause disease in the host salmon— even heavily infected fish tend to return to spawn successfully.|$|E
25|$|The capture, {{transportation}} {{and culture of}} bait fish can spread damaging organisms between ecosystems, endangering them. In 2007, several American states, enacted regulations designed to slow the spread of fish diseases, including viral hemorrhagic septicemia, by bait fish. Because {{of the risk of}} transmitting Myxobolus cerebralis (<b>whirling</b> <b>disease),</b> trout and salmon should not be used as bait.|$|E
25|$|Yellowstone {{cutthroat}} trout generally {{declined in the}} second half of the 20th century due to angler overharvest, competition with exotic fishes, and overzealous egg collection. Populations rebounded in the park after the advent of catch-and-release-only fishing rules in the 1970s, but new and aggressive invaders are causing an increasing threat to these native fish and alarming park fisheries biologists. Nonnative lake trout, an effective fish predator, were discovered in Yellowstone Lake in 1994. Throughout the west {{cutthroat trout}} populations preyed upon by introduced lake trout have typically declined, exhibited lower growth, or have disappeared. Aggressive lake trout control efforts by the National Park Service and no harvest limits have resulted in removing thousands of lake trout from Yellowstone Lake since 1994, including more than 12,000 in 2000. Still, the number of Yellowstone cutthroat trout monitored during the annual fall count in Yellowstone Lake was lower in recent years than at any other time in the 25-year history of the monitoring effort. <b>Whirling</b> <b>disease,</b> which has been implicated in recent years in the decline of trout populations in many western states, was discovered in Yellowstone Lake in 1998. So far, it is unclear which of these two nonnative invaders has been the greater factor in the decline of Yellowstone cutthroat trout, but there is no question they are causing it.|$|E

500|$|M. cerebralis {{was first}} {{recorded}} in North America in 1956 in Pennsylvania, having been introduced via infected trout imported from Europe, and has spread steadily south and westwards. Until the 1990s, <b>whirling</b> <b>disease</b> {{was considered a}} manageable problem affecting rainbow trout in hatcheries. However, it has recently become established in natural waters of the Rocky Mountain states (Colorado, Wyoming, Utah, Montana, Idaho, New Mexico), where it is causing heavy mortalities in several sportfishing rivers. Some streams in the western United States have lost 90% of their trout. In addition, <b>whirling</b> <b>disease</b> threatens recreational fishing, which {{is important for the}} tourism industry, a key component of the economies of some U.S. western states. For example, [...] "the Montana <b>Whirling</b> <b>Disease</b> Task Force estimated trout fishing generated US $300,000,000 in recreational expenditures in Montana alone". Making matters worse, some of the fish species that M. cerebralis infects (bull trout, cutthroat trout, and steelhead) are already threatened or endangered, and the parasite could worsen their already precarious situations. [...] For reasons that are poorly understood, but probably have to do with environmental conditions, the impact on infected fish has been greatest in Colorado and Montana, and least in California, Michigan, and New York.|$|E
500|$|The {{parasite}} [...] {{was first}} recorded in North America in 1956 in Pennsylvania, {{but until the}} 1990s <b>whirling</b> <b>disease</b> was considered a manageable problem only affecting rainbow trout in hatcheries. It eventually became established in natural waters of the Rocky Mountain states (Colorado, Wyoming, Utah, Montana, Idaho, New Mexico), where it is damaging several sport fishing rivers. Some streams in the western U.S. lost 90percent of their trout. <b>Whirling</b> <b>disease</b> threatens recreational fishing, which {{is important for the}} tourism industry, a key component of the economies of some U.S. western states. For example, in 2005 anglers in Montana spent approximately $196,000,000 in activities directly related to trout fishing in the state. Some of the salmonids that [...] infects (bull trout, cutthroat trout, and anadromous forms of rainbow trout—steelhead) are already threatened or endangered, and the parasite could worsen their population decline.|$|E
500|$|M. cerebralis {{was first}} found in New Zealand in 1971. The {{parasite}} {{has only been}} found in rivers in the South Island, away from the most important aquaculture sites. [...] Additionally, salmonid species commercially aquacultured in New Zealand have low susceptibility to <b>whirling</b> <b>disease,</b> and the parasite has also not been shown to affect native salmonids. An important indirect effect of the parasites presence is quarantine restriction placed on exports of salmon products to Australia.|$|E
500|$|The {{historic}} native {{range of}} cutthroat trout {{has been reduced}} by overfishing, urbanization and habitat loss due to mining, livestock grazing and logging. Population densities have been reduced {{and in some cases}} populations have disappeared though competition with non-native brook, brown, lake and rainbow trout, kokanee salmon, lake whitefish and mysis shrimp which were introduced in the late 19th and early 20thcenturies. Scientists believe the westslope cutthroat trout will eventually be extirpated from the large lakes in Western Montana due to the trophic cascades resulting from lake trout and mysis shrimp introductions. The most serious current threats to several subspecies are interspecific breeding with introduced rainbow trout creating hybrid cutbows and intraspecific breeding with other introduced cutthroat trout subspecies. In the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, the presence of lake trout [...] in Yellowstone Lake in Yellowstone National Park has caused a serious decline in [...] Outbreaks of <b>whirling</b> <b>disease</b> in major spawning tributaries within the native ranges have also caused declines. Most subspecies of cutthroat trout are highly susceptible to <b>whirling</b> <b>disease,</b> although the Snake River fine-spotted cutthroat trout [...] appears to be resistant to the parasite.|$|E
500|$|... is a myxosporean {{parasite}} of salmonids (salmon, trout, {{and their}} allies) that causes <b>whirling</b> <b>disease</b> in farmed {{salmon and trout}} and also in wild fish populations. It was first described in rainbow trout in Germany a century ago, but its range has spread and it has appeared in most of Europe, northern Asia, the U.S., South Africa and other countries. In the 1980s, [...] was found to require Tubifex tubifex (a kind of segmented worm) to complete its life cycle. The parasite infects its hosts with its cells after piercing them with polar filaments ejected from nematocyst-like capsules.|$|E
500|$|Myxobolus cerebralis is a myxosporean {{parasite}} of salmonids (salmon, trout, {{and their}} allies) that causes <b>whirling</b> <b>disease</b> in farmed {{salmon and trout}} and also in wild fish populations. It was first described in rainbow trout in Germany a century ago, but its range has spread and it has appeared in most of Europe (including Russia), the United States, South Africa, Canada and other countries. [...] In the 1980s, M. cerebralis was found to require a tubificid oligochaete (a kind of segmented worm) to complete its life cycle. [...] The parasite infects its hosts with its cells after piercing them with polar filaments ejected from nematocyst-like capsules.|$|E
500|$|<b>Whirling</b> <b>disease</b> afflicts {{juvenile}} fish (fingerlings and fry) and causes skeletal deformation and neurological damage. Fish [...] "whirl" [...] forward in an awkward, corkscrew-like pattern instead of swimming normally, find feeding difficult, {{and are more}} vulnerable to predators. The mortality rate is high for fingerlings, up to 90% of infected populations, {{and those that do}} survive are deformed by the parasites residing in their cartilage and bone. They act as a reservoir for the parasite, which is released into water following the fish's death. M. cerebralis {{is one of the most}} economically important myxozoans in fish, as well as one of the most pathogenic. It was the first myxosporean whose pathology and symptoms were described scientifically. The parasite is not transmissible to humans.|$|E
500|$|Some {{strains of}} fish are more {{resistant}} than others, even within species; using resistant strains may {{help reduce the}} incidence and severity of <b>whirling</b> <b>disease</b> in aquaculture. [...] There is also some circumstantial evidence that fish populations can develop resistance to the disease over time. [...] Additionally, aquaculturists may avoid M. cerebralis infections by not using earthen ponds for raising young fish; this keeps them away from possibly infected tubificids and {{makes it easier to}} eliminate spores and oligochaetes through filtration, chlorination, and ultraviolet bombardment. To minimise tubificid populations, techniques include periodic disinfection of the hatchery or aquaculture ponds, and the rearing of small trout indoors in pathogen-free water. Smooth-faced concrete or plastic-lined raceways that are kept clean and free of contaminated water keep aquaculture facilities free of the disease.|$|E
500|$|Moderate {{or heavy}} {{clinical}} infection of fish with <b>whirling</b> <b>disease</b> can be presumptively diagnosed {{on the basis}} of changes in behavior and appearance about 35 to 80 days after initial infection, though [...] "injury or deficiency in dietary tryptophan and ascorbic acid can evoke similar signs", so conclusive diagnosis may require finding myxospores in the fish's cartilage. [...] In heavy infections, only examining cartilage microscopically may be needed to find spores. In less severe infections, the most common test involves digestion of the cranial cartilage with the proteases pepsin and trypsin (pepsin-trypsin digest—PTD) before looking for spores. [...] The head and other tissues can be further examined using histopathology to confirm whether the location and morphology of the spores matches what is known for M. cerebralis. Serological identification of spores in tissue sections using an antibody raised against the spores is also possible. [...] Parasite identity can also be confirmed using the polymerase chain reaction to amplify the 415 base pair 18S rRNA gene from M. cerebralis. Fish should be screened at the life stage most susceptible to the parasites, with particular focus on fish in aquaculture units.|$|E
2500|$|Management of {{the fishery}} {{immediately}} downstream of Holter Dam necessarily involves management of the dam and reservoir. In autumn 1996, <b>whirling</b> <b>disease</b> was confirmed in the Missouri River below Holter Dam. Fishing on the [...] stretch of Missouri River below Holter Dam doubled between 1989 and 1999, according to the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks. These pressures led state wildlife managers to implement in March 2002 limits on the catch of rainbow trout on {{this part of the}} Missouri River. By 2002, fishing levels just below Holter Dam had doubled from their 1993 levels. This section of the Missouri River was now the most heavily fished body of water in the state. In 2009 and 2010, a fungal disease killed large numbers of mature brown trout below Holter Dam.|$|E
2500|$|Drought {{has also}} {{affected}} the dam's operation. No water {{was permitted to}} flow over the dam in 1986 due to drought. In 1992, water flowed over the dam's crest on only a single day. In wetter years, water flows over the dam almost continuously. A severe drought struck the state of Montana beginning in 1999. By May 2004, the dam was permitting only [...] to [...] per second downriver. These flows were well below the [...] per second {{needed to keep the}} fishery healthy. The low water flows, coupled with <b>whirling</b> <b>disease,</b> led to a 40 percent drop in big fish (those over [...] in length) as well as lower overall numbers of fish immediately below the dam. A 2005 proposal by the managers of the Helena National Forest to draw down Holter Lake by [...] in August 2005 in order to repair Coulter Campground near the Gates of the Mountains had fishermen and recreational outfitters angry due to the likely side-effects on the downstream fishery. But a 2006 study by state wildlife biologists found that, although there had been a slight {{decline in the number of}} all fish as well as the sizes of all fish since the sport fish population peaked in 1999, those declines were slight compared to what had been predicted. A 2006-2007 survey of burbot and stonecats in the Missouri River immediately below Holter Dam found four times as many burbot as expected. Heavy snowpack and spring rains in 2008, however, forced dam operators to increase the flow to [...] per second. By June, flows increased to [...] per second, permitting a [...] "flush" [...] of the river. Flows stayed double their typical flow rates even in July 2008.|$|E
