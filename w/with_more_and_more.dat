5|$|Efforts {{had begun}} {{as early as}} 1911 to procure arms and smuggle them into India. When {{a clear idea of}} the {{conspiracy}} emerged, more earnest and elaborate plans were made to obtain arms and to enlist international support. Herambalal Gupta, who had arrived in the United States in 1914 at the Berlin Committee's directives, took over the leadership of American wing of the conspiracy after the failure of the SS Korea mission. Gupta immediately began efforts to obtain men and arms. While men were in plentiful supply <b>with</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> Indians coming forward to join the Ghadarite cause, obtaining arms for the uprising proved to be more difficult.|$|E
5|$|<b>With</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> {{people coming}} to Aspen, a better road from the east was needed. An early {{investor}} in the city, B. Clark Wheeler, put up the money needed to improve the path over the pass to a stage road. It opened in November 1881, just as winter was beginning. The tolls, 25 cents for saddle horses and twice that for stages ($ and $ in modern dollars respectively) were primarily spent hiring a large crew of men who kept the pass clear in winter with snowshovels. They were {{able to keep the}} road through the pass open during its first five winters. In deep enough snow passengers switched to sleighs; in summer, dogs ran in advance to warn oncoming traffic through the pass itself as the stages took the switchbacks at full speed. It usually took a stage 10–25 hours and five changes of horses to reach Aspen from Twin Lakes.|$|E

25|$|Multiple piercings {{in one or}} {{both ears}} first emerged in {{mainstream}} America in the 1970s.

25|$|In {{the prehistoric}} times the main {{military}} {{force of the}} state consisted of all the grown males subject of a local Władyka. A Władyka was a leader who had enough power to overwhelm previous senior tribal leaders of particular tribes, or who distinguished himself {{during the war and}} thanks to it gained hereditary sovereignty. In later times however – <b>with</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> towns and villages – this hereditary ruler, now a duke, began to form his own drużyna. A drużyna became the basic formation of the state. However, to build an army a ruler had to send wici to call to arms a pospolite ruszenie of free landowners, who later transformed into the szlachta. The drużyna was equipped and armed by the duke, but a levy-en-masse went to war armed quite arbitrarly: weapons and armour had to be bought privately or captured in the battle. Hence the weapons of the pospolite ruszenie were quite different in origin and quality; predominately spears and javelins, war axes, bows and maces.|$|E
25|$|At {{this point}} of Deuteronomium's career, Johnny Pesonen and Jari Mantour were {{replaced}} by Kalle Paju (guitar) and Janne-Jussi Kontoniemi (drums). The songs on Street Corner Queen were written between many years before the band entered the Studio Watercastle in Jyväskylä, 1998. According to the band members, on Street Corner Queen they couldn't decide what style they wanted to focus on yet wanted to be pioneering and write lyrics that kept balance between artistic output and intelligible meaning. Their guitarist-vocalist Miika Partala was the main songwriter {{at this point and}} he experimented <b>with</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> bizarre musical styles after another, combining these elements with extreme metal. Street Corner Queen eventually ended up being a mixture of a broad spectrum of different styles, the main focus being on melodic output of Scandinavian death metal in vein of old In Flames or Dark Tranquillity and groovy rock oriented aggression similar to later Entombed and 1990s Napalm Death material. Many of the songs incorporate death metal, black metal, punk rock, classic rock, jazz, rap, reggae and funk metal elements – a style they were known to call 'death and roll'. The vocalization of Miika Partala shifts between aggressive Killing Joke type punk shouting and high pitched black metal style shrieking.|$|E
