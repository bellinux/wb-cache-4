In the first leg away at the Estadio El Collao on 2 December 2014, they drew 11; Francis opened the scoring for the hosts while Borja Viguera {{equalised}} in added time.

50|$|Swahili, {{like all}} other Bantu languages, has {{numerous}} noun classes. Verbs must agree in class with their subjects and objects, and adjectives with the nouns that they qualify. For example: Kitabu kimoja kitatosha (One book will <b>be</b> <b>enough),</b> Mchungwa mmoja utatosha (One orange-tree will <b>be</b> <b>enough),</b> Chungwa moja litatosha (One orange will <b>be</b> <b>enough).</b> There <b>is</b> also agreement in number. For example: Vitabu viwili vitatosha (Two books will <b>be</b> <b>enough),</b> Michungwa miwili itatosha (Two orange-trees will <b>be</b> <b>enough),</b> Machungwa mawili yatatosha (Two oranges will <b>be</b> <b>enough).</b> Class and number are indicated with prefixes (or sometimes their absence), which are not always the same for nouns, adjectives and verbs, {{as illustrated by the}} examples.|$|R

5|$|Bailey left Charlton {{to replace}} Alan Mullery as Brighton & Hove Albion manager, and the Charlton board {{ironically}} decided to name Mullery as Bailey's successor. Charlton finished the 1981–82 season in 13th place, and Walsh scored 15 goals in total.

5|$|Beginning in late 1933 and {{escalating}} {{throughout the}} first half of 1934, American Roman Catholics launched a campaign against what they deemed the immorality of American cinema.
