5|$|Balzac's first {{project was}} a {{libretto}} for a comic opera called Le Corsaire, based on Lord Byron's The Corsair. Realizing he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>trouble</b> finding a composer, however, {{he turned to}} other pursuits.|$|E
5|$|The {{numbering}} scheme for the point releases up to Debian 4.0 was {{to include the}} letter r (for revision) after the main version number and then {{the number of the}} point release; for example, the latest point release of version 4.0 is 4.0r9. This scheme was chosen because a new dotted version would make the old one look obsolete and vendors <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>trouble</b> selling their CDs.|$|E
5|$|Although Charles {{had been}} criticised {{severely}} for granting the large ransom payment to the Vikings, {{he had other}} more critical issues to deal with at the same time, including disputes with his brothers, regional revolts and disgruntled nobles, as well as pressure from abroad. Since he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>trouble</b> trusting his own counts to assemble and lead troops to defeat Ragnar's large force militarily, paying them off instead would buy Charles time, and possibly peace from further Viking raids—at least in the near future.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} it would," [...] said Eveline Annersly. [...] "Still, I don't think it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>troubled</b> {{you when you}} first came out. That is not so very long ago, is it?" ...|$|R
60|$|The {{expedition}} flew without false shame. It {{is to be}} doubted {{whether one}} of Albert's calibre <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>troubled</b> to attack such small game, {{but it was the}} firm opinion of the Wrykyn fags and the Judies that he and his men were to be avoided.|$|R
50|$|According to Kinan, {{women who}} behaved badly passed to other {{businesses}} where working conditions were worse. The owner of Sheik testified {{during the trial}} {{that he had had}} problems with Kinan and another woman and had intended to fire them. However, he never did, which suggests that he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>trouble</b> replacing them.|$|R
25|$|However, {{were the}} border to remain open long term, Gaza's workers and {{manufacturers}} who {{had worked in the}} more upscale Israeli market before layoffs during the Second Intifada <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>trouble</b> competing in Egypt's low-wage economy, according to West Bank economist Nasser Abdel Karim.|$|E
25|$|The {{character}} of Harry Sullivan {{was created by}} the production team when it was expected that the Fourth Doctor would be played by an older actor who <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>trouble</b> with the activity expressed by his predecessor. The role went to 40-year-old Tom Baker, and the part of Harry, no longer required for the action role, was reduced.|$|E
25|$|However, Moscow under Luzhkov invited several {{restrictions}} to this rule, partially {{keeping the}} old system. Each non-resident, who {{arrives in the}} city, must register with the local police department within 90 days of their arrival. The fine for noncompliance is 2500 rubles of penalty, {{and he or she}} <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>trouble</b> getting legal employment. Moscow police frequently ask for people's identification to check whether they have a propiska.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "they're {{both men}} of some ability, with signs of grit in them, though I don't {{know that it}} <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>troubled</b> me if I had heard no more of the Shasta. Now I'm a little late, {{and it will be}} to-night before I'm back from the city." ...|$|R
60|$|The bright, black eyes, {{which had}} just {{commenced}} {{an examination of}} the room by a careful scrutiny of the smoke-grimed ceiling, descended and fixed themselves upon the one clearly defined bald patch upon his head that, had he been aware of it, <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>troubled</b> Mr. Peter Hope. But the full, red lips beneath the turned-up nose remained motionless.|$|R
6000|$|... "But you <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>trouble</b> {{with your}} pigs," [...] Mrs. O'Halloran said. [...] "The Spanish pigs are wild, fierce-looking beasts, {{and would never}} be content to share the cottages." ...|$|R
25|$|Very early on, the Central Pacific {{learned that}} it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>trouble</b> {{maintaining}} an open track in winter across the Sierras. At first they tried plowing the road with special snowplows mounted on their steam engines. When this was only partially successful, an extensive process of building snow sheds {{over some of the}} track was instituted to protect it from deep snows and avalanches. These eventually succeeded at keeping the tracks clear for all but a few days of the year.|$|E
25|$|The Nationals {{would get}} {{off to a slow start}} as coach Al Cervi was fired and {{replaced}} by Paul Seymour. Under Seymour the Nats would rebound and finish the 1956–57 season in second place with a record of 38–34. In the playoffs the Nats <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>trouble</b> knocking off the defending champion Philadelphia Warriors advancing to the Eastern Finals with 2 straight wins. However, the Nats would be swept in 3 straight games by the eventual champions, the Boston Celtics.|$|E
25|$|When Courtney was {{deciding}} which men {{to put on}} his Cornell crew, he would pick men of high moral character and strong in their studies, not just for their athletic ability. He would also try to ascertain their disposition and temperament. Courtney preferred men that were methodical and systematic. It was his view that if one of the rowers was a disturbing element he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>trouble</b> producing a fast crew. Courtney also maintained absolute control of the crew, and would remove and substitute anyone if he believed it would help the crew succeed.|$|E
50|$|James Spotila et al. (1991) {{suggest that}} the large body size of Brontosaurus and other sauropods <b>would</b> <b>have</b> made them unable to {{maintain}} high metabolic rates, as {{they would not be}} able to release enough heat. However, temperatures in the Jurassic were 3 degrees Celsius higher than present. They assumed that the animals had a reptilian respiratory system. Wedel found that an avian system <b>would</b> <b>have</b> allowed them to dump more heat. Some scientists have argued that the heart <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>trouble</b> sustaining sufficient blood pressure to oxygenate the brain.|$|R
60|$|The Western women usually moved, and {{certainly}} spoke, {{with an almost}} superfluous vivacity and alertness. There was in them a feverish activity, which contrasted with the English deliberation, which had sometimes exasperated him. Now he felt that this slowness of movement was born of the tranquillity of the well-trimmed land, {{and he realized that}} it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>troubled</b> his sense of fitness if this girl had clattered down across the stones hurriedly and noisily.|$|R
60|$|What {{was left}} of Babington then went to his seat. He felt that his {{reputation}} as an artistic player of the game had received a shattering blow. Then there was the imposition. This in itself <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>troubled</b> him little. To be kept in on a half-holiday is annoying, {{but it is one}} of those ills which the flesh is heir to, and your true philosopher can always take his gruel like a man.|$|R
25|$|Knox {{attended}} Dulwich College. He {{played two}} matches for Surrey in 1904 without achieving a great deal, but the following year, aided by some fiery pitches at The Oval, advanced {{so much that}} he was an excellent backup to Walter Lees in a major Surrey revival. Although he was expensive on true pitches Knox took 129 wickets for less than 22 runs each, and his promise was clearly noted, though even then the length (over 20 metres – very long for the time) of his run-up was seen as taking a great deal of energy out of him and it was thought Knox <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>trouble</b> coping with arduous seasons.|$|E
25|$|In early 1922, Parnok {{returned}} to Moscow with Erarskaya and was assisted by Vladimir Mayakovsky, who helped her find lodging {{and join the}} Writer's Union. Almost {{as soon as she}} arrived, she began experiencing trouble with the censors. Her attempts to help Maximilian Voloshin publish a collection of poems were repeatedly refused. When she tried a few months later to publish a collection of her own works, Centuries-Old Mead, the censors stopped the publication because there were too many religious references. Centuries-Old Mead was placed in stasis by the censorship bureau and never made it to press. She also feared that The Vine <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>trouble</b> with the censors because of its references to God. She had learned from previous experience that religious references were problematic. By fall, she was ill, suffering from both bronchitis and stomach problems caused by her Graves' disease. Erarskaya was also sick, having contracted tuberculosis.|$|E
25|$|Until the {{initiation}} ceremony and induction into {{the society and}} the receiving of the word, the horseman who were not {{members of the society}} but potential candidates <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>trouble</b> with horses. This would often be caused by older ploughmen who were members of the society tampering with their horses. They would put things like tacks under the horse's collar to cause it to behave irrationally. This would be unknown to the potential candidate as the techniques for training and controlling the horses were not yet given to him. Most of these techniques were based on the horse's sharp sense of smell. Foul substances placed in front of the horse or on the animal itself would cause it to refuse to move forward. This technique is known as jading and is still used by horse trainers today. There were also pleasant smelling things that were used to make a horse move forward or calm down. If the substance was an oil it could be wiped on the trainer's forehead, they would then {{stand in front of the}} animal and the smell would draw it towards them. This practice was often used in taming unruly horses. There were also pleasant smelling and inviting materials, such as sweets, that the horseman could keep in their pocket in order to calm, attract, and subdue a crazed horse. Keeping these techniques secret, along with the myth that there was a word that only the horseman knew that gave them and them alone power over horses helped guarantee their reputation, prestige, job security, and pay. The same type of logic and protection of trade secrets can be seen among modern magicians who keep their tricks secret and only share them with other members of their trade.|$|E
60|$|Mrs Blimber replied, {{with a sweet}} {{smile and}} a shake of her sky-blue cap, that if Sir Barnet could have made her known to Cicero, she <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>troubled</b> him; but such an {{introduction}} not being feasible, and she already enjoying the friendship of himself and his amiable lady, and possessing with the Doctor her husband their joint confidence in regard to their dear son--here young Barnet was observed to curl his nose--she asked no more.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't see why {{you worry}} about that, Carrie. If he had gone out to Cadiz or Oporto, as your uncle intended, you don't suppose the people there <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>troubled</b> {{themselves}} about him. He <b>would</b> just <b>have</b> gone his own way. You went your own way, didn't you? And it is mighty little you troubled yourself about what your uncle was likely to say, when you took up with an Irishman in a marching regiment; and I don't {{see why you}} should trouble now.|$|R
25|$|His {{opponent}} Roy Jenkins {{believed that}} he <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> been a great chancellor – with youthful memories of the unemployment of the 1930s and adult experience of {{the lower levels of}} the postwar era Macleod thought unemployment higher than 300,000 was too high, and so <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>trouble</b> adjusting to the new economic realities of the 1970s – but still <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been a better chancellor than Barber. He was already ill and old for his years, so <b>would</b> probably not <b>have</b> succeeded Heath as party leader, but might have prevented Thatcher from doing so.|$|R
500|$|In general, though, Rangel {{said that}} he wanted to [...] "pick up the pieces and move on", and he {{predicted}} that even though Republicans were in the majority again, they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>trouble</b> uniting with newer members beholden to the Tea Party movement. He was also the first elected politician to use the now-defunct Visible Vote mobile app to interact directly with his constituents.|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} [...] "Cold Station 12", Doctor Arik Soong and the Augments he {{secretly}} raised depart {{the space}} station, taking with them 1,800 frozen Augment embryos preserved {{from the time of}} the Eugenics Wars. Before leaving, Malik steals several pathogen samples from the station and sets the containment fields to fail. In [...] "The Augments", Captain Archer restores stasis around the central compound, and is beamed from space to safety, with the Enterprise in pursuit of Soong, Malik, and the Augments on their stolen Bird of Prey. Soong and the Augments arrive in Klingon space where he shares his plan: Soong intends to hide out in a region [...] where Starfleet <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>trouble</b> tracking them down. [...] Malik objects to Soong's plan, noting that Khan Noonien Singh also ran away on the SS Botany Bay.|$|E
500|$|When Myola was recaptured in October, a Main Dressing Station (MDS) was {{established}} there, manned by the 2/4th Field Ambulance and a surgical {{team from the}} 2/9th General Hospital. On 1 November, 438 patients were held at Myola. Three days later, Kokoda was back in Australian hands and an MDS established there. It was hoped that aircraft could land at Myola and evacuate the sick and wounded, but Myola was [...] above sea level, and the pilots reported that a fully loaded aircraft {{would not be able}} to take off or land at that altitude, and <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>trouble</b> clearing the surrounding hills. Risking the precious transports seemed inadvisable. Five light aircraft were made available: three Stinson L-1 Vigilants, a De Havilland DH.50, and a Ford Trimotor. Two Stinsons evacuated 35 patients, and the Ford another eight from Myola, but the Ford and a Stinson crashed while attempting to land at the Port Moresby end of the lake bed, which had become soft after recent rains, on 22 and 24 November respectively. Over time, more than 200 patients recovered sufficiently to return to their units. Walking wounded were sent down the track, while those unable to walk were carried to Kokoda by Papuan carriers, and flown out from there. The last seven walking cases left for Ilolo on 16 December, and the last four stretcher cases for Kokoda on 18 December; the MDS at Myola closed the following day.|$|E

6000|$|... "You are a {{valuable}} {{man in this}} community, Mr. Marshall, and Mr. Forbes seemed to think the Hopkins {{people were trying to}} get you into trouble. Of course it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> caused <b>trouble</b> <b>had</b> these men voted." ...|$|R

2500|$|Film writer Peter Flint also agrees {{and points}} out other {{benefits}} to that style: [...] "He shot economically, eschewing the many protective shots favored by timid directors, and edited cerebrally so that financial backers <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>trouble</b> trying to cut scenes." [...] Huston shot most of his films on location, working [...] "intensely" [...] six days a week, and [...] "on Sundays, played equally intense poker with the cast and crew." ...|$|E
2500|$|Pinyin {{was created}} {{based on the}} {{pronunciation}} of Standard Chinese, a variety of Mandarin Chinese. Regional accents are prevalent in Mandarin among both native and nonnative speakers. This means {{that a significant number}} of Mandarin speakers <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>trouble</b> distinguishing a number of similar-sounding syllables of pinyin, such as c and ch, s and sh, z and zh, n and ng, [...] h or hu and f, or n and l. Fuzzy pinyin or fuzzy input (模糊音) is a feature that allows a user to input those similar-sounding vowels or consonants {{as if they were the}} same thing. It also has disadvantages as the user must choose the correct characters or words from a longer list of [...] "homophones".|$|E
2500|$|They were {{bolstered by}} the arrival of fresh Czechoslovak and Polish squadrons. These had been held back by Dowding, who mistakenly thought non-English {{speaking}} aircrew <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>trouble</b> working within his control system: Polish and Czech fliers proved to be especially effective. The pre-war Polish Air Force had lengthy and extensive training, and high standards; with Poland conquered and under brutal German occupation, the pilots of No. 303 (Polish) Squadron, the highest-scoring Allied unit, were strongly motivated. Josef František, a Czech regular airman who had flown from the occupation of his own country to join the Polish and then French air forces before arriving in Britain, flew as a guest of 303 Squadron and was ultimately credited with the highest [...] "RAF score" [...] in the Battle of Britain.|$|E
5000|$|The {{authorities}} erected an iron grille {{to separate}} Helen and Leon Levy (as whites) {{from us and}} a second partition to separate them from Lilian and Bertha Gxowa (as African women) ...

5|$|Jerry Goldsmith had {{composed}} {{the music for}} The Motion Picture, but {{was not an option}} for The Wrath of Khan given the reduced budget; Meyer's composer for Time After Time, Miklós Rózsa, was likewise prohibitively expensive. Bennett and Meyer wanted the music for the film to go in a different direction, but had not decided on a composer by the time filming began. Meyer initially hoped to hire an associate named John Morgan, but Morgan lacked film experience, which <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>troubled</b> the studio.|$|R
60|$|The meal, like so {{many that}} Francesca and Comus had eaten in each other's company of late, was a silent one. Now that the full {{bearings}} of the disaster had been discussed in all its aspects {{there was nothing more}} to be said. Any attempt at ignoring the situation, and passing on to less controversial topics <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been a mockery and pretence which neither of them <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>troubled</b> to sustain. So the meal went forward with its dragged-out dreary intimacy of two people who were separated by a gulf of bitterness, and whose hearts were hard with resentment against one another.|$|R
