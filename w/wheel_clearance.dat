This {{reduces the}} required cable pull, making them compatible with brake levers intended for cantilever brakes. Mini V-brakes retain advantages specific to V-brakes such as not requiring extra cable stops.

5000|$|One form of {{construction}} that sets Rayne apart from many other board manufacturers is {{their use of}} what they call [...] "fat bottom" [...] construction. [...] "Fat bottom" [...] was introduced with the re-release of the Avenger in 2013, and has become increasingly prevalent within the Rayne lineup. Boards with a fat bottom construction feature a thick bamboo core going {{down the middle of the}} deck that tapers off towards the edges where wider layers of bamboo are then applied. The result is a thinner and lighter board, as well as providing for more <b>wheel</b> <b>clearance.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Developed {{specifically}} for NASCAR racing, the Superbird, a modified Road Runner, was Plymouth's follow-on design to the Charger Daytona fielded by sister company Dodge {{in the previous}} season. The Charger 500 version that began the 1969 season was the first American car to be designed aerodynamically using a wind tunnel and computer analysis, and later was modified into the Daytona version with nose and tail. The Superbird's smoothed-out body and nosecone were further refined {{from that of the}} Daytona, and the street version's retractable headlights (made of fiberglass) added nineteen inches to the Road Runner's original length. The rear wing was mounted on tall vertical struts that put it into less disturbed air thus increasing the efficiency of the downdraft that it placed upon the car's rear axle. For nearly 30 years the mathematic formula used to determine the exact height of the enormous wing was thought to be a highly guarded Chrysler secret. In the 1990s a retired Chrysler project engineer (falsely) claimed publicly that the height was determined in much simpler fashion: it was designed to provide clearance for the trunk lid to open freely. By coincidence, the height of the wing was at the optimum level for maximum downforce. The rear-facing fender scoops were to hide cutouts. These cutouts were to allow <b>wheel</b> <b>clearance</b> due to the taller, wider wheels and lowered the height of the vehicle for NASCAR competition. On Daytonas, the scoops were actually for ventilating trapped air from the wheel wells in order to reduce under fender air pressure and lift. For standard road going Superbirds the covers or [...] "air extractors" [...] were a cosmetic enhancement. Ground clearance was 7.2 in.|$|E
40|$|Volvo Cars {{proving ground}} in HÃ¤llered {{is a place}} for cars to be tested around the clock, in the most rough environments. Testing the <b>wheel</b> <b>clearance</b> today is done by putting {{modelling}} clay in the wheelhouse, and then drive through several different obstacles. By doing this, the <b>wheel</b> <b>clearance</b> can be measured where the wheel has left a mark on the modelling clay. The thesis is based on a question if <b>wheel</b> <b>clearance</b> testing can be performed on a test rig, and therefore the issue we decided to work with was what differences in the modelling clay marks could be observed between running the test on the proving ground and simulating the same movement on the test rig. We have made several limitations, the most obvious limit we have chosen is to only focus on the movement in vertical direction. We used a camera measuring system that was mounted onto our test vehicle. It measures the position from a set origin to the wheel centre in three dimensions over time. We ran tests out on the proving ground, focusing on one obstacle. The test was run for two reasons, to get the imprints from the tire on the clay and to obtain the measurement data from the measuring system. We then identified the maximum reached positive wheel position in vertical direction by using a MATLAB script. We then used the test rig to position the front wheels in the same three-dimensional positions as when the wheel centre reached its maximum vertical value according to the measuring data mentioned above. We measured the imprints of the wheel in the modelling clay after the positioning procedure in the test rig and began to compare the different clay imprints and evaluating the results. The measurements indicated {{a significant difference between the}} two, even though the positioning used in the three dimensions were identical. We discuss the possible reasons for any source of error that we could think of. We also come up with suggestions how to reduce the impact of some of the sources of error...|$|E

The visible traces show the hurried building and poor planning. Steep grades, large rocks, poor water control, and swampy areas all contributed to a rough trail. Most of the road is still used by ranchers, fishermen, and hunters, however modern 4 wheel drive vehicles are much better suited to the rocky climbs and dry stretches [...] Not much is left {{of any of the}} forts east of Canyon City.

40|$|AbstractA {{production}} {{technology for}} a geometrically accurate Solid {{model of a}} helical-gear set in the SolidWorks package is suggested. The construction stages are calculation, development of blanks, development of tooth rims and involute gears. The involute meshing is formed in the normal as related to a tooth curve plane using equivalent wheels and making involutes according to parametric equations. The closed region of a tooth contour is pressed out along the trajectory, a helix with an angle of lead equal to the helix angle is used in such capacity. Then the tooth is distributed following the Circular Sketch Pattern along a blank, forming a rim of the wheel. The gear assembly is carried out {{with the help of}} a layout sketch. The teeth are matched with gashes by using a pitch point and cutting the teeth by a plane which is perpendicular to a transmission axis. The accuracy of a gear model is analyzed by clearance measuring, interference, parameters of rims, and sizing of contact patterns. The examination shows a lack of interference between the gear and the <b>wheel,</b> side <b>clearance</b> satisfies mating H, E, tolerance h, which corresponds to the highest class of accuracy, specified by a state standard GOST 1643 - 81 for the helical-gear set...|$|R

40|$|In {{contrast}} to standard track, where train-induced vibrations are mainly related to track irregularities, the dynamic response of turnouts {{is dominated by}} the nonuniform geometry of wheel-rail contact and variations in track flexibility. Such peculiarities are responsible for the development of strong vibrations during train passage. At the point of rail intersection (heart), where a gap is unavoidable to provide the necessary <b>wheel</b> flange <b>clearance,</b> the system is subjected to severe impact loading, critical for the design and maintenance of railway tracks. Especially in the case of urban turnouts, the vibration levels are also directly related to the exerted noise nuisance. This paper presents two analysis methods to simulate train-turnout interaction. The first is based on a multibody model of the trainset and of wheel-rail contact, utilizing a simplified finite element model for the turnout. The second focuses on the details of the turnout, which is modeled with three-dimensional finite elements, utilizing a simplified model to compute impact loading due to wheel passage over the flange-way gap. The two models are validated against line measurements on three different urban metro and tram networks. A parametric analysis is conducted to investigate the role of soil-structure interaction, which is shown be important for the dynamic response of the system. Â© 2009 ASCE...|$|R
40|$|Connecting {{parallel}} rail tracks, scissors crossovers typically {{consist of}} four turnouts and a central diamond crossing, while flange-way gaps provide <b>wheel</b> flange <b>clearance</b> at {{the points of}} rail intersection. Guardrails, supported through base-plates, provide wheel guidance {{in the area of}} the gap. In the Athens Metro, within less than a year in operation, fracturing of a vast number of guardrail support base-plates was reported. This paper documents the methodology and results of a comprehensive investigation of the possible causes of these failures. This premature cracking was initially investigated through stress and acceleration measurements. Subsequently, a three-dimensional finite element model was developed to analyse the dynamic behaviour of the system with and without foundation deficiencies. It was unveiled that only the model with foundation deficiencies could reproduce the measured response. The role of foundation-structure interaction (FSI) proved doubly detrimental for the performance of the system: (i) the initial defective curved shape of the sleepers induced large bending pre-stress on the base-plates, and (ii) the defective gap-dominated foundation increased the flexibility of the system leading to further excessive sleeper bending, and thereby to increased distress of the base-plates. The combination of the two deficiencies was deemed responsible for the observed failure. The method of installation was shown to be of critical importance for the durability of the crossover.

40|$|Hybrid tree {{harvester}} with a 60 [*]kW {{diesel engine}} {{combined with a}} battery pile could be a âgreenâ forest harvesting and transportation system. With the new design, the diesel engine maintains a constant engine speed, keeping fuel consumption low while charging the batteries that drive the forwarder. As an additional energy saving method, the electric motors work as generators {{to charge the battery}} pile when the vehicle moves downhill. The vehicle is equipped with six large <b>wheels</b> providing high <b>clearance</b> over uneven terrain while reducing ground pressure. Each wheel is driven via a hub gear by its own alternating current motor, and each of the three wheel pairs can be steered independently. The combination of the diesel engine and six electric motors provides plenty of power for heavy lifting and pulling. The main component parameters of the drive system are calculated and optimized with a set of dynamics and simulated with AVL Cruise software. The results provide practical insights for the fuel tree harvester and are helpful to reduce the structure and size of the tree harvester.
