The SIT E Hub <b>will</b> <b>engage</b> the industry to work on projects that enhance the value chain of relevant technology. To do this, SIT plans to draw on the talent pool of students, faculty and professional officers to manage industry capstone projects, and projects arising from the Integrated Work Study Programme.|$|E
5|$|Antbirds are diurnal: they feed, breed {{and defend}} territories during the day. Many {{of the family}} are, however, {{reluctant}} to enter areas of direct sunlight where it breaks through the forest canopy. Antbirds <b>will</b> <b>engage</b> in anting, a behaviour in which ants (or other arthropods) are rubbed on the feathers before being discarded or eaten. While this has conventionally been considered a way to remove and control feather parasites, {{it has been suggested}} that for antbirds it may simply be a way to deal with the distasteful substances in prey items.|$|E
5|$|Giraffe groups {{tend to be}} sex-segregated {{although}} mixed-sex groups made {{of adult}} females and young males are known to occur. Particularity stable giraffe groups are those made of mothers and their young, which can last weeks or months. Social cohesion in these groups is maintained by the bonds formed between calves. Female association appears {{to be based on}} space-use and individuals may be matrilineally related. In general, females are more selective than males in who they associate with in regards to individuals of the same sex. Young males also form groups and <b>will</b> <b>engage</b> in playfights. However, as they get older males become more solitary but may also associate in pairs or with female groups. Giraffes are not territorial, but they have home ranges. Male giraffes occasionally wander far from areas that they normally frequent.|$|E

5|$|Meat ants {{engage in}} ritualised fights to {{maintain}} and resolve boundary disputes with neighbouring colonies. When individuals from separate colonies meet, they <b>will</b> <b>engage</b> each other until appeasement occurs. A meat ant detects a foreign worker by intense antennation and gaping of the mandibles, and will also stretch themselves upward to appear taller and larger, suggesting that meat ants {{do this in a}} display of size matching. Once the ants have finished fighting, they will groom themselves and search for another ant. Such disputes between colonies may continue for months or even years in the same area, and escalated fights that result in serious injury or death are rare.|$|E
5|$|Odin {{will make}} {{directly}} for Fenrir and the god Thor, by Odin's side, {{will be unable}} to help him because he will be fighting Jörmungandr. The god Freyr <b>will</b> <b>engage</b> the fiery being Surtr and, since Freyr lacks the sword he gave his servant Skírnir, Freyr will fall after a rough struggle. The god Tyr will fight the hound Garmr and the two will kill one another. Thor will kill the serpent Jörmungandr but after nine steps will collapse to the ground, dead from Jörmungandr's venom. Fenrir will eat Odin, but immediately after Odin's son Víðarr will come forward and set his foot on to the wolf's lower jaw, and grasp its upper jaw, ripping its mouth apart, killing it. Loki and Heimdallr will kill one another and, after their death, Surtr will spray fire over the earth and burn the entire world.|$|E
25|$|When {{whales are}} spotted the catcher ships <b>will</b> <b>engage</b> in pursuit. A 90mm cannon with a grenade tipped harpoon is {{fired at the}} target whale. A rope is trailed from the harpoon {{in order to prevent}} the whale from being lost.|$|E

25|$|Another {{emerging}} {{program is}} their ACI Secondary School Art Connect, an initiative {{that addresses the}} under-representation of Canadian art history in secondary schools through collaboratively created curricula that teachers can use in the classroom. These online resources <b>will</b> <b>engage</b> students {{with a wide range}} of issues through Canadian visual culture, supporting the development of visual literacy.|$|E

25|$|Homosexual pair-bonding can be {{established}} several ways; two of the main ways are pair bonding as partners or as companions. As partners, both animals <b>will</b> <b>engage</b> in sexual activities with each other. In companions bonding, sexual engagement is not necessary in the relationship. This form of homosexuality {{is more of a}} partnership and friendship; they spend all their time together. More than 70 species of birds engage in one of these two bonding.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} {{characteristic of}} A. pallipes is its swarm-founding behavior. In swarm-founding species, {{a large group}} of workers and one or more queens initiate a new colony and subsequently display polygynic behavior. In contrast to independent-founding species that engage in continuous construction of nests, swarm-founding A. pallipes <b>will</b> <b>engage</b> in periodic construction where the nest is rapidly built to sustain a specific population size. After which, the nest size stays static until capacity is reached and subsequent expansion is necessary where thousands of cells can be built within days.|$|E
25|$|So I think {{individual}} {{women will}} react differently; some will not cook that day, some <b>will</b> <b>engage</b> {{in dialog with}} their husband, some will be out at the rallies and demonstrations that will be taking place all over the country. Others will be writing things {{that will help them}} to define where they want to go. Some will be pressuring their Senators and their Congressmen to pass legislations that affect women. I don't think {{you can come up with}} any one point, women will be doing their own thing in their own way.|$|E

25|$|When {{whales are}} spotted the whale {{catchers}} <b>will</b> <b>engage</b> in pursuit. A harpoon cannon with a grenade tipped harpoon is {{fired at the}} target whale. A rope is trailed from the harpoon {{in order to prevent}} the whale from being lost. If the whale is struck and not killed instantly by the explosive tipped harpoon, a second harpoon may be used or the whale may be shot with a rifle until dead. A past method of using a second harpoon to electrocute whales is now forbidden by the IWC. Environmental groups have reported whales being dragged backward and drowned.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{their common}} name, this genus is active during the day, {{as well as}} at night. When disturbed, they <b>will</b> <b>engage</b> in a ferocious hissing and puffing threat display. They may lift the first part of their bodies off the ground in a coil and make a {{powerful}} swiping strike; juveniles have been known to come off the ground. Others specimens may raise the first part of their bodies off the ground, flattening their necks and moving forward, tongue extended, like a small cobra. The rather frantic strikes are often combined with attempts to quickly glide away.|$|E
25|$|The {{defensive}} {{behavior in}} S. septentrionalis often involves {{a large number}} of workers leaving the nest in order to display or attack with their stingers in response to a disturbance. Often, after the wasps leave the nest, they will display their gaster {{in such a way that}} it is perpendicular to the ground and the rest of their body; this behavior is defined as gaster-flagging. From a defensive standpoint, it is likely that gaster-flagging serves as a warning signal to predators that S. septentrionalis <b>will</b> <b>engage</b> in defensive stinging behavior if necessary. Likewise, gaster-flagging could potentially serve as a visual communication method between other members of the colony in order to mobilize them in the presence of a threat.|$|E

25|$|The Film Studies Minor {{provides}} students {{an exciting}} {{opportunity to examine}} the many facets of American and International cinema. Students interested in exploring cinema as a multidimensional art medium <b>will</b> <b>engage</b> {{in the analysis of}} cinematic works of various forms. Study of film genres, history, theories, directors, cultural perspectives and more allow students to gain a robust understanding of cinema as a historical and contemporary means of expression. The interdisciplinary nature of the minor provides investigation of cinematic art through its connection to related fields such as Communication, Literature, Sociology and Visual Arts. Students pursuing the Film Studies Minor exhibit a wide range of interests; from those who plan graduate study in film to those who simply wish to understand better this powerful and influential medium.|$|E
25|$|Heima, {{tied up with}} rope, reveals Shihei's plot {{to seize}} power, {{describing}} each detail and he bemoans his fate, having failed in his mission to kill Kan Shōjō, and having been captured. Hearing of Shihei's treachery, Kan Shōjō becomes enraged, breaking off a branch from the plum tree and striking off Heima's head with it, {{as if it were}} a sword. He asks Shiradayū and Umeōmaru to hurry to the capital, to warn the emperor of Shihei's plans. Knowing that he cannot return to the capital himself, at least not in body, having been formally exiled, he vows to return as an angry spirit. To that end, he vows to journey to the summit of Mount Tenpai, where he <b>will</b> <b>engage</b> in austere disciplines, swear oaths to the gods, and become a ghostly lord of thunders. As he speaks, a storm rises up. His retainers grasp at his sleeves and try to stop him, but he throws them off, and flies off into the sky, already beginning to transform into a thunder spirit.|$|E
25|$|Objectification theory {{suggests}} both {{direct and indirect}} consequences of objectification to women. Indirect consequences include self consciousness in terms that a woman is consistently checking or rearranging her clothes or appearance to ensure that she is presentable. More direct consequences are related to sexual victimization. Rape and sexual harassment are examples of this. Doob (2012) states that sexual harassment {{is one of the}} challenges faced by women in workplace. This may constitute sexual jokes or comments, most of which are degrading. Research indicates that objectification theory is valuable to understanding how repeated visual images in the media are socialized and translated into mental health problems, including psychological consequences on the individual and societal level. These include increased self-consciousness, increased body anxiety, heightened mental health threats (depression, anorexia nervosa, bulimia, and sexual dysfunction), and increased body shame. Therefore, the theory has been used to explore an array of dependent variables including disordered eating, mental health, depression, motor performance, body image, idealized body type, stereotype formation, sexual perception and sexual typing. Body shame is a byproduct of the concept of an idealized body type adopted by most Western cultures that depicts a thin, model-type figure. Thus, women <b>will</b> <b>engage</b> in actions meant to change their body such as dieting, exercise, eating disorders, cosmetic surgery, etc. Effects of objectification theory are identified on both the individual and societal levels.|$|E
