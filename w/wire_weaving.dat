50|$|Traditionally, {{screen cloth}} {{was made with}} metal <b>wires</b> <b>woven</b> with a loom. Today, woven cloth is still widely used {{primarily}} because they are less expensive than other types of screen media. Over the years, different weaving techniques have been developed; either to increase the open area percentage or add wear-life. Slotted opening woven cloth is used where product shape is not a priority and where users need a higher open area percentage. Flat-top woven cloth is used when the consumer wants to increase wear-life. On regular <b>woven</b> <b>wire,</b> the crimps (knuckles on <b>woven</b> <b>wires)</b> wear out faster {{than the rest of}} the cloth resulting in premature breakage. On flat-top <b>woven</b> <b>wire,</b> the cloth wears out equally until half of the wire diameter is worn, resulting in a longer wear life.

40|$|From the {{technological}} {{point of view}} {{it is necessary that}} the phase of warping to be done two or three multiple warp, which results in two or three rolls of the warp final will meet only the warping. To achieve longitudinal striped fabric spinning machines is necessary to have all tensioning mechanism dispensing rolls which requires their special construction. The homogeneity of the fabric {{from the point of view}} of the warp yarns tension must be ensured by synchronizing operation of the tensioning two cutting mechanisms of the two reels on which the wires are wound with a degree of waving and thus the fuel consumption at the different weaving. It is recommended that the design be adopted average float bonds, such that the wires can be wrapped around more than two final reels. In terms of manufacturing technology with longitudinal stripes fabrics have a more complicated and expensive technology to cross-striped fabrics for the manufacture of which technology is simplified. Cross-striped fabrics containing groups of warp threads those linked to floating average is materially different. Due to this degree of crimping of wires in the stripes with different bonds makes their contract to be different, having a direct influence on the wires consumption. The different contraction of <b>wire</b> <b>weaving</b> makes warp yarn length, contained in a linked reports are so different that it requires winding wires with different bonds also differing on the final rolls...|$|E
40|$|A {{novel and}} precise {{characterization}} of the constitutive behavior of solid and laminated research-grade, polycrystalline Galfenol (Fe 81 : 6 Ga 18 : 4) under under quasi-static (1 Hz) and dynamic (4 to 1000 Hz) stress loadings was recently conducted by the authors. This paper summarizes the characterization {{by focusing on the}} experimental design and the dynamic sensing response of the solid Galfenol specimen. Mechanical loads are applied using a high frequency load frame. The dynamic stress amplitude for minor and major loops is 2. 88 and 31. 4 MPa, respectively. Dynamic minor and major loops are measured for the bias condition resulting in maximum, quasi-static sensitivity. Three key sources of error in the dynamic measurements are accounted for: (1) electromagnetic noise in strain signals due to Galfenol's magnetic response, (2) error in load signals due to the inertial force of fixturing, and (3) time delays imposed by conditioning electronics. For dynamic characterization, strain error is kept below 1. 2 % of full scale by wiring two collocated gauges in series (noise cancellation) and through lead <b>wire</b> <b>weaving.</b> Inertial force error is kept below 0. 41 % by measuring the dynamic force in the specimen using a nearly collocated piezoelectric load washer. The phase response of all conditioning electronics is explicitly measured and corrected for. In general, as frequency increases, the sensing response becomes more linear due to an increase in eddy currents. The location of positive and negative saturation is the same at all frequencies. As frequency increases above about 100 Hz, the elbow in the strain versus stress response disappears as the active (soft) regime stiffens toward the passive (hard) regime...|$|E
