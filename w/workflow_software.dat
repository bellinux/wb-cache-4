40|$|Enhanced {{publications}} (EPs) can {{be generally}} conceived as digital publications "enriched with" or "linking to" related research results, such as research data, <b>workflows,</b> <b>software,</b> and possibly connections among them. Enhanced Publication Information Systems (EPISs) are information systems devised {{for the management}} of EPs in specific application domains. Currently, no framework supporting the realization of EPISs is known, and EPIs are typically realized "from scratch" by integrating generalpurpose technologies (e. g. relational databases, file stores, triple stores) and Digital Library oriented software (e. g. repositories, cataloguing systems). Such an approach is doomed to entail non-negligible realization and maintenance costs that could be decreased by adopting a more systemic approach. The framework proposed in this work addresses this task by providing EPIS developers with EP management tools that facilitate their efforts by hiding the complexity of the underlying technologies...|$|R

40|$|The {{evolution}} of Software Engineering methodology, from waterfall to spiral, from spiral to agile, indicates that high concurrency, iterative development and short cycles are key factors for effective Software Engineering. It is widely accepted that supporting (i. e., formalizing controlling, automating and optimizing) concurrent engineering processes {{is needed to}} increase predictability of cost, quality and development time. Unfortunately, current systems (e. g., <b>workflows,</b> <b>Software</b> Configuration Management …) are too simple and deterministic; they do not include real support for concurrent engineering. We claim this shortcoming {{is one of the}} major reasons why current workflow and process support do not significantly help in the support of software engineering. In this paper we present the Celine system, which extends workflows with the definition of high-level executable description of concurrent engineering and therefore contributes to provide effective control over cost, quality and development time. 1...|$|R
