500|$|Walker {{released}} his self-titled debut album in 1993 under Stroud's production. Its first single was [...] "What's It to You;" [...] written by Robert Ellis Orrall and Curtis Wright, this song reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now Hot Country Songs) charts and number 73 on the Billboard Hot 100. Its followup [...] "Live Until I Die" [...] (which Walker wrote), was released {{late in the}} year and became his second consecutive No. 1 in early 1994. After those two singles came the number 11 [...] "Where Do I Fit in the Picture", which was originally the B-side of [...] "What's It to You." [...] The album accounted for a third No. 1 hit in [...] "Dreaming <b>with</b> <b>My</b> <b>Eyes</b> Open", a song that was also featured on the soundtrack to the 1994 film The Thing Called Love. An additional cut from the album, [...] "White Palace," [...] charted at number 67 on the country charts without being released as a single.|$|E

I have not yet found somebody who has told me they've seen the Wall of China from Earth orbit.... I've asked various people, particularly Shuttle guys, that have been many orbits around China in the daytime, and the ones I've talked to didn't see it." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{civilian}} {{who witnessed}} the crash said he heard what he {{believed to be a}} surface-to-air missile being fired immediately before the accident. [...] "I saw <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> when the plane, which was flying low-level, was hit by a rocket and then fell to the ground," [...] Shabelle reporter Maryan Hashi said."

2500|$|... "Let's Go" [...] {{includes}} instrumentation of piano chords, synth bass, synth strings, and {{a hip-hop}} drum beat. The song's chorus is Matt shouting “Let's go let's go let's go let's go!” Allmusic {{said that the}} song [...] "cuts the tempo {{in favor of an}} almost funky late-'90s groove." [...] "Now" [...] was described by Popmatters as a combination of [...] "a style of music outside of the duo's usual comfort zone [...] " [...] with the group's usual musical style. [...] "It's Alright" [...] includes percussion of a kick drum and tambourine, and was considered by Consequence of Sound as a dance-jazz song. Matt said it was one of his favorite songs. [...] "Not That Bad" [...] has instrumentation of martial drums, piano plinks, and a synth brass section. According to Popmatters, when the [...] "synth brass section comes in and the tempo slows down for the chorus, it feels like something big is coming." [...] "Overexposed" [...] is instrumentated with a quick-moving wobbly right-hand synth, keyboard, bass guitar, kickdrum and hi-hat. The song's Pre-Chorus is “Like a picture / I was overexposed / Be-lieve me / I saw you <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> closed,” and the vocals during the chorus are in unison with the keyboard.|$|E
