We have the ship and we have the crew. We’re going around the world, nonstop. And we’re going to do it entirely submerged.|$|E
25|$|In {{environmental}} terms, reuse {{ought to}} be more common than recycling and energy recovery, with both the financial and environmental costs of simple refurbishment of some products being a fraction of original manufacturing costs. If <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to be serious about living in a Circular Economy we need to recognise the value of our waste and ensure resources are kept in the economy for longer, slow down the use of valuable raw materials and ensure that products are reused and materials are recycled rather than landfilled.|$|E
25|$|In September 2011, {{shortly after}} China and Vietnam had signed an {{agreement}} seeking to contain a dispute over the South China Sea, India's state-run explorer, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) said that its overseas investment arm ONGC Videsh Limited had signed a three-year deal with PetroVietnam for developing long-term cooperation in the oil sector {{and that it had}} accepted Vietnam's offer of exploration in certain specified blocks in the South China Sea. In response, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Jiang Yu issued a protest. The spokesman of the Ministry of External Affairs of the Government of India responded by saying that “The Chinese had concerns but <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> by what the Vietnamese authorities have told us and have conveyed this to the Chinese.” The Indo-Vietnamese deal was also denounced by the Chinese state-run newspaper Global Times.|$|E

25|$|Letters {{written by}} early Aboriginal leaders like Bennelong and Sir Douglas Nicholls are {{retained}} as treasures of Australian literature, {{as is the}} historic Yirrkala bark petitions of 1963 {{which is the first}} traditional Aboriginal document recognised by the Australian Parliament. David Unaipon (1872–1967) is credited as providing the first accounts of Aboriginal mythology written by an Aboriginal: Legendary Tales of the Aborigines; he is known as the first Aboriginal author. Oodgeroo Noonuccal (1920–1995) was a famous Aboriginal poet, writer and rights activist credited with publishing the first Aboriginal book of verse: <b>We</b> <b>Are</b> <b>Going</b> (1964). Sally Morgan's novel My Place was considered a breakthrough memoir in terms of bringing indigenous stories to wider notice. Leading Aboriginal activists Marcia Langton (First Australians, 2008) and Noel Pearson ("Up From the Mission", 2009) are active contemporary contributors to Australian literature.|$|E
25|$|The {{target of}} the right-wing vested {{interests}} was a famous annual May Day celebration at the Portella della Ginestra. A {{few days before the}} festivities, Giuliano received a letter that was evidently the culmination of negotiations. After reading it, the bandit chieftain burned it and announced, “The hour of our liberation has come. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to attack the Communists, to go to fire on them on May 1 at Portella della Ginestra.” One of his bandits protested that women and children would be present. The chieftain replied that only leaders would be targeted. Giuliano's behavior before and after the armed action indicate that he believed that he and his men would be offered pardons for their crimes if all went well on May Day, an outcome ostensibly guaranteed by some prominent Sicilian. According to Giuliano's later statements, his main aim of the day was the capture of Girolamo Li Causi, head of the Communist party of Sicily—any other action was a diversionary tactic to facilitate Li Causi's capture. Although scheduled to speak, Li Causi did not attend.|$|E

500|$|Daniels {{announced}} the first tuition freeze {{before the state}} had determined Purdue's funding for the next biennium. [...] Amidst questions about the timing, Daniels argued that he didn't need to wait because [...] "it doesn't matter what the General Assembly does. This {{is the right thing}} to do and <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to do it...the same way families do; the same way some governments do and all businesses do. [...] <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to adjust our spending to what we believe is the available and in this case the fair amount of revenue. [...] I know often with good reason there has been an opportunity in higher education to adjust tuition to match what the place wanted to spend, and I just think we've reached the point where we ought to break that pattern." [...] The first tuition freeze required the university to find $40 million in savings or new revenue. In order to make up for the lost revenue from tuition freezes, Daniels and the Purdue Board of Trustees focused on finding operating efficiencies such as consolidating information technology data centers, investing cash reserves and switching to a consumer-driven health plan for employees.|$|E
