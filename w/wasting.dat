5|$|The {{end of the}} Pleistocene ice {{ages and}} the start of the Holocene began to change the area's climate from a cool, wet pluvial one to dryer {{semi-arid}} conditions similar to that of today. With less water to cut, the erosive ability of the Colorado was greatly reduced. Mass <b>wasting</b> processes thus began to become relatively more important than they were before. Steeper cliffs and further widening the Grand Canyon and its tributary canyon system occurred. An average of two debris flows per year reach the Colorado River from tributary canyons to form or expand rapids. This type of mass <b>wasting</b> is the main way the smaller and steeper side canyons transport sediment but it also {{plays a major role in}} excavating the larger canyons.|$|E

5|$|By far most {{information}} on toxicity of dioxin-like chemicals {{is based on}} animal studies utilizing TCDD. Almost all organs are affected by high doses of TCDD. In short-term toxicity studies in animals the typical effects are anorexia and <b>wasting,</b> and even after a huge dose animals die only 1 to 6 weeks after the TCDD administration. Seemingly similar species have varying sensitivities to acute effects: lethal dose for a guinea pig is about 1µg/kg, but to a hamster {{it is more than}} 1,000µg/kg. A similar difference can be seen even between two different rat strains. Various hyperplastic (overgrowth) or atrophic (<b>wasting</b> away) responses are seen in different organs, thymus atrophy is very typical in several animal species. TCDD also affects the balance of several hormones. In some species, but not in all, severe liver toxicity is seen. Taking into account the low doses of dioxins in the present human population, only two types of toxic effects have been considered to cause a relevant risk to humans: developmental effects and cancer.|$|E

40|$|The key {{topic of}} this paper is to explain the above average {{increase}} of local <b>waste</b> charges in Germany, in addition the special importance of local within national environmental policies. The jump of <b>waste</b> charges, especially since 1990, has originated in the changed institutional setting of <b>waste</b> management, for its part a result of increasing <b>waste</b> material. It includes an expansion of <b>waste</b> management services (for instance, <b>waste</b> treatment, <b>waste</b> disposal), higher technical demands referring to <b>waste</b> disposal (<b>waste</b> incineration, <b>waste</b> disposal sites) and excess capacity of municipal incinerators resulting from a higher percentage of <b>waste</b> recycling.

If the damage is to the nerve pathway (an upper motor neuron lesion) the tongue will curve away from the side of damage, due to action of the affected genioglossus muscle, and will occur without fasciculations or <b>wasting,</b> with speech difficulties more evident. Damage to the hypoglossal nucleus will lead to <b>wasting</b> of muscles of the tongue and deviation towards the affected side when it is stuck out.
