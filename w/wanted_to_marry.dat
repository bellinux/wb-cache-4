While involved with Brody, she also showed interest in Judaism.|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} Cornish and Devonian icons, clotted cream has become entrenched in local folklore. For example, one myth tells of Jenny who enticed the giant Blunderbore (sometimes called Moran) by feeding him clotted cream. He {{eventually}} {{fell in love}} with her and made her his fourth wife. Another myth, from Dartmoor, tells of a princess who <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>marry</b> an elven prince, but according to tradition had to bathe in pure cream first. Unfortunately, a witch who wanted the prince for her daughter kept souring the cream. Eventually, the prince offered the princess clotted cream, which the witch was unable to sour.|$|E
5|$|During her lifetime, Olga's future {{marriage}} {{was the subject}} of great speculation within Russia. Matches were rumored with Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich of Russia, Crown Prince Carol of Romania, Edward, Prince of Wales, eldest son of Britain's George V, and with Crown Prince Alexander of Serbia. Olga herself <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>marry</b> a Russian and remain in her home country. During World War I, Olga nursed wounded soldiers in a military hospital until her own nerves gave out and, thereafter, oversaw administrative duties at the hospital.|$|E

5|$|In Nuenen, Van Gogh {{focused on}} {{painting}} and drawing. Working outside and very quickly, he completed sketches and paintings of weavers and their cottages. From August 1884, Margot Begemann, a neighbour's daughter ten years his senior, joined {{him on his}} forays; {{she fell in love}} and he reciprocated, though less enthusiastically. They <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>marry,</b> but neither side of their families were in favour. Margot was distraught and took an overdose of strychnine, but survived after Van Gogh rushed her to a nearby hospital. On 26 March 1885, his father died of a heart attack.|$|E
5|$|Levin was {{commissioned}} by the BBC to visit musical festivals around the world, broadcasting a series of talks about them. Together with Stassinopoulos, he visited festivals in Britain, Ireland, continental Europe and Australia. He later wrote a book, Conducted Tour (1982) on the same subject. By {{the time it was}} published he and Stassinopoulos were no longer together. At the age of 30, she remained deeply in love with him but longed to have children; Levin never <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>marry</b> or be a father. She concluded that she must break away, and moved to New York in 1980.|$|E
5|$|The {{ruler of}} Poland, Bolesław I, and {{the ruler of}} Kiev, Vladimir I, had {{previously}} fought over the Cherven Towns (in what was later called Red Ruthenia) in a conflict that ended favorably for Vladimir. Furthermore, Bolesław, who already had two wives, <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>marry</b> Predslava, one of Vladimir's daughters, in order to cement ties between the two families. Despite Bolesław's best efforts, the offer was refused and instead he had to accept a less prestigious connection {{to the house of}} Vladimir through the marriage of Bolesław's daughter to Vladimir's son, Sviatopolk. Between 1005 and 1013, Vladimir arranged Sviatopolk's marriage to Bolesław's daughter, whose name has not survived in sources.|$|E

5|$|Ann Marten {{was called}} to give {{evidence}} {{of the events of}} the day of Maria's disappearance and her later dreams. Thomas Marten then told the court how he had dug up his daughter, and Maria's 10-year-old brother George Marten revealed that he had seen Corder with a loaded pistol before the alleged murder and later had seen him walking from the barn with a pickaxe. Lea gave evidence concerning Corder's arrest and the objects found during the search of his house. The prosecution suggested that Corder had never <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>marry</b> Maria, but that her knowledge of some of his criminal dealings had given her a hold over him, and that his theft of the money sent by her child's father had been a source of tension between them.|$|E
5|$|Vaughan Williams's {{recollections}} {{throw some}} light on Ravel's private life, about which the latter's reserved and secretive personality has led to much speculation. Vaughan Williams, Rosenthal and Marguerite Long have all recorded that Ravel frequented brothels. Long attributed this to his self-consciousness about his diminutive stature, and consequent lack of confidence with women. By other accounts, none of them first-hand, Ravel {{was in love with}} Misia Edwards, or <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>marry</b> the violinist Hélène Jourdan-Morhange. Rosenthal records and discounts contemporary speculation that Ravel, a lifelong bachelor, may have been homosexual. Such speculation recurred in a 2000 life of Ravel by Benjamin Ivry; subsequent studies have concluded that Ravel's sexuality and personal life remain a mystery.|$|E
5|$|Wilfrid left Kent for Rome in {{the company}} of Benedict Biscop, another of Eanflæd's contacts. This is the first pilgrimage to Rome known to have been {{undertaken}} by English natives, and took place some time between 653 and 658. According to Wilfrid's later biographer, Stephen of Ripon, Wilfrid left Biscop's company at Lyon, where Wilfrid stayed under the patronage of Annemund, the archbishop. Stephen says that Annemund <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>marry</b> Wilfrid to the archbishop's niece, and to make Wilfrid the governor of a Frankish province, but that Wilfrid refused and continued on his journey to Rome. There he learned the Roman method of calculating the date of Easter, and studied the Roman practice of relic collecting. After an audience with the pope, Wilfrid returned to Lyon.|$|E

5|$|During the turmoil, Harald {{was arrested}} and imprisoned, but the sources {{disagree}} on the grounds. The sagas state that Harald was arrested for defrauding the emperor of his treasure, {{as well as for}} requesting marriage with an apparently fictional niece or granddaughter of Zoe, called Maria (his suit supposedly being turned down by the empress because she <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>marry</b> Harald herself). William of Malmesbury states that Harald was arrested for defiling a noble woman, while according to Saxo Grammaticus he was imprisoned for murder. DeVries suggests that the new emperor may have feared Harald because of his loyalty to the previous emperor. The sources also disagree on how Harald got out of prison, but he may have been helped by someone outside to escape {{in the midst of the}} revolt that had begun against the new emperor. While some of the Varangians helped guard the emperor, Harald became the leader of the Varangians who supported the revolt. The emperor was in the end dragged out of his sanctuary, blinded and exiled to a monastery, and the sagas claim that it was Harald himself who blinded Michael V (or at least claimed to have done so).|$|E
5|$|When Philip of Ibelin died, the High Court {{appointed}} his brother, John of Ibelin, as bailli {{without consulting}} the emperor or Alice. Frederick departed for Cyprus, landing at Limassol on 21 July 1228. Upon arriving, he ordered John of Ibelin {{to account for}} the administration of the revenue of Cyprus during his and his brother's time, but John refused, stating that the revenue had been paid to Alice. Frederick dismissed Ibelin and forced Henry I of Cyprus to swear fealty to him. He also demanded an oath of fealty from the Cypriot noblemen, but they were only willing to submit to him as their king's overlord, declaring that they only owed fealty to Alice who served as regent to their king. Frederick made Aimery Barlais, Gavin of Chenichy, Aimaury of Beisan, Hugh of Jebail and William of Rivet baillis of Cyprus without Alice's consent before departing for Italy in May 1229. Peter I, Duke of Brittany declared that he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>marry</b> Alice, but this was refused on 29 May by Pope Gregory because of consanguinity.|$|E
5|$|With Isabelle Ingaldsthorpe, John Neville {{had a son}} {{and five}} daughters. The eldest was George Neville, Duke of Bedford (c. 1461–1483). It appears that Montagu had <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>marry</b> George to Anne, heiress of the Duke of Exeter; however, she had married the Earl of Dorset by 1466. George {{eventually}} died without issue, having been stripped of his Dukedom in 1478. His first daughter was Anne, who married Sir William Stonor of Stonor in Pyrton, Oxfordshire (and was thus a descendant of William de la Pole, 1st Duke of Suffolk). Elizabeth married firstly Thomas Scrope, 6th Baron Scrope of Masham, who was a dedicated Yorkist for his whole career, and secondly Sir Henry Wentworth of Nettlestead, while Margaret Neville married firstly Sir John Mortimer (who was dead before 12 November 1504), only son of Sir Hugh Mortimer and Eleanor Cornwall, secondly Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk, and thirdly Robert Downes, gentleman. Lucy married firstly Sir Thomas FitzWilliam of Aldwark, North Yorkshire, and secondly Sir Anthony Browne. Finally, Isabel, who married firstly Sir Thomas Huddleston of Millom, Cumberland, (the Huddlestons of Millom were an important regional family and old allies of the Nevilles) and secondly Sir William Smythe of Elford in Staffordshire. Neville's widow remarried, on 25 April 1472, as his second wife, Sir William Norreys of Yattendon.|$|E
