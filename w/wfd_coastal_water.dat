40|$|ABSTRACT: Human {{activities}} on land increase nutrient loads to <b>coastal</b> <b>waters,</b> which can increase phytoplankton production and biomass and associated ecological impacts.

The present study examined the presence and the antibiotic resistance patterns of Enterococcus spp. isolated from the Babolrud River in Babol and <b>coastal</b> <b>waters</b> in Babolsar. Seventy samples of water were collected in various regions of the Babolrud and <b>coastal</b> <b>waters.</b> Isolated bacteria were identified to the species level using standard biochemical tests and PCR technique. In total, 70 Enterococcus spp. were isolated from the Babolrud River and <b>coastal</b> <b>waters</b> of Babolsar. Enterococcus faecalis (68. 6 %) and Enterococcus faecium (20 %) were the most prevalent species. Resistance to chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, and tetracyclin was prevalent.

Spatio-temporal variations among the physico-chemical parameters are observed in the <b>coastal</b> <b>waters</b> of Gulf of Mannar, especially during northeast and post monsoon seasons. It is inferred that the high loadings of pH, temperature, suspended particulate matter, salinity, dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand, chlorophyll a, nutrient species of nitrogen and phosphorus strongly determine the discrimination of <b>coastal</b> <b>water</b> quality.

40|$|The {{definition}} of <b>coastal</b> <b>waters</b> {{in relation to}} EU environmental legislation was clearly stated in the Water Framework Directive. In compliance with this Directive, most of the EU Member States delineated their coastal waters¿ boundaries. However, these delineations are not as complete and homogeneous as could be expected. A clear identification of European <b>coastal</b> <b>waters</b> boundaries is crucial {{for the implementation of}} the Water Framework Directive and the Marine Strategy Framework Directive, which depend on an accurate ecological/environmental assessment of those waters. Hence, {{there is a need for}} a comprehensive and unambiguous delimitation of European <b>coastal</b> <b>waters.</b> This report aims at bridging this gap providing a pan-European mapping of <b>coastal</b> <b>waters,</b> which cover 553, 817 km 2 in 30 seaside countries, 340, 524 km 2 of which pertain to the 22 EU Member States connected to the sea. For this purpose, a comprehensive geographical analysis of the national baselines and transitional waters distribution was performed. A pan-European baseline of 63, 340 km was delineated as a basis for the European <b>coastal</b> <b>waters</b> delimitation. The European <b>coastal</b> <b>waters</b> identified in this work show significant differences with the available national declarations (almost 12 % of the compared area), the latter defining an additional area of 29, 337 km 2 with respect to the former. The largest deviations seem to be due to misinterpretations of the {{definition of}} <b>coastal</b> <b>waters</b> in the Water Framework Directive, although a number of one-sided national modifications to that definition are also observed. This work provides the geographical basis for a full consultation process and discussion about this subject. Our recommendations include setting a clear geographical limit between the Water Framework Directive and the Marine Strategy Framework Directive jurisdiction, revise the possible exemptions in the definition of <b>coastal</b> <b>waters,</b> and discuss their consequences in the assessment of ecological/environmental status.

40|$|This report {{collects}} {{information on}} chemical analytical methods {{for the analysis}} of the new proposed priority substances (PS) of the European Water Framework Directive (WFD) and some existing PS for which the Environmental Quality Standards (EQS) have been changed under the first review of the PS list. First, analytical “standard” methods (ISO, CEN, US EPA) were searched. Then, the EU Member States (MS) were asked via the Chemical Monitoring and Emerging Pollutants (CMEP) expert group to provide validated “in-house methods” used as a national reference and to report their limits of detection (LODs) or quantification (LOQs). Finally, published literature articles were searched to get an overview of today’s analytical performance. Compliance monitoring for the WFD requires the achievement of a LOQ equal or below a value of 30 % of the relevant EQS. The achieved method limits of quantification (LOQs) are therefore compared with 30 % of the EQS, which is 0. 3 × EQS. Very low annual average AA-EQS values in the picogram-per-liter (pg/l) concentration range have been set for several of the new proposed PS: For Cypermethrin 80 pg/l (8 pg/l for <b>coastal</b> salt <b>waters),</b> for Dichlorvos 60 pg/l in <b>coastal</b> <b>waters,</b> for Dicofol 32 pg/l in <b>coastal</b> <b>waters,</b> for 17 -alpha-ethinylestradiol 35 pg/l (7 pg/l in <b>coastal</b> <b>waters),</b> for 17 -beta-estradiol 80 pg/l in <b>coastal</b> <b>waters,</b> and for Heptachlor/-Heptachlorepoxide 0. 2 pg/l (10 fg/l in <b>coastal</b> <b>waters).</b> Dicofol and Heptachlor/-Heptachlorepoxide, for which biota EQS have been set (biota EQS: 33 µg/kg, and 6. 7 ng/kg, respectively), however, are intended to be analysed in biota. Moreover, a very challenging water EQS has been set for the already existing PS Brominated Diphenylethers (BDEs) (49 femtogram-per-liter (fg/l), and 2. 4 fg/l in <b>coastal</b> <b>waters).</b> However, it is intended that BDEs be analysed in biota (EQS: 8. 5 ng/kg). In addition, the water EQS for Polyaromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) has been lowered to 0. 17 ng/l, and a biota EQS of 2 - 10 µg/kg added, which is more easy to reach. In general, {{it is very difficult to}} reach with currently available analytical instruments LOQs in the low pg/l concentration range. A possibility could be the use of gas chromatography (GC) with high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). This technique, however, is not generally available in normal water monitoring laboratories. Also in the field of liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS), instruments with improved sensitivity have become available in the last years. Moreover, lower LOQs can be achieved by extracting higher volumes of water (10 - 1000 liters). These large-volume techniques, however, are very work and time intensive, and very costly, and are therefore not useful for routine WFD compliance monitoring (analysis of one sample per month). The most challenging substances proposed as new PS are: Cypermethrin (EQS: 80 pg/l, and 8 pg/l for <b>coastal</b> salt <b>waters),</b> Dichlorvos (EQS: 60 pg/l in <b>coastal</b> <b>waters),</b> 17 -alpha-ethinylestradiol (EQS: 35 pg/l, and 7 pg/l in <b>coastal</b> <b>waters),</b> and 17 -beta-estradiol (EQS: 0. 4 ng/l, and 80 pg/l in <b>coastal</b> <b>waters).</b> Dicofol, Dioxins and dioxin-like compounds, Heptachlor/Heptachlorepoxide, Hexabromo-cyclododecane (HBCDD), Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), and the BDEs are intended to be analysed in biota. Minor analytical problems could be encountered for the following substances: Aclonifen (EQS: 0. 12 µg/l, and 12 ng/l for <b>coastal</b> salt <b>waters),</b> Bifenox (EQS: 12 ng/l, and 1. 2 ng/l for <b>coastal</b> <b>waters),</b> Cybutryne (=Irgarol) (EQS: 2. 5 ng/l), Diclofenac (EQS: 0. 10 µg/l, and 10 ng/l for <b>coastal</b> <b>waters),</b> Quinoxyfen (EQS: 0. 15 µg/l, and 15 ng/l for <b>coastal</b> <b>waters),</b> and Terbutryn (EQS: 65 ng/l, and 6. 5 ng/l for <b>coastal</b> <b>waters).</b> JRC.
