500|$|The show's writers {{reject the}} idea that The Daily Show has {{become a source of}} news for young people. Stewart argues that Americans are living in an [...] "age of {{information}} osmosis" [...] in which it is close to impossible to gain one's news from any single source, and says that his show succeeds comedically because the viewers already have some knowledge about current events. [...] "Our show would not be valuable to people who didn't understand the news because it wouldn't make sense," [...] he argues. [...] "We make assumptions about your level of knowledge that... if we were your only source of news, you would just <b>watch</b> <b>our</b> show and think, 'I don't know what's happening.'" ...|$|E

Youngberg said, [...] "We're hoping that in thirty years, the kids who <b>watch</b> <b>our</b> show will then be bringing back the next version of DuckTales because they loved what we did so much." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Simpsons writer Al Jean {{commented that}} Grampa {{is often the}} focus of pointed jokes about old people. He said {{the reason for that}} is because the staff is trying to {{illustrate}} how society mistreats the elderly, [...] "and some of it is because people over 55 never <b>watch</b> <b>our</b> show". Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein, former writers on the show, said that they liked to write episodes about Grampa because they are [...] "obsessed" [...] with old people. Weinstein commented that they [...] "both love [...] and seem to really hate them at the same time". He also said that he [...] "enjoys" [...] writing for characters such as Grampa and Mr. Burns because of their [...] "out-datedness", and because he gets to use dictionaries for looking up [...] "old time slang".|$|E

2500|$|Following the 2010 Tonight Show conflict, O'Brien {{announced}} {{on the first}} day of The Legally Prohibited from Being Funny on Television Tour that he had signed a deal with cable network TBS to host a talk show on their late-night lineup, beginning in November 2010. Before the deal was announced, O'Brien initially had reservations about the move, as it would place comedian George Lopez's show, Lopez Tonight, one hour later to midnight, effectively doing to Lopez what NBC had wanted to do with O'Brien. However, Lopez reportedly called O'Brien and expressed his excitement about the move. Lopez went on to state, [...] "I can't think of anything better than doing my show with Conan as my lead-in [...] It's the beginning of a new era in late-night comedy." [...] In an official press release by Turner Broadcasting, it stated that O'Brien had only begun negotiations a week prior to the official announcement of the show. Steve Koonin, President of Turner Entertainment Networks, went on to comment of the announcement, [...] "Conan has been the comedic voice for a generation. TBS already has a huge audience of young comedy lovers, and Conan's show will give these fans even more reasons to <b>watch</b> <b>our</b> network." ...|$|E
2500|$|Xu Sheng {{was known}} for his {{confidence}} and fervent loyalty towards Sun Quan, as demonstrated in the incident when Xing Zhen (邢貞) came to confer the title [...] "King of Wu" [...] (吳王) on Sun Quan. In 220, Sun Quan became a vassal of the state of Cao Wei, which replaced the Han dynasty after the Wei founder, Cao Pi, forced Emperor Xian to abdicate the throne to him. Cao Pi sent Xing Zhen as an emissary to meet Sun Quan and confer the title [...] "King of Wu" [...] (吳王) on him. Xing Zhen behaved arrogantly in front of Sun Quan and incurred much anger from Sun Quan's subjects, including Zhang Zhao and Xu Sheng. Xu Sheng told his colleagues, [...] "Isn't it humiliating to <b>watch</b> <b>our</b> lord submit to Xing Zhen {{and not be able to}} serve him with our lives and help him conquer Xu, Luoyang and Bashu?" [...] Tears rolled down his face. When Xing Zhen heard Xu Sheng's remark, he told an aide, [...] "It's obvious from the reactions of the subjects of Jiangdong that they won't remain subservient for long." [...] Xing Zhen was right, because in 222, Sun Quan declared independence from Wei but continued ruling his domain under the title [...] "King of Wu" [...] before declaring himself emperor in 229.|$|E
2500|$|During the storyline, Inside Soap {{magazine}} had {{a regular}} feature they called [...] "Kat <b>watch!</b> <b>Our</b> {{eye on her}} guy!" [...] {{in which they would}} be [...] "scouring the episodes with a fine-tooth comb to spot any stolen glances, pointed lines of dialogue or suspicious circumstances that might indicate the identity of the fella Kat is having her torrid affair with." [...] In the first few episodes of the storyline, Derek asks for Kat's help to keep Joey in Walford, which Inside Soap said would mean he would owe Kat a favour, and Derek defends Kat when she is insulted by the rival football team's manager. Inside Soap also pointed out [...] "serious" [...] flirting between Jack and Kat, when she teases him about being out of shape, and she names him 'Legs of the match' after the team play their first football match. They spotted that Kat has a [...] "smouldering tete-a-tete" [...] with Max and she knows how frustrated he is by his family problems, and he is also seen on the phone {{at the same time as}} Kat. They said that Michael donating shirts to Kat's football team and Kat giving baby clothes to Michael were clues, especially as there was an [...] "emotional moment" [...] between them. A [...] "charged moment" [...] between Kat and Ray was noted by the magazine, when she injures herself in the pub's kitchen and he helps her. All five suspects are seen with their phones at the same time Kat ends a call from her mystery lover.|$|E
