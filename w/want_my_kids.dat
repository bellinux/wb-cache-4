5000|$|In March 2011, {{one month}} after being elected to Dáil Éireann, Flanagan {{announced}} that he would cease his smoking of cannabis while in Ireland in order to protect his family and focus on the issues for which he stands. He said he still intended to smoke cannabis when abroad. This followed a formal complaint lodged to the Garda Síochána by a Fianna Fáil councillor from Kilkenny about his cannabis use. Flanagan said that: [...] "...my wife and children are the most important people on the planet to me and I dont <b>want</b> <b>my</b> <b>kids</b> to witness the Garda calling to the house."

5000|$|Though {{the group}} officially disbanded in 1996, {{there have been}} fan demands for concert {{performances}} and new albums which caused the intermittent reunions every 4-5 years. Jimmy P.

Jimmy has been quoted as saying: [...] "I moved to Alabama to be close with my family, and to try regain normalcy for my family.

[...] After coming to America Tahir “worked a variety of jobs, mostly in the {{construction}} field and invested in rental properties.” At this point of his life Tahir felt sacrifice was necessary: [...] "I was married to the business rather than married to my wife." [...] Focusing on his businesses left him with little family time. [...] "I <b>wanted</b> to take <b>my</b> <b>kids</b> out of the poverty cycle because I came from a poor family {{and to do that}} I had to work and I did work more than 16, 18, 20 hours a day, seven days a week to get ahead of the bunch." ...|$|R
5000|$|In April 2011, Hall criticized government-mandated {{integration}} and segregation, saying [...] "I watched Minneapolis get destroyed, so I not only didn’t <b>want</b> <b>my</b> <b>kids</b> {{in the school}} system. I took them out of Minneapolis because they ruined our neighborhoods with {{integration and}} segregation." [...] Hall's statements were made {{in an effort to}} reduce schools' emphasis on race and increase their emphasis on literacy for students of all backgrounds. [...] "I am a product of the Minneapolis school system," [...] he explained, [...] "completing all of my years, all the different schools. I graduated with a 6th grade reading ability. I struggled my whole life. We need to teach kids how to read" [...] Hall agrees with the Minnesota's Office of the Legislative Auditor's report which found that the Integration Revenue funding formula has some unintended and potentially negative consequences.|$|E
5000|$|In February 2007, a {{group called}} LOVE (the Livingston Organization for Values in Education) {{challenged}} four books in the Howell High School curriculum, including The Bluest Eye. Black Boy by Richard Wright, Slaughterhouse Five by Kurt Vonnegut, and The Freedom Writers Diary were also challenged. Vicki Fyke, the founder of LOVE, challenged the books due to their images of sex, rape, and incest, claiming that inclusion of these books {{in a high school}} curriculum did not comply with federal child pornography and obscenity laws, and was against Michigan's sexual education laws. In addition to Fyke, some members of the school board and parents were against the curriculum, one arguing, [...] "At the end of the day, they're my kids. I don't <b>want</b> <b>my</b> <b>kids</b> to read books. I don't let them eat just anything...I want you to respect that". The school board Vice President also argued that parents should receive warnings of the type of material that is discussed in their children's curricula, and that students should have the option to avoid a particular book based on content. The National Coalition Against Censorship published a letter in response to the criticism, claiming that scenes involving sex [...] "represent small but essential parts of the novels, consistent with the kind of material that high school students frequently read". Their letter also argued that the books in question [...] "are widely recognized as works of significant literary and artistic merit", and [...] "are widely taught in high schools and colleges around the country".|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the issues raised}} by comparing Santayana’s warning that ‘Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it’ (1905; The Life of Reason) with the future hopes of contemporary teenager Ramon: ‘I <b>want</b> <b>my</b> <b>kids</b> to have a better life than I did. I’d like them to grow up in a more compassionate society’. Pollock (2000; Real Boys Voices). The conundrum raised by these quotations is that since Australia lacks a substantial body of historical writing about its own past and peoples (Indigenous or otherwise) which might appeal to a youth readership, how are we to avoid repeating the horrors of the past? Crew will suggest that perhaps one answer lies {{in the creation of a}} new and engaging historical genre for youth which applies emergent ficto-critical stylistics to the concepts of the Australian Historian, Professor Greg Denning (1994; Mr Bligh’s Bad Language), who advocates, ‘In writing history…I have always found that I needed to give a voice to the dead. I couldn’t give them life, of course, but I could give them a voice. And I could give the living an understanding of the past for the present…’ Denning, G. (2001) A Library Sailor. Limina Vol...|$|E

5000|$|As a child, {{she enjoyed}} wearing make-up and imitating her {{favorite}} stars. She later recalled, [...] "I {{was the only}} girl {{in the first grade}} that routinely powdered and rouged my face." [...] Dennison also remembered, [...] "I never really wanted to be in show business. I just <b>wanted</b> to raise <b>my</b> <b>kids</b> and keep house, but I guess being in the business is just a 'family tradition'." [...] She quit school after the eighth grade and toured the country with her family, often doing her elder sisters' make-up and occasionally singing backup. At age fifteen, she performed solo on stage for the first time. During her first performance, as she remembers, [...] "right off I saw this new piano man (pianist Richard Dennison) and knew he was the fella for me." [...] She and Dennison were married three years later.|$|R

40|$|Despite the oft-heard {{claims that}} current generations are {{stealing}} from future generations by running fiscal deficits, both theory and evidence {{suggest that this}} is either not true or not knowable. Intergenerational justice is not an appropriate lens through which to analyze fiscal issues, {{because there is no}} obvious starting point from which to build a moral consensus about whether current generations owe anything at all to future generations - and even if we do believe that we owe something to future generations, no one has offered a useful method by which we can determine whether we are doing enough for our progeny. Moreover, if we believe that future generations should be made better off than current generations (2 ̆ 2 I <b>want</b> <b>my</b> <b>kids</b> to be richer than I am. 2 ̆ 2), even pessimistic forecasts indicate that future generations will be much wealthier than current generations, meaning that we are already being quite generous to our children and grandchildren. In addition, the recent significant decline in our economic prospects does not argue for a more contractionary fiscal policy in light of concerns about future generations. In fact, when times are bad, there is no conflict between the interests of current and future generations. Spending by the government helps to improve the economy, which encourages businesses to invest in future productivity. This virtuous cycle is even stronger if the government 2 ̆ 7 s spending is itself used to invest in future productivity...|$|E
