25|$|Both the Siegel {{estate and}} Time Warner have appealed Larson's ruling. The Siegel estate claims the judge erred by finding {{most of the}} Superman {{material}} written by Siegel from 1938 through 1943 to be <b>work</b> <b>for</b> <b>hire.</b> Time Warner asserts the Siegel estate had agreed to a settlement that precludes termination, and that the material awarded to the Siegel estate by Judge Larson was actually <b>work</b> <b>for</b> <b>hire.</b> Oral argument was held on November 5, 2012, in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. In January 2013, the Ninth Circuit reversed the 2008 decision, since the October 2001 agreement would have settled the dispute, and ruled the 2001 agreement would be followed.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Pacific Comics, a new, non-newsstand comic book publisher, made a {{groundbreaking}} deal with Kirby {{to publish a}} creator-owned series, Captain Victory and the Galactic Rangers, and the six-issue miniseries Silver Star (later collected in hardcover format in 2007). This, together with similar actions by other independent comics publishers as Eclipse Comics (where Kirby co-created Destroyer Duck in a benefit comic-book series published to help Steve Gerber fight a legal case against Marvel), helped establish a precedent to end the monopoly of the <b>work</b> <b>for</b> <b>hire</b> system, wherein comics creators, even freelancers, had owned no rights to characters they created.|$|E
25|$|On March 26, 2008, in Siegel v. Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc., 542 F. Supp. 2d 1098, 1145 (C.D. Cal. 2008), Judge Larson ruled {{again that}} the Superboy {{character}} was not a <b>work</b> <b>for</b> <b>hire.</b> Larson also held that the 2001 settlement documents did not constitute a contract terminating the Siegel heirs' claim to the Superman and Superboy works. The Siegels regained the copyright to the Superman character, story, and indicia as they appeared in Action Comics #1 (but not prior to or after that). Judge Larson later expanded his ruling to allow the Siegel heirs to claim additional plots, Superman characters, costuming, and indicia.|$|E
500|$|Disagreements {{about the}} {{ownership}} of the story ultimately led Moore to sever ties with DC Comics. Not wanting to work under a <b>work</b> <b>for</b> <b>hire</b> arrangement, Moore and Gibbons had a reversion clause in their contract for Watchmen. Speaking at the 1985 San Diego Comic-Con, Moore said: [...] "The way it works, if I understand it, is that DC owns it for the time they're publishing it, and then it reverts to Dave and me, so we {{can make all the}} money from the Slurpee cups." [...] For Watchmen, Moore and Gibbons received eight percent of the series' earnings. Moore explained in 1986 that his understanding was that when [...] "DC have not used the characters for a year, they're ours." [...] Both Moore and Gibbons said DC paid them [...] "a substantial amount of money" [...] to retain the rights. Moore added, [...] "So basically they're not ours, but if DC is working with the characters in our interests then they might as well be. On the other hand, if the characters have outlived their natural life span and DC doesn't want to do anything with them, then after a year we've got them and we can do what we want with them, which I'm perfectly happy with." ...|$|E

500|$|Author and Ditko scholar Blake Bell {{writes that}} it was Ditko who noted the {{similarities}} to the Fly. Ditko recalled that, [...] "Stan called Jack about the Fly", adding that [...] "ays later, Stan told me I would be penciling the story panel breakdowns from Stan's synopsis". It {{was at this point}} that the nature of the strip changed. [...] "Out went the magic ring, adult Spider-Man and whatever legend ideas that Spider-Man story would have contained". Lee gave Ditko the premise of a teenager bitten by a spider and developing powers, a premise Ditko would expand upon to the point he became what Bell describes as [...] "the first <b>work</b> <b>for</b> <b>hire</b> artist of his generation to create and control the narrative arc of his series". On the issue of the initial creation, Ditko states, [...] "I still don't know whose idea was Spider-Man". Kirby noted in a 1971 interview {{that it was}} Ditko who [...] "got Spider-Man to roll, and the thing caught on because of what he did". Lee, while claiming credit for the initial idea, has acknowledged Ditko's role, stating, [...] "If Steve wants to be called co-creator, I think he deserves [...] ". He has further commented that Ditko's costume design was key to the character's success; since the costume completely covers Spider-Man's body, people of all races could visualize themselves inside the costume and thus more easily identify with the character. Writer Al Nickerson believes [...] "that Stan Lee and Steve Ditko created the Spider-Man that we are familiar with today [...] ultimately, Spider-Man came into existence, and prospered, through the efforts of not just one or two, but many, comic book creators".|$|E

2500|$|In 1935, several {{specific}} piano {{arrangements and}} an unused second verse of [...] "Happy Birthday to You" [...] were copyrighted as a <b>work</b> <b>for</b> <b>hire</b> crediting Preston Ware Orem for the piano arrangements and Mrs. R.R.

A later 2015 lawsuit would find this claim baseless. That specific new lyrics that also included the full text of [...] "Happy Birthday to You", was a copyright on the derivative work.

2500|$|Four years later, in 1999, Harry McMullan III and the Michael Foundation {{published}} a book, Jesus–A New Revelation, which included verbatim 76 of the 196 papers included in The Urantia Book. [...] McMullan and the Michael Foundation subsequently sought a legal declaration that the Urantia Foundation's US copyright in The Urantia Book was either invalid or, alternatively, that the copyright {{had not been}} infringed upon. [...] Urantia Foundation's copyright was held to have expired in 1983 because the book was deemed to have been neither a composite work nor a commissioned <b>work</b> <b>for</b> <b>hire.</b> [...] These two arguments having been rejected, a U.S. court held that, since the Conduit had died prior to 1983, only the Conduit's heirs would have been eligible to renew the copyright in 1983 and, since they had not done so, the Urantia Foundation's copyright on the book had expired and the book had therefore passed into the public domain.

However, in 1993 Windsor-Smith once again found himself in opposition to company employment policies when Valiant decided to adopt the same <b>work</b> <b>for</b> <b>hire</b> practices that he had disliked in Marvel Comics, and became dissatisfied with his position in the company: [...] "They needed me as a figurehead just as much as a creator." [...] He left Valiant soon after Jim Shooter's departure from the company.

Not one of these men ever did a single day's <b>work</b> <b>for</b> <b>hire.</b> They were relieved from poverty. They had an immense advantage.
