5|$|Around {{the same}} time that Météo-France {{assessed}} Hondo to have peaked, the JTWC reported that the storm had attained winds of 230km/h (145mph 1-minute winds), equivalent to a strong Category 4 hurricane. Shortly after reaching peak intensity, the cloud tops around the eye began to warm, meaning that the storm was beginning to <b>weaken.</b> Hondo also turned towards the southwest and kept a steady pace as two subtropical highs began influencing its movement. The storm continued to <b>weaken</b> as cloud tops warmed but remained an intense tropical cyclone as its eye was still well-defined. Hondo briefly re-intensified later on February8 despite the structure of the storm deteriorating. The cyclone maintained intense tropical cyclone status through February10 due to the formation of a large eye which helped maintain the storms structure. Hondo gradually began to <b>weaken</b> due to a combination of decreasing sea surface temperatures and increasing forward motion. On February10, Hondo started a gradual curving path due to a trough located to the south and strengthening high pressure systems to the north. At 0600UTC, the storm was downgraded to a tropical cyclone as winds decreased to 155km/h (100mph).|$|E
40|$|This paper explores several {{patterns}} of consonantal <b>weakening</b> such as voicing and spirantization. Given that such <b>weakening</b> usually applies to either intervocalic or intersonorant obstruents, this paper contends that inherently redundant {{features such as}} [voice] for sonorants or [continuant] for vowels, cannot license their syllabic constituents, thus triggering consonantal <b>weakening.</b> In addition, based on the typology of consonantal <b>weakening</b> such as one-step <b>weakening</b> with voicing or spirantization and full <b>weakening</b> with both voicing and spirantization, this paper maintains that several {{patterns of}} consonantal <b>weakening</b> is the consequence of licensing and more importantly, of constraint relations such as conjunction.

PRELIMINARIES It is a well-known cross-linguistic occurrence that an intervocalic or postvocalic consonant, especially an intervocalic obstruent, tends to become either voiced or spirantized and thus <b>weakened.</b> Based on such several types of consonantal <b>weakening,</b> this paper will first focus on special behavior of redundant features.

5|$|According to a 2007 article, the mite Varroa {{destructor}} {{remains the}} world's most destructive honey bee killer, {{due in part}} to the viruses it carries, including deformed wing virus and acute bee paralysis virus, which have both been implicated in CCD. Affliction with Varroa mites also tends to <b>weaken</b> the immune system of the bees. Dr. Enesto Guzman, an entomological researcher at the University of Guelph in Canada, studied 413 Ontario bee colonies in 2007–08. The presence of Varroa mites within colonies before winter was observed to <b>weaken</b> the immune systems of bees and introduce viruses that led to colony death during the winter. About 27% of hives did not survive the winter, and the Varroa mite was identified as the cause in 85% of the cases. Varroa mites also affect the queen's ability to reproduce, which is detrimental to the survival of the hive. As such, Varroa mites have been considered as a possible cause of CCD, though not all dying colonies contain these mites.|$|E

40|$|The {{endosperm}} is {{a barrier}} for radicle protrusion of many angiosperm seeds. Rupture of the testa (seed coat) and rupture of the endosperm are two sequential events during the germination of Lepidium sativum L. and Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heyhn. Abscisic acid (ABA) specifically inhibits the endosperm rupture {{of these two}} closely related Brassicaceae species. Lepidium seeds are large enough to allow the direct measurement of endosperm <b>weakening</b> by the puncture force method. We found that the endosperm <b>weakens</b> prior to endosperm rupture and that ABA delays the onset and decreases the rate of this <b>weakening</b> process in a dose-dependent manner. An early embryo signal is required and sufficient to induce endosperm <b>weakening,</b> which afterwards {{appears to be an}} organ-autonomous process. Gibberellins can replace this embryo signal; de novo gibberellin biosynthesis occurs in the endosperm and <b>weakening</b> is regulated by the gibberellin/ABA ratio. Our results suggest that the control of radicle protrusion during the germination of Brassicaceae seeds is mediated, at least in part, by endosperm <b>weakening.</b> We propose that Lepidium is an emerging Brassicaceae model system for endosperm <b>weakening</b> and that the complementary advantages of Lepidium and Arabidopsis can be used in parallel experiments to investigate the molecular mechanisms of endosperm <b>weakening...</b>|$|R
