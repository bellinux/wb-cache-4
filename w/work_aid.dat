The Germans occupied Split and refloated the destroyer later that year, but made no efforts to continue work. The ship was scuttled again before the city was taken over by the Yugoslav Partisans in late 1944. Split was refloated once more, but the new Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was able to do little with her before the Tito–Stalin Split in 1948 halted most <b>work.</b> <b>Aid</b> and equipment from the United States and Great Britain finally allowed her to be completed 20 years after construction began. She was commissioned in July 1958 and served as the navy's flagship for most of her career. Split became a training ship in the late 1970s after a boiler explosion. She was decommissioned in 1980, and scrapped six years later.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Recently, porting {{real-time}} collaborative {{services on}} the Internet has been attracting much interest. Mixing packets from all clients {{in a conference}} can lead to diminished speech clarity. In this paper, we describe real-time voice conferencing service framework designed for a Virtual Conferencing Environment. We propose a system designed to accommodate {{a large number of}} participants without losing spontaneity. We surmise that change in speakers addressing the conference should not be abrupt, which transpires when the decision is exclusively based on floor control techniques leading lower quality of conference. We propose a dynamic conference control and media handling of a conference taking into account users behavior. We try to allow users to decide who should have the floor to address the conference instinctively. Highlights of this architecture are scalability, bandwidth saving and improvement in quality of the conference. The contributions of this <b>work</b> <b>aid</b> in faster and user-friendly implementations of collaborative conferencing systems on the Internet. A working prototype has been field tested on a campus wide subnet. ...|$|E
40|$|For several decades, {{there has}} been a debate in the {{philosophical}} literature concerning whether {{those of us who live}} in developed countries are morally required to give some of our money to aid agencies. Many contributors to this debate have apparently taken it that one may simply assume that the effects of the work such agencies do are overwhelmingly positive. If one turns to the literature on such agencies that has emerged in recent decades, however, one finds a number of concerns about such agencies and the work they do that put that assumption in serious doubt. This situation raises a number of pressing questions, many of which have received little or no attention from philosophers. After articulating a number of those questions, I focus mainly on what I call the `Epistemic Question (for potential contributors to aid agencies) 2 ̆ 7 : How can those of us who are not experts in international aid arrive at an estimate concerning the effects of the <b>work</b> <b>aid</b> agencies do that we have at least some good reason to believe accurate...|$|E
40|$|The Coast and Geodetic Survey was {{a profoundly}} {{civilian}} organization, as NOAA is today. Nevertheless, its two greatest transformations were the total mobilizations of the Survey for war; the Civil War under Bache, and World War II under Colbert. Colbert served {{as leader of}} the Survey for 13 years, but he is mainly remembered as the Survey’s director during the four years that the United States was at war. Nevertheless, his service must be framed by the important developments in the Survey that preceded the war. It was a very difficult, yet creative period. The country was still mired in the Great Depression, and the Survey’s ranks remained swollen with staff hired through the government’s <b>work</b> <b>aid</b> programs, performing work that in many cases was quite different from anything the Survey had done before. Yet at the same time, tensions were rising in Europe, and it was increasingly apparent that conflict on an international scale was coming. Leo Otis Colbert (1883 - 1968) had a unique career, but it was also quite similar to the careers of many other officers in the Commissioned Corps. Colbert was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and graduated in engineering from Tufts University in 1907...|$|E

40|$|Aim: The core {{competencies}} of general practitioners (GP) are ordinarily formulated by professional bodies and international organisations, like the World Organization of Family Doctors (Wonca). Official documents are sometimes questioned {{as being too}} comprehensive and products of the drawing board. The aim was to explore clinically oriented GPs own description of the proficiency used in everyday practice. The study could be essential both for GPs and other professionals who work with consultations. Method: Group interviews with GPs selected by regional supervisors and with substantial clinical competence were carried out. The verbatim transcribed sessions were analyzed with a qualitative content analysis approach. Results: Two main categories emerged reflecting the competence: ‘‘Professional readiness’ ’ and ‘‘Working behaviour’’. Professional readiness comprises the inclination of understanding and acting based on the subcategories: medical knowledge modified by experience, knowing the patient, involvement and uncertainty. Working behaviour describes in a more concrete way the doctoring approach and is formed by the subcategories: preparation, the current problem, use of time, body attention, co-operation with other professionals, and record keeping as a <b>work</b> <b>aid.</b> Conclusions: The attributes of competence of GPs empirically have two components: professional readiness and working behaviour. Together they compose a comprehensive picture of the GP’s everyday clinical setting...|$|E
40|$|As the Department of Defense (DoD) {{moves into}} a more agile C 2 environment, added {{requirements}} will be laid on operators and systems – integration with outside systems and organizations, operation {{in an environment where}} rules change daily, and severely limited resources. We foresee an increased reliance on automated support tools – optimizers, schedulers, evaluators – to meet these requirements. These automated tools need to be closely coupled with an operator interface, allowing the operator to: Task and constrain the automated tool, View and understand what the automated tool has done, and Override, correct, and retask the automated tool. This paper describes a mission planning/execution <b>work</b> <b>aid</b> coupled with an automated scheduler. The prototype has been designed using a cognitive approach which concisely presents critical information to allow the operator to rapidly understand and assess the planner’s recommendations. The operator can finely control the scheduling tool, setting constraints and bounds on what the scheduler may affect. The operator can evaluate multiple options suggested by the scheduler, and can retask the scheduler to modify its work. This symbiotic prototype allows the operator and automated tool to collaborate at a cognitive level to arrive at a better solution than either alone could find...|$|E
40|$|The appeal I am {{making is}} (roughly speaking) for aid specialists {{to do more}} to help thoseof us who arenÃÂ¿t aid specialists to arrive at judgements about the effects of the work of(voluntary) aid {{agencies}} that we have at least some reason to think accurate.

40|$|More than a micro-blogging {{service that}} lets users create and read other people’s “tweets ” (text posts or updates that {{are up to}} 140 {{characters}} in length), Twitter fosters both real-life and online relationships. Tweets can range from the mundane to the life threatening. Some see Twitter as a productivity, lifestyle, or even <b>work</b> <b>aid.</b> Twitter profiles can be created for individuals, organizations, celebrities, athletes, companies, and movements—any conceivable entity that wants to establish a real-time feel to its online presence. While incredibly useful and addictive for most, Twitter has {{had its share of}} attacks and history of abuse (see Figure 2).

Spoofing, Hacking, and Other Authentication Issues In early 2007, Nitesh Dhanjani first reported via his blog a scenario that could instigate malicious activities related to Twitter’s services. By using an SMS application called FakeMyText, he was able to post a tweet on a target user’s profile without the owner’s knowledge. An attacker, however, needs to know a target’s phone number to post an unauthorized tweet. While this was a valid and correctable oversight on the part of the application’s creators, the highly publicized hacking of over 30 popular Twitter accounts was largely more avoidable.

40|$|Background: The {{quality of}} {{clinical}} case management is significantly {{determined by the}} quality of prescription. This informed the rational drug use training and which this survey assesses the impact on health care providers in Catholic Church-owned PHC facilities in Northern Nigeria. Method: This a before-and-after training survey on rational drug prescribing profile among 76 health care workers from 67 Catholic Church-owned PHC facilities in Northern Nigeria using structured self- administered questionnaire to collect information on participants′ knowledge and practice of rational drug prescription and audited prescriptions pre and post training. Post-training supportive supervision and on-site mentoring along with <b>work</b> <b>aid</b> were provided participants to re-enforce knowledge and skill taught. ResuIt: Knowledge and practice profile as indicated by their mean scores in both domains significantly improved from 60. 2 ± 16. 0 % to 84. 0 ± 11. 8 % (p< 0. 0001) and 43. 1 ± 12. 9 % to 65. 4 ± 12. 7 % (p< 0. 0001) respectively Proportions of participants with improved prescription profile increase significantly with intervention. Disparity in knowledge and practice profile pre-training was eliminated by the intervention. Drugs per prescription dropped from 6 to between 3 - 5, antibiotics and injections from 78 % to 40 - 60 % and 61 % to 20 - 30 % respectively. Prescriptions from essential drug list and in generic names increased from 67 % to 80 - 90 % and 61 % to 75 - 80 % respectively.

40|$|A five-year {{longitudinal}} study of attrition was done using as subjects 303 first-time, traditional-age freshmen at a small private college in Western Massachusetts. The relationships of grant aid, preferential aid (provided {{on the basis of}} talent or merit), <b>work</b> <b>aid,</b> and loan aid to persistence were examined in a multivariate study which included the variables of socioeconomic status, major field of study, ability measures, high school rank, sex, state of residence, participation in high school athletics or activities, religious preference, date of registration, grade point average, and resident or commuter status. Persisters had higher high school rank, registered earlier, had higher grade point averages, tended to be women, had specific majors at the time of enrollment, and had stated religious preferences. The hypotheses that work assistance and preferential aid are positively related to persistence were supported in a series of discriminant function analyses. The hypothesis that loan aid is negatively related to persistence was partially supported by the multivariate analyses, but this finding may be confounded by changes in Guaranteed Student Loan regulations which occurred 3 years into the study. The hypothesis that grant aid is positively related to persistence was not supported in the mulitvariate analyses. The consistent finding of other studies is that grant assistance is positively related to persistence, but these studies fail to separate grant assistance (based on need) from preferential aid (based on merit). The results of these other studies {{may be due to the}} confounding of need-based and merit-based aid. The results of the study are limited to first-time, traditional-age freshmen at the research site. Nevertheless, the current trend toward increasing amounts of loans and proportionately less grant and work assistance should be reexamined in light of the results. Suggestions for future research on the relationship of financial aid variables to persistence include separation of preferential aid into assistance based on academic merit from assistance based on athletic or other talent, and the addition of a variable related to quality of participation in high school activities. ...|$|E
