5|$|Among Motul de San José and {{its most}} {{important}} satellite La Trinidad de Nosotros, the majority of remains from Trinidad were from aquatic species, while at Motul de San José the majority were from terrestrial species. 10% of animal remains from Motul had been modified to form artefacts, compared with only 4% of animal remains at Trinidad. Artefact remains found at La Trinidad de Nosotros <b>were</b> <b>more</b> likely to be waste products from artefact manufacture while at Motul de San José they <b>were</b> <b>more</b> likely to be artefacts {{at the end of}} their usable life. Aquatic animal products arriving at Motul de San José were far more likely to be consumed by the elite than by commoners, whether used as food or to craft artefacts.|$|E

5|$|Ballistas or springalds were siege {{engines that}} {{worked on the}} same {{principles}} as crossbows. With their origins in Ancient Greece, tension was used to project a bolt or javelin. Missiles fired from these engines had a lower trajectory than trebuchets or mangonels and <b>were</b> <b>more</b> accurate. They <b>were</b> <b>more</b> commonly used against the garrison rather than the buildings of a castle. Eventually cannons developed {{to the point where}} they <b>were</b> <b>more</b> powerful and had a greater range than the trebuchet, and became the main weapon in siege warfare.|$|E

5000|$|Cabinet faces. Solid wood {{remains a}} popular choice for cabinet parts, {{including}} bases, frames, doors, and sides. However, traditional-style solid-wood cabinetry <b>is</b> <b>more</b> expensive and many consumers opt for cabinets that incorporate particle board or plywood to reduce costs. Pricing for solid wood cabinet doors {{depends on the}} wood species used. For example, teak <b>is</b> <b>more</b> expensive than cherry, which <b>is</b> <b>more</b> expensive than maple, which <b>is</b> <b>more</b> expensive than oak. Similarly, solid wood <b>is</b> <b>more</b> expensive than plywood which, in turn, <b>is</b> <b>more</b> expensive than particle board or similar sheet goods.|$|R

5|$|Dissenting {{religious}} practitioners also widely {{resented the}} treatment {{they received from}} the Lutheran State Church through the Conventicle Act. Conflicts between local worshipers and the new churches were most explosive in the countryside, where dissenting pietist groups <b>were</b> <b>more</b> active, and <b>were</b> <b>more</b> directly under the eye of local law enforcement and the parish priest. Before non-Lutheran churches were granted toleration in 1809, clampdowns on illegal forms of worship and teaching often provoked whole groups of pietists to leave together, intent on forming their own spiritual communities in the new land. The largest contingent of such dissenters, 1,500 followers of Eric Jansson, left in the late 1840s and founded a community in Bishop Hill, Illinois.|$|E

50|$|Mules are {{preferred}} {{because they}} <b>are</b> <b>more</b> tolerant to heat than horses.

Horses <b>are</b> <b>more</b> {{likely to suffer from}} exhaustion when compared to mules. Since mules are relatively slower than horses they are much safer to ride than horses. It is cheaper to rear a mule than a horse because they consume less. Lastly, mules <b>are</b> <b>more</b> enduring than a horse and can live longer.|$|R
5|$|In a 2013 study, Yule et al. {{looked into}} mental health variances between Caucasian heterosexuals, homosexuals, bisexuals, and asexuals. The results of 203 male and 603 female {{participants}} {{were included in}} the findings. Yule et al. found that asexual male participants <b>were</b> <b>more</b> likely to report having a mood disorder than other males, particularly in comparison to the heterosexual participants. The same was found for female asexual participants over their heterosexual counterparts; however, non-asexual, non-heterosexual females had the highest rates. Asexual participants of both sexes <b>were</b> <b>more</b> likely to have anxiety disorders than heterosexual and non-heterosexual participants, as were they more likely than heterosexual participants to report having had recent suicidal feelings. Yule et al. hypothesised that some of these differences may be due to discrimination and other societal factors.|$|E
