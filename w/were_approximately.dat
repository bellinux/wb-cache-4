5|$|The K–Pg {{extinction}} had {{a profound}} effect on the evolution of life on Earth. The elimination of dominant Cretaceous groups allowed other organisms to take their place, spurring a remarkable series of adaptive radiations in the Paleogene. The most striking example is the replacement of dinosaurs by mammals. After the K–Pg extinction, mammals evolved rapidly to fill the niches left vacant by the dinosaurs. Also significant, within the mammalian genera, new species <b>were</b> <b>approximately</b> 9.1% larger after the K–Pg boundary.|$|E

For multi-layer fluvial successions, the lower portion was more easily eroded, and therefore {{it was difficult to}} completely preserve the bottom meandering belt. On a geological timescale, the meandering channel was more prone to reworking. During meandering channel evolution, the direction of diverging thalweg trajectories indicated that the upstream bar was subjected to powerful erosion, whereas the downstream bar experienced expansion, translation, or rotation.|$|R
