25|$|The Western Federation of Miners {{left the}} IWW in 1907, but the IWW wanted the WFM back. The WFM {{had made up}} {{about a third of}} the IWW membership, and the western miners were tough union men, and good allies in a labor dispute. In 1908, Vincent St. John tried to {{organize}} a stealth takeover of the WFM. He wrote to WFM organizer Albert Ryan, encouraging him to find reliable IWW sympathizers at each WFM local, and have them appointed delegates to the annual convention by pretending to share whatever opinions of that local needed to become a delegate. Once at the convention, they could vote in a pro-IWW slate. St. Vincent promised: “… once we can control the officers of the WFM for the IWW, the big bulk of the membership <b>will</b> <b>go</b> <b>with</b> them.” But the takeover did not succeed.|$|E

Friendlies against First Division Stoke and West Bromwich Albion produced wins by 4–2 and 4–1 respectively, and Sheffield United's failure to beat Walsall in their last League match of the season confirmed Small Heath as inaugural Second Division champions.

On 3 March, at a party function organised by the MNS at Shivaji Park, after the expiry of the gag order, Raj announced, [...] "I have not given up my mission", thus signalling to his supporters of continuing his stance on the migrant issue.|$|E

[...] The lyrics also express Western concepts of individualism, and were some of the first popular song lyrics in China to promote self-expression and self-empowerment. This put the song in stark contrast with older music, which had emphasized conformity and obedience. As the narrator, later on in the song, confidently proclaims to the girl that he will [...] "grab her hands" [...] ("") and then she <b>will</b> <b>go</b> <b>with</b> him (""), he suggests in the end that she can love {{the fact that he has}} nothing ("").
