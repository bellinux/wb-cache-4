500|$|Roger Moore, {{the third}} actor to play Bond in the films, said that Craig was a [...] "damn good Bond {{but the film}} as a whole, {{there was a bit}} too much flash cutting [...] it was just like a {{commercial}} of the action. There didn't seem to be any geography and you were wondering <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> <b>was</b> going on." [...] Kim Newman of Empire gave it 4/5, remarking it was not [...] "bigger and better than Casino Royale, [...] perhaps a smart move in that there's still a sense at the finish that Bond's mission has barely begun." [...] However, he expressed nostalgia for the more humorous Bond films. The Sunday Times review noted that [...] "following Casino Royale {{was never going to be}} easy, but the director Marc Forster has brought the brand's successful relaunch crashing back to earth – with a yawn"; the screenplay [...] "is at times incomprehensible" [...] and the casting [...] "is a mess." [...] The review concludes that [...] "Bond has been stripped of his iconic status. He no longer represents anything particularly British, or even modern. In place of glamour, we get a spurious grit; instead of style, we get product placement; in place of fantasy, we get a redundant and silly realism." [...] The Guardian gave a more positive review, rating it as 3/5 stars, and was particularly fond of Craig's performance, saying he [...] "made the part his own, every inch the coolly ruthless agent-killer, nursing a broken heart and coldly suppressed rage" [...] and calling the film [...] "a crash-bang Bond, high on action, low on quips, long on location glamour, short on product placement"; it concludes [...] "Quantum of Solace isn't as good as Casino Royale: the smart elegance of Craig's Bond debut has been toned down in favour of conventional action. But the man himself powers this movie; he carries the film: it's an indefinably difficult task for an actor. Craig measures up." ...|$|E

2500|$|Singer Mike Patton {{was known}} {{to have had a}} bad {{relationship}} with the Red Hot Chili Peppers' frontman Anthony Kiedis, beginning when Kiedis saw Patton performing with Faith No More and accused him of imitating his style. California was scheduled to be released on June 8, 1999, but Warner Bros. Records pushed it back so as not to coincide with the Red Hot Chili Peppers similarly titled album, Californication, which was to be released on the same day. Following the album release date clash, Kiedis had Mr. Bungle removed from a series of summer festivals in Europe; as the headlining act at the festivals, The Red Hot Chili Peppers had final word on the bands that would appear.
