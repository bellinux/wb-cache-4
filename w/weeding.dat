5|$|<b>Weeding</b> rakes: As <b>weeding</b> was a {{constant}} issue in the ancient and medieval Chinese agricultural process, {{it led to the}} invention of the <b>weeding</b> rake. The invention of the Chinese weed rake is derived from the invention of the Chinese harrow. In the Chinese agricultural text Qimin Yaoshu written by the Northern Wei Dynasty official Jia Sixie. Harrows were originally called iron-teeth rakes due to its shaping. According to it's shape, the Chinese harrow was divided into three sub-classifications: Strip rake, Y-shaped rake, and square rake. The harrows seen in the murals of the Wei and Jin Dynasties are strip rakes.|$|E

5|$|The Song {{government}} provided {{tax incentives}} to farmers who tilled lands {{along the edges}} of lakes, marshes, seas, and terraced mountain slopes. Farming was made possible in these difficult terrains due to improvements in damming techniques and using chain pumps to elevate water to higher irrigation planes. The 10th century introduction of early-ripening rice that could grow in varied climatic zones and topographic conditions allowed for a significantly large migration from the most productive lands that had been farmed for centuries into previously uninhabited areas in the surrounding hinterland of the Yangzi Valley and Southeast China, which experienced rapid development. The widespread cultivation of rice in China necessitated new trends of labor and agricultural techniques. An effective yield from rice paddies required careful transplanting of rows of rice seedlings, sufficient <b>weeding,</b> maintenance of water levels, and draining of fields for harvest. Planting and <b>weeding</b> often required a dirty day of work, since the farmers had to wade through the muddy water of the rice paddies on bare feet. For other crops, water buffalos were used as draft animals for ploughing and harrowing the fields, while properly aged and mixed compost and manure was constantly spread.|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} field {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} in winter wheat grown under organic conditions in Denmark on fields with different <b>weed</b> pressure. The treatments were sowing strategy (normal sowing time, late sowing and false seedbed), row distance (12 cm and 24 cm row distance) and <b>weed</b> control method (untreated, mechanical <b>weed</b> control (<b>weed</b> harrowing at 12 cm supplemented with row hoeing at 24 cm), and herbicide <b>weed</b> control). <b>Weed</b> biomass was largest at the normal sowing time and was reduced by mechanical or chemical <b>weed</b> control. Row distance alone did not generally influence <b>weed</b> biomass, but mechanical <b>weed</b> control reduced <b>weed</b> biomass at a row distance of 24 cm. Normal sowing time gave rise to about 10 % higher yield. The effect of <b>weed</b> control on yield was dependent on the <b>weed</b> pressure. At low <b>weed</b> pressure, mechanical <b>weed</b> control caused a yield decrease of 11 % compared to untreated or herbicide. At intermediate <b>weed</b> pressure there were no differences, whereas at high <b>weed</b> pressure, mechanical <b>weed</b> control caused a 15 % and no <b>weed</b> control a 25 % yield decrease compared to herbicide treatment.

40|$|Three field {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} in organically grown winter wheat in Denmark.

Row width alone had no influence on <b>weed</b> biomass, but in the experiment with high <b>weed</b> pressure, the more intensive mechanical <b>weed</b> control used at a row width of 24 cm reduced <b>weed</b> biomass.

5|$|Modern {{archaeologists have}} {{unearthed}} Han iron farming tools throughout China, from Inner Mongolia {{in the north}} to Yunnan in the south. The spade, shovel, pick, and plow were used for tillage, the hoe for <b>weeding,</b> the rake for loosening the soil, and the sickle for harvesting crops. Depending on their size, Han plows were driven by either one ox or two oxen. Oxen were also used to pull the three-legged iron seed drill (invented in Han China by the 2nd century BCE), which enabled farmers to plant seeds in precise rows instead of casting them out by hand. While artwork of the Wei (220–265 CE) and Jin (265–420 CE) periods show use of the harrow for breaking up chunks of soil after plowing, it perhaps first appeared in China during the Eastern Han (25–220 CE). Irrigation works for agriculture included the use of water wells, artificial ponds and embankments, dams, canals, and sluice gates.|$|E
5|$|However, {{contrary}} to {{the expectations of the}} Red Queen hypothesis, Hanley et al. found that the prevalence, abundance and mean intensity of mites was significantly higher in sexual geckos than in asexuals sharing the same habitat. Furthermore, Parker, after reviewing numerous genetic studies on plant disease resistance, failed to find a single example consistent with the concept that pathogens are the primary selective agent responsible for sexual reproduction in their host. At an even more fundamental level, Heng and Gorelick and Heng reviewed evidence that sex, rather than enhancing diversity, acts as a constraint on genetic diversity. They considered that sex acts as a coarse filter, <b>weeding</b> out major genetic changes, such as chromosomal rearrangements, but permitting minor variation, such as changes at the nucleotide or gene level (that are often neutral) to pass through the sexual sieve. The adaptive function of sex, today, remains a major unresolved issue in biology. The competing models to explain the adaptive function of sex were reviewed by Birdsell and Wills. A principal alternative view to the Red Queen hypothesis is that sex arose, and is maintained, as a process for repairing DNA damage, and that genetic variation is produced as a byproduct.|$|E

5|$|The Iroquois {{signed the}} Fort Stanwix Treaty of 1768, ceding the lands {{south of the}} Ohio to the British. European {{expansion}} into the upper Ohio valley increased. An estimated 4,000 to 5,000 families settled in western Pennsylvania between 1768 and 1770. Of these settlers, about a third were English, a third were Scotch-Irish, and the rest were Welsh, German and others. These groups tended to settle together in small farming communities, but often their households were not within hailing distance. The life of a settler family was one of relentless hard work: clearing the forest, stumping the fields, building cabins and barns, planting, <b>weeding,</b> and harvesting. In addition, almost everything was manufactured by hand, including furniture, tools, candles, buttons, and needles. Settlers {{had to deal with}} harsh winters, and with snakes, black bears, mountain lions, and timber wolves. Because of the fear of raids by Native Americans, the settlers often built their cabins near, or even on top of, springs, to ensure access to water. They also built blockhouses, where neighbors would rally during conflicts.|$|E

40|$|Whilst {{attention}} has been focussed on combating priority <b>weeds</b> we have neglected to obtain an overall picture of our <b>weed</b> flora.

25|$|The open {{canopy of}} cumin is another problem. Only a low {{proportion}} of the incoming light is absorbed. The leaf area index (LAI) of cumin is low (about 1.5). This might be a problem because weeds can compete with cumin for essential resources such as water and light and thereby lower yield. The slow growth and a short stature of cumin favours weed competition additionally. Two hoeing and <b>weeding</b> sessions (30 and 60 days after sowing) are needed for the control of weeds. During the first <b>weeding</b> session (30 days after sowing), thinning should be done, as well, to remove excess plants.
