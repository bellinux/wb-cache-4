5|$|At {{the outset}} of the 19th century most of the European {{settlements}} were related to the fur trade.

Historian Grace Lee Nute has documented over 100 fur trading posts of varying sizes in the Minnesota area before statehood. Most of these posts were eventually taken over by the American Fur Company. When several hundred settlers abandoned the Red River Colony in the 1820s, they entered the United States by <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Red River Valley, instead of moving to eastern Canada or returning to Europe, adding to the Minnesota region's population.|$|E
