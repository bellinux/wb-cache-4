5|$|Number two, why {{was this}} person, {{this one of the}} six around to commit this hideous crime? He was out because he had a 31-count {{indictment}} for the rape of a child, and he was out on $15,000 bail, instead of the requisite $450,000 bail that he never could have made and never <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> the street.|$|E
5|$|On 16 March 1983, Hadjoin finally {{completed}} {{the purchase of}} NBN, officially delisting the company. It had cost Parry A$6.76 per share to acquire 1,285,289 shares. Michael Wansey resigned from the board {{at the end of}} the year as a result. In 1984, plans for a second independent station in Newcastle had failed. During that time, NBN and ABC Newcastle were asked to leave the VHF band to accommodate FM radio. NBN <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> UHF channel 51, and ABC on UHF channel 48, however this did not eventuate. A proposal to launch a radiated subscription television service with community broadcasting during the daytime hours had also failed that year.|$|E
5|$|The {{gatehouse}} to {{the inner}} bailey has the coats of arms of Sir Henry Sidney and Queen Elizabeth I displayed over it, dating to 1581, and was originally a three-storeyed building with transomed windows and fireplaces, probably used as the lodgings for the judges. There were probably additional heraldic supporters displayed alongside the arms, since lost. A porter's lodge <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> the right hand side of the entrance to control access, with the rooms accessed by a spiral staircase in a protruding tower, with prominent triple chimneys, since lost. Alongside the gatehouse was originally a half-timbered building, possibly a laundry, approximately , which has since been lost.|$|E

25|$|History of Government {{occupied}} Finer's retirement years, 1982 to 1993. After a {{heart attack}} in 1987, he was only able to complete 34 out of the projected 36 chapters; the missing two chapters <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> the exportation of the modern state model outside the 'West', and on the variations on the theme of modern totalitarianism.|$|E

25|$|Morris {{remained}} {{in the hospital for}} 64 hours, unidentified. Officer Novak, however, was familiar with Morris due to her previous arrests for offenses related to prostitution. At no point did he identify her to hospital staff. Hospital records show staff efforts to identify Morris, whose fingerprints <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> file due to her previous arrests.|$|E
25|$|Wilberforce {{agreed to}} address the meeting on Saturday morning, and there was {{expectation}} that he would repeat his success at scourging evolutionary ideas as at the 1847 meeting. Huxley was initially reluctant to engage Wilberforce in a public debate about evolution, but, in a chance encounter, Robert Chambers persuaded him not to desert the cause. The Reverend Baden Powell <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> the platform, but he {{had died of a}} heart attack on 11 June.|$|E

25|$|Very few {{buildings}} in Reddish pre-date the 19th century. Canal Bridge Farm, close to Broadstone Mill, is dated to {{the mid to}} late 18th century (the name is later). Hartwell dates a small group of farm buildings and cottages at Shores Fold, near the junction of Nelstrop Road and Marbury Road, to the sixteenth and late seventeenth to early 18th century. These <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> the traditional Reddish – Heaton Norris border, but are now firmly inside Heaton Chapel.|$|E
25|$|Hanam Sunim {{was in the}} Diamond Mountains, at Jangan Temple by 1922, {{and later}} just outside Seoul at Bongeun Temple in 1926. He left then and, perhaps {{intending}} {{to return to the}} Diamond Mountains, wound up staying in the Odae Mountains, at Sangwon Temple. (This <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> his path to the Diamond Mountains.) As he was a very well known teacher, {{it seems likely that the}} monks at the nearby large temple, Woljeong Temple, had asked him to stay and teach.|$|E
25|$|It is very {{difficult}} to tell the exact date of the Winter solstice without modern equipment (although the Neolithic builders of the Newgrange monument seem to have managed it). The day itself is not visibly shorter than the several days leading up to and following it and although the actual Julian date of Winter solstice <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> the 15 or 14 December at the time when Christianity was introduced to Scandinavia, 13 December could well have lodged in peoples mind as being the shortest day.|$|E

25|$|Ciara was {{the support}} act for Britney Spears {{for the eight}} London concerts of The Circus Starring Britney Spears tour in support of Fantasy Ride. The shows took place in June 2009 at the city's prestigious The O2 (London). On August 14, 2009 Jive Records {{released}} a press release about the then upcoming second-leg of the Circus Tour which revealed that fellow label mate Jordin Sparks was replacing Ciara as the opening act along with newcomer Kristinia DeBarge. In September 2009, {{it was revealed that}} Ciara had been in the studio recording her next album with Tricky Stewart and The-Dream during time which she <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> tour.|$|E
25|$|Number 46 {{is unusual}} among the merchant's {{houses in the}} town centre in being two bays wide; most similar houses {{originally}} had only a single bay. The original house probably incorporated a shop on the ground floor. In the original plan, the two principal chambers <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> the first floor. One of the first-floor rooms, now used as a café, {{is a good example}} of a living chamber with decoration dating from the early 17th century. The walls have full-height oak panelling topped with an Ionic frieze, and the ceiling has decorative plasterwork in the intervening spaces between the beams, featuring strapwork and fretting.|$|E
25|$|This {{brought a}} third {{approach}} to entering the city. A ramp was raised again attacking Tower 14, but, {{as it was}} being built and the garrison fought to stop {{the progress of the}} ramp, another mine was started near the ramp. Its scope was not to cause a collapse of the wall — the buttress had been successful — but to pass under it and penetrate the city. This tunnel was built to allow the Persians four abreast to move through it. It eventually entered the city and pierced the inner embankment and, when the ramp was completed, Dura's end had come. As Persian troops charged up the ramp, their counterparts in the tunnel would have invaded the city with little opposition, as nearly all the defenders <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> the wall attempting to repel the attack from the ramp. The few city survivors would have been marched off to Ctesiphon and there sold as slaves. The city was eventually abandoned.|$|E

500|$|In early 1875, Congress {{passed a}} bill for the {{resumption}} of specie payments (that is, in gold and silver coin)—effective in 1879. Friedman stated that {{had it not been}} for the 1873 act, resumption <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> the effective basis of a silver standard, which he viewed as a good thing, allowing for more economic stability and [...] "almost surely would have avoided" [...] the downturn of the early 1890s known as the Panic of 1893.|$|E
500|$|An {{announcement}} in the January 1941 Writer's Digest listed the payment rate as half a cent per word. [...] This {{was a low}} rate, but it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> a par with many other magazines of the era, had Wollheim {{been able to achieve}} it. [...] In the event he was able to start paying small amounts to his authors after the first couple of issues; C.M. Kornbluth was paid for several of his later stories for the two magazines, though the rates were well below half a cent per word.|$|E
500|$|Gernsback {{believed}} that science fiction was educational, claiming, for example, that [...] "teachers encourage {{the reading of}} this fiction {{because they know that}} it gives the pupil a fundamental knowledge of science and aviation". [...] He intended Scientific Detective Monthly to be a detective magazine in which the stories had a scientific background; it would entertain, but also instruct. [...] The subgenre of scientific detective fiction was not new; it had first become popular in the U.S. between 1909 and 1919, and the appearance of Gernsback's magazine was part of a resurgence of popularity in the subgenre {{at the end of the}} 1920s. [...] The first issue was dated January 1930 (meaning it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> the newsstands in mid-December 1929). [...] Gernsback was editor-in-chief, and had final say on the choice of stories, but the editorial work was done by his deputy, Hector Grey.|$|E
