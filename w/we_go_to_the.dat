500|$|While light {{comedy and}} satire might have {{established}} Yiddish theater as a commercially successful medium, it was Goldfaden's higher aspirations for it that eventually earned him recognition as [...] "the Yiddish Shakespeare." [...] As a man broadly read in several languages, he was {{acutely aware that}} there was no Eastern European Jewish tradition of dramatic literature – that his audience was used to seeking just [...] "a good glass of Odobeşti and a song." [...] Years later, he would paraphrase the typical Yiddish theatergoer of the time as saying to him: [...] "We don't go to the theater to make our head swim with sad things. We have enough troubles at home... <b>We</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> theater to cheer ourselves up. We pay up a coin and hope to be distracted, we want to laugh from the heart." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Casting Crowns' lead vocalist Mark Hall, {{the concept}} for Come to the Well is the song [...] "The Well". Hall wrote the song {{based on the}} Biblical story of [...] "woman at the well {{and the fact that}} she was {{standing}} there talking to Jesus about water and Jesus was talking to her about water, but they weren't talking about the same water". Hall noted that, in his life, [...] "when I come to Jesus, I've already got my well figured out, I've already got what I think is going to sustain me, I just need him to sprinkle some magic Jesus dust on it and make it work. We have our wells figured and we want Jesus to fix our wells, but our wells are really holes in the ground". Hall argued that instead of using that approach, Christians should [...] "start with Jesus, then <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> world", and said that approach is what the album is about. In writing the album, Hall worked with outside songwriters Steven Curtis Chapman, Matthew West, and Tom Douglas on several tracks; he received writing credit on eleven out of the album's twelve tracks, the exception being [...] "Face Down", which was penned by Hector Cervantes and Marc Byrd.|$|E
500|$|In 2010, McAdams starred {{with her}} The Family Stone co-star Diane Keaton and Harrison Ford in the comedy Morning Glory. She played a {{television}} producer attempting {{to improve the}} poor ratings of a morning television program. The film was billed as a starring vehicle for McAdams. She initially felt she was unsuited to the role saying, [...] "I'm not funny. So I said, 'if you need me to be funny, {{you might want to}} look somewhere else'". The film's director Roger Michell had a number of dinners with McAdams and persuaded her to join the cast. Since working with Keaton, McAdams has described her as a mentor figure. Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times said McAdams [...] "gives the kind of performance <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> movies for" [...] while Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times felt she played [...] "as lovable a lead as anyone since Amy Adams in Junebug" [...] in an otherwise [...] "routine" [...] movie. Lou Lumenick of the New York Post was impressed by [...] "her gift for physical comedy", as was Varietys Andrew Barker. While Manohla Dargis of The New York Times felt she [...] "plays her role exceptionally well" [...] and is [...] "effortlessly likable", it called on Hollywood to give her parts [...] "worthy" [...] of her talent. [...] "Ms.McAdams has to rely on her dimples to get by. She does, but she could do better." [...] The film was a modest commercial success, grossing $58million worldwide from a production budget of $40million. McAdams later expressed her disappointment that the film failed to find a larger audience.|$|E

[...] Rooney concluded that the film [...] "will strike plangent chords for {{anyone who has ever}} struggled with identity, or to find connections in a lonely world." [...] In a uniformly positive review for Time Out New York, Joshua Rothkopf gave Moonlight five stars out of five, praised Barry Jenkins' direction and wrote that the film was [...] "without a doubt, the reason <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> movies: to understand, to come closer, to ache, hopefully with another." ...|$|E

Why didn't anyone notice that the script was bad? It stinks. I can't even watch it... Joel's on the other side going, what am I gonna do next? There's gotta be a next project, and they're sitting there and there's so many lessons I learned during that movie. It went $14 million over budget, I think and I kept saying to Joel, how are they allowing this? 'Cause they kept screaming at us, it's over the budget. I said, how, and they, you've gotta understand, they built all, Walter Hill didn't want to go to Chicago. The story took place in Chicago, so they built Chicago in LA.|$|E
