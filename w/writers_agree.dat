500|$|Lasker himself {{denied the}} claim that he {{deliberately}} played bad moves, and most modern <b>writers</b> <b>agree.</b> According to Grandmaster Andrew Soltis and International Master John L. Watson, the features that made his play mysterious to contemporaries now appear regularly in modern play: the g2–g4 [...] "Spike" [...] attack against the Dragon Sicilian; sacrifices to gain positional advantage; playing the [...] "practical" [...] move {{rather than trying to}} find the best move; counterattacking and complicating the game before a disadvantage became serious. Former World Champion Vladimir Kramnik said, [...] "He realized that different types of advantage could be interchangeable: tactical edge could be converted into strategic advantage and vice versa", which mystified contemporaries who were just becoming used to the theories of Steinitz as codified by Siegbert Tarrasch.|$|E
500|$|<b>Writers</b> <b>agree</b> {{that the}} episode was risky {{and could have}} failed spectacularly. Jonathan Bernstein in the British {{newspaper}} The Observer writes [...] "What could have been, at best, an eccentric diversion and, at worst, a shuddering embarrassment, succeeded on every level It provided a startling demonstration that creator Joss Whedon has a facility with lyrics and melody equal to the one he's demonstrated {{for the past six}} seasons with dialogue, character and plot twists. Rather than adopt the 'Hey, wouldn't it be wacky if we suddenly burst into song?' approach practised by Ally McBeal, the Buffy musical was entirely organic to the series' labyrinthine progression." [...] Johnston in the Sunday Herald Sun says, [...] "There is just so much to this marvellously cheeky episode that suggests the show can take any route it pleases and pull it off", while Debi Enker in The Age comments, [...] "Whedon demonstrates yet again what Buffy aficionados have known and appreciated for years: that his wit, playfulness and readiness to take a risk make his television efforts rise way above the pack." [...] Steve Murray in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution characterizes the episode as [...] "scary in a brand-new way", saying [...] "Once More, with Feeling" [...] is [...] "as impressive as Whedon's milestone episodes 'Hush' and 'The Body; the episode is [...] "often hilarious", according to Murray, and acts as [...] "(b)oth spoof and homage, [...] the hokiness of musicals while also capturing the guilty pleasure and surges of feeling the genre inspires".|$|E
2500|$|Not all <b>writers</b> <b>agree</b> {{that the}} Inspector-General's report {{supported}} the series' claims. Jeff Leen, {{assistant managing editor}} at The Washington Post for investigative reporting, wrote in a 2014 opinion page article that [...] "the report found no CIA relationship with the drug ring Webb had written about." [...] Leen, who covered the cocaine trade for the Miami Herald in the 1980s, rejects the claim that [...] "because the report uncovered an agency mind-set of indifference to drug-smuggling allegations", it vindicated Webb's reporting.|$|E

2500|$|In all, both <b>writers</b> <b>agree</b> {{that the}} Roman army was about 30,000 strong and the Seleucids about 70,000. However, modern sources {{state that the}} two armies might have been not that numerically {{different}} and supports that the Romans fielded about 50,000 men as did Antiochus. A popular anecdote regarding the array of the two armies is that Antiochus supposedly asked Hannibal whether his vast and well-armed formation would be enough for the Roman Republic, to which Hannibal tartly replied, [...] "quite enough for the Romans, however greedy they are." ...|$|E
2500|$|Herodotus, Isocrates, {{and other}} early <b>writers</b> <b>agree</b> that Pythagoras {{was the son}} of Mnesarchus and born on the Greek island of Samos, {{situated}} in the eastern Aegean. His father {{is said to have been}} a gem-engraver or a wealthy merchant, originally from Tyre. Pythagoras' name led him to be associated with Pythian Apollo; Aristippus of Cyrene explained his name by saying, [...] "He spoke ( [...] , agoreúo) the truth no less than did the Pythian ( [...] , Pythía)", and Iamblichus tells the story that the Pythia prophesied that his pregnant mother would give birth to a man supremely beautiful, wise, and beneficial to humankind. A late source gives his mother's name as Pythais. As to the date of his birth, Aristoxenus stated that Pythagoras left Samos in the reign of Polycrates, at the age of 40, which would give a date of birth around 570 BC.|$|E
2500|$|Táhirih {{was born}} Fātemeh Baraghāni in Qazvin, Iran (near Tehran), {{the oldest of}} four daughters of Muhammad Salih Baraghani, an Usuli mujtahid who was remembered for his interpretations of the Quran, his eulogies of the tragedies of Karbala, his zeal for the {{execution}} of punishments, and his active opposition to the consumption of wine. Her mother was from a Persian noble family, whose brother was the imam of the Shah Mosque of Qazvin. Her mother as well as Táhirih and all her sisters all studied in the Salehiyya, the Salehi madrasa her father had established in 1817, which included a women's section. Táhirih's uncle, Mohammad Taqi Baraghani, was also a mujtahid whose power and influence dominated the court of Fath-Ali Shah Qajar. The lack of contemporary evidence {{makes it impossible to}} determine her exact date of birth. Historian and contemporary Nabíl-i-A`zam cites that it was in 1817, whilst others claim an earlier date of 1814. Her grandson suggests a much later date of 1819, whilst some modern historians claim she was born about 1815. Shoghi Effendi and William Sears suggest the date of 1817, and other <b>writers</b> <b>agree.</b> This is supported by claims by a chronicler from the 19th century, who wrote that Táhirih was [...] "thirty-six years of age" [...] when she was killed, in accordance to the lunar calendar. After interviewing Táhirih's family and the families of contemporaries as well as reading documents about her life Martha Root believed that the most accurate date of birth was between 1817–1819. These findings are contested in several books and articles, but the evidence does not conclusively support either date.|$|E

Although, some critics said the film talks about yakuza who make a living hiding behind legitimate businesses while actually depicting the opposite, and the <b>writer</b> <b>agreed</b> with this critique.|$|R

Several of the <b>writers</b> <b>agreed</b> to write pamphlets and books that would promote the government's point of view; these were printed and published by such well-known publishers as Hodder & Stoughton, Methuen, Oxford University Press, John Murray, Macmillan and Thomas Nelson. The War Propaganda Bureau went on to publish over 1,160 pamphlets during the war.|$|R
40|$|J. Edgar Hoover, {{the head}} of the FBI, {{delivered}} a recent speech excoriating indecent literature and photos sold on newsstands and blamed them for higher rates of certain crimes.

6000|$|With this cacique resided Anacaona, {{widow of}} the late {{formidable}} Caonabo. She was sister to Behechio, and had taken refuge with her brother after the capture of her husband. She {{was one of the}} most beautiful females of the island; her name in the Indian language signified [...] "The Golden Flower." [...] She possessed a genius superior to the generality of her race, and was said to excel in composing those little legendary ballads, or areytos, which the natives chanted as they performed their national dances. All the Spanish <b>writers</b> <b>agree</b> in describing her as possessing a natural dignity and grace hardly to be credited in her ignorant and savage condition. Notwithstanding the ruin with which her husband had been overwhelmed by the hostility of the white men, she appears to have entertained no vindictive feeling towards them, knowing that he had provoked their vengeance by his own voluntary warfare. She regarded the Spaniards with admiration as almost superhuman beings, and her intelligent mind perceived the futility and impolicy of any attempt to resist their superiority in arts and arms. Having great influence over her brother Behechio, she counseled him to take warning by the fate of her husband, and to conciliate the friendship of the Spaniards; and it is supposed that a knowledge of the friendly sentiments and powerful influence of this princess in a great measure prompted the Adelantado to his present expedition.

60|$|The tall kinds {{grown in}} {{southern}} latitudes, and therefore exposed to great heat, require {{from six to}} seven months to ripen their seed; whereas the dwarf kinds, grown in northern and colder climates, require only from three to four months. (9/61. Metzger 'Getreidearten' s. 206.) Peter Kalm (9/62. 'Description of Maize' by P. Kalm 1752 in 'Swedish Acts' volume 4. I have consulted an old English MS. translation.), who particularly attended to this plant, says, that in the United States, in proceeding from south to north, the plants steadily diminish in bulk. Seeds brought from lat. 37 deg in Virginia, and sown in lat. 43-44 deg in New England, produce plants which will not ripen their seed, or ripen them with the utmost difficulty. So it is with seed carried from New England to lat. 45-47 deg in Canada. By taking great care at first, the southern kinds after some years' culture ripen their seed perfectly in their northern homes, so {{that this is an}} analogous case with that of the conversion of summer into winter wheat, and conversely. When tall and dwarf maize are planted together, the dwarf kinds are in full flower before the others have produced a single flower; and in Pennsylvania they ripen their seeds six weeks earlier than the tall maize. Metzger also mentions a European maize which ripens its seed four weeks earlier than another European kind. With these facts, so plainly showing inherited acclimatisation, we may readily believe Kalm, who states that in North America maize and some other plants have gradually been cultivated further and further northward. All <b>writers</b> <b>agree</b> that to keep the varieties of maize pure they must be planted separately so that they shall not cross.|$|E

The basic scholastic thesis rested on a fundamental belief that ultimately all forms of human activity must be judged by natural law. Usury was not acceptable because it was unjust. The Aristotelian argument was subsidiary and when it was rejected in the fifteenth century the scholastic position was not thereby undermined. Aquinas clearly states Aristotelian view that usury was theft and contrary to justice...|$|R
