The National Industrial Training Authority ­ NITA, which regulates non­academic skills or craft based training, was helped by this project to develop a PV solar curriculum at three levels (T 1 /T 2 /T 3)  which empowers from craft level technicians to engineers to deal with design, installation and maintenance of PV systems from solar lantern up to utility size level.  ERC, the Energy Regulatory Commission for Kenya has supported the initiative as technicians once trained can be accredited by and thus further strength the industry.  By June  2016, which is the end of the program, Kenya is to have  1800  accredited technical personnel near almost every major town in the country.  The paper describes the positive and negative aspects of this venture...|$|R
