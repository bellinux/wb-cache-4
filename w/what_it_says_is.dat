25|$|April 10, 2001: Pro-Moscow Grozny mayor Beslan Gantamirov {{announced}} that 17 bodies with gunshot wounds {{had been discovered}} {{in the basement of}} a bombed-out dormitory next to Oktyabrskoye city district police station, manned by the OMON special police troops from Siberia's Khanty-Mansiysk. The next day Gantamirov {{announced that}} his report was false and there were no bodies found. When explaining his change of heart, Gantamirov said that he learned of the discovery from the same source as the Russian envoy to the region Viktor Kazantsev, who also first confirmed the find, but later denied it. The OMON officer in charge of the station claimed the unit had nothing to do with the disappearance of local residents, adding that mass graves in Chechnya are commonplace. In March 2005, one of the unit's officers, Sergey Lapin, was convicted for the torture of a Chechen man who remains missing. In June 2006, Memorial produced <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>says</b> <b>is</b> documentary evidence of a secret torture center {{in the basement of a}} former school for deaf children in the Oktyabrsokye district of Grozny, which the Russian police allegedly used to hold, torture and murder hundreds of people. The activists said they collected the evidence just in time before the building housing the cellar was demolished in what they said was a crude attempt at a cover-up.|$|E

2500|$|On 24 August, Israel {{released}} part of <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>says</b> <b>is</b> a Hamas {{training manual}} on urban warfare, which states [...] "the process of hiding ammunition inside buildings {{is intended for}} ambushes in residential areas and to move the campaign from open areas into built up and closed areas" [...] and [...] "residents of the area {{should be used to}} bring in the equipment...take advantage of this to avoid [...] spy planes and attack drones." [...] The manual also explains how fighting from within civilian population makes IDF operations difficult and what the benefits of civilian deaths are. Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri dismissed the document as a [...] "forgery...aimed at justifying the mass killings of Palestinian civilians." ...|$|E
2500|$|The NFL is {{very active}} on {{stopping}} <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>says</b> <b>is</b> unauthorized commercial {{use of its}} trademarked terms [...] "NFL", [...] "Super Bowl", and [...] "Super Sunday". As a result, many events and promotions tied to the game, but not sanctioned by the NFL, are asked to refer to it with colloquialisms such as [...] "The Big Game", or other generic descriptions. [...] A radio spot for Planters nuts parodied this, by saying [...] "it would be super...to have a bowl...of Planters nuts while watching the big game!" [...] and comedian Stephen Colbert began referring to the game in 2014 as the [...] "Superb Owl". [...] In 2015, the NFL filed opposition with the USPTO Trademark Trial and Appeal Board to a trademark application submitted by an Arizona-based nonprofit for [...] "Superb Owl". [...] The NFL claims {{that the use of}} the phrase [...] "Super Bowl" [...] implies an NFL affiliation, and on this basis the league asserts broad rights to restrict how the game may be shown publicly; for example, the league says Super Bowl showings are prohibited in churches or at other events that [...] "promote a message", while venues that do not regularly show sporting events cannot show the Super Bowl on any television screen larger than 55inches. Some critics say the NFL is exaggerating its ownership rights by stating that [...] "any use is prohibited", as this contradicts the broad doctrine of fair use in the United States. Legislation was proposed by Utah Senator Orrin Hatch in 2008 [...] "to provide an exemption from exclusive rights in copyright for certain nonprofit organizations to display live football games", and [...] "for other purposes".|$|E
60|$|The {{violence}} {{of love is}} as much to be dreaded as that of hate. When it is durable it is serene and equable. Even its famous pains begin only with the ebb of love, for few are indeed lovers, though all would fain be. It is one proof of a man's fitness for Friendship that {{he is able to}} do without that which is cheap and passionate. A true Friendship is as wise as it is tender. The parties to it yield implicitly to the guidance of their love, and know no other law nor kindness. It is not extravagant and insane, but <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>says</b> <b>is</b> something established henceforth, and will bear to be stereotyped. It is a truer truth, it is better and fairer news, and no time will ever shame it, or prove it false. This is a plant which thrives best in a temperate zone, where summer and winter alternate with one another. The Friend is a necessarius, and meets his Friend on homely ground; not on carpets and cushions, but on the ground and on rocks they will sit, obeying the natural and primitive laws. They will meet without any outcry, and part without loud sorrow. Their relation implies such qualities as the warrior prizes; for it takes a valor to open the hearts of men as well as the gates of castles. It is not an idle sympathy and mutual consolation merely, but a heroic sympathy of aspiration and endeavor.|$|E

50|$|But what is poetry? There {{must be a}} {{poet who}} poetises in advance the essence of poetry. This will be the poet who ventures into the foreign, to let the fire come toward him. This is what occurs in Hölderlin's hymnal poetry. This river poetry never forgets the source, in its issuing and flowing from the source. <b>What</b> <b>it</b> <b>says</b> <b>is</b> the holy, which, beyond the gods, determines the gods. The poet stands between human beings and gods. The poet, and the river, are demigods.|$|E

5000|$|In February 2006, the World Council of Churches (WCC) commended {{the actions}} of the Presbyterian Church (USA) and urged other member churches {{worldwide}} to consider economic measures to end Israel’s occupation. Salpy Eskidjian Weiderud, former special consultant to the Geneva-based WCC General Secretary on Palestine and Israel, has noted that support for divestment by the WCC governing body came in the backdrop of a history of [...] "bold statements since 1948 on its Israel/Palestine policy", and was a way of ensuring [...] "that it is not in any way contributing financially to <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>says</b> <b>is</b> illegal or immoral." ...|$|E

5000|$|Classical: This {{notation}} simply {{retains the}} classical symbols for [...] "long" [...] and [...] "short" [...] syllables - the macron (or longum) and breve (or brevis) - and repurposes them for [...] "ictic" [...] and [...] "nonictic" [...] (or [...] "stressed" [...] and [...] "unstressed").

40|$|If, {{relative}} to a context, what a sentence <b>says</b> <b>is</b> necessarily true, then <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>says</b> must <b>be</b> so. If, {{relative to}} a context, what a sentence <b>says</b> <b>is</b> possible, then <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>says</b> could <b>be</b> true. Following natural philosophical usage, it would thus seem clear that in assessing an occurrence of a sentence for possibility or necessity, one is assessing what is said by that occurrence. In this paper, I argue that natural philosophical usage misleads here. In assessing an occurrence of a sentence for possibility or necessity, one is not assessing the modal status of the proposition expressed by that occurrence of the sentence...|$|R
50|$|Although {{these two}} {{statements}} are often confused with one another, they mean two different things: the first says something true about {{the vagaries of}} war; the second says something that is certainly false. The difference {{comes from the fact}} that the first statement—a statement of subjunctive possibility—says something about how things might have been under counterfactual conditions, whereas the second—a statement of epistemic possibility—says something about the relation between a particular outcome (a victory by Hitler) and our knowledge about the actual world (since, as it happens, we know perfectly well that that particular outcome did not actually obtain, we know that <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>says</b> <b>is</b> false).|$|E

Bulmer's History and Directory of East Yorkshire repeats <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>says</b> <b>is</b> a commonly held view that Drewton’s name might derive from 'Druids' town', and mentions the [...] "huge monolith" [...] of [...] "St Augustine's Stone" [...] {{that was supposed}} to be connected with Druid worship, and as the place where Saint Augustine preached to the Saxons, although stating that no record of the saint exists of him ever visiting Yorkshire. A Roman road which crossed the Humber at Brough passed through or near Drewton, the Roman occupation leaving many remains in the settlement.|$|E
50|$|Sweet Talker is a 1991 Australian film {{starring}} Bryan Brown. It {{was directed}} by Michael Jenkins who later described it as:A real general audience film, a fairly gentle film about some relationships, almost father-son relationships, single mum relationship with her son. It's not what I would call a film that has major clout to it. It's an entertainment film, but <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>says</b> <b>is</b> not bad.

The New York Times writes that, in 2004, the PCRM passed Robert Atkins's medical report to the Wall Street Journal. The report, obtained by Richard Fleming of the Fleming Heart and Health Institute, showed that Atkins himself had experienced heart attack, congestive heart failure, and weight problems. Atkins supporters countered that {{there was no reason to}} think that his heart problem (cardiomyopathy) was diet related, and that his weight at death was higher due to fluids pumped into him in the hospital.|$|R
5000|$|The {{allegations}} {{in the report}} describe practices found at many Chinese factories producing name-brand products for export.

The report shows copies of <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>says</b> <b>are</b> [...] "cheat sheets" [...] distributed to workers before auditors from Walmart or other customers arrive to make sure the factory passes inspections intended to ensure the supplier meets labor standards.
