5|$|By 1968 the Americans <b>were</b> <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> {{the scope}} and scale of the Cambodian {{logistical}} effort, but still remained reluctant to overtly violate Cambodia's neutrality since the U.S. still hoped to persuade Sihanouk to come on board against the communists. It was also conscious that any overt action might escalate the conflict into the international arena, possibly directly involving the Soviets and/or Chinese.|$|E
5|$|By the 15th century, writers, artists, {{and architects}} in Italy <b>were</b> <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the transformations that {{were taking place}} and were using phrases such as modi antichi (in the antique manner) or alle romana et alla antica (in {{the manner of the}} Romans and the ancients) to {{describe}} their work. In the 1330s Petrarch referred to pre-Christian times as antiqua (ancient) and to the Christian period as nova (new). From Petrarch's Italian perspective, this new period (which included his own time) was an age of national eclipse.|$|E

5|$|Officers in {{the field}} <b>were</b> <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the killing {{operations}} being conducted by the Einsatzgruppen. The Wehrmacht tried to justify their considerable involvement in the Einsatzgruppen massacres as being anti-partisan operations rather than racist attacks, but Hillgruber wrote {{that this was just}} an excuse. He states that those German generals who claimed that the Einsatzgruppen were a necessary anti-partisan response were lying, and maintained that the slaughter of about 2.2 million defenceless civilians for reasons of racist ideology cannot be justified.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{authorities}} {{had won a}} total military victory, they refrained from inflicting further draconian measures on the general population. The whole affair had clearly demonstrated that the cities depended on the support of their rural subjects. Putting down the insurrection had been achieved only with difficulties, and only {{with the help of}} troops from Zürich and Uri. Had the peasants succeeded to extend the Huttwil League to encompass the countryside of Zürich, the outcome of the conflict might have been different. The city authorities <b>were</b> <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> their essentially lucky escape, and their actions in the following years reflect it. While they took steps to disempower the rural population politically, they also fulfilled many of the peasants original fiscal demands, alleviating the economic pressure on them. Tax reforms were passed, to the point that for instance in the canton of Lucerne the overall taxation of the population decreased {{in the second half of}} the 17th century.|$|E
5|$|At 16:45, Tung {{was forced}} at gunpoint {{to talk to}} Diệm on the phone, telling the {{president}} that he had ordered his special forces to surrender. Minh then ordered Nhung to execute the Diệm loyalist. Tung had failed to convince the president to surrender and still commanded the loyalty of his men. The other generals had little sympathy for Tung, because the special forces' commander had disguised his men in regular army uniforms and framed the generals for the Xá Lợi Pagoda raids in August. The generals <b>were</b> <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the threat that Tung posed; they had discussed his elimination during their planning, having contemplated waging an offensive against his special forces. At nightfall, Nhung took Tung, and his brother and deputy, Major Lê Quang Triệu, with their hands tied, to a jeep and drove them {{to the edge of}} the air base. Forced to kneel over two freshly dug holes, the brothers were shot into their graves and buried.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{these small}} reforms, the 18th century ended with {{continuous}} and unrestrained {{attacks on the}} Court. Although complaints had been common {{since the time of}} Elizabeth I, the problems had become more unrestrained, {{at the same time as}} politically neutral law reformers first arose in any great number. Many critics were barristers of the common law, ignorant of the court's workings, but some, such as Sir Samuel Romilly, had trained as a Chancery advocate and <b>were</b> <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the Chancery's procedure. The success of the Code Napoleon and the writings of Jeremy Bentham are seen by academic Duncan Kerly to have had much to do with the criticism, and the growing wealth of the country and increasing international trade meant it was crucial that there be a functioning court system for matters of equity. While the upper classes had been struggling with the Court for centuries, and regarded it as a necessary evil, the growing middle and merchant classes were more demanding. With increasing court backlogs, it was clear to many law reformers and politicians that serious reform was needed.|$|E
25|$|After 17 July 1941, German {{authorities}} ceased {{using the}} forest glade in Palmiry {{as a place}} of mass executions. The reason probably was that they realized the Polish resistance and the civilian population <b>were</b> <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> what was happening in Palmiry.|$|E

25|$|Disbarred on 18 June 1861, James soon {{emigrated to}} the U.S. and was {{admitted}} to the bar in New York. There he was lauded as a leader of the English Bar, and he commented publicly on matters of public controversy, such as the Trent Affair. The British press suggested that the New York Bar <b>were</b> <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> his disbarment in England.|$|E
25|$|It {{is likely}} the Djab wurrung <b>were</b> <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> Europeans from their {{communications}} with coastal tribes. Their first explicit contact was with Major Thomas Mitchell exploring western Victoria in September 1836 when he surprised two {{women of the}} Utoul balug and their children near Mount Cole. Two years later, in 1838, a squatter invasion began with colonials and their sheep flocks settling in Djab wurrung country.|$|E
25|$|Although {{apparently}} not tipped off by Nosovitsky himself, Amsterdam police authorities <b>were</b> <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the Comintern's secret {{gathering in the}} city, and bugged the conference room with a dictaphone machine—a device discovered by delegate Michael Borodin {{on the second day}} of the proceedings. A raid by the authorities soon followed, during which many delegates were arrested before being ordered to leave the country or physically deported. Fraina and Nosovitsky were not detained, but rather made their way to the home of Dutch radical S. J. Rutgers in Amersfoort, where several other delegates had assembled. They remained there a week before returning home to America.|$|E

25|$|The British <b>were</b> <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> Gibraltar's {{strategic}} {{value and}} its vulnerability to {{attack from the}} Spanish mainland. On the outbreaks of war with Italy, most of the civilian population were evacuated to the United Kingdom {{and other parts of}} the Empire, except for those in vital jobs in the dockyard, or who were members of the Gibraltar Defence Force. The garrison was more than doubled and the anti-aircraft defences were greatly improved. Work started on a programme of improvements to Gibraltar's fortifications, including a new network of tunnels deep inside the Rock and a system of strong points and minefields covering the land border.|$|E
25|$|Among serpents and eels, {{snakes and}} lizards were also popular {{depictions of the}} god Atum. Serpents were seen as creatures of the earth that embody primeval, chthonic qualities, {{involved}} in the process of creation. Because many snakes inhabit marshes, they were closely linked to water and the primeval ocean of Nun. Egyptians <b>were</b> <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> both the snake's usefulness in controlling vermin and the dangers posed by its poison. Texts like the Brooklyn Papyrus include remedies and magical spells to cure the bitten. Snake deities were worshipped in hopes of preventing potential attacks by their earthly representatives. Commonly mummified in the Late, Ptolemaic, and Roman periods, lizards did not play much of a role in earlier culture.|$|E
25|$|From the 16th century onwards, Spanish soldiers, {{clergy and}} administrators were {{familiar}} with pre-Columbian Maya history and beliefs. The agents of the Catholic Church wrote detailed accounts of the Maya, in support of their efforts at evangelisation, and absorption of the Maya into the Spanish Empire. The writings of 16th-century Bishop Diego de Landa, who had infamously burned {{a large number of}} Maya books, contain many details of Maya culture, including their beliefs and religious practices, calendar, aspects of their hieroglyphic writing, and oral history. This was followed by various Spanish priests and colonial officials who left descriptions of ruins they visited in Yucatán and Central America. These early visitors <b>were</b> <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the association between the ruins and the Maya inhabitants of the region.|$|E

25|$|The {{owners and}} agents of Ariel and Taeping <b>were</b> <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the {{situation}} that the consignees were in. As soon as their ships had telegraphed from the Downs they became concerned that anything that might be considered a dead heat or a disputed result might lead the consignees to call the race void - there being no outright winner - and so not pay the premium for the first ship to dock. Therefore, they agreed that whichever ship docked first would claim and the other would not dispute the result in any way. In return, the two ships shared the premium between them, and also MacKinnon and Keay shared the £100 prize for the winning ship's captain. This is what happened, Taeping made the claim and shared the money equally with Ariel.|$|E
25|$|Apart from pilgrims, Amritsar {{had filled}} {{up over the}} {{preceding}} days with farmers, traders and merchants attending the annual Baisakhi horse and cattle fair. The city police closed the fair at 14:00 that afternoon, resulting in {{a large number of}} people drifting into the Jallianwala Bagh. It was estimated that about 20,000 to 25,000 people had gathered in the Bagh by the time of the meeting. Dyer sent an aeroplane to overfly the Bagh and estimate the size of the crowd. By this time, both Colonel Dyer and Deputy Commissioner Irving, the senior civil authority for Amritsar, <b>were</b> <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the meeting, but took no actions to prevent it or send police to peacefully disperse the crowds. This would later be a serious criticism levelled at both Dyer and Irving.|$|E
25|$|On 22 April 1918, the {{parliament}} of Transcaucasia voted for independence, declaring {{itself to be}} the Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic. It was to last for only a month. The new republic {{was made up of}} Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan, each with their different histories, cultures and aspirations. The Armenians <b>were</b> <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the Armenian Genocide in Turkey, so for them defence against the invading army was paramount, while the Muslim Azeris were sympathetic to the Turks. The Georgians felt that their interests could best be guaranteed by coming to a deal with the Germans rather than the Turks. On 26 May 1918, Georgia declared its independence and a new state was born, the Democratic Republic of Georgia, which would enjoy a brief period of freedom before the Bolsheviks invaded in 1921.|$|E
