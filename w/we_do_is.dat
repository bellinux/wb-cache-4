500|$|D'Esposito {{chose to}} {{differentiate}} the short from The First Avenger by avoiding the sepia tone used for that film by director Joe Johnston, instead using a cooler blue color. The production used two old lenses (for both night and day) {{that gave the}} short some [...] "better" [...] lens flares that D'Esposito felt gave the period setting a more modern feel. D'Esposito used a Steadicam or a camera dolly for the action sequences, to avoid a [...] "quick cutty or blurry or shaky" [...] feel. D'Esposito said that the crew was ultimately [...] "pushing our limit" [...] to get the planned shots on schedule, and he eventually realized that he [...] "wasn’t going to get every shot and I wasn’t going to get every punch and kick, so what <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> get the optimum".|$|E

500|$|In polymeters {{typically}} used by Meshuggah, the guitars might play in odd meters such as 5/16 or 17/16, while drums play in 4/4. One particular example of Haake's use of polymeter is 4/4 against 23/16 bimeter, {{in which he}} keeps the hi-hat and ride cymbal in 4/4 time but uses the snare and double bass drums in 23/16 time. On [...] "Rational Gaze" [...] (from Nothing), Haake plays simple 4/4 time, hitting the snare on each third beat, for 16 bars. At the same time, the guitars and bass are playing same quarter notes, albeit in a different time signature; eventually both sides meet up again at the 64th beat. Hagström notes about the polymeters, [...] "We've never really been into the odd time signatures we get accused of using. Everything <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> based around a 4/4 core. It's just that we arrange parts differently around that center {{to make it seem}} like something else is going on." ...|$|E
500|$|John D. F. Black's {{original}} pitch {{featured a}} story about capital punishment. His idea {{was based on a}} film treatment detailing the colony planet of Llarof where capital punishment is handed down as a sentence for any offense except against those who are immune from the law. In the treatment, a security officer is killed by a local law enforcement officer, who is then killed himself by his partner for unjustly killing the Enterprise crewman. The planet would have had a rebel faction who wanted to overthrow the laws, which Picard refused to back initially whilst citing the Prime Directive. A second draft featured a rebel leader executed for treason. Black explained the premise of a society that developed laws to prevent terrorism and chaos: [...] "Let's say that what <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> kill everybody who is a terrorist or suspected of being a terrorist. Now the people who have killed everybody, what do they do?" ...|$|E
500|$|Before {{showing the}} songs to the band, McKinnon and Skaff worked on them alone. When the pair {{had all of}} the song ideas, they worked on them as a full-band, with {{pre-production}} being undertaken in, as Skaff commented, [...] "a makeshift studio" [...] by Andrew Wade. Woodard commented that the band had [...] "been going in from 11am until 9pm and all <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> sit around and play." [...] Between demoing the songs, and their final forms on the album, Woodard said [...] "crazy things were happening – verses became choruses", with Chad Gilbert assisting the band with arrangements and writing. As the band thought they were getting better as songwriters, Woodard stated, [...] "it's getting more heavy and more pop." [...] One song that the band recorded was [...] "screwed up really bad and it didn't make the record", as Skaff comments, as the group recorded it at a fast pace and when McKinnon tried to [...] "sing it was like rap music. [...] And we were like 'that's not good'." [...] Asked if the band would {{use it as a}} possible B-side, Skaff said [...] "its possible [...] might use it for the next record or something like that." ...|$|E

500|$|Sawyer and Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim) {{were the}} least-liked {{characters}} by viewers {{during the first}} few episodes, because, according to Lindelof, [...] "they were just really obnoxious, bad guys". In later episodes, however, Sawyer and Jin changed to be more likable. Towards the beginning of [...] "Confidence Man", Sawyer is seen reading the novel Watership Down by Richard Adams (this is the book that caused Boone to think that Sawyer took Shannon's inhaler). The novel has numerous similarities to Lost, including [...] "letting go", and building a society. Furthermore, the protagonists of Watership Down are rabbits – a recurring motif in Lost. The episode ends with a montage of various characters performing different activities, featuring the song [...] "I Shall Not Walk Alone", written by Ben Harper and performed by The Blind Boys of Alabama. One lyric from the song is, [...] "I just reach for mother Mary"; Sawyer's mother's name is Mary, and, according to reviewer Therese Odell from the Houston Chronicle, the lyric may be alluding to this. Also, percussionist Ryan McKinnie of The Blind Boys of Alabama said of many members of the group's blindness, [...] "Our disability doesn’t have to be a handicap. It's not about what you can't do. It's about what you do. And what <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> sing good gospel music."

2500|$|The Frozen {{plot was}} first {{introduced}} {{at the end of}} the third season of the series. The show's executive producers explained that Disney had not asked them to do a crossover for the original film. Rather, they fell in love with Frozen when it premiered in November, saw it three more times, then developed a story idea in February and successfully pitched it to ABC Studios, the ABC network, and then Disney brand management. The producers shared that [...] "their writers' room was [...] "basically a 'Frozen' appreciation room" [...] and they would be [...] "completely honored" [...] if the original movie stars wanted to reprise their roles. Producer Adam Horowitz said that they were not going to [...] "redo" [...] the film: [...] "We're very aware of what we think makes this character from 'Frozen' so special and we want to honor that and make sure that what <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> in the universe of [...] everyone fell in love with this past year." ...|$|E
2500|$|Neuroethics also {{encompasses}} the ethical {{issues raised by}} neuroscience as it affects {{our understanding of the}} world and of ourselves in the world. [...] For example, if everything <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> physically caused by our brains, which are in turn a product of our genes and our life experiences, how can we be held responsible for our actions? [...] A crime in the United States requires a [...] "guilty act" [...] and a [...] "guilty mind". As neuropsychiatry evaluations have become more commonly used {{in the criminal justice system}} and neuroimaging technologies have given us a more direct way of viewing brain injuries, scholars have cautioned that this could lead to the inability to hold anyone criminally responsible for their actions. In this way, neuroimaging evidence could suggest that there is no free will and each action a person makes is simply the product of past actions and biological impulses that are out of our control. [...] The question of whether and how personal autonomy is compatible with neuroscience ethics and the responsibility of neuroscientists to society and the state is a central one for neuroethics. However, there is some controversy over whether autonomy entails the concept of 'free will' or is a 'moral-political' principle separate from metaphysical quandaries.|$|E
2500|$|About ninety animators {{worked on}} the film {{at one point or}} another; some {{worked on the}} project for as long as two years. [...] In terms of the film's {{animation}} style and settings, the film combines Eastern world culture (predominantly Japanese) with Western world culture (predominantly California). In May 2013, Disney released concept art and rendered footage of San Fransokyo from the film. San Fransokyo, the futuristic mashup of San Francisco and Tokyo, was described by Hall as [...] "an alternate version of San Francisco. Most of the technology is advanced, but much of it feels retro … Where Hiro lives, it feels like the Haight. I love the Painted ladies. We gave them a Japanese makeover; we put a cafe on the bottom of one. They live above a coffee shop." [...] According to production designer Paul Felix, [...] "The topography is exaggerated because what <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> caricature, I think the hills are 1½ times exaggerated. I don't think you could really walk up them … When you get to the downtown area, that's when you get the most Tokyo-fied, that pure, layered, dense kind of feeling of the commercial district there. When you get out of there, it becomes more San Francisco with the Japanese aesthetic. … (It's a bit like) Blade Runner, but contained to a few square blocks. You see the skyscrapers contrasted with the hills." ...|$|E
