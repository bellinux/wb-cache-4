5|$|Bedell {{sponsored}} several bold initiatives {{during his}} tenure in the United States House of Representatives.

He introduced legislation in 1977 {{that would require the}} barge industry to pay a fee for using the waterways which, Bedell pointed out, the Government paid millions of dollars to create and maintain. Bedell's original plan set the rate the barge industry paid as directly related to the amount the Government spent on <b>waterway</b> projects. This would have the additional effect of helping curb unnecessary <b>waterway</b> projects, and it was the same plan proposed by Pete Domenici in the Senate.|$|E
