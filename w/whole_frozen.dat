Next, they were able to see the wheel-dog, and then the whole string of running dogs and snow-stretches on either side.

40|$|ABSTRACT To {{investigate}} {{the origin of}} "fishy " odour detected from <b>frozen</b> <b>whole</b> egg products imported from some European companies, 21 strains of psychrophilic bacteria isolated from green rotten eggs were identified, and the behaviour of these bacteria in egg white and yolk were examined. Of 21 identified strains, 19 were presumably Pseudomonas, one was Flavobacterium, and another was Chromobacterium. In egg white these bacteria produced fluorescence, very little volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N) and trimethylamine nitrogen (TMA-N), and no hydrogen sulfide or putrid odour. In egg yolk these bacteria produced "fishy, " sulfuric, or ammoniac odour; hydrogen sulfide; TVB-N and TMA-N; and increased acidity of ether extract. It was assumed that these decomposed products, such as TMA and hydrogen sulfide, caused "fishy " odour in <b>frozen</b> <b>whole</b> egg. Inoculation of a strain to whole egg reproduced a <b>frozen</b> <b>whole</b> egg with "fishy " odour...|$|R

50|$|The Blue and Green Teams are in {{contention}} for the episode's best, and the experts quickly {{come to a}} unanimous decision. While the Blue Team certainly improved their teamwork {{a lot in the}} first challenge, they slipped back into their old ways in the third challenge, and the experts agree that ultimately, how the teams finish an episode is more important than how they start it. Therefore, it's fourth time lucky for the Green Team, whose impeccable work on the chicken coop sees them finally named the most improved couple of the week after three near-misses.

50|$|Two major {{fisheries}} {{exist for}} the species, one in Bass Strait, the other in Southern Queensland. The Bass Strait fishery is dominated by Danish seine vessels which take over 90% of the catch. This fishery has expanded markedly in recent years, with catches prior to 1970 less than 270 tonnes per year, having risen to over 1400 tonnes per year in 1993. The Queensland fishery is relatively new, developed after a population of eastern school whiting was found by trawlers. A number of smaller fisheries are due to bycatch of prawn trawlers along {{the range of the}} species. The Queensland and smaller fisheries form the basis of a lucrative export market whereby <b>whole</b> <b>frozen</b> fish are shipped to Thailand where they are processed and sent to Japan. This fishery was worth over 2.5 million Australian dollars in 1986.|$|E

If we carry the green fire-brand from star to star, and ignite around each a conflagration of vitality, we can trigger a Universal metamorphosis. Because of us, the barren dusts of a million billion worlds will coil up into the pulsing magic forms of animate matter. Because of us, landscapes of radiation blasted waste, will be miraculously transmuted: Slag will become soil, grass will sprout, flowers will bloom, and forests will spring up in once sterile places. Ice, hard as iron, will melt and trickle into pools where starfish, anemones, and seashells dwell — a <b>whole</b> <b>frozen</b> universe will thaw and transmogrify, from howling desolation to blossoming paradise.

40|$|Within {{generalized}} random energy models, {{we study}} {{the effects of}} energy discreteness and of entropy extensivity in the low temperature phase. At zero temperature, discreteness of the energy induces replica symmetry breaking, in contrast to the continuous case where the ground state is unique. However, when the ground state energy has an extensive entropy, the distribution of overlaps P(q) instead tends towards a single delta function in the large volume limit. Considering now the <b>whole</b> <b>frozen</b> phase, we find that P(q) varies continuously with temperature, and that state-to-state fluctuations of entropy wash out the differences between the discrete and continuous energy models.

40|$|A. Bourgeot—The Disjointed Tuareg Body, or Political Unimagination. This {{review of}} Les Touaregs: Portrait en fragments, a {{collection}} of articles by Helene Claudot-Hawad, formulates three major criticisms. It objects to the pos-tulate that a precolonial Tuareg nation existed—a postulate without any basis in a founding legend or myth, nor in any historical instance. Criticism is also directed at the methodology. The latter consists in making references to literary works, which are restricted to Hawad's poetry, and transposing the data extracted from them into politics. Odd oversights in the bibliography are also pointed out.

40|$|Two {{peptides}}, {{related to}} the locust myotropic peptides locustatachykinin I-IV, were isolated from the blowfly Calliphora vomitoria. <b>Whole,</b> <b>frozen</b> flies were used for extraction with acidified methanol. A cockroach hindgut muscle contraction bioassay was used for monitoring fractions during subsequent purification steps. A series of eight different high performance liquid chromatography column systems was required to obtain optically pure peptides. Two peptides were isolated and their sequences determined by Edman degradation and confirmed by mass spectrometry and chemical synthesis as APTAFYGVR-NH 2 and GLGNNAFVGVR-NH 2. They were named callitachykinin I and II. The peptides have sequence similarities to the locustatachykinins and vertebrate tachykinins. Both callitachykinins were recognized by an antiserum to locustatachykinin I in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) tests and callitachykinin II was additionally recognized by an antiserum to the vertebrate tachykinin kassinin, suggesting that immunolabeling of blowfly neurons with these antisera is due to neuronal callitachykinins...|$|E
