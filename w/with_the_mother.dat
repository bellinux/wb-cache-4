5|$|The Arp2/3 {{complex is}} {{composed}} of seven subunits: Arp2, Arp3, p41/ARPC1, p34/ARPC2, p21/ARPC3, p20/ARPC4, p16/ARPC5. The subunits Arp2 & Arp3 closely resemble monomeric actin allowing for a thermodynamically stable actin-like dimer. p41 has been proposed to interact with nucleation promoting factors (NPFs) because it is only known to have minor contacts <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> filament {{and there is a}} major loss of nucleation efficiency in the absence of p41. p34 and p20 dimerize to form a structural backbone that mediates the interaction <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> filament. p21 forms a bridge between Arp3 and the mother filament, increasing nucleation efficiency. p16 tethers Arp2 {{to the rest of the}} complex.|$|E
5|$|Following Freud's early speculations about infant {{experience}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>mother,</b> Otto Rank {{suggested a}} powerful role in personality development for birth trauma. Rank stressed the traumatic experience of birth as a {{separation from the}} mother, rather than birth as an uncomfortable physical event. Not long after Rank's introduction of this idea, Ian Suttie, a British physician whose early death limited his influence, suggested that the child's basic need is for mother-love, and his greatest anxiety is that such love will be lost.|$|E

5|$|Lunar Orbit Rendezvous (LOR): A single Saturn V could {{launch a}} {{spacecraft}} that {{was composed of}} a mother ship which would remain in orbit around the Moon, while a smaller, two-stage lander would carry two astronauts to the surface, return to dock <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> ship, and then be discarded.

5|$|Relatively {{inactive}} during daytime, the sparsely-spotted stingaree preys {{mainly on}} crustaceans, {{and to a}} much lesser extent on polychaete worms and other small benthic organisms. It is aplacental viviparous, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> provisioning her young with histotroph ("uterine milk"). Life history differs between the eastern and western subpopulations: eastern females bear litters of up to six pups with a twelve-month gestation period, while western females bear litters of {{only one or two}} pups with a ten-month gestation period. Also, western rays mature later and live longer than eastern rays. The venomous sting of the sparsely-spotted stingaree is potentially injurious to humans, and it has been reported to react aggressively if disturbed. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it under Least Concern, as there is little fishing activity over the majority of its range.|$|E
5|$|The Capobiancos {{argued that}} {{it takes more than}} mere biology to invoke the {{provisions}} of the ICWA, and under South Carolina law, a father must not only reside <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> for the six-month period preceding the birth of the child but also contribute to pregnancy-related expenses in order to have paternity rights. However, the Court determined that the ICWA does not defer to state law, and the trial court properly determined that the ICWA grants Indian fathers greater rights than state law.|$|E

5|$|The eggs hatch {{in about}} 7 days. The mother may assist the nymphs in hatching. When the nymphs hatch, they eat the egg casing and {{continue}} to live <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>mother.</b> The nymphs look similar to their parents, only smaller, and will nest under their mother and she will continue to protect them until their second molt. The nymphs feed on food regurgitated by the mother, and on their own molts. If the mother dies before the nymphs are ready to leave, the nymphs may eat her.|$|E
5|$|The four-horned {{antelope}} is diurnal (active mainly during the day). Though solitary by nature, {{four-horned antelope}}s may form loose {{groups of three}} to five –with one or more adults, sometimes accompanied by juveniles. This elusive antelope feeds on grasses, herbs, shrubs, foliage, flowers and fruits. It needs to drink water frequently; as such it stays in places near water sources. The breeding behaviour of the four-horned antelope has not been well studied. The age at which they reach sexual maturity and the season when mating occurs have not been understood well. Gestation lasts about eight months, following which one or two calves are born. They are kept concealed {{for the first few}} weeks of their birth. The young remain <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> for about a year.|$|E
5|$|The {{offspring}} may stay <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> for 13 to 20 months, {{associating with}} one another and feeding on kills together. After weaning, juveniles may form mixed-sex herds; young females may stay back with their mother, but there is hardly any interaction between the mother and daughters. The females in the mixed-sex herd gradually move out as they near sexual maturity. In the Serengeti, average age of independence of 70 observed litters was 17.1 months. Young females had their first litters at the age of about 2.4 years and subsequent litters about 20 months later. The lifespan of wild cheetahs is 14 to 15 years for females; their reproductive cycle typically ends by 12 years of age. Males generally live as long as 10 years.|$|E

5|$|According {{to those}} historians, the Spanish {{revolution}} against absolutism got {{mixed up with}} the Peninsular War. When FerdinandVII stood against his father CharlesIV, who {{was seen as an}} absolutist king, many Spaniards got the mistaken impression that he sympathized with the new enlightened ideas. Thus, the revolutions made in the Americas in the name of FerdinandVII (such as the May Revolution, the Chuquisaca Revolution, or the one in Chile) would have sought to replace absolutist power with power formulated under the new ideas. Even if Spain was at war with France, the ideals of the French Revolution (liberty, equality and fraternity) were still respected. Those revolutions pronounced themselves enemies of Napoleon, but did not face any active French military attack; they promoted instead fights between Spanish armies for keeping either the old or new order. This situation would change with the final defeat of Napoleon and the return of FerdinandVII to the throne, as he began the Absolutist Restoration and persecuted the supporters of the new libertarian ideas within Spain. For people in South America, to stay {{as a part of the}} Spanish Empire, but with a new relationship <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> country, was no longer a feasible option: the only remaining options at this point were to return to absolutism or to adopt independentism.|$|E
5|$|During the {{formative}} years of women's rights movements, {{the difference between}} the sexes was more or less taken for granted in that their roles, functions, aims and desires were different. As a result, they were not only to be reared differently but treated differently also. Over the course of time, this difference itself became a major reason for initiating women's movements. Early 19th century reformers argued that the difference between men and women was no reason for the subjection of women in society. However, later reformers were of the opinion that indeed it was this particular difference that subjugated women to their roles in society, for example, as mothers. Therefore, there was a need for the proper care of women's rights. With the formation of women's organisations and their own participation in campaigns, their roles as mothers was again stressed but in a different light: this time the argument was for women's rights to speech, education and emancipation. However, the image of women <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> as a symbol underwent changes over time – from an emphasis on family to the creation of an archetypal mother figure, evoking deep, often atavistic images.|$|E
5|$|Incubation {{has been}} {{recorded}} as averaging around 17 days. Like all passerines, the chicks are altricial; they are born blind and naked, and start to develop down on their heads on day two. Their eyes open around day six, and they begin developing their primary flight feathers around day nine or ten. For {{the first three days}} after hatching, the mother feeds the nestlings alone, with food brought to her by the father. The father feeds them directly from the fourth day onwards, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> brooding them afterwards until day seven. Flies, butterflies, moths, caterpillars and beetles predominate in the food fed to the young birds. Flame robins fed a higher proportion of flying insects to their young at Nimmitabel than did scarlet robins, which may have been due to their later start to breeding. Both parents participate in removing faecal sacs from the nest. Parents have been observed feeding young up to five weeks after leaving the nest.|$|E

5|$|Nursing lasts six {{to eight}} months in Californian populations and four to twelve months in Alaska, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> {{beginning}} to offer bits of prey at one to two months. The milk from a sea otter's two abdominal nipples is rich in fat and more similar to the milk of other marine mammals than {{to that of other}} mustelids. A pup, with guidance from its mother, practices swimming and diving for several weeks before it is able to reach the sea floor. Initially, the objects it retrieves are of little food value, such as brightly colored starfish and pebbles. Juveniles are typically independent at {{six to eight}} months, but a mother may be forced to abandon a pup if she cannot find enough food for it; at the other extreme, a pup may nurse until it is almost adult size. Pup mortality is high, particularly during an individual's first winter– by one estimate, only 25% of pups survive their first year. Pups born to experienced mothers have the highest survival rates.|$|E
5|$|In January 1821, Iturbide began peace {{negotiations}} with Guerrero, suggesting they unite {{to establish an}} independent New Spain. The simple terms that Iturbide proposed became {{the basis of the}} Plan of Iguala: the independence of New Spain (now to be called the Mexican Empire) with Ferdinand VII or another Bourbon as emperor; the retention of the Catholic Church as the official state religion and the protection of its existing privileges; and the equality of all New Spaniards, whether immigrants or native-born. The following month the other important guerrilla leader, Guadalupe Victoria, joined the alliance, and March 1 Iturbide was proclaimed head of a new Army of the Three Guarantees. The representative of the new Spanish government, Superior Political Chief Juan O'Donojú, who replaced the previous viceroys, arrived in Veracruz on July 1, 1821; but he found that royalists the entire country except for Veracruz, Mexico City and Acapulco. Since at the time that O'Donojú had left Spain, the Cortes was considering greatly expanding the autonomy of the overseas Spanish possessions, O'Donojú proposed to negotiate a treaty with Iturbide on the terms of the Plan of Iguala. The resulting Treaty of Córdoba, which was signed on August 24, kept all existing laws, including the 1812 Constitution, in force until a new constitution for Mexico could be written. O'Donojú became part of the provisional governing junta until his death on October 8. Both the Spanish Cortes and Ferdinand VII rejected the Treaty of Córdoba, and the final break <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> country came on May 19, 1822, when the Mexican Congress conferred the throne on Itrubide.|$|E
