5|$|Although the {{original}} plan for Regional Eurostar services to destinations north of London was abandoned, the significantly improved journey times available since the opening of High Speed 1 — which is physically connected to both the East Coast Main Line and the North London Line (for the West Coast Main Line) at St Pancras — and the recently increased maximum speeds on the West Coast Main Line may make potential Regional Eurostar services more commercially viable. This <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>even</b> more likely if proposals are adopted for a new high-speed line from London {{to the north of}} Britain.|$|E
5|$|However, Graham {{suggests}} that Lord Steyn's comments {{were limited to}} the use of the Parliament Acts and would not apply to legislation enacted using the ordinary legislative procedure. He also argues that it would be difficult to explain how courts would refuse to apply legislation unless human rights were involved, citing the example of the removal of judicial review: using fundamental common law principles to interpret legislation is very different from striking down legislation supported by the elected House of Commons, and <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>even</b> more contentious if the legislation only substantially modified judicial review procedure.|$|E
5|$|After Smith's death, Emma Smith {{quickly became}} alienated from Brigham Young {{and the church}} leadership. Young, whom Emma feared and despised, was {{suspicious}} of her desire to preserve the family's assets from inclusion {{with those of the}} church, and thought she <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>even</b> more troublesome because she openly opposed plural marriage. When most Latter Day Saints moved west, she stayed in Nauvoo, married a non-Mormon, Major Lewis C. Bidamon, and withdrew from religion until 1860, when she affiliated with the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, first headed by her son, Joseph Smith III. Emma never denied Smith's prophetic gift or repudiated her belief in the authenticity of the Book of Mormon.|$|E

5|$|In 1997, Maryland had a {{new head}} coach, Ron Vanderlinden, and he {{immediately}} saw that Navy was a natural rival for his team, but {{was unaware of the}} past history. Vanderlinden attempted to renew the game, {{but it was not until}} after his relief that the idea materialized. In 2001, Ralph Friedgen was hired as his successor and spearheaded efforts to reinvigorate the team's old rivalries, including that against Navy. Friedgen, who played for Maryland as an offensive guard, was at the 1964 game as a recruit. He had also coached for nine years as Georgia Tech's offensive coordinator, and he harbored nostalgic feelings for a rivalry with the passion of Clean, Old-Fashioned Hate. Friedgen stated that, in addition to the rivalries with West Virginia and Virginia, a renewed in-state series <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>even</b> more meaningful. In 2002, the two schools agreed to meet for the first Crab Bowl Classic in forty years, scheduled for 2005.|$|E
5|$|Nickel, {{formerly}} {{used in the}} cent, now had {{no place}} in American coinage. This was unsatisfactory to Wharton, who sought its return. Although Pollock {{made no mention of}} further nickel coinage in his 1864 annual report, Wharton in April of that year published a pamphlet proposing that all non-precious metal coinage be composed of 75% copper and 25% nickel. The copper-nickel cents had contained only 12% nickel, and even so had been difficult for the Mint to strike due to the hardness of the metal, the use of which damaged equipment and quickly broke dies. An alloy of 25% nickel <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>even</b> more difficult to coin. Wharton argued that the tough alloy would be difficult to counterfeit.|$|E
5|$|Shark, {{now working}} for Maxie, {{suggests}} to Danny they beat up Primont {{to help his}} father. One night when Mr. Fisher leaves the store dressed in Primont's hat and coat (lent due to a rainstorm), Shark recognizes him, but decides to mug him anyway, as that <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>even</b> better for Maxie's purposes. Danny's father is so badly injured that he needs expensive surgery; so Maxie pays for a specialist to perform it. Maxie later blackmails Danny into signing with him by threatening to tell his father about {{his involvement in the}} mugging, and then does it anyway. Outraged, Danny pummels Maxie for the betrayal and helps Ronnie escape him.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{before the}} Voyager 1 encounter, Stan Peale, Patrick Cassen, and R. T. Reynolds {{published}} {{a paper in}} the journal Science predicting a volcanically modified surface and a differentiated interior, with distinct rock types rather than a homogeneous blend. They based this prediction on models of Io's interior that took into account the massive amount of heat produced by the varying tidal pull of Jupiter on Io caused by its slightly eccentric orbit. Their calculations suggested {{that the amount of}} heat generated for an Io with a homogeneous interior would be three times greater than the amount of heat generated by radioactive isotope decay alone. This effect <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>even</b> greater with a differentiated Io.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of the first practical jet engines in the late-World War II period led to calls for new jet-powered versions of practically every aircraft then flying. Among these was {{the design of a}} replacement for the de Havilland Mosquito, at that time among the world's leading light bombers. The Mosquito had been designed with the express intent of lightening the aircraft in order to improve its speed as much as possible, a process that led to the removal of all defensive armament, improving performance {{to the point where it}} was unnecessary anyway. This high-speed approach was extremely successful, and a jet-powered version <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>even</b> more difficult to intercept.|$|E
5|$|The French {{started their}} {{evacuation}} with their pre-conceived notion that few {{would want to}} head south. As knowledge of the migration program spread through the communist-controlled north, thousands of predominantly northern Catholic asylum-seekers descended on the capital Hanoi and the port of Haiphong, {{both of which were}} still in French control. This led to anarchy and confusion as the emigrants fought over limited shelter, food, medicine and places on the ships and planes that were bound for the south. By early August, there were over 200,000evacuees waiting in Hanoi and Haiphong. Initially the ad hoc camps had insufficient sanitation and water quality control, leading to the possibility of outbreaks of disease. Some American representatives said that they were the worst conditions they had seen. The conditions continued to be poor and chaotic after the evacuation got into full swing, and did not improve significantly for a month. There was no organization infrastructure as far as registration or medical records and immunisation of the waiting evacuees. The communists thus sent their propaganda activists through the camps and said that the lack of organisation proved that life for prospective refugees <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>even</b> worse in the south, where they would be completely under the control of South Vietnam.|$|E

25|$|The best-known {{period in}} the history of Yorghan Tepe is by far one of the city of Nuzi in the 15th-14th centuries BC.

25|$|An {{assessment}} of permanent or temporary {{changes in a}} nuclear power plant is performed to evaluate if such changes are within risk criteria. For example, the probability of core (severe) damage may increase while replacing a component, but the probability <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>even</b> higher if that component were to fail because it wasn't replaced. Risk measures, such as core damage frequency and large early release frequency (LERF), determine the risk criteria for such changes.|$|E

25|$|In 1960, {{there were}} U.S. Congressional {{hearings}} regarding UFOs. Civilian UFO research group NICAP had publicly charged Blue Book with covering up UFO evidence, and had also acquired a few {{allies in the}} U.S. Congress. Blue Book was investigated by the Congress and the CIA, with critics—most notably the civilian UFO group NICAP asserting that Blue Book was lacking as a scientific study. In response, ATIC added personnel (increasing the total personnel to three military personnel, plus civilian secretaries) and increased Blue Book's budget. This seemed to mollify some of Blue Book's critics, that {{but it was only}} temporary. A few years later (see below), the criticism <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>even</b> louder.|$|E
25|$|Eventually, a tug {{ground unit}} {{properly}} equipped with snow chains {{was used to}} push the aircraft back from the gate. After leaving the gate, the aircraft waited in a taxi line with many other aircraft for 49 minutes before reaching the takeoff runway. The pilot apparently decided not {{to return to the}} gate for reapplication of deicing, fearing that the flight's departure <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>even</b> further delayed. More snow and ice accumulated on the wings during that period, and the crew was aware of that fact when they decided to make the takeoff. Heavy snow was falling during their takeoff roll at 3:59p.m. EST.|$|E

25|$|The antenna {{for such}} a system {{would have to be}} large only in the {{horizontal}} direction, and could be very thin vertically. This had advantages for installation on aircraft, but it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>even</b> more practical if the beam could be steered electronically, as opposed to mechanically. By delaying the signal slightly as it travelled down the long antenna, which could be arranged through a number of means, the phase angle would vary, causing the resulting signal to be focussed in a given direction. Since the antenna didn't have to move in order to scan, this led to the possibility of embedding the antenna in the leading edges of the aircraft wings, or similar solutions.|$|E
25|$|A {{few days}} before the Voyager 1 encounter, Stan Peale, Patrick Cassen, and R. T.
