He grew up in the Micklethwaite family’s ancestral home at Hopton Hall and was educated in Tadcaster and Wakefield. After moving to London where he attended King’s College, he was apprenticed, in 1862, to George Gilbert Scott, commencing independent practice in London in 1869.|$|E

The Hattersleys owned a number of worsted and woollen Mills and factories producing textile and weaving booms. There is still today Hattersley Narrow Fabrics Mill in Keighley.) ...|$|R
50|$|In 1838 {{he and his}} {{elder brother}} John started as <b>worsted</b> <b>spinners</b> and {{manufacturers}} in a new mill which their father built for them at Manningham. Lister's Mill (otherwise known as Manningham Mills), and its owner, were particularly {{well known in the}} district. The business eventually made Lister one of Bradford's most famous fathers, a multi-millionaire and the provider of thousands of jobs in the city. Lister's Mill changed the identity of the region, and its economy. Lister himself came to epitomise Victorian enterprise. However {{it has been suggested that}} his capitalist attitude made trade unions necessary.|$|R
50|$|The Lombes {{set up a}} new mill at Derby in 1719, on {{an island}} in the River Derwent, {{adjacent}} to a disused mill that had belonged to Thomas Cotchett and was built by George Sorocold. It eventually became a lucrative concern, known as Lombe's Mill. The patent expired in 1732, when Lombe petitioned Parliament for an extension, opposed by cotton and <b>worsted</b> <b>spinners.</b> The bill was thrown out, but subsequently an act rewarded Lombe with £14,000, one of the conditions being that he should deposit models of his machinery in a public institution. Models were placed in the Tower of London.|$|R
50|$|Other major {{employers}} were Samuel Lister and {{his brother}} who were <b>worsted</b> <b>spinners</b> and manufacturers at Lister's Mill (Manningham Mills). Lister epitomised Victorian enterprise {{but it has been}} suggested that his capitalist attitude made trade unions necessary.Unprecedented growth created problems with over 200 factory chimneys continually churning out black, sulphurous smoke, Bradford gained the reputation of being the most polluted town in England. There were frequent outbreaks of cholera and typhoid, and only 30% of children born to textile workers reached the age of fifteen. This extreme level of infant and youth mortality contributed to a life expectancy for Bradford residents of just over eighteen years, which was one of the lowest in the country.|$|R
60|$|The {{woman from}} whom Jeanne {{had taken the}} rooms, a Mrs. Caynsard, she had seen only once or twice. She was waited upon {{most of the time}} by an {{exceedingly}} diminutive maid servant, very shy at first, but very talkative afterwards, in broad Norfolk dialect, when she had grown a little accustomed to this very unusual lodger. Now and then Kate Caynsard, the only daughter of the house, appeared, but for the most time she was away, sailing a fishing boat or looking after the little farm. To Jeanne she represented a type wholly strange, but altogether interesting. She was little over twenty years of age, but she was strong and finely built. She had the black hair and dark brown eyes, which here and there amongst the villagers of the east coast remind one of the immigration of <b>worsted</b> <b>spinners</b> and silk weavers from Flanders and the North of France, many centuries ago. She was very handsome but exceedingly shy. When Jeanne, as she had done more than once, tried to talk to her, her abrupt replies gave little opening for conversation. One morning, however, when Jeanne, having returned from a long tramp across the sand dunes, was sitting in the little orchard {{at the back of the}} house, she saw her landlady's daughter come slowly out to her from the house. Jeanne put down her book.|$|R
5000|$|Having {{acted in}} 1910 as {{arbitrator}} {{in the industrial}} dispute between Messrs. Wm. Hollins & Co., Ltd., <b>worsted</b> <b>spinners</b> of Mansfield, and disaffected members of its workforce, he was appointed by the Board of Trade in 1911 to serve as Chairman of the Court of Referees for the Cambridge district, London and South Eastern Division, under the National Insurance Act 1911.In March 1916, {{at the height of}} the First World War, he joined the Appeal Tribunal for the County of Hertford, under the Second Schedule to the Military Service Act 1916.In 1919 the British Government had established a General Nursing Council under the Nurses Registration Act 1919. In 1921 the Privy Council was asked to nominate a lawyer of standing to preside over the council's judicial sub-committee. Priestley was recommended by Sir Almeric FitzRoy, Clerk of the Privy Council, as a man of 'agreeable manner and tactful.' Although the Minister of Health had no power under the Act to appoint a Chairman of the Council, he appointed Priestley to the position, 'since he was associated with neither the College nor the Central Committee and could therefore be regarded as impartial.' In July 1921 the Council announced it had framed, and the Minister of Health had approved, rules for the admission of nurses to an official register under the Act of 1919, and the register was opened. In the following months [...] "lay" [...] and [...] "professional" [...] members of the Council differed over the appointment of the first Registrar, and whether nurses' qualifications should be entered in the register. The controversy became so severe that by the end of the year the majority of members of the Council - including Priestley - had resigned.In February 1925 he was appointed by the Secretary of State for the Home Department to chair the Departmental Committee on Sexual Offences Against Young Persons, in succession to the late Sir Ryland Adkins. When the committee reported to the Minister in December 1925, Priestley and two other members submitted a memorandum to the effect that they were unable to agree to the committee's recommendation to raise the age of consent from 16 to 17 years.|$|R
5000|$|In 1830 Oastler, a {{committed}} abolitionist, was visiting John Wood of Horton Hall near Bradford, {{one of the}} largest <b>worsted</b> <b>spinners</b> in the country. Whilst an existing (virtually un-enforceable) Factory Act specified a minimum age and maximum hours of work for children in cotton mills, it did not apply to other textile industries (such as: silk, flax, woollen and worsted [...] ). Wood, unhappy at the hours and conditions of work for children in Yorkshire worsted mills and his inability to persuade his competitors to ameliorate them, explained his concerns to Oastler and got him to promise to [...] "remove from our factory system the cruelties which are practised in our mills". Oastler wrote the next day a letter to the Leeds Mercury the leading West Riding newspaper contrasting speeches made at Yorkshire anti-slavery meetings with the treatment of children in Yorkshire factories - [...] "Yorkshire Slavery":Thousands of our fellow-creatures and fellow-subjects, both male and female, the miserable inhabitants of a Yorkshire town, (Yorkshire now represented in Parliament by the giant of anti-slavery principles) are this very moment existing in a state of slavery, more horrid than are the victims of that hellish system 'colonial slavery' These innocent creatures drawl out, unpitied, their short but miserable existence, in a place famed for its profession of religious zeal, whose inhabitants are ever foremost in professing 'temperance' and 'reformation' and are striving to outrun their neighbours in missionary exertions, and would fain send the Bible to the farthest corner of the globe aye, in the very place where the anti-slavery fever rages most furiously, her apparent charity is not more admired on earth, than her real cruelty is abhorred in Heaven. The very streets which receive the droppings of an 'Anti-Slavery Society' are every morning wet by the tears of innocent victims at the accursed shrine of avarice, who are compelled (not by the cart-whip of the negro slave-driver) but by the dread of the equally appalling thong or strap of the over-looker, to hasten, half -dressed, but not half-fed, to those magazines of British infantile slavery the worsted mills in the town and neighbourhood of Bradford!!! After a fortnight's delay, the Mercury published the letter. This triggered correspondence; it became clear that other readers of the Mercury were also perturbed at conditions for children not only in the worsted industry, but also in other unregulated textile trades carried out in the West Riding. Oastler took up the cause of factory regulation. However, the millowners organised to resist any attempt to regulate their mills.|$|R
5000|$|Many {{commercial}} premises {{were built in}} Broomfields {{in the second half}} of the 19th century. In 1863 Ladywell Foundry was expanded and became Ladywell Mills. At the same time Globe Mills were built on the opposite side of Hall Lane close to Hall Lane Mills. All these mills were built for renting out on a room and power basis. Ladywell usually had three main tenants, each renting one of the three mill buildings. The 1912 Street directory lists the tenants as J&C Crabtree, Ltd commission wool comber, Ladywell Slubbing & Combing Co, and J.W Firth Ltd commission wool combers. Firths are still (2014) in occupation. At the same date Globe Mills had as tenants J & W Lister & Sons, <b>worsted</b> yarn <b>spinners</b> and the Bradford Steel Pin Manufacturing Co. Ltd. Later in the 20th century Globe mills was occupied by metal manufacturing and engineering companies - but no textile companies. The same directory states that Hall Lane Mills was solely occupied by W.H Wilkinson and Son, cabinet makers, who had occupied the premises since about 1880. Another [...] "Prospect Mill" [...] (in Usher Street) had also abandoned textiles and was occupied by Jas. Burroughs and Sons, wood-turners. Textile industries seemed not to flourish in Broom Fields so well as engineering and the furniture and timber trades. One of the biggest industrial sites in Broomfields in 1912 was the Prospect Saw Mills (founded 1811) - next to Prospect Foundry.|$|R
