5|$|BAE Systems makes large {{sections}} of the Typhoon Eurofighter at its sub-assembly plant in Salmesbury and assembles the aircraft for the RAF at its Warton plant, near Preston. It is also a principal subcontractor on the F35 Joint Strike Fighter – the world's largest single defence project – for which it designs and manufactures a range of components including the aft fuselage, vertical and horizontal tail and <b>wing</b> <b>tips</b> and fuel system. It also manufactures the Hawk, the world's most successful jet training aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The adult sarus crane is {{very large}} with grey wings and body; a bare red head {{and part of}} the upper neck; a greyish crown; and a long greenish-grey pointed bill. In flight, the long neck is held straight, unlike that of an heron, which folds it back, and the black <b>wing</b> <b>tips</b> can be seen; the crane's long pink legs trail behind them. This bird has a grey ear covert patch, an orange-red iris and a greenish-grey bill. Juveniles have a {{yellowish}} base to the bill and the brown-grey head is fully feathered.|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} study of a generic high-speed civil transport was conducted in LaRC's 8 -Foot Transonic Pressure Tunnel. The data base was obtained {{for the purpose of}} assessing the accuracy of various levels of computational analysis. Two models differing only in <b>wing</b> <b>tip</b> geometry were tested with and without flow-through nacelles. The baseline model has a curved or crescent <b>wing</b> <b>tip</b> shape while the second model has a more conventional straight <b>wing</b> <b>tip</b> shape. The study was conducted at Mach numbers from 0. 30 - 1. 19. Force data were obtained on both the straight and curved <b>wing</b> <b>tip</b> models. Only the curved <b>wing</b> <b>tip</b> model was instrumented for measuring pressures. Longitudinal and lateral-directional aerodynamic data are presented without analysis in tabulated form. Pressure coefficients for the curved <b>wing</b> <b>tip</b> model are also presented in tabulated form...|$|R

50|$|Wingtip stall is {{unlikely}} to occur symmetrically, especially if the aircraft is maneuvering. As an aircraft turns, the <b>wing</b> <b>tip</b> {{on the inside of}} the turn is moving more slowly and is most likely to stall. As an aircraft rolls, the descending <b>wing</b> <b>tip</b> is at higher angle of attack and is most likely to stall. When one <b>wing</b> <b>tip</b> stalls it leads to wing drop, a rapid rolling motion. Also, roll control may be reduced if the airflow over the ailerons is disrupted by the stall, reducing their effectiveness.|$|R
5|$|The brolga is a common, gregarious wetland {{bird species}} of {{tropical}} and south-eastern Australia and New Guinea. It is a tall, upright bird {{with a small}} head, long beak, slender neck and long legs. The plumage is mainly grey, with black <b>wing</b> <b>tips,</b> and it has an orange-red band of colour on its head. It {{is well known for}} its intricate mating dance. The nest is built of sticks on an island in marshland and usually two eggs are laid. Incubation takes 32 days and the newly hatched young are precocial. The adult diet is mostly plant matter, but invertebrates and small vertebrates are also eaten.|$|E
5|$|The female Bohemian waxwing is {{very similar}} to the male, but has a {{narrower}} yellow terminal band to the tail, a less defined lower edge to the black throat and slightly less distinctive wing markings. Juveniles are duller than adults, with whiter underparts, only a few red <b>wing</b> <b>tips,</b> no black on the throat and a smaller black face mask. Compared to the nominate subspecies, eastern B. g. centralasiae is paler, greyer and has little reddish-brown behind the bill. The American subspecies B. g. pallidiceps has more colouring on the cheeks and forehead than the nominate form and is otherwise generally duller in appearance.|$|E
5|$|The American white ibis (Eudocimus albus) is {{a species}} of bird in the ibis family, Threskiornithidae. It is found from Virginia via the Gulf Coast of the United States south {{through most of the}} coastal New World tropics. This {{particular}} ibis is a medium-sized bird with an overall white plumage, bright red-orange down-curved bill and long legs, and black <b>wing</b> <b>tips</b> that are usually only visible in flight. Males are larger and have longer bills than females. The breeding range runs along the Gulf and Atlantic Coast, and the coasts of Mexico and Central America. Outside the breeding period, the range extends further inland in North America and also includes the Caribbean. It is also found along the northwestern South American coastline in Colombia and Venezuela. Populations in central Venezuela overlap and interbreed with the scarlet ibis. The two have been classified by some authorities as a single species.|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} the lateralizer device is to sense the {{difference}} in <b>wing</b> <b>tip</b> static pressures (differential pressures being created by <b>wing</b> <b>tip</b> venturis) produced when any deviation from straight to level flight occurs. In a steady state turn the low slow <b>wing</b> <b>tip</b> experiences less venturi suction than the high fast <b>wing</b> <b>tip.</b> This signal activates the appropriate servos connected to the ailerons to produce a wing leveling restoring moment. If the wing is subjected to rolling velocities due to changes of the local angle of attack at the <b>tip,</b> the downgoing <b>wing</b> <b>tip</b> operates at a higher angle than the upgoing one. If {{with an increase in}} the angle of attack the signal is such that it increases the venturi pressure, then the servos are activated to produce the most negative signal to an upgoing aileron which results in a wing leveling restoring moment. In other words, any deviation from straight and level flight in either roll or yaw is exploited and the difference signal from the differential pressures activates the servo to effect or produce the necessary corrective action to null the signal...|$|R
5|$|The skins of the fuselage, {{wings and}} {{tailplane}} were secured by rivets, and in critical {{areas such as}} the wing forward of the main spar where an uninterrupted airflow was required, with flush rivets; the fuselage used standard dome-headed riveting. From February 1943 flush riveting was used on the fuselage, affecting all Spitfire variants. In some areas, such as {{at the rear of the}} wing, and the lower tailplane skins, the top was riveted and the bottom fixed by brass screws which tapped into strips of spruce bolted to the lower ribs. The removable <b>wing</b> <b>tips</b> were made up of duralumin-skinned spruce formers. At first the ailerons, elevators and rudder were fabric-covered. When combat experience showed that fabric-covered ailerons were impossible to use at high speeds, a light alloy replaced the fabric, enhancing control throughout the speed range.|$|E
5|$|Though the plumage of {{the spotted}} green pigeon {{resembles that of}} the Nicobar pigeon in some respects, it is also {{similar to that of}} species in the {{imperial}} pigeon genus Ducula. The metallic-green colouration is commonly found among them, and similar hackles {{can be seen in the}} goliath imperial pigeon (D. goliath). The Polynesian imperial pigeon (D. aurorae) has similar soft feathers, and immature individuals of this species and the Pacific imperial pigeon (D. pacifica) have plumage different from that of juvenile and adult birds until they moult. Therefore, vanGrouw found it possible that the dull, brownish-black underparts of the surviving spotted green pigeon specimen represents the plumage of an immature bird, as the adults of similar birds have stronger and more glossy iridescence. He suggested that the brighter bird with paler underparts and whiter <b>wing</b> <b>tips</b> seen in Latham's illustration may represent the adult plumage.|$|E
5|$|Within its range, {{the western}} jackdaw is unmistakable; its short bill and grey nape are {{distinguishing}} features. From a distance, {{it can be}} confused with a rook (Corvus frugilegus), or when in flight, with a pigeon or chough. Flying western jackdaws are distinguishable from other corvids by their smaller size, faster and deeper wingbeats and proportionately narrower and less fingered <b>wing</b> <b>tips.</b> They also have shorter, thicker necks, much shorter bills and frequently fly in tighter flocks. They can be distinguished from choughs by their uniformly grey underwings and their black beaks and legs. The western jackdaw is very similar in morphology, behaviour, and calls to the Daurian jackdaw, with which its range overlaps in western Asia. Adults are readily distinguished, since the Daurian has a pied plumage, but immature birds are much more similar, both species having dark plumage and dark eyes. The Daurian tends to be darker, with a less contrasting nape than the Western.|$|E

40|$|Observers {{have always}} been fascinated by soaring birds. An {{interesting}} feature of these birds is the existence of few feathers extending from the <b>tip</b> of the <b>wing.</b> In this paper, small lifting surfaces were fitted {{to the tip of}} a NACA 0012 wing in a fashion similar to that of <b>wing</b> <b>tip</b> feathers. Experimental measurements of induced drag, longitudinal static stability and trailing vortex structure were obtained. The tests showed that adding <b>wing</b> <b>tip</b> surfaces (sails) decreased the induced drag factor and increased the longitudinal static stability. Results identified two discrete appositely rotated tip vortices and showed the ability of <b>wing</b> <b>tip</b> surfaces to break them down and to diffuse them...|$|R
