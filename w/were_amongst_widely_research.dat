On the basis of these results the clinicians placed each child into one of four proscribed diagnostic categories: Exhibiting visual-perceptual difficulties; emotional difficulties; both difficulties; neither difficulties. The results indicated significant inter-rater differences between the raters’ diagnoses, and scoring of the Bender Gestalt. With regards to intra-rater differences, is. individual differences from session one to two, significant differences were evident in the scoring of the Bender Gestalt.

40|$|Abstract. The Nearest Neighbor (NN) classification/regression tech-niques, besides their simplicity, <b>are</b> <b>amongst</b> {{the most}} <b>widely</b> applied and well studied {{techniques}} for pattern recognition in machine learn-ing. A drawback, however, {{is the assumption}} {{of the availability of}} a suitable metric to measure distances to the k nearest neighbors. It has been shown that k-NN classifiers with a suitable distance metric can perform better than other, more sophisticated, alternatives such as Sup-port Vector Machines and Gaussian Process classifiers. For this reason, much recent research in k-NN methods has focused on metric learn-ing, i. e. finding an optimized metric. In this paper we propose a simple gradient-based algorithm for metric learning. We discuss in detail the motivations behind metric learning, i. e. error minimization and margin maximization. Our formulation differs from the prevalent techniques in metric learning, where the goal is to maximize the classifier’s margin. Instead our proposed technique (MEGM) finds an optimal metric by di-rectly minimizing the mean square error. Our technique not only results in greatly improved k-NN performance, but also performs better than competing metric learning techniques. Promising results are reported on major UCIML databases. ...|$|R

MultiLocus Sequence Analysis and Typing (MLSA/MLST) methods <b>are</b> <b>amongst</b> the most <b>widely</b> used genotyping methods for assessing the global epidemiology of various plant pathogenic bacteria including X. fastidiosa. MLSA is used to assign strains {{to one of the}} known X. fastidiosa subspecies and MLST for typing strains and make inference of their origin. Both methods are traditionally used on isolated strains. Nonetheless, because it is timeconsuming and sometimes difficult to obtain isolates of X. fastidiosa from plant samples as a consequence of an intrinsically poor isolation rate and the fastidious nature of the pathogen, being able to type X. fastidiosa in plant samples is a priority for epidemiological purposes. Application of the initial protocol on DNA extracted from plant material proved limited efficiency. The aim of our study was to test the impact of various modifications of the protocol in order to improve the efficiencies of DNA extraction and target amplification rate. We also tested the interest of reduced typing schemes. The direct identification of X. fastidiosa infecting plant material face however some limitations that will be discussed...|$|R

Prior to peeling, the round green-wood of most species needs to be heated to temperatures ranging from 30 to 90 degrees Celcius in order to soften the wood and ease cutting. Forming part of a broader program to develop a system that could be embedded on a peeling lathe, the foal of this PhD thesis was to investigate the technological feasibility of using infrared (IR) to heat green logs and so circumvent many of the economic and environmental disadvantages arising from soaking. The main output of this study was to demonstrate that the penetration depth of IR into green woods is limited to several tens of micrometers and that heat transfers into green wood up to the cutting plane (locating several millimeters underneath the surface) is by conduction, which is slow due to the insulating properties of wood. Heating green wood with IR radiation is therefore unsuitable for the high peeling rates currently in use in the industry...|$|R

In this work, we prune the number of PCA-SIFT features and introduce a modified Redundant Bit Vector (RBV) index. This is the first application of the RBV index that shows near-perfect effectiveness. Using the best parameters of our RBV approach, we observe an average recall and precision of 91 % and 98 %, respectively, with query response time of under 10 seconds on a collection of 20, 000 images. Compared to the baseline (the LSH index), the query response times and index size of the RBV index is 12 times faster and 126 times smaller, respectively.

Epidemiologic {{studies suggest that}} exposure to 2, 4 -D and MCPA {{may be associated with}} increased risk non-Hodgkins lymphoma (NHL), Hodgkin’s disease (HD), leukemia, and soft-tissue sarcoma (STS). Toxicological studies in rodents show no evidence of carcinogenicity, and regulatory agencies worldwide consider chlorophenoxies as not likely to be carcinogenic or unclassifiable as to carcinogenicity. This systematic review assembles the available data to evaluate epidemiologic, toxicological, pharmacokinetic, exposure, and biomonitoring studies with respect to key cellular events noted in disease etiology and how those relate to hypothesized modes of action for these constituents to determine the plausibility of an association between exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of 2, 4 -D and MCPA and lymphohematopoietic cancers. The combined evidence does not support a genotoxic mode of action. Although plausible hypotheses for other carcinogenic modes of action exist, a comparison of biomonitoring data to oral equivalent doses calculated from bioassay data shows that environmental exposures are not sufficient to support a causal relationship. Genetic polymorphisms exist that are known to increase the risk of developing NHL. The potential interaction between these polymorphisms and exposures to chlorophenoxy compounds, particularly in occupational settings, is largely unknown...|$|R

Two agents of concern are canine parvovirus (CPV) and canine distemper virus (CDV), which may infect and cause disease in large carnivore species such as African wild dogs and African lions, respectively. The impact of domestic dogs and their diseases on wildlife conservation is increasing in Zimbabwe, necessitating thorough assessment and implementation of control measures. In this study, domestic dogs in north-western Zimbabwe were evaluated for antibodies to CDV, CPV, and canine adenovirus (CAV). These dogs were communal and had no vaccination history. Two hundred and twenty-five blood samples were collected and tested using a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for antibodies to CPV, CDV, and CAV. Of these dogs, 75 (34 %) had detectable antibodies to CDV, whilst 191 (84 %) had antibodies to CPV. Antibodies to canine adenovirus were present in 28 (13 %) dogs. Canine parvovirus had high prevalence in all six geographic areas tested. These results indicate that CPV <b>is</b> circulating <b>widely</b> <b>amongst</b> domestic dogs in the region.

Pesticide exposure is a major risk factor for PD, and paraquat (PQ), pyridaben (PY) and maneb (MN) <b>are</b> <b>amongst</b> the most <b>widely</b> used pesticides. We studied mRNA expression using transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) in the ventral midbrain (VMB) and striatum (STR) of PQ, PY and paraquat+maneb (MNPQ) treated mice, followed by pathway analysis. We found concordance of signaling pathways between the three pesticide models in both the VMB and STR as well as concordance in these two brain areas. The concordant signaling pathways with relevance to PD pathogenesis were e. g. axonal guidance signaling, Wnt/b-catenin signaling, as well as pathways not previously linked to PD, e. g. basal cell carcinoma, human embryonic stem cell pluripotency and role of macrophages, fibroblasts and endothelial cells in rheumatoid arthritis. Human PD pathways previously identified by expression analysis, concordant with VMB pathways identified in our study were axonal guidance signaling, Wnt/b-catenin signaling, IL- 6 signaling, ephrin receptor signaling, TGF-b signaling, PPAR signaling and G-protein coupled receptor signaling. Human PD pathways concordant with the STR pathways in our study were Wnt/b-catenin signaling, axonal guidance signaling and G-protein coupled receptor signaling.
