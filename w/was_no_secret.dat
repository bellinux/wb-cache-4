5|$|In 1629, George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore, {{arrived in}} Virginia, having {{traveled}} south from Avalon, his failed colony on Newfoundland. Calvert was not welcomed by the Virginians, both because his Catholicism offended them as Protestants, {{and because it}} <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>secret</b> that Calvert desired a charter {{for a portion of}} the land that the Virginians considered their own. After a brief stay, Calvert returned to England to press for just such a charter, and Claiborne, in his capacity as Secretary of State of Virginia colony, was sent to England to argue the Virginians' case. This happened to be to Claiborne's private advantage, as he was also trying to complete the arrangements for the trading post on Kent Island.|$|E
5|$|After {{a decade}} of {{constant}} warfare, France and Britain signed the Treaty of Amiens in March 1802, bringing the Revolutionary Wars to an end. Amiens called for the withdrawal of British troops from recently conquered colonial territories {{as well as for}} assurances to curtail the expansionary goals of the French Republic. With Europe at peace and the economy recovering, Napoleon's popularity soared to its highest levels under the Consulate, both domestically and abroad. In a new plebiscite during the spring of 1802, the French public came out in huge numbers to approve a constitution that made the Consulate permanent, essentially elevating Napoleon to dictator for life. Whereas the plebiscite two years earlier had brought out 1.5 million people to the polls, the new referendum enticed 3.6 million to go and vote (72% of all eligible voters). There <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>secret</b> ballot in 1802 and few people wanted to openly defy the regime; the constitution gained approval with over 99% of the vote. His broad powers were spelled out in the new constitution: Article 1. The French people name, and the Senate proclaims Napoleon-Bonaparte First Consul for Life. After 1802, he was generally referred to as Napoleon rather than Bonaparte.|$|E
5|$|The meeting {{lasted from}} morning to midnight, {{including}} {{the reading of}} the proclamation, the debate and the vote. There <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>secret</b> ballot; votes were heard one at a time and recorded in the minutes. The main themes of the debate were the legitimacy of the government and the authority of the Viceroy. The principle of retroversion of the sovereignty to the people stated that, {{in the absence of the}} legitimate monarch, power returned to the people; they were entitled to form a new government. This principle was commonplace in Spanish scholasticism and rationalist philosophy, but had never been applied in case law. Its validity divided the assembly into two main groups: one group rejected it and argued that the situation should remain unchanged; this group supported Cisneros as Viceroy. The other group supported change, and considered that they should establish a junta, like the ones established in Spain to replace the Viceroy. There was also a third position, taking the middle ground. The promoters of change did not recognize the authority of the Council of Regency, and argued that the colonies in America were not consulted in its formation. The debate tangentially discussed the rivalry between criollos and peninsulars; the Viceroy supporters felt that the will of peninsulars should prevail over that of criollos.|$|E

5|$|The {{power balance}} {{began to change}} after King Rajendra came of age and his grandmother, Tripurasundari, died on 26 March 1832 due to cholera. Bhimsen lost his main support and the court became a stage for a power struggle, which even though started off {{as an attempt to}} assert the King's {{authority}} from the Mukhtiyar, spread to various aristocratic clans and their attempt to secure total authority. It <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>secret</b> that Bhimsen was able to maintain his supremacy due to the large standing army under his and his family's command; and in the subsequent years, different factions would attempt to increase their influence based on the strength of the number of battalions under their grip. After Tripurasundari's death, the royal seal by which government orders were approved naturally went {{into the hands of the}} senior queen Samrajya Laxmi, who knew all too well of its powers and wanted to emulate the queens of the past by establishing her own regency. Sensing Samrajya Laxmi's ambition, Ranbir Singh started to stroke her dislike of Bhimsen in the hopes of becoming the mukhtiyar himself. Getting a whiff of this matter, Bhimsen strongly reprimanded Ranbir Singh which caused him to resign from his General's position and live in retirement in his house at Sipamandan. However, Bhimsen later managed to placate his brother, by giving him the title of Chota (Little) General, and send him to Palpa as its governor. Since he could find nobody that he could trust to keep watch over the royal palace, Bhimsen from then on started to live in an ordinary rented house located near the palace premise.|$|E
25|$|The {{brutality}} was {{aggravated by}} alcohol, particularly at night. Frequent and extreme drunkenness, {{which was a}} common problem within the SA, aggravated the situation at Kemna, as numerous former inmates later testified. Typically, off-duty guards would go out drinking at nearby taverns and hours later, return inebriated, ready {{to take part in}} interrogations. Sometimes, they would begin their own so-called interrogations, unsupervised. Local taverns, normally closed at the hours the guards were ready to drink, were faced with violence and threats if they did not re-open. Veller's drinking was so out of control that he was incapable of showing up for work on a regular basis—and it <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>secret.</b>|$|E
25|$|In tributes, both Taoiseach Brian Cowen {{and former}} UK prime {{minister}} Tony Blair stressed Cardinal Daly's {{contribution to the}} peace process in Northern Ireland. The deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland, the Sinn Féin MLA Martin McGuinness, said it <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>secret</b> that Republicans and Cardinal Daly had never enjoyed a close relationship during The Troubles, but that relations had warmed since then. Warm tributes also came from the Primate of the Church of Ireland, the Most Rev. Alan Harper, the President of the Methodist Church in Ireland, the Rev. Donald P. Ker, and the Moderator of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, the Rt. Rev. Dr. Stafford Carson.|$|E

25|$|The match {{ended with}} Honinbo Shusai winning by two points. However, his victory was {{surrounded}} by controversies. At {{the time of the}} match, the tradition dictated that the player holding white had the right to adjourn the game at any time, and there was no sealing of moves before adjournment. This meant that Shusai, being the nominally stronger player and thus holding white, could adjourn the match whenever {{it was his turn to}} move and continue deliberating at home before the match resumed. Shusai shamelessly abused this privilege by adjourning the game more than a dozen times, all at his turn to play. For instance, on the eighth day of the match, Shusai played first, and Go Seigen replied within two minutes, Shusai then thought for three and a half hours, only to adjourn the game. It <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>secret</b> that Shusai, during adjournments, discussed and studied the game with his students to come up with the best moves. Go Seigen was therefore put into an especially adverse position for having to take on the entire Honinbo establishment.|$|E
25|$|In Germany, matters {{had come}} to a head. The Pope had refused to confirm Louis's {{favourite}} candidate for the bishopric of Cologne, William Egon of Fürstenberg. Enraged, the French king decided to execute a lightning campaign into Germany before the emperor could shift his troops to the West. Louis also hoped to keep his Turkish ally in the war this way. For the immediate future James had to hold his own, something Louis expected him to be quite capable of, especially if the Dutch were intimidated. On 9 September (Gregorian calendar) the French envoy Jean Antoine de Mesmes, the Comte d'Avaux, handed two letters from the French king, who had known of the invasion plans since May, to the States General of the Netherlands. In the first they were warned not to attack James. In the second they were advised not to interfere with the French policy in Germany. James hurriedly distanced himself from the first message, trying to convince the States General that there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>secret</b> Anglo-French alliance against them. This however, had precisely the opposite effect: many members became extremely suspicious. The second message proved that the main French effort was directed to the east, not the north, so there was no immediate danger of a French invasion for the Republic itself.|$|E
500|$|If there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>secret,</b> {{then there}} was no reason for security. The scientists, in particular, chafed under the wartime controls, which were not lifted with the {{surrender}} of Japan. On September 1, 1945, Samuel K. Allison used the occasion of the announcement of the founding of the Institute for Nuclear Studies to call for freedom to research and develop atomic energy. He told the press that if controls were not removed, nuclear scientists might turn to the study of the color of butterfly wings. Enrico Fermi warned that [...] "unless research is free and outside of control, the United States will lose its superiority in scientific pursuit".|$|E

500|$|At the Giants Pérez {{hoped for}} a fresh start; rumors had swirled in Kansas City about {{problems}} in the clubhouse, and it <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>secret</b> that the trade had been deeply unpopular in both Denver and Kansas City. Commented Pérez: [...] "I feel happy here. I like the National League. I was happy in Colorado and I am happy here." [...] Pérez hit [...]256 {{over the course of}} the 2003 season; an improvement on his previous season but a far cry from the Colorado days. Pérez returned for the 2004 season, but the situation in San Francisco had become uncomfortable. Although signed as a starter at second base, he quickly became backup to José Cruz, Jr., while he lost out at shortstop to Deivi Cruz. His batting average slumped to [...]232. He had a staunch defender in manager Felipe Alou, but in the end he was the [...] "odd man out" [...] and the Giants released him on August 14, 2004.

500|$|In 1848, Banks was victorious {{in another}} {{run for the}} state legislature, {{successfully}} organizing elements in Waltham whose votes were not easily controlled by the Whig-controlled Boston Manufacturing Company. [...] Company leaders could effectively compel their workers to vote for Whig candidates because there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>secret</b> ballot. [...] He was at first moderate {{in opposition to the}} expansion of slavery, but recognizing the potency of the burgeoning abolitionist movement, he became more strongly attached to that cause as a vehicle for political advancement. [...] This brought Banks, along with fellow Democrats Rantoul and George S. Boutwell to form a coalition with the Free Soil Party that successfully gained control of the legislature and governor's chair. The deals negotiated after the coalition win in the 1850 election put Boutwell in the governor's chair and made Banks the Speaker of the Massachusetts House of Representatives. Although Banks did not like the radical Free Soiler Charles Sumner (either personally or for his strongly abolitionist politics), he supported the coalition agreement that resulted in Sumner's election to the United States Senate, despite opposition from conservative Democrats. His role as house speaker and his effectiveness in conducting business raised his status significantly, as did his publicity work for the state Board of Education.|$|E

But the main channel into Charleston was guarded by five Union ships, and Nashville's draft was too deep for any side channels. [...] A night escape was considered, but tides and strong night winds prevented this. An overland route through Mexico and departure from Matamoros was also considered, but the delay of several months was unacceptable.|$|E

2500|$|That <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>secret.</b> [...] There are {{no known}} {{instances}} in which Lincoln tried to suppress knowledge or discussion of such arrangements, and in some conversations, raised the subject himself. Tripp discusses three men at length and possible sustained relationships: Joshua Speed, William Greene, and Charles Derickson. However, in 19th-century America, it was not necessarily uncommon for men to bunk-up with other men, briefly, if no other arrangement were available. [...] For example, when other lawyers and judges travelled [...] "the circuit" [...] with Lincoln, the lawyers often slept [...] "two in a bed and eight in a room". William H. Herndon recalled for example, [...] "I have slept with 20 men in the same room". But a private and sustained relationship with a single individual in one bed is something else.|$|E

2500|$|In 1733, Franklin {{began to}} publish the noted Poor Richard's Almanack (with content both {{original}} and borrowed) under the pseudonym Richard Saunders, on which much of his popular reputation is based. Franklin frequently wrote under pseudonyms. Although it <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>secret</b> that Franklin was the author, his Richard Saunders character repeatedly denied it. [...] "Poor Richard's Proverbs", adages from this almanac, such as [...] "A penny saved is twopence dear" [...] (often misquoted as [...] "A penny saved is a penny earned") and [...] "Fish and visitors stink in three days", remain common quotations in the modern world. Wisdom in folk society meant the ability to provide an apt adage for any occasion, and Franklin's readers became well prepared. He sold about ten thousand copies per year—it became an institution. In 1741 Franklin began publishing The General Magazine and Historical Chronicle for all the British Plantations in America, the first such monthly magazine of this type published in America.|$|E
