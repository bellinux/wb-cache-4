5|$|Dactyl shares many {{characteristics}} with Ida. Their albedos {{and reflection}} spectra are very similar. The small differences {{indicate that the}} space weathering process is less active on Dactyl. Its small size <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> formation of significant amounts of regolith impossible. This contrasts with Ida, which is covered by a deep layer of regolith.|$|E
5|$|Electoral (Polish: elekcyjne) sejmiks elected higher {{voivodeship}} officials, {{judges in}} particular. They were convened irregularly, as such offices were usually held for life.

5|$|On 29 March 2016, it was {{announced}} that Milton Keynes Lightning (playing in the second-tier English Premier League) would be joining the Elite League for the 2017–18 season.

50|$|Eusebius relates that he {{was from}} Coroneia in Boeotia, {{and if he was}} right, this <b>would</b> <b>make</b> him <b>the</b> first winner from outside the Peloponnese.

5|$|Russell T Davies {{scrapped}} a {{glass bowl}} storyline for the Partners in Crime slot in Series 4, as he decided this <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> story too contained, and that wasn't the tone he wanted. In his book The Writer's Tale, Davies remarked {{that he was}} glad he abandoned the idea, because The Simpsons Movie had a similar premise.|$|E
5|$|The Irenaean theodicy is a {{response}} to the evidential problem of evil which raises the problem that, if an omnipotent and omnibenevolent (all-powerful and perfectly loving) God exists, there should be no evil in the world. Evidence of evil in the world <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> existence of God improbable. The theodicy attempts to demonstrate that the existence of God remains probable, despite the occurrence of evil.|$|E
5|$|The {{numbering}} scheme for the point releases up to Debian 4.0 was {{to include the}} letter r (for revision) after the main version number and then {{the number of the}} point release; for example, the latest point release of version 4.0 is 4.0r9. This scheme was chosen because a new dotted version <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> old one look obsolete and vendors would have trouble selling their CDs.|$|E

5|$|A second auction was held, with {{bids for}} natural gas given equal weight to those wishing to {{transfer}} crude oil, although any natural gas bidder would be obliged to maintain the oil pumping stations {{for use in a}} national emergency. Ten bids were received and on February 8, 1947, the Texas East Transmission Corporation (TETCO) was declared successful. Its bid of $143,127,000 <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> disposal the largest sale of war-surplus property to the private sector following World War II.|$|E
5|$|Although {{many species}} have been named, modern paleontologists {{recognize}} only one, T. bataar, as valid. Some experts see this species as an Asian representative of the North American genus Tyrannosaurus; this <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> genus Tarbosaurus redundant. Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus, if not synonymous, {{are considered to be}} at least closely related genera. Alioramus, also from Mongolia, is thought by some authorities to be the closest relative of Tarbosaurus.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} {{concept in}} Hippocratic medicine {{was that of}} a crisis, a point in the progression of disease at which either the illness would begin to triumph and the patient would succumb to death, or the opposite would occur and natural processes <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> patient recover. After a crisis, a relapse might follow, and then another deciding crisis. According to this doctrine, crises tend to occur on critical days, which were supposed to be a fixed time after the contraction of a disease. If a crisis occurred on a day far from a critical day, a relapse might be expected. Galen believed that this idea originated with Hippocrates, though it is possible that it predated him.|$|E

5|$|Another {{option was}} to {{relocate}} to Anaheim, in the Greater Los Angeles area. The Houston Rockets had looked into relocation to Anaheim the previous season, with Arrowhead Pond of Anaheim (now Honda Center) as the home venue. However, the NHL team then known as the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim had an agreement that any other tenant at the Pond should share revenues with their then-owner, The Walt Disney Company, although Disney stated {{they were willing to}} negotiate the terms. There are also two existing clubs in Los Angeles, the Lakers and the Clippers, which <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> media market small and limit revenue.|$|E
5|$|By 1988, Searchlight {{reported}} that the party's membership had declined to around 1,000. Tyndall responded by trying to raise finances, calling for greater sales of their newspaper and increasing the price of membership by 50%. He also promised that he <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> BNP the largest extreme-right group in the UK {{and that he would}} establish a professional headquarters for the party. This was achieved in 1989, as a party headquarters was opened in Welling, Southeast London, an area chosen because it was a recipient of significant 'white flight' from inner London. That year also witnessed the BNP become the most prominent force on the British far-right as the NF collapsed amid internal arguments and schisms.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the Green Line past Anacostia Station was {{complicated}} by {{the discovery of a}} potential toxic waste site {{in the path of the}} subway. In June 1991, WMATA discovered that the District of Columbia had dumped 426,000 tons of possibly hazardous incinerator bottom ash in an unused exposed culvert along the subway's potential path near St. Elizabeth's Hospital between 1977 and 1989. The city continued to dump the ash at the site for four years after it learned that WMATA planned to use the site for the Green Line. Experts were concerned that the ash dump contained pockets of methane gas and soluble acid, which <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> site unusable by Metrorail.|$|E

5|$|Dinoflagellates may use {{bioluminescence}} for defence against predators. They shine {{when they}} detect a predator, possibly making the predator itself more vulnerable by attracting {{the attention of}} predators from higher trophic levels. Grazing copepods release any phytoplankton cells that flash, unharmed; if they were eaten they <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> copepods glow, attracting predators, so the phytoplankton's bioluminescence is defensive. The problem of shining stomach contents is solved (and the explanation corroborated) in predatory deep-sea fishes: their stomachs have a black lining {{able to keep the}} light from any bioluminescent fish prey which they have swallowed from attracting larger predators.|$|E
5|$|Disadvantages {{resulting}} from the nature of orbital mechanics <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> arrangement of the orbits of the swarm extremely complex. The simplest such arrangement is the Dyson ring, in which all such structures share the same orbit. More-complex patterns with more rings would intercept more of the star's output, but would result in some constructs eclipsing others periodically when their orbits overlap. Another potential {{problem is that the}} increasing loss of orbital stability when adding more elements increases the probability of orbital perturbations.|$|E
5|$|In 1954, the Oslo City Council {{decided to}} build a four-line metro to the new suburbs {{to the east of}} the city center. The plans would lead to the system opening in 1966, after the {{conversion}} of the Østensjø and the Lambertseter Line of the Oslo Tramway to metro standard, and supplemented with the new Furuset and Grorud Line. The system would feature higher and longer platforms, allowing step-free access to six-car trains, automatic train protection and third rail power supply. This <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> metro incompatible with the existing tramways.|$|E

5|$|In its heyday, el-Mansuriya was {{the capital}} of a state that {{encompassed}} most of North Africa from Morocco to Libya, as well as Sicily, although it had to guard against attack from the Byzantine Empire and from King Otto I of Germany, both active in southern Italy. In 957, an embassy from Byzantium brought the tribute from the Emperor for his occupation of Calabria from there, with gifts of gold and silver vessels adorned with jewels, silks, brocades and other valuables. In Italy, El-Muizz planned the invasion of Egypt, whose conquest <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> Fatimids rivals in power to the Abbasids in Baghdad.|$|E
5|$|Khalid {{argued that}} he had conquered the city by force. Abu Ubaidah {{maintained}} the city had capitulated, through the peace agreement between him and Thomas. The corps commanders discussed the situation, and reportedly told Khalid that the peace agreement must be honored. Their rationale had logic: if other Byzantines in Syria heard that the Muslims had given a guarantee of safety to a surrendered city and then had slaughtered those whose safety had been guaranteed, no other city would ever surrender to the Muslims. This <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> task of conquering Syria immeasurably more difficult. Khalid, though not happy, agreed to honor the peace agreement.|$|E
5|$|Later {{installations}} {{faced the}} opposite dilemma of having too few stations: one Streetsblog writer {{noted that the}} stations in the expansions were spaced further apart than the stations in the original service area, which <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> Citi Bike stations in these areas harder to access. In September 2017, a reporter for Time Out magazine wrote that the system did not serve the outer boroughs adequately, with stations only located in wealthier areas of Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens that were closer to the Manhattan central business districts.|$|E
