A <b>word-for-word</b> <b>translation</b> of the title is: The Abridged Collection of Authentic Hadith with Connected Chains regarding Matters Pertaining to the Prophet, His practices and His Times. Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani mentioned the same title, replacing the word umur (English: matters) with hadith.|$|E
25|$|Makdisi states Islamic {{law also}} {{parallels}} the legal scholastic {{system in the}} West, which {{gave rise to the}} modern university system. He writes that the triple status of faqih ("master of law"), mufti ("professor of legal opinions") and mudarris ("teacher"), conferred by the classical Islamic legal degree, had its equivalents in the medieval Latin terms magister, professor and doctor, respectively, although they all came to be used synonymously in both East and West. Makdisi suggests that the medieval European doctorate, licentia docendi was modeled on the Islamic degree ijazat al-tadris wa-l-ifta’, of which it is a <b>word-for-word</b> <b>translation,</b> with the term ifta’ (issuing of fatwas) omitted. He also argues that these systems shared fundamental freedoms: the freedom of a professor to profess his personal opinion and the freedom of a student to pass judgement on what he is learning.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{the term}} [...] "Chinatown" [...] {{was first used}} in Asia, it {{does not come from}} a Chinese language. [...] Its {{earliest}} appearance seems to have been in connection with the Chinese quarter of Singapore, which by 1844 was already being called [...] "China Town" [...] or [...] "Chinatown" [...] by the British colonial government. This may have been a <b>word-for-word</b> <b>translation</b> into English of the Malay name for that quarter, which in those days was probably [...] "Kampong China" [...] or possibly [...] "Kota China" [...] or [...] "Kampong Tionghua/Chunghwa/Zhonghua".|$|E
2500|$|A {{more modern}} Chinese name is [...] (Cantonese: Waa Fau, Mandarin: Huábù) meaning [...] "Chinese City", {{used in the}} semi-official Chinese {{translations}} of some cities' documents and signs. Bù, pronounced sometimes in Mandarin as fù, usually means seaport; but in this sense, it means city or town. Likewise, Tong yan fau ( [...] Tángrén bù [...] "Tang people's town") is also used in Cantonese nowadays. The literal <b>word-for-word</b> <b>translation</b> of Chinatown—Zhōngguó Chéng ( [...] ) is also used, but more frequently by visiting Chinese nationals rather than immigrants of Chinese descent who live in various Chinatowns.|$|E
2500|$|Whether prophetic or not, however, Pentecostals are {{agreed that}} all public utterances in an unknown tongue must be {{interpreted}} {{in the language of}} the gathered Christians. This is accomplished by the gift of interpretation, and this gift can be exercised by the same individual who first delivered the message (if he or she possesses the gift of interpretation) or by another individual who possesses the required gift. If a person with the gift of tongues is not sure that a person with the gift of interpretation is present and is unable to interpret the utterance him or herself, then the person should not speak. Pentecostals teach that those with the gift of tongues should pray for the gift of interpretation. Pentecostals do not require that an interpretation be a literal <b>word-for-word</b> <b>translation</b> of a glossolalic utterance. Rather, as the word [...] "interpretation" [...] implies, Pentecostals expect only an accurate explanation of the utterance's meaning.|$|E

40|$|Little {{data have}} been {{published}} {{on the subject of}} medical research and translation. This study endeavours to contribute to such literature by investigating the quality of original and retranslated medical questionnaires. The various steps researchers follow when translating their questionnaires or other texts are considered, while the different translation approaches and their impact on the quality of medical research are briefly discussed. These are the linguistic, text-linguistic and functionalist approaches. The design, translation approach and quality of the original translations are explained, along with the development of the retranslation questionnaires. Since the functionalist approach does not essentially follow equivalent <b>word-for-word</b> <b>translations,</b> back translation was omitted in the retranslation. One of the main functions of functionalism or Skopos (Greek for purpose, aim or intention) is to translate with the target audience in mind. By following this functionalist approach when translating medical questionnaires, the translator can ensure that the communication is successful. At the same time, the collection of valid data in medical research is ensured, improving the quality of these data. It is recommended that trained translators, who are familiar with the subject matter, do the translations. Copyright © 2005 NISC Pty Ltd. Articl...|$|R
