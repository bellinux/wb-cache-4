5|$|During the Palladian revival {{period in}} Ireland, even quite modest mansions were {{cast in a}} neo-Palladian mould. Palladian {{architecture}} in Ireland subtly differs from that in England. While adhering as in other countries to the basic ideals of Palladio, it is often truer to them – perhaps because it was often designed by architects who had come directly from mainland Europe, and therefore were not influenced by the evolution that Palladianism was undergoing in Britain. <b>Whatever</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason,</b> Palladianism still had to be adapted for the wetter, colder weather.|$|E
5|$|On {{some of the}} figures, however, {{there still}} remains clear {{evidence}} of painting in carbon black. The apparent explanation {{for this is that}} over the long period that Michelangelo was at work, he probably, for a variety of reasons, varied his technique. Things that might affect the degree of finish achieved on a particular giornata include the heat and humidity of the day and the length of daylight hours. <b>Whatever</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> for the difference is, a difference in approach to the light and shade on the individual figures is clearly apparent.|$|E
5|$|James then flew to Algiers, {{where he}} was {{publicly}} paraded through the airport and driven to meet General Maitland Wilson, ostensibly for a meeting to discuss operations against the south of France. Instead, he was moved quietly to a remote villa by 'A' Force's Rex Hamer. Rumours suggest this was because James had been spotted smoking and staggering around Algiers, so the deceivers decided to cut his appearances short. <b>Whatever</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason,</b> the next day, out of character, James was flown to Cairo. He was to remain hidden there until the public disclosure of Montgomery's presence in France. Meanwhile, double agents in North Africa were used to extend the masquerade {{for a few more}} days, by hinting Montgomery was still in the region.|$|E

5|$|Louisville's Courier-Journal {{carried an}} {{announcement}} of Blackburn's candidacy for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in Kentucky on February 11, 1878. It {{is not clear}} why, with only meager prior political experience, he decided to seek the office. He may {{have been influenced by}} the members of his family who were involved in politics. His brother Joseph was, at the time, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, and another brother, James, had served in the Kentucky Senate. Two of his wife's brothers also held political office; Samuel Churchill was Secretary of State under Governors John L. Helm, John W. Stevenson, and Preston Leslie, and Thomas Churchill served as treasurer and later {{governor of the state of}} Arkansas. <b>Whatever</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason,</b> even his friends did not believe his announcement was wise due to his political inexperience. He opened his campaign with a speech in Owen County on March 29, 1878.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1911 federal election, {{several local}} Liberals opposed to Frank Oliver asked Rutherford {{to run against}} him in Strathcona. Relations between Oliver and Rutherford had always been chilly—Oliver was implacably opposed to Cross, who he viewed as a rival for {{dominance}} of the Liberal party in Alberta, and his Edmonton Bulletin had taken {{the side of the}} dissidents during the railway scandal. A nominating meeting unanimously nominated Rutherford as Liberal candidate, though Oliver refused to accept its legitimacy and awaited a later meeting. Before this meeting came to pass, however, Rutherford abruptly withdrew. Historian Douglas Babcock suggested that this was due to the Conservatives' nomination of William Antrobus Griesbach, dashing Rutherford's hopes that his popularity among Conservatives would preclude their opposing him. Rumours at the time alleged that Rutherford had been asked to make a personal contribution of $15,000 to his campaign fund, and had balked. Rutherford himself cited a desire to avoid splitting the vote on reciprocity, which he and Oliver both favoured but Griesbach opposed. <b>Whatever</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason,</b> for Rutherford's standing aloof from the election, Oliver was nominated as Liberal candidate and was re-elected.|$|E
5|$|Mills's and Cleveland's defeat on the tariff {{bill could}} be {{considered}} a victory for Randall, but the vote showed how isolated the former Speaker's protectionist ideas now made him in his party: only four Democrats voted against the tariff reductions. The state party likewise turned against Randall and toward free trade, adopting a pro-tariff revision platform at the 1888 state Democratic convention. At the same time, Randall seemingly reversed his long-standing commitment to fiscal economy by voting with the Republicans to override Cleveland's veto of the Dependent and Disability Pension Act. The Act would have given a pension to every Union veteran (or their widows) who claimed he could no longer perform physical labor, regardless of whether his disability was war-related. Cleveland's veto was in line with his record of small-government cost-cutting, with which Randall would normally have sympathized. Randall, perhaps in an effort to gain favor with veterans in his district, joined the Republicans in an unsuccessful attempt to override Cleveland's veto. Another possibility proposed by biographer House is that Randall saw the federal budget surplus as reason to cut tariffs; by increasing federal spending, he hoped to decrease the surplus and maintain the need for high tariffs. <b>Whatever</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason,</b> the attempt failed and left Randall further alienated from his fellow Democrats.|$|E

5|$|<b>Whatever</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> that Renaissance style {{never became}} popular in Sicily, it was {{certainly}} not ignorance. Antonello Gagini was midway through constructing the church of Santa Maria di Porto Salvo in 1536 in the Renaissance style when he died; he was superseded by the architect Antonio Scaglione, who completed the building in a Norman style. This style seems to have influenced Sicilian architecture almost up {{to the time of}} the 1693 earthquake. Even Mannerism passed the island by. Only in the architecture of Messina could a Renaissance influence be discerned, partly for geographical reasons: within sight of mainland Italy and the most important port in Sicily, Messina was always more amenable to the prevailing tides of fashion outside the island. The town's aristocratic patrons would often call on Florence or Rome to provide them with an architect; one example was the Florentine Giovanni Angelo Montorsoli, who established the Tuscan styles of architecture and sculpture there in the mid-16th century. However, these influences remained largely confined to Messina and the surrounding district. It seems likely that it was the patronage of the Roman Catholic Church, removed from the influences of Roman fashion, that remained conservative in architectural taste.|$|E
5|$|Anne was {{recalled}} {{to marry}} her Irish cousin, James Butler, {{a young man who}} was several years older than she and who was living at the English court, in an attempt to settle a dispute over the title and estates of the Earldom of Ormond. The 7th Earl of Ormond died in 1515, leaving his daughters, Margaret Boleyn and Anne St Leger, as co-heiresses. In Ireland, the great-great-grandson of the 3rd earl, Sir Piers Butler, contested the will and claimed the Earldom himself. He was already in possession of Kilkenny Castle – the ancestral seat of the earls. Sir Thomas Boleyn, being the son of the eldest daughter, felt the title belonged to him and protested to his brother-in-law, the Duke of Norfolk, who spoke to King Henry about the matter. Henry, fearful the dispute could be the spark to ignite civil war in Ireland, sought to resolve the matter by arranging an alliance between Piers's son, James, and Anne Boleyn. She would bring her Ormond inheritance as dowry and thus end the dispute. The plan ended in failure, perhaps because Sir Thomas hoped for a grander marriage for his daughter or because he himself coveted the titles. <b>Whatever</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason,</b> the marriage negotiations came to a complete halt. James Butler later married Lady Joan Fitzgerald, daughter and heiress of James FitzGerald, 10th Earl of Desmond and Amy O'Brien.|$|E

25|$|In May 1643, the Swedish Privy Council {{decided to}} attack Denmark. The Torstenson War was at large parts {{the work of}} Oxenstierna.

The outcome of the war was decided in the naval battle of Fehmarn Belt in 1644 where the Royal Swedish Navy decisively defeated the Danish Navy. The defeat of the Danish Navy left the Danish isles open to a Swedish invasion, and Denmark sued for peace. Oxenstierna was personally involved in the negotiations leading to the Treaty of Brömsebro, with which Sweden gained Gotland, Saaremaa (Ösel), Jämtland, Härjedalen and for thirty years Halland. Shortly after the peace treaty, Oxenstierna was created Count of Södermöre.|$|E
25|$|After {{meeting in}} Acre in June, the crusading kings Louis VII of France and Conrad III of Germany agreed with Melisende, Baldwin III {{and the major}} nobles of the kingdom to attack Damascus.

Perhaps remembering attacks launched on Jerusalem from Damascus in previous decades, Damascus {{seemed to be the}} best target for the crusade, rather than Aleppo or another city to the north which would have allowed for the recapture of Edessa. The subsequent Siege of Damascus was a complete failure; when the city seemed {{to be on the verge}} of collapse, the crusader army suddenly moved against another section of the walls, and were driven back. The crusaders retreated within three days. There were rumours of treachery and bribery, and Conrad III felt betrayed by the nobility of Jerusalem. <b>Whatever</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> for the failure, the French and German armies returned home, and a few years later Damascus was firmly under Nur ad-Din's control.|$|E
