500|$|Describing {{the general}} {{tone of the}} show, Teri Fitsell of The New Zealand Herald {{explains}} that [...] "South Park is a vicious social satire that works by spotlighting not the immorality of these kids but their amorality, and contrasting it with the conniving hypocrisy of the adults who surround them." [...] The humor of the show comes from the disparity between the cute appearance of the characters and their crude behavior. However, Parker and Stone said in an early interview that the show's language is realistic. [...] "There are so many shows where little kids are good and sweet, and it's just not real... Don't people remember what they were like in third grade? <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>little</b> bastards." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{humor of}} the show comes from the [...] "disparity" [...] between the [...] "cute" [...] {{appearance}} of the characters and their [...] "crude" [...] behavior. However, Parker and Stone said in an early interview that the show's language is realistic. [...] "There are so many shows where little kids are good and sweet, and it's just not real... Don't people remember what they were like in third grade? <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>little</b> bastards." [...] Frederic Biddle of The Boston Globe notes how the show [...] "constantly plays on its grade-school aesthetic for shock value, with great success", arguing that at its height, it is [...] "more a profane 'Peanuts' than a downsized 'Beavis and Butt-Head.'" [...] He points, for example, to Kenny, who symbolically represents the voiceless underclass, which is eliminated in each episode. Claire Bickley of the Toronto Sun explains that [...] "The show captures that mix of innocence and viciousness that can co-exist in kids that age", that [...] "the boys are fascinated by bodily functions", and that they [...] "mimic adult behavior and language". For example, Kyle instructs Stan and Wendy to [...] "make sweet love down by the fire", a phrase he learns from Chef. In a light-hearted study of the humor of flatulence, Jim Dawson explains how the rise of adult animation in the 1990s allowed television to indulge in such humor with The Ren & Stimpy Show, The Simpsons, and Beavis and Butt-Head. Beginning with [...] "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe", South Park builds on this tradition.|$|E

2500|$|The 1987–88 season saw {{the club}} {{promoted}} to the First Division, then the highest tier of English league football, for the first time. Sheringham scored the first goal in Millwall's first home game in Division One. Millwall briefly topped {{the table at the}} start of October 1988 and the goals of Sheringham (15) and Cascarino (15) kept Millwall in the top four for most of the season before fading after Easter to finish in 10th position. Sheringham said in his autobiography: [...] "It was a crazy exhilarating time. There <b>we</b> <b>were,</b> <b>little</b> Millwall, in our first season in the First Division and topping the table until about March. Everybody said it couldn't last and of course it couldn't and it didn't, but we gave them all a good run for their money. We were beating the best teams when we shouldn't and getting away draws to which we had no right." ...|$|E

And it's very good to...it's very easy to piss people off when you're fifteen, {{especially}} it's easy to piss off your parents and adults, in general. But as you get a little older, or as I've gotten older, I've looked back on the symbol of Bad Religion as still having some meaning, but I wish it wasn't so offensive to other people, because other people could benefit from the ideas, I think, that we've laid down. For instance, what we look at it today as is just a symbol...the cross is sort of the international symbol [...] as this parking symbol, the no parking is...everybody in the world can recognize it. The cross we look at as an international symbol for religion, and it's not anti-Christian, it's not anti-Buddhist, it's not anti-Jewish, it's not anti-anything. It's simply is [...] showing...it's our way of showing that we don't like to subscribe to dogmatic ways of life and dogmatic views on life and that religion, in general, is founded in dogma and in restriction of ideas, restriction of thought and it's these things that I feel are bad about religion, it's also very bad about nationalistic views, it's very bad...it's something that mankind, as a group, is not going to benefit from; it's only something that mankind will... it's something mankind will...I'm sorry, it's something that will instill violence, and it will instill fighting, and it will instill non-cooperation of different groups of humans." ...|$|E

IS it only clockwork to which we respond and quiver? Now we laugh, now we cry, now we dance; our little arms go out to clasp one another, our little lips kiss, then say good-bye. We strive, and we strain, and we struggle. We reach now for gold, now for laurel. We call it desire and ambition: are they only wires that you play? Will you throw the clockwork aside, or use it again, O Master? ...|$|R

"I know you," [...] {{answered}} Pharaoh slowly, [...] "as well I may, {{seeing that}} we played together when <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>little.</b> You are that Hebrew whom my sister, she who sleeps in Osiris, {{took to be}} as a son to her, giving to you a name that means 'drawn forth' because she drew you forth as an infant from among the reeds of Nile.

At his death, he passed us over to this man; for no better reason that I know of, than his being a friend or connexion of his, whose name was always in print and catching his attention.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This is Bob Jakin, aunt," [...] said Tom, {{bridling}} the irritation that aunt Glegg's voice always produced. [...] "I've {{known him}} ever since <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>little</b> boys. He's {{a very good}} fellow, and always ready to do me a kindness.

A large interest is got in that way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, dear, I 'll tell you.
