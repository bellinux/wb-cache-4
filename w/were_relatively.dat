5|$|The {{discovery}} of a juvenile specimen with a nearly complete hindlimb shows that the legs <b>were</b> <b>relatively</b> longer in juveniles, and the lower segments of the leg (shin and foot) <b>were</b> <b>relatively</b> longer than the thigh. These differences suggest that younger Allosaurus were faster and had different hunting strategies than adults, perhaps chasing small prey as juveniles, then becoming ambush hunters of large prey upon adulthood. The thigh bone became thicker and wider during growth, and the cross-section less circular, as muscle attachments shifted, muscles became shorter, {{and the growth of}} the leg slowed. These changes imply that juvenile legs has less predictable stresses compared with adults, which would have moved with more regular forward progression. Conversely, the skull bones appear to have generally grown isometrically, increasing in size without changing in proportion.|$|E

Although revolts <b>were</b> <b>relatively</b> commonplace in Mount Lebanon, the ousting of a noble family by their peasant subjects was unprecedented.

Shahin, who by this point oversaw a 1,000-strong militia, exercised power by seizing arms, ensured the upholding of the law and established security on the roads.

He also entered into negotiations with the Khazen sheikhs, but they reached a stalemate.|$|E
