500|$|In 1995, Hill joined The North Face {{climbing}} {{team and}} {{was paid to}} travel {{around the world to}} climb. She first visited Kyrgyzstan's Karavshin Valley to climb with Alex Lowe, Kitty Calhoun, Jay Smith, Conrad Anker, Greg Child, Dan Osman, and Chris Noble. They camped for a month and were cut off from the world, <b>without</b> <b>even</b> <b>a</b> radio. In her autobiography, Hill writes that [...] "such isolation made me feel vulnerable". Hill was not used to mountain climbing (as opposed to rock climbing) and the unpredictability of it unnerved her, with its increased risk of storms and rock slides. Furthermore, she liked focusing on the style of ascending rather than just summitting; she realized on this trip that her style of free climbing was not conducive to summitting or mountain climbing. Rather than pursue ever higher climbs, therefore, she chose to climb in new places, such as Morocco, Vietnam, Thailand, Scotland, Japan, Madagascar, Australia, and South America; many of these climbs were filmed and helped promote climbing in general.|$|E

[...] In addition to his failed campaign in Wales, Henry's mercenary Norse navy, which he had hired to harass the Welsh coast, turned out to be too small to be useful, and was disbanded without engagement. Henry II's Welsh campaign was a complete failure, with the king abandoning all plans for the conquest of Wales, returning to his court in Anjou and not returning to England for another four years.

2500|$|For example: [...] " [...] Whoever {{intentionally}} attributes a lie against me, {{should prepare}} {{his seat in}} the Fire." [...] This is a mutawatir hadith in its wordings {{because it has a}} minimum of seventy-four narrators. In other words, seventy-four companions of Muhammad have reported this hadith at different occasions, all with the same words. The number of those who received this hadith from the Companions is many times greater, because each of the seventy four Companions has conveyed it to a number of his students. Thus the total number of narrators of this hadith has been increasing in each successive generation and has never been less than seventy-four. All these narrators who now are hundreds in number, report it in the same words <b>without</b> <b>even</b> <b>a</b> minor change. This hadith is therefore mutawatir in its wording, because it cannot be imagined reasonably that such {{a large number of people}} have colluded to coin a fallacious sentence in order to attribute it to Muhammad.|$|E
2500|$|The Angevin army {{advanced}} from Oswestry into Wales {{crossing the}} mountains towards Mur Castell, and {{found itself in}} the thick forest of the Ceiriog Valley where they were forced into a narrow thin line. Owain I had positioned a band of skirmishers in the thick woods overlooking the pass, which harassed the exposed army from a secured position. Henry II ordered the clearing of the woods on either side to widen the passage through the valley, and to lessen the exposure of his army. The road his army traveled later {{became known as the}} Ffordd y Saeson, the English Road, and leads through heath and bog towards the Dee. In a dry summer the moors may have been passable, however [...] "on this occasion the skies put on their most wintry aspect; and the rain fell in torrents [...] flooding the mountain meadows" [...] until the great Angevin encampment became a [...] "morass," [...] wrote Lloyd.
