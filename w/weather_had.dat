5|$|In 1999 severe <b>weather</b> <b>had</b> {{damaging}} {{effects on}} the wine producing industry, including hailstorms in May that affected Roussillon and a rain surge in mid November that saw a year's worth of rain fall in 36 hours {{in the areas of}} Corbières and Minervois in the western Languedoc.|$|E
5|$|Kroonland was {{launched}} {{on the afternoon}} of 20 February 1902 in a small, informal ceremony. Mrs. Rodman Griscom christened the ship, but Kroonland did not budge on the launching way; cold <b>weather</b> <b>had</b> frozen the tallow used to grease the timbers. Hydraulic jacks eventually freed the ship for her plunge into the Delaware River.|$|E
5|$|The jet, already {{several hours}} behind schedule, then {{suffered}} further delays taxiing to the runway.

5|$|Although the <b>weather</b> <b>had</b> {{been mostly}} rainy {{up to this}} point in the campaign, a snow storm arrived the night of February 13, with strong winds that brought {{temperatures}} down to 10–12°F (−12°C) and deposited 3inches (8cm) of snow by morning. Guns and wagons were frozen to the earth. Because of the proximity of the enemy lines and the active sharpshooters, the soldiers could not light campfires for warmth or cooking, and both sides were miserable that night, many having arrived without blankets or overcoats.|$|E
5|$|As {{the crew}} {{worked through the}} {{procedures}} and checklists for entry on Friday, the managers on the ground closely examined the weather patterns around Florida, which were less than favorable. The crew was advised that there were low clouds and thunderstorms, both conditions that violated landing criteria, so managers waived the first opportunity. A second opportunity was also not taken, as the <b>weather</b> <b>had</b> not improved. Entry Flight Director Norm Knight called up Edwards Air Force Base shortly after the decision to delay to Saturday was made, which would give the crew {{a total of six}} Saturday landing opportunities, three at each location.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 13 June, two Argentine Dagger {{aircraft}} attacked Cardiffs Lynx helicopter, no.335 of 829NAS, while it was searching in the Falkland Sound area. Poor <b>weather</b> <b>had</b> forced the Argentine craft to abandon their original mission of bombing Mount Longdon, and the third Dagger of their formation had suffered a mechanical failure and returned to base. The Lynx began evasive manoeuvres and dodged the attacks; the pilot, Lieutenant Christopher Clayton, was mentioned in despatches for his efforts.|$|E

30|$|During {{weathering}} and leaching periods, weathering and leaching {{facilitate the}} formation {{of large numbers of}} dissolution pores in the surface and upper sections of volcanic rocks, which may connect primary reservoir spaces and enhance reservoir properties in volcanic rocks significantly. Core analysis data show that the Carboniferous basalts in the Ludong area of the Junggar Basin without <b>weathering</b> <b>have</b> an average original porosity of 7.6  %, basalts with weak <b>weathering</b> <b>have</b> an average porosity of 8.7  % and basalts with strong <b>weathering</b> <b>have</b> an average porosity of 15.3  %. Therefore, {{it can be seen that}} weathering and leaching are the major forces for {{the formation of}} secondary pores in this area.|$|R
5|$|Although {{this period}} had been productive, the bad <b>weather</b> <b>had</b> such a {{detrimental}} effect on Chopin's health that Sand determined {{to leave the}} island. To avoid further customs duties, Sand sold the piano to a local French couple, the Canuts. The group traveled first to Barcelona, then to Marseilles, where they stayed {{for a few months}} while Chopin convalesced. In May 1839 they headed for the summer to Sand's estate at Nohant, where they spent most summers until 1846. In autumn they returned to Paris, where Chopin's apartment at 5 rue Tronchet was close to Sand's rented accommodation at the rue Pigalle. He frequently visited Sand in the evenings, but both retained some independence. In 1842 he and Sand moved to the Square d'Orléans, living in adjacent buildings.|$|E
5|$|At 8:30am on 24 August, Milne Bay GHQ was alerted by an RAAF Hudson bomber near Kitava Island, off the Trobriand Islands, and coastwatchers that a Japanese convoy was {{approaching}} the Milne Bay area. – escorting the transport SS Tasman– left the Milne Bay area and sailed for Port Moresby after {{learning of the}} invasion force. Reports of the second Japanese convoy, consisting of seven barges, which had sailed from Buna carrying the force that would land at Taupota were also received at this time. In response to this sighting, after the initially poor <b>weather</b> <b>had</b> cleared, 12 RAAF Kittyhawks were scrambled at midday. The barges were spotted beached near Goodenough Island where the 350 troops of the 5th Sasebo SNLF, led by Commander Tsukioka, had gone ashore to rest. The Australian pilots then proceeded to strafe the barges and, {{over the course of}} two hours, destroyed them all and stranded their former occupants.|$|E
5|$|Early {{on in the}} 2010 outdoor season, Bolt ran 19.56 {{seconds in}} the 200 m in Kingston, Jamaica for the fourth-fastest run of all-time, {{although}} he stated {{that he had no}} record breaking ambitions for the forthcoming season. He took to the international circuit May with wins in East Asia at the Colorful Daegu Pre-Championships Meeting and then a comfortable win in his 2010 IAAF Diamond League debut at the Shanghai Golden Grand Prix. Bolt made an attempt to break Michael Johnson's best time over the rarely competed 300 metres event at the Golden Spike meeting in Ostrava. He failed to match Johnson's ten-year-old record of 30.85 and suffered a setback in that his 30.97-second run in wet <b>weather</b> <b>had</b> left him with an Achilles tendon problem.|$|E

5|$|Godley's II ANZAC Corps {{played an}} {{important}} role in the Passchendaele offensive in October 1917. Following the success of his corps at the Battle of Broodseinde on 4 October 1917, Godley believed the morale of the Germans was low, and pushed for further attacks to secure the Passchendaele Ridge. This was in concert with the preference of Field Marshal Douglas Haig, the commander of the British Expeditionary Force. However, Godley's superior officer, General Herbert Plumer, preferred to halt the offensive as the <b>weather</b> <b>had</b> deteriorated immediately after the battle. An attack on 9 October by the 49th and 66th Divisions, both British formations attached to II ANZAC Corps, was hampered by the poor weather which showed no signs of abating and achieved very limited gains.|$|E
5|$|Pinafore {{opened on}} 25 May 1878 at the Opera Comique, before an {{enthusiastic}} audience, with Sullivan conducting. Soon, however, the piece suffered from weak ticket sales, generally ascribed to a heat wave {{that made the}} Opera Comique particularly uncomfortable. The historian Michael Ainger questions this explanation, at least in part, stating that the heat waves {{in the summer of}} 1878 were short and transient. By mid-August, Sullivan wrote to his mother that cooler <b>weather</b> <b>had</b> arrived, which was good for the show. In the meantime, the four partners of the Comedy Opera Company lost confidence in the opera's viability and posted closing notices. Carte publicised the piece by presenting a matinee concert performance on 6 July 1878 at the enormous Crystal Palace.|$|E
5|$|Sheridan's {{original}} {{orders were}} {{to destroy the}} Virginia Central Railroad and then meet with the army of Union General William Tecumseh Sherman in North Carolina. Sheridan reached Charlottesville on March 3, but faced delays caused by muddy roads. During that time, Custer's division (including the 2nd West Virginia Cavalry) destroyed the railroad line between Lynchburg and Amherst Courthouse, and Devin's division destroyed the James River Canal. Rainy <b>weather</b> <b>had</b> caused the James River to swell. The deeper and wider river became dangerous to cross, and fords became unusable. The swollen river, and bridges that had been destroyed by the Confederates, persuaded Sheridan to move east toward Richmond instead of moving south across the river to link with Sherman's army in North Carolina. Sheridan's army kept north of the James River, and reached Columbia, Virginia, on March 10.|$|E

5|$|The 53rd {{edition of}} the annual Gator Bowl game kicked off on January 1, 1998. An {{estimated}} 54,116 fans were in attendance at the game, which was held in Jacksonville's Alltel Stadium, since renamed Jacksonville Municipal Stadium. The game was televised on NBC, and an estimated 5.1 million Americans watched the broadcast, giving the game a television rating of 3.7, 12th highest of the 21 bowl games that season. Charlie Jones, Bob Trumpy, John Dockery were the sportscasters of the broadcast. During the week prior to the game, the <b>weather</b> <b>had</b> been cold and rainy, with temperatures in the mid-40s and more than two inches of rain. At kickoff, the weather was clear, with temperatures near 55 degrees. North Carolina won the ceremonial pre-game coin toss to determine first possession and elected to play defense to begin the game.|$|E
5|$|The Luftwaffe {{began its}} eighth {{consecutive}} night of bombing London on 15 September. Soon after midnight, 13 unidentified Dornier Do 17 light bombers attacked the capital. At 00:15 two Junkers Ju 88s followed from Kampfgeschwader 51 (KG 51, or 51st Bomber Wing). A further 11 Heinkel He 111s from an unidentified unit bombed the city again at 00:50. At 02:00, five He 111s from Kampfgeschwader 4 (KG 4) bombed the city. A full strike by the Geschwader had been planned, but bad <b>weather</b> <b>had</b> forced a cancellation after five He 111s had taken off. Most {{of the damage}} was done to residential areas in Fulham, Chelsea and Westminster. Around 19 {{people were killed and}} 31 injured. The heaviest casualties were caused when a bomb fell on a church in Chelsea killing 14 and injuring 26. Small raiding forces bombed Cardiff, Bootle (in Liverpool), Leicester and Ipswich. At Bootle, only slight damage was done to rail tracks and facilities at West Alexandra Dock.|$|E
5|$|The {{floating}} {{stage on}} which Jarre and his musicians performed {{was built on}} top of four large barges. Large purpose-built display screens were built, {{and one of the}} buildings {{to be used as a}} backdrop was painted white. One large mirror ball being transported to the event fell onto the roadside, causing a degree of confusion as some people mistook it for a fallen satellite. World War II searchlights were installed, to illuminate the sky and surrounding architecture. Along with thousands in the surrounding streets and parks, 200,000people watched Jarre and guests such as guitarist Hank Marvin perform in less than ideal conditions. Inclement <b>weather</b> <b>had</b> threatened to break the stage from its moorings, putting paid to the original plan to float the stage across the Royal Victoria Dock. Wind speeds were so high that television cameras were blown over. On the second evening the audience, which included Diana, Princess of Wales, was soaked by rain and wind.|$|E

5|$|The {{subtropical}} {{storm had}} an unusual origin by forming from an interaction {{of two different}} systems near the Yucatán Peninsula. This occurrence is unusual, but not unique, as Subtropical Storm One in the 1974 season formed in similar pattern. A reconnaissance flight on June 17 reported that {{there appeared to be}} multiple transient circulations at the surface, but no well-defined center. The first disturbance {{can be traced back to}} June 15 in the northwest Caribbean Sea. The disturbance moved north, along with a low-pressure area that formed over the Yucatán Peninsula. A trough merged with the low-pressure area creating an even stronger trough over the eastern Gulf of Mexico. Conditions in the Gulf of Mexico were favorable for tropical storm formation. Some severe <b>weather</b> <b>had</b> been occurring over the Florida Peninsula as early as June 16, as the fringes of disturbance moved across the Florida Straits and over the Peninsula.|$|E
5|$|The <b>weather</b> <b>had</b> {{begun to}} deteriorate, {{and it was}} decided that the schuit was not strong enough to bring the {{remaining}} Malagasy ashore. One end of a rope was anchored to the shore, and at low tide volunteers from the Dutch group on shore swam out to Meermin, bringing {{the other end of the}} rope with them and handing it up to the crew on the ship. The crew then helped the remaining fifty-three Malagasy climb down to the Dutch volunteers, who helped them to shore, some carrying children on their backs. The Dutch built a fire to warm the Malagasy after their immersion in the water, and fed them; three wagons took them to Cape Town on 12March. Of the 140 or so Malagasy who had been shipped, 112 reached the Cape Colony as slaves.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{his return}} to competition, the 200 m {{remained}} Bolt's primary event, beating Justin Gatlin's meet record in Ostrava, Czech Republic. Bolt had aspired to run under twenty seconds to claim a season's best but, {{despite the fact that}} bad <b>weather</b> <b>had</b> impaired his run, he was happy to end the meeting with just the victory. However, a sub-20-second finish was soon his, as he set a new personal best of 19.88 s at the 2006 Athletissima Grand Prix in Lausanne, Switzerland, finishing behind Xavier Carter and Tyson Gay to earn a bronze medal. Bolt had focused his athletics aims, stating that 2006 was a year to gain experience. Also, he was more keen on competing over longer distances, setting his sights on running regularly in both 200 m and 400 m events within the next two years.|$|E
