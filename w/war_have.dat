5|$|Almost all of Manila's prewar and Spanish colonial {{architecture}} {{were destroyed}} during its battle for liberation by the intensive bombardment of the United States Air Force during World War II. Reconstruction took place afterwards, replacing the destroyed historic Spanish-era buildings with modern ones, erasing {{much of the}} city's character. Some buildings destroyed by the <b>war</b> <b>have</b> been reconstructed, such as the Old Legislative Building (now the National Museum of Fine Arts), Ayuntamiento de Manila (now the Bureau of the Treasury) and the currently under construction San Ignacio Church and Convent (as the Museo de Intramuros). There are plans to rehabilitate and/or restore several neglected historic buildings and places such as Plaza Del Carmen, San Sebastian Church and the Manila Metropolitan Theater. Spanish-era shops and houses in the districts of Binondo, Quiapo, and San Nicolas are also planned to be restored, {{as a part of}} a movement to restore the city to its former glory and its beautiful prewar state.|$|E

5|$|The ancient {{sources for}} the sacred war are scant, and {{generally}} lacking in firm chronological information. Modern historians' dates for the <b>war</b> <b>have</b> therefore been hotly debated, with no clear consensus. It is generally accepted that the war lasted 10 years, and ended in summer 346 BC (one of the only firm dates), which yields a date of 356 BC {{for the beginning of}} the war, with Philomelos's seizure of Delphi. After Philomelos's defeat at Neon, the Thebans thought it safe to send the general Pammenes to Asia with 5000 hoplites; as has been discussed, Pammenes probably met with Philip at Maroneia in 355 BC, presumably on his outward journey. Buckler, the only historian to produce a systematic study of the sacred war, therefore places Neon in 355 BC, and suggests after the meeting with Pammenes, Philip went to begin the siege of Methone. Other historians have placed Neon in 354 BC, because Diodorus says that the battle took place while Philip besieged Methone which Diodorus (at one point) places in 354 BC. However, Diodorus's chronology for the sacred war is very confused—he dates the start and end of the war a year too late, variously says the war lasted 9, 10 or 11 years, and included the siege of Methone twice under different dates—and his dates cannot therefore be relied upon.|$|E

50|$|Civil wars {{since the}} end of World <b>War</b> II <b>have</b> lasted on average just over four years, a {{dramatic}} rise from the one-and-a-half-year average of the 1900-1944 period. While the rate of emergence of new civil <b>wars</b> <b>has</b> been relatively steady since the mid-19th century, the increasing length of those <b>wars</b> <b>has</b> resulted in increasing numbers of wars ongoing at any one time. For example, there were no more than five civil wars underway simultaneously {{in the first half of}} the 20th century while there were over 20 concurrent civil wars close to the end of the Cold War. Since 1945, civil <b>wars</b> <b>have</b> resulted in the deaths of over 25 million people, as well as the forced displacement of millions more.
