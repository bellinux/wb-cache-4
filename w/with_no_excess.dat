5000|$|A {{series of}} {{humanitarian}} convoys {{was sent by}} the Ukrainian government to Luhansk Oblast in August. The first convoys, from the cities of Kiev, Kharkiv, and Dnipropetrovsk, arrived at Starobilsk and Sievierodonetsk on 8 and 10 August respectively. A total of sixty lorry-loads of aid were sent. Workers with the State Emergency Service of Ukraine continued to operate in areas controlled by the pro-Russian forces, unimpeded by the LPR. They worked with the local Red Cross to distribute aid. Another group of convoys was sent by the Ukrainian government on 14 August. Seventy-five lorries bound for Luhansk and carrying 800 t of aid left from the same cities as {{the first group of}} convoys. According to the government, the aid was transferred to the Red Cross for distribution upon arrival into the combat zone. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that Russia hoped to send a second [...] "humanitarian convoy" [...] to the Donbass conflict zone on 25 August. He stated [...] "The fact that the first convoy eventually delivered aid <b>with</b> <b>no</b> <b>excess</b> or incidents gives us reason to hope that the second one will go much more smoothly". This convoy crossed into Ukraine at Izvaryne on 13 September. OSCE monitors said that it consisted of 220 lorries. A third Russian aid convoy bound for Luhansk entered Ukraine at Izvaryne on 31 October. It consisted of about forty vehicles, all of which were inspected by both Russian and Ukrainian border guardsmen. Amnesty International reported on 24 December 2014 that pro-government volunteer territorial defence battalions were blocking Ukrainian aid convoys from entering separatist-controlled territory. These battalions, such as the Dnipro, Aidar, Donbas and Right Sector, have stopped most convoys from passing through, including those sent by Ukrainian oligarch Rinat Akhmetov. According to the report, the battalions believe that the aid will be sold by the separatists, rather than provided to residents of the Donbass. Furthermore, battalion members insisted that separatist forces needed to release prisoners of war if aid was to be allowed through. As a result of the war, more than half of those residents remaining in the Donbass rely entirely on humanitarian aid. Director of Europe and Central Asia for Amnesty International Denis Krivosheev said that [...] "Checking the content of humanitarian convoys crossing frontline is one thing. Preventing it is another. Attempting to create unbearable conditions of life is a whole new ballgame. Using starvation of civilians as a method of warfare is a war crime". In addition, the report said that the volunteer battalions often act like [...] "renegade gangs", and called on the Ukrainian government to bring them under control.|$|E
