5|$|Ahmad Karimi-Hakkak of the University of Maryland {{discusses}} how {{one aspect}} of Kiarostami's cinematic style {{is that he is}} able to capture essences of Persian poetry and create poetic imagery within the landscape of his films. In Where Is the Friend's Home? and The Wind <b>Will</b> <b>Carry</b> Us, classical Persian poetry is directly quoted in the film, highlighting the artistic link and intimate connection between them. This in turn reflects on the connection between the past and present, between continuity and change.|$|E

As the fleet follows Exile past the Grand Stream and enters Disith, it is able to destroy Delphine's forces.

The new harbour would provide new jobs increasing the workforce from some 2,000 today to 2,600 on completion. Karstens Skibsværft, Danish Yacht, and the herring processing firm, Skagerrak Pelgic, were reported to be the most successful companies in Skagen but the town was also home to FF Skagen, the world's top producer of fish meal and fish oil.|$|E

5|$|Kiarostami's films often {{reflect upon}} {{immaterial}} {{concepts such as}} the soul and afterlife. At times, however, {{the very concept of}} the spiritual seems to be contradicted by the medium itself, given that it has no inherent means to confer the metaphysical. Some film theorists have argued that The Wind <b>Will</b> <b>Carry</b> Us provides a template by which a filmmaker can communicate metaphysical reality. The limits of the frame and the representation through dialogue with another that is not represented, physically become metaphors for the relationship between this world and those that may exist apart from it. By limiting the space of the mise en scène, Kiarostami expands the space of the art.|$|E
5|$|Male orangutans play {{almost no}} role in raising the young. Females {{do most of the}} caring and socializing of the young. A female often has an older {{offspring}} with her to help in socializing the infant. Infant orangutans are completely dependent on their mothers for {{the first two years of}} their lives. The mother <b>will</b> <b>carry</b> the infant during travelling, as well as feed it and sleep with it in the same night nest. For the first four months, the infant is carried on its belly and never relieves physical contact. In the following months, the time an infant spends with its mother decreases.|$|E
5|$|Months {{before each}} Games, the Olympic Flame is lit in Olympia in a {{ceremony}} that reflects ancient Greek rituals. A female performer, acting as a priestess, ignites a torch by placing it inside a parabolic mirror which focuses the sun's rays; she then lights the torch of the first relay bearer, thus initiating the Olympic torch relay that <b>will</b> <b>carry</b> the flame to the host city's Olympic stadium, where it {{plays an important role}} in the opening ceremony. Though the flame has been an Olympic symbol since 1928, the torch relay was only introduced at the 1936 Summer Games to promote the Third Reich.|$|E

5|$|Around 5.4billion {{years from}} now, {{the core of}} the Sun will become hot enough to trigger {{hydrogen}} fusion in its surrounding shell. This will cause the outer layers of the star to expand greatly, and the star will enter a phase of its life in which it is called a red giant. Within 7.5billion years, the Sun will have expanded to a radius of 1.2AU—256 times its current size. At the tip of the red giant branch, {{as a result of the}} vastly increased surface area, the Sun's surface will be much cooler (about 2600K) than now and its luminosity much higher—up to 2,700current solar luminosities. For part of its red giant life, the Sun will have a strong stellar wind that <b>will</b> <b>carry</b> away around 33% of its mass. During these times, it is possible that Saturn's moon Titan could achieve surface temperatures necessary to support life.|$|E
5|$|This {{relationship}} between distance and intimacy, between imagery and sound, is {{also present in}} the opening sequence of The Wind <b>Will</b> <b>Carry</b> Us. From the outset, Kiarostami formulates a dialectical {{relationship between}} image and sound. The camera moves from long shots of the Land Rover winding {{its way through the}} mountain paths to extreme close-ups of the film’s protagonist. Concurrently, Kiarostami aurally represents an expanse that extends far beyond what the viewer can see at any moment, even when the camera remains a considerable distance from the subject matter on-screen. Kiarostami establishes numerous spaces beyond the visual field by fragmenting his soundtrack to include other sounds such as birds singing, dogs barking and electronic devices such as cell phones and radios blaring in the distance. By referring to characters the viewer does not see or hear, Kiarostami widens the scope of his films.|$|E

5|$|Like the FIFA World Cup, the Recopa Sudamericana is {{sponsored}} {{by a group of}} multinational corporations. Unlike the premier football tournament forementioned, the competition uses a single, main sponsor; it is currently primarily sponsored by Banco Santander, one of the largest banks in the world. The deal running for a period of three years began with the 2012 edition. As the main sponsor of the tournament, the competition <b>will</b> <b>carry</b> the name of the bank. Thus, the competition is known officially as the '"Copa Santander Libertadores'". The first primary sponsor of the competition was Fox Sports Latinoamérica, a Latin American cable television network focusing on sports-related programming including live and pre-recorded event telecasts, sports talk shows, and other original programmings. The sponsorship was only for the 2005 edition of the competition, being known officially as '"Fox Sports Recopa Sudamericana"'. The second primary sponsor was Visa, an American multinational financial services corporation. The deal ran for a period of 3 years which began with the 2006 edition. As the main sponsor of the tournament, the competition carried the name of the corporation. Thus, the competition was known officially as '"Recopa Visa Sudamericana"'.|$|E
5|$|The legal Underbelly DVD was {{released}} 8 May 2008 by Roadshow Entertainment, {{a day after}} the final episode was aired on television.

Roadshow Entertainment has confirmed that all box sets and point of sale displays <b>will</b> <b>carry</b> a sticker or stamp reminding buyers the series is not for sale, distribution or exhibition in Victoria. Legal experts said Victorians who bought the box set interstate and watched it themselves at home would likely not fall foul of the law, but anyone who showed it more widely could be charged with contempt. The DVD has sold 265,000 copies around Australia. In September 2008, a Limited Edition DVD {{was released}}, containing a numbered steel case and an extra disc with a documentary entitled Carl Williams– A Day of Reckoning.
