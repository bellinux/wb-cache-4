500|$|In March 1933 Waugh {{wrote to}} Peters from Chagford {{to say that}} he {{intended}} to call the novel A Handful of Ashes. This title was disliked by Harpers; an alternative, Fourth Decade, was also considered and rejected. Finally, the story was serialised under the title A Flat in London, and the chosen book title was A Handful of Dust—taken from a line in T. S. Eliot's poem The Waste Land: [...] "I <b>will</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> fear in a handful of dust." [...] The line is within the section of the poem entitled [...] "The Burial of the Dead", which depicts a comfortless, lifeless land of desert and rubble, reflecting the empty moral ambience of the novel. The title phrase had been used earlier by Joseph Conrad in the story [...] "Youth"; by Tennyson in Maud; and even earlier by John Donne in his Meditations.|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert, {{writing in}} the Chicago Sun-Times, awarded the film four out of four stars and praised the detail in the {{portrait}} of Johnny Marco, saying [...] "Coppola is a fascinating director. She sees, and we see exactly what she sees. There is little attempt here to observe a plot. All the attention is on the handful of characters, on Johnny." [...] A.O. Scott in The New York Times called the film [...] "exquisite, melancholy and formally audacious" [...] and said [...] "This {{is not a matter}} of imitation, but rather of mastery, of finding — by borrowing if necessary — a visual vocabulary suited to the story and its environment. If you pay close attention, [...] "Somewhere" [...] <b>will</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> everything." [...] Peter Bradshaw disagreed in The Guardian, awarding the film two stars from five. He praised the cinematic technique but said that the film resembled Lost in Translation too closely, lacked emotional depth and that even on second viewing [...] "the question of why we should really care or be interested remains tantalisingly unanswered"; the final shot failed to solve any emotional problems and [...] "really is one of the daftest things I have seen for a long time." ...|$|E
500|$|Within a month Louis de Bourbon, Prince of Condé, and Admiral Gaspard de Coligny {{had raised}} {{an army of}} 1,800. They formed an {{alliance}} with England and seized town after town in France. Catherine met Coligny, {{but he refused to}} back down. She therefore told him: [...] "Since you rely on your forces, we <b>will</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> ours". The royal army struck back quickly and laid siege to Huguenot-held Rouen. Catherine visited the deathbed of Antoine de Bourbon, King of Navarre, after he was fatally wounded by an arquebus shot. Catherine insisted on visiting the field herself and when warned of the dangers laughed, [...] "My courage is as great as yours". The Catholics took Rouen, but their triumph was short lived. On 18 February 1563, a spy called Poltrot de Méré fired an arquebus {{into the back of the}} Duke of Guise, at the siege of Orléans. The murder triggered an aristocratic blood feud that complicated the French civil wars for years to come. Catherine, however, was delighted with the death of her ally. [...] "If Monsieur de Guise had perished sooner", she told the Venetian ambassador, [...] "peace would have been achieved more quickly". On 19 March 1563, the Edict of Amboise, also known as the Edict of Pacification, ended the war. Catherine now rallied both Huguenot and Catholic forces to retake Le Havre from the English.|$|E

2500|$|Among its best-known phrases are [...] "April is the cruellest month", [...] "I <b>will</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> fear in {{a handful}} of dust" [...] and [...] "Shantih shantih shantih". The Sanskrit mantra ends the poem.|$|E
2500|$|In 1954, DePaul adopted {{its current}} armorial seal with {{coat of arms}} and motto: [...] "Viam sapientiae monstrabo tibi" [...] ("I <b>will</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> the way of wisdom", Proverbs, IV, 11). In 1955, the Frank J. Lewis Foundation donated the 18-story Kimball Building, rechristened the Lewis Center, at 25 East Jackson Boulevard, to the university. The building, still used today, was {{the hub of the}} Loop campus until 1993, when the DePaul Center opened at 1 East Jackson Boulevard (at State Street).|$|E
2500|$|The Waste Land {{is a long}} poem by T. S. Eliot, widely {{regarded}} as one of the most important poems of the 20th century and a central work of modernist poetry. Published in 1922, the 434-line poem first appeared in the United Kingdom in the October issue of The Criterion and in the United States in the November issue of The Dial. [...] It was published in book form in December 1922. Among its famous phrases are [...] "April is the cruellest month", [...] "I <b>will</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> fear in a handful of dust", and the mantra in the Sanskrit language [...] "Shantih shantih shantih".|$|E
6000|$|The lad formed {{his plan}} instantly. [...] "Come on, Hauskuld," [...] he shouted, with a wild laugh; [...] "I <b>will</b> <b>show</b> <b>thee</b> the outlet, {{and get out}} before thee too." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And now I <b>'ll</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> fun!" [...] said Prigio; and {{he asked}} them both to take their seats on the carpet, and wished {{to be in the}} valley of the Remora.|$|R

2500|$|Rabbi Nehemiah {{cited the}} use of the words [...] "will bring you out" [...] in [...] to {{demonstrate}} that using the word hamotzi in the blessing over bread would mean that God [...] "will bring forth" [...] bread from the land – not that God [...] "has brought forth" [...] bread from the land. Rabbi Nehemiah thus read [...] to mean: [...] "I am the Lord, the One Who will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians." [...] The Gemara reported that the Rabbis of a Baraita, however, read [...] to mean: [...] "When I shall bring you out, I will do for you something that <b>will</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> that I am the One Who brought you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians." ...|$|E
2500|$|Deputy District Attorney Stirling Norris, {{acting as}} prosecutor, sought {{the death penalty}} for each count of murder for which Bonin was tried, stating in his opening speech to the jury: [...] "We will prove he is the Freeway Killer, as he has bragged to a number of witnesses. We <b>will</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> that he enjoyed the killings. Not only did he enjoy it, and plan to enjoy it, he had an insatiable demand, an insatiable {{appetite}} - not only for sodomy, but for killing." [...] Norris further elaborated that Bonin had followed a depressingly familiar routine in his murders of luring or forcing his victim into the van, before overpowering and binding his victim. He would then repeatedly rape his captive between and throughout instances of torture, before finally reaching the [...] "climax of the orgy" [...] by killing his victim. Norris further asserted that Bonin considered murder a group sport, and would typically groom people of a low mentality to participate in many of his murders.|$|E
2500|$|... "Well, then," [...] said Master Chuang, [...] "there are {{the four}} {{schools of the}} Confucians, the Mohists, the Yangists, and the Pingists. Adding yours, master, it makes five. Which of you is {{actually}} right? Or may it be someone like Hasty Ninny ? His disciple said to him, 'I have attained your way, master. In winter I can light a cooking fire under a three-legged vessel and in summer I can make ice'. 'That's merely to attract [...] yang with yang and yin with yin'; said Hasty Ninny. 'It's not what I mean by the Way. I <b>will</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> my Way.' Thereupon he tuned two zithers. He placed {{one of them in}} the hall and the other in an inner chamber. When he plucked the note do [...] on one, do resonated [...] on the other, and when he plucked the note mi [...] on one, mi resonated [...] on the other. It's because their harmonies were the same. If he had retuned one of the strings so it didn't match any note in the pentatonic scale, and had then plucked it, all twenty-five strings on the other zither would have resonated [...] , not because there was any fundamental difference in the sound, but because it was the note that dominated all the rest. May it be that you thinkers are all like this?" [...] (23, tr. Mair 1994: 243) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And Peter the juggler <b>will</b> <b>show</b> <b>thee</b> {{how to make}} thy mule trot {{faster than}} thou canst lie, friend," [...] responded Peter's crier unabashed, [...] "and a mighty {{difficult}} task 'twill be, I'll warrant." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, then, sit {{up like a}} man, {{and wipe}} thine eyes; and, if thou art pleased with what I have done, I <b>will</b> <b>show</b> <b>thee</b> how thou mayst requite me in the highest degree." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Muslin, with {{pockets and}} tiny blue bows. I <b>'ll</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> how." [...] And forgetting her hate and {{contempt}} for dolls, down sat Fanny, soon getting as much absorbed as {{either of the}} others.|$|R
2500|$|I {{have had}} a most happy life and I want each one of {{you to have a}} happy life too. I believe that God put us in this jolly world to be happy and enjoy life. Happiness does not come from being rich, nor merely being {{successful}} in your career, nor by self-indulgence. One step towards happiness is to make yourself healthy and strong while you are a boy, so that you can be useful and so you can enjoy life when you are a man. Nature study <b>will</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> how full of beautiful and wonderful things God has made the world for you to enjoy. Be contented with what you have got and make the best of it. Look on the bright side of things instead of the gloomy one. But the real way to get happiness is by giving out happiness to other people. Try and leave this world a little better than you found it and when your turn comes to die, you can die happy in feeling that at any rate you have not wasted your time but have done your best. [...] "Be prepared" [...] in this way, to live happy and to die happy– stick to your Scout Promise always– even after you have ceased to be a boy– and God help you to do it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Come to me, and {{you shall}} know. I <b>will</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> in what narrow paths {{you have been}} wandering. I <b>will</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> how {{beautiful}} a woman's love can make your life!" ...|$|E

6000|$|Then Sir Launcelot laughed, and he said: [...] "Let be for {{a little}} while, and I <b>will</b> <b>show</b> <b>thee</b> {{how to get the}} plates of armor off." [...] And he said: [...] "How came this knight by his death." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thou art {{the first}} man," [...] said Zadok, [...] "who has seen what thou art {{about to see}} for seven-and-thirty years. Come, I <b>will</b> <b>show</b> <b>thee</b> a queen, the most {{beautiful}} that the eyes of man ever looked upon." ...|$|R
60|$|I <b>will</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> {{some reasons}} of the point, besides those five that I showed you before. And, First, I <b>will</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> why the poor, carnal, ignorant world miss of heaven; and then, Second, why the knowing professors miss of it also.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{you must}} come to Germany," [...] Madame Munster continued. [...] "I <b>will</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> how people can be talked about, and yet not seem to know it.

6000|$|... "You {{will come}} and see me to-morrow, will you not? Look, there is my house," [...] and {{she pointed to a}} large, white house {{opposite}} Leeuw Rock, that had a background of glossy foliage, and commanded a view of the sea. [...] "If you come, I <b>will</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> my beetles. And, if you care to come next day, I <b>will</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> my mummies." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That will we {{presently}} see," [...] quoth Robin, [...] "and meanwhile stand thou where thou art, or else, by {{the bright}} brow of Saint AElfrida, I <b>will</b> <b>show</b> <b>thee</b> right good Nottingham {{play with a}} clothyard shaft betwixt thy ribs." ...|$|R

"We <b>'ll</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> {{the sunny}} side {{of poverty and}} work, {{and that is a}} useful lesson for any one, Miss Mills says," [...] {{answered}} Polly, hoping that Fan would learn how much the poor can teach the rich, and what helpful friends girls may be to one another.|$|R
