5|$|The Four Kings {{were very}} popular in Cuba, and the Japanese media <b>were</b> <b>proud</b> of the {{reputation}} they were bringing to judo and Japan. Consequently, on January 8, 1912, the Kodokan promoted Maeda to 5th dan. There was some resistance to this decision because there were those in Japan who did not approve of his involvement in professional wrestling. In 1913, Tokugoro Ito stayed in Cuba while Maeda and Satake went to El Salvador, Costa Rica, Honduras, Panama, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. In El Salvador, the president was assassinated while Maeda was there, and in Panama, the Americans tried to pay him to lose; in response, they kept moving south. In Peru they met Laku, a Japanese jujutsuka who taught the military, and invited him to join them. They were then joined by Okura in Chile, and by Shimitsu in Argentina. The troupe arrived in Brazil on November 14, 1914.|$|E
5|$|TumbleSeed is an indie action video game, {{created by}} {{developer}} Benedict Fritz and designer Greg Wohlwend, {{in which the}} player balances a rolling seed on an ascending, horizontally slanted vine past procedurally generated obstacles {{to reach the top}} of a mountain. It is based on the mechanical arcade game Ice Cold Beer and built partially through the Cards Against Humanity game incubation program. TumbleSeed was released in May 2017 to generally favorable reviews on macOS, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Windows platforms. Critics, in particular, appreciated their haptic sense of the rolling seed from the Nintendo Switch's sensitive HD Rumble. Many reviewers noted TumbleSeed intense and sometimes uneven difficulty, which the developers hoped to address in a post-release update. They credited this stigma and a tepid critical reception for the game's slow sales, but <b>were</b> <b>proud</b> of their work.|$|E
5|$|Finally {{linked to}} the rest of the nation by rail, Denver prospered as a service and supply center. The young city grew during these years, {{attracting}} millionaires with their mansions, as well as the poverty and crime of a rapidly growing city. Denver citizens <b>were</b> <b>proud</b> when the rich chose Denver and were thrilled when Horace Tabor, the Leadville mining millionaire, built an impressive business block at 16th and Larimer as well as the elegant Tabor Grand Opera House. Luxurious hotels, including the much-loved Brown Palace Hotel, soon followed, as well as splendid homes for millionaires like the Croke, Patterson, Campbell Mansion at 11th and Pennsylvania and the now-demolished Moffat Mansion at 8th and Grant. Intent on transforming Denver into one of the world's great cities, leaders wooed industry and enticed laborers to work in these factories. Soon, in addition to the elite and a large middle class, Denver had a growing population of German, Italian, and Chinese laborers, soon followed by African-Americans and Spanish-surnamed workers. Unprepared for this influx, the Silver Crash of 1893 unsettled political, social, and economic balances, laying the foundation for ethnic bigotry, such as the Red Scare and the rise of the Ku Klux Klan, as well as corruption and crime.|$|E

25|$|The first ajaw, or king, of B'aakal {{that we know}} of was K'uk Balam (Quetzal Jaguar), who governed {{for four}} years {{starting}} in the year 431. After him, a king came to power, nicknamed Casper by archaeologists. The next two kings were probably Caspers sons. Little was known about the first of these, B'utz Aj Sak Chiik, until 1994, when a tablet was found describing a ritual for the king. The first tablet mentioned his successor Ahkal Mo' Naab I as a teenage prince, and therefore it is believed that there was a family relation between them. For unknown reasons, Akhal Mo' Naab I had great prestige, so the kings who succeeded him <b>were</b> <b>proud</b> to be his descendants.|$|E
25|$|Despite these {{limitations}} {{the women of}} Puerto Rico <b>were</b> <b>proud</b> of their homeland and helped defend it against foreign invaders. According to a popular Puerto Rican legend, when the British troops lay siege to San Juan, Puerto Rico, the night of April 30, 1797, the townswomen, led by a bishop, formed a rogativa (prayer procession) and marched throughout {{the streets of the}} city singing hymns, carrying torches, and praying for the deliverance of the City. Outside the walls, particularly from the sea, the British navy mistook this torch-lit religious parade for the arrival of Spanish reinforcements. When morning arrived, the British were gone from the island, and the city was saved from a possible invasion.|$|E

25|$|In total, 3,141 Canadian nurses volunteered their {{services}} for the Royal Canadian Army Medical Corps. Canadian nurses were the only nurses in the allied armies with the rank of officers and the resemblance of a hierarchical work structure. They <b>were</b> <b>proud</b> of their nursing ranks, reputation on the battlefield, and their distinct uniform. The Canadian nurses sported a familiar uniform consisted of blue dresses and white veils. The Sister Nurses were nicknamed “bluebirds” for the colour of their uniformed, and were identified {{as members of the}} Canadian Expeditionary Force and also as officers in their nursing units. Their uniforms were held in the highest regard and the nurses wore them with extreme pride, absolutely elated by the unity and importance it symbolized. Their pure white apron and shoulder-length veil gave them the look of nuns, or even angels. This linked the imagery of prior religious themes that had promoted authority and femininity and reinforced the ‘sister’ moniker.|$|E
