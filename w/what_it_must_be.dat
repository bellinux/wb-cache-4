500|$|Alejandro González Iñárritu was {{initially}} {{expected to be}} appointed as director, but film commitments later forced him {{to pull out of}} the project. Pizzolatto instead approached Cary Joji Fukunaga, who he knew from Anonymous Content, to take up the task. Fukunaga spent time conducting research with a homicide detective of the Louisiana State Police's Criminal Investigations Division in preparation for his services. Based on the officer's own personal experiences, the director was able to develop [...] "a nice sense of <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> like to be a detective in Louisiana—especially in that time period in the '90s, which was pre-cell phone, and technology was about to change the way we all live our lives. That's what I did. I'm not a big serial killer studier—I've never analyzed books about that kind of stuff and I've never really watched procedurals. Those parts of the story were the least attractive to me; I was doing it mainly for the characters." ...|$|E
500|$|Frank Provo of GameSpot {{reviewed}} the Wii Virtual Console release in 2007, citing the excellent graphics, sound, and general {{intensity of the}} game. He noted initial difficulty adjusting to the controls and game design. However, once accustomed, he said, [...] "you start totally feeling <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> {{like to be an}} army of one trading firepower with some of the universe's largest, most elaborate creatures. That's a great feeling." [...] Lucas M. Thomas of IGN noted the game's many similarities to Gunstar Heroes and recommended Alien Soldier to those who enjoyed it. [...] "Alien Soldier is a long-lost piece of Treasure's action gaming legacy," [...] said Thomas. [...] "It's got the fast-firing, high-energy, overly-explosive intensity that fans of the company have come to expect." [...] Darren Calvert of Nintendo Life described the graphics and animation as some of the best on the Mega Drive. He found the game difficult, but still enjoyable for fans of the run and gun genre. Dan Whitehead of Eurogamer described the game as [...] "manically-paced" [...] and [...] "bizarrely creative" [...] while also providing a disclaimer that it's [...] "really hectic and difficult if you're not into this sort of thing." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Coulomb {{friction}} [...] {{may take}} any value from zero up to , {{and the direction}} of the frictional force against a surface is opposite to the motion that surface would experience in the absence of friction. Thus, in the static case, the frictional force is exactly <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> in order to prevent motion between the surfaces; it balances the net force tending to cause such motion. In this case, rather than providing an estimate of the actual frictional force, the Coulomb approximation provides a threshold value for this force, above which motion would commence. This maximum force is known as traction.|$|E

2500|$|Quicksilver was {{originally}} {{presented as a}} mutant capable of moving and thinking at superhuman speeds. Originally capable of running {{at the speed of}} sound, exposure to the High Evolutionary's Isotope E made it possible for the character to run at supersonic speeds of up to Mach 10 and resist the effects of friction, reduced oxygen, and kinetic impact while moving at super-speeds. Also, he has a fast metabolism and can heal more rapidly than the average human. The character's speed allows him to perform such feats as creating cyclone-strength winds and running up walls or across bodies of water. Pietro's mind can perceive information with a photographic memory short term, becoming faster than the speed of thought, because he can shift his thoughts at a speed faster than normal thought. Also, he can cause vibrations in his body to transfer to solid material, and has superior agility and reflexes compared to other mutants. It has been revealed {{that one of the reasons}} for his abrasive and impatient personality is that it seems to him that the rest of the world is moving in slow motion and that he is constantly waiting for it to catch up. As he once explained, [...] "Have you ever had a day where you are at the ATM and you are in a hurry because you're running late but the person in front of you doesn't know how to use the ATM and they're taking forever? Now imagine <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> like to spend every day surrounded by people who don't know how to use the ATM." ...|$|E

50|$|Set in {{the year}} 2155 (2157 in some later versions), when {{children}} learn individually at home using a mechanical teacher, the story tells of eleven-year-old Margie Jones, whose neighbor Tommy finds a real book. The book tells about a time when children learned by age group in large schools that were not merely designated rooms in private houses as {{in the year}} 2157. Margie and Tommy discuss <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> have <b>been</b> like to study together with a real person as a teacher, and though at first Margie is skeptical about the notion, {{by the end of}} the story she daydreams about <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> have <b>been</b> like and 'the fun they had'.|$|R

60|$|If {{such was}} the state of Nanny's mind {{as early as the}} end of August, when this {{dialogue}} with Mr. Tomms occurred, you may imagine <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> have <b>been</b> by the beginning of November, and that at that time a very slight spark might any day cause the long-smouldering anger to flame forth in open indignation.|$|R
60|$|Happily, in the {{pictures}} of Gentile Bellini, the fresco coloring of the Gothic palaces is recorded, as it still remained in his time; not with rigid accuracy, but quite distinctly enough to enable us, by comparing it with the existing colored designs in the manuscripts and glass of the period, to ascertain precisely <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> have <b>been.</b>|$|R
