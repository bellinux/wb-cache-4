2500|$|The Paalson Type 1 was {{a wooden}} {{aircraft}} with flying surfaces and fuselage covered in 3-ply plywood. [...] Its wings were unswept and of constant chord, the lower wing having a shorter span and mounted with marked stagger.

2500|$|The {{fuselage}} is a flat-sided <b>Warren</b> <b>girder</b> structure, plywood covered {{apart from}} the curved glass fibre rear decking. [...] Wing attachment involves some aluminium fittings. The single seat cockpit is ahead of the wing leading edge under a single piece canopy. [...] All 460 series aircraft use a fixed, unsprung monowheel main undercarriage. [...] On the first four prototypes at least, this was mounted below the fuselage in a fairing which exposed only {{the edge of the}} wheel. [...] On the 463s, the wheel is unfaired but assisted by an integral skid. [...] The 465s have no skid and the wheel mounting is instead raised into the fuselage. [...] All have a tail bumper with a [...] "roller skate" [...] tailwheel.|$|E
2500|$|The Nimrod's {{fuselage}} was a <b>Warren</b> <b>girder</b> {{structure of}} tubular steel and aluminium, surrounded by stringers which defined its oval cross section. [...] The Rolls-Royce F.9MS engine, later renamed the KestrelIIMS was closely cowled in aluminium {{and the rest}} of the fuselage fabric covered. [...] As with the Fury, the upper fuselage line was highest at the cockpit, placed between the trailing edges of the upper and lower planes. Its twin machine guns were mounted in the upper fuselage between pilot and engine, firing through the propeller using the standard interrupter gear. The tailplane was mounted on top of the fuselage and carried split horn balanced elevators; the vertical tail had Hawker's familiar curved shape, with a deep, wide chord, unbalanced rudder extending to the keel.|$|E
5000|$|The W-100's {{fuselage}} frame was constructed from steel tube <b>Warren</b> <b>girders,</b> {{resulting in an}} essentially rectangular section structure which was largely fabric covered. There was a [...] nine cylinder Hispano-Suiza 9Va radial engine (a licence-built Wright R-1820) in the nose under a long-chord cowling. The pilot's open cockpit was at the wing trailing edge, with the gunner's cockpit, fitted with a machine gun on a flexible mount, immediately behind. A triangular, upward hinged door in the starboard side below the gunner's cockpit gave access to the observer's position in the deepened forward fuselage between the pilot's cockpit and the engine. It had glazed panels in its top and bottom and entirely glazed sides, giving the observer clear views in all directions.|$|R
50|$|The viaduct was {{designed}} by Thomas Bouch and the ironwork was supplied and erected by Gilkes Wilson; both Bouch and Gilkes Wilson were also responsible for the later Tay Bridge. It had 'double' <b>Warren</b> truss <b>girders</b> on cast iron columns, and was constructed {{at a cost of}} Â£31,630. The foundation stone was laid in November 1857.|$|R
5000|$|In 1931 two {{embankments}} were built. A long, shallow one {{alongside the}} down Bristol line between Durston railway station and Cogload; and a shorter, steeper one alongside the down Castle Cary line to bring trains back to ground level before the line passes beneath the road bridge at Charlton, {{a short distance}} east of the junction. Between the two embankments is a large steel <b>Warren</b> truss <b>girder</b> bridge.|$|R
2500|$|The Pike used mixed construction, but {{its wings}} were wooden, fabric covered. They were without sweep and had equal span and {{constant}} chord, though the lower wing was noticeably narrower than the upper one. [...] There were ailerons {{only on the}} upper wing. [...] The wings together were unusual in having slight backward stagger and in being interconnected as a <b>Warren</b> <b>girder</b> with no bracing wires. [...] Thus, seen from the front the left hand wing had pairs of struts of elongated and slightly distorted N form, one behind the other, attached to the two wing spars. [...] The wings were fixed directly {{to the bottom and}} top of the fuselage, the upper wing narrowing significantly close to the root to assist visibility from the cockpits. [...] Since the Pike was intended for ship-borne use, the wings folded alongside the fuselage.|$|E
2500|$|The {{fuselage}} {{was built}} up on four longerons, spruce {{at the rear}} where they were linked into a tapering <b>Warren</b> <b>girder,</b> and ash ahead of the rear cockpit where more traditional wire braced rectangular forms were used. [...] It was topped with a standard rounded decking. [...] The two open cockpits were placed at the leading and trailing [...] upper wing edges and fitted with dual controls. [...] The [...] flat twin Bristol Cherub III was mounted on a steel plate and smoothly partially cowled to a neatly pointed nose, but with the cylinder heads exposed for cooling. [...] At {{the rear of the}} fuselage the fin and tailplane were fabric covered metal structures, though the generous control surfaces were wood framed. [...] Fin and rudder together formed a shape not unlike that of many de Havilland aircraft though more rounded and unbalanced. [...] The main undercarriage was built from a pair of steel V-shaped tubes bearing a single axle and rubber cord shock absorbers.|$|E
2500|$|The {{wings of}} the Hippie are high set with {{noticeable}} positive dihedral. They are unswept, with constant chord and have small end-plate fairings at the tips. [...] They are built from glass and carbon reinforced plastics, with plastic skins and braced to the lower fuselage with a single strut on each side. [...] Glass and carbon reinforced plastics are used throughout the Hippie: the forward fuselage is a glass-fibre ring, mounted under the wing, which incorporates a windscreen, the pilot's seat and a small keel underneath which acts as the main undercarriage. Aft, there is an open, tapering <b>Warren</b> <b>girder</b> which carries the fabric-covered tail unit. [...] The {{leading edge of the}} fin is formed from an extended diagonal fuselage member, with a vertical piece behind to support the rudder. The Hippie has a T-tail with a wire braced tailplane on top of the fin. [...] There is a small loop tailskid {{at the bottom of the}} rudder post.|$|E
2500|$|The {{rectangular}} cross-section fuselage consisted of four spruce <b>Warren</b> <b>girders,</b> fabric covered behind the engine. [...] The pilot's cockpit {{was at the}} trailing edge of the wing and behind there was a deep, rounded fabric covered decking. [...] Immediately in front of the pilot's cockpit was an extra fuselage bay containing the passenger's position, placed over the centre of gravity so that the trim would not be disturbed by their presence or absence. [...] The fuel tanks of the Kite were in the wing roots, again to minimise changes in trim. [...] The mounting for the Pobjoy Niagara engine, constructed of square section steel tube, started immediately in front of the passenger compartment. [...] The 90hp (67kW) 7-cylinder radial engine was a development of the earlier Pobjoy R; [...] two notable features were that it was very compact, with a diameter of only 26 in (660mm) and that it was geared down with a gearbox that off-set the propeller shaft vertically. [...] The result was a very neat cowling with Pobjoy's characteristic front ring and trade mark baffle. [...] The exhaust exited from shallow individual cowls and scooped channels. [...] The Pobjoy drove a two-bladed propeller.|$|R
50|$|The {{rectangular}} cross-section fuselage consisted of four spruce <b>Warren</b> <b>girders,</b> fabric covered behind the engine. The cockpit {{was at the}} trailing edge of the wing and behind there was a deep, rounded fabric covered decking. In front of the cockpit the decking was continued in aluminium, enclosing the fuel tank. Forward of this and beyond a firewall, the inverted in-line engine was mounted on a frame of square section steel members. It drove a two bladed metal propeller. Comper was an early adopter of retractable undercarriages for light aircraft {{at a time when the}} balance of advantage between drag loss and weight penalty was not obvious. The main wheels of the Streak were mounted at the end of the wing centre section, each between pairs of compression legs. Pairs of cross braced struts, joining the legs a little way above the axle and hinged at top and bottom, rotated to retract the wheels rearwards. In common with many aircraft of the time, the retracted undercarriage left a part of the wheel exposed, to give some protection in a wheels up landing. The wheels, which had brakes, were retracted manually via a heavily geared down, bicycle chain drive. At the rear there was a simple, sprung tailskid.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Warren</b> type <b>girder</b> {{replaces the}} solid web {{with an open}} {{latticework}} between the flanges. This truss arrangement combines strength with economy of materials and can therefore be relatively light. Patented in 1848 by its designers James Warren and Willoughby Theobald Monzani, its structure consists of longitudinal members joined only by angled cross-members, forming alternately inverted equilateral triangle-shaped spaces along its length, ensuring that no individual strut, beam, or tie is subject to bending or torsional straining forces, but only to tension or compression. It is an improvement over the Neville truss which uses a spacing configuration of isosceles triangles.|$|R
2500|$|Like the H.P.42, the H.P.43 was an unequal-span biplane with unswept and unstaggered {{wings of}} {{constant}} chord. [...] Both used a <b>Warren</b> <b>girder</b> biplane construction, with {{two pairs of}} strongly outward-leaning struts linked by an inward-leaning pair on each wing. [...] This layout avoided the need for bracing wires. [...] Both types had dihedral on upper and lower outer wing sections, combined with marked anhedral in the centre section of the lower wing, a feature that optimised {{the view from the}} passenger aircraft because the wing was attached {{to the top of the}} fuselage and kept the single-wheeled undercarriage legs, mounted at the end of the centre section, short and widetrack. The lower pair of engines were also mounted at this point, on top of the wing. [...] Both types carried ailerons and leading edge slots on the upper wing only. [...] In contrast, not only did the H.P.43 have a smaller span (114ft compared with 130ft on the H.P.42) but the upper and lower planes had nearly equal chord, unlike the sesquiplane H.P.42. The H.P.43's third Bristol Pegasus IM3 radial engine was mounted centrally on the upper wing with bracing to the upper fuselage longerons.|$|E
50|$|The {{fuselage}} was {{a standard}} Blackburn <b>Warren</b> <b>girder</b> structure, though of square {{rather than the}} company's previously favoured triangular cross-section. The decking was rounded. While the tailplane was {{like that of the}} Improved Type I, the fin and rudder formed a neat triangular shape with a vertical trailing edge.|$|E
50|$|The {{aircraft}} were of wood-and-fabric construction, {{the fuselage}} being four longerons-strutted {{in the fashion}} of a <b>Warren</b> <b>girder.</b> The wing had two box spars with Warren truss ribs. Initially the two aircraft were powered, one by an Anzani, and the other by an ABC Scorpion (both opposed twin-cylinder engines). In 1926 the engines in both Cygnets were changed to the Bristol Cherub III, another twin-cylinder engine. The airframe weighed a remarkably low 270 lb, and its weight when empty was only 373 lb.|$|E
50|$|The {{aircraft}} was a canard configuration monoplane whose structure made {{extensive use of}} a beam design patented by Fabre. This was a <b>Warren</b> truss <b>girder</b> with all members having a streamlined section. Two of these beams, one above the other and connected by three substantial struts, formed the fuselage of the aircraft. The wing, which had pronounced dihedral and whose leading edge was formed by an exposed Fabre beam, was mounted below {{the rear of the}} upper beam, and the Gnome Omega rotary engine driving a two-bladed pusher ChauviÃ¨re propeller was mounted behind it. Additional bracing for the wings was provided by kingposts extending down from the leading edge at mid-span. There were two small foreplanes, which, like the wing, had exposed Fabre beams forming their leading edges, one mounted above the upper beam and the second on the strut connecting the two beams. A rectangular rear-mounted rudder was situated above the wing: below the wing there was a similar rectangular fixed surface extending down to the lower fuselage beam. The pilot sat astride the upper fuselage beam. The {{aircraft was}} equipped with three broad floats: one {{at the front of the}} aircraft, the other two mounted on struts extending down from the wing.|$|R
40|$|Bridges offer great {{potential}} {{for the use of}} high strength steel grades (HSS). The main advantages are generally a result of reduced weight and cross-sectional dimensions. Design stresses can be increased and plate thickness may be reduced, resulting in significant weight savings. Reduced plate thickness can also save on welding costs as well as on fabrication, erection and transportation costs. Simplified structural components and construction techniques are often possible, particularly for large structures, and foundation costs may also be reduced due to lower dead weight. High strength steels can be delivered as quenched and tempered (Q&T) or as thermo-mechanically controlled processed (TMPC). In the first case, high strengths can be achieved with minimum yield strength up to 1100 MPa, which can lead to considerable weight savings, while in the second case moderate strengths (min yield strength up to 500 MPa) accompanied with excellent weldability are possible. Especially quenched and tempered high strength steels may offer big weight savings when used for bridges. However, quenching and tempering production method poses limitations to the product length. The most economical and efficient use of Q&T steels is in members stressed in tension where the high strength can be fully exploited, and in projects where dead load is predominant (e. g. long span bridges). In compression they are most effective in heavily loaded, stocky columns or in stiffened compression elements where buckling is not the controlling criterion. Furthermore, hybrid steel girders are more economical than homogeneous girders. Hybrid steel girders are welded girders with different steel grades in flanges and web (usually high strength steel for the flanges, e. g. S 550 or S 690 and mild steel grades for the web, e. g. S 355). Higher steel grades (e. g. S 690) are usually applied in steel members and/or in bridge regions with very high static stresses {{in order to reduce the}} cross sectional dimensions and plate thicknesses of these members. As a result the overall steel self-weight of the bridge will be reduced leading to a more economical design in comparison to the case where the same (equivalent) design is made out of mild steels (e. g. S 355) only. This study aims to present the potential advantages that high strength steels (HSS) have to offer in case of bridges, but also possible disadvantages. Special attention is being paid to high strength steel grades up to S 700 (700 MPa minimum yield strength) in quenched and tempered condition as they are expected to offer maximum weight savings. This thesis is divided into two main parts (Part 1 and Part 2) : In Part 1, a literature survey is initially performed (Part 1 A) based on scientific documentation and relevant sites found on the Internet. Its purpose is to collect information from previous studies, experimental projects and fabricators, utilizing HSS for application in bridges, around the world. Then in Part 1 B, a long span (L= 105 m) roadway bridge is chosen as a case study (the âSchellingwouderbrugâ in the Netherlands) and preliminary designs for three bridge types are presented (a single box <b>girder</b> bridge, a <b>warren</b> type truss <b>girder</b> bridge and arch girder bridge with vertical hangers). High strength steel S 690 with minimum fy = 690 MPa is applied in members with very high stresses (e. g. chord members in the truss bridge) and S 355 everywhere else (hybrid design concept). The design criteria that have been studied are strength, stability and fatigue. In Part 2, the preliminary design alternatives are compared on a cost basis (based on calculated steel self-weight and required maximum plate thicknesses) and one is chosen and designed in more detail. It is then checked, by estimating total costs, whether the hybrid design with high strength steel grade S 690 will lead to a more economical bridge solution in comparison to an equivalent homogeneous (completely out of S 355 steel grade) bridge design. European standards have been used throughout the whole design phase. Comparing costs between the two hybrid alternative designs (for the same bridge type) and their equivalent homogeneous designs, it has been found that the developed hybrid designs (combination of S 355 and S 690) for the âSchellingwouderbrugâ, result in significant weight savings in comparison to their equivalent homogeneous (only S 355) bridge designs (even up to 65 % in some cases). The high price for S 690 (currently ? 70 - 75 % more expensive than S 355) leads to higher material costs (up to 4 % higher) for the hybrid designs. Nevertheless, the weight reduction in hybrid designs has a positive impact on the reduction of total costs (up to 6 % lower) including fabrication, transportation, erection and maintenance costs.

50|$|Its wing {{was built}} around two box spars with <b>Warren</b> <b>girder</b> ribs. The Mureaux was {{intended}} to operate at high altitudes, so the wing had a high aspect ratio for its time and used a thin wing section of Brunet's own design. In plan it was unswept, with constant chord, semi-circular tips and a rounded cut-out in the trailing edge over the forward cockpit. Ailerons occupied {{the whole of the}} trailing edge; they could be used differentially for roll control or together as camber changing flaps for landing.|$|E
50|$|Attached {{immediately}} {{behind the}} single open cockpit headrest at the forward wing spar, the nacelle extended rearwards {{only to the}} wing trailing edge, suspended from an inverted V pair of struts to the rear spar. A landing skid extended {{over most of the}} length of the nacelle. Aft of the nacelle, the fuselage was an uncovered converging <b>Warren</b> <b>girder</b> structure carrying the tail surfaces and braced laterally by wires to the mid-span wing points. The fin was very small but carried an almost rectangular rudder which extended to the fuselage keel via a cut-out in the elevators. The tailplane was straight tapered, with a swept leading edge. A wire tail bumper completed the undercarriage.|$|E
50|$|The LeO H-10 (H for hydravion or waterplane) was a two-seat {{floatplane}} {{designed for}} reconnaissance work from Naval vessels. It was an unstaggered biplane with unswept wings of constant chord {{that could be}} folded for ease of onboard stowage. The interplane strut arrangement was unusual: outboard, there were conventional upright pairs but just inboard of these another pair ran diagonally in <b>Warren</b> <b>girder</b> style, replacing the conventional flying wires. The lower wing folded at a rear hinge on a short stub wing; outboard of the break was a single vertical strut. Central cabane struts provided an upper hinge so the wings, with their trailing edges folded downwards, leaned inwards over the fuselage when stowed.|$|E

The design bears a resemblance to the Swallow aircraft, partially from manager Victor Roos prior history with the company. Structure was standard for its day:- welded steel tube <b>warren</b> <b>girder</b> fuselage with spruce spars and basswood ribs for the wings. With the ubiquitous Curtiss OX-5 the PT proved quite versatile and able to perform basic aerobatic manoeuvers without too much effort. It was awarded ATC no 181 in July 1929.|$|E

50|$|The wing had a two-spar fabric covered {{structure}} and was completely rectangular in plan. Ailerons occupied approximately â {{of the outer}} trailing edge. The wing was mounted on the horizontal upper beam of the three-bay fuselage <b>Warren</b> <b>girder.</b> The lower beam, angled slightly upwards rearwards, carried the pilot's seat and controls at its forward end.

Pairs of landing wires ran from a longitudinally-orientated inverted V-shaped pylon above {{the centre of the}} upper wing to the two spars near the inboard edge of the aileron. Similarly arranged flying wires ran from the same wing points to the keel. Bracing wires from the rear spar, at the same point as the flying wires, were anchored to the lower rear corner of the flat fuselage girder to limit sideways flexing.|$|E
50|$|The two-spar wing had a {{straight}} leading edge and constant chord {{out to a}} little over half span, where the trailing edges of the ailerons, hinged at a slight angle to the spar, curved inwards to the wingtips. It was braced from above with pairs of wires from the spars to a central, inverted V-strut pylon and below by wires to the lower nacelle longerons. There were no flaps or air brakes. The central wing rib was continued rearward with the upper member of the open, flat, converging <b>Warren</b> <b>girder</b> fuselage, whose lower member joined the keel of the plywood- and fabric-covered nacelle just aft of the wing trailing edge. This placed the open single cockpit just forward of the wing leading edge. A central keel skid formed the main undercarriage, with assistance from a tail bumper. A narrow-span, triangular tailplane, wire braced above and below, carried longer-span elevators with rounded tips and a cut-out for the deep, rounded rudder hinged to small, triangular fin.|$|E
50|$|The {{wings of}} the Hippie are high set with {{noticeable}} positive dihedral. They are unswept, with constant chord and have small end-plate fairings at the tips. They are built from glass and carbon reinforced plastics, with plastic skins and braced to the lower fuselage with a single strut on each side. Glass and carbon reinforced plastics are used throughout the Hippie: the forward fuselage is a glass-fibre ring, mounted under the wing, which incorporates a windscreen, the pilot's seat and a small keel underneath which acts as the main undercarriage. Aft, there is an open, tapering <b>Warren</b> <b>girder</b> which carries the fabric-covered tail unit.

50|$|Their {{contender}} {{became known}} as the B-7 after the Class B marking it carried and lacking an old-style Blackburn-type number. It was built on the Shark production line and had much in common with it. The Shark had introduced a new wing construction to Blackburn, each wing having two outward slanting (at about 45Â°, rather than vertical), slightly distorted N-type struts linked by a single strut from the lower front to upper rear spars. As a result of this <b>Warren</b> <b>girder</b> structure, few bracing wires compared to past practice were needed. The wings were slightly staggered and swept and had the same span and much smaller lower wing as the Shark. Unlike the Shark the wings did not fold; another significant difference was that wing area was increased to enhance the load carrying performance by increasing the chord. The B-7 shared with the Shark the semi-monocoque aluminium-clad watertight fuselage first seen on the M.1/30A and the divided main undercarriage necessitated by the torpedo-dropping role.|$|E
5000|$|The {{fuselage}} {{was built}} up on four longerons, spruce {{at the rear}} where they were linked into a tapering <b>Warren</b> <b>girder,</b> and ash ahead of the rear cockpit where more traditional wire braced rectangular forms were used.

5000|$|The Courier was {{powered by}} a [...] de Havilland Gipsy III, a four {{cylinder}} air-cooled inverted inline engine, driving a two-bladed propeller. Its oil-cooler was placed under the engine where, in winter, engine heat could keep the oil fluid.

Mail was contained within a [...] compartment immediately behind the engine with a weight limit of 250 lb. An open but heated cockpit was placed aft of the trailing edge, the pilot's upward vision enhanced by the short chord centre-section. At the rear, tailplane and elevators, nearly rectangular in plan, were mounted {{on top of the}} fuselage. The Courier could be trimmed by adjusting the angle of incidence of the tailplane. The fin and rudder were tall and rounded; the latter extended down to the keel and worked in a cut-out between the elevators.|$|E
50|$|Like the H.P.42, the H.P.43 was an unequal-span biplane with unswept and unstaggered {{wings of}} {{constant}} chord. Both used a <b>Warren</b> <b>girder</b> biplane construction, with {{two pairs of}} strongly outward-leaning struts linked by an inward-leaning pair on each wing. This layout avoided the need for bracing wires. Both types had dihedral on upper and lower outer wing sections, combined with marked anhedral in the centre section of the lower wing, a feature that optimised {{the view from the}} passenger aircraft because the wing was attached {{to the top of the}} fuselage and kept the single-wheeled undercarriage legs, mounted at the end of the centre section, short and widetrack. The lower pair of engines were also mounted at this point, on top of the wing. Both types carried ailerons and leading edge slots on the upper wing only. In contrast, not only did the H.P.43 have a smaller span (114 ft compared with 130 ft on the H.P.42) but the upper and lower planes had nearly equal chord, unlike the sesquiplane H.P.42. The H.P.43's third Bristol Pegasus IM3 radial engine was mounted centrally on the upper wing with bracing to the upper fuselage longerons.|$|E
5000|$|The {{rear part}} of the {{fuselage}} was a <b>Warren</b> <b>girder</b> based on four longerons, tapering towards the tail. The fuselage cross section was {{kept to a minimum}} to reduce drag and to this end the pilot sat on the cockpit floor. [...] There were concerns about ease of escape from this position under the rear wing spar, but it was after all, a racing machine. In front of him the structure was wire braced, the longerons converging to become overhung engine bearers. [...] The 32 hp (24 kW) Bristol Cherub II engine was mounted on a plate with a fireproof bulkhead, within a long, smooth aluminium cowling blended into the spinner of the two-bladed propeller. The Cherub's cylinder heads were exposed for cooling. A rounded decking, built up with stringers in the usual way, topped the fuselage from propeller to stern and contained the 4.5 imp gal tank immediately in front of the cockpit, high enough above the engine to allow it to be gravity fed. The overall fin plus rudder shape was not unlike the de Havilland form, though the rudder was not balanced. The tailplane had a straight leading edge inboard, then curved; it could be adjusted in incidence on the ground but not in the air. [...] Its elevators were unbalanced and divided to allow rudder movement. The undercarriage was a simple single axle design using rubber shock absorbers, with the main legs attached to the lower longerons at the same points as the lift struts and braced to the most forward fuselage frame. It was completed with a tail skid.|$|E
5000|$|From The Cornwall Chronicle, April 23, 1870: [...] "The Longford iron bridge {{has been}} {{constructed}} and erected under contract by Mr. C. de Borgue from designs {{prepared by the}} company's engineers, Messrs. Doyne, Major, and Willett. It is on the principle known as the double <b>Warren</b> <b>girder,</b> and consists of two spans, each of 200 ft. The girder is continuous, fixed in the centre but expanding and contracting at both ends, upon an apparatus invented by Mr. Doyne. The girders are of lattice work, formed by building at top and bottom, strings of plate iron 2 ft wide on the bottom, and 2 ft deep. These are connected together by vertical and diagonal bars, the vertical bars being placed 14 ft apart, and the diagonals crossed between these. The size {{of each of these}} bars is arranged according to its position in the bridge, and in exact proportion to the amount of work it is to perform, a much smaller bar being used in tho centre than at the ends of each span. The top and bottom strings, on the contrary are much stronger in the centre than at the ends. The space between the upper and lower strings is 19 ft. The two main girders are connected together by cross girders at every 14 ft, and upon these are rivetted the beams which carry the permanent rails. The cross girders are rivetted to the sides of the lower strings, and the top strings arc connected by strong angle irons, thus giving great stability to the whole structure, which represents, in section, a square of 20 ft. A feature in this Bridge {{is the fact that the}} rivet holes instead of being punched as is the ordinary process, have all been drilled as true as a gun barrel; the consequence being that not a single hole required alteration, even where two or three plates had to be bolted together. The rivets were all made to fit the holes cold, and as they were put in at a red heat, and driven up by means of a circular steel cap, they all fit- as tight as though the holes had been rammed with some soft substance. Hence the extreme rigidity and elasticity of the structure. The ends of the bridge are to be set off by four massive fluted columns of cast iron, having handsome basements, and relieved by ornamental capitals, and over the centre also is a massive ornamental casting, which will agreeably break the line and relieve the appearance of the structure. These are the only pieces of ornamentation in which tho engineers have indulged. The height of the bridge and of the viaduct immediately beyond were both deter mined after a careful survey of the country and the most minute enquiries respecting the various flood levels. The bridge is now 2 feet 6 inch cm clear above the level of the highest recorded flood, and as it offers no impediment whatever to the passage of the waters, it is regarded almost as an everlasting structure. The abutments and centre pier are not yet quite complete, inasmuch as they have to be built up to the sides of the bridge, but the brick work and masonry of which they are composed, is very massive. They are sixteen feet thick, and stand upon a foundation of stiff clay. We are informed that a bed of cement concrete was laid 1 ft thick, upon which the brickwork was commenced. The average depth of the concrete bed from the surface of the ground is 26 feet m, so that the foundations are imbedded 27 ft or more below the river level. The abutments and piers are composed of brick, with ponderous blocks of hard blue stone, dove-tailed together under the girders, with quoins, caps, and copings of freestone quarried in the immediate neighbourhood, of the quality of which the engineers speak very highly. We have referred above to an apparatus invented by Mr. Doyne, the object of which is to supply a means of compensation for the expansion or contraction in tho length of long iron girders, produced by variations of temperature and also to remove the pounding of the girder upon its support, caused by tho uudulatory motion produced in the girder by the passage of a heavy load. This has hitherto been effected by means more or less imperfect, and it is believed that this invention will prove a great improvement upon those which have hitherto been in use. The apparatus consists of a cast-iron circular plate seven feet in diameter and four inches in thickness, which rests on the top of the abutment. From the upper surface of this plate, five vertical ribs or jaws project upwards to the height of one foot nine inches. They are three inches in thickness and ten inches apart, running along the plate, in the direction of the girder, for its whole diameter. The upper edges of these ribs are grooved across the line of the girder, and in these grooves there rests a cast-steel turned pin 5 ftlong, and three inches in diameter. From this pin two steel links depend between each pair of ribs, making eight in number : they are three inches square, and are furnished with eyes at each end three inches in diameter, and bushed with brass. They are 16 inch cm long from centre to centre of the eyes, and hang nearly touching the ribs on one side, and leaving a space of nearly three inches between them on the other. This completes the description of the lower or abutment member of the apparatus. The upper girder member is nearly similar, but inverted; its plate, instead of being circular, is oblong. The ribs are four in number, and project downwards. They are placed between the links with the grooves opposite to the eyes. Through these, and through the eyes, a steel pin similar to the one described passes. Thus, the lower portion of the upper member is suspended from the upper portion of the lower member. The girder rests upon the iron plate, and as it increases or diminishes in length, through changes of temperature, it pushes forward or draws backward the whole upper member, causing it to swing freely on the suspending links, as if it rested on the tray of an ordinary swing. There is also a third motion, which takes place in the girders, which must be provided for in the bearings on the abutments, or serious vibration is produced. It is the undulatory or wave motion, produced by the changing deflections of the girders under the action of a moving load, which causes the ends of the girders to rock on their bearings. This motion is also perfectly provided for by Mr Doyne's apparatus, as the plate, on which the girder rests rolls freely on the lower pin, and thus destroys all pounding action on the abutment plate. It will be seen that when longitudinal expansion or contraction takes place in the girder, the lower pin moves forwards and backwards through the ribs of the lower member, and consequently the holes in these arc so formed as to give free play to this motion; they are of a radial oblong form, which has been termed [...] "balanoidal," [...] or bean-shaped." ...|$|E
