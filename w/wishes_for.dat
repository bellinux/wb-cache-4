5|$|Along with {{offering}} {{emotional support}} {{to both the}} patient and family, palliative care serves {{an important role in}} addressing goals of care. People with Parkinson's may have many difficult decisions to make as the disease progresses such as <b>wishes</b> <b>for</b> feeding tube, non-invasive ventilator, and tracheostomy; <b>wishes</b> <b>for</b> or against cardiopulmonary resuscitation; and when to use hospice care. Palliative care team members can help answer questions and guide people with Parkinson's on these complex and emotional topics to help them make the best decision based on their own values.|$|E

30|$|Among psychosocial variables, {{the age of}} {{patients}} is important <b>for</b> the <b>wish</b> <b>for</b> CRS. Younger ones more often longed for CRS [56], and additionally, the chance of survival is higher as Goldenberg et al. confirmed in 2009 [57]. After pension, the need for CRS is decreasing, unless it is a premature pension due to the diagnosis of cancer. In this last named case, {{there was a very}} strong <b>wish</b> <b>for</b> CRS. Furthermore, patients without partner more often <b>wished</b> <b>for</b> CRS. Some literature describes the coherence of <b>wish</b> <b>for</b> CRS and impairments as, for example, nutrition. Liquid diet increases the <b>wish</b> <b>for</b> further CRS [58, 59]. Equally, pain and hypaesthesia are important <b>for</b> the <b>wish</b> <b>for</b> CRS. Both strongly influence the description of the emotional and functional situation by the patient, yet {{we were not able to}} prove a relation to the <b>wish</b> <b>for</b> CRS.|$|R

5|$|Leslie takes {{possession}} of the jinniyah and asks for his brother {{to be returned to}} life. Anson is returned, but in a decaying state, complete with injuries from the crash. Leslie's second wish is for Anson to talk, which results in Anson screaming {{at the top of his}} lungs and telling his brother that he is cold. Back at the morgue, Scully finds the body has disappeared and Mulder suspects it is because of Leslie's wish. They go to the Stokes residence and Anson blows the house up trying to light the stove in an attempt to warm up. Mulder questions Jenn, the jinniyah, who says she's 500 years old. According to her, she gained her powers after wishing for great power and long life from another genie. She also says that Mulder unrolled her so he now has three wishes of his own. Mulder <b>wishes</b> <b>for</b> peace on earth and she wipes out the entire human population. With his second wish, Mulder undoes his first wish. Mulder then writes down his third wish to be very specific. However, just before making the final wish, Scully helps Mulder realize that the power of a genie should not be used to force people to be good, and so he ultimately <b>wishes</b> <b>for</b> Jenn to be free.|$|E
5|$|The {{episodes of}} the Japanese anime {{television}} series Ah! My Goddess are directed by Hiroaki Gōda, animated by Anime International Company, and produced by Tokyo Broadcasting System (TBS) and Kodansha.

60|$|He mounted his three-legged {{stool and}} away he {{flew through the}} air until he had come again to the tavern where he was lodging. There he sat him down and began to churn his thoughts, and the butter he made was worth the having, I can tell you. He <b>wished</b> <b>for</b> a grand palace of white marble, and then he <b>wished</b> <b>for</b> {{all sorts of things}} to fill it--the finest that could be had. Then he <b>wished</b> <b>for</b> {{servants}} in clothes of gold and silver, and then he <b>wished</b> <b>for</b> fine horses and gilded coaches. Then he <b>wished</b> <b>for</b> gardens and orchards and lawns and flower-plats and fountains, and all kinds and sorts of things, until the sweat ran down his face from hard thinking and wishing. And as he thought and wished, all the things he thought and <b>wished</b> <b>for</b> grew up like soap-bubbles from nothing at all.|$|R

But {{what she did}} not tell him was to be careful what he <b>wished</b> <b>for.</b> Luv kumar not knowing this <b>wished</b> <b>for</b> a lot of girl friends. That’s how the story starts. The film is told as an autobiographical narrative {{in the voice of}} Luv Kumar.|$|R
5|$|The simpler {{roots of}} designs in Generation I {{prompted}} greater complexity in later games. Designs, in general, {{have become increasingly}} complex and thematic in newer games. Sneasel, for example, draws inspiration from the Japanese yōkai kamaitachi, mythical creatures with fast, razor-sharp claws that hunt in packs. These elements are all found in Sneasel's design and characteristics. New Pokémon introduced in Generation VI, for example, are heavily influenced by the culture and fauna of Europe (namely France). However, by the release of X and Y in 2013, Sugimori stated he <b>wishes</b> <b>for</b> Pokémon design {{to return to the}} simpler roots of the franchise.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{returning}} to England, Strange finds {{that one of}} Norrell's men, socialite Christopher Drawlight, has been stealing money from eager English citizens with prospects of fulfilling their wishes through Strange's magic. Drawlight disappears and is arrested by his former friend, Henry Lascelles. Norrell strongly <b>wishes</b> <b>for</b> Drawlight to be hanged for his crime, but Strange disagrees. Lascelles starts to become closer to Norrell, challenging the relationship between Childermass and his master.|$|E
5|$|Believing the German {{attacks on}} 29 June {{indicated}} more counter-attacks {{for the following}} day, Dempsey reinforced the Odon bridgehead with a brigade of the 43rd division and pulled in its perimeter. The 159th Infantry Brigade of the 11th Armoured Division was placed {{under the command of}} the 15th (Scottish) Infantry Division and acceding to O’Connor’s <b>wishes</b> <b>for</b> additional infantry, Dempsey attached the newly arrived 53rd (Welsh) Infantry Division to VIII Corps; the lead brigade arrived near the Epsom start line during the night. To hold Hill 112, it was necessary hold Évrecy and Hill 113 for which there were insufficient troops and Dempsey ordered the 29th Armoured Brigade to abandon the hill. To hold the area between Rauray and the Odon, Dempsey withdrew the 29th Armoured Brigade north across the river after dark, ready for the expected German offensive.|$|E
30|$|Of {{the three}} factors, only factor 1 shows {{significant}} differences between the groups which varyingly strong <b>wish</b> <b>for</b> CRS (N =  410): Patients with increasing <b>wish</b> <b>for</b> CRS more often react internal.|$|R

5|$|Dr. Ariel Hanson is a {{scientist}} who becomes associated with Raynor's Raiders after her home colony on the planet Agria is invaded by Zerg in Wings of Liberty, where she is voiced by Ali Hillis. A selfless and altruistic individual, she mainly <b>wishes</b> <b>for</b> life to return to normal. She {{is considered to be}} the moral opposite of Tychus Findlay, acting as a metaphorical angel on Raynor's shoulder, and represents a positive moral influence on Raynor. Originally designed as a male character, Hanson was changed in development to female to act as a love interest for Raynor, albeit limited by Raynor's status as a mercenary and fugitive, and moreover the fact that Raynor is still trying to sort himself out in relation to Sarah Kerrigan.|$|E
5|$|In the Time Room, Prismo reveals to Jake that Finn {{has been}} transported to a separate, altered world {{based on his}} wish that The Lich never existed. Together, they watch the events in Finn's world on Prismo's television, and Prismo asks Jake what {{he would like to}} wish for. Jake <b>wishes</b> <b>for</b> a sandwich, but Prismo urges him to {{consider}} using his wish on something important, such as helping Finn. Jake tells Prismo he will use it when he knows Finn will be in real danger, and after a conversation, the two decide to hang out; Prismo mutes the TV and the two begin to ignore the events happening in Finn's timeline.|$|E

In the winter, John struggles to find food for his daughter, Snow White, when he sheds a tear over a frozen lake and frees a {{creature}} known as the Green-Eyed One. As thanks for freeing him, Green-Eyed One offers John three <b>wishes.</b> <b>For</b> John's wishes, he asks for nourishment for his daughter, a kingdom to raise his family, and a queen for a new wife, as the creature cannot raise the dead.|$|E

5000|$|Wishing (boulēsis) is not deliberation. We cannot {{say that}} what people <b>wish</b> <b>for</b> is good by definition, and {{although}} we could {{say that what}} is <b>wished</b> <b>for</b> is always what appears good, this will still be very variable. Most importantly we could say that a worthy (spoudaios) man will <b>wish</b> <b>for</b> what is [...] "truly" [...] good. Most people are misled by pleasure, [...] "for it seems to them to be a good, though it is not".|$|R
5|$|Many {{art objects}} were {{produced}} in Northern China {{during the time}} of the Northern Celestial Masters. These objects were closely modeled on Buddhist designs. The image of the god (usually Laozi), would be carved on the front side of a stone stele, with inscriptions on the back or side of the carving. The inscriptions were usually prayers to the dead, a wish for the happiness of family members or <b>wishes</b> <b>for</b> political peace. The iconography and contents of the inscriptions show that a close relationship between Daoism and Buddhism existed in the Northern Wei state. This relationship is especially evident in some four-sided stelae that had carvings of both Laozi on two sides and the Buddha on the other two.|$|E
5|$|Outside Tsubasa, Sakura makes various {{appearances}} in Clamp's manga xxxHolic, showing {{some of the}} events happening in Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle. Sakura also appears in later volumes when her soul is separated from her body {{and sent to the}} Dream World. There, she meets Yūko's assistant, a teenager named Kimihiro Watanuki, whom she finds similar to the original Syaoran. One of her feathers – that of her memories of Syaoran – appears in Watanuki's world and gives the medium Kohane Tsuyuri the ability to exorcise spirits. After Kohane <b>wishes</b> <b>for</b> the removal of her ability, the feather stays with a black Mokona Modoki. Sakura does not appear in the animated adaptions of xxxHolic until the original video animations series xxxHolic Shunmuki, in which she appears in the Dream World talking with Watanuki.|$|E
5|$|The {{woman is}} {{revealed}} to be a genie. Stokes is angry that he wasted his first two wishes; Stokes had previously wished for his boss to stop talking (which caused Gilmore's mouth to disappear) and for a boat. The boat, however, was not placed in water and Stokes is still forced {{to pay taxes on}} it. The genie suggests that Anson should give his physically handicapped brother the ability to walk as his third wish; but he instead <b>wishes</b> <b>for</b> the ability to be turned invisible. Anson, now invisible, runs out into the street and is killed by a truck as he crosses the road.|$|E
30|$|Here too, minor <b>wish</b> <b>for</b> CRS {{is related}} to minor hedonism. Hence, if the value for hedonism increases, so does the <b>wish</b> <b>for</b> CRS. Patient numbers in higher factor values are quiet small. In severe illnesses, {{thoughts}} of life enjoyment are seldom.|$|R

50|$|After the House of M ended, Justice and Firestar were {{unaffected}} by the global depowerment of mutants and thus retained their powers.

5|$|Alongside this, Siddhu applies for a {{bank loan}} {{to start his}} {{construction}} company. When his love for Hasini deepens, he wishes to propose to her. He confesses {{to her that he}} is engaged to Subbulakshmi against his wishes, but who he really wants is her. On learning of his engagement, Hasini gets dejected, but comes back a few days later and asks him to do what he <b>wishes</b> <b>for</b> and accepts his proposal. At this juncture, the ecstatic Siddhu is seen by a furious Aravind. Siddhu is admonished back home and he expresses his disinterest in marrying Subbulakshmi. When asked for his reason to like Hasini, Siddhu replies that if Hasini can stay with their family for a week, then all their questions shall be answered. He convinces Hasini to stay at his house after lying to her father, Kanaka Rao (Kota Srinivasa Rao) that she is going on a college tour.|$|E
5|$|Ned {{invites the}} Simpson family to a {{barbecue}} party and announces {{his plans to}} open a store for left-handed people; The Leftorium. During the pulling of a wishbone, Homer, who has been constantly jealous of the material success of Ned and his family, <b>wishes</b> <b>for</b> The Leftorium to be a failure and go out of business. Homer frequently checks in on Ned to ensure that business is going poorly and is happy to see precisely that happening. When Homer sees left-handed citizens struggling with items made for right-handed people, he thinks about informing them about The Leftorium, but decides not to. Eventually the store does indeed close due to lack of business, plunging the Flanders' into debt and misery. Ned is forced to sell his possessions, and Homer gleefully buys many of Ned's things. Homer starts to regret what he did, but when he goes to return Ned's possessions, he finds Ned's house repossessed and the family living in their car. Homer wrestles with the guilt his wish has brought, and tells Ned to open the store for one final day. He then tells all the left-handed residents of Springfield about The Leftorium, and they all travel to the store and buy things. The increase in customers helps Ned keep the store open and get his house back.|$|E
5|$|There are forty six {{characters}} encountered {{through the}} story that can be recruited, each offering their own contribution to the story. The majority of the main cast comes from the Greil Mercenaries group, led by its eponymous founder, Greil (voiced by Stephan Weyte). The protagonist is Ike (voiced by Jason Adkins), Greil's son.
