5|$|Gas metal {{arc welding}} (GMAW), {{sometimes}} referred to by its subtypes metal inert gas (MIG) welding or metal active gas (MAG) welding, is a welding process in which an electric arc forms between a consumable <b>wire</b> <b>electrode</b> and the workpiece metal(s), which heats the workpiece metal(s), causing them to melt and join.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} <b>wire</b> <b>electrode,</b> a {{shielding}} gas feeds through the welding gun, which shields the process from contaminants in the air. The {{process can be}} semi-automatic or automatic. A constant voltage, direct current power source is most commonly used with GMAW, but constant current systems, as well as alternating current, can be used. There are four primary methods of metal transfer in GMAW, called globular, short-circuiting, spray, and pulsed-spray, {{each of which has}} distinct properties and corresponding advantages and limitations.|$|E
5|$|During {{the middle}} of the century, many new welding methods were invented. In 1930, Kyle Taylor was {{responsible}} for the release of stud welding, which soon became popular in shipbuilding and construction. Submerged arc welding was invented the same year and continues to be popular today. In 1932 a Russian, Konstantin Khrenov successfully implemented the first underwater electric arc welding. Gas tungsten arc welding, after decades of development, was finally perfected in 1941, and gas metal arc welding followed in 1948, allowing for fast welding of non-ferrous materials but requiring expensive shielding gases. Shielded metal arc welding was developed during the 1950s, using a flux-coated consumable electrode, and it quickly became the most popular metal arc welding process. In 1957, the flux-cored arc welding process debuted, in which the self-shielded <b>wire</b> <b>electrode</b> could be used with automatic equipment, resulting in greatly increased welding speeds, and that same year, plasma arc welding was invented.

40|$|Abstract: Although {{improving}} {{electrostatic precipitator}} (ESP) collection of fine particles (micron and submicron sizes) remains of interest, {{it is not}} yet clear whether the turbulent flow patterns caused by the presence of electric field and charge in ESPs advance or deteriorate fine particle precipitation process. In this paper, results of the laser flow visualization and Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) measurements of the particle flow velocity fields in a wire–to–plate type ESP model with seven <b>wire</b> <b>electrodes</b> are presented. Both experiments were carried out for negative and positive polarity of the <b>wire</b> <b>electrodes.</b> The laser flow visualization and PIV measurements clearly confirmed formation of the secondary flow (velocity of several tens of cm/s) in the ESP model, which interacts with the primary flow. The particle flow pattern changes caused by the strong interaction between the primary and secondary flows are more pronounced for higher operating voltages (higher electrohydrodynamic number NEHD) and lower primary flow velocities (lower Reynolds number Re). The particle flow patterns for the positive voltage polarity of the <b>wire</b> <b>electrodes</b> are more stable and regular than those for the negative voltage polarity due to the nonuniformity of the negative corona along the <b>wire</b> <b>electrodes</b> (tufts) ...|$|R
25|$|In retrospect, {{it seems}} likely that the {{electrical}} discharges reported by Winkler in 1744 were started by CFE from his <b>wire</b> <b>electrode.</b> However, meaningful investigations had to wait until after J.J. Thomson's identification of the electron in 1897, and until after it was understood – from thermal emission and photo-emission work – that electrons could be emitted from inside metals (rather than from surface-adsorbed gas molecules), and that – in the absence of applied fields – electrons escaping from metals had to overcome a work function barrier.|$|E
500|$|Most {{applications}} of {{gas metal arc}} welding use a constant voltage power supply. [...] As a result, any change in arc length (which is directly related to voltage) results in a large change in heat input and current. A shorter arc length causes a much greater heat input, which makes the <b>wire</b> <b>electrode</b> melt more quickly and thereby restore the original arc length. This helps operators keep the arc length consistent even when manually welding with hand-held welding guns. To achieve a similar effect, sometimes a constant current power source is used in combination with an arc voltage-controlled wire feed unit. [...] In this case, a change in arc length makes the wire feed rate adjust to maintain a relatively constant arc length. In rare circumstances, a constant current power source and a constant wire feed rate unit might be coupled, especially for the welding of metals with high thermal conductivities, such as aluminum. [...] This grants the operator additional control over the heat input into the weld, but requires significant skill to perform successfully.|$|E

40|$|Strength-duration {{characteristics}} for {{the stimulation}} of 131 raphespinal and reticulospinal axons in {{the spinal cord}} were determined using two types of stimulating electrode. Conduction velocity of these fibres ranged from 0. 86 to 63 m/s. With silver wire (250 micron diameter) stimulating electrodes, chronaxies were: 0. 18 +/- 0. 06 ms for axons conducting between 16 and 63 m/s, 0. 4 +/- 0. 22 ms for axons conducting between 5 and 15 m/s and 2. 06 +/- 0. 79 ms for those with conduction velocity less than 5 m/s. There was an inverse relationship between chronaxie and conduction velocity. Rheobase values ranged from 7. 4 to 400 microA but were independent of conduction velocity. Chronaxies obtained with <b>wire</b> <b>electrodes</b> were compared with those from stimulation of the same fibre through saline-filled micropipettes (2 - 12 micron tip diameter). Rheobase values with the micropipettes ranged from 1. 6 to 20 microA, indicating a close proximity of the pipette to the axon. For these axons, chronaxies from metal <b>wire</b> <b>electrodes</b> ranged from 0. 12 to 2. 4 ms and for micropipettes from 0. 04 to 0. 65 ms.

We hypothesized that atrial defibrillation could be accomplished consistently and safely by means of low-energy shocks delivered by temporary stainless steel <b>wire</b> <b>electrodes</b> placed {{at the time of}} the operation. Sterile pericarditis was created in five mongrel dogs (20. 9 ± 2. 1 kg), and pairs of standard temporary stainless steel <b>wire</b> <b>electrodes</b> were placed on the right atrial appendage, on Bachmann's bundle, and on the right ventricular apex for pacing, sensing, and recording. Temporary stainless steel <b>wire</b> <b>electrodes,</b> insulated except for the distal 6 cm and used to deliver defibrillation shocks, were placed adjacent to both atrial free walls and secured to the pericardium. All electrodes were brought out through the skin, and the sternotomy was closed. Dogs were tested in the conscious state on postoperative day 2. Sustained {{atrial fibrillation}} was induced by rapid atrial pacing. A customized software program was used to control the defibrillator, which delivered R wave–synchronous biphasic shocks to the atria through the temporary defibrillation electrodes. The shock intensity began at 50 volts and was increased by 10 -volt increments until atrial fibrillation was terminated. Atrial fibrillation was terminated in all dogs at 112 ± 7 volts, with an energy of 0. 42 ± 0. 07 joule and an impedance of 67. 8 ± 4 ohms (all values mean ± standard error of the mean). The mean percent success for atrial defibrillation at this minimal threshold was 49 %. Thus at low-threshold voltages atrial fibrillation could be terminated with every other shock. A 25 % increase in the minimal threshold voltage improved the conversion rate to 73 % (mean energy 0. 66 ± 0. 19 joule and mean impedance of 67 ± 3. 8 ohms). No complications were detected with the use of the electrodes or after their removal on the seventh postoperative day. One instance of electrode migration on the right atrial free wall was detected by roentgenography, but this did not adversely affect atrial defibrillation threshold. No ventricular arrhythmias or hemodynamic complications were noted during shock delivery. We conclude that successful conversion of atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm can be achieved consistently with shock energies below 0. 5 joule delivered with temporary epicardial defibrillation <b>wire</b> <b>electrodes</b> in this canine pericarditis model.
