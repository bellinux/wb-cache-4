This post-1967 plan was rejected by the waqf authorities <b>who</b> <b>own</b> <b>the</b> plot because they feared that clearance work {{at the base of the}} Temple Mount would endanger the Haram compound. Subsequently, in 1981 a small square equipped with benches was constructed on part of the covered pool.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Geetha starts an {{investigation}} when she realises {{that her son}} has gone missing. After a preliminary investigation, Geetha calls Rambabu and his family in for questioning. Rambabu, predicting that this would happen, coaches his family on how to present their alibi. As a result, when questioned individually, their responses are consistent. They also produce the restaurant receipt, the movie tickets and the tickets of the bus journey as proof of their alibi. The statements of the people <b>who</b> <b>own</b> <b>the</b> establishments that the family visited in Vizianagaram further solidify Rambabu's alibi. However, after a thorough investigation, Geetha realises that Rambabu had acquired the tickets and the receipt {{on the day of}} the incident, made an acquaintance with the owners, and had only actually taken the trip a day later with his family.|$|E
5|$|The CFL re-gained {{relative}} {{stability in the}} 2000s, mostly thanks to enforcement of a salary cap, stricter standards of ownership, and increasingly lucrative television contracts negotiated with Canadian networks. The league has remained solely focused on its Canadian operations, with expansion efforts focused on returning a stable team to Ottawa. The first attempt at a replacement for the Rough Riders, the Ottawa Renegades, played from 2002 to 2005; in its last season, despite league resistance but without any other buyers, the Gliebermans purchased the franchise, then gave {{it back to the}} league, which suspended it prior to the 2006 season. After an extended delay due to stadium problems in Ottawa, the Ottawa Redblacks, <b>who</b> <b>own</b> <b>the</b> Rough Riders' history and trademarks, launched in 2014 and have so far been a success under the ownership of Jeff Hunt's consortium. Further expansion has been limited to one-off games such as Touchdown Atlantic and Northern Kickoff in more distant Canadian markets.|$|E

25|$|In 1997 Stagecoach won the {{franchise}} {{to operate the}} Sheffield Supertram system, from the South Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive, <b>who</b> <b>own</b> <b>the</b> system.

Stagecoach took another turn in 1998, when it purchased Scotland's Prestwick Airport for £41million. By the summer of 1999, the company was rumoured to have been offered some £80million for Prestwick. They sold the airport in January 2001 to concentrate on surface transport.|$|E
