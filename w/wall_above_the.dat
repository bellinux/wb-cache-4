5|$|Above is the Great Chamber, an {{impressive}} {{room with a}} barrel ceiling with geometrical plaster decoration featuring John Lyte's arms and those of his wife, Edith Horsey. This ceiling is a rare survival. The <b>wall</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> bed displays the royal coat of arms and Tudor roses, signifying Lyte's loyalty to King Henry VIII (whose government Lyte represented in Somerset). The panelling is 17th century, as are the great four poster bed and the tapestries on the walls. Some of the original oak panelling of the room {{may have been used}} {{in the construction of the}} canopy of the bed.|$|E
5|$|In {{the centre}} {{room of the}} {{transept}} there is a low slate slab altar stone, with an etched red Chi-Ro emblem, with Alpha and Omega incised. A Chi-ro is an early form of Christogram, and is formed by the super imposition {{of the first two}} letters of the Greek alphabet onto a circle. There is a rough Cornish granite monolith seat and prie-dieu, which with the altar stone are inset with gold-enamelled small tiles by Andrew Rowe. The wall plaster has an incised red line. There is a white glazed tiled floor with red tile border around the two early Celtic crosses. In the south <b>wall</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> stone crosses are 1920s/1930s windows representing Saints Padarn, Dewi and (in the centre and above) Teilo. The Padarn window is a single-light window with a standing figure of St Padarn holding a staff and chalice, with a valley and hills behind him. It was given in memory of members of the Bonsall family, and was made by the Heaton, Butler & Bayne, London, around 1930, thus preceding Peter Lord's work on the transept.|$|E
5|$|The cathedral {{went through}} periods of {{enlargement}} and renovation following {{the fires of}} 1270 and 1390 that included the doubling in length of the choir, the provision of outer aisles to {{the northern and southern}} walls of both the nave and choir. Today, these walls are at full height in places and at foundation level in others yet the overall cruciform shape is still discernible. A mostly intact octagonal chapterhouse dates from the major enlargement after the fire of 1270. The gable <b>wall</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> double door entrance that links the west towers is nearly complete and was rebuilt following the fire of 1390. It accommodates a large window opening that now only contains stub tracery work and fragments of a large rose window. Recessed and chest tombs in both transepts and in the south aisle of the choir contain effigies of bishops and knights, and large flat slabs in the now grass-covered floor of the cathedral mark the positions of early graves. The homes of the dignitaries and canons, or manses, stood in the chanonry and were destroyed by fire on three occasions: in 1270, 1390 and 1402. The two towers of the west front are mostly complete and were part of the first phase of construction. Only the precentor's manse is substantially intact; two others have been incorporated into private buildings. A protective wall of massive proportions surrounded the cathedral precinct, but only a small section has survived. The wall had four access gates, one of which—the Pans Port—still exists.|$|E

25|$|The Benedictine choir {{school at}} Lambach Abbey, Upper Austria, which Hitler {{attended}} {{for several months}} as a boy, had a swastika chiseled into the monastery portal and also the <b>wall</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> spring grotto in the courtyard by 1868. Their origin was the personal coat of arms of Abbot Theoderich Hagn of the monastery in Lambach, which bore a golden swastika with slanted points on a blue field. The Lambach swastika is probably of Medieval origin.|$|E
40|$|Theme‐bases Session II‐B: Recent Developments in Seismic Engineering DesignTransfer {{structures}} are often adopted in tall building structures to provide open spaces at lower storeys for facilitating various functional uses. However, the complicated interactions of transfer structures and supported shear walls prohibit succinct physical models or design guidelines to rationalise the design process. Significant shear stress concentration on supported shear <b>walls</b> <b>above</b> deformed transfer structure is revealed to critically dominate {{the design of}} the buildings under combined effects of gravity and seismic loads. Without adequate prior knowledge and modelling techniques, engineers could under-design the building by overlooking the effect or adopting an unfavourable structural layout at the preliminary design stage leading to difficulty in subsequent detailed member design. This paper aims at studying the structural behaviours of in-plane loaded coupled shear <b>walls</b> supported <b>above</b> a transfer beam. A comprehensive physical model explaining the causes for such shear concentration is presented, in which the shear concentration on <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> transfer level is attributed to the forces induced by slabs and beams to restrain the differential movements of adjacent shear <b>walls</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> deformed transfer structure. The controlling parameters, comprising the symmetric and asymmetric shear wall arrangements, positions of supporting columns and transfer beams, and span-to-depth ratio of the transfer beam are identified through parametric studies using elastic finite element models. Remedial measures are highlighted for moderating the detrimental effect of shear concentration on supported <b>walls</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> transfer level...|$|R

The front verandah finishes short of each end, leaving a small bay for a double-hung window on each level.|$|R
25|$|The {{church is}} located near Pirot, about 10 {{kilometers}} west {{at the foot}} of Belava Mountain. It was built on an elevated plateau above the river coast of Nišava, near Staničenje village and the confluence of Temštica, near the main road from Sofia to Niš. In the fresco epitaph located on the west <b>wall</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> entrance, it was noted that Arsenije, Jefimija, Konstantin and some others (whose names were erased over the years) constructed and painted the church in 1331 and 1332, at the time of Bulgarian Emperor Joan Asen (Ivan Alexander) and Vidin master Belaur. A narthex with an open wooden porch was added in the 19th century.|$|E
25|$|The players spin {{a racket}} {{to decide who}} serves first. This player starts the first rally by electing to serve from either {{the left or right}} service box. For a legal serve, one of the server's feet must be in the service box, not {{touching}} any part of the service box lines, as the player strikes the ball. After being struck by the racket, the ball must strike the front <b>wall</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> service line and below the out line and land in the opposite back quarter court. The receiving player can choose to volley a serve after it has hit the front wall. If the server wins the point, the two players switch sides for the following point.|$|E
25|$|Three higher {{apertures}} {{can be seen}} on {{the western}} <b>wall</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> women's entrance: two rectangular narrow apertures and above them in the middle the third aperture made in white stone {{in the shape of a}} hexagram, a six-pointed star. The Women's door is encased into atypical heavy slabs of white limestone, and bears on the upper slab an unusual cross. The shape of the cross doesn't figure in the Maronite crosses tradition. It is a combination between a coptic cross and an Occitan cross. The Occitan cross is attributed to Raymond IV of Toulouse, whose family reigned in the county of Tripoli during the Crusades from 1109 till 1289 AD. Kfarsghab was administratively part of the county of Tripoli, which could be an explanation of the origin of this unusual cross.|$|E
30|$|Using three masonry <b>walls</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> removed {{column in}} four {{successive}} floors or more prevented the structure’s collapse. The four floors represent 40  % {{of all the}} floors of the structure. The maximum beam rotation was 0.13 ° which {{is less than the}} UFC limits (3.61 °) and so the structure is safe.|$|R
50|$|The central church, {{known as}} Chiesa plebana, {{is of the}} Latin Cross layout with a nave, two aisles and transept. The aisles are divided by {{cruciform}} pilasters with alternating capitals with zoomorphic motifs and of Corinthian style. <b>The</b> <b>walls</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> colonnade are polychrome. The trefoil-arched wooden ceiling dates from the 14th century.|$|R
50|$|Many of <b>the</b> inner <b>walls</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> eighth floor were {{restructured}} {{to expand}} {{the size of the}} guestrooms. Gutting and redesigning the size of these rooms would prove difficult because almost none of the original architectural drawings had been saved. Therefore, there are now 175 different room configurations in the historic tower.|$|R
25|$|The Southport Gates {{were built}} {{in place of the}} old Puerta de África in the lower section of the wall. Deadman's Cemetery used to be located on the inner (north) side of the <b>wall,</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> Southport Gates with some of the headstones dating back to 1738. In 1798 Southport Ditch Cemetery (later renamed Trafalgar Cemetery in honour of the Battle of Trafalgar) was consecrated, a small {{graveyard}} {{on the other side of}} the wall from Deadman's Cemetery. Many of the tombstones are those of victims of the 1804, 1813 and 1814 yellow fever epidemics. Trafalgar Cemetery fell into disuse after 1814. In 1929 Deadman's Cemetery became part of St. Jago's Barracks and was turned into a ball alley and rifle range, with the headstones relocated to Trafalgar Cemetery in 1932 and embedded into one of the walls.|$|E
25|$|After the serve, {{the players}} take turns {{hitting the ball}} against the front <b>wall,</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> tin and below the out line. The ball may strike the side or back walls at any time, {{as long as it}} hits below the out line. It must not hit the floor after hitting the racket and before hitting the front wall. A ball landing on either the out line or the line {{along the top of the}} tin is {{considered}} to be out. After the ball hits the front wall, it is allowed to bounce once on the floor (and any number of times against the side or back walls) before a player must return it. Players may move anywhere around the court but accidental or deliberate obstruction of the other player's movements is forbidden and could result in a let or a stroke. Players typically return to the centre of the court after making a shot.|$|E
25|$|The {{third stage}} {{comprises}} the porch, including the west gable parapet wall surmounted by a Latin cross at its apex, the gable parapet {{wall to the}} nave also with a Latin cross, and the tiled roofs of the nave, apse and porch. The porch is {{to the west of}} the nave, its walls also constructed of random rubble with uncoloured concrete block quoins. The western porch facade has a rectangular window with three lights, the outer casements of which open outwards while the central light is fixed. There is a narrow, upright slit in the stone <b>wall</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> window. The western facade of the nave has a circular window in-filled with fixed louvers and topped by a stone drip moulding. Both gable parapets have moulded block-work coping. The northern elevation of the porch features a doorway now accessed by a ramp with a bell mounted to the right-hand side of the doorway that is framed in bevelled concrete.|$|E
50|$|The {{fortified}} {{church of}} Ațel {{was built by}} Transylvanian Saxons and completed {{by the end of}} the 15th century; it is surrounded by double <b>walls.</b> <b>Above</b> <b>the</b> entrance rises the Old School tower, and close by is the Oat Tower. The fortified church of Dupuș was also built during the 15th century.|$|R
5000|$|They {{are located}} {{on the corner of}} Stirling Terrace and Spencer Street almost {{directly}} opposite the Old Post Office building.

5|$|The {{standards}} and balusters {{of the stairs}} {{on the north side}} of the hall came from Eversley Manor House and probably date to the mid-17th century, although the treads are original to the house and possibly mid-16th century. <b>The</b> <b>walls</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> stairs and on the first-floor landing contain some very large paintings, including several portraits.|$|R
25|$|The chancel {{is of the}} 1856 rebuild and restoration. It is of {{ironstone}} and limestone {{work with}} a Collyweston slate roof. Ashlar {{is used in the}} east <b>wall</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> spring of the east window, and in the cornerstones and plinth. Twin stepped diagonal buttresses are at the south-east and north-east corners, with a further angled buttress on the south wall. A moulded plinth runs below windows on the east wall, and on the south wall where at the west, it is broken by a pointed doorway with chamfered opening and hood mould; the door is planked with decorative metal face hinges. On the south side are three windows of identical style and construction, with twin lights and 'Y' tracery set within a chamfered pointed arch. The north side contains two identical plain lancet windows. The chancel east window with hood mould is of three lights with intersecting 'Y' tracery within a double-chamfered surround. Immediately to the east of the east window is a table tomb within iron railings, to Mary Skelton (died 1767).|$|E
25|$|Pit Hill Chapel {{opened in}} 1990, and {{represents}} the Wesleyan Methodist tradition which was growing in North East England, with the chapels used for both religious worship and as community venues, which continue in {{its role in}} the museum display. Opened in the 1850s, it originally stood not far from its present site, having been built in what would eventually become Beamish village, near the museum entrance. A stained glass window of The Light of The World by William Holman Hunt came from a chapel in Bedlington. A two handled Love Feast Mug dates from 1868, and came from a chapel in Shildon Colliery. On the eastern <b>wall,</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> elevated altar area, is an angled plain white surface used for magic lantern shows, generated using a replica of the double-lensed acetylene gas powered lanterns of the period, mounted in the aisle of the main seating area. Off the western end of the hall is the vestry, featuring a small library and communion sets from Trimdon Colliery and Catchgate.|$|E
25|$|Among these trench-built solid-walled {{buildings}} were three that lay some distance {{west of the}} great hall, with the amphitheatrical structure Hope-Taylor {{referred to as the}} assembly-structure lying between them: a pair of rectangular buildings placed end to end with what {{appears to have been a}} wattle fence between them, and an associated building that Hope-Taylor interpreted as a kitchen. These three were the only buildings on the site oriented north-south rather than east-west, and were constructed at the same time as or shortly before the assembly-structure. They were destroyed along with the Great Enclosure around 633, after which a church was built at the east end of the site. The southern building of the pair Hope-Taylor was convinced was a temple. No pottery or other indications of normal domestic use were found in this building. Nor were scattered animal bones. The building had been constructed in two stages: the second was constructed around the first (which was one of the few buildings on the site not to have been burned down), using carefully finished carpentry and heavy buttresses similar to those of the great hall. Inside the inner wall, the trench had been left open or opened up to form a pit approximately 6 feet long and more than 1 foot wide, which was full of animal bones; these had been deposited in at least 9 layers and stacked against the <b>wall</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> pit after space ran out, and there were half again as many as were found elsewhere on the site. They were mostly bones of oxen, with an extremely high proportion of skulls, and evidently had mostly been slaughtered as young calves, when their meat would be tender, rather than either shortly after birth when male calves would be surplus to dairy farming or after reaching full growth and being usable as draft animals. There were three non-structural postholes from which the posts had been removed before the building was burned and demolished. In addition, outside the northwest corner of the building there was a pit 4 feet in depth in which a post had been placed; nothing was found here except unusually clayey soil compared to the rest of the site, and crushed animal teeth, probably from sheep or goats; numerous thin, pointed stakes had been driven into the ground around this feature. And south of the pit, on the west side of the building, were traces of the successive erection of at least four temporary huts. A smaller, similar set of traces lay to the west of the screen between that building and the one to the north. South of the temple building was a rectangular enclosure that appeared to have been unroofed. There was no door out to this area from the building; both buildings had doors on their two long, east and west sides. Finally, of the graves in the western cemetery area of the site, the northernmost 16 were grouped around the temple building; but no burials lay to the east of the enclosure, suggesting that was where the gate was. All but one body, a child who was buried doubled-over, were buried with their heads to the west. Hope-Taylor considered the burials associated with free-standing posts beside the building and pointed out that although the form of burialstretched out and without grave goodswould have been acceptable to Christians, the dating and association with the un-Christian building mean that at least some of the burials must have occurred during heathen times.|$|E
