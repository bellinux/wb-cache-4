40|$|The Dutch <b>Wadden</b> <b>area</b> is {{an internationally}} renowned natural area with World Heritage status. Its {{ecological}} uniqueness {{can be attributed}} to its shallow coastal waters. However, the <b>Wadden</b> <b>area</b> is also a rural area in search of competitive economic activity so as to provide employment to its population. The aim of the analysis is to ascertain the level of the contribution of tourism to different parts of the rural economy, and to examine which parts and aspects of the natural area are highly appreciated by visitors and thus may serve as immobile resources for the local economy. The results of our study indicate that the islands have a completely specialized local economy: tourism, while the share of tourism in the economy of the mainland coast is below the Dutch national average. The natural attractivity of the <b>Wadden</b> <b>area</b> relates mainly to the islands and the sea, whereas the mainland coast is very modestly appreciated for its natural qualities. Eight spatial clusters of attractive places are identified. The tourism employment level and the share in attractive places are assessed for each cluster. Although strongly attractive parts of the <b>Wadden</b> <b>area</b> are often spatially-related to huge numbers of visitors, they nevertheless lead to only modest employment figures. We also find that the natural attractivity of the <b>Wadden</b> <b>area</b> arouses deep feelings in visitors in that they experience priceless qualities such as the purity and immensity of the natural environment, and they feel strongly connected to nature. Our findings cast light on the need for an integrative management approach to the <b>Wadden</b> <b>area</b> as both a rural and a natural area, and meanwhile relating it to competing urban areas. An example of a suitable integrative policy would be one that accounts for the trade-off between the value of urban dwellers' deep feelings (as tourists) and the value of rural job...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a {{spatial and temporal}} analysis of tourism in the Dutch <b>Wadden</b> <b>area</b> and identifies policy dilemmas and monitoring needs. The analysis is temporal because historical, current and future aspects of tourism development are addressed; it is spatial because the spatial differentiaton of tourism within the <b>Wadden</b> <b>area</b> is examined. For {{the assessment of the}} historical and current situation focus is on visitor and employment data and especially the relative degree of specialization of the local economy on tourism. For the future direction of tourism and possible investment options, the paper draws on surveyed views of 91 tourism entrepreneurs in the <b>Wadden</b> <b>area.</b> On the basis of this spatial and temporal analysis, the paper identifies policy dilemmas that differ substantially among the Wadden islands, the Waddensea, and the mainland Wadden coast. Drawing on this in depth empirical analysis the paper theoretically aims to enrich the Tourism Area Life Cycle (TALC) concept and the monitoring it implies. In response to the needs of monitoring sustainablilty, the paper argues for a broader yet still minimal extension of TALC. It argues for a four quadrant TALC – named TALC- 4 q – in which four perspectives on tourism development are combined: market, ecology and nature, regional labor market and policy. The combination of monitoring visitor flows and market share, together with ecological quality, employment size and share, and the consensus on policy, is expected to refine the accuracy of the TALC concept and fuel its wider use in the search for sustainable tourism...|$|E

40|$|Holocene {{relative}} sea-level reconstructions {{provide information}} on differential land movements, palaeo-landscapes, occupational history, palaeo-ecology of coastal areas and are important for climate change studies. For The Netherlands most coastal regions have a well-established sea level curve. However, {{this is not the}} case for the <b>Wadden</b> <b>area.</b> Up until recently, there were not enough reliable index points to establish a separate curve for the Northern Netherlands. Van de Plassche (1982) assumed on the basis of the little basal peat data available (two index points) that the curve for the Western Netherlands was also applicable to the North of the country. Using a modelling approach, Kiden (2002) suggested a lower curve based on postglacial isostatic subsidence. The data to support such hypothesis was expanded recently to 15 index points as presented by Kiden & Vos (in prep). We now present data on a sea level curve valid for the Dutch <b>Wadden</b> <b>area,</b> based on published and previously unpublished data to a dataset of 49 basal peat 14 C samples.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we address the {{characteristics}} of a publicly accessible Spatial Economic Ecological Database (SEED) and its ability to support a shared understanding among planners and experts of the economy and ecology of the Dutch <b>Wadden</b> <b>area.</b> Theoretical building blocks for a Wadden SEED are discussed. Our SEED contains a comprehensive set of stakeholder validated spatially explicit data on key economic and ecological indicators. These data extend over various spatial scales. Spatial issues relevant to the specification of a Wadden-SEED and its data needs are explored in this paper and illustrated using empirical data for the Dutch <b>Wadden</b> <b>area.</b> The purpose of the SEED is to integrate basic economic and ecologic information in order to support the resolution of specific (policy) questions and to facilitate connections between project level and strategic level in the spatial planning process. Although modest in its ambitions, we will argue that a Wadden SEED can serve as a valuable element in the much debated science-policy interface. A Wadden SEED is valuable since it is a consensus-based common knowledge base on the economy and ecology of an area rife with ecological-economic conflict, including conflict in which scientific information is often challenged and disputed.

40|$|AbstractThe Wadden Sea Forum {{has adopted}} {{integrated}} coastal zone management (ICZM) {{as a process}} for achieving the sustainable development of the Wadden Sea {{in a way that}} is environmentally sound, economically viable and socially beneficial. This requires, besides information about the ecosystem, also information and analysis of recent demographic and socioeconomic developments in the entire trilateral (with parts in the Netherlands, Germany and Denmark) Wadden region at the very detailed spatial scale of municipalities bordering the Wadden Sea. We find that the area suffers from population decline and an ageing population due to selective migration processes. As a result, the potential labour force is declining. The number of jobs in the Wadden region is also declining and unemployment is relatively high. The regional economic structure of the trilateral <b>Wadden</b> <b>area</b> is very diverse and differs substantially from the national economic structure. However, even within the <b>Wadden</b> <b>area,</b> there are substantial economic differences over space between the islands and the coast, but also between neighbouring municipalities within the coastal areas. For a vital regional economy, any economic development should be targeted at activities that do not have a negative effect on the ecosystem and that can be employed at an economic and spatial scale that fits the natural environment and matches the type of skills and jobs of the inhabitants. Our analysis shows that within sectors such as agriculture, fishing, tourism and personal and business services there are many types of activities that fit within these limitations that could be used to foster a vital regional economy in the Wadden region. Further, jobs can be created further away from the coastal zone as long as these jobs are created in urban areas within a reasonable commuting distance. Large-scale industrial activities in the <b>Wadden</b> <b>area</b> should be discouraged and, if necessary, only be allowed in the present industrial zones provided any potential damage to the ecosystem can be avoided. Given these pressures and management challenges, if ICZM in the broader sense is to be achieved, insights are needed into the combined ecological and socioeconomic (valuation) system of the whole Wadden Sea area in order to design science-based management support and monitoring systems. The essential characteristics of this approach are strongly interdisciplinary and require a focus on aspects of scale and cumulative processes to monitor and manage the impacts of autonomous processes and human activities on the unique natural values of the Wadden UNESCO World Heritage site...|$|E
40|$|Tourism {{has become}} one of the {{important}} economic activities in the Dutch Wadden Sea area. The tranquillity, open space, the natural qualities and cultural inheritance of the area attract every year between 1 and 2 million visitors. Especially the islands are a popular holiday destination. Tourism development on the coastal mainland, however, is lacking behind. It can hardly profit from the visitor streams to the islands. Biking, hiking and a visit to the spacious beaches of the islands are the most popular activities. The authentic atmosphere and the landscapes of the islands are appreciated the most. From a survey among participants in nature excursions it appeared that experiencing wildlife of the Wadden Sea is the most important factor in shaping visitors’ attachment to the area. In general the nomination of the Wadden Sea as a natural World Heritage site is considered to be an important incentive for tourism development. From our surveys it became apparent that, in contrary to the German coastal areas, the WHS is relatively unkown and different stakeholders, like entrepreneurs, don’t take any initiative that could benefit from the listing.

40|$|One of the {{important}} aquifers for geothermal purposes in the Netherlands is the Lower Cretaceous Vlieland Sandstone Formation (VSF). The VSF is deposited in a eustatic transgressive phase and has a dispersed distribution in the northern Netherlands, which is not very well understood. This study produced a depositional model and a thickness map for the VSF, based on available wells, biostratigraphy, cores and seismic data. The area of investigation is {{the northern part of}} the onshore Netherlands: Groningen, Friesland, Drenthe, the <b>Wadden</b> <b>area.</b> Regional tectonics and faulting determined the formation of the depocentres: the Vlieland and Lower Saxony basins. Subrosion and halokinetic effects in the Zechstein strata affected the paleogeography and influenced the deposition of VSF. In the early transgressional stage (Ryazanian, Valanginian), the basins are probably separated by the Friesland Platform, which is probably flooded during the Late Valanginian. Sandstones deposited at the end of the transgression (Hauterivian, Barremian) are found on the Friesland Platform and in the Lower Saxony Basin. Most VSF on the platform is reworked and the preserved sandstones represent mainly lower shoreface facies. This study shows that previous depositional models are outdated and comes up with a new depositional model and thickness map of the VSF.

40|$|The Wadden Sea and its {{associated}} barrier island system exhibit highly dynamic behaviour. Of major concern is the movement of water and air and the transport, erosion and deposition of sand and mud. These processes result in an ever-changing morphology (topography/bathymetry) of the islands, tidal channels, inter-tidal shoals and tidal flats. This dynamic development of the shape {{and nature of the}} <b>Wadden</b> <b>area</b> forms together with the biotic systems, the present Wadden system. The morphodynamic development of theWadden Sea is influenced by changing environmental conditions e. g. sea-level rise as well as by human interferences.

However, our present knowledge is not sufficient to predict the effects of human interferences under different climate change scenarios in sufficient detail and accuracy.

40|$|Abstract Over {{the centuries}} {{communities}} {{living in the}} coastal areas of the North Sea and the Atlantic Ocean have made a living by using the in- and out-going tides to their benefit.

40|$|Hydrogeological {{research}} in coastal areas has gained considerable attention {{over the last}} decades due to increasing stresses on fresh groundwater resources. Fundamental groundwater flow and solute transport analyses remain essential for a concise understanding of the governing processes that lead to salinisation of fresh groundwater resources. However, the challenge of modern research is the application and quantification of these processes in real world cases. In this context, deltaic areas are amongst the most difficult study areas as they often have a complex groundwater salinity distribution. The <b>Wadden</b> Sea <b>area</b> {{in the northern part}} of the Netherlands is an example of such an area. We quantified salt water intrusion and salinisation of groundwater flow systems in two representative case studies in the <b>Wadden</b> Sea <b>area,</b> using the density dependent groundwater flow and transport code MOCDENS 3 D. The results indicate that sea-level rise and autonomous processes will cause severe salinisation in the future, especially in the low polder areas close to the sea. In addition, we show that enhanced land subsidence due to salt exploitation accelerates this process. Salinisation can be mitigated to some extent by raising surface water levels in polders and by creating saline groundwater collection areas that maintain a low controlled water level...|$|R

40|$|Aim of {{this thesis}} is the {{development}} of an operationally applicable method to derive the topography of the German Tidal Flat <b>Area</b> (<b>Wadden</b> Sea) by evaluation of satellite image using the so-called waterline method. Accurate and up-to-date topographic maps of the tidal flatsare an important basis for the protection of theWadden Sea as well as for coastal preservation. Due to the high variability of the topography in this area causedby storms and tidal currents conventionally generated maps (e. g. by echo sounding) often do not represent the actual terrain. The waterline method provides an additional approach. Here, a series of satellite images of the German Bight taken at different water levels are analysed to detect theborderline between tidal flats and adjacent water areas. After geo-coding, those waterlines are combined with the corresponding water levels to represent the topography on an irregularly spaced grid. Interpolation of these data yields a topographic mapof the intertidal zone. In this thesis the waterline method is used to map the <b>wadden</b> <b>areas</b> of Nordfriesland and Cuxhaven. The study is based on the analysis of 71 images taken by the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) aboard the European Remote Sensing Satellite ERS- 2 in the period from 1996 to 1999. Using a wavelet-based edge detection algorithm a largely automated estimation of the waterline is possible in spite of the high level of multiplicative noise in the SAR images. The developed procedure reduces the amount of work for an human operator considerably. A modified pass point correction is used for the geo-coding of the derived waterlines. Water levels obtained by the water level modell ofthe German Maritime and Hydrographic Agency(BSH) are assigned to the geo-coded waterlines. The resulting grid of topographic points is interpolated into a topographic map ofthe intertidal area {{for each of the four}} years using the software package TASH developed at the University of Hannover, Germany...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The sediments and soils {{constitute}} an erosion-sedimentatlon cycle composed of: Solid carbonate rock- ~ Soil ~ Fluviatile sediment ~ Estuarine sediment ~ Marine sediment- ~ Salt marsh. Determinations {{were made of}} the total carbonate and dolomite contents of the sediments {{as well as the}} strontium and carbon- 14 content of the carbonates and their stable carbon and oxygen isotopic composition. In soils the isotopic composition of the carbonates was studied. The soils analysed are from the Netherlands and France. The sediments are from the rivers Rhine, Meuse, Eros, Seine, Somme and Rh 6 ne, from the estuaries of the Rhine, Meuse and the FErns and from the coastal areas of Belgium, the Netherlands and Western Germany. The isotopic composition of the carbonates in soils is {{different from that of the}} parent material. This difference is due to the presence of newly formed carbonates. The mount varies between 10 and 50 % of the carbonates present. The rivers Rhine, Meuse and Seine contain both soil-derived carbonates and carbonates from eroded carbonate rocks. The carbonates in the river Somme originate mainly from carbonate rocks. The carbonates in the estuaries of the Rhine, Meuse and Ems are predominantly derived from the marine environment.

40|$|In {{this study}} we assess the {{adaptive}} capacity of relevant institutions for ecosystems and environmental management in two complex systems: the Dutch Wadden Sea and the Venice Lagoon. A new tool called the Adaptive Capacity Wheel (ACW) is used to diagnose strengths and weaknesses in the institutional systems in these two areas. An overview of both strengths and weaknesses leads {{to a better understanding}} of the system of governance and enhances the discussion of how it can be improved. The ACW identifies six dimensions that are relevant for the adaptive capacity of a society, according to the literature on climate adaptation and governance. They are variety, learning capacity, room for autonomous change, leadership, availability of resources, and fair governance. Then, we compare the two cases drawing attention to the physical and institutional similarities and differences that could explain the level of adaptive capacity we found. In this study, the physical and economic characteristics of the two regions proved to be quite similar, while the institutional system was very different. These two different governance systems, however, lead to a similarly low level of adaptive capacity. In the Wadden, decision processes are slowed down because of a lack of authority and leadership. On the dimension of learning, the Wadden case scores positively. In Venice, lack of cooperation and accountability limit learning. Venice scores well on the autonomous ability to change. We conclude that in both cases there is a lot to be improved and that the two regions can learn from each other. Venice could, for example, improve learning with structures similar to those in the Wadden, such as the Wadden Academy.

By allowing high tides to enter the polders in a regulated way, sediment deposition can be re-introduced and the level of the polder can be raised.

In this report we describe the potential ecological and economical risks of introduction of the three alien invasive predatory snails in the Nature 2000 <b>Wadden</b> Sea <b>area...</b>|$|R
50|$|This {{hunting and}} fishing culture was {{sedentary}} and semi-nomadic. In the old dunes at the then much further east lying coastline the remains of some peasant settlements were found. From these findings it can be deduced that animal husbandry (sheep and goats) and agriculture (wheat and barley) had been practised on a small scale. Vlaardingen culture had also traits of a Mesolithic hunter-gatherer society because agriculture {{in much of the}} <b>Wadden</b> Sea <b>area</b> and the Rhine-Meuse-Scheldt delta was difficult. Hunting and fishing were important means of livelihood. Bones found near the settlements of deer, bears, otters and sturgeon support that.|$|R
