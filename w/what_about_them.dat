6000|$|Mr. Topes sat, {{polishing}} his spectacles with a {{white silk}} handkerchief. Vague and myopic between their puckered lids, his eyes seemed lost, homeless, unhappy. He was thinking about beauty. There were certain relations between the eyelids and the temples, between the breast and the shoulder; there were certain successions of sounds. But <b>what</b> <b>about</b> <b>them?</b> Ah, that was the problem--that was the problem. And there was youth, there was innocence. But {{it was all very}} obscure, and there were so many phrases, so many remembered pictures and melodies; he seemed to get himself entangled among them. And he was after all so old and so ineffective. He put on his spectacles again, and definition came into the foggy world beyond his eyes. The shuttered room was very dark. He could distinguish the Renaissance profile of Mr. Buzzacott, bearded and delicately featured. In her deep arm-chair Barbara appeared, faintly white, in an attitude relaxed and brooding. And Mrs. Topes {{was nothing more than a}} voice in the darkness. She had got on to the marriage of the Prince of Wales. Who would they eventually find for him? ...|$|E

60|$|One {{evening we}} were very much surprised. We were most of us laid down on our mats to sleep, when our watch came running in among us, being frighted with the sudden roaring of some lions just by them, which, it seems, they had not seen, the night being dark, till they were just upon them. There was, as it proved, an old lion and his whole family, for there was the lioness and three young lions, besides the old king, who was a monstrous great one. One of the young ones--who were good, large, well-grown ones too--leaped up upon one of our negroes, who stood sentinel, before he saw him, at which he was heartily frighted, cried out, {{and ran into the}} tent. Our other man, who had a gun, had not {{presence}} of mind at first to shoot him, but struck him with the butt-end of his piece, which made him whine a little, and then growl at him fearfully; but the fellow retired, and, we being all alarmed, three of our men snatched up their guns, ran to the tent door, where they saw the great old lion by the fire of his eyes, and first fired at him, but, we supposed, missed him, or at least did not kill him; for they went all off, but raised a most hideous roar, which, as if they had called for help, brought down a prodigious number of lions, and other furious creatures, we know not <b>what,</b> <b>about</b> <b>them,</b> for we could not see them; but there was a noise, and yelling and howling, and all sorts of such wilderness music on every side of us, as if all the beasts of the desert were assembled to devour us.|$|E

40|$|People {{everywhere}} are generating ever-increasing {{amounts of}} data, often without being {{fully aware of}} who is recording <b>what</b> <b>about</b> <b>them.</b> For example, initiatives such as mandated smart metering, expected to be widely deployed in the UK {{in the next few}} years and already attempted in countries such as the Netherlands, will generate vast quantities of detailed, personal data about huge segments of the population. Neither the impact nor the potential of this society-wide data gathering are well understood. Once data is gathered, it will be processed – and society is only now beginning to grapple with the consequences for privacy, both legal and ethical, of these actions, e. g., Brown et al. [4]. There is the potential for great harm through, e. g., invasion of privacy; but also the potential for great benefits by using this data to make more efficient use of resources, as well as releasing its vast economic potential [28]. In this editorial we briefly discuss work in this area, the challenges still faced, and some potential avenues for addressing them...|$|E
40|$|Culture {{is not new}} to {{the study}} of migration. It has lurked beneath the surface for some time, {{occasionally}} protruding openly into the discussion, usually under some pseudonym. The authors bring culture into the open. They are concerned with how culture manifests itself in the migration process for three groups of actors: the migrants, those remaining in the sending areas, and people already living in the recipient locations. The topics vary widely. What unites the authors is an understanding that though actors behave differently, within a group there are economically important shared beliefs (customs, values, attitudes, etc.), which we commonly refer to as culture. Culture and identify {{play a central role in}} our understanding of migration as an economic phenomenon; but <b>what</b> <b>about</b> <b>them</b> matters? Properly, we should be looking at the determinants of identity and the determinants of culture (prices and incomes, broadly defined). But this is not what is done. Usually identity and culture appear in economics articles as a black box. Here we try to begin to break open the black box. ...|$|E

40|$|The Bachelor's thesis {{introduces}} a less-known artist and collector Miloš Malina, who is exceptional for combining both his passions in his artistic creations. The work deals mainly with the reference {{stored in the}} Central Bohemian Museum, where is his entire heritage, which Malina has left to the Museum still during his lifetime. The thesis {{is divided into three}} parts, which present the artist himself and his estate. At the end of the thesis I focus on Malina's work. The first part presents his life, studies and employment. It is also concerned with his ambiguous artistic style, which was influenced by some friends artists as Filla (Malina was inspired by his Cubist paintings), Špála (the same preoccupation with the blue colour), even foreign artists as Cézanne (use of apples in his still-lifes). Women, who surrounded him his whole life, were a great inspiration. I focused on the why he selected some of them and <b>what</b> <b>about</b> <b>them</b> was interesting for him. In the second part I will show how the whole legacy got into the Central Bohemian Museum. I will also mention how the legacy was thematically divided and stored in different individual depositories. In conclusion I not only focused on his work. I also aimed to the way his work reflects his fervour for collecting...|$|E
40|$|As {{the single}} most {{successful}} social-networking Website to date, Facebook has caused a shift in both practice and perception of online socialisation, {{and its relationship to}} the offline world. While not the first online social networking service, Facebook’s user base dwarfs its nearest competitors. Mark Zuckerberg’s creation boasts more than 750 million users (Facebook). The currently ailing MySpace claimed a ceiling of 100 million users in 2006 (Cashmore). Further, the accuracy of this number has been contested due to a high proportion of fake or inactive accounts. Facebook by contrast, claims 50 % of its user base logs in {{at least once a day}} (Facebook). The popular and mainstream uptake of Facebook has shifted social use of the Internet from various and fragmented niche groups towards a common hub or portal around which much everyday Internet use is centred. The implications are many, but this paper will focus on the progress what Mimi Marinucci terms the “Facebook effect” (70) and the evolution of lists as a filtering mechanism representing one’s social zones within Facebook. This is in part inspired by the launch of Google’s new social networking service Google+ which includes “circles” as a fundamental design feature for sorting contacts. Circles are an acknowledgement of the shortcomings of a single, unified friends list that defines the Facebook experience. These lists and circles are both manifestations of the same essential concept: our social lives are, in fact, divided into various zones not defined by an online/offline dichotomy, by fantasy role-play, deviant sexual practices, or other marginal or minority interests. What the lists and circles demonstrate is that even very common, mainstream people occupy different roles in everyday life, and that to be effective social tools, social networking sites must grant users control over their various identities and over who knows <b>what</b> <b>about</b> <b>them.</b> Even so, the very nature of computer-based social tools lead to problematic definitions of identities and relationships using discreet terms, in contrast to more fluid, performative constructions of an individual and their relations to others. 8 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Necessity {{breathes}} {{life into}} art. As a listener I don't want art that's nice, clean {{and a perfect}} match for somebody's sofa. I don't want generalities. I don't want archetypes. Any sophisticated smart talked surface is wasted, if beneath there's not a raw core of necessity, dripping of the artists pains and angers, and glowing of her intense will to act. In this essay I want to {{shed some light on}} the effect of necessity in storytelling. Theoretically I could have done this by analysing oral contemporary stories (and oral stories are always contemporary). But being a cultural historian, I regard the past as a useful thinking tool: In the present we tactfully conceal our selves and our fellow human beings under a smooth collective surface. In the past the scientist should feel free to shamelessly aim for the individual, as close as the sources permits. Tactfulness is out of place, as he who has left traces in writing, must have done so for them to be followed. I have been following the traces left by Marie de France in her 12 th century trouvère tale Lanval, by Jean d´Arras in Mélusine, written in Poitou, 1393, and by Jón Guðmundsson in his tales Ljúflingskonan and Selameyjan from 17 th century Iceland. Lanval, Ljúflingskonan and Selameyjan are included in Norwegian translations, for the very first time. The mention stories all include the same storyline, indicating that the storytellers based their tales on already existing art. This way of working is much more common in storytelling than in other art forms. I m examining this phenomenon, not by searching for common features; the common features are visible already, they are of no interest. What s of interest is the individual and contextual, and the necessities that brought the story to life. Sad enough, the reaction I got when I presented these very interesting perspectives for an essay to certain persons, was "What about the folk?" <b>What</b> <b>about</b> <b>them?!</b> I was actually tempted just to scream "Grow up, idiots!". But I didn t. In stead I included an extra bonus section featuring the necessities of the individuals who made "the folk" into a household tale, namely the brothers Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm.
