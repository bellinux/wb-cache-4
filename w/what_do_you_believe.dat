40|$|Belief {{revision}} is {{the process}} by which one alters his or her belief state in the face of contradicting evidence. The contradictions typically arise from a set of statements in which not all propositions can be true at the same time. Despite widespread agreement that people have little difficulty finding such inconsistency, we still lack sufficient knowledge on how people revise their beliefs to resolve the inconsistencies. In the following paper, we report two experiments that were concerned with this research topic. In experiment 1, we explored how familiarity with the content of the statements (familiar vs unfamiliar) affects peoples ’ belief revision choices. In experiment 2, we investigated whether different ways of questioning (<b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> “more” vs. “less”) affect belief revision.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the current status of and need for acceptable use policies (AUPs) for students ' use of the Internet in Alabama school systems. Alabama superintendents were questioned using an electronic survey that could be returned via e-mail on an anonymous Internet site. Primary questions were: (1) What is your level of concern about students ' proper use of the Internet? (2) Is there really a necessity for schools to have an AUP concerning accessing the Internet? (3) <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> are the crucial elements of an AUP for students ' use of the Internet? (4) What was the nature of the incident your system experienced related to student use of the Internet in the past years? and (5) What is the best way to make sure that students use the Internet properly in school other than having an AUP?

40|$|Parent {{involvement}} in schools – <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> about it? Disparate groups, like front office staff at a school, preservice teachers, teachers, school administrators, and parents respond quite differently to focus questions, which might include: What {{do you see}} as important aspects of parent involvement? What parents do you think would probably not {{want to be involved in}} par-ent involvement activities at the school? Do you know enough about parent involvement? Is it important to be informed anyway? Survey questions queried teachers, classified staff, parents, administrators, and preservice teachers on their perceptions of parent involvement. The purpose of this study was to unravel common threads within the data, which revealed a very narrow understanding of parent involvement. This narrow understanding needs to be broadened if, indeed, we ever want to see parent involvement as a systemic, important foun-dation for student learning. The study discloses that each group had a disparate view of what constitutes parent involvement. The least vocal group in this dis-cussion is the parent; the most vocal is the teacher. The conclusion is that it is inherently important to provide training for preservice and current teachers to help broaden the often myopic vision of parent involvement...|$|E
