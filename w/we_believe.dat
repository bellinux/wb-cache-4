The British government in India has not only deprived the Indian people of their freedom but has based itself on the exploitation of the masses, and has ruined India economically, politically, culturally and spiritually. <b>We</b> <b>believe</b> therefore, that India must sever the British connection and attain Purna Swaraji or complete sovereignty and self-rule.|$|E

5|$|Stereotypical and {{historically}} inaccurate images of Indians in general interfere with learning about them by creating, supporting and maintaining oversimplified and inaccurate views {{of indigenous peoples}} and their cultures. When stereotypical representations are taken as factual information, they {{contribute to the development}} of cultural biases and prejudices, (clearly a contradiction to the educational mission of the University.) In the same vein, <b>we</b> <b>believe</b> that continuation of the use of Indians as symbols and mascots is incongruous with the philosophy espoused by many Americans as promoting inclusivity and diversity.|$|E

I cannot see how it will help my people. I cannot see how it will resolve the question of land and access to land that troubles us. I cannot see how it will ensure that indigenous people have access to the same opportunities that other Australians enjoy. Fellow Australians, what is most hurtful is that after all we have learned together, after subjugating us and then freeing us, once again you are telling us that you know better. How dare you?

These three developments included the development at SDC of sophisticated time-sharing and data-management systems, the advances being made by the Library of Congress and others in formatting large data bases for storage on magnetic tape, and the advent of third-generation computer equipment, which <b>we</b> <b>believed</b> could accommodate the large files that would be required. <b>We</b> <b>believed</b> that, together, these developments would make it possible for all types and sizes of libraries to use a large computer for their processing and housekeeping functions without changing their traditional patterns of operation or giving up the autonomy they now enjoy.
