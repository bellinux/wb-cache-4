40|$|The paper {{reported}} using {{a mathematical model}} that simulated the <b>wear</b> volume in comparison to measurement by a ball-on-disc for deposited CrN films on tool steel (JIS SKD 11). Three dimensional profile instruments were {{used to measure the}} <b>wear</b> scar trace for variations of numerical data of two dimensional profiles. By using numerical algorithms, the <b>wear</b> volume measurements of <b>wear</b> profiles are to save considerable time and economical. A new mathematical method is issued for determining <b>wear</b> volumes in this study. The estimated results were precisely fitted as compared with other calculations for three dimensional estimations of <b>wear</b> volumes. <b>Wear</b> rate is a significant reference for considering the <b>wear</b> resistance of coatings. The estimation of <b>wear</b> rate is the <b>wear</b> volume divided sliding length and the load. The generally <b>wear</b> behavior tests include sliding <b>wear</b> tests [1 - 3], Kalo tests, cylinder <b>wear</b> test, thrust washer test, ball-on-disc test, and pin-on-disc test.

40|$|Abstract: The frictional-work <b>wear</b> {{model has}} been used popularly for the {{prediction}} of <b>wear</b> phenomena such as rai l corrugation.

Experimental results have widely shown that this <b>wear</b> coefficient is strongly dependent upon the type of <b>wear</b> process involved. The <b>wear</b> coefficient in the frictional-work <b>wear</b> model under two-disc contact and dry friction conditions proposed is a multi-step function of the friction power density corresponding to three types of <b>wear.</b> However, at present {{there is no clear}} means of predicting the transitions between <b>wear</b> types.

40|$|Abstract. Fretting <b>wear</b> {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} evaluate {{the effects of the}} contacting shapes of spacer grid springs on the <b>wear</b> behavior of a nuclear fuel rod in room temperature air and water. The main objective was to quantitatively compare the <b>wear</b> behavior of the nuclear fuel rod with the variation of the contacting spring shapes. The variation of the real <b>worn</b> area in the <b>wear</b> scar, the change in the <b>wear</b> volume and the maximum <b>wear</b> depth with the slip amplitude were calculated and measured through an optical micrometer and surface profilometry. The results of the <b>wear</b> tests showed that the <b>wear</b> volume and the maximum <b>wear</b> depth were sensitively affected by each spring shape with increasing slip amplitude and with a change of the test environment. From the analysis of the <b>wear</b> scar, it is possible to separate the size of the <b>wear</b> scar from the real <b>worn</b> area and the transferred one. In addition, we found that the <b>wear</b> volume has a linear relation with the real <b>worn</b> area rather than the size of the <b>wear</b> scar and this was only determined by using each spring shape even though the <b>wear</b> tests were carried out with different conditions. From the above results, it is possible to evaluate a <b>wear</b> resistant spring by using the correlation between the variation of the real <b>worn</b> area and the <b>wear</b> behavior at each spring shape...|$|R
