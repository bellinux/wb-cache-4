She <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> voice perfect, so in between takes she listened to tapes of Hank Azaria reading lines for Apu, to make sure her voice could realistically be Apu's mother's. During the flashback to Apu's childhood, the animators made sure not to show Manjula, as they wished to reveal her {{at the end of}} the episode.|$|E
5|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{learns that}} his father took all the family money and fled to Argentina with his mistress. Left {{to pick up the}} pieces, Andy sells off family heirlooms, and is upset that he has to sell the family boat for lack of any other means for his mother to support herself. Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) convinces him that before he sells the boat, they should take it out for one last sunset cruise, and they drive to Stamford, Connecticut, where the boat is docked. Andy starts to hoist the main sail, but is stopped by a broker who is to sail it to the Caribbean for the buyer. With Erin's encouragement, Andy decides to take the boat to the Caribbean himself. He then finds his drunken brother Walter (Josh Groban) passed out in the liquor closet. Walter comes to and tells Andy he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> first relapse out of the way before {{checking}} into rehab. Andy invites him on the trip, saying they both need family time together and leaves, thanking Erin for her encouragement. Erin says to the camera that she would have loved to go with him if he asked. Back in the office that evening, Pete Miller (Jake Lacy) asks Erin to join him for drinks, and she accepts.|$|E

25|$|They {{reached an}} {{agreement}} that some 1,685 Jews would be spared for a ransom of $1,000 per head. Most of the passengers could not raise the funds themselves, so Kastner auctioned off 150 seats to wealthy Jews {{in order to pay}} for the others. In addition, SS officer Kurt Becher, Heinrich Himmler's envoy insisted that 50 seats be reserved for the families of individuals who had personally paid him for favors, at an amount of approximately $25,000 per person. Becher <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> price per head increased to $2,000 but Himmler set the price at $1,000. The total value of the ransom was estimated by the Jewish community to be 8,600,000 Swiss francs, though Becher himself valued it at only 3,000,000 Swiss francs.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to helping characterize Halloween, candy pumpkins {{played a role}} in the current U.S. implementation of daylight saving time. Since the 1960s, candy makers had <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> trick-or-treat period covered by Daylight Saving, reasoning that if children have an extra hour of daylight, they would collect more candy. During the 1985 U.S Congressional hearings on Daylight Saving, the industry went so far as to put candy pumpkins on the seat of every senator, hoping to win a little favor. On July 8, 1986, President Ronald Reagan signed the Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act of 1986 into law; it contained a daylight saving rider which continued daylight saving time until the early morning of last Sunday in October; this did not include Halloween night. In 2005, daylight saving time was extended to the first Sunday in November—just long enough to include Halloween.|$|E

She also uses pheromones which make men {{fall in love with}} her. Julia Roberts, who worked with director Joel Schumacher in Flatliners, was heavily rumored to be in contention for the role, but the rumours were dismissed by Schumacher, saying that if she would have <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> role, she would have called him.|$|E

500|$|The title track, Loughnan's [...] "Big Red Rock", is an eight-and-a-half minute {{instrumental}} {{described by}} Juke Magazine as [...] "expertly capturing the stark loneliness and cosmic tranquility one gets standing before their namesake rock". According to Loughnan, the atmosphere {{they wanted to}} create was [...] "that spacey sort of feeling—like desert and we <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> sound of the didgeridoo—which we did electronically". Doyle imitated a didgeridoo by playing guitar with a wah-wah pedal. Tony Catterall of The Canberra Times praised [...] "Big Red Rock", saying that it [...] "suggests the huge expanse of the outback, then takes you to the Aboriginal secrets [...] the power surrounding the area [...] {{in a burst of}} truly inspired musicianship".|$|E
500|$|After {{appearing}} in the 1986 films Jumpin' Jack Flash and ¡Three Amigos!, Hartman successfully auditioned for NBC's variety show Saturday Night Live (SNL) and joined the cast and writing staff. He told the Los Angeles Times, [...] "I wanted to do [...] because I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> exposure that would give me box-office credibility so I can write movies for myself." [...] In his eight seasons with the show Hartman became known for his impressions, and performed as over 70 different characters. Hartman's original Saturday Night Live characters included Eugene, the Anal Retentive Chef and Unfrozen Caveman Lawyer. His impressions included Frank Sinatra, Ronald Reagan, Ed McMahon, Barbara Bush, Charlton Heston, Phil Donahue and Bill Clinton; the last was often considered his best-known impression.|$|E
500|$|Eric Zumbrunnen and Jeff Buchanan {{served as}} the film's editors. Zumbrunnen stated that there was [...] "rewriting" [...] in a scene between Theodore and Samantha, after Theodore goes on a blind date. He {{explained}} that their goal in the scene was {{to make it clear}} that [...] " [...] was connecting with [...] and feeling for him. You <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> sense that the conversation was drawing them closer". Steven Soderbergh became involved in the film when Jonze's original cut ran over 150 minutes, and Soderbergh cut it down to 90 minutes. This was not the final version of the film, but it assisted Jonze in removing unnecessary sub-plots. Consequently, a supporting character played by Chris Cooper that was the subject of a documentary within the film was removed from the final cut.|$|E

I ultimately did go out with him and the song was finished just before my last date with him, which I'm kinda happy that it did not continue... The dance floor was quite a magical place for me. I started off wanting to be a dancer, so that had a lot to do with the song. The freedom that I always feel when I'm dancing, that feeling of inhabiting your body, letting yourself go, expressing yourself through music. I always thought of it as a magical place– even if you're not taking ecstasy. Hence that came to me as the primary inspiration for 'Into the Groove'." ...|$|E
500|$|The show's {{popularity}} {{resulted in}} enquiries for coats similar to Sherlock's, reported retailer Debenhams. Garment manufacturer Belstaff put the wool trench coat worn by Benedict Cumberbatch back into production before the series had ended. The Independent reported, [...] "designer Paul Costelloe moved {{to meet the}} demand, offering tailored coats and scarves based on the series, while Savile Row bespoke tailor John Pearse said many of his clients were inquiring about the actors' clothes." [...] Journalist Alexis Petridis commented, [...] "ou can see why men <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> look. Perhaps they noted the effect Cumberbatch, by no means your standard telly hunk, had on lady viewers … and decided it must {{have something to do}} with the clobber. So it is that Britain's latest men's style icon is a fictional asexual sociopath first seen onscreen hitting a corpse with a horse whip. Surely not even the great detective himself could have deduced that was going to happen." ...|$|E
500|$|Two {{more points}} were dropped in Arsenal's next match, away to Leicester City {{on the first}} weekend of December. Henry was absent from the {{starting}} team as was captain Vieira. Arsenal had taken the lead at the hour mark through a Gilberto header, but conceded the equaliser in stoppage time. What made matters worse was the dismissal of Cole for a two-footed lunge on Ben Thatcher; he missed the team's next three fixtures as a result. Wenger said afterwards: [...] "It looked like Ashley <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> ball {{but it was a}} two-footed tackle that was too high, it was a red card and we have to accept it." [...] A goal from Bergkamp earned Arsenal a 1–0 win the following week, at home to Blackburn Rovers. Chelsea's defeat a day before meant the win for Arsenal was enough to take them back top, a point clear of Manchester United, who were now in second place.|$|E

500|$|The storyline {{idea was}} {{developed}} by head writer and co-executive producer Sally Sussman Morina. For this storyline, the soap opera partnered with the American Heart Association in order to highlight the issue of women's heart health. Executive producer Mal Young felt that the character of Jill was the [...] "perfect choice to show how a woman’s life can dramatically change {{as a result of}} heart disease." [...] He further mentioned that [...] "Along with providing us with some very emotional and dramatic episodes, the subject also gives us the opportunity to educate and highlight a very pertinent issue using characters our viewers know well. As well as seeing how it affects Jill as she comes to terms with her condition, the story will also illustrate how it impacts her family and those closest to her." [...] The producers considered Jill to be the right character to tackle this issue due to her being the show's longest-running character, as well as other factors: her unhealthy lifestyle, age and [...] "bullish personality that would deny anything was wrong". Following the episode where Jill is diagnosed, Walton appeared in a public service announcement urging viewers to visit the American Heart Association website. Young knew that the soap opera had to be [...] "very responsible", stating: [...] "We did not want to sensationalize this. We <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> facts in {{while at the same time}} telling a good, dramatic story." ...|$|E

In his Junk Science column on Fox News, Steven Milloy said Barton's inquiry was reasonable.

2500|$|In 1939, at {{the start}} of World War II, the British {{authorities}} declared the Templers enemy nationals, placed them under arrest and deported many of them to Australia. During the war the British government brokered the exchange of about 1,000 Templers for 550 Jews under German control. [...] "The swap, Bauer stresses, stemmed primarily from British and German interests: Just as the British <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> Germans out, Germany was happy for the chance to rid itself of a few hundred more Jews. The exchange, however, was not an even one. The number of Germans deported from Palestine was greater than the number of returning Jews." ...|$|E

One report states that they saw each other only occasionally and kept their marriage secret until Ellen was about to deliver their first child. When her parents Gerrit Rysdam and Magdalena Catrina Van Velzen learned of the marriage, they were furious, as they preferred that she marry {{a man who was}} also Dutch. Virigil's father thought he was too young to marry. Both parents <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> marriage annulled. One source reports that Rysdam was successful, but another says her father failed because Virgil and Ellen refused to reveal where they had been married. They also claimed they had used false names, which would have made the marriage invalid in any case.|$|E
