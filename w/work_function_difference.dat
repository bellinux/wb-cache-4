In late 1967, Tom Klein, working at the Fairchild Semiconductor R&D Labs, and reporting to Les Vadasz, realized that the <b>work</b> <b>function</b> <b>difference</b> between heavily P-type doped silicon and N-type silicon was 1.1 volt lower than the <b>work</b> <b>function</b> <b>difference</b> between aluminum and the same N-type silicon. This meant that the threshold voltage of MOS transistors with silicon gate could be 1.1 volt lower than the threshold voltage of MOS transistors with aluminum gate fabricated on the same starting material. Therefore, one could use starting material with 111 silicon orientation and simultaneously achieve both an adequate parasitic threshold voltage and low threshold voltage transistors {{without the use of}} a channel-stopper mask or ion implantation under the field oxide.

In {{order to}} build graphene-based devices, it is {{necessary}} to know how graphene is going to behave when different metals are deposited on it. Mainly, the <b>difference</b> in <b>work</b> <b>function</b> between graphene and the metal would cause a transfer of electrons which is expected to be from the material of lower <b>work</b> <b>function</b> to the higher one. The doping implies a change on the electron-phonon interaction and the most effective method to detect this change is by means of Raman spectroscopy. Sometimes, the change observed is opposite to what would be expected in terms of <b>work</b> <b>function</b> <b>differences,</b> which means that other phenomena, mainly stress, must explain this anomalous change. In this study, 3 nm of diverse metals were evaporated by electron beam evaporation over graphene flakes, previously grown by mechanical exfoliation on 285 nm of SiO 2 substrate. The Raman spectra of all the metals except that of cobalt show a similar behaviour.

40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} the {{application}} of the Kelvin probe in materials science and in particular on the study of metal and semiconductor surfaces in both ambient and UHV environments. The concept of the <b>work</b> <b>function</b> #phi# and its importance as a parameter in materials science is discussed in the context of novel technological applications. The various methods to determine the <b>work</b> <b>function</b> are reviewed. The main measurement technique used here - the Kelvin probe - is described in detail. The Kelvin probe measures local <b>work</b> <b>function</b> <b>differences</b> between a conducting sample and a reference tip in a non-contact, truly non-invasive way over a wide temperature range. However, it is an inherently relative technique and does not provide an absolute <b>work</b> <b>function</b> if the <b>work</b> <b>function</b> of the tip (#phi#_t_i_p) is not known. Therefore, a novel technique has been developed to measure #phi#_t_i_p with the Kelvin probe via the photoelectric effect, thus combining the advantages of both methods to provide the absolute <b>work</b> <b>function</b> of the sample surface. High and low <b>work</b> <b>function</b> surfaces were generated as target materials for a novel ion source based on hyperthermal surface ionisation: oxidised rhenium exhibits the highest <b>work</b> <b>function</b> of 7. 15 eV at a temperature of #approx# 900 K whereas the lowest <b>work</b> <b>function</b> of #approx# 2. 54 eV was measured on lanthanum hexaboride, LaB_ 6. The process of thermal and hyperthermal surface ionisation (SI, HSI) as well as the generation of hyperthermal molecular beams is discussed and a model of the surface ionisation process is developed to estimate its efficiency. Experimental data of SI and HSI are presented. The application of the Kelvin probe for the detection of defects and impurities in semiconductors, namely iron contamination, is demonstrated via two methods based on the measurement of the surface photovoltage. We find that both methods yield a lower surface potential and surface charge for iron contaminated wafers compared to a clean sample and therefore can be used as an indicator for chemical contamination on semiconductor surfaces.

40|$|We {{propose a}} method for solving to the Schrodinger-Poisson problem that can be {{efficiently}} implemented in realistic 3 D tight-binding models of semiconductor-based Majorana devices.

To demonstrate the capabilities of our approach, we calculate the response of the system to an external magnetic field, the dependence of the effective chemical potential on the <b>work</b> <b>function</b> <b>difference,</b> and the dependence of the effective semiconductor-superconductor coupling on the applied gate potential. We find that different low-energy bands are characterized by similar effective couplings, which results in induced gap features characterized by a single energy scale.

Finally, we show that a position-dependent <b>work</b> <b>function</b> <b>difference</b> can produce a non-homogeneous effective potential that is not affected by the screening due to the superconductor and is only partially suppressed by the charge inside the wire.

40|$|The {{use of an}} {{atmospheric}} pressure glow discharge (APGD) plasma was used at KSC to increase the hydrophilicity of spaceport materials to enhance their surface charge dissipation and prevent possible ESD in spaceport operations. Significant decreases in charge decay times were observed after tribocharging the materials using the standard KSC tribocharging test. The polarity and amount of charge transferred was dependent upon the effective <b>work</b> <b>function</b> <b>differences</b> between the respective materials. In this study, polyethylene (PE) and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) were exposed to a He+O 2 APGD. The pre and post treatment surface chemistry was analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and contact angle measurements. Semi-empirical and ab initio calculations were performed to correlate the experimental results with some plausible molecular and electronic structure features of the oxidation process. For the PE, significant surface oxidation was observed, as indicated by XPS showing C-O, C=O, and O-C=O bonding, {{and a decrease in}} the surface contact angle from 98. 9 deg to 61. 2 deg. For the PTFE, no C-O bonding appeared and the surface contact angle increased indicating the APGD only succeeded in cleaning the PTFE surface without affecting the surface structure. The calculations using the PM 3 and DFT methods were performed on single and multiple oligomers to simulate a wide variety of oxidation scenarios. Calculated <b>work</b> <b>function</b> results suggest that regardless of oxidation mechanism, e. g. -OH, = 0 or a combination thereof, the experimentally observed levels of surface oxidation are unlikely to lead to a significant change in the electronic structure of PE and that its increased hydrophilic properties are the primary reason for the observed changes in its electrostatic behavior. The calculations for PTFE argue strongly against significant oxidation of that material, as confirmed by the XPS results...|$|R
