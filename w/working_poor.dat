5|$|By May 1997, Republican {{congressional leaders}} reached a {{compromise}} with Democrats and President Clinton {{on the federal}} budget. The agreement called for a federal spending plan designed to reduce the federal deficit and achieve a balanced budget by 2002. The plan included a total of $152billion in bipartisan tax cuts over five years. Other major parts of the spending plan called for $115billion to be saved through a restructuring of Medicare, $24billion set aside to extend health insurance to children of the <b>working</b> <b>poor,</b> tax credits for college tuition, and a $2billion welfare-to-work jobs initiative.|$|E
5|$|In 1937, Wigan was {{prominently}} {{featured in}} George Orwell's The Road to Wigan Pier which dealt, in large part, {{with the living}} conditions of England's <b>working</b> <b>poor.</b> Some have embraced the Orwellian link, as it has provided the area with a modest tourist base over the years. Others regard this connection as disappointing, considering it an insinuation that Wigan is no better {{now than it was}} at the time of Orwell's writing.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} link between {{employee}} perceptions of working conditions {{and the desire for}} worker representation in Britain and the US. We find that the distribution of employee perceptions of <b>poor</b> <b>working</b> conditions is similar in Britain and the US; similar factors affect the number of perceived <b>poor</b> <b>working</b> conditions; and the perception of <b>poor</b> <b>working</b> conditions is strongly associated with the desire for union representation. The nature of workplaces, as opposed to employeesâ€™ characteristics, is the predominant factor determining employee perceptions of <b>poor</b> <b>working</b> conditions...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the 1980 ?, the feminization of the wage-earnings class has increased, even during the economic crisis. The lack of employment demand has not affected this trend, but it has debased the employment conditions of women. As a consequence, women are more often than men unemployed or under-employed and <b>working</b> <b>poors.</b> This paper deals with the growth of female participation in France and Europe. Then, it focuses on the female unemployment. At last, it analyses the development of under-employment and working poverty. ...|$|R

25|$|Many IWW members opposed United States {{participation}} in World War I. The organization {{passed a resolution}} against the war at its convention in November 1916. This echoed the view, expressed at the IWW's founding convention, that war represents struggles among capitalists in which the rich become richer, and the <b>working</b> <b>poor</b> all too often die {{at the hands of}} other workers.|$|E
25|$|The Pike Market Medical Clinic {{provides}} {{primary care}} and ancillary services to 3,600 patients. Most {{of these are}} either elderly, HIV-positive, or <b>working</b> <b>poor.</b> One third homeless, 30% are physically disabled, and 60% have severe mental illness and/or chemical addiction. The clinic provides basic medical care, subsidized prescriptions, lab work, mental health counseling, drug and alcohol counseling, connections to other community services, and sometimes even assistance in finding housing.|$|E
25|$|Nationalization was {{the central}} issue in the 1978 elections; the NDP held its own but the Liberals were wiped out and the Progressive Conservative party grew. Prosperity was at hand, with good prices for wheat and {{expansion}} of oil and uranium. The NDP spent resource revenues {{to build on the}} social welfare legacy of the CCF. It introduced a guaranteed income supplement for senior citizens, a family income plan for the <b>working</b> <b>poor,</b> a children's dental service, and a prescription drug plan.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} how teachers perceive children with <b>poor</b> <b>working</b> memory who exhibit disruptive behavior and whether disruptive behavior {{is associated with}} <b>poor</b> <b>working</b> memory. Four schools participated {{from the city of}} Beirut and suburbs including 115 students from grades one to three, and 12 teachers. The teachers completed three scales: Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Functions (BRIEF), Student-Teacher Relationship Scale (STRS), and Teacher Child Rating Scale (T-CRS); teacher interviews were also conducted for teachers. Children were tested for <b>poor</b> <b>working</b> memory using the digit memory test (DMT). Results showed significant correlation between <b>poor</b> <b>working</b> memory and disruptive behavior and teachers perceive these exhibited behaviors based on their inner judgment. Future directions are suggested to guide teachers on how to professionally report students with disruptive behavior. N/A 1 hard copy: ix, 89 leaves; facsims.; 30 cm. available at RNL.

25|$|Minimum {{wages are}} used widely in {{developing}} countries to protect vulnerable workers, reduce wage inequality, and lift the <b>working</b> <b>poor</b> out of poverty. The political popularity of minimum wages stems {{in part from the}} fact that the policy offers a means for redistributing income without having to increase government spending or establish formal transfer mechanisms. The challenge to policymakers is to find that wage level that is considered fair given workers' needs and the cost of living, but does not harm employment or a country's global competitiveness.|$|E
25|$|The New Deal {{programs}} {{to relieve the}} Depression are generally regarded as a mixed success in ending unemployment. At the time many New Deal programs - especially CCC - were popular. Liberals hailed them for improving {{the life of the}} common citizen, and for providing jobs for the unemployed, legal protection for labor unionists, modern utilities for rural America, living wages for the <b>working</b> <b>poor,</b> and price stability for the family farmer. Economic progress for minorities, however, was hindered by discrimination, an issue often avoided by Roosevelt's administration.|$|E
25|$|Sociologists Dennis Gilbert, William Thompson, Joseph Hickey, and James Henslin have {{proposed}} class systems with six distinct social classes. These class models feature an upper or capitalist class {{consisting of the}} rich and powerful, an upper middle class consisting of highly educated and affluent professionals, a middle class consisting of college-educated individuals employed in white-collar industries, a lower middle class composed of semi-professionals with typically some college education, a working class constituted by clerical and blue collar workers whose work is highly routinized, and a lower class divided between the <b>working</b> <b>poor</b> and the unemployed underclass.|$|E

50|$|The various {{measures}} that had implemented to fight social exclusion -in particular the income support allowance (RMI), the single parent allowance (API) and the allocation disabled adult (AAH)- were criticized for favoring unemployment and working poverty, exclusion and precariousness. Indeed, the government claimed the gains from return to work, {{after a period}} of unemployment, were offset by the reduction of social benefits paid in the previous period. That led to threshold effects and to inactivity trap situations. The National Observatory of Poverty and social exclusion said that the number of excluded people was deteriorating, while the number of <b>working</b> <b>poor's</b> was increasing (1.7 million in 2005).|$|R
25|$|By {{the early}} 1970s, very few {{businesses}} and residents {{remained in the}} formerly bustling commercial center of Ybor City around 7th Avenue, most notably the Columbia Restaurant The northern portion of the neighborhood (now known as V.M. Ybor), which had been separated by I-4, still had a substantial population, but a clear demographic shift had occurred. The area changed from a predominately middle-class Latino neighborhood to one that was predominately <b>working</b> <b>poor</b> and African American. Urban Renewal had not touched northern Ybor City, {{and a majority of}} residents lived in decaying small homes which had been built for new immigrants in the early 1900s.|$|E
25|$|In August 1969, Wellstone {{accepted}} a tenure-track position at Carleton College in Northfield, Minnesota, where he taught political science until his {{election to the}} Senate in 1990. During the 1970s and 1980s, he also began community organizing, working with the <b>working</b> <b>poor</b> and other politically disenfranchised communities. He founded the Organization for a Better Rice County, a group consisting mainly of single parents on welfare. The organization advocated for public housing, affordable health care, improved public education, free school lunches, and a publicly funded day care center. In 1978, he published his first book, How the Rural Poor Got Power: Narrative of a Grassroots Organizer, chronicling his work with the organization.|$|E
25|$|Most Parisians {{belonged to}} the working class or the poor. There were some forty {{thousand}} domestic servants, mostly working for middle-class families. Most came from the provinces; only five percent were born in Paris. They lived with the families they served, and their living and working conditions depended entirely on character of their employers. They received very low wages, worked long hours, and if they lost their job, or if a woman became pregnant, they had little hope of getting another position. A {{large portion of the}} <b>working</b> <b>poor,</b> especially women and including many children, worked at home, sewing, embroidering, making lace, dolls, toys and other products for small shops.|$|E

She ran the first UFW Hiring Hall, was {{an adviser to the}} California Commission on the Status of Women, and the secretary treasurer of National Land for People (an organization that worked to break up land monopolies in the San Joaquin Valley). Lopez-De La Cruz is also known for her work banning the short-handled hoe, her work educating fellow farm workers, her work promoting co-op farming, and her commitment to fighting injustice for the <b>working</b> <b>poor.</b>|$|E
25|$|Planning and {{architecture}} {{went through a}} paradigm shift {{at the turn of}} the 20th century. The industrialised cities of the 19th century had grown at a tremendous rate, with the pace and style of building largely dictated by private business concerns. The evils of urban life for the <b>working</b> <b>poor</b> were becoming increasingly evident as a matter for public concern. The laissez-faire style of government management of the economy, in fashion for most of the Victorian era, was starting to give way to a New Liberalism that championed intervention on the part of the poor and disadvantaged. Around 1900, theorists began developing urban planning models to mitigate the consequences of the industrial age, by providing citizens, especially factory workers, with healthier environments.|$|E

As SaldÃ­var has noted, [...] "Aside from the personal requirement of a gendered woman's space, Esperanza recognizes the collective requirements of the <b>working</b> <b>poor</b> and the homeless as well." [...] He refers to Esperanza's determination not to forget her working-class roots once she obtains her dream house, and to open her doors {{to those who are}} less fortunate. Esperanza says [...] "Passing bums will ask, Can I come in? I'll offer them the attic, ask them to stay, because I know how it is to be without a house." [...] According to SaldÃ­var, this statement of Esperanza's alludes to [...] "the necessity for a decent living space" [...] that is fundamental to all people, despite the different oppressions they face.|$|E
500|$|In {{the run-up}} to World War II, Voorhis urged neutrality. He {{proposed}} enactment of a law which would require a national referendum on whether to go to war. According to Voorhis, laws banning the sale of munitions to foreign nations and forbidding Americans from making loans to other nations for war preparations would keep the United States out of war. In September 1939, when interviewed by The New York Times for his reaction to the President calling Congress into special session to consider amendments to the Neutrality Act, Voorhis stated that a special session should quickly increase relief to the <b>working</b> <b>poor.</b> In early November 1939, however, Voorhis announced his support for repealing the arms embargo mandated by the Act, {{at the same time}} urging that the country remain neutral. Voorhis also opposed a peacetime draft, and supported [...] "lend-lease" [...] legislation.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to providing some individuals with income and employment, street newspapers are intended to give homeless participants responsibility and independence, {{and to create a}} tight-knit homeless community. Many offer additional programs to vendors, such as job training, housing placement assistance, and referral to other direct services. Others operate as a program of a larger social services organizationâ€”for instance, Chicago's StreetWise can refer vendors to providers of [...] "drug and alcohol treatment, high school equivalency classes, career counseling, and permanent housing". Most are engaged in some form of organizing and advocacy regarding homelessness and poverty, and many function as [...] "watchdogs" [...] for the local homeless communities. Howley has described street newspapers as a means of mobilizing the networks of [...] "formal and informal relationships that exist between the homeless, the unemployed, and the <b>working</b> <b>poor,</b> and shelter managers, healthcare workers, community organizers, and others who work on their behalf".|$|E

40|$|<b>Poor</b> <b>working</b> memory affects {{approximately}} 15 % of children. It {{is characterized}} by inattentive, distractible behavior that is accompanied by failures to complete everyday activities that require focused or sustained attention. Typically, children with <b>poor</b> <b>working</b> memory have normal social integration, normal levels of emotional control, and self-esteem. They may appear reserved in large group situations. Over 80 % of children with low working memory struggle in reading and mathematics, {{and it has been}} suggested that they are likely to be those children who make poor academic progress, but who fall below the radar of recognition for special educational needs. Beyond poor learning, children with <b>poor</b> <b>working</b> memory have a range of other cognitive problems that extend to low IQ and deficits in other executive functions, including monitoring and planning, problem solving, and sustained attention. Although the direction of causality is uncertain, it is possible that limited working memory resources underpin this wide range of deficits. There are three main approaches to alleviating the difficulties faced by children with <b>poor</b> <b>working</b> memoryâ€”a classroom intervention, strategy training, or direct working memory training...|$|R
