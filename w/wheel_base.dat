His motorcycle [...] "Lawmaster" [...] was a modified 500cc motorcycle. A large fairing was added over the motorcycle with machine guns, an extended <b>wheel</b> <b>base</b> and the largest functional tyres possible. The vehicle was also operational and Urban insisted on riding it himself {{rather than relying on}} Chroma key visual effects. Wagner described the necessity of adaptation from the source material and said that the 1995 film's attempt to directly replicate the comic's [...] motorcycle was unable to steer because the tyres were too large.|$|E

[...] The {{scene in}} which Ferris turns off the car to leave it with the garage {{attendant}} had to be shot a dozen times because it would not start. The car was built with a real <b>wheel</b> <b>base,</b> but used a Ford V8 engine instead of a V12. At the time of filming, the original 250 GT California model was worth $350,000.

2500|$|Lindbergh {{believed}} that a flight made in a single-seat monoplane designed around the dependable Wright J-5C [...] "Whirlwind" [...] radial engine provided {{the best chance of}} success. The Ryan NYP had a total fuel capacity of [...] or [...] of gasoline, which was necessary in order to have the range to make the anticipated flight non-stop. The fuel was stored in five fuel tanks, a forward tank (88 gallons), the main (209 gallons), and three wing tanks with a total of 153 gallons. [...] Lindbergh modified the design of the plane's [...] "trombone struts" [...] attached to the landing gear to provide a wider <b>wheel</b> <b>base</b> in order to accommodate the weight of the fuel.|$|E
2500|$|N {{scale is}} a popular model railway scale. Depending upon the {{manufacturer}} (or country), the scale ranges from 1:148 to 1:160. In all cases, the gauge (the distance between the rails) is [...] The term N gauge refers to the track dimensions, but in the UK in particular N gauge refers to a 1:148 scale with 1:160 (...) track gauge modelling. The terms N scale and N gauge are often inaccurately used interchangeably, as scale is defined as ratio or proportion of the model, and gauge only as a distance between rails. The scale 1:148 defines the rail to rail gauge equal to [...] exactly (at the cost of scale exactness), so when calculating the rail and/or track use 1:148 and for engines and car <b>wheel</b> <b>base</b> use 1:160.|$|E
