Allowing for an enormous debasement of art, they were essentially identical in the facial characteristics. This would suggest the descent of a tradition through countless generations. Or of course it may have been accidental. I am sure I do not know, but I think it possible that for unknown centuries other old statues may have existed in Orofena from which the idol was copied. Or some daring and impious spirit may have found his way to the cave in past ages and fashioned the local god upon this ancient model.|$|E

5000|$|When Mary of Jesus' casket {{was opened}} in 1909, a cursory {{scientific}} examination {{was performed on}} the 17th century abbess' body. In 1989, a Spanish physician named Andreas Medina participated in another examination of the remains and told investigative journalist Javier Sierra in 1991: [...] "What most surprised me about that case is that when <b>we</b> <b>compared</b> <b>the</b> state of the body, as it was described in the medical report from 1909, with how it appeared in 1989, we realized it had absolutely not deteriorated at all in the last eighty years." [...] Investigators took photographs and other evidence before re-sealing her casket, which remains on display in the monastery church. Some consider that incorruptibility, that is, lack of normal rot and decay after death, further evidence of sanctity.|$|E
50|$|A {{study done}} at the Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais stated this:The toxic fraction, Phoneutria nigriventer toxin-3 (PhTx3), {{abolished}} Ca2+-dependent glutamate release, but did not alter Ca2+-independent secretion of glutamate when rat brain cortical synaptosomes were depolarized with 33 mM KCl. This effect was most likely due to interference with the entry of calcium through voltage-gated calcium channels, because PhTx3 reduced by 50% the increase in intrasynaptosomal free calcium induced by membrane depolarization, and {{did not affect the}} release of glutamate evoked by a calcium ionophore (ionomycin). A polypeptide (Tx3-3) present in the PhTx3 fraction reproduced the effects of the PhTx3 fraction on transmitter release and intrasynaptosomal free calcium in the low nanomolar range. <b>We</b> <b>compared</b> <b>the</b> alterations produced by the Tx3-3 with the actions of toxins known to block calcium channels coupled to exocytosis: the results indicated that the Tx3-3 inhibition of glutamate release and intrasynaptosomal calcium resemble that observed with w-conotoxin MVIIC. We suggest that the Tx3-3 is a calcium-channel antagonist that blocked glutamate exocytosis.|$|E
