The {{branches}} are produced in regular [...] "pseudo whorls", {{actually a very}} tight spiral but appearing like a ring of branches arising from the same point. Many pines are uninodal, producing just one such <b>whorl</b> <b>of</b> <b>branches</b> each year, from buds {{at the tip of}} the year's new shoot, but others are multinodal, producing two or more whorls of branches per year. The spiral growth of branches, needles, and cone scales are arranged in Fibonacci number ratios. The new spring shoots are sometimes called [...] "candles"; they are covered in brown or whitish bud scales and point upward at first, then later turn green and spread outward.

50|$|The thallus is erect {{with regular}} nodes and internodes. At each node {{there is a}} <b>whorl</b> <b>of</b> <b>branches.</b> The whole plant is calcified and Equisetum-like. The internodes of the main axis consist of a single {{elongated}} cell, in Chara the internodes are corticated covering the main axis. In other genera these are absent. Where {{there is a single}} row of cortical cells the cortex is referred to as diplostichous, where there are two rows of cortical cells it is termed triplostichous. The intermodal cells elongate and do not divide they be come many times longer than broad.|$|E

50|$|The {{leaves of}} horsetails are {{arranged}} in whorls fused into nodal sheaths. The stems are usually green and photosynthetic, and are distinctive in being hollow, jointed and ridged (with sometimes 3 but usually 6-40 ridges). There {{may or may not}} be <b>whorls</b> <b>of</b> <b>branches</b> at the nodes.|$|R
50|$|The spores are borne under sporangiophores in strobili, cone-like {{structures}} at {{the tips}} {{of some of the}} stems. In many species the cone-bearing shoots are unbranched, and in some (e.g. field horsetail, E. arvense) they are non-photosynthetic, produced early in spring. In some other species (e.g. marsh horsetail, E. palustre) they are very similar to sterile shoots, photosynthetic and with <b>whorls</b> <b>of</b> <b>branches.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Piptatherum miliaceum is {{a species}} of grass known by the common name smilograss. It is native to Eurasia {{but it can be}} found in many {{other parts of the world}} as an {{introduced}} species and a casual weed of disturbed areas. It is a clumping perennial grass producing sturdy, erect stems that can reach 1.5 meters tall. The inflorescence is a panicle <b>of</b> several <b>whorls</b> <b>of</b> <b>branches</b> that divide into secondary <b>branches</b> bearing clusters <b>of</b> spikelets.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>branching</b> system <b>of</b> Chara {{species is}} complex with {{branches}} derived from apical cells which cut off segments {{at the base}} to form nodal and internodal cells alternately. The main axes bear <b>whorls</b> <b>of</b> <b>branches</b> in a superficial resemblance to Equisetum. [...] They are typically anchored to the littoral substrate by means <b>of</b> <b>branching</b> underground rhizoids. Chara plants are rough to the touch because of deposited calcium salts on the cell wall. The metabolic processes associated with this deposition often give Chara plants a distinctive and unpleasant smell of hydrogen sulfide.|$|R
50|$|A {{range of}} algal morphologies is exhibited, and {{convergence}} of features in unrelated groups is common. The only groups to exhibit three-dimensional multicellular thalli are the reds and browns, and some chlorophytes. Apical growth is constrained to subsets of these groups: the florideophyte reds, various browns, and the charophytes. The form of charophytes {{is quite different}} from those of reds and browns, because they have distinct nodes, separated by internode 'stems'; <b>whorls</b> <b>of</b> <b>branches</b> reminiscent <b>of</b> the horsetails occur at the nodes. Conceptacles are another polyphyletic trait; they appear in the coralline algae and the Hildenbrandiales, as well as the browns.|$|R
50|$|The {{inflorescence}} {{is usually}} compound with <b>whorls</b> <b>of</b> <b>branches,</b> though some are umbel-like, {{and others have}} solitary flowers. The flowers are regular, bisexual or unisexual. There are three sepals which usually persist in the fruit. Three petals, usually conspicuous, white, pink, purple, occasionally with yellow or purple spots. The petals rarely last more than one day. In Burnatia and Wiesneria the petals are minute and even occasionally absent in female flowers. Stamens are 3, 6, 9 or numerous. The ovary is superior, comprising 3 - numerous free carpels in one whorl or in a clustered head. Each carpel contains 1 (-2) anatropous ovules.|$|R
40|$|The fruticose thallus of the lichen Cladina stellaris (Opiz.) Brodo can be {{subdivided}} into individual <b>whorls</b> <b>of</b> <b>branches</b> <b>of</b> known age. Photosynthesis declines steadily with age from a maximum rate of 0. 76 milligram CO 2 per gram dry weight per hour in 1 -year-old whorls to 0. 02 milligram CO 2 per gram dry weight per hour after 15 years. Conversely, the dry biomass <b>of</b> the <b>whorls</b> increases up to age 9 {{years and then}} approximately levels off. Photosynthesis in whorls older than 15 years is less than 0. 01 milligram per gram per hour. Progressive changes in thallus color with age {{are associated with the}} observed photosynthetic decline. Whorls aged 6 years and younger together account for 18 % of thallus biomass but 50 % of photosynthetic activity. The implications of these results for the idea that the lichen symbiosis results in truly integrated organisms with senescence phenomena akin to those in higher plants is discussed...|$|R
50|$|Equisetopsida, or Sphenopsida, is a {{class of}} {{vascular}} plants with a fossil record {{going back to the}} Devonian. They are commonly known as horsetails. Living horsetails are represented by about twenty herbaceous species in the single genus Equisetum. They typically grow in wet areas, with <b>whorls</b> <b>of</b> needle-like <b>branches</b> radiating at regular intervals from a single vertical stem.|$|R
50|$|It is a hairy, glandular annual herb {{producing}} a stem with pairs or <b>whorls</b> <b>of</b> purple-brown <b>branches</b> {{no more than}} about 10 centimeters tall.

30|$|I made {{vegetation}} production {{measurements on}} 23 seedlings per burn site in June 2000 consisting of: 1) terminal internode stem diameter {{from the top}} of the seedling, taken at the top internode and representing growth in 1999; and 2) number of new needle bundles in the top <b>whorl</b> <b>of</b> all <b>branches,</b> representing growth in 2000. I considered all trees < 0.5 m in height to be seedlings for this study. I also sampled leaf tissue, from needle bundles produced in 1999, from each of these seedlings to measure total N content. The single, previous year measurement of stem diameter was used rather than overall height, since trees of the same height differed greatly in age between the 1880 and 1988 burns. Internode distances were tightly clumped in many of the seedlings in the 1880 burn, making it difficult to ascertain numbers of nodes and distances between them.|$|R
50|$|It is a {{herbaceous}} perennial plant, {{with separate}} green photosynthetic sterile stems, and pale yellowish non-photosynthetic spore-bearing fertile stems. The sterile stems, produced {{in late spring}} and dying down in late autumn, are 30-150 cm (rarely to 240 cm) tall (the tallest species of horsetail outside of tropical regions) and 1 cm diameter, heavily <b>branched,</b> with <b>whorls</b> <b>of</b> 14-40 <b>branches,</b> these up to 20 cm long, 1-2 mm diameter and unbranched, emerging from the axils of a ring of bracts. The fertile stems are produced in early spring before the sterile shoots, growing to 15-45 cm tall with an apical spore-bearing strobilus 4-10 cm long and 1-2 cm broad, and no side branches; the spores disperse in mid spring, with the fertile stems dying immediately after spore release. It also spreads by means of rhizomes that have been observed to penetrate 4 meters into wet clay soil, spreading laterally in multiple layers. Occasional plants produce stems that are both fertile and photosynthetic.|$|R
30|$|To {{control for}} {{possible}} confounding influences from adjacent understory plant effects, and {{to test for}} potential effects, I sampled seedlings growing with different common understory plants, {{as well as those}} growing on bare ground within the 1988 burn. Within the species associations, sampling was random. The associated species and sample sizes within the 1880 burn were: beargrass (Xerophyllum tenax [Pursh] Nutt.), n = 8; grouse whortleberry (Vaccinium scoparium Leiberg ex Coville), n = 10; and Hitchcock’s smooth woodrush (Luzula glabrata [Hoppe ex Rostk.] Desv. var. hitchcockii [Hämet-Ahti] Dorn), n = 5. Within the 1988 burn, the associated species and sample sizes were: beargrass, n = 4; grouse whortleberry, n = 9; bare ground, n = 10. No whitebark pine seedlings occurred adjacent to Hitchcock’s smooth woodrush within the 1988 burn, and fewer occurred adjacent to beargrass in the 1988 burn than in the 1880 burn. Due to the severity of the 1988 burn, much of the ground surface was bare, whereas vegetation covered nearly the entire 1880 burn area ground surface. To minimize the effect of size differences on growth rates, I selected seedlings 25 cm to 30 cm in height with three to five <b>whorls</b> <b>of</b> side <b>branches</b> per seedling, within each burn site.|$|R
5000|$|Good {{cultural}} practices to prevent pine-pine gall rust include removal of dense patches of grasses, weeds, and brush near susceptible trees, {{as they may}} prevent good spray coverage <b>of</b> the lower <b>whorl</b> (spiraling pattern) <b>of</b> <b>branches.</b> Severely infected trees should be rogued and burned to prevent further spread of inoculum. It {{is often difficult to}} detect infection in trees before symptoms such as stunting, chlorosis, and witches brooming are evident. Until all diseased trees in the area are diagnosed and destroyed it is suggested that a protectant fungicide be applied to all susceptible trees in the stand. Using a registered systemic fungicide such as Bayleton (50% Dry Flowable Fungicide, EPA Reg. No. 2135-320 [...] ) registered in California can help control western gall rust, although it is not used on seeds or seedlings and may kill mycorrhizal fungi if advised application concentration is exceeded.|$|R
50|$|The solitary {{inflorescence}} grows {{at the top}} <b>of</b> the <b>branches.</b> The large, slightly convex receptacle shows numerous, yellowish orange, hermaphrodite disc florets and two <b>whorls</b> <b>of</b> yellow ray florets. They flower from March to July.|$|R
50|$|A cyclic flower is {{a flower}} type formed {{out of a}} series of whorls; sets of {{identical}} organs attached around the axis at the same point. Most flowers consist <b>of</b> a single <b>whorl</b> <b>of</b> sepals termed a calyx; a single <b>whorl</b> <b>of</b> petals termed a corolla; one or more <b>whorls</b> <b>of</b> stamens (together termed the androecium); and a single <b>whorl</b> <b>of</b> carpels termed the gynoecium. This is a cyclic arrangement.|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{many members}} of the genus, A. schottii is a shrub rather than a vine, growing to 1.5 to 3 m (5-10 ft) tall and around 2 m (6-8 ft) wide. The {{elliptic}} to obovate leaves are arranged in <b>whorls</b> <b>of</b> 3-5 or are subopposite along the stem, and measure 2-14 cm long and 1.1-4 cm wide. The large yellow flowers are terminal (i.e. appearing at the ends <b>of</b> <b>branches),</b> and can appear year-round but predominantly in spring.|$|R
50|$|The suffix -cyclic is used {{to denote}} the number <b>of</b> <b>whorls</b> {{contained}} within a flower. The most common case is the pentacyclic flower, which contains five whorls: a calyx, a corolla, two <b>whorls</b> <b>of</b> stamens, and a single <b>whorl</b> <b>of</b> carpels. Another common case is the tetracyclic flower, which contains only one <b>whorl</b> <b>of</b> stamens, and therefore only four whorls in total. Tricyclic flowers also occur, generally {{where there is a}} single undifferentiated perianth. Flowers with more than five whorls are also not uncommon. The greatest variation occurs in the calyx and the androecium. Calyces of up to nine whorls have been recorded, and up to 12 <b>whorls</b> <b>of</b> stamens have been observed.|$|R

40|$|One {{hundred and}} seven half-sib {{families}} of Pinus pinaster planted at four sites in Galicia (NW Spain) were evaluated at age 8 for growth (height, diameter, volume and mean internode length), stem form (straightness, leaning, forking) and branching characteristics (branch diameter, angle and number and total number <b>of</b> <b>whorls).</b> The analyzed half-sib families {{were obtained from}} first-generation plus trees selected for the coastal area breeding programme in Galicia. Estimates of individual and family heritabilities and genetic correlation among traits are presented. Total height, average internode length, number <b>of</b> <b>whorls</b> and <b>branch</b> angle had moderate individual heritability estimates (0. 11 - 0. 37).
