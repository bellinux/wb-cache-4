40|$|Background: Very {{few studies}} from India have studied stigma {{experienced}} by patients with schizophrenia. Aim of the Study: To study stigma {{in patients with}} schizophrenia (in the form of internalized stigma, perceived stigma and social-participation-restriction stigma) and its relationship with specified demographic and clinical variables (demographic variables, clinical profile, <b>level</b> <b>of</b> psychopathology, knowledge about illness, and insight). Materials and Methods: Selected by purposive random sampling, 100 patients with schizophrenia in remission were evaluated on internalized stigma of mental illness scale (ISMIS), explanatory model interview catalog stigma scale, participation scale (P-scale), positive and negative syndrome scale for schizophrenia, global assessment of functioning scale, scale to assess unawareness of mental disorder, and knowledge of mental illness scale. Results: On ISMIS scale, 81 % patients experienced alienation and 45 % exhibited stigma resistance. Stereotype endorsement was seen in 26 % patients, discrimination experience was faced by 21 % patients, and only 16 % patients had social withdrawal. Overall, 29 % participants had internalized stigma when total ISMIS score was taken into consideration. On P-scale, 67 % patients experienced significant restriction, with a majority reporting moderate to mild restriction. In terms of associations between stigma and sociodemographic variables, no consistent correlations emerged, except {{for those who were}} not on paid job, had higher participation restriction. Of the clinical variables, <b>level</b> <b>of</b> functioning was the only consistent predictor of stigma. While better knowledge about the disorder was associated <b>with</b> <b>lower</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> stigma, there was no association between stigma and insight. Conclusion: Significant proportion of patients with schizophrenia experience stigma and stigma is associated <b>with</b> <b>lower</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> functioning and better knowledge about illness is associated <b>with</b> <b>lower</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> stigma...|$|R

The research found an increase in cortical thickness in the hippocampus, which controls learning, memory and emotion regulation. The research also found decreases in brain cell volume in the Amygdala, which is responsible for fear, anxiety and stress. These changes were also aligned with the participant's self-reports of their stress levels.|$|E
