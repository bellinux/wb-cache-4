This period symbolically started with the designation of Juan Carlos de Borbón as the natural successor of Franco in 1969, and ended with the death of the dictator. The object of study are the programming lists (the grills), as the primary source. The hypothesis is that the official television message was to show that modernity had come to Spain. The analysis aims to identify what kind of spaces were intended for that purpose. In this period a timid cultural openness begins. The formative spaces were quite limited and the only ones who remained were the programs focused on the divulgation of the Catholic faith.

40|$|Studies {{of normal}} {{individuals}} reveal an asymmetry in the folk concept of intentional action: an action {{is more likely}} to be thought of as intentional <b>when</b> it is <b>morally</b> bad than <b>when</b> it is <b>morally</b> good. One interpretation of these results comes from the hypothesis that emotion plays a critical mediating role in the relationship between an action’s moral status and its intentional status. According to this hypothesis, the negative emotional response triggered by a morally bad action drives the attribution of intent to the actor, or the judgment that the actor acted intentionally. We test this hypothesis by presenting cases of morally bad and morally good action to seven individuals with deficits in emotional processing resulting from damage to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPC). If normal emotional processing is necessary for the observed asymmetry, then individuals with VMPC lesions should show no asymmetry. Our results provide no support for this hypothesis: like normal individuals, those with VMPC lesions showed the same asymmetry, tending to judge that an action was intentional <b>when</b> it was <b>morally</b> bad but not <b>when</b> it was <b>morally</b> good. Based on this finding, we suggest that normal emotional processing is not responsible for the observed asymmetry of intentional attributions and thus does not mediate the relationship between an action’s moral status and its intentional status...|$|R

40|$|Humans desire {{a variety}} of things: food, safety, pleasure, friendship, play, beauty, and so forth. Included among these is knowledge. This thesis is {{partially}} about trying to understand this desire to know, {{often referred to as}} the "intellectual appetite," and the ends toward which it should be directed. Like other appetites, the intellectual appetite can be morally ordered or disordered. <b>When</b> <b>morally</b> ordered, it is referred to as the virtue of studiositas, and <b>when</b> <b>morally</b> disordered, the vice of curiositas. If human persons possess an intellectual appetite, if what they know affects how they live, and if they undergo some kind of formal education, then it is reasonable for individual learners to critically consider who or what is forming their intellectual appetites and what they expect formal academic institutions to help them accomplish. Though the purpose of education is a perennial concern, the debate has intensified and widened in recent decades. Many of the popular visions of education that shape student expectations, animate academic institutions, inform local communities, and determine public policy restrict the scope of the intellectual appetite's tutelage. These visions often regard people as either detached intellects, political citizens, marketplace labourers, technological innovators, or moral and spiritual agents, and orient the process of education accordingly. The tradition of theological reflection on education, known as the "didascalic tradition," provides resources for thinking that people are each of these and more. This work examines how three influential Christian educators from different centuries and settings defend educationâs intellectual, practical, and moral ends. Hugh of St. Victor, a leading teacher at the twelfth century Abbey of St. Victor, authored an influential work that integrated the liberal and servile arts with the Christian narrative of creation and restoration. Philip Melanchthon, known as the Praeceptor Germaniae, was a Protestant Humanist professor of Greek at the sixteenth century University of Wittenberg and curriculum designer for over eighty schools and universities across Europe. John Henry Newman was a fellow at nineteenth century Oriel College, Oxford, founding rector of the Catholic University of Dublin and the Oratory School in Birmingham, and author of three volumes and numerous essays on university education. 	 This thesis offers an integrated account of each educator's ideas and practices, synthesizes their major and minor works, compares and contrasts them with each other, and places them in dialogue with contemporary educational philosophers Martha Nussbaum and Stanley Fish. Both Nussbaum and Fish offer profound insights into education. However, Nussbaum's decision to harness the intellectual appetite for the political liberalism of John Rawls, and Stanley Fish's decision to harness it for the modern research university means that both fail to offer comprehensive accounts of education. In contrast, Hugh, Melanchthon, and Newman demonstrate that education can form the intellectual appetite to serve multi-dimensional intellectual, practical, and moral goods that foster human flourishing and the common good. </p...|$|R

Reasons skeptics doubt that we have any reason to act <b>morally</b> <b>when</b> we know that we can best realize our aims by acting immorally instead.

Meta-ethical moral skeptics accept the existence of moral knowledge but deny its objectivity. Responses to moral skepticism are legion, but each form continues to attract adherents.

For instance, the skeptic might accept that stealing from an innocent widow is mean, unfair, and thus immoral, but insist that he has no reason at all to refrain from the theft (see AMORALIST). A less extreme skeptic might allow that the immorality of the theft gives him some reason not to follow through on it, while maintaining that this consideration is easily “outweighed ” by the benefits of the wealth he can acquire through his misdeed (see REASONS FO...|$|R

A false belief theory of mind task as well as gender stereotype knowledge, tolerance, and flexibility tasks were administered to each participant.

40|$|In this {{dissertation}} I {{examine the}} technological advances benefiting health care today. I {{point to the}} fact that such progress is accompanied by a number of ethical concerns. With the assistance of technology, for example, the life of a patient in a persistent vegetative state (PVS) can be prolonged. This raises ethical questions including <b>when</b> we <b>morally</b> ought to, or ought not to, enable a patient to live or to die. Some ethicists attempt to answer such questions by distinguishing between the concept of person and human being. The former (ie person) automatically qualifies for moral consideration, whereas the latter (ie human being) does not. The concept of person, compared to human being, can offer a clearer benchmark for deciding whom to include in the moral domain. In the case of a patient in a PVS it may be easier to let go when we ascertain that s/he is no longer a person with any moral claims on us. Although the distinction between human being and person might be helpful in ethical decision-making, the concept of person tends to end up excluding a large number of human beings from the moral realm. In lieu of this, I outline a concept of person as a self-interpreting-dependent-vulnerable animal living within a reality that is mediated by meaning and constituted by significance. My concept attempts to dismantle the arbitrary boundaries of exclusion that are erected by contemporary definitions of person. Finally, I examine some of the implications of the concept of person for the European Charter of Patients’ Rights. I contend that the rights outlined can be logically denied to those who are not strictly persons Against this, I argue that my concept of person may provide a possible route to counteract the Charter from becoming an exclusive rather than an inclusive code...|$|R
