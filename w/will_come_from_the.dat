The East auditorium, which {{was the scene of}} the incident, will no longer be used for classes, and a replacement lecture hall will be built elsewhere on campus.

The selection of the twelve tribes {{does not include the}} names of Ephraim and Dan, although their names were used for the twelve tribes that settled in the Promised Land. It has been suggested that this could be because of their pagan practices.

The same argument, however, suggests that conclusive confirmation for Freudian hypotheses, {{as in the case of}} Darwin's, <b>will</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> outside <b>the</b> original domain of explanation sketched out by Freud.

25|$|According to the ACP, {{the canal}} expansion's impact on {{employment}} {{was first to}} be observed in jobs directly generated by its construction. Approximately 35,000–40,000 new jobs were created during {{the construction of the}} third set of locks, including 6,500–7,000 additional jobs that were directly related to the project during the peak years of construction. However, officials state that the most important impacts on employment will be medium and long term, and <b>will</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> economic growth brought about by extra income generated by the expanded canal and the economic activities produced by the increase in canal cargo and vessel transits.|$|E
25|$|The ROTSE-I {{telescope}} {{was part of}} {{the first phase of the}} Robotic Optical Transient Search Experiment, a worldwide collaboration. It has since been retired from use. The ROTSE-III telescope is designed to quickly observe gamma-ray bursts detected by satellites and other instruments. Its first response was on December 11, 2002. It consists of four 0.45-m robotic reflecting telescopes which together have a 15-degree field of view. ROTSE can use telemetry data from the NASA Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory to direct its array of cameras toward burst events as they occur. Alerts <b>will</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> BACODINE fast alert system developed at NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center. This system allows ROTSE to respond within 10 seconds of a burst onset.|$|E
25|$|Roughly speaking, the theorem {{states that}} {{although}} there are many series of results that may be produced by a random process, the one actually produced is most probably from a loosely defined set of outcomes that all have approximately the same chance of being the one actually realized. (This is a consequence of the law of large numbers and ergodic theory.) Although there are individual outcomes which have a higher probability than any outcome in this set, the vast number of outcomes in the set almost guarantees that the outcome <b>will</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> set. One way of intuitively understanding the property is through Cramér's large deviation theorem, which states that the probability of a large deviation from mean decays exponentially with the number of samples. Such results are studied in large deviations theory; intuitively, it is the large deviations that would violate equipartition, but these are unlikely.|$|E

500|$|The single reel drama, {{approximately}} 1,000 feet long, {{was released}} on July 1, 1910. An article in the The Moving Picture World gave a positive review, but recognized that the tensions amongst the Union and Confederate states of the Civil War could pose a concern for viewers and stated that no offense <b>will</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> showing of this patriotic picture. The reviewer {{said that it would}} please American audiences and foreign ones as well. This possibility of an audience taking offense over the content of the picture was a reasonable one because the film was within living memory. The movement and influence of members in the Grand Army of the Republic was strong and memberships still exceeded 200,000 persons in 1910. A review by The New York Dramatic Mirror stated, [...] "This is a sure enough 'classy' picture, full of human feeling and good acting. It is one of the kind that is giving the Thanhouser people the fine reputation they are gaining. ... The picture is strongly effective." [...] One advertisement billed the film as a patriotic masterpiece and would have musical accompaniment by the vaudeville musician Etta Hyland.|$|E
40|$|A common {{feature of}} free will is that a person has choices among {{alternative}} actions and chooses the action with the apparently most preferred consequences. In a determinist theory, the mechanism that makes the choice among the alternatives is determinist. The sensation of free <b>will</b> <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> fact that the mechanism that generates the choices uses a non-determinist theory as a computational device and that the stage in which the choices have been identified is introspectable. The present formalism is based on work in artificial intelligence (AI). We present a theory of simple deterministic free will (SDFW) in a deterministic world. The theory splits the mechanism that determines action into two parts. The first part computes possible actions and their consequences. Then the second part decides which action is most preferable and does it...|$|R

The comparison between Le Corbusier’s heavy block and Niemeyer’s startling, elegantly articulated composition {{seemed to me to}} be in everyone’s mind..." [...] Later on, Corbusier came once again to Niemeyer and asked him to reposition the Assembly Hall back to the center of the site. Such modification would destroy Niemeyer’s plans for a large civic square. However, he finally decided to accept the modification: [...] "I felt [...] would like to do his project, and he was the master. I do not regret my decision." [...] Together, they submitted the scheme 23–32, which was built and is what can be seen today. Along with suggestions from the other members of the Board of Design Consultants, this was developed into project 42G. [...] This late project was built with some reductions and other modifications.|$|E
500|$|Although {{originally}} intended as an unambiguous ending {{to the television}} series, the unexpected popularity and box office success of The Inbetweeners Movie led to speculation over {{the possibility of a}} sequel. These rumours began in early September 2011, while the film was still in cinemas, and were denied by its writers and actors. Around the same time, producer Christopher Young openly recognised the possibility of another film based on the series, claiming that [...] "if there is a sequel it <b>will</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> creative elements... We've talked about it. In the short term people are dispersing and doing other things but I'm sure in the medium term a sequel is very possible. It won't be immediate but it's definitely not closed." [...] Co-writer Damon Beesley later admitted [...] "we didn't know how successful it would be and that it would have a life on screen. But they did translate to big-screen characters, people did care about them and did go back and see it more than once – and that's very rare in cinema. The idea of not following that up seemed insane to most people". The actors had mixed emotions on making a sequel. Although Buckley and Thomas felt put off by the success of the first film, Harrison and Bird became convinced on reading the script.|$|E
