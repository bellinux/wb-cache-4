40|$|INTRODUCTION In the IEEE 802. 11 MAC {{protocol}} [1], virtual carrier-sense {{and physical}} carrier-sense functions {{are used to}} determine the availability of the shared medium. The medium is considered idle only when both of these two functions indicate that the medium is idle. While the physical carrier-sense function uses the physical layer to sense the carrier, the virtual carrier-sense function is based on the Network Allocation Vector (NAV). Most IEEE 802. 11 frames carry a duration field, which is used to reserve the medium for a fixed time period. The NAV is a timer that indicates the amount of time for which the medium has been reserved. Transmitting nodes set the NAV to the time for which they expect to use the medium, including the transmission time of all the frames in a sequence. Other nodes set up a process to count down the NAV. When the NAV is greater than zero, the virtual carrier-sense function indicates that the medium is busy.
