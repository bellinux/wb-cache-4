5|$|Brookwood {{was one of}} the few cemeteries {{to permit}} burials on Sundays, which made it a popular choice with the poor as it allowed people to attend {{funerals}} without the need to take a day off work. As theatrical performances were banned on Sundays at this time, it also made Brookwood a popular choice for the burial of actors for the same reason, to the extent that actors <b>were</b> <b>provided</b> <b>with</b> a dedicated section of the cemetery near the station entrance.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the pattern}} {{adopted by the}} earlier tube lines, each of the UERL's lines was {{constructed}} {{as a pair of}} circular tunnels using tunnelling shields with segmental cast iron tunnel linings bolted together and grouted into place as the shield advanced. Generally the tunnels followed surface roads and were constructed side by side, but where the width of the road above was insufficient, tunnels were placed one above the other. Stations on all three lines <b>were</b> <b>provided</b> <b>with</b> surface buildings designed by the UERL's architect Leslie Green in a standardised style modified for each site. These consisted of two-storey steel-framed buildings faced with red glazed terracotta blocks with wide semi-circular windows on the upper floor. The stations had flat roofs and were designed to accommodate upward extension for commercial development. Most stations <b>were</b> <b>provided</b> <b>with</b> between two and four lifts and an emergency spiral staircase in a separate shaft.

5|$|A {{new wave}} of reforms {{supported}} by progressive magnates such as the Czartoryski family and King Stanisław August were introduced at the Partition Sejm.

5|$|An {{extensive}} {{repair and}} recovery plan was {{enacted by the}} Government of the Cook Islands within a month of Cyclone Pat, which covered agricultural, infrastructural, and societal sectors. Financial restraints hindered the expected progress of this operation, with {{more than two-thirds of}} it not being funded by the final plan report on March4. Of the NZ$15million (US$10.6million) in home damage, NZ$7.2million (US$5.1million) was covered. New Zealand later provided a NZ$5.5million (US$3.9million) grant to assist in this effort. Priority was placed on repairing damaged homes, with lesser emphasis on destroyed ones. Labor costs would ultimately reach NZ$6million (US$4.2million) for this project. Finalization of the funding for reconstruction was delayed and had not started by early June, with some residents still living in tents. Farmers <b>were</b> <b>provided</b> <b>with</b> NZ$195,000 (US$138,000) worth of seeds, seedlings, and various supplies to jump-start agricultural recovery. Since the majority of the island's electrical grid was destroyed, an earlier plan to convert the network to underground cables was accelerated due to a convenience factor.|$|E
5|$|By May1, {{the local}} {{branch of the}} Red Cross {{distributed}} essential supplies to residents in Labutta Township. In coordination with the Disaster Assistance Response Team, the areas in greatest need for aid were identified and requests for tarpaulin were made. Members of the Cabinet of Burma donated 3.7million kyat (US$2,960) in cash and 140bags of rice to victims in the Ayeyarwady Region. On May3, another 1.7million kyat (US$1,360) was donated by social organizations to residents in rural areas outside Yangon. Temporary shelters were set up across Gwa Township. Local donations provided residents in the town with 200,000kyat (US$160) worth of blankets, clothes, and cash. A local newspaper, The New Light of Myanmar, claimed that government officials immediately provided assistance to affected residents across the country. Red Cross operations continued through November30, by which time 3,485families <b>were</b> <b>provided</b> <b>with</b> aid. Additionally, though the agency planned to assist 4,000families with rebuilding their homes, a lack of necessary funds prevented the operation. Instead, a cash donation was provided to the 1,000most affected families.|$|E
5|$|Converts <b>were</b> <b>provided</b> <b>with</b> {{elaborate}} {{details of}} Ernest and Ruth Norman's purported spiritual visits to other planets.

Ruth stated that she had lived about 50lives over several million years; she recalled being several well-known and a few obscure people on Earth, as well as beings from other planets and an archangel. Their group developed a mythology from the accounts that Ernest and Ruth gave of these lives, including tales from their past incarnations in Atlantis and Lemuria. Some of their stories were similar to the plots of contemporary books and films, prompting Tumminia to cast their beliefs as a pastiche or bricolage of the surrounding culture.|$|E
