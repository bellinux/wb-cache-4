5|$|In 1871, Nikolai Zaremba {{resigned}} from the directorship of the Saint Petersburg Conservatory. His successor, Mikhaíl Azanchevsky, was more progressive-minded musically and wanted new blood to freshen up teaching in the Conservatory. He offered Rimsky-Korsakov a professorship in Practical Composition and Instrumentation (orchestration), as well as leadership of the Orchestra Class. Balakirev, who had formerly opposed academicism <b>with</b> <b>tremendous</b> vigor, encouraged him to assume the post, thinking it might be useful having {{one of his own}} {{in the midst of the}} enemy camp.|$|E
5|$|The infrequency of Tchaikovsky's musical successes, won <b>with</b> <b>tremendous</b> effort, {{exacerbated}} {{his lifelong}} sensitivity to criticism. Nikolai Rubinstein's private fits of rage critiquing his music, most famously attacking the First Piano Concerto, {{did not help}} matters. His popularity grew, however, as several first-rate artists became willing to perform his compositions. Hans von Bülow premiered the First Piano Concerto and championed other Tchaikovsky works both as pianist and conductor. Other artists included Adele Aus der Ohe, Max Erdmannsdörfer, Eduard Nápravník and Sergei Taneyev.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Lawton (6 October 1919– 6 November 1996) was an English {{football}} player and manager. A strong centre-forward with excellent all-round attacking skills, {{he was able}} to head with the ball <b>with</b> <b>tremendous</b> power and accuracy. Despite losing much of his best years to World War II, he scored 260 goals in 433 league and cup competitions in 14 full seasons in the Football League.|$|E

5|$|Rimsky-Korsakov {{explained}} {{in his memoirs}} that Mikhaíl Azanchevsky had taken over that year {{as director of the}} Conservatory, and wanting new blood to freshen up teaching in those subjects, had offered to pay generously for Rimsky-Korsakov's services. Biographer Mikhail Zetlin suggests that Azanchevsky's motives might have been twofold. First, Rimsky-Korsakov was the member of the Five least criticized by its opponents, and inviting him to teach at the Conservatory may have been considered a safe way to show that all serious musicians were welcome there. Second, the offer may have been calculated to expose him to an academic climate in which he would write in a more conservative, Western-based style. Balakirev had opposed academic training in music <b>with</b> <b>tremendous</b> vigor, but encouraged him to accept the post to convince others to join the nationalist musical cause.|$|E
5|$|Though the {{scholarship}} {{was extended to}} permit Sullivan to spend one year in Leipzig, he stayed for three years. There, he became friendly with the impresario Carl Rosa and the violinist Joseph Joachim. For his last year at Leipzig, his father scraped together the money for living expenses, and the conservatoire assisted by waiving its fees. Sullivan credited his Leipzig period <b>with</b> <b>tremendous</b> musical growth. His graduation piece, completed in 1861, was a set of incidental music to Shakespeare's The Tempest. Revised and expanded, it was performed at the Crystal Palace in 1862, a year after his return to London, and was an immediate sensation. He began building a reputation as England's most promising young composer.|$|E
5|$|Yellowstone National Park spans {{an area of}} , {{comprising}} lakes, canyons, {{rivers and}} mountain ranges. Yellowstone Lake {{is one of the}} largest high-elevation lakes in North America and is centered over the Yellowstone Caldera, the largest supervolcano on the continent. The caldera is considered an active volcano. It has erupted <b>with</b> <b>tremendous</b> force several times in the last two million years. Half of the world's geothermal features are in Yellowstone, fueled by this ongoing volcanism. Lava flows and rocks from volcanic eruptions cover most of the land area of Yellowstone. The park is the centerpiece of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, the largest remaining nearly-intact ecosystem in the Earth's northern temperate zone.|$|E

5|$|Raszagal was the matriarch of the Nerazim on Shakuras, {{and mother}} to Vorazun. The {{character}} appears in Brood War, {{where she is}} voiced by Debra DeLiso, and in the novel Shadow Hunters. Described {{as one of the}} oldest living Protoss and imbued <b>with</b> <b>tremendous</b> psychic powers, {{she is one of the}} few to clearly remember the Protoss homeworld from before the exile of the Nerazim. During her youth, Raszagal was important in ensuring the dark templar were only exiled, rather than exterminated. In Brood War, Raszagal directs Zeratul and Artanis to cleanse the Zerg from Shakuras and welcomes Sarah Kerrigan as an ally in their mission. This spurs Aldaris to rebellion; Raszagal consequently orders his death. Kerrigan and Samir Duran later kidnap Raszagal from Shakuras, using her to blackmail Zeratul into killing the second Overmind. It quickly becomes apparent that Kerrigan has mentally subverted Raszagal and has been using her to manipulate events from the beginning. Zeratul captures Raszagal, but is unable to hold off the Zerg forces long enough to escape. Realizing that the matriarch is beyond redemption from Kerrigan's influence, Zeratul kills Raszagal. Raszagal's mind is freed by the lethal blow, and she dies thanking Zeratul for releasing her, naming him as her successor as leader of the dark templar.|$|E
5|$|Wales – {{which had}} been conquered centuries earlier, but had {{remained}} a separate dominion – was annexed to England under the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542. Henry VIII's son and successor, the young Edward VI, continued with further religious reforms, but his early death in 1553 precipitated a succession crisis. He was wary of allowing his Catholic elder half-sister Mary I to succeed, and therefore drew up a will designating Lady Jane Grey as his heiress. Jane's reign, however, lasted only nine days; <b>with</b> <b>tremendous</b> popular support, Mary deposed her and declared herself the lawful sovereign. Mary I married Philip of Spain, who was declared king and co-ruler, pursued disastrous wars in France, and attempted to return England to Roman Catholicism, burning Protestants at the stake as heretics in the process. Upon her death in 1558, the pair were succeeded by her Protestant half-sister Elizabeth I. England returned to Protestantism and continued its growth into a major world power by building its navy and exploring the New World.|$|E

25|$|Coral reef {{fish are}} fish which live amongst or in close {{relation}} to coral reefs. Coral reefs form complex ecosystems <b>with</b> <b>tremendous</b> biodiversity. Among the myriad inhabitants, the fish {{stand out as}} colourful and interesting to watch. Hundreds of species can exist in a small area of a healthy reef, many of them hidden or well camouflaged. Reef fish have developed many ingenious specialisations adapted to survival on the reefs.|$|E

25|$|Often, Armstrong re-composed pop-tunes he played, simply with {{variations}} {{that made}} them more compelling to jazz listeners of the era. At the same time, however, his oeuvre includes many original melodies, creative leaps, and relaxed or driving rhythms. Armstrong's playing technique, honed by constant practice, extended the range, tone and capabilities of the trumpet. In his records, Armstrong almost single-handedly created {{the role of the}} jazz soloist, taking what had been essentially a collective folk music and turning it into an art form <b>with</b> <b>tremendous</b> possibilities for individual expression.|$|E
25|$|Hamilcar, {{grandson}} of Hanno the Great, led the Carthaginian response and met <b>with</b> <b>tremendous</b> success. By 310 BC, he controlled {{almost all of}} Sicily and had laid siege to Syracuse itself. In desperation, Agathocles secretly led an expedition of 14,000 men to the mainland, hoping to save his rule by leading a counterstrike against Carthage itself. In this, he was successful: Carthage was forced to recall Hamilcar {{and most of his}} army from Sicily to face the new and unexpected threat. Although Agathocles's army was eventually defeated in 307 BC, Agathocles himself escaped back to Sicily and was able to negotiate a peace which maintained Syracuse as a stronghold of Greek power in Sicily.|$|E
25|$|Kiffin's {{defenses}} {{were known}} as gang tacklers <b>with</b> <b>tremendous</b> team speed with a front four that could pressure the quarterback consistently, fast sideline-to-sideline linebackers, and a hard-hitting secondary that caused turnovers. Many teams have copied the Tampa 2, but none have {{come close to the}} success the Buccaneers experienced led by numerous Pro Bowlers and Hall of Famers. The Tampa Bay defense featured future Hall of Famers, Derrick Brooks and Warren Sapp, and Pro Bowlers, John Lynch, Ronde Barber, Hardy Nickerson, Simeon Rice, Shelton Quarles, Donnie Abraham, and Super Bowl XXXVII MVP Dexter Jackson. Sapp and Nickerson were named to the 1990s All-Decade 2nd Team while the 2000s All-Decade Team featured Sapp and Brooks as 1st Team players and Ronde Barber on the 2nd Team.|$|E

25|$|Odrade next calls {{a meeting}} of all the Bene Gesserit, announcing her plan to attack the Honored Matres. She tells them that this attack will be led by Teg. She also announces {{candidates}} to succeed her as Mother Superior; she will share her memories with Murbella and Sheeana before she leaves. Odrade then goes to meet the Great Honored Matre. Under cover of Odrade's diplomacy, the Bene Gesserit forces under Teg attack Gammu <b>with</b> <b>tremendous</b> force. Teg uses his secret ability to see no-ships to secure control of the system. Survivors of the attack flee to Junction, and Teg follows them there and carries all with him. Victory for the Bene Gesserit seems inevitable. In {{the midst of this}} battle, the Jews (including Rebecca with her precious memories) take refuge with the Bene Gesserit fleet.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, {{the column}} under Seras {{encountered}} opposition on the 15th when {{it reached the}} Predil Pass blockhouse. While Eugène crushed Gyulai's command on 17 May, Seras bombarded the Predil fort without effect. Engineer Captain Johann Hermann von Hermannsdorf commanded the garrison of two companies of the 1st battalion of the Szluiner Grenz Infantry Regiment Nr. 3. In order to bring his artillery, cavalry, and wagon trains to Tarvis, Eugène needed to use Predil Pass. He sent three battalions south to attack Hermann's bastion from the pass while Seras drove in from the other side. The French assault began on 18 May and met <b>with</b> <b>tremendous</b> resistance. Hermann and {{every single one of}} the 250 Croat defenders were killed in their last stand. Out of 8,500 infantry and 12 guns, Franco-Italian losses were about 450 killed and wounded.|$|E
25|$|In July 1801 Dundas was {{in command}} of Calpe at the Battle of Algeciras Bay. After the third-rate HMS Hannibal grounded, Dundas, deceived by a signal from her, sent his boats to save Hannibals crew. The French {{detained}} the boats and their crews, including Calpes lieutenant, Thomas Sykes; after firing several broadsides at the enemy's shipping and batteries, Dundas and Calpe returned to Gibraltar. In the subsequent {{second phase of the}} Battle of Algeciras Bay, the two Spanish first-rates Real Carlos and Hermenegildo fired upon each other during the night, caught fire and exploded, <b>with</b> <b>tremendous</b> loss of life. The British captured the third-rate St Antoine, with Superb and Calpe then assisting in securing the prize and removing the prisoners. Rear Admiral James Saumarez promoted Dundas to post-captain on 9 August 1801 and Dundas took command of St Antoine, which he sailed back to England.|$|E
