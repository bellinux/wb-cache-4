Right now it's more that Lane's having a baby and Billy might be selling his house. Just all sorts of crazy shit like that. We're waiting to see when would be the best time that we could leave for two and half months.|$|E

Later in the series he ends up {{stealing}} the Field Guide and hiding it, believing this {{will be for the}} better. However, {{at the end of the}} books he is ultimately friendly and apparently becomes friends with Hogsqueal. He is able to make himself visible and invisible to humans at will, though only when he has to; saying, [...] "Now you don't see us, now you do, but only <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> you to." ...|$|E

2500|$|In [...] {{immediately}} following / preceding ones that bear primary or secondary stress, we pronounce an œ ~ oe ~ e as an (unrounded) unstressed vowel, that is, as the unstressed one {{that sounds like}} “short I” or instead of it for some dialects as shwa, the examples being: tragœdy, (arch)diœcese; œconomisation, œsophageal; œsophagus, œcologist, œcology, œconomise, œconomist, œconomy, œdema, œnologist, œnology, ..., pœnology, and Phœnicia(n). [...] As another option (except in the first subset, that is, save in tragœdy and (arch)diœcese), especially <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> to enunciate more clearly, we alternatively add an additional (secondary) stress on this vowel and then pronounce it as long E.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{important}} {{to be able to keep}} track of future intentions and plans, and most importantly, individuals need to remember to actually carry out such intentions and plans. [...] This memory for future events is prospective memory. [...] Prospective memory includes forming the intention to carry out a particular task in the future, which action we’re going to use to carry out the action, and <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> to do it. [...] Thus, prospective memory is in use continuously in day to day life. [...] For example, prospective memory is in use when you decide that you need to write and send a letter to a friend.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the nineteenth}} century when Europe began to expand across the globe and {{establish}} colonies, ancient Greece and Rome were used {{as a source of}} empowerment and justification to Western civilizing mission. At this period, many French and British imperial ideologues identified strongly with the ancient empires and invoked ancient Greece and Rome to justify the colonial civilizing project. They urged European colonizers to emulate these “ideal” classical conquerors, whom they regarded as “universal instructors”. For Alexis de Tocqueville (1805-1859), an ardent and influential advocate of la “Grande France,” the classical empires were model conquerors to imitate. He advised the French colonists in Algeria to follow the ancient imperial example. In 1841, he stated: ‘what matters most <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> to set up and develop a colony {{is to make sure that}} those who arrive in it are as less estranged as possible, that these newcomers meet a perfect image of their homeland….the thousand colonies that the Greeks founded on the Mediterranean coasts were all exact copies of the Greek cities on which they had been modelled. The Romans established in almost all parts of the globe known to them municipalities which were no more than miniature Romes. Among modern colonizers, the English did the same. Who can prevent us from emulating these European peoples?’. The Greeks and Romans were deemed exemplary conquerors and “heuristic teachers”, whose lessons were invaluable for modern colonists ideologues. John-Robert Seeley (1834-1895), a history professor at Cambridge and proponent of imperialism stated in a rhetoric which echoed that of Renan that the role of the British Empire was ‘similar to that of Rome, in which we hold the position of not merely of ruling but of an educating and civilizing race.” ...|$|E
2500|$|As Marla Heasley recounts in Bring Back... The A-Team (May 18, 2006), {{although}} sexism was not prevalent {{on the set}} per se, {{there was}} a sense that a female character was not necessary on the show. On her first day on set George Peppard took her aside and told her [...] "We don't want you on the show. None of the guys want you here. The only reason you're here is because the network and the producers want you. For some reason they think they need a girl." [...] The interview continues with Heasley noting that on her last day of work Peppard took her aside again, saying: [...] "I'm sorry that this is your last day, but remember what I said the very first day, that <b>we</b> didn't <b>want</b> a girl, has nothing to do with you. You were very professional, but no reason to have a girl." [...] In Bring Back... the A-Team, Dirk Benedict also remarked that: [...] "It was a guy's show. It was male driven. It was written by guys. It was directed by guys. It was acted by guys. It's about what guys do. We talked the way guys talked. We were the boss. We were the God. <b>We</b> smoked <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted.</b> <b>We</b> shot guns <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted.</b> <b>We</b> kissed the girls and made them cry... <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted.</b> It was the last truly masculine show." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] {{said the}} cook {{handling}} the basket with satisfaction, [...] "it is a pity, friend, {{that you did}} not bring this stuff here a while ago <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> it sorely and found it hard to come by in this barren, sword-wasted land." ...|$|R

6000|$|In late Latin it {{is called}} 'petiolus,' the little foot; because the {{expanding}} piece that holds the grape, or olive, {{is a little like}} an animal's foot. Modern botanists have misapplied the word to the leaf-stalk, which has no resemblance to a foot at all. We must keep the word to its proper meaning, and, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> to write Latin, call it 'petiolus;' <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> to write English, call it 'stalk,' meaning always fruit or flower stalk. {131} ...|$|E

6000|$|... "We {{have missed}} you so, John. <b>We</b> have <b>wanted</b> you so much. Lucy and Kate and Deby {{were so bad}} yesterday, and they did cry so for you. We were all so hungry.

5000|$|... "We {{were even}} short of goods brake vans. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> {{to run a}} trip out to Moredon power station with coal we had a special brake van kept for the job—it was an old water tank.

6000|$|... "Another {{flight of}} steps, Meinik. I am {{beginning}} {{to hope that}} we shall find some way out, at the top. If we can do so, it will make us safe.

6000|$|... "Well, time rolled on, and matters grew {{worse than}} ever: winter came, and was colder {{to us than}} any other winter, for our clothes were thinner and more torn; mother {{sometimes}} could find no work, for the fields in which she labored were hidden under the snow; so that <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> them most <b>we</b> had them least--warmth, work, or food.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, of course! {{we could}} {{get rid of the}} stairs," [...] I agreed. [...] "It would be a bit awkward at first, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> to go to bed. But I daresay we should get used to it. We could have a ladder and climb up to our rooms through the windows. Or we might adopt the Norwegian method and have the stairs outside." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{said one}} of the newcomers. [...] "We have horses back yonder. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> mules or cowsteerers, I guess we'll find them here. You seem to have quite a few of them around." ...|$|E

5000|$|Mad editor Nick Meglin commented, [...] "I {{think of}} all the artists weve had, we miss Jack the most. Jack had so many styles, such a total command of all techniques.

5000|$|In 2013, Blackwood was {{featured}} in the song [...] "Lonesome Rider" [...] from the Danish heavy metal band Volbeat's fifth album Outlaw Gentlemen & Shady Ladies. The band's frontman Michael Poulsen told Ultimate-Guitar.com: [...] "She's {{formerly known as the}} frontperson in Creepshow, which is a Canadian rockabilly band, and now she's in a band called Walk Off The Earth. We knew her from back <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> to bring Creepshow on tour." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{coronation}} on `Swiss Family' lines, I suppose," [...] said Michael, laughing. [...] "Oh, I {{know you}} would find everything in that atmosphere. If <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> such a simple thing, for instance, as a Coronation Canopy, we should walk down beyond the geraniums and find the Canopy Tree in full bloom. If <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> such a trifle as a crown of gold, why, we should be digging up dandelions, and we should find a gold mine under the lawn. And <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> oil for the ceremony, why I suppose a great storm would wash everything on shore, and we should find there was a Whale on the premises." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This is {{the worst}} blow of all," [...] said {{the leader of the}} club, {{referring}} to the matches and the ammunition. [...] "We can't stay here without ammunition and the wherewith to make a fire <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{is a nice}} beach {{right around}} the edge of the island," [...] said old Jerry. [...] "So, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> to visit the other islands, we can walk around on the sand. That is better than {{climbing}} the hill." ...|$|E

5000|$|Each summer, Hines toured {{with his}} whole band for three months, {{including}} through the South - {{the first black}} big band to do so. He explained, [...] "when we traveled by train through the South, they would send a porter back to our car {{to let us know}} when the dining room was cleared, and then we would all go in together. <b>We</b> couldn't eat <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> to. <b>We</b> had to eat when they were ready for us." ...|$|R
60|$|JOHN FOXE (1516-1587). Foxe will {{be remembered}} always for his famous Book of Martyrs, a book that our elders gave to us on Sundays <b>when</b> <b>we</b> were young, {{thinking}} it good discipline for us to afflict our souls <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> to be roaming the sunlit fields, or when in our enforced idleness we would, if our own taste in the matter had been consulted, have made good shift to be quiet and happy with Robinson Crusoe. So we have a gloomy memory of Foxe, and something of a grievance, which prevent a just appreciation of his worth.|$|R
6000|$|... "So did I," [...] {{said the}} mother herself, [...] "when I {{remember}} how {{we used to}} sit round with the lamp in the middle, and spin the whole table <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> a drawer on the further side. But it won't bring back those who sat there! and now the light falls anywhere but where it is wanted, and our goods get into each other's way! Yes, Babie, you may dispose {{of it in the}} back drawing-room and bring in your whole generation of little tables." ...|$|R
