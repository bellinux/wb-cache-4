The second user who accesses the home page will <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> next IP address, and the third user will <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> third IP address.

Other fibers <b>are</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ventromedial (VM) nucleus of the thalamus, which projects <b>to</b> <b>the</b> insular cortex.

30|$|Previous {{studies on}} {{parallel}} broadcast channels {{have focused on}} scenarios in which independent messages <b>are</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> receivers (parallel unicast channels) [7 – 10].

Some other studies have considered parallel broadcast channels in which simultaneous common and independent messages <b>are</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> receivers [5, 12, 13], or simultaneous common and confidential messages <b>are</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> receivers [14].|$|R
