Where are <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> throw Marxism, which actually invented the dustbins of history? (Yet there is some justice here since the very people who invented them have fallen in.) Conclusion: if there are no more dustbins of history, this is because History itself has become a dustbin. It has become its own dustbin, just as the planet itself is becoming its own dustbin.|$|E

[...] He emphasized his {{record and the}} UFA's, pointing to the province's improving financial position and to its involvement {{in the establishment of}} the Alberta Wheat Pool. [...] He touted the period since the last election as [...] "five years of progress". [...] In keeping with the UFA's view of good government as being the non-partisan administration of business rather than any clash of ideologies, he concluded his speeches by asking [...] "Are <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> return in this Province to Government based on the two-party system, or are <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> continue to work for a better ?" ...|$|E

500|$|However, {{before their}} visits to United States in 1964 the Beatles still doubted {{that they could}} bring {{anything}} new to the country.

500|$|Stunt {{coordinator}} Tanner Gill {{explained that}} the hotel in which the climactic fighting takes place was designed specifically with the fights in mind, saying [...] "The basic environment of the fight had to be constructed to be “stunt friendly.” The space was tailored. Each corner was rounded; surfaces were measured for height and size, then padded." [...] Elaborating on this, fight choreographer Matt Mullins stated, [...] "The main fight starts in a hallway, and then we move into a penthouse. Okay, we have a hallway and a penthouse—what can we do with that? Are <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> crash into some walls? Are <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> go into a kitchen? We see what we would get in terms of props, we take into consideration what the actors can do, move-wise—in our case, Ming-Na is exceptionally talented, so {{we can do a}} lot of different martial arts movement with her." ...|$|E
500|$|The threat eliminated, Quatermass quickly {{walks out}} of the Abbey, preoccupied by his thoughts. He ignores all who ask questions.

He leaves Marsh behind, walking into the London night, and sometime later a second manned rocket roars into space.|$|E

500|$|Originally set for {{a single}} {{theatrical}} release, the idea to split the book into two parts was suggested by executive producer Lionel Wigram due to what David Heyman called [...] "creative imperative". Heyman initially responded negatively to the idea, but Wigram asked, “No, David. How are <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do it?”. After rereading the book and discussing it with screenwriter Steve Kloves, he agreed with the division.|$|E
500|$|Dark Horse's Buffy the Vampire Slayer-related comics {{feature the}} lesbian {{characters}} of Willow, Tara and Kennedy and the closeted character Andrew {{from the television}} series. The Buffy Season Eight comics attracted media attention when the title character has a one night stand with another girl who {{had fallen in love}} with her. The encounter was repeated, but both the character and the creators denied that this made Buffy gay, with Joss Whedon saying: [...] "We're not going to make her gay, nor are <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> take the next 50 issues explaining that she's not. She's young and experimenting, and did I mention open-minded?".|$|E
500|$|Gig 'em: Both {{a saying}} and the thumbs up hand gesture of all Texas A University {{current and former}} {{students}} as sign of affiliation. Gig 'em also {{is the name of}} an Aggie yell. This tradition began at a 1930 Midnight Yell Practice held before the football game against the Texas Christian University Horned Frogs. In an attempt to excite the crowd, Pinky Downs, a 1906 Texas A graduate and member of the school's Board of Regents, asked the crowd [...] "What are <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do to those Horned Frogs?" [...] Using a term for frog hunting, he answered his own question, [...] "Gig 'em, Aggies!".|$|E

When asked about the constructs created from the power rings, Campbell stated [...] "One of the nice things is, we'll all sit down and say, 'Well, what are <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do here?' Really, it's as much as your imagination can go to make the constructs". The studio also confirmed to MTV News {{that the film}} would have a 3-D release.|$|E

[...] Shikasta gave rise to a religious cult in America.

In the final five games (in which Tech went 1–4), the Hokie defense allowed averages of 32.8points, 446.7total yards and 229.4rushing yards per game. This led to doubts about Tech's ability to stop the Falcons' top-ranked rushing attack.

It’s no longer predicated around 24 hour news. There are so many different choices. Half of it is online now. Now you’ve got the 'Gawker's, the 'Buzzfeed's. The way people are drawing their news is soundbites and headlines and click-bait links has changed everything.

500|$|Movement by {{the astronauts}} was {{detected}} by the spacecraft's inertial measurement unit and the astronaut's biomedical sensors, and also indicated by increases in oxygen spacesuit flow, and sounds from Grissom's stuck-open microphone. There was no evidence to identify the movement, {{or whether it was}} related to the fire. [...] The stuck microphone was part of a problem with the communications loop connecting the crew, the Operations and Checkout Building, and the Complex 34 blockhouse control room. The poor communications led Grissom to remark: [...] "How are <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> get to the Moon if we can't talk between two or three buildings?" [...] The simulated countdown was held again at 5:40pm while attempts were made to troubleshoot the communications problem.

500|$|Matthews {{said that}} they did not have any {{particular}} influences in their music. However, she said that her family had always been singing along to BBC Radio 2. She held the ambition to have the band appear on Radio 2, as due to poor levels of radio reception in Wales they had been unable to listen to other stations. She attributed the style of Welsh music as never attempting to be cool as they wouldn't have been aware of what was in fashion at the time. Catatonia frequently used metaphors in their songwriting, such as [...] "Road Rage" [...] which references emotional anger. The line [...] "If it turns to blue, what are <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do?" [...] in the single [...] "You've Got A Lot To Answer For" [...] from Way Beyond Blue references a pregnancy test.
