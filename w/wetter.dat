5|$|Within {{the forest}} habitat, the red-winged fairywren prefers <b>wetter</b> gullies and {{riverside}} sword sedge (Lepidosperma effusum). It borders {{the range of}} the variegated fairywren on the northern limit of its range, and the blue-breasted fairywren in the eastern limit, with the latter two species occupying dryer scrub while the red-winged fairywren is restricted to <b>wetter</b> forests. The lack of intermediate forms reinforces the status of all three taxa as separate species.|$|E

5|$|During the Late Archaic period, {{the climate}} became <b>wetter</b> again and by {{approximately}} 3000 BCE {{the rise of}} water tables allowed an increase in population.

5|$|Humans {{arrived in}} the Florida {{peninsula}} approximately 15,000years ago. Paleo-Indians came to Florida probably following large game that included giant sloths, saber-toothed cats, and spectacled bears. They found an arid landscape that supported plants and animals adapted for desert conditions. However, 6,500years ago, climate changes brought a <b>wetter</b> landscape; large animals became extinct in Florida, and the Paleo-Indians slowly adapted and became the Archaic peoples. They conformed to the environmental changes, and created many tools with the various resources available. During the Late Archaic period, the climate became <b>wetter</b> again, and approximately 3000 BCE the rise of water tables allowed an increase in population and cultural activity. Florida Indians developed into three distinct but similar cultures that were named for the bodies of water near where they were located: Okeechobee, Caloosahatchee, and Glades.|$|E
5|$|Just before half time, a try by Newport's Jack <b>Wetter</b> was {{disallowed}} for {{a forward}} pass. The ball was then worked back to Fred Birt, standing within range {{in front of}} the posts, and he kicked a drop-goal, putting the home side 4–0 ahead at the break. In the second half, the Springboks repeatedly attacked but the Newport defence kept them from crossing the line, although a break from Dick Luyt, the South African centre, left Douglas Morkel to score under the posts. Luyt failed to convert and Newport remained a point ahead. Newport scored again through a cross-kick from <b>Wetter,</b> which Birt jumped on over the line for a try, which he then converted.|$|E

5|$|The Dinosaur Park Formation is {{interpreted}} as a low-relief setting of rivers and floodplains that became more swampy and influenced by marine conditions over time as the Western Interior Seaway transgressed westward. The climate was warmer than present-day Alberta, without frost, but with <b>wetter</b> and drier seasons. Conifers were apparently the dominant canopy plants, with an understory of ferns, tree ferns, and angiosperms.|$|E
5|$|The {{evergreen}} {{forests in}} Wayanad mark the transition zone between {{the northern and}} southern ecologic regions of the Western Ghats. The southern ecologic regions are generally <b>wetter</b> and more species-rich. At lower elevations are the South Western Ghats moist deciduous forests, with Cullenia the characteristic tree genus, accompanied by teak, dipterocarps, and other trees. The moist forests transition to the drier South Deccan Plateau dry deciduous forests, which lie in its rain shadow to the east. Above 1,000 meters are the South Western Ghats montane rain forests, also cooler and <b>wetter</b> than the surrounding lowland forests, and dominated by evergreen trees, although some montane grasslands and stunted forests {{can be found at the}} highest elevations. The South Western Ghats montane rain forests are the most species-rich ecologic region in peninsular India; eighty percent of the flowering plant species of the entire Western Ghats range are found in this ecologic region.|$|E

5|$|Across North America during La Niña, {{increased}} precipitation is diverted {{into the}} Pacific Northwest {{due to a}} more northerly storm track and jet stream. The storm track shifts far enough northward to bring <b>wetter</b> than normal conditions (in the form of increased snowfall) to the Midwestern states, as well as hot and dry summers. Snowfall is above normal across the Pacific Northwest and western Great Lakes. Across the North Atlantic, the jet stream is stronger than normal, which directs stronger systems with increased precipitation towards Europe.|$|E
5|$|All of {{the fossil}} sites that have yielded Velociraptor remains {{preserve}} an arid environment with fields of sand dunes and only intermittent streams, although the younger Barun Goyot environment {{seems to have}} been slightly <b>wetter</b> than the older Djadochta.

5|$|During the Palladian revival {{period in}} Ireland, even quite modest mansions were {{cast in a}} neo-Palladian mould. Palladian {{architecture}} in Ireland subtly differs from that in England. While adhering as in other countries to the basic ideals of Palladio, it is often truer to them – perhaps because it was often designed by architects who had come directly from mainland Europe, and therefore were not influenced by the evolution that Palladianism was undergoing in Britain. Whatever the reason, Palladianism still had to be adapted for the <b>wetter,</b> colder weather.|$|E

5|$|Ice ages {{during the}} Pleistocene brought a cooler and <b>wetter</b> pluvial climate {{to the region}} {{starting}} 2 to 3million years ago. The added precipitation increased runoff and the erosive ability of streams (especially from spring melt water and flash floods in summer). With a greatly increased flow volume the Colorado cut faster than ever before and started to quickly excavate the Grand Canyon 2million years before present, almost reaching the modern depth by 1.2million years ago.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} Middle Ages, average {{temperatures}} began to reduce again, with cooler and <b>wetter</b> conditions limiting {{the extent of}} arable agriculture, particularly in the Highlands. The introduction of new monastic orders such as the Cistercians in this period also brought innovations in agriculture. Their monasteries became major landholders, particularly in the Borders. They were sheep farmers and producers of wool for the markets in Flanders. By the late Middle Ages, Melrose Abbey and the Earl of Douglas had about 15,000 sheep apiece, making them among the largest sheep farmers in Europe.|$|E
5|$|None of the {{varieties}} of Banksia sphaerocarpa are commonly seen in cultivation. They are difficult {{to grow in the}} <b>wetter</b> conditions of Australia's east coast. Trials with grafting have been very limited and results have been poor. Otherwise, they adapt well to gardens with good drainage, sandy soils and sunny aspects in drier and Mediterranean (winter moisture) climates, and are also frost tolerant. They are good bird-attracting plants, and flower when not much else is in flower. Seeds do not require any treatment prior to sowing, and take 20 to 48 days to germinate.|$|E

5|$|Pleistocene {{climate is}} harder to determine, though it was {{probably}} not much <b>wetter</b> than today, except in the mountains where precipitation increased.

40|$|This {{research}} {{aimed to}} {{study the effects of}} land reclamation (drying, <b>wetting,</b> flushing, and leaching) on the change of soil chemical properties of acid sulphate soils from Kalimantan. Randomized Complete Design (RCD) by two factors treatments with two replications is used in this research. Factor I was soil reactiveness that is define as (a) low reactive= R 1; (b) moderate reactive =R 2; (c) strong reactive= R 3, and (d) very strong reactive= R 4 respectively. Factor II was drying, <b>wetting,</b> and diluting that is define as (1) drying continuously after <b>wetting</b> = W 1, (2) <b>wetting</b> continuously = W 2; (3) drying after weeting and diluting =W 3; and (4) <b>wetting</b> and diluting. The result of experiments show that continuous drying after <b>wetting</b> (W 1) and drying after <b>wetting</b> and diluting (W 3) or continuous weeting (W 2) gave soils pH lower than the weeting and diluting (W 4). Dried on the strong reactive soils (R 4) not decrease soil pH significantly. The continouos drying after <b>wetting</b> (W 1) can increase EC (electrical conductivity) higher than the continous <b>wetting</b> (W 2) and <b>wetting</b> that followed diluting (W 4) or drying after <b>wetting</b> and diluting (W 3). The continouos <b>wetting</b> (W 2) and the continouos drying after <b>wetting</b> (W 1) has given the total soluble acidity of 63, 30 dan 61, 71 cmolc kg- 1 respectively, higher than drying after <b>wetting</b> and diluting (W 3) and <b>wetting</b> thatfollowed diluting (W 4) that given total soluble acidity of 54, 03 and 51, 95 cmolc kg- 1 respectively. The effects of drying, <b>wetting,</b> flushing, and leaching on the total soluble acidity, Soluble Al and soluble H, especially on the strong reactive soils are very significant. All of the exchangeble bases (Ca, Mg, K, Na) on the continouos drying after <b>wetting</b> (W 1) are lower than the continous <b>wetting</b> (W 2) and <b>wetting</b> that followed diluting (W 4) or drying after <b>wetting</b> and diluting (W 3) respectively. The continouos drying after <b>wetting</b> (W 1), the continous <b>wetting</b> (W 2) and <b>wetting</b> that follow diluting (W 4) or drying after <b>wetting</b> and diluting (W 3) decrease exchangable Mg, especially on strong reactive soils (R 4), but contradictive to low reactive soils (R 1). The continouos drying after <b>wetting</b> (W 1) increase exchangable Na, especially on low reactive soils (R 1), but the <b>wetting</b> that followed diluting (W 3, W 4) decreases exchangable Na...|$|R
