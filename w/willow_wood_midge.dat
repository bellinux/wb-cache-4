40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to analyze the kinetic {{parameters}} (activation energy Ea, pre-exponential coefficient A, rate constant k) of thermolysis in torrefied and raw <b>willow</b> <b>wood</b> (Salix viminalis L.), as well as to determine the effect of thermal mo-dification conditions on the kinetics of this process. Samples of raw and torrefied <b>willow</b> <b>wood</b> in a steam atmosphere were analysed. The samples were subjected to thermogravimetric analysis under isothermal conditions. Analyses were conducted in an atmosphere of helium at 270 – 330 °C. TG and DTG curves were recorded. The thermal characteristics of the samples were based on thermogravimetric analysis under dynamic conditions at a temperature of up to 600 °C. On the basis of the data obtained from the TGA analyses, the kinetic parameters were calculated and stati-stical and mathematical analyses of the results were performed...|$|R

40|$|Mortality factors {{affecting}} a Lymantria dispar (L.) (Lepidoptera Lymantriidae) population in a <b>willow</b> <b>wood</b> {{next to the}} Po River (northern Italy) were studied from 1997 to 2007. In that period population density of L. dispar was low, ranging from 5. 5 egg masses / 100 trees to 18. 8 egg masses/ 100 trees. <b>Willow</b> <b>woods</b> are not the most suitable habitat for gypsy moth populations, which rarely increase to an epidemic level on this host. Mortality {{is affected by the}} action of several natural enemies: Anastatus japonicus Ashmead (egg parasitoid), Dermestes lardarius L. (egg predator) and Compsilura concinnata (Meigen) (larval parasi-toid). An important control factor is represented by floods, which lay a sediment of mud {{at the base of the}} trees, so burying egg masses laid near to the soil. In addition, the flooding water, which is rich of suspended solids, leaves a layer of sludge on the sur-face of the bark, which can suffocate egg masses. The percentage of egg masses which did not hatch at all (100 % mortality) be-cause of sludge left on the bark was 17. 2 % in 1999 and 64. 7 % in 2000. Outbreaks of the gypsy moth can rarely occur when the effects of both natural enemies and floods are simultaneously reduced...|$|R
