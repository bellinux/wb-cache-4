40|$|ABSTRACT This {{study was}} carried out to develop {{mulberry}} <b>wines</b> fermented <b>with</b> <b>traditional</b> microorganisms (Saccharomyces cerevisiae B- 8). S. cerevisiae B- 8 is a traditional fermentation microorganism isolated from domestically grown Rubus occidentalis. Each S. cerevisiae B- 8 and Fermivin was inoculated into mulberry up to 1 × 109 CFU/kg, followed by incubation at 25 °C for 10 days. Mulberry fermented with S. cerevisiae B- 8 (MBB) had a high alcohol content (16. 47 %), and the fermentation rate of MBB was faster than that of mulberry fermented with Fermivin (MBF). The total polyphenol and flavonoid contents of MBB were {{higher than those of}} MBF. DPPH radical scavenging activit...|$|R

40|$|Version of Record online: 22 SEP 2015 In the community, wine is {{sometimes}} considered responsible for adverse reactions. Commonly reported reactions to wine include skin flushing, itching and nasal congestion. A {{review of the}} literature was undertaken to identify adverse food reactions from wine, including those related to residues from egg, fish, milk, or nut processing aids and additives used in winemaking. Relatively limited literature was found reporting true allergic reactions following the ingestion of wine. This paper also examines what is known about the potential of egg, fish, milk, nut and other food proteins used in wine production to cause an allergic reaction to wine. It can be cautiously concluded that <b>wine</b> made <b>with</b> <b>traditional</b> proteinaceous processing aids, according to good manufacturing practice, poses little risk to the health of adult consumers with food allergies.

40|$|A poly(3, 4 -ethylendioxythiophene) {{modified}} electrode {{has been}} considered as a potentially useful amperometric sensor to use either alone or {{in the frame of}} a set of sensors bearing complementary information, i. e. within an electronic tongue. The sensor is proposed in blind analysis of red wines, for classificationand calibration purposes. The data obtained from voltammetric measurements have been treated using partial least squares analysis. A calibration procedure has been performed to correlate results from analyses of <b>wines,</b> executed <b>with</b> <b>traditional</b> analytical methods, <b>with</b> the corresponding voltammetricresponses. Moreover, classification models of the wine samples, based on quantitative parameters and qualitative information about origin and variety, have been built. The developed electrochemical sensor also allows the fast identification of samples exceeding threshold limits of meaningful parameters forquality control in the wine industry, such as SO 2, colour intensity and total polyphenols. The application of the system within a sensor array (electronic tongue) to fast pre-screening routine control procedure is proposed...|$|R
40|$|This study {{compared}} {{two different}} top designs for a wine box {{to determine which}} design gave the structure more durability. The {{results showed that the}} Twist ‘N Give, a new corrugated <b>wine</b> box design <b>with</b> a twist top, appeared to be weaker. The Twist ‘N Give is an alternative choice to the existing corrugated <b>wine</b> box <b>with</b> a <b>traditional</b> tuck top style. The experimental research method was used for this study. Two samples of each style of top, the twist top and the tuck top, were tested on the Lansmont Squeezer Compression Tester for the peak force and the deflection peak. The test process was destructive. The results show that the <b>wine</b> box <b>with</b> the twist top style appears to be weaker than the box with the tuck top style. However, additional testing needs to be performed, with a larger sampling of each style of top in order to verify results...|$|R

40|$|Teran PTP is a {{protected}} <b>wine</b> <b>with</b> a recognized <b>traditional</b> denomination produced from a grapevine variety ‘Refošk’ in winegrowing district Kras in Slovenia (European Union, 2009; Pravilnik, 2008). The aromatic profile of 82 Teran PTP wines produced in years 2011, 2012 and 2013 was monitored. Intotal {{the content of}} 16 volatile compounds was determined. The volatile compounds from wine were extracted following the liquid-liquid extraction and determined with a GC-MS method. The odour activity values and relative odour contributions were calculated for each volatile compound identified. Among sensorial important volatiles the highest odour activity values were determined for ethyl octanoate, ethyl hexanoate, isoamyl acetate and ethyl butyrate. Other research papers also showed, that all red wines investigated except one contained ethyl octanoate, ethyl hexanoate, isoamyl acetate and ethyl butyrate above sensory thresholds. </p...|$|R

50|$|Improvements in cork and {{winemaking}} methodology {{continue to}} strive {{to lower the}} incidence, but the media attention given to cork taint has created a controversy in the winemaking community, <b>with</b> <b>traditional</b> cork growers {{on one side and}} the makers of newer synthetic closures and screw caps on the other. Screw caps and synthetic corks, however, are thought be prone to another aroma taint: sulphidisation. This may arise from the reduced oxygen supply which concentrates sulphurous smells arising from <b>wines</b> <b>with</b> universal preservatives, however it is more likely that these wines contain excessive/imbalanced amounts of sulphite based preservatives to begin with.|$|R
