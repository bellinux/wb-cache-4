All 30 tons of liquid steel, which was at a temperature of approximately 1,500 degrees Celsius (2,730 F), was spilled. This liquid steel then burst through the windows and door of an adjoining room five meters away where workers had gathered during a change of shifts, engulfing that room entirely.|$|E

They initially fight each other, during which Brad is cut, but ultimately choose to allow Dina to die instead.|$|E
2500|$|Milling is {{the complex}} shaping of metal or other {{materials}} by removing material {{to form the}} final shape. It is generally done on a milling machine, a power-driven machine that in its basic form consists of a milling cutter that rotates about the spindle axis (like a drill), and a <b>worktable</b> that can move in multiple directions (usually two dimensions [...] relative to the workpiece). The spindle usually moves in the z axis. [...] It is possible to raise the table (where the workpiece rests). [...] Milling machines may be operated manually or under computer numerical control (CNC), and can perform {{a vast number of}} complex operations, such as slot cutting, planing, drilling and threading, rabbeting, routing, etc. Two common types of mills are the horizontal mill and vertical mill.|$|E

40|$|Background: The most {{frequent}} viral diseases {{which can cause}} abortion in sheep are Blue tongue, Border disease virus, Cache Valley fever and Schmallenberg virus. The diagnosis of abortion, namely virus-induced represents a challenge to field clinicians, since clinical signs presented by the dam are discrete, non-specific and variable (Agerhom et al., 2015). On the other hand, while some foetuses reveal characteristic and visible malformations, others do not reveal any lesions. In face of it, definitive diagnosis requires an appropriate history collection, as well as sending fresh samples, namely abortion material, foetus, placenta and umbilical cord, to a specialty laboratory, to obtain a precise diagnosis. Objectives: The authors suggest a registration method of all mandatory data, {{in order to further}} assist the diagnosis of viral diseases at the laboratories, including the {{most frequent}} congenital malformations reported in sheep abortions. Methods: Abortion samples of suspected viral origin were collected and all data were registered, in <b>worktables</b> optimized for this purpose. Results: The authors document, using macroscopic figures lesions of malformations in abortions, emphasizing the frequency and the importance of documenting each case, proposing practical and effective <b>worktables</b> to assist the fieldwork. Conclusions: Field clinician’s awareness of the importance of early detection of viral diseases causing abortion outbreaks stimulates a proper data collection for each case of abortion, in order to contribute to a precise diagnosis and posterior consistent epidemiological studies, which may allow diminishing of economic losses...|$|R

60|$|The pleasantest room in {{the house}} was set apart for Beth, and in it was {{gathered}} everything that she most loved, flowers, pictures, her piano, the little <b>worktable,</b> and the beloved pussies.

No matter what he talked about, Archie always saw the glossy black braids {{on the other side of}} the table, the damask cheek curving down into the firm white throat, and the dark lashes, lifted now and then, showing eyes so deep and soft he dared not look into them long. Even the swift needle charmed him, the little brooch which rose and fell with her quiet breath, the plain work she did, and the tidy way she gathered her bits of thread into a tiny bag. He seldom spoke to her; never touched her basket, though he ravaged Rose's if he wanted string or scissors; very rarely ventured to bring her some curious or pretty thing when ships came in from China only sat and thought of her, imagined that this was his parlor, this her <b>worktable,</b> and they two sitting there alone a happy man and wife.|$|E
50|$|Twenty years later, the {{building}} {{was in need of}} several updates. In fact, the original design planned for future expansion to the facility. A $29.6 million renovation started in May 2002, and was part of the 2001-2005 Hennepin County Capital Improvement Plan. The library’s tab for the 18-month long remodeling was $18 million. Upon reopening, the library’s new footprint is 53,155 square feet (an increase of 22,000 square feet). The updates included 144 public access computers, a cyber café-styled teen zone, and space for an additional 50,000 books (making the collection about 150,000). The library is organized around “information neighborhoods” which marries collection materials with the right mix of technology, <b>worktables</b> and chairs. Throughout, daylight filters in from large windows. Dedicated spaces are available for quiet study, meeting rooms, and a conference room.|$|R
50|$|The GLW studios {{were noted}} for being large and open, in {{contrast}} to other teaching studios with smaller booths. A small “building within a building” was erected as the office and studio space, and this was adjacent to the workshop floor.

A bank of power tools, consisting of table saws, bandsaws, sanding stations, drill press, etc., was located along the north wall of the warehouse. Wood storage was located on the southwest perimeter of the shop, and due to the variety of tone woods being used, was very aromatic.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{evidence}} of baking occurred when humans took wild grass grains, soaked them in water, and mixed everything together, mashing {{it into a}} kind of broth-like paste. The paste was cooked by pouring it onto a flat, hot rock, resulting in a bread-like substance. Later, when humans mastered fire, the paste was roasted on hot embers, which made bread-making easier, as it could now be made any time fire was created. The world's oldest oven was discovered in Croatia in 2014 dating back 6500 years ago. The Ancient Egyptians baked bread using yeast, which they had previously been using to brew beer. Bread baking began in Ancient Greece around 600 BC, leading to the invention of enclosed ovens. [...] "Ovens and <b>worktables</b> have been discovered in archaeological digs from Turkey (Hacilar) to Palestine (Jericho) and date back to 5600 BC." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{watched and}} waited for three months, {{so that he might}} not be accused of precipitation, though it did not take him one to decide that this was the woman to make him happy. Her steadfast nature, quiet, busy ways, and the {{reserved}} power and passion betrayed sometimes by a flash of the black eyes, a quiver of the firm lips, suited Archie, who possessed many of the same attributes himself. The obscurity of her birth and isolation of her lot, which would have deterred some lovers, not only appealed to his kindly heart, but touched the hidden romance which ran like a vein of gold through his strong common sense and made practical, steady-going Archie a poet when he fell in love. If Uncle Mac had guessed what dreams and fancies went on in the head bent over his ledgers, and what emotions were fermenting in the bosom of his staid [...] "right-hand man," [...] he would have tapped his forehead and suggested a lunatic asylum. The boys thought Archie had sobered down too soon. His mother began to fear that the air of the counting room did not suit him, and Dr. Alec was deluded into the belief that the fellow really began to [...] "think of Rose," [...] he came so often in the evening, seeming quite content to sit beside her <b>worktable</b> and snip tape or draw patterns while they chatted.|$|E
6000|$|Strange infatuation of passion--singular perversity of reason! At some {{period before}} his marriage, it not unfrequently happens {{that a man}} {{actually}} is fond of his mother-in-law! At this time our good General vowed, and with some reason, that he was jealous. Mrs. Lambert made much more of George than of any other person in the family. She dressed up Theo to the utmost advantage {{in order to meet}} him; she was for ever caressing her, and appealing to her when he spoke. It was, [...] "Don't you think he looks well?"--"Don't you think he looks pale, Theo, to-day?"--"Don't you think he has been sitting up over his books too much at night?" [...] and so forth. If he had a cold, she would have liked to make gruel for him and see his feet in hot water. She sent him recipes of her own for his health. When he was away, she never ceased talking about him to her daughter. I dare say Miss Theo liked the subject well enough. When he came, she was sure to be wanted in some other part of the house, and would bid Theo take care of him till she returned. Why, before she returned to the room, could you hear her talking outside the door to her youngest innocent children, to her servants in the upper regions, and so forth? When she reappeared, was not Mr. George always standing or sitting at a considerable distance from Miss Theo--except, to be sure, on that one day when she had just happened to drop her scissors, and he had naturally stooped down to pick them up? Why was she blushing? Were not youthful cheeks made to blush, and roses to bloom in the spring? Not that mamma ever noted the blushes, but began quite an artless conversation about this or that, as she sate down brimful of happiness to her <b>worktable.</b>|$|E

60|$|So the {{furniture}} of Fulk's rooms in London--most {{of which he}} had had at Oxford--my own piano, our books, and various little <b>worktables,</b> chairs, pictures, and knicknacks appertained to us; also, we brought what belonged to the little one's nursery, and put him in the large room. His grand nurse--Earl though he was--could not stand the change; but old Blake, who was retiring into a public house, as he could do nothing else for us, suggested his youngest sister, who became the comfort of my life, for she was the widow of a small farmer, and could give me plenty of sound counsel as to how much pork to provide for the labourers, and how much small beer would keep them in good heart, and not make them too merry. And she had too much good sense to get into rivalry with Susan Sisson, the hind's wife, who lived in a kind of lean-to cottage opening into the farm-yard, and was the chief (real) manager of the dairy and poultry--though such was not Jaquetta's view of the case by any manner of means.|$|R
40|$|Abstract ： The {{piezoelectric}} actuator demonstrates superior {{characteristics of}} high displacement resolution, miniature size, high-frequency response, strong power, no generate heat etc, So {{it is used}} in nano systems widely. But its inherent hysteresis, creep and non-linearity affect positioning accuracy seriously. In this paper, through the investigative experiment of a large travel piezoelectric actuator <b>worktable’s</b> creep characteristics, creep characteristic curve and {{the rules of the}} piezoelectric actuator creep were found. Based on the rules of the piezoelectric actuator creep characteristics, the piezoelectric actuator creep resistance driving method of two-level reversely applied voltage could remarkably reduce the creep error of system, namely, applying stepped voltage reversely according to two stages. The experiments show that the creep error of the system has been reduced from 3. 80 % to 0. 26 %, the period of creep tends to be stable, and also has been shortened within 10 seconds. This driving method make the quick and precise piezoelectric actuator positioning control with large displacement become possible. It also provides further scientific method to amend and reduce the creep effect of piezoelectric actuator, and improves the positioning accuracy of the system...|$|R
