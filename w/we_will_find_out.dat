40|$|Abstract. State-of-the-art {{automatic}} speaker recognition systems use mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) {{features to}} describe the spectral properties of speakers. In forensic phonetics, the long-term average spectrum (LTAS) {{has been used for}} the same purpose. LTAS provides an intuitive graphical representation which can be used to visualize and quantify speaker differences. However, few studies have reported the use of LTAS in automatic speaker recognition. Thus, {{the purpose of this paper}} is to systematically study how to use the LTAS in automatic speaker recognition. <b>We</b> <b>will</b> also <b>find</b> <b>out</b> whether it provides additional discriminative information in respect to the MFCC-based system. ...|$|R

50|$|The Hopfield model {{accounts}} for associative memory through {{the incorporation of}} memory vectors. Memory vectors can be slightly used, and this would spark the retrieval of the most similar vector in the network. However, <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> that due to this process, intrusions can occur. In associative memory for the Hopfield network, {{there are two types}} of operations: auto-association and hetero-association. The first being when a vector is associated with itself, and the latter being when two different vectors are associated in storage. Furthermore, both types of operations are possible to store within a single memory matrix, but only if that given representation matrix is not one or the other of the operations, but rather the combination (auto-associative and hetero-associative) of the two. It is important to note that Hopfield’s network model utilizes the same learning rule as Hebb’s (1949) learning rule, which basically tried to show that learning occurs as a result of the strengthening of the weights by when activity is occurring.|$|E
5000|$|Krogh {{wrote the}} {{following}} in his 1929 treatise on the then current 'status' of physiology (emphasis added): ...I {{want to emphasize}} that the route by which we can strive toward the ideal is by a study of the vital functions in all their aspects throughout the myriads of organisms. We may find out, nay, <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> before very long the essential mechanisms of mammalian kidney function, but the general problem of excretion can be solved only when excretory organs are studied wherever we find them and in all their essential modifications. Such studies will be sure, moreover, to expand and deepen our insight into problems of the human kidney and will prove of value also from the narrowest utilitarian point of view.For such a large number of problems there will be some animal of choice or a few such animals on which it can be most conveniently studied. Many years ago when my teacher, Christian Bohr, was interested in the respiratory mechanism of the lung and devised the method of studying the exchange through each lung separately, he found that a certain kind of tortoise possessed a trachea dividing into the main bronchi high up in the neck, and we used to say as a laboratory joke that this animal had been created expressly for the purposes of respiration physiology. I have no doubt that there is quite a number of animals which are similarly [...] "created" [...] for special physiological purposes, but I am afraid that most of them are unknown to the men for whom they were [...] "created," [...] and we must apply to the zoologists to find them and lay our hands on them."August Krogh The Progress of Physiology, The American Journal of Physiology, 1929. 90(2) pp. 243-251 ...|$|E

From the calculation of the steady state of the distribution network <b>we</b> <b>will</b> probably <b>find</b> <b>out</b> that some parts of the system are overloaded. Therefore we suggest changes for it (like switching over circuits, installation of new transformer stations and circuits), which should ensure safety and reliability of operations in the distribution system...|$|R
