5|$|Madonna: Tears of a Clown {{are ongoing}} shows by American singer Madonna. The first show {{was held at}} the Forum Theatre in Melbourne, Australia on March 10, 2016. The singer had not {{included}} Australia during her previous five concert tours, until the Rebel Heart Tour (2015–2016), so she created the show for her Australian fans since they had <b>waited</b> <b>so</b> long for her to perform there. Madonna explained that the idea behind Tears of a Clown was to combine music and storytelling, being influenced by clowns. Tickets for the first show were made available to members of Madonna's official fan club, Icon, and were non-transferable, with the person's name printed on them.|$|E

25|$|Another {{account of}} this story was {{published}} in 1929. In this account the Marlborough was found adrift in January 1899 by the ship British Isles under Captain Hadrop. The British Isles was purportedly sailing from Lyttleton to England. She was a little north of Cape Horn by Staten Island when the Marlborough was sighted and boarded. This story was discounted {{because there were no}} reports of the British Isles visiting Lyttleton in the time period, and it was improbable that Hadrop would have <b>waited</b> <b>so</b> many years to report the sighting.|$|E

25|$|In 1899, Glazunov {{became a}} {{professor}} at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory. In the wake of the 1905 Russian Revolution and firing, then re-hiring of Rimsky-Korsakov that year, Glazunov became its director. He remained so until the revolutionary events of 1917, which culminated on 7 November. His Piano Concerto No. 2 in B major, Op.100, which he conducted, was premiered at the first concert held in Petrograd after that date. After the end of World War I, he was instrumental in the reorganization of the Conservatory—this may, in fact, have been the main reason he <b>waited</b> <b>so</b> long to go into exile. During his tenure he worked tirelessly to improve the curriculum, raise the standards for students and staff, as well as defend the institute's dignity and autonomy. Among his achievements were an opera studio and a students' philharmonic orchestra.|$|E
500|$|Some Confederate congressmen were {{believed}} to oppose Breckinridge because he had <b>waited</b> <b>so</b> long to join the Confederacy, but his nomination was confirmed unanimously on February 6, 1865. At 44 years old, he was the youngest person {{to serve in the}} Confederate president's cabinet. Klotter called Breckinridge [...] "perhaps the most effective of those who held that office", but Harrison wrote that [...] "no one could have done much with the War Department at that late date". While his predecessors had largely served Davis's interests, Breckinridge functioned independently, assigning officers, recommending promotions, and consulting on strategy with Confederate generals.|$|E
500|$|Aside {{from the}} album's lyrical themes, its {{production}} and musicianship were widely praised, Schaffner noting: [...] "Surely Phil Spector {{never had a}} more attentive pupil." [...] Carr and Tyler lauded Harrison's [...] "superb and accomplished slide-guitar breaks", and the solos on [...] "Give Me Love", [...] "The Lord Loves the One", [...] "The Light That Has Lighted the World" [...] and [...] "Living in the Material World" [...] have each been identified as exemplary and among the finest of Harrison's career. In his book The Beatles Apart (1981), Woffinden wrote: [...] "Those who carped at the lyrics, or at Harrison himself, missed {{a great deal of}} the music, much of which was exceptionally fine." [...] Woffinden described the album as [...] "a very good one", Harrison's [...] "only mistake" [...] being that he had <b>waited</b> <b>so</b> long before following up his successes over 1970–71.|$|E

Page wrote that the conspiracy doesn't explain why the conspirators <b>waited</b> <b>so</b> long to bring forth the accusations, with the scandal unfolding many years after Cosby abandoned the purchase. Dick Gregory was a supporter of this theory.|$|E

2500|$|Lyons {{points up}} {{the dark side}} as well. The decade-long liaison with Mrs. O'Shea was a {{disaster}} waiting to happen, and Parnell had made no preparations for it. He <b>waited</b> <b>so</b> long because of money – there was an expectation that Mrs. O'Shea would receive a large inheritance from her elderly aunt who might have changed her will if she had known about the affair. In {{the aftermath of the}} divorce he fought violently to retain control in a hopeless cause. Thereby he ruined his health and wrecked his movement; it never fully recovered. The bottom line for Lyons, however, is positive: ...|$|E

2500|$|On April 7, 1865, at {{the second}} Battle of High Bridge, after the bulk of Lee's {{remaining}} army crossed the Appomattox River, Longstreet's rear guard burned the bridges behind them. The Union II Corps managed to extinguish the blazes {{on two of the}} bridges, and they crossed the river and caught up with the Confederates at Farmville. Fitzhugh Lee's cavalry was able to hold off the Union infantry until nightfall, but Lee was forced to continue his march to the west under this pressure, depriving his men the opportunity to eat the Farmville rations they had <b>waited</b> <b>so</b> long to receive. Their next stop would be Appomattox Station, [...] west, where a ration train was waiting. However, this train would be mostly destroyed by Union troops before their arrival.|$|E
2500|$|In {{order to}} create more time for Bellini to finish, the La Fenice {{impresario}} Lanari padded the programme with older works or revivals, but that allowed only eight days for Beatrice before the scheduled end of the season. Not surprisingly, the audience having <b>waited</b> <b>so</b> long for the new work, greeted the opening night on 16 March with little enthusiasm, their rejection demonstrated by cries of Norma! upon hearing Pasta's first aria, Ma la sola, oimė! son io, / che penar per lui si veda? ("Am I {{the only one to}} whom he has brought grief?"), thinking that they heard echoes of the music from the earlier opera. Their indifference was magnified after reading Romani's plea for [...] "the reader's full indulgence" [...] which appeared in the libretto with the suggestion that its faults were not his. But at the following two performances there were large crowds. For Bellini, his opera [...] "was not unworthy of her sisters".|$|E
2500|$|Lashing back at {{the press}} who had been {{severely}} critical of his personal response and the entire government's handling of a national tragedy, Putin attacked the messengers. During the meeting with the crew's relatives, he loudly blamed the oligarchs, who owned most of the country's non-government media, for the poor state of Russia's military. Putin told the family members, [...] "There are people in television today who... over the last 10 years destroyed the very army and fleet where people are dying now... They stole money, they bought the media, and they're manipulating public opinion." [...] When relatives asked why the government had <b>waited</b> <b>so</b> long before accepting foreign assistance, Putin said the media had lied. He shouted to the assembled families, [...] "They're lying. They're lying. They're lying." [...] Putin threatened to punish the media owners and counter their influence through alternative [...] "honest and objective" [...] media. He scornfully derided their ownership of property abroad. [...] "They'd better sell their villas on the Mediterranean coast of France or Spain. Then {{they might have to}} explain why all this property is registered in false names under front law-firms. Perhaps we would ask them where they got the money." ...|$|E

2500|$|Such was {{the passion}} {{that the first}} Tour created in spectators and riders that Desgrange said the 1904 Tour de France would be the last. Cheating was rife and riders were beaten up by rival fans as they neared {{the top of the}} col de la République, {{sometimes}} called the col du Grand Bois, outside St-Étienne. The leading riders, including the winner Maurice Garin, were disqualified, though it took the Union Vélocipèdique de France until 30 November to make the decision. McGann says the UVF <b>waited</b> <b>so</b> long [...] "...well aware of the passions aroused by the race." [...] Desgrange's opinion of the fighting and cheating showed in the headline of his reaction in L'Auto: THE END. Desgrange's despair did not last. By the following spring he was planning another Tour, longer at 11 stages rather than 6 – and this time all in daylight to make any cheating more obvious. Stages in 1905 began between 3am and 7:30am. The race captured the imagination. L'Auto's circulation rose from 25,000 to 65,000; by 1908 it was a quarter of a million. The Tour returned after its suspension during World War One and continued to grow, with circulation of L'Auto reaching 500,000 by 1923. The record claimed by Desgrange was 854,000 during the 1933 Tour. Le Vélo, meanwhile, went out of business in 1904.|$|E
2500|$|The wings {{themselves}} are sometimes {{said to be}} highly modified (tracheal) gills. And {{there is no doubt}} that the tracheal gills of the mayfly nymph in many species look like wings. By comparing a well-developed pair of gill blades in the naiads and a reduced pair of hind wings on the adults, it is not hard to imagine that the mayfly gills (tergaliae) and insect wings have a common origin, and newer research also supports this. [...] The tergaliae are not found in any other order of insects, and they have evolved in different directions with time. In some nymphs/naiads the most anterior pair has become sclerotized and works as a gill cover for the rest of the gills. Others can form a large sucker, be used for swimming or modified into other shapes. But it doesn't have to mean that these structures were originally gills. It could also mean that the tergaliae evolved from the same structures which gave rise to the wings, and that flying insects evolved from a wingless terrestrial species with pairs of plates on its body segments: three on the thorax and nine on the abdomen (mayfly nymphs with nine pairs of tergaliae on the abdomen exist, but so far no living or extinct insects with plates on the last two segments have been found). If these were primary gills, it would be a mystery why they should have <b>waited</b> <b>so</b> long to be modified when we see the different modifications in modern mayfly nymphs.|$|E
