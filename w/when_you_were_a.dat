500|$|Jon Blisten of Beats Per Minute wrote a {{retrospective}} {{review of the}} album in 2011, regarding Enema of the State a seminal album of Generation Y and [...] "one of those rare records {{that allows you to}} relive , a record where every song conjures up a specific memory or emotion that you could have only felt <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> teenager." [...] Billboard described the album as a [...] "classic" [...] in {{a retrospective}} review, calling it the [...] "catchiest batch of songs the band had ever written," [...] and commending the leap in quality both in production and vocals in comparison to its predecessor.|$|E
500|$|Just {{like the}} text—which was mostly written {{on top of}} {{photographs}}—the photographs on the book are highly sexual and depict nudity, [...] simulations of sexual acts, bondage, homosexuality and analingus, with accessories such as knives, whips, masks and chains; however, full intercourse is never shown. Aside from unknown models, featured in the book are actress Isabella Rossellini, rappers Big Daddy Kane and Madonna's then boyfriend Vanilla Ice, model Naomi Campbell, gay porn star Joey Stefano, actor Udo Kier, socialite Tatiana von Fürstenberg, and nightclub owner Ingrid Casares; however the heterosexual photos in the book involve only Madonna and Vanilla Ice. Madonna herself is featured partially or completely naked. One of the book's most famous photographs shows Madonna hitchhiking completely naked in Miami. The book also reflects a great part on Dita's perspective towards her own sexuality. Dita writes in Sex that her [...] "pussy" [...] is a temple of learning and that exposing it, is really a homage to it ("It's hard to describe it smells like a baby to me fresh and full of life. I love my pussy, it is the complete summation of my life"). Sex contains statements like [...] "ass fucking is the most pleasurable way to get fucked and it hurts the most too". Others include [...] "here is something comforting about being tied up. Like <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> baby and your mother strapped you in the car seat. She wanted you to be safe. It {{was an act of}} love" [...] and [...] "I wouldn't want a penis. It would be like having a third leg. it seems like a contraption that would get in the way. I think I have a dick in my brain". In Sex, Dita also pointed out that [...] "A lot of people are afraid to say what they want. That's why they don't get what they want". The book includes Madonna's perspective on pornography: ...|$|E

2500|$|Following Elder's re-registering as a Republican, in a 2008 {{interview}} with The New Individualist Magazine he said, [...] "A {{lot of my}} listeners will often call up and say, 'I preferred you <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> Libertarian.' I always tell them I never was a 'capital-L Libertarian.' I am still 'small-l.' It’s a philosophy to me, not a party." [...] Elder supported presidential candidates Harry Browne in 2000, George W. Bush in 2004, and John McCain in 2008.|$|E
2500|$|It {{was also}} at the bar that Aykroyd {{introduced}} Belushi to the blues. An interest soon became a fascination, {{and it was not}} long before the two began singing with local blues bands. Jokingly, SNL band leader Howard Shore suggested they call themselves [...] "The Blues Brothers." [...] In an April 1988 interview he gave to the Chicago Sun-Times, Aykroyd said the Blues Brothers act borrowed from Sam & Dave and others; the Sun-Times quoted him as explaining: [...] "Well obviously the duo thing and the dancing, but the hats came from John Lee Hooker. The suits came from the concept that <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> jazz player in the 40's, 50's 60's, to look straight, you had to wear a suit." ...|$|E
2500|$|Perry {{described}} the process [...] "a very pure moment for me" [...] and continued saying, [...] " [...] where I started my creative juices. And also {{it kind of}} exudes this euphoric feeling because everybody remembers what their teenage dreams were — all the girls that were on your poster walls." [...] After she recorded the vocals, McKee pulled Luke and Martin aside and told them her idea, to which they responded, [...] "Well why didn't you {{say that in the}} first place?". The chorus was rewritten, and the line [...] "Skin tight jeans" [...] was taken from the early [...] "trying me on" [...] version. When the final version was finished, McKee said, [...] "We were all so pumped that it had paid off. I remember Max sitting back and saying 'I wish we could bottle this feeling'. It was really magical." [...] Perry commented that even though the song was rewritten many times, she was [...] "so happy to finally get somewhere that we all agreed on" [...] after it was finished. During an interview in June 2010, Perry confirmed [...] "Teenage Dream" [...] as the second single from the album, and said that the song was about [...] "kind of like feeling that way <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> teenager: really emotional, really invested..... It's intense being in love and being a teenager." [...] After confirming that [...] "Teenage Dream" [...] was also the title of the album, she explained that it was a throwback to her teenage years, as she thought back to her youth while contemplating marriage to her boyfriend Russell Brand. She added, [...] "To me, this year is pretty heavy. I am going to be getting married and putting out this record, and there is so much going on that it's nice to think of those young dreams." ...|$|E
