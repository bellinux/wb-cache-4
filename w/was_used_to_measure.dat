25|$|The smaller of the Egyptian ells {{measured}} , but {{the standard}} Babylonian ell, cast in stone {{on one of}} the statues of King Gudea, was 49.5cm (19.49in), and the larger Egyptian ell was between 52.5 and 52.8cm (20.67 and 20.79in). The Books of Samuel portray the Temple as having a Phoenician architect, and in Phoenicia it was the Babylonian ell which <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>measure</b> the size of parts of ships. Thus scholars are uncertain whether the standard Biblical ell would have been 49.5 or 52.5cm (19.49 or 20.67in), but are fairly certain {{that it was one of}} these two figures. From these figures for the size of a Biblical ell, that of the basic unit — the finger-breadth (Etzba) — can be calculated to be either 2.1 or 2.2cm (0.83 or 0.87in); Rav Chayim No'eh approximates at 2cm (0.79in); Talmudic scholar Chazon Ish at 2.38cm (0.94in). The mile (Mil) is thus about 963 or 1146 meters (3160 or 3760ft) — approximately six or seven tenths of a mile, and significantly shorter than the modern statute or land mile of 5280ft or 1760 yd (approximately 1.6km).|$|E

2500|$|Walker and Stickgold {{hypothesized}} that after initial memory acquisition, sleep reorganizes memory representation at a macro-brain systems level.

The day-wake group was taught the same task {{in the morning and}} tested 12 hours later with no intervening sleep. FMRI <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>measure</b> brain activity during retest. Results indicated significantly fewer errors/sequence in the night-sleep group compared to the day wake group. FMRI output for the night-sleep group indicated increased activation in the right primary motor cortex/M1/Prefrontal Gyrus (contra lateral to the hand they were block tapping with), right anterior medial prefrontal lobe, right hippocampus (long-term memory, spatial memory), right ventral striatum (olfactory tubercle, nucleus accumbens), as well as regions of the cerebellum (lobules V1, V11). In the day-wake group, fMRI showed [...] "decreased" [...] signal activation bilaterally in the parietal cortices (integrates multiple modalities), in addition to the left insular cortex (regulation of homeostasis), left temporal pole (most anterior of temporal cortex), and the left inferior fronto-polar cortex. Previous investigations have shown that signal increases indicate brain plasticity. The increased signal activity seen in M1 after sleep corresponds to increased activity in this area seen during practice; however, an individual must practice for longer periods than they would have to sleep in order to obtain the same level of M1 signal increases. Therefore, it is suggested that sleep enhances the cortical representation of motor tasks by brain system expansion, as seen by increased signal activity.|$|E
