2500|$|The most {{favourable}} {{season for}} taking these [...] is after the rising of the Dog-star, or else before spring; {{for when they}} have once discharged their waxy secretion, their juices have no consistency: this, however, is a fact unknown in the dyers' workshops, although it {{is a point of}} primary importance. After it is taken, the vein [...] is extracted, which we have previously spoken of, to which it is requisite to add salt, a sextarius [...] about to every hundred pounds of juice. It is sufficient to leave them to steep for a period of three days, and no more, for the fresher they are, the greater virtue there is in the liquor. It is then set to boil in vessels of tin , and every hundred amphor√¶ ought to be boiled down to five hundred pounds of dye, by the application of a moderate heat; for which purpose the vessel is placed {{at the end of a}} long funnel, which communicates with the furnace; while thus boiling, the liquor is skimmed from time to time, and with it the flesh, which necessarily adheres to the veins. About the tenth day, generally, the <b>whole</b> <b>contents</b> of the cauldron are in a liquefied state, upon which a fleece, from which the grease has been cleansed, is plunged into it by way of making trial; but until such time as the colour is found to satisfy the wishes of those preparing it, the liquor is still kept on the boil. The tint that inclines to red is looked upon as inferior to that which is of a blackish hue. The wool is left to lie in soak for five hours, and then, after carding it, it is thrown in again, until it has fully imbibed the colour.|$|E

30|$|The {{previous}} {{methods have}} mainly focused on protecting contents from unspecified attacks. Thus, they concerned {{the integrity of}} a <b>whole</b> <b>content.</b> Most of the previous approaches assume that they can inspect a <b>whole</b> <b>content</b> at once. However, for in-network monitoring, the assumption is not always true. Only IDS works on the fragments of contents (packets) to detect attempts of various attacks. It generally uses pattern matching with signatures generated from known attack models. This approach is effective for high-speed detection of wide-spectrum attacks, but the predefined signature patterns can be deceived in sophisticated attacks. In that sense, CodeDog is advantageous for securing software updates in mobile networks. It can detect the modification in semantics from the fragments of software objects.|$|R
30|$|The layout template, {{which lets}} the author select and apply a {{graphical}} layout to the content. The layout templates are basically implemented {{by means of}} Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) that {{can be added to}} the page. They exploit the cascading mechanism and they apply it, by merging the defined layout template with the Learning Content Management System (LCMS) graphical design. Layout templates {{can be applied to the}} <b>whole</b> <b>content</b> or to a single page of the learning object. Such options relate to two different authoring requirements: (1) the need of setting a consistent graphic design to a <b>whole</b> <b>content</b> and (2) the possibility of showing a specific page with some specific graphical details (for instance, the need of highlight some parts of the content or the need of aligning some content in a specific way, such as images).|$|R

In Australia, quantification of whole grain composition does not include all foods within the current survey database, AUSNUT (Australian Food, Supplement and Nutrient) 2011 - 13. This study aimed to update an existing Australian whole grain database to include all foods and food products within AUSNUT 2011 - 13 (n = 5741). <b>Whole</b> grain <b>content</b> (g) per 100 g was calculated using a systematic recipe-based approach, and input from industry stakeholders, product packaging, and ingredient lists. Overall 590 foods were identified as containing whole grain. Cereals and cereal products formed the majority (43 %) of the database. Foods with <b>whole</b> grain <b>content</b> 100. 0 g/ 100 g were raw or puffed whole grains, whole grain flours, and ready to eat cereals made from 100 % whole grains. Considerable variation in <b>whole</b> grain <b>content</b> exists between and within food groups. The updated database may be {{a useful tool for}} assessing <b>whole</b> grain <b>content</b> of Australian food intake data.

It has been observed that wet weight, <b>whole</b> body mineral <b>contents,</b> the number of lamellae per filament of gill {{and the number of}} calcified vertebrae of larvae during early development stage increased by age, whereas dry weight decreased. The increase of <b>whole</b> body magnesium <b>content</b> has been very low compared with that of other minerals.
