One example is found in so-called Anion Relay Chemistry in which a negative charge of an anionic functional group resulting from one organic reaction is transferred to a different location within the same carbon framework and available for secondary reaction. In this example of a multi-component reaction both formaldehyde (1) and isopropylaldehyde (8) are converted into dithianes 3 and 9 with 1,3-propanedithiol. Sulfide 3 is first silylated by reaction with tert-butyllithium and then trimethylsilyl chloride 4 {{and then the second}} acyl proton is removed and reacted with optically active (−)-epichlorohydrin 6 replacing chlorine. This compound serves as the substrate for reaction with the other dithiane 9 to the oxirane ring opening product 10. Under influence of the polar base HMPA, 10 rearranges in a 1,4-Brook rearrangement to the silyl ether 11 reactivating the formaldehyde dithiane group as an anion (hence the anion relay concept).

The reactions were studied in the gas phase over the pressure range 1 - 100 Torr in SF 6 bath gas, at four or five temperatures in the range 294 - 605 K. All three reactions showed pressure dependences characteristic of third-body-assisted association reactions with, surprisingly, SiH 2 + oxirane showing the least and SiH 2 + THF showing the most pressure dependence. The second-order rate constants obtained by extrapolation to the high-pressure limits at each temperature fitted the Arrhenius equations where the error limits are single standard deviations: log(k(oxirane) (infinity) /cm(3) molecule(- 1) s(- 1)) = (- 11. 03 +/- 0. 07) + (5. 70 +/- 0. 51) kJ mol(- 1) /RT In 10 log(k(oxetane) (infinity) /cm(3) molecule(- 1) s(- 1)) = (- 11. 17 +/- 0. 11) + (9. 04 +/- 0. 78) kJ mol(- 1) /RT In 10 log(k(THF) (infinity) /cm(3) molecule(- 1) s(- 1)) = (- 10. 59 +/- 0. 10) + (5. 76 +/- 0. 65) kJ mol(- 1) /RT In 10 Binding-energy values of 77, 97, and 92 kJ mol(- 1) have been obtained for the donor-acceptor complexes of SiH 2 <b>with</b> <b>oxirane,</b> oxetane, and THF, respectively, by means of quantum chemical (ab initio) calculations carried Out at the G 3 level. The use of these values to model the pressure dependences of these reactions, via RRKM theory, provided a good fit only in the case of SiH 2 + THF.

For the parent oxirane, where this path is not available, the reaction starts with C-O activation to form a 2 -rhodaoxetane, which then undergoes β-elimination. More generally, easy C-H activation, which appears to be a recurring theme in this Rh chemistry, is due to a close energy matching between corresponding Rh(i) and Rh(iii) complexes.

40|$|An {{ability to}} prepare {{clathrate}} hydrates using low temperature-high vacuum techniques, originally demonstrated for the hydrate of oxirane (Bertie and Devlin), {{has been extended}} to include the structure I hydrate of cyclopropane and H 2 S, mixed structure I hydrate of oxirane and ethane {{as well as the}} structure II simple hydrate of THP and the double hydrates of THF <b>with</b> <b>oxirane</b> and cyclopropane. The crystalline clathrate films (~ 6 µ) have been formed either by annealing amorphous host-guest deposits at ~ 130 K, epitaxial growth at 110 K (oxirane and mixed ethane-oxirane or direct deposition at 150 K (THF and its double clathrates). Use of the epitaxial approach at 100 K has permitted the formation of the oxirane clathrate hydrate containing intact isolated D 2 O molecules. This has permitted the FT-IR observation of the v 3 -v 1 doublet in the O-D stretching region (2455 cm- 1 and 2380 cm- 1 at 100 K) with the values, after correction for Fermi resonance, suggesting a splitting from intramolecular coupling of ~ 56 cm- 1 (2455 cm- 1 vs. 2399 cm- 1), which compares closely with the 52 cm- 1 deduced for cubic ice. Spectra for the structure I hydrates of oxirane and H 2 S contain adsorption bands produced by guest molecules confined to both small and large clathrate cages. Use of the structure II double hydrates has permitted the firm identification of the structure I infrared bands <b>with</b> <b>oxirane</b> and H 2 S molecules in cages of one size or the other. Thus, the weaker v 3 and (v 11, v 14) bands of oxirane at 1281 and 1152 cm- 1 have been assigned to molecules in the small cages since only these oxirane features remain in the structure II double hydrate with THF. In this case the smaller oxirane molecules occupy the small cages while the THF molecules enter the larger cages, exclusively. In a similar manner, the H-S stretching vibrations of H 2 S in the structure I small cages have been assigned to a band complex near 2610 cm- 1, some 50 cm- 1 above the band system for H 2 S in the large structure I clathrate cages. Such a result suggests that the net H 2 S perturbation, relative to the gas phase, is greater for the large than for the small cages and may be interpreted as evidence for a "double well" large cage potential or as further evidence that the cage model of Pimentel and Charles for guest molecule stretching modes is valid...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The {{cationic}} polymerization of heterocyclic monomers {{may lead}} to polymers containing substantial, yet Variable amounts of cyclic oligomers. This review gives {{a survey of the}} systems where such oligomers have been found. Oligomer formation is generally observed in the polymerization of oxiranes and thiiranes. The most frequently observed oligomers are the cyclic dimers and cyclic tetramers but other structures are also possible. It is not clear at the present which factors determine the structure of the oligomer. During the polymerization of aziridines also, cyclic oligomers may be formed. With these monomers, the nature of the catalyst, solvent and temperature are important factors. Of the four-membered heterocyclics, only oxetanes have been found to produce cyclic oligomers. From studies <b>with</b> <b>oxiranes,</b> thiiranes and some aziridines it follows that the oligomers are produced by degradation of first formed polymer and not directly from the monomer. The active species for degradation are the corresponding onium ions. From a thermodynamic point of view it is expected that polymers obtained from three-membered ring heterocycles degrade to form oligomers {{but it is not clear}} why in some cases dimers, and in other cases higher oligomers are formed...|$|R

40|$|Two conformationally {{constrained}} compounds {{similar to}} chicoric acid but lacking the catechol and carboxyl groups were prepared. In these analogues, the single {{bond between the}} two caffeoyl fragments has been replaced <b>with</b> a chiral <b>oxirane</b> ring and both aromatic residues modified protecting completely or partially the catechol moiety as methyl ether. Preliminary molecular modelling studies carried out on the two analogues showed interactions near the active site of HIV integrase; however, in comparison with raltegravir, the biological evaluation confirmed that CAA- 1 and CAA- 2 were unable to inhibit infection at lower concentration...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Substituted homoallylic {{alcohols}} {{have been}} synthesised both by [2, 3]-Wittig rearrangement of unsymmetrical bis-allylic ethers and reaction of alkenyl chloromethyl <b>oxiranes</b> <b>with</b> Mg/THF. These substrates were then oxidized using four different oxidants. When the substituted homoallylic alcohols were oxidized with pyridinium chlorochromate or zinc chlorochromate nonahydrate the corresponding carbonyl compounds were produced. The same substrates formed the corresponding allylic oxidation products together with epoxidation products when oxidized with t-BuOOH. When and t-BuOOH and catalytic amounts of OsO 4 were used the allylic oxidation reaction was prevented {{and the only}} products formed were those in which the substituted double bond was epoxidized...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Cycloaddition of electron-rich {{chalcone}} epoxides with electron-rich olefins was efficiently catalyzed by tris(4 -bromo-phenyl) aminium hexachloroantimonate producing poly-substituted tetrahydrofuran derivatives in high yield. Key words: cation radical, cycloaddition, epoxides, tetrahydro-furans Substituted tetrahydrofurans {{are important}} synthetic tar-gets {{due to their}} presence {{in a variety of}} natural products 1 with wide range of biological activities. 2 Therefore, new synthetic approaches have continuously emerged for con-struction of the tetrahydrofuran subunit. 3, 4 Shim and Yamamoto 5 have reported a palladium-catalyzed [3 + 2] cycloaddition of vinyl <b>oxiranes</b> <b>with</b> olefins, but the olefin must be activated by substitution of two electron-with-drawing groups with at least one cyano group, i. e., th...|$|R
