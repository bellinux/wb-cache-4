5|$|During {{and after}} the debates over church government, the Assembly framed other {{documents}} which did not cause open rifts. The Directory for Public Worship, which was to replace the Book of Common Prayer, was swiftly written in 1644 and passed by Parliament on 3January 1645. The Directory, accepted by the Scots as well, took a middle course between the presbyterians and congregationalists. The presbyterians {{for the most part}} preferred a fixed liturgy while congregationalists favoured extemporaneous prayer. The Directory consisted of an order for services <b>with</b> <b>sample</b> prayers. The Assembly also recommended a psalter, translated by Francis Rous for use in worship.|$|E
5|$|Items {{from the}} hoard {{have been on}} display almost {{continuously}} since the treasure was received at the British Museum. Some items were displayed at the Museum as early as September 1993 in response to public interest. Much of the hoard was exhibited at Ipswich Museum in 1994–1995. From 1997, the most important items went on permanent display at the British Museum {{in a new and}} enlarged Roman Britain gallery (Room 49), alongside the roughly contemporary Thetford Hoard, and adjacent to the Mildenhall Treasure, which contains large silver vessels of types that are absent from the Hoxne Hoard. Some items from the Hoxne Hoard were included in Treasure: Finding Our Past, a touring exhibition that was shown in five cities in England and Wales in 2003. A perspex reconstruction of the chest and inner boxes in which it was deposited was created for this tour, showing the arrangement of the different types of items <b>with</b> <b>sample</b> items inside. It is now part of the permanent display in London, along with other items laid out more traditionally.|$|E

500|$|... "Nothing Really Matters" [...] was {{recorded}} alongside {{the rest of}} the album at Larrabee North Studio in North Hollywood, California. Only three other people were in the studio with Madonna during the recording of the song and album: Orbit, recording engineer Pat McCarthy, and his assistant engineer, Matt Silva. The track featured no live instrumentation, and was part of a machinery issue that delayed initial recording as Orbit preferred working <b>with</b> <b>sample</b> loops and synth-based instrumentation. As a result, it took a while to finish production of the song, until the computers were repaired. The song was mastered by Ted Jensen at Sterling Studios in New York, and included background vocals from Donna DeLory and Nikki Harris.|$|E

500|$|For digital audio, if an HDMI device has audio, it is {{required}} to implement the baseline format: stereo (uncompressed) PCM. Other formats are optional, with HDMI allowing up to 8 channels of uncompressed audio at sample sizes of 16-bit, 20-bit and 24-bit, <b>with</b> <b>sample</b> rates of 32kHz, 44.1kHz, 48kHz, 88.2kHz, 96kHz, 176.4kHz and 192kHz. HDMI also carries any IEC 61937-compliant compressed audio stream, such as Dolby Digital and DTS, and up to 8 channels of one-bit DSD audio (used on Super Audio CDs) at rates up to four times that of Super Audio CD. With version 1.3, HDMI allows lossless compressed audio streams Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio. [...] As with the YCbCr video, audio capability is optional.

500|$|As Since I Left You {{was being}} recorded, the Avalanches had trouble {{choosing}} songs {{to be released}} as singles, finding them not sounding as good outside {{the context of the}} album. On 13 September 1999 they issued [...] "Electricity" [...] as a four-track 12" [...] vinyl single in Australia (on Modular Recordings) and as a two-track 7" [...] vinyl single in the United Kingdom (on Rex Records). – The Avalanches}} – The Avalanches}} Chater felt that Modular was very patient with the group releasing the record. On 21 August 2000, the next single for the album was [...] "Frontier Psychiatrist" [...] which was issued by Modular in Australia in both a four-track and two-track version. The initial release date for Since I Left You was going to be 11 September; however, it was delayed due to issues <b>with</b> <b>sample</b> clearance. On 27 November the album was issued in Australia with plans to have a world release in early 2001. The later release date outside Australia was due to additional sample clearances needed for international markets. To celebrate the album's release in Melbourne, the group had a boat cruise party through Port Phillip Bay. In February 2001 they released the album's title track in Australia and followed in July 2001 with [...] "Radio".|$|E
500|$|Brütal Legend {{features}} 107 {{heavy metal}} tracks from 75 different bands, selected by Schafer and Music Director Emily Ridgway as listed below, each song being a [...] "completely sincere choice" [...] by Schafer and Ridgway, {{with the whole}} track list being [...] "designed to be loved by Metal fans." [...] Schafer sought to include songs from most main subgenres of metal, including classic heavy metal, industrial metal, black metal, and doom metal, with each faction in the game favoring a specific type. Though Schafer {{and others on the}} Double Fine team had vast knowledge of specific types of metal, Ridgway turned to a used-CD store owner named Allan from Aquarius Records who had [...] "encyclopedic knowledge" [...] of the entire genre, and who provided the team <b>with</b> <b>sample</b> CDs to help them discover some of the more obscure metal bands. Schafer had identified many of the more well-known songs on the list, while Ridgway was able to locate mission-appropriate, more obscure titles for inclusion; for example, one mission, given by the Killmaster (voiced by Lemmy Kilmister), involves rescuing female troops for Ironheade's army; Ridgway had been able to locate a cover of [...] "Bomber", originally recorded by Motörhead (Kilmister's band) and performed by the all-female metal band Girlschool, recorded in their 1981 split EP St. Valentine's Day Massacre. Schafer also credits Black with some of the music selections for the game. Instead of relying on labels or bands to provide them with a list of possible songs to select from, the development team sought permission to use specific songs they wanted in the game. In some cases, obtaining appropriate licensing proved difficult, as for songs from bands that had long split up, Double Fine needed to contact each band member to gain permission. This proved to be valuable, as some original bands were excited about their music being used in the game; in one case, Lita Ford was able to provide the game with a song with slight modifications to the lyrics from a version that she was about to release. One song is from the in-game band [...] "Kabbage Boy" [...] for which Eddie is a roadie {{at the start of the}} game.|$|E

2500|$|A week later, to {{alleviate}} this problem, Wolpaw returned <b>with</b> <b>sample</b> dialogue {{made with a}} text-to-speech program, which {{was intended to be}} used as a series of messages relayed to the player in the relaxation vault, the first area of the game. The team liked the voice, describing it as [...] "funny" [...] and [...] "sinister", so Wolpaw decided to add this voice to other test chambers, all the while trying to think of story elements. The developers noticed that play testers were more motivated by the voice because they became attached to it. As a result, the team decided to make GLaDOS the narrative voice of Portal. While designing GLaDOS, one of the rules that the writers had was that they would not make her seem like a computer, for example having her say, [...] "Oh my nuts and bolts." [...] While GLaDOS is physically a computer and speaks with a computerized voice, they intended her to speak to the player-character like a regular person.|$|E
2500|$|The {{technique}} {{developed by}} Gaarder and Gran uses {{variations in the}} concentration of oxygen under different experimental conditions to infer gross primary production. [...] Typically, three identical transparent vessels are filled <b>with</b> <b>sample</b> water and stoppered. [...] The first is analysed immediately and {{used to determine the}} initial oxygen concentration; usually this is done by performing a Winkler titration. [...] The other two vessels are incubated, one each in under light and darkened. [...] After a fixed period of time, the experiment ends, and the oxygen concentration in both vessels is measured. [...] As photosynthesis has not taken place in the dark vessel, it provides a measure of ecosystem respiration. [...] The light vessel permits both photosynthesis and respiration, so provides a measure of net photosynthesis (i.e. oxygen production via photosynthesis subtract oxygen consumption by respiration). [...] Gross primary production is then obtained by adding oxygen consumption in the dark vessel to net oxygen production in the light vessel.|$|E
