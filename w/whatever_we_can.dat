In an interview with DNAinfo Chicago, Mullaney shared that the goal of their theater was to create a comedy theater and not just an improv theater.

The plaintiffs opposed allowing the groups or the City to intervene. On August 19, Judge Walker denied the legal groups' motions to intervene but granted the City's, albeit in a limited capacity. Despite the other groups' failed attempt {{to intervene in}} the lawsuit, they offered support to the legal team litigating the case, with James Esseks of the ACLU saying: [...] "e are interested in doing <b>whatever</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> to make sure their case is as successful as possible".|$|E
2500|$|Prior to the election, {{freedom of}} {{association}} had been severely curtailed through various laws; according to Burton Y. Berry, Groza had admitted to this, and had indicated that it came as {{an answer to the}} need for order in the country. Expanding on this, he had stated that the cabinet was attempting to prevent [...] "provocation" [...] from both the far right and far left, and that chaos during the elections would have resulted in his own sidelining by the Communist Party. In regard to the arrest of several Romanian employees of the American Embassy in Bucharest, Groza reportedly claimed that he had tried to set them free, but the PCR had opposed his move. However, in a semi-official context, he had also stated (February 1946): [...] "If the reaction wins, do you think we'll let it live for [...] 24 hours? We'll be getting our payback immediately. We'll get our hands on <b>whatever</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> and we'll strike".|$|E

2500|$|The first {{coalition}} Government {{collapsed in}} 1951. However, in 1954 a second inter-party Government was formed. On this occasion Liam Cosgrave, {{at the age}} of 34, was given a cabinet position. As Minister for External Affairs Cosgrave took part in trade discussions and chaired the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe in 1955. He also presided over Ireland's admission to the United Nations in 1955. Cosgrave outlined the three principles of his foreign policy to the Dáil in June, 1956, the first was adherence to the principles of the UN Charter, the second was independence and non-alignment, but the third made clear where Ireland's sympathies lay: [...] "to do <b>whatever</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> {{as a member of the}} UN to preserve the Christian civilisation of which we are a part and with that end in view to support whenever possible those powers principally responsible for the defence of the free world in their resistance to the spread of communist power and influence." [...] Ireland was non aligned in favour of the United States. The second Inter Party government collapsed amid severely deflationary policies set by the patrician Minister for Finance, [...] Gerard Sweetman, and Cosgrave held Sweetman personally responsible for Fine Gael's defeat in 1957, and told him so, reportedly stating that Fine Gael [...] "was no longer led by people living in big houses at the end of long avenues." [...] He did not speak to Sweetman for some years.|$|E

60|$|In {{addition}} to our acquaintance with particular existing things, we also have acquaintance with what we shall call universals, that is to say, general ideas, such as whiteness, diversity, brotherhood, and so on. Every complete sentence must contain at least one word which stands for a universal, since all verbs have a meaning which is universal. We shall return to universals later on, in Chapter IX; for the present, it is only necessary to guard against the supposition that <b>whatever</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> be acquainted with must be something particular and existent. Awareness of universals is called conceiving, and a universal {{of which we are}} aware is called a concept.|$|E

60|$|Berkeley's view, that {{obviously}} the colour {{must be in}} the mind, seems to depend for its plausibility upon confusing the thing apprehended with the act of apprehension. Either of these might be called an 'idea'; probably either would have been called an idea by Berkeley. The act is undoubtedly in the mind; hence, when we are thinking of the act, we readily assent to the view that ideas {{must be in the}} mind. Then, forgetting that this was only true when ideas were taken as acts of apprehension, we transfer the proposition that 'ideas are in the mind' to ideas in the other sense, i.e. to the things apprehended by our acts of apprehension. Thus, by an unconscious equivocation, we arrive at the conclusion that <b>whatever</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> apprehend must be in our minds. This seems to be the true analysis of Berkeley's argument, and the ultimate fallacy upon which it rests.|$|E

60|$|It {{remains to}} ask whether there are any general {{philosophical}} arguments enabling us to say that, if matter is real, it must be of such and such a nature. As explained above, very many philosophers, perhaps most, have held that whatever is real must be in some sense mental, or at any rate that <b>whatever</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> know anything about must be in some sense mental. Such philosophers are called 'idealists'. Idealists tell us that what appears as matter is really something mental; namely, either (as Leibniz held) more or less rudimentary minds, or (as Berkeley contended) ideas in the minds which, as we should commonly say, 'perceive' the matter. Thus idealists deny the existence of matter as something intrinsically different from mind, though they do not deny that our sense-data are signs of something which exists independently of our private sensations. In the following chapter we shall consider briefly the reasons--in my opinion fallacious--which idealists advance in favour of their theory.|$|E
6000|$|Till then, farewell! Do {{not judge}} hastily of my motives for {{persisting}} {{in the life}} of retirement which I have led for so many years past.

It has fortified my spirit with an abiding strength; it has told me plainly, much that was but dimly revealed to me before; it has shown me uses to which I may put my existence, that have their sanction from other voices than the voices of fame; it has taught me to feel that bravest ambition which is vigorous enough to overleap the little life here!

We are attempting generalization about a class of remarkably peculiar and difficult persons. They are persons either of great intellectual power or simply of great imaginative power, whose bias and quality it is to apply these exceptional powers not directly and simply to their personal advancement and enrichment, but primarily through philosophical, scientific, or artistic channels, to the increase of knowledge or of wisdom or of both. And here is the peculiar point in this problem, they are men who put, or who wish to put the best of themselves and most of themselves into occupations and interests that do not lead to practical results, that often for the individual in open competition and the market fail more or less completely to [...] "pay." [...] Their activities, of course, pay tremendously at last for the race, but that is not their personal point of application.
