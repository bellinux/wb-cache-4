5|$|In 2011, Lim {{noted that}} the Compulsory Education Act ensures that all {{children}} {{have the opportunity to}} receive an education.

She thus brought to the House's attention the fact that special needs children might have been unintentionally marginalized. These concerns <b>were</b> <b>supported</b> by Penny Low, MP for Pasir Ris–Punggol GRC.|$|E
