5|$|The Monkland Canal was {{constructed}} {{at the end}} of the 18th century initially to transport coal to Glasgow from the rich local deposits. The invention of the hot blast furnace process in 1828 meant that Coatbridge's ironstone deposits could be exploited to the maximum by the canal link and hot blast process. The new advances meant that iron could be produced with two thirds less fuel. Summerlee Iron Works was one of the first iron works to use this technology. By the mid 19th century there <b>were</b> <b>numerous</b> hot blast furnaces in operation in Coatbridge.|$|E
5|$|The ideal {{solution}} was a proximity fuze inside an artillery shell, but there <b>were</b> <b>numerous</b> technical difficulties with this. The radar set {{had to be}} made small enough to fit inside a shell, and its glass vacuum tubes had to first withstand the 20,000 g force of being fired from a gun, and then 500 rotations per second in flight. A special Section T of NDRC was created, chaired by Tuve, with Parsons as special assistant to Bush and liaison between NDRC and BuOrd.|$|E

The strongest storm of the season, Hurricane Hector, formed on July 30 {{to the south of}} Mexico and reached peak winds of 145mph (230km/h)—Category4 status—before dissipating over open waters on August 9; Hector was never a threat to land. Tropical Storm Gilma was the only cyclone in the season to make landfall, crossing the Hawaiian Islands, although there <b>were</b> <b>numerous</b> near-misses.

5|$|There <b>were</b> <b>numerous</b> coal {{workings}} in {{the area}} from Gurney Slade east to Mells around the villages of Holcombe, Coleford and Stratton-on-the-Fosse. These included at least 52 bell pits, some with deeper shafts and 16 adits.

Most mining ended in the 19th century, however Strap Colliery was opened in 1953 as Mendip Colliery and worked until 1969.|$|E
5|$|There <b>were</b> <b>numerous</b> {{proposals}} at {{the time}} to build an electric aerial tramway, with one such line to go down the Avenida de Mayo. One proposal was the 1889 Le Tellier proposal, which envisioned multiple lines running along the city's wider avenues with the trams moved using cables and would hang from steel rails fixed to 6 metre high steel and iron posts positioned in 10–15 metre intervals. The lines would take 24 months to build and construction would commence 3 months after their approval by the Argentine National Congress, a decision which was ultimately not taken, favouring instead an underground tramway.|$|E

Many buckles use plates that bore the state seal or motto of their home states. The vast majority used simple roller buckle plates of the type found on a common dog collar. As the War progressed, more and more men used captured US belt plates, often wearing them upside down.|$|E
