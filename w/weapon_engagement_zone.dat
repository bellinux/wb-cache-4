40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} use of an {{artificial}} neural network (ANN), in particular a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), to perform function approximation on truth data representing a <b>weapon</b> <b>engagement</b> <b>zone</b> 2 ̆ 7 s (WEZ) maximum launch range. The WEZ of an air-to-air missile represents the boundaries and zones of effectiveness for a one-vs-one air-to-air combat engagement [13]. The intent is for the network to fuse table lookup and interpolation functionality into a physically compact and computationally efficient package, while improving approximation accuracy over conventional methods. Data was collected from simulated firings of a notional air-to-air missile model and used to train a two layer perceptron using the Bayesian Regularization training algorithm. The resulting best network was able to improve approximation accuracy and reduce the amount of truth data needed. With basic feasibility established, future efforts can be focused on more comprehensive comparisons with existing methods and deployment within practical models...|$|E

On the other hand, prepared air tasking order (ATO) has been used to engage friendly forces to different targets in order to prevent possible chaos and source waste. Complexity of modern and future warfare and increasing user demands require dynamic air and space control mechanism. In this study a conceptual dynamic air and space control model is described. Furthermore, “Novel Data Distribution Model for Tactical Units in Military Operations ” and “TOADO: Target Optimization for Air Defence Operations ” were presented as parts of dynamic aerospace control system. Conventional aerospace procedures require planning of missile <b>engagement</b> <b>zone</b> (MEZ), fighter <b>engagement</b> <b>zone</b> (FEZ) and similar controlled areas well ahead of execution.

40|$|The {{position}} of a frigate to face some threats can augment its survival chances and therefore {{it is important to}} investigate this aspect in order to determine how a frigate can position itself during an attack. To achieve that, we propose a first method based on the Bayesian movement, performed by a learning agent, which determines the optimal positioning of the frigate by dividing the defense area into six sectors for <b>weapon</b> <b>engagement</b> and then, it makes efficient use of all the weapons available by using the sectors. The second method that we propose is called Radar Cross-Section Reduction (RCSR) movement and, it aims at reducing the exposed surface of the frigate to incoming threats before their locking phase is over. Preliminary results on these two methods are presented and discussed. Finally, an implementation of a meta-level agent which would make efficient use of both complementary methods is suggested...|$|R

A naï ve Bayes method that determines the optimal positioning of the Frigate to most effectively use the hardkill and softkill weapons is presented.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a stochastic, network interdiction optimization model to guide defensive, counter-air (DCA) operations planning. We model a layered, integrated air-defense system, {{which consists of}} fighter and missile <b>engagement</b> <b>zones.</b> We extend an existing two-stage, stochastic, generalized-network interdiction model by Pan, Charlton and Morton, and adapt it to DCA operations planning. The extension allows us to handle multiple-type interdiction assets, and constrain the attacker's flight path by the maximum allowable traveled distance. The defender selects the locations to install multiple interceptor types, with uncertainty in the attacker's origin and destination, {{in order to minimize}} the probability of evasion, or the expected target value collected by the evader. Then, the attacker reveals an origin-destination pair (independent of the defender's decision), and sends a strike package along a path (through the interdicted network) that maximizes his probability of evasion. By adding a small persistence penalty we ensure the plans are consistent in presence of minor variations in the number of interceptors. We present computational results for several instances of a test case consisting of the airspace over a 360 -by- 360 nautical miles area. The computational time ranges from some seconds to ten minutes, which is acceptable for operational use of this model. Hellenic Air Force autho...|$|R
40|$|The {{current study}} avoided the typical {{laboratory}} context to determine instead whether over-imitation—the disposition to copy even visibly, causally unnecessary actions—occurs in a real-world {{context in which}} participants are unaware of being in an experiment. We disguised a puzzle-box task as an interactive item {{available to the public}} within a science <b>engagement</b> <b>zone</b> of Edinburgh Zoo. As a member of the public approached, a confederate acting as a zoo visitor retrieved a reward from the box using a sequence of actions containing both causally relevant and irrelevant elements. Despite the absence of intentional demonstration, or social pressure to copy, a majority of both child and even adult observers included all causally irrelevant actions in their reproduction. This occurred even though causal irrelevance appeared manifest because of the transparency of the puzzle-box. That over-imitation occurred so readily in a naturalistic context, devoid of social interaction and pressure, suggests that humans are opportunistic social learners throughout the lifespan, copying the actions of other individuals even when these actions are not intentionally demonstrated, and their causal significance is not readily apparent. The disposition to copy comprehensively, even when a mere onlooker, likely provides humans, irrespective of their age, with a powerful mechanism to extract maximal information from the social environment.
