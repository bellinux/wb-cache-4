So when I heard 'How Will I Know,' I said 'this {{is absolutely}} perfect.' I played it for Clive [...] {{he fell in love with}} it. I wasn't very familiar with her family background; I didn't realize that, even at that time, there was a pretty big industry buzz about her future." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gordon {{travelled}} {{north to}} Cairo {{to meet with}} Baring and suggest the solution that Egypt suspend its interest payments for several years to allow Isma'il to pay the arrears owned to his soldiers and civil servants, arguing that once the Egyptian government was stabilised, then Egypt could start paying its debts without fear of causing a revolution. Faught wrote Gordon's plans were [...] "farsighted and humane", but Baring {{had no interest in}} Gordon's plans to suspend the interest payments. Gordon disliked Baring, writing he had [...] "a pretentious, grand, patronizing way around him. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> words together...When oil mixes with water, we will mix together".|$|E
2500|$|In December 2012, in an {{interview}} with Rap-Up, T.I. shared details about his collaboration with singer-songwriter Pink on the T-Minus-produced [...] "Guns and Roses," [...] which he describes as a [...] "bittersweet romantic story." [...] "We found that <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> things in common," [...] says T.I. of the pop-rocker. [...] "We clicked. She real people, she from the streets. I’m a real cat, I’m from the streets. We found ourselves in rooms where we were like, ‘You know what? These people fake as hell in here. Let’s get out of here.’" [...] In a listening session at NYC's Germano Studios, where T.I. played ten songs from the album for industry tastemakers and label executives, he stated he had big hopes for the song.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the late}} 1960s {{computer}} programming was {{in state of}} crisis. Software crisis is a term used {{in the early days}} of computing science for the difficulty of writing useful and efficient computer programs in the required time. The software crisis was due to the rapid increases in computer power and the complexity of the problems that could be tackled. With the increase in the complexity of the software, many software problems arose because existing methods were neither sufficient nor up to the mark. The term [...] "software crisis" [...] was coined by some attendees at the first NATO Software Engineering Conference in 1968 at Garmisch, Germany. His 1972 ACM Turing Award Lecture makes reference to this same problem: [...] "The major cause of the software crisis is that the machines have become several orders of magnitude more powerful! To put it quite bluntly: as long as there were no machines, programming was no problem at all; when <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> weak computers, programming became a mild problem, and now we have gigantic computers, programming has become an equally gigantic problem." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Now, Mrs. Conyers, please {{accompany}} them {{as quick as}} you can to the river. We will follow and cover the retreat. I think <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> minutes yet, before cavalry can arrive from the camp." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I must <b>have</b> <b>an</b> {{agreement}} to that effect," [...] said Rachel, [...] "or {{we must go}} back to Ireland. I must have the agreement before Christmas, or we shall go back. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> pounds which will take us away." ...|$|R

60|$|Before this happened, however, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> brief {{intervals}} of modified dripping.

6000|$|Watts laughed good-naturedly. [...] "Listen, Harris. You {{know as well}} as I do that's a lot of poppycock. They're no more plants {{than you}} or I. They just don't want to work, that's all.

"If <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> guns, {{and were}} a little stronger-handed," [...] growled an old salt to the second-mate, as he hitched up his {{trousers}} and rolled over his quid, [...] "I should think the hard one, aft, had been stripping for a fight; but as it is {{we have nothing to}} carry on the war with, unless we throw sea-biscuits into the enemy'!" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "The {{danger is}} not yet so inevitable," [...] {{returned}} Paul, steadily.

6000|$|... 'For all that, I wish <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> more of them. I like a well-conducted regiment, {{but these}} pasty-faced, shifty-eyed, mealy-mouthed young slouchers from the depot worry me {{sometimes}} with their offensive virtue.

I believe I'd forgive that old villain on the spot if he turned up with any sort of explanation that I could in decency accept.' ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{next day}} <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> calls to make, and an {{invitation}} from Lady Drummond to visit [...] "classic Hawthornden." [...] Accordingly, in the forenoon, Mr. S. and I called first on Lord and Lady Gainsborough; though, {{she is one of}} the queen's household, she is staying here at Edinburgh, and the queen at Osborne. I infer therefore that the appointment includes no very onerous duties. The Earl of Gainsborough is the eldest brother of Rev. Baptist W. Noel.|$|E
60|$|During winter we breakfasted {{usually at}} nine o'clock; {{then sat down}} to the desk till one, when we dined.

On Wednesdays and Saturdays, however, we did no work, and generally spent these days in shooting.|$|E
