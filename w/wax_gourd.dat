The main plants referred to as gourds include several species from the Cucurbita genus (mostly native to North America, including the Malabar gourd and turban squash), Crescentia cujete (the tree gourd or calabash tree, native to the American tropics) and Lagenaria siceraria (bottle gourd). Other plants with gourd in their name include the luffa gourd (likely domesticated in Asia), which includes several species from the Luffa genus, {{as well as the}} <b>wax</b> <b>gourd,</b> snake gourd, teasel gourd, hedgehog gourd, buffalo gourd/coyote gourd. The bitter melon/balsam apple/balsam pear is also sometimes referred to as a gourd.|$|E
50|$|If seed is to {{be transported}} from country to country, it {{generally}} needs {{to be free of}} pathogens before the company will accept it. Japan legally restricts the admission of seeds carrying Acidivorax citrulli bacteria. Seed can be cleaned using a dry heat treatment to remove the pathogen with some success. A treatment of 85° for 3-5 days is effective for removing the pathogen. Different cucurbit seeds respond to this treatment in different ways, and some species (large-seeded squash, <b>wax</b> <b>gourd,</b> bottle gourd) have reduced germination following a dry heat treatment. This cleaning method can remove other pathogens found within seeds, but {{has been found to be}} especially useful for BFB. Prior to planting, seed should be checked to ensure that it is not infected with BFB. Companies such as Eurofins STA Laboratories and Summit Plant Labs test seed for cleanliness.|$|E

The seed extract of <b>wax</b> <b>gourd</b> showed the highest antioxidant capacity for scavenging activity, ferric reducing activity and-carotene bleaching assays and also exhibited highest total phenolic content as compared to skin and pulp extract of <b>wax</b> <b>gourd.</b> A positive correlations were obtained for parts (pulp, skin and seed) of <b>wax</b> <b>gourd</b> extracts between total 2 2 phenolic content with ferric reducing activity (R = 0. 874) and also with % antioxidant activity (R = 0. 989). 2 However, negative correlation was found between total phenolic content with scavenging activity (R =- 0. 077) for various parts of <b>wax</b> <b>gourd</b> extracts studied...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Wax</b> <b>gourd</b> is {{a widely}} used {{vegetable}} of Cucuribtaceae, and also has important medicinal and health values. However, the genomic resources of <b>wax</b> <b>gourd</b> were scarcity, {{and only a few}} nucleotide sequences could be obtained in public databases. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, we examined transcriptome in <b>wax</b> <b>gourd.</b> More than 44 million of high quality reads were generated from five different tissues of <b>wax</b> <b>gourd</b> using Illumina paired-end sequencing technology. Approximately 4 Gbp data were generated, and de novo assembled into 65, 059 unigenes, with an N 50 of 1, 132 bp. Based on sequence similarity search with known protein database, 36, 070 (55. 4 %) showed significant similarity to known proteins in Nr database, and 24, 969 (38. 4 %) had BLAST hits in Swiss-Prot database. Among the annotated unigenes, 14, 994 of <b>wax</b> <b>gourd</b> unigenes were assigned to GO term annotation, and 23, 977 were found to have COG classifications. In addition, a total of 18, 713 unigenes were assigned to 281 KEGG pathways. Furthermore, 6, 242 microsatellites (simple sequence repeats) were detected as potential molecular markers in <b>wax</b> <b>gourd.</b> Two hundred primer pairs for SSRs were designed for validation of the amplification and polymorphism. The result showed that 170 of the 200 primer pairs were successfully amplified and 49 (28. 8 %) of them exhibited polymorphisms. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Our study enriches the genomic resources of <b>wax</b> <b>gourd</b> and provides powerful information for future studies. The availability of this ample amount of information about the transcriptome and SSRs in <b>wax</b> <b>gourd</b> could serve as valuable basis for studies on the physiology, biochemistry, molecular genetics and molecular breeding of this important vegetable crop...|$|E

Our objective was to identify new opportunities for protecting the environment in these areas by emphasizing the potential of cultivation of more resistant plants. With these aim in mind we conducted in 2013 two experiments of growing <b>wax</b> <b>gourd,</b> a plant specific to lowland tropical land. Our experiments (E 3 and E 4) came to complete the researches regarding this plant performed in 1960 (E 1 and E 2). We analyse these experiments in a comparative manner to present in this way the behaviour of plant in four types of cultivation: greenhouse; hotbed; open field – direct sowing; open field – planting seedlings. The results revealed a high yields potential (until 80 tons per hectare) and an improvement in soil composition which was enriched with nutritive substances, especially potassium and phosphorus. In this way, the <b>wax</b> <b>gourd</b> can be described like a very good plant for environment protection and also a plant with a high productivity.

40|$|Agriculture is an {{important}} sector in the peri-urban area of Hanoi. It supplies 62 to 80 % of vegetable consumption, of which 28 % comes from Dong Anh district, which borders Hanoi City. Growing vegetables is {{an important}} income source for the farmers in Dong Anh as it contributes about 30 % to their family earnings. Marketing channel choice and marketing timing affects farmers¿ profit by the obtained output price and the necessary (transaction) costs. This study focuses mainly on these factors¿ impact on output price. The influence of marketing channel choice and marketing timing on the output price has been analysed by performing One Way ANOVA and Post Hoc Bonferroni Tests with data of 63 households in Dong Anh collected in 2003 and 2004 by the VEGSYS project. The three most important vegetables in the area were selected: kohlrabi (Brassica oleracea), wrapped heart mustard (Brassica juncea var. rugosa), and <b>wax</b> <b>gourd</b> (Cucurbita hispida). To analyse which household characteristics influence the choice of marketing channel and marketing timing, T-tests and logistical regressions have been performed, next to qualitative interviews with farmers and traders. Output prices are significantly different between marketing channels. Farmers receive significantly higher kohlrabi and wrapped heart mustard prices from the farm gate collector than when they sell it at the local market. Farmers receive the highest <b>wax</b> <b>gourd</b> price at the Hanoi wholesale market, which requires good quality contrary to the local market. Farmers with high opportunity costs sell to the collector or at the local market. Farmers with large quantities will sell to the collector or at the Hanoi wholesale market.

40|$|The {{nucleotide}} {{sequence of the}} L RNA of Watermelon silver mottle virus (WSMoV) was determined. Combined with the previous work on M and S RNAs, the whole genomic sequence of this member of the genus Tospovirus was completed. The L RNA is 8, 917 nucleotides in length, with one large open reading frame encoding a translation product of 2, 878 amino acids (331. 8 kDa) on the viral complementary strand. The L protein shares amino acid identities of only 44. 3 and 46. 5 % with Tomato sparred wilt virus (TSWV) and Impatiens necrotic spot virus, respectively; but an amino acid identity of 91. 3 % with Peanut bud necrosis virus. Among the sequenced tospoviruses, L protein was the most conserved gene product, whereas the nonstructural S protein was generally the most variable. Comparison of the deduced L protein of WSMoV {{with those of other}} members of the family Bunyaviridae revealed that its amino acid sequence includes the reported conserved motifs of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases. To develop a method for detecting tospoviruses by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), two pairs of degenerate primers were designed from conserved regions of the L genes and used to amplify the corresponding regions of the L genes from total RNAs extracted from plant tissues infected with five serologically distinct tospoviruses. The DNA fragments obtained were identified as those of tospoviruses by restriction enzyme digestion and DNA sequencing. For field samples, watermelon and <b>wax</b> <b>gourd</b> infected with WSMoV, and lisianthus infected with TSWV were also successfully detected by these two pairs of degenerate primers, with a sensitivity similar to N-gene-specific primers.
