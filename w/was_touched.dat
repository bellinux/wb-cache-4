5|$|Dickens <b>was</b> <b>touched</b> by {{the lot of}} poor {{children}} in the middle decades of the 19th century. In early 1843 he toured the Cornish tin mines, where he was angered after seeing children working in appalling conditions. The suffering he witnessed there was reinforced by {{a visit to the}} Field Lane Ragged school, one of several London schools set up for the education of the capital's half-starved, illiterate street children.|$|E

5|$|Bran Stark and the Three-eyed Raven {{observe a}} vision of the Children of the Forest {{creating}} the Night King by impaling a man with a dragonglass dagger. Bran subsequently confronts Leaf, one of the Children, about creating the White Walkers. She explains that they were at war with the First Men, and had no choice. Bran decides to observe a vision without the Three-Eyed Raven. He witnesses a massive army of wights led by the Night King, who touches him whilst in the vision. Bran awakens to find a mark where he <b>was</b> <b>touched,</b> and the Three-Eyed Raven warns that he must leave, as the Night King is now able to find them.|$|E

40|$|I {{introduce}} a puzzle about contact and de re temporal predication in relativistic spacetime. In particular, I describe an apparent counterexample {{to the following}} principle, roughly stated: if B is never {{in a position to}} say ‘I <b>was</b> <b>touching</b> A, I <b>am</b> <b>touching</b> A, and I will <b>be</b> <b>touching</b> A’, then (time travel aside) A is never in a position to say ‘I <b>was</b> <b>touching</b> B, I <b>am</b> <b>touching</b> B, and I will <b>be</b> <b>touching</b> B’. In the case I present, the most that A is ever in a position to say is: ‘I <b>am</b> now <b>touching</b> B, but this is the only instant at which this will ever be so’. B, on the other hand, can say: ‘I <b>was</b> formerly <b>touching</b> A, I <b>am</b> currently <b>touching</b> A, and I will in the future <b>be</b> <b>touching</b> A’.

5|$|Cho was {{initially}} supposed to enroll at the Moscow University, {{but he was}} robbed at a train station in Omsk. With no money, Cho was stranded and had {{to work at a}} kolkhoz in Omsk for the summer to get some. The rector of the Omsk University, Aleksandr Sergeevitch Slivko <b>was</b> <b>touched</b> by his fate and decided to admit him in the university. Thus, from 1933 until his graduation in 1937, he attended the Faculty of Literature of the Gorky Omsk State Pedagogical University. Although he was not fluent in Russian upon entering the university, he graduated with excellent marks, and his time spent there amplified his Russian and Soviet sides.|$|E
5|$|Laís Bodanzky {{read the}} biographical book Canto dos Malditos by Austregésilo Carrano Bueno {{for the first}} time in 1996, when she was signed to assist with the {{direction}} of a documentary on the subject. She found the book after entering a discussion and research group on mental health in Brazil. Impressed by its narrative, she asked Luiz Bolognesi to adapt it, as she knew he had a similar worldview and would have the respect necessary to work on the subject. Bolognesi was reluctant as he considered it a complicated subject; he was close to giving up until he read and <b>was</b> <b>touched</b> by Paulo Leminski's presentation of the book.|$|E
5|$|As August ended, {{production}} {{continued to}} slip farther behind schedule. Koenig learned {{that rather than}} being released in 14 days after his scenes were completed, his last day would be on October 26—eight weeks later than expected. The next bridge scenes to be filmed after the wormhole sequence, Enterprises approach to V'Ger and the machine's resulting attack, were postponed for two weeks so that the special effects for the scene could be planned and implemented, and the engine room scenes could be shot. Chekov's burns sustained in V'Ger's attack were difficult to film; though the incident took only minutes on film, Weldon spent hours preparing the effect. A piece of aluminum foil was placed around Koenig's arm, covered by a protective pad and then hidden by the uniform sleeve. Weldon prepared an ammonia and acetic acid solution that <b>was</b> <b>touched</b> to Koenig's sleeve, causing it to smoke. Difficulties resulted in the scene being shot ten times; it was especially uncomfortable for the actor, whose arm was slightly burned {{when some of the}} solution leaked through to his arm.|$|E

40|$|In our research, {{we aim to}} {{construct}} the visual-haptic system which generate haptic feedback as if they <b>were</b> <b>touching</b> {{on the surface of}} various virtual objects, even though they <b>are</b> <b>touching</b> only a static shape. We focus on the cross modal effect between our vision and haptic sense, which is generally called Pseudo-Haptics, and make up a illusionary haptics only using visual feedback, without any complicated physical devices. In our system, user touches the physical object behind the LCD, and sees the virtual object through the LCD using video see-through methodology. We put two web cameras to provide the different image for each eye and maintain the optical conjugation between viewpoint and cameras using the mirror {{in the back of the}} LCD. From images captured by these cameras, we compose visual feedback as if they <b>were</b> <b>touching</b> another virtual shape, based on the detection of the point where they <b>are</b> <b>touching</b> the physical object. This makes up a haptic illusion as if they <b>were</b> <b>touching</b> the virtual shape. By our proposed system, users perceive visual and haptic sensation as if they <b>were</b> <b>touching</b> various virtual shapes, without any complicated physical devices...|$|R

5|$|In {{the second}} quarter, Mississippi came {{storming}} back. Following the field goal, Tech head coach Jerry Claiborne ordered an onside kick {{in an effort}} to gain another chance on offense and potentially build an insurmountable lead. Onside kicks, unlike an ordinary free kick, can be recovered by the kicking team—but only after the ball has traveled 10 yards. If the kicking team touches the ball before it has traveled 10 yards, the receiving team takes possession at the place the ball <b>was</b> <b>touched.</b> Unfortunately for Virginia Tech, Simsak's onside kick—though it surprised Ole Miss—did not travel the requisite 10 yards. Mississippi took over at the Virginia Tech 49-yard line, and many of the Ole Miss players were angered by what they considered to be an insult.|$|E
5|$|The 1936–37 MCC tour of Australia under G.O. Allen was the {{occasion}} of Cardus's {{first visit to the}} country. During the tour he made, or consolidated, friendships with players and colleagues including C. B. Fry and Donald Bradman. Fry, a former England cricket captain, was a boyhood hero of Cardus, and was covering the Tests for the London Evening Standard. In Bradman, Cardus found a sophistication and sensitivity that other writers had failed to detect. When interviewed on his arrival in Australia, Cardus speculated how he would cope for the six months of the tour without music; he <b>was</b> <b>touched</b> when the following day music students in Perth gave him a private recital of music by Chopin and Hugo Wolf. During this tour Cardus wrote for The Herald in Melbourne, and broadcast about cricket on Australian radio.|$|E
5|$|The {{three types}} of {{scrimmage}} kicks are place kicks, drop kicks, and punts. Only place kicks and drop kicks can score points. The place kick is the standard method used to score points, because the pointy shape of the football {{makes it difficult to}} reliably drop kick. Once the ball has been kicked from a scrimmage kick, it can be advanced by the kicking team only if it is caught or recovered behind the line of scrimmage. If it is touched or recovered by the kicking team beyond this line, it becomes dead at the spot where it <b>was</b> <b>touched.</b> The kicking team is prohibited from interfering with the receiver's opportunity to catch the ball, and the receiving team has the option of signaling for a fair catch. This prohibits the defense from blocking into or tackling the receiver, but the play ends as soon as the ball is caught and the ball may not be advanced.|$|E

5|$|While on Second Miltia, MOMO, Ziggy, {{chaos and}} Jr. are {{attacked}} by U-TIC agents in powerful mechs, only being saved by Canaan's intervention. Shion meanwhile has an uncomfortable reunion with Jin, as she blames his absence {{for the deaths}} of their parents during the Miltian Conflict. In the hours leading up to MOMO's scan, both Jr. and his brother Gaignun are telepathically tormented by Albedo, who still cannot decode the data he stole from MOMO. During the procedure, a virus implanted in MOMO by Albedo activates, and MOMO fragments her own personality to keep Mizrahi's data secure. Shion, Jr. {{and the rest of the}} group enter MOMO's subconscious to save her. During this period, Jr. reveals himself to have been part of an experiment by Dmitri Yuriev: Yuriev's wish was to create an existence which would neutralize U-DO. The three were close, but Albedo became disturbed when he discovered his ability to survive any injury was unique to him, meaning he could outlive his brothers. During an experiment, Jr. broke the circuit containing a portion of U-DO, resulting in everyone except himself, Albedo and Gaignun being killed. Albedo <b>was</b> <b>touched</b> by U-DO and went insane, while Gaignun remained unaffected. As they save MOMO, Albedo hacks in and tricks MOMO into releasing the decoded data to him. Using the data, Albedo opens the way to Miltia.|$|E
5|$|While {{the rain}} had stopped come race time, the track was still wet and {{slippery}} and all drivers opted to start on intermediate tyres. Hamilton got away better at the start, entering the first corner alongside pole-sitter Rosberg and, by forcing the German wide, took the lead exiting turn one. Getting off track saw Rosberg lose additional positions, running fifth behind Hamilton, Kvyat, Ricciardo and Pérez. Further back, a collision involved Alonso, Massa, the two Sauber cars of Ericsson and Nasr as well as Bottas, who made a pit stop after the first lap, as did Nasr, who was the first to fit slick tyres, as the track was starting to dry. Will Stevens <b>was</b> <b>touched</b> from behind by teammate Alexander Rossi, breaking his rear wing and forcing him to retire. Having started {{from the back of the}} grid, Carlos Sainz profited from the incidents and was up to tenth by the end of the first lap. While Rosberg soon took back fourth from Pérez, Hamilton in front came under pressure from Kvyat, with the Red Bull drivers running fast in the damp conditions. With Kvyat just half a second behind the championship leader, a virtual safety car period was declared on lap five to clear the debris from the first corner incident. On lap 7, Valtteri Bottas retired with a damper failure caused by the turn one contact. When the virtual safety car ended on lap 8, Rosberg made an immediate move on Ricciardo to move into third, overtaking Kvyat for second on the same lap. Romain Grosjean became another victim of the accident on lap one, when he came into the pit lane for a second time on lap 12 and retired. By the same time, Sebastian Vettel had moved up into sixth place from thirteenth on the grid. Up front, Kvyat went wide while trying to overtake Rosberg, allowing teammate Ricciardo through into third; Ricciardo in turn made a successful manoeuvre on Rosberg to move up into second.|$|E
