25|$|At St John's {{the design}} is even more complex, because, {{near the top of}} the upper window, the tower itself {{suddenly}} appears to become octagonal in horizontal section, before the spire is reached. The change to the section is masked by the presence of four large pinnacles which rise from the corners at this point, as if they <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> buttresses but are in line with the tower itself. Behind the pinnacles, once again Blacket has placed an encircling battlement which appears to mark the point where the tower ceases to be tower and becomes spire, or vice versa. Harmonious with the four crocketed pinnacles, and on the same level, are little dormer windows.|$|E
25|$|McLendon {{began his}} attacks about 3:30p.m. on March 10, 2009 at his mother's house {{where they lived}} in Kinston, a town of 540 residents. McLendon shot and killed his mother and their three dogs, and set the {{interior}} of the house on fire. He drove to his uncle's house in the small city of Samson, population about 2,000. There he shot his uncle, two cousins, a neighbor, and said neighbor's infant daughter, all of whom <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> porch of his uncle and aunt's house. His aunt escaped the shooting uninjured because she was inside the house, while the neighbor's four-month-old daughter survived her gunshot wounds. McLendon went next door and shot and killed his maternal grandmother.|$|E

500|$|By 1967, Egyptian forces relied {{exclusively}} on defending a triangle linking Hodeida, Taiz and San'a, while striking southern Saudi Arabia and North Yemen with air sorties. In August, 1967, {{in order to}} make up for the 15,000 Egyptian killed, captured or missing, as a result of the Six-Day War, Nasser recalled 15,000 of his troops from Yemen. Egypt imposed higher taxes on its [...] middle and upper classes, raised workers' compulsory monthly savings by 50%, reduced overtime pay, cut the sugar ration by a third, and curtailed practically all major industrial programs. Only military [...] expenditures were increased, by $140 million to an estimated $1 billion. Nasser also increased the price of beer, [...] cigarettes, long-distance bus and railroad fares and admission to movies. Egypt was losing $5,000,000 a week in revenues from the closing of the Suez Canal, on the other side of which, the Israelis <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Sinai wells that had produced half of Egypt's oil supply. Egypt's hard-currency debt was now approaching $1.5 billion and its foreign-exchange reserves were down to $100 million.|$|E
500|$|A {{few days}} later, {{hundreds}} of people participated in a protest and march organized by UVA faculty as [...] "part {{of a series of}} responses to the recently published Rolling Stone article". A student quoted in The Daily Progress said that men at a nearby bar were [...] "quick to yell 'insults and slurs' at the protestors as they walked by". A local business owner expressed support of non-violent demonstrations and told The Cavalier Daily that [...] "The only way thing change is if you talk about what's happening." [...] The march ended outside of the Phi Kappa Psi house where protesters challenged a perceived [...] "culture of sexual assault at the University". Community members offered suggestions for immediate steps administration could take to implement preventative measures and address safety concerns regarding sexual assault. One student protestor told The Cavalier Daily: [...] "I really hope the University takes this article and the protest movement as a sign {{that they need to be}} more transparent about the way they deal with sexual assault." [...] Four participants who <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> steps to the Phi Kappa Psi house were arrested on trespassing charges for refusing to move when police officers asked them to leave.|$|E
500|$|Will & Grace creators Max Mutchnick and David Kohan based {{the show}} on their own lives. Mutchnick, who is openly gay, based the {{relationship}} between Will and Grace on his real-life relationship with a woman named Janet. Originally, Mutchnick and Kohan first went to the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), who told them to create a television series about a new young love story, as Mad About You was going off the air. The character of Will {{was part of a}} sitcom Mutchnick and Kohan first pitched to NBC executives in 1997. The original concept was an ensemble comedy featuring three couples, one of which was a gay man living with a straight woman. Warren Littlefield, the executive vice president of NBC at the time, was not excited about the first two couples, but wanted {{to learn more about the}} gay and straight couple, so Mutchnick and Kohan was sent to create a pilot script centering on those two characters. NBC went to sitcom director James Burrows to see what he thought of the homosexual subject matter and if an audience would be interested in the show. Burrows liked the idea and when he first read the script in November 1997, he decided that he wanted to direct it. Burrows said, [...] "I knew that the boys had captured a genre and a group of characters I have never read before." [...] The filming of the pilot began in March 1998. The actors who played Will and Grace, Eric McCormack and Debra Messing, were positive about the series and they thought it had the potential to last on television. McCormack said, [...] "When shooting was finished that night, Debra and I <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> couch and looking at each other and I said, ‘We’re gonna be on this set for a while.’ And we sort of clasped hands, but we didn’t want to say anything beyond that and jinx it." ...|$|E

During a Taizé gathering in Paris in 1995, he spoke to more than 100,000 young people who <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor of an exhibition hall.

Mrs. Inglis had kept a diary of the events during the siege of Lucknow to which she added her account of the wreck:We made good progress all that day (Tuesday). It was eight o'clock, a beautiful night, and we were running along at a great pace. Finding it very hot in the saloon after tea, [...] had come on deck, and <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bulwarks behind the wheel. Suddenly we were startled by a loud grating sound something like the letting down of an anchor, and just then saw a large rock close to us. I said, 'We must have touched that.' Several men rushed to the wheel, and then again we heard the same sound, only louder, and a quivering of the whole ship. She then remained stationary, only heaving backwards and forwards.|$|E
