50|$|One of {{the most}} {{difficult}} aspects of the rule <b>of</b> <b>succession</b> is not the mathematical formulas, but answering the question: When does the rule <b>of</b> <b>succession</b> apply? In the generalisation section, it was noted very explicitly by adding the prior information Im into the calculations. Thus, when all that is known about a phenomenon is that there are m known possible outcomes prior to observing any data, only then does the rule <b>of</b> <b>succession</b> apply. If the rule <b>of</b> <b>succession</b> is applied in problems where this does not accurately describe the prior state of knowledge, then it may give counter-intuitive results. This is not because the rule <b>of</b> <b>succession</b> is defective, but that it is effectively answering a different question, based on different prior information.|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} family farms and characteristics affecting farm succession. Based {{on a farm}} survey, three aspects <b>of</b> <b>succession</b> are analysed in the paper: the probability of family succession; the likelihood of having a successor designated; and the timing <b>of</b> <b>succession.</b> Large and specialised farms {{are more likely to}} be transferred within the family and to have appointed a successor. The number of family members, as well as the experience of farm operator, is also significantly related to the succession behaviour. The probabilities <b>of</b> <b>succession,</b> and <b>of</b> having a successor, first increase with age and then decline again. Furthermore, timing <b>of</b> <b>succession</b> is delayed as the farm holder ages, suggesting most farm operator's succession plans to be inconsistent over time. In addition, we find a significant interrelationship between the different aspects <b>of</b> <b>succession</b> indicating that decisions on family <b>succession,</b> the designation <b>of</b> a successor, as well as the timing <b>of</b> <b>succession,</b> are not separable.

40|$|The law <b>of</b> <b>succession</b> is {{a branch}} of civil law that deals with {{devolution}} of property rights and duties of a decedent to his heirs. The new Civil Code that came into force in 2014 brought considerable changes {{in the field of}} the law <b>of</b> <b>succession.</b> Finally, the legal regulation pays proper attention to the law <b>of</b> <b>succession</b> and testate succession. After more than sixty years, there were restored legal institutions such as Clauses of lesser importance in a testament (condition, determination of time or a mandate), inheritance contract, privileged wills, legacy, vulgar substitution or fideicommissum. Not only because of these institutions can a testator finally organize freely and according to his own will his property situation mortis causa. The purpose of my diploma thesis is to analyze the testate succession according to the Czech Civil code that became effective on the 1 st of January 2014. The thesis is divided into two parts. The first part is split into five chapters that deal with individual prerequisites <b>of</b> <b>succession.</b> The prerequisites <b>of</b> <b>succession</b> are as follows: the death of a testator, the existence of a decedent's estate, the capacity of an heir to inherit, the legal ground <b>of</b> <b>succession</b> and the acceptance/non-refusal of inheritance. Meeting all prerequisites <b>of</b> <b>succession</b> is crucial to [...] ...|$|R

40|$|The law <b>of</b> <b>succession</b> {{has been}} changed a lot by {{enacting}} the new Civil Code in many ways but its main purpose is still to regulate the <b>succession</b> <b>of</b> inheritance from testator to heirs and related problems. This thesis makes an analysis <b>of</b> testate <b>succession,</b> {{which is one of}} the three possibilities <b>of</b> inheritance <b>succession.</b> The second is an intestate succession, which applies in the situation, when testator did not wrote last will. The last possibility is a contract between testator and heirs distributing inheritance between the latter. This contract has bigger legal force than last will and intestate succession is used, if there is none of them. The thesis consists of five chapters. Chapter One provides a brief introduction to history of the law <b>of</b> <b>succession</b> in our territory and presents the purpose of the thesis. Chapter Two deals with the questions common to the whole law <b>of</b> <b>succession,</b> it is divided in three subchapters, which talk about the main principles of the law <b>of</b> <b>succession</b> and legal rules regulating it and also about preconditions <b>of</b> <b>succession,</b> which include death of testator, subjective law <b>of</b> <b>succession,</b> existence <b>of</b> inheritance and legal ground to the succession.
