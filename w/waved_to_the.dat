5|$|An {{estimated}} 10,000 people met the Birmingham City {{party on}} {{their return to}} Snow Hill station. The players, {{in the first of}} a convoy of four coaches, <b>waved</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> assembled crowds through the open sun-roof as they proceeded to the Council House, where the Lord Mayor welcomed them on behalf of the city. Len Boyd addressed the crowds from the balcony before the coaches continued through the city centre and back to St Andrew's, Birmingham City's home ground. The following Wednesday, a dinner was held to honour the club's achievements. Guests included the 84-year-old Billy Walton, who had joined the club in 1888, six members of Birmingham's 1931 cup final team, and a trade delegation from the Soviet city of Sverdlovsk.|$|E
5|$|On June 9, Reagan's casket {{was removed}} from the presidential library and driven in a {{motorcade}} to NAS Point Mugu in Oxnard, California; it was the same airfield Reagan flew into and out of during his presidency when visiting his California ranch. SAM 28000, one of the two Boeing 747-200s, which usually serves the president as Air Force One, arrived to transport the casket to Washington. Thousands of people gathered to witness the plane's departure. Just before she boarded the VC-25A Presidential Aircraft, Nancy Reagan <b>waved</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> crowd with her military escort at her side. The plane lifted off at about 9:40am PST.|$|E

40|$|It is {{well-known}} that the rarefaction wave, one of <b>the</b> basic <b>wave</b> patterns <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hyperbolic conservation laws, is nonlinearly stable <b>to</b> <b>the</b> one-dimensional compressible Navier-Stokes equations (cf.

25|$|Governor Dukakis {{attempted}} to quell criticism {{that he was}} ignorant on military matters by staging a photo op in which he rode in an M1 Abrams tank outside a General Dynamics plant in Sterling Heights, Michigan. The move ended up being regarded as a major public relations blunder, with many mocking Dukakis's appearance as he <b>waved</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> crowd from the tank. Footage of Dukakis {{was used by the}} Bush campaign as evidence he would not make a good commander-in-chief, and the incident remains a commonly cited example of backfired public relations outings.|$|E
25|$|On August 26, 2011, Fredette {{announced}} his engagement to BYU cheerleader Whitney Wonnacott on Twitter. They were married on June 1, 2012, in the Denver LDS Temple. He {{missed the first}} playoff game in the CBA playoffs of 2017 because he traveled home to Denver, Colorado, {{to be with his}} wife during the birth of their first child. Upon his return he scored 39 points in overtime to give his team the win. While exiting the court he <b>waved</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> camera and told his wife and child he was bringing them home a championship.|$|E
25|$|In early October, the PC-1264 {{was honored}} by being {{selected}} {{as one of}} forty-seven representative warships {{for a review of}} the fleet by President Truman on Navy Day, 27 October. On 24 October, she sailed from Norfolk to New York, where the review was to be held. Soon after the PC-1264 left Norfolk, her new commanding officer, Lieutenant (jg) Jack Sutherland, arrivedâ€”after traveling there from New York! He was sent back to New York and arrived there soon after his new command. However, he would not take command until after Navy Day. The PC-1264, as the smallest vessel, was {{at the tail end of}} the Fleet review. However, President Truman, on board the destroyer USS Renshaw, circled the PC-1264 and <b>waved</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> crew.|$|E

25|$|The 1965 Southern 500 at Darlington Raceway {{was one of}} {{the wildest}} races in NASCAR history. Rookie driver Buren Skeen died after two cars ran into the side of his car in the early laps. Sam McQuagg was leading the race, when Cale Yarborough tried to muscle past McQuagg for the lead. Yarborough flew over the guardrail, rolled around six times, and ended {{up at the end of}} the parking lot by a light post. Yarborough <b>waved</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> crowd as he walked back to the pits. A video clip of the wreck was used on ABC's Wide World of Sports for several years. With 44 laps left, Fred Lorenzen and Darel Dieringer were {{fighting}} for the lead far ahead of Jarrett. Lorenzen's motor expired, and even before he could get into the pits Dieringer's motor started smoking too. Dieringer continued at a slower pace to finish third. The race was won by Ned Jarrett by 14 laps and 2 car lengths or 19.25 miles, which is the farthest margin of victory in NASCAR history (in terms of miles).|$|E
25|$|In 1970 {{the line}} was {{featured}} in the British drama film The Railway Children. The line {{was one of only}} a few heritage railways in the UK and was the only one at the time which had a tunnel (this {{was one of the most}} important locations needed for the film). The tunnel used is a lot shorter in reality than it appears in the film, for which a temporary extension to the tunnel was made using canvas covers. Locomotives that were chosen for the film included a Hudswell Clarke 0-6-0T no 31 Hamburg, GWR 5700 0-6-0PT no 5775, Lancashire & Yorkshire Railway 0-6-0 no 957 & GNR N2 0-6-2T no 1744. Railway locations used in the film included Mytholmes Tunnel near Haworth, the location for the paper chase scene was also shot at Mytholmes, as well as the one in which the children wave the girls' petticoats in the air to warn the train about a landslide. The landslide sequence itself was filmed in a cutting on the Oakworth side of Mytholmes Tunnel and the fields of long grass where the children <b>waved</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> trains are situated on the Haworth side of the tunnel.|$|E
500|$|The piece {{opened in}} {{conjunction}} with {{the annual meeting of the}} Music Critics Association, guaranteeing what the Houston Chronicle described as a [...] "very discriminating audience". [...] Members of the association also attended meetings with the opera's production team. [...] When Carolann Page, originating Pat Nixon, <b>waved</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> audience in character as First Lady, many waved back at her. Adams responded to complaints that the words were difficult to understand (no supertitles were provided) by indicating that it is not necessary that all the words be understood on first seeing an opera. [...] The audience's general reaction was expressed by what the Los Angeles Times termed [...] "polite applause", the descent of the Spirit of '76 being the occasion for clapping from both the onstage chorus and from the viewers in the opera house.|$|E

500|$|Matters {{came to a}} head in London in May in {{what became}} known as the [...] "Victoria Station incident". Arriving in an open-top Mercedes convertible, Bowie <b>waved</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> crowd in a gesture that some alleged was a Nazi salute, which was {{captured}} on camera and published in NME. Bowie said the photographer simply caught him in mid-wave. He later blamed his pro-fascism comments and his behaviour during the period on his addictions and the character of the Thin White Duke. [...] "I was out of my mind, totally crazed. The main thing I was functioning on was mythology... that whole thing about Hitler and Rightism... I'd discovered King Arthur". According to playwright Alan Franks, writing later in The Times, [...] "he was indeed 'deranged'. He had some very bad experiences with hard drugs." [...] Bowie's cocaine addiction, which had caused these controversies, had much to do with his time living in Los Angeles, a city which alienated him hugely. Discussing his flirtations with fascism in a 1980 interview with NME, Bowie explained that Los Angeles was [...] "where it had all happened. The fucking place should be wiped off the face of the Earth. To be anything to do with rock and roll and go and live in Los Angeles is, I think, just heading for disaster. It really is." ...|$|E
500|$|Becoming a {{restricted}} free agent on July 1, 2010, Raymond filed for salary arbitration after initially failing {{to come to}} terms with the Canucks. However, the two sides later agreed to a two-year, $5.1 million contract on July 26, 2010, before their arbitration hearing scheduled for the same day. The deal pays Raymond $2.5 million in the first year and $2.6 million in the second â€“ a raise from his $760,000 salary from the previous season. It was reported the Canucks had proposed an annual $2.3 million salary, while Raymond had wanted $3.6 million. Several months into the 2010â€“11 season, he suffered a broken thumb and missed 10 games in December 2010. Raymond struggled in the first year of his new contract and he was often demoted off of the second line. As a result, he finished with diminished season totals of 15 goals, 24 assists and 39 points over 70 games. On a team basis, the Canucks won their first-ever Presidents' Trophy, having accomplished the best regular-season record in the NHL that year. Entering the 2011 playoffs as the first seed in the West, they eliminated the Chicago Blackhawks, Nashville Predators and San Jose Sharks in the first three rounds to advance to the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time in 17 years. During his first shift of Game 6 against the Boston Bruins, Raymond suffered a fractured vertebra after getting hit by opposing defenceman Johnny Boychuk. With Raymond's body twisted to try to retrieve a loose puck, he was engaged by Boychuk, who proceeded to hit him into the boards after the puck had gone by. Bent over at the time of the hit, Raymond collided with the boards tailbone-first. He was taken to the hospital after initially being helped off the ice. Raymond later described the injury as [...] "the most pain [...] been in ever." [...] No penalty was called on the play nor did Boychuk receive any discipline from the league following the game, which drew public criticism from Canucks general manager Mike Gillis. Vancouver went on to lose Games 6 and 7 as Boston won the Stanley Cup. Raymond made an appearance in Rogers Arena prior to the final game of the series. Wearing a plastic corset to support his back, he <b>waved</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> crowd, who gave him a standing ovation.|$|E
2500|$|In 1972, Spitz {{was accused}} of product {{placement}} during the medal ceremony. Following the 200-meter freestyle race Spitz arrived to obtain his gold medal barefoot and carrying his shoes. [...] He put them down when the American national anthem, [...] "The Star Spangled Banner" [...] was played. [...] After the anthem played, {{he picked up his}} shoes and <b>waved</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> crowd. [...] The Soviets saw this as product placement. [...] When questioned by the IOC, Spitz explained that the gesture was innocent, the shoes were old and he was not paid. [...] The IOC cleared him of any wrongdoing.|$|E

2500|$|Rita Marley, Bob Marley's wife, {{converted}} to the Rastafari faith after seeing Haile Selassie on his Jamaican trip. She claimed in interviews (and {{in her book}} No Woman, No Cry) that she saw a stigmata print on the palm of Haile Selassie's hand as he <b>waved</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> crowd which resembled the markings on Christ's hands from being nailed to the crossâ€”a claim that was not supported by other sources, but was used as evidence for her and other Rastafari to suggest that Haile Selassie I was indeed their messiah. She was also influential in the conversion of Bob Marley, who then became internationally recognized. As a result, Rastafari became much better known {{throughout much of the}} world. Bob Marley's posthumously released song [...] "Iron Lion Zion" [...] refers to Haile Selassie.|$|E
2500|$|Taking full {{advantage}} of his [...] "trusty" [...] status, Alton escaped with a fellow inmate in a prison vehicle marked [...] "Registrar of Motor Vehicles" [...] on 26 August 1958, the day after Floyd Powell started his job as warden. [...] The two prisoners <b>waved</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> new warden on their way past the prison, and Powell waved back. [...] By the time the warden realized what had happened, Alton and his confederate were {{too far away to}} do anything. [...] Alton managed to stay hidden until November 1958, when he was apprehended in his hometown of Culbertson. [...] He was remanded to the prison and spent time in the hole, then more time in segregation. [...] It was during this time that he met, and had extensive conversations with, Jerry Myles, who had been placed in the cell right next to Alton's in segregation.|$|E
2500|$|On October 15, 2008, Wallenda {{performed}} on a live broadcast of Today. The {{plan was to}} walk and then bicycle off {{the roof of the}} Prudential Center in Downtown Newark, New Jersey, across a suspended high-wire 13 and 1/2 stories (135feet) above the ground. Starting at 8:30am, he first walked across the [...] cable with a [...] balancing pole. Halfway through, {{he sat down on the}} wire and called the Today show hosts. [...] "Where are you?" [...] he asked, joking that he was expecting to carry one of the show's hosts across the wire on his shoulder. Sitting down on the wire is easy, he said, it is getting back up that is tricky. A few steps before completing the walk, Wallenda stopped and <b>waved</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> crowd. When he resumed, he wobbled and had to bend his knees to regain balance. [...] "I actually slipped," [...] he said later. [...] "I lost focus there for a moment" [...] because of some unexpected tape on the wire. He completed the walk in about five minutes.|$|E

2500|$|Rain delays had {{canceled}} the live telecast of the race, and most fans first {{learned of the}} accident during the night's sports newscasts. Video of the crash showed {{what appeared to be}} a fatal incident, but once medical workers arrived at the car, Earnhardt climbed out and <b>waved</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> crowd, refusing to be loaded onto a stretcher despite a broken collarbone, sternum, and shoulder blade. Many thought the incident would end his season early, but Earnhardt refused to give up. The next week at Indianapolis, he started the race but exited the car on the first pit stop, allowing Mike Skinner to take the wheel. When asked, Earnhardt said that vacating the No. 3 car was the hardest thing he had ever done. The following weekend at Watkins Glen, he drove the No. 3 Goodwrench Chevrolet to the fastest time in qualifying, earning the [...] "True Grit" [...] pole. T-shirts emblazoned with Earnhardt's face were quickly printed up, brandishing the caption, [...] "It Hurt So Good". Earnhardt led for most of the race and looked to have victory in hand, but fatigue took its toll and he ended up sixth behind race winner Geoff Bodine. Earnhardt did not win again in 1996 but still finished fourth in the standings behind Terry Labonte, Jeff Gordon, and Dale Jarrett. David Smith departed as crew chief of the No. 3 team and RCR at the end of the year for personal reasons, and he was replaced by Larry McReynolds.|$|E
