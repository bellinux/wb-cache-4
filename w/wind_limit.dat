40|$|Abstract. The Rothermel {{surface fire}} spread model {{includes}} a wind speed limit, above which predicted {{rate of spread}} is constant. Complete derivation of the <b>wind</b> <b>limit</b> {{as a function of}} reaction intensity is given, along with an alternate result based on a changed assumption. Evidence indicates that both the original and the revised wind limits are too restrictive. <b>Wind</b> <b>limit</b> is based in part on data collected on the 7 February 1967 Tasmanian grassland fires. A reanalysis of the data indicates that these firesmight not have been spreading in fully cured continuous grasslands, as assumed. In addition,more recent grassfire data do not support the wind speed limit. The authors recommend that, in place of the current <b>wind</b> <b>limit,</b> rate of spread be limited to effective midflame wind speed. The Rothermel model is the foundation of many wildland fire modelling systems. Imposition of the <b>wind</b> <b>limit</b> can significantly affect results and potentially influence fire and fuel management decisions...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} photon {{frequency}} redistribution by line branching on mass-loss rates for hot luminous stars is investigated. Monte Carlo simulations {{are carried out}} {{for a range of}} OB-star models which show that previous mass-loss calculations which neglect non-resonance line scattering overestimate mass-loss rates for luminous O stars by ~ 20 per cent. For luminous B stars the effect is somewhat larger, typically ~ 50 per cent. A Wolf-Rayet star model is used to investigate line branching in the strong <b>wind</b> <b>limit.</b> In this case the effect of line branching is much greater, giving mass-loss rates that are smaller by a factor ~ 3 from computations which neglect branching.

40|$|We {{report on}} the {{identification}} of 22 new cool DO-type white dwarfs (WD) detected in Data Release 10 (DR 10) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Among them, we found one more member of the so-called hot-wind DO WDs, which show ultrahigh excitation absorption lines. Our non-LTE model atmosphere analyses of these objects and two not previously analyzed hot-wind DO WDs, revealed effective temperatures and gravities in the ranges Teff= 45 - 80 kK and log g= 7. 50 - 8. 75. In eight of the spectra we found traces of C (0. 001 - 0. 01, by mass). Two of these are the coolest DO WDs ever discovered that still show {{a considerable amount of}} C in their atmospheres. This is in strong contradiction with diffusion calculations, and probably, similar to what is proposed for DB WDs, a weak mass-loss is present in DO WDs. One object is the most massive DO WD discovered so far with a mass of 1. 07 M_sun if it is an ONe-WD or 1. 09 M_sun if it is a CO-WD. We furthermore present the mass distribution of all known hot non-DA (pre-) WDs and derive the hot DA to non-DA ratio for the SDSS DR 7 spectroscopic sample. The mass distribution of DO WDs beyond the <b>wind</b> <b>limit</b> strongly deviates from the mass distribution of the objects before the <b>wind</b> <b>limit.</b> We address this phenomenon by applying different evolutionary input channels. We argue that the DO WD channel may be fed by about 13 % by post-extreme-horizontal branch stars and that PG 1159 stars and O(He) stars may contribute in a similar extent to the non-DA WD channel.

40|$|During {{modification}} of a Gulfstream III test bed aircraft for an experimental flap project, all roll spoiler hardware {{had to be}} removed to accommodate the test article. In addition to evaluating the effects on performance and flying qualities resulting from the modification, the test team had to determine crosswind limits for an airplane previously certified with roll spoilers. Predictions for the modified aircraft indicated the maximum amount of steady state sideslip available during the approach and landing phase would be limited by aileron authority rather than by rudder. Operating out of a location that tends to be very windy, an arbitrary and conservative <b>wind</b> <b>limit</b> would have either been overly restrictive or potentially unsafe if chosen poorly. When determining a crosswind limit, how much reserve roll authority was necessary? Would the aircraft, as configured, have suitable handling qualities for long-term use as a flying test bed? To answer these questions, the test team combined two typical flight test techniques into a new maneuver called the sideslip-to-bank maneuver, and was able to gather flying qualities data, evaluate aircraft response and measure trends for various crosswind scenarios. This paper will describe the research conducted, the maneuver, flight conditions, predictions, and results from this in-flight evaluation of crosswind capability...|$|E

40|$|We {{calculate}} radiatively driven wind {{models of}} main-sequence B stars {{and provide the}} wind mass-loss rates and terminal velocities. The main-sequence mass-loss rate strongly depends on the stellar effective temperature. For the hottest B stars the mass-loss rate amounts to 10 ^- 9 M_ year^- 1, while for the cooler ones themass-loss rate is lower by more than three orders of magnitude. Main-sequence B stars with solar abundance and effective temperatures lower than about 15 000 K (later than spectral type B 5) {{do not have any}} homogeneous line-driven wind. We predict the wind mass-loss rates for the solar chemical composition and for the modified abundance of heavier elements to study the winds of chemically peculiar stars. The mass-loss rate may either increase or decrease with increasing abundance, depending on the importance of the induced emergent flux redistribution. Stars with overabundant silicon may have homogeneous winds even below the solar abundance <b>wind</b> <b>limit</b> at 15 000 K. The winds of main-sequence B stars lie below the static limit, that is, a static atmosphere solution is also possible. This points to an important problem regarding the initiation of these winds. We discuss the implications of our models for rotational braking, filling the magnetosphere of Bp stars, and for chemically peculiar stars.

40|$|Here, the {{mechanism}} behind {{the collapse of}} turbulence in the evening is investigated as a precursor to {{the onset of the}} very stable boundary layer. A cooled, pressure-driven flow is investigated by means of a local similarity model. Simulations reveal a temporary collapse of turbulence whenever the surface heat extraction, expressed in its non-dimensional form h/L, exceeds a critical value. As any temporary reduction of turbulent friction is followed by flow acceleration, the long-term state is unconditionally turbulent. In contrast, the temporary cessation of turbulence, which may actually last for several hours in the nocturnal boundary layer, can be understood {{from the fact that the}} time scale for boundary layer diffusion is much smaller than the time-scale for flow acceleration. This limits the available momentum that can be used for downward heat transport. In case the surface heat extraction exceeds the so-called maximum sustainable heat flux (MSHF), the near-surface inversion rapidly increases. Turbulent activity is largely suppressed by the intense density stratification which supports the emergence of a different, calmer boundary layer regime. Finally, results are translated into a practical model to predict the minimum wind speed for sustained turbulence in the atmosphere. It is shown that under clear sky conditions 5 m/s is the typical geostrophic <b>wind</b> <b>limit</b> for Cabauw, below which continuous turbulence cannot be sustained. Below this threshold therefore the emergence of the very stable nocturnal boundary regime is foreseen...|$|E
40|$|The {{demand for}} energy is still increasing, {{together}} {{with the desire to}} create more durable solutions. Wind energy is currently {{one of the most promising}} ways to provide both. A shortage of suitable land sites was the main reason for considering the location of the wind farms offshore, which also offers higher wind speeds. A problem however is formed by the low accessibility during periods of high wind speeds. This low accessibility could lead to a decrease in availability of the system and high O&M cost, both unfavourable for the levelised production cost and thus the profitability of the system. The levelised production costs have long been used as the main criterion in the evaluation of a farm design. In a private energy market, the system however should be optimised to maximise profit. At present energy prices the difference this gives for the optimisation of the farm and its O&M can be neglected. The goal of this thesis is the optimisation of operations and maintenance on Offshore Wind Energy Conversion Systems with a probabilistic model. A number of previously executed studies were used to determine what input parameters should playa role. This showed that all subsystems contribute significantly to the initial capital cost, O&M cost and the unavailability of the system. The model should take into account that periods of low accessibility coincide with periods of high energy potential. The model is based on a state-space model of each component. A component can find itself in the states "Failed", "Corrective Maintenance", "Preventive Maintenance" or "Available". Each component in the system is part of the chain connection that transports the produced energy to shore. If this chain is broken by a failure the loss in production capacity is determined by the place of the component in the chain. The failure of a component is determined by a Monte Carlo simulation. The reliability of components decreases in time according to a certain decline rate. After the execution of PM or CM the initial reliability will be restored. The program, written in visual basic, shows results according to predictions by hand calculations and results from other studies. It can be used to optimise the system. A simulation of the base case showed that the turbines are the main cause of unavailability and cost. The main cost drivers of ICC are turbines and their support structure. As expected the main O&M costs are caused by the turbine and in particular the rotors. The turbines are also the main cause of unavailability: 7 % compared to around 2 % for the shore- and grid connection. There is a relationship between unavailability of the system and the occurrence of high wind speeds. It shows a decline in availability of about 5 % for wind speeds higher than the <b>wind</b> <b>limit</b> of used O&M tools. This results in a loss of revenues of about 2 % per year. The relationship between PM interval, failure- and decline rate has been investigated. The first results indicate a trend towards a decreased need for PM than the intervals used in the base case. The influence of the decline in reliability can be neglected for decline rates up to 25 %. The program can be further improved by accounting for the availability of spare parts and crew or enabling more decision rules for the execution of O&M. Civil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
