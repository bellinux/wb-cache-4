Wonder Where, named by Maloney, was bred at Frank Selke's farm in Quebec and bought by Maloney and Smythe in 1957. In 1959, Wonder <b>Where</b> <b>had</b> an {{outstanding}} season, including winning the Canadian Oaks. The horse was voted Canadian Horse of the Year for the year and later, the filly was inducted in the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame. The Wonder Where Stakes was established in honour of the horse in 1965, becoming one of the Canadian Triple Tiara races for fillies in Canada in 1995. After the outstanding year in 1959, Maloney wanted to continue racing Wonder Where and Smythe did not, concerned over some tendon trouble. The horse broke down in a race in Fort Erie, and the partnership dissolved after that.|$|E

25|$|The Catholicosate of the Armenian Apostolic Church {{followed}} {{its people}} in taking refuge {{outside of the}} Armenian highlands, which {{had turned into a}} battleground of Byzantine and Seljuk contenders. Its seat was first transferred to Sebasteia in 1058 in Cappadocia, <b>where</b> <b>had</b> existed a significant Armenian population. Later, it moved to various locations in Cilicia; Tavbloor in 1062; Dzamendav in 1066; Dzovk in 1116; and Hromkla in 1149. During King Levon I's rule, the Catholicos was located in distant Hromkla.

The archbishops' seats were located in Tarsus, Sis, Anazarba, Lambron, and Mamistra. There existed up to sixty monastic houses in Cilicia, although the exact locations of the majority of them remain unclear.|$|E
25|$|Lee {{only took}} five wickets in a match on three {{occasions}} between the New Zealand series and the 2003 Cricket World Cup. Lee came under pressure for his position after taking only five wickets at 46.50 in the three-Test series against Pakistan in 2002. Andy Bichel, who was filling for the injured Jason Gillespie, took eight wickets at 13.25. With the other frontline bowlers all taking wickets {{at less than}} 13, Lee was dropped when Gillespie returned {{for the first two}} Tests during the 2002–03 Ashes series. He returned for the Perth Test, after claiming a five wicket haul in a Pura Cup match against Queensland for New South Wales. He took thirteen wickets at 41.23 in three matches, compared to Bichel's ten at 35.1. After the 2003 Cricket World Cup, Lee took 17 wickets at 28.88 in four Tests against the West Indies.

White recorded the most hit-outs in the league in 2002, with 561, playing in all of Melbourne's matches in a run that saw them narrowly lose to Adelaide by two goals in a semi-final.

He {{was among the first}} American scientists to verify nuclear fission, reporting his results in an article submitted to the Physical Review in February 1939, and collaborated with Edwin McMillan on the discovery of neptunium. Returning to the Carnegie Institution in Washington, D.C., <b>where</b> <b>had</b> a position, he became interested in isotope separation. In July 1940, Ross Gunn from the United States Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) showed him a 1939 paper on the subject by Harold Urey, and Abelson became intrigued by the possibility of using the liquid thermal diffusion process. He began experiments with the process at the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism at the Carnegie Institution. Using potassium chloride (KCl), potassium bromide (KBr), potassium sulfate (...) and potassium dichromate (...) , he was able to achieve a separation factor of 1.2 (20 percent) of the potassium-39 and potassium-41 isotopes.|$|E

Rice had founded the regiment and, within two months of its arrival in Northern Virginia, he turned over his command to Jones. The 154th was part of General Oliver O.

2500|$|Seems Zoya Vinogradova was {{an actress}} only and before {{performance}} of Mister X {{her name and}} family name could be jargoned due to Mister X Intelligence services program. It can be confirmed by jargon [...] "a poisonous snake" [...] with has commencement from 1970-x. One school-girl Zoya and her parents were sent to Odessa in 1974 or 1975 from the Volga region about. She became a school-girl of one school in Odessa. It was needed, that one school-boy Yuriy had to feel the love to this girl Zoya, and it succeeded. Next step was to let know for this boy that Zoya means dangerous. When the boy was looking for this girl she became smile and said roughly: [...] "What are you looking?" [...] Other boys and girl pay attention and it is shamefully for the boy. The poet and writer Alexander Pushkin verse [...] "Oleg Prophetic" [...] {{was included in the}} program of this class during that period. Personage Oleg Prophetic died due to snake bite, the snake was described by the poet as [...] "the snake under a boot tree". The word snake on Russian is [...] "змея" [...] (zmeya), pronunciation is close to Zoya. The boy Yuriy (short name Yura) was looking at the girl Zoya and he thought: [...] "A Snake under a boot tree". In 1977, and of eight class education, girls of this class gave one to another and to some school-boys own special note-books <b>where</b> <b>had</b> to be mentioned any wishes or remarks as last two classes could be completed by girls and boys, who wished to continue education in any institute, high school or academy. It was possible after completion of 10 classes education. Everybody could check what was written by others and the boy Yura sow that Zoy wrote in one note-book: [...] "The love does not exist." [...] Zoya and her parent back from Odessa to Volga region in 1977. The boy Yuriy remembered that it was just switching from the previous love to Zhoya and his love to Zoya was switched off after Zoya departure. Later he understood that behind him was family with equipment and their boy Oleg received nickname [...] "Oleg Prophetic". Seems Zoya arrived in Odessa for short time to mentioned who will stay with equipment behind Yura. Jargon [...] "Zoya" [...] is [...] "a dangerous snake" [...] was promulgated, seems to avoid anybody understand really situation. The boy Yuriy does not call any Zoya as a snake. Really the boy Oleg became a [...] "snake" [...] for Yuriy later. It is example, how new meanings of words could enter the Russian language. It is means that some jargon could enter during the Mister X filming or later. Seems all jargon of the word [...] "виноград" [...] (...) entered during the Mister X filming or later. And really, the festival's bride was a problem for KGB due to plenty questions and misunderstandings.|$|E
