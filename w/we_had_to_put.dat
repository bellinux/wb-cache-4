500|$|Eveanescence cover artwork was {{introduced}} on the band's website on August 30, 2011. It is their first album cover {{which does not}} feature Lee. In an interview, she discussed the cover: [...] "Well, both of our other records are me on the cover, and I think it's cool to have that photo, you know, that people can look at and go, 'OK, that's who that is.' But I feel like, by now, they know who we are, and I wanted something really different. I didn't feel like <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> a photo on the cover, I {{wanted it to be}} more mysterious and more about Evanescence itself, not just me." [...] The cover, black with vapor behind the band's name, is a play on the meaning of [...] "evanescence" [...] ("to dissipate like vapor").|$|E
500|$|Tibbets {{was interviewed}} {{extensively}} by Mike Harden of the Columbus Dispatch, and profiles {{appeared in the}} newspaper on anniversaries of the first dropping of an atomic bomb. In a 1975 interview he said: [...] "I'm proud that I was able to start with nothing, plan it and have it work as perfectly as it did... I sleep clearly every night." [...] "I knew when I got the assignment," [...] he told a reporter in 2005, [...] "it {{was going to be}} an emotional thing. We had feelings, but <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> them in the background. We knew it was going to kill people right and left. But my one driving interest was to do the best job I could so that we could end the killing as quickly as possible." ...|$|E
500|$|In later life, he {{was known}} for his blunt and {{critical}} comments towards modern players, believing the cricket in earlier times to be superior. After Steve Waugh's team set a world record of consecutive Test victories, Harvey named three Australian teams that he thought to be superiors, saying [...] "no, far from it" [...] in response to the suggestion that Waugh's men were the best team in history. He attributed the wins to weak opponents, stating [...] "No I don't think they're up to the world standard they were years ago" [...] and that the 1980s West Indies team were far superior. He also criticised the Australian team for publicly praising the skills of their opponents, believing that they did so to aggrandise their statistical performances against teams he considered to be weak. In 2000, he was named in the Australian Cricket Board's Team of the Century and criticised modern day batsmen, noting that players in earlier eras had to play on sticky wickets saying [...] "these guys who play out here are a little bit spoilt in my opinion. They play on flat wickets all the time and they grizzle if ... the ball does a little bit off the pitch, and whatever ... But <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> up with that" [...] and going to assert his opinion that the current players would be no match.|$|E

500|$|Arsenal's fifth round {{match was}} away to league rivals Manchester United at Old Trafford on 16 February 2003. After Giggs missed {{the chance to}} score past an open goal, midfielder Edu gave Arsenal the lead through a free kick which took a {{deflection}} off David Beckham's shoulder. Wiltord scored the second goal of the match in the 52nd minute, running onto a pass from Edu and side-footing the ball past goalkeeper Fabien Barthez. Vieira said of the performance: [...] "We knew when we lost here in the league that we had lost the battle in midfield. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> that right, and we did." [...] In the sixth round, Arsenal were drawn at home to Chelsea in {{a repeat of the}} previous season's final. Chelsea defender John Terry put his team ahead with a header from a set piece before Arsenal responded through Jeffers and Henry. Frank Lampard scored a late equaliser for the visiting team meaning the match was replayed at Stamford Bridge. An own goal by Terry and a strike by Wiltord in the space of seven minutes during the replay gave Arsenal an early lead against Chelsea. Despite going down to ten men after Cygan was sent off and Terry scoring from a header, the away team scored a third goal through Lauren to ensure progression into the semi-finals. In the semi-final against Sheffield United on 13 April 2003 at Old Trafford, Ljungberg scored the winning goal to help Arsenal reach their third successive FA Cup final appearance. The match was remembered for Seaman, who on his 1,000th appearance in senior football produced a late save to deny Sheffield United from equalising.|$|E
2500|$|Denisof complimented {{the season}} three Angel episode [...] "Billy", in which Wesley tries to murder Fred after {{becoming}} supernaturally misogynous, [...] "because {{it was the}} first real dark change in Wesley to experiment with". Discussing Wesley's betrayal of his friends to protect Angel's baby, Denisof explains, It isn't that he's purely bad or purely good, we're discovering a deeper and more complicated area of the character where good and bad aren't as clear, where Wesley does something motivated, he thinks, for the good of all [...] i.e. saving Connor and relieving Angel of the responsibility of murdering his son [...] and in doing so creates the situation in which the baby could be kidnapped, Angel loses his son and Wesley has his throat slit for the trouble. So it's grey rather than black or white. Science fiction magazine Starburst said that [...] "somber, subdued, bearded Wesley is worlds away from the foolish, pompous Wesley". Denisof says of the period, [...] "It was a great opportunity to explore some of the character's darker layers. You couldn't have predicted it when he arrived in Sunnydale. This was an important element to introduce and explore, to be consistent with the show and to continue the organic exploration of all the characters." [...] Whilst the character spent less time with his old friends, Denisof was [...] "more or less isolated from the , barring one or two scenes of mild confrontation when they would come to visit me and we'd chew each other out. There's definitely a cold war going on with Wesley versus the world." [...] Wesley's dark attitude is alleviated somewhat when the gang decide to take over Wolfram & Hart. The tension between Wesley and his co-workers did not go away because of the mind-wipe but because [...] "we decided we were better off as a team than as separate entities. And <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> our differences behind us and build our trust again as a group." [...] Discussing the way Wesley's English accent softens over the course of Angel, Denisof says, [...] just sits on him better. As an actor, it just felt that organically the way he was changing, and it also seemed to be accurate when you consider the amount of time he's spent in L.A. that the accent could have softened. And since he isn't surrounded by upper-crust academics as he was as a young Watcher in the Academy in England, it's understandable that he is changing the way he speaks and changing his voice, his delivery, {{as a result of his}} environment.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, {{we had a}} lot o' damage," [...] said Fazackerly, {{laying down}} his pen; [...] "it took us days to repair 'em. Cost us four pounds. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> into Holyhead for shelter." ...|$|E

We had to turn the family out who had squatted here, at two days' notice, as we {{could not afford to}} live at Kinmonday--that's the nearest town, I s'pose. How they managed to live in the log cabin I do not know, as, when it rained--and it has done so twice since we came, furiously--the whole place was deluged, and <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> an {{umbrella}} up in bed.

I left the ship and came home, thinking what a surprise {{it would be for}} my wife, and hoping that maybe she would be glad to see me so soon.

6000|$|... "The {{first week}} in June was another dreadful one.

'It is all a German lie and that you may tie to.'

We came here to live in accordance with the best English traditions, and although <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> up with some hardships, there were compensations--abundant sport, space, and freedom. In a sense, the country was ours, with its wood and water, as far as we cared to ride. Now every homestead that is built restricts what we have regarded, with some justice, as our rights.

"The simple {{elementary}} acts of justice," [...] she said, {{waving her}} hand towards the window, and indicating the foot-passengers and omnibuses then passing down {{the far side}} of Russell Square, [...] "are as far beyond them as they ever were.

It isn't THEM," [...] she continued, taking heart from her sight of the traffic, [...] "it's their leaders. It's those gentlemen sitting in Parliament and drawing four hundred a year of the people's money. If <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> our case to the people, we should soon have justice done to us. I have always believed in the people, and I do so still.

He sent a boat {{alongside}} and pressed seven able seamen. I remarked it was hard on honest traders, but the officer said they was fighting all creation and hadn't time to argue. The next English frigate we escaped with no more than a shot in our quarter. Then we was chased two days and a night by a French privateer, firing between squalls, and the dirty little English ten-gun brig which made him sheer off had the impudence to press another five of our men. That's how we reached to the chops of the Channel. Twelve good men pressed out of thirty-five; an eighteen-pound shot-hole close beside our rudder; our mainsail looking like spectacles where the Frenchman had hit us--and the Channel crawling with short-handed British cruisers. Put that in your pipe and smoke it next time you grumble at the price of tobacco! ...|$|E

One of those mud-turtles I used to play with as a boy up in Columbia County,--shuts up tight soon as he sees you coming. Now Theodore Watling ain't like that, any way of speaking. We can get up some enthusiasm for a man of his sort. He's liberal and big. He's made his pile, and he don't begrudge some of it to the fellows who do the work.

As madamigella says, it is a relief to lay aside the uniform, now and then, for us who fight the spiritual enemies as well as for the other soldiers. There was one time, when I was younger and in the subdiaconate orders, that I put off the priest's dress altogether, and wore citizen's clothes, not an abbate's suit like this. We were in Padua, another young priest and I, my nearest and only friend, and for a whole night we walked about the streets in that dress, meeting the students, as they strolled singing through the moonlight; we went to the theatre and to the caffè,--we smoked cigars, all the time laughing and trembling to think of the tonsure under our hats.
