500|$|Theron Patterson, {{a friend}} of Moore's and former classmate at California Institute of the Arts, was working in Istanbul, Turkey and invited Moore to visit. Moore, who {{had been living in}} Costa Rica, stayed with him for two weeks, then decided to settle in Istanbul and record the third Chroma Key album there. Moore signed to InsideOut Records. [...] "They've been really great {{supporting}} this; they sent me out to Turkey <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> I wanted to record out there, basically supporting the whole process," [...] he said. The first project Moore worked on after he moved to Istanbul was Ghost Book, the soundtrack to the Turkish film Okul. Moore enjoyed the experience and decided to write the third Chroma Key album as an alternate soundtrack to an already-existing film.|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} {{encourage}} the captains of the merchant ships of all countries which carry the lifeblood of the U.K., I {{made it a point}} to attend the briefing conference of all captains and chief engineers before their departure. During the winter of '42–'43, when sinkings were at their worst, I could see <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> of the measures by escort and air cover that were being taken for their protection and safety; I could see that they knew very well and that they knew I knew in spite of my brave words, that anything up to 25 per cent of them would probably not arrive in the U.K. in their own ships, and that probably half of that number would not arrive in the U.K. at all. But there was never a waver in their resolve – Admiral Murray.|$|E

6000|$|... "We'll see to that, captain--we'll see to that. Field-pieces {{are desperate}} dampers to Indian courage, so I thought I'd just let 'em have a six-pounder, {{by way of}} tryin' their natur's. They look'd like men goin' to execution, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>'em</b> of the cannon, and what a history it had gone through." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Waal, <b>them</b> that <b>told</b> me on't, {{said that}} two had fallen before it, and I {{put it up}} to nine at once, {{to make a good}} story better. Nine men had a more desperate sound than two; and when you do begin to brag, a man shouldn't be backward. I thought, howsever, that they was most non-plussed, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>'em</b> of the field-piece." ...|$|R
6000|$|REV. S. [piteously] Frank, my boy: <b>when</b> <b>I</b> wrote {{those letters}} I put myself into that woman's power. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> you about <b>them</b> <b>I</b> put myself, to some extent, I {{am sorry to}} say, in your power. She refused my money with these words, which I shall never forget. [...] "Knowledge is power" [...] she said; [...] "and I never sell power." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'This night? Have you a night, then? They disbelieved me <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> of mine.' She {{leaned back}} and laughed, always slowly. 'Aren't doctors stu-upid? They don't know.' ...|$|E
60|$|I {{had time}} to {{telephone}} to {{a few of my}} women friends, and they just managed to rush round for a few minutes to say good-bye. I couldn't help crying a little <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> about John's uncle dying so far away with none of us near him, and I told them about the legacy, and they cried a little to hear of it all; and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> that John and I might not come back direct from Bermuda, but might take a run over to Europe first, they all cried some more.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{explained}} my {{intentions to}} the men, who both held up their arms in horror. Their fears for my safety {{were a little}} mitigated, however, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> that I did not expect them to come with me.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have become}} acquainted with some facts in this case which may not {{interest}} you as a lawyer, Don Arturo, but which affect me as a woman. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> have <b>told</b> you <b>them,</b> you will tell me--who knows?--that they do not alter the legal aspect of my--my father's claim. You will perhaps laugh at me for my resolution. But I have given you so much trouble, {{that it is only}} fair you should know it is not merely caprice that governs me--that you should know why your visit here is a barren one; why you--the great advocate--have been obliged to waste your valuable time with my poor friend, Donna Maria, for nothing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They sent {{a council}} of fifty chieftains {{to talk with}} me here," [...] replied the Thark. [...] "We are a just people, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> had <b>told</b> <b>them</b> the entire story they were as one man in agreeing that their action toward me would be guided {{by the action of}} Helium toward John Carter. In the meantime, at their request, I was to resume my throne as Jeddak of Thark, that I might {{negotiate}} with neighboring hordes for warriors to compose the land forces of the expedition. I have done that which I agreed. Two hundred and fifty thousand fighting men, gathered from the ice cap at the north to the ice cap at the south, and representing a thousand different communities, from a hundred wild and warlike hordes, fill the great city of Thark to-night. They are ready to sail for the Land of the First Born <b>when</b> <b>I</b> give the word and fight there until I bid them stop. All they ask is the loot they take and transportation to their own territories when the fighting and the looting are over. I am done." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When I {{came into}} {{possession}} {{of this house}} in the Via Agrippa, which is large and beautiful, I set it {{in a place of}} honour in the antechamber and summoned that sculptor, Glaucus, of whom I have spoken to you, and others who follow the art, to come and pass judgment upon the work. They came, they wondered and they were silent, for each of them feared lest in praising it he should exalt some rival. <b>When,</b> however, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> that it was the work of a lady in Judæa, although they did not believe me, since all of them declared that no woman had shaped that marble, knowing that they had nothing to fear from so distant an artist whoever he might be, they began to praise the work with one voice, and all that evening until the wine overcame them, talked of nothing else. Also they continued talking on the morrow, until at length the fame of the thing came to the ears of Nero, who also is an artist of music and other things. The end of it was that one day, without warning, the Emperor visited my house and demanded to see the bust, which I showed to him. For many minutes he examined it through the emerald with which he aids his sight, then asked: ...|$|R
6000|$|Albinia {{finally made}} her escape, and while {{wondering}} whether she should ever visit that house without tingling with irritation with herself {{and with the}} inmates, Lucy exclaimed, 'There, you see I was right. Grandmamma and Aunt Maria were surprised <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> that {{you said you were}} an able-bodied woman.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I was {{mad about}} the mistakes, but don't {{care enough to}} cry. I'm {{laughing}} to think how Gad fooled Eph and I found him out. I thought Mose and Amos would have died over it <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them,</b> it was so funny," [...] explained Tilly, when she got her breath.|$|E
6000|$|Father Dolan and I, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> all {{at dinner}} about it, Father Dolan and I {{had a great}} laugh over it. YOU BETTER MIND YOURSELF FATHER DOLAN, said I, OR YOUNG DEDALUS WILL SEND YOU UP FOR TWICE NINE. We had a famous laugh {{together}} over it. Ha! Ha! Ha! ...|$|E
5000|$|There {{occurred}} {{a demonstration}} which considered {{the character of}} the gathering - twenty-five experienced politicians and Parliament men, who represented all the different points of view, whether right or wrong, before the war - surprised me. Quite a number seemed to jump up from the table and come running to my chair, shouting and patting me on the back. There is no doubt that had I at this juncture faltered at all in the leading of the nation I should have been hurled out of office. I was sure that every Minister was ready to be killed quite soon, and have all his family and possessions destroyed, rather than give in. In this they represented the House of Commons and almost all the people. It fell to me in these coming days and months to express their sentiments on suitable occasions. This I was able to do because they were mine also. There was a white glow, overpowering, sublime, which ran though our Island from end to end. [...] Churchill received a standing applause from the Outer Cabinet and thus ensured that the United Kingdom would fight on. When the War Cabinet reconvened at 7 pm, Churchill's position was secure. He told the War Cabinet of his earlier meeting, telling them that the Outer Cabinet [...] "had expressed the greatest satisfaction <b>when</b> <b>I</b> had <b>told</b> <b>them</b> that there was no chance of our giving up the struggle. I did not remember having ever before heard a gathering of persons occupying high places in political life express themselves so emphatically." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>I</b> had {{the hundred}} {{thousand}} dollars to handle the throwing of the World Series. <b>I</b> also <b>told</b> <b>them</b> that <b>I</b> had {{the names of the}} men who were going to finance it. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> they were waiting below.|$|R

"The {{hotel is}} not luxurious {{and they have}} very crude ideas about cookery, but they tried to suit my fastidious taste <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> I {{was a friend of}} yours," [...] Allott remarked. [...] "However, I don't suppose you are remarkably {{comfortable}} at the mine, and you can change all this when you like." ...|$|E
60|$|If you're {{a recent}} {{acquaintance}} of Bobbie's, you'll probably {{be surprised to}} hear that {{there was a time when}} he was more remarkable for the weakness of his memory than anything else. Dozens of fellows, who have only met Bobbie since the change took place, have been surprised <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> that. Yet it's true. Believe me.|$|E
6000|$|Our {{friends in}} Chicago smiled <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> {{where we had}} been. Lorado said, [...] "A Honeymoon {{in the heart of}} the Rockies is just like you"--but I cared nothing for his gibes so long as Zulime was content, and I had but to over-hear her account of her trip to be reassured. To her it had been a noble {{exploration}} into a marvelous country.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> {{the story}} {{carefully}} and circumstantially. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> had finished Colonel Ray left {{his seat and}} whispered something in Lord Chelsford's ear. The Duke interposed.|$|R
6000|$|... "Glory, glory! Cowards they are, as <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them.</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> {{they never}} could stand the Devon mastiffs, and well they flogged me for saying it; {{but they could}} not stop my mouth. O sir, tell me, did you get the ship that came up after her?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> {{that you}} were making up your mind and I came along just then. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> {{that you were}} saved by me. My shout checked you..." [...] She moved her head gently {{from right to left}} in negation.--"No? Well, have it your own way." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{had one of}} the Ramsbottom {{letters in}} it, I remember, which Gus and I read on Sunday at breakfast, and we nearly killed {{ourselves}} with laughing. The ladies laughed too <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> this; and good-natured Lady Jane said she would forgive her sister, and hoped I would too: which I promised to do as often as her Ladyship chose to repeat the offence.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{he was in}} it, {{and some}} ladies, and they stopped and asked Rectus and I how we got along with our queen, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> all about it, {{you ought to have}} heard them laugh, and the governor, he said, that Poqua-dilla shouldn't suffer after we went away, even if he had to get all his pepper-pods from her. Now, wasn't that good?" ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> this, Uncle Chipperton flashed up in a minute, {{and said}} that that was all stuff and nonsense,--the trip shouldn't cost me a cent. What was the sense, he said, of {{thinking}} of a few dollars when such pleasure was in view? He would see that I had no money-troubles, and if that was all, I could go {{just as well as}} not. Didn't he owe me thousands of dollars? ...|$|E
5000|$|And oh I did not {{understand}} it, for I felt I was richAnd <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> of the love my momma sewed in every stitchAnd <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>'em</b> all the story momma told me while she sewedAnd how my coat of many colors was worth more than all their clothes ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Get out? Of course I can't," [...] moaned {{the unknown}} female bitterly. [...] "They won't let me. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>I</b> would be let out. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> I'd call the police. But it's no good. Nobody knows, nobody comes.

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> frankly {{that these}} jobs were pretty well filled up.|$|R
6000|$|The {{history of}} Joseph: they all found a {{difficulty}} in realising that [...] this had actually occurred. One asked if Egypt existed now, and if [...] {{people lived in}} it. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> that buildings now stood which [...] had been erected {{about the time of}} Joseph, one said that it was [...] impossible, as they must have fallen down ere this. I showed them the [...] form of a pyramid, and they were satisfied. One asked if all books [...] were true.|$|E
6000|$|They {{had kept}} silent {{simply because they}} {{thought that they were}} not called to say anything; and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> that I {{intended}} to run into Singapore and that the best chance for the ship and the men was in the efforts all of us, sick and well, must make to get her along out of this, I received the encouragement of a low assenting murmur and of a louder voice exclaiming: [...] "Surely there is {{a way out of this}} blamed hole." ...|$|E
6000|$|Allonby made a grimace. [...] "For six long years. The {{men who had}} lent {{me money}} laughed at me, and worked the poor ore back along the incline instead of boring. Somebody has been working it--for about five cents on the dollar--ever since, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> what they were letting slip all of them smiled compassionately. I am of course--though once it was different--a broken man, with a brain clouded by whisky, only fit to run a played-out mine. How could I be {{expected}} to find any man a fortune?" ...|$|E
