500|$|In {{an episode}} {{guide to the}} Anderson TV series, science-fiction writer John Peel {{questions}} Mac's ethics in [...] "experimenting on" [...] Joe to further {{the development of the}} BIG RAT. On the subject of Joe as a secret agent he remarks, jokingly, [...] "Presumably there are no child labour laws in the future!" [...] La Rivière's attention is drawn to one of Mac's lines {{at the end of the}} pilot, in a scene that he considers [...] "amusing"; the professor's admonition [...] "Don't come crying to me if you get hurt!" [...] represents his preparedness to [...] "abnegate all parental responsibility" [...] towards his adoptive son. Observing the series' subscription to [...] "wider themes in Cold War culture", Cull likens the BIG RAT's powers to brainwashing, but concludes that it is a fundamentally [...] "benign" [...] technology. The more violent style introduced in Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons is sometimes evident in Joe 90: in [...] "Hi-jacked", Joe kills an enemy with a grenade, while in [...] "Project 90", Professor McClaine is menaced by a drill poised to pulverise his head. On the subject of violence, episode director Desmond Saunders comments: [...] "There was an unpleasant side to it which I never really understood. There was something about it that <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>strange</b> and sinister." ...|$|E

2500|$|Thompson {{started to}} re-engage {{with the world}} of {{professional}} music in 1977. He played on an album by Sandy Denny, and had undertaken a short tour and started recording with a group of musicians who were also Sufis. Thompson asked Joe Boyd to produce these sessions, and two days were spent on the initial recordings. Boyd recalls that the sessions were not a success: [...] "It was really, I felt, very poor. I didn't have much confidence in the musicians that he was working with. The atmosphere <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>strange</b> and it just didn't seem to work." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{thought he}} <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>strange,</b> {{or at least}} that what I could see of him <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>strange,</b> for he was wrapped up to the chin, and his face was almost hidden in a fur cap with broad fur straps at {{the side of his head}} {{fastened}} under his chin; but I was composed again, and not afraid of him. So I told him that I thought I must have been crying because of my godmother's death and because of Mrs. Rachael's not being sorry to part with me.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{hardly knew}} at first," [...] she said, [...] "whether he admired me or not.
