500|$|Several {{small areas}} of {{convection}} developed {{in association with}} a tropical wave on August14 near Central America. Over the next two days, the convection migrated across Central America, and then entered the Gulf of Tehuantepec on August16. The next morning, Tropical Depression Nine-E formed south of an upper-level low that was located in the Gulf of Mexico. Banding features slowly increased in coverage, and on August18, the depression intensified, becoming Tropical Storm Hilary about [...] south of the Pacific coast of Mexico.

[...] "Mika had a great race," [...] he said. [...] "His victory may have looked easy, but it <b>was</b> <b>tough</b> <b>to</b> achieve and in my view {{this was one of}} his best drives ever." [...] Michael Schumacher said that although he was unable to catch Häkkinen, he was happy to finish in second position. Coulthard said that he believed that his car's suffered from balance issues before taking his first pit stop which accounted for his lack of pace.

[...] He remembered the crew gave him a [...] "bad" [...] synthesizer song and he was told to do [...] "some kind of weird walk to it." [...] He said [...] "I animated this bizarre SpongeBob walk and turned it in, and that was that." [...] Eventually, Drymon saw the cycle and referred to it as [...] "The Lost Episode" [...] walk. O'Hare had no idea what Drymon was talking about until he learned it was already used in an episode. O'Hare said [...] "so I just figured that it ended up on the cutting room floor, like a lot of stuff you end up doing in animation. I had no idea that he was referring to the actual name of the show [...]" [...] The live action scenes were directed by Mark Osborne (brother of the episode's storyboard director Kent Osborne), and were hosted by Tom Kenny in character as Patchy the Pirate, the president of the fictional SpongeBob SquarePants fan club.|$|E

He began the 2009 season with the Giants' High-A affiliate, the San Jose Giants of the California League. After five starts, in which he went 3–1 with a 1.48 ERA and 23 strikeouts, he was called up to the Giants AA affiliate, the Connecticut Defenders of the Eastern League.

500|$|Following the {{production}} struggles of The Lord of the Rings, Bakshi decided {{to work on}} something more personal. He pitched American Pop to Columbia Pictures president Dan Melnick. Bakshi wanted to produce a film in which songs would be given a new context in juxtaposition to the visuals. American Pop follows four generations of a Russian Jewish immigrant family of musicians, whose careers parallel the history of American pop and starred actor Ron Thompson in a dual lead role. While the film does not reflect Bakshi's own experiences, its themes were strongly influenced by people he had encountered in Brownsville. The film's crew included character layout and design artist Louise Zingarelli, Vita, Barry E. Jackson, and Marcia Adams. Bakshi again used rotoscoping, {{in an attempt to}} capture the range of emotions and movement required for the film's story. According to Bakshi, [...] "Rotoscoping is terrible for subtleties, so it <b>was</b> <b>tough</b> <b>to</b> get facial performances to match the stage ones." [...] Bakshi was able to acquire the rights to an extensive soundtrack—including songs by Janis Joplin, The Doors, George Gershwin, The Mamas & the Papas, Herbie Hancock, Lou Reed, and Louis Prima—for under $1 million. Released on February 12, 1981, the film was a financial success. The New York Times Vincent Canby wrote, [...] "I'm amazed at the success that Mr. Bakshi has in turning animated characters into figures of real feelings." [...] Jerry Beck called it [...] "one of Bakshi's best films". Due to music clearance issues, it was not released on home video until 1998.|$|E
