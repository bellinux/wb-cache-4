5|$|Congress {{set aside}} about 89 {{percent of the}} park in a highly {{protected}} wilderness area through passage of the Wilderness Act of 1964. No roads, motorized vehicles (except rescue helicopters and other emergency vehicles), or any development beyond trail maintenance are allowed in this area. The adjacent Ansel Adams <b>Wilderness</b> <b>and</b> John Muir Wilderness were also protected under the act and include regions removed from the park immediately before it was unified with the state grant in 1906.|$|E
5|$|Dreamtime {{opens with}} the premise {{that many of those}} accused of {{witchcraft}} in early modern Christendom had been undergoing visionary journeys {{with the aid of a}} hallucinogenic salve which was suppressed by the Christian authorities. Duerr argues that this salve had been a part of the nocturnal visionary traditions associated with the goddess Diana, and he attempts to trace their origins back to the ancient world, before looking at goddesses associated with the <b>wilderness</b> <b>and</b> arguing that in various goddess-centred cultures, the cave represented a symbolic vagina and was used for birth rituals.|$|E

5|$|Popular {{recreational}} {{activities in the}} Big Butte Creek watershed include hunting, camping, hiking, and horseback riding. Many tourists also come to sight-see. The most heavily used trail in the area is the Blue Canyon Trail, leading to the Sky Lakes <b>Wilderness,</b> <b>and</b> ultimately the larger Pacific Crest Trail. The city of Butte Falls has organized the Butte Falls Discovery Loop Tour, a half-day-long drive through the Rogue River– Siskiyou National Forest. The loop starts in Butte Falls, and has several stops for hiking and viewing the landscape, including Mount McLoughlin.|$|E

5|$|As {{the fifth}} book begins, the setting shifts briefly to North America. Following the Ural War, the Japanese had led an Asian {{occupation}} of western North America. The local populations, inspired by Native American beliefs and mythologies, react by leaving the cities for the <b>wilderness</b> <b>and</b> destroying the food factories and cities, eventually driving out the Asian occupation. In America and then globally people begin leaving cities {{in favor of}} the wild. Shamanism and the belief in ghosts reemerge amongst the populace, as does an oral tradition of story-telling. The draining of the cities grows into a settler movement: egalitarian communities that live in nature, characterized by gender equality and sexual liberation. In response to the threat this movement poses to the ruling Senates, political leaders in London hatch a plan to colonize Greenland, thereby channeling both the drive for technological innovation and the drive to settle new land.|$|E
5|$|Backcountry hiking is {{available}} in the Craters of the Moon <b>Wilderness</b> <b>and</b> the much larger Backcountry Area beyond (added in 2000). Only two trails enter the wilderness area and even those stop after a few miles or kilometers. From there most hikers follow the Great Rift and explore its series of seldom-visited volcanic features. All overnight backcountry hikes require registration with a ranger. No drinking water {{is available}} in the backcountry and the dry climate quickly dehydrates hikers. Avoiding summer heat and winter cold are therefore recommended by rangers. Pets, camp fires, and all mechanized vehicles, including bicycles, are not allowed in the wilderness area.|$|E

25|$|The Rayado {{program is}} a select, strenuous twenty-one day backpacking program {{designed}} for experienced Scouts. Rayado crews are accompanied by two rangers and experience a number of challenges geared toward developing personal growth, a sense of stewardship for the environment, and leadership skills. Rayado participants are challenged physically, mentally, and spiritually as they hike Philmont's most challenging trails, visit parts of the backcountry that are never seen by regular trek participants, and take part in activities that are not available to other Scouts. This includes difficult rock climbing and instruction in outdoor leadership, <b>wilderness</b> problem-solving, <b>and</b> advanced outdoor skills which include <b>wilderness</b> backpacking, navigation <b>and</b> travel, expedition behavior and group dynamics, advanced cooking, <b>wilderness</b> stewardship, <b>and</b> <b>wilderness</b> first aid <b>and</b> backcountry emergency procedures. A Rayado Trek encourages personal growth, teamwork, and leadership ability.|$|R
5|$|By 1710 the {{population}} of Manche Ch'ol in Belén had fallen to just four; everyone else had {{died as a result}} of disease, hunger and melancholy. By 1770 the Manche Ch'ol were all but extinct; their original territory had been abandoned and had reverted to <b>wilderness,</b> <b>and</b> the few survivors relocated to the highlands numbered not more than 300 in the whole Urran Valley, where there were almost as many Spanish and ladinos. Many Manche Ch'ol in Verapaz were absorbed into the expanding Q'eqchi' Maya population, which gradually occupied the vacated Manche lands. It is possible that a few Manche Ch'ol survived in the forested interior of Toledo District in Belize, to be later absorbed by incoming Q'eqchi' in the late 19th century. In the very early part of the 19th century, a handful of Maya were still recorded as speaking Ch'ol in Cobán.|$|E
5|$|Many of Omaha's {{founding}} figures {{stayed at}} the Douglas House or the Cozzens House Hotel. Dodge Street was important early in the city's early commercial history; North 24th Street and South 24th Street developed independently as business districts, as well. Early pioneers were buried in Prospect Hill Cemetery and Cedar Hill Cemetery. Cedar Hill closed in the 1860s and its graves were moved to Prospect Hill, where pioneers were later joined by soldiers from Fort Omaha, African Americans and early European immigrants. There are several other historical cemeteries in Omaha, historical Jewish synagogues and historical Christian churches dating from the pioneer era, as well. The city's pioneering history is celebrated at two sculpture parks, Pioneer Courage and Spirit of Nebraska's <b>Wilderness</b> <b>and</b> The Transcontinental Railroad.|$|E
5|$|Permits are {{required}} for all overnight visits to the BWCAW.

From October 1 through April 30, permit reservations are not necessary, but a permit must be filled out at the permit stations located at each entry point. Each permit must specify the trip leader, the specific entry point and the day of entry.

5|$|The 2007 Mark Webber Pure Tasmania Challenge was {{launched}} at the 2007 Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne when Webber {{was joined by}} sports stars and Kylie Minogue, and Hollywood star Anthony Edwards. The trek was another gruelling physical and mental adventure race about Tasmania in aid of charity but albeit with a new format. Teams competed for honours in two unique categories: the Van Diemen Cup– designed exclusively for corporate teams of four people, and the 2theXtreme Cup– a two-person elite team entry. Both categories trekked, kayaked and cycled alongside {{each other as they}} covered approximately 450km through World Heritage <b>wilderness</b> <b>and</b> along the idyllic coast of the Freycinet National Park. It was held from 17–23 November, and for the first time, one of Webber's fellow Formula One drivers, Heikki Kovalainen, joined him in the challenge.|$|E
5|$|The Mad Hermit is a 1910 American silent short drama film {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The story focuses on Harry Willard, who becomes a hermit after {{his wife and daughter}} leave him. He spends {{a quarter of a century}} in isolation, but he stumbles across a runaway carriage and the woman tosses her baby to him. He runs into the <b>wilderness</b> <b>and</b> prepares to kill it, but he stays his hand when he sees the baby's locket. The parents survive the carriage crash and seek out the hermit, and it is revealed that the baby's mother is the daughter of Harry Willard. Created by a staff of twenty, it was the first film to be {{produced by}} the Thanhouser Company. The film was released in August 9, 1910, after the success of the company was ensured, and met with positive reception by critics. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
5|$|The Storm Creek {{fire started}} on June 14 well {{north of the}} park in the Absaroka-Beartooth <b>Wilderness,</b> <b>and</b> for almost two months seemed to pose little threat to Yellowstone. Then, on August 20, the fire moved rapidly to the south also {{threatening}} the town of Cooke City, this time from the north. An effort to bulldoze a wide fire break and set backfires to try to starve the fires of combustibles almost led to disaster when an unexpected change in wind direction brought the fires to within a hundred yards of parts of the town, forcing evacuations on September 6.|$|E
