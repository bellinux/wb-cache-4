5|$|Different factions {{may have}} {{existed in the}} royal court. The k'uhul ahaw and his {{household}} would have formed the central power-base, but other important groups were the priesthood, the warrior aristocracy, and other aristocratic courtiers. Where ruling councils existed, as at Chichen Itza and Copán, these may have formed an additional faction. Rivalry between different factions <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>led</b> to dynamic political institutions as compromises and disagreements were played out. In such a setting, public performance was vital. Such performances included ritual dances, presentation of war captives, offerings of tribute, human sacrifice, and religious ritual.|$|E
5|$|Most {{scholars}} {{hold that}} Jesus lived in Galilee and Judea {{and did not}} preach or study elsewhere. They agree that Jesus debated with Jewish authorities {{on the subject of}} God, performed some healings, taught in parables and gathered followers. Jesus' Jewish critics considered his ministry to be scandalous because he feasted with sinners, fraternized with women, and allowed his followers to pluck grain on the Sabbath. According to Sanders, it is not plausible that disagreements over how to interpret the Law of Moses and the Sabbath <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>led</b> Jewish authorities to want Jesus killed.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause of}} the {{explosion}} was debated in the days immediately following the fire. Public speculation led {{to the arrest of}} Crocker and Warren, the occupants of the warehouse. The Daily-Tribune reported that the explosions could not have occurred without the presence of gunpowder in addition to the saltpeter, and thus they were suspected of possessing gunpowder, which <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>led</b> to a murder charge. However, later inquiry released Crocker and Warren of all charges as no evidence of gunpowder was discovered.|$|E

25|$|In {{favour of}} Waldheim is, {{that he only}} had very minor {{possibilities}} to act against the injustices happening. Actions against these, depending on which level the resistance occurred, were of very different importance. For a young member of the staff, {{who did not have}} any military authority on the army group level, the practical possibilities for resistance were very limited and with a high probability <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> <b>led</b> to any actual results. Resistance <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been limited to a formal protest or on the refusal to serve any longer in the army, which <b>would</b> <b>have</b> seemed to be a courageous act, however <b>would</b> <b>have</b> not <b>led</b> to any practical achievement.|$|R
5|$|The species's range may be relictual in nature: while Oryzomys is {{currently}} found {{along the eastern}} coast of the Gulf of California only {{as far north as}} coastal southern Sonora, the past distribution of the genus may have extended further northward, perhaps even into the southwestern United States, and from there south into Baja California. Subsequent disappearance of Oryzomys from the northern regions <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>led</b> to its observed disjunct distribution, with O.peninsulae isolated on the peninsula. This possibility is supported by the relatively close resemblance between O.peninsulae and O.couesi mexicanus, from coastal western Mexico.|$|E
5|$|The tournament was put {{in further}} {{jeopardy}} in January 1979 when General Motors withdrew as a major sponsor; Eagleson argued GM withdrew {{as a result of}} the dispute with the CAHA. The disputes put the two bodies on the verge of severing all ties, a move that <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>led</b> to Hockey Canada refusing to release any professional or university player to any of Canada's national teams. The tournament was ultimately postponed by a year until September 1980.|$|E
5|$|However, with Moltke crippled, Admiral Scheer {{decided to}} return to base. Though {{scouting}} units of the Grand Fleet made brief contact with the Germans on the morning of 25 April, no action followed, and the High Seas Fleet made it home without incident. At one point in the chase, however, a reversal of course by the Germans meant that the entire Grand Fleet was forced to reorient itself in the opposite direction, placing Battleship Division Nine in the van. The result was that, if an encounter between the two fleets had occurred, American battleships <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>led</b> the British fleet into what could have been the largest naval battle of the war.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to eliminating Jews, the Nazis also planned {{to reduce the}} population of the conquered territories by 30 million people through starvation in an action called the Hunger Plan. Food supplies would be diverted to the German army and German civilians. Cities would be razed and the land allowed to return to forest or resettled by German colonists. Together, the Hunger Plan and Generalplan Ost <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>led</b> to the starvation of 80 million people in the Soviet Union. These partially fulfilled plans resulted in the democidal deaths of an estimated 19.3 million civilians and prisoners of war.|$|E
5|$|Taken together, {{analyses}} {{indicate that}} the impactor was large enough to create a 120-mile peak ring, to melt, shock and eject granite from many miles within the earth, to create colossal water movements, and to eject an immense quantity of vaporized rock and sulfates into the atmosphere, where they would have persisted over years to decades. This global dispersal of dust and sulfates <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>led</b> to a sudden and catastrophic effect on the climate worldwide, large temperature drops, and devastated the food chain. The researchers stated that the impact generated an environmental calamity that extinguished life, but it also induced a vast subsurface hydrothermal system that became an oasis for the recovery of life.|$|E
5|$|The Arima {{study is}} based on 761 {{municipalities}} located in the Legal Amazon of Brazil, and found that between 2003 and 2008, soybean areas expanded by 39,100km² in the basin's agricultural areas, mainly in Mato Grosso. The model showed that a 10% (3,910km²) reduction of soy in old pasture areas <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>led</b> {{to a reduction in}} deforestation of up to 40% (26,039km²) in heavily forested municipalities of the Brazilian Amazon. The analysis showed that the displacement of cattle production due to agricultural expansion drives land use change in municipalities located hundreds of kilometers away, and that the Amazonian ILUC is not only measurable but its impact is significant.|$|E
50|$|Plans {{to build}} the Channel Tunnel were {{scrapped}} in the 1970s on cost grounds. This gave the Night Ferry a short reprieve; a tunnel <b>would</b> <b>have</b> inevitably <b>led</b> {{to the end of}} conveying passenger carriages by train ferry.|$|R

50|$|In some studies, {{deficiency}} {{states have}} been associated with a propensity to thrombosis. Others, however, link it to bleeding tendency; there is no clear explanation for this, as it acts physiologically as an inhibitor, and deficiency <b>would</b> logically <b>have</b> <b>led</b> to a predisposition for thrombosis.|$|R
5|$|The {{emission}} {{of dust and}} particles could have covered the entire surface of the Earth for several years, possibly a decade, creating a harsh environment for living things. The shock production of carbon dioxide caused by the destruction of carbonate rocks <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>led</b> to a sudden greenhouse effect. Over a longer period, sunlight would have been blocked from reaching {{the surface of the}} Earth by the dust particles in the atmosphere, cooling the surface dramatically. Photosynthesis by plants would also have been interrupted, affecting the entire food chain. A model of the event developed by Lomax et al. (2001) suggests that net primary productivity (NPP) rates may have increased to higher than pre-impact levels over the long term because of the high carbon dioxide concentrations.|$|E
5|$|The {{indigenous}} population {{believed that the}} pigeon became extinct due to predation by feral cats and, to a lesser extent, feral dogs. As Choiseul has no indigenous carnivorous mammals, the ground-dwelling pigeon was particularly susceptible to the introduced cats. If the pigeon existed on islands that feral cats had never reached, {{it is believed that}} the clearance of its forest habitat <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>led</b> to its local extinction. As there have been no substantiated reports since 1904 despite multiple searches, the IUCN has declared it extinct. As several ornithologists had visited Choiseul and the nearby islands prior to Meek without noting any sign of the bird's existence, {{it is likely that the}} Choiseul pigeon was already close to extinction in 1904.|$|E
5|$|The initial accretional heating {{together}} with continued decay of radioactive elements were probably {{strong enough to}} melt the ice if some antifreeze like ammonia (in the form of ammonia hydrate) or some salt was present. Further melting {{may have led to}} the separation of ice from rocks and formation of a rocky core surrounded by an icy mantle. A layer of liquid water ('ocean') rich in dissolved ammonia may have formed at the core–mantle boundary. The eutectic temperature of this mixture is 176K. If the temperature dropped below this value the ocean would have frozen by now. Freezing of the water <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>led</b> to expansion of the interior, which may have also contributed to the formation of canyon-like graben. Still, present knowledge of the evolution of Oberon is very limited.|$|E

5|$|There {{was popular}} support in both {{countries}} for the plan, although whilst in the United Kingdom the socialist Labour Party was strongly in favour, the political left in France wanted to directly aid the Republicans. The Labour Party would reject non-intervention in October 1937. The British Trades Union Congress was split. A report called the 'Commission of Inquiry into Alleged Breaches of the Non-Intervention Agreement in Spain' was drawn up in London, sponsored by Comintern, and headed by respectable figures. Both the British and French governments {{were aware of the}} First World War. France was reliant on British support in general. Léon Blum, the French prime minister, believed that support for the Republic <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>led</b> to a fascist takeover in France and ultimately no change in Spain.|$|E
5|$|Although no {{documentary}} {{account of}} Gibraltar {{is available for}} the period following the Madinat al-Fath project, {{there are reasons to}} believe that a small fortified town existed in Gibraltar, and that its existence was the direct consequence of the fall of Tarifa in 1292. After the capture of the city, it was expected that Sancho would lay siege to Algeciras (it did not eventually happen) in order to sever the most direct links of the Marinids with the Iberian peninsula. The threatening presence of a Christian stronghold to the west <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>led</b> to the establishment of a garrison to the east of Algeciras. That way, Gibraltar would have protected the rearguard of Algeciras and provide a fallback position should Algeciras have fallen. At the same time, and with the increased presence of the Christian fleets in the Straits, Gibraltar provided an excellent lookout post.|$|E
5|$|Between 1939 and 1945, the Schutzstaffel (SS), {{assisted}} by collaborationist governments and recruits from occupied countries, {{was responsible for}} the deaths of at least eleven million people, including 5.5 to 6 million Jews (representing two-thirds of the Jewish population of Europe), and between 200,000 and 1,500,000 Romani people. Deaths took place in concentration and extermination camps, ghettos, and through mass executions. Many victims of the Holocaust were gassed to death, while others died of starvation or disease or while working as slave labourers. In addition to eliminating Jews, the Nazis planned to reduce the population of the conquered territories by 30 million people through starvation in an action called the Hunger Plan. Food supplies would be diverted to the German army and German civilians. Cities would be razed and the land allowed to return to forest or resettled by German colonists.

50|$|Wiesenthal {{stated the}} {{committee}} {{found no evidence}} that Waldheim took part in any war crimes but was guilty of lying about his military record.

5|$|During {{the initial}} {{planning}} {{in the late}} 1980s for High Speed 1, British Rail considered building the line to serve a low-level station at King's Cross via south London. An option for this route was via Herne Hill, which would have required quadrupling the tracks on the Chatham Main Line between Shortlands and Herne Hill and on the City Branch to Loughborough Junction; {{it was estimated that}} this <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>led</b> to the loss of 90–180 homes in Lambeth. Although both a different route and London terminus for HS1 were eventually chosen (St Pancras via East London), Eurostar services linking London Waterloo to Brussels and Paris passed through Herne Hill without stopping from 1994 until the completion of HS1 in November 2007. This marked the end of rail services to the continent via Herne Hill, which had been started by the LCDR in 1863 when the line between Victoria and Dover via Herne Hill was completed.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, Whitney and Thayer {{attempted}} to organize {{what would have}} been New York's first joint operating agreement (JOA) with the Hearst-owned New York Journal American and the Scripps-owned New York World-Telegram and Sun. Under the proposed agreement, the Herald Tribune would have continued publication as the morning partner and the Journal-American and World-Telegram would merge as the World Journal, an afternoon paper. All three would publish a Sunday edition called the World Journal Tribune. The newspapers would have maintained their own editorial voices (all three of which tended to be conservative). On paper, the JOA, which would have taken effect April 25, 1966, <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>led</b> to profits of $4 million to $5 million annually, but would have also led to the loss of 1,764 out of 4,598 employees at the papers. The Newspaper Guild, concerned about the possible job losses, said the new newspaper would have to negotiate a new contract with the union; the publishers refused. The day the JOA was supposed to go into effect, the Guild struck the newly merged newspaper (the Times continued to publish).|$|E
5|$|Montgomery's orders raised several issues, {{the first}} with the {{transport}} aircraft of the Troop Carrier Wings assigned to the airborne operations. When they had arrived in North Africa, it had been decided that the 52nd Troop Carrier Wing would operate with 1st Airborne Division and its counterpart, the 51st, with 82nd Airborne Division. A few weeks later this arrangement was switched, with the 52nd now operating with 82nd Airborne Division and the 51st with 1st Airborne Division; this seemed a logical decision, as each Wing had operational experience with the division it had been paired with. However, the decision to turn the Syracuse assault into a glider-based one was problematic; the 51st had practically no glider experience, whilst the 52nd had much more but was already training for a parachute-based mission. To switch both was impractical and <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>led</b> {{to a number of}} problems, which left 1st Airborne Division, and thus 1st Airlanding Brigade, with an inexperienced Troop Carrier Wing.|$|E
