25|$|The French {{ambassador}} to the United States registered {{a complaint with the}} President of the United States that Argonaut, by entering Lynnhaven bay, either before she captured Esperance or shortly thereafter, had violated a treaty between France and the United States. The French also accused the British of having brought Esperance into Lynnhaven for refitting for a cruise. The President passed the complaint to the Secretary of State, who forwarded the complaint to the Governor of Virginia. The Governor inquired into the matter of the British Consul at Virginia. The British Consul replied that the capture had taken place some 10 leagues off shore. The weather had forced Argonaut and her prize to shelter within the Chesapeake for some days, but that they had left as soon as practicable. Furthermore, Argonaut had paroled her French prisoners when she came into Lynnhaven and if had entered American territorial waters solely to parole her French prisoners no one <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> objectionable. The authorities in Virginia took a number of depositions but ultimately nothing further came from the matter.|$|E

The film {{became one of}} the biggest box office hits in India, earning , and grossed over [...] abroad, the biggest Bollywood success of all-time in the overseas market up until then. It was her fourth overseas top-earner in four consecutive years. The film tells the story of two unhappily married couples in New York, and an ensuing extramarital affair. Zinta played the role of Rhea Saran, an ambitious fashion magazine editor. She described the role as an attempt to shed her vivacious public image. The Indian Express concurred that this was successful: [...] "The lady has not just looked glamorous but she has walked with poise, sat with grace, smiled with composure and spoken with calmness. Who <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> the bubbly girl could so skilfully shed her age-old tag and walk away as the don't-mess-with-me lass.

500|$|An oboe triplet figure then {{reveals the}} warm theme in G major of the Adagio non troppo section, a {{contrast}} to the prior cold landscape. The texture expands contrapuntally for the first time, culminates {{to a point where}} the tonality brightens to B major and, after a climax, wanes to G major again. The full strings are soon disturbed by an [...] "evil" [...] motif on woodwinds, playing the shivering element in Tempo giusto; tension between wind and strings intensifies as tonality shifts within instrumental groups in their respective directions. With a further clash, the music is menaced by the snare drum at a tempo (quarter note ♩=116) faster than that of the orchestra, and at its climax comes the instruction to the snare drummer by the composer to improvise [...] "as if at all costs he wants to stop the progress of the orchestra". (This instruction is not included in the 1950 edition of the score, being replaced by a written rhythmic line and instruction [...] "cad. ad lib." [...] after a few bars.) The warm theme eventually triumphs in a sustaining grandeur, as is affirmed by the snare drum actually joining the orchestral fanfare. When all subsides, echoes in woodwinds are heard and a solitary clarinet is left to mourn in a tragic atmosphere, recapturing ideas from the whole movements: [...] "Who <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> so much could have come out of a gently waving viola line in empty space?" ...|$|E
