In the course of his discussion, Kant {{establishes}} two viewpoints from which we can consider ourselves.

60|$|As {{the effort}} of viewing with care under a bright light a distant object is both {{difficult}} and irksome, and as this effort has been habitually accompanied, during numberless generations, by the contraction of the eyebrows, the habit of frowning will thus have been much strengthened; although it was originally practised during infancy from a quite independent cause, namely {{as the first step}} in the protection of the eyes during screaming. There is, indeed, much analogy, as far as the state of the mind is concerned, between intently scrutinizing a distant object, and following out an obscure train of thought, or performing some little and troublesome mechanical work. The belief that the habit of contracting the brows is continued when there is no need whatever to exclude too much light, receives support from the cases formerly alluded to, in which the eyebrows or eyelids are acted on under certain circumstances in a useless manner, from having been similarly used, under analogous circumstances, for a serviceable purpose. For instance, we voluntarily close our eyes when we do not wish to see any object, and we are apt to close them, when we reject a proposition, as if we could not or would not see it; or <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> something horrible. We raise our eyebrows when we wish to see quickly all round us, and we often do the same, when we earnestly desire to remember something; acting as if we endeavoured to see it.|$|E

What comes to mind for me a place in Huntington Park, an inner ring suburb in Southern California, called la Montaña, or the mountain.

The neighborhood residents struggled for about eight years to try to get that mountain cleaned up because it was causing respiratory and other problems. Eventually, their organizing efforts led to a change in the city council and forced a state agency to clean up their neighborhood.

Also the extensive knowledge and practical experience about digital long-term preservation technologies have been acquired. This wide spectrum of activities puts us in the position to discuss the often overlooked aspect of the digital preservation - preservation of software programs. There are many resources dedicated to digital preservation of digital data, documents and multimedia records,but not so many about how to preserve the functionalities and features of computer programs. Exactly these functionalities - dynamic response to inputs - render the computer programs rich compared to documents or linear multimedia. The article opens the questions on the beginning of the way to the permanent digital preservation.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} a computational account about higher-level creativity {{proposed by}} Margaret A. Boden, a female psychologist and philosopher. She uses an interesting computational concept the “conceptual space” – known as “the box” in our everyday language – to measure levels of creativeness and {{to explain how}} higher-level creativity is achieved. In this paper, I mainly seek to look into detail and analyze her answers to the following two questions: “What does Boden mean by the ‘conceptual space?” and “How {{is it possible to}} think outside of the ‘conceptual space?” To that end, I have researched papers that commented on Boden’s computational account, and have come up with hypothetical cases to flesh out my arguments and to appeal to the readers’ intuitions. The conclusion of this paper is that the knowledge of yourself being inside particular boxes and the knowledge of what limits and potential a given conceptual space has are neither sufficient nor necessary for producing the kind of rule-breaking “outside-the-box” ideas, but the idea of a “conceptual space” remains useful in evaluating the quality of ideas after their generation. The philosophy of creativity is such an intriguing topic to me – we all value creativity as a society and have put “outside-the-box” type of thinking on the pedestal since the age of Plato. Yet <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> more <b>about</b> the idea of “outside-the-box” thinking, much ambiguity arises.

40|$|Many {{claim that}} a {{plausible}} moral theory would have to include a principle of beneficence, a principle telling us to produce goods that are both welfarist and agent-neutral. But <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> care-fully <b>about</b> the necessary connection between moral obligations and reasons for action, we see that agents have two reasons for action, and two moral obligations: they must not interfere with any agent’s exercise of his rational capacities and they must {{do what they can}} to make sure that agents have rational capacities to exer-cise. According to this distinctively deontological view of morality, though we are obliged to produce goods, the goods in question are non-welfarist and agent-relative. The value of welfare thus turns out to be, at best, instrumental. Many theorists think that two related claims will occupy centre stage in any plausible moral theory. The first is that we should bring about more rather than less of what’s of intrinsic value. The second is that welfare has intrinsic value. Putting these two claims together, they suppose that any plausible moral theory will tell us that we should produce more rather than less welfare. Richard Arneson, who is typical of the theorists I have in mind, puts the point this way: The concept of intrinsic value is not merely a building block in consequentialist theories, and if this concept (or the best revi-sion of it we can construct) is found wanting, the loss would have wide reverberations. More is at stake than the status of consequentialism. I suspect any plausible nonconsequentialist morality would include as a component a principle of benefi-cence. In a consequentialist theory some beneficence principle is the sole fundamental principle; in a nonconsequentialist theory beneficence would be one principle among others. Whatever its exact contours, a beneficence principle to fill its role must rank some states of the world as better or worse, and direct us to bring about the better ones within the limit...|$|R

She’s on her own side in that movie but is drawn toward Charles by the end of the film and shoots Erik. Then in Apocalypse she comes back to Charles.

If something {{is said to have been}} unlearned, does that mean that it is simply forgotten or does some residual force of learning, some perverse force, also resonate in ways that might help us to rethink traditional approaches to teaching and learning? Might we say that education today is haunted by the spectre of unlearning?This book invites readers to reflect on the possibilities of knowing, reflecting, understanding, teaching and learning in ways that allow us to imagine the other side of education, the side which understands non-knowledge, ignorance, stupidity and wonder as potentially the most important learning experiences we can ever have. In a series of provocative essays by some of the world’s most renowned theorists in philosophy, psychoanalysis, cultural studies, politics and education, The Pedagogics of Unlearning challenges us to <b>think</b> again <b>about</b> what <b>we</b> mean <b>when</b> <b>we</b> talk about learning — about what it really means to learn — and whether the kinds of learning we imagine in our classrooms and daily lives are actually synonymous with the sort of learning <b>we</b> envision <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> and talk <b>about</b> the purpose and passage of education. If you think you know what education and learning are doing, what teaching strategies do, and what learning outcomes are, then this book asks you to think again, to unlearn what you have learned, to learn to unlearn.
