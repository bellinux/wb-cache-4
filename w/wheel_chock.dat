2500|$|The {{speed of}} the cars rolling down from the hump into the {{classification}} bowl must be regulated according to whether they are full or empty, heavy or light freight, varying number of axles, whether there are few or many cars on the classification tracks, and varying weather conditions, including temperature, wind speed and direction. As concerns speed regulation, {{there are two types}} of hump yards—without or with mechanisation by retarders. In the old non-retarder yards braking was usually done in Europe by railroaders who laid skates onto the tracks. The skate or <b>wheel</b> <b>chock</b> was manually (or, in rare cases, mechanically) placed on one or both of the rails so that the treadles or rims of the wheel or wheels caused frictional retardation and resulted in the halting of the railway car. In the United States this braking was done by riders on the cars. In the modern retarder yards this work is done by mechanized [...] "rail brakes" [...] called retarders, which brake the cars by gripping the wheels. They are operated either pneumatically or hydraulically. [...] Pneumatic systems are prevalent in the United States, France, Belgium, Russia and China, while hydraulic systems are used in Germany, Italy and the Netherlands.|$|E
5000|$|The surface slip or {{friction}} of {{the road}} surface, as the <b>wheel</b> <b>chock</b> may slide downhill due to wet grass or ice. Increasing {{the size of the}} <b>wheel</b> <b>chock</b> will not necessary allow the parking on inclines greater than 30% gradient (16.6 degrees).|$|E
5000|$|The size (height) of the <b>wheel</b> <b>chock</b> {{compared}} to the wheel height. Extra large wheel chocks are suitable for e.g. parked air craft where wind forces may come into effect.|$|E
50|$|<b>Wheel</b> <b>chocks</b> {{must be used}} on a level surface; some rubber <b>wheel</b> <b>chocks</b> have steel grates and ice cleat accessories. The {{vehicle is}} placed in park (on {{vehicles}} with automatic gearboxes) and the parking or emergency brake is applied. The <b>wheel</b> <b>chocks</b> are then snugly positioned against {{the center of the}} tires {{in the direction of the}} grade, on both the left and right side of the vehicle. On even surfaces, chocks are applied to the rear-facing as well as the front-facing side of each tire.|$|R
5000|$|To use, <b>wheel</b> <b>chocks</b> must be {{selected}} {{to match the}} size of the tires on the vehicle and used in pairs, as {{the size of the}} tire is designed to be proportional to the vehicle's weight and size. For a maximum slope of approximately 15.6 degrees, use a chock 1/4 height of the wheel as per SAE J348. The maximum slope angle for any given chock is [...] For example, for a chock 1/6 the height of the wheel, the maximum slope angle would be 10 degrees. Some manufacturers recommend <b>wheel</b> <b>chocks</b> that are slightly bigger than 1/4 the height of the wheel.|$|R
50|$|The revised Type 96 {{howitzer}} {{could be}} identified by a relatively short tube with muzzle only slightly forward of rectangular cradle, three demountable spade plates and demountable trail block for each trail end, <b>wheel</b> <b>chocks</b> and leaf springs above the axle.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Wheel</b> <b>chock</b> [...] - [...] Wheel chocks {{are used}} to {{stabilize}} vehicles resting on their wheels. They can support vehicles of a 10 to 15 percent grade. They are commonly constructed of aluminium, hard rubber, wood, or urethane plastic.|$|E
50|$|On August 2, 1989, Piedmont Airlines Flight 1489, a Boeing 737-400, {{en route}} to Charlotte/Douglas International Airport was {{diverted}} to Piedmont Triad International Airport on report of landing gear malfunction. Reports indicated a <b>wheel</b> <b>chock</b> {{was left in the}} wheel well the night before causing the failure to extend. The plane landed with one gear up.|$|E
50|$|The mining {{industry}} uses wheel chocks to protect lubrication trucks and heavy maintenance vehicles from slipping on off-road terrain when placed in Park. The huge haul trucks, which can weigh up to 450 tonnes, require {{a much larger}} <b>wheel</b> <b>chock</b> that itself will weigh almost 40 kilograms. These circumstances will benefit from urethane wheel chocks that are lightweight enough to be maneuvered, yet can withstand the responsibility of holding a truck if a brake should fail. The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) has established standards that wheel chocks are used when a vehicle is parked on a grade, and OSHA has guidelines that require wheel chocks during loading or unloading of a heavy truck.|$|E
5000|$|Canadian {{railways}} {{must put}} in place additional physical defences to prevent runaways. (New recommendation.) The TSB wants Transport Canada to require trains to use <b>wheel</b> <b>chocks</b> for parked trains, or install more modern and better braking technology to hold parked trains in place.|$|R
50|$|During World War II, pilots on US {{aircraft}} carriers adopted the thumbs up gesture {{to alert the}} deck crew that {{they were ready to}} go and that the <b>wheel</b> <b>chocks</b> could be removed. On modern US carriers, certain deck crew hold a thumb up to signal to the pilot and control tower that their station is OK for take-off.|$|R
5000|$|Truck or vehicle {{restraint}} system (dock lock) - a strong metal hook mounted {{to the base}} of the dock which will hook to the frame or bumper of a trailer and prevents it from rolling away during loading operations, can be operated via manual, hydraulic, or electrical systems; this system can replace or work in conjunction with <b>wheel</b> <b>chocks.</b>|$|R
50|$|On 21 January 2008, a {{maintenance}} works train which was carrying out works between Tampines and Simei (westbound) broke down, causing a disruption from 5.28 am to 12.45 pm {{on both the}} eastbound and westbound services from Pasir Ris and Tanah Merah, affecting 57,000 commuters. SMRT was fined S$387,176 (approximately US$280,000) on 10 March 2008 after the LTA's investigations concluded that the disruption was due to SMRT's working party not complying with operating procedures. This was specifically on securing the parked portion of the maintenance train, which comprised a locomotive and a wagon. The fine was the largest ever for a rail related incident in Singapore. According to operating procedures, during maintenance works, the portion comprising a locomotive and a Rail Grinding Vehicle will proceed with its works, while {{the portion of the}} maintenance train is detached and parked at a distance from the working zone. However, investigations from LTA and SMRT showed that SMRT did not apply the locomotive's parking brake. There was also no <b>wheel</b> <b>chock</b> placed to prevent movement along the gradient of the track. If SMRT had followed operating procedures, a roll-back would have been prevented.|$|E

50|$|Walter Russ, {{originator}} of the service, was the ferry's first fatality, {{killed in}} a March 1942 explosion caused when poorly ventilated fumes ignited in the bilge. A year later the ferry had been rebuilt and resumed service with safety improvements. In 1967 two men committed suicide by jumping off the ferry and in 1994 two men were killed trying to push an oversize vehicle onto the ferry. Prior {{to the use of}} <b>wheel</b> <b>chocks,</b> several vehicles had fallen overboard.|$|R
50|$|Reeves {{continued}} inventing {{after the}} war with patents for Improvements in Diving Equipment in 1950 and <b>Wheel</b> holding <b>chocks</b> for Aircraft in 1955.|$|R
50|$|The ferry {{company has}} also {{received}} criticism for their poor safety standards. In early 2003, {{the family of}} Michael Zuber {{filed a lawsuit against}} Cross Sound Ferry. Zuber was inside a semi-truck onboard the Susan Anne on November 20, 2002 when it mysteriously rolled off the stern of the vessel, drowning Zuber. The Zuber family accussed the ferry company of not securing the truck's back <b>wheels</b> with <b>wheel</b> <b>chocks.</b> The two sides eventually reached a $3.2 million settlement in 2008.|$|R
5000|$|Accidents have {{occurred}} during lone pilot hand starting, high throttle settings, brakes not applied or <b>wheel</b> <b>chocks</b> not being used, all resulting in aircraft moving off without the pilot at the controls. [...] "Turning the engine" [...] with {{the ignition and}} switches accidentally left [...] "on" [...] can also cause injury, as the engine can start unexpectedly when a spark plug fires. If the switch is not in start position, the spark will occur before the piston hits top dead center, which can force the propeller to violently kick back.|$|R
50|$|<b>Wheel</b> <b>chocks</b> (or chocks) are wedges of sturdy {{material}} placed closely {{against a}} vehicle's wheels to prevent accidental movement. Chocks are placed for safety {{in addition to}} setting the brakes. The bottom surface is sometimes coated in rubber to enhance grip with the ground. For ease of removal, a rope may be tied to the chock or a set of two chocks. One edge of the wedge has a concave profile to contour to the wheel and increase the force necessary to overrun the chock. Most commonly, chocks are seen on aircraft and train cars.|$|R
50|$|Lug nuts may {{be removed}} using a lug, socket or impact wrench. If the wheel {{is to be}} removed then an {{automotive}} jack to raise the vehicle and some <b>wheel</b> <b>chocks</b> would be used as well. Wheels that have hubcaps or hub covers need these removed beforehand, typically with a screwdriver, flatbar, or prybar. Lug nuts {{can be difficult to}} remove, as they may become frozen to the wheel stud. In such cases a breaker bar or repeated blows from an impact wrench can be used to free them. Alternating between tightening and loosening can free especially stubborn lug nuts.|$|R
50|$|One {{advantage}} of a transmission brake is that it locks the entire drivetrain, including all four wheels of a four wheel drive vehicle. However any differential action, either within an axle or front-to-back on an all wheel drive (permanent 4×4) vehicle can still allow movement. For this reason a transmission brake is convenient as a parking brake, but should not be relied upon if a mechanic is to be working beneath the vehicle and <b>wheel</b> <b>chocks</b> should be used instead. A second advantage is that they remove {{the need to provide}} cable connections to the wheel brakes, on off-road vehicles where such may be prone to damage.|$|R
5000|$|Chkalovsk began {{receiving}} Tupolev Tu-22 (Blinder) aircraft around 1963 and by 1967 had 30 aircraft. [...] On December 24, 1964 a Tu-22R jumped its <b>wheel</b> <b>chocks</b> {{during a}} ground run and hit three parked aircraft; all were written off. [...] In August 1966 a Tu-22 made a runway excursion while landing, destroying itself and a parked aircraft. [...] The Tu-22 aircraft {{were transferred to}} Zyabrovka in 1992 as the unit re-equipped with Sukhoi Su-24MR. [...] High-resolution Google Earth imagery shows the base is still active, with Sukhoi Su-27 aircraft on the ramp, a transport aircraft, and some helicopters. Some Tu-22M (Backfire) appear to be stored.|$|R
2500|$|In the mid-1930s, the Chicago Great Western Railway {{and then}} the New Haven Railroad began [...] "piggyback" [...] service (transporting highway freight {{trailers}} on flatcars) limited to their own railroads. [...] The Chicago Great Western Railway filed a US federal patent in 1938 on their method of securing each trailer to a flatcar using chains and turnbuckles. [...] Other components included <b>wheel</b> <b>chocks</b> and ramps for loading and unloading the trailers from the flatcars. [...] By 1953, the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy, the Chicago and Eastern Illinois, and the Southern Pacific railroads had joined the innovation. Most of the railcars used were surplus flatcars equipped with new decks. By 1955, an additional 25 railroads had begun some form of piggyback trailer service.|$|R
5000|$|The vans were {{constructed}} of wood, usually vertically matchboard panelled, {{on a wooden}} chassis. Traditionally they were painted dark green outside, white inside for lightness. The roof was curved, of canvas over a wooden frame. This would be tarred or treated as oilcloth for weatherproofing. Shepherd's wagons were often of corrugated iron, although this {{does not seem to}} have been used for wagons that were regularly towed on roads. Some small windows were provided, for light and ventilation and often too high for a view out. They had a four-wheel chassis, the front axle having simple single-pivot platform steering. Steering followed the drawbar from the engine, rather than being steered. Distinctively from earlier horse-drawn wagons, no driver's position was needed at their front. There were no brakes fitted, although <b>wheel</b> <b>chocks</b> were always carried.|$|R

5000|$|In August 2014, the TSB {{released}} {{their report}} on their {{investigation into the}} July 2013 Lac-Megantic derailment. In a news conference, TSB chair Wendy Tadros described how eighteen factors {{played a role in}} the disaster including a [...] "weak safety culture" [...] at the now-defunct Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railways with [...] "a lack of standards, poor training and easily punctured tanks." [...] The TSB also blamed the Transport Canada, the regulator, for not doing thorough safety audits often enough on railways [...] "to know how those companies were really managing, or not managing, risk." [...] The TSB report called for [...] "physical restraints, such as <b>wheel</b> <b>chocks,</b> for parked trains." [...] Prior to the accident TSB had called for [...] "new and more robust wagons for flammable liquids" [...] but as of August 2014, little progress had been made in implementing this.|$|R
50|$|Automobiles {{usually have}} parking brakes {{on the rear}} wheels. If the rear axle is jacked off the ground with only the parking brake set, the vehicle may roll on the front <b>wheels</b> and fall. <b>Chocking</b> the front <b>wheels</b> {{prevents}} this mishap.|$|R
50|$|As the {{automobile}} was introduced and became popular, cars {{also became a}} target for thieves and for a new concept that became known as joyriding. A variety of after-market security devices were introduced. An early invention were locking <b>wheel</b> clamps or <b>chocks</b> that owners could shackle {{onto one of the}} car's road wheels as a hobble, making it impossible to roll the vehicle unless the entire wheel was removed. Between 1914 and 1925 there were at least 25 patents related to wheel locks that attached on the tire and spoke wheel. These devices were available in many sizes from a number of manufacturers (including several patented by Miller-Chapman), and became popular during the early 1920s.|$|R
