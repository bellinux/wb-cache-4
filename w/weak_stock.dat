40|$|Biological {{diversity}} {{is known to}} play an important role in generating and maintaining ecosystem productivity and other functions, and has consequently become a central focus of many efforts to preserve ecosystem services. Theoretical parallels suggest the diversity of fishing fleets may have a similarly important role in determining the productivity and ecological impacts of fisheries, but this possibility has rarely been explored. Here I present theoretical analyses showing that the diversity of métiers - combinations of technology, target species, and fishing grounds - and technical efficiencies in a fishing fleet have important impacts on the productivity, profitability, and ecological impacts of fisheries, particularly mixed-stock or multispecies fisheries. Diversification of métiers can increase yields and reduce threats to <b>weak</b> <b>stocks</b> in both managed and unmanaged multispecies fisheries. Diversification of technical efficiencies creates opportunities for larger profits in managed fisheries, but often decreases yields and worsens impacts on <b>weak</b> <b>stocks</b> in unmanaged fisheries. These results suggest that the potential impact of management may be highest in fisheries with diverse fleets.

Listed private equity funds share characteristics of closed-end mutual funds and traditional unlisted private equity funds and can therefore offer insights into both. Our results have particular relevance to the pricing of unlisted private equity funds where no market prices are observable. We find that funds start at an initial premium of- 2. 5 % and adapt to the long-term average of- 21 % after two years. Fund returns display a new and puzzling U-shaped seasonality and an exceptionally <b>weak</b> <b>stock</b> performance in buyout funds after their initial public offering. Premia predict future returns and are explained by liquidity but not by investor sentiment or the fund’s investment degree.

The present paper contributes to this literature and investigates whether financial market regulation follows a regulative cycle: does regulation, and consequently investor protection, increase {{as a result of}} a stock market downturn (as argued by, e. g., Zingales (2009)) or – contrary to the regulative cycle hypothesis – {{as a result of a}}n upswing (as claimed by Povel (2007), or Hertzberg (2003)).

40|$|Recent {{declines in}} U. S. stock and housing markets {{have led to}} {{widespread}} speculation that workers will delay retirement due to shrinking retirement accounts and home equity. Yet {{the effect of the}} weak labor market is often overlooked. If older job seekers have difficulty finding work, they may retire earlier than expected. The net effect of the current economic crisis on retirement is thus far from clear. The crisis may also have long-term implications for well-being, if workers who experience asset losses do not delay retirement sufficiently to fully offset the losses or if workers who experience job loss claim Social Security benefits earlier. In this paper, we use 30 years of data from the March Current Population Survey to estimate models relating retirement decisions to fluctuations in equity, housing, and labor markets. We also use the 2000 Census and 2001 - 2007 American Community Survey to explore the long-term effects of market conditions on retiree income.

This paper attempts to investigate the co-movements, including its transmission channels, of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Islamic equity index with other Islamic equity indices (Asia Pacific, US, Eurozone, and ASEAN) as well as with Global Sukuk index (Islamic bond). As to the methodology, we employ multi-time scale wavelet analysis as one of the latest techniques in finance to unveil the time varying and multi-horizon nature of these comovements to capture both time and frequency domain simultaneously. Our finding shows that the most recent US-born subprime crisis has generated both long-term and short-term shocks to volatility of all Islamic equity indices. The GCC Islamic equity index is the most susceptible with the shocks mostly transmitted via fundamental linkages. Notably, the nature of co-movements amongst Islamic equity indices are more or less similar as those amongst conventional counterparts. We also find no evidence of flight-to-quality for Islamic investors to flee from compliant equity in GCC to compliant bond during market turbulance, given the leading role of Islamic equity index over Sukuk index in the short run and long run. Finally, we find the nature of <b>weak</b> <b>stock</b> market integration between GCC equity market and others.

40|$|We {{present a}} New-Keynesian DSGE model where stock price áuctuations have real wealth e§ects on {{aggregate}} consumption. Financial markets feature a constant turnover between long-time traders (holding assets) and newcomers (entering {{the market with}} no wealth at all). We show that in this economy the wedge between the current and the expected level of aggregate consumption is driven {{not only by the}} ex ante real interest rate - as in the standard representative agent economy - but also by the market value of accumulated stock wealth. This demand-side linkage between the stock market and the macroeconomy introduces a scope for a response of monetary policy to stock prices. We assess under what conditions Taylor-type interest rate rules with the stock price index as an additional argument can shield the economy against non-fundamental áuctuations that are entirely driven by market sentiment. The analysis shows that the combination of <b>weak</b> <b>stock</b> market wealth e§ects on consumption and of an aggressive response of monetary policy to stock prices induces aggregate instability into the economy, in the form of multiple Rational Expectations Equilibria (REE) and instability under learning dynamics of the fundamental REE. For a given policy rule, endogenous áuctuations arise when dividends are, on average, small and agents have a long expected planning horizon (i. e. low turnover between long-time traders and newcomers). Under both conditions, the distortionary e§ects of stock prices on the intertemporal proÖle of optimal consumption are in fact quantitatively small. Our results hold both for the case of instrumental and of optimized (targeting) policy rules.
