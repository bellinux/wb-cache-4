500|$|Kathryn Bigelow's thriller Zero Dark Thirty marked Chastain's final film {{release of}} 2012. The film tells a partly fictionalized {{account of the}} decade-long manhunt for Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden after the September 11 attacks. Chastain was cast as Maya, an emotionally {{hardened}} CIA intelligence analyst who helped kill bin Laden. The difficult subject matter made it unpleasant for Chastain to film. She suffered from depression while working and once walked off the set in tears because {{she was unable to}} continue. Chastain was unable to meet the undercover agent on whom Maya was based and she relied on the screenwriter Mark Boal's research. Zero Dark Thirty received critical acclaim but was controversial for scenes of torture that were shown providing useful intelligence in the search for bin Laden. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone thought that Chastain played Maya [...] "like a gathering storm in an indelible, implosive performance that cuts so deep <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>feel</b> her nerve endings". Roger Ebert made note of Chastain's versatility, and favorably compared her ability and range to that of actress Meryl Streep. For her performance, Chastain won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Drama and earned Academy, BAFTA and SAG nominations for Best Actress.|$|E
2500|$|Some Western {{observers}} {{who attended the}} trials {{said that they were}} fair and that the guilt of the accused had been established. They based this assessment on the confessions of the accused, which were freely given in open court, without any apparent evidence that they had been extracted by torture or drugging. The British lawyer and Member of Parliament D. N. Pritt, for example, wrote: [...] "Once again the more faint-hearted socialists are beset with doubts and anxieties", but [...] "once again <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>feel</b> confident that when the smoke has rolled away from the battlefield of controversy it will be realized that the charge was true, the confessions correct and the prosecution fairly conducted".|$|E
2500|$|... "Dark layers", and a nuanced {{personality}} of [...] "many different levels and shades" [...] attracted Akingbola to the role. Malick has a violent streak, and is introduced after hitting his former boss, though he becomes calmer with time. A February 2011 episode saw his composure {{threatened by a}} racist patient. Akingbola appreciated the storyline for highlighting the continuation of racism and prejudice: [...] "In this country, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>feel</b> like there's no racism and it's like a lovely Benetton advert but it's still there – that's the truth." [...] He characterised Malick as [...] "not all bad", capable of becoming [...] "a nice guy", and expanded: [...] "I think the thing with Malick is that he's young, confident and he speaks from the heart. He wears his heart on his sleeve, and I don't think there's many people like that on the ward! He doesn't care if what he says offends people, because that's what he believes. But he becomes a bit more sensitive." [...] Akingbola anticipated many [...] "twists and turns" [...] in Malick's storylines. He described him as having many secrets, and being a closed off person who [...] "keeps his cards very close to his chest." [...] Using the simile of an onion, he asserted that Malick's layers would be peeled back slowly, to reveal his [...] "wonderful heart".|$|E

5000|$|Roseanna's Grave (also {{known as}} For Roseanna) is a 1997 American romantic dramedy film {{directed}} by Paul Weiland. In his review, Roger Ebert concludes that Roseanna's Grave [...] "isn't of much consequence, perhaps, and the gears {{of the plot}} are occasionally visible as they turn. But it's a small, sweet film that never tries for more than it's sure of, and the actors find it such a relief to be playing such goodhearted characters that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> almost <b>feel</b> it." ...|$|R

5000|$|Stromberg later {{claimed in}} an {{interview}} that he employed an [...] "age-old" [...] emotional storytelling for the film and called it [...] "the biggest thrill" [...] against all technology advances. [...] "And the way we play with that is we have somebody who's perhaps in love but betrayed and doesn't believe that true love exists. So the moral to it is <b>we</b> <b>can</b> all <b>feel</b> dark ourselves but not to lose hope because there is light in places where we might not be expecting", he explained.|$|R

60|$|Now {{this was}} all very well for the Individualist Liberal of the Early Victorian period, but Individualist Liberalism was a mere {{destructive}} phase {{in the process of}} renewing the old Catholic order, a clearing up of the site.
