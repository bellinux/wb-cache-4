500|$|Rumours had {{circulated}} that Air Marshal W.A. Curtis, a World War I ace {{who headed}} Avro, had ignored Diefenbaker and spirited {{one of the}} Arrows away to be saved for posterity. [...] These rumours were given life in a 1968 interview, when Curtis was asked directly if the rumour was true. He replied, [...] "I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> that." [...] He proceeded to question the wisdom of printing {{the story of a}} missing Arrow, and wondered whether it would be safe to reveal the existence of a surviving airframe only nine years later. [...] "If it is in existence it may have to wait another 10 years. [...] Politically it may cause a lot of trouble." [...] The legend endures that one of the prototypes remains intact somewhere.|$|E
500|$|Moon {{displayed}} what {{he described}} as a humble and self-deprecating manner during the World Series of Poker, repeatedly acknowledging his lack of poker experience throughout the tournament, and often attributing his success to luck and a high number of strong cards, rather than talent. Moon adopted a phrase, [...] "If I win, I win. If I lose, I lose," [...] which reflected his casual approach to the game. Moon also said one of his philosophies was, [...] "Make the other guy pay to see the cards", a strategy attributed to many re-raises Moon made during the 2009 World Series of Poker despite weak hands. Moon had almost no experience in heads-up poker, which some commentators said factored into his loss against Cada in the final hours of the 2009 World Series. Many fans and commentators praised his working stiff style, with some dubbing him [...] "Darvin Gump", a reference to the underdog protagonist of the 1994 drama film, Forrest Gump. Moon has also been nicknamed the [...] "Luddite Logger" [...] because of his distaste for anything technological, including credit cards and online poker. Moon refused to sign a sponsorship deal with an Internet poker company during the 2009 tournament because {{he said he did not}} <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> to anybody. Moon wore a New Orleans Saints hat throughout the tournament because, [...] "I like cheering for the underdog." [...] Moon was invited to guest at the Saints games for their entire playoff run in 2010, and watched them win Super Bowl XLIV against the Indianapolis Colts in Miami.|$|E

60|$|Patty {{had just}} time to seat {{herself at the}} table, spread out her paper imposingly, and assume a businesslike air when Mr. Reefer came in. He was a tall, {{handsome}} old man with white hair, jet-black eyes, and a mouth that made Patty hope she wouldn't stumble on any questions he wouldn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer.</b> Patty knew she would waste her breath if she did.

60|$|But I did {{not want}} him to go on: I did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer.</b> I could feel a new spirit in him, {{something}} strange and pure and slightly frightening. He wanted something which was beyond me. And my soul was somewhere in tears, crying helplessly like an infant in the night. I could not respond: I could not answer. He seemed to look at me, me, an Englishman, an educated man, for corroboration. But I could not corroborate him. I knew the purity and new struggling towards birth of a true star-like spirit. But I could not confirm him in his utterance: my soul could not respond. I did not believe in the perfectibility of man. I did not believe in infinite harmony among men. And this was his star, this belief.|$|E
6000|$|Rilla was the [...] "baby" [...] of the Blythe {{family and}} was in a chronic state of secret indignation because nobody {{believed}} she was grown up. She was so nearly fifteen that she called herself that, and she was quite as tall as Di and Nan; also, she was nearly as pretty as Susan believed her to be. She had great, dreamy, hazel eyes, a milky skin dappled with little golden freckles, and delicately arched eyebrows, giving her a demure, questioning look which made people, especially lads in their teens, <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> it. Her hair was ripely, ruddily brown and a little dent in her upper lip looked as if some good fairy had pressed it in with her finger at Rilla's christening. Rilla, whose best friends could not deny her share of vanity, thought her face would do very well, but worried over her figure, and wished her mother could be prevailed upon to let her wear longer dresses. She, who had been so plump and roly-poly in the old Rainbow Valley days, was incredibly slim now, in the arms-and-legs period. Jem and Shirley harrowed her soul by calling her [...] "Spider." [...] Yet she somehow escaped awkwardness. There was something in her movements that made you think she never walked but always danced. She had been much petted and was a wee bit spoiled, but still the general opinion was that Rilla Blythe was a very sweet girl, even if she were not so clever as Nan and Di.|$|E
