The only thing really frustrating for me, to be honest with you, is that sometimes people would write this idea that we were making it up as we went along and I wanted to say, 'Really?' But I think now people are writing and saying, 'Oh yeah!' I'm excited for people to see it on DVD, because now that they know how it ended, [...] go back and see all of the little things, like people who have no reflections in mirrors. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>back,</b> you will see everything was set up." [...] When asked if the House [...] "pulled" [...] the Harmons to it, Murphy responded, [...] "I don't know if they were targeted. I don't think the Internet site had any supernatural pull to it...although that would have been hilarious. I thought it was two things: it was house porn because I think that house really is extraordinary. And also I think there's always that allure in American lives of the fresh start, moving West, starting fresh." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2009, Banks {{appeared}} in the horror film The Uninvited, a remake of the Korean film A Tale of Two Sisters. The film was about an intrusive stepmother who makes life miserable for the teen daughters of her new husband. Banks based her character, Rachel, on Rebecca De Mornay's character in The Hand That Rocks the Cradle. [...] "It {{was very important to}} me that every line reading I gave could be interpreted two ways," [...] says Banks of her role, [...] "So that <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> through the movie you can see that".|$|E

In addition to Ruddock witnessing Ueshiba first hand {{on a couple of}} hundred occasions, he took extra private lessons, firstly from Kobayashi and then Ichihashi. In his memoir Ruddock recalled Ueshiba intervening when Ichihashi became overly zealous in his throws but also fondly remembered many aspects of the latters instruction and in particular advice Ichihashi provided {{as he was about to}} return to Ireland: [...] " [...] Remember, all these things like bowing and sitting in seiza are Japanese â€“ not Aikido. You know better than we do how to teach foreigners. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> home, respect the ways of your country, remember to teach Aikido your way." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Do you {{remember}} your holiday-time <b>when</b> <b>you</b> were a boy, and <b>when</b> <b>you</b> had to <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to school?" [...] he asked with a smile. [...] "My mind is {{in much the same}} state at leaving Scotland, and going back to my work in London. I hardly know which I admire most--your beautiful country or the people who inhabit it. I have had some pleasant talk with your poorer neighbors; the one improvement I could wish for among them is a keener sense of their religious duties." ...|$|R
60|$|Every boy {{who came}} to town from somewhere else, or who {{moved into a new}} neighborhood, had to fight the old residents. There was no reason for this, except that he was a stranger, and there {{appeared}} to be no other means of making his acquaintance. If he was generally whipped he became subject to the local tribe, as the Delawares were to the Iroquois in the last century; if he whipped the other boys, then they adopted him into their tribe, and he became a leader among them. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> moved away from a neighborhood you did not lose all your rights in it; you did not have to fight <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> to see the boys, or anything; but if one of them met you in your new precincts you might have to try conclusions with him; and perhaps, if he was a boy {{who had been in the}} habit of whipping you, you were quite ready to do so. When my boy's family left the Smith house, one of the boys from that neighborhood came up to see him at the Falconer house, and tried to carry things with a high hand, as he always had done. Then my boy fought him, quite as if he were not a Delaware and the other boy not an Iroquois, with sovereign rights over him. My boy was beaten, but the difference was that, if he had not been on new ground, he would have been beaten without daring to fight. His mother witnessed the combat, and came out and shamed him for his behavior, and had in the other boy, and made them friends over some sugar-cakes. But after that the boys of the Smith neighborhood understood that my boy would not be whipped without fighting. The home instruction was all against fighting; my boy was taught that it was not only wicked but foolish; that if it was wrong to strike, it was just as wrong to strike back; that two wrongs never made a right, and so on. But all this was not of the least effect with a hot temper amid the trials and perplexities of life in the Boy's Town.|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} ten months, we have {{designed}} and developed a game for the Microsoft Imagine Cup. This game, built on the Cannibal Engine, was to revolve around the Millennium Development Goals. The obvious goal was to win the Imagine Cup, {{or at least to}} get as far as we could possibly can. Our team consisted of three programmers with little to no game design experience, and {{in the last couple of}} months a 3 D artist helped us with creating the models of the game. In the end, we did not win, nor even made it to the finals, but we were still an experience richer. The design of the game did not go as quickly and as smoothly as expected, but in the end we came up with a design everyone was happy with. It would be a game that did not incorporate the Imagine Cup theme as explicitly as most other entries of the year before, but still would convey the message of the Millennium Development Goals. Set on a distant planet, we also gave ourselves some artistic freedom with the character design, which was necessary because we did not have an artist yet. The main gameplay element of the game would be the ability to travel back in time, whenever for however long you wanted. In the end the mechanic became limited in its use by an energy meter that depletes <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> in time, and by a five-minute limit of the time <b>you</b> can <b>go</b> <b>back</b> in time. Implementation-wise this mechanic proved to be quite a challenge, especially in combination with an adventure-puzzle-platform game with enemies and other moving and changeable objects. However, with three programmers working almost full-time on it, any problems that arose were dealt with. Having three programmers also meant a sound and solid structure, except when the deadline nears, which is when anything goes, as long as it works. This did not have to happen very often, however. Near the end of the development process, we got the Cannibal Composer from Cannibal Game Studios, to go with their Engine. Using this Composer the world was created, story elements and puzzles were added to the world, and all just in time for the deadline of round 2. Or rather a trifle too late, since the end result could have been that much better, even with just a few hours more. All in all this has been a hard, but challenging and rewarding Bachelor Project, and none of us have regretted our choice of doing this.
