500|$|The main cast of {{the season}} {{consisted}} of Dan Castellaneta (Homer Simpson, Grampa Simpson, Krusty the Clown, among others), Julie Kavner (Marge Simpson), Nancy Cartwright (Bart Simpson, Ralph Wiggum, Nelson Muntz), Yeardley Smith (Lisa Simpson), Hank Azaria (Moe Szyslak, Apu Nahasapeemapetilon, Chief Wiggum, among others) and Harry Shearer (Ned Flanders, Mr. Burns, Principal Skinner, among others). Up until the production of season ten in 1998, these six main voice actors were paid $30,000 per episode. In 1998, a salary dispute {{between them and the}} Fox Broadcasting Company (which airs The Simpsons) arose, with the actors threatening to go on a strike. Fox went as far as preparing for casting of new voices, but an agreement was soon made and the actors' salaries were raised to $125,000 per episode. Groening expressed his sympathy for the cast members in an issue of Mother Jones a while after the salary dispute had been settled. He told the magazine: [...] "They are incredibly talented, and they deserve a chance to be as rich and miserable as anyone else in Hollywood. It looked for a while there like <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> a show, because everyone was holding firm on all sides. That's still my attitude: Hold out for as much money as you can get, but do make the deal." ...|$|E
500|$|IGN {{reviewer}} Matt Fowler {{gave the}} episode an [...] "Incredible" [...] rating of 9.6/10, saying that: [...] "I'm sure we all loved Dexter's final moments with Arthur, {{down in the}} toy train bomb shelter, but now {{looking back at the}} scene, knowing the final moments of the episode, it's filled with so many more eerie easter eggs. Something was definitely up when Arthur said, [...] "It's already over." [...] We all thought so because we've heard him say those words before. We also saw Dexter take a beat after the line, confused about its meaning. We could have chalked it {{up to the fact that}} Arthur was accepting his own death, but Dexter's furrowed brow let us know that something more sinister was in play here. Of course, the real bitch here is that Dexter, having dispatched of Trinity officially, now can't go back and do it with the spirit of vengeance. The scene stands quite beautifully on its own, but Dexter would certainly have not given Arthur an empathetic send off if he knew what that monster had done. We can all point fingers at certain missteps that Dexter took throughout the entire season - mistakes that led to Rita's demise - but when you take it in as a whole it's a rather satisfying and cleverly constructed story that actually made us all buy and believe, by the end, that Dexter truly wanted to be rid of his murderous spirit. His stubborn need to kill Trinity himself wound up circumventing the entire justice system, which would have wound up catching Arthur based solely on Deb's tenacity and expert detective work." [...] Also, IGN listed Arthur Mitchell as 2nd on a list of Dexter's Top 10 Kills saying that [...] "This was the murder that America was clamoring for. And it was effin' great." [...] In his review of the entire fourth season, Fowler, giving the season an [...] "Incredible" [...] rating of 9.5, said of the finale that [...] "It all just came off as a ton of creepy, guilty fun. I would bet that when we all saw the final scene of the season finale that we, simply due to the time we've spent the characters over four years, felt a ton of emotions that <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> even known were there." ...|$|E

30|$|Spatial-temporal data, used in {{the absence}} of quality control measures, will likely yield {{questionable}} or poor results. Because of these challenges, we must investigate ways to aggregate and derive quality control measures from provided data including sensor observations and timestamps not only corresponding to the original observation, but also to the times at which the data is made available, processed and redistributed. The best approach to improving the quality of data is to start at the source – the sensors. But, we must recognize and work with what is within our control.

40|$|Maze solving- a {{seemingly}} minor {{challenge for the}} analytical minds of humans – has generated enough curiosity and challenges for A.

The question that automatically comes into mind is that why do we require our robots to solve maze? Is it really required? The answer is “Yes”. Robotics is a field of wide reaching applications. From bomb sniffing robots to devices for finding humans in wreckage to home automation, we require our robots to have a certain degree of analytical mind and if our robots can solve mazes, as complex as it can get, then we think that their analyticity will be improved significantly. The existing algorithms have the problem that all of them concentrated on finding the shortest possible way present in the maze and this made these algorithms a bit slow. Here, consider the situation where the maze has only one solution. In this case, most of the existing algorithms failed to keep up the pace as they tried to fin...|$|R
