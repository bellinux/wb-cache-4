At the same time, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) deals with the impending purchase of NBC. Finally, Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) does damage control after his former nanny publishes a tell-all book.|$|E

Scully performs the autopsy on the crewman's body, finding a Russian language tattoo on his arm and a flukeworm inside his liver.|$|E
5|$|You {{are going}} to have a four-lane highway through Wyoming. You {{are going to}} build two four-lane {{highways}} through New Mexico and Arizona. Colorado needs to be able to compete with our neighboring states. We do not want to take anything away from them. We do not <b>want</b> <b>them</b> to get way out ahead of us, either, because these interstate highways are going to be very attractive highways for the East and West to travel on.|$|E

I <b>wanted</b> <b>them</b> to have a sophisticated intellect. I <b>wanted</b> <b>them</b> to be avid readers, {{the kind of person who}} always has trouble putting a book down. And I raised them to be independent thinkers, to lead reflective and meaningful lives”.|$|R

5|$|According to Naman Ramachandran, {{the author}} of , most of Rajinikanth's philanthropic {{activities}} went unpublicised {{because he did not}} <b>want</b> <b>them</b> to be so. In the 1980s, when superstitious beliefs prevented a majority of people from donating eyes, Rajinikanth took the case of campaigning in support of corneal transplantation via television and public speeches. In 2011, Rajinikanth announced his support for the anti-corruption movement led by Gandhian Anna Hazare and offered his marriage hall, the Raghavendra Kalyana Mandapam, in Chennai free of cost for the India Against Corruption members to hold their fast. Rajinikanth's fan associations regularly organise blood donation and eye donation camps and distribute food during his birthday.|$|E
5|$|As of June 2017, Emirates has 48 orders {{outstanding}} {{but due to}} lack {{of space}} in Dubai Airport, it deferred 12 deliveries by one year and will not take any in 2019-20 before replacing its early airliners from 2021: there are open production slots in 2019 and Airbus reduced its production rate at 12 per year for 2017-18. The real backlog is much smaller than the official 107 with 47 uncertain orders: 20 commitments for the A380-specialized lessor Amedeo which commits to production only once aircraft are placed, eight for Qantas which wants to keep its fleet at 12, six for Virgin Atlantic which does not <b>want</b> <b>them</b> anymore and three ex Transaero for finance vehicle Air Accord.|$|E
5|$|Burton's death left Metallica's {{future in}} doubt. The three {{remaining}} members decided Burton would <b>want</b> <b>them</b> to carry on, {{and with the}} Burton family's blessings the band sought a replacement. Roughly 40 people, including Hammett's childhood friend, Les Claypool of Primus, Troy Gregory of Prong, and Jason Newsted, formerly of Flotsam and Jetsam, auditioned for the band. Newsted learned Metallica's entire set list; after the audition Metallica invited him to Tommy's Joynt in San Francisco. Hetfield, Ulrich, and Hammett decided on Newsted as Burton's replacement; Newsted's first live performance with Metallica was at the Country Club in Reseda, California. The members initiated Newsted by tricking him into eating a ball of wasabi.|$|E

5|$|Regarding the {{continuation}} of Slipknot, Taylor told NME Gray would <b>want</b> <b>them</b> to continue and he felt they should but he was ambivalent about returning to the band. Slipknot returned to touring in 2011, performing {{a small number of}} shows in Europe with bassist Dennis Curlee. They headlined the Sonisphere Festival and Rock in Rio alongside Iron Maiden and Metallica, and performed at Belgium's Graspop Metal Meeting. Donnie Steele substituted for Gray in the concerts; he was positioned behind Jordison and obscured from the audience's view.|$|E
5|$|Bhardwaj {{instructed}} the film's entire {{cast and crew}} to watch caper classics such as Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998), Snatch (2000), Pulp Fiction (1994) and True Romance (1993) to study the nuances and {{become familiar with the}} genre. Shahid Kapoor played both Charlie and Guddu, twin brothers with speech impediments; Charlie has a lisp and Guddu stammers. The producers did not <b>want</b> <b>them</b> to look like caricatures, so Kapoor prepared for both roles by meeting and interacting with speech therapists and people with these impediments. According to Kapoor, the producers wanted to find out about the medical reasons for the impediments and their mental effects. They met specialists and thoroughly researched stammering and lisping. Kapoor said that each role had its own challenges. Charlie's physique was very different from Kapoor's and it took him nearly a year to change the look of his body. He found changing from one character to the other difficult.|$|E
5|$|For the {{hand-held}} camera footage, Soderbergh used Panavision Millennium XLs {{that were}} smaller and lighter than previous cameras and {{allowed him to}} move freely. In order to tell the three stories apart, he adopted a distinctive look for each. For Robert Wakefield's story, Soderbergh used tungsten film with no filter for a cold, monochrome blue feel. For Helena Ayala's story, Soderbergh used diffusion filters, flashing the film, overexposing it for a warmer feel. For Javier Rodriguez's story, the director used tobacco filters and a 45-degree shutter angle whenever possible to produce a strobe-like sharp feel. Then, he took the entire film through an Ektachrome step, which increased the contrast and grain significantly. He wanted to have different looks for each story because the audience had {{to keep track of}} many characters and absorb a lot of information and he did not <b>want</b> <b>them</b> to have to figure out which story they were watching.|$|E

5|$|Gandhi used fasting as a {{political}} device, often threatening suicide unless demands were met. Congress publicised the fasts as {{a political}} action that generated widespread sympathy. In response the government tried to manipulate news coverage to minimise his challenge to the Raj. He fasted in 1932 to protest the voting scheme for separate political representation for Dalits; Gandhi did not <b>want</b> <b>them</b> segregated. The British government stopped the London press from showing photographs of his emaciated body, because it would elicit sympathy. Gandhi's 1943 hunger strike took place during a two-year prison term for the anticolonial Quit India movement. The government called on nutritional experts to demystify his action, and again no photos were allowed. However, his final fast in 1948, {{after the end of}} British rule in India, his hunger strike was lauded by the British press and this time did include full-length photos.|$|E
5|$|Phát was {{supposed}} to seize the second largest {{air force base in}} the country, located in the satellite city of Biên Hòa outside Saigon. This was to prevent Kỳ from mobilizing air power against them, but this failed, as Kỳ had already flown there to take control after dropping Khánh off at Vũng Tàu. Phát could not challenge Kỳ's fighter planes, which were already patrolling the air above Biên Hòa by the time they arrived. Kỳ flew a short distance southwest and circled Tân Sơn Nhất, threatening to bomb the rebels. Kỳ had never trusted Thảo or Phát, and did not <b>want</b> <b>them</b> in power. Most of the forces of the III and IV Corps surrounding the capital disliked both Khánh and the rebels, and took no action. As nightfall came, it appeared that forces loyal to Khánh were strengthening as they began to move towards Saigon.|$|E
5|$|The woman's {{hands are}} crossed tightly {{as if in}} prayer, and {{positioned}} so low in the painting as {{to appear to be}} resting on the frame. They are rendered as tightly compressed into a small area of the picture; it is likely van der Weyden did not <b>want</b> <b>them</b> to result in an area of high tone that might distract from the description of her head. Her slender fingers are minutely detailed; van der Weyden often indicated the social position of his models through his rendering of their face and hands. The sleeve of her dress extends beyond her wrists. Her fingers are folded in layers; their intricate portrayal is the most detailed element in the painting, and echoes the pyramidal form of the upper portion of the painting.|$|E

25|$|The {{separation}} axioms {{are about}} the use of topological means to distinguish disjoint sets and distinct points.

Similarly, it's not enough for subsets of a topological space to be disjoint; we may <b>want</b> <b>them</b> to be separated (in any of various ways). The separation axioms all say, in one way or another, that points or sets that are distinguishable or separated in some weak sense must also be distinguishable or separated in some stronger sense.|$|E
