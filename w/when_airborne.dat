25|$|On 22 November, the Bologna Division repulsed {{an attack}} from Tobruk towards Sidi Rezegh and next day, Rommel sent the Afrika Korps towards the Egyptian border (the Dash to the Wire) {{to exploit the}} victory and destroy XXX Corps. The blow mostly fell on empty desert and gave the Eighth Army time to regroup and re-arm. The Afrika Korps was ordered back to Tobruk, where the 70th Infantry Division and the New Zealand Division had gained the initiative. At noon on 27 November, the 15th Panzer Division reached Bir el Chleta and met the 22nd Armoured Brigade (reduced to a {{composite}} regiment of fewer than fifty tanks), which was joined later by the 4th Armoured Brigade. As night fell the British tanks disengaged and the New Zealand Division, fighting at the south-east {{end of the corridor}} into Tobruk, was endangered by the Afrika Korps. On 4 December, Rommel attacked Ed Duda and was repulsed by the 14th Infantry Brigade of the 70th Infantry Division. Rommel ordered a retirement from the eastern perimeter of Tobruk, to concentrate against XXX Corps to the south. On 7 December, the 4th Armoured Brigade engaged 15th Panzer Division and knocked out eleven tanks. Rommel was told on 5 December, by Comando Supremo that supply could not improve {{until the end of the}} month, <b>when</b> <b>airborne</b> deliveries from Sicily began. Rommel decided to abandon Tobruk and withdraw to Gazala, which led to the relief of Tobruk and the occupation of Cyrenaica.|$|E
2500|$|The 4th ACCS was the {{workhorse}} of ALCS operations. Three dedicated Airborne Launch Control Centers (ALCC) were {{on ground}} alert around-the-clock providing ALCS coverage for {{five of the}} six Minuteman ICBM Wings. These dedicated ALCCs were mostly EC-135A aircraft but could also have been EC-135C or EC-135G aircraft depending on availability. ALCC No. 1 was on ground alert at Ellsworth AFB, SD and during a wartime scenario would have taken off and orbited between the Minuteman Wings at Ellsworth AFB, SD and F.E. Warren AFB, WY providing ALCS assistance if needed. ALCCs No. 2 and No. 3 were routinely on forward deployed ground alert at Minot AFB, ND. During a wartime scenario, ALCC No. 3 would have orbited between the Minuteman ICBM Wings at Minot AFB and Grand Forks AFB, both in North Dakota, providing ALCS assistance if needed. ALCC No. 2 was dedicated to orbiting near the Minuteman ICBM Wing at Malmstrom AFB, MT providing ALCS assistance if needed. The 4th ACCS also maintained an EC-135C or EC-135G on ground alert at Ellsworth AFB, SD as the West Auxiliary Airborne Command Post (WESTAUXCP) as a backup to SAC’s [...] "Looking Glass" [...] Airborne Command Post (ABNCP) as well as a radio relay link between the Looking Glass and ALCCs <b>when</b> <b>airborne.</b> Although equipped with ALCS, the WESTAUXCP did not have a dedicated Minuteman ICBM wing to provide ALCS assistance to.|$|E

2500|$|Flying fish (gliding). There {{are over}} 50 species of flying fish {{belonging}} to the family Exocoetidae. They are mostly marine fishes of small to medium size. The largest flying fish can reach lengths of [...] but most species measure less than [...] in length. They {{can be divided into}} two-winged varieties and four-winged varieties. Before the fish leaves the water it increases its speed to around 30 body lengths per second and as it breaks the surface and is freed from the drag of the water it can be traveling at around [...] The glides are usually up to [...] in length, but some have been observed soaring for hundreds of metres using the updraft on the leading edges of waves. The fish can also make a series of glides, each time dipping the tail into the water to produce forward thrust. The longest recorded series of glides, with the fish only periodically dipping its tail in the water, was for 45 seconds (Video here [...] ). It has been suggested that the genus Exocoetus is on an evolutionary borderline between flight and gliding. It flaps its enlarged pectoral fins <b>when</b> <b>airborne,</b> but still seems only to glide, as there is no hint of a power stroke. It has been found that some flying fish can glide as effectively as some flying birds.|$|E

50|$|Most fungus gnats {{are weak}} fliers, and {{can often be}} seen walking rapidly over plants and soil, rather than flying.

50|$|Zapdos {{is always}} seen in {{conjunction}} with thunderstorms, because it gathers energy from the electricity in the atmosphere, and is said to live in such clouds.

50|$|Geologists {{agree on}} the fact that Lipari was created by a {{succession}} of four volcanic movements, the most important of which was the third one, presumably lasting from 20,000 BC to 13,000 BC.

50|$|The working {{conditions}} vary from {{working for a}} regional aerial surveying firm on a part-time base to working full-time in a large organization {{where there is a}} career path and other additional duties.

A large percentage of sensor operators spend a considerable amount of time away from home because of the diverse locations of collection areas. <b>When</b> <b>airborne</b> sensor operators are away from home, the agencies or companies provide lodging accommodations, transportation between lodging and the airfield or launch/recovery location, and an allowance for meals and other expenses.

40|$|Abstract: <b>When</b> {{processing}} <b>airborne</b> SAR data, {{motion compensation}} is an unavoidable step. Accurate motion compensation requires {{the knowledge of}} the exact position of the platform at each pulse. This paper studies the trade-off between two approaches.

The second approach is to accept a less accurate position estimation and to analyze in which way an autofocus algorithm is able to compensate position measurement errors. 1...|$|R

The resulting attack left 63 people dead and at least 100 more wounded.|$|R
50|$|Peanut rust {{is unique}} {{because it is}} not a native disease to the U.S. and {{has not been able to}} survive beyond a single season <b>when</b> introduced. <b>Airborne</b> spores are {{annually}} introduced from other peanut-producing nations. Rust causes reduced peanut pod fill and can potentially defoliate the entire crop if the conditions are right. Originally copper and sulfur were used to control rust, but they were only partially effective. It was not until the development of chlorothalonil and tebuconazole that an effective treatment for peanut rust was found.|$|R
