500|$|In October 2012, Solis {{defended the}} work of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, after the Current Population Survey it puts out monthly {{reported}} that unemployment in the United States had fallen below eight percent for this first time since Obama took office. Some critics, including former General Electric CEO Jack Welch, charged that the number had been tampered with in order to benefit Obama one month before the U.S. presidential election. [...] Solis said, [...] "I'm insulted when I hear that because <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> professional, civil service organization where you have top, top economists that work at the BLS. They've been doing these calculations. These are our best trained and best-skilled individuals working in the BLS, and it's really ludicrous to hear that kind of statement." [...] For the year, the Labor Department set a record for the most back pay it had ever collected due to wage violations, $280million going to some 300,000workers. [...] Workplace fatalities in construction and general industrial sectors reached an all-time low.|$|E
500|$|Key to this {{sequence}} is the Codex Amiatinus, an almost complete Bible for which <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> precise terminus ante quem, and within which, {{because of its}} size, developments in style {{can be seen in}} a single manuscript. [...] The Codex Amiatinus can be precisely located as leaving Wearmouth-Jarrow with a party led by Abbot Ceolfrith on 4 June 716, bound for Rome. [...] The codex was to be presented to Pope Gregory II, a decision only announced by Ceolfrith very shortly before the departure, allowing the dedication page to be dated with confidence to around May 716, though the rest of the manuscript was probably already some years old, but only begun after Ceolfrith succeeded as abbot in 689. [...] The script of the dedication page differs slightly from that of the main text, but is by the same hand and in the same [...] "elaborated text uncial" [...] style as some pages at Durham (MS A II 17, part ii, ff 103-11). [...] At the end of the sequence, {{it may be possible to}} date the Saint Petersburg Bede to 746 at the earliest, from references in memoranda in the text, although this remains a matter of controversy.|$|E
500|$|... "Tea Leaves" [...] {{was written}} by Matthew Weiner and Erin Levy and {{directed}} by series star Jon Hamm. This is the first episode of the series that Jon Hamm had directed, with Hamm saying that he owes thanks to John Slattery for paving the way. As preparation for directing the Rolling Stones concert, Hamm looked over archival photographs of the original concert. [...] "They were kids. The Rolling Stones. It was them and The Beatles. These huge pop explosions. People were really excited about {{it and it was}} a really big deal. And, in a larger sense, gave us a sense of where advertising is going." [...] Reflecting on his directing job, Hamm noted that he tried not to put much distracting style into the show, explaining that [...] "My job was not {{to go in there and}} muck it up and say, [...] "I'm gonna put my stamp on this." [...] My job was to go in there and keep the train on the tracks, basically. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> firmly established tone and look to our show that people respond to, and that I love." [...] Although the third episode of the season, it was actually the first episode produced for season, prior to the two-part season premiere, [...] "A Little Kiss".|$|E

2500|$|During {{a hearing}} before the Joint Economic Committee October 4, 2011, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said, [...] "eople are quite unhappy {{with the state of}} the economy and what’s happening. They blame, with some justification, the {{problems}} in the financial sector for getting us into this mess, and they’re dissatisfied with the policy response here in Washington. And at some level, I can’t blame them. Certainly, 9 percent unemployment and very slow growth is not a good situation." [...] On November 2, he again expressed sympathy with frustrations about the economy but also said many of the complaints levied at the Fed, including those made against the steps it took during the financial crisis, are misguided. “The concerns about the Fed are based on misconceptions,” he said. “A very simplistic interpretation of that [...] was that we were doing that because we wanted to preserve banker salaries. That was obviously not the case.” Dallas Federal Reserve President Richard W. Fisher said that he was [...] "somewhat sympathetic" [...] to the views of the protesters, and added, [...] "We have too many people out of work. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> uneven distribution of income. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> frustrated people, and I can understand their frustration." ...|$|E

You'll look beautiful. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> limited budget but honest, you'll be proud.' And it was bad, very bad. At least that was what I was told. After watching the first two minutes I had {{to turn it off}} and hide under the covers." ...|$|E
2500|$|Theron Martin of Anime News Network {{labelled}} the [...] "Hestia Factor" [...] {{as one of}} {{the reasons}} for DanMachis success, citing Inori Minase's voice acting, character development, as well as relationship with Bell. In a review of the series' first novel, Martin further wrote that [...] "Fujino Ōmori's writing skill is actually higher than average [...] By the end of the novel <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> good sense of who most of the major players are and where they stand, especially Bell and Hestia." [...] iDigitalTimes, in a review of the DanMachi anime, found the relationship between Bell and Hestia to be [...] "really touching", writing [...] "she obviously loves him and wants to be with him, not simply as patron goddess but as a lover. Bell’s ignorance to her every overture is a grating genre standard, but his trademark obliviousness lessens Hestia’s love for Bell not a whit." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to series {{producer}} Janet Carr, {{making the}} show was [...] "an immense challenge, but... great fun". In response to receiving a Lizzie Award, she said, [...] "Being acknowledged like {{this is just the}} icing on the cake. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> small, hardworking team, and this award is dedicated to everyone who has helped make Good Game the show that it is." [...] Bajo has said, [...] "There's lots of late nights for all of us, so the show receiving these awards has been really uplifting." [...] In fact, the show has explained via their Facebook page that the cast and crew have sometimes had all-nighters in order to wrap up episodes in time for their broadcast dates. Bajo explained, [...] "It's such a team effort [...] it would be unprofessional and incorrect to take too much of that kudos... I think we're our own worst and best critics... we know if something worked or if it didn't so we're always trying new things." ...|$|E
2500|$|In May 2011, {{days before}} the release of The Hangover Part II, {{director}} Todd Phillips said that [...] "there already are plans for a third film but no script or start date". About the possibility of The Hangover Part III, Phillips stated, [...] "If we were to do a third one, if the audience, if the desire was there, I think <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> clear idea where that would head. It's certainly {{not in the same}} template that you've seen these movies. The third would be very much a finale and an ending. The most I could say about it, what's in my head, and I haven't discussed it with these actors, {{is that it is not}} following that template but very much a new idea. As far as where it takes place, I said I'm very open." [...] Also during May, Craig Mazin, who co-wrote The Hangover Part II, entered early talks to write the script for the third installment.|$|E

[...] "There are some practical, pragmatic decisions made. If you’re playing to a crowd who are not very familiar with you, there's no point of going too deep but we do always make sure we play a new song. Like on Guns N' Roses [...] we had fifty minutes which is ten songs all in. So, you know we just made sure that in those ten songs we played 'Deeply Ordered Chaos' which we’re proud of and it makes a certain statement. And it just alerts people to the fact that, yes, we have made a record in the last 30 years. You know and that’s a good thing. Psychologically, that's the blood transfusion that we need. And we're very mindful, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> loyal fan base. We don’t pander as you well know." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1991 {{a number}} of party venues closed, {{including}} Ufo, and the Berlin Techno scene centered itself around three locations close to {{the foundations of the}} Berlin Wall: Planet (later renamed E-Werk by Paul van Dyk), Der Bunker, and the relatively long-lived Tresor. It was in Tresor at this time that a trend in paramilitary clothing was established (amongst the techno fraternity) by a DJ called Tanith; possibly as an expression of a commitment to the underground aesthetic of the music, or perhaps influenced by UR's paramilitary posturing. In the same period, German DJs began intensifying the speed and abrasiveness of the sound, as an acid infused techno began transmuting into hardcore. DJ Tanith commented at the time that [...] "Berlin was always hardcore, hardcore hippie, hardcore punk, and now <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> hardcore house sound." [...] This emerging sound is thought to have been influenced by Dutch gabber and Belgian hardcore; styles that were in their own perverse way paying homage to Underground Resistance and Richie Hawtin's Plus 8 Records. Other influences on the development of this style were European Electronic Body Music (EBM) groups of the mid-1980s such as DAF, Front 242, and Nitzer Ebb.|$|E
2500|$|On December 6, 1862 Fagan's brigade {{arrived at}} Morrow’s and {{controlled}} all the approaches to Cane Hill {{from the south}} and east. Hindman then learned of the approach of General Herron, who had two divisions just north of Fayetteville. Hindman planned to get behind the Federal division of General Blunt and prevent General Herron’s division from combining with Gen. Blunt. Upon reaching the high ground at Prairie Grove on December 7, Hindman’ s army formed on ridge overlooking Crawford Prairie and Fagan's brigade was advanced to a position fifty yards from the Borden Orchard. The position was very good and there the army waited for Herron to advance. Brook’s regiment was posted behind an artillery battery. Around 2:00 pm the artillery duel started. Blocher’s Battery, which was part of Fagan's brigade became a lightning rod for Federal artillery and later infantry. The 20th Wisconsin advanced to take the battery and when their right flank was 50 yards away from their Brook’s 34th Arkansas rose and fired into them. The regiment was ordered forward along with Chew’s Arkansas Infantry Battalion and Hawthorne’s regiment. The 20th Wisconsin was driven back and the battery was retaken. As the Confederate counterattack came off the ridge and onto the prairie they came under heavy fire and retreated to their position in the ravine. As the Confederates were reorganizing another Federal attack was launched. This time the 37th Illinois advanced to the summit. Again the Fagan's brigade rose out of the scrub and fired a point blank volley and charged. The two forces locked in hand-to-hand fighting. Again the Confederates followed the retreating Federals and ran into heavy fire. As the brigade resumed their position on the summit, the tempo of the battle slowed and shifted {{to another part of the}} battlefield. They stayed in position until nearly midnight when the order to retreat came. During the march over the Boston Mountains many of the men deserted to their homes. In April 1862, Colonel King wrote home to his mother and had this to say about the regiment, [...] "The fight at Prairie Grove notwithstanding. We whipped it proved to be a very disastrous one to us. My loss in the fight was a very heavy one. I lost one hundred and thirty two men, killed and wounded out of less than five hundred men. I still have a fine Regt. and am ready for another fight. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> fine army here and will move in a few days but where to I can’t tell." ...|$|E
