5|$|On April 30, 2012, Microsoft Studios {{announced}} that Forward Unto Dawn would play on Machinima Prime and Halo <b>Waypoint</b> (a marketing website for the Halo series) during the {{weeks leading up}} to the release of Halo 4. The series' first episode attracted five million views on YouTube within two weeks and, as of March 2013, has eleven million views. The second episode attracted three million views within two weeks and six million views by March 2013; however, these statistics do not include views on Halo <b>Waypoint.</b>|$|E
5|$|Several episodes were {{originally}} broadcast on Halo <b>Waypoint</b> on the specified date. The episodes range in length from ten to twenty minutes.|$|E
5|$|At 01:38 MYT, Ho Chi Minh Area Control Centre (ACC) {{contacted}} Kuala Lumpur Area Control Centre {{to query}} {{the whereabouts of}} Flight 370 and informed them {{that they had not}} established verbal contact with Flight 370, which was last detected by radar at <b>waypoint</b> BITOD. The two centres exchanged four more calls over the next 20 minutes with no new information.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — We are {{interested}} in the multiple robot surveil-lance problem where robots must allocate <b>waypoints</b> to be visited among themselves and plan paths through different <b>waypoints</b> while avoiding obstacles. Furthermore, the robots are allocated specific times to reach their respective goal locations and as a result they have to decide which robots have to visit which <b>waypoints.</b> Such a problem has the challenge of computing the allocation of <b>waypoints</b> across robots, ordering for these <b>waypoints</b> and dynamical feasibility of the paths between <b>waypoints.</b> We present an algorithm that runs a series of graph searches to solve the problem and provide theoretical analysis that our approach yields an optimal solution. We present simulated results as well as experiments on two UAVs that validate the capability of our algorithm. For a single robot, we can solve instances having 10 - 15 <b>waypoints</b> and for multiple robots, instances having five robots and 10 <b>waypoints</b> can be solved. I...|$|R
30|$|The <b>waypoints</b> {{are chosen}} to steer each glider’s motion to the {{trajectory}} planned by the method presented in Section  3.2. 1. There are two principles for converting trajectory to <b>waypoints</b> [18]. One is to space <b>waypoints</b> uniformly {{in time and}} the other is to let the <b>waypoints</b> subject to a maximum spacing constrain. Considering the practical operation, the second method is adopted to set a maximum space between two <b>waypoints,</b> which is an optimization problem obtaining optimal points on the curve to minimize the distance function.|$|R
5|$|Cryptum {{received}} mixed reviews; {{some critics}} liked the Forerunner culture and suspense that Bear created, but others disliked the characters, found the plot too slow {{and concluded that}} the novel was suited only to existing fans of the Halo series. Cryptum appeared on multiple bestseller lists after promotion on Halo <b>Waypoint,</b> a website that serves as a hub for Halo-related information.|$|E
5|$|As with {{previous}} Halo titles, 343 Industries provides a statistic tracking service for players of Halo 4. Player data such as game history, character progression, and various statistics {{can be accessed}} in game or via the Halo <b>Waypoint</b> website. The web services team at 343 Industries utilized the Windows Azure Service Bus messaging infrastructure to relay data from the Xbox Live network to back-end databases, where player data and information is stored. Halo 4 player data can also be accessed via the Xbox SmartGlass application.|$|E
5|$|KAL007's {{divergence}} {{prevented the}} aircraft from transmitting its position via shorter range {{very high frequency}} radio (VHF). It therefore requested KAL015, also en route to Seoul, to relay reports to air traffic control on its behalf. KAL007 requested KAL015 to relay its position three times. At 14:43UTC, KAL007 directly transmitted a change of {{estimated time of arrival}} for its next <b>waypoint,</b> NEEVA, to the international flight service station at Anchorage, but it did so over the longer range high frequency radio (HF) rather than VHF. HF transmissions are able to carry a longer distance than VHF, but are vulnerable to electromagnetic interference and static; VHF is clearer with less interference, and preferred by flight crews. The inability to establish direct radio communications to be able to transmit their position directly did not alert the pilots of KAL007 of their ever-increasing divergence and was not considered unusual by air traffic controllers. Halfway between Bethel and <b>waypoint</b> NABIE, KAL007 passed through the southern portion of the North American Aerospace Defense Command buffer zone. This zone is north of Romeo 20 and off-limits to civilian aircraft.|$|E

50|$|Although {{the concept}} of <b>waypoints</b> has been greatly popularized among non-specialists by the {{development}} of the GPS, <b>waypoints</b> can be used with other navigational aids. A notable example is the worldwide use, in orienteering sports, of <b>waypoints</b> with a map that omits a coordinate system, known as control points.|$|R
50|$|There {{also may}} be limited {{opportunities}} for Sailors in overmanned ratings to cross- rate into the MC rating using Career <b>Waypoints.</b> Career <b>Waypoints</b> is the Navy’s long-term force management tool, balancing enlisted manning through the Navy-wide control of reenlistment and enlistment contract extension quotas.

5|$|In the {{beginning}} of a match, a 30-second headstart is given to the Monster so that they can have enough time to escape before the Hunters parachute from a plane to where the Monster started. Each map features an open world environment for players to explore and play within. To help the Hunters navigate the environments quickly, they are equipped with jetpacks, allowing them to jump over obstacles and cliffs. The jetpack {{can also be used to}} dodge attacks performed by the monster, though it consumes a Hunter's energy. The team can track the monster, as well as place waypoints on an interactive map. The color of these waypoints are different based on what players have marked. The <b>waypoint</b> mark turns yellow for environment, orange for wildlife or red for the Monster.|$|E
5|$|In {{the weeks}} before release, Tor Books {{released}} Chapter One for free, and Chapter Two was made available on the Halo <b>Waypoint</b> website. Tor also ran seven giveaways of the other Halo novels and action figures. An unabridged audio book, narrated by Holter Graham, was released alongside the print edition on January 4, 2011. Upon release Greg Bear did book signings attended by Frank O'Connor. Following its release, Cryptum reached number 22 in the New York Times Best Seller List in the Hardcover Fiction category. It also spent five weeks on the Los Angeles Times Hardcover Fiction Bestseller list, reaching number 17. Publishers Weekly noted that the book was a bestseller in the hardcovers category in early September 2011 at Borders.|$|E
5|$|Brown was {{classified}} 1-A in 1944 and commissioned as a {{lieutenant in the}} U.S. Navy. He served at the Great Lakes Naval Training Station outside Chicago as head coach of its Bluejacket football team, which competed against other service teams and college programs. The station was a <b>waypoint</b> for Navy recruits between training and active service in World War II, but its commanders took athletics seriously and saw winning as a morale-booster and a point of personal pride. Brown could have been called up for active duty – Tony Hinkle, his predecessor, was already serving in the Pacific – but the war began to wind down as Brown arrived. Brown had little time to institute his system, and instead adopted Hinkle's offensive scheme, borrowed from the Chicago Bears. He had a smattering of talented players, including defensive end George Young and halfback Ara Parseghian. In 1944, the team lost to Ohio State and Notre Dame, but finished with a 9–2–1 record and was among the top 20 teams in the AP Poll.|$|E
50|$|TomTom devices as of 2014 {{will only}} accept at most 255 <b>waypoints.</b> Devices before that allow 32 or 48 at most, with an {{exception}} for the Rider product range, allowing 100 <b>waypoints.</b>|$|R
40|$|An {{alternate}} guidance {{scheme of}} unmanned air vehicles based on fuzzy sets and fixed way points was proposed. The use of fuzzy approach was {{justified by the}} generating additional intelligence onboard autonomous vehicles. The five-dimensional waypoint-based fuzzy guidance system (FGS) for unmanned aircraft vehicles dealt with unflyable <b>waypoints</b> and driving the aircraft on flyable trajectories that try to cross the <b>waypoints.</b> Computer simulations show that the aircraft correctly crosses all <b>waypoints</b> in the specified order...|$|R
25|$|GPS integration: read {{tracks and}} <b>waypoints</b> from a GPS device.

5|$|Research done in {{the early}} 1960s by Norwegian {{explorer}} Helge Ingstad and his wife, archaeologist Anne Stine Ingstad, identified a Norse settlement located at {{the northern tip of}} Newfoundland. It has been suggested that this site, known as L'Anse aux Meadows, is Leif's settlement of Leifsbúðir. The Ingstads demonstrated that Norsemen had reached America about 500 years before Christopher Columbus. Later archaeological evidence suggests that Vinland may have been the areas around the Gulf of St. Lawrence and that the L'Anse aux Meadows site was a ship repair station and <b>waypoint</b> for voyages there. That does not necessarily contradict the identification of L'Anse aux Meadows with Leifsbúðir since the two sagas appear to describe Vinland as a wider region which included several settlements. The Saga of Erik the Red mentions two other settlements in Vinland: a settlement called Straumfjǫrðr, which lay beyond Kjalarnes promontory and the Wonderstrands, and one called Hóp, which was located even farther south.|$|E
5|$|Countries were {{reluctant}} to release information collected from military radar because of sensitivity about revealing their capabilities. Indonesia has an early-warning radar system, but its air traffic control radar did not register any aircraft with the transponder code used by Flight 370, despite the aircraft possibly having flown near, or over, {{the northern tip of}} Sumatra. Indonesian military radar tracked Flight 370 earlier when en route to <b>waypoint</b> IGARI before the transponder is thought to have been turned off, but did not provide information on whether it was detected afterwards. Thailand and Vietnam also detected Flight 370 on radar before the transponder stopped working. The radar position symbols for the transponder code used by Flight 370 vanished after the transponder is thought to have been turned off. Thai military radar detected an aircraft that might have been Flight 370, but it is not known what time the last radar contact was made. The signal did not include identifying data. The flight was also not detected by Australia's conventional or its long-range JORN over-the-horizon radar system, which has an official range of 3,000km, the latter not being in operation {{on the night of the}} disappearance.|$|E
25|$|Most recently, This Spartan Life {{has been}} {{distributed}} on Xbox Live's central hub for Halo, Halo <b>Waypoint.</b> The new episodes on Halo <b>Waypoint</b> include interviews {{with members of}} the band OK Go and an interview with Ultima Online creator Richard Garriott.|$|E
40|$|Information {{needs are}} rarely {{satisfied}} directly on search engine result pages. Searchers usually need to click through to search results (landing pages) and follow search trails beyond those pages to fulfill information needs. We {{use the term}} <b>waypoints</b> to describe pages visited by searchers between the trail origin (the landing page) and the trail destination. The role that <b>waypoints</b> play in search interaction is poorly understood yet can be vital in determining search success. In this poster we analyze log data to determine the arrangement and function of <b>waypoints,</b> and study how these are affected by variations in information goals. Our findings have implications for understanding search behavior and {{for the design of}} interactive search support based on <b>waypoints...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{describes}} a sampling-based approach to multi-robot motion planning. The proposed approach is centralized, {{which aims to}} reduce interference between mobile robots such as collision, congestion and deadlock, by {{increasing the number of}} <b>waypoints.</b> The implementation based on occupancy grid map is decomposed into three steps: {{the first step is to}} identify primary <b>waypoints</b> by using the Voronoi diagram, the second step is to generate additional <b>waypoints</b> by sampling the Voronoi diagram, and the last step is to assign the <b>waypoints</b> to robots by using the Hungarian method. The approach has been implemented and tested in simulation and the experimental results show a good system performance for multi-robot motion planning. ...|$|R
50|$|In {{the modern}} world, <b>waypoints</b> are {{increasingly}} abstract, often having no obvious relationship to any distinctive {{features of the}} real world. These <b>waypoints</b> are used to help define invisible routing paths for navigation. For example, artificial airways—“highways in the sky” created specifically for purposes of air navigation—often have no clear connection to features of the real world, and consist only {{of a series of}} abstract <b>waypoints</b> in the sky through which pilots navigate; these airways are designed to facilitate air traffic control and routing of traffic between heavily traveled locations, and do not reference natural terrain features. Abstract <b>waypoints</b> of this kind have been made practical by modern navigation technologies, such as land-based radio beacons and the satellite-based GPS.|$|R

25|$|At 13:17:15 Flight 7628 {{contacted}} ATC {{to report}} it was at flight level (FL) 8400 meters and requested permission to climb to FL 9600 meters. Flight 7628 also informed ATC it would reach the Volchansk <b>waypoint</b> at 13:22 and the Krasnohrad <b>waypoint</b> at 13:28, but controller Zhukovsky incorrectly recorded 13:19 to 13:26 respectively, which placed the aircraft ahead of schedule. At 13:21:43 Flight 7628 re-contacted the ATC center and again requested permission to climb up to 9600 meters, but Zhukovsky rejected that request.|$|E

5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{has three}} autopilot modes. The standard mode for en-route navigation is LNAV, which navigates along a {{great circle route}} between <b>waypoints,</b> adjusting the aircraft's heading to compensate for wind. Other modes will maintain the aircraft's heading—direction the nose is pointed (flight path {{will be affected by}} winds)—or the aircraft's track—direction the aircraft travels (flight path in a straight direction). The latter two modes are further affected by whether the aircraft used magnetic (normal reference) or true north (typically only used at high latitudes) as the reference for the autopilot. Since Flight 370 flew near <b>waypoints</b> VAMPI, MEKAR, NILAM, and possibly IGOGU—all along air route N571—while traversing the Malacca Strait, investigators considered whether Flight 370 followed any air routes or intersected any <b>waypoints</b> in the Southern Indian Ocean. <b>Waypoints</b> MUTMI and RUNUT were considered possible points that Flight 370 may have traversed, but tracks through these <b>waypoints</b> did not correlate well with paths generated from the BTO and BFO analysis.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the development and}} the simulation results of a GPS-based way-points Fuzzy Guidance System (FGS). <b>Waypoints</b> are described in a 5 -dimensional space: position in 3 -dimensions plus desired crossing heading and velocity. The aircraft {{is assumed to be}} autopiloted in velocity, heading and flight path angle. The FGS is based on three standard Takagi-Sugeno 1 fuzzy controllers that generate separately velocity, heading and flight path angle references for the autopilots. Simulation results show that, under the fuzzy guidance, the aircraft correctly crosses all <b>waypoints</b> in the specified sequential order. The FGS handles a non-flyable <b>waypoints</b> set as well, driving the aircraft on flyable trajectories that try to cross the <b>waypoints</b> at the prescribed altitude and with prescribed heading...|$|R
50|$|<b>Waypoints</b> are sets of {{coordinates}} {{that identify}} {{a point in}} physical space. Coordinates used can {{vary depending on the}} application. For terrestrial navigation these coordinates can include longitude and latitude. Air navigation also includes altitude. <b>Waypoints</b> have only become widespread for navigational use by the layman since the development of advanced navigational systems, such as the Global Positioning System (GPS) and certain other types of radio navigation. <b>Waypoints</b> located {{on the surface of the}} Earth are usually defined in two dimensions (e.g., longitude and latitude); those used in the Earth's atmosphere or in outer space are defined in at least three dimensions (four if time is one of the coordinates, as it might be for some <b>waypoints</b> outside the Earth).|$|R
