25|$|The {{other four}} men {{eventually}} agreed to attend their commissions. Bin al-Shibh, however, {{has continued to}} refuse to attend. His appointed attorneys had expressed concern about him and his state of mental health.

This partnership allows members to spend their Skywards Miles at participating Dubai Duty Free outlets <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>travel</b> through Dubai airports. Members can redeem their Skywards Miles for duty-free products at Dubai International airport and Al Maktoum International at Dubai South. Redemptions start from 4,500 Skywards Miles (worth AED 100), and members can instantly redeem Skywards Miles at the checkout. Each additional Dirham (AED) is equivalent to 45 Skywards Miles, {{and there is no}} upper limit to the number of Skywards Miles that can be spent.|$|E
25|$|Light rays bend <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>travel</b> {{from one}} medium to another; {{the amount of}} bending is {{determined}} by the refractive indices of the two media. If one medium has a particular curved shape, it functions as a lens. The cornea, humours, and crystalline lens of the eye together form a lens that focuses images on the retina. Our eyes are adapted for viewing in air. Water, however, has approximately the same refractive index as the cornea (both about 1.33), so immersion effectively eliminates the cornea's focusing properties. When our eyes are in water, instead of focusing images on the retina, they now focus them far behind the retina, resulting in an extremely blurred image from hypermetropia.|$|E
25|$|Although a spinoff of The Weather Channel, Local Now is {{formatted}} as {{a general}} news and weather channel. Because of the distribution structure of over-the-top subscription television, Local Now utilizes a version of TWC's IntelliStar unit – installed at The Weather Channel's uplink site in Atlanta – that are configured differently from that used by The Weather Channel and Weatherscan, allowing for the recycling of segments featured in one news block seamlessly into another and routine updating of segments {{to each of the}} localized feeds. Local Now's automated model – which leverages The Weather Channel's existing infrastructure and technology, and employs only three staff members – allows Local Now to be offered {{at a fraction of the}} retransmission rates charged by local broadcast stations. Users of the Local Now website and mobile app, and subscribers of over-the-top MVPD providers carrying the channel, are able to access their local feed based on ZIP code, by their IP address via geolocation, or by manual selection, allowing subscribers to access a feed from another city <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>travel</b> outside of their home market.|$|E

500|$|Mature {{dendritic}} cells activate [...] T {{helper cells}} and cytotoxic T cells. The activated helper T cells interact with macrophages and B cells to activate them in turn. In addition, dendritic cells {{can influence the}} type of immune response produced; <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>travel</b> to the lymphoid areas where T cells are held they can activate T cells, which then differentiate into cytotoxic T cells or helper T cells.|$|E
500|$|Devaluation, {{with its}} adverse consequences, has {{historically}} rarely been a preferred strategy. According to economist Richard N. Cooper, writing in 1971, a substantial devaluation {{is one of}} the most [...] "traumatic" [...] policies a government can adopt – it almost always resulted in cries of outrage and calls for the government to be replaced. Devaluation can lead to a reduction in citizens' standard of living as their purchasing power is reduced both when they buy imports and <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>travel</b> abroad. It also can add to inflationary pressure. Devaluation can make interest payments on international debt more expensive if those debts are denominated in a foreign currency, and it can discourage foreign investors. At least until the 21st century, a strong currency was commonly seen as a mark of prestige, while devaluation was associated with weak governments.|$|E
500|$|Glover sees Al•Ith, Ben Ata and Vahshi as allegories {{for their}} {{respective}} zones, and the marriages between them as marriages between the zones, {{as stated by}} {{the title of the}} book. Author Müge Galin says that Al•Ith functions according to the nature of Zone Three rather than as an individual. Galin also argues that the six zones correspond to Sufism's different levels of consciousness. Both Al•Ith and Ben Ata are able to experience other levels of consciousness <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>travel</b> to each other's zones, but Al•Ith can perceive and experience the neighbouring zone far deeper than Ben Ata because she is from a higher zone/level of consciousness. Galin says that on the [...] "Sufi ladder to enlightenment", those on higher rungs must pull up those on lower rungs. Thus Al•Ith can only move to Zone Two after she has pulled Ben Ata up to Zone Three.|$|E

500|$|While {{watching}} the local news, {{it is also}} discovered that former President George W. Bush, who has lost the 2004 election, has returned to Texas which has seceded from the United States, {{along with the rest}} of the southern United States, reforming the Confederate States of America, resulting in a second Civil War. Brian insists that things will still be better in the end, but <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>travel</b> five years into the future they find a computer generated post-apocalyptic future caused by nuclear attacks all across the United States which results in the deaths of over 17 million people (including Cesar Millan much to Brian's horror). Admitting that he made a mistake, Brian asks how the situation can be resolved. The two then return to prevent Brian from telling his past self about the attacks. They then return to the present, whereupon Stewie learns that Brian has taken false credit for the Harry Potter series. Seeing that Brian has learned nothing from his warnings, Stewie says they have to repair this by again trying to prevent themselves from telling any future events. This causes hundreds of Stewies and Brians to appear, however, to prevent them from telling the future. This number includes one Brian and Stewie with their Peter who says he [...] "just came for the can", another Brian and Stewie trapped in barber shop twirls, one Brian and Stewie dressed up in their banana outfits, and a Stewie who arrives with his Brian whose throat is slit. Having had enough of this, one Stewie tells all of his and his Brian's numerous future selves to decide whether or not to prevent 9/11, which results in the majority saying no, not to for tell any future events, and to return to their time and stay there. All the Brians and Stewies do it as they are told. From there, Stewie takes Brian back a minute before their past selves arrive and forces them at gunpoint to return to their time. After initial confusion resulting with the Brian that just arrived being shot in the leg, they comply. With that, the altered timeline ceases to exist along with its corresponding Stewie and Brian.|$|E

2500|$|In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Hermione used an Undetectable Extension Charm on her beaded handbag, {{significantly}} {{enlarging the}} bag's internal dimensions without affecting its physical size. As well, {{the mass of}} the objects placed in her handbag is negated, making the bag easy to carry. Bags similar to this appear in other contexts, such as the [...] "bag of holding" [...] in Dungeons and Dragons or the [...] "magic satchel" [...] in many other games.

Aided by Naruto and Sasuke, Boruto is able to defeat Momoshiki. Though dying, noting his killer's untapped potential, Momoshiki lives long enough to have a private discussion with Boruto and warns him that he soon will face much tribulation later on in his life. As Sasuke interrogates a criminal who knows of Boruto's mark, he reveals to Naruto and his underlings there is a group called [...] that are searching for people with marks.|$|E
