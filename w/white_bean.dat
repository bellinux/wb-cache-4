5|$|Villani {{states that}} the whole {{population}} of Florence—men, women, and children—in reference to the years 1336 to 1338, {{was estimated to be}} 90,000 due to the amount of bread needed daily. Villani recorded an exact figure of 94,000 residents (which he says was very reliable data that included even the poor) in April 1347, a year before the Black Death. A black bean was deposited for every male child baptized and a <b>white</b> <b>bean</b> deposited for every female child baptized in the Florence Baptistry—from these baptisms the average annual birth rate was figured at 5,500 to 6,000. Villani pointed out that the newborn males often outnumbered the newborn females by 300 to 500 on each count. He noted that in his day the adult, male citizen population of the city was about 25,000 (those between the age of fifteen and seventy who could bear arms); 1,500 of these were noble and upper class citizens. Giovanni Villani stated that at all times there were about 1,500 foreigners, transients, and soldiers in the city.|$|E
25|$|In ancient Greece and Rome, beans {{were used}} in voting; a <b>white</b> <b>bean</b> was used to cast a yes vote, and a black bean for no.

2500|$|The {{statement}} also {{relies on}} the inference that the sampling was random. [...] If someone had been picking through the bag to find <b>white</b> <b>beans,</b> then it would explain why the handful had so many <b>white</b> <b>beans,</b> and also explain why the number of <b>white</b> <b>beans</b> in the bag was depleted (although the bag is probably intended to be assumed much larger than one's hand).|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In this study, one {{variety of}} <b>white</b> <b>beans</b> {{was used to}} study the effect of {{toasting}} and microwaving on chemical composition and phenolic compounds of <b>white</b> <b>beans</b> flour (Phaseolus vulgaris L.). The antioxidant activity and phenolic acids of the aqueous extracts were studied. Maximal antioxidant activities was observed in the 45 min toasted and 3 min microwaved increased to 2. 09, 1. 86 % total reduction activity, 4. 49 and 3. 95 H 2 O 2 scavenging activity, respectively. Phenolic acids were identified by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Chlorogenic acid was the most predominant amongst the ten phenolic acids identified in <b>white</b> <b>beans</b> samples. Syringic acid, p-coumaric acid, gallic acid and sinapic acid increased {{with an increase in}} toasting time. Our study has demonstrated that toasted <b>white</b> <b>beans</b> gave the most desirable quality of toasted <b>white</b> <b>beans</b> with respect to phenolic content and radical-scavenging activities...|$|R

2500|$|In 1842, young Texas Rangers Augustus McCrae and Woodrow Call are {{introduced}} quickly and brutally to the rangering life {{on their first}} expedition, {{in which they are}} stalked by the Comanche war chief Buffalo Hump. [...] After a narrow escape, the rangers return to civilization, only to quickly join an expedition to capture and annex Santa Fe, part of New Mexico (the part east of the Rio Grande) for Texas. The expedition, led by pirate and soldier of fortune, Caleb Cobb, is ultimately a failure; of the 200 initial adventurers, only about 40 survive, falling to starvation, bears, and Indians, only to be swiftly arrested by the Mexican authorities. Those survivors are forced to march the Jornada del Muerto ("Dead Man's Walk") to El Paso, and many, Mexican and Texan alike, die along the journey. The Texas contingent is reduced to ten persons when the captives panic after they observe cavalry drilling and are slaughtered in a blood lust as they flee. At their destination, the ten are forced to gamble for their lives by drawing a bean from a jar - a <b>white</b> <b>bean</b> signals life, a black bean death. Call and McCrae are among the five survivors. The last Rangers then return to Texas, escorting an Englishwoman and her son, who have also been held captive by the Mexicans.|$|E
6000|$|Life had its {{zest for}} the old Florentine when he, too, trod the marble steps and shared in those dignities. His {{politics}} had an area as wide as his trade, which stretched from Syria to Britain, but they had also the passionate intensity, and the detailed practical interest, which could belong only to a narrow scene of corporate action; only {{to the members of}} a community shut in close by the hills and by walls of six miles' circuit, where men knew each other as they passed in the street, set their eyes every day on the memorials of their commonwealth, and were conscious of having not simply the right to vote, but the chance of being voted for. He loved his honours and his gains, the business of his counting-house, of his guild, of the public council-chamber; he loved his enmities too, and fingered the <b>white</b> <b>bean</b> which was to keep a hated name out of the borsa with more complacency than {{if it had been a}} golden florin. He loved to strengthen his family by a good alliance, and went home with a triumphant light in his eyes after concluding a satisfactory marriage for his son or daughter under his favourite loggia in the evening cool; he loved his game at chess under that same loggia, and his biting jest, and even his coarse joke, as not beneath the dignity of a man eligible for the highest magistracy. He had gained an insight into all sorts of affairs at home and abroad: he had been of the [...] "Ten" [...] who managed the war department, of the [...] "Eight" [...] who attended to home discipline, of the Priori or Signori who were the heads of the executive government; he had even risen to the supreme office of Gonfaloniere; he had made one in embassies to the Pope and to the Venetians; and he had been commissary to the hired army of the Republic, directing the inglorious bloodless battles in which no man died of brave breast wounds--virtuosi colpi--but only of casual falls and tramplings. And in this way he had learned to distrust men without bitterness; looking on life mainly as a game of skill, but not dead to traditions of heroism and clean-handed honour. For the human soul is hospitable, and will entertain conflicting sentiments and contradictory opinions with much impartiality. It was his pride besides, that he was duly tinctured with the learning of his age, and judged not altogether with the vulgar, but in harmony with the ancients: he, too, in his prime, had been eager for the most correct manuscripts, and had paid many florins for antique vases and for disinterred busts of the ancient immortals--some, perhaps, truncis naribus, wanting as to the nose, but not the less authentic; and in his old age he had made haste to look at the first sheets of that fine Homer which was among the early glories of the Florentine press. But he had not, for all that, neglected to hang up a waxen image or double of himself under the protection of the Madonna Annunziata, or to do penance for his sins in large gifts to the shrines of saints whose lives had not been modelled on the study of the classics; he had not even neglected making liberal bequests towards buildings for the Frati, against whom he had levelled many a jest.|$|E

5000|$|<b>White</b> <b>beans</b> — Great {{northern}} {{beans and}} Navy beans {{are often used}} to make a soup bean dish. This became more common as residents of rural areas began to rely more on store-bought beans and could afford more variety. This dish is typically referred to as [...] "white beans" [...] although it is occasionally called soup beans. Along with the <b>beans,</b> <b>white</b> <b>beans</b> are typically cooked in the juice of a country ham, often with the ham bone or ham included in the dish. As such, this dish is a prized part of holiday meals, when hams are baked. <b>White</b> <b>beans</b> are sometimes cooked with pork fat like brown soup beans, although this is less common. <b>White</b> <b>beans</b> carried an air of sophistication because they were first available in towns to people who could afford more than one type of bean and ham, as opposed to poorer rural people who often raised only brown beans.|$|R
