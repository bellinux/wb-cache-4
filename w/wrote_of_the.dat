With a more efficient compass magnetized by lodestone, the thermoremanence compass fell out of use.

5|$|The term {{rumination}} {{is derived}} from the Latin word ruminare, which means to chew the cud.

5|$|Built between 1117 and 1508, Peterborough Cathedral is {{remarkable}} as the least altered of the Norman cathedrals with only its famous Early English west front, with its later porch and the Perpendicular rebuilding {{of the eastern}} ambulatory by John Wastell being in different styles. J.L. Cartwright <b>wrote</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> west front that it is “as magnificent an entrance to a sacred building as could well be imagined.” The long wooden roof of the nave is original and has retained its painting from 1220.|$|E
5|$|In {{a letter}} dated 12 June 1842 in the Colonial Secretary's Records, Marshall Clifton, Chief Commissioner of the Western Australian Land Company, <b>wrote</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{need for an}} {{improved}} Perth–Fremantle–Bunbury road. On a special trip he took in the previous October {{to look for a}} new route, two surveyors gave their approval to the proposed coastal route, with a ferry across the estuary. Governor John Hutt approved of the idea of a road, but thought a ferry would be impractical, at least during winter, and that the lack of public funds made it impossible. Clifton continued to write letters to the Colonial Secretary advocating the construction of a road.|$|E

5|$|Some {{residents}} claim that, {{independent of}} {{the truth of the}} Mussie legend, the legend's origins are older: supposedly, early settler Samuel de Champlain <b>wrote</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> creature's existence in the early seventeenth century.

5|$|The last {{of these}} {{may have been}} in 217 BC. There were {{earthquakes}} in Italy during that year and the sun was reported as being dimmed by gray haze or dry fog. Plutarch <b>wrote</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sky being on fire near Naples and Silius Italicus mentioned in his epic poem Punica that Vesuvius had thundered and produced flames worthy of Mount Etna in that year, although both authors were writing around 250 years later. Greenland ice core samples of around that period show relatively high acidity, which is assumed to have been caused by atmospheric hydrogen sulfide.|$|E

5|$|The poet Eka Budianta {{notes that}} {{a common theme}} in Soeman's works was the {{strength}} of love {{and its ability to}} overcome obstacles. Soeman <b>wrote</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> power of romance and marriage for love in response to the treatment of women in adat (traditional) culture. Among the Malays of Riau, arranged marriages were common, and women would sometimes be married to men older than their father. Before marriage, young women would be secluded and unable to interact with any men except for the ones chosen to be their husbands. Similarly, Soeman used Kasih Tak Terlarai to criticize the mistreatment of orphans after adoption.|$|E
5|$|Although she {{had long}} broken her formal ties with the British Communist Party, Wilkinson {{retained}} strong links with other communist organisations at home and abroad. Her association with leading communists such as Willi Münzenberg and Otto Katz is revealed in British intelligence files held on her. However, she {{was not prepared to}} risk losing her parliamentary seat, and thus kept her rebellious behaviour within bounds. In 1937 Wilkinson was {{one of a group of}} Labour figures—Aneurin Bevan, Harold Laski and Stafford Cripps were others—who founded the left-wing magazine Tribune; in the first issue she <b>wrote</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> need to fight unemployment, poverty, malnutrition and inadequate housing. Mindful of the dependence of many low-income families on credit, she introduced a bill to regulate hire purchase agreements, at the time a subject of frequent abuse, and with all-party support she secured the passage of the Hire Purchase Act 1938.|$|E
5|$|Although the Greeks and Romans {{did much}} to advance water clock technology, they still {{continued}} to use shadow clocks. The mathematician and astronomer Theodosius of Bithynia, for example, {{is said to have}} invented a universal sundial that was accurate anywhere on Earth, though little is known about it. Others <b>wrote</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sundial in the mathematics and literature of the period. Marcus Vitruvius Pollio, the Roman author of De Architectura, wrote on the mathematics of gnomons, or sundial blades. During the reign of Emperor Augustus, the Romans constructed the largest sundial ever built, the Solarium Augusti. Its gnomon was an obelisk from Heliopolis. Similarly, the obelisk from Campus Martius was used as the gnomon for Augustus's zodiacal sundial. Pliny the Elder records that the first sundial in Rome arrived in 264, looted from Catania, Sicily; according to him, it gave the incorrect time until the markings and angle appropriate for Rome's latitude were used—a century later.|$|E

5|$|As a writer, Sorabji is {{best known}} for his music criticism, the bulk of which is {{contained}} in the books Around Music (1932) and Mi contra fa: The Immoralisings of a Machiavellian Musician (1947). He contributed to various well-known publications dealing with music in England, including The New Age, The New English Weekly, The Musical Times and Musical Opinion. He revised some of those articles and included them in his two books. His writings also devote attention to various non-musical issues: he was, among other things, a critic of British rule in India and a proponent of birth control and legalised abortion. Being homosexual at a time when homosexual acts were illegal in England, he <b>wrote</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> biological and social realities that homosexuals faced during much of his lifetime.|$|E
5|$|Between May 29 and June 2, the Israel Defense Forces {{constantly}} bombarded the Egyptians in Isdud with Napoleonchik cannons and Givati patrols harassed the Egyptian lines. The 51st Battalion was {{tasked with}} laying mines {{along the main}} road near Isdud, Yavne and Hill 69. The 3rd Company of the 53rd Battalion, commanded by Yosef Geva, was tasked with harassing the enemy lines, while the 1st Company of the 54th Battalion, commanded by Aryeh Kotzer, was ordered to assault several targets. In his book In the Fields of Philistia, Uri Avnery, {{who participated in the}} battles, <b>wrote</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> harassment operation that during those days the Egyptians were fearing an Israeli attack and were firing in all directions and launching flares in hopes of discovering their enemy.|$|E
5|$|Chinese geographers such as Jia Dan wrote {{accurate}} {{descriptions of}} places far abroad. In his work written between 785 and 805, {{he described the}} sea route going {{into the mouth of}} the Persian Gulf, and that the medieval Iranians (whom he called the people of Luo-He-Yi) had erected 'ornamental pillars' in the sea that acted as lighthouse beacons for ships that might go astray. Confirming Jia's reports about lighthouses in the Persian Gulf, Arabic writers a century after Jia <b>wrote</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same structures, writers such as al-Mas'udi and al-Muqaddasi. The Tang dynasty Chinese diplomat Wang Xuance traveled to Magadha (modern northeastern India) during the 7th century. Afterwards he wrote the book Zhang Tianzhu Guotu (Illustrated Accounts of Central India), which included a wealth of geographical information.|$|E

5|$|For pharmacology, Shen <b>wrote</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{difficulties}} of adequate diagnosis and therapy, {{as well as}} the proper selection, preparation, and administration of drugs. He held great concern for detail and philological accuracy in identification, use and cultivation of different types of medicinal herbs, such as in which months medicinal plants should be gathered, their exact ripening times, which parts should be used for therapy; for domesticated herbs he wrote about planting times, fertilization, and other matters of horticulture. In the realms of botany, zoology, and mineralogy, Shen Kuo documented and systematically described hundreds of different plants, agricultural crops, rare vegetation, animals, and minerals found in China. For example, Shen noted that the mineral orpiment was used to quickly erase writing errors on paper.|$|E
5|$|Geographers in the Roman Empire such as Ptolemy {{provided}} a rough {{sketch of the}} eastern Indian Ocean, including the Malay Peninsula and beyond this the Gulf of Thailand and South China Sea. Ptolemy's Cattigara was most likely Óc Eo, Vietnam, where Antonine-era Roman items have been found. Ancient Chinese geographers demonstrated a general knowledge of West Asia and Rome's eastern provinces. The 7th-century AD Byzantine historian Theophylact Simocatta <b>wrote</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contemporary reunification of northern and southern China, which he treated as separate nations recently at war. This mirrors both the conquest of Chen by Emperor Wen of Sui (reigned 581–604 AD) {{as well as the}} names Cathay and Mangi used by later medieval Europeans in China during the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty and Han-Chinese Southern Song dynasty.|$|E
5|$|Hinde {{dedicated}} {{a substantial}} amount of time to investigating the Madoc Tradition in North America. Madoc or Madog ab Owain Gwynedd was, according to folklore, a Welsh prince who sailed to America in 1170, more than 300 years before Christopher Columbus's voyage in 1492. Hinde interviewed hundreds of individuals on the topic. In 1824, Hinde wrote a letter to John S. Williams, editor of The American Pioneer regarding the Madoc Tradition. He claimed to have testimony from numerous sources that said Welsh people under Owen Ap Zuinch had come to America in the twelfth century, over 300 years before Christopher Columbus. Hinde claimed that in 1799, the remains of six soldiers had been dug up near Jeffersonville, Indiana with breastplates containing Welsh coats of arms. In 1799, John Sevier, the first governor of Tennessee, also <b>wrote</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> alleged discovery of six skeletons in brass armor bearing Welsh coat-of-arms. Hinde claimed that M'Intosh recounted that American Indians and Welshmen living on the Mississippi River were conversing in Welsh in the late 1700s.|$|E
