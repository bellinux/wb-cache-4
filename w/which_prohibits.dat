An alliance of the House of Saud, and the followers of the Wahhabi movement known as the Emirate of Diriyah, carried out the first demolition. The Sultanate of Nejd, also ruled by the House of Saud and followers of Wahhabism, carried out the second.

By season two, with Whitney's departure, Lana and Clark begin to grow closer. Clark's dishonesty over the secrets he is hiding causes their relationship to end. Lana then grew closer to Lex Luthor. Eventually, Lana learns the truth about Clark and they get back together.

5|$|Tera McArthur asked {{two police}} {{officers}} to accompany her to a trailer home where she lived with her husband Charles, {{so that she could}} take her belongings out of the home. Just after she came out of the trailer, she told the police that Charles McArthur had drugs inside. The police knocked and asked Charles if they could search, which he refused. He then came out of the trailer; an officer prevented him from going back inside while the other policeman rushed to get a warrant. The Illinois Appellate Court held that this action violated the Fourth Amendment, <b>which</b> <b>prohibits</b> unreasonable searches and seizures without a warrant. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to hear the case in 2000.|$|E

5|$|Also in Oregon v. Mitchell, the Supreme Court {{addressed}} {{the constitutionality of}} various other provisions relating to voter qualifications and prerequisites to voting. The Court upheld Section 202, <b>which</b> <b>prohibits</b> any state or local jurisdiction from requiring people to live in their borders for longer than 30 days before allowing them to vote in a presidential election. Additionally, the Court upheld the provision lowering the minimum voting age to 18 in federal elections, but it held that Congress exceeded its power by lowering the voting age to 18 in state elections; this precipitated the ratification of the Twenty-sixth Amendment the following year, which lowered the voting age in all elections to 18. The Court was deeply divided in Oregon v. Mitchell, {{and a majority of}} justices did not agree on a rationale for the holding.|$|E
5|$|Freedom for the Thought That We Hate: A Biography of the First Amendment is a 2007 non-fiction book by {{journalist}} Anthony Lewis {{about freedom}} of speech, {{freedom of the}} press, freedom of thought, and the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. The book starts by quoting the First Amendment, <b>which</b> <b>prohibits</b> the U.S. Congress from creating legislation which limits free speech or freedom of the press. Lewis traces the evolution of civil liberties in the U.S. through key historical events. He {{provides an overview of}} important free speech case law, including U.S. Supreme Court opinions in Schenck v. United States (1919), Whitney v. California (1927), United States v. Schwimmer (1929), New York Times Co. v. Sullivan (1964), and New York Times Co. v. United States (1971).|$|E
5|$|In the United States, common {{starlings}} {{are exempt}} from the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, <b>which</b> <b>prohibits</b> the taking or killing of migratory birds. No permit is required to remove nests and eggs or kill juveniles or adults. Research was undertaken in 1966 to identify a suitable avicide that would both kill common starlings and would readily be eaten by them. It also needed to be of low toxicity to mammals and not likely to cause the death of pets that ate dead birds. The chemical that best fitted these criteria was DRC-1339, now marketed as Starlicide. In 2008, the United States government poisoned, shot or trapped 1.7million birds, {{the largest number of}} any nuisance species to be destroyed. In 2005, the population in the United States was estimated at 140million birds, around 45% of the global total of 310million.|$|E

5|$|Indoor {{residual}} spraying is the spraying of insecticides on {{the walls}} inside a home. After feeding, many mosquitoes rest on a nearby surface while digesting the bloodmeal, so if the walls of houses have been coated with insecticides, the resting mosquitoes can be killed before they can bite another person and transfer the malaria parasite. As of 2006, the World Health Organization recommends 12 insecticides in IRS operations, including DDT and the pyrethroids cyfluthrin and deltamethrin. This public health use of small amounts of DDT is permitted under the Stockholm Convention, <b>which</b> <b>prohibits</b> its agricultural use. One problem with all forms of IRS is insecticide resistance. Mosquitoes affected by IRS tend to rest and live indoors, and due to the irritation caused by spraying, their descendants tend to rest and live outdoors, meaning that they are less affected by the IRS.|$|E
5|$|Predators {{of giant}} mouse lemurs include the Madagascar buzzard, Madagascar owl, fossa, and the narrow-striped mongoose. Giant mouse lemurs {{reproduce}} once a year, with two offspring born after a 90-day gestation. Babies are initially {{left in the}} nest while the mother forages, but are later carried by mouth and parked in vegetation while she forages nearby. In captivity, giant mouse lemurs will breed year-round. Their lifespan in the wild {{is thought to be}} five to six years. Both species are listed as endangered due to habitat destruction and hunting. Like all lemurs, they are protected under CITES Appendix I, <b>which</b> <b>prohibits</b> commercial trade. Despite breeding easily, they are rarely kept in captivity. The Duke Lemur Center coordinated the captive breeding of an imported collection of the northern species, which rose from six individuals in 1982 to 62individuals by 1989, but the population fell to six by 2009 and was no longer considered a breeding population.|$|E

The Constitution declares that religious groups have the right to establish and maintain institutions for the education of children and to provide them religious instruction in those institutions, but provides that people cannot be discriminated against on the ground only of religion in laws relating to such institutions or the administration of such laws. Furthermore, no person may be compelled to receive instruction in or take part in any ceremony or act of worship of a religion apart from his or her own.|$|E
