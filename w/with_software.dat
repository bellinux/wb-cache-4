5|$|From Spring 2007 to 2008 the {{messages}} were handled by a Ruby persistent queue server called Starling, but since 2009 implementation has been gradually replaced <b>with</b> <b>software</b> written in Scala. The switch from Ruby to Scala and the JVM has given Twitter a performance boost from 200–300 requests per second per host to around 10,000–20,000 requests per second per host. This boost {{was greater than}} the 10x improvement that Twitter's engineers envisioned when starting the switch. The continued development of Twitter has also involved a switch from monolithic development of a single app to an architecture where different services are built independently and joined through remote procedure calls.|$|E
