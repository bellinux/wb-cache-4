5000|$|Sour <b>water</b> <b>stripper</b> unit: Uses {{steam to}} remove {{hydrogen}} sulfide gas from various wastewater streams for subsequent conversion into end-product sulfur in the Claus unit.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} {{the process}} can handle other sulfurous waste streams. This is highly interesting in refineries, where e.g. hydrogen sulfide (H2S) gas, sour <b>water</b> <b>stripper</b> gas and Claus tail gas can be led to the SNOX plant, and thereby investment in other waste gas handling facilities can be saved.|$|E
50|$|Gases {{containing}} ammonia, {{such as the}} {{gas from}} the refinery's sour <b>water</b> <b>stripper</b> (SWS), or hydrocarbons are converted in the burner muffle. Sufficient air is injected into the muffle for the complete combustion of all hydrocarbons and ammonia. The air to the acid gas ratio is controlled such that in total 1/3 of all hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is converted to SO2. This ensures a stoichiometric reaction for the Claus reaction in the second catalytic step (see next section below).|$|E
50|$|The book {{is notable}} {{for being the}} first {{technical}} publication of a method for the rigorous tray-by-tray design of steam distillation towers for removing hydrogen sulfide from oil refinery wastewaters. Such towers are {{commonly referred to as}} sour <b>water</b> <b>strippers.</b> The design method was also presented at a World Petroleum Congress Meeting shortly after the book was published.|$|R
40|$|This work {{develops}} a design and operation support tool for an Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) power plant, {{which allows the}} efficiency and environmental issues of alternative process designs and feedstock to be assessed. The study {{is based on a}} conceptual model of an IGCC plant, validated with data from the ELCOGAS power plant in Spain. The layout of the model includes an Air Separation Unit (ASU), a Pressurized Entrained Flow (PRENFLO) gasifier, a series of purification gas units (venturi scrubber, sour <b>water</b> steam <b>stripper,</b> COS hydrolysis reactor, MDEA absorber columns and a sulphur recovery Claus plant), a Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG) and a Combined Cycle (CC) system. It comprises steady state models. One of the purposes of this work is to analyze the feasibility of coal co-gasification using waste materials; specifically petcoke and olive pomace (orujillo) are considered here. The model has been developed in Aspen Hysys. It uses electrolyte models that have been implemented in Aspen Plus which are connected to Aspen Hysys bymeans of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) models. Results of the model’s, gas composition and generated power, are in agreement with the industrial data. Peer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|R
50|$|Water testing began {{detecting}} {{concentrations of}} vinyl chloride, a known carcinogen, {{in the communities}} well water in 2009. The Village {{took one of the}} three wells it has off line as concentration levels continued to rise. With the Village stuck in political grid lock and a legal battle with the State of Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, by 2012 the Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan stepped in and forced the Village to provide bottled water to the residents until a temporary air strippers were installed to remove the vinyl choloride from the well water. By August, 2012 the State of Illinois installed temporary air strippers and the village discontinued providing bottled <b>water.</b> Permanent Air <b>Strippers</b> were on the drawing board in 2012 and construction finally became a reality as the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency approved a low-interest loan of $4.8 million for the village. Construction on the permanent air strippers got under way by spring of 2014 and is expected to be complete by fall, 2014.|$|R
40|$|In oil {{refining}} industries {{there is a}} high water consumption, which influences the high production costs and impacts the environment due to the discharge of their wastes. It is known that there are no technological conditions for the reuse of industrial water at the oil refineries, based on hydroskimming processes. The objective {{of this study is to}} implement the process integration methodology, Water Pinch, to a sour <b>water</b> <b>stripper</b> unit, as a unitary process of an oil refinery, to minimize the amount of sulphurous waste water and reduce contamination of the bay that receives these wastes. The technology is applied to evaluate the volume of sulphurous wastewater generated in the Cienfuegos oil refinery. This technology allows identifying opportunities for recovery and reuse of water, based on concentration ranges of contaminants. To achieve this purpose, a sour <b>water</b> <b>stripper</b> tower was assessed with the help of Water Pinch software, which provided an optimized distribution network, as a proposed technological improvement. This facilitated to recover and reuse 667 757, 28 m 3 of water per year, and 1 035 023, 78 CUC were saved, at the same time the amount of polluting effluents decreased in approximately 2 % of non-reusable treated water...|$|E
40|$|Allergan {{constructed}} and is operating a unique biological {{system designed to}} reduce emissions of isopropyl alcohol (IPA) as well as acetone and heptane from intaocular lens manufacturing operations. The exhaust gases from the manufacturing facility are passed through a pair of wet scrubbers, in series, that allow mass transfer of the IPA from air to water. The original design called for packed towers {{to be used to}} partially biochemically oxidize the emissions. This design was changed after three months, due to fouling problems, to simply a <b>water</b> <b>stripper</b> mode of operation. Then, the water stream is passed through a fixed film bioreactor to reduce the final concentration of IPA and other emissions to less than 99 % of the total inlet concentration. The inlet concentrations treated by the system ranged from 200 to 500 mg/m 3 at a flow rate of 5000 cfm. On average, the system treated approximately 12 gallons per day of IPA and lesser amounts of acetone and heptane. The system is a closed system and only requires the addition of bacteria and nutrients on a periodic basis. Sludge is removed periodically. The system was started on May 18, 1997 and went through a startup validation which was completed in December of 1997. The operational data is presented along with the method of startup and methods to overcome adverse operating conditions. The system from two weeks after startup has maintained an IPA removal efficiency of greater than 99 %. Nutrient loading and pH adjustment have been fine tuned during the startup validation period. The system has proved to be as economical as first described in a previous paper as compared to other control devices such as catalytic thermal oxidation...|$|E
40|$|The Natref Oil Refinery in Sasolburg, South Africa, {{experienced}} refractory {{problems in}} the combustion chamber of the Sulphur Recovery Unit (SRU) since start-up (Figure 1). Even though the SRU was at all times operated within the temperature range of 1250 - 1750 °C (as measured on the original thermocouples and the pyrometer), they experienced refractory failures, {{which can only be}} accounted for by temperatures in excess of 1850 °C. It was concluded that the available temperature indication was not an accurate reflection of the actual temperature in the combustion chamber. Three new sets of temperature measurement were installed in order to better understand the temperature profile in the combustion chamber (each set consists of two thermocouples and one pyrometer). Furthermore, An ASPEN-based simulation was used to set up a neural network to predict the combustion chamber temperature based on three input variables, namely the oxygen enrichment level, the ratio of sour <b>water</b> <b>stripper</b> offgas to acid gas, as well as the amount of acid gas bypassed to the second chamber of the reaction furnace. The reaction furnace was found to be operated at an average temperature of 1400 °C during normal operation. This temperature is substantially higher than the normal recommended 1250 °C for Claus combustion chambers. The neural network was connected to the Natref DCS and successfully proved that during the start-up of the SRU in 2006 a temperature in excess of 2000 °C was reached inside the combustion chamber, explaining the refractory failure and subsequent shutdown of the unit. In order to establish which temperature measurement should be used for control purposes during normal operation, the 9 temperature measurements over the length of the combustion chamber were compared to the neural network temperatures. All the other thermocouples (T 1 - T 6) were found to underpredict the ASPEN simulated temperature. Furthermore, the response of these thermocouples was much slower than that of the pyrometers. With the exception of the burner box pyrometer, P 1, all the pyrometers also underpredicted the ASPEN simulated temperature. The response of the pyrometers was, however, much faster and showed the strongest linear correlation with regards to the adiabatic flame temperature. The reason for the underprediction can be ascribed to heat losses in the combustion chamber. The middle pyrometer, P 2, gave the smallest deviation between measured and predicted temperature values of only 28 °C on average and should be used as the main control point with regards to temperature.

30|$|The Si MRR {{devices in}} this study were {{fabricated}} in a commercial Si foundry (CEA-LETI, France) and comprise of strip-waveguides of 335 -nm width, lithographically formed from commercial 220 -nm silicon-on-insulator with a 2 -μm-thick buried oxide layer. These waveguide dimensions, specifically, the relatively narrow waveguide width (compared with typical strip-waveguides), were selected to ensure good modal overlap with surface integrated graphene, post-transfer. Two ‘racetrack’-type MRR devices are studied, one in which the radial component is 10  μm and the other is 20  μm and both having identical 20 -μm-long linear sections. Prior to graphene transfer, the devices were washed with acetone, isopropyl alcohol (IPA), de-ionized <b>water</b> and resist <b>stripper</b> (NMP: 1 -methyl- 2 -pyrrolidone). This was followed by an oxygen plasma etch (for 40  s) immediately before transfer. The graphene was grown by chemical vapour deposition (CVD) on copper foils (Gratome-R-Cu, Bluestone Global Tech) and then transferred onto the pre-cleaned waveguides using a polymer-mediated wet transfer procedure [21]. The graphene was patterned, to ensure selective coverage of the MRR devices, using raster scan photolithography and oxygen plasma etching. In order to ensure as clean a sample as possible, a subsequent annealing treatment at 270  °C in a reducing atmosphere and acetone wash was applied leading to near complete removal of residual photoresist, as revealed by our optical images.|$|R
