5|$|Although English is {{the common}} {{language}} of Westeros, the producers charged linguist David J. Peterson with constructing Dothraki and Valyrian languages based on the few <b>words</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> novels; Dothraki and Valyrian dialogue is often subtitled in English. It {{has been reported that}} during the series these fictional languages have been heard by more people than the Welsh, Irish, and Scots Gaelic languages combined.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally, an individual's tissues are {{resistant}} {{to the effects of}} parathyroid hormone. This is known as pseudohypoparathyroidism. In this case the parathyroid glands are fully functional, and the hormone itself is not able to function, resulting in a decrease in blood calcium levels. Pseudohypoparathyroidism is often associated with the genetic condition Albright's hereditary osteodystrophy. Pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism, one of the longest <b>words</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> English language, is used to describe an individual with Albright's hereditary osteodystrophy; with normal parathyroid hormone and serum calcium levels.|$|E

Taken as a group the Ottawa set is distinctive. The following chart shows the demonstrative pronouns for: (a) Wikwemikong, an Ottawa community; (b) Curve Lake, an Eastern Ojibwe community; and (c) Cape Croker, an Ottawa community that uses a mixed pronoun set. The terms maaba 'this (animate)', gonda 'these (animate)', and nonda 'these (inanimate)' are unique to Ottawa.|$|E

5|$|The core game {{is based}} on Hangman. Each round has a {{category}} and a blank word puzzle, with each blank representing a letter in the answer, and punctuation revealed as needed. Most puzzles are straightforward figures of speech that fit within a mostly static list of categories, and this list has evolved {{over the course of}} the series. Crossword puzzles were added to the rotation in 2016. In such rounds, a clue bonding the <b>words</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> puzzle is given instead of a traditional category, and contestants win by solving all the <b>words</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> crossword. The titular Wheel of Fortune is a roulette-style wheel mechanism with 24 spaces, most of which are labeled with dollar amounts ranging from $500 to $900, plus a top dollar value: $2,500 in round 1, $3,500 in rounds 2 and 3, and $5,000 for round 4 and any subsequent rounds. The wheel also features two Bankrupt wedges and one Lose a Turn, both of which forfeit the contestant's turn, with the former also eliminating any cash or prizes the contestant has accumulated within the round. Each game features three contestants, or occasionally, three two-contestant teams positioned behind a single scoreboard with its own flipper. The left scoreboard from the viewer's perspective is colored red, the center yellow, and the right blue, with the contestants' positions determined by a random selection prior to taping.|$|E
5|$|During World War II Fleming had {{mentioned}} to friends {{that he wanted}} to write a spy novel, {{but it was not until}} 17 February 1952 that he began to write his first novel, Casino Royale. He started writing his book at his Jamaican home Goldeneye, typing out 2,000 <b>words</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning, directly from his own experiences and imagination; he finished work on the manuscript in just over two months, completing it on 18 March 1952. Publishers Jonathan Cape were initially reluctant to publish the book, but were persuaded by Fleming's brother Peter (1907–1971), who had previously published material through them. On 13 April 1953 Casino Royale was released in the UK in hardcover, priced at 10s, 6d, with a cover that had been devised by Fleming himself. The first edition of 4,728 copies of Casino Royale sold out in less than a month; a second print run the same month also sold out, as did a third run of more than 8,000 books published in May 1954. At the time, Fleming was the Foreign Manager for Kemsley Newspapers, an organisation which owned The Sunday Times. Upon accepting the job, Fleming requested that he be allowed three months holiday per year, which allowed him the freedom to write.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} year, he {{identified}} the hieroglyphic script on the Rosetta stone as being {{written in a}} mixture of ideograms and phonetic signs, just as Young had argued for Demotic. He reasoned that if the script was entirely ideographic the hieroglyphic text would require as many separate signs as there were separate <b>words</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Greek text. But there were in fact fewer, suggesting that the script mixed ideographic and phonetic signs. This realization finally made it possible for him to detach himself from the idea that the different scripts had to be either fully ideographic or fully phonetic, and he recognized it as being much more complex mixture of sign types. This realization gave him a distinct advantage.|$|E

5|$|Jonathan Nolan {{designed}} the film's official website. As with the marketing strategy of The Blair Witch Project, the website {{was intended to}} provide further clues and hints to the story, while not providing any concrete information. After a short intro on the website, the viewer is shown a newspaper clipping detailing Leonard's murder of Teddy. Clicking on highlighted <b>words</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> article leads to more material describing the film, including Leonard's notes and photographs as well as police reports. The filmmakers employed another tactic by sending out Polaroid pictures to random people, depicting a bloody and shirtless Leonard pointing at an unmarked spot on his chest. Since Newmarket distributed the film themselves, Christopher Nolan edited the film's trailers himself. Sold to inexpensive cable-TV channels like Bravo and A, and websites such as Yahoo and MSN, the trailers were key to the film gaining widespread public notice.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Krabs {{is about}} to give SpongeBob and Patrick the job, but he hits his foot on a rock, {{dropping}} the paint and says all 13 swear words while complaining about his foot being injured. When SpongeBob and Patrick hear all the swear words, they run to Mama Krabs' house to tattle on him. When they all reach her house, they all explain what happened at once, saying the same swear <b>words</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> process. This makes her faint, but shortly after Mr. Krabs scolds SpongeBob and Patrick for saying all those bad words {{in front of her}} she regains consciousness. Mama Krabs states that all three of them should be ashamed for saying all those words. She then gives all three of them the task of painting her house with a fresh coat of paint as punishment. Later on, she leaves the three alarmed when she appears to be saying a 14th swear word after stubbing her toe on a rock; she claims that the sound came from Old Man Jenkins, who is driving by in his jalopy, which produces an identical sound and everyone laughs.|$|E
5|$|The letter, {{which is}} a {{response}} to Boniface who had requested his support, reveals Ælfwald's sound understanding of Latin. Ælfwald's letter reassures Boniface that his name was being remembered by the East Angles: it contains an offer to exchange the names of their dead, so that mutual prayers could be read for them. According to Richard Hoggett, a phrase in the letter, 'in septenis monasteriorum nostorum sinaxis', has been interpreted incorrectly by historians to imply that there were at the time seven monasteries in Ælfwald's kingdom in which prayers were being read, a theory which has proved difficult for scholars to explain. Hoggett argues that the <b>words</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> phrase refer to the number of times that the monks offered praise during the monastic day and not to the number of monasteries then in existence. He points out that this interpretation was published by Haddan and Stubbs as long ago as 1869.|$|E

5|$|There are two <b>words</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Marquesan {{language}} for dog: peto, {{used in the}} Northern Marquesas, and nuhe, used in the Southern Marquesas. The former {{might have been an}} English loanword from pet or a Spanish loanword from perro (dog), although pero was an alternative for dog (kurī) in the related Māori language. According to another theory supporting its foreign origin, the name came from a New Haven dog named Pato left on Nuku Hiva by the American sea captain Edmund Fanning from 1798 to 1803. The South Marquesan Nuhe is unique in the Polynesian languages, but may have some connection to wanuhe, the word for dog in the Papuan language of the Brumer Islands. French Catholic missionary René-Ildefonse Dordillon listed two other forms: mohoʻio and mohokio in his 1904 dictionary Grammaire et dictionnaire de la langue des iles Marquises.|$|E
5|$|Matangi {{represents}} {{the power of}} the spoken word (Vaikhari) as an expression of thoughts and the mind. She also relates to the power of listening and grasping speech and converting it back to knowledge and thought. Besides spoken word, she also governs all other expressions of inner thought and knowledge, like art, music and dance. Matangi presides over the middle part of speech (Madhyama), where ideas are translated into the spoken word and in her highest role, represents Para-Vaikhari—the Supreme Word manifested through speech and that encompasses knowledge of the scriptures. She is described as the goddess of learning and speech, and the bestower of knowledge and talent. She is also called Mantrini, the mistress of the sacred mantras. She also {{represents the}} word of a guru, who serves as a spiritual guide. Matangi is described as dwelling in the Throat chakra—the origin of speech—and on the tip of the tongue. She is also associated with a channel called Sarasvati from the third eye to the tip of the tongue. According to David Frawley, her description as impure refers {{to the nature of the}} spoken word, which labels things and stereotypes them, thereby hindering actual contact with the soul of things. The goddess is described as one who helps a person to use <b>words</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> right way and to go beyond it to seek the soul and inner knowledge, which lie outside the demarcated boundaries of tradition.|$|E
