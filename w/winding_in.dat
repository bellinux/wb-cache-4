At the intersection with Township Road 406, State Route 664 starts <b>winding</b> <b>in</b> several directions, but following a northward basis. This continues until the intersection with Arbutus Drive, where it heads {{straight to the}} northwest. At a clearing in a nearby forest, State Route 664 enters the community of Swissdale. The stay in the community is short, with the highway leaving after a few blocks. Just north of Swissdale, State Route 664 makes a long hairpin turn, curving {{from east to west}} before turning north once again. Just after the intersection with Honey Suckle Lane, State Route 664 progresses towards Haneyville.|$|E
25|$|Eventually the {{technique}} of neutralization was developed whereby the RF transformer connected to the plate (anode) would include an additional <b>winding</b> <b>in</b> the opposite phase. This winding would be connected back to the grid through a small capacitor, and when properly adjusted would cancel the Miller capacitance. This technique was employed {{and led to the}} success of the Neutrodyne radio during the 1920s.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Wind</b> <b>in</b> the Willows is a TV {{series that}} was {{originally}} broadcast between 1984 and 1987, based on characters from Kenneth Grahame's classic story The <b>Wind</b> <b>in</b> the Willows {{and following the}} 1983 film The <b>Wind</b> <b>in</b> the Willows. It was made by animation company Cosgrove Hall for Thames Television and shown on the ITV network. An hour-long feature, A Tale Of Two Toads, was broadcast in 1989, and a fifth season of 13 episodes was shown in 1990 under the title Oh! Mr Toad in some countries, whilst retaining the title The <b>Wind</b> <b>in</b> the Willows in others.|$|R
500|$|The {{digestive}} tract of typical bivalves {{consists of an}} oesophagus, stomach, and intestine. A number of digestive glands open into the stomach, often via a pair of diverticula; these secrete enzymes to digest food in the stomach, but also include cells that phagocytose food particles, and digest them intracellularly. In filter-feeding bivalves, an elongated rod of solidified mucus {{referred to as the}} [...] "crystalline style" [...] projects into the stomach from an associated sac. Cilia in the sac cause the style to rotate, <b>winding</b> <b>in</b> a stream of food-containing mucus from the mouth, and churning the stomach contents. This constant motion propels food particles into a sorting region {{at the rear of the}} stomach, which distributes smaller particles into the digestive glands, and heavier particles into the intestine. Waste material is consolidated in the rectum and voided as pellets into the exhalent water stream through an anal pore. Feeding and digestion are synchronized with diurnal and tidal cycles.|$|E

2500|$|The RF {{induction}} coils {{function in}} a manner similar to the primary <b>winding</b> <b>in</b> a transformer. The zirconia acts as the [...] "secondary winding" [...] of a transformer which in effect is [...] "shorted" [...] out and thus gets hot. This heating method requires the introduction of small pieces of zirconium metal. The metal is placed near the outside of the charge and is melted by the RF coils and heats the surrounding zirconia powder from the outside inwards. The cooling water-filled pipes embracing the outer surface maintain a thin [...] "skin" [...] (1–2mm) of unmelted feed, creating a self-contained apparatus. After several hours the temperature is reduced in a controlled and gradual manner, resulting in the formation of flawless columnar crystals that are typically about 5cm long by 2.5cm wide, although they may be grown much larger. Prolonged annealing at 1400°C is then carried out to remove any strain. The annealed crystals are then cut into gemstones.|$|E

2500|$|Fowler's {{ploughing}} engine dragged itself {{across the}} field on rollers, pulling the mole plough as it went. [...] The engine was driven {{by a team of}} horses that walked round a capstan, <b>winding</b> <b>in</b> a rope which was passed through a pulley securely anchored {{at the far end of}} the field. The mole would have a string of drainage pipes attached at the rear end and these would be dragged through the channel created by the mole. On completing each length of drains, the engine would be turned, the rope would be let out and the pulley repositioned ready for the next length. Fowler had trouble with the capstan gears and with the rope slipping on the capstan, but was able to demonstrate his engine at a meeting of the Royal Agricultural Society of England at Exeter in 1850. He was able to lay a drain at a depth of [...] in heavy clay. His invention was awarded a silver medal and was reported as [...] "altogether the most important feature of the exhibition." ...|$|E
