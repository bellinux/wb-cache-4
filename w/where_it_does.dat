25|$|The gut is an endoderm-derived structure. At {{approximately}} the sixteenth day of human development, the embryo begins to fold ventrally (with the embryo's ventral surface becoming concave) in two directions: {{the sides of}} the embryo fold in on each other and the head and tail fold toward one another. The result is that a piece of the yolk sac, an endoderm-lined structure in contact with the ventral aspect of the embryo, begins to be pinched off to become the primitive gut. The yolk sac remains connected to the gut tube via the vitelline duct. Usually this structure regresses during development; in cases <b>where</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not, it is known as Meckel's diverticulum.|$|E

As of 2012, the New Zealand company BioVittoria provides more than 90 percent of the global supply of monk fruit extract; its main manufacturing facility for the product is in Guilin, China.|$|E

25|$|Organs of {{exquisite}} {{tone and}} ornate appearance have {{become one of}} the outstanding features of motion picture houses and the management of Marion's new playhouse invested a huge sum in obtaining one of the best on the market. The organ is custom made being designed especially for the Marion theater. The size of the building and its acoustic properties were taken into consideration before any work was done on the musical instrument. Every bit of material going into the construction of the organ was carefully selected coming from many lands. Many weeks of work were necessary before the instrument was completed and ready to install. The heart of the organ rests in the switchboard. Keys operate silver and bronze contacts making instantaneous connections with the pipes and other effects. The pipes are cleverly concealed {{on each side of the}} stage, the opening forming double windows leading to balconies of two Spanish towers. The chambers form a natural part of the architecture of the interior. The console is the only part of the huge organ visible. It rests on a platform that can be raised and lowered bringing the console up to a point where it can be viewed to a great advantage all over the house or lowered to a point <b>where</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not interfere with the view of the stage. The elevator is controlled by a motor located in a soundproof room back of the stage. The console itself is known as the Page Rainbo Gold deriving its name from the finish. It is heavily scrolled and so finished that lights are reflected in a very effective fashion.|$|E
500|$|Despite Fraser's recommendations, the Citizens' Committee {{stayed with}} Mora, who quickly {{turned out the}} {{finished}} sketches. Anthony Swiatek and Walter Breen, in their volume on U.S. commemorative coins, suggested that the Citizens' Committee did not hire Beach or Aitken {{due to lack of}} time and an unwillingness to pay their large fees. The finished models were sent to the Philadelphia Mint on June 17, and were forwarded to the Commission. By this time, Fraser was no longer a member of the Commission and they were sent to Lorado Taft, along with a note that the Citizens' Committee had not hired Aitken due to the expense and that the new designs were little better than the old. However, both Taft and another member, Louis Ayres, recommended acceptance. Ayres did suggest [...] "that 'In God We Trust' be placed in some position <b>where</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not seem as if the '49ers were frying it in oil". Numismatic historian Don Taxay averred that this advice was not followed {{due to the lack of}} an alternative position in which to place the motto.|$|E
500|$|All {{characters}} {{are designed to}} speak with their own internal voices to capture their views of the world. The Atlantic pondered whether Martin ultimately intended the readers to sympathize with characters {{on both sides of}} the Lannister–Stark feud long before plot developments force them to make their emotional choices. Contrary to most conventional epic fantasies, the Ice and Fire {{characters are}} vulnerable so that, according to The Atlantic, the reader [...] "cannot be sure that good shall triumph, which makes those instances <b>where</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> all the more exulting." [...] Martin gets emotionally involved in the characters' lives during writing, which makes the chapters with dreadful events sometimes very difficult to write. Seeing the world through the characters' eyes requires a certain amount of empathy with them, including the villains, all of whom he has said he loves as if they were his own children. Martin found that some characters had minds of their own and took his writing in different directions. He returns to the intended story if it does not work out, but these detours sometimes prove more rewarding for him.|$|E

500|$|Geoffrey Marshall has characterised section 3 as a [...] "deeply mysterious provision" [...] {{in several}} respects, {{including}} judging how strong a provision it is [...] an issue since {{dealt with by}} the courts [...] but has also noted a disparity between what the Act {{might be expected to}} do and what it does. He argues that a litigant would hope that courts would strive to uphold his rights under the Convention, accepting a derivation from them only rarely; instead section 3 requires courts to find compatibility with the Convention where possible [...] in other words, to strive to find that the Convention does not impact the claimant. Alison L. Young has examined the upper boundaries to courts' powers of interpretation. She puts forward three possible limits: firstly, where the text of a statute is not ambiguous; secondly, where reading in words is inappropriate; and, thirdly, where any interpretation is restricted to cases <b>where</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not involve implied repeal. Young dismisses the first two as incompatible with the legislative history (and, in at least the first case, judicial history) and believes the third to present no rigid limit on courts' powers at all. The decision of Pepper v Hart provides a method for the legislative history of a bill {{to play a role in}} its interpretation.|$|E
500|$|In Cameroon, the {{grey-necked rockfowl}} is {{respected}} by {{the indigenous peoples}} and, in some cases, even feared. It is known by many names to the indigenous peoples of Nigeria, {{with most of the}} translating to [...] "bird of the rocks" [...] or [...] "fowl of the stream". Hunters sheltering in the rockfowl's nesting caves have been known to kill and eat adult rockfowl, though it is generally thought to be too small to eat and is left for children to hunt. In the 1950s and 1960s, western zoos desired this species, leading to a large demand to collect the rockfowl for display. British conservationist and author Gerald Durrell made this species a target on two of his trips to Cameroon, which he describes in The Bafut Beagles and A Zoo in My Luggage. The trade of this species is non-existent today, and, as the zoo population did not sustain itself despite sporadic breeding, the last captive rockfowl died at the Frankfurt Zoo in 2009. The grey-necked rockfowl has been depicted on numerous postage stamps from Cameroon and Nigeria, as well as stamps from Benin and Togo, <b>where</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not live. It {{is considered one of the}} most difficult species of bird to see in the wild. The grey-necked rockfowl is a symbol for both conservation and ecotourism efforts in its range. This species is considered one of the five most desirable birds in Africa by ornithologists.|$|E
500|$|Kindler wrote both {{parts of}} [...] "Sanctuary for All", as well [...] "Fata Morgana", [...] "Kush", [...] "The Five", [...] "Requiem", [...] "Instinct", {{and the second}} part of [...] "Revelations". He penned his scripts quickly, with [...] "Kush" [...] being written in three and a half days. Wood contributed to the story of [...] "Fata Morgana" [...] by {{bringing}} up the idea of incorporating the Morrígan from Irish mythology, which would start giving the season an ancient and mythological feel. [...] "Kush" [...] introduces a series of episodes involving the working relationship between Will and Magnus. [...] "The Five" [...] became {{a significant part of the}} series mythology, revealing the Five, which Magnus is a part of, how Magnus got her longevity, and that Henry Foss is actually part werewolf. Tapping believed that introducing the Five was a [...] "cool concept". Kindler introduced vampires in the episode, and felt it would be best to introduce them as a dead species. He also felt that including real-life historic figures such as Tesla was a [...] "very ballsy thing". In [...] "Requiem", Kindler wanted a scenario in which Will has to make a difficult decision to deal with Magnus when she becomes the threat of the episode. Though Kindler at first believed it was not a good episode, it ended up as a highlight of the season according to the producers. In writing [...] "Instinct", Kindler, inspired by Cloverfield, wanted to show the audience the protagonists hunting an abnormal in real-time, <b>where</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not always go according to plan.|$|E
