5|$|In Europe, British Airways, Iberia, and Icelandair {{were the}} 757's largest {{mainline}} customers, while other carriers such as Lufthansa rejected the type as {{too large for}} their narrow-body aircraft needs. Many European charter airlines, including Air 2000, Air Holland, and LTU International, also acquired the twinjet for holiday and tour package flights in the late 1980s. In Asia, where even larger aircraft were commonly preferred because of greater passenger volumes, the 757 found fewer orders. A 1982 sales demonstration was unable to attract a purchase from potential customer Japan Airlines, and the first Asian customer, Singapore Airlines, sold its four 757s in 1989 in favor of standardizing on the 240-seat <b>wide-body</b> <b>Airbus</b> A310, just five years after debuting the type on Indonesian and Malaysian routes. The 757 fared better in China, where following an initial purchase by the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) in 1987, orders grew to 59 aircraft, making it the largest Asian market. Operators such as China Southern, China Southwest, Shanghai Airlines, Xiamen Airlines, and Xinjiang Airlines used the 757 on medium length domestic routes.|$|E
5000|$|Today, Sabena {{technics}} has all {{the necessary}} skills and agreements to perform maintenance on a large range of narrow and <b>wide-body</b> aircraft (<b>Airbus,</b> Boeing, Bombardier, Embraer, ATR,…) and has developed a very specific skill to perform maintenance in operational condition on different countries’ fleets, representing today 40% of its activity.|$|R
2500|$|LD3s, LD6s, and LD11s {{will fit}} 787s, 777s, 747s, MD-11s, Il-86s, Il-96s, L-1011s and all <b>Airbus</b> <b>wide-bodies.</b> The 767 uses the smaller LD2s and LD8s {{because of its}} {{narrower}} fuselage. The less common LD1 is designed specifically for the 747, but LD3s are more commonly used in its place because of ubiquity (they have the same floor dimensions such that one LD3 {{takes the place of}} one LD1). LD3s with reduced height ( [...] instead of [...] ) can also be loaded on the Airbus A320 family. LD7 pallets will fit 787s, 777s, 747s, late model 767s (with the big door), and <b>Airbus</b> <b>wide-bodies.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Polyacrylonitrile {{is used as}} the {{precursor}} for 90% of carbon fiber production. [...] Approximately 20-25% of Boeing and <b>Airbus</b> <b>wide-body</b> airframes are carbon fibers. However, applications are limited by PAN's high price of around $15/lb.|$|R

50|$|Several {{different}} types of aircraft were examined for potential use, including the Antonov An-124, Antonov An-225, Ilyushin Il-86, Boeing 747, Boeing 767, Lockheed C-5 Galaxy, and McDonnell Douglas C-17 Globemaster III; {{the use of any}} existing aircraft was eventually discounted {{due to a lack of}} internal space to accommodate the desired components, the use of a piggyback arrangement was also dismissed as impractical. Boeing made their own offer to convert several Boeing 767s for the requirement, but this was viewed as inferior to developing a purpose-built aircraft using Airbus' existing <b>wide-body</b> twin-engined <b>Airbus</b> A300-600R instead.|$|R
500|$|On 19 July 2013, Airbus {{delivered}} the 1000th A330 to Cathay Pacific. It {{is the first}} <b>Airbus</b> <b>wide-body</b> airliner to reach 1,000 deliveries, and the fourth wide-body to achieve the milestone after the Boeing 747, 767 and 777. [...] As of September 2017, a total of 1,482 A330ceos had been ordered, with 1,368 delivered.|$|R
50|$|SLAF Hingurakgoda is the fourth-largest {{airport in}} Sri Lanka {{and has the}} fourth-longest runway in Sri Lanka. The runway can easily {{accommodate}} narrow-body aircraft like Airbus A320 family, Boeing 737 and Boeing 757. It can also tightly handle <b>wide-body</b> aircraft like <b>Airbus</b> A300, Airbus A330, Boeing 767, Boeing 777 or even at emergencies a Boeing 747.|$|R
50|$|On November 20, 2014, Delta ordered 50 <b>Airbus</b> <b>wide-body</b> jets {{to replace}} its aging Boeing 747-400s and 767-300ERs. 25 A350-900 {{aircraft}} {{will be delivered}} beginning in 2017 and will replace Delta's Boeing 747-400s on routes to Asia. 25 Airbus A330-900neo aircraft will be delivered beginning in 2019 and will replace 767-300ERs on routes to Europe and on certain routes between the West Coast and Asia.|$|R
25|$|Once the non-Schengen {{expansion}} is finished, the airport {{will have an}} opportunity to accommodate the largest <b>wide-body</b> aircraft; the <b>Airbus</b> A380. This would fix the issue today where Norwegians are traveling to other international airports for connecting flights {{to the rest of the}} world, because OSL is too small for handling a long-haul international network. Another phase will be added later on to bring the total capacity to 35 million passengers annually through the T2-project.|$|R
5000|$|The airline was {{established}} in 1995 with a fleet of a sole Boeing 737-300. The next year more 737s were incorporated. In 1997 was incorporated the first <b>wide-body</b> aircraft, an <b>Airbus</b> A300 for regional routes and to middle of year was incorporated Douglas DC-10 for flights to US, Canada and Spain. In 1998, the airline had a debt of US$60,000, and due to their incapability for pay the debt, the airline ceased operations. Airline code IATA was DGO ...|$|R
25|$|On Boxing Day 1980 – 26 December – {{the last}} South African Airways Boeing 707 service was {{operated}} between Paris and Johannesburg. Its touchdown ended the 20-year career of the 707. The quadjet {{was replaced by}} the world's first <b>wide-body</b> twinjet, the <b>Airbus</b> A300, which had entered revenue service in 1976. The 727s were eliminated by 1983, replaced by the more economical Boeing 737. When countries withdrew landing rights for SAA, the airline leased its aircraft and crews to Canada, Mauritius, Brazil and Morocco.|$|R
50|$|There are {{a number}} of flights serving the routes from and to Minangkabau International Airport, similar to the former Tabing Airport. These routes help to connect Padang to Jakarta, Medan, Batam and Pekanbaru domestically; whereas {{international}} routes connect it to Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia. Currently there are six national airlines and one foreign airlines operating at Minangkabau International Airport. The Airport can accommodate <b>wide-body</b> aircraft like <b>Airbus</b> A330, Boeing 747-400, or Boeing 777 and upon completion of the all the facilities in the future, it would have better facilities for passengers and operators as compared with the former Tabing Airport.|$|R
5000|$|Due to {{a rather}} rapid {{increase}} in passenger numbers recently, the airport has already exceeded its original capacity limit of 17 million passengers and passed critical limit of 20 million in 2011. [...] As a result, the Norwegian Air Transport Authority Avinor approved plans on 19 January 2011 for an expansion of OSL with Terminal 2. Finished in Spring 2017, the expansion involved {{construction of a new}} pier located directly after security checkpoint with eleven new air bridges, six remote stands, a new arrivals- and departure-hall and a new baggage handling system. A total of 117,000 square meters was added, bringing a total to 265,000 square meters today. OSL is set to handle approximately 30 million passengers a year. Yet before the North Pier was finished, OSL have invested further plans to expand the international terminal for more direct flights to non-Schengen destinations, and are planning on adding six new gates for long-haul aircraft. The expansion is set to begin somewhat around 2017 (Summer at earliest) and will be finished between 2019 and 2021.Once the non-Schengen expansion is finished, the airport will have an opportunity to accommodate the largest <b>wide-body</b> aircraft; the <b>Airbus</b> A380. This would fix the issue today where Norwegians are traveling to other international airports for connecting flights {{to the rest of the}} world, because OSL is too small for handling a long-haul international network. Another phase will be added later on to bring the total capacity to 35 million passengers annually through the T2-project.If passenger traffic continues to grow and if the capacity will be surpassed beyond the capabilities, OSL and Avinor will call out for a master phase (as situated in the Master Plan 2012-2050), including extension of the North Pier by another 100 meters, adding a third runway with a free-standing pier between it and the existing Eastern runway, as well as a new terminal to the southeast area of the current international terminal (by where Park Inn is located). The Government of Oslo has debated the opportunity of a third runway in the future. If they approve, the runway will not be finished until 2030 at the earliest. Avinor has discovered the existing runway capacity will be saturated by 2030. Despite this, critics have pointed out that larger hubs as Heathrow in London only operates with two runways. However, such airports often suffer of major delays and chaos at their schedules. Oslo had 234,974 movements against 474,087 at Heathrow in 2015. Former Minister of Transport, Liv Signe Navarsete (Center), has stated that spreading the traffic between the two airports (RYG is closed on permanent basis) will result in inconvenience for passengers and a massive need for inter-airport ground transportation, but has announced she is opposed to a third runway. Avinor is facing large costs of extending short runways in rural locations or replacing such airports during the 2020 decade, so a third runway at Oslo is less prioritized.|$|R
