5|$|Bishop {{received}} several honorary titles and fellowships during her career. In 1932, she was appointed a Yallow Fellow of Girton College, an honour she held {{until her death}} in 1990. Bishop was also a Beit Fellow from 1929 to 1932. The Medical Research Council awarded her a grant in 1937 that sparked her study of Plasmodium. In 1945 and 1947, {{she was involved in}} organising Girton College's Working Women's Summer School, an institution designed to provide intellectual fulfilment for <b>women</b> <b>whose</b> formal education ended at the age of 14.

5|$|Karađorđe was feared by {{enemies and}} allies alike {{because of his}} {{volatile}} temper. In 1806, he had ordered that his brother Marinko be hanged. According to one account, Marinko {{had been accused of}} raping a peasant girl. Another suggests that he had been attempting to seduce young <b>women</b> <b>whose</b> husbands were away at the front. Whatever the case, Karađorđe entertained senior rebel leaders in his home while his brother's lifeless body dangled from the front gate—a warning to others to refrain from the behaviour in which Marinko had been engaging.|$|E
5|$|The Confraternity of Christian Doctrine, {{also known}} as C.C.D. {{consists}} of men and <b>women</b> <b>whose</b> mission is to teach the principles of loving and serving God {{to the children of}} the parish who do not attend Catholic School. Members of the confraternity serve as teachers in the Sunday Schools of the parish (there are seven different Sunday Schools belonging to Mt. St. Peter's in total). These teachers send out the Catholic messages of faith and love through words, stories, examples, and prayers in order to help the children grow in their faith. The majority of children who attend one of the Sunday Schools are ages 6–12.|$|E
5|$|The {{tradition}} of Voviyo (wedding songs), sung by women during a Ros, {{is important to}} this community. The procedure is that an elderly lady, usually the yejman (wife of the master of ceremonies, who is known as yejmani) who knows the voviyos, leads the song {{while the rest of}} the women sing along. Only <b>women</b> <b>whose</b> husbands are still living may sing. In ancient times, the wedding songs expressed very lofty sentiments and gave vent to the feelings of the people about the marriage partners and their families, invoking the blessing of God on them.|$|E

5|$|In August 1943, {{recruiting}} {{policies were}} changed to permit SPARS to marry {{men of the}} USCG without having to resign. The USCG would continue to accept applicants who were married to men in the Army, Navy, or Marine Corps, but would not accept {{a woman who was}} already married to an enlisted man or an officer serving in the USCG. However, women could join the SPARS if their husbands were enrolled as temporary members of the reserve. In November 1943, the marriage policy with respect to recruits was changed further to permit women who were wives of cadets, warrant officers, or enlisted men of the USCG to enlist or be commissioned in the SPARs. The ban remained on <b>women</b> <b>whose</b> husbands were commissioned officers in the USCG with the rank of ensign or above.|$|E
5|$|Thespis {{opened on}} Boxing Day {{and ran for}} 63 performances. It outran five of its nine {{competitors}} for the 1871 holiday season, and its run was extended beyond {{the length of a}} normal run at the Gaiety, but no one at the time anticipated that this {{was the beginning of a}} great collaboration. Unlike the later Gilbert and Sullivan works, it was hastily prepared, and its nature was more risqué, like Gilbert's earlier burlesques, with a broader style of comedy that allowed for improvisation by the actors. Two of the male characters were played by <b>women,</b> <b>whose</b> shapely legs were put on display in a fashion that Gilbert later condemned. The musical score to Thespis was never published and is now lost, except for one song that was published separately, a chorus that was re-used in The Pirates of Penzance, and the Act II ballet music.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of one Macedonian incursion, during which border guards are killed, Dumitriu is ordered to round up and execute {{a number of his}} Bulgarian prisoners. Horrified by this random reprisal, Marie-Thérèse strives to have them pardoned and released, but her plea only serves to irritate her husband's {{superiors}}. Her husband alienates his superiors further when he asks for the execution order to be ratified through official channels, whereas they would prefer an extrajudicial killing. The resulting toll on Dumitriu's career means that they are forced to leave Southern Dobruja, shortly before which the captain's colleagues make public their resentment of the couple. The captain feels dishonored when an angry General Tchilibia draws a comparison between Von Debretsy and the prostitute Erzsi and stresses that, as Hungarians, both women are natural suspects in Romania. It is {{a result of}} this that Dumitriu decides to commit suicide, unable to decide whether to shoot himself in the mouth or in the temple, and ultimately falling of the stool (which his mare had chewed on) and weeping uncontrollably. This episode, Simon points out, was not present in the original text, and was invented by Pintilie to underline the degradation his character undergoes in order to survive. In what is one of the closing scenes, Marie-Thérèse is stoned by those Bulgarian <b>women</b> <b>whose</b> husbands had been executed.|$|E

5|$|Recording {{sessions}} for The Joshua Tree began in January 1986 in Danesmoate House in Dublin and continued throughout the year. U2 briefly interrupted these sessions in June to join Amnesty International's A Conspiracy of Hope tour of benefit concerts. Following the first concert in San Francisco, lead singer Bono met René Castro, a Chilean mural artist. Castro had been tortured {{and held in}} a concentration camp for two years by the dictatorial Chilean government because his artwork criticised the Pinochet-led regime that seized power in 1973 during a coup d'état. Castro showed Bono a wall painting in the Mission District that depicted the ongoing plight in Chile and Argentina. He also learned of the Madres de Plaza de Mayo, a group of <b>women</b> <b>whose</b> children were forcibly disappeared by the Argentine government. The Madres' children were students who had opposed the government during the Dirty War, and the coup d'état that brought Jorge Rafael Videla to power. The Madres joined together to campaign for information regarding the locations of their children's bodies and the circumstances of their deaths, believing them to have been kidnapped, tortured, and murdered.|$|E
5|$|The {{main body}} {{compartments}} that store lead are the blood, soft tissues, and bone; the half-life {{of lead in}} these tissues is measured in weeks for blood, months for soft tissues, and years for bone. Lead in the bones, teeth, hair, and nails is bound tightly and not available to other tissues, and is generally thought not to be harmful. In adults, 94% of absorbed lead is deposited in the bones and teeth, but children only store 70% in this manner, a fact which may partially account for the more serious health effects on children. The estimated half-life of lead in bone is 20 to 30years, and bone can introduce lead into the bloodstream long after the initial exposure is gone. The half-life of lead in the blood in men is about 40days, {{but it may be}} longer in children and pregnant <b>women,</b> <b>whose</b> bones are undergoing remodeling, which allows the lead to be continuously re-introduced into the bloodstream. Also, if lead exposure takes place over years, clearance is much slower, partly due to the re-release of lead from bone. Many other tissues store lead, but those with the highest concentrations (other than blood, bone, and teeth) are the brain, spleen, kidneys, liver, and lungs.|$|E

25|$|The breast {{reduction}} {{performed with}} the liposuction-only technique usually applies to the <b>woman</b> <b>whose</b> oversized breasts require the removal of a medium volume of internal tissue; and to the <b>woman</b> <b>whose</b> health precludes her being under the extended anaesthesia usual to surgical breast-reduction operations. The ideal lipectomy candidate is the <b>woman</b> <b>whose</b> low-density breasts are principally composed of adipose tissue, have a relatively elastic skin envelope, and manifest mild ptosis. The therapeutic advantages of the liposuction-only technique are the small incision-scars required {{for access to the}} breast interior, hence, a shorter post-operative healing period for the incision scars; the therapeutic disadvantage is limited breast-reduction volumes.|$|R

25|$|Working {{mothers of}} a certain low {{socioeconomic}} status and with proof of an employment contract and working hours receive subsidized child care through legislation passed in 1994.

Chile offers paid maternity leave for women working in the formal sector, paying women 100 percent of their salary during the leave, and also allows women a one-hour feeding break each day until the child has {{reached the age of}} two.
