50|$|Chrysler played {{catch-up}} on some wagon {{specific features}} in 1969: The tailgate became a two-way door-gate, able to swing sideways or drop downward, a feature Ford had pioneered in 1965.

40|$|Optimum energy {{efficiency}} in a {{wireless power transfer}} (WPT) system usually occurs only at a specific load value while the load such as a battery is normally not constant. A major challenge in WPT is therefore to achieve high {{energy efficiency}} over a <b>wide</b> <b>load</b> range. Previously, impedance transformation methods such as DC-DC converters and use of a relay coil, {{have been used to}} transform the practical load resistance to the optimum (or near optimum) value. In this paper, a new approach based on re-configurable magnetic resonant structures is proposed to achieve high energy efficiency and low volt-amp ratings. This basic principle is to create more than one efficiency-load curve. The WPT system is controlled to be operated within the top regions of the energy efficiency curves of the reconfigurable circuits so that high energy efficiency can be achieved over a very <b>wide</b> <b>load</b> range. The principle of this new approach is explained with an analysis and verified with practical measurements...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{investigated}} {{the possibility of}} increasing the efficiency of a DC-DC converter over a <b>wide</b> <b>load</b> range and a wide input-voltage range based on the Single Active Bridge (SAB) topology with two approaches. The first approach involved making changes to the topology whereas the second made use {{of the concept of}} modularity. In the first approach, two changes were made to the Single Active Bridge topology. The first approach resulted in a new topology termed as the Partial Resonant Single Active Bridge (PR-SAB), and the second approach involved adding a switchable snubber capacitor to the SAB. In the second approach with modularity, the topology changes were applied to the Input-Parallel-Output-Parallel (IPOP) converter with SAB modules. Significant efficiency improvements were achieved over a <b>wide</b> <b>load</b> range with the optimisation of the SAB module snubber capacitors. Efficiency improvement over a wide input voltage range was achieved with the Input-Series-Output-Parallel (ISOP) converter. Various module shutdown methods were investigated in this thesis which enabled this improvement. Electrical Power EngineeringElectrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Scienc...|$|E
