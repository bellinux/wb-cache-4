40|$|A {{technique}} {{was developed to}} obtain bidirectional reflectance data from natural surfaces by using a folding mirror to transfer the reflected energy from the test surface to a spectroradiometer. The folding mirror was a first surface reflector made by stretching Mylar vacuum coated with aluminum over a light <b>weight</b> <b>frame.</b> The optically folding mirror was positioned over the test surfaces with a moveable platform for both laboratory and field tests. Field tests were conducted using a tethered balloon system to position the folding mirror. A spectroradiometer was designed and built specifically for this investigation. The spectroradiometer had an angular field of view of twenty-four minutes in one axis and ten minutes in the other axis. The radiometer was capable of detecting energies in small bandwidths throughout the electromagnetic spectrum from 0. 3 microns to 3. 0 microns. Bidirectional reflectance data and variations in the data with source angles were obtained for Saint Augustine grass, Bermuda grass, and a black alluvium soil from the Mississippi River delta...|$|E
40|$|The {{article is}} devoted to {{effectiveness}} of using of monosymmetrical I-beams with flexible wall frame structures of variable section, features of their calculation and design. Aim: The aim of research is to confirm the feasibility of I-beams with flexible wall bearing as light metal skeletons for buildings of the universal assignment. Materials and Methods: In {{order to reduce the}} metal consumption a frame is conventionally divided into several sections according to bending moment diagrams so that in the more compressed zone section the belt of great area was located, and in the stretched or less intense zone the lesser belt was installed. The resulting sections have smaller area in compare to symmetric profiles. Additional reduce bending moments provided as a result of displacement of elements axes with variable cross section. Results: The calculations and selection of sections of the frame have shown that it can be achieved the reducing of bearing elements weight by 10 % compared to the symmetrical profiles of variable stiffness due to using monosymmetrical sections. The effectiveness of the proposed constructive solution is confirmed by compare of the projected <b>weight</b> <b>frame</b> construction with existing analogue. The symmetrical frame profile is 15. 3 % lighter; the monosymmetrical frame profile is 27 % lighter. Conclusions: Analysis of stress-strain state structures shown: first, through asymmetrical profile there is a shifting of the center of gravity section, which leads to a redistribution of internal forces in the frame; secondly, because of the small cross-sectional area of the stretched zones more difficult to ensure the stability of the plane form of bending beams, which leads to the necessity to disconnect areas curtain beams by constraints of smaller steps...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Multi-expert {{constructing}} Fuzzy {{cognitive map}} {{is a typical}} multiexpert knowledge combination problem. In this paper, we investigate the use of Dempster-Shafer evidence theory {{as a tool for}} multi-expert knowledge combination. In proposed method, we use each expert opinion as a evidence, the possible value of <b>weight</b> as <b>frame</b> of discernment, the expert’s evaluation to a <b>weight</b> on <b>frame</b> of discernment as basic probability assignment, and Dempster-Shafe rule as combined basis of basic probability assignment m. Finally, the weight is given according to combined basic probability assignment. The strategy can gradually reduce the hypothesis sets and approach the truth with the accumulation of evidences, which make the result of decision more all –around and more scientific. The experimental result is shown that the method can keep exactitude information, reduce conflict factor and improve knowledge quality. ...|$|R

40|$|Incorporating domain-specific side {{information}} via coupled factorization models {{is useful in}} source separation applica-tions. Coupled models can easily incorporate information from source modalities with different statistical properties by estimating shared factors via divergence minimization. Here, {{it is useful to}} use mixed divergences, a specific divergence for each modality. However, this extra freedom requires choos-ing the correct divergence as well as an optimal weighting mechanism to select the relative ‘importance’. In this paper, we present an approach for determining the relative <b>weights,</b> <b>framed</b> as dispersion parameter estimation, based on an infer-ence framework introduced previously as Generalized Cou-pled Tensor Factorization (GCTF). The dispersion parameters play a key role on inference as they form a balance between the information obtained from multimodal observations. We tackle the problem of optimal weighting by maximum like-lihood exploiting the relation between β-divergences and the family of Tweedie distributions. We demonstrate the useful-ness of our approach on a drum source separation application...|$|R
