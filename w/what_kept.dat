25|$|Another album by Diesel Park West was {{released}} in March 2012. <b>What</b> <b>Kept</b> You {{is a collection of}} unreleased tracks from 1994–1996, recorded during the period that brought about FreakGene. The album proves what a fertile period this was for Butler and the band. It is available as a download on the Diesel Park West website.|$|E
25|$|<b>What</b> <b>kept</b> the {{new country}} {{together}} was {{the vision and}} forceful personality {{of the founders of}} Pakistan: Jinnah, the governor general popularly known as the Quaid i Azam (Supreme Leader); and Liaquat Ali Khan (1895–1951), the first prime minister, popularly known as the Quaid i Millet (Leader of the Community). The government machinery established at independence was similar to the viceregal system that had prevailed in the pre-independence period and placed no formal limitations on Jinnah's constitutional powers. In the 1970s in Bangladesh Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the leader of the independence movement of Bangladesh from Pakistan, would enjoy much of the same prestige and exemption from the normal rule of law. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman has often been criticized in many quarters of being autocratic.|$|E
25|$|Several strips made {{allusions to}} Wally's disappearance, {{including}} one featuring Becky Howard's car having a POW/MIA bumper sticker and her placing a U.S. flag on an unidentified grave. In the July 12, 2009, strip, it is finally shown that Wally {{is alive and}} in full military uniform; a backstory revealed that Funky had gotten a call from his ex-wife, Cindy, informing him that Wally was alive {{and that she had}} conducted an interview that was to air on the news that evening. It was revealed that Wally had been held as a prisoner of war in Iraq for the past decade (possibly taken hostage around the time of Lisa's death), and—unaware that he was presumed dead and that Becky had remarried—stated during that interview that <b>what</b> <b>kept</b> him sane during his time in captivity was thinking about his wife and family. Funky visits the Howards to reveal that Wally was alive and in good health. In the August 9, 2009, strip, it was revealed that the grave Becky had visited all these years was that of Wally's assumed remains. Wally has made occasional appearances since his return to Westview, and made his first appearance as a central character in a storyline that began February 1, 2010, strip.|$|E

500|$|The {{cast and}} crew of The X-Files reacted {{positively}} to the episode. Gillian Anderson cited the episode as being among her highlights of the third season. She said the episode was like dessert, adding [...] "That's <b>what</b> <b>kept</b> it fun and that's <b>what</b> <b>kept</b> it worth doing all the time." [...] Chris Carter said of writer Darin Morgan, [...] "It's been a wonderful coincidence of timing, talent, {{and the success of}} the show, allowing it to stretch in a direction it would never have been able to {{if it had been a}} less successful or if it had been a younger show. Darin is a truly original comic mind. I don't know anybody in the world working in film, and that's what we work in here even though it appears on television, who has the voice Darin has. He is one in many million." [...] Co-Producer Paul Rabwin said of the episode [...] "An instant classic. One of those seminal episodes. You know, when people talk about The Twilight Zone, they say 'Remember [...] "Eye of the Beholder"?' Or [...] "Trouble With Tribbles" [...] on the original [...] 'Jose Chung' is going to be one of those episodes that is immediately revered." [...] Assistant director Tom Braidwood appreciated Charles Nelson Reilly's presence, saying that he captivated virtually everyone and gave everyone a lift, nicknaming everyone on the crew. Executive Producer Robert Goodwin said that the casting of Reilly was the most fun of the episode.|$|E
500|$|The A.V. Club writer Noel Murray graded {{the episode}} with a B+, {{explaining}} that he believed it to be mainly an original story; <b>what</b> <b>kept</b> him from promoting it to the [...] "elusive 'A' level–something no Fringe episode has yet done for me" [...] was the ending, which was [...] "like something out of dozens of mediocre cop shows". Despite this, Murray found it and the asylum storyline to be [...] "compelling". Conversely, UGO Networks was critical of the episode, writing [...] "Fringe continues to wobble in story quality. Last night's episode was a perfectly good way to waste an hour, but far off the track of last week's episodes. The episode featured some plot conveniences that were a bit hard to swallow".|$|E
500|$|The A.V. Club writer Josh Modell {{said the}} episode [...] "was pretty damn funny, but I'm {{predisposed}} to Butters in general {{as well as}} the wide world of pimping." [...] Wired writer Chris Kohler said the topical and timely jokes in [...] "Butters' Bottom Bitch", such as the satire on ACORN, were a strong example of <b>what</b> <b>kept</b> South Park funny and relevant. Not all reviews were positive. Sean O'Neal, also of The A.V. Club, gave the episode a C grade, and said [...] "It was basically one note held for the run of the ep, in service of a simple little story without many surprises." [...] O'Neal said the subplot involving the police was [...] "similarly repetitious", but he liked how the two plots came together to resolve each other.|$|E

The words were <b>what</b> <b>kept</b> him in various honored posts; the words were what caused the students to flock to his often aborted courses; the words were what earned him esteemed lectureships and prizes. His contemporaries failed to see the duality of the man, confusing the deep, wise voice of Eiseley's writings with his own personal voice. He was a natural fugitive, a fox at the wood's edge (in his own metaphor)..." ...|$|E

2500|$|Mountains was the band's final album for BNA. Released in 2007, it was {{produced}} by Mark Bright, whose other production credits include Blackhawk, Rascal Flatts, and Carrie Underwood.

Erlewine criticized the band for taking [...] "fewer risks than ever" [...] on the album. In March 2007, Lonestar was dropped from BNA's roster due to declining sales. Guitarist Michael Britt attributes the group's commercial downfall in the mid-2000s to the label's choices in singles, saying {{in an interview with}} CMT, [...] "I think we painted ourselves into a corner...

2500|$|Between 1925 and 1927, Ricketts' sister Frances {{and both}} his parents moved to California; Frances {{and their father}} Abbott worked with Ricketts at the lab. In late 1930 Ricketts met {{aspiring}} writer John Steinbeck and his wife Carol, who had moved to Pacific Grove earlier in the year. For {{more than a year}} Carol worked half-time for Ricketts at the lab, until 1932 when Ricketts' wife Nan left, taking their two daughters, and Ricketts no longer had enough money to pay Carol's salary. Steinbeck himself also spent time at the lab, learning marine biology, helping Ricketts preserve specimens and talking about philosophy. Steinbeck lived very near the lab. <b>What</b> <b>kept</b> them together was the discovery that each had an almost boundless curiosity about almost everything, and that their personality meshed so well. John had a need to give, and Ed a need to receive. Ed made listening an art. At one point in John's life, he suffered an [...] "overwhelming emotional upset", and went to the lab to stay with Ed.

2500|$|Hanam Sunim {{was famous}} for the {{diligence}} of his spiritual practice, and {{it is often said}} that during the last 25 years of his life he never once left his temple, Sangwon Temple, in the Odae Mountains. Many people, hearing of this, assume that it was because of his spiritual practice that he wouldn't leave. However, a close examination of Hanam Sunim's letters reveals that he actually did leave the Odae Mountains at least twice between 1926 and 1933. <b>What</b> <b>kept</b> him there in later years appears to have been his responsibility for the sunims practicing in the Odae mountains, combined with his ill-health. Hanam Sunim repeatedly refused to go to Seoul, where he would have been at the bidding of the Japanese government, and it seems that people confused this as a desire to stay in the Odae Mountains. In a conversation with the Japanese Superintendent of Police, Hanam Sunim plainly states that he'd gone to Seoul to visit a dentist, and south to see Bulguk Temple. This was confirmed by his long-time correspondent, Kyeongbong Sunim, who living nearby at Tongdo Temple, recorded in his diary that Hanma Sunim visited him for several days before returning to the Odae Mountains.(c.f. Chong Go 2007: 75) ...|$|E

2500|$|Having {{lost all}} of her {{endorsements}} too, Suzuki was faced {{with the problem of}} production companies refusing to sign her and tried to make a comeback {{in the next two years}} with little to no success. Her relationship with her producer, Tetsuya Komuro, also ceased. Sony also took {{all of her}} singles and albums released up to that point off CD shelves. Many people were convinced that her chances for making a comeback were nil. In 2003, Suzuki finally negotiated an out-of-court agreement with Sony. Her contract with the label was scheduled to end in December 2004. Eiji Yamada was subsequently fined for his role in the tax evasion. Government officials linked to the scandal included former Education Minister Takashi Kosugi and two other legislators, who allegedly received 34 million yen in unofficial payments for referring AG Communication and other clients seeking tax evasion. About this period, Suzuki herself has said [...] "I really didn't know what was going on, lots of lies were being thrown about in the media.

2500|$|Lady Love {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. Samantha Greaves of Examiner.com described the album as [...] "very diverse", listing [...] "Take Away Love" [...] as [...] "One of the gems on Lady Love" [...] and praised [...] "LeToya's {{ability to think}} out the box and to bring to R music something different than the vast majority". Meanwhile, Timothy Michael Carson of About.com praised LeToya's [...] "versatility" [...] and [...] "soft soprano vocals", but wrote that [...] "many of the songs tend to sound alike" [...] and so [...] "Lady Love can quickly become a tiresome listen". Carson commented that [...] "LeToya's vocals are <b>what</b> <b>kept</b> [...] replaying the album over", lending particularly praise to the tracks [...] "I Need a U" [...] and [...] "Don't Need U" [...] – which he named [...] "LeToya's best recording to-date" [...] – before describing the album as a [...] "great listen". Nathan S. of DJBooth.net also gave a particularly favorable review of [...] "I Need a U", which he described as a [...] "breathy and burning track that should set the sheets on fire". Nathan also lent praise to LeToya's [...] "fierce personality" [...] on the [...] "remarkable" [...] "She Ain't Got...". However, he noted that [...] "Lady Love isn’t a perfect album" [...] and [...] "at times it feels uninspired and overly deliberate" [...] but wrote that [...] "it’s clearly {{the work of a}} woman coming into her own as an artist" [...] and so promised that he is [...] "not going to attach a “formerly of Destiny’s Child” onto LeToya Luckett’s name. She will finally be, simply, LeToya. She’s earned it". Andy Kellman of Allmusic gave a more mixed review however, describing the album as being [...] "just as scattered and uneven as LeToya's self-titled debut", but noted that there are no [...] "shortage of high points", listing; [...] "Regret", the [...] "pummeling, startlingly brash" [...] "She Ain't Got..." [...] and [...] "the melancholy" [...] "Take Away Love" [...] as particular stand-outs. On the contrary, Diana Ayok of SoulCulture rated the album 3.5 out of 5, noting it as [...] "better and stronger than [...] first self titled album" [...] and heralded it as [...] "a genuinely impressive album" [...] that she [...] "would recommend" [...] "to any R lover".|$|E
