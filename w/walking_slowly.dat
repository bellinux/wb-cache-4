5|$|While most ants have poor eyesight, Myrmecia ants have {{excellent}} vision. This trait {{is important to}} them, since Myrmecia primarily relies on visual cues for navigation. These ants are capable of discriminating the distance and size of objects moving nearly a metre away. Winged alates are only active during the day, as they can see better. Members of a colony have different eye structures due to each individual fulfilling different tasks, and nocturnal species have larger ommatidia in comparison to those that are active during the day. Facet lenses also vary in size; for example, the diurnal species M. croslandi has a smaller lens in comparison to M. nigriceps and M. pyriformis which have larger lenses. Myrmecia ants have three photoreceptors that can see UV light, meaning {{they are capable of}} seeing colours that humans cannot. Their vision is said to be better than some mammals, such as cats, dogs or wallabies. Despite their excellent vision, worker ants of this genus find it difficult to find their nests at night, due to the difficulty of finding the landmarks they use to navigate. They are thus more likely to return to their nests the following morning, <b>walking</b> <b>slowly</b> with long pauses.|$|E

25|$|The border {{station at}} Holmec was the {{location}} of an alleged war crime perpetrated by Slovenian TO forces, filmed by the Austrian public broadcasting station ORF. Video footage shows {{a small group of}} YPA soldiers standing or <b>walking</b> <b>slowly</b> with raised hands, holding up a white sheet in an apparent attempt to surrender. Moments later, gunfire is heard and the soldiers fall or jump to the ground. Neither the origin of the gunfire nor its exact effect are clearly visible on the video segment. Slovene officials maintain that the YPA soldiers jumped for cover and were not hit, and that the matter was thoroughly investigated years ago. However, the incident sparked renewed public debate after the footage was shown on Serbian TV station B92 in 2006, with many claiming that the soldiers were shot and killed by Slovenian TO troops and that Slovenia is trying to cover up the affair.|$|E
25|$|The first {{indications}} of A-T usually occur during the toddler years. Children start walking at a normal age, {{but may not}} improve much from their initial wobbly gait. Sometimes they have problems standing or sitting still and tend to sway backward or from side to side. In primary school years, walking becomes more difficult, and children will use doorways and walls for support. Children with A-T often appear better when running or walking quickly in comparison to when they are <b>walking</b> <b>slowly</b> or standing in one place. Around {{the beginning of their}} second decade, children with typical forms of A-T start using a wheelchair for long distances. During school years, children may have increasing difficulty with reading because of impaired coordination of eye movement. At the same time, other problems with fine-motor functions (writing, coloring, and using utensils to eat), and with slurring of speech (dysarthria) may arise. Most of these neurologic problems stop progressing after the age of about 12 – 15 years, though involuntary movements may start at any age and may worsen over time. These extra movements can take many forms, including small jerks of the hands and feet that look like fidgeting (chorea), slower twisting movements of the upper body (athetosis), adoption of stiff and twisted postures (dystonia), occasional uncontrolled jerks (myoclonic jerks), and various rhythmic and non-rhythmic movements with attempts at coordinated action (tremors).|$|E
500|$|Late {{adolescence}} and early adulthood are peak periods for {{the onset of}} schizophrenia, critical years in a young adult's social and vocational development. In 40% of men and 23% of women diagnosed with schizophrenia, the condition manifested itself {{before the age of}} 19. The onset of the disease is usually later in women than in men. To minimize the developmental disruption associated with schizophrenia, much work has recently been done to identify and treat the prodromal (pre-onset) phase of the illness, which has been detected up to 30months before the onset of symptoms. Those who go on to develop schizophrenia may experience transient or self-limiting psychotic symptoms and the non-specific symptoms of social withdrawal, irritability, dysphoria, and clumsiness before the onset of the disease. Children who go on to develop schizophrenia may [...] also demonstrate decreased intelligence, decreased motor development (reaching milestones such as <b>walking</b> <b>slowly),</b> isolated play preference, social anxiety, and poor school performance.|$|E

500|$|A {{music video}} for [...] "Superpower" [...] was {{released}} on December 13, 2013 through the iTunes Store, {{in addition to a}} clip for every other track on the parent album. On November 24, 2014 the clip was also uploaded to the singer's Vevo account. A behind-the-scenes video was also released online on December 2, 2014, featuring commentary by director Åkerlund. The concept behind the video for [...] "Superpower" [...] revolves around Beyoncé leading a revolution. The video begins with quick shots of a desolate parking lot. Beyoncé then appears with a balaclava which she uses to cover her face up to the eyes. She is seen <b>walking</b> <b>slowly</b> towards the camera, as other people start joining her with flags and bats in their hands. Later in the video, she takes the mask off and the people surrounding her set [...] various objects on fire using Molotov cocktails, write graffiti on walls, and break a car. Beyoncé is later seen holding a man with a mask who is laying on the ground. The end of the video sees the protesting group facing a line of SWAT policemen. They start running towards them and as the video comes to its end Beyoncé holds hands with the person next to her which is the same man she hugged {{on the ground in the}} previous scene. For the look in the video, she donned a cropped T-shirt, pants designed by Åkerlund, a green scarf by Michael Schmidt, shoes by Rodarte and rings by Lynn Ban.|$|E
500|$|Casablanca Records {{commissioned}} a music video {{to be directed}} by Jake Nava, who previously worked {{in the same year}} with Britney Spears on her music video for [...] "My Prerogative" [...] (2004). The music video for [...] "Rumors" [...] premiered on October 14, 2004 and October 20, 2004 through Disney Channel and MTV. In the beginning of the video, Lohan is followed by paparazzi as she is entering her car. It is revealed that this is a Lindsay-look-alike, and that the real Lohan is entering another car to go to a club. The car comes to a stop, and she then steps into an elevator and sings the first verse of the song, while she is filmed by a CCTV camera in the elevator. The next sequence shows her running through a hallway, dressed up, before getting into the club. There, she dances in the crowd, where she takes a picture of one of the paparazzi herself to get back at him. In the next sequence, she is <b>walking</b> <b>slowly</b> through the club where she finds the man who seems to be her boyfriend. She takes a seat next to her lover and they begin kissing and touching each other, all the while being constantly filmed by cameras in the club. While Lohan sings the second chorus, she is trapped in a cage {{in the middle of the}} club and the whole crowd is watching her. After this Lohan is shown dancing in the club with her friends. At the end of the music video Lohan and her friends enter the top of a high-rise and perform a dance routine while helicopters are circling around them. Finally Lohan gets into a helicopter and escapes. In the end, she throws her camera away with all the pictures taken of her.|$|E
2500|$|Absence, emptiness, nothingness, and {{unresolved}} mysteries {{are central}} features in many Absurdist plots: for example, in The Chairs an old couple welcomes {{a large number}} of guests to their home, but these guests are invisible so all we see is empty chairs, a representation of their absence. [...] Likewise, the action of Godot is centered around the absence of a man named Godot, for whom the characters perpetually wait. [...] In many of Beckett's later plays, most features are stripped away and what's left is a minimalistic tableau: a woman <b>walking</b> <b>slowly</b> back and forth in Footfalls, for example, or in Breath only a junk heap on stage and the sounds of breathing.|$|E

2500|$|The maguari stork {{preferentially}} forages {{in shallow}} waters about 12cm deep, and more rarely at water depths {{of up to}} 30cm. This may be because shallow waters harbour higher numbers of prey taxa, or are high in dissolved carbon and nutrients. This species is primarily a visual forager and its usual manner of hunting consists in <b>walking</b> <b>slowly</b> through wetlands with its bill {{close to the surface}} of the water, ready to seize prey encountered. [...] It breeds early during the seasonal rains whilst the water in the wetland habitat is still clear from the fresh rainwater; so that prey items are more visible through the water and success of prey capture, especially as food for nestlings, is higher. However, this stork has also been observed to grope with its bill in the water, although this may be more common toward the end of the breeding season when water bodies begin to dry up and become turbid.|$|E
