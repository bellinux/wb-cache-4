5|$|Mexican army {{headquarters}} put {{in effect}} an emergency plan three {{days prior to}} the arrival of the hurricane. An estimated 15,000 people evacuated from threatened areas in the path of Madeline. According to one report, evacuations prior to Madeline were considered a success.

5|$|A high {{pressure}} system over New England {{resulted in the}} possibility that Edouard would track {{to the west and}} strike the United States. One computer model predicted the hurricane would strike near Atlantic City, New Jersey with winds of over 111mph (178km/h) on Labor Day. This caused Cape May County officials to contemplate ordering an evacuation for the busiest tourist weekend of the year, though an evacuation never occurred. Due to the possibility for a landfall on the East Coast of the United States, officials at the National Hurricane Center issued Tropical Storm and Hurricane Watches and Warnings from Cape Lookout, North Carolina to Eastport, Maine at various times. Tropical storm warnings existed from North Carolina to Watch Hill, Rhode Island and {{from the mouth of the}} Merrimack River to the United States/Canada border, while hurricane warnings existed from Watch Hill, Rhode Island to Merrimack River, Massachusetts. Hurricane watches were also issued for the tropical storm <b>warning</b> <b>area.</b>|$|E
5|$|Significant {{action was}} taken along the Gulf Coast as the threat the storm posed, {{predicted}} to come ashore at Category Four strength, became more urgent. Over a half million people evacuated their homes in Texas and Louisiana, including everyone in Iberia Parish. A total of 200,000people evacuated in Louisiana. At least 2,000 volunteers staffed 115 Red Cross shelters in Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi, and Alabama. More than 20,000people stayed in those shelters.

5|$|Starting in late December, {{widespread}} rains {{produced by}} the precursor to Helen prompted the issuance of flood warnings throughout the Top End region. Prior {{to the arrival of}} Cyclone Helen on 4January, the Bureau of Meteorology issued cyclone warnings for areas between the Mitchell Plateau, in Western Australia, to Cape Hotham in the Northern Territory. According to local officials, flooding was the greatest concern from the storm rather than wind damage. The <b>warning</b> <b>area</b> was later condensed to encompass areas from Wadeye to Cape Hotham, including Darwin and the Tiwi Islands. By 6January, warnings were issued for the western coast of the Cape York Peninsula between Karumba and Weipa as the remnants of Helen were forecast to regain storm intensity.|$|E

Although the storm moved ashore in Oaxaca, its rainbands also affected the Mexican states of Chiapas, Tabasco, Veracruz, Puebla, and Guerrero. On the day when Carlos made landfall, it dropped heavy rainfall, with 24‑hour statewide maxima of 254mm (10in) in Río Verde, Oaxaca, and 112mm (4.42in) in Petatlán, Guerrero.

5|$|After Narelle {{moved into}} TCWC Perth's area of {{responsibility}} on 9 January, a cyclone watch was issued for areas between Whim Creek and Coral Bay. A blue alert, the Department of Fire and Emergency Services (DFES) lowest level of readiness, was also issued for areas between Mardie and Whim Creek. The following day, the watch was upgraded to a cyclone warning for all areas and a new watch was issued to the west, encompassing areas as far as Cape Cuvier. The watch was further extended early on 11 January to include areas between Cape Cuvier and Carnarvon.
