5|$|Morgan {{had waited}} until her {{academic}} rank was secure before becoming pregnant. She {{had a son}} in 1923, {{the same year that}} she became a full professor. Colleagues were surprised when she had the baby, as she had not mentioned being pregnant and she hid the physical evidence of her pregnancy with her long laboratory jacket. Morgan remembered the reaction of one male colleague <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> him the news; he said if she had five children like he did, she would have hardly noticed the new baby. Morgan's mother moved in with her and cared for the baby so that Morgan could work uninterrupted.|$|E
5|$|Doc Holliday {{himself had}} a duel in a saloon in Las Vegas, New Mexico. One {{of the women}} who worked there had an ex-boyfriend named Mike Gordon who had just been {{discharged}} from the Army. Gordon wanted her to stop working. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> him to leave her alone, he became angry, went outside the saloon, and started shooting out the windows with his pistol. As bullets went through the saloon, Doc unflinching, holstered his Colt Peacemaker revolver, and walked outside. Gordon then started shooting at him but missed. Holliday then drew his pistol and shot Gordon at long range with one shot. He then went back to the saloon. Gordon died the next day and Holliday fled. Doc Holliday has also been credited with wounding and shooting a pistol out of saloon owner Milt Joyce's hand when he tried to brandish it at Holliday.|$|E

5|$|Navarro {{stated that}} he filed suit against Chinchay, who first {{represented}} Van der Sloot during his interrogation, charging her with abuse of authority, conspiracy to commit a crime, and misrepresentation {{because he did not}} find her name on the list of public defenders from Peru's Ministry of Justice. Navarro also filed a complaint against Van der Sloot's translator, insisting that he misrepresented himself as an official translator of the Dutch embassy. Chinchay rejected the claims against her, stating that Van der Sloot had selected her as a private attorney after declining another defense attorney appointed by the state. She contradicted his claims that he did not understand what he was signing by stating {{that she was able to}} speak with him in perfect Spanish. She said that Van der Sloot was interested in talking about the Holloway case, thinking that it might get him extradited to Aruba. Chinchay also said that <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> Van der Sloot that she noticed he was signing various documents with very different signatures, he signaled for her to be quiet.|$|E
5|$|After {{finding out}} that Arizona cheated on her with Lauren, Callie kicks Arizona out of their apartment. They also let out their true {{feelings}} about the accident and more is revealed about how they actually have felt. Callie initially agrees to couples therapy, but she {{shows up at the}} office only to tell Arizona that she isn't going in. Arizona gets drunk with April for a laugh while Callie, who is at the fundraiser, tells people that Arizona died in the plane crash. Arizona is led to believe that she and Leah slept together, however all they did was dance and make grilled cheese sandwiches after watching Derek perform surgery on film. Arizona pursues a sexual relationship with Leah but cuts ties with her when Callie asks her to come back home. It is revealed that Arizona became pregnant via a sperm donor prior to sleeping with Lauren. They decided to try again for a second child, but after agreeing that Callie would carry it, Callie went to see an OB/GYN and discovered that she had developed adhesions in her uterus since Sofia's birth, meaning she can't carry any more children. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> Arizona, Arizona offered to carry the baby, but Callie decided that since they're still on unsteady footing that if something goes wrong, they won't make it and she doesn't want to put them in that position. They agree to postpone their plans to have another baby. However, in the season finale of Season 10 it is implied that Callie and Arizona's dream of having other child may come by means of a surrogate. At the beginning of Season 11, Callie and Arizona decide to have a baby by surrogate and Arizona applies for a fetal surgery fellowship with Dr. Herman. Arizona, with a heavy workload because of the fellowship, and Callie have an argument in the waiting room, and they choose to go to therapy together, resulting in a 30-day break. Arizona believes that the break strengthened their relationship and made her realize that she needs Callie - Callie on the other hand declares that the break gave her a taste of the freedom that she has been missing. Callie walks away and the two get a divorce later.|$|E

25|$|Few of the {{characters}} in the film, besides John and Alicia Nash, correspond directly to actual people. The discussion of the Nash equilibrium was criticized as over-simplified. In the film, Nash suffers schizophrenic hallucinations while he is in graduate school, but in his life he did not have this experience until some years later. No mention is made of Nash's homosexual experiences at RAND, which are noted in the biography; though both Nash and his wife deny this occurred. Nash fathered a son, John David Stier (born June 19, 1953), by Eleanor Agnes Stier (1921â€“2005), a nurse whom he abandoned <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> him of her pregnancy. The film did not include Alicia's divorce of John in 1963. It was not until after Nash won the Nobel Memorial Prize in 1994 that they renewed their relationship. Beginning in 1970, Alicia allowed him to live with her as a boarder. They remarried in 2001.|$|E
25|$|On several {{occasions}} the Riglers maintained that their home {{had been the}} best available option for Genie at the time, and said that both they and everyone who worked with her thought she was doing well. They also said they genuinely loved Genie and always provided her the best care possible, pointing out {{that she had made}} substantial progress in every aspect of her development while living with them, and they and Curtiss both said Genie's mother had prevented them from continuing to work with Genie as they had wanted. While representing the Riglers in court in 1977 and 1978 John Miner {{went out of his way}} to give them credit for acting as foster parents to Genie for four years, and when Curtiss spoke to Rymer in the early 1990s she praised their work with Genie and their willingness to take her into their home, although she also felt they had not done enough <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> them about Genie's abuse in foster care. Justin Leiber argued that the scientists' inability to do more for Genie was largely out of their control, and primarily the result of legal and institutional processes surrounding her placement.|$|E

25|$|In {{the present}} {{universe}} of Camelot, King Arthur showed David the broken Excalibur after reading books {{on how to}} make it whole, and when he asked David to help him find the other half, David realized where the portion of the dagger came from. As for the dagger itself Emma is being drawn to it with each passing day, but is repelled by a protection spell put in place by Regina. The manifestation of Rumplestiltskin continues to consume Emma's mind to the point of Emma nearly hurting Hook. The effects are starting a toll on Emma, prompting an intervention from Hook, Henry, Mary Margaret, David, and Regina, but before they {{can come up with a}} solution, Mary Margaret asks David for a moment alone to talk to her husband, and as expected, was to tell him about King Arthur. However, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> him about Lancelot being alive and the message he gave her, David ended up defending Arthur, believing that he is being very trustworthy. Mary Margaret on the other hand, believes David has become friends with Arthur because he misses the life he enjoyed back in the Enchanted Forest and that fulfilling it as a Knight in the Round Table will make him important again.|$|E
25|$|It {{was during}} her rÃ©gime that the Pressler {{amendment}} came into effect, {{an attempt to}} freeze the programme. During frequent trips to the United States, Bhutto refused to compromise on the nuclear weapons programme, and attacked the Indian nuclear programme on multiple occasions. Benazir Bhutto misled the U.S. <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> them that the programme had been frozen; the programme was progressively modernized and continued under her watch. Under her regime, the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) conducted series of improvised designs of nuclear weapons designed by the Theoretical Physics Group (TPG) at PAEC. Benazir Bhutto also carried messages to Munir Ahmad Khan from her father and back in 1979 as her father, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, had instructed his daughter to remain {{in touch with the}} Chairman of PAEC. In this context, Bhutto had appointed Munir Ahmad Khan as her Science Adviser, and he kept her informed about the development of the programme. In all, the nuclear weapons and energy program remained a top priority, along with the country's economy. During her first term, the nuclear program was under attack and under pressure from the Western world, particularly the United States. Despite economic aid offered by the European Union and the United States in return for halting or freezing the program, Benazir continued the program in both her first and second terms.|$|E
25|$|As {{the story}} {{continues}} {{from the previous}} episode, Emma sees the woman across from her in the cell as the same woman who was arrested for helping Snow, and learns that they are both due to be executed immediately the next day. Using her tricks from the night Neal broke into the amusement park, Emma remembers {{she knows how to}} break a lock by using two spoons, and it works. Later on, Charming catches Snow in the rope trap, although the timeline of their introduction is thrown off, until Hook shows up to say that another woman (Emma) has his ring. Charming looks at Snow's fairy dust pendant while she tells him her backstory (another timeline that was thrown off), and comes {{up with a plan to}} break into Reginaâ€™s castle first, then rescue Emma and steal back the ring. Snow tells them to wait, which gives Hook and Charming time to talk about love. Moments later, Red Riding Hood shows up, revealing herself as a friend of Snow's, and who can get them into the castle. As they reach the place, Red, who transformed into a wolf, scares a guard into running away, but the escape plan goes awry when they run into Emma and her fellow inmate, prompting Hook to tell Emma that she deprived him of a dashing rescue. Seconds later, Snow and Regina prepare to face off, with Snow throwing her dark fairy dust, but Regina uses her magic to stop it in midair. Snow tries telling her that what happened to Daniel (<b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> Cora) was a mistake, saying that she was only a child, but an unforgiving Regina talks about consequences and sets up a stake to burn her. Regina throws a fireball at the helpless Snow White, who appears to die. Her death causes Red to howl as a wolf and Emma to cry over her mother's death.|$|E

500|$|When Lennon went to Hamburg {{again in}} April 1962, {{she found a}} bedsit in a terraced house at 93 Garmoyle Road, Liverpool. Shortly after having failed her art teacher's diploma exam, in August 1962, she found she was {{pregnant}} with Lennon's child. She later explained that she and Lennon had never used contraception, had never talked about it, and didn't think about it at the time. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> Lennon he said, [...] "There's only one thing for it Cyn, we'll have to get married".|$|E

But she apparently {{made no secret of}} her orientation: her friends said she kept a fairy wand on her desk. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> her roommate she was attracted to men, he responded by suggesting they not speak to each other.

Trophimowsky, who had been summoned when his partner's health had deteriorated but arrived after her death, showed no sympathy towards Eberhardt. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> him she desperately wanted to die and rejoin her mother, he responded by calmly offering her his revolver, which she declined.|$|E

Aged just eight, Oliver attended weekend art classes in Inverell run by Ian Howard, {{who went on to}} become dean of the college in Sydney where she would later study. As she was dux of her school, her parents expected her to go on to university. However, Oliver wished to pursue a creative career. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> her parents of her plans, her mother replied, [...] "Darling, your father and I are very pleased you're going to art school, but if you'd been a son, I think we'd be a little disappointed."
