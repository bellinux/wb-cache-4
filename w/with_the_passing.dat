5|$|Equal {{franchise}} {{was eventually}} won <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>passing</b> of the Representation of the People Act 1928. This was not achieved through {{a matter of}} course, but through a constant campaign of organised pressure. The NUWSS reorganised into the National Union of Societies for Equal Citizenship (NUSEC), taking on {{a broader range of}} issues to secure more widespread support.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} British law {{relating}} to marriage {{was based on}} the legal doctrine of coverture, in which a woman's legal rights and obligations were subsumed by those of her husband upon their matrimony. By law a woman had no separate legal existence, and all her property became her husband's; divorce initiated by a woman was difficult and complicated. In April 1868 Josephine and fellow suffragist Elizabeth Wolstenholme set up and became joint secretaries of the Married Women's Property Committee to pressure parliament into changing the law. Josephine remained on the committee until the campaign was successful, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>passing</b> into law of the Married Women's Property Act 1882.|$|E

5|$|In 1981, {{the state}} {{legislature}} began to reform the laws that governed the production of alcoholic beverages. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>passing</b> of the New Jersey Farm Winery Act in 1981, and laws providing for licenses for brewpubs and microbreweries in the 1990s, these two industries have grown significantly {{and the number of}} wineries and breweries have steadily increased. In February 2013, New Jersey issued the first new distillery license since before Prohibition, and legislation has been proposed {{to make it easier to}} establish craft distilleries in New Jersey. , New Jersey currently has 48 wineries, 28 breweries, and 2 distilleries.|$|E

The Red Sox, struggling to get out of third place, failed to make the playoffs {{for the second time in}} five years, but played spoiler during the final series of the season, knocking the Yankees out of first place in the American League East, relegating them to the wild-card for the 2010 season.|$|E
5|$|Positive {{train control}} became a Federal mandate <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>passing</b> of the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008.

5|$|Robert E. Lee's United States {{citizenship}} was posthumously {{restored in}} 1975. Davis had been specifically excluded from earlier resolutions restoring rights to other Confederate officials, and a movement arose to restore Davis's citizenship as well. This was accomplished <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>passing</b> of Senate Joint Resolution 16 on October 17, 1978. In signing the law, President Jimmy Carter {{referred to this}} as the last act of reconciliation in the Civil War.|$|E
5|$|Several Arabians, {{mostly of}} Polish breeding, were {{captured}} from Nazi Germany and imported to the U.S.A. following World War II. In 1957, two deaths in England {{led to more}} sales to the United States: first from Crabbet Stud on the demise of Lady Wentworth, and then from Hanstead <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>passing</b> of Gladys Yule. As the tensions of the Cold War eased, more Arabians were imported to America from Poland and Egypt, and in the late 1970s, as political issues surrounding import regulations and the recognition of stud books were resolved, many Arabian horses were imported from Spain and Russia.|$|E
5|$|The roan colour is rare, {{and today}} is passed on via a single dam line that descends from the {{strawberry}} roan mare Sonja, foaled in 1936. As of 2010, only six confirmed roan Finnhorses exist, all descendants of a 1987 mare, Taika-Tyttö, great-great-granddaughter of Sonja. The second-to-last roan line died out <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>passing</b> of the 1981 stallion Jesper Jr, who had no offspring. Grey exists in one dam line, descending from mare Pelelaikka, especially through her maternal grandson E.V. Johtotähti 1726-93Ta, an award-winning working section stallion. The second last grey line died in 2010 with the 1988 mare Iiris 2275-88R, who had no grey offspring.|$|E

5|$|The {{station was}} first {{proposed}} in the 1980s, although no progress was made until August 2001, when the transportation officials said the official station could be constructed within several years. After several years of proposals, along <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>passing</b> of a high opposer in 2003, the station came up once again in 2008. That year, the proposed Metropark South was {{brought back to the}} Old Bridge council by developer Michael Alfieri. His proposal also brought up the plans for new residential homes, commercial businesses along with the new station. The proposal was conditionally accepted in November of that year. As of 2009, there is no forward on the actual station being constructed.|$|E
5|$|The {{study of}} law was popular in Scotland, and many {{students}} travelled to Continental Europe to study canon law and civil law. Scotland advanced markedly in educational terms during {{the fifteenth century}} with {{the founding of the}} University of St Andrews in 1413, the University of Glasgow in 1450 and the University of Aberdeen in 1495, and <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>passing</b> of the Education Act 1496, which required those who administered justice in Scotland to learn Latin and study law {{for at least three years}} at school.|$|E

Building off the initial pilot, the Benadir administration launched a citywide street naming, house numbering and postal codes project. Officially called the House Numbering and Post Code System, it is a joint initiative of the municipal authorities and Somali business community representatives. According to Nur, the initiative also aims to help the authorities firm up on security and resolve housing ownership disputes. , there are postal codes for 176 localities and sub-localities, including the Mogadishu metropolitan area.|$|E

5|$|Almost 35,000 South Australians {{served in}} the First World War. This number {{amounted}} to 8.5% of the South Australian population at the time, or 37.7% of men {{between the ages of}} 18 and 44. Of those who served, over 5,000 South Australians died. In response to these deaths, Archibald Peake, the premier of South Australia, asked the state parliament to fund a memorial commemorating the victory and the sacrifice of those who had fought and fallen. The motion was presented in March 1919, and it received unanimous support in the House of Assembly and the Legislative Council. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>passing</b> of this motion, the South Australian Government became the first in Australia to elect to build a memorial to the soldiers of the First World War.|$|E
5|$|British rule {{came at a}} {{price for}} many {{ordinary}} {{people as well as}} traders. The Shetlanders' nautical skills were sought by the Royal Navy: some 3,000 served during the Napoleonic Wars from 1800 to 1815 and press gangs were rife. During this period 120 men were taken from Fetlar alone and only 20 of them returned home. By the late 19th century 90% of all Shetland was owned by just 32 people, and between 1861 and 1881 more than 8,000 Shetlanders emigrated. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>passing</b> of the Crofters' Act in 1886 the Liberal prime minister William Gladstone emancipated crofters from the rule of the landlords. The Act enabled those who had effectively been landowners' serfs to become owner-occupiers of their own small farms.|$|E
5|$|First-wave {{feminism}} was {{a period}} of activity during the 19th century and early twentieth century. In the UK and eventually the US, it focused on the promotion of equal contract, marriage, parenting, and property rights for women. By the end of the 19th century, a number of important steps had been made <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>passing</b> of legislation such as the UK Custody of Infants Act 1839 which introduced the Tender years doctrine for child custody arrangement and gave woman the right of custody of their children for the first time. Other legislation such as the Married Women's Property Act 1870 in the UK and extended in the 1882 Act, these became models for similar legislation in other British territories. For example, Victoria passed legislation in 1884, New South Wales in 1889, and the remaining Australian colonies passed similar legislation between 1890 and 1897. Therefore, with the turn of the 19th century activism had focused primarily on gaining political power, particularly the right of women's suffrage, though some feminists were active in campaigning for women's sexual, reproductive, and economic rights as well.|$|E

5|$|Historian Robert Poole {{has called}} the Peterloo Massacre one of the {{defining}} moments of its age. In its own time, the London and national papers shared the horror felt in the Manchester region, but Peterloo's immediate effect was to cause the government {{to crack down on}} reform, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>passing</b> of {{what became known as the}} Six Acts. It also led directly to the foundation of The Manchester Guardian (now The Guardian), but had little other effect on the pace of reform. In a survey conducted by The Guardian in 2006, Peterloo came second to the Putney Debates as the event from radical British history that most deserved a proper monument or a memorial. Peterloo is commemorated by a plaque close to the site, a replacement for an earlier one that was criticised as being inadequate as it did not reflect the scale of the massacre.|$|E
5|$|Illicit distilleries were commonplace {{throughout}} the Speyside area from medieval times but were largely made redundant <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>passing</b> of the Excise Act in 1823. It was under this legislation that legal distilleries could be formed, subject to holding a license. Alexander Gordon, 4th Duke of Gordon, was allegedly {{instrumental in the}} passing of this legislation. Although there is no historical record of {{his involvement in the}} issue, his tenant, George Smith, who was operating an illicit distillery at the time, became the first person in Glenlivet to apply for and receive a license to legally produce spirit. This would prove to be an unpopular decision; every other distiller was operating illegally at the time and hoping the new Excise Act would be repealed, something which would not happen if some distillers accepted the new law. Threats were made against George Smith, so George Gordon provided Smith with two pistols to be used to ensure both his own safety and that of the distillery. In 1824, The Glenlivet distillery was established at Upper Drumin by George and his youngest son John Gordon Smith.|$|E
5|$|In medieval Scotland {{education}} {{was dominated by}} the Church and largely aimed at the training and education of clerics. In the later medieval period {{there was a general}} increase in the numbers of educational institutions as well as increasing use by the laity. These included private tuition in the families of lords and wealthy burghers, song schools attached to most major churches and an increasing number of grammar schools, particularly in the expanding burghs. These were almost exclusively aimed at boys, {{but by the end of}} the 15th century Edinburgh also had schools for girls. The growing emphasis on education cumulated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>passing</b> of the Education Act 1496, which decreed that all sons of barons and freeholders of substance should attend grammar schools. All this resulted in an increase in literacy, but which was largely concentrated among a male and wealthy elite, with perhaps 60 per cent of the nobility being literate by the end of the period.|$|E
