25|$|The first musical {{for which}} Sondheim wrote {{the music and}} lyrics <b>was</b> <b>A</b> <b>Funny</b> Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum, which opened in 1962 and ran for 964 performances. The book, based on farces by Plautus, was written by Burt Shevelove and Larry Gelbart. Sondheim's score was not well received; {{although}} the show won several Tony Awards (including best musical), he did not receive a nomination.|$|E
25|$|The first {{project for}} which Sondheim wrote both music and lyrics <b>was</b> <b>A</b> <b>Funny</b> Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum (1962, 964 performances), {{with a book}} based on the works of Plautus by Burt Shevelove and Larry Gelbart, and {{starring}} Zero Mostel. Sondheim moved the musical beyond its concentration on the romantic plots typical of earlier eras; his work tended to be darker, exploring the grittier sides of life both present and past. Other early Sondheim works include Anyone Can Whistle (1964, which ran only nine performances, despite having stars Lee Remick and Angela Lansbury), and the successful Company (1970), Follies (1971) and A Little Night Music (1973). Later, Sondheim found inspiration in unlikely sources: the opening of Japan to Western trade for Pacific Overtures (1976), a legendary murderous barber seeking revenge in the Industrial Age of London for Sweeney Todd (1979), the paintings of Georges Seurat for Sunday in the Park with George (1984), fairy tales for Into the Woods (1987), {{and a collection of}} presidential assassins in Assassins (1990).|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by John Frink and {{directed}} by Nancy Kruse. The episode guest stars Kelsey Grammer as Sideshow Bob Terwilliger. The episode's plot {{is based on the}} film Face/Off. [...] "The Bob Next Door" [...] received positive reviews from critics; most agreed that it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>funny</b> return for Sideshow Bob and an improvement over [...] "Funeral for a Fiend" [...] and [...] "The Italian Bob".|$|E

500|$|The {{following}} year in 1957, Marchant unexpectedly left the sport, {{much to the}} dismay of the cycling community, which believed that he would continue to more success. He switched to playing Australian rules football because that was what his friends did. He felt that fitting in with his friends was more important, saying [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>funny</b> bloke. I did a lot on brilliance rather than hard work. I preferred to do what my mates were doing." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Caught by the Fuzz" [...] {{was based}} on a real-life event: lead singer Gaz Coombes' arrest and caution for {{possession}} of cannabis at age fifteen. In a 2004 interview, Coombes said [...] "It wasn't trying to be a real statement, but at the time we knew that it was a big deal. Kids all around England were getting nicked for having a bit of hash on them. In Oxford that kind of thing happened quite a lot. It's all true so it was easy to write. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>funny</b> experience – not too funny at the time 'cause I was only 15 and shitting myself. The song has that disturbing energy. It's comparable to your heart racing. The adrenaline rush you get when your mum walks into the police station is similar to the energy of the song." ...|$|E
500|$|IGN's Travis Fickett rated [...] "The Job" [...] 8.2/10. He {{believed}} that the episode [...] "pulled off some rather brilliant turns" [...] with the storylines concerning Jan and Jim, Karen, and Pam. Fickett opined however that the episode was at its weakest during the Dwight's take-over scenes in Scranton, as he knew Michael would be returning. He concluded his review on a more positive note by commenting that Ryan's selection [...] "makes for some interesting scenarios for next season. All in all this <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>funny</b> episode that wrapped up some key story lines while still leaving open some questions to be answered next season. It wasn't a home run finale, but it certainly has us eagerly await the fall premiere." [...] AOL TV contributor Jay Black highlighted scenes he found humorous, including Dwight's preferred choice of an assistant and Michael's reaction to Jan's implants. He gave the episode [...] "7 Shrute Bucks out of 7." [...] Various cast members were also lauded for their performances, including Jenna Fischer, John Krasinski, and Melora Hardin.|$|E

500|$|In January 2017, PewDiePie {{began to}} receive {{criticism}} for his non-gaming videos. In one, he seemingly {{uses the word}} nigga, which caused #PewdiepieIsOverParty to trend worldwide on Twitter. A few days later, PewDiePie created further controversy, when he uploaded a video featuring him reviewing the website Fiverr, which allows people to sell a service for $5 USD. In the video, PewDiePie shows his reaction to a duo he had paid to display the message [...] "DEATH TO ALL JEWS" [...] on a sign, as a joke and attempt to highlight the ridiculous things which can be provided as a paid service on the Internet. He immediately apologised within the same video stating, [...] "I am sorry. I didn't think they would actually do it. I feel partially responsible," [...] adding [...] "I'm not anti-Semitic, [...] so don't get the wrong idea. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>funny</b> meme, and I didn't think it would work, okay." [...] PewDiePie received criticism from some users in the video's comment section, {{as well as from}} some media outlets. As a result of this video, both PewDiePie and the duo were banned from Fiverr, prompting the latter to upload an apology video stating that they did not understand the meaning of the sign, and that they were sorry to all Jews.|$|E
500|$|Reviewers {{were mixed}} on Parker and Stone's {{elaborate}} April Fools' Day prank. Diane Werts of Newsday {{said of the}} episode, [...] "Fans rioted. Some jumped ship and never came back. The lesson: Pay off our expectations, or you'll be sorry." [...] Jim Minge of the Omaha World-Herald said South Park fans were [...] "duped" [...] by the episode. Philip Martin of the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, who said in May 1998 the South Park phenomenon was [...] "dead", described the April Fools' prank as [...] "lamentable" [...] {{and part of the}} reason for the show's apparent decline. Others, however, praised Parker and Stone for making the move at the risk of upsetting fans. Tim Clodfelter of the Winston-Salem Journal said, [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>funny,</b> clever move [...] quickly separated the fans who truly [...] "got" [...] humor from those who were just watching for the dirty jokes." [...] Jon Casimir of The Sydney Morning Herald said, [...] "It is gratifying, in an entertainment world dominated by market research and common denominators, to see a program that obviously doesn't care if you like it or not." [...] However, he said the characterization of Terrance and Phillip was too thin to be particularly funny, and added that the novelty of the prank is lost in later years.|$|E
500|$|Hutton rarely captained Yorkshire, {{except in}} the absence of the {{official}} captain, through a combination of poor health, frequent absences with England and the presence of the amateur Norman Yardley in the side. Yardley claimed several times that he would have stood down in Hutton's favour, but the committee remained distrustful of professional captaincy and thought Hutton a hypochondriac who used his health as an excuse not to play. Hutton was a reserved man for whom the Yorkshire dressing room clashes of the 1950s held little appeal. As the side's senior professional, he did not always provide the guidance which younger players in the side were seeking. The team was divided and the players frequently clashed with each other; some critics believe this was a factor in the county's failure to win the County Championship in the 1950s. Ray Illingworth, a player at the time, believes that Hutton was the only man who could have changed the negative attitude around the team, but [...] "he didn't do anything about it". Illingworth recalled that he was a [...] "distant hero", saying: [...] "He <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>funny</b> man was Len—slightly sarcastic all the time. He'd hear an argument in the dressing room and he'd throw a bit of wood on the fire to keep it going. He looked after himself, he was very much of a loner." ...|$|E

500|$|The first song, [...] "Anything Goes", was {{recorded}} by Bennett for his 1959 collaboration with Count Basie and his Orchestra, Strike Up the Band, and Gaga {{first came to}} know about it when she was 13 years old. Gaga thought that [...] "Anything Goes" [...] <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>funny</b> track with a [...] "real sexy, powerful vibe to it, and it's just because we're having fun singing it." [...] The version on Cheek to Cheek finds Bennett and Gaga swapping the lyrics between themselves, and was described by Bobby Olivier, from The Star-Ledger, as [...] "smooth as silk". The syllables are pronounced strongly by Gaga in syncopation while her vibrato complemented Bennett's characteristic jazz vocals and swing. Olivier added, [...] "Gaga's voice, when stripped of its bells and whistles, showcases a timelessness that lends itself well to the genre." [...] "I Can't Give You Anything but Love" [...] was originally written in 1928 by Jimmy McHugh and Dorothy Fields for the Broadway revue, Blackbirds of 1928. The version on Cheek to Cheek opens with the sound of high-hat and an electronic organ. Gaga alters the lyrics to sing [...] "Gee, I'd like to say you're looking swell, Tony", who later rejoins with the line [...] "Diamond bracelets won't work, doesn't sell, Gaga". [...] "Nature Boy" [...] was first released as a single in 1948 by Cole, and it became a commercial success for him. Written by eccentric songwriter eden ahbez, the song about a [...] "strange enchanted boy" [...] features instrumentation from flutes and drums, and has an orchestral arrangement. A loungier version, Gaga sings in a Liza Minnelli inspired voice with a breathy range, followed by Bennett complimenting her with the story of meeting the titular character.|$|E
500|$|When an {{interviewer}} {{asked him to}} describe himself as a child, he replied that he was [...] "probably well-meaning and naive like all kids." [...] His passion for sea life {{can be traced to}} his childhood, when several films by French oceanographer Jacques Cousteau made a strong impression on him. He has said that Cousteau [...] "provided a view into that world", which he did not know existed. He liked to explore tide pools as a child, bringing home objects that [...] "should have been left there and that ended up dying and smelling really bad." [...] Also at a young age, Hillenburg developed his interest in art. His first drawing was of an orange slice. An illustration that he drew in third grade depicting [...] "a bunch of army men... kissing and hugging instead of fighting" [...] marked the first praise that he received for his work after his teacher commended it. [...] "Of course, this is 1970... She liked it because, I mean, obviously that {{was in the middle of}} [...] She was, I would imagine, not a hundred percent for the war like a lot of people then. ...I had no idea about the implications, really, because I just thought it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>funny</b> idea. I remember that still, that moment when she said, 'oh my gosh, look at that,'" [...] Hillenburg elaborated. It was then when he knew that he [...] "had some [...] skill". Hillenburg asserted that his artistry comes from his mother's side, despite his father being a draftsman, noting that his maternal grandmother was [...] "really, really gifted" [...] and a [...] "great painter". In the 1970s, someone took him to the International Tournée of Animation at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Hillenburg was [...] "knocked out" [...] by the foreign animated films that were screened at the festival, including Dutch animator Paul Driessen's The Killing of an Egg (1977). [...] "That was the film that I thought was uniquely strange and that lodged itself in my head early on," [...] he recounted.|$|E

Former Nixon White House Counsel John Dean, has been quoted as saying [...] "based on my review of the files, it appears the Watergate prosecutors were interested in Rove's activities in 1972, but because they had bigger fish to fry they did not aggressively investigate him." ...|$|E
2500|$|Carla Day {{writing for}} Collider.com gave The Flash episode 5 stars out of 5, calling the episode [...] "brilliant" [...] saying, [...] "With so many {{characters}} on the scene, {{it would have}} been easy for the show to get overwhelmed by them all and lose The Flash's unique look and tone. But the writers effectively incorporated the other DC series' characters into the episode while keeping the show's light-hearted and funny demeanor... the standard has been set high for the Arrow and Legends of Tomorrows [...] "Invasion!" [...] hours." [...] Day's one complaint was the fact the Dominators motivations were not very clear. Entertainment Weeklys Chancellor Agard awarded The Flash episode an [...] "A-", stating, [...] "Based on tonight's episode alone, this year's crossover is looking like it'll be the best one yet. The first crossovers were two relatively standalone episodes, and last year's was burdened with setting up Legends of Tomorrow. This is really the first time Berlanti and Co. can tell a cohesive story, and it seems like it's paying off... That being said, the episode did drag a bit whenever it focused too much on the ongoing Team Flash drama... my biggest problems were with the Wally stuff. However, I understand that was here for viewers who might only watch The Flash, and the episode does a good job of appeasing both kinds of fans. Luckily, though, the nonsense doesn't drag the episode too much: For every anxious scene, there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>funny</b> aside to lighten the mood." ...|$|E
