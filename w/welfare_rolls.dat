5|$|Baird's first {{press conference}} as a cabinet {{minister}} {{was held in}} July 1999, and was intended to highlight the Harris government's record in reducing the provincial <b>welfare</b> <b>rolls.</b> Baird told reporters that 15,000 people had left the system since the introduction of workfare, and used this figure {{to argue that the}} government's policy was a success. At the time, he lacked information on the number of workfare recipients who actually found jobs, and he also did not account for 40% of the welfare recipients who had been cut from the list. A number of media reports subsequently criticized both the principle and the implementation of workfare in Ontario.|$|E
25|$|Moynihan's {{research}} of Labor Department data demonstrated {{that even as}} fewer people were unemployed, more people were joining the <b>welfare</b> <b>rolls.</b> These recipients were families with children but only one parent (almost invariably the mother).

25|$|Harris' {{government}} reduced Ontario <b>welfare</b> <b>rolls</b> by 500,000 people; {{critics contend}} these cuts {{led to a}} rise in homelessness and poverty. Supporters argued that high welfare rates had created disincentives to find entry-level jobs, and that poverty levels remained relatively unchanged between 1995 and 2005. Employment rates increased significantly during the late 1990s. The government rewrote labour laws to require secret ballot votes before workplaces could unionize. The previous NDP government's law outlawing the hiring of replacement workers during strikes was repealed.|$|E

25|$|To {{finance the}} tax cuts and to balance the provincial budget, Campbell's first term was also noted for several {{measures}} of fiscal austerity. This included reductions in <b>welfare</b> <b>rolls</b> and some social services, deregulation, sale of government assets (in particular the ferries built by the previous government during the Fast Ferry Scandal), reducing {{the size of the}} civil service, and closing government offices in certain areas. BC Rail's operations were sold to the Canadian National Railway despite contrary campaign promises (condemned as unfair by the losing bidders and triggered charges based in information found during police raids on cabinet offices in a drug-related investigation in {{what is known as the}} BC Legislature Raids).|$|E
2500|$|Welfare – Since {{welfare is}} a {{national}} problem, every effort would be made to have the Federal government absorb 90% {{of the cost of}} welfare. [...] All welfare programs would be administered by the neighborhoods, eliminating the 15% of welfare funds spent on welfare case investigations, the thinking being that neighbors know best which neighbors need/deserve public assistance. [...] The City-State would fund the neighborhoods to employ residents in local daycare centers, housing rehabilitation, and recreational programs, thus keeping thousands off the <b>welfare</b> <b>rolls.</b>|$|E
