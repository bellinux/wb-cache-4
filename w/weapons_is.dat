5|$|Evolve {{features}} {{a total of}} 20 different human characters split into four classes, each class containing 5 characters. Each class has different skills and abilities, and players are required to cooperate {{with each other in}} a match. Players unlock new characters as they progress through the game, e.g. the fourth Assault character will be unlocked if the player has upgraded the previous three Assault characters. The Hunters class features first-person gameplay. The ammunition of their <b>weapons</b> <b>is</b> automatically refilled when not in use, and iron sights are used in- game. Evolve does not allow multiple players to play as the same class in a match. Gameplay variations are also present within the characters in the same class.|$|E
5|$|Sasaki {{described}} her fighting style as revolving around her dual weapons, comparing her to previous series character Cervantes {{but with the}} combination of her spear and short sword weapons allowing for both long distance and close-quarters combat. Control of her <b>weapons</b> <b>is</b> mapped to different inputs from the player's controller, allowing the attacks to be combined and create different horizontal and vertical strikes. However, as a result at long range Hilde's attacks become limited to entirely linear strikes.|$|E

50|$|Toy <b>weapons</b> <b>are</b> toys which imitate real <b>weapons,</b> but <b>are</b> {{designed}} {{for children to}} play with. Though some can be potentially hazardous, toy <b>weapons</b> <b>are</b> generally not meant to cause bodily harm.|$|R
50|$|This <b>weapon</b> <b>is</b> {{used in the}} Koei {{video game}} Dynasty Warriors by Diao Chan. However, this <b>weapon</b> <b>is</b> only {{available}} to her in Dynasty Warriors 1-5, but {{is referred to as}} a set of maces. After the 5th installment her main <b>weapon</b> <b>is</b> changed to a Chain Whip.|$|R
5|$|Since {{dance is}} already an art form, “weapon dance as art” may seem redundant; yet, “art” is used here {{to mean the}} re-creation, say, of a folk weapon dance in a more {{professional}} staged venue, such as a ballet, or when an Australian, Native American, or African troupe of professional musicians and dancers present a reenactment on stage of a weapon dance, or when the use of <b>weapons</b> <b>is</b> introduced in stylized dance enactments of fighting. For example, recent ballets such as the New York City Ballet’s version of Romeo and Juliet (to the music of Sergei Prokofiev) employ highly choreographed sword-fight/dance sequences.|$|E
5|$|Some LARP rules {{call for}} the use of {{simulated}} weapons such as foam weapons or airsoft guns to determine whether characters succeed in hitting one another in combat situations. In Russian LARP events, weapons made of hard plastic, metal or wood are used. The alternative to using simulated <b>weapons</b> <b>is</b> to pause role-play and determine the outcome of an action symbolically, for example by rolling dice, playing rock-paper-scissors or comparing character attributes.|$|E
5|$|The Allied bombing {{campaign}} {{was one of}} the main factors which influenced the Japanese government's decision to surrender in mid-August 1945. However, there has been a long-running debate over the morality of the attacks on Japanese cities, and the use of atomic <b>weapons</b> <b>is</b> particularly controversial. The most commonly cited estimate of Japanese casualties from the raids is 333,000 killed and 473,000 wounded. There are a number of other estimates of total fatalities, however, which range from 241,000 to 900,000. In addition to the loss of mostly civilian life, the raids contributed to a large decline in industrial production.|$|E
5000|$|Mega Man series: <b>Weapons</b> <b>are</b> {{earned from}} the Robot Masters/Mavericks upon {{defeating}} them. The <b>weapons</b> <b>are</b> kept until {{the game is}} turned off (unless a password is used which can bring the player back to a point after the <b>weapon</b> <b>was</b> acquired) or when the game is completed.|$|R

50|$|Production of the <b>weapon</b> <b>was</b> {{funded by}} a Swedish steel {{producer}} and banker (later weapons maker) named Thorsten Nordenfelt, who was working in London. The name of the <b>weapon</b> <b>was</b> changed to the Nordenfelt gun. A plant producing the <b>weapon</b> <b>was</b> set up in England, with sales offices in London, and long demonstrations were conducted at several exhibitions. The <b>weapon</b> <b>was</b> adopted by the British Royal Navy, as an addition to their Gatling and Gardner guns.|$|R
5|$|Cannon Fodder 2 is a military-themed action {{game with}} {{strategy}} and shoot 'em up elements. The player controls a small squad {{of up to}} four soldiers. These soldiers are armed with machine guns which kill enemy infantry with a single round. The player's troops are similarly fragile, and while they possess superior fire-power at the game's outset the enemy infantry becomes more powerful as the game progresses. As well as foot soldiers, the antagonists include vehicles and missile-armed turrets. The player must also destroy buildings which spawn enemy soldiers. For these targets, which are invulnerable to machine gun fire, the player must use secondary, explosive weaponry: grenades and rockets. Ammunition for these <b>weapons</b> <b>is</b> limited and the player must find supply crates to replenish his troops. Wasting these weapons can potentially result in the player not having enough to fulfil the mission objectives. The player can opt to shoot crates – destroying enemy troops and buildings in the ensuing explosion – at less risk to his soldiers than retrieving them, but again at {{a greater risk of}} depleting ammunition.|$|E
5|$|The 5.7×28mm {{projectile}} potentially poses {{less risk}} of collateral damage than conventional pistol bullets, because the projectile design limits overpenetration, {{as well as}} risk of ricochet. The lightweight projectile loses much of its kinetic energy after traveling only 400 m (437yd), whereas a conventional pistol bullet such as the 9×19mm retains significant energy beyond 800 m (875yd), posing greater risk of collateral damage {{in the event of}} a miss. This range exceeds the engagement distances expected for the 5.7×28mm cartridge's intended applications, so the cartridge's limited energy at long range is not considered to be disadvantageous. Since the SS190 projectile does not rely on fragmentation or the expansion of a hollow point, the cartridge (and 5.7×28mm <b>weapons)</b> <b>is</b> considered suitable for military use under the Hague Convention of 1899, which prohibits the use of expanding bullets in warfare.|$|E
5|$|Battles {{take place}} on grid-based {{self-contained}} maps and are governed by a turn-based system where units on both sides are given their chance to move and act. Once a unit has moved, depending on their position relative to allied units and enemies, they may perform actions such as attacking or supporting allied characters through statistic-enhancing abilities, or they can wait until the next turn. When attacking, the game transitions from the top-down view of the map to a side-view battlefield, where a cinematic battle plays between the player and enemy units. Each unit has access to different weapons and items, but these will break {{after a number of}} uses and must be repaired in between missions. The effectiveness of melee <b>weapons</b> <b>is</b> dictated with the series' recurring Weapons Triangle mechanic: axes are strong against lances, lances strong against swords, and swords strong against axes. Villages found during map battles will be attacked; if defended by the player, non-player characters within the village will give hints about future objectives. A map is cleared when the boss is defeated. If characters fall in battle, they are subjected to permanent death, removing them {{from the rest of the}} game. If Roy dies, the game ends and the map must be restarted.|$|E
50|$|The <b>weapon</b> <b>was</b> {{originally}} {{intended as a}} replacement for the coaxial weapon in the American M60 tank. The <b>weapon</b> <b>was</b> evaluated by both the US Army and the US Naval weapon center, who reported that the performance of the <b>weapon</b> <b>was</b> outstanding during all phases of testing. However, neither chose to adopt the weapon.|$|R
50|$|This <b>weapon</b> <b>was</b> {{traditionally}} {{used with}} brute force, as the strength needed to heft such <b>weapons</b> <b>was</b> considerable. As a result, this <b>weapon</b> <b>is</b> not often practiced by kung fu enthusiasts, and newly made replicas may be hollow. However, routines for this weapon still exist in some styles. Chui {{are almost always}} used in pairs.|$|R
50|$|An anti {{ballistic}} <b>weapon</b> <b>is</b> any <b>weapon</b> (<b>be</b> it a missile, a laser {{or another}} type of object) designed to counter threats which are ballistic objects.|$|R
5|$|Players {{assume control}} of Jeremy, a sword-wielding, melee-focused character, and Alysa, who uses {{crossbows}} to deliver ranged attacks. The game {{can be played}} as a single player game, in which the player alternates between controlling Jeremy and Alysa, or as a local co-op game, in which two players play cooperatively, with one controlling each character. Blood Knights does not support online co-op. Like most hack and slash games, the control scheme is minimal. When controlling Jeremy, players can chain attacks using one button (the X button on the Xbox 360), and can use a number of special attacks that have a cooldown timer, including a heavy blow, a whirlwind attack, and a power that draws distant enemies to Jeremy. While controlling Alysa, the game functions as a twin-stick shooter, in which movement is controlled by one thumbstick or set of keys, and firing <b>weapons</b> <b>is</b> controlled by the other thumbstick or another set of keys. Alysa also has special attacks, including the ability to fire flaming arrows and a grenade attack. In single player gameplay, the player can switch between Jeremy and Alysa by pressing a button (the Y button on the Xbox 360). Players can transfer health, {{in the form of}} blood, between the two playable characters, healing one {{at the expense of the}} other.|$|E
5|$|The game {{includes}} {{a wide variety}} of weapons, including melee, projectile, and explosive weapons, as well as airstrike-based attacks. Some are based on real-life arms, such as the shotgun, bazooka, and hand grenade; others are rather fanciful and cartoonish, such as the sheep, which serves as a mobile explosive, and the skunk, which releases poisonous gas. In a normal match, all teams begin with the same weapons, based on the chosen weapon set. Some weapons may not become available until a certain number of turns pass. Depending on the game options, additional weapons may randomly fall onto the terrain in airdropped and teleported crates. In addition to normal weapons, during team creation, each team chooses a special weapon which becomes available to them after a certain number of turns. The special weapons are more powerful than regular weapons and often offer special abilities; super weapons will rarely fall in weapon crates. These weapons are often based on cartoonish themes, such as the French Sheep Strike, and usually devastating in power. In homage to the film Monty Python and the Holy Grail, one of the game <b>weapons</b> <b>is</b> a Holy Hand Grenade, with a sound-effect reminiscent of the Hallelujah chorus from Handel's Messiah.|$|E
25|$|The {{theory of}} peace without <b>weapons</b> <b>is</b> {{as old as}} {{philosophy}} and human consciousness. This theory holds that weapons per se are a threat to peace, and a removal of all <b>weapons</b> <b>is</b> the way to everlasting peace.|$|E
50|$|Aliens {{demonstrated}} its capabilities {{with the}} M56 Smartgun, a handheld light machine gun. This <b>weapon</b> <b>was</b> {{connected to the}} user's Head-Up Display, showing where the <b>weapon</b> <b>is</b> aimed. It was also equipped with a motion-sensitive auto-tracking system, capable of autonomous and accurate targeting of moving objects (the real <b>weapon</b> <b>was</b> a MG42 with a Steadicam harness).|$|R

25|$|The use of {{biological}} <b>weapons</b> <b>is</b> prohibited under customary international humanitarian law, {{as well as}} a variety of international treaties. The use {{of biological}} agents in armed conflict is a war crime.|$|E
25|$|Twenty-five countries, {{including}} the United Kingdom, the United States, Sweden and Russia produce man-portable air defense systems. Possession, export, and trafficking in such <b>weapons</b> <b>is</b> officially tightly controlled, {{due to the}} threat they pose to civil aviation, although such efforts {{have not always been}} successful.|$|E
50|$|More <b>weapons</b> <b>were</b> {{supplied}} {{throughout the}} uprising, {{and some were}} captured from the Germans. Some <b>weapons</b> <b>were</b> handmade by the resistance; sometimes such weapons worked, other times they jammed repeatedly.|$|R
50|$|Native Americans used many {{variations}} of striking <b>weapons.</b> These <b>weapons</b> <b>were</b> mainly used for melee combat with other tribes. In some cases these <b>weapons</b> <b>were</b> thrown for long range attacks.|$|R
50|$|The <b>weapon</b> <b>was</b> first deployed, but not used, during Operation Allied Force when NATO {{entered the}} Kosovo War. Sensor-fused <b>weapons</b> <b>were</b> first fired in combat during the 2003 {{invasion}} of Iraq.|$|R
25|$|The Hague Conventions {{prohibited}} poison weapons. The radioactivity of {{the atomic}} bombings {{has been described as}} poisonous, especially in the form of nuclear fallout which kills more slowly. However, this view was rejected by the International Court of Justice in 1996, which stated that the primary and exclusive use of (air burst) nuclear <b>weapons</b> <b>is</b> not to poison or asphyxiate and thus is not prohibited by the Geneva Protocol.|$|E
25|$|The {{most recent}} {{addition}} to the Galil family of <b>weapons</b> <b>is</b> the MAR compact carbine, which retains the internal features of the original Galil with a completely new frame, operating system and an even shorter barrel. Introduced {{to the public at}} the 2nd International Defence Industry Exhibition in Poland in 1994, the weapon was developed for use with the army and police special units, vehicle crews, army staff, special operations personnel and airborne infantry.|$|E
25|$|The {{strategic}} importance of nuclear <b>weapons</b> <b>is</b> {{a major reason}} why the technology of nuclear fission is politically sensitive. Viable fission bomb designs are, arguably, within the capabilities of many, being relatively simple from an engineering viewpoint. However, the difficulty of obtaining fissile nuclear material to realize the designs {{is the key to}} the relative unavailability of nuclear weapons to all but modern industrialized governments with special programs to produce fissile materials (see uranium enrichment and nuclear fuel cycle.|$|E
50|$|The <b>weapon</b> <b>was</b> {{designed}} by Mahlon J. Gallager, who licensed the design to Richardson and Overman of Philadelphia for production. On 31 August 1861 the first <b>weapons</b> <b>were</b> {{sold to the}} Army.|$|R
50|$|Space <b>weapons</b> <b>are</b> <b>weapons</b> used {{in space}} warfare. They include weapons that can attack space systems in orbit (i.e. anti-satellite weapons), attack targets {{on the earth}} from space or disable {{missiles}} travelling through space. In {{the course of the}} militarisation of space, such <b>weapons</b> <b>were</b> developed mainly by the contesting superpowers during the Cold War, and some remain under development today. Space <b>weapons</b> <b>are</b> also a central theme in military science fiction and sci-fi video games.|$|R
