Gandhi believed that individuals should freely intermarry whoever they want to, but no one should expect everyone to befriend them. Every individual regardless {{of his or her}} background, stated Gandhi, has a right to choose <b>who</b> <b>they</b> welcome into their home, <b>who</b> <b>they</b> befriend and <b>who</b> <b>they</b> spend time with.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} has identified physical and behavioral differences between parents who produce sons {{and those who}} produce daughters. However, the possibility {{that men and women}} have predictions about the sexes of their offspring based on these differences, or any other interoceptive cues, has not been investigated. We compared the dominance, sociosexual orientation, estradiol, testosterone, and 2 D: 4 D ratios of men and women <b>who</b> predicted <b>they</b> would conceive a boy as their first child with those who predicted a girl. Women <b>who</b> predicted <b>they</b> would have a boy were more dominant and less sociosexually restricted than those <b>who</b> predicted <b>they</b> would have a girl. Men <b>who</b> predicted <b>they</b> would have a girl had higher salivary estradiol and higher (more feminine) 2 D: 4 D ratios than those <b>who</b> predicted <b>they</b> would have a boy. Possible implications of these results are discussed in the context of evolutionary theory...|$|R

Pope Gregory XIII (1572–1585) also had to be urged by key figures in the College to appoint his cardinal-nephew: Filippo Boncompagni.|$|E
