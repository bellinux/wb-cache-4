5|$|Throughout the Stalinist period, most Soviet {{workers had}} been paid for their work based on a piece-rate system. Thus their {{individual}} wages were directly tied {{to the amount of}} work they produced. This policy was intended to encourage <b>workers</b> <b>to</b> toil and therefore increase production as much as possible. The piece-rate system led to the growth of bureaucracy and contributed to significant inefficiencies in Soviet industry. In addition, factory managers frequently manipulated the personal production quotas given to <b>workers</b> <b>to</b> prevent workers' wages from falling too low.|$|E
5|$|A {{nematode}} (Myrmeconema neotropicum) that infects canopy ants (Cephalotes atratus) {{causes the}} black-coloured gasters of <b>workers</b> <b>to</b> turn red. The parasite also alters the behaviour of the ant, {{causing them to}} carry their gasters high. The conspicuous red gasters are mistaken by birds for ripe fruits, such as Hyeronima alchorneoides, and eaten. The droppings of the bird are collected by other ants and fed to their young, leading to further spread of the nematode.|$|E

50|$|The focus {{above is}} on how <b>workers</b> respond <b>to</b> {{incentive}} pay, but an alternative way of raising worker performance may be <b>to</b> assign the <b>worker</b> <b>to</b> a good boss. There {{is an old}} adage, “workers don’t leave bad firms, they leave bad bosses.” Is there empirical evidence that some bosses raise the performance of <b>workers</b> relative <b>to</b> other bosses? In Lazear, Shaw, and Stanton (“The Value of Bosses,” Journal of Labor Economics, 2015), the data set is from a technology-based company that measures the performance of every worker. Being assigned a better boss can crucially raise {{the performance of a}} worker.
