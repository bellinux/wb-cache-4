5|$|Van der Weyden {{may have}} drawn {{influence}} from Stefan Lochner's c.1435 Last Judgement, {{and a similar}} c.1420 painting now in the Hotel de Ville, Diest, Belgium. Points of reference include Christ raised over a Great Deësis of saints, apostles and clergy above depictions of the entrance to Heaven and the gates of Hell. In both earlier works Christ perches on a rainbow; in the Deësis panel he also is above a globe. While these two earlier works are filled <b>with</b> <b>dread</b> and chaos, van der Weyden's panels display the same sorrowful, but self-controlled dignity of his best works. This is most evident {{in the manner in}} which the oversized and dispassionate Christ orchestrates the scene from Heaven.|$|E
25|$|The Prince wanders {{for some}} time in the park before falling asleep at the green seat {{appointed}} by Aglaya as their meeting place. Her laughter wakes him from an unhappy dream about Nastassya Filippovna, and they talk for a long time about the letters Aglaya has received. In the letters, Nastassya Filippovna writes that she herself is in love with Aglaya and passionately beseeches her to marry Myshkin, but Aglaya interprets this as evidence that Nastassya Filippovna is in love with him herself, and demands that Myshkin explain his feelings toward her. Myshkin replies that Nastassya Filippovna is insane, that he only feels profound compassion and is not in love with her, but admits that he has come to Pavlovsk for her sake. Aglaya becomes angry, demands that he throw the letters back in her face, and storms off. Myshkin reads the letters <b>with</b> <b>dread,</b> and later that day Nastassya Filippovna herself appears to him, asking desperately if he is happy, and telling him she is going away and will not write any more letters. Rogozhin escorts her.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} factors—ranging from inexperienced conscripts {{and a smaller}} {{industrial}} base to low population growth and obsolete military doctrines—crippled the French effort {{at the outset of}} World War II. The Germans won the Battle of France in 1940 despite the French often having better equipment than their opponents. Prior to the Battle of France, there were sentiments among many Allied soldiers, French and British, of pointless repetition; they viewed the war <b>with</b> <b>dread</b> since they had already beaten the Germans once, and images of that first major conflict were still poignant in military circles. The costs of World War I along with the now stale doctrine employed by the French Army (while the Germans were developing a doctrine which stressed initiative from junior commanders and combining different arms, the French sought to minimize casualties through a rigorously controlled type of battle and a top down command structure) forced the French to look for more defensive measures. The Maginot Line was the result of these deliberations: the French originally allocated three billion francs for the project, but by 1935 seven billion had been spent. The Maginot Line succeeded in holding off the German attack. However, while the French thought that the main weight of the German attack would arrive through central Belgium, and accordingly deployed their forces here, the assault actually came further south in the Ardennes forest. The Third Republic collapsed in the ensuing conflict.|$|E

500|$|When {{asked by}} Kotaku whether the Wii game [...] (2010) was {{what became of}} Metroid Dread, Metroid series {{designer}} Yoshio Sakamoto said it was not. Sakamoto also denied Dreads connection with the Nintendo 3DS game [...] (2017), and stated that Samus Returns is a remake of [...] (1991) and not something to do <b>with</b> <b>Dread.</b> GamesTM asked Sakamoto whether Dread ever existed; Sakamoto confirmed its existence but stated that if the staff went back to it, they would [...] "start from scratch." [...] Sakamoto also stated that they were [...] "waiting and watching and reading the comments to see what {{people are interested in}} before we make any comment on the project." [...] According to Sakamoto, questions about Metroid Dread were popular, especially in interviews following E3. In May 2010, Craig Harris confirmed that the story for Metroid Dread was fully written and that he had seen it. He claimed that Nintendo was able to [...] "bring it back at any time." [...] Metroid Dread is the only game on the internal software list that has not yet been released.|$|E
500|$|Abbott, {{unfamiliar}} with the Court of King's Bench (having been a regional lawyer rather than a London-based one), was initially a disappointment, but soon improved. By 1818 he showed [...] "the highest judicial excellence", although he was criticised for snapping at boring barristers and for taking the government's side in prosecutions. That year, the Lord Chief Justice Lord Ellenborough had a stroke, forcing his retirement. Most of the other judges and legal figures were inappropriate for the role; Sir Samuel Shepherd, for example, was while an able lawyer too deaf to sit as a judge. As a result, Abbott was appointed, and formally took up his position on 4 November 1818. As Lord Chief Justice he saw the Court of King's Bench flourish, with competent Justices and his own abilities; [...] " [...] had more knowledge of mankind than any of , and was more skilful as a moderator in forensic disputation". Abbott's central weakness as a judge was seen to be his support of James Scarlett, his leader when Abbott was a barrister; [...] "The timid junior, become Chief Justice, still looked up to his old leader <b>with</b> <b>dread,</b> was afraid of offending him, and was always delighted when he could decide in his favour".|$|E
500|$|In April 2010, The Hollywood Reporter {{revealed}} that Jon Bernthal and Andrew Lincoln were chosen by producers {{for the main}} cast of the series. Bernthal was to portray Shane Walsh, while Lincoln provided the role of Rick Grimes, the central character of The Walking Dead. While Hurd didn't expect to cast Lincoln, Kirkman was ecstatic with his acting, evaluating him as an [...] "amazing find". In his interview <b>with</b> <b>Dread</b> Central, Kirkman added that [...] "writing Rick Grimes month after month in the comic series, I {{had no idea he}} was an actual living, breathing human being, and yet, here he is. I couldn't be more thrilled with how this show is coming together." [...] Although he was initially shocked upon hearing of The Walking Dead, Lincoln thought the episode's script was well written. [...] "I read it and thought it was well written, and I put myself on tape just for one scene. I didn't know who was involved at this point." [...] The succeeding day, his agent called him about the development of the pilot. Lincoln described the moment as [...] "kind of like a dream list". He later communicated with Darabont via Skype; [...] "We spoke for about 40 minutes about his ideas for the project, about what I liked about Episode One and then he asked would I fly over to come and test." [...] Lincoln flew to Darabont's home, where he viewed [...] "Days Gone Bye" [...] in his garage. He opined that was [...] "brilliant" [...] and [...] "very intimate".|$|E

2500|$|The {{purpose of}} the early {{concentration}} camps was to repress and terrorize opponents of the new regime, primarily communists, but also socialists, dissenting Christians, and trade unionists. Unlike later concentration camps, the prisoners and the guards at Kemna were from the same cities and in many cases, knew each other and were already enemies from the German Revolution of 1918–1919 and subsequent political battles of the 1920s. [...] Torture was practiced and the screams {{of the men were}} audible to people living and working nearby, and severely injured men were taken to nearby hospitals, all causing word of the camp's misdeeds to spread quickly. There was a major release of prisoners in October 1933; those released were forced to sign a document promising to keep secret all they had seen and experienced at the camp, and were threatened with re-arrest if they disobeyed. The Nazis wanted the public to become familiar with the term [...] "concentration camp" [...] and regard it <b>with</b> <b>dread,</b> but worried that the excesses at Kemna and the other early concentration camps would turn public opinion against them and thwart their plans. As a result, the camp was closed in January 1934, just six months after it opened. After the SA lost political influence, reports of torture led to an investigation and eventually to hearings and the perpetrators given a warning. No crimes were prosecuted.|$|E
2500|$|When Perry and McKee {{first met}} in 2004, {{they both were}} [...] "really into Lolita" [...] and [...] "had a mutual fascination with the {{adolescent}} state of mind." [...] They explored the themes in their first records: Perry wrote One of the Boys, which touched on {{the early stages of}} discovering that boys could be more than friends, whereas McKee wrote [...] "Confessions of a Teenage Girl", which was about using sexual power to one's advantage. For the Teenage Dream sessions, Perry and McKee had a [...] "forever young" [...] idea in mind. Perry at first wrote a lyric about Peter Pan, but they later deemed it as [...] "too young" [...] since [...] "we wanted it to have more edge, more sex." [...] Another version included the lines [...] "And {{the next thing you know}} / You're a mom in a minivan", which made them laugh uncontrollably for an hour. There was a final version that was based around the metaphor of [...] "" [...] comparing clothes to sex, in a similar manner to Madonna's 1985 single [...] "Dress You Up". It was rejected by the producers, as McKee explained, [...] "Luke always makes us 'Benny Proof' everything. He says that if Benny doesn't get it, America won't get it." [...] Blanco showed them The Teenagers's 2007 single [...] "Homecoming" [...] and asked them to write in a similar style. McKee said that [...] " [...] looked at each other <b>with</b> <b>dread,</b> knowing we had to start all over again..... We were both so over it we just called it a night." ...|$|E
