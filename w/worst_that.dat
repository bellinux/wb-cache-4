25|$|At Brisbane, on a wicket {{that was}} the <b>worst</b> <b>that</b> I have ever seen, the Yorkshireman was superb. The head-high bouncer was safely ignored. The chest-high {{deliveries}} of both the pace men and the spinners were played safely to the ground, {{out of the way}} of the many grasping hands in the leg-trap, and Hutton's display was a perfect lesson in the art of batsmanship...that will long remain in my memory, being by far the best innings I have ever seen played.|$|E

25|$|On 31 August 2008, Buka {{once again}} rewrote {{the record books}} by winning the 2008 race {{with a time of}} 16:34:05. The {{conditions}} were the <b>worst</b> <b>that</b> they had been in the three years that Buka had competed in the event. That year, Buka trained, which is why he claims he broke his own record. Wayne Urina, claiming second place, is currently the 2nd fastest man to complete the crossing of the Kokoda Trail with a time of 18:34:06. Cyprian Aire came third with 19:11:40.|$|E
25|$|Low-impedance {{microphones}} are preferred {{over high}} impedance for two reasons: {{one is that}} using a high-impedance microphone with a long cable results in high frequency signal loss due to cable capacitance, which forms a low-pass filter with the microphone output impedance. The other is that long high-impedance cables tend to pick up more hum (and possibly radio-frequency interference (RFI) as well). Nothing is damaged if the impedance between microphone and other equipment is mismatched; the <b>worst</b> <b>that</b> happens is a reduction in signal or change in frequency response.|$|E
25|$|On {{the verge}} of death he {{encounters}} Piper and Russell, child ruffians that {{turn out to be}} John McNab's brothers. He leads them back home, bribing them with free pizza, and stays at their cockroach-infested, waste filled house. Here, he finds the <b>worst</b> <b>that</b> the West End has to offer, as he learns that the McNabs are making a bunker because they believe the East End is planning a rebellion. He endures the coarseness and squalor of their home in hopes of keeping Piper and Russell in school and under control, but he is kicked out when he crushes Piper and Russell's toy guns.|$|E

25|$|Filming for {{the show}} begins during the Judge's Auditions, with footage that is {{recorded}} in these being edited {{into a series of}} episodes that are aired on a weekly schedule before the live semi-finals, and featuring the best highlights of the auditions, including those from the best performances the judges saw, to the <b>worst</b> <b>that</b> appeared, whether funny, poorly conceived or generally bad, and in some cases totally inappropriate. These episodes also include interviews with the contestants in a separate area, as well as additional interviews conducted within the wings before and after a performance, that are conducted by the hosts, who also give personal comments about a performance while watching from the wings.|$|E
500|$|Kenny {{is turned}} into a zombie after a {{mortician}} accidentally knocks Worcestershire sauce, a fermented liquid condiment, into his embalming fluid. Parker and Stone originally planned to have a Dr Pepper fall into the embalming fluid (in a belated response to that product's slogan [...] "Dr Pepper, What's the <b>Worst</b> <b>That</b> Could Happen?"), but it was changed after the soft drink company objected to that use of their product.|$|E
500|$|Irwin, {{after his}} death, was {{described}} by Mark Townend, CEO of RSPCA Queensland, as a [...] "modern-day Noah." [...] British naturalist David Bellamy lauded his skills as a natural historian and media performer. Canadian environmentalist David Suzuki paid tribute to Irwin, noting that [...] "umanity will not protect that which we fear or do not understand. Steve Irwin helped us understand those things that many people thought were a nuisance at best, a horror at <b>worst.</b> <b>That</b> made him a great educator and conservationist." ...|$|E

500|$|Larkin's {{public persona}} {{was that of}} the no-nonsense, solitary Englishman who disliked fame and had no {{patience}} for the trappings of the public literary life. The posthumous publication by Anthony Thwaite in 1992 of his letters triggered controversy about his personal life and political views, described by John Banville as hair-raising, but also in places hilarious. Lisa Jardine called him a [...] "casual, habitual racist, and an easy misogynist", but the academic John Osborne argued in 2008 that [...] "the <b>worst</b> <b>that</b> anyone has discovered about Larkin are some crass letters and a taste for porn softer than what passes for mainstream entertainment". Despite the controversy Larkin was chosen in a 2003 Poetry Book Society survey, almost two decades after his death, as Britain's best-loved poet of the previous 50 years, and in 2008 The Times named him Britain's greatest post-war writer.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "first-past-the-post" [...] voting system, {{also known}} as the simple {{plurality}} voting system, is used in Singapore for electing the President as well as Members of the Parliament. This system has been criticized as undemocratic because the eventual winner may have won only a minority of the total votes cast, despite having secured the most number of votes in absolute terms among all the candidates. Thus, there might be cases where an elected politician can be said to have won the mandate of only a minority of voters, and that his or her election is therefore not an accurate reflection of the voters' will. As constitutional lawyer Sir William Wade has said: [...] "If it is accepted that a democratic Parliament ought to represent so far as possible the preferences of the voters, this system is probably the <b>worst</b> <b>that</b> could be devised." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{earliest}} known {{critic of}} the play was diarist Samuel Pepys, who wrote in 1662: [...] "it is a play of itself the <b>worst</b> <b>that</b> I ever heard in my life." [...] Poet John Dryden wrote 10 years later in praise of the play and its comic character Mercutio: [...] "Shakespear show'd {{the best of his}} skill in his Mercutio, and he said himself, that he was forc'd to kill him in the third Act, to prevent being killed by him." [...] Criticism of the play in the 18th century was less sparse, but no less divided. Publisher Nicholas Rowe was the first critic to ponder the theme of the play, which he saw as the just punishment of the two feuding families. In mid-century, writer Charles Gildon and philosopher Lord Kames argued that the play was a failure in that it did not follow the classical rules of drama: the tragedy must occur because of some character flaw, not an accident of fate. Writer and critic Samuel Johnson, however, considered it one of Shakespeare's [...] "most pleasing" [...] plays.|$|E

2500|$|The {{storming}} of Nam O Beach {{took place}} on 8 March 1965 on the coastline around the port of Da Nang in South Vietnam. In the few days preceding the landing, Karch commented that the weather was the <b>worst</b> <b>that</b> he had experienced. When inhabitants of the friendly beach greeted the arriving Marines and photographs were taken, Karch was never seen to smile. When this was queried, he replied [...] "...if I {{had to do it}} over, that picture would have been the same.

2500|$|As the World Bank {{began its}} ten-year {{review of the}} {{transition}} of the former Communist countries to the market economy it unveiled failures of the countries that had followed the International Monetary Fund (IMF) shock therapy policies {{both in terms of}} the declines in GDP and increases in poverty that were even worse than the <b>worst</b> <b>that</b> most of its critics had envisioned {{at the onset of the}} transition. Clear links existed between the dismal performances and the policies that the IMF had advocated, such as the voucher privatization schemes and excessive monetary stringency. [...] Meanwhile, the success of a few countries that had followed quite different strategies suggested that there were alternatives that could have been followed. The US Treasury had put enormous pressure on the World Bank to silence his criticisms of the policies which they and the IMF had pursued.|$|E
2500|$|Former Laker and ESPN analyst Magic Johnson was {{disgusted with}} the Lakers' {{performance}} in Game 4, and stated in the ESPN Game 4 halftime report that the first half was [...] "the <b>worst</b> <b>that</b> I've ever seen the Lakers play {{in a game that}} they need ... like they're already on vacation." [...] During the series, {{it seemed as if the}} Lakers had uncharacteristic problems with closing out their games, something that they are usually famed for. The Lakers were swept for the seventh time in franchise history, but this sweep by the Mavericks is only the second time that the Lakers have been swept with home-court advantage. The Lakers lost by 30-plus points in a playoffs game for the fourth time in franchise history; the Mavericks won over the Lakers with the largest margin of victory in a game that clinched a sweep in the playoffs.|$|E
2500|$|In June, the Anchorage Daily News {{reported}} that {{a federal grand jury}} in Washington, D.C., heard evidence in May about the expansion of Stevens's Girdwood home and other matters connecting Stevens to VECO. [...] In mid-June, FBI agents questioned several aides who work for Stevens as part of the investigation. In July, Washingtonian magazine {{reported that}} Stevens had hired [...] "Washington's most powerful and expensive lawyer", Brendan Sullivan Jr., in response to the investigation. In 2006, during wiretapped conversations with Bill Allen, shortly after the VECO offices were searched and Allen agreed to cooperate with the investigation, Stevens expressed worries over legal complications arising from the sweeping federal investigations into Alaskan politics. [...] "The <b>worst</b> <b>that</b> can happen to us is we run up a bunch of legal fees, and might lose and we might have to pay a fine, might have to serve a little time in jail. I hope to Christ it never gets to that, and I don't think it will," [...] Stevens said. On the witness stand, [...] "Allen testified that VECO staff who had worked on his own house had charged 'way too much,' leaving him uncertain how much to invoice Stevens for when he had his staff work on the senator's house ... that he would be embarrassed to bill Stevens for overpriced labor on the house, and said he concealed some of the expense." ...|$|E
