5|$|Markway becomes {{alarmed at}} Eleanor's {{obsession}} with Hill House {{in spite of}} the dangers it poses for her. Despite Eleanor's pleas to stay, Markway insists that she leave at once and asks Luke to accompany her home. Before he can join her in the car, Eleanor drives off and speeds down the road toward the front gates. She soon feels the steering wheel move by itself and the car advances erratically. At first she struggles to regain control but then surrenders to the unseen force. Suddenly Grace appears from behind a tree and steps in front of the car. Eleanor crashes into the tree and is killed. Luke observes it seemed that Eleanor deliberately aimed the car at the tree, but Markway asserts that something <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> with her. He notes that the tree that claimed Eleanor's life is the same one that killed the first Mrs. Crain. Theo remarks that Eleanor got what she wanted—to remain with the house.|$|E
5|$|Several {{months after}} Belle's death, Aden and Nicole begin a relationship, which becomes {{strained}} when Nicole {{tells him that}} she loves him, but Aden does not return the sentiment. A repentant Aden pays Nicole more attention and {{they are able to}} get their romance back on track. Aden's brother Justin (Matthew Walker) is involved in a car accident, which causes short-term memory loss, but prompts him to admit that he too was abused by their grandfather. He regains his memory, and recalls that Larry <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> {{at the time of the}} accident. He and Aden find their father dead. Convinced that the police will think Justin killed him, Aden decides that they should bury Larry. The police become suspicious nonetheless, and the two are arrested for murder, until a phone call made to Aden's phone from Larry confirms that he caused his own death by irresponsible driving. Justin convinces Aden to move to the city. When Nicole refuses to go with him, he leaves anyway.|$|E

40|$|Consider the {{following}} possible utterances, made by, say, Alison: (1) <b>The</b> keys <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> (2) <b>The</b> keys might <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> (3) I believe <b>the</b> keys <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> (4) Frank believes <b>the</b> keys <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> As many philosophers have noted, (3) functions in many contexts much like (1) or (2). (I {{will discuss the}} nature of such contexts below.) That is, it amounts to a hedged assertion about how things <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world, rather than an autobiographical report {{that would be the}} first-personal counterpart of (4). One tell-tale sign of this <b>is</b> that <b>in</b> these contexts, it is natural for a hearer, say Barack, who knows that the keys could not possibly <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> to respond to (3) with something like (5) No, <b>the</b> keys can’t <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> I had them in my hand when we came in. Barack intuitively disagrees with Alison, even though his utterance is clearly not about her psychological state; hence, her utterance cannot have been about her psychological states either, at least not exclusively. Barack could use just the same utterance to disagree with (1) ...|$|R

Topping continued to visit Hindley in prison, along with her solicitor Michael Fisher and her spiritual counsellor, the Reverend Peter Timms, {{who had been a}} prison governor before resigning to become a minister in the Methodist Church. She made a formal confession to police on 10 February 1987, admitting her involvement in all five murders, but news of her confession was not made public for more than a month. The tape recording of her statement was over 17hours long; Topping described it as a [...] "very well worked out performance in which, I believe, she told me just as much as she wanted me to know, and no more". He also commented that he [...] "was {{struck by the fact that}} she was never there when the killings took place.

2500|$|On July 11, 1936, Hughes {{struck and}} killed a {{pedestrian}} named Gabriel S. Meyer with his car {{at the corner of}} 3rd Street and Lorraine in Los Angeles. After the crash, Hughes was taken to the hospital and certified as sober, but an attending doctor made a note that Hughes had been drinking. A witness to the crash told police that Hughes was driving erratically and too fast, and that Meyer had been standing in the safety zone of a streetcar stop. Hughes was booked on suspicion of negligent homicide and held overnight in jail until his attorney, Neil S. McCarthy, obtained a writ of habeas corpus for his release pending a coroner's inquest. By the time of the coroner's inquiry, however, the witness had changed his story and claimed that Meyer had moved directly in front of Hughes' car. Nancy Bayly (Watts), who <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> with Hughes {{at the time of the}} crash, corroborated this version of the story. On July 16, 1936, Hughes was held blameless by a coroner's jury at the inquest into Meyer's death.
