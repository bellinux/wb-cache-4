The equipments which have been investigated are: The Alvheim/ 3 rd party Inlet separator The 2 nd stage separator The produced <b>water</b> <b>degassing</b> drum Glycol Flash Drum Cargo tanks It is concluded {{that it is not}} sufficient to only consider the gas blowby case without including the effect of closed outlets due to high pressure. It seems that the EPCI contractor has not included closed outlet when sizing the PSVs for a gas blowby scenario. The PSVs for Alvheim/ 3 rd party Inlet separator and Glycol Flash drum are verified in this report by conservative calculations and simulations assuming a gas blowby scenario with closed outlets. The conservative computation does not verify that the PSVs for the 2 nd stage separator, the produced <b>water</b> <b>degassing</b> drum and the cargo tanks are sized for gas blowby. However, the dynamic simulation shows that the conservative scenarios are too conservative. The trivial dynamic simulation shows that the PSVs for the 2 nd stage separator are large enough to handle a gas blowby scenario with closed outlets. In spite of this result it is recommended that a more detailed dynamic simulation is to be designed to verify sufficient PSV capacity for these scenarios.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Irreversible <b>water</b> <b>degassing,</b> {{connected}} with periodic en-trapment of pore air and formation of bubbles after the wetting of unsaturated sediments, {{followed by the}} subsequent release of air from the bubbles after the sediments dry, is proposed as a possible mecha-nism for the precipitation of calcium carbonate in the vadose zone. The process involves an initial stage during rainy periods, when pore air may be entrapped due to preferential water flow in large pores. Equil-ibration of the water–air system causes pressure in the entrapped-air bubbles to decrease to a value close to the sum of atmospheric and capillary pressure (40 – 95 % of atmospheric pressure). This pressure decrease leads to degassing of pore water adjacent to the bubbles, bub-ble expansion, and {{a shift in the}} equilibrium of all aqueous reactions involving dissolved gases. In particular, the degassing must accelerate carbonate precipitation. A second stage develops when entrapped air is released during low...|$|E
40|$|The {{potential}} for cavitation within reverse osmosis (RO) membranes was investigated {{by studying the}} effects of feed <b>water</b> <b>degassing</b> on RO desalination. Initial experiments, conducted using a laboratory-scale RO desalinator, {{and a range of}} NaCl feed solutions, showed a permeate flux increase of 3 - 5 %, on average, upon feed solution degassing. These positive results led to the design and construction, with commercial support, of an industrial pilot-scale RO desalination system. Industrially prepared seawater feed was used, and operating conditions were chosen to reproduce, as closely as possible, those of industrial seawater RO installations. Upon pressure release by restricted flow, from 10 - 60 bar to ambient pressure, cavitation was always observed when dissolved gases were present, but never with a degassed feed. Several RO membranes were found to be slightly hydrophobic, some with considerable surface heterogeneity, which supported the view that cavitation may occur within RO membranes. However, no permeate flux enhancement was observed with the pilot system, at degassing level of about 99 %, for feed pressures in the range 38 - 55 bar. 	In a study of osmotic distillation, {{it was found that the}} water flux, from pure water to NaCl solutions at various concentrations, correlated almost perfectly with the variation in solution vapour pressure with salt concentration. This process may be useful for the direct experimental measurement of osmotic pressures, and the determination of partial molar volumes of water in aqueous solutions. 	Simple asymmetric glass filter membranes were fabricated by fusing successive layers of different sized Ballotini beads. The filters were found to have predictable size-exclusion properties and good back-flushing tolerance. The simple fabrication process required only cheap, common resources. The filters proved capable of filtering a highly fouling suspension of organic waste in water, and recovered their initial flow rate upon back-flushing. 	Several studies were also conducted into some of the physical properties of water. High degassing levels were achieved by a simple boiling method. Degassed water was found to resist freezing, and supercool much more than atmospherically equilibrated water. The oxidation-reduction potential of water did not vary significantly upon degassing.

Substantial amounts of GHGs release from the tropical reservoirs, especially methane (CH 4) from Brazil’s Amazonian areas. CH 4 contributes strongly to climate change because it has a global warming potential (GWP) 24 times higher than carbon dioxide (CO 2) on a per molecule basis over a 100 -year time horizon. GHGs may emit from reservoirs through four different pathways to the atmosphere: (1) diffusive flux at the reservoir surface, (2) gas bubble flux in the shallow zones of a reservoir, (3) <b>water</b> <b>degassing</b> flux at the outlet of the powerhouse downstream of turbines and spillways, and (4) flux across the air–water interface in the rivers downstream of the dams. This paper reviewed the productions and emissions of CH 4, CO 2, and N 2 O in reservoirs, and the environmental variables influencing CH 4 and CO 2 emissions were also summarized. Moreover, the paper combined with the progress of GHG emissions from Three Gorges Reservoir and proposed three crucial problems to be resolved on GHG emissions from reservoirs at present, which would be benefit to estimate the total GHG emissions from Three Gorges Reservoir accurately...|$|E

The extent of horizontal flow component {{and the response}} of drip water chemistry to recharge events were examined in the Moravian Karst (Czech Republic), while the character of water flow and its chemistry were studied in salt diapirs in southeastern part of the Zagros mountains (Iran). Under the conditions of well-developed epikarst, the horizontal flow component, defined as Hmax/T (Hmax = horizontal migration component, T - thickness of VZ) typically reaches values of 0. 1 - 0. 6 (Moravian and Slovenian Karst). However, in areas where epikarst was stripped off by glacial or human activity, the proportion of horizontal flow component is far greater (Hmax/T 1. 6 - 24).

A simple method is proposed for correcting gas concentration and isotope composition for <b>water</b> <b>degassing.</b> In doing so, the isotope and elemental (C, He) composition of gases is homogeneous for the two volcanoes.

These similarities suggest comparable volatile history for the respective mantle sources, the main differences being in the relative proportions of radiogenic 4 He. In detail, Hot Spots appear enriched in C having a light composition with respect to MORB, possibly due to the addition of a C-rich (e. g. subducted) component, in addition to a relatively undegassed, 3 He-rich, component. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{nature of}} cave {{ventilation}} {{is of interest}} to cavers, speleologists, and paleoclimatologists working with stalagmites. Because cave ventilation systematics may change over the growth span of a stalagmite, understanding what factors affect them is critical for determining events that may have affected climate proxies within the stalagmite. Similarly, understanding how the hydrology of the drips feeding a stalagmite evolves through time is key to building robust records of paleoclimate, particularly because stalagmite records have become critical archives of climate change information of the last 500, 000 years. Here we present data from an extensive, on-going monitoring effort at Yok Balum Cave, Belize, initiated in 2011, that characterizes high-resolution ventilation dynamics at this site. Clear seasonal ventilation regimes exist, driven by thermally induced inside-outside air density differences. The winter regime is dominated by air inflow into the cave, decreased drawdown from the epikarst into the cave, and a limited diurnal signal. Conversely, summer ventilation is dominated by air outflow from the cave, greater CO 2 drawdown and drip <b>water</b> <b>degassing,</b> and a strong diurnal signal. Active monitoring during a large (M 7. 4) earthquake in November 2012 provides {{a unique opportunity to}} assess the response of the cave atmosphere and hydrology to substantial seismic activity. Cave atmosphere dynamics and hydrology are found to be highly resilient to seismic activity, with no observable disturbance occurring around the earthquake, despite there being considerable evidence of physical disruption in the cave. Monitoring included different kinds of drips, and the earthquake affected none of the monitored drip types. This suggests that stalagmite-derived paleoclimate records are not affected by seismic activity, except in extreme cases where the stalagmite or conjugate stalactite is damaged or reoriented...|$|E

40|$|The maximum {{specific}} {{hydraulic conductivity}} (kmax) {{of a plant}} sample {{is a measure of}} the ability of a plants’ vascular system to transport water and dissolved nutrients under optimum conditions. Precise measurements of kmax are needed in comparative studies of hydraulic conductivity, as well as for measuring the formation and repair of xylem embolisms. Unstable measurements of kmax are a common problem when measuring woody plant samples and it is commonly observed that kmax declines from initially high values, especially when positive water pressure is used to flush out embolisms. This study was designed to test five hypotheses that could potentially explain declines in kmax under positive pressure: (i) non-steady-state flow; (ii) swelling of pectin hydrogels in inter-vessel pit membranes; (iii) nucleation and coalescence of bubbles at constrictions in the xylem; (iv) physiological wounding responses; and (v) passive wounding responses, such as clogging of the xylem by debris. Prehydrated woody stems from Laurus nobilis (Lauraceae) and Encelia farinosa (Asteraceae) collected from plants grown in the Fullerton Arboretum in Southern California, were used to test these hypotheses using a xylem embolism meter (XYL'EM). Treatments included simultaneous measurements of stem inflow and outflow, enzyme inhibitors, stem-debarking, low water temperatures, different <b>water</b> <b>degassing</b> techniques, and varied concentrations of calcium, potassium, magnesium, and copper salts in aqueous measurement solutions. Stable measurements of kmax were observed at concentrations of calcium, potassium, and magnesium salts high enough to suppress bubble coalescence, as well as with deionized water that was degassed using a membrane contactor under strong vacuum. Bubble formation and coalescence under positive pressure in the xylem therefore appear to be the main cause for declining kmax values. Our findings suggest that degassing of water is essential for achieving stable and precise measurements of kmax through woody plant samples. For complete rehydration of woody samples, incubation in water under vacuum for 24 h is suggested as a reliable technique that avoids bubble problems associated with flushing under high positive pressure...|$|E
40|$|Rhyolites (> 72 wt% SiO 2) are {{the most}} {{differentiated}} magmas on Earth, and they also constitute the most voluminous (1000 ’s of km 3) explosive eruptions on Earth {{over the last several}} million years. Understanding their origin is of considerable interest because their formation fundamentally re-constitutes and differentiates continental crust. However, the primary mechanism by which rhyolites form on Earth, whether by crystal fractionation from a cooling intermediate (60 - 70 wt% SiO 2) magma body or by partial melting of the crust, is highly controversial and strongly debated in the literature. A key to understanding the origin of rhyolites is to first obtain information on their temperatures, melt water concentrations, oxidation states, and depths of segregation from their source regions, all of which can be gleaned from thermodynamic analysis of the various mineral phases that crystallize from these highly-evolved melts. A second goal is to determine the driving force for crystallization, whether by cooling in an isobaric magma chamber within the crust, or by the progressive loss of dissolved <b>water</b> (<b>degassing)</b> during magma ascent to the surface. In this thesis, the first study is an electron microprobe investigation of six, phenocryst-poor (< 6 %) rhyolite samples, each erupted as glassy obsidian, in which their pre-eruptive temperatures (780 - 940 °C), oxidation states, and melt H 2 O concentrations (2 - 6 wt%) are all determined. Second, with the pre-eruptive oxidation state known for each sample, a comparison with their post-eruptive oxidation state is made to test the effect of H 2 O degassing on the oxidation state of these iron-poor magmas. Contrary to what is often argued in the literature, {{there is no evidence that}} H 2 O degassing alters the oxidation state of rhyolites. Third, a series of phase-equilibrium and decompression experiments on three obsidian samples were conducted under H 2 O fluid-saturated conditions. These experiments permit a test of whether the wide compositional range of plagioclase (≤ 40 mol% An), which is remarkable given their low overall abundance (< 3 %) in the natural obsidian samples, crystallized because of cooling or because of the effect of rapid H 2 O degassing. Finally, these hydrous phase-equilibrium experiments are combined with those from the literature to calibrate the first plagioclase-liquid hygrometer applicable to rhyolites...|$|E
40|$|The 2007 caldera-forming {{eruption}} of Piton de la Fournaise (PdF) erupted the largest volume of magma (210 Mm 3) recorded at this volcano {{in at least}} three centuries. Major and trace element and Sr-Nd isotope data for bulk-rocks, groundmasses and olivine phenocrysts have been combined with melt inclusion data (major, trace and volatile elements) to track magma evolution over the whole eruptive sequence. We show that each eruptive phase had a distinctive geochemical and petrological signature and that caldera collapse on 5 April was preceded by a marked shift in bulk magma composition and crystal content and size. Aphyric basalt erupted {{at the beginning of the}} sequence (February 2007) had relatively high Sr isotope ratio (87 Sr/ 86 Sr = 0. 70420 - 0. 704180) and low Nd isotopic ratio (143 Nd/ 144 Nd = 0. 51285 - 0. 51286). Olivine-basalts extruded on 2 - 5 April just before caldera collapse are less enriched in radiogenic Sr (87 Sr/ 86 Sr = 0. 70412 - 0. 70416), but characterized by the same Nd isotopic composition. This magma is interpreted as a new deep input, which pressurized the shallow PdF plumbing system and triggered the 2007 activity. Post-collapse oceanite lavas represent the main volume of magma extruded in 2007. Their bulk-rocks and groundmasses have 87 Sr/ 86 Sr (~ 0. 70418) intermediate between those of February and 5 April, and similar to those of the March 2007 and 2001 - 2006 lavas. We show that the Steady State Basalts (SSB) commonly erupted at PdF are hybrid melts, which result from multistep mixing between 'alkaline' and 'transitional' end-members. Our results lead us to propose a new model of the PdF plumbing system to reconcile the petrological, geochemical and geophysical observations: (1) the shallow portion (above sea level) of the PdF plumbing system hosts several small sills, in which magma experiences variable degrees of degassing, cooling and crystallization; (2) oceanite lavas result from the withdrawal of shallow harrisitic mushes stored at low pressures (< 48 MPa; < 1800 - 2400 m depth) below both the volcano summit and its eastern flank; (3) <b>water</b> <b>degassing</b> plays a major role in fast magma crystallization at shallow depths. Multistep ascent and periodic extrusion of the shallow magmas is promoted by injections of deeper and hotter basaltic magma, containing up to 1. 3 wt % H 2 O and 1630 ppm S. In 2007, the new deep input was the ultimate source of the large excess in sulfur degassing detected by satellites. Lateral draining and intrusion of magma below the eastern flank of the volcano are the cause of major volcano deformation, flank sliding and summit caldera collapse. © The Author 2014.

40|$|Mantle {{degassing}} is {{a fundamental}} process that modifies the chemical composition of the atmosphere, crust, and deep Earth. Elements are returned to the mantle from surface reservoirs through subduction at convergent margins. Melts generated in the mantle carry dissolved volatiles from depth and upon decompression exsolve a fluid or vapour phase. These volatiles drive explosive eruptions, change climate, and form economic metal deposits. Thus, the sources and processes involved in degassing of the mantle and melts are a crucial topic in geochemistry. This dissertation is composed of four chapters, each contributing original and new insights into sources and processes involved in mantle degassing. Chapters 1 and 2 focus on volatiles and the origin of carbon-rich magmatic emissions in the East African Rift, which is perhaps the least understood tectonic system on Earth in terms of mantle degassing. East Africa hosts a diverse array of enigmatic magma compositions, best exemplified by Oldoinyo Lengai volcano in Tanzania, {{which is the only}} active carbonatite volcano on Earth and an important alkaline endmember magmatic system. In Chapter 1 (published in Earth and Planetary Sciences in January, 2013) we show that nephelinite melts at Oldoinyo Lengai are the most carbon-rich natural silicate melts known to science. However, we argue that the mantle source for these melts is not unusually rich in carbon. Rather, extreme degrees of fractional crystallization and the high carbon solubility in these alkali-rich melts are responsible for the high observed carbon contents. We also show that the Oldoinyo Lengai magmatic system is rich in water, contrary to prior assumption, and that <b>water</b> <b>degassing</b> plays a fundamental role in the eruptive behaviour and magmatic evolution at Oldoinyo Lengai. The appendix to Chapter 1 contains additional data (including carbon, oxygen,and sulfur isotope compositions and assessment of sulfur behaviour in the magma system) from Oldoinyo Lengai that have not been published. 	 Chapter 2 presents the first bulk gas and nitrogen isotope compositions from the Rungwe Volcanic Province, which is the southernmost volcanic manifestation of rifting in East Africa. In this paper (currently in press in Chemical Geology), we show that the gases emitted at Rungwe are CO 2 -rich, presenting a hazard to the inhabitants of this fertile and thus heavily populated area. We find that the gas compositions record high temperatures in the deeper hydrothermal system, which could be a valuable geothermal resource for local economic development. The nitrogen isotope compositions and gas ratio tracers are consistent with an upper mantle source for the gases, and this signature is strongest in {{the central part of the}} province where the intersection of deep crustal structures provide direct conduits for mantle degassing. Interestingly, the mantle signatures are associated with the lowest temperature emissions in the region. The structures provide conduits for melts as well as gases, leading to the coincidence of mantle gas emission and volcanic edifice building in the central Rungwe Volcanic Province. These high elevation mountains are the recharge zones for the shallow aquifer and the mantle gases thus equilibrate with cold meteoric water close to the surface. Chapters 3 and 4 are studies of S degassing at rift and arc volcanoes through the use of S isotopes. Sulfur is extremely important for eruption prediction because SO 2 is the only gas routinely measured remotely at active volcanoes. Explosive eruptions can inject large quantities of S into the stratosphere where it oxidizes to sulfate, which can cause decadal climate cooling. Chapter 3 examines S degassing during an explosive eruption at Anatahan (Mariana Arc) that emitted about 250 ktons of SO 2 in the first ten days of the eruption. The results of this study show that the source of erupted sulfur was from ultimately from the mantle, with little addition from subducted seawater sulfate, or the pre-eruptive hydrothermal system. Sulfur isotopes fractionate during the degassing process, and the change in sulfur isotope compositions through the eruption are consistent with closed system degassing of a magma body. Chapter 4 presents a detailed assessment of the S cycle at persistently degassing basaltic volcanoes. In this study, we constrain the conditions of degassing (oxygen fugacity, temperature) as rigorously as possible to utilize S isotope compositions of gases and melts to address equilibrium versus non-equilibrium degassing and Earth’s sulfur cycle. We find that S degassing is not an equilibrium process and that S partitioning into the gas phase is associated with a kinetic fractionation effect reflected in the S isotope compositions. Erta Ale, a reduced magmatic system, convincingly demonstrates a kinetic effect because S 2 - (rather than SO 42 -) is the dominant S species in the melt. Equilibrium degassing should result in preferential partitioning of the heavy S isotope into the gas, however we observe that the gas is isotopically lighter than the melt. This is consistent with faster diffusion of the light isotope. At Masaya, an oxidized magmatic system, the equilibrium and kinetic isotope fractionation effects both favor isotopically light gas, which makes the contributions from equilibrium versus kinetic effects more ambiguous. However, under steady state conditions the gas phase is representative of the sulfur isotope composition of the source and the isotope composition of gas from Masaya indicates recycling of oxidized S through the subduction zone. Mass balance calculations show that only a small fraction of the S subducted at the Central American arc is returned to surface reservoirs. However, the flux of oxidized S from the subducted slab is high enough to rapidly oxidize iron in the mantle wedge, providing an explanation why arc magmas are more oxidized than those at rifts. Finally, the S retained in the subducted slab is isotopically light, potentially carrying the signature of microbial life into the deep mantle.

40|$|Microbubbles {{produced}} by exposing water-immersed metallic nanoparticles to resonant light {{play an important}} role in emerging and efficient plasmonic-enhanced processes for catalytic conversion, solar energy harvesting, biomedical imaging, and cancer therapy. How do these bubbles form, and what is their gas composition? In this paper, the growth dynamics of nucleating bubbles around laser-irradiated, water-immersed Au plasmonic nanoparticles are studied to determine the exact origin of the occurrence and growth of these bubbles. The microbubbles' contact angle, footprint diameter, and radius of curvature were measured in air-equilibrated <b>water</b> (AEW) and <b>degassed</b> <b>water</b> (DGW) with fast imaging. Our experimental data reveals that the growth dynamics can be divided into two regimes: an initial bubble nucleation phase (regime I, < 10 ms) and, subsequently a bubble growth phase (regime II). The explosive growth in regime I is identical for AEW and DGW due to the vaporization of water. However, the slower growth in regime II is distinctly different for AEW and DGW, which is attributed to the uptake of dissolved gas expelled from the water around the hot nanoparticle. Our scaling analysis reveals that the bubble radius scales with time as R(t) alpha t(1 / 6) for both AEW and DGW in the initial regime I, whereas in the later regime II it scales as R(t) alpha t(1 / 3) for AEW and is constant for perfectly <b>degassed.</b> <b>water.</b> These scaling relations are consistent with the experiments...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} the relative role of aspired air and a plant-induced {{reaction in the}} vascular occlusion of dry-stored cv. Cassa chrysanthemum flowers (Chrysanthemum × morifolium Ramat). Measurements of hydraulic capacity showed that the air that is aspired directly after cutting (into the opened xylem conduits) was solely responsible for the blockage that developed during the first 1 ¿ 2 h after cutting. The obstruction to water flow was not reversed when the flowering stems were placed in water, unless the <b>water</b> was <b>degassed.</b> Holding the cut stems or stem segments dry for a period longer than 2 h resulted in an additional decrease of hydraulic capacity, which was not reversed by placing the stems in <b>degassed</b> <b>water.</b> This blockage was still present in stem segments from which air was removed by vacuum infiltration. The second blockage became more serious upon increasing {{the length of the}} dry period. It was prevented by a pulse treatment of the cut stems with tropolone, shortly after harvest, suggesting that it was due to an enzymatic reaction in the stems. Taken together with previous data, it is concluded that the relative role of aspired air and a plant-induced process depends on the cultivar and on the pre-harvest growth conditions of the plants...|$|R
