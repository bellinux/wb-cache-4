Similarly, former ambassador to the People's Republic of China, Jon Huntsman stated that [...] "Kim Jong Il was a conscienceless tyrant. His death closes a tragic chapter for the people of North Korea and offers them the best opportunity to get on a path towards a more free and open society and political reform". Governor of Texas Rick Perry said that [...] "The death of vicious dictator Kim Jong Il provides some cause for hope but does not automatically end the reign of inhumane tyranny he and his father constructed". He then also expressed hope that Kim's death would usher in [...] "a peaceful transition from a grim dictatorship to a free Korea". The Workers World Party sent a message to the Korean Workers Party. It stated in part that [...] "We here in “the belly of the beast” know how difficult the US imperialist rulers have made it for leaders of truly sovereign countries to defend their sovereignty while pursuing the socialist path of development". The US Marxist-Leninist Organization also sent condolences, stating that the work and stands of Kim and the KWP [...] "vital contributions not only to the Korean people but all the world’s peoples...The untimely passing of Kim Jong Il is a great loss to the world anti-imperialist and democratic forces and the world communist movement". The Workers Party, USA sent a message of condolence stating [...] "We remember with great respect the life of Kim Jong Il who fought unsparingly to his last breath for the cause of peace, national independence and social progress. Kim Jong Il led the DPRK during a time in which U.S. imperialism maintained...a state of war against Korea and carried out all-around economic, political, diplomatic, cultural and military pressure against the DPRK in the north of Korea while occupying the south with tens of thousands of troops".|$|E

This made us change our resolution, and resolve to fall upon them in the night, if we could give them one volley undiscovered. This we had a fair opportunity to do, by one of the two Englishmen leading us round, between the woods and the sea-side westward, and turning short south, came privately to a place where the thickest of them were. Unheard and unperceived, eight of us fired among them, and did dreadful execution; and in half a minute after, eight more of us let fly, killing and wounding abundance of them; and then dividing ourselves into three bodies, eight persons in each body we marched from among the trees, to the very teeth of the enemy, sending forth the greatest shouts and acclamations. The savages hearing a different noise from three quarters at once, stood in the utmost confusion; but coming in sight of us, let fly a volley of arrows, which wounded poor old Friday, yet happily it did not prove mortal. We did not, however, give them a second opportunity; but rushing in among them, we fired three several ways, and then fell to <b>work</b> <b>with</b> <b>our</b> swords, staves, hatchets, and the butt-end of our muskets, with a fury not to be resisted; so that with the most dismal screaming and howling they had recourse to their feet, to save their lives by a speedy flight.

6000|$|What refuge then in self-education; {{when a man}} feels himself {{powerless}} in the gripe of some unseen {{and inevitable}} power, and knows not whether it be chance, or necessity, or a devouring fiend? To wrap himself sternly in himself, and cry, [...] "I will endure, though all the universe be against me;"--how fine it sounds!--But who has done it? Could a man do it perfectly but for one moment,--could he absolutely and utterly for one moment isolate himself, and accept his own isolation as a fact, he were then and there a madman or a suicide. As it is, his nature, happily too weak for that desperate self-assertion, falls back recklessly on some form, more or less graceful according to the temperament, of the ancient panacea, [...] "Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die."

No. There is but one escape, one chink through which we may see light; one rock on which our feet may find standing-place, even in the abyss: {{and that is the}} belief, intuitive, inspired, due neither to reasoning nor to study, that the billows are God's billows; and that though we go down to hell, He is there also;-- the belief that not we, but He, is educating us; that these seemingly fantastic and incoherent miseries, storm following earthquake, and earthquake fire, as if the caprice of all the demons were let loose against us, have in His Mind a spiritual coherence, an organic unity and purpose (though we see it not); that sorrows do not come singly, only because He is making short <b>work</b> <b>with</b> <b>our</b> spirits; and because the more effect He sees produced by one blow, the more swiftly He follows it up by another; till, in one great and varied crisis, seemingly long to us, but short enough compared with immortality, our spirits may be-- ...|$|E
6000|$|It is {{sometimes}} true, that sunshine comes after storm. Sometimes true--or who could live?--but not always. Equally true {{that in most}} human lives there are periods of trouble, blow following blow, wave following wave, from opposite and unexpected quarters, till all God's billows have gone over the soul. How paltry and helpless in such dark times are all proud attempts to hang self-poised in {{the centre of the}} abyss, and there organise for oneself a character by means of circumstances. Easy enough it seems for a man to educate himself without God while he lies comfortably in idleness on a sofa. But what if he found himself hurled perforce among the real universal experiences of humanity; and made free in spite of himself, by doubt and fear and horror of great darkness, of the brotherhood of woe, common alike to the simplest peasant woman, and to every great soul, who has left his impress upon the hearts of after generations? Jew, Heathen, or Christian; men of the most opposite creeds and aims--whether it be Moses or Socrates, Isaiah or Epictetus, Augustine or Mohammed, Dante or Bernard, Shakespeare or Bacon--each and all of them have this one fact in common--that once in their lives, at least, they have gone down into the bottomless pit, and there out of the utter darkness have asked the question of all questions--"Is there a God? and if there be, what is He doing with me?"

6000|$|But {{though this}} quality of {{industry}} {{is essential to}} an artist, it does not in anywise make an artist; many people are busy, whose doings are little worth. Neither does sensibility make an artist; since, as I hope, many can feel both strongly and nobly, who yet care nothing about art. But the gifts which distinctively mark the artist--without which he must be feeble in life, forgotten in death--with which he may {{become one of the}} shakers of the earth, and one of the signal lights in heaven--are those of sympathy and imagination. I will not occupy your time, nor incur the risk of your dissent, by endeavouring to give any close definition of this last word. We all have a general and sufficient idea of imagination, and of its <b>work</b> <b>with</b> <b>our</b> hands and in our hearts: we understand it, I suppose, as the imaging or picturing of new things in our thoughts; and we always show an involuntary respect for this power, wherever we can recognize it, acknowledging it to be a greater power than manipulation, or calculation, or observation, or any other human faculty. If we see an old woman spinning at the fireside, and distributing her thread dexterously from the distaff, we respect her for her manipulation--if we ask her how much she expects to make in a year, and she answers quickly, we respect her for her calculation--if she is watching {{at the same time that}} none of her grandchildren fall into the fire, we respect her for her observation--yet for all this she may still be a commonplace old woman enough. But if she is all the time telling her grandchildren a fairy tale out of her head, we praise her for her imagination, and say, she must be a rather remarkable old woman. Precisely in like manner, if an architect does his working-drawing well, we praise him for his manipulation--if he keeps closely within his contract, we praise him for his honest arithmetic--if he looks well to the laying of his beams, so that nobody shall drop through the floor, we praise him for his observation. But he must, somehow, tell us a fairy tale out of his head beside all this, else we cannot praise him for his imagination, nor speak of him as we did of the old woman, as being in any wise out of the common way, a rather remarkable architect. It seemed to me, therefore, as if it might interest you to-night, if we were to consider together what fairy tales are, in and by architecture, to be told--what there is for you to do in this severe art of yours [...] "out of your heads," [...] as well as by your hands.|$|E
