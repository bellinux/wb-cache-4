40|$|Microbial {{contamination}} of dental unit <b>waterlines</b> {{is thought to}} be the result of biofilm formation within the small-bore tubing used for these conduits. Systematic sampling of 121 dental units located at the dental school of Université de Montréal showed that none of the <b>waterlines</b> was spared from bacterial contamination. Multilevel statistical analyses showed significant differences between samples taken at the beginning of the day and samples taken after a 2 -min purge. Differences were also found between water from the turbine and the air/water syringe. Random variation occurred mainly between measurements (80 %) and to a lesser extent between dental units (20 %). In other analyses, it was observed to take less than 5 days before initial bacterial counts reached a plateau of 2 x 10 (5) CFU/ml in newly installed <b>waterlines.</b> Sphyngomonas paucimobilis, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Methylobacterium mesophilicum, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the predominant isolates. P. aeruginosa showed a nonrandom distribution in dental unit <b>waterlines,</b> since 89. 5 % of the all the isolates were located in only three of the nine clinics tested. Dental units contaminated by P. aeruginosa showed significantly higher total bacterial counts than the others. By comparison, P. aeruginosa was never isolated in tap water remote from or near the contaminated dental unit <b>waterlines.</b> In conclusion, dental unit <b>waterlines</b> should be considered an aquatic ecosystem in which opportunistic pathogens successfully colonize synthetic surfaces, increasing the concentration of the pathogens in water to potentially dangerous levels. The clinical significance of these findings in relation to routine dental procedures is discussed...|$|R

5|$|The {{armoured}} belt {{consisted of}} face-hardened Krupp cemented armour (KC), arranged in three strakes. The main <b>waterline</b> belt was 12inches (305mm) thick between 'A' and 'Y' barbettes and thinned to 5 to 6inches (127 to 152mm) towards the ship's ends, {{but did not}} reach either the bow or the stern. The middle armour belt had a maximum thickness of 7inches (178mm) over the same length as the thickest part of the <b>waterline</b> armour and thinned to five inches abreast 'A' barbette. The upper belt was 5inches thick amidships and extended forward to 'A' barbette, with a short 4-inch (102mm) extension aft.|$|E
5|$|The {{final element}} of the {{protection}} scheme of the first dreadnoughts was the subdivision of the ship below the <b>waterline</b> into several watertight compartments. If the hull were holed—by shellfire, mine, torpedo, or collision—then, in theory, only one area would flood and the ship could survive. To make this precaution even more effective, many dreadnoughts had no doors between different underwater sections, so that even a surprise hole below the <b>waterline</b> need not sink the ship. There were still several instances where flooding spread between underwater compartments.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a trial of}} chlorine dioxide in dental unit <b>waterlines</b> to produce potable quality water.

5|$|New Hampshire {{conducted}} training {{exercises in}} the Atlantic and Caribbean through late 1910. On 1 November that year, she steamed out of Hampton Roads with the Second Battleship Division for a visit to Europe. There, the ships stopped in Cherbourg, France and Weymouth, the United Kingdom. The Division departed Weymouth on 30 December {{and returned to the}} Caribbean for training, before proceeding to Norfolk on 10 March 1911. On 2122 March, New Hampshire conducted gunnery training with the target ship San Marcosthe old battleship in Tangier Sound in Chesapeake Bay. Over the course of the two days of firing, New Hampshire inflicted severe damage to the old ship, sinking her in shallow water. A cursory inspection of the wreck noted that the interior of the ship above the <b>waterline</b> was destroyed and that she had been holed multiple times below the <b>waterline.</b>|$|E

40|$|Environmental {{conditions}} in DU encourage biofilm development. This biofilm may repre-sent a risk for patients and dental staff expo-sed to water and aerosols generated during dental cares, particularly for immunocompro-mised persons. A {{survey was conducted}} on the 175 dental sur-geons of the department of Vienne (France) to investigate the motivations of dental practitio-ners to renew their DU, their awareness levels with respect to infectious risks related to water circulating within DU, and methods used for the maintenance of DU <b>waterlines.</b> These dentists were only partially aware of the need for maintaining DU <b>waterlines.</b> For this maintaining, chemical treatments and purges of pipes were carried out by 88 % and 91. 5 % of dentists respectively; chemical treatments were usually on a continous mode and den-tists seemed to have complete confidence in their DU supplier regarding the choice and the use of chemical treatments. Flushes were performed only once per day in most cases (63 %). This survey also highlighted that den-tists were not enough aware of water related infectous risk, even though 68 % estimated that the development of a biofilm within DU <b>waterlines</b> was an actual risk. Finally, very po-sitively, dentists strongly indicated their wish to be more informed regarding all these risks. Although these results are based on a relati-vely small sample, corresponding to dentists of a French department, they clearly suggest that awareness of dental surgeons is still in-sufficient and must be performed to permit an effective prevention of infectious risk related to DU <b>waterlines...</b>|$|R

40|$|Context. Dental unit <b>waterlines</b> may {{be heavily}} {{contaminated}} with microorganisms {{and are a}} potential source of infection for both practicing staff and immunocompromised patients particularly. Contamination of dental unit water lines could be inhibited {{with the use of}} disinfectants. The present study investigates the effect of aloe-vera-based disinfectant in reducing the microbial growth in dental unit water lines (DUWLs). Aims. To compare the efficacy of aloe vera, hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2), and 5 % sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) in controlling microbial contamination of DUWLs. Materials and Methods. After obtaining baseline water samples, the dental unit <b>waterlines</b> were treated with aloe vera, 10 % hydrogen peroxide, and 5 % sodium hypochlorite. Each of the three disinfectants was used in increasing concentrations and their inhibiting effect was compared. Water samples were analyzed for microbiological quality by the total viable count (TVC) method. Statistical Analysis Used. SPSS 16. Results. There was significant reduction in mean CFU/ml when treated with disinfectants each for a period of one week. Aloe-vera solution was found to be the most effective in reducing the microbial colonies. Conclusions. Improving the water quality from dental unit water lines is of considerable importance; chemical-based disinfectants can be replaced with herbal disinfectants for treating microbial contamination in dental unit <b>waterlines...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background: Contamination {{of dental}} unit <b>waterlines</b> is a {{well-known}} issue {{in the field of}} dentistry. Objectives: This study was designed to evaluate contamination of dental unit <b>waterlines</b> by common gram positive and negative bacteria in Qazvin’s dental school during the year 2012. Materials and Methods: This survey was performed on 24 dental units routinely used in the dental school of the city of Qazvin. Four samples of 100 mL were obtained in sterile bottles from each unit at different work stages as follows: the beginning of daily activity, after flushing for 30 seconds, following two minutes of flushing, and after the end of daily practice. The number of bacterial colonies was determined for each sample and the mean colony number was calculated. Results: Bacterial contamination was found in all 24 units at the beginning of daily activity with a mean colony count of 17850. The number of colonies decreased to 3250 following 30 seconds of flushing in 16 units and later to 1837 after flushing for two minutes in 13 units. In addition, the number of contaminated units at the end of daily activity was 19 with a mean colony number of 11170. Conclusions: Flushing dental unit <b>waterlines</b> are an effective measure in reducing the number of bacterial contaminants.
