60|$|Lane {{observed}} {{two men who}} evidently {{were the}} focus of attention. One was a stranger, very likely a traveling man, {{and at the moment}} he presented a picture of mingled consternation and anger. He was brushing off his clothes <b>while</b> <b>glaring</b> <b>at</b> a little, stout, red-faced man who appeared about to be stricken by apoplexy. This latter was a Colonel Pepper, whose acquaintance Lane had recently made. He was fond of cards and sport, and appeared to be a favorite with the young men about town. Moreover he had made himself particularly agreeable to Lane, in fact to the extent of Lane's embarrassment. At this moment the stranger lost his consternation wholly in wrath, and made a threatening movement toward Pepper. Lane stepped between them just in time to save Pepper a blow.|$|E
5000|$|Once {{the four}} {{encounter}} Sam and Dean, Arthur is unimpressed {{to learn that}} they left survivors. Sam insists the people pursuing them were just soldiers doing their job, though Arthur considers it [...] "unprofessional". Sam, Dean and Castiel head to Mary's car <b>while</b> <b>glaring</b> <b>at</b> Arthur suspiciously. Arthur and Mick watch them drive off and share a knowing look at each other. It is later revealed that Arthur went back and killed all those involved in Sam and Dean's imprisonment, including Agent Rick, Agent Camp, the soldiers and the coroner. Mick reports this while noting that cleaning up loose ends is Arthur's job.|$|E

60|$|It {{was evident}} to Nigel {{that he had}} at length succeeded in opening the flood-gates. The hermit paused {{for a few moments}} and puffed at the meerschaum, <b>while</b> Moses <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> his master with absorbed interest, and pulled at the {{cigarette}} with such oblivious vigour that he drew it into his mouth at last, spat it out, and prepared another. Nigel sat quite silent and waited for more.|$|R
6000|$|She {{answered}} {{as well as}} {{she could}} with the brush held horizontally in her mouth <b>while</b> she <b>glared</b> inhospitably <b>at</b> him. [...] "Well, not much," [...] and then she let him in, and went and lighted her spirit-lamp.|$|R
50|$|House orders Chase {{to search}} Grace's house while House, Wilson, and some unnamed people are playing poker. Chase finds clothes {{that would suggest}} that Grace has a boyfriend, and gets very {{concerned}} after he hears noises outside the door. Via phone, House assures Chase that the boyfriend will not come home, <b>while</b> <b>glaring</b> <b>at</b> Wilson across the poker table. House reasoned that Boyd must have learned of the poker game from Grace, and Grace from Wilson. House then accuses Wilson of having slept with Grace and moved in with her. Wilson, after demanding House tell {{the rest of the}} poker party that his name is not Wilson, storms out. They have a short, angry conversation outside.|$|E
5000|$|Carl tells Seymour Skinner that [...] "Marriage is gonna be great. Now you'll {{have someone}} who'll rub your back - without being asked" [...] <b>while</b> <b>glaring</b> <b>at</b> Lenny, who sighs [...] "Oh, not this again." [...] Carl then {{responds}} [...] "Yes, this again." [...] In one episode, Homer {{runs out of}} gay couples to marry; he speculates that Lenny and Carl might be interested, and Marge responds with [...] "Don't you push them - they've gotta work that out for themselves." [...] In [...] "Treehouse of Horror XVI", Lenny dies and sees the angels in Heaven {{take the form of}} Carl (although they're saying, [...] "Hurry up or we'll be late for work at the plant!"). Once, Chief Wiggum remarks that Lenny's relationship with Carl is on the rocks. In [...] "Fat Man and Little Boy", Homer quotes to Lisa [...] "You and science go together like Lenny and Carl - the science is Carl". In [...] "Marge and Homer Turn a Couple Play", Lenny and Carl see Homer and Marge kiss, prompting Lenny to remark, [...] "Remember when we used to kiss like that [...] [...] [...] with our respective girlfriends?" ...|$|E
60|$|The Hearer took {{advantage}} of this opportunity to slip away from the cavern and escape, and after the King had tired himself out chasing Kaliko he threw himself into his throne and panted for breath, <b>while</b> he <b>glared</b> wickedly <b>at</b> his defiant subject.|$|R
60|$|To {{say that}} both gentlemen turned pale as {{their eyes met}} would not give an {{adequate}} idea of their appearance. Oliver's heart, {{as well as his}} body, when he heard the question and reply, stood still {{as if he had been}} paralysed. This, then, he thought, was the end of all his hopes-- hopes hardly admitted to himself, and never revealed to Rose, except in unstudied looks and tones. For a few moments his face grew absolutely livid, <b>while</b> he <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> his rival.|$|R
5000|$|At Peggy's celebration, she's very vivacious, {{dancing and}} smiling, <b>while</b> Pete <b>glares</b> <b>at</b> her. When she asks him to dance, Pete rejects her, saying [...] "I don't like you like this." [...] He leaves the party, while Peggy tearfully dances to the twist. Meanwhile, Sal meets up with Belle Jolie {{executive}} Elliott {{at a bar}} and restaurant, {{and the two men}} connect with each other. However, when Elliott invites Sal back to his room, Sal reacts in shock upon realizing that Elliot is propositioning him. He denies any attraction and quickly leaves in a huff.|$|R
60|$|When a {{week had}} passed Jed came again. He sold Mattie a stew-pan {{and he would}} not go in to tea this time, but they stood and talked in the yard for the best part of an hour, <b>while</b> Selena <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> them from her kitchen window. Their {{conversation}} was most innocent and harmless, being mainly gossip about what had come and gone during Jed's exile. But Mattie knew that Selena thought that she and Jed were making love to each other in this shameless, public fashion. When Jed went, Mattie, more for Selena's benefit than his, broke off some sprays of honeysuckle and pinned them on his coat. The fragrance went with Jedediah as he drove through Amberley, and pleasant thoughts were born of it.|$|R
5000|$|Kahn {{used the}} T-shaped windows, {{sometimes}} called keyhole windows, {{to maximize the}} amount of natural light within the building <b>while</b> minimizing <b>glare</b> <b>at</b> desk height. Light enters the building mostly through the upper parts of the windows at the ceiling, brightening the rooms indirectly. The narrow, lower parts of the windows permit employees to see outside without letting in too much direct sunlight. Kahn used variations of the keyhole window {{in some of his}} subsequent designs. The use of this type of window spread and [...] "soon became a cliché in the hands of other architects". The interplay of T-shaped window and structure is an architectural highlight of Kahn's design: the structure, which is exposed, determines the placement of the windows, and the windows in turn reveal and illuminate the structure, especially the beams running across the ceiling.|$|R
60|$|Till then he {{had been}} {{standing}} meditative and unthinking, reposeful and hopeless, with a face grim and blank--a sixty-year-old child of the mysterious sea. The thoughts of all his lifetime could have been expressed in six words, but the stir {{of those things that}} were as much part of his existence as his beating heart called up a gleam of alert understanding upon the sternness of his aged face. The flame of the lamp swayed, and the old man, with knitted and bushy eyebrows, stood over the brake, watchful and motionless in the wild saraband of dancing shadows. Then the ship, obedient to the call of her anchor, forged ahead slightly and eased the strain. The cable relieved, hung down, and after swaying imperceptibly to and fro dropped with a loud tap on the hard wood planks. Singleton seized the high lever, and, by a violent throw forward of his body, wrung out another half-turn from the brake. He recovered himself, breathed largely, and remained for a <b>while</b> <b>glaring</b> down <b>at</b> the powerful and compact engine that squatted on the deck at his feet like some quiet monster--a creature amazing and tame.|$|R
60|$|Still in {{the midst}} of an intense silence, the Motombo <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> the {{prostrate}} figure of the Kalubi. For a long <b>while</b> he <b>glared.</b> Then the silence was broken, for the wretched Kalubi sprang from the floor, seized a spear and tried to kill himself. Before the blade touched him it was snatched from his hand, so that he remained standing, but weaponless.|$|R
6000|$|... "Waugh!" [...] exclaimed the red-man, {{sending a}} cloud {{out of his}} mouth with such energy that it seemed like a little cannon-shot, <b>while</b> he <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> his friend like a superannuated owl. [...] "Big Otter thought {{that he was in the}} happy hunting-grounds with his fathers; his heart was so light and his limbs were so strong, but that was only a dream--he was still in this world. Then he took a little more fire-water, and the dream became a reality! He was away with his fathers on the shining plains; he chased the deer with the {{lightness}} of a boy and the strength of a bear. He fought, and his foes fell before his strong arm like snowflakes on the river, but he scalped them not. He could not find them--they were gone. Big Otter was so strong that he had knocked both their lives and bodies into the unknown! He saw his father and his mother--and--his wife and the little one who--died. But he could not speak to them, for the foes came back again, and he fought and took some more fire-water to make him fight better; then the world went on fire, the stars came down from the sky like snow when the wind is high. The Big Otter flew up into the air, and then--forgot--" ...|$|R
6000|$|When she {{had opened}} the door, there appeared, growing in {{the centre of the}} enclosure, the most lovely plant, I should imagine, that man ever saw. It {{measured}} some eight feet across, and the leaves were dark green, long and narrow. From its various crowns rose the scapes of bloom. And oh! those blooms, of which there were about twelve, expanded now in the flowering season. The measurements made from the dried specimen I have given already, so I need not repeat them. I may say here, however, that the Pongo augured the fertility or otherwise of each succeeding year from the number of the blooms on the Holy Flower. If these were many the season would prove very fruitful; if few, less so; while if, as sometimes happened, the plant failed to flower, draught and famine were always said to follow. Truly those were glorious blossoms, standing as high as a man, with their back sheaths of vivid white barred with black, their great pouches of burnished gold and their wide wings also of gold. Then in the centre of each pouch appeared the ink-mark that did indeed exactly resemble the head of a monkey. But if this orchid astonished me, its effect upon Stephen, with whom this class of flower was a mania, may be imagined. Really he went almost mad. For a long <b>while</b> he <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> the plant, and finally flung himself upon his knees, causing Miss Hope to exclaim: ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract – This paper {{describes}} {{methods to}} reduce channel contention during distributed setup of high-speed connections in {{a mesh network}} of Cross-Connects (XCs) [1]. A particular aspect of contention addressed here is when two different connection requests arrive {{on a pair of}} adjacent XCs and they choose the same restoration channels from spare inventory. Such a contention problem {{is often referred to as}} “glare”. This paper gives channel selection methods that considerably reduce <b>glare,</b> <b>while</b> <b>at</b> the same time maintaining large groups of channels (for future high speed connections) across multiple, parallel links. We establish the benefit of our approach in a typical intercity backbone network. As shown in the simulation results, our channel selection mechanism can eliminate almost all the glare compared to the previously known algorithms, “Best-fit ” and “Hi-Lo”.
