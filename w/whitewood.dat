5|$|The vast {{majority}} of South Dakota's natural lakes {{are located in the}} eastern half of the state, and most are the product of the most recent ice age. The title of largest natural lake is somewhat disputed; Lake Thompson is larger than Lake Poinsett, but Lake Poinsett has maintained its current size for a much longer period of time. Other major natural lakes include Lake Kampeska, Waubay Lake, Lake Madison, Lake <b>Whitewood,</b> and Lake Herman. Additionally, two large lakes, Big Stone Lake and Lake Traverse, form part of the border between South Dakota and Minnesota. The continental divide separating the drainage basin of Hudson Bay from that of the Gulf of Mexico is situated between these two lakes.|$|E

25|$|<b>Whitewood</b> v. Wolf is {{the federal}} lawsuit that {{successfully}} challenged the Pennsylvania Marriage Laws, as amended in 1996 to ban same-sex marriage. The district court's decision in May 2014 held that the Marriage Laws violated the Due Process and Equal Protection clauses of the United States Constitution. Same-sex couples immediately sought and received marriage licenses and the decision was not appealed. One county clerk sought repeatedly without success to intervene to defend the law.|$|E
25|$|The French Counts of St Hubert, Saskatchewan {{established}} Rolanderie Ranch and {{a gentleman}} lifestyle at <b>Whitewood,</b> Saskatchewan in 1884. The Counts sought {{to establish a}} number of commercial ventures, including a chicory processing factory, a Gruyere cheese factory, a sugar beet venture and a horse breeding operation. They occasionally socialized with the English colonial outpost of Cannington Manor. In the 1880s Edward Pierce tried to transplant early Victorian living at Cannington Manor in the 1880s, now preserved as Cannington Manor Provincial Park.|$|E
25|$|In 1874, {{during the}} Black Hills Expedition led by Lieutenant Colonel George Armstrong Custer, the {{discovery}} of gold in the region sparked the Black Hills Gold Rush. As prospectors located valuable sources of gold along Deadwood and <b>Whitewood</b> Creeks, thousands more prospectors entered the area looking to stake their claim. In April, 1876, a gold outcropping was discovered near Lead, South Dakota. This gold claim became the Homestake Mine and was {{the primary source of}} the placer gold being mined from the surrounding area. Over the next century, ten percent of the world's gold supply would come from this site.|$|E
25|$|On May 20, 2014, Judge Jones {{ruled in}} <b>Whitewood</b> v. Wolf that Pennsylvania's {{same-sex}} marriage ban is unconstitutional. He applied intermediate scrutiny {{and declared that}} the ban violates the Due Process and Equal Protection clauses of the United States Constitution. The ruling was not stayed and same-sex couples in Pennsylvania could request and receive marriage licenses immediately and marry after a mandatory 3-day waiting period. Anticipating legal maneuvers to stay Jones' ruling, dozens of same-sex couples applied for marriage licenses the same day and some obtained waivers of the state's three-day waiting period. At least one couple managed to celebrate their wedding on May 21.|$|E

2500|$|On June 6, the Schuylkill County {{court clerk}} {{responsible}} {{for responding to}} marriage license applications, Theresa Santai-Gaffney, filed a motion before Judge Jones {{to allow her to}} intervene in the case in her official capacity.

2500|$|On July 3, a {{three-judge panel}} of the Third Circuit summarily affirmed Judge Jones' {{dismissal}} of the Santai-Gaffney's motion to intervene in <b>Whitewood</b> and ordered her appeal dismissed.

2500|$|On July 9, 2013, {{following}} the U.S. Supreme Court decision in United States v.

The case, originally <b>Whitewood</b> v. Corbett, was assigned to Judge John E. Jones III. On July 11, Attorney General Kathleen Kane, a named defendant, {{said that she would}} not defend the statute as she [...] "endorse equality and anti-discrimination laws" [...] and that the statute was [...] "wholly unconstitutional".

2500|$|After the Third Circuit ruling, Santai-Gaffney {{applied for}} a stay of {{judgment}} from U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice Samuel Alito, Circuit Justice for the Third Circuit, docketed sub nom. Santai-Gaffney v. <b>Whitewood,</b> No. 14A19 (July 7, 2014). In her application, the clerk attempted to overcome not only the questions of her interest in intervening and standing to appeal, but that she, as a public official, is suffering irreparable harm. Supreme Court rules also require it probable that four Justices grant certiorari on any question presented {{in order for a}} stay to be granted. The counsel of record in clerk Santai-Gaffney's litigation, as listed in court filings, is the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative Christian nonprofit organization.

2500|$|The {{tulip tree}} has {{impressed}} itself upon popular attention in many ways, and consequently has many common names. The tree's traditional {{name in the}} Miami-Illinois language is [...] "oonseentia". Native Americans so habitually made their dugout canoes of its trunk that the early settlers west of the Appalachian Mountains called it Canoewood. The color of its wood gives it the name <b>Whitewood.</b> In areas near the Mississippi River it is called a poplar {{largely because of the}} fluttering habits of its leaves, in which it resembles trees of that genus. It is sometimes called [...] "fiddle tree," [...] because its peculiar leaves, with their arched bases and in-cut sides, suggest the violin shape. [...] The external resemblance of its flowers to tulips named it the Tulip-tree. In their internal structure, however, they are quite different. Instead of the triple arrangements of stamens and pistil parts, they have indefinite numbers arranged in spirals.|$|E
2500|$|Liriodendron tulipiferaâ€”known as the tulip tree, American tulip tree, tuliptree, tulip poplar, <b>whitewood,</b> fiddletree, and yellow-poplarâ€”is the Western Hemisphere {{representative}} of the two-species genus Liriodendron, and the tallest eastern hardwood. It is native to eastern North America from Southern Ontario and Illinois eastward to southeastern Massachusetts and Rhode Island, and south to central Florida and Louisiana. It can grow to more than [...] in virgin cove forests of the Appalachian Mountains, often with no limbs until it reaches [...] in height, making it a very valuable timber tree. It is fast-growing, without the common problems of weak wood strength and short lifespan often seen in fast-growing species. April marks {{the start of the}} flowering period in the southern USA (except as noted below); trees at the northern limit of cultivation begin to flower in June. The flowers are pale green or yellow (rarely white), with an orange band on the tepals; they yield large quantities of nectar.

60|$|Her figure, {{of medium}} height and broad build, with a {{tendency}} to embonpoint, was reflected by the mirror of her <b>whitewood</b> wardrobe, in a gown made under her own organization, {{of one of those}} half-tints, reminiscent of the distempered walls of corridors in large hotels. She raised her hands to her hair, which she wore a la Princesse de Galles, and touched it here and there, settling it more firmly on her head, and her eyes were full of an unconscious realism, as though she were looking in the face one of life's sordid facts, and making the best of it. In youth her cheeks had been of cream and roses, but they were mottled now by middle-age, and again that hard, ugly directness came into her eyes as she dabbed a powder-puff across her forehead. Putting the puff down, she stood quite still before the glass, arranging a smile over her high, important nose, her chin, (never large, and now growing smaller with the increase of her neck), her thin-lipped, down-drooping mouth. Quickly, not to lose the effect, she grasped her skirts strongly in both hands, and went downstairs.|$|E
60|$|But the railways--the {{wonderful}} railways--told the winter's tale most emphatically. The thirty-ton coal {{cars were}} moving over three thousand miles of track. They grunted and lurched {{against each other}} in the switch-yards, or thumped past statelily at midnight on their way to provident housekeepers of the prairie towns. It was not a clear way either; for the bacon, the lard, the apples, the butter, and the cheese, in beautiful <b>whitewood</b> barrels, were rolling eastwards toward the steamers before the wheat should descend on them. That is the fifth act of the great Year-Play for which the stage must be cleared. On scores of congested sidings lay huge girders, rolled beams, limbs, and boxes of rivets, once intended for the late Quebec Bridge--now so much mere obstruction--and the victuals had to pick their way through 'em; and behind the victuals was the lumber--clean wood out of the mountains--logs, planks, clapboards, and laths, for which we pay such sinful prices in England--all seeking the sea. There was housing, food, and fuel for millions, on wheels together, and never a grain yet shifted of the real staple which men for five hundred miles were threshing out in heaps as high as fifty-pound villas.|$|E
