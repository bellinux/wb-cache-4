500|$|Richard Leakey, who was {{responsible}} for the first major ivory destruction in Kenya in 1989, argues that these acts are primarily about sending a message to foster a public that sees the value in wildlife itself, not its byproducts, and thereby influencing the demand side of the market. In explaining the [...] "enormous impact" [...] that he saw after the 1989 event, Leakey said that [...] "up to that time we'd been losing about three and a half thousand to four thousand elephants a year, and a year later <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>losing</b> at most sixty." [...] Consumer research in China, the world's largest consumer of ivory, showed that many potential buyers have little understanding of the connection between the ivory trade and steep declines in elephant populations. High-profile government events bring the problem to large numbers of people and affirm a government stance for anyone who had been unclear. The events also aim to signal decreasing acceptance and popularity of ivory goods, making them less desirable by lowering their status and shaming individuals, organizations, and institutions who buy, sell, or own the goods. In China, prices fell by nearly half between 2015 and 2016, following the government announcement that it would begin phasing out its domestic ivory trade. According to Hongxiang Huang in a report by NPR, the decline was not likely due to conservation reasons, but because [...] "ne thing that proud Chinese people don't want to be, these days, is behind the times." ...|$|E
500|$|During the trial, {{several of}} the 60 'co-claimants' gave evidence. Eva Mozes Kor who was 10 {{years old when she}} arrived at Auschwitz, testified that she and her twin sister were used for the cruel medical {{experiments}} conducted by Josef Mengele and that she had lost her parents and older sisters in Auschwitz. Kor conversed with and embraced the defendant after giving evidence, while other Holocaust survivors in the courtroom protested against this gesture. Another witness, Max Eisen who was 15 {{years old at the time}} of entry into Auschwitz, described the brutality of the extermination part of the camp, including extracting gold teeth from dead victims. On 12 May 2015, Susan Pollack, an 84-year-old Briton, gave evidence how she was taken from Hungary to Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen; describing the living conditions encountered at Auschwitz, she said: [...] "I was in a barrack with about 800 other girls ... <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>losing</b> weight, we weren’t able to use our minds anymore". On the same day, Ivor Perl, an 83-year-old Briton who was born in Hungary into a religious Jewish family, also gave evidence; Perl testified that he was 12 years old when he arrived at Auschwitz and that he and his brother lost their parents and seven siblings in the Holocaust." [...] In July, Irene Weiss, an 84-year-old survivor from the United States, testified that her family was torn apart on arrival at Auschwitz in May 1944, during the mass deportation of Hungarian Jews and that she had lost both her parents, four siblings and 13 cousins at Auschwitz.|$|E
2500|$|On November 1, 2011 Jakob Dylan {{announced}} that the Wallflowers would be reuniting to release an album, explaining: [...] "I never suggested we were breaking up. [...] We all felt <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>losing</b> the plot a bit and we needed a break. [...] And that year break becomes two years, then becomes three years, {{and before you know}} it five or six years go by pretty quickly. [...] I can't do what I do in the Wallflowers without them. [...] I miss it." [...] In an interview with the St. Joseph News-Press, Dylan stated that the Wallflowers would be getting into the studio in January and the lineup would include Greg Richling on bass, Rami Jaffee on keys, Stuart Mathis on guitar and Fred Eltringham on drums. [...] However, weeks before the Wallflowers began recording, Eltringham left the band to pursue other projects. [...] The band quickly got former Red Hot Chili Peppers and Pearl Jam drummer Jack Irons to join the band. [...] Irons was previously involved in a side project with Wallflowers bassist Richling.|$|E
5000|$|One of Halperin's famous quotes is: [...] The NATO {{doctrine}} <b>is</b> that <b>we</b> {{will fight}} with conventional forces until <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>losing,</b> then <b>we</b> will fight with tactical weapons until <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>losing,</b> and then <b>we</b> will {{blow up the}} world.|$|R

2500|$|The shoot {{took place}} in Arizona during October. The crew were unused to the improvisational, {{on-the-fly}} directing style that Russell implemented. Rather than preparing organized shot lists, Russell preferred to use ideas as they came to him, often asking for longer hours. Early on, some of the crew began to feel a dislike for these methods and Russell along with them. Clooney noted that [...] "there's an element of David that was in way over his head... he was vulnerable and selfish, and it would manifest itself {{in a lot of}} yelling." [...] When Russell's frustration would lead to outbursts, Clooney would take it upon himself to defend crew members and extras, leading to increased tensions. When an extra had an epileptic seizure on set, Clooney ran to his aid while Russell apparently remained indifferent to the matter. Afterward, Clooney criticized Russell for ignoring the incident, though Russell later stated that he was busy setting up a shot some yards away from the extra and was not aware that the extra had suffered a seizure. Another on-set conflict between the two arose while shooting footage on a Humvee with a camera mounted to it. Clooney recalls Russell yelling at the driver to drive faster. Clooney then approached the director, telling him to [...] "knock it off". Russell remembers the incident differently: [...] "The camera broke, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>losing</b> the day and I was upset about that. So I jumped off the truck and I was like, 'Fuck!' I was just kicking the dirt and everything like that. And then George had this big thing about defending the driver, whom I hadn't really said anything to." [...] During the shoot, Clooney was exhausted as he was still shooting ER in Los Angeles three days a week, while working on Three Kings the other four.|$|E
60|$|We {{did not ask}} if we {{had brought}} poor Fischer's luck to any of them. We {{did not wish to}} know. We fully {{believed}} in Satan's desire to do us kindnesses, but <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>losing</b> confidence in his judgment. It was at this time that our growing anxiety to have him look over our life-charts and suggest improvements began to fade out and give place to other interests.|$|E
60|$|It was true, {{and after}} I had {{examined}} the damage I {{found it a}} much graver matter than I had anticipated. Not only was the forced angle at which we were compelled to maintain the bow {{in order to keep}} a horizontal course greatly impeding our speed, but at the rate that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>losing</b> our repulsive rays from the forward tanks it was but a question of an hour or more when we would be floating stern up and helpless.|$|E

40|$|Why should <b>we</b> <b>be</b> {{concerned}} {{about the fate of}} literature as we move from a book culture to a screen culture in the digital age? Not primarily because <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>losing</b> our sense of story, but because <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>losing</b> our sense of the central importance of linguistic narrative. There is a difference. The technologies creating the digital revolution seem to devalue language and increasingly to do away with boundaries, celebrating instead speed and boundless exhilaration. The visual trumps the linguistic, the image and the screen trump the word and the book. As a result, we no longer seem to engage deeply with others or ourselves. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> beginning to move, in other words, from “a reading brain” to “a digital brain,” from a brain capable of deep reading and deep thinking to a brain increasingly addled by spectacle and surface sensation. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>losing</b> our standing as “linguistic beings. ...|$|R

60|$|One great regret we had, {{and that}} was to leave our old camp behind us, not only {{for the sake of the}} stores which {{remained}} there, but even more because <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>losing</b> touch with Zambo, our link with the outside world. However, we had a fair supply of cartridges and all our guns, so, for a time at least, we could look after ourselves, and we hoped soon to have a chance of returning and restoring our communications with our negro. He had faithfully promised to stay where he was, and we had not a doubt that he would be as good as his word.|$|E
60|$|Days passed, {{and not a}} {{word from}} Farrar. The case opened with Mr. Cooke's friends on the front benches. The {{excitement}} it caused has rarely been equalled in that section, but I believe this was due less to its sensational features than to Mr. Cooke, who had an abnormal though unconscious talent for self-advertisement. It became manifest early that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>losing.</b> Our testimony, as I had feared, was not strong enough, although they said we were making a good fight of it. I was racked with anxiety about Farrar; at last, when I had all but given up hope, I received a telegram from him dated at Detroit, saying he would arrive with the doctor that evening. This was Friday, the fourth day of the trial.|$|E
60|$|It was {{a delicious}} supper--hot bread, fried bacon, and black coffee. It was a delicious {{solitude}} we were in, too. Three miles away was a saw-mill and some workmen, {{but there were}} not fifteen other human beings throughout the wide circumference of the lake. As the darkness closed down and the stars came out and spangled the great mirror with jewels, we smoked meditatively in the solemn hush and forgot our troubles and our pains. In due time we spread our blankets in the warm sand between two large boulders and soon feel asleep, careless of the procession of ants that passed in through rents in our clothing and explored our persons. Nothing could disturb the sleep that fettered us, for it had been fairly earned, and if our consciences had any sins on them they had to adjourn court for that night, any way. The wind rose just as <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>losing</b> consciousness, and we were lulled to sleep by the beating of the surf upon the shore.|$|E

6000|$|The Major sent a boat, {{as he had}} promised, to {{take home}} my baggage, while I walked through the forest with my two boys and a guide, about {{fourteen}} miles. For {{the first half of}} the distance there was no path, and we had often to cut our way through tangled rattans or thickets of bamboo. In some of our turnings to find the most practicable route, I expressed my fear that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>losing</b> our way, as the sun being vertical, I could see no possible clue to the right direction. My conductors, however, laughed at the idea, which they seemed to consider quite ludicrous; and sure enough, about half way, we suddenly encountered a little hut where people from Licoupang came to hunt and smoke wild pigs. My guide told me he had never before traversed the forest between these two points; and this is what is considered by some travellers as one of the savage [...] "instincts," [...] whereas it is merely the result of wide general knowledge. The man knew the topography of the whole district; the slope of the land, the direction of the streams, the belts of bamboo or rattan, and many other indications of locality and direction; and he was thus enabled to hit straight upon the hut, in the vicinity of which he had often hunted. In a forest of which he knew nothing, he would be quite as much at a loss as a European. Thus it is, I am convinced, with all the wonderful accounts of Indians finding their way through trackless forests to definite points; they may never have passed straight between the two particular points before, but they are well acquainted with the vicinity of both, and have such a general knowledge of the whole country, its water system, its soil and its vegetation, that as they approach the point they are to reach, many easily-recognised indications enable them to hit upon it with certainty.|$|E

It was a valiant attempt, but it didn't make it. Out of all the songs that came from Trace, we only perform one with any regularity, and that's 'Harness Up'. Occasionally we have been doing 'State of Graceful Mourning'—to me, they're the two highlights of the album." [...] Peno acknowledged the production of Trace might have been too polished.
