500|$|The {{decoding}} of the extraterrestrial message, {{with its}} architectural {{drawings of the}} machine, was created by Ken Ralston and Sony Pictures Imageworks. This is the sixth film collaboration between director Zemeckis and VFX supervisor Ralston. Imageworks created more than 350 visual effects shots, {{using a combination of}} model and miniature shots and digital computer work. On designing the Machine, Zemeckis explained that [...] "The Machine in Sagan's novel was somewhat vague, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>fine</b> for a book. In a movie, though, if you're going to build a giant physical structure of alien design, you have to make it believable." [...] He continued that [...] "it had to be huge, so that the audience would feel like it was bigger than man should be tinkering with. It had to look absolutely real." [...] The machine was then designed by concept artist Steve Burg, reusing a conceptual design he had originally created to appear as the [...] "Time Displacement Device" [...] in [...] in a scene that did not make the final cut.|$|E

[...] A very common choice is κ, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>fine</b> {{as long as it is}} clear that it does not refer to a cumulant. [...] Other choices include γ2, to be similar to the notation for skewness, although sometimes this is instead reserved for the excess kurtosis.|$|E
2500|$|In August 2007 it was {{announced}} that Cornell was going to take over writing New Excalibur, another series with close links to MI: 13, but, over time, the project morphed into a new series. Cornell explained, [...] "I think {{there have been so many}} Excaliburs lately that Nick [...] just wanted to underline that this is a fresh start. And it shows that we have a purpose firmly in mind. And it spotlights Cap, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>fine</b> by me." ...|$|E

2500|$|Many of the {{executives}} {{involved in the}} botched transition and later changes subsequently left NBC. Zucker was fired by Comcast Executive Vice President Steve Burke, but stressed that the late-night conflict was not to blame, but rather Comcast's insistence to install their own team. Marc Graboff opted to leave his contract early that November, as did Gaspin. While O'Brien admitted in 2012 that he occasionally still felt resentment over the events that transpired, he noted that [...] "I had an amazing partnership with NBC and was very disappointed at the outcome, but I didn't feel entitled to Late Night or Tonight or to the TBS show. If you're in this business and haven't experienced profound pain at some point, you're not doing it right. I strongly believe that." [...] He has had no contact with Leno, noting [...] "the odds are we will both leave this Earth without speaking to each other, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>fine.</b> There's really nothing to say. We both know the deal. He knows; I know. I'd rather just forget." ...|$|E
2500|$|She starred with Colin Firth and Jeffrey Dean Morgan in The Accidental Husband, {{a romantic}} comedy where she played a woman who finds herself married while engaged to another man. The film was {{released}} in theaters the UK in 2008, but received a direct-to-video premiere in the US, due to financial problems at distributor Yari Film Group. Also in 2008, she took {{on the role of}} a cocaine addict in the British television drama My Zinc Bed, co-starring Paddy Considine and Jonathan Pryce. In 2009's Motherhood, she starred as a New York City mother whose dilemmas of marriage, work, and self are shown in the trials and tribulations of one pivotal day. Distributed for a limited release to certain parts of the United States only, the independent dramedy garnered just US$93,388 in three weeks of release. [...] The New York Times critic A. O. Scott felt that Thurman's character is [...] "scattered, ambivalent, flaky and inconsistent [...] all of <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>fine,</b> and energetically conveyed by Ms. Thurman. But what are tolerable quirks in a person can be deadly to a narrative [...] the movie stumbles from loose and scruffy naturalism to sitcom tidiness".|$|E
2500|$|Los Angeles Times writer Jeff Weiss {{stated that}} [...] "No Mercy is largely {{consumed}} with penitence and a looming penitentiary sentence". Pitchfork Media's Tom Breihan commented that [...] "Throughout No Mercy, Tip remains an absolutely impeccable rapper, delivering even his lamest pieces of self-help nothingness in masterful clumps of singsong cadence and slurry double-time bounce. I {{get the impression}} that he could still absolutely rip a track to shreds if he could only get himself excited about the prospect. And every so often, No Mercy crackles to life, and we hear flashes of the rap hero Tip could still be". Giving it a 4 out of 10 rating, David Amidon of PopMatters stated that [...] "While peaks and valleys {{can be used in a}} positive sense, the way Tip's offering here dips in and out of quality seems much too violent for most longtime followers to keep up with. There are references to making terrible choices personally, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>fine,</b> but as a musician one assumes a certain responsibility to avoid those professional pitfalls as well". Rolling Stone writer Jody Rosen cited it as T.I.'s desire for redemption takes on gospel overtones and [...] "Make no mistake, T.I. still knows how to throw a party. No Mercy is a sleek pop-rap record: 14 taut, catchy songs with beats from big-name producers and an array of top-flight guests. No Mercy suggests that, among A-list rappers, T.I. is the one with the most well-honed pop sensibility".|$|E

"Our natural barriers, {{while they}} have doubtless saved us from defeat on countless occasions, have {{not by any means}} {{rendered}} us immune from attack," [...] he explained, [...] "for so great is the wealth of Gathol's diamond treasury that there yet may be found those who will risk almost certain defeat in an effort to loot our unconquered city; so thus we find occasional practice in the exercise of arms; but there is more to Gathol than the mountain city.

6000|$|Parini's poem {{is written}} {{in the form of}} {{instructions}} to the hero for the politest disposal of his time; and in a strain of polished irony allots the follies of his day to their proper hours. The poet's apparent seriousness never fails him, but he does not suffer his irony to become a burden to the reader, relieving it constantly with pictures, episodes, and excursions, and now and then breaking into a strain of solemn poetry <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>fine</b> enough. The work will suggest to the English reader the light mockery of [...] "The Rape of the Lock", and in less degree some qualities of Gray's [...] "Trivia"; but in form and manner it is more like Phillips's [...] "Splendid Shilling" [...] than either of these; and yet {{it is not at all}} like the last in being a mere burlesque of the epic style. These resemblances have been noted by Italian critics, who find them as unsatisfactory as myself; but they will serve to make the extracts I am to give a little more intelligible to the reader who does not recur to the whole poem. Parini was not one to break a butterfly upon a wheel; he felt the fatuity of heavily moralizing upon his material; the only way was to treat it with affected gravity, and to use his hero with the respect which best mocks absurdity. One of his arts is to contrast the deeds of his hero with those of his forefathers, of which he is so proud,--of course the contrast is to the disadvantage of the forefathers,--and in these allusions to the past glories of Italy it seems to me that the modern patriotic poetry which has done so much to make Italy begins for the first time to feel its wings.|$|E
