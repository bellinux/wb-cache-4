40|$|We adapted {{a visual}} census method, mainly used in {{demersal}} and reef fish studies, to characterize fish communities associated to drifting fish aggregating devices (FADs) in the Western Indian Ocean. Drifting FAD associated fishes from both equatorial (Seychelles) and tropical waters (Reunion Island) were examined by divers. A total of 32 species (belonging to 16 families) were observed associated with drifting FADs in equatorial waters, and 24 species (14 families) were found around FADs in tropical waters. Twenty species {{were found in}} both regions. The highest number of species observed at a single FAD was 18 (12 +/- 2, mean +/- SD) in equatorial and 13 (10 +/- 3) in tropical waters, not counting circumnatant species loosely associated with the FAD. Some species like Kyphosus vaigiensis, Canthidermis maculata, Elagatis bipinnulata, <b>Acanthocybium</b> <b>solandri</b> and Coryphaena hippurus were observed on {{all or most of}} the surveys. In this study, the contribution in biomass of the 18 common species associated with drifting FADs (but excluding circumnatant species), represents more than 98 % of the biomass.

40|$|Recent {{developments}} in sequencing technologies and bioinformatics analysis provide a {{greater amount of}} DNA sequencing reads at a low cost. Microsatellites are the markers of choice {{for a variety of}} population genetic studies, and high quality markers can be discovered in non-model organisms, such as tuna, with these recent developments. Here, we use a high-throughput method to isolate microsatellite markers in albacore tuna, Thunnus alalunga, based on coupling multiplex enrichment and next-generation sequencing on 454 GS-FLX Titanium pyrosequencing. The crucial minimum number of polymorphic markers to infer evolutionary and ecological processes for this species has been described for the first time. We provide 1670 microsatellite design primer pairs, and technical and molecular genetics selection resulting in 43 polymorphic microsatellite markers. On this panel, we characterized 34 random and selectively neutral markers («neutral») and 9 «non-neutral» markers. The variability of «neutral» markers was screened with 136 individuals of albacore tuna from southwest Indian Ocean (42), northwest Indian Ocean (31), South Africa (31), and southeast Atlantic Ocean (32). Power analysis demonstrated that the panel of genetic markers can be applied in diversity and population genetics studies. Global genetic diversity for albacore was high with a mean number of alleles at 16. 94; observed heterozygosity 66 % and expected heterozygosity 77 %. The number of individuals was insufficient to provide accurate results on differentiation. Of the 9 «non-neutral» markers, 3 were linked to a sequence of known function. The one is located to a sequence having an immunity function (ThuAla-Tcell- 01) and the other to a sequence having energy allocation function (ThuAla-Hki- 01). These two markers were genotyped on the 136 individuals and presented different diversity levels. ThuAla-Tcell- 01 has a high number of alleles (20), heterozygosity (87 - 90 %), and assignment index. ThuAla-Hki- 01 has a lower number of alleles (9), low heterozygosity (24 - 27 %), low assignment index and significant inbreeding. Finally, the 34 «neutral» and 3 «non-neutral» microsatellites markers were tested on four economically important Scombridae species-Thunnus albacares, Thunnus thynnus, Thunnus obesus, and <b>Acanthocybium</b> <b>solandri...</b>|$|R
40|$|The visual {{biology of}} Hawaiian reef fishes was {{explored}} by examining their eyes for spectral sensitivity of their visual pigments and for transmission of {{light through the}} ocular media to the retina. The spectral absorption curves for the visual pigments of 38 species of Hawaiian fish were recorded using microspectrophotometry. The peak absorption wavelength (lambda(max)) of the rods varied from 477 - 502 nm and the lambda(max) of individual species conformed closely to values for the same species previously reported using a whole retina extraction procedure. The visual pigments of single cone photoreceptors were categorized, dependent on their lambda(max) -values, as ultraviolet (347 - 376 nm), violet (398 - 431 nm) or blue (439 - 498 nm) sensitive cones. Eight species possessed ultraviolet-sensitive cones and 14 species violet-sensitive cones. Thus, 47 % of the species examined displayed photosensitivity to the short-wavelength region of the spectrum. Both identical and nonidentical paired and double cones were found with blue sensitivity or green absorption peaks (> 500 nm). Spectrophotometry of the lens, cornea, and humors for 195 species from 49 families found that the spectral composition of the light transmitted to the retina was most often limited by the lens (73 % of species examined). Except for two unusual species with humor-limited eyes, <b>Acanthocybium</b> <b>solandri</b> (Scombridae) and the priacanthid fish, Heteropriacanthus cruentatus, the remainder had corneal-limited eyes. The wavelength at which 50 % of the light was blocked (T 50) was classified according to a system modified from Douglas and McGuigan (1989) as Type I, T 50 < = 355 nm, (32 species); Type IIa, 355 < T 50 < = 380 nm (30 species); Type IIb, 380 < T 50 405 nm (84 species). Possession of UV-transmitting ocular media follows both taxonomic and functional lines and, if {{the ecology of the}} species is considered, is correlated with the short-wavelength visual pigments found in the species. Three types of short-wavelength vision in fishes are hypothesized: UV-sensitive, UV-specialized, and violet-specialized. UV-sensitive eyes lack UV blockers (Type I and IIa) and can sense UV light with the secondary absorption peak or beta peak of their longer wavelength visual pigments but do not possess specialized UV receptor cells and, therefore, probably lack UV hue discrimination. UV-specialized eyes allow transmission of UV light to the retina (Type I and IIa) and also possess UV-sensitive cone receptors with peak absorption between 300 and 400 nm. Given the appropriate perceptual mechanisms, these species could possess true UV-color vision and hue discrimination. Violet-specialized eyes extend into Type IIb eyes and possess violet-sensitive cone cells. UV-sensitive eyes are found throughout the fishes from at least two species of sharks to modern bony fishes. Eyes with specialized short-wavelength sensitivity are common in tropical reef fishes and must be taken into consideration when performing research involving the visual perception systems of these fishes. Because most glass and plastics are UV-opaque, great care must be taken to ensure that aquarium dividers, specimen holding containers, etc., are UV-transparent or at least to report the types of materials in use...|$|R
40|$|The <b>wahoo</b> (<b>Acanthocybium</b> <b>solandri)</b> is an {{increasingly}} important by-product species of tropical pelagic fisheries worldwide.

This study examined the stock structure of wahoo using morphometric characters and parasite fauna from fish collected in three regions of the western Pacific, and one region {{in each of the}} eastern Pacific and eastern Indian Oceans. Similar morphometric measurements and parasite abundance of wahoo collected off eastern Australia suggest they may form part of a single phenotypic stock in the western Pacific Ocean. Morphometric measurements and parasite fauna were significantly different among wahoo from the western Pacific and eastern Pacific Oceans, suggesting multiple discrete phenotypic stocks despite genetic homogeneity. Assessing fish from a range of regions throughout the Pacific Ocean may help discriminate stock boundaries in this region.

40|$|On April 20 th, 2010, a fire {{broke out}} on the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) {{offshore}} oil drilling rig on the Macondo prospect located {{off the coast of}} the Gulf of Mexico (GOM). This fire and resulting explosions resulted in the sinking of the Deepwater Horizon rig and the largest marine oil spill in history. An estimated 4. 9 million (+/- 10 %) barrels were released into the Gulf of Mexico over the ensuing 87 days. Many economically important fish species spawn in northern Gulf of Mexico waters; the spawning seasons and pelagic larval phase of many of these species occur within the temporal extent of the DWH oil spill (April through July). Fish eggs and larvae in waters exposed to Macondo oil likely experienced lethal and sublethal physiological effects, leading to potential losses in year class strength depending on the proportion of a population’s larval production encountering oil. Differing spatial distributions of larvae due to different spawning locations and seasons could predict that some species were disproportionately affected by the DWH oil spill. This study aims at quantifying the impact of the spill across numerous taxa, by estimating the proportion of species-, genus-, or family-specific fish larval abundances located within the spatial/temporal domain of the DWH spill until the Macondo well was capped. Estimates and related uncertainties were based on empirical ichthyoplankton data collected over 27 years and on observed and modeled distribution of surface oil slicks and concentrations. In addition, two hypothetical oil spills were simulated on the Western Florida Slope and on the Western interior of the Gulf of Mexico {{to assess the impact of}} oil spills to the ichthyoplankton from different offshore locations that would have occurred during the DWH spill period. Ichthyoplankton data collected during annual plankton surveys (and other resource surveys) as part of the Southeast Area Monitoring and Assessment Program – Gulf of Mexico (SEAMAP) during years 1982 - 2009 were used to describe the composition and distribution of ichthyoplankton in the northern Gulf of Mexico. The SEAMAP larval fish data along with oil surface distributions (both actual and simulated) were used to estimate the proportions of larvae of 115 selected fish taxa that were potentially exposed to DWH oil. Bootstrapping methods were applied to the SEAMAP data to quantify the variability. Proportions of larval fish potentially exposed to oil were calculated for four oil spill scenarios: (1) the DWH spill, (2) an September-December oil spill with the same spatial footprint as the DWH spill but occurring later in the year, (3) a west Florida Slope spill occurring during the months of April-July and centered at 27 ˚N, 85 ˚W, and (4) a western GOM spill occurring during the spring and centered at 27 ˚N, 93. 5 ˚W. Spill scenarios (3) and (4) were modeled using the Connectivity Modeling System (CMS). The CMS is a Lagrangian model which predicts oil droplet distribution and degradation based on oil properties and ocean currents. Significant differences in the proportion of larvae potentially exposed were found in the DWH spill and the three simulations. The proportion of fish larvae exposed to the DWH spill varied between 0 % (many species) and 26. 8 % (Cynoscion nebulosus). The proportion of fish larvae exposed to simulated spills varied between 0 % and 78. 9 % (Bonapartia pedaliota in Western GOM spill). Both the west Florida Slope oil spill and the western GOM spills had a disproportionally greater impact on a larger number of taxa than the DWH spill, even after correcting for their larger spatial extent. For the DWH spill (Scenario 1), the potentially most impacted taxa were Cynoscion nebulosus, Engraulidae, Rachycentron canadum, and Etropus spp. If the DWH spill had occurred in the fall (Scenario 2), the most potentially impacted taxa would have been Leiostomus xanthurus, Elopidae, and Pomatomus saltatrix. For a west Florida slope exposure (Scenario 3), the potentially most impacted taxa would be Holocentridae, <b>Acanthocybium</b> <b>solandri,</b> Coryphaena spp., and Pomacanthidae. For a western GOM spill (Scenario 4), the most potentially impacted taxa would be Bonapartia pedaliota, Thunnus thynnus, Caranx spp., and Holocentridae [...] The historical SEAMAP data set combined with the CMS modeling tool provides a powerful planning tool to understand the potential impacts of oil spills in the northern GOM and the relative sensitivity of locations in the Northern GOM to oil spill effects...|$|R
40|$|A {{dearth of}} basic {{biological}} information for <b>wahoo,</b> <b>Acanthocybium</b> <b>solandri,</b> currently hinders {{the ability of}} scientists and managers to assess population sustainability and appropriately manage the dramatically increasing global catch. This study examined the gonads of 382 wahoo collected off eastern Australia during 2008 - 2011 to quantify their reproductive biology in the region. The overall sex ratio {{of the sample was}} 3. 2 : 1 (females:males), however this differed significantly among fishing sectors and areas. The estimated fork length at which 50 % of female wahoo reach maturity was 1, 046 mm. Similar to the Atlantic Ocean, female wahoo have a protracted summer spawning season during October-February. The mean spawning frequency of female wahoo was uncertain but may be approximately 2 - 3 days, with evidence of fish actively spawning on consecutive days. Batch fecundity of females was positively correlated with fish size and estimates ranged between 0. 65 and 5. 12 million oocytes. Relative fecundity was estimated at 122. 0 (+/- 9. 7) oocytes per gram of ovary free body weight and did not differ with fish size or throughout the spawning season. Estimation of reproductive parameters such as size- and age-at-maturity may facilitate the construction of per-recruit stock assessments of wahoo in the region...|$|E
40|$|Blackfin tuna Thunnus atlanticus, {{dolphinfish}} Coryphaena hippurus, and <b>wahoo</b> <b>Acanthocybium</b> <b>solandri</b> {{currently are}} not managed under the {{highly migratory species}} (HMS) fishery management plan (FMP) despite being biologically highly migratory and co-occurring in major fisheries. A review of past international, domestic and regional management regimes; recent consolidations of FMPs; the re-classification of some species within the FMPs and of the migratory patterns of these three species clearly draws into question {{the application of the}} inclusion criteria for the HMS FMP. In order to collect stakeholder opinion on including these three species into the HMS FMP, a survey was launched via online fishing forums. However, only 87 respondents participated in the 2 months-long survey process, with 43 % not even completing the whole of the survey. Aside from refusal to participate, the responses on the forums were that of extreme opposition. So, although the nature of these species certainly qualifies them to fall under this FMP, the reaction from the recreational fishing community would make these changes difficult. Given that these three stocks are not stressed nor overfished, the need to place these species under the HMS FMP {{may not be the best}} course of action at this time. Moreover, such an action could potentially hurt the recreational fishing industry by adding additional and unnecessary regulations...|$|E
40|$|The <b>wahoo,</b> <b>Acanthocybium</b> <b>solandri</b> (Cuvier), {{is a high}} {{trophic level}} {{predator}} in tropical and sub-tropical marine pelagic waters worldwide. Wahoo are primarily caught as a retained incidental catch in purse seine and pelagic longline fisheries that target tuna and swordfish. The global commercial catch of wahoo has increased in the Pacific Ocean from 130. t in 1993 to a peak in recent years of 1339. t in 2006. Wahoo are also a highly prized sportfish in recreational fisheries, and although catches are poorly understood, they may be higher than the commercial catch in some regions. Despite their commercial and recreational importance, little quantitative information exists on their biology and stock structure, particularly in the Pacific Ocean. This dearth of information may have significant consequences for stock assessments and management. Suggested research priorities for wahoo in the Pacific Ocean are to: (1) investigate their biology in the region, particularly age, growth and reproductive parameters, which are essential for stock assessment; (2) use holistic methods to determine stock structure on a timescale appropriate for assessment and management; (3) conduct quantitative diet analyses that may contribute to ecosystem models, and (4) quantify catch from recreational fisheries to include in estimates of total mortality...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Despite its {{economic}} importance to many coastal nations, assessments of <b>wahoo,</b> <b>Acanthocybium</b> <b>solandri,</b> are hampered {{by a lack}} of basic life history information. In this study, wahoo were collected from Florida’s Atlantic coast and the northern Bahamas during 1997 – 2006 to examine reproductive seasonality, maturation, spawning frequency and fecundity. These samples demonstrated only a single, summer-spawning season, which did not support earlier postulations of spring spawning by wahoo near the Bahamas. The size and age at 50 % female maturity were 925 mm fork length and 0. 64 years, respectively. Spawning frequency was, on average, every 5 days during June–August, but 13 % of mature females were inactive during this period. Batch fecundity was positively correlated with fish size, and varied between 0. 44 and 1. 67 million eggs. Parasites, previously unreported to occur in wahoo gonads and identified only as philometrid nematodes, were evident in 11 % of these females. Most parasitised fish had vitellogenic oocytes, several even with oocytes with migrating nuclei or post-ovulatory follicles, so these parasitised fish were capable of spawning. Although wahoo have been noted to have relatively small gonads, and parasites are often found in female gonads, annual fecundity estimates are of the order of 10 – 100 million eggs. The significant contribution of older, larger females to egg production should be considered in managing this fishery...|$|E

Data on fork length, whole (round) weight, and sex {{were collected}} for dolphinfish at the Honolulu fish auction from March 1988 through November 1989. Unsexed weight and length data for wahoo were {{collected at the}} auction from July 1988 through November 1989. We also used sex specific weight and length data of 171 wahoo collected during 1977 – 1985 research cruises for analysis. Coefficients of W-L regressions were significantly different between the sexes for dolphinfish. Coefficients did not significantly differ between the sexes for wahoo based on research cruise data. In a general linear model evaluating month as a categorical factor, month was significant for female dolphinfish, male dolphinfish, and wahoo with sexes pooled. W-L and length-on-weight (L-W) relationships were fitted by nonlinear regression for all dolphinfish, female dolphinfish, male dolphinfish, and all wahoo sexes pooled. W-L relationships for monthly samples of female dolphinfish, male dolphinfish, and all wahoo with sexes pooled were also fitted by nonlinear regression. Predicted mean weight at length for wahoo was highest {{at the beginning of}} the spawning season in June and lowest after the spawning season in September. Maximum and minimum predicted mean weight at length for both sexes of dolphinfish did not correspond with the peak spawning period (March–May). Plausible migration models in conjunction with reproductive behavior were examined to explain the variability in monthly predicted mean weight at length for dolphinfish...|$|E
40|$|Knowledge {{of mercury}} {{concentrations}} in fish {{is essential for}} human health protection. Mercury is a naturally occurring element {{that acts as a}} neurotoxin to humans and other species. The biologically available mercury form, methylmercury (MeHg), bio accumulates from small benthic invertebrates to large pelagic fish, and therefore high end consumers and terminal predators have elevated Hg concentrations. The main pathway of MeHg exposure in humans is by consumption of contaminated fish. In this study total Hg concentrations were measured in 10 Gulf of Mexico pelagic fish species using a DMA 80 analyzer. Total Hg concentrations ranged from 0. 004 to 3. 55 ppm (wet wt). The highest mean concentration (1. 04 ppm, wet wt) recorded in king mackerel (Scomberomorus cavalla) exceeded FDA recommended criteria of 1 ppm. Dolphinfish (Coryphaena hippurus) and vermilion snapper (Rhomboplites aurorubens) had lowest mean Hg concentrations (< 0. 3 ppm). The rest of the species were above the EPA advisory level of 0. 3 ppm. <b>Wahoo</b> (<b>Acanthocybium</b> <b>solandri),</b> greater amberjack (Seriola dumerili) and gag grouper (Mysteroperca microlepsis) had high Hg concentrations of approximately 0. 7 ppm wet wt. Blackfin tuna (Thunnus atlanticus) and yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacores) had moderate Hg concentrations (0. 39 and 0. 36 ppm wet wt respectively). Little tunny (Euthynnus alletteratus) and blacktip shark (Carcharhinus limbatus) had mean concentrations of 0. 69 and 0. 51 ppm respectively. The relationship between fish length and Hg concentrations was significant for four species...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A commercially {{important}} fish, <b>wahoo</b> <b>Acanthocybium</b> <b>solandri</b> (Cuvier, 1832) (Scombridae), {{was collected}} {{to study the}} infestation of parasites from Parangipettai landing center, Tamil Nadu, southeast coast of India {{for a period of}} one year from January to December 2011. A total of 644 fish were captured and screened for parasites. Off 644 fish, 270 were infested by a parasitic copepod Lernaeenicus seeri Kirtisinghe, 1934 (Siphonostomatoida: Pennellidae) on the body surface. It is a mesoparasite, since the head and neck are inserted and attached to the muscle by making a wound/hole on the body {{and the rest of the}} parasite body with the egg sacs hanging outside. Prevalence was recorded as 42. 29 % with mean and maximum intensity at 3. 22 and 33, respectively. Seasonal study showed that the prevalence was highest (62. 82 %) during postmonsoon. Simultaneously, some of the fish (n= 144) were internally observed for the presence of parasites and we found that 101 fish were infested with an endoparasite digenean Hirudinella ventricosa (Pallas, 1774) (Hirudinellidae) in the stomach. Prevalence was recorded as 70. 9 %, and mean intensity of 1. 62 and maximum intensity of 3 were also noted. The overall percentage of both copepod and digenean infestation were recorded as 60. 42 %. The infestation was high in postmonsoon season for both parasites. This is the first record of L. seeri from Indian waters and the second record of occurrence worldwide. Significant interactions were observed between season and infestation of both parasites (P< 0. 05) ...|$|E
