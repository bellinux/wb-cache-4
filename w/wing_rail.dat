50|$|In addition, {{the open}} gap {{at a fixed}} V-crossing forms a weak point on the railway line where the heavily loaded wheel must bump across the {{resulting}} gap of about 10 cm, supported only by {{the portion of the}} wheel tread which is on the <b>wing</b> <b>rail.</b> This pounds the rail so much that the steel can deform and/or wear away. This damage may easily spread to other components including the wheels, and the noise can be a nuisance. Scheduling repair of damage can also be a problem in high traffic locations.|$|E
50|$|The {{number of}} {{passengers}} rose sharply, so that a new station building was required in Bielefeld. The construction of today's entrance building began in 1907. The Art Nouveau building with natural stone facades was opened on 1 May 1910. In the west wing there was a waiting room for first and second class passengers and a waiting room for third and fourth class passengers, in the east <b>wing</b> <b>rail</b> offices and apartments for rail staff. In the entrance hall there were a ticket office and a baggage counter. The entrance building originally had an adjoining platform. During {{the reconstruction of the}} Hamm-Minden line to four tracks between 1911 and 1917, six platform tracks were built on three platforms connected to the station building by passenger and baggage tunnels. Until the beginning of the 21st century the platforms were hardly changed. This means that track 1 runs directly alongside the station building and all the platforms are only accessible through the tunnel. A freight terminal building, which was stylistically matched to the entrance building, but without its natural stone facades, was built {{on the north side of}} the station’s tracks.|$|E

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{method for}} robust geometry optimisation of railway crossings is presented. The robustness {{is achieved by}} optimising the crossing geometry for a representative set of wheel profiles. As {{a basis for the}} optimisation, a crossing geometry is created where rail cross-sectional profiles and longitudinal height profiles of both wing rails and crossing nose are parameterised. Based on the approximation that the two problems are decoupled, separate optimisations are performed for the cross-sectional rail profiles and the longitudinal height profiles. The rail cross sections are optimised to minimise the maximum Hertzian wheel-rail contact pressure. The longitudinal height profiles are optimised to minimise the accumulated damage in the <b>wing</b> <b>rail</b> to crossing nose transition zone. The accumulated damage is approximated using an objective criterion that accounts for the angle of the wheel trajectory reversal during the transition from the <b>wing</b> <b>rail</b> to the crossing nose as well as the distribution of transition points for the utilised wheel profile set. It is found that small nonlinear height deviations from a linear longitudinal <b>wing</b> <b>rail</b> profile in the transition zone can reduce the objective compared to the nominal design. It is further demonstrated that the variation in wheel profile shapes, lateral wheel displacements and the feasible transition zone length of the crossing will determine the longitudinal height profiles of the <b>wing</b> <b>rail</b> and crossing nose if all wheel profiles are to make their transition within the transition zone...|$|E

The sensitivity of nine design variables is estimated using regression analysis on the damage estimates for the different crossing designs. Two different categories of design variables are investigated: parameters related to the cross-sectional rail profiles of the <b>wing</b> <b>rail</b> and crossing nose, and parameters controlling the longitudinal height profiles of the <b>wing</b> <b>rail</b> and crossing nose.

40|$|A {{methodology}} for simulating wear, rolling contact fatigue, and plastic deformation for a mixed traffic situation in {{switches and crossings}} (S&C) has been developed. The methodology includes simulation of dynamic vehicle—track interaction considering stochastic variations in input data, simulation of wheel—rail contacts accounting for non-linear material properties and plasticity, and simulation of wear and plastic deformation in the rail during {{the life of the}} S&C component. To find means of improving the switch panel design, the geometry of a designed track gauge variation in the switch panel has been represented in a parametric way. For traffic in the facing and trailing moves of the through route, an optimum solution was identified and then validated by evaluating a wide set of simulation cases (using different wheel profiles). The optimum design includes a 12 mm maximum gauge widening. Several crossing geometries were investigated to find an optimal geometric design for the crossing nose and <b>wing</b> <b>rails.</b> The MaKüDe design showed the best performance for moderately worn wheel profiles in both running directions (facing and trailing moves). In connection with reduced support stiffness (e. g. elastic rail pads), this crossing design is predicted to lead to a significant reduction of impact loads and consequently provide a high potential of life-cycle cost reduction...|$|R

The maximum principal stresses are 19 and 18.52  MPa respectively; while the minimum principal stresses are 9.12 and 8.63  MPa; the intermediate principal stresses are 16.25 and 15.67  MPa, respectively. Both the maximum and minimum principal stresses are horizontal principal stresses. The maximum principal stresses are at NE 85.9 and NE 87.1 °. The intermediate principal stresses are vertical principal stresses in downward directions. So the roadway is in near south-north direction, with the maximum horizontal principal stress of 19  MPa in the near east–west direction. The axial direction of the roadway is approximately perpendicular to the maximum horizontal principal stress direction. This situation is unfavorable for the roadway maintenance.|$|E

40|$|Methods for simulation-based {{optimisation}} of {{the design}} of railway turnouts (switches & crossings, S&C) are developed and demonstrated. Building on knowledge of dynamic wheel–rail interaction in turnouts, it is investigated how rail profile degradation can be reduced by the optimisation of geometry and component stiffness of the track superstructure. It is assumed that reduced rail profile degradation will reduce the Life Cycle Cost (LCC) of turnouts. In order to obtain robust optimised designs that perform well in situ, the influence of spread in traffic parameters, such as wheel profile and wheel–rail friction coefficient, is accounted for in the optimisations. For this purpose, studies of the correlation between wheel profile characteristics and damage in S&C are performed to allow for an efficient parameter sampling using the Latin Hypercube Sampling method. Track gauge optimisation in the switch panel is performed using a multi-objective optimisation approach to highlight the design trade-off in performance between different traffic routes and moves. The objective is to minimise rail and wheel wear as estimated by the energy dissipation in the wheel‒rail contacts. As track gauge widening affects the switch rail design, the switch rail geometry {{is linked to the}} gauge widening in the parameterisation. It is found that gauge configurations with a large maximum gauge widening for the straight stock rail are optimal for both the through and diverging routes, while the results for the curved stock rail show a more significant route dependence. A method for the optimisation of switch rail profile geometry is presented, where the geometry parameterisation is inspired by a manufacturing process for switch rails. It is found that increased profile height and increased profile shoulder protuberance are preferred to reduce the energy dissipation and wheel‒rail contact pressures when a nominal S 1002 wheel profile is used as input. It is concluded that accurate constraints on allowable switch rail loading need to be established to determine the feasible design space for switch rail geometry optimisation. A method for the optimisation of crossing geometry is also introduced. The rail cross-sections are optimised for minimum wheel‒rail contact pressure. Further, the longitudinal height profiles of the <b>wing</b> <b>rails</b> and crossing nose are optimised to minimise an estimate of the accumulated damage in the transition zone. The optimisation is computationally efficient which makes it possible to account for very large samples of wheel profiles. An investigation and demonstration of the constraints imposed on the crossing design by the spread in profile and lateral displacement of passing wheels is presented. Supplementary to the optimisation studies is the comparison of simulation results to field measurement data to evaluate and validate the accuracy of the utilised model of dynamic vehicle‒track interaction, as well as a demonstration of a methodology that simulates rail profile degradation for a given mixed traffic situation...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} {{numerical}} simulation tools {{have been developed}} to predict the kinematic motion of a railway wheelset at a crossing and derive the dynamic vertical force occurring {{as a result of the}} wheel load transfer between the <b>wing</b> <b>rail</b> and the crossing nose. The tool has been used to show that for new crossing and a large representative range of worn wheels, the peak dynamic force is strongly influenced by the state of wear of the wheel and its lateral position (higher force occurs as the wheel moves towards flange contact on the crossing nose). Arguably, as the crossing wears to conform to the shape of the wheels travelling over it, this tendency may reduce over time. It is suggested that such a tool may be a powerful and fast way of optimising crossing geometry so that damage arising from dynamic impact loads are minimised at the early stage of a crossing life cycle. It may also be envisaged that a crossing may be optimised based on the type and age the traffic running on the specific line it is installe...|$|E

The algorithm was then demonstrated on a crossing with an unknown degradation status, and its capability was verified via a 3 D profile measurement.

30|$|There {{are many}} soft-rock roadway coal mines in China. The {{surrounding}} rocks of the high-stress soft-rock roadways in deep mine are especially {{difficult to be}} supported using the traditional supporting way. In this study, the south <b>wing</b> <b>rail</b> roadway on the second level of Yunjialing coal mine in China {{was used as an}} example to analyze the deformation and failure characteristics and influencing factors of roadway. On this basis, this study proposed the equalized yielding support idea which employs the yielding rings to realize the pressure equalization on the bolts and cables in the section. To achieve this purpose, the first bolt-mesh-cable equalizing pressure yielding support was integrated with the second grouting reinforcement. The results proved that the yield rings of the bolts and cables on the spandrel of the arched roadway firstly developed yielding deformation; then the deformation extended to the vault of the roadway; the bolts and cables achieved a yielding extreme value of 15 and 18  tonnes, respectively. The roadway surrounding rock tended to be stable at the 26 th day after the maintenance. The equalizing pressure yielding supporting technology plays a moderate pressure-releasing and actively controlling role on the surrounding rocks in the soft-rock roadway with large deformation.|$|E

Theoretical analysis of skinning process has been carried out, and an automatic measurement system in order to record the drawing-force on the animal’s body during skinning tests, has been designed. The aim was to indentify the best animal position and provide values of drawing-force in order to design a specific machine for ostrich skinning.

40|$|A wheel {{passing a}} {{crossing}} nose: Dynamic analysis under high axle loads using {{finite element model}}ling* Martin Pletz 1, 2, Werner Daves 1, 2 and Heinz Ossberger 3 A finite element model for the process of a wheel passing a crossing is presented. In the dynamic model, one wheel, the wing rails and the crossing nose (frog) are modelled. The bogie, the complete wheel set {{and the support of}} the crossing are represented as a system consisting of masses, springs, dampers and friction-generating elements. The rolling/sliding behaviour between the wheel and crossing is studied using the proposed model. Due to the conical shape of the wheel tread and multiple contacts between the wheel and the crossing parts, sliding occurs during the transition of the wheel from the <b>wing</b> <b>rail</b> to the crossing nose or vice versa. At the same time, an impact occurs that produces high contact forces. The parameters of the model are the train speed and passing direction, the wheel and the crossing geometry, the axle load and the support of the crossing. In this paper, the crossover process is studied for high axle loads and compared with results of simulations using a normal axle load. Further parameters are three train velocities, both directions of passing and different crossing materials.

In service, crossings are submitted to rolling, impact and sliding stresses. The impact-sliding {{is the result of the}} wheel transition from rail wing to crossing nose. Very high contact forces act on the crossing nose while such wheels are passing over it.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} an optimisation procedure {{for improvement of}} crossing performance by adjusting the cro sing (including the <b>wing</b> <b>rail)</b> geometry. The improvement of the crossing performance is achieved by reducing the normal contact pressure and wear index, while shifting {{the location of the}} wheel impact (fatigue area) along the crossing. By shifting the fatigue area the life of the crossing can be prolonged. To demonstrate the proposed procedure the geometry of a crossing (crossing angle 1 : 15) has been optimised. The effect of two typical wheel profiles used on the considered crossing is taken in to account during the optimisation. The robustness of the obtained geometries has been verified using the numerical simulations with track geometrical irregularities. Using the optimisation procedure two improved geometries of the crossing have been obtained. In both designs the normal contact pressure was reduced as compared to the reference design, while the fatigue area in the second crossing was shifted further from the tip point of the crossing as compared to the first crossing. Important is that the second crossing geometry can be obtained from the first crossing simply by grinding. To implement the new crossing geometry a new measurement device has been proposed. The device can be used for assessment of wear of existing crossings and during adjusting/restoration of the crossing geometry. Accepted Author ManuscriptRailway Engineerin...|$|E

Its basis is the woodcock wing; red hackle legs, which should be long and pale; and a thin mohair body, of different shades of red-brown, from a dark claret to a pale sandy. It may thus, tied of different sizes, do duty for half-a-dozen of the commonest flies; for the early claret (red-brown of Ronalds; a Nemoura, according to him), which is the first spring-fly; for the red spinner, or perfect form of the March- brown ephemera; for the soldier, the soft-winged reddish beetle which haunts the umbelliferous flowers, and being as soft in spirit as in flesh, perpetually falls into the water, and comes to grief therein; and last but not least, for the true caperers, or whole tribe of Phryganidae, of which a sketch was given just now. As a copy of them, the body should be of a pale red brown, all but sandy (but never snuff-coloured, as shop-girls often tie it), and its best hour is always in the evening. It kills well when fish are gorged with their morning meal of green drakes; and after the green drake is off, it is almost the only fly at which large trout care to look; a fact not to be wondered at when one considers that nearly two hundred species of English Phryganidae have been already described, and that at least half of them are of the fawn-tint of the caperer.

30|$|Soft rock mines widely {{distribute}} in China (Niu et al. 2011) {{and extend}} to the depth at a speed of 8  m/a. The coal and rock masses in the deep mine are characterized by “three highs and one disturbance”. The large deformation and failure of surrounding rocks and the floor heave of the roadway etc. seriously affect the safe production of the coal mine (He et al. 2005, 2006; He 2014). Therefore, the supporting problem of such roadway restricts the development of coal mine (Bai et al. 2008). Owning to differences of the geological structure, mining depth, and surrounding rock properties, a variety of roadway-controlling technologies have been proposed. However, these technologies fail to be promoted and applied widely. The high-stress soft-rock roadway controlling technology in the deep mine has been the hot research focus. Lots of existing studies {{have been made to}} improve the surrounding rock strength, the supporting material strength, and the coupling of surrounding rock with support and got fruitful achievements (Bai et al. 2007; Kang et al. 2010). However, the equalized yielding support technology for the high-stress soft-rock roadway has been rarely reported (Cheng 2004; Shen and Li 2005). In this study, the south <b>wing</b> <b>rail</b> roadway on the second level in Yunjialing coal mine in China was used as an example to analyze the characteristics, deformation rule, and deformation characteristics of the surrounding rocks. On this basis, it proposed the equalized yielding support technology for the roadway with high stress and soft rocks.

The surrounding rock controlling effect of the support technology was significant.|$|E
40|$|A {{state-of-the-art}} {{study on}} ground-borne vibration induced by railway turnouts (switches & crossings) is presented. Vibration generating mechanisms and possibilities for cost-effective mitigation measures are discussed. A brief literature survey {{and examples of}} results from vibration measurements performed by the Schweizerische Bundesbahnen (SBB) are presented. The present work was performed within the EU FP 7 project RIVAS (Railway Induced Vibration Abatement Solutions). Mitigation measures for turnouts described in the literature mainly aim at reducing the dynamic wheel-rail contact force (impact load) in the crossing panel. This is supported by field observations of amplified ground-borne vibration at turnouts, indicating {{that there is a}} need to improve the design of these track components. A smooth wheel transition between <b>wing</b> <b>rail</b> and crossing nose is important to achieve low energy impacts on the crossing. Measures to mitigate the vibrations include the use of soft or stiff Under Sleeper Pads (USP) for better and more stable turnout geometry over time. The use of USP may also reduce the magnitude of vibrations transferred from turnout to soil. Other measures include improving the design of the crossing panel (material and geometry of crossing nose and wing rails) and the use of more resilient rail pads. Results from a Swiss test campaign at two different sites (Rubigen and Le Landeron), using stiff USP in four turnouts, are presented and compared to results from four nominal turnouts without USP. However, the vibrations measured at Le Landeron, and even more so for Rubigen, seem to be significantly influenced by the turnout and soil conditions. It is important to accurately determine the condition of each turnout to enable a meaningful comparison between the turnouts and to draw conclusions on the influence of turnout mitigation measures on vibration emission. The best approach to reduce the amplification of vibration is a system approach where different parameters (such as rail profiles, rail material, resilient layers) are designed to interact in a harmonious and robust way. It is thus important to identify the combination of parameters that defines the design of an optimum turnout. Modelling is required to optimize the wheel transition over the crossing panel. Further tests are needed to define the relevant geometric parameters influencing the wheel trajectory and the amplified vibrations. If an improvement of the dynamic wheel-rail interaction (wheel transition) can be accomplished that reduces impact loads on the crossing panel, both vibration magnitudes and the need for crossing panel maintenance can be reduced...|$|E

The methodology predicts the accumulated settlement {{for a given}} set of traffic loads using an iterative and cross-disciplinary procedure. The different modules of the procedure include (I) simulation of dynamic vehicle–track interaction in a turnout applying a validated software for multibody vehicle dynamics considering space-dependent track properties, (II) calculation of load distribution and sleeper–ballast contact pressure using a detailed finite element model of a turnout that includes all of the rails (stock rails, switch rails, closure rails, crossing nose, wing rails and check rails), rail pads, baseplates and sleepers on ballast, (III) prediction of track settlement for a given number of load cycles and (IV) calculation of accumulated track settlement at each sleeper and the resulting vertical track irregularity along the turnout which is used as input in the next step of the iteration. The iteration scheme is demonstrated by calculating track settlement at the crossing when the studied turnout is exposed to freight traffic in the facing move of the through route. Due {{to the design of}} the crossing panel and the character of the impact loads induced by the transfer of wheels between <b>wing</b> <b>rail</b> and crossing nose, the load transferred into the track bed is not uniform and the resulting spatially varying (differential) settlement leads to vertical irregularities in track geometry. In the first paper of this work, track settlement is predicted using a discrete empirical model that gives the local vertical settlement {{based on the number of}} load cycles and the prescribed distribution of sleeper–ballast contact pressure. Such a model does not account for the material behaviour in, or the interaction between, different regions of the track substructure. In the second paper, a computationally efficient method for predicting long-term settlement in generic configurations of track (various combinations of track superstructure and substructure and nonsymmetric loading conditions) using a constitutive model accounting for the multi-axial stressstrain condition in the track substructure is developed. A key ingredient of the method is that the selected constitutive model evaluates track settlement in the cycle domain. The constitutive model is adopted for both the ballast and the sub-ballast but with different parameter sets. The dimensions of the three-dimensional finite element model of the track substructure and the number of sleepers that need to be included to obtain accurate settlement at the crossing are investigated. To predict a reliable distribution of settlement under a given sleeper, it is concluded that the loading on at least two sleepers on either side of the sleeper must also be included in the model...|$|E
