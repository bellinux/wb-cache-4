5|$|Director Mike Nichols, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> Cher onstage in Jimmy Dean, {{offered her}} {{the part of}} Dolly Pelliker, a plant co-worker and Meryl Streep's lesbian roommate in the film Silkwood. When it premiered in 1983, audiences {{questioned}} Cher's ability as an actress. She recalls attending a film preview during which the audience laughed when they saw her name in the credits. For her performance, Cher won the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress – Motion Picture.|$|E

Isaac Levy, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> the group leaving Exchange Buildings, {{identified}} Peters and Dubof as the two he had seen carrying Gardstein. It was also ascertained that Federoff had been witnessed at the events. The following day Federoff, Peters and Dubof all appeared at the Guildhall police court where they were charged with being connected {{to the murder of}} the three policemen, and with conspiracy to burgle the jewellery shop.

In November 1940 the new army units were organised into a Special Service Brigade under Brigadier J. C. Haydon, with four Special Service Battalions.

5|$|Jewish civil {{servants}} {{lost their jobs}} in 1933, except for those <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> military service in World War I.

5|$|Meanwhile, {{unbeknownst to}} Kurosawa, Rashomon had been {{entered in the}} prestigious Venice Film Festival, due {{to the efforts of}} Giuliana Stramigioli, a Japan-based {{representative}} of an Italian film company, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> and admired the movie and convinced Daiei to submit it. On September 10, 1951, Rashomon was awarded the festival's highest prize, the Golden Lion, shocking not only Daiei but the international film world, which at the time was largely unaware of Japan's decades-old cinematic tradition.|$|E

Critics <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> the film in 2008 were mentioning it as a possible Academy Award candidate.

5|$|The Cookery Book of Lady Clark of Tillypronie {{is a book}} {{of recipes}} {{collected}} over a lifetime by Charlotte, Lady Clark of Tillypronie (née Coltman, 1851–1897), and published posthumously in 1909.

5|$|At {{the same}} time, Werber was {{attempting}} to leverage the Trio's popularity as a club act into a recording contract. Both Dot Records and Liberty Records expressed some interest, but each proposed to record the Trio on 45 rpm (revolutions per minute) singles only, whereas Werber and the Trio members both felt that 33⅓ rpm albums had more potential for the group's music. Through Jimmy Saphier, agent for Bob Hope <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> and liked the group at The Purple Onion, Werber contacted Capitol Records, which dispatched prominent producer Voyle Gilmore to San Francisco to evaluate the Trio's commercial potential. On Gilmore's strong recommendation, Capitol signed the Kingston Trio to an exclusive seven-year deal.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the Allied landing, Imperial Japanese Army forces in the Admiralties {{consisted}} of the 51st Transport Regiment under Colonel Yoshio Ezaki, who was also the overall garrison commander; 2ndBattalion, 1st Independent Mixed Regiment; 1stBattalion, 229th Infantry Regiment; and elements of the IJN's 14th Naval Base Force. Allied G-2 had identified the presence of all these units in the Admiralties, though their designation was not known in all instances. While the 1stBattalion, 229thInfantry Regiment was a veteran of several campaigns, it was short of equipment and lacked its battalion artillery guns. The 2ndBattalion, 1st Independent Mixed Regiment was led by reserve officers <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> action in China, but most of its enlisted men were recalled reservists who had not previously been in battle.|$|E
5|$|Between 1900 and 1975, over 60 radio, television, {{film and}} stage {{productions}} appeared. The first feature-film adaptation was the 1940 MGM production of Pride and Prejudice starring Laurence Olivier and Greer Garson. It {{has long been}} said that a Hollywood adaptation was first suggested by the entertainer Harpo Marx, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> a dramatisation of the novel in Philadelphia in 1935, but the story is of doubtful accuracy. Directed by Robert Z. Leonard and written {{in collaboration with the}} English novelist Aldous Huxley and American screenwriter Jane Murfin, the film was critically well-received, although the plot and characterisations strayed from Austen's original. Filmed in a studio and in black and white, the story's setting was relocated to the 1830s with opulent costume designs.|$|E

5|$|Giselle {{was mounted}} by other ballet {{companies}} in Europe and America {{almost immediately after}} its first night. The British had their first taste of Giselle with a drama based on the ballet called Giselle, or The Phantom Night Dancers by William Moncrieff, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> the ballet in Paris the same year. The play was performed on 23 August 1841 at the Theatre Royal, Sadler's Wells. The actual ballet was first staged in London at Her Majesty's Theatre on 12 March 1842 with Grisi as Giselle and Perrot as Albrecht. The dances were credited to Perrot and one Deshayes. This production was revived many times, once in 1884 with a Mlle. Sismondi {{in the role of}} Albrecht. This production, preceded by an operetta called Pocahontas, met with little enthusiasm.|$|E
5|$|In 1862 {{he visited}} Jamestown to inspect, equip and provide uniforms for the Chautauqua regiment, his first return since infancy, and was welcomed {{by a group}} of {{prominent}} citizens. Shepard recruited and organized the 51st Regiment, New York Volunteers, which was named the Shepard Rifles in his honor. George W. Whitman, brother of the poet Walt Whitman {{and a member of the}} regiment, was notified by Shepard of a promotion; Shepard may have influenced his subsequent promotion to major in 1865. In addition, Shepard was involved in correspondence with Walt Whitman. Although President Abraham Lincoln offered him a promotion to brigadier general, Shepard declined in deference to officers <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> field service; Shepard himself never entered the field. From 1866 to 1868 Shepard served as aide-de-camp to Reuben E. Fenton.|$|E

5|$|McLachlan found {{success on}} the Fox {{television}} series Millennium, earning several awards {{for his work on}} the show. He was head-hunted for the series by its creator Chris Carter, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> his work on the series Strange Luck. McLachlan was initially offered a position shooting Carter's other active series, The X-Files, then in its third season, but was unable to start work in time. He developed a distinctive style for the series, shooting it with desaturated colours and lighting scenes as though they were to be filmed in black and white; he also made use of high-intensity strobe lighting usually employed for advertising and macro cinematography. McLachlan has noted that this style briefly became popular after the series' broadcast but that other cinematographers had difficulty adjusting to it.|$|E
