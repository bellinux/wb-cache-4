After the analysis of <b>wheel</b> <b>rim's</b> three typical conditions, found the weak parts {{of the structure of the}} <b>rim,</b> <b>and</b> this part was consistent with the feedback part, so it proved correct of the finite element analysis model.

40|$|Previous {{standards}} for the manufacturing inspection of railroad wheels using ultrasound, such as UIC 812, {{have been replaced by}} new standards, for example EN 13262 and RD 32. 144 - 2000, both requiring ultrasonic testing in immersion technique. These new standards require the development of an ultrasonic technique for 100 % coverage of the <b>wheel</b> <b>rim</b> <b>and</b> <b>wheel</b> hub, and in special cases for both straight and curved wheel disks. In order to encompass a large variety of railroad wheel designs, inspection and handling techniques should be capable of dealing with wheel diameters ranging from 600 mm to 1300 mm (23 " to 51 ") at testing cycles from 1 to 4 minutes per wheel. The current requirement for the minimum detectable flaw size is DSR 1 mm (disc shape reflector, DSR, 1 mm diameter) for high-speed train <b>wheels</b> <b>rims</b> <b>and</b> DSR 2 mm for all other <b>wheel</b> <b>rims.</b> The minimum detectable flaw size for all other wheel areas (hub and disk areas) is DSR 3 mm. To meet all these criteria, the Rail Wheel Inspection (RWI) System was developed by IZFP and their partners. The system consists of an ultrasonic testing sub-system, immersion tank and transportation/handling sub-systems. Test cycles of 1 minute per wheel require two immersion tanks and two transportation/handling subsystems. The ultrasonic sub-system features modular computer-aided 6 to 16 - channel UT electronics (PCUS 11) to employ 6 to 16 ultrasonic transducers (the precise number is determined by the testing procedure). This presentation paper offers descriptions of, and results from three of these systems that have been integrated into manufacturing processes at German and Russian wheel manufacturers, and provides details on the following topics: <b>Wheel</b> <b>rim</b> inspection, single-tank immersion technique, 4 minutes inspection cycle per wheel (Bochum, Germany) <b>Wheel</b> <b>rim,</b> hub <b>and</b> disc inspection, single-tank immersion technique, 2 minutes inspection cycle per wheel (Ilsenburg, Germany) <b>Wheel</b> <b>rim,</b> hub <b>and</b> disc inspection, dual-tank immersion technique, 1 minute inspection cycle per wheel (Nishny-Tagil, Russia...|$|R

5000|$|The {{main reason}} for the {{preference}} for rim brake {{on the back of}} 26" [...] wheeled bikes is that there is significant wind-up between the <b>wheel</b> <b>rim</b> <b>and</b> the hub while hopping on the back wheel thanks to the longer <b>spokes</b> <b>and</b> bigger wheel and disk diameter used compared to a 20" [...] wheel. This occurs because disk brakes hold the hub still rather than the rim. The effect is noticeable as a springiness in the bike when on the back wheel and this feels less precise and confidence inspiring to many riders than a rim brake, which holds the wheel directly at the rim.|$|R
