5|$|Much {{like in the}} Ski Jumping World Cup, {{events are}} {{composed}} of usually one or two individual competitions (rarely three, {{as was the case}} in both Vikersund and Planica during the 2016 season), with a qualification round before each one. If there are two competitions, qualification for the second one takes place on the same day. The limit of 40 places per competition still applies (unless a cancelled ski jumping competition is rescheduled to a flying hill), but unlike the Ski Flying World Championships, if an athlete fails to qualify for one competition they still have the opportunity to make a fresh start and qualify for the others. If the very last competition of a World Cup season takes place on a ski flying hill, only 30 athletes <b>will</b> <b>participate,</b> with neither an elimination process after the first round, nor a qualification round.|$|E
