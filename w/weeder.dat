When the Socialist speaks of a plan, he knows clearly that it is {{impossible}} to make a plan as an architect makes a plan, because while the architect deals with dead stone and timber, the statesman and Socialist deal with living and striving things. But he seeks to make a plan as one designs and lays out a garden, so that sweet and seemly things may grow, wide and beautiful vistas open and weeds and foulness disappear. Always a garden plan develops and renews itself and discovers new possibilities, but what makes all its graciousness and beauty possible is the scheme and the persistent intention, the watching and the waiting, the digging and burning, the <b>weeder</b> clips and the hoe. That is the sort of plan, a living plan for things that live and grow, that the Socialist seeks for social and national life.|$|E

The various mechanical and thermal devices available for intra-row weed control are reported in this review. Low-tech mechanical devices such as cultivators, finger-weeders, brush <b>weeders,</b> and torsionweeders tend {{to be used in}} low density crops, while spring-tine harrows are mainly applied in narrow-row high-density crops. Flame weeding can be used for both narrow and wide-row sown crops, provided that the crop is heat-tolerant. Robotic <b>weeders</b> are the most recent addition to agricultural engineering, and only a few are available on the market. Nowadays, robotic <b>weeders</b> are not yet used in small and medium sized farms.

50|$|Flame <b>weeders</b> use a flame several centimeters {{away from}} the weeds {{to give them a}} sudden and severe heating. The goal of flame weeding is not {{necessarily}} burning the plant, but rather causing a lethal wilting by denaturing proteins in the weed. Similarly, hot air <b>weeders</b> can heat up the seeds to the point of destroying them. Flame <b>weeders</b> can be combined with techniques such as stale seedbeds (preparing and watering the seedbed early, then killing the nascent crop of weeds that springs up from it, then sowing the crop seeds) and preemergence flaming (doing a flame pass against weed seedlings after the sowing of the crop seeds but before those seedlings emerge from the soil—a span of time that can be days or weeks).|$|R
40|$|Mechanical weeding is {{considered}} {{as an essential}} component in organic farming because there are few alternative methods to control intra-row weeds. However, intra-row mechanical weed control still has problems with efficacy due to the absence of, or poor, working depth control, of intra-row mechanical <b>weeders.</b> To improve depth control, intra-row mechanical <b>weeders</b> need to be combined with a sensor, whose output is used to control {{the depth of the}} <b>weeders.</b> The purpose of this work was to develop and evaluate a laser-based optical sensor {{that can be used to}} improve the working depth control of intra-row mechanical <b>weeders.</b> The performance of the depth sensor in frame height measurement and soil/crop discrimination was investigated under different soil properties and crop types representing field conditions during mechanical weeding. The results showed that the sensor depth measurement was not affected by the soil texture and soil moisture content of Belgian soils under organic farming conditions. The range of depth measurement is approximately 190 mm comprising a mid-point at 365 mm from the Measured surface with a precision of at least 1 mm. Because optic filters were used the depth sensor was not influenced by sunlight. The sensor had a mean measurement speed of 35 ms. Furthermore, the sensor has been proved to be able to discriminate between soil and crop samples with a maximum error of 5 % and is able to detect the depth in motion with a repeatable precision of 5 mm. in conclusion, the sensor has the ability to detect the working depth and to provide improved depth measurement to enhance depth regulation of intra-row mechanical <b>weeders.</b> (C) 2008 IAgrE.

40|$|Sorghum Cue: Like maize, sorghum is a crop that is {{particularly}} vulnerable to weeds, because it grows slowly at first. When growing sorghum, farmers {{must be ready to}} weed it in good time, just three to four weeks after sowing. Late weeding can cause losses at harvest of 30 % or more. As sorghum is a crop that is usually planted in rows, using mechanical <b>weeders</b> can be an effective and labour-saving weed control method. These may be either push-pull hand <b>weeders,</b> or animal drawn <b>weeders.</b> However, this mechanical weeding must be done carefully, and at the right time, otherwise it can cause breakage of stems or uprooting. But, as Busani Bafana found out when he spoke to crop specialist Casper Moyo, there are other ways of controlling weeds in sorghum. IN:		?Small-scale farmers in Zimbabwe ?? OUT:		?the crop growth and the yield [...] ? DUR?N		 2 ? 58 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Casper Moyo advising sorghum farmers to weed as early as possible, to ensure good crop growth and yields. Transcript Bafana	Small-scale farmers in Zimbabwe, Matabeleland South province are aware of the negative impact weeds can have on their crop yields if they are not controlled. Therefore many farmers take extension advice seriously and show innovation in blending western practices of weed control with cultural knowledge systems such as rogueing. Casper Moyo is a Crop Specialist based in Matabeleland South province. Mr Moyo what methods of weed control do farmers commonly use in controlling sorghum in Matabeleland? Moyo	There are various methods which include crop rotation or intercropping. That is they intercrop their sorghum together with a traditional crop like pumpkins and squashes, so that the squashes would be a spreading crop, they have the effect of smothering weeds. They also use ox-drawn cultivators for cultivating in the inter-row and come in with the hoes in the in-row spaces to look at finishing off all the weeds that would have grown. In some areas we have farmers who are not able to purchase these cultivators, they use these simple hand hoes but it is rather intensive. Bafana		Of the methods that you described how effective are they? Moyo	I would say most are fairly effective depending on the efficiency of the farmer. For example the use of intercropping; if the crop itself is well spaced it can easily smother the weeds early enough and if these other traditional crops like the pumpkins and the squashes have been given optimum time and fertiliser to grow they can easily smother the weeds. Then the use of the cultivators; this is also effective {{but the problem is that}} most of these are not properly set, and in some cases these inter-row spaces are much much wider than the recommended spaces and the plant population is not all that ideal, it is at times too low for the smothering effect. Bafana		How can farmers minimise the weed problems in sorghum? Moyo	They can minimise that by cultural practices like early planting and proper spacing so as to achieve optimum plant population at an early stage as well as timely cultivation before the weeds produce the seeds. Bafana	What are the key factors that farmers should remember about the methods that we have outlined? For example the optimum time they need to carry out the weed control in sorghum? Moyo	The factor that they ought to consider is that the weeding has to be done as early as possible, preferably before four weeks, 3 - 4 weeks they should come in so that weeds have the minimum effect as possible on the crop growth and the yield. End of track. Crop specialist Casper Moyo advocates intercropping and use of ox-drawn <b>weeders</b> in sorghum production, and stresses the importance of crop spacing and early weeding...|$|R

The results of a survey of farmers using animal-drawn cultivators or ridgers are presented. <b>Weeders</b> were mainly used for maize.

50|$|Vavilovian mimicry {{is a good}} {{illustration}} of unintentional selection by humans. Although the human selective agents might be conscious of {{their impact on the}} local weed gene pool, such effects go against the goals of those growing crops. <b>Weeders</b> do not want to select weeds that are increasingly similar to the cultivated plant, yet the only other option is to let the weeds grow and compete with crops for sunlight and nutrients. Similar situations include antibiotic resistance and, of similar nature to crop mimicry, herbicide resistance. This can be contrasted with other forms of artificial selection that do tend toward a favorable outcome, such as selective breeding. Having acquired many desirable qualities by being subjected to similar selective pressures, Vavilovian mimics may eventually be domesticated themselves. Vavilov called these weeds-become-crops secondary crops.|$|R
50|$|Only a few {{diseases}} and pests {{are known to}} attack proso millet, {{but they are not}} economically important. Weeds are a bigger problem. The critical phase is in juvenile development. The formation of the grains happens in the 3, up to 5, leaf stadium. After that, all nutrients should be available for the millet, so it is necessary to prevent the growth of weeds. In conventional farming, herbicides may be used. In organic farming it is possible to use harrow <b>weeders</b> and interrow cultivators, but special sowing parameters described in the chapter above are needed.For good crop development, fertilization with 50 to 75 kg nitrogen per hectare is recommended. Planting proso millet in a crop rotation after maize should be avoided due to its same weed spectrum. Because proso millet is an undemanding crop, it may be used {{at the end of the}} rotation.|$|R
