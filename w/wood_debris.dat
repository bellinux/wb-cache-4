5|$|Phallus impudicus, known colloquially as {{the common}} stinkhorn, is a {{widespread}} fungus recognizable for its foul odor and its phallic shape when mature, the latter feature giving rise to several names in 17th-century England. It is a common mushroom in Europe and western North America, where it occurs in habitats rich in <b>wood</b> <b>debris</b> such as forests and mulched gardens. It appears from summer to late autumn. The fruiting structure is tall and white with a slimy, dark olive colored conical head. Known as the gleba, this material contains the spores, and is transported by insects which are attracted by the odor—described as resembling carrion. Despite its foul smell, it is not poisonous and immature mushrooms are consumed in parts of France and Germany.|$|E

The root traces come {{at a variety of}} orientations ranging from horizontal to vertical. Some of these being the roots' original life position. The researchers concluded that the abundance of preserved plant material probably reflects the great abundance of local plant life during the Cretaceous.|$|E

Mushrooms {{typically}} fruit {{in groups of}} 5 to 20, sometimes in bundles. Usual substrates include <b>wood</b> <b>debris</b> buried in soil, twigs or very rotten logs, and, rarely, pine cones. The mushroom is found in woodlands (a low-density forest or wooded area that allows sunlight to penetrate to the forest floor) containing Hartweg's pine (Pinus hartwegii) in addition to grasses such as Festuca tolucensis and Muhlenbergia quadridentata, and the herbaceous plant Alchemilla procumbens, at elevations of [...] Heim found the type specimens {{at an altitude of}} [...] in an alpine pine forest.

500|$|Growing on the ground, Gomphus clavatus {{mushrooms}} appear singly, {{in clusters}} or clumps, or even occasionally fairy rings. The species is typically found in coniferous forests, {{and with a}} preference for moist, shady areas with deep leaf litter, or rotten <b>wood</b> <b>debris</b> on the ground. It is equally common in older or younger stands of trees. Fruit bodies are easily missed because their colors blend {{with those of the}} forest floor.

It is also reported with beech (Fagus sylvatica) in Europe.|$|E
500|$|Crucibulum is a genus in the Nidulariaceae, {{a family}} of fungi whose fruiting bodies {{resemble}} tiny egg-filled bird's nests. Often called [...] "splash cups", the fruiting bodies are adapted for spore dispersal by using the kinetic energy of falling drops of rain. The [...] "eggs" [...] inside the bird's nests (technically known as peridioles) are hard waxy shells containing spores, and tend to stick to whatever nearby [...] they land on, thus increasing the odds of being consumed and dispersed by herbivorous animals. Members of this genus are saprobic, obtaining nutrients from dead organic matter, and are typically found growing on decayed wood and <b>wood</b> <b>debris.</b> The three known Crucibulum species (C.laeve, C.parvulum, and C.cyathiforme) are distinguished from other genera of the Nidulariaceae by their relatively simple funiculus – a cord of hyphae that connects the peridiole (the [...] "eggs") to {{the exterior of the}} bird's nest.|$|E
500|$|Phallus ravenelii, {{commonly}} known as Ravenel's stinkhorn, is a fungus found in eastern North America. Its mushrooms commonly grow in large clusters and are noted for their foul odor and phallic shape when mature. It is saprobic, and as such it is encountered {{in a wide variety}} of habitats rich in <b>wood</b> <b>debris,</b> from forests to mulched gardens or sawdust piles in urban areas. It appears from August to October. The fruit body emerges from a pink or lavender-colored egg to form a tall, cylindrical, hollow and spongy white stalk with a bell-shaped cap. The remains of the egg persist as a white to pink or lilac volva at the base of the stalk. The cap is covered in a foul-smelling olive-green spore slime, which attracts insects that help to spread the spores. Sometimes, the cap has a [...] "veil" [...] attached—a thin membrane that hangs underneath. The lack of a roughly ridged and pitted cap differentiates it from the closely related Phallus impudicus. The fungus is named after Henry William Ravenel, a botanist who first discovered it in 1846, though it remained undescribed until 1873. It is considered to be an edible mushroom while in its egg form.|$|E
