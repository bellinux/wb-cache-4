5|$|Jordan {{responded by}} scoring 38 {{points in the}} next game, which Chicago won.

He averaged 31 points per game in the series, but Orlando won the series in 6 games.|$|E
5|$|Six of {{the dead}} were not wearing seat belts, while a seventh was not {{properly}} restrained. Greg Sypher, a collision analyst and principal Transport Canada investigator, later suggested that seat belts most likely would not have saved all the victims' lives.

5|$|At the motel, Lila and Sam meet Norman. Sam distracts him by {{striking}} up {{a conversation}} while Lila sneaks up to the house. When Sam tells Norman they've come to question his mother, he knocks Sam out and rushes to the house. Lila sees Norman approaching and hides by going down steps {{that lead to the}} fruit cellar. There she finds Mrs. Bates sitting in a chair. Lila turns her around and discovers that she is in fact a mummified corpse. Lila screams as Norman runs into the cellar, holding a chef's knife and <b>wearing</b> <b>his</b> mother's clothes and a wig. Before Norman can attack Lila, Sam, having regained consciousness, subdues him.|$|E
5|$|During his midget season, Crosby {{appeared}} on the CBC's Hockey Day in Canada telecast. He has recalled numerous instances in which opposing players intentionally attempted to injure him, as well as constant verbal abuse from parents {{on and off the}} ice. Parents taunted and threatened Crosby so harshly, he took to not <b>wearing</b> <b>his</b> jersey between tournament games while he waited to play so {{that he would not be}} recognized. Due to this treatment, he elected to play for the American hockey program at Shattuck-Saint Mary's Boarding School, Minnesota for the 2002–03 hockey season. In 57 games with the Sabres, he recorded 72 goals and 162 points, leading the team to a U18 AAA national championship.|$|E
5|$|In 1915 Thomas Beecham and Robert Courtneidge {{presented}} {{a season of}} opera at the Shaftesbury Theatre. Harrison was recruited as a conductor along with Percy Pitt, Hamish MacCunn and Landon Ronald. After a second season with Courtneidge, Beecham set up on his own account in 1916, and established the Beecham Opera Company at the Aldwych Theatre of which his father Sir Joseph Beecham was the lessee. Harrison, Pitt, and Eugene Goossens joined him as assistant conductors. In 1916 Harrison joined the Royal Flying Corps and was commissioned as a lieutenant in the technical branch. He was based in London, and was frequently able to conduct for Beecham, often <b>wearing</b> <b>his</b> uniform.|$|E

Odd is now left with responsibility for Sissener's dog and with an urgency to live life to the fullest. He makes {{his way up to}} the Holmenkollen ski jump, where he sees a vision of his mother as a young woman, doing the jump. He comes to a decision and starts to do the ski jump. Odd, for the first time no longer <b>wearing</b> <b>his</b> railwayman's jacket, rides the train to Bergen, where Svea is happily waiting for him on the platform.|$|E
5|$|Like its predecessors, Mario Party 5 was {{published}} by Nintendo and developed by Hudson Soft. It is the first Mario Party game to have Donkey Kong as a non-playable character. It is also the first Mario Party game to have Wario <b>wearing</b> <b>his</b> current short-sleeve shirt. It is the last Mario Party game where Daisy is voiced by Jen Taylor; for later games, Jen Taylor is replaced by Deanna Mustard. It is the fifth and final Mario Party game to have Bowser's sound effects from the first four Mario Party games.|$|E

5|$|Though the {{producers}} decided that Friday the 13th {{would not be}} an origin story, they said that they wanted to work out a logical origin story for Jason that would provide a sense of history as the film progressed. Form and Fuller explained that the audience gets to see how Jason attains his famous hockey mask, and is given a reason for why he puts it on. Jason would transition from wearing a bag over his head—similar to the one seen in Friday the 13th Part 2—to finding and <b>wearing</b> <b>his</b> hockey mask, whereas in Friday the 13th Part III he obtains the mask off-screen and comes out of a barn already wearing it.|$|E
5|$|Another {{controversy}} {{surrounds the}} sole {{survivor of the}} flight, a Czech officer, Eduard Prchal. Prchal, like many pilots who {{did not wish to}} tempt fate was known for never <b>wearing</b> <b>his</b> Mae West life jacket — but on this occasion, when rescued from the sea, he was wearing one. During the inquiry he denied this, and later blamed the inconsistency on post-crash shock affecting his actions and memory – essentially, on amnesia. Later he explained that he must have instinctively put the vest on when he realised the plane was in trouble. Polish aviation expert Jerzy Maryniak created a simulation of the crash, in which he concluded that the plane must have been under control up until the very moment of the crash. Kisielewski argues that the plane was likely {{under the control of the}} second pilot, who died in the crash.|$|E
5|$|By late 1943, Miller {{has been}} based at RAF South Cerny in Gloucestershire. One night, he was pulled over by his {{commanding}} officer, whom he detested, for not <b>wearing</b> <b>his</b> uniform cap. An altercation resulted, and Miller posed {{as though he were}} about to punch his officer. The result was that Miller was charged with insubordination and sentenced to a three-week disciplinary course with hard labour, from 18 October to 9 November. In mid-November he was posted to Ouston near Newcastle upon Tyne where he was trained in the use of radar using Anson and Oxford aircraft. During his stay there, Miller was thrown on his back during a wrestling match, sustaining an injury that caused him recurring problems in later years, diminishing his ability to bowl.|$|E

60|$|And {{there is}} always a banker. You can tell him by his good clothes. Popley, in the bank, <b>wears</b> <b>his</b> banking suit. When he goes fishing he <b>wears</b> <b>his</b> fishing suit.

5|$|Meanwhile, three Predators {{consisting}} of Scar, Celtic and Chopper arrive and kill all the humans on the surface. They {{make their way}} down to the pyramid and arrive just as the team unwittingly activates the structure. The Alien Queen awakes from cryogenic stasis and begins to produce eggs. When the eggs hatch, several facehuggers attach themselves to humans trapped in the sacrificial chamber. Chestbursters emerge from the humans and quickly grow into adult Aliens. Conflict erupts between the Predators, Aliens, and humans, resulting in several deaths. Celtic and Chopper are killed by an Alien, and Weyland buys Alexa and Italian archaeologist Sebastian De Rosa (Raoul Bova) enough time to escape from Scar, giving his life in the process. The two witness Scar kill a facehugger and an Alien with a shuriken before unmasking and marking himself with the blood of the facehugger. After Alexa and Sebastian leave, another facehugger attaches itself to Scar due to him not <b>wearing</b> <b>his</b> mask.|$|E
5|$|Näslund {{subsequently}} {{joined the}} Penguins for the 1993–94 season. Due to teammate Bryan Trottier already <b>wearing</b> <b>his</b> Modo jersey number, 19, he chose number 29 instead. He {{appeared in his}} first NHL game on 5 October 1993 against the Philadelphia Flyers. Five days later, he registered his first NHL point, an assist, during {{a game against the}} Quebec Nordiques. His first NHL goal came the following month on 9 November 1993 in a 3–3 tie against the St. Louis Blues. The goal came in the first period on the powerplay against goaltender Curtis Joseph, assisted by Doug Brown and Marty McSorley. Upon entering the NHL, Näslund struggled and was admittedly frustrated with himself. As a result, he was demoted to the Penguins' International Hockey League (IHL) affiliate, the Cleveland Lumberjacks, on several occasions. He finished his rookie campaign with four goals and seven assists in 71games. Although the Penguins qualified for the 1994 playoffs, Näslund did not participate in post-season play, being made a healthy scratch (non-dressing player), and watched as Washington eliminated Pittsburgh in the first round.|$|E
5|$|Potter {{either had}} no live {{models for the}} eastern {{chipmunk}} characters, or borrowed a pet chipmunk from a cousin. Initially, {{she may have been}} unsure of how to draw the chipmunks and chose to clothe them, then was forced to follow suit and clothe the two main players as well, while leaving the other squirrels in their natural state. Or, she may have clothed Timmy and Goody because they collect their nuts in sacks (an unnatural way for squirrels to behave) in imitation of a ruse she employed in Peter Rabbit when Peter only walks on his hind legs while <b>wearing</b> <b>his</b> blue jacket. When he loses his jacket, he reverts to being an animal and moves about on all fours. Because Timmy and Chippy were not drawn from nature, the two suggest stuffed animals in their lack of engaging facial expressions.|$|E
