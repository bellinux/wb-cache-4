'The sufferings,' he says, 'which {{revolution}} entailed {{upon the}} cities were many and terrible, such as have <b>occurred</b> and always <b>will</b> <b>occurs</b> {{as long as}} human nature remains the same, though in a severer or milder form, and varying in their symptoms according to the variety of the particular cases.|$|R
5|$|Approximately every 2.5 or 2.6 years, {{the object}} {{comes back to}} the point in the solar system where the 1990 {{encounter}} occurred, and the earth {{comes back to the}} same point every year.

5|$|As the {{understanding}} of geodynamics improves, these models {{will be subject to}} revision. In 2008, for example, a computer simulation was used to predict that a reorganization of the mantle convection <b>will</b> <b>occur</b> over the next 100 million years, causing a supercontinent composed of Africa, Eurasia, Australia, Antarctica and South America to form around Antarctica.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{given that}} the way {{airborne}} ash is deposited after an eruption is strongly influenced by the meteorological conditions, a certain variation of the ash type <b>will</b> <b>occur,</b> {{as a function of}} distance to the volcano or time elapsed from eruption. The ash from Mount St. Helens is no exception, and hence the ash properties have large variations.|$|E
40|$|Error {{is a part}} of human. Despite that {{organizations}} are trying to reduce error to the zero level, this goal is unachievable. As far as human operation is taking place in a complicated environment, error <b>will</b> <b>occurred,</b> and its possibility would be increased under the conditions of stress, extra loading work, and fatigue. |$|R
50|$|The first {{controversy}} over Triumph of the <b>Will</b> <b>occurred</b> even before its release, when several generals in the Wehrmacht protested over the minimal army {{presence in the}} film. Only one scene—the review of the German cavalry—actually involved the German military. The other formations were party organizations that {{were not part of}} the military.|$|R

5|$|If the {{resulting}} short-circuit current is {{high enough to}} trip the circuit breaker then disruption of service <b>will</b> <b>occur.</b> Ash-induced flashover across transformer insulation (bushings) can burn, etch or crack the insulation irreparably and will likely result in the disruption of power supply.|$|E
5|$|Polistes exclamans live {{in social}} nests that are open combed. This leaves nests very {{susceptible}} to attacks by predators and by parasitoids. Attack by parasitoids <b>will</b> <b>occur</b> {{in the nest}} brood, as the invader will attempt to insert its own offspring into the host’s nest. The two most common parasitoids are Chalcoela iphitalis and Elasmus polistis.|$|E

5|$|When {{the park}} was proclaimed, land zoning {{regulations}} allowed existing mining prospecting rights to continue. These rights were restricted to previously mined areas; this coupled with further restrictions imposed by the National Parks and Wildlife Service Act (1972) make it unlikely that mining <b>will</b> <b>occur</b> in the future.|$|E
5|$|When the {{shrinking}} visible {{part of the}} photosphere becomes very small, Baily's beads <b>will</b> <b>occur.</b> These are caused by the sunlight still being able to reach the Earth through lunar valleys. Totality then begins with the diamond ring effect, the last bright flash of sunlight.|$|E
5|$|As {{indicated}} in the table below, each basin uses a separate system of terminology, which can make comparisons between different basins difficult. In the Pacific Ocean, hurricanes from the Central North Pacific sometimes cross the 180th meridian into the Northwest Pacific, becoming typhoons (such as Hurricane/Typhoon Ioke in 2006); on rare occasions, the reverse <b>will</b> <b>occur.</b> It {{should also be noted}} that typhoons with 1-minute sustained winds greater than 67 metres per second (m/s), over , are called Super Typhoons by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center.|$|E

In January 2010, Hsu declared his candidacy in the 2010 municipal election. During the DPP primary election in May, he lost to fellow Tainan politician William Lai by 12% of the votes, ending his candidacy.|$|E
5|$|If {{the target}} value {{is greater than}} the {{greatest}} value in the array, and the last index of the array is the maximum representable value of L, the value of L will eventually become too large and overflow. A similar problem <b>will</b> <b>occur</b> if the target value is smaller than the least value in the array and the first index of the array is the smallest representable value of R. In particular, this means that R must not be an unsigned type if the array starts with index 0.|$|E
5|$|In October 2012, the National Council {{announced}} that, as {{a result}} of the findings and recommendations of a select committee made up of volunteer Scouters, the Cub Scout and Venturing programs would transition to use of the Boy Scout Oath and Promise, and in the case of the Venturers, the Boy Scout three-finger salute and sign as well. The Venturing change <b>will</b> <b>occur</b> in late 2013 or early 2014; the Cub Scout change will take effect in mid-2015.|$|E

5|$|It is safe {{to observe}} the total phase of a solar eclipse {{directly}} only when the Sun's photosphere is completely covered by the Moon, and not before or after totality. During this period, the Sun is too dim to be seen through filters. The Sun's faint corona will be visible, and the chromosphere, solar prominences, and possibly even a solar flare may be seen. At the end of totality, the same effects <b>will</b> <b>occur</b> in reverse order, and {{on the opposite side}} of the Moon.|$|E
5|$|Lightning is an {{electrical}} discharge {{that occurs in}} a thunderstorm. It {{can be seen in}} the form of a bright streak (or bolt) from the sky. Lightning occurs when {{an electrical}} charge is built up within a cloud, due to static electricity generated by supercooled water droplets colliding with ice crystals near the freezing level. When a large enough charge is built up, a large discharge <b>will</b> <b>occur</b> and can be seen as lightning.|$|E
5|$|Mesoscale {{discussions are}} issued to provide {{information}} on certain individual regions where severe weather is becoming a threat and states whether a watch is likely and details thereof, particularly concerning conditions conducive {{for the development of}} severe thunderstorms in the short term, as well as situations of isolated severe weather when watches are not necessary. Watches are issued when forecasters are confident that severe weather <b>will</b> <b>occur,</b> and usually precede the onset of severe weather by one hour, although this sometimes varies depending on certain atmospheric conditions that may inhibit or accelerate convective development.|$|E

In solving non-convex optimization problem, the coriolis phenomena <b>will</b> <b>occurred</b> and affect the convergence, even by using the established step size procedure.

The results showed that the modified algorithm guaranteed the convergence of the steepest descent method to the solution...|$|R
