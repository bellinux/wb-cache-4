25|$|Opening and {{closure of}} the stomatal pore is {{mediated}} by changes in the turgor pressure of the two guard cells.The turgor pressure of guard cells is controlled by movements of large quantities of ions and sugars {{into and out of}} the guard cells. When guard cells take up these solutes, the <b>water</b> <b>potential</b> (Ψ) inside the cells decreases (creating a hypotonic solution), causing osmotic water flow into the guard cells. This leads to a turgor pressure increase causing swelling of the guard cells and the stomatal pores open. The ions that are taken up by guard cells are mainly potassium (K+) ions and chloride (Cl−) ions. In addition guard cells take up sugars that also contribute to opening of the stomatal pores.|$|E
40|$|Cyclic and noncyclic {{photophosphorylation}} and electron transport by photosystem 1, photosystem 2, {{and from}} water to methyl viologen (“whole chain”) were studied in chloroplasts isolated from sunflower (Helianthus annus L. var Russian Mammoth) leaves {{that had been}} desiccated to varying degrees. Electron transport showed considerable inhibition at leaf <b>water</b> <b>potentials</b> of − 9 bars when the chloroplasts were exposed to an uncoupler in vitro, and it continued to decline in activity as leaf <b>water</b> <b>potentials</b> decreased. Electron transport by photosystem 2 and coupled electron transport by photosystem 1 and the whole chain were unaffected at leaf <b>water</b> <b>potentials</b> of − 10 to − 11 bars but became progressively inhibited between leaf <b>water</b> <b>potentials</b> of − 11 and − 17 bars. A low, stable activity remained at leaf <b>water</b> <b>potentials</b> below − 17 bars. In contrast, both types of photophosphorylation were unaffected by leaf <b>water</b> <b>potentials</b> of − 10 to − 11 bars, but then ultimately became zero at leaf <b>water</b> <b>potentials</b> of − 17 bars. Although the chloroplasts isolated from the desiccated leaves were coupled at leaf <b>water</b> <b>potentials</b> of − 11 to − 12 bars, they became progressively uncoupled as leaf <b>water</b> <b>potentials</b> decreased to − 17 bars. Abscisic acid and ribonuclease {{had no effect on}} chloroplast photophosphorylation. The results are generally consistent with the idea that chloroplast activity begins to decrease at the same leaf <b>water</b> <b>potentials</b> that cause stomatal closure in sunflower leaves and that chloroplast electron transport begins to limit photosynthesis at leaf <b>water</b> <b>potentials</b> below about − 11 bars. However, it suggests that, during severe desiccation, the limitation may shift from electron transport to photophosphorylation...|$|R

25|$|Guatemala, as its (Mayan) name indicates, {{is a land}} of forests. The {{country is}} also mountainous and {{rainfall}} is influenced by Pacific and Atlantic ocean weather patterns such as El Niño, La Niña, and hurricanes. The Caribbean Sea influences rainfall patterns in Guatemala in the same way. Average rainfall varies from 700mm {{per year in the}} eastern regions of the country to around 1,000mm in the central regions, and 5,000mm of rainfall in the northeastern regions. The current population in the mountainous northwestern zone numbers around five million inhabitants and this region has high levels of rainfall (up to 4,000mm per year) and steep slopes that are susceptible to erosion. This region is an area with great <b>water</b> <b>potential,</b> but also subject to irreversible damage from soil loss and the alteration of the water cycle.|$|E
25|$|When {{the roots}} begin to sense a water {{shortage}} in the soil, abscisic acid (ABA) is released. ABA binds to receptor proteins in the guard cells' plasma membrane and cytosol, which first raises the pH of the cytosol {{of the cells}} and cause the concentration of free Ca2+ to increase in the cytosol due to influx from outside the cell and release of Ca2+ from internal stores such as the endoplasmic reticulum and vacuoles. This causes the chloride (Cl−) and organic ions to exit the cells. Second, this stops the uptake of any further K+ into the cells and, subsequently, the loss of K+. The loss of these solutes causes an increase in <b>water</b> <b>potential,</b> which results in the diffusion of water {{back out of the}} cell by osmosis. This makes the cell plasmolysed, which results in the closing of the stomatal pores.|$|E
25|$|When {{conditions}} are conducive to stomatal opening (e.g., high light intensity and high humidity), a proton pump drives protons (H+) from the guard cells. This {{means that the}} cells' electrical potential becomes increasingly negative. The negative potential opens potassium voltage-gated channels and so an uptake of potassium ions (K+) occurs. To maintain this internal negative voltage so that entry of potassium ions does not stop, negative ions balance the influx of potassium. In some cases, chloride ions enter, while in other plants the organic ion malate is produced in guard cells. This increase in solute concentration lowers the <b>water</b> <b>potential</b> inside the cell, which results in the diffusion of water into the cell through osmosis. This increases the cell's volume and turgor pressure. Then, because of rings of cellulose microfibrils that prevent {{the width of the}} guard cells from swelling, and thus only allow the extra turgor pressure to elongate the guard cells, whose ends are held firmly in place by surrounding epidermal cells, the two guard cells lengthen by bowing apart from one another, creating an open pore through which gas can move.|$|E

While {{the impact of the}} ephemeral Kuiseb river on soil water availability was assessed through the four species’ plant-internal water relations, comparable pre-dawn <b>water</b> <b>potentials</b> of V. erioloba at both sites indicate soil water availability also in the dunes of Namibrand. The extreme midday <b>water</b> <b>potentials</b> of the dune plants possibly show the upper limit of tolerance for V. erioloba.|$|R
40|$|The role of {{photosynthesis}} and transpiration in the desiccation-induced {{inhibition of}} acetylene reduction (nitrogen fixation) {{was investigated in}} soybean (Glycine max [L. ] Merr. var. Beeson) using an apparatus that permitted simultaneous measurements of acetylene reduction, net photosynthesis, and transpiration. The inhibition of acetylene reduction caused by low <b>water</b> <b>potentials</b> and their aftereffects could be reproduced by depriving shoots of atmospheric CO 2 even though the soil remained at <b>water</b> <b>potentials</b> that should have favored rapid acetylene reduction. The inhibition of acetylene reduction at low <b>water</b> <b>potentials</b> could be partially reversed by exposing the shoots to high CO 2 concentrations. When transpiration was varied independently of photosynthesis and dark respiration in plants having high <b>water</b> <b>potentials,</b> no effects on acetylene reduction could be observed. There was no correlation between transpiration and acetylene reduction in the CO 2 experiments. Therefore, the correlation that was observed between transpiration and acetylene reduction during desiccation was fortuitous. We conclude that the inhibition of shoot photosynthesis accounted for the inhibition of nodule acetylene reduction at low <b>water</b> <b>potentials...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{success of}} a plant depends in part {{on its ability to}} locate water while {{securely}} anchoring in the soil. Cellular growth in roots is driven by water uptake and resulting increases in turgor pressure. Low <b>water</b> <b>potentials</b> slow the rate of primary root growth and induce a suite of changes in the growth zone. To better understand the effects of low <b>water</b> <b>potentials</b> on the growth and structure of primary roots, Zea mays seedlings were grown in different concentrations of polyethylene glycol solution. The effects of low <b>water</b> <b>potentials</b> on the <b>water</b> content, the spatial distribution of growth, and the mechanical properties of the root throughout the growth zone were quantified. Low <b>water</b> <b>potentials</b> decreased the total amount of water in roots and the percent water composition of roots. Low <b>water</b> <b>potentials</b> also decreased relative elemental growth rate and shifted the region of maximal growth rate towards the root tip. Because of water stress induced root thinning and cell wall stress relaxation at the cellular level, low <b>water</b> <b>potentials</b> were expected to alter the mechanical properties of roots. Engineering beam theory was adapted to test for water stress induced changes in the spatial distributions of flexural stiffness (EI), the product of the material term E (Young's modulus of elasticity) and the geometrical term I (second moment of area). Low <b>water</b> <b>potentials</b> decreased EI of roots, due mostly to root thinning (and thus reductions of I). Increasing water stress had no consistent effects on E, suggesting the existence of compensatory mechanisms to maintain root material properties despite cellular changes in wall properties due to water stress. Root thinning in low <b>water</b> <b>potentials</b> results from the promotion of longitudinal over lateral growth to facilitate finding deeper water sources. Though water stress weakens roots by reducing EI, soil impedance has been shown previously to cause root thickening. Soil impedance could thus offset root thinning by low <b>water</b> <b>potentials</b> and increase EI of roots by increasing I. Further studies should test the hypothesis that water stress and impedance have counterbalancing effects on root mechanical properties, thus promoting deep penetration of soils for water while maintaining the mechanical properties necessary for penetrating hard soils...|$|R
25|$|The {{height of}} S.sempervirens is {{closely tied to}} fog availability; taller trees become less {{frequent}} as fog becomes less frequent. As S.sempervirens’ height increases, transporting water via <b>water</b> <b>potential</b> to the leaves becomes increasingly more difficult due to gravity. Despite the high rainfall that the region receives (up to 100cm), the leaves in the upper canopy are perpetually stressed for water. This water stress is exacerbated by long droughts in the summer. Water stress is believed to cause the morphological changes in the leaves, stimulating reduced leaf length and increased leaf succulence. To supplement their water needs, redwoods utilize frequent summer fog events. Fog water is absorbed through multiple pathways. Leaves directly take in fog from the surrounding air through the epidermal tissue, bypassing the xylem. Coast redwoods also absorb water directly through their bark. The uptake of water through leaves and bark repairs and reduces the severity of xylem embolisms, which occur when cavitations form in the xylem preventing the transport of water and nutrients. Fog may also collect on redwood leaves, drip to the forest floor, and be absorbed by the tree's roots. This fog drip may form 30% of the total water used by a tree in a year.|$|E

In others, it substitutes for potassium in several roles, such as maintaining turgor pressure and aiding {{in the opening}} and closing of stomata. Excess sodium in the soil can limit [...] the uptake of water by decreasing the <b>water</b> <b>potential,</b> which may result in plant wilting; excess concentrations in the cytoplasm can lead to enzyme inhibition, which in turn causes necrosis and chlorosis. In response, some plants have developed mechanisms to limit sodium uptake in the roots, to store it in cell vacuoles, and restrict salt transport from roots to leaves; excess sodium may also be stored in old plant tissue, limiting the damage to new growth. Halophytes have adapted {{to be able to}} flourish in sodium rich environments.|$|E

40|$|Portulacaria afra (L.) Jacq. is a {{perennial}} facultative CAM species showing a seasonal shift from C 3 to CAM photosynthesis. The shift to CAM {{during the summer}} occurs despite continued irrigation of the plants. The authors examined {{the hypothesis that the}} seasonal shift to CAM occurred because of low transient <b>water</b> <b>potentials.</b> They measured changes in whole leaf water, osmotic and pressure potentials {{over the course of the}} shift. They also studied changes in enzyme activity to ascertain if PEP carboxylase and PEP carboxykinase were induced during the seasonal shift to CAM. <b>Water</b> <b>potentials</b> were high, from - 0. 1 to - 0. 5 MPa, predawn and midday, when the C 3 pathway of photosynthesis was utilized. Osmotic potentials were constant, from - 0. 7 to - 0. 8 MPa, indicating very little change in turgor. P. afra shifted to CAM indicated by large diurnal acid fluctuations (300 400 meq m− 2) despite C 3 -like predawn <b>water</b> <b>potentials.</b> Midday <b>water</b> <b>potentials</b> usually decreased 0. 2 - 0. 7 MPa, while the osmotic potential remained unchanged or decreased slightly. Thus, a midday loss of turgor was associated with the use of the CAM pathway. The results support the hypothesis that the induction of CAM occurred due to low transient <b>water</b> <b>potentials</b> and may be partially mediated through the loss of turgor. The shift to CAM is only a partial induction with PEP carboxykinase showing high activity all year round while PEP carboxylase increases three-to five-fold over C 3 levels. Relatively high levels of CAM enzyme activity enables the utilization of the CAM pathway in the winter and spring in response to high daytime temperatures and increased evaporative demand.
