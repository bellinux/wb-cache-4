5|$|Because {{of the low}} wage at América Mineiro, he {{was forced}} to quit {{football}} to take various jobs as a labourer, a carpenter, and a worker in a sweet factory. It looked as if this <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of his childhood dream. As a factory-worker Gilberto earned the equivalent of about £50 a month by 2002 rates. After three years of working in a factory, the 18-year-old decided to try his luck at football again by enrolling in the local club's youth academy. His time in the academy did not last long due to the worsening situation at home {{as a result of his}} mother's ill health; he returned to work in the sweet factory with little hope of resurrecting his football career.|$|E
5|$|On July 9, the US 2nd Infantry Division, {{with several}} armor and antiaircraft {{artillery}} units, {{was ordered to}} proceed to the Far East. The next day, MacArthur requested that the 2nd Division be brought to full war strength, if possible, without delaying its departure. He also reiterated his need of the units required to bring the four infantry divisions already in the Far East to full war strength. He detailed these as four heavy tank battalions, 12 heavy tank companies, 11 infantry battalions, 11 field artillery battalions, and four antiaircraft automatic weapons battalions per division. By August 7, the US 9th Infantry Regiment was operational in Korea, and {{had been sent to}} the Naktong Bulge area. However it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the month before the rest of the 2nd Infantry Division arrived in Korea.|$|E
25|$|The point {{really about}} all this from our {{perspective}} {{has been that the}} critical role we should play is to assist the Zimbabweans to find each other, really to agree among themselves about the political, economic, social, other solutions that their country needs. We could have stepped aside from that task and then shouted, and that <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of our contribution... They would shout back at us and that <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the story. I'm actually the only head of government that I know anywhere in the world who has actually gone to Zimbabwe and spoken publicly very critically {{of the things that they}} are doing.|$|E

25|$|During a May 15 {{speech in}} Columbus, Ohio, McCain {{laid out his}} vision for January 2013, which <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of his first term granted he won the presidency.

He pledged a bipartisan approach to governing a robust economy as well, and the implementation of a flat tax rate.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 16th century, the Ottoman Empire started {{spreading}} over the region, reaching South East Europe. The Spanish king Charles V feared that if Rome {{fell to the}} Turks, it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of Christian Europe. In 1522, Suleiman I drove the Knights Hospitaller of St. John out of Rhodes. They dispersed to their commanderies in Europe. Wanting to protect Rome from invasion from the south, in 1530, Charles V handed over the island to these knights.|$|E
25|$|Also nonbreaking hyphen, {{non-breaking hyphen}} and {{no-break}} hyphen. This character looks {{identical to the}} regular hyphen, but it is treated as a letter by word processors, namely that the hyphenated word will not be divided at the hyphen should this fall at what <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> {{of a line of}} text; instead, the whole hyphenated word either will remain in full {{at the end of the}} line or will go in full to the beginning of the next line. The non-breaking space exists for similar reasons.|$|E

25|$|As {{the band}} was about to return home from the European tour, UK customs {{detained}} Colombian drummer Robo due to visa problems, {{and he was not}} allowed back into the country. This <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of his tenure with the band (he eventually was able {{to get back into the}} United States and in 1983 would join the Misfits as their drummer). The loss of Robo put an end to extensive touring for a while. Emil Johnson of Twisted Roots filled in for one tour, but it was clear he was only temporary.|$|E
25|$|Rime {{was hired}} as coach ahead of the 1977 season, which ended in only a single win, last place {{in the league and}} relegation. The {{following}} season would see Rosenborg play a local derby {{for the first time in}} twelve years, against Strindheim, and the club management was worried that the relegation <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the club's position as the city's premier team. The club moved its offices into a German barracks from the war, located outside Lerkendal and Eggen was again hired as coach. The season saw the break-through of three young players—Øivind Husby, Ola By Rise and Knut Torbjørn Eggen—and ended with Rosenborg winning the league and being promoted and Eggen becoming top scorer.|$|E
25|$|Those mining {{communities}} {{had good}} working class values {{and a sense}} of family values. The men did real men's heavy work going down the pit. There were also some very close-knit communities which were able to deal with the few troublesome kids. If they had any problems they would take the kid round the back and give them a good clip round the ear and that <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of that. Many of these communities were completely devastated, with people out of work turning to drugs and no real man's work because all the jobs had gone. There is no doubt that this led to a breakdown in these communities with families breaking up and youths going out of control. The scale of the closures went too far. The damage done to those communities was enormous {{as a result of the}} strike.|$|E

25|$|During {{the relief}} attempt Vere was {{inspecting}} the English trenches when heavy fighting broke {{out as a}} sally was launched on the position. The Spanish were repelled but Vere was severely injured when a bullet went through his head beneath his eye and became embedded in his skull. For Vere it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the war but the bullet was removed as he took up rest in Ryswick and {{was not able to}} take to the field again {{by the end of the}} year. As a consequence of Vere's wound the young Frederick Henry who was only eighteen years old took over Vere's command, while Horace Vere (brother to Francis) took over the English troops in the field. The Earl of Leicester arrived at the siege in late August in case Francis' wound was mortal and needed to fill in his command but this was denied by Queen Elizabeth I.|$|E
25|$|Bradshaw threw a 2-yard {{touchdown}} pass to tight end Bennie Cunningham in the third quarter, and later a 9-yard {{touchdown pass}} to Stallworth that gave the Steelers a 28-17 lead three plays into the fourth quarter. But this <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of his success as he completed only three of his next 11 passes in the final quarter. The next time Pittsburgh had the ball, cornerback Jeff Allen intercepted Bradshaw's pass and returned it eight yards to the Steelers 29-yard line. Pittsburgh defensive back Mel Blount intercepted a pass {{in the end zone}} on the second play of the ensuing drive, but it was eliminated by a holding penalty on linebacker Jack Ham. Five plays later, Fouts cut the score to 28-24 with an 8-yard {{touchdown pass to}} Winslow. Following six consecutive handoffs by Bradshaw, San Diego got the ball back on their own 36-yard line due to a 20-yard punt by John Goodson with four minutes left in the game. Four runs by Muncie moved the ball 33 yards to a third and 7 situation on the Steelers 12-yard line. On the next play, Fouts connected with Winslow on a screen pass, and the tight end took {{it all the way to}} the end zone for the game winning score with less than a minute left on the clock.|$|E
25|$|Wilson {{contemplated}} {{standing for}} Parliament. In 1916 the Conservative Party chairman Arthur Steel-Maitland {{had offered to}} get him a seat. Esher and Duncannon proposed forming a new “National” party of 20–30 MPs, which would include David Davies {{who had been on}} the mission to Russia. The new party’s policies would include more vigorous prosecution of the war – Wilson urged Irish conscription – and the detachment of Turkey and Bulgaria. Wilson was worried that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of his army career (he was also short of money – he had a private income of £300 a year, and half pay of £600 (£450 after tax) – but his house at Eaton Place was costing him £1,500 a year). His brother Jemmy proposed getting him an Ulster seat, and thought that the prospect of Wilson as an MP would annoy Robertson (who told Wilson that there was no army job for him in Britain), but the Irish Unionist leader Carson thought an English seat more sensible. Bonar Law was dismissive of Wilson’s hopes that, like J.C.Smuts, he might be invited to join the War Policy Committee, and also poured cold water on the idea of Wilson becoming an MP. Wilson did not agree with Milner’s suggestion that he succeed Sarrail as Commander-in-Chief at Salonika. Éamon de Valera of Sinn Féin had recently won the East Clare by-election (caused by the death of Willie Redmond) and on a visit to Currygrane (his first in eight years) everyone Wilson spoke to – judges, landowners, police officers, a Redmondite local politician and “some natives” agreed on the need for conscription. Brock Millman argued that the threat to stand for Parliament was blackmail to get a military job out of Lloyd George, but Keith Jeffery rejects this, arguing that Wilson would have been no threat as a new MP but as a military adviser was a useful rival to Robertson, whom by July 1917 French was telling Wilson Lloyd George wanted to remove.|$|E

In a pre-broadcast interview by Entertainment Weekly with Killen and actor Jason Isaacs, Isaacs claimed that he found it [...] "strangely ironic and amusing" [...] to be promoting the series finale of the Awake series.

Sykes wanted to continue, although Gorham had had enough. The tour was successful, and some concerts were recorded to compile a live album. Partway into the tour, many of Thin Lizzy's past guitarists were invited onstage to contribute to some of the songs they had originally recorded, the only exception being Snowy White. The album was released in October 1983 as Life, which included an older performance of [...] "Renegade" [...] featuring White, and reached no. 29 in the UK. The tour continued while two more singles were released, the last of them, [...] "The Sun Goes Down", only reaching no. 52 in August. Lynott also undertook another solo tour, accompanied by Downey and Sykes, under the name of The Three Musketeers.|$|E
500|$|Co-showrunners Jeff Pinkner and J.H. Wyman co-wrote the episode's teleplay, while Pinkner, Wyman, and {{consulting}} producer Akiva Goldsman co-wrote the story. Executive producer Joe Chappelle served as director. A full season renewal of Fringe was announced on March 24, 2011. They {{had written the}} finale without knowing {{if there would be}} another season, but decided not to make any changes to the script even after hearing of its renewal. Pinkner explained that [...] "we wrote the episode, perhaps foolishly, assuming that we would be on for Season 4. We never for one second entertained that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the series. So therefore, we didn't have to change a word!" [...] In an interview with the New York Post, Pinkner warned that events in the finale will [...] "unfurl in a very unexpected way for the characters and the audience". He also commented that the finale [...] "hopefully will make you sort of revisit and look at everything that's happened all year through a fresh pair of glasses".|$|E
500|$|The {{final three}} episodes {{of the season}} were [...] "linked in one {{continuous}} story arc," [...] and meant to seem like [...] "you're turning the last page of a chapter in a novel.

[...] The crew wrote the finale before the season was officially renewed, but deigned to leave it unchanged once discovering that a fourth season had been approved.
