50|$|In {{operations}} research, Johnson's rule is {{a method}} of scheduling jobs in two <b>work</b> <b>centers.</b> Its primary objective is to find an optimal sequence of jobs to reduce makespan (the total {{amount of time it}} takes to complete all jobs). It also reduces the amount of idle time between the two work centers.The method minimizes the makespan in the case of two <b>work</b> <b>centers.</b> Furthermore, the method finds the shortest makespan in the case of three <b>work</b> <b>centers</b> if additional constraints are met.|$|R

25|$|Until the B.E.S.T. {{company was}} taken over by the municipality, only the Colaba depot was {{available}} for the maintenance of buses and minor repairs. As the fleet grew, the need for more depots was felt. In 1961 the fleet comprised 1045 buses. Six new depots were constructed for their maintenance. The Wadala depot was equipped for the maintenance of 300 buses. At this time it was the largest depot in Asia. After this, taking long maintenance experience into account, the authorities decided that no depot should be called on to look after more than 125 to 150 buses. Accordingly, small depots were built at convenient spots in the city and its suburbs. Every depot is another <b>work</b> <b>center,</b> which provides bus services effectively on every day, carries out preventive maintenance as well as repairs on buses. Depots carry out maintenance practices such as preventive maintenance, unit replacement, RTO passing, body damage repairs of buses. BEST buses are operated out of the 26 bus depot located in four zones viz. City, Central, Western, Eastern & Suburban zones.|$|E

2500|$|In 2001, a Portland {{alternative}} newspaper, the Willamette Week {{guided by}} the complaint of a student, reported that an Oregon school of process oriented psychology, (one of 26 worldwide schools of process oriented psychology), the Process <b>Work</b> <b>Center</b> of Portland (now known as the Process Work Institute) was being investigated by the Oregon Office of Degree Authorization (ODA) due to a complaint by a student and an anonymous letter with the primary complaint that teachers in the Masters in Process Work shared student information inappropriately, and that relationship and sexual boundaries were not clear between students.' Some allegations were not verified while others were [...] "substantially correct". ODA recommended improvements in privacy policies and dual relationship policies between students and faculty. PWI complied with changes requested during the investigation and the degree remained continuously authorized {{by the state of}} Oregon degree authorization office. The Process Work Institute does not have regional accreditation and does not participate in DOE Title IV lending. Small schools in the Pacific NW are not eligible for regional accreditation unless they have 300 or more active students. PWI is currently pursuing national accreditation which is allowed in the USA for smaller schools. [...] Other schools of Process Work internationally such as in Switzerland, Poland, the UK, and Australia have been able to become accredited either regionally, nationally, or by psychological professional accrediting boards. The ODA website shows that in 2014 the Process Work Institute is authorised as a degree offering institution and lists PWI as one of the unaccredited private colleges approved for students in Oregon.|$|E
