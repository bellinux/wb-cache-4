2500|$|The {{new ground}} {{was ready for}} use in 1809 and so Lord had two grounds at his {{disposal}} for the 1809 and 1810 seasons. The North Bank ground was sub-let to St John's <b>Wood</b> <b>Cricket</b> Club, which eventually merged with MCC. Lord officially took over his second ground on 8 May 1811 by literally re-laying there his turf from the Old Ground. He did this so that [...] "the noblemen {{and gentlemen of the}} MCC should be able to play on the same footing as before". According to Warner, however, the relocation was unpopular with many MCC members and, as a result, the club played no matches there in either 1811 or 1812. This may have been so but cricket generally was in decline at the time because of the Napoleonic Wars. The Association of Cricket Statisticians and Historians (the ACS) holds that [...] "(from) 1810 to 1814 the game was all but dead", largely because of the war and [...] "the very real threat of civil unrest in England". The second venue is now generally known as Lord's Middle Ground. In the three years that Lord controlled it, only six matches are known to have taken place there and just three of these (all in 1813) involved MCC. The Middle Ground's exact location is uncertain but it is understood to have been in North Bank {{at the north end of}} Lisson Grove and that the Regent's Canal has been cut through it. This means that it was partially on the canal route and somewhere in the area now bounded by Lisson Grove (the B507) to south-west, Lodge Road to north-west, Park Road (the A41) to north-east and the Regent's Canal to south-east. It was less than 300 metres from the site of the modern Lord's ground.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{ability of}} the insect cercal system to detect {{approaching}} predators has been studied extensively in the laboratory and in the field. Some previous studies have assessed {{the extent to which}} sensory noise affects the operational characteristics of the cercal system, but these studies have only been carried out in laboratory settings using white noise stimuli of unrealistic nature. Using a piston mimicking the natural airflow of an approaching predator, we recorded the neural activity through the abdominal connectives from the terminal abdominal ganglion of freely moving <b>wood</b> <b>crickets</b> (Nemobius sylvestris) in a semi-field situation. A cluster analysis of spike amplitudes revealed six clusters, or ʻunitsʼ, corresponding to six different subsets of cercal interneurons. No spontaneous activity was recorded for the units of larger amplitude, reinforcing the idea they correspond to the largest giant interneurons. Many of the cercal units are already activated by background noise, sometimes only weakly, and the approach of a predator is signaled by an increase in their activity, in particular for the larger-amplitude units. A scaling law predicts that the cumulative number of spikes {{is a function of the}} velocity of the flow perceived at the rear of the cricket, including a multiplicative factor that increases linearly with piston velocity. We discuss the implications of this finding in terms of how the cricket might infer the imminence and nature of a predatory attack...|$|R

40|$|Current {{woodland}} restoration {{programs are}} increasingly focussing {{on the creation}} of habitat networks in order to increase woodland cover and connectivity. However, the basic assumptions underpinning such strategies are largely untested for species associated with woodland habitat. For many woodland invertebrate species, local scale processes are potentially more important than processes operating at the landscape scale in terms of species persistence, especially for those species that show high dependence on woodland habitat conditions and have limited dispersal ability. The applicability of landscape-scale approaches to woodland restoration therefore needed to be evaluated in relation to the ecological characteristics of invertebrates. This thesis examines these issues and provides a quantitative analysis of the factors influencing presence of <b>wood</b> <b>cricket</b> (Nemobius sylvestris) at multiple scales within the landscape. The investigation was conducted in woodland habitats on the Isle of Wight in the south of the United Kingdom. A landscape-scale survey indicated that <b>wood</b> <b>cricket</b> was found predominantly in large woodland fragments situated in close proximity to each other, with ancient woodland characteristics and with a high amount of edge habitat. The current pattern of distribution of <b>wood</b> <b>cricket</b> suggested that most woodland fragments in the agricultural matrix are effectively isolated from each other, indicating the importance of maintaining a high level of connectivity between habitats for this invertebrate species. An investigation within woodlands indicated that locations with permanent low cover of ground vegetation, low canopy closure and high availability of leaf litter were the preferred habitat conditions for <b>wood</b> <b>cricket.</b> Ride and track edges, woodland peripheries and open areas created and maintained by management activities were found to be the main habitat locations for <b>wood</b> <b>cricket.</b> It was further found that <b>wood</b> <b>cricket</b> was mainly present at permanent edges or in close proximity to these locations, indicating the importance of maintaining these habitat features for this species. The mean dispersal rate for dispersing <b>wood</b> <b>cricket</b> obtained from a series of field experiments was found to be similar to that of other ground-dwelling invertebrate species that were strongly associated with woodland. This level of habitat specialism was consistent with the habitat preferences found for <b>wood</b> <b>cricket,</b> and therefore <b>wood</b> <b>cricket</b> can be seen as representative of this particular group of wood land-associated invertebrates. Comparable to <b>wood</b> <b>cricket,</b> the dispersal ability for species of this group was found to be limited. Few individuals of nymph (i. e. juvenile) and adult <b>wood</b> <b>cricket</b> populations were found to disperse. <b>Wood</b> <b>cricket</b> was found able to disperse up to 55 m into non-woodland habitat and mature habitat corridors were found to be used by <b>wood</b> <b>cricket,</b> but not new immature woodland plantings. The results of this investigation indicate that the overall success of woodland conservation for woodland invertebrates lies in adopting a multi-scale and multimanagement strategic approach. The current initiatives focussing on restoration and re-instatement of traditional management activities within existing woodlands were found to be highly beneficial for <b>wood</b> <b>cricket.</b> Corridors were found to facilitate movement if suitable woodland habitat conditions were provided. Creation of woodland habitat networks might therefore be beneficial for <b>wood</b> <b>cricket</b> if given enough time to develop. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Many prey species, from soil {{arthropods}} to fish, {{perceive the}} approach of predators,allowing them to escape just in time. Thus, prey capture is as importantto predators as prey finding. We extend an existing framework for understandingthe conjoint trajectories of predator and prey after encounters, byestimating the ratio of predator attack and prey danger perception distances,and apply it to wolf spiders attacking <b>wood</b> <b>crickets.</b> Disturbances to air flowupstream from running spiders, which are sensed by crickets, were assessedby computational fluid dynamics with the finite-elements method for amuch simplified spider model: body size, speed and ground effect were allrequired to obtain a faithful representation of the aerodynamic signature ofthe spider, with the legs making only a minor contribution. The relationshipbetween attack speed and the maximal distance at which the cricket canperceive the danger is parabolic; it splits the space defined by these two variablesinto regions differing in their values for this ratio. For this biologicalinteraction, the ratio is no greater than one, implying immediate perceptionof the danger, from the onset of attack. Particular attention should be paid tothe ecomechanical aspects of interactions with such small ratio, because ofthe high degree of bidirectional coupling of the behaviour of the two protagonists. This conclusion applies to several other predator–prey systems withsensory ecologies based on flow sensing, in air and water...|$|R

Results revealed that <b>wood</b> <b>cricket</b> populations were patchily distributed and mainly found in relatively large mature woodland fragments situated closely (< 50 m) to another occupied site. Although the occurrence of <b>wood</b> <b>cricket</b> was related to fragment area, isolation, habitat availability and woodland age, a logistic regression model revealed that presence of the species was most accurately predicted by fragment isolation and area alone.
