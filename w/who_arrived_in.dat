5|$|Author John Macklin {{includes}} an account in his 1965 book, Strange Destinies, of two green children <b>who</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> the Spanish village of Banjos in 1887.

It therefore seems that Macklin's story is an invention inspired by the green children of Woolpit, particularly {{as there is no}} record of any Spanish village called Banjos.|$|E

The Irish Potato Famine of the 1840s significantly increased the pace of Irish immigration to Prince Edward Island and the Province of Canada, with over 35,000 distressed individuals landing in Toronto in 1847 and 1848. Descendants of Francophone and Anglophone northern Europeans <b>who</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries are often referred to as old stock Canadians.|$|E

5|$|Christianity {{had only}} {{recently}} arrived {{in some of these}} kingdoms. Some had been converted by the Gregorian mission, a group of Roman missionaries <b>who</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> Kent in 597 and who mainly influenced southern Britain. Others had been converted by the Hiberno-Scottish mission, chiefly Irish missionaries working in Northumbria and neighbouring kingdoms. A few kingdoms, such as Dál Riata, became Christian but how they did so is unknown. The native Picts, according to the medieval writer Bede, were converted in two stages, initially by native Britons under Ninian, and subsequently by Irish missionaries.|$|E

5|$|King Stephen gave {{permission}} {{for some of}} England's bishops, including Bethune, to attend the Council of Reims in 1148.
