2500|$|In an {{analysis}} of the Clinton email controversy published by the Brookings Institution, Richard Lempert wrote that [...] "security professionals have a reputation for erring in the direction of overclassification." [...] Elizabeth Goitein, co-director of the liberty and national security program at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law, says that [...] "The odds are good that any classified information in the Clinton emails should not have been classified," [...] since an estimated 50 percent to 90 percent of classified documents could be made public without risking national security. Nate Jones, an expert with the National Security Archive at George Washington University, said: [...] "Clinton's mistreatment of federal records and the intelligence community's desire to retroactively overclassify are two distinct troubling problems. No politician is giving the right message: Blame Clinton for poor records practices, but don't embrace overclassification <b>while</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> it."' ...|$|E
2500|$|Critical acclaim {{came from}} Heat which called Wide Awake [...] "The best album ever {{released}} by a winner of The X Factor" [...] {{and gave it}} 5 stars. Unreality Shout praised the album and said it is [...] "the best X Factor winner's album to date, despite it being nearly schizophrenic of nature: one minute you're flouncing you're way {{through some of the}} campest songs of the year ('Real Late Starter', 'Fahrenheit'), throwing some suggestive moves and jazz hands <b>while</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> so, and the next you're relaxing {{in the shade of a}} veranda in the back garden of a country farm house, looking out on fields upon fields of lush greenery ('Smile', 'Wide Awake')." [...] Gay Times gave the songs on the album a positive review. BBC Music said the album is [...] "a disco-dusted debut of giddy pop pleasures." [...] Yahoo! Music gave the album 7/10. 4Music gave the album 4 stars, saying [...] "rather than making the ballad-heavy collection that everyone was expecting, Joe has produced a fun, upbeat pop album which takes its inspiration from acts such as Alphabeat ('Feel the Fire') and Scissor Sisters ('Fahrenheit')" [...] OK! also gave the album 4 stars, saying [...] "recent single 'Ambitions' sets the tone, with its chugging guitars, while 'Someone Wake Me Up' is an epic lighters-aloft stunner and 'Real Late Starter' has a definite Take That vibe." ...|$|E
