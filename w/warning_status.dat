In particular, Twitter {{is one of the}} popular social media platforms, with around 330 million monthly users. From local events such as Fake Patty's Day to across the world happenings - Twitter gets there first. During a disaster, tweets can be used to post <b>warnings,</b> <b>status</b> of available medical and food supply, emergency personnel, and updates. Users were practically tweeting about the Hurricane Sandy, despite lack of network during the storm. Analysis of these tweets can help monitor the disaster, plan and manage the crisis, and aid in research. In this research, we use the publicly available tweets posted during several disasters and identify the relevant tweets. As the languages in the datasets are different, Bing translation API has been used to detect and translate the tweets. The translations are then, used as training datasets for supervised machine learning algorithms. Supervised learning is the process of learning from a labeled training dataset. This learned classifier can then be used to predict the correct output for any valid input. When trained to more observations, the algorithm improves its predictive performance...|$|R

In the system, a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) tester, supported by model-based approaches, simulates vehicle operations in real time and dynamically provides all essential signals to the instrument cluster under test. A machine vision system with advanced image processing algorithms is designed to inspect the visual displays. Experiments demonstrate that the system developed is accurate for measuring the pointer position, bar graph position, pointer angular velocity and indicator flash rate, and is highly robust for validating various functionalities including <b>warning</b> lights <b>status,</b> symbol and text displays. Moreover, the system developed greatly eases the task of tedious validation testing and makes onerous repeated tests possible...|$|R

40|$|Aeronautical ground {{lighting}} (AGL) {{systems have}} been developed to deliver <b>warnings</b> and <b>status</b> indications to pilots and maneuvering area vehicle drivers on runways. Their role in preventing the hazard of runway incursions, present in the aviation industry, is therefore crucial. AGL systems basically consist of a primary series lighting circuit, which is supplied at constant current and high voltage (e. g., 5 kV), and AGL transformers supplying ground lights at their secondary sides. Protection of persons against electric shock in AGL systems cannot be conveyed by disconnection of supply as ground faults would cause the out-of-service of the lighting system, thereby compromising the safety of aerodromes; alternative protective measures are therefore employed. In this paper, the authors examine the electrical safety issues present during maintenance of AGL systems, often performed live in order to guarantee the continuity of the service. Experimental measurements on AGL isolating transformers have been also reported in this paper, and possible solutions to improve the electrical safety of operators are propose...|$|R
