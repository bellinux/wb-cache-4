2500|$|Prior to {{entering}} college, Robinson held {{a short-term}} job as shoeshine man before {{getting a job}} as warehouse personnel. [...] After finishing his college degree, Robinson {{was unable to find}} a suitable career in his hometown of Gulfport. Robinson attributed this to racial discrimination as many of the local garages were under white ownership; speaking to his father, he said, [...] " [...] give me a job sweeping, filling gas tanks, changing tires, or washing, but I'm an engine man... <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> [...] about automotive science they smile, look at each other, and then look at me like I belong behind a mule and a plow." ...|$|E
2500|$|I've {{become more}} patient and more tolerant. A life spent in cricket {{can make you}} very self-centred, so I think I've moved away from that and become more open. People still say I come across as a grumpy old man, though, with a droopy {{moustache}} and a worn-out face. But that's just my exterior. Underneath I'm a much softer person. I haven't {{got rid of the}} moustache and long hair from my cricketing days, which gets a mixed reaction. Babies in prams look at me strangely quite a lot, so <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> them I have to put my finger over my top lip to soften the blow. They think the hair bear bunch [...] have arrived.|$|E
2500|$|Williams {{retired from}} {{acting in the}} early 1960s and later turned down the role of Belle Rosen, a {{character}} with a crucial swimming scene, in The Poseidon Adventure. (The role eventually went to Shelley Winters.) She continued to lend her name to a line of retro women's swimwear. [...] "Women worldwide are fighting a thing called gravity," [...] said Williams. [...] "I say to women <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> them, 'You girls of 18 have until about 25, 30 at the most, {{and then you have}} to report to me. My suits are quality fabric.'" [...] She went on: [...] "I put you in a suit that contains you and you will swim in. I don't want you to be in two Dixie cups and a fish line." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{never did}} give me any--not the {{least in the}} world, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> her myself," [...] said Fred, eager to vindicate Mary. [...] "But <b>when</b> <b>I</b> asked Mr. Farebrother to speak for me, she allowed him to tell me there was a hope." ...|$|R
5000|$|Coming into this, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> Herb and Marion Sandler, {{one of my}} {{concerns}} was precisely this question of independence and nonpartisanship...My history has been doing [...] "down the middle" [...] reporting. And so <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> Herb and Marion I said [...] "Are you comfortable with that?" [...] They said, [...] "Absolutely." [...] I said, [...] "Well, suppose we did an expose {{of some of the}} left leaning organizations that you have supported or that are friendly to what you've supported in the past."They said, [...] "No problem." [...] And when we set up our organizational structure, the board of directors, on which I sit and which Herb is the chairman, does not know in advance what we're going to report on.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, sir, she knowed {{no more of}} a chowder, than if the sea wern't in the neighbourhood, {{and there}} wern't {{such a thing as}} a fish in all England. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> her of a chowder, she gave in, like a Spaniard at the fourth or fifth broadside." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't {{sit on the}} ottoman," [...] {{the young}} lady proceeded. [...] "Bring a chair, Godfrey. I like people to be {{opposite}} to me <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your charming ward," [...] Cecil answered, [...] "has as many whims and fancies as an elf. She yawns <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> her, {{and looks}} longingly {{after one of}} my villagers. Hang the fellow!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I'm not {{a little}} man, I'm Tods, and I know all about it. Ditta Mull, and Choga Lall, and Amir Nath, and--oh, lakhs of my friends {{tell me about it}} in the bazars <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> them.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And I thought you--a prig," [...] she recollected. [...] "No; that's {{not quite}} it. There were the ants who stole the tongue, and I thought you and St. John were like those ants--very big, very ugly, very energetic, {{with all your}} virtues on your backs. However, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> you <b>I</b> liked you--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Jerusalem!" [...] the miner exclaimed. [...] "What on airth {{are they}} doing there? Why, we thought they had gone down {{to the west of}} the Colorado. I told you so, chief, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> you about it; and instead of that, here they are up in the country of the 'Rappahoes and Shoshones." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Such {{a little}} family as we have, and two strong girls," [...] said she,--"everything {{ought to be}} perfect; there is really nothing to do. Think of a whole batch of bread {{absolutely}} sour! and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> gave that away, then this morning another exactly like it! and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> cook about it, {{she said she had}} lived in this and that family, and her bread had always been praised as equal to the baker's!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{never thought}} it would," [...] Richard admitted. [...] "I think <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> her she'll {{understand}} that I care {{more than any of}} the others. If {{you want to know the}} reason, that's why I'm so hopeful." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, really," [...] exclaimed a small Fire-balloon, [...] "why not? It {{is a most}} joyful occasion, {{and when}} I soar {{up into the air}} I intend to tell the stars all about it. You will see them twinkle <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> them about the pretty bride." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{sometimes}} feel that I'm making none. She {{looks at me}} half amused and half astonished when I express my opinions; I have to keep a curb on myself <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> her. In fact, I've once or twice got mad. I can take a joke, but her condescending smile is riling." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, well! Let be how 'twill, {{the brook}} {{was a good}} friend to Jim. I see it now. I allus did wonder what he was gettin' at when he said that, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> him about shiftin' the stack. [...] "You dunno everythin'," [...] he ses. [...] "The Brook's been a good friend to me," [...] he ses, [...] "an' if she's minded to have a snatch at my hay, I ain't settin' out to {{withstand}} her."' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why, {{she knew}} he used {{to get out in}} the morning to bathe, and was persuaded he had been drowned; so I told her I knew he was alive and well, and she would hear all about it when you came back. I brought the {{youngest}} child away with me, and Gertrude has got her up-stairs; the other would not come. Poor thing! Mary says she is very good and patient; and I must say she was wonderfully reasonable <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> her.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And the {{assistance}} {{for which you}} wish?" [...] said father, putting his hand in his pocket. I know what that action means <b>when</b> <b>I</b> am <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> him.|$|R
6000|$|... "We are not small men," [...] Stephen Weiss said slowly. [...] "We {{represent}} a great power, and a power {{for which we}} mean to fight. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you of money, I mean it. We will raise a million dollars for you before midday to-morrow, if you leave that paper in our hands." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You'll {{get over}} that, my lad, and put pep into your motions <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you," [...] Del Mar assured him; {{and the very}} manner of his {{utterance}} was a threat that Michael could not fail to recognise. [...] "Now we'll just see if I can pull off the trick. You listen to me, and sing like you did for that leper guy." ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{explained}} if Lagune dismissed {{her she was}} to go {{into the}} country to an aunt, a sister of Chaffery's who needed a companion. Chaffery insisted upon that. [...] "Companion they call it. I shall be just a servant--she has no servant. My mother cries <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> her. She tells me she doesn't want me to go away from her. But she's afraid of him. 'Why don't you do what he wants?' she says." ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{relation}} <b>to</b> the above, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> one of {{the elders}} in my parish an old man called ‘Ateka’ who received baptism from Ngora, he confessed {{that some of the}} catechumens who could not bear being beaten usually left. He said that some of the missionaries were also very rough. He told me a story of how a certain woman left because she was beaten for insisting on a ‘wrong answer’; when asked [...] "who created you", her answer was that it was her parents, and she never changed her position despite threats.|$|R
6000|$|... "I mean," [...] screamed {{suddenly}} Lieut. Feraud, [...] "to cut {{off your}} ears to teach you to disturb me with the general's orders <b>when</b> <b>I</b> am <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> a lady!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I mean," [...] screamed {{suddenly}} Lieutenant Feraud, [...] "to cut {{off your}} ears to teach you not to disturb me, orders or no orders, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> am <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> a lady." ...|$|R
60|$|Somehow when I'm {{talking to}} a woman like her I realize how little I see of women with whom I can be really chummy, tho I meet so many people at receptions etc. {{sometimes}} just after I have been flying before thousands of people I beat it to my hotel and would be glad for a good chat with the night clerk, of course I can bank on Martin Dockerill to the limit but <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> a person like Miss Nash I realize I need some one who knows good art from bad. Though Miss Nash doesn't insist on talking like a high-brow, indeed is picking up aviation technologies very quickly. She talks German like a native.|$|E
6000|$|... "There you are!" [...] Ricardo {{shrugged his}} {{shoulders}} philosophically. [...] "Can't be helped. Short of shooting our Pedro, nobody can make absolutely sure of his staying {{in the same place}} longer than he has a mind to; but I tell you, he lives in holy terror of my temper. That's why I put on my sudden-death air <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him. And yet I wouldn't shoot him--not I, unless in such a fit of rage as would make a man shoot his favourite dog. Look here, sir! This deal is on the square. I didn't tip him a wink to do anything else. He won't budge from the jetty. Are you coming along now, sir?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I was dere a year, dere und at dere oder islands--somedimes for monkeys und somedimes for {{butterflies}} und orchits.

60|$|After we had dinner, {{which was}} as English as the British lion, and much more to our taste than {{anything}} we had had in London, Jone went out to smoke a pipe, and <b>I</b> had a <b>talk</b> with Miss Pondar about fish, meat, and groceries, and about housekeeping matters in general. Miss Pondar, whose general aspect of minister's wife began <b>to</b> wear off <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> her, mingles respectfulness and respectability in a manner I haven't been {{in the habit of}} seeing. Generally those two things run against each other, but they don't in her.|$|R
6000|$|Gordon {{was silent}} for a moment or two. [...] "Of course, I partly {{expected}} it," [...] he observed. [...] "In fact, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> Miss Waynefleet about you, I ventured to predict something of the kind." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{would depend}} upon how the thing went. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> do <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> her it always seems that nothing I say can be right. Now, {{if you will}} give it her {{you can put in}} all manner of pretty things." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It {{might have}} been as far as {{feelings}} were concerned.... Now, Avice, I'll to the point at once. Virtually I have known your daughter any number of years. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> her I can anticipate every turn of her thought, every sentiment, every act, so long did I study those things in your mother and in you. Therefore I do not require to learn her; she was learnt by me in her previous existences. Now, don't be shocked: I am willing to marry her--I should be overjoyed to do it, {{if there would be}} nothing preposterous about it, or that would seem like a man making himself too much of a fool, and so degrading her in consenting. I can make her comparatively rich, as you know, and I would indulge her every whim. There is the idea, bluntly put. It would set right something in my mind that has been wrong for forty years. After my death she would have plenty of freedom and plenty of means to enjoy it.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Likely? Of course not," [...] Bertram {{went on with}} conviction. [...] "Planetoscopists are {{agreed upon}} it. And above all, why should one suppose the living organisms or their analogues, if any such there are, in the planets or fixed stars, possess any such purely human and animal faculties as thought and reason? That's just like our common human narrowness. If we were oaks, I suppose, we would only {{interest}} ourselves in the question whether acorns existed in Mars and Saturn." [...] He paused a moment; then he added in an afterthought: [...] "No, Frida; you may be sure all human beings, you and I alike, and thousands of others {{a great deal more}} different, are essential products of this one wee planet, and of particular times and circumstances in its history. We differ only as birth and circumstances have made us differ. There IS a mystery about who I am, and where I come from; I won't deny it: but it isn't by any means so strange or so marvellous a mystery as you seem to imagine. One of your own old sacred books says (as I remember hearing in the joss-house I attended one day in London), 'God hath made of one blood all the nations of the earth.' If for GOD in that passage we substitute COMMON DESCENT, it's perfectly true. We are all of one race; and I confess, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you, every day I feel our unity more and more profoundly." [...] He bent over on the bench and took her tremulous hand. [...] "Frida," [...] he said, looking deep into her speaking dark eyes, [...] "don't you yourself feel it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The Headman {{has told}} me your business, and it seems {{it is very much}} the same as <b>when</b> <b>I</b> last <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> you," [...] he said. [...] "You are, I believe, not a friend of those other white men who have persecuted me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I am {{glad that}} you like the arrangement, George. I had it in my mind <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> you two days ago, but until I saw Norton, and {{found that he was}} willing to retire, I did not propose it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not that, not that, Madonna," [...] he wailed, {{his tone}} {{suggesting}} the imminence of tears. [...] "Do not send me away. If die I must, {{let me die}} here at Roccaleone, helping the defence to my last breath. But do not cast me out {{to fall into the}} hands of Gian Maria. He will hang me for my share in this business. Do not requite me thus, Madonna. You owe me a little, surely, and if <b>I</b> was mad <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> you just now, it was love of you that drove me--love of you and suspicion of that man of whom none of us know anything. Madonna, be pitiful a little. Suffer me to remain." ...|$|R
