500|$|Her {{biological}} father's {{love for}} rock music by Led Zeppelin, David Bowie, and Jimi Hendrix also influences her. She has also listed Nine Inch Nails and its frontman, Trent Reznor, Björk, Fiona Apple, Aaliyah, Skinny Puppy, AC/DC, Hole and Oasis as musical influences, citing the albums (What's the Story) Morning Glory? and Live Through This {{as the most}} influential to her current sound. She has also mentioned Janet Jackson as a primary influence, saying [...] "I love everything she does." [...] The first concert she attended was an AC/DC concert with her father. Recalling the experience, she told Revolver, [...] "...I <b>was</b> <b>like,</b> <b>when</b> I grow up, this is what I want to do!" ...|$|E
500|$|Konnan {{was still}} working in Mexico while under {{contract}} to WWF, and was also simultaneously appearing in a Mexican telenovela aimed at children called [...] "El abuelo y yo". As he was becoming more popular in Mexico, he was not as focused on making it in America. Konnan recollected, [...] "Wrestling was so hot in Mexico, because they had lifted this 30-year ban on wrestling on TV in Mexico City. I was able to capitalize on that wrestling boom. I was wrestling three times in one day on many weekends. The amount of work was incredible. It <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>when</b> Raw and Nitro were going head-to-head and there was work for everybody." ...|$|E
500|$|Music critic Simon Reynolds said Curtis's suicide [...] "made {{for instant}} myth". Jon Savage's {{obituary}} said that [...] "now {{no one will}} remember what his work with Joy Division <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>when</b> he was alive; it will be perceived as tragic rather than courageous." [...] In June 1980, the posthumous single [...] "Love Will Tear Us Apart" [...] was released, which hit number thirteen on the UK Singles Chart. In July 1980, Closer was released; subsequently peaking at number six on the UK Albums Chart. NME reviewer Charles Shaar Murray wrote, [...] "Closer is as magnificent a memorial (for 'Joy Division' as much as for Ian Curtis) as any post-Presley popular musician could have." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2009, {{the serial}} {{embarked}} on two lesbian storylines, {{one of which}} involved Nicole. It featured Freya Duric (Sophie Hensser) kissing Nicole, which sparked complaints. However, for Nicole it wasn't about sexuality, rather finding herself the center of attention. James described their dynamic, stating: [...] "Freya's exactly what Nicole <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>when</b> she first arrived in the bay, {{that is why they}} click. Nicole relates to the wild side of Freya, but has no idea how far Freya is going to take it." [...] Through her relationship with Geoff she had mellowed, however her vanity was still present. James said Nicole was [...] "angry" [...] because she was on Freya's [...] "not hot list". Freya kissed her to prove she thinks she is hot, James opined that Nicole did not enjoy the kiss, but was just [...] "happy to be center of attention" [...] and happy that people were talking about her again. The incident eventually brought her to the realisation that she had become boring. Nicole denied it was to do with her involvement with Geoff, however James said Geoff was the reason she became bored.|$|E
500|$|Another pivotal romantic {{relationship}} {{for the character}} occurred when Chloe began dating her best friend Kevin Fisher (Greg Rikaart). The decision to develop the friendship into a romance was debated by the writers, as it was Hendrickson and Rikaart who approached the writers wanting to work together. Due to their real-life friendship, Rikaart said of the storyline turn, [...] "The level of comfort is so easy, certainly for portraying the friendship part of the Kevin/Chloe relationship, that is a no-brainer. [...] So it <b>was</b> <b>like,</b> <b>when</b> {{are we going to}} have to start acting?" [...] The relationship is plagued with constant issues, such as interference from Kevin's mentally unstable ex-wife Jana Hawkes (Emily O'Brien), and mob princess Angelina Veneziano's (Diana DeGarmo) intense crush on Kevin (which leads to a brief marriage, with Angelina's mob father threatening to kill Kevin if he doesn't wed his daughter). Angelina leaves town and Chloe and Kevin finally marry. In 2013, Kevin and Chloe have financial troubles which Kevin thinks can be solved through criminal acts; Hendrickson said, [...] "Money is usually a common issue between couples. They’re kind of battling through this struggle. He’s trying to do his best to take care of the family and morally, it just doesn’t sit well with her. Especially with what he’s been through in the past." [...] Rikaart told On-Air On-Soaps that he and Hendrickson have discussed wanting the characters to break up, [...] "We always say, 'We have done this. We have played this. [...] Now let’s play breaking up.' That will be different." ...|$|E
2500|$|In October 1980, bassist Tommy Shannon {{attended}} a Double Trouble performance at Rockefeller's in Houston. Shannon, who {{was playing with}} Alan Haynes at the time, participated in a jam session with Vaughan and Layton halfway through their set. Shannon later commented: [...] "I went down there that night, and I'll never forget this: it <b>was</b> <b>like,</b> <b>when</b> I {{walked in the door}} and I heard them playing, it was like a revelation—'That's where I want to be; that's where I belong, right there.' During the break, I went up to Stevie and told him that. I didn't try to sneak around and hide it from the bass player —I didn't know if he was listening or not. I just really wanted to be in that band. I sat in that night and it sounded great." [...] Almost three months later, when Vaughan offered Shannon the position, he readily accepted.|$|E

2500|$|Milošević {{denounced the}} {{declaration}} of independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina from Yugoslavia in 1992, and said that [...] "Bosnia and Herzegovina was illegally proclaimed as an independent state and recognized. That recognition <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>when</b> the Roman Emperor Caligula appointed his horse as a Senator: they recognized a state that never existed before. The Serbs there said, 'We want to stay within Yugoslavia. We don't want to be second-class citizens.' And then the conflicts were started by Muslims, no doubt. And the Serbs, in defending themselves, were always better fighters, no doubt. And they achieved results, no doubt. But please, we were insisting on peace. The international community gave premature recognition first of Slovenia and then of Croatia and supported the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina on a totally irregular basis." [...] A telephone conversation between Milošević and Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzić in September 1991 talking about the prospects of war in Bosnia and Herzegovina was tapped by Yugoslav intelligence, which reported the transcript to Yugoslav prime minister Ante Marković, who released the transcript to the public to discredit Milošević. The transcript involved Milošević ordering Karadzic to [...] "Go to Uzelac , he'll tell you everything. If you have any problems, telephone me", and said [...] "As long as there is the army no one can touch us... Don't worry about Herzegovina. Momir [...] said to his men: 'Whoever is not ready to die in Bosnia, step forward five paces.' No one did so." [...] The conversation revealed that Milošević controlled the military strategy for the war in Bosnia and that Montenegro was under his control.|$|E

What we care about in a light is that it shows the way, not whether it is lamp or candle, tallow or wax. Our only real interest in Zadig lies in the conceptions of which he is the putative father; and his biographer has stated these with so much clearness and vivacious illustration, that we need hardly feel a pang, even if critical research should prove King Moabdar {{and all the rest of}} the story to be unhistorical, and reduce Zadig himself to the shadowy condition of a solar myth.|$|E
