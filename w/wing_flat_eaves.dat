50|$|Vinedale is a {{historic}} plantation house located near Pinetops, Edgecombe County, North Carolina. It was built about 1855, and is a two-story, double-pile, three bays wide, Greek Revival / Italianate style frame dwelling. It features a one-story wraparound porch; a hipped roof with wide, overhanging, <b>flat</b> <b>eaves</b> and a cupola; and curved window heads and brackets.|$|R
25|$|A similar portico adorns the rear, {{with its}} {{balustrade}} also topped by urns. On the <b>wings</b> <b>flat</b> pilasters support a frieze, with columns on the semi octagonal south wing creating an arcade.|$|R
50|$|Both sexes {{bask in the}} sun on shrubs {{close to}} the ground. They hold their <b>wings</b> <b>flat</b> against the substratum. The forewing is lowered to cover part of the hindwing and is a typical stance of the common Mormon.|$|R
5000|$|The eastern {{chanting}} goshawk is usually seen alone. [...] It often perches on {{the tops of}} trees and utility poles. [...] Its wingbeats are shallow and [...] "straight-arm". It holds its <b>wings</b> <b>flat,</b> or sometimes in a V, when it glides.|$|R
50|$|Celaenorrhinus is a genus of skipper {{butterflies}} {{which are}} commonly termed sprites. An alternate name is flats, for their habit of holding their <b>wings</b> <b>flat</b> when resting, {{but this is}} also used for related genera. They belong to the spread-winged skipper subfamily (Pyrginae), and therein are the type genus of tribe Celaenorrhini.|$|R
5000|$|Pattern {{of direct}} flight is {{described}} as [...] "sometimes leisurely, rather heavy and crow-like, with sustained flapping". Pursuit is [...] "powerful and energetic with deep, fluid wing beats, like a fast-flying Brown Falcon". It soars with wings raised in a slight dihedral, almost flat; glides with <b>wings</b> <b>flat</b> or slightly bowed; and sometimes stoops with closed wings.|$|R
50|$|Today, {{there are}} many flavors of {{prepared}} <b>wings</b> (<b>flats,</b> drumettes or whole wings) available {{in addition to the}} original hot Buffalo style. Flavors include barbecue, lemon pepper, pepper Parmesan, garlic, sweet-and-sour, honey mustard, Thai chili, Caribbean jerk, Indian butter chicken, honey garlic, habanero, ghost pepper, and peanut-butter and jelly. Restaurants have also introduced hundreds of different flavors of chicken wings.|$|R
5|$|Nearly all {{butterflies}} are diurnal, {{have relatively}} bright colours, and hold their wings vertically above their bodies when at rest, unlike {{the majority of}} moths which fly by night, are often cryptically coloured (well camouflaged), and either hold their <b>wings</b> <b>flat</b> (touching the surface on which the moth is standing) or fold them closely over their bodies. Some day-flying moths, such as the hummingbird hawk-moth, are exceptions to these rules.|$|R
50|$|Like other {{butterflies}} in its subfamily, {{it flies}} quickly and usually {{rests on the}} underside of a leaf with its <b>wings</b> open <b>flat.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{post office}} is a single-story, five-bay steel frame {{building}} with a buff brick exterior. It is square-shaped with a rear <b>wing</b> and <b>flat</b> roof.|$|R
25|$|The brown awl flies {{as low as}} 6 {{feet over}} the bushes or as high as 60 to 75 feet in the canopy. The adults feed at lower levels on flowers of shrubs and small trees, but ascend to higher reaches of the {{vegetation}} to lay eggs or to bask, which it does very occasionally, holding its <b>wings</b> <b>flat</b> with the forewings covering the hindwings thus giving an arrowhead effect. The flight of the butterfly is fast and bounding with an audible wing beat.|$|R

40|$|A {{study has}} been {{conducted}} to explore the use of existing aerodynamic techniques to design a new supersonic cruise wing for an existing fighter wind-tunnel model. In addition to the usual wing design constraints of lift, pitching moment, and minimum drag, a ground rule was imposed that the wing had to fit on the existing fuselage. Experimental wind-tunnel results were obtained for a camber design and a reference <b>flat</b> <b>wing.</b> The <b>flat</b> <b>wing</b> was also fitted with leading-edge flaps which approximate the cruise camber design. The experimental results indicate that significant improvements in supersonic cruise capability {{can be obtained by}} a new wing designed using existing supersonic aerodynamic techniques...|$|R

5000|$|Designed {{by local}} architects William and James Owen, Scolton Manor was {{occupied}} from 1842 by the Higgon family. The house replaced a former building {{owned by the}} same family which had burned down in the mid-eighteenth century. Prominent amongst Pembrokeshire society, three Higgon family members held the position of High Sheriff of Pembrokeshire, including the last resident, Lt Col John Henry Victor Higgon (1902-1987). It is a country house built in a neo-classical style, with unpainted stucco, with a slated, hipped roofs and <b>flat</b> overhanging <b>eaves.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Sukhoi T-60S was {{a planned}} Soviet {{supersonic}} intermediate range bomber that never got past the drawing board. Very little {{information is available}} about technical characteristics of this aircraft, which remains classified by the Sukhoi Design Bureau. It was believed that T-60S would have featured a variable geometry <b>wing,</b> <b>flat</b> lifting fuselage and two engines, equipped with two-dimensional thrust vectoring nozzles. The armament was to include up to six Kh-101 cruise missiles, as well as AS-15 and AS-16 missiles, free-fall nuclear weapons and precision guided conventional munitions. The project was first initiated by Sukhoi in 1984 but was cancelled after the Cold War ended in the early 1990s. The bomber was to have replaced the Tu-22M in the Soviet Air Force.|$|R
50|$|Close to the ground, {{the flight}} of the crimson rose is slow and {{fluttering}} but steady. At greater heights, it flies faster and stronger. It basks with its <b>wings</b> spread <b>flat,</b> sometimes in small congregations at heights of 10 to 15 metres up in the trees.|$|R
50|$|The madrasa is {{flanked by}} the {{reservoir}} in the northern front and by a garden on its southern side at the second floor level. The entry to the garden is from the eastern gate which paases through the Hauz Khas village. The garden houses six impressive pavilions. The pavilions with domes are in different shapes and sizes (rectangular, octagonal and hexagonal) and {{on the basis of}} inscriptions are inferred to be graves. A cluster of three hemispherical domes, a large one of 5.5 m diameter and two smaller ones of 4.5 m diameter, portray exquisite architectural features of foliated motifs on the drums with kalasa motifs on top of the domes. Each pavilion is raised on a plinth of about 0.8 m and is supported by square shaped wide columns with entablature which have decorative capitals that support beams with projecting canopies. Ruins of a courtyard with a rectangular plan, are seen {{to the west of the}} three pavilions which are built of double columns. The pavilions and the courtyard are conjectured to have been used as part of the madrasa in the past. Another striking structure in the garden, opposite to the Feruz Shah’s tomb on the southern side, is a small eight pillared Chatri seen in the garden which has large cantilevered beams that supported <b>flat</b> <b>eaves</b> all round the small dome.|$|R
50|$|Eupithecia species {{form the}} bulk of the group {{commonly}} known as pugs. They are generally small with muted colours and specific identification can be difficult.

50|$|A news reel of Star TV {{interview}} with ACP Aftab Ahmed Khan shows {{parts of the}} shootout as captured in 1991. According to the former Additional Commissioner of Police Aftab Ahmed Khan, the ATS received a tip-off from a police informer that Maya Dolas and his gang were hiding in the A <b>wing,</b> <b>flats</b> 002 and 003 in the Swati building at the Lokhandwala Complex, a posh upper middle class residential area. The informer {{reported that they were}} armed and were waiting for a few builders who would be coming in the evening. The apartment in which they were hiding belonged to Gopal Rajwani, a fugitive gangster from Ulhasnagar and associate of Dawood Ibrahim. The ATS formed three teams for the task of arresting the fugitives and taking them into custody. One was for reconnaissance, while the other two cordoned off the spot.|$|R
50|$|Gill's aesthetically best work, {{much of it}} {{dating from}} the 1910s, favors <b>flat</b> roofs without <b>eaves,</b> a unity of {{materials}} (mostly concrete), casement windows with transoms, white or near-white exterior and interior walls, cubic or rectangular massing, plentiful ground-level arches or series of arches creating transitional breezeways {{in the manner of}} the California missions.|$|R
25|$|The {{upper and}} lower wings were of equal span and chord; on the first {{aircraft}} (named Shrimp) the lower wing had a slight dihedral, while the upper <b>wing</b> was <b>flat.</b> On the two later aircraft, both wings had equal dihedral. All three were fitted with folding wings (which Shorts had developed and patented in the years 1913 -1915).|$|R
5000|$|This {{species is}} between 0.5 and 0.75 inches long. It is dark brown to black in color with a lighter margin along the abdomen. The <b>wings</b> lie <b>flat</b> across the back. The [...] "beak" [...] has three {{segments}} and curls beneath the head. The nymph {{is similar in}} appearance but it is smaller and lacks wings.|$|R
25|$|The Nymphalidae are {{the largest}} family of {{butterflies}} with about 6,000 species distributed {{throughout most of the}} world, belonging to the superfamily Papilionoidea. These are usually medium-sized to large butterflies. Most species have a reduced pair of forelegs and many hold their colourful <b>wings</b> <b>flat</b> when resting. They are also called brush-footed butterflies or four-footed butterflies, because they are known to stand on only four legs while the other two are curled up; in some species, these forelegs have a brush-like set of hairs, which gives this family its other common name. Many species are brightly coloured and include popular species such as the emperors, monarch butterfly, admirals, tortoiseshells, and fritillaries. However, the under wings are, in contrast, often dull and in some species look remarkably like dead leaves, or are much paler, producing a cryptic effect that helps the butterflies blend into their surroundings.|$|R
5000|$|Both {{male and}} female common flatwings look similar, with a long and slender body about 43 mm in length, and a bright metallic-blue colour. They usually rest with their <b>wings</b> <b>flat</b> open, but females {{sometimes}} rest with wings folded up. Their antennae are very small, and their compound eyes are comparatively large. Common flatwings do not use their legs for walking, but for capturing other flying insects in the air, like all other dragonflies and damselflies. They can be found along streams and creeks, are seldom found near still water ponds, but {{are more likely to}} be found near slow running water. This species likes to rest within a few metres of a creek or stream, in a shaded area, sometimes resting in large groups among plants. They perch on leaves and, when disturbed, fly a short distance. Common flatwings tolerate people close to them.|$|R
5000|$|In {{many cases}} {{claddings}} {{were not used}} within their specifications or not installed correctly. Many buildings built in the [...] "Mediterranean" [...] style used these types of cladding and had features such as recessed windows, <b>flat</b> roofs, minimal <b>eaves,</b> multiple stories, complex roofs, solid balustrades, balconies and penetrations of the exterior cladding that increased the likelihood of water infiltrating the structure.|$|R
2500|$|Moths usually {{rest with}} their wings spread {{out to their}} sides. Butterflies {{frequently}} fold their wings above their backs when they are perched although they will occasionally [...] "bask" [...] with their wings spread for short periods. However, some butterflies, like the skippers, may hold their <b>wings</b> either <b>flat,</b> or folded, or even in-between (the so-called [...] "jet plane" [...] position) when perched.|$|R
