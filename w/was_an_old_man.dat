5|$|Despite this, {{or perhaps}} because of it, Louis XVIII forced Gazan into {{retirement}} in Grasse, where the aging general dabbled unsuccessfully in politics. After the 1830 revolution, the new King of the French Louis Philippe made Gazan a peer of France, and he received a command of a military division in Marseille. By this time, he <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> <b>man,</b> and in poor health, and he retired in June 1832. Gazan de la Peyriére died in Grasse on 9 April 1845.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 940s Constantine <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> <b>man,</b> {{perhaps more than}} 70 years of age. The kingdom of Alba was too new to {{be said to have}} a {{customary}} rule of succession, but Pictish and Irish precedents favoured an adult successor descended from Kenneth MacAlpin. Constantine's surviving son Indulf, probably baptised in 927, would have been too young to be a serious candidate for the kingship in the early 940s, and the obvious heir was Constantine's nephew, MalcolmI. As Malcolm was born no later than 901, by the 940s he was no longer a young man, and may have been impatient. Willingly or not—the 11th-century Prophecy of Berchán, a verse history {{in the form of a}} supposed prophecy, states that it was not a voluntary decision—Constantine abdicated in 943 and entered a monastery, leaving the kingdom to Malcolm.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Lobengula {{moved to}} the north-east, now well out of the Company's reach for the {{foreseeable}} future. However, his sickness, {{which turned out to}} be smallpox, sharply intensified and eventually killed him on 22 or 23 January 1894. With the king dead, Mjaan, the most senior of the izinDuna, took command of the Matabele. Mjaan <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> <b>man,</b> and his only son had been killed in the war. He wished to make peace. In late February 1894, he convened an indaba at which he and his contemporaries met with James Dawson, a trader known to them for many years, who offered the olive branch on behalf of the Company. The izinDuna unanimously accepted. They also told the trader what had happened to the Shangani Patrol, and led him to the battle site to survey it, as well as to examine and identify the largely skeletonised bodies of the soldiers, which still lay where they had fallen. Dawson was the first non-Matabele to learn of the last stand.|$|E

All that is known of him is told in the Gesta regum Anglorum (Deeds of the English Kings), written by the eminent medieval {{historian}} William of Malmesbury in about 1125.

25|$|The Skjöldunga saga tells that Sigurd Ring {{was married}} to Alfhild, the {{daughter}} of king Alf of Alfheim, and their son was Ragnar Lodbrok. Unfortunately, Alfhild died. When Sigurd Ring <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> <b>man,</b> he came to Skiringssal {{to take part in}} the great blóts. There he spotted a very beautiful girl named Alfsol, and she was the daughter of King Alf of Vendel (Vendel). The girl's two brothers refused to allow Sigurd to marry her. Sigurd fought with the brothers and killed them, but their sister had been given poison by her brothers so that Sigurd could never have her. When her corpse was carried to Sigurd, he went aboard a large ship where he placed Alvsol and her brothers. Then, he steered the ship with full sails out on the sea, as the ship burnt.|$|E
25|$|In the {{afternoon}} of Wednesday, May 5, 1886, strikers again assembled to march on the company town of Bay View. This time, new orders had been issued {{to the members of}} the National Guard by Governor Rusk — that, in the event of the repeat of mob tactics, the guardsmen should this time shoot to kill. Guardsmen blocked the road. When the approaching strikers were 1000 yards away, commanding officer Major George P. Traeumer gave the command to fire and a hail of bullets was unleashed on the crowd. The number wounded will never be known, having been carried away by the fleeing crowd, but eight people died in what is today remembered as the Bay View Massacre.

[...] In 1815, he judged Michel Ney's trial for treason, but refused to reach a verdict. He dabbled briefly, and unsuccessfully, in politics in the 1820s.

[...] Despite initially being open to negotiations with the French, pressure from pro-war chiefs and the fear of ridicule from his tribesmen had dissuaded him. [...] Amhaouch was a strong and influential man, described by French officer and explorer René de Segonzac as one of the [...] "great spiritual leaders of Morocco" [...] and the [...] "most powerful religious personality of the south east". [...] The French had attempted to persuade the Zaians to submit since 1913 with little success; most tribes in the confederation remained opposed to French rule.|$|E

[...] Robert Crumb's cartooning style has drawn {{on the work of}} cartoon artists from earlier generations, including Billy DeBeck (Barney Google), C. E. Brock (an old story book illustrator), Gene Ahern's comic strips, George Baker (Sad Sack), Ub Iwerks's characters for animation, Isadore Freleng's drawings for the early Merrie Melodies and Looney Tunes of the 1930s, Sidney Smith (The Gumps), Rube Goldberg, E. C. Segar (Popeye) and Bud Fisher (Mutt and Jeff).

[...] Another of the dead females was so riddled with bullets that {{there appeared to be}} no unwounded part of her person left." [...] Crook ordered the remaining bodies removed from the cave. [...] "Several soldiers jumped at once into the ravine and bore out the corpses of the warrior killed by Pourier and three dead squaws." [...] "The old Indian Big Bat Pourier had killed was unceremoniously hauled up by what hair remained and a leather belt around the middle.

By now, Georgescu <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> <b>man.</b> Although he had a productive and successful academic career behind him, he was disappointed that his work had not received the dissemination and recognition he had expected for {{it in his own}} lifetime. He believed he had long been running against a current. As he likened himself to one unlucky heretic and legendary martyr of science out of the Italian Renaissance, Georgescu grumbled and exclaimed: [...] "E pur si muove is ordinarily attributed to Galileo, although those words were the last ones uttered by Giordano Bruno on the burning stake!" [...] He came to realise that he had failed in his life's work to warn the general public and change people's minds about the looming mineral resource exhaustion he himself was very concerned about. He finally grasped that philosophical pessimism may well be a stance favoured by a few solitary intellectuals like himself, but such a stance is normally shunned like a taboo in the wider human culture: [...] " [...] considered pessimist is looked upon as a bearer of bad news and ... is not welcomed ever... he lamented. Yet, in spite of his deep disappointment and frustration, he continued to write down and propagate his views {{as long as he was}} physically able to do so.|$|E
2500|$|Scaffolders Spratt and Griggs {{were working}} on the morning of Saturday 13 May 1905, and stopped for a tea break.

The clock-winder Alfred Smith <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> <b>man,</b> having started this job before 1847. He stopped the clock at 9.45 am and removed the other clock weight. He told the inquest that the hemp ropes were due for replacement and that he had unsuccessfully requested new ropes from the Council, on three occasions during the previous two months. There was a big local funeral on Tuesday 6 May, and the Council started a fund for the relief of the widow. Alfred Smith retired around 1907.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the first}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), Judah {{approached}} Joseph, whom he likened to Pharaoh, and recounted how Joseph {{had asked the}} 10 brothers whether they had a father or brother, and they {{had told him that}} they had a father who <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> (Jacob), and a child of his old age who was a little one (Benjamin), whose brother was dead, who alone was left of his mother (Rachel), and whose father loved him.

Judah recalled how the brothers had told their father Joseph's words, and when their father had told them to go again to buy a little food, they had reminded him that they could not go down without their youngest brother. Judah recounted how their father had told them that his wife had born him two sons, one had gone out and was torn in pieces, and if they took the youngest and harm befell him, it would bring down his gray hairs with sorrow to the grave. Judah began to explain to Joseph what would happen if Judah were to come to his father without the lad, seeing that his father's soul was bound up with the lad's.
