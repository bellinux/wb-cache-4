500|$|Practical - Full {{contact system}} where {{the core of}} the combat is {{completely}} dependent on <b>what</b> <b>your</b> character can do, not <b>what</b> <b>your</b> character has the stats to do. These types of LARPs exist with boffer weapons, but they are more commonly seen with real weapons and armor. This system follows variations of the Limb Loss System with the primary difference being realism. In some practical LARPs actions such as kicking another player's shield is authorize, as seen in the LARP Dagohir. Practical systems that involve real weapons and armor put emphasis on realism, specifically historic realism which is what the [...] strives to achieve. The SCA is techinally an educational group and not a LARP, however, they are the most widely known group that utilizes the Practical system of combat. On the RP side of things, Practical LARPs differ from Limb Loss LARPs because of the interaction that takes place between combat. Generally, but not always, Practical LARPs do not role play in between fights and if they do, they usually take on the role of a historical figure rather than a created character.|$|E
