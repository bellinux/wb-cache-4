5|$|Penicillin {{has been}} {{suggested}} as the drug of choice {{for the treatment of}} S.iniae infection in mammals, including humans. In the 1995–1996 cluster of human cases, all clinical s were susceptible to penicillin, several cephalosporins, clindamycin, erythromycin, and co-trimoxazole (MICs 0.25µg/ml); all nine patients <b>were</b> <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> parenteral beta-lactam antibiotics and recovered uneventfully. A study of isolates submitted to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention between 2000 and 2004 found all to be sensitive to beta-lactams, macrolides, quinolones, and vancomycin.|$|E
5|$|Hospital {{assessment}} is recommended if simple pain relief does not resolve local pain, or systemic symptoms occur. Opioid analgesics {{may be necessary}} to relieve pain. Antivenom has been historically given for adults suffering severe local pain or systemic symptoms consistent with latrodectism, which include pain and swelling spreading proximally from site, distressing local or systemic pain, chest pain, abdominal pain, or excessive sweating (diaphoresis). A significant proportion of bites will not result in envenomation or any symptoms developing; around 2–20% of bite victims have been treated with antivenom. In an Australian study of 750 emergency hospital admissions for spider bites where the spider was definitively identified, 56 were from redbacks. Of these, 37 had significant pain lasting over 24 hours. Only six <b>were</b> <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> the antivenom.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to Nazi concentration camps, the Soviet gulags (labour camps) {{led to the}} death of citizens of occupied countries such as Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia, as well as German prisoners of war (POWs) and even Soviet citizens who had been or were thought to be supporters of the Nazis. Sixty per cent of Soviet POWs of the Germans died during the war. Richard Overy gives the number of 5.7 million Soviet POWs. Of those, 57 per cent died or were killed, a total of 3.6million. Soviet ex-POWs and repatriated civilians <b>were</b> <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> great suspicion as potential Nazi collaborators, and some of them were sent to the Gulag upon being checked by the NKVD.|$|E
5|$|Mason's {{successor}} Horner {{proved to}} be extremely unpopular as governor and his tenure was very short. Residents disliked him so much they burned him in effigy and pelted him with vegetables upon his entry into the territorial capital. In the October 1835 elections, voters approved the draft constitution and elected the popular Mason as state governor. The same election saw Isaac E. Crary chosen as Michigan's first U.S. Representative to Congress. Because of the dispute Congress refused to accept his credentials and seated him as a non-voting delegate. The two U.S. Senators chosen by the state legislature in November, Lucius Lyon and John Norvell, <b>were</b> <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> even less respect, being allowed to sit only as spectators in the Senate gallery.|$|E
5|$|Research on the {{treatment}} of mercury poisoning is limited. Currently available drugs for acute mercurial poisoning include chelators N-acetyl-D, L-penicillamine (NAP), British Anti-Lewisite (BAL), 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanesulfonic acid (DMPS), and dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA). In one small study including 11 construction workers exposed to elemental mercury, patients <b>were</b> <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> DMSA and NAP. Chelation therapy with both drugs resulted in the mobilization of {{a small fraction of}} the total estimated body mercury. DMSA was able to increase the excretion of mercury to a greater extent than NAP.|$|E

5|$|The landed {{aristocracy}} of Spanish descent {{considered the}} illiterate, mixed-race gauchos, who comprised {{the majority of}} the population, to be ungovernable and untrustworthy. The gauchos were tolerated because there was no other labor force available, but <b>were</b> <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> contempt by the landowners. Rosas got along well with the gauchos in his service, despite his harsh and authoritarian comportment. He was known to dress like them, joke with them, take part in their horse-play, and pay them well, but he never allowed them to forget that he was their master rather than their equal. Shaped by the colonial society in which he lived, Rosas was conservative, an advocate of hierarchy and authority, like the other great landowners in the region.|$|E
5|$|The {{only major}} battle {{that took place}} between Japan and Germany was the siege of the German-controlled Chinese port of Tsingtao in Kiautschou Bay. The German forces held out from August until November 1914, under a total Japanese/British blockade, {{sustained}} artillery barrages and manpower odds of 6:1 – a fact that gave a morale boost during the siege as well as later in defeat. After Japanese troops stormed the city, the German dead were buried at Tsingtao and the remaining troops were transported to Japan where they <b>were</b> <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> respect at places like the Bandō Prisoner of War camp. In 1919, when the German Empire formally signed the Treaty of Versailles, all prisoners of war were set free and returned to Europe.|$|E
5|$|The rising {{forced a}} change of policy by the regime, which instead of {{attempting}} to replace the landholding classes now looked for a reconciliation with former Royalists and Engagers. This resulted in the Act of Grace and Pardon, proclaimed in Edinburgh on 5 May 1654. Instead of a blanket forfeiture among those implicated in resistance, it named 24 persons (mainly from the nobility) whose lands would be seized, and 73 other landholders who could retain their estates after paying a fine. Even then most of those names <b>were</b> <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> leniency and fines were remitted for confiscations, or were reduced, and some were abandoned.|$|E
50|$|Cold {{agglutinin}} disease <b>is</b> <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> {{avoidance of}} cold exposure.

50|$|Victor Meyer {{suggested}} {{the idea of}} determining the types of alcohol i.e. (primary, secondary or tertiary). In this method the sample alcohol <b>is</b> <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> PI3 to get the iodoalkane which <b>is</b> again <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> AgNO2 to get the nitroalkane. The nitroalkane <b>is</b> then <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> nitrous acid which is obtained by NaNO2 and HCl. The resulting solution <b>is</b> <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> KOH and the colour is observed. The red, blue and no colour indicates the primary, secondary and tertiary alcohol respectively.|$|R
5|$|This {{was not an}} {{encouraging}} start for the operation but despite this, the LCS decided {{to continue with the}} deception. Colonel Thornton's trip was approved and he travelled to Stockholm toward the end of April. Thornton spent two weeks in Sweden, meeting {{with the head of the}} Royal Swedish Air Force, General Bengt Nordenskiöld. The conferences <b>were</b> <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> a high degree of secrecy in the hope this would emphasise their importance. It had the required effect; Thornton's conversations were recorded by a pro-German chief of police and forwarded to Germany. Despite siding with the Allies, Nordenskiöld communicated very little sensitive information to Thornton. Nordenskiöld was convinced that the Allies intended to invade Norway, but he kept this conviction to himself, contrary to Allied hopes. Thornton returned to England on 30 April.|$|E

Early-stage aggressive disease <b>is</b> <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> chemotherapy and often radiation, with a 70-90% cure rate. [...] Late-stage indolent lymphomas are sometimes left untreated and monitored until they progress. Late-stage aggressive disease <b>is</b> <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> chemotherapy, with cure rates of over 70%.|$|R
50|$|Once an {{infection}} has been diagnosed and identified, suitable treatment options must be {{assessed by the}} physician and consulting medical microbiologists. Some infections {{can be dealt with}} by the body's own immune system, but more serious infections <b>are</b> <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> antimicrobial drugs. Bacterial infections <b>are</b> <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> antibacterials (often called antibiotics) whereas fungal and viral infections <b>are</b> <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> antifungals and antivirals respectively. A broad class of drugs known as antiparasitics <b>are</b> used to <b>treat</b> parasitic diseases.|$|R
50|$|Small lesions can <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> light electrocautery.
