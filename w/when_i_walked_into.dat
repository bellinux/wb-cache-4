And then, you {{looked up at me}} so coldly, and you thanked me for finding your ring in such an indifferent manner, that my knees trembled under me, and I felt as if I should drop on the floor at your feet. When you had thanked me, you looked back, if you remember, at your writing. I was so mortified at being treated in this way, that I plucked up spirit enough to speak. I said, 'This is a strange thing about the Diamond, sir.' And you looked up again, and said, 'Yes, it is!' You spoke civilly (I can't deny that); but still you kept a distance--a cruel distance between us. Believing, as I did, that you had got the lost Diamond hidden about you, while you were speaking, your coolness so provoked me that I got bold enough, {{in the heat of the}} moment, to give you a hint. I said, 'They will never find the Diamond, sir, will they? No! nor the person who took it--I'll answer for that.' I nodded, and smiled at you, as much as to say, 'I know!' THIS time, you looked up at me with something like interest in your eyes; and I felt that a few more words on your side and mine might bring out the truth. Just at that moment, Mr. Betteredge spoilt it all by coming to the door. I knew his footstep, and I also knew that it was against his rules for me to be in the library at that time of day--let alone being there along with you. I had only just time to get out of my own accord, before he could come in and tell me to go. I was angry and disappointed; but I was not entirely without hope for all that. The ice, you see, was broken between us--and I thought I would take care, on the next occasion, that Mr. Betteredge was out of the way.|$|E
50|$|In a November 6, 2010, interview, McMahon {{admitted}} to having memory problems due to injuries suffered on the football field. McMahon was quoted as saying, 'There {{are a lot of}} times <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>walk</b> <b>into</b> a room and forget why <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> in there.' McMahon, along with six other retired professional football players, filed a class action lawsuit against the NFL in August 2011, citing the league's negligence and misconduct in its handling of concussion-related injuries; the suit followed lawsuits filed shortly before by 75 other NFL retirees making similar claims as well as asserting that the NFL knew about the dangers concussions posed to NFL athletes {{as far back as the}} 1920s and actively withheld the information from the affected and the general public until the summer of 2010. The August suit that McMahon joined seeks to expand the scope of the suit to potentially all NFL players who suffered game-related concussions or head injuries.|$|R

I should have walked off the film. This was a movie about shylocks and gangsta rappers and if you can’t make that world edgy, you probably shouldn’t do it.

30|$|According to Friston, the {{predictive}} coding paradigm aims to minimize entropy (e.g., uncertainty) {{in the system}} via statistically aggregated, Bayesian inference models. It is no surprise, then, that concrete knowledge is modeled with greater efficiency than abstract knowledge given its relative stability across contexts. In other words, although concrete object concepts such as door can take on many forms, the functionality and central features of a door (e.g., opens and closes, serves to divide two adjacent areas when closed and connect them when open) are consistent. On the other hand, abstract concepts such as justice are both context dependent (e.g., one may be considered just or unjust when stealing, depending on the circumstances) and relational (multiple agents are required for an act of justice to take place). Thus, the features correlated with a circumstance in which one might encounter an example of justice are not as stable across contexts as those correlated with door—I know that <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>walk</b> <b>into</b> a new building that I am extremely likely to find a door and I will certainly {{know how to use}} it, but whether or not I experience justice and how the concept will play out in a given context is radically different from one situation to the next, depending on both subjective judgment (e.g., how unjust is it for a sick individual to avoid paying a medical bill she cannot afford to pay?) and cultural norms (see Borghi & Cimatti, 2009, Boroditsky, 2011). Thus, abstract concepts, compared to concrete-object concepts, cannot be easily captured by a predictive model due to the amount of error inherent in such a model. As a result, a larger computational burden is likely placed on hierarchical cortico-cortical networks while processing abstract concepts, as top-down and bottom-up circuits work to interpret contextual variability.|$|R
5000|$|Over {{the course}} of moving from studio to studio, the script was heavily rewritten. Sandler later said if the film had been made at Warner Bros, [...] "they would have stuck to" [...] the {{original}} conceptionWarner Brothers was a much more adventurous studio at the time. They were making The Devils and A Clockwork Orange, Performance…they stuck with those kinds of movies.... MGM wanted to sell Raquel Welch in a tight roller derby jersey, running around the track. Listen, they weren’t stupid, they were smart to do that. It certainly made {{them a lot of}} money, {{and it would have been}} a much riskier project to go the other way. They weren’t sure whether Raquel could pull it off. I think she could have, but they wanted to play it much safer and go with a much more straight-on roller derby story. So, the film was made like that, and I think it’s pretty good, but it’s a different kind of movie than the version I envisioned.Raquel Welch discussed her character in detail to the press:The motivation of the character I play is simply to make a buck in life and to attain a sense of identity. There's a futility in what she does. The shape of the track is her life, round and round, going nowhere. But the pros, the real skaters who worked with me, they were terrific. Most of them suffer from the same image I do. They're on skates, they're padded up, they're on a raised track. Most people tend to think of these girls as Amazons. But most of them are even smaller than me. They're not as muscular or as butch as you'd expect. I have a similar problem. Most people are disappointed if the door hinges don't shatter off <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>walk</b> <b>into</b> a room."It's all set up, as everyone knows," [...] said Welch of skating. [...] "It's too bad it couldn't be a more legitimate sport. The skaters have great athletic ability. I'm not much of an athlete... For the film I had to learn to skate again.

He was whining that it was out of tune, but I asked him to let me try something. I added two tracks of harpsichord, told the movers they could remove it, walked into Jerry's office and asked if I could borrow the electric bass that was sitting on his couch, played that on just the second verse and the outro, and that was that! Radio compression worked in our favor on that record. It made the harpsichord blend with the two guitars in an unusual way. But we thought this record would only be an album cut." ...|$|E

5000|$|In February 2014, Chi Onwurah, MP for Newcastle upon Tyne Central, {{mentioned}} the Let Toys Be Toys campaign in a parliamentary debate {{she had called}} on gender-specific toy marketing.

Regardless of where I was or {{the size of the}} company, it was always a predominantly male, or indeed all-male, environment, but it is only <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>walk</b> <b>into</b> a toy shop that I feel I am really experiencing gender segregation. At some point over the past three decades, the toy industry decided that parents and children could not be trusted {{to figure out what to}} buy without colour-coded gender labelling—that means Science museum toys being labelled “for boys”, whereas miniature dustpans and brushes are “Girl Stuff”, according to SportsDirect.I say over the past three decades, because there was a time when toys were toys and blue and pink were just colours. An Argos catalogue page from 1976 shows toy houses, prams and so on all in different colours. Now they only sell them in pink. Recently, a Lego advert from 1981 went viral on the internet because it showed a girl proudly clasping her latest Lego creation. None of the text was gender-specific and the girl was actually wearing blue.What happened? Did someone dye the Y chromosome blue in the ’80s or force the X chromosome to secrete only pink hormones? No. This aggressive gender segregation is a consequence of big-company marketing tactics. Every successful marketeer knows that differentiation makes for greater profit margins and segmentation gives a bigger overall market, so with three-year-old girls only being able to “choose” pink tricycles, the manufacturer can charge more for that special girly shade of pink and the premium princess saddle. Of course, that trike cannot be handed over to a brother or nephew, ensuring further sales of blue bikes with Action Man handlebars. It has got to the point where it is difficult to buy toys for girls that are not pink, princess-primed and/or fairy-infused.”Onwurah later told Kira Cochrane, a reporter for UK Newspaper The Guardian, that she believes the limiting of children by gender stereotypes is a serious economic issue, with the proportion of female students on engineering degree courses having fallen from 12% to 8% in the thirty years since she had started studying for one herself. She said: [...] "We have some big economic problems, and one is a huge skills shortage in engineering and technology. There are thousands of jobs going unfilled, and in addition a lot of our engineers are in their 50s and retiring in the next five years. At the same time we have the lowest proportion in Europe of women who are professional engineers. … Toys are so important and formative, and for me this is about the jobs of the future, about what happens in 10 or 15 years' time. We can't go on with a segregated society." ...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{tort reform}} debates have been {{hindered}} {{by a lack}} of knowledge of how jurors assess damages. Two studies investigated whether jurors are able to appropriately compartmentalize compensatory and punitive damages. In Study 1, mock jurors read a trial summary and were asked to assess compensatory and punitive damages in one of three conditions: (a) compensatory damages only, (b) punitive damages for the plaintiff, or (c) punitive damages for the state treasury. Results suggest that jurors who did not have the option to award punitive damages inflated compensatory damages via pain and suffering awards. Jurors were marginally more likely to award punitive damages when the plaintiff was the recipient. Mock jurors in Study 2 read a similar case summary and were asked to assess compensatory and punitive damages. Two factors were varied in Study 2 : (a) egregiousness of the defendant's conduct, and (b) the recipient of any punitive damages (the plaintiff vs. a consortium of state funds). Jurors were more likely to award punitive damages when the defendant's conduct was more egregious and when the plaintiff was the recipient. The results suggest leakage between compensatory and punitive damage judgments, contrary to the law's mandate. "In 1967, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> first <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> a classroom, the only word associated with tort reform was 'arcane,' " reports one tort reform lobbyist, "[n]ow cab drivers know about the McDonald's case.
