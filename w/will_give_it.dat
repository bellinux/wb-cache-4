5|$|A {{significant}} portion of the game is spent sailing between islands on Link's boat, the King of Red Lions. The boat's sail is driven by wind that blows across the game world in one of eight directions; a tailwind behind the boat <b>will</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> top speed, while sailing against the wind is difficult. The Great Sea features different enemies and obstacles than appear on land. Some items serve new purposes on the King of Red Lions; for instance, the grappling hook serves as a crane for recovering sunken treasure. Link explores the sea {{with the help of a}} sea chart, which can be updated with information on each square and island. Through the game, Link acquires additional charts pointing the way to treasure chests and significant locations. On land, dungeons feature similar maps.|$|E

Azal says on his third appearance, he will decide if Earth deserves to continue existing. If so, he <b>will</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> to the Master. Azal then vanishes in another heat wave.|$|E

India is helping develop the Chabahar Port, which <b>will</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> access to {{the oil and gas}} resources in Iran and the Central Asian states. By so doing, India hopes to compete with the Chinese, who are building Gwadar Port, in Pakistani Baluchistan. Iran plans to use Chabahar for transshipment to Afghanistan and Central Asia, while keeping the port of Bandar Abbas as a major hub mainly for trade with Russia and Europe. India, Iran and Afghanistan have signed an agreement to give Indian goods, heading for Central Asia and Afghanistan, preferential treatment and tariff reductions at Chabahar.|$|E

Sir Ethais is outraged at being called a coward, and wants to challenge Sir Phyllon if he ever recovers. Darine {{tells him that}} she has the cure, but she <b>will</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> to him only if he promises to love her. Sir Ethais agrees, and observing that one beautiful woman is as good as another, gives Selene's ring to Darine. He takes the potion, and is cured. Sir Phyllon enters, and Sir Ethais accosts him. Their argument escalates, and Sir Ethais turns to Darine to confirm that Sir Phyllon had accused him of cowardice. Darine admits that this was only an artifice. Sir Ethais asks Sir Phyllon's forgiveness and renounces Darine. She implores him to reconsider.|$|E

Thus, the position uncertainty [...] can be made arbitrarily small by reducing the wavelength λ. Even if {{the momentum of the}} electron is initially known, the light impinging on the electron <b>will</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> a momentum [...] "kick" [...] of some unknown amount, rendering the momentum of the electron uncertain. If light were not quantized into photons, the uncertainty [...] could be made arbitrarily small by reducing the light's intensity. In that case, since the wavelength and intensity of light can be varied independently, one could simultaneously determine the position and momentum to arbitrarily high accuracy, violating the uncertainty principle. By contrast, Einstein's formula for photon momentum preserves the uncertainty principle; since the photon is scattered anywhere within {{the aperture}}, the uncertainty of momentum transferred equals ...|$|E

500|$|When {{the ground}} was finally cleared Gregory insisted, {{according}} to Harris, that Coulthard be replaced. When Harris would not agree, Gregory said, [...] "Then the game is at an end". Harris asked Barton whether he could claim the match on a forfeit. Barton replied [...] "I <b>will</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> to you in two minutes if the batsmen don't return". Harris then asked Barton to speak with Gregory to ascertain his intentions. When Barton came out he announced that Alick Bannerman and Nat Thomson would resume the NSW innings. They walked onto the arena and reached the stumps, but before they could receive a ball, the crowd again invaded the pitch, and remained there until the scheduled end of play. According to The Sydney Mail approximately 90 minutes' play had been lost. Lord Harris maintained {{his position on the}} ground, standing [...] "erect" [...] with [...] "moustache bristling" [...] among the spectators, fearful that his leaving the arena would lead to a forfeit.|$|E
500|$|The {{prescribed}} readings for New Years Day, {{which also}} celebrated {{the naming of}} Jesus eight days after his birth, were from the Epistle to the Galatians, [...] "by faith we inherit" [...] (...) , and from the Gospel of Luke, the Circumcision and naming of Jesus (...) [...] The text was written by Picander and published in 1728 {{in a collection of}} texts for all occasions of the liturgical year. Picander included for the first movement a verse from Psalm 48 ( [...] in the King James version, otherwise verse 11). He used as the closing chorale the second stanza from Johannes Hermann's hymn [...] "". Picander's poetry is focused on the name of Jesus, similarly to Bach's later cantata for the same occasion, Part IV of his Christmas Oratorio. The biblical quotation from the Old Testament already mentions the name of God. The first recitative adds the thought that the name of Jesus is a gift for the New Year. The second aria contemplates that the name of Jesus, being the first word in the new year, should also be the last in the hour of death. [...] The last recitative refers to , of Jesus saying: [...] "Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he <b>will</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> you." [...] The final movement combines prayers and hopes for the new year.|$|E
