O master, master, You {{will not}} let the mob, when I lie dead, Make me a show--paw over all my limbs-- Pull out my hair--pluck off my finger-nails-- <b>Wear</b> <b>scraps</b> of me for charms and amulets, As if I were a mummy, or a drug? As they have done to others--I have seen it-- Nor set me up in ugly naked {{pictures}} In every church, that cold world-hardened wits May gossip o'er my secret tortures? Promise-- Swear to me! I demand it! ...|$|R
50|$|Gun money, Irish late 17th-century {{emergency}} coins, contain gunmetal, as <b>worn</b> and <b>scrapped</b> {{guns were}} used to make them; but also many other metals, in particular brass and bronze, as people donated pots and pans and other metal objects.|$|R
5000|$|By <b>wearing</b> <b>scraps</b> of {{the steel}} that killed Smothers, John Claborn argues that the workers [...] "give the steel a ritual value that escapes the logic of {{exchange}} value; these scraps open up a space for resistance, insofar as they signify the workers' communal bonding. [...] " [...] With this act, Attaway may signify a [...] "shift in the workers' consciousness," [...] as [...] "the narration itself seems to gain a heightened awareness {{of the connection between}} steel and the ground. [...] " [...] In addition, Claborn feels that [...] "Smothers is ritually sacrificed for the sake of more direct commentary on steel production as a globally interdependent process. [...] " [...] As Attaway wrote, [...] "The nearness of a farmer to his farm was easily understood. But no man was close to steel. It was shipped across endless tracks to all the world." ...|$|R

50|$|Only {{two ships}} were {{delivered}} before {{the outbreak of}} war and served in the Chilean Navy until 1945. The remaining four ships were purchased by the British in 1914 and fought in the Royal Navy during World War I as the Faulknor-class flotilla leaders. The three surviving ships were returned to the friendly nation of Chile in 1920, and formed the Almirante Williams class - taking their name from the original name of HMS Botha - but being <b>worn</b> out were <b>scrapped</b> in 1933.|$|R
5000|$|Shortly {{after he}} sold Marysville Rotary Broom Service, Inc., Drumm would {{start a new}} company, Drumm Industries, where he would {{manufacture}} push brooms {{for a short period}} until a no-compete contract would expire. In 1988 he would receive a patent for a push broom head of the channel-mounted bristle type. He would then focus a considerable amount of time innovating a replaceable strip brush. This changed the whole process of manufacturing tube-brooms, as one tube could be recycled simply by replacing the brush through replaceable slide-on strips, versus the old method of wrapping the brush around the tube, welding it together, and shipping the tube back for a replacement wrap when it was <b>worn</b> out, or <b>scrapping</b> the tube altogether. Drumm would obtain several patents relating to the strip brush innovation.|$|R
40|$|Regenerative chatter {{is a major}} {{limitation}} to {{the productivity}} and quality of machining operations due to the excessive rate of tool <b>wear</b> and <b>scrap</b> parts which are produced. Machining chatter analysis techniques examine {{the stability of the}} closed-loop model (force process and machine tool-part structure) of the machining operation to determine the stable process parameter space. Almost all chatter analysis techniques assume a linear force process and develop stability lobe diagrams (i. e., plots of the stable and unstable regions in the process parameter space) for a specific feed. It is well known that machining force processes inherently contain a nonlinear relationship between the force and the feed, which is typically described by a power law. In this paper, the linear chatter analysis technique developed by Budak and Altintas is extended to account for the forcefeed nonlinearity. The analysis provides insight into the effect feed has on chatter in machining operations. Also, by directly including the force-feed nonlinearity in the chatter analysis, the need to calibrate the force process model at different feeds is alleviated. The analysis is developed for turning and face milling operations and is validated via time domain simulations for both operations and by experiments for a face milling operation. The analyses show excellent agreement with both the time domain simulations and the experiments. Further, several end milling experiments were conducted that illustrate the nonlinear effect feed has on chatter in machining operations. ï¿½DOI: 10. 1115 / 1. 2783276...|$|R
5000|$|It {{appears in}} Cold Days during {{the fight in}} Mac's tavern and later at battle for the control of Demonreach island. Harry refers to this Outsider as [...] "Sharkface" [...] and is advised by Mac not to banter with He Who Walks Before, but to kill him, and quickly. He appears in a vaguely {{humanoid}} form <b>wearing</b> a dirty, <b>scrapped</b> cloak which has long strips of cloth that snap like a flag in a fierce wind. The cloak {{appears to be a}} part of the Outsider and is used for attacks and defense, allowing the outsider to curl up into a ball and grab objects with the cloak. Like other Outsiders, He Who Walks Before has no respect for The Accords and ignores the neutral ground signage at Mac's pub. During the battle at Demonreach, the Outsider demonstrates a powerful psychic attack ability, convincing Harry, albeit briefly, that Mab is here condemning him for his actions. At the end of Cold Days, Sharkface appears to have been banished back to the Outer Gates.|$|R
40|$|The {{metal working}} {{industry}} needs {{to reduce the}} waste associated with <b>scrap,</b> <b>worn</b> tools, degradation of metal working fluids, and etc. One task in this project concerned metal working fluids (MWF), which typically consists of surfactants, anti-microbial agents, lubricating agents, complexing agents, {{and a number of}} other components. The waste stream volume from the MWF can be reduced by judiciously (1) recycling, (2) selective replacement of expended components, and (3) protecting against microbial contamination. This activity consists of developing an analytical method, amenable to automation, which addresses all three of the methods of extending the MWF lifetime, thereby reducing the waste stream. The technology for determining key components in MWF on-line (at the machine tool) did not exist. The Y- 12 Plant`s collaboration was selected for this particular endeavor because of its ongoing machining operations and expertise in automation. In addition, concerns have been raised regarding chronic exposure of machine shop personnel to metal working fluid mists generated during routine machining operations. The chemical composition of metal working fluids is fairly well known, however, the chemical and physical characteristics of the resulting aerosols (mists) are not as well known. Machinists exposed to these aerosols by inhalation and skin contact sometimes develop unpleasant reactions. The second task involved efforts to characterize mists generated from candidate cutting fluids...|$|R
40|$|A three {{jaw chuck}} set from a lathe machine tool failed whilst in use. At some prior {{point in time}} the {{case-hardened}} chuck jaw set had sustained damage to its gripping serrations, thus requiring refurbishment of the jaws. Shortly after re-entering service, the refurbished jaw number one (of three) failed traumatically. Sudden loss of grip allowed a large rapidly rotating work piece to be thrown free, hitting and inflicting seriously injury to the machine tool operator. Analysis of the broken jaw revealed sub-surface case-cracking, initiated {{as a result of}} metallurgical changes induced by thermal processing undertaken as part of the refurbishment cycle. Fatigue propagation of a case-crack had then ensued, driving the crack to final traumatic failure. Further analysis revealed stress raising features on a second jaw. This particular jaw had initiated a longitudinal crack that, at the time of observation, had not propagated to failure. Therefore, both thermal processing and design shortcomings were found to be at issue with this incident. When considering the safety critical nature of lathe chuck jaws, a question to consider is whether a more prudent route of action is required for the future. Rather than attempting refurbishment, it would be reasonable simply to <b>scrap</b> <b>worn</b> jaws. This is considered a sensible course of future action, rather than running the risk of being overtaken by a similar failure. Finally, the issue of ineffective or non-existent machine tool guarding was considered, with the outcomes effectively reducing injury compensation awarded to the machine tool operator. ...|$|R
60|$|When the {{bachelor}} {{had given her}} in connection with almost every tomb and flat grave-stone some history of its own, he took her down into the old crypt, now a mere dull vault, and showed her how it had been lighted up {{in the time of}} the monks, and how, amid lamps depending from the roof, and swinging censers exhaling scented odours, and habits glittering with gold and silver, and pictures, and precious stuffs, and jewels all flashing and glistening through the low arches, the chaunt of aged voices had been many a time heard there, at midnight, in old days, while hooded figures knelt and prayed around, and told their rosaries of beads. Thence, he took her above ground again, and showed her, high up in the old walls, small galleries, where the nuns had been wont to glide along--dimly seen in their dark dresses so far off--or to pause like gloomy shadows, listening to the prayers. He showed her too, how the warriors, whose figures rested on the tombs, had <b>worn</b> those rotting <b>scraps</b> of armour up above--how this had been a helmet, and that a shield, and that a gauntlet--and how they had wielded the great two-handed swords, and beaten men down, with yonder iron mace. All that he told the child she treasured in her mind; and sometimes, when she awoke at night from dreams of those old times, and rising from her bed looked out at the dark church, she almost hoped to see the windows lighted up, and hear the organ's swell, and sound of voices, on the rushing wind.|$|R
