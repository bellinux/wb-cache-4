40|$|The {{acoustic}} {{and mechanical}} properties {{of a class}} of particle filled polymers have been investigated using destructive and non-destructive testing techniques. The velocities c 1 and ct of the longitudinal and transverse waves were evaluated from the acoustic properties. From these and from {{the density of the}} material, the modulus of elasticity, the shear modulus, and the Poisson ratio were evaluated by the appropriate relationships. The results were compared <b>with</b> <b>those</b> obtained <b>from</b> tensile experiments and also <b>with</b> <b>those</b> obtained <b>from</b> a theoretical formula derived previously. Finally, to investigate the effect of frequency, the results obtained from ultrasonic experiments were compared <b>with</b> <b>those</b> obtained <b>from</b> dynamic experiments carried out on iron-epoxy composites. It was found that the results from ultrasonic tests are closer to <b>those</b> obtained <b>from</b> dynamic experiments than to <b>those</b> <b>from</b> static ones. © 1996 The Institute of Materials...|$|R
5|$|A {{haplotype}} is a {{group of}} genes found in an organism that are inherited together from one of their parents. A haplogroup {{is a group}} of similar haplotypes that share a single mutation inherited from their common ancestor. Mitochondrial DNA (mDNA) passes along the maternal line and can date back thousands of years. A 2005 study compared the mitochondrial DNA sequences of modern wolves <b>with</b> <b>those</b> <b>from</b> thirty-four specimens dated between 1856 and 1915. The historic population was found to possess twice the genetic diversity of modern wolves, which suggests that the mDNA diversity of the wolves eradicated from the western US was more than twice that of the modern population. A 2007 study compared mDNA sequences of modern wolves <b>with</b> <b>those</b> <b>from</b> Beringian wolves. The twenty Beringian wolves yielded sixteen haplotypes that could not be found in modern wolves, compared with seven haplotypes that were found in thirty-two modern Alaskan and Yukon wolves. This finding indicates that Beringian wolves were genetically distinct from modern wolves and possessed greater genetic diversity, and that there once existed in North America a larger wolf population than today.|$|E

The dynamic properties of the dam’s constituent materials estimated from low-strain full-scale tests are consistent <b>with</b> <b>those</b> determined <b>from</b> relatively large strains induced by the two earthquakes. Also the tests revealed substantial change in the dynamic properties of the dam; the behavior is typical of a yielding dynamic system...|$|R

The {{study found that}} the sequences could be allocated into two haplogroups. Haplogroups 1 and 2 could be found among wolves across Eurasia but only haplogroup1 could be found in North America. The ancient wolf samples from western Europe differed from modern wolves by 1 to 10 mutations, and all belonged to haplogroup2, indicating its predominance in this region for over 40,000 years, {{both before and after the}} Last Glacial Maximum. A comparison of current and past frequencies indicates that in Europe haplogroup2 became outnumbered by haplogroup1 over the past several thousand years, but in North America haplogroup2including the Beringian wolfbecame extinct and was replaced by haplogroup1 after the Last Glacial Maximum. However, a 2016 study did not support the existence of two wolf haplogroups.|$|E
5|$|As {{the ship}} was {{intended}} {{to function as a}} floating, self-contained community, it was stocked with victuals (food and drink) that could sustain its inhabitants for extended periods of time. The casks used for storage on the Mary Rose have been compared <b>with</b> <b>those</b> <b>from</b> a wreck of a trade vessel from the 1560s and have revealed that they were of better quality, more robust and reliable, an indication that supplies for the Tudor navy were given high priority, and their requirements set a high standard for cask manufacturing at the time. As a miniature society at sea, the wreck of the Mary Rose held personal objects belonging to individual crew members. This included clothing, games, various items for spiritual or recreational use, and objects related to mundane everyday tasks such as personal hygiene, fishing, and sewing. The master carpenter's chest, for example, contained a backgammon set, a book, three plates, a sundial, and a tankard, goods suggesting he was relatively wealthy.|$|E

5|$|Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine is the Westernized {{release of}} the puzzle game Puyo Puyo and replaces all of its {{characters}} <b>with</b> <b>those</b> <b>from</b> the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise. The entirety of gameplay takes place across two grid-based boards: the left board {{is used by the}} player, while the right board is controlled by either artificial intelligence or a second player, depending on the game mode. The main objective of the game is to earn as many points as possible by grouping the same coloured beans together as they fall down on the board. The player must arrange beans into groups of at least four of the same colour; should they do this, the beans in the group will disappear and points will be accumulated. If the player drops a group of beans on an uneven surface, any bean left hanging will separate from the original group and will drop to the lowest point on the board. The player may also flip a group of falling beans horizontally or vertically.|$|E
5|$|Further {{changes were}} made to the {{techniques}} used. Each morning, 36 chickens were roasted for their juices rather than the meat being used on the menu. Each chicken was pressed in a colander to ensure that all the liquid was expressed. These juices were mixed <b>with</b> <b>those</b> <b>from</b> the roasting trays after they had been deglazed with Madeira wine and then added a small amount of veal stock. The actual roasted chickens ended up being too dry to serve following the process, and so were used for staff lunches or were discarded. These 36 chickens produced enough juice for the sauces to accompany 30 chicken dishes. Similar processes were conducted with lamb shoulders, where they were pressed only for the creation of sauces.|$|E

Black storks summering in western Asia migrate to northern and northeastern India, ranging mainly from Punjab south to Karnataka, and Africa. They are occasional visitors to Sri Lanka. Those summering further east in eastern Russia and China winter mainly in southern China, and occasionally in Hong Kong, Myanmar, northern Thailand, and Laos.
