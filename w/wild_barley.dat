25|$|The <b>wild</b> <b>barley</b> (H. vulgare ssp. spontaneum) found {{currently}} in the Fertile Crescent {{might not be the}} progenitor of the barley cultivated in Eritrea and Ethiopia, indicating that separate domestication may have occurred in eastern Africa.|$|E
25|$|Another {{plant species}} at Riverton that can {{confidently}} {{be identified as}} domesticated was sunflower (Helianthus annuus). This {{is based on the}} larger size of the seed in the domesticated than in the wild varieties. Remains of plants that were used, but {{may or may not have}} been domesticated at Riverton, include bottle gourd (Lagenaria siceraria), squash (C. pepo), <b>wild</b> <b>barley</b> (Hordeum pusillum) and marsh elder (Iva annua).|$|E
50|$|Puccinia striiformis f. sp. hordei, is an obligate {{parasite}} that overseasons on volunteer barley or rye, certain <b>wild</b> <b>barleys</b> such as Hordeum jubatum (foxtail barley), wheat, and numerous perennial grass species.|$|R
5000|$|All foxtails have a {{hardened}} tip, {{sometimes called}} a [...] "callus", and retrorse barbs, pointing {{away from the}} tip of the callus. <b>Wild</b> <b>barleys</b> have clusters of three spikelets, and the callus is the portion of the rachis to which they attach. In other grasses, such as needlegrass and brome grasses, the foxtail consists of a single spikelet, with the callus being the hardened lemma tip. Retrorse barbs {{can be found on the}} callus, the lemmas, and the awns.|$|R
40|$|Fifteen Hordeum {{species and}} {{subspecies}} belonging to groups with different genomes were studied usingPCR-based markers to establish phylogenetic relationships within the genus. Two hundred and seventeen RAPDand STS markers {{were used to}} calculate genetic distances and construct phylogenetic trees. The phenetic analysisclearly separated the primary gene pool, represented by H. vulgare ssp. vulgare, H. vulgare ssp. vulgare convar. vulgare f. agriochriton and H. vulgare ssp. spontaneum, from the secondary gene pool, represented by H. bulbosum and the tertiary gene pool, represented by American <b>wild</b> <b>barleys</b> and H. bogdanii. Data obtained fromPCO analysis are {{in complete agreement with}} taxonomic classifications proposed previously, which werecomparisons of numerous morphological, cytological and reproductive characters...|$|R
25|$|In {{traditional}} classifications of barley, these morphological {{differences have}} led to different forms of barley being classified as different species. Under these classifications, two-rowed barley with shattering spikes (<b>wild</b> <b>barley)</b> is classified as Hordeum spontaneum K. Koch. Two-rowed barley with nonshattering spikes is classified as H. distichum L., six-row barley with nonshattering spikes as H. vulgare L. (or H. hexastichum L.), and six-row with shattering spikes as H. agriocrithon Åberg.|$|E
25|$|Selectively {{propagated}} figs, <b>wild</b> <b>barley</b> {{and wild}} oats were cultivated {{at the early}} Neolithic site of Gilgal I, where in 2006 archaeologists found caches of seeds of each in quantities too large to be accounted for even by intensive gathering, at strata datable to c. 11,000 years ago. Some of the plants tried and then abandoned during the Neolithic period in the Ancient Near East, at sites like Gilgal, were later successfully domesticated {{in other parts of}} the world.|$|E
25|$|Spikelets are {{arranged}} in triplets which alternate along the rachis. In <b>wild</b> <b>barley</b> (and other Old World species of Hordeum), only the central spikelet is fertile, while {{the other two are}} reduced. This condition is retained in certain cultivars known as two-row barleys. A pair of mutations (one dominant, the other recessive) result in fertile lateral spikelets to produce six-row barleys. Recent genetic studies have revealed that a mutation in one gene, vrs1, is responsible for the transition from two-row to six-row barley.|$|E

25|$|According to the Talmud, the {{requirement}} to separate Challah from the dough was imposed on {{the owner of the}} dough, not on the person who kneaded it; hence if the owner was not Jewish, even if the kneader was, Hafrashat Challah was not mandatory.

2500|$|Barley {{was one of}} {{the first}} domesticated grains in the Fertile Crescent, an area of {{relatively}} abundant water in Western Asia, and near the Nile river of northeast Africa. The grain appeared in the same time as einkorn and emmer wheat. [...] <b>Wild</b> <b>barley</b> (H. vulgare ssp. spontaneum) ranges from North Africa and Crete in the west, to Tibet in the east. [...] The earliest evidence of <b>wild</b> <b>barley</b> in an archaeological context comes from the Epipaleolithic at Ohalo II at the southern end of the Sea of Galilee. [...] The remains were dated to about 8500 BCE. [...] The earliest domesticated barley occurs at aceramic ("pre-pottery") Neolithic sites, in the Near East such as the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B layers of Tell Abu Hureyra, in Syria. By 4200 BCE domesticated barley occurs as far as in Eastern Finland. Barley has been grown in the Korean Peninsula since the Early Mumun Pottery Period (circa 1500–850 BCE) along with other crops such as millet, wheat, and legumes.|$|E
50|$|The {{domestication}} {{of barley}} probably occurred around 10,000 {{years ago in}} the Israel and Jordan region of the Fertile Crescent. Barley grains have been found at a number of archaeological sites in this area and the <b>wild</b> <b>barleys</b> here are more molecularly similar to the cultivated gene pool than are any other wild populations. AFLP technology indicates a single domestication of barley, not, as had previously been hypothesized, a series of domestications in different parts of its range such as in Ethiopia and in the Mediterranean region. Further research using haplotype frequency in different geographic parts of the range led to the inference that there were at least two domestication events, one in the Fertile Crescent and another some 1500 to 3000 km further east. The former gave rise to the cultivars grown in Europe and America while the latter gave rise to the diversity of cultivated crops in central Asia and the Far East.|$|R

40|$|Genetic {{variation}} {{present in}} <b>wild</b> and cultivated <b>barley</b> populations was investigated using two sources of microsatellite {{also known as}} simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. EST-SSRs are derived from expressed sequences and genomic SSRs are isolated from genomic DNA. Genomic SSR markers detected {{a higher level of}} polymorphism than those derived from ESTs. Polymorphism information content was higher in genomic SSRs than EST-derived SSRs. This study showed that the EST-SSR markers developed in cultivated barley are polymorphic in wild and cultivated varieties and produced high quality markers. Ten of these functional markers were polymorphic across the accessions studied. EST markers indicated clearer separation between <b>wild</b> and cultivated <b>barley</b> than genomic SSRs. The EST-SSRs are a valuable source of new polymorphic markers and should be highly applicable to barley genetic resources, providing a direct estimate of functional biodiversity...|$|R
2500|$|<b>Wild</b> <b>barley</b> has a brittle spike; upon maturity, the spikelets separate, facilitating seed dispersal. [...] Domesticated barley has nonshattering spikes, {{making it}} much easier to harvest the mature ears. [...] The nonshattering {{condition}} is caused by a mutation in one of two tightly linked genes known as Bt1 and Bt2; many cultivars possess both mutations. The nonshattering condition is recessive, so varieties of barley that exhibit this condition are homozygous for the mutant allele.|$|E
2500|$|Barley is {{a member}} of the grass family. It is a self-pollinating, diploid species with 14 chromosomes. [...] The wild {{ancestor}} of domesticated barley, Hordeum vulgare subsp. spontaneum, is abundant in grasslands and woodlands throughout the Fertile Crescent area of Western Asia and northeast Africa, and is abundant in disturbed habitats, roadsides and orchards. Outside this region, the <b>wild</b> <b>barley</b> is less common and is usually found in disturbed habitats. However, in a study of genome-wide diversity markers, Tibet was found to be an additional center of domestication of cultivated barley.|$|E

40|$|Weeds are {{currently}} {{present in a}} wide range of ecosystems worldwide. Although the beginning of their evolution is largely unknown, researchers assumed that they developed in tandem with cultivation since the appearance of agricultural habitats some 12, 000 years ago. These rapidly-evolving plants invaded the human disturbed areas and thrived in the new habitat. Here we present unprecedented new findings of the presence of "proto-weeds" and small-scale trial cultivation in Ohalo II, a 23, 000 -year-old hunter-gatherers' sedentary camp on the shore of the Sea of Galilee, Israel. We examined the plant remains retrieved from the site (ca. 150, 000 specimens), placing particular emphasis on the search for evidence of plant cultivation by Ohalo II people and the presence of weed species. The archaeobotanically-rich plant assemblage demonstrates extensive human gathering of over 140 plant species and food preparation by grinding <b>wild</b> wheat and <b>barley.</b> Among these, we identified 13 well-known current weeds mixed with numerous seeds of <b>wild</b> emmer, <b>barley,</b> and oat. This collection provides the earliest evidence of a human-disturbed environment-at least 11 millennia before the onset of agriculture-that provided the conditions for the development of "proto-weeds", a prerequisite for weed evolution. Finally, we suggest that their presence indicates the earliest, small-scale attempt to cultivate wild cereals seen in the archaeological record...|$|R

40|$|Little {{is known}} about the genetic {{divergence}} in the chromosomal regions with domesticated and non-domesticated genes. The objective of our study is to examine the effect of natural selection on shaping genetic diversity of chromosome region with domesticated and non-domesticated genes in barley using 110 SSR markers. Comparison of the genetic diversity loss between <b>wild</b> and cultivated <b>barley</b> for each chromosome showed that chromosome 5 H had the highest divergence of 35. 29 %, followed by 3 H, 7 H, 4 H, 2 H, 6 H. Diversity ratio was calculated as (diversity of wild type - diversity of cultivated type) /diversity of wild type× 100 %. It was found that diversity ratios of the domesticated regions on 5 H, 1 H and 7 H were higher than those of non-domesticated regions. Diversity ratio of the domesticated region on 2 H and 4 H {{is similar to that of}} non-domesticated region. However, diversity ratio of the domesticated region on 3 H is lower than that of non-domesticated region. Averaged diversity among six chromosomes in domesticated region was 33. 73 % difference between <b>wild</b> and cultivated <b>barley,</b> and was 27. 56 % difference in the non-domesticated region.

Toxic Cu 2 + concentrations in the medium resulted in an increase of the variation coefficient for the studied parameters which was more distinctly expressed in the hexaploid tritordeums. The octoploid tritordeum HT 73 demonstrated greater tolerance to the heavy metal based on the changes in the weight and length of the above-ground parts of the plants. No significant changes in the pigment content and in the chlorophyll fluorescence parameters were established indicating that the photosynthetic apparatus activity was not substantially affected by toxic Cu 2 + concentrations...|$|R
