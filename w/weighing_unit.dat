40|$|Weight of cows {{affects a}} large number of factors. Regular {{weighing}} and data processing can detect differences that may indicate disorders requiring nursing interventions, e. g. nutritional deficiencies, incorrect fetal development and health problems. The current weighing systems operate as stationary - the animal is fixed, identified and weighed. However, the procedure is time consuming and operation, and that is way this system is used minimally. That implies the need of complete automation of all activities associated with the weighing, which enables introduction of pass – through weight. The aim of this thesis was to develop a methodology for evaluating health and nutritional status of the herd based on data from an automated system for weighing a live weight of dairy cows. There was used in the <b>weighing</b> <b>unit</b> for milking robots Astronaut A 3 (Lely company) to obtain weight data of individual cows.

40|$|An {{automated}} semi-industrial {{system with}} in-line near-infrared reflectance (NIR) for {{the characterization of}} the chemical composition of potatoes was designed and constructed, and its performance was tested. The system consisted of the following subsystems: sample crate manipulator, <b>weighing</b> <b>unit</b> for the gross sample weight, potato washing machines with a washing water recycling system, belt for visual inspection of the potatoes, unit for measuring the underwater weight (UWW), industrial rotary saw blade rasp for pulping the potatoes equipped with a sulfite dosage system for inhibiting enzymatic browning of the pulped potatoes, and industrial NIR system for the measurement of the potato composition. The whole system was controlled and operated by a programmable logic controller and process personal computer system. The system was able to process 12 potato samples per hour. Measurements were done to establish the sample carry-over in the system. The carry-over was proven to be well below the maximum acceptable level of 2 %. The UWW values established with the automatic system corresponded very well with the UWW data obtained by manual weighting. The day-to-day reproducibility of the UWW system was tested with golf balls. These balls have about the same specific gravity and size as potatoes. The day-to-day reproducibility coefficient of variation of the UWW unit was 0. 4 %. As a principle of proof, two tentative partial least squares calibration models, one for the starch concentration {{and one for the}} coagulating protein concentration in the potato samples, were calculated, applying leaving one out cross-validation. Both models were very promising. The by NIR-predicted starch concentrations showed to be at least as good or even better than the by UWW-obtained starch concentrations. The average difference between the by NIR-predicted and the chemically measured starch concentration was 0. 0 ± 0. 3 % (w/w). For the coagulating protein concentration, the average difference between the by NIR-predicted and the chemically measured concentration was 0. 00 ± 0. 06 % (w/w). In future years, potatoes of a wider range of varieties, growing locations, and growing seasons have {{to be added to the}} present tentative model, in order to get a robust NIR model. © 2010 EAPR...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Grading {{agricultural}} products {{always has a}} particular important position for submission to domestic and overseas markets. The grading causes more profitable product ranges and customer satisfaction. Grading treatment is carried out based on various parameters such as color, ripeness level, dimensions and weight. Product weight {{is one of the}} most effective parameters in grading operation. Egg weight is directly related to the smallness and coarseness of eggs. In egg grading, the largeness value is very important in marketing. This research aimed to design, fabricate and evaluate the egg weighing system based on its dielectric properties. Materials and Methods: To perform this research, the stages of work are divided into several sections including, design and construction of the hardware section, writing code for the software section to collect data, conducting nondestructive tests and data collection, analysis of obtained data using artificial intelligence, and giving the results of analysis for device calibration of the system as the software code. The large eggs as dielectric substances cause more increase in the capacity of the capacitive sensor. Furthermore, by derivation of a relation between capacity of capacitive sensor and egg weight, one can predict the weight of the sample. A prototype unit of weighing system was designed and fabricated. The designed unit was composed of a chassis, a voltage source, a sinusoidal signal generator, a voltage measurement unit, an AVR micro controller, a COM port, a capacitive sensor, and an LCD and a keyboard. Neural network technique was used for egg weight prediction. The designed net receives 16 voltage values at different frequencies as inputs and its output is the egg weight. In order to calibrate and evaluate the <b>weighing</b> <b>unit,</b> 150 fresh egg samples were provided on egg laying day from a local poultry farm. Experiments were divided into three groups. The experiments were carried out on egg-laying day, and the second and fourth day after laying. Results and Discussion: In this study, two networks were built and evaluated. In the first series, two-layer networks and in the second series, three-layer networks were developed. In the two-layer neural networks, the number of neurons in the hidden layer was changed from 2 to 10. According to the given results for two-layer networks, two layer networks with 10 neurons offer the best results (the highest R-value and minimum RMSE) and it can be chosen as the most effective two-layer network. Three-layer neural networks have been composed of two hidden layers. The number of neurons in the first hidden layer was 10 and in the second layer it was changed from 1 to 20. Between three-layer networks, the network with 7 neurons with the highest R-value and the lowest error is the most appropriate network. It is even more efficient than the two-layer network with 10 neurons. So, the most appropriate structure is 1 - 7 - 10 - 16 and it has been selected for calibration of the weighing device. To evaluate and assess the accuracy of the weighing machine, weights of 24 samples of fresh eggs were predicted and compared with the actual values obtained using a digital scale with the accuracy of 0. 01 gr. The paired t-test has been used to compare the measured and predicted values and the Bland-Altman method has been used for charting the accordance between the measured and predicted values. Based on the findings, the difference between the measured and predicted values was observed up to 5. 4 gr that is related to a very large sample. The mean absolute error is equal to 2. 21 gr and the mean absolute percentage error is equal to 3. 75...|$|E

40|$|A {{new method}} is {{described}} {{for determining the}} effect of original earning (or any other variable) on forgetting. The major question is, How much forgetting time is required for memory performance to fall from any given level to some lower level? If this time {{is the same for}} different degrees of original learning, then forgetting is not affected by degree of original earning. If this time is greater for higher degrees of original earning, then forgetting is slower with higher original learning. Application of the method to a variety of forgetting data indicated that forgetting is slower for higher degrees of original earning. Slamecka nd McElree (1983) performed three experiments o determine how degree of original learning affects forgetting from long-term memory. Subjects learned verbal material to one of two levels of proficiency and were then tested a t a delay interval ranging from 0. 0 to 5. 0 days. A variety of different kinds of information were tested by free recall, cued recall, and recognition. Very regular data were obtained; the degree of original earning did not interact with delay inter-val. Slamecka nd McElree concluded that forget-ting was independent of degree of original earning. This conclusion follows if "forgetting " is oper-ationally defined to be the slope of the forgetting function between any two delay intervals. It is not clear, however, that this definition will ultimately prove to be the most useful in illuminating the processes that underlie forgetting.

Imagine two chunks of radioactive material, identical except in size; the smaller chunk <b>weighs</b> 10 <b>units,</b> and the larger chunk <b>weighs</b> 20 <b>units.</b> Suppose the two chunks decay exponentially with identical decay parameters.
