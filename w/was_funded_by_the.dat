5|$|Another {{project of}} the Laboratory for Nuclear Science was a {{synchrotron}} particle accelerator, {{which was designed to}} accelerate electrons to an energy of 350MeV. The accelerator <b>was</b> <b>funded</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Office of Naval Research and built under the supervision of Ivan A. Getting, who was a professor of electrical engineering and had worked at the Radiation Laboratory on the extremely successful SCR‑584 radar. Although its construction began in 1946, the accelerator had not begun to work by 1949. In response, Zacharias asked Sands to assist. This was Sands's introduction to accelerator physics, and with his help the machine became operational early in 1950.|$|E

The first competition, in 1924, produced 26 designs—all of which were lost before judging could be completed after fire destroyed the building {{in which they were}} housed. A second competition, in 1926, produced 18 entries, out of which the design by the architectural firm Woods, Bagot, Jory & Laybourne-Smith was selected as the winner.|$|E
