Surface depressions and groups of deep oscillation marks form at meniscus and reduce local heat transfer as they move down the mold at the casting speed. This slows shell growth, increases shell surface temperature, and causes characteristic dips in mold thermocouple signals. More importantly, they are also associated with longitudinal cracks. Characteristic thermocouple signatures have been identified for many defects, including sticker breakouts, transverse depressions and deep oscillation marks, narrow-face bleeds, transverse corner cracks, longitudinal cracks, mold level fluctuation defects, and other problems.

An integral prediction method was used three different porous <b>wall</b> skin <b>friction</b> relations, in addition to a solid-surface relation for the suction cases.

The integral method with one of the porous <b>wall</b> skin <b>friction</b> laws gave very good agreement with data for most of the cases considered.

The high hoop strength of the cell walls, together with the passive earth and passive resistance of adjacent cells, also increases soil strength and stiffness.

The physical mechanisms responsible for the slip velocity between the dusty fluid and nanoparticles, such as thermophoresis and Brownian motion, are included in this study. The influence of the dusty nanofluid on heat transfer and flow characteristics are investigated in this paper.

40|$|A {{theoretical}} model of one-body nuclear friction which was developed earlier, namely the chaos-weighted wall formula, {{is applied to}} a dynamical description of compound nuclear decay {{in the framework of}} the Langevin equation coupled with statistical evaporation of light particles and photons. We have used both the usual <b>wall</b> formula <b>friction</b> and its chaos-weighted version in the Langevin equation to calculate the fission probability and prescission neutron multiplicity for the compound nuclei $^{ 178 }$W, $^{ 188 }$Pt, $^{ 200 }$Pb, $^{ 213 }$Fr, $^{ 224 }$Th, and $^{ 251 }$Es. We have also obtained the contributions of the presaddle and postsaddle neutrons to the total prescission multiplicity. A detailed analysis of our results leads us to conclude that the chaos-weighted <b>wall</b> formula <b>friction</b> can adequately describe the fission dynamics in the presaddle region. This friction, however, turns out to be too weak to describe the postsaddle dynamics properly. This points to the need for a suitable explanation for the enhanced neutron emission in the postsaddle stage of nuclear fission.

40|$|Energy loss in {{vascular}} networks In {{the following}} three sections, we summarize the hydrodynamic reasoning that provides the formal background to various Assumptions gathered in section 2. 1 of the main text, in particular the area-preserving and area-increasing constraints, equations (3) and (4), {{as well as the}} proportionality of blood volume and body mass. As we repeatedly emphasize, this material is not novel. Our intent is to provide a concise and rigorous summary of the WBE theory that is scattered across the literature. Minimization of energy loss to dissipation Lagrange multiplier calculation Assumption 6 of West, Brown, and Enquist (WBE) posits that natural selection has minimized the energy required for pumping blood through the vascular network.

40|$|We {{study the}} rise {{dynamics}} {{of a large}} particle in a granular bed under vertical vibration using molecular dynamics simulations. Systematic variation of the particle properties and external <b>wall</b> <b>friction</b> in the simulations shows that the large particle rising is very sensitive to external <b>wall</b> <b>friction.</b> The dynamical response of the granular bed with <b>wall</b> <b>friction</b> is shown to include an expansion stage and a compression stage within one cycle. With <b>wall</b> <b>friction,</b> large-scale force networks bearing larger-than-average forces {{are found in the}} compression stage. However, without <b>wall</b> <b>friction,</b> large strong force networks do not exist. The distribution of normal contact forces in the force networks is found to have an exponential tail similar to those in packing experiments. Numerical estimation of the two-point spatial correlation of normal contact force reveals predominantly short-range force correlation persisting over only 2 – 3 particle diameters. The structural properties of the force network are analyzed using a graph-theoretic approach, which is a modification of a minimum spanning tree (MST) constructed on the particles in physical space. The modified MST algorithm, which identifies local structures such as nearest neighbors, asymptotically recovers all particle contacts, the force distribution, and spatial force correlation of the force network. This indicates that although <b>wall</b> <b>friction</b> strongly affects the rising dynamics of the Brazil nut over the device scale (tens of particle diameters) through the force network, it does so through local short-range interactions.

40|$|Allowing shear {{walls to}} rock {{is one way}} of {{protecting}} structures from earthquake damage, or at least minimising this damage. Walls allowed to rock must have the ability to resist both overturning moment, and lateral forces. While resistance to overturning is typically provided by self-weight, post-tensioned cables, and/or damping devices acting as hold-downs, a particular challenge is to provide adequate resistance to lateral forces, which will not interfere with, nor disturb the function of the devices chosen to resist overturning. During an earthquake, there will typically be high contact forces between the shear keys and shear <b>walls.</b> <b>Friction</b> induced by these contact forces can add to the moment resistance against overturning – often in an unpredictable way. While supplemental moment resistance could be considered a desirable outcome in the case of non-rocking walls; in the case of rocking walls, their load limiting ability could be compromised. A new shear key concept, that is both simple and economical, is proposed and implemented at the bottom centre of an experimental timber wall that is allowed to rock. Under loading, the shear key performed as intended, providing adequate lateral resistance, {{while at the same time}} allowing the wall to rock in the intended manner...|$|R
