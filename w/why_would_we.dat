He once offered {{to sell the}} control of NEMS to Stigwood, without telling any of his artists about the offer. McCartney was taking a more active interest in NEMS' finances, as it became known that some artists with more ruthless managers claimed to be benefiting from more commercially advantageous terms, such as the Rolling Stones under the management of Allen Klein. After Epstein's death, Clive Epstein assumed control of NEMS as the company's second largest shareholder. Stigwood then tried to take over management of NEMS, but all four Beatles vigorously objected, with Lennon saying, [...] "We don't know you. <b>Why</b> <b>would</b> <b>we</b> do this?" ...|$|E

2500|$|After the {{collapse}} of the joint-Nintendo project, Sony briefly considered allying itself with Sega to produce a stand-alone console. The Sega CEO at the time, Tom Kalinske, took the proposal to Sega's Board of Directors in Tokyo, who promptly vetoed the idea. Kalinske, in a 2013 interview recalled them saying [...] "that’s a stupid idea, Sony doesn't know how to make hardware. They don’t know how to make software either. <b>Why</b> <b>would</b> <b>we</b> want to do this?". This prompted Sony into halting their research, but ultimately the company decided to use what it had developed so far with both Nintendo and Sega to make it into a complete console based upon the Super Famicom. As a result, Nintendo filed a lawsuit claiming breach of contract and attempted, in US federal court, to obtain an injunction against the release of what was originally christened the [...] "Play Station", on the grounds that Nintendo owned the name. The federal judge presiding over the case denied the injunction and, in October 1991, the first incarnation of the aforementioned brand new game system was revealed. However, it is theorised that only 200 or so of these machines were ever produced.|$|E
2500|$|It was {{reported}} in the press that the Sauber, Lotus and Force India teams had considered withdrawing from the race to signal a message to Formula One's commercial leaders about the current financial state of the sport following Caterham and Marussia's non-participation in the race. Ecclestone stated that if two of those teams left Formula One then [...] "that is what will happen" [...] and that teams should only be taking part if they were competitive. Force India team principal Bob Fernley said discussions about a boycott but it would only be performed as a final recourse. Lotus owner Gérard Lopez later admitted he had not heard about the proposed boycott and the team insisted that they would contest the Grand Prix. Vijay Mallya, the owner of Force India, severely criticised suggestions of a boycott six days after the race: [...] "Who said that we wanted to boycott the race? Please tell me. If I am wrong, you educate me. I speak on behalf of Force India.

2500|$|Romney {{got into}} a long {{discussion}} with moderator George Stephanopoulos over whether states {{have the right to}} ban contraception or whether that was trumped by a constitutional right to privacy. Romney said, [...] "So you're asking, given the fact that there's no state that wants to do so and I don't know of any candidate that wants to do so, you're asking could it constitutionally be done? We can ask our constitutionalist here," [...] gesturing to Ron Paul, which drew laughter and applause from the audience. The discussion continued until Romney grew frustrated at the repeated questioning and asserted, [...] "States don't want to ban contraception. So <b>why</b> <b>would</b> <b>we</b> try {{and put it in the}} Constitution?... Contraception, it's working just fine, just leave it alone." [...] Stephanopoulos later joked on The Colbert Report that he had a bet with fellow moderator Diane Sawyer that he could get Romney to say [...] "contraceptions are working just fine".

[...] When O'Reilly mentioned recent news reports that DNA testing had failed to match any of the defendants, Sharpton said, [...] "I think that all of the facts that you have laid out the DA had — and I know this DA is probably not one that is crazy. He would not have proceeded if he did not feel that he could convict." [...] Sharpton continued that the case parallels [...] "Abner Louima, who was raped and sodomized in a bathroom." [...] At the conclusion of the interview, when O'Reilly said that Sharpton didn't know what happened, Sharpton agreed. [...] "I don't know yet and I think that the proper {{thing to do is to}} support those that want justice." ...|$|E

[...] Whilst on tour with Girls Aloud, the band released their first single [...] "If This Is Love". The song features additional backing vocals from Danish singer Nabiha. The song charted at number eight on the UK Singles Chart after it sold 14,990 copies in its first week of release. The single was also the second highest new entry of the week behind Katy Perry's [...] "I Kissed a Girl" [...] which debuted at number four.

Massachusetts has basically said discriminating against people {{of the same sex}} is unconstitutional. So <b>why</b> <b>would</b> <b>we</b> try so hard to uphold another state's discriminatory law?"

[...] In an interview on April 23 Romney said: [...] "Massachusetts should not become the Las Vegas of same-sex marriage. We do not intend to export our marriage confusion to the entire nation." [...] His spokesman announced he was sending letters to the governors and attorneys general of the other states to explain his view that same-sex marriage was not legal in their state and asking [...] "if we're wrong" [...] about that. Denying license to all out-state couples became known as [...] "the Romney plan". It also allowed visitors from Ontario to marry, since same-sex marriage was legal there.
