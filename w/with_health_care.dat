25|$|<b>With</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> {{knowledge}} growing steadily, nurses {{can stay}} ahead of the curve through continuing education. Continuing education classes and programs enable nurses to provide the best possible care to patients, advance nursing careers, and keep up with Board of Nursing requirements. The American Nurses Association and the American Nursing Credentialing Center are devoted to ensuring nurses have access to quality continuing education offerings. Continuing education classes are calibrated to provide enhanced learning for all levels of nurses. Many States also regulate Continuing Nursing Education. Nursing licensing boards requiring Continuing Nursing Education (CNE) as a condition for licensure, either initial or renewal, accept courses provided by organizations that are accredited by other state licensing boards, by the American Nursing Credentialing Center (ANCC), or by organizations that have been designated as an approver of continuing nursing education by ANCC. There are some exceptions to this rule including the state of California, Florida and Kentucky. National Healthcare Institute has created a list to assist nurses in determining their CNE credit hours requirements. While this list is not all inclusive, it offers details on how to contact nursing licensing boards directly.|$|E

Families were forced to watch women being sexually assaulted. Survivors of the attacks have reported major health issues {{as a result of}} the rapes. 87 percent reported vaginal discharge and 79 percent have reported lower abdominal pains. Fistulas were commonplace among survivors, 41 percent reported the discharge of fecal and urinary matter from the vagina. Psychological trauma includes nightmares and insomnia, with 77 percent reporting that they suffered from these. 91 percent of survivors {{reported that}} they lived in fear and felt ashamed over the assaults. At the Saint Paul Health Center in Uvira, in a review of medical records from 658 survivors nine percent returned positive for HIV. Other sexual infections were syphilis, with thirteen percent infected, and a further 31 percent were infected with gonorrhea. Few victims seek medical attention, due to the costs associated <b>with</b> <b>health</b> <b>care,</b> and also due to the fact that should it become publicly known that they were raped, these survivors would then be socially stigmatized.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Children <b>with</b> special <b>health</b> <b>care</b> needs {{represent}} a growing percentage of pediatric patients treated in all emergency departments.

40|$|Increasingly, {{geographic}} information systems employing spatial data {{are being used}} to identify communities <b>with</b> poorer <b>health</b> <b>care</b> status. Since <b>health</b> <b>care</b> indicators are strongly linked to income, could these data, usually based on adult indicators, be used for pediatric <b>health</b> <b>care</b> need? We hypothesized that individual-level indicators such as quality of life scales (QOL) would be better than community-level indicators at identifying families <b>with</b> poorer <b>health</b> <b>care</b> practices. Surveys and medical record reviews were used for a sample of 174 caregivers of young children. Lower level of income was associated with poorer scores on several QOL domains, and on the primary health practices (i. e., non-urgent emergency room use and lack of age-appropriate immunization status). One community-level indicator, the medically underserved area (MUA), was almost as good as the best individual-level indicators at predicting primary <b>health</b> <b>care</b> practices. The community-level indicator of MUA appears to meet its initial intent, providing information on the location of very low-income individuals <b>with</b> high <b>health</b> <b>care</b> need even among a sample of Medicaid-insured children <b>with</b> an identified <b>health</b> <b>care</b> provider...|$|R
