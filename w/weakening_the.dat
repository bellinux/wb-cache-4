5|$|During {{the decade}} of the 530s, it seemed to many that God had {{abandoned}} the Christian Roman Empire. There were noxious fumes in the air; and the Sun, while still providing day, refused to give much heat. This caused famine unlike anything those of the time had seen before, <b>weakening</b> <b>the</b> people of Europe and the Middle East.|$|E
5|$|The colonial {{administration}} opposed {{efforts by}} the CMS to convert the Bari people of Mongalla. The missionaries interpreted this as due {{to the influence of}} Islam in <b>weakening</b> <b>the</b> spiritual ideals of the officials.Cameron desired to avoid friction with the Muslims who had undertaken most of the work of building and servicing the new provincial capital.|$|E
5|$|The {{departure}} of regular units under Ramorino and Łubieński depleted {{the forces of}} the defenders, further <b>weakening</b> <b>the</b> crew manning the first line of defence. The garrison dropped to 28,000 regular soldiers and 10,000 fresh troops, poorly trained and often armed only with scythes.|$|E

5|$|About an {{hour after}} {{striking}} Long Island, Gloria made its final landfall in western Connecticut near Westport, and proceeded to move through New England while <b>weakening.</b> <b>The</b> NHC estimated that Gloria became extratropical over Maine early by 0000 UTC on September 28. The storm continued to the northeast through Atlantic Canada passing south of Greenland on September 30. The extratropical circulation of Gloria was last noted on October 2, although the remnants later affected Europe.|$|E
5|$|After {{affecting}} Yap, Mitag {{turned to}} the northwest and later to the north due to an approaching trough. It passed {{to the north of}} Palau, contributing to one death there. Despite predictions of <b>weakening,</b> <b>the</b> typhoon continued to intensify, reaching peak winds of 175km/h (110mph 10minute sustained) on March5. The combination of cooler air and interaction with the westerlies caused Mitag to weaken significantly. Only four days after reaching peak winds, the storm had dissipated well to the east of the Philippines.|$|E

5|$|After exiting Cuba {{into the}} Gulf of Mexico, the {{hurricane}} weakened greatly. On October20 it passed {{a short distance}} west of Key West, Florida, and very early on October21 the hurricane moved over Marco Island with winds of 90mph (150km/h). The cyclone weakened further as it turned eastward through the state, deteriorating to tropical storm status as it passed near or over Miami. It accelerated east-northeastward, moving over the Abaco Islands in The Bahamas. Gradually <b>weakening,</b> <b>the</b> storm interacted with an approaching cold front; late on October23 it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone, and shortly thereafter it was absorbed by the front.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the 1824 elections, the Relief faction gained a 22–16 {{majority}} in the state Senate and a 61–39 majority in the House. The pro-Relief majority in the state Senate subsequently elected Rowan to the U.S. Senate, which had the inadvertent effect of <b>weakening</b> <b>the</b> faction's cause in the House by removing its leader there. Rowan served in the Senate from March 4, 1825 to March 3, 1831. During the Twenty-first Congress, he was chairman of the Judiciary Committee.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Hollanda was {{the worst}} {{tropical}} cyclone in Mauritius in 19years. It formed on February6, 1994, in the central Indian Ocean in the southern hemisphere. The cyclone moved southwestward for much of its duration, striking Mauritius on February10 at peak intensity with winds of 155km/h (100mph). It later passed just southeast of Réunion before turning {{to the south and}} <b>weakening.</b> <b>The</b> cyclone became extratropical on February14 in the southern Indian Ocean.|$|E

5|$|During {{his life}} and those of his sons, Constantine was {{presented}} as a paragon of virtue. Pagans such as Praxagoras of Athens and Libanius showered him with praise. When {{the last of his}} sons died in 361, however, his nephew (and son-in-law) Julian the Apostate wrote the satire Symposium, or the Saturnalia, which denigrated Constantine, calling him inferior to the great pagan emperors, and given over to luxury and greed. Following Julian, Eunapius began—and Zosimus continued—a historiographic tradition that blamed Constantine for <b>weakening</b> <b>the</b> Empire through his indulgence to the Christians.|$|E
5|$|In 1662, the Kangxi Emperor moved all {{residents}} along southern China coastline inland by 50 Chinese miles and abandoned the salt-fields {{in hopes of}} <b>weakening</b> <b>the</b> pirate Zheng Chenggong's power through cutting his support from coastline residents. Although the residents were allowed to return in 1669, after the Kangxi Emperor discovered that the migration brought great economic harm, the salt industry in Ham Tin never prospered again.|$|E
5|$|Later populist {{attempts}} to introduce similarly broad-reaching redistributive legislation enlisted {{the support of}} Gaius Marius, a great general, which was then elected to a string of unprecedented consecutive consulships, which also violated Roman law, which mandated a decade between consulships, further <b>weakening</b> <b>the</b> primarily norms-based constitution. The {{attempts to}} recall the general Sulla led to his marching on Rome in 88BC, installing two new consuls and forcing major reforms of the constitution at sword-point, before leaving a campaign in the East. This further strengthened the precedent that the Republic's constitution was malleable.|$|E

5|$|Leo {{was dying}} when Raymond-Roupen came to Cilicia. Leo did not forgive his great-nephew and willed Cilicia to his five-year-old daughter, Isabella, in May 1219. Both Raymond-Roupen (the {{grandson}} of Leo's elder brother, Rupen) and John, King of Jerusalem (the husband of Leo's eldest daughter, Stephanie) {{refused to accept}} Leo's last will, claiming Cilicia for themselves. The new conflict lasted for decades, further <b>weakening</b> <b>the</b> Christian states of Northern Syria.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, as the Fatimids regrouped, the Kalb {{had been}} {{repelled}} from Damascus, and in 1028, their emir died. He {{was replaced by}} his nephew, Rafi ibn Abi'l Layl, who defected to the Fatimids, thus <b>weakening</b> <b>the</b> tripartite Bedouin alliance. In November 1028, Anushtakin returned to Palestine with a large Fatimid army and additional horsemen from the Kalb and Banu Fazara to drive out the Tayy, and also to evict the Mirdasids from central Syria.|$|E

5|$|On {{the same}} day Erica paralleled the coast of New Caledonia before making {{landfall}} on {{the southern end of}} the island at L'Île-des-Pins. However, at the same time the cyclone also entered an area with strong wind shear and thus began to weaken. After passing the island, an extratropical transition begun, <b>weakening</b> <b>the</b> cyclone as it moved towards the southeast. On 15 March, Erica completed its transition into an extratropical cyclone and later fully dissipated the next day.|$|E
5|$|Taraki's Government {{initiated}} a land reform on 1 January 1979 which attempted {{to limit the}} amount of land a family could own. Those whose landholdings exceeded the limit saw their property requisitioned by the government without compensation. The Afghan leadership believed the reform would meet with popular approval among the rural population while <b>weakening</b> <b>the</b> power of the bourgeoisie. The reform was declared complete in mid-1979 and the government proclaimed that 665,000 hectares (approximately 1,632,500 acres) had been redistributed. The government also declared that only 40,000 families, or 4 percent of the population, had been negatively affected by the land reform.|$|E
5|$|The Sirex {{woodwasp}} and Amylostereum areolatum have a mutualistic symbiotic relationship. The Sirex woodwasp is, {{together with}} Sirex juvencus and S. nitobei from eastern Asia, {{one of three}} symbionts of the fungus {{that in the first}} instance benefits from its vector function. Additionally, the wasp creates the optimal conditions for the infestation through the fungus by drilling into the underlying wood layers and <b>weakening</b> <b>the</b> host tree.

50|$|In 2013, Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso stated Japan {{planned to}} use its foreign {{exchange}} reserves to buy bonds issued by the European Stability Mechanism and euro-area sovereigns, in order to <b>weaken</b> <b>the</b> yen.
