25|$|The play {{proceeded}} {{without incident}} until the intermission between {{the fourth and}} fifth act, which occurred shortly after 11pm. During this time, the drop curtain was down, hiding the stage, and the orchestra was playing for the intermission. Some attendees in the parquet circle heard <b>what</b> <b>sounded</b> like a brawl behind the curtain, shouting by men, and the working of machinery; they could easily hear it above the playing of the orchestra.|$|E
25|$|It {{is alleged}} {{sometime}} around or after 4pm, 19-year-old Dick Rowland, a black shoeshiner employed at a Main Street shine parlor, entered the only elevator {{of the nearby}} Drexel Building, at 319 South Main Street, to use the top-floor restroom, which was restricted to blacks. He encountered Sarah Page, the 17-year-old white elevator operator who was on duty. The two likely knew each other at least by sight, as this building {{was the only one}} nearby with a restroom which Rowland had express permission to use, and the elevator operated by Page {{was the only one in}} the building. A clerk at Renberg's, a clothing store located on the first floor of the Drexel, heard <b>what</b> <b>sounded</b> like a woman's scream and saw a young black man rushing from the building. The clerk went to the elevator and found Page in what he said was a distraught state. Thinking she had been assaulted, he summoned the authorities.|$|E

500|$|According to author Andy Gill, by {{starting}} {{his new album}} with <b>what</b> <b>sounded</b> like [...] "a demented marching-band... staffed by crazy {{people out of their}} mind on loco-weed", Dylan delivered his biggest shock yet for his former folkie fans. The elaborate puns on getting stoned combine a sense of paranoiac persecution with [...] "nudge-nudge wink-wink bohemian hedonism". Heylin points out that the Old Testament connotations of getting stoned made the Salvation Army-style musical backing seem like a good joke. The enigmatic title came about, Heylin suggests, because Dylan knew a song entitled [...] "everybody must get stoned" [...] would be kept off the airwaves. Heylin links the title to the Book of Proverbs, chapter 27, verse 15: [...] "A continual dropping in a very rainy day and a contentious woman are alike." [...] Released as a single on March 22, 1966, [...] "Rainy Day Women" [...] reached number two on the Billboard singles chart, and number seven in the UK.|$|E
500|$|A fresh {{round of}} {{interest}} in L'Oiseau Blanc began in the 1980s, after freelance writer Gunnar Hansen of Northeast Harbor, Maine, researched and published {{an article in the}} June 1980 issue of Yankee Magazine, titled [...] "The Unfinished Flight of the White Bird". Hansen revealed how Anson Berry (d. 1936), a hermit living near Machias, Maine, claimed late in the afternoon of 9 May 1927 to have heard a sputtering aircraft fly over his isolated camp at Round Lake, Maine. Berry {{had not been able to}} see the aircraft because of fog and low clouds, but had heard <b>what</b> <b>sounded</b> like a crash or forced landing in the distance. Reportedly Berry tried to locate the crash site but was unsuccessful Hansen and others did a great deal of research during the 1980s, and located multiple other witnesses who reported memories of the aircraft in a line from Nova Scotia down to eastern Maine on that date.|$|E

2500|$|In 1980 the Mariel boatlift brought {{thousands}} of Cuban refugees to the United States. Many of these refugees were musicians, who were astonished to hear <b>what</b> <b>sounded</b> to them like Cuban {{music from the}} 1950s. It {{was as if the}} 60s never happened. Cuban conguero Daniel Ponce summarized this sentiment: [...] "When the Cubans arrived in New York, they all said 'Yuk! This is old music.' The music and the feelings and arrangements [...] changed." [...] In fundamental ways, salsa is the preservation of the late 1950s Cuban sound.|$|E

As Scoggins crouched behind his cab, the man passed within twelve feet of him, pistol in hand, muttering <b>what</b> <b>sounded</b> to him like, [...] "poor dumb cop" [...] or [...] "poor damn cop." [...] The next day, Scoggins viewed a police lineup and identified Oswald as the man whom he had seen with the pistol.|$|E
2500|$|According to Metacritic, How I Got Over was the 15th-best {{reviewed}} {{album of}} 2010. Several critics included {{it in their}} top-10 records lists for the year; it was ranked number seven by Vibe, number five by both The A.V. Club and Todd Martens from the Los Angeles Times, number 10 by both Consequence of Sound and Jim DeRogatis, and number three by BBC Music. Christgau named How I Got Over the year's best album and wrote in The Barnes & Noble Review, [...] "in 2010 <b>what</b> <b>sounded</b> best was the Roots' brave and sometimes painful change-of-life hip-hop, a multivalent reflection on the pop lifer's danger years, the late thirties." [...] He later called it the [...] "most substantial" [...] album of the Roots' career. How I Got Over was also nominated for a 2011 Grammy Award {{in the category of}} Best Rap Album, but lost to Eminem's album Recovery.|$|E

2500|$|Sandford {{believed}} the Epistle of James compelled Christians who were sick to call church elders for prayer and the laying on of hands. [...] Sandford criticized Christians who sought treatment from physicians. He believed that illness {{might be the}} result of either discipline from God or an attack of Satan; but casting out demons required “prevailing prayer,” an exercise that included such protracted fervency and shouting that one skeptic became apprehensive as <b>what</b> <b>sounded</b> “like a hundred people talking at once” concluded with a woman’s screams piercing the din. In 1899, Sandford received a divine message to complete a hospital in a hasty building drive—a technique frequently employed at Shiloh—but it was a hospital in which doctors were permitted only for diagnoses and consultations. [...] No medicines of any kind were provided. Among those influenced by these early religious developments at Shiloh were A. J. Tomlinson, founder of the Church of God, and Charles Fox Parham, {{one of the founders of}} the Pentecostal movement.|$|E
2500|$|A 2010 audio {{analysis}} of the Strubbe tape by Stuart Allen and Tom Owen, who were described by the Cleveland Plain Dealer as [...] "nationally respected forensic audio experts," [...] concluded that the guardsmen were given an order to fire. It is the only known recording to capture the {{events leading up to}} the shootings. According to the Plain Dealer description of the enhanced recording, a male voice yells [...] "Guard!" [...] Several seconds pass. Then, [...] "All right, prepare to fire!" [...] "Get down!," [...] someone shouts urgently, presumably in the crowd. Finally, [...] "Guard!... followed two seconds later by a long, booming volley of gunshots. The entire spoken sequence lasts 17 seconds. Further {{analysis of}} the audiotape revealed that <b>what</b> <b>sounded</b> like four pistol shots and a confrontation occurred approximately 70 seconds before the National Guard opened fire. According to The Plain Dealer, this new analysis raised questions about the role of Terry Norman, a Kent State student who was an FBI informant and known to be carrying a pistol during the disturbance. Alan Canfora said it was premature to reach any conclusions.|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} book Laurents wrote closely {{adhered to}} Romeo and Juliet, but the characters based on Rosaline {{and the parents}} of the doomed lovers were eliminated early on. Later the scenes related to Juliet's faking her death and committing suicide also were deleted. Language posed a problem; four-letter curse words were uncommon in the theater at the time, and slang expressions were avoided for fear they would be dated by the time the production opened. Laurents ultimately invented <b>what</b> <b>sounded</b> like real street talk but actually was not: [...] "cut the frabba-jabba", for example. Sondheim converted long passages of dialogue, and sometimes just a simple phrase like [...] "A boy like that would kill your brother", into lyrics. With the help of Oscar Hammerstein, Laurents convinced Bernstein and Sondheim to move [...] "One Hand, One Heart", which he considered too pristine for the balcony scene, to the scene set in the bridal shop, and as a result [...] "Tonight" [...] was written to replace it. Laurents felt that the building tension needed to be alleviated in order to increase the impact of the play's tragic outcome, so comic relief in the form of Officer Krupke was added to the second act. He was outvoted on other issues: he felt the lyrics to [...] "America" [...] and [...] "I Feel Pretty" [...] were too witty for the characters singing them, but they stayed in the score and proved to be audience favorites. Another song, [...] "Kid Stuff", was added and quickly removed during the Washington, D.C. tryout when Laurents convinced the others it was helping tip the balance of the show into typical musical comedy.|$|E

25|$|Foley {{is another}} method of adding sound effects. Foley {{is more of}} a {{technique}} for creating sound effects than a type of sound effect, but it is often used for creating the incidental real world sounds that are very specific to what is going on onscreen, such as footsteps.
