5|$|It's {{strange to}} hear Uncle Tupelo {{mentioned}} because what <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> {{was in such}} a long line of musical history. People are wrong in starting with us and saying we started anything because we were just picking up the ball, starting with Woody Guthrie and on to the early '60s and the Flying Burrito Brothers that we were influenced by. We didn't start a genre. We contributed to a long line of fairly good music. That's the way we looked at it at the time—doing what was right for the song.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{function}} of the pusdalyvis is to indicate a simultaneous, but secondary action done by the sentence subject in nominative case (it must be matched according to gender and number with the said subject): Lauko darbus mes dirbome dainuodami – <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> the field works while singing. In this case the present padalyvis participle {{can be used as}} well: Lauko darbus mes dirbome dainuojant, but this time the sentence will mean: <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> the field works while someone else was singing. A secondary action done previously by the sentence subject can be expressed with adjectival past simple participle: Lauko darbus mes dirbome padainavę – <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> the field works having sung. When used with the preposition prieš (before), pusdalyvis and padalyvis denote a secondary action in future: Lauko darbus mes dirbome prieš dainuodami. – <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> the field works before singing. Lauko darbus mes dirbome prieš dainuojant. – <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> the field works before someone else started to sing.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{function}} of the padalyvis is to indicate an action that is happening {{at the same time}} (present padalyvis) or before (past padalyvis) the event said with the main verb, of which the sentence subject is not the agent: Lauko darbus mes dirbome saulei šviečiant (present padalyvis) – <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> the field works the sun shining; Skaniai pavalgius malonu pamiegoti (past padalyvis) – Having eaten a delicious meal, it is pleasant to take a nap.|$|E

25|$|After {{having worked}} {{with members of}} 27 as guest musicians on {{previous}} full-length Oceanic, for Panopticon Isis turned to Justin Chancellor, bassist of tour-mates Tool. According to Turner, “he {{was one of the}} first names on the list. He's in a band that we all mutually respect and we felt like he was a person that understood what <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> and could maintain a focus on what we were trying to attain. But he also has some interesting facets of his own musical personality that we thought would blend well with our style.” Wavering Radiant, Isis' 2009 final album, features Adam Jones, also of Tool, as a guest musician.|$|E
25|$|Yesterday I {{stood at}} Arlington National Cemetery {{attending}} {{the funeral of}} a young Marine in my district. He believed in what <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> {{is the right thing}} and had the courage to lay his life on the line to do it. A few minutes ago I received a call from Colonel Danny Bubp, Ohio Representative from the 88th district in the House of Representatives. He asked me to send Congress a message: Stay the course. He also asked me to send Congressman Murtha a message, that cowards cut and run, Marines never do. Danny and the rest of America and the world want the assurance from this body—that we will see this through.|$|E
25|$|During {{the early}} period of {{exploration}} and development of ideas, premature conference presentations and individual seminars were given by {{various members of the}} Cambridge group in other archaeological departments in England and abroad. Individual scholars who were invited to talk to us in Cambridge in that period often felt, understandably, obliged to maintain a distinct opposition. While it is certainly the case that these presentations had occurred before our views had even begun to settle down, and that they were excessively aggressive, they {{played an important role in}} the process of enquiry and reformulation. In particular, the contrasts which were set up by us and by outside scholars allowed the views of the seminar group, and the differences of viewpoint within the group, to be clarified. The opposition highlighted our own opinion but also threw the spotlight on the blind alleys down which there was a danger of straying. Our aggression resulted from the conviction that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> something new. This, too, was important. In the initial period there was a clear idea of what was wrong with existing approaches and there was a faith that something else could be done.|$|E

50|$|Three issues {{must first}} {{be present in the}} affirmative case and are the {{building}} blocks of logically choosing to take any action (in policy debate or in everyday life). They ask; what <b>are</b> <b>we</b> <b>doing</b> now (inherency stock issue)? What could <b>we</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> differently (solvency stock issue)? What are the results of what <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> now versus what <b>we</b> could <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> (significance stock issue)? The last stock issue, topicality, is procedural and unique to debate as it concerns how germane the plan (specifically, plan text) is to the resolution (which isn't usually a restriction in contemporary, outside policy issues).|$|R

When we put that record out, we knew what <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> was illegal, but {{we thought it was}} gonna be such an underground record, nobody would ever hear about it.

It then considers a case of effortful action – running a middle distance race – that threatens this principle. And proposes the solution of changing the metaphysics of action: one can keep hold of the idea that we have first-person authority over what <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> by adopting a disjunctive account of action...|$|R

500|$|The {{episode was}} one of two X-Files episodes to take place in real time—wherein events are {{presented}} at the same rate that the audience experiences them—the other being the sixth season episode [...] "Triangle". Due {{to the nature of the}} shooting schedule, the episode was relatively cheap to film and production moved at a quick pace. Initially, the actors struggled with the new cinéma vérité style of the episode, and several takes were needed for scenes during the first few days, but these problems receded as filming progressed. On one night, three-and-a-half pages of script were shot in only two hours; the normal rate for The X-Files was three to four pages a day. Both Watkins and Mills likened the filming of the episode to live theater. The former noted, [...] "In a sense <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> theater: <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> an act, or half of a whole act in one take." [...] Anderson called the performance [...] "fun" [...] to shoot, and highlighted [...] "Scully getting pissed off at the camera crew" [...] as her favorite part to play. She further noted that [...] "it was interesting to make the adjustment to playing something more real than you might play for television." ...|$|E
