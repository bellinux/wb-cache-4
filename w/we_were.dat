5|$|I {{think that}} the band went on... maybe not a tangent, {{but we had a}} goal in mind, {{and at the end of}} the {{recording}} process, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> so proud of how artistic <b>we</b> <b>were.</b> And I think we showed too much. I think maybe <b>we</b> <b>were</b> a little too jaded and a little too dark, and I {{think that the}} lack of hope and faith that we put on this record made us a little less sparkly and light to people. But I think that it's all part of our evolution. We all went a bit too far.|$|E

5|$|I went to New York and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> in {{the studio}} and came to a break. I was sitting at the piano and told Mariah about this movie. Within two hours, we had this {{incredible}} seed for this song, 'Hero'. It was never meant for Mariah to sing. In her mind, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> writing a song for Gloria Estefan for this movie. And we went into an area that Mariah didn't really go into-in her words, {{it was a little bit}} too schmaltzy or too ballady or too old-fashioned as far as melody and lyrics.|$|E
5|$|It's {{strange to}} hear Uncle Tupelo {{mentioned}} because what <b>we</b> <b>were</b> doing {{was in such}} a long line of musical history. People are wrong in starting with us and saying we started anything because <b>we</b> <b>were</b> just picking up the ball, starting with Woody Guthrie and on to the early '60s and the Flying Burrito Brothers that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> influenced by. We didn't start a genre. We contributed to a long line of fairly good music. That's the way we looked at it at the time—doing what was right for the song.|$|E

He called for stakeholders in the health sector to collaborate enable the ministry achieve Buhari's health agenda. According to The Nation, Adewole said for the apex policy on health to be achieved, {{we need to work}} together and working together means we can make a huge difference. We have been described as a generation that enjoyed better health when <b>we</b> <b>were</b> young than now and our aim is to bring back the health care system we enjoyed when <b>we</b> <b>were</b> young.|$|E

5|$|The unit's {{first major}} {{operation}} was the Pleiku Campaign. During this action, the command supported the division during 35 days of continuous airmobile operations.

60|$|Now, dear reader, let us {{see where}} <b>we</b> <b>are.</b> First of all, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> ourselves--which is the refrain of all my chants. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> ourselves. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> living {{individuals}}. And as living individuals <b>we</b> <b>are</b> the one, pure clue to our own cosmos. To which cosmos living individuals {{have always been the}} clue, since time began, and will always be the clue, while time lasts.|$|R
5|$|There {{was this}} {{absolute}} scorching deal on cases of PBR and kegs. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> {{one of the}} few outlets in Portland that sold kegs to go, so we could sell them at a really good deal. So we started the PBR dollar-can special. I'd say it was around 1997 or 1998. At one point, I know they said <b>we</b> <b>were</b> the largest distributor of Pabst in the state, if not the country. We got written up in The New York Times about it. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> going through hundreds of cases and dozens of kegs a week.|$|E
5|$|Yeah, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> {{over the}} moon. We don't play ourselves, {{because most people}} won't know who we are, but they'll look like yellow {{versions}} of ourselves. We play counsellors at an arts camp that Lisa's going to. It's pretty fun. We just went to a studio and recorded it, but, yeah, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> really flattered.|$|E
5|$|I think, {{and this}} is now with some {{distance}} in listening to the records, but {{on the outside looking}} in with all earnestness I think Soundgarden made the best records out of that scene. I think <b>we</b> <b>were</b> the most daring and experimental and genre-pushing really and I'm really proud of it. And I guess that's why I have trepidation about the idea of re-forming. I don't know what it would mean, or I guess I just have this image of who <b>we</b> <b>were</b> and I had probably a lot of anxiety during the period of being Soundgarden, as we all did, that it was responsibility and it was an important band and music and we didn't want to mess it up and we managed to not, which I feel is a great achievement.|$|E
25|$|Let {{the nation}} know {{the meaning of}} our numbers. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> not a {{pressure}} group. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> not an organization. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> not a mob. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> the advance guard of a massive moral revolution that is not confined to the Negro, nor is it confined to civil rights, for our white allies know that they are not free while <b>we</b> <b>are</b> not.|$|R

5|$|On Canada's Top Albums/CDs chart {{conducted}} by RPM, the record debuted at number 76 {{during the week}} of February 23, 1974. The Way <b>We</b> <b>Were</b> peaked at number three on March 30 and spent another week at that same position on April 6. It dropped to number nine the succeeding week and spent a total of twenty-three weeks in that country, with its final position being number 91 {{during the week of}} August 3.
