5|$|Civil war {{occurred}} in the Byzantine Empire, often <b>with</b> <b>Arab</b> support. With the support of Caliph Al-Ma'mun, Arabs {{under the leadership of}} Thomas the Slav invaded, so that within a matter of months, only two themata in Asia Minor remained loyal to Emperor Michael II. When the Arabs captured Thessalonica, the Empire's second largest city, it was quickly re-captured by the Byzantines. Thomas's 821 siege of Constantinople did not get past the city walls, and he was forced to retreat.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the Six Day War, Israel {{held the}} entire Sinai peninsula, with the {{exception}} of Port Fouad. Israel's victory in the Six Day War brought about a sense of security within Israel; the occupied territory added strategic depth to the country's defense. Consequently, Israel and Egypt ignored United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 242, which called for withdrawal from occupied territories in return for Arab recognition, and negotiations between the countries ceased. Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir aimed {{to maintain the status quo}} and believed that her country's military strength would secure peace <b>with</b> <b>Arab</b> nations on their terms. Egypt, on the other hand, refused to recognize Israel or even negotiate with directly, preferring talks via third parties.|$|E
5|$|Mizrahi cuisine, {{the cuisine}} of Jews from North Africa, {{features}} grilled meats, sweet and savory puff pastries, rice dishes, stuffed vegetables, pita breads and salads, and shares many similarities <b>with</b> <b>Arab</b> cuisine. Other North African dishes popular in Israel include couscous, shakshouka, matbucha, carrot salad and chraime (slices of fish cooked in a spicy tomato sauce). Sephardic dishes, with Balkan and Turkish influences incorporated in Israeli cuisine include burekas, yogurt and taramosalata. Yemenite Jewish foods include jachnun, malawach, skhug and kubane. Iraqi dishes popular in Israel include amba, {{various types of}} kubba, stuffed vegetables (mhasha), kebab, sambusac, sabich and pickled vegetables (hamutzim).|$|E

It {{may also have}} been recorded by the Anasazi as a petroglyph. This explosion appeared in the constellation of Taurus, where it produced the Crab Nebula remnant. At its peak, the luminosity of SN 1054 may have been four times as bright as Venus, and it remained visible in daylight for 23 days and was visible in the night sky for 653 days.|$|E
5|$|The {{composite}} bow {{was adopted}} throughout the Arab world, {{even though some}} Bedu tribesmen in the Hijaz retained the use of simple self bows. Persian designs were used after the conquest of the Sassanid Empire, and Turkish-type bows were widely used after the Turkic expansions. Roughly speaking, Arabs favoured slightly shorter siyahs and broader limbs than the Indo-Persian designs. Sometimes the protective cover on the back was painted <b>with</b> <b>Arab</b> calligraphy or geometric patterns. No design was standardized over the vast area of the Arab conquests. It was said that the best Arab composite bows were manufactured in Damascus, Syria.|$|E
5|$|The main factor which boosted {{industry}} and trade under the Ayyubids {{was the new}} interests Europeans developed when they {{came into contact with}} the Muslims. Commodities included incense, scents, fragrant oils, and aromatic plants from Arabia and India, as well as ginger, alum, and aloes. Likewise, Europeans developed new tastes in the matter of fashions, clothing, and home furnishing. Rugs, carpets, and tapestries manufactured in the Middle East and Central Asia were introduced to the West through Crusader-Ayyubid interaction. Christian pilgrims visiting Jerusalem returned <b>with</b> <b>Arab</b> reliquaries for the keeping of relics. In addition, eastern works of art in glass, pottery, gold, silver, etc., were highly prized in Europe.|$|E

5|$|When Abdul Hamid II {{was overthrown}} during the Young Turk Revolution in 1908, 'Ata lost his favor {{from the central}} {{authorities}} because of his closeness with the deposed sultan and criticized the revolutionary officers. Consequently, the al-Bakri family realigned itself <b>with</b> <b>Arab</b> nationalists in Syria who opposed the increased Turkish nationalist efforts in the Arabic-speaking territories of the empire. 'Ata had also developed close ties with the Hashemites of the Hejaz. In 1909 he hosted the Sharif of Mecca, Hussein bin Ali, his brother Nasir, and Abdullah, Sharif Hussein's son, in his Damascus home.|$|E
5|$|Malagasy cuisine {{encompasses}} the many diverse culinary {{traditions of the}} Indian Ocean island of Madagascar. Foods eaten in Madagascar reflect the influence of Southeast Asian, African, Indian, Chinese and European migrants that have settled on the island since it was first populated by seafarers from Borneo between 100 CE and 500 CE. Rice, {{the cornerstone of the}} Malagasy diet, was cultivated alongside tubers and other Southeast Asian staples by these earliest settlers. Their diet was supplemented by foraging and hunting wild game, which contributed to the extinction of the island's bird and mammal megafauna. These food sources were later complemented by beef in the form of zebu introduced into Madagascar by East African migrants arriving around 1,000CE. Trade <b>with</b> <b>Arab</b> and Indian merchants and European transatlantic traders further enriched the island's culinary traditions by introducing a wealth of new fruits, vegetables, and seasonings.|$|E
5|$|The Welsh crosses {{well with}} many other breeds, and has {{influenced}} the Pony of the Americas and the British Riding Pony. Many are also cross-bred with Thoroughbreds, and other horse breeds. The Welsh Pony {{has contributed to the}} founding of several other horse and pony breeds. The Morgan horse is one such breed, being in part descended from Welsh Cobs left behind by British forces {{after the end of the}} American Revolutionary War. They are crossed <b>with</b> <b>Arab</b> horses to produce riding horses, and with Thoroughbreds to produce jumpers, hunters, and eventers. Welsh mares have also been used to breed polo ponies that were agile and nimble. The Welsh Pony was used to create the Welara, a cross-breed of the Welsh and the Arab horse, which has been registered in America as a separate breed since 1981.|$|E

5|$|Tahir's {{unexpected}} {{victory was}} decisive: al-Ma'mun's position was secured, while his main opponents, the abnaʾ, lost men, prestige and their most dynamic leader. Tahir now advanced westwards, defeated another abnaʾ army of 20,000 under Abd al-Rahman ibn Jabala {{after a series}} of hard-fought engagements near Hamadan, and reached Hulwan by winter. Al-Amin now desperately tried to bolster his forces by alliances <b>with</b> <b>Arab</b> tribes, notably the Banu Shayban of Jazira and the Banu Qays of Syria. The veteran Abd al-Malik ibn Salih was sent to Syria to mobilize its troops along with Ali ibn Isa's son, Husayn. However, al-Amin's efforts failed due to the long-standing intertribal divisions between Qaysis and Kalbis, the Syrians' reluctance {{to get involved in the}} civil war, as well as the unwillingness of the abnaʾ to cooperate with the Arab tribes and to make political concessions to them. These failed efforts to secure Arab tribal support backfired on al-Amin, as the abnaʾ began to doubt whether their interests were best served by him. In March 812, Husayn ibn Ali led a short-lived coup against al-Amin in Baghdad, proclaiming al-Ma'mun as the rightful Caliph, until a counter-coup, led by other factions within the abnaʾ, restored al-Amin to the throne. Fadl ibn al-Rabi, however, one of the main instigators of the war, concluded that al-Amin's case was lost and resigned from his court offices. At about the same time, al-Ma'mun was officially proclaimed caliph, while Fadl ibn Sahl acquired the unique title of Dhu 'l-Ri'asatayn ("he of the two headships"), signifying his control over both civil and military administration.|$|E
5|$|The Arab {{army was}} well-provisioned, <b>with</b> <b>Arab</b> {{accounts}} reporting high mounds of supplies {{piled up in}} their camp, and had even brought along wheat to sow and harvest the next year. The failure of the Arab navy to blockade the city, however, meant that the Byzantines too could ferry in provisions. In addition, the Arab army had already devastated the Thracian countryside during its march and could not rely on it for foraging. The Arab fleet and the second Arab army, which operated in the Asian suburbs of Constantinople, were able to bring in limited supplies to Maslama's army. As the siege drew into winter, negotiations opened between the two sides, extensively reported by Arab sources but ignored by Byzantine historians. According to the Arab accounts, Leo continued to play a double game with the Arabs. One version claims that he tricked Maslama into handing over most of his grain supplies, while another claims that the Arab general was persuaded to burn them altogether, so as to show {{the inhabitants of the}} city that they faced an imminent assault and induce them to surrender. The winter of 718 was extremely harsh; snow covered the ground for over three months. As the supplies in the Arab camp ran out, a terrible famine broke out: the soldiers ate their horses, camels, and other livestock, and the bark, leaves and roots of trees. They swept the snow of the fields they had sown to eat the green shoots, and reportedly resorted to cannibalism and eating their own excrement. Consequently, the Arab army was ravaged by epidemics; with great exaggeration, the Lombard historian Paul the Deacon put the number of their dead of hunger and disease at 300,000.|$|E

In the early 1970s, the National Association of Arab-Americans was formed to negate the stereotypes commonly associated <b>with</b> <b>Arabs</b> in American media. Syrian Americans were also part of the Arab American Institute, established in 1985, which supports and promotes Arab American candidates, or candidates commiserative <b>with</b> <b>Arabs</b> and Arab Americans, for office.
