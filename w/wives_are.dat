5|$|In {{the farming}} village Nakanogō, {{on the shore}} of Lake Biwa in Ōmi Province in the late 16th century, Genjurō, a potter, takes his wares to nearby Ōmizo. He is {{accompanied}} by Tōbei, who dreams of becoming a samurai. A respected sage tells Genjurō's wife Miyagi to warn her husband about seeking profit in times of upheaval, and to prepare for a probable attack on the village. Genjurō arrives with wide profits, but she asks him to stop. Genjurō nevertheless works long hours to finish his pottery. That night, Shibata Katsuie's army sweeps through Nakanogō, and Genjurō, Tōbei and their <b>wives</b> <b>are</b> uprooted. Genjurō collects his pottery from the kiln, and decides to take the pots to a different marketplace. As the two couples travel across a lake, a boat appears from thick fog. The sole passenger tells them he was attacked by pirates, warns them back to their homes, then dies. The two men decide to return their wives to the shore. Tōbei's wife Ohama refuses to go. Miyagi begs Genjurō not to leave her, but is left on the shore with their young son, Gen'ichi, clasped to her back. At market, Genjurō's pottery sells well. After taking his promised share of the profits, Tōbei runs off to buy samurai armor, and sneaks into the ranks of a clan of samurai. Lost from her companions, Ohama has wandered beyond Nagahama in her desperate search for Tōbei. She is raped by a group of soldiers.|$|E

25|$|Husbands and <b>wives</b> <b>are</b> not {{presumed to}} be in a {{fiduciary}} relationship; however, this may be easily established.

25|$|In many polytheistic religions, {{there are}} both gods and goddesses clearly defined. This {{includes}} many pagan religions, {{such as those}} involving Greek mythology, Norse mythology, and Celtic mythology. This distinction also exists in other polytheisms. For example, Hinduism distinguishes between God and Goddess. There are three main male gods known as Tridev (Sanskrit:त्रिदेव) and their <b>wives</b> <b>are</b> worshiped as goddesses. In Hindu mythology, all the forces converge to form a female supreme power known as aadishakti (Sanskrit: आदिशक्ति.).|$|E
25|$|The FLDS Church {{teaches the}} {{doctrine}} of plural marriage, which states that a man having multiple wives is ordained of and a commandment by God; the doctrine requires it {{in order for a}} man to receive the highest form of salvation.

Connected with this doctrine is patriarchal doctrine, the belief that <b>wives</b> <b>are</b> required to be subordinate to their husbands.|$|E

25|$|No {{taller than}} a human finger, fairy spae <b>wives</b> <b>are</b> usually dressed in the clothes of a peasant.

25|$|Finally, most of {{the temple}} {{decoration}} {{is the work of}} local Theban artists. This is evidenced by the dominant artistic style of the temple which represents people with large lips and eyes and thin bodies. At the opposite, the refined chapels of Mentuhotep II's <b>wives</b> <b>are</b> certainly due to Memphite craftsmen who were heavily influenced by the standards and conventions of the Old Kingdom. This phenomenon of fragmentation of the artistic styles is observed throughout the First Intermediate Period and is a direct consequence of the political fragmentation of the country.|$|E
25|$|The Ten Commandments {{were meant}} {{exclusively}} for Jewish males. Michael Coogan noticed {{that according to}} their text, the <b>wives</b> <b>are</b> the property of their man, marriage meaning transfer of property (from father to husband), and women are less valuable than real estate, being mentioned after real estate. Adultery is violating the property right of a man. Coogan's book was criticized by Phyllis Trible because of not noticing that patriarchy was not decreed, but only described by God, patriarchy being specific to people after the fall. She admits that Paul the Apostle made the same mistake as Coogan.|$|E
