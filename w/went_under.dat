5|$|In the 1919 season, the {{franchise}} {{was named the}} Buffalo Prospects, and finished with a 9–1–1 in the NYPFL. As a result, they won the New York Championship. After the 1919 season, the Prospects <b>went</b> <b>under</b> new management, and the name was changed to the All-Americans. Tommy Hughitt became the coach, and several players from the 1919 squad left. Of the 33 players on the 1919 team, only Barney Lepper and Tommy Hughitt remained on the team for the 1920 season.|$|E
5|$|Just {{before her}} death, Oliver had been shortlisted for the 2006 Clemenger Contemporary Art Award. In the year following, Oliver was amongst 60 artists {{profiled}} in Sonia Payes' book Untitled: Portraits of Australian Artists, while in 2008 her final works {{were included in}} the Adelaide Biennale of Australian Art. The secondary art market, meanwhile, was returning six-figure sums for her works at auction; in 2007 a record for Oliver's work was set when Skein (2004) <b>went</b> <b>under</b> the hammer for $192,000. By 2010, Sydney Biennale chairman Luca Belgiorno-Nettis was reported to have paid $300,000 for one of Oliver's sculptures, titled Tracery. In 2011, Sydney's College of Fine Arts announced that its new sculpture studio would be named after Oliver.|$|E

5|$|The New York City & Northern Railroad (later the Putnam Division of the New York Central Railroad) {{was built}} in 1880, {{effectively}} separating the park site into two parts. Its two stops in the Bronx were in the park itself, and at Kingsbridge to the south; after Kingsbridge, the railroad merged with the present-day Hudson Line of the Metro-North Railroad. The line had two tracks between the Hudson Line junction and the Van Cortlandt station, north of which the tracks merged into one. The company foreclosed in 1887, and the line <b>went</b> <b>under</b> {{the control of the}} New York and Northern Railroad Company.|$|E
5|$|On the August 29, 2008 {{episode of}} SmackDown, Brianna debuted as Brie Bella and {{defeated}} Victoria. She quickly began a scripted rivalry with Victoria and Victoria's accomplice, Natalya, {{and had a}} series of matches against them. In each match, Brie would roll out of the ring and go underneath it, emerging and appearing revived, and then win the match. On the October 31 episode of SmackDown, when Brie <b>went</b> <b>under</b> the ring Victoria grabbed her legs, but a second pair of legs kicked her off, implying that a second person was under the ring. The following week on SmackDown, Brie picked up a win against Victoria and then ran under the ring to escape Natalya and Victoria, but Victoria and Natalya both reached for Brie under the ring, resulting in both Nicole and Brie being pulled out. The twins then attacked them and celebrated afterward. Nicole was then introduced as Nikki Bella. The twins had their first official match as a team on the November 21 episode of SmackDown, defeating Victoria and Natalya. They continued competing in tag team matches over the following months.|$|E
5|$|Once the Confederates {{had crossed}} the river, the Alice Dean was set ablaze and sunk in the river between Morvin's landing and Mauckport to deny the Union pursuers use of the vessel and to block the landing, making their {{crossing}} more difficult. Morgan ordered the McCombs to be burnt, but Col. Duke countermanded the order because of his friendship with its captain. He was allowed to return with his ship to Louisville unharmed. Gen. Hobson and {{the main body of}} the Union cavalry arrived in Brandenburg at about 10:15 pm, just as the Alice Dean <b>went</b> <b>under</b> the water. He set up his artillery and fired several shots at the Confederates who jeered at him from the opposite side of the river; they quickly withdrew out of range of his guns. The lead elements of the cavalry had already set out northward following the Legion forces who withdrew gradually and fought delaying skirmishes along the Mauckport road to slow the cavalry's advance towards Corydon.|$|E

5|$|Strangeways Brewery {{was founded}} in 1778 by two grain merchants, Thomas Caister and Thomas Fry, just north {{of what is now}} Manchester city centre. Their {{principal}} customers were the cotton workers of Manchester, then a burgeoning mill town. Henry Boddington, born in 1813 in Thame, Oxfordshire, joined the brewery in 1832 as a travelling salesman when the brewery was in the possession of Hole, Potter and Harrison. Like most Manchester breweries at the time, it was a modestly sized operation. Boddington had become a partner by 1848, alongside John and James Harrison, and by this time the company <b>went</b> <b>under</b> the name John Harrison & Co. In January 1853, Boddington borrowed money to become its sole owner. Between Boddington's takeover until 1877, the brewery's output increased tenfold from 10,000 to 100,000 barrels a year, making it not only Manchester's largest brewery but {{one of the largest in}} the North of England, with over 100 tied houses. By 1883 Henry Boddington & Co. was a limited liability company. Henry Boddington's estate was valued at almost £150,000 when he died in 1886.|$|E
5|$|The Elementary Education Act 1880 {{insisted on}} {{compulsory}} attendance from 5–10 years. For poorer families, ensuring their children attended school proved difficult, {{as it was}} more tempting to send them working if the opportunity to earn an extra income was available. Attendance Officers often visited the homes of children who failed to attend school, which often proved to be ineffective. Children {{under the age of}} 13 who were employed were required to have a certificate to show they had reached the educational standard; employers of these children who weren't able to show this were penalised. An act brought into force thirteen years later <b>went</b> <b>under</b> the name of the Elementary Education (School Attendance) Act 1893, which stated a raised minimum leaving age to 11. Later the same year, the act was also extended for blind and deaf children, who previously had no means of an official education. This act was later amended in 1899 to raise the school leaving age up to 12 years of age.|$|E
5|$|The {{kingdom of}} Wessex, which {{eventually}} laid claim to England as a whole, evolved a centralised royal administration. One {{part of this}} was the king's council, the witenagemot, comprising the senior clergy, ealdormen, {{and some of the}} more important thegns; the council met to advise the king on policy and legal issues. The royal household included officials, thegns and a secretariat of clergy which travelled with the king, conducting the affairs of government as it <b>went.</b> <b>Under</b> the Danish kings, a bodyguard of housecarls also accompanied the court. At a regional level, ealdormen played an important part in government, defence and taxation, and the post of sheriff emerged in the 10th century, administering local shires on behalf of an ealdorman. Anglo-Saxon mints were tightly controlled by the kings, providing a high quality currency, and the whole country was taxed using a system called hidage.|$|E
