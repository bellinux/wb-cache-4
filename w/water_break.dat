60|$|There is {{no doubt}} that well-constructed steamers are safer craft, the danger from fire excepted, than the {{ordinary}} ship, except in very heavy weather. With an ordinary gale, they can contend with sufficient power; but, it is an unfortunate consequence of their construction, that exactly as the danger increases, their power of meeting it diminishes. In a very heavy swell, one cannot venture to resort to a strong head of steam, since one wheel may be nearly out of water, while the other is submerged, and thus endanger the machinery. Now, the great length of these vessels renders it difficult to keep them up to the wind, or head to sea, the safest of all positions for a vessel in heavy weather, while it exposes them to the additional risk of having the <b>water</b> <b>break</b> aboard them near the waist, in running dead before it. In a word, I suppose a steamer difficult to be kept out of the trough, in very heavy weather; and no vessel can be safe in the trough of the seas, under such circumstances; one of great length less so than others. This is true, however, only in reference to those steamers which carry the old-fashioned wheel; Erricson's screw, and Hunter's submerged wheels, rendering steam-ships, in my poor judgment, the safest craft in the world.|$|E

50|$|One {{important}} {{property of}} mechanical waves {{is that their}} amplitudes are measured in an unusual way, displacement divided by (reduced) wavelength. When this gets comparable to unity, significant nonlinear effects such as harmonic generation may occur, and, if large enough, may result in chaotic effects. For example, waves {{on the surface of}} a body of <b>water</b> <b>break</b> when this dimensionless amplitude exceeds 1, resulting in a foam on the surface and turbulent mixing.

50|$|On 2 January 2014, Sui {{transferred}} to China League One side Chongqing Lifan. He {{became the first}} choice goalkeeper on the third matchday after Chongqing lost the first two matches of the season, helping the club to win a 27-match unbeaten run and promoted to Chinese Super League. Especially, Sui set a new China League One record for consecutive clean sheets with 796 minutes on 2 August 2014, beating the previous record of 732 minutes set by Yu Ziqian of Dalian Aerbin in the 2011 season. On 8 March 2015, Sui made his Super League debut in the season's first match which Chongqing Lifan lost to Beijing Guoan 3-0. On 24 May 2015, in a Super League match against Liaoning Whowin, he left his goal unguarded to take a <b>water</b> <b>break</b> after Chongqing Lifan conceded a free kick. Liaoning's Ding Haifeng took the free kick quickly and scored the equalizer as Sui was still drinking water next to the goal post. He was fined ¥50,000 by the club but kept his position as a main player. He played 28 league matches for the club in the 2015 season, as Chongqing Lifan secured {{to stay in the}} top flight for the next season.

40|$|Abstract—Simultaneous {{microwave}} and video measurements of shallow <b>water</b> <b>breaking</b> waves are presented. A {{comparison of the}} data from the two sensors shows that short-duration spikes in the measured X-band radar cross section are highly correlated with the presence of breaking waves in the video imagery. In addition, the radar backscatter from shallow <b>water</b> <b>breaking</b> events is responsible for 40 % to 50 % of the total cross section, which is a much larger contribution than typically observed for deepwater breaking events. Based on estimates of the area of individual breaking regions determined from digitized video images, the radar cross section per unit area of the turbulent breaking region is shown to be well approximated by a value of 1. 9 dB at 31 grazing. Finally, there are some differences between the radar and video signals that suggest that microwave radar may be less sensitive than video techniques to relict foam not associated with active wave breaking. In general, the results indicate that radar is a very good detector of shallow <b>water</b> <b>breaking</b> waves and suggest that radar can be used for the measurement of the spatial and temporal variations of wave breaking.
