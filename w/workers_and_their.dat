5|$|By 1801 the {{population}} of the Minster-in-Sheppey parish, which included both Sheerness and the neighbouring town of Minster, reached 5,561. In 1816, one of the UK's first co-operative societies was started in Sheerness, chiefly to serve the dockyard <b>workers</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> families. The Sheerness Economical Society began as a co-operative bakery but expanded to produce and sell a range of goods. By the middle of the 20th century, the society had spread across the Isle of Sheppey and had been renamed the Sheerness and District Cooperative Society.|$|E
5|$|Foreign {{domestic}} <b>workers</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> supporters, including {{activists and}} employers, have periodically staged rallies protesting {{what they perceive}} as discriminatory treatment {{on the part of the}} Hong Kong government. Grievances include discrimination, the minimum wage and the two-week stay limit at the end of a domestic worker's employment contract. According to the Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor (HKHRM), foreign domestic helpers face discrimination from the Hong Kong government and their employers.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the skilled}} workers {{employed}} at the Hartford City Glass Company were from Belgium, {{at the time}} the world’s leading manufacturer of window glass. The Belgian <b>workers</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> families accounted for over one-third of Hartford City's population during the 1890s, and lived on the city's south side. Because {{of the importance of the}} French-speaking Belgians, one of the local newspapers featured articles in French.|$|E

5|$|Workers' {{children}} {{overwhelmed the}} village school. It {{had been built}} by the township copyholders and freeholders on Eastgate in 1790. There were originally 30 children but their number increased fourfold, and with a grant of £100 from the railway company the school building was enlarged to accommodate them. The <b>workers</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> families used St Ronan's Methodist Chapel in Bramhope and the Methodist Chapel at Pool-in-Wharfedale. The Leeds Mission spread bibles and tracts to families {{who lived in the}} bothies.|$|E
5|$|But {{the event}} could not mask the {{economic}} crisis into which Poland was drifting, exacerbated by Soviet demands for more military spending. Although the system of fixed, artificially low food prices kept urban discontent under control, it caused further economic strain. In the long run the situation was unsustainable, and on 12 December 1970 (just before Christmas), the regime suddenly announced massive increases in the prices of basic foodstuffs, the government's main source of hard currency when exported. The new measures were incomprehensible to many urban <b>workers,</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> provocative timing (the most intense food purchase period for most Polish families) led to strong social reaction and ultimately Gomułka's fall from power.|$|E
5|$|The Chagos Islands are {{a cluster}} of 60 islands and seven atolls in the Indian Ocean. First {{occupied}} by lepers from Mauritius, France acquired the islands in the late 18th century, and slaves were brought in from Africa and India to maintain coconut plantations placed there. Following Napoleon's defeat in 1814, the islands were ceded to the British in the Treaty of Paris, who administered them as a dependency of the Colony of Mauritius. Although the slaves were given their freedom in 1835, many remained on the Chagos Islands as contract <b>workers,</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> descendants and later immigrants are considered the indigenous people - the Chagossians.|$|E

5|$|The Social Hall, {{also known}} as the Officers' Club, was a social club located on the northwestern side of the island. Located in {{proximity}} to the Power House, water tower and Former Military Chapel (Bachelor Quarters), it formerly housed the post exchange. The club was a social venue for the Federal Penitentiary <b>workers</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> families on the island to unwind after a hard week's work dealing with America's most hardened criminals after they'd been locked up at 17:30. It was burned down by Native Americans during the Occupation of Alcatraz in 1970, leaving a shell which still remains.|$|E
5|$|The {{village of}} Blue Water {{was built to}} house <b>workers</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> {{families}} in Chemical Valley during the construction of Polymer Corporation {{and at one point}} had nearly 3,000 residents. In 1961, all the residents were relocated, mostly to the North End, to make way for expansion of the chemical industry. The village was demolished, and all that remains now is an historical marker at the corner of Vidal Street and Huron Avenue. This neighbourhood was largely forgotten until historian Lorraine Williams penned two books about it and was instrumental in the dedication of the plaque.|$|E
5|$|On 13 December 1981, {{claiming}} {{that the country was}} on the verge of economic and civil breakdown, and alleging a danger of Soviet intervention, General Wojciech Jaruzelski began a crack-down on Solidarity. Martial law was declared, the free labor union was suspended and most of its leaders detained. Several thousand citizens were interned or imprisoned and much larger numbers were subjected to various forms of harassment. Polish state militia (Milicja Obywatelska, the police) and paramilitary riot police ZOMO suppressed the strike action and demonstrations. Military forces entered industrial enterprises to clamp down on the independent union movement. A series of violent attacks included the pacification of Wujek Coal Mine during which 9 people were killed. The martial law offensive was directed primarily against <b>workers</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> Union; they, rather than intelligentsia activists, were the object of the most brutal treatment. The authorities succeeded in imposing on members of Solidarity an individual and collective trauma, from which the broken mass movement would not be able to recover. The Catholic Church strove to exert on Solidarity a moderating influence both before and after the martial law.|$|E

50|$|Instead of {{just looking}} at {{expectancy}} and instrumentality, W.F. Maloney and J.M. McFillen found that expectancy theory could explain the motivation of those individuals who were employed by the construction industry. For instance, they used <b>worker</b> expectancy <b>and</b> <b>worker</b> instrumentality. Worker expectancy is when supervisors create an equal match between the <b>worker</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> job. <b>Worker</b> instrumentality is when an employee knows that any increase in their performance leads to achieving their goal.|$|R
40|$|Within the {{construction}} industry, {{it is increasingly}} being acknowledged that knowledge management can bring about the much needed innovation and improved performance the industry requires. Nevertheless, sufficient attention is still to be received for {{the concept of the}} knowledge <b>worker</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> tacit knowledge within construction industry. Yet, proper understanding and management of this resource is of immense importance for the achievement of better organisational performance. Hence, this paper aims to devise a theoretical framework for managing construction knowledge <b>worker</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> tacit knowledge based on review and synthesis of literature. Paper stresses the importance of construction knowledge <b>worker</b> <b>and</b> tacit knowledge through review of literature and highlights prevailing gap due to lack of attention and recognition given to the tacit knowledge in {{the construction}} industry. Based on identified gap research aim, objectives and hypotheses are devised. As the specific research methodology, the social constructionism stance in terms of epistemological undertakings and idealistic approach under the ontological assumptions with value laden purposes are suggested. Further, it recommends the deployment of multiple exploratory case studies approach with triangulation techniques...|$|R

25|$|D. maculata is {{characterized}} by low paternity, worker reproduction and queen-worker conflict. Divergent genetic interests between <b>workers</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> queen cause intra-nest struggle for control, which disrupts social organization. Because of haplodiploidy, workers are unable to mate. However, their unfertilized eggs become males. <b>Workers</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> queens are most related to their own sons. Natural selection will therefore favor those workers who produce their own sons rather than rearing the queen’s brood. In a sampling of seven D. maculata nests, 20.9% of males were produced by workers. The percentage of males who were worker’s sons did not correlate with the time during which nests were collected or colony size.|$|E
