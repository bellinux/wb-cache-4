This universal expansion was predicted from general relativity by Alexander Friedmann in 1922 and Georges Lemaître in 1927, well before Hubble made his 1929 analysis and observations, and it remains {{the cornerstone of the}} Big Bang theory as developed by Friedmann, Lemaître, Robertson, and Walker.|$|E
500|$|I {{remember}} {{not just}} because it was a win, but also because it was a big fight right into the last night. Fabrizia reminded me the other night that we had a problem with the brake pads, so we lost a lot of time. We finished three days rallying (with one day to go), night and day, 32 seconds in front of Ari Vatanen. We drove the last special stage for the night, came back to the hotel and I could not sleep at all, four hours {{in front of me and}} no sleep. Then I arrive at the special stage, it's about 42km long, and I look at Fabrizia and I said [...] "OK, we forget everything, and <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> first stage of the rally again, because one of us will crash." [...] And so Ari hit a rock, and we won the rally.|$|E

[...] On November 14, 2008—following Obama's election—Beck appeared on Bill O'Reilly's show The O'Reilly Factor and said that [...] "we are {{at the place where}} the Constitution hangs in the balance, I feel the Constitution is hanging in the balance right now, hanging by a thread unless the good Americans wake up." [...] Earlier in November, while interviewing U.S. Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah (also a Mormon), Beck remarked: [...] "I heard Barack Obama talk about the Constitution and I thought, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> point or we are very near the point where our Constitution is hanging by a thread." [...] Hatch appeared on Beck's Fox News show in January 2009, and Beck prompted him by declaring [...] "I believe our Constitution hangs by a thread." ...|$|E

500|$|In late 2010, TV Tonight {{reported}} that Neighbours would reduce crew operations in 2011 so production could be upgraded. The changes {{meant that the}} location manager and catering team were no longer required, studio shoots would be reduced from three cameras to two, and location shots will be mainly confined to the Ramsay Street and Lassiter's complex sets, with occasional filming in one-off places. Of the changes, FremantleMedia said [...] "Neighbours is undergoing a work flow upgrade to accommodate advances in technology and production techniques to ensure <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> forefront of professionalism and efficiency." [...] They added that the show's production model had been in place since 1985 {{and that it was}} time to evolve it. On 14 March 2011, The Australian {{reported that}} Neighbours has become the first television show available to watch on a free iPhone application. Viewers are able to watch whole episodes within three hours of them airing on Eleven. Nick Spooner, the head of Ten digital media said [...] "This is part of what we call our 'three-screen approach' – broadcast, online and mobile – and it is intended to build viewer engagement with a show and our brand. This is a way for us to stay in touch with our audience and to keep them coming back." [...] To celebrate the wedding of Prince William of Wales and Kate Middleton, Neighbours filmed a specially commissioned scene for the UK episode airing on the same day as the wedding. The episode, which had already aired in Australia, marked the first time an Australian show recorded extra scenes for a UK broadcaster.|$|E

The {{extraordinary}} contributions {{of this one}} man to the lifestyle we call surfing are almost impossible to gauge. They're too broad, too all-encompassing. Thomas Edward Blake's initials are {{at the root of}} so many innovations and influences as almost to be taken for granted. A dozen or so men might have eventually done everything Blake did singularly. Even a partial list of his accomplishments is overwhelming. His greatest contribution was a life - our life. Tom Blake didn't just surf, but made a life of surfing. And while the great Duke nobly represented a spiritual tie to his ancient Hawaiian sport, it was Blake who provided the modern mode for all who came after. And now here <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of the century - a century of surfing he shaped more than anyone - we still look like him, we still dress like him, we still surf like him." ...|$|E
