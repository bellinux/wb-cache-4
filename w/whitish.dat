5|$|Adult non-breeding plumage is {{brownish}} {{with a dark}} {{neck and}} head marked with dark grey-brown. The eyes are surrounded with white, and the eyelids are pale. The bill is mostly pale grey, with a dark culmen and tip, but in early spring the tip may turn <b>whitish.</b> The underparts, lower face, chin, and throat are also <b>whitish.</b> The foreneck is <b>whitish,</b> usually forming wedge-shaped notch in dark neck-sides, and may sometimes reveal a shadowy trace of the neck ring or a pale collar. It has dark brownish grey upperparts with an unclear pattern of squares on the shoulders and some wing coverts spotted with white, which are usually concealed while swimming. The male and the female have similar appearances, although they exhibit sexual dimorphism in their physical dimensions with the male larger and significantly heavier than the female.|$|E
5|$|Santa Maria {{goldcrest}} R. r. sanctaemariae (Vaurie, 1954). Found only on Santa Maria Island (Azores); it is paler {{than other}} Azores subspecies and <b>whitish</b> below.|$|E
5|$|A. m. croceum: Orange dorsal {{color on}} tail {{breaking}} into patches along black body and into tiny dots on head, often absent anterior to eyes. Sides have <b>whitish</b> flecks. Number of costal grooves equals 13.|$|E
5|$|Boletus reticulatus is {{very similar}} to B.aereus, also {{occurring}} during the summer months under broad-leaved trees. It has a paler, often cracked cap and a usually paler stipe covered in a more elaborate and pronounced <b>whitish</b> reticulation, often extending to the stipe base.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius xanthogalactus {{has nearly}} {{identical}} microscopic features to L.vinaceorufescens, but macroscopically, {{it does not}} have the reddish-vinaceous stains that develop on the cap, gills, and stem of L.vinaceorufescens, and it grows on the ground under oak. Another lookalike is L.colorascens, but it may be distinguished from L.vinaceorufescens by several features: a smaller fruit body; a <b>whitish</b> cap that becomes brownish red with age and does not spot vinaceous or brown; bitter to faintly acrid latex; and slightly smaller spores. L.chrysorrheus is also similar, but it has a <b>whitish</b> to pale yellowish-cinnamon cap with slightly darker spots and grows under hardwoods (especially oak) on well-drained, often sandy soil, and its gills do not discolor or spot vinaceous or brown.|$|E
5|$|P.semilanceata {{has also}} been {{confused}} with the toxic muscarine-containing species Inocybe geophylla, a <b>whitish</b> mushroom with a silky cap, yellowish-brown to pale grayish gills, and a dull yellowish-brown spore print.|$|E
5|$|Similar in appearance, all treecreepers {{are small}} birds with {{streaked}} and spotted brown upperparts, rufous rumps and <b>whitish</b> underparts. They have long decurved bills, and long rigid tail feathers that provide support as they creep up tree trunks looking for insects.|$|E
5|$|The fruitbodies (ascocarps) of Geopyxis carbonaris are cup shaped, 1–2cm wide, {{and have}} fringed <b>whitish</b> margins. The inner spore-bearing {{surface of the}} cup, the hymenium, is brick red and smooth, while the {{exterior}} surface is a dull yellow, and may be either smooth or have blister-like spots (pustules). The stipe is small (1–1.5mm long and 1–2mm wide), <b>whitish</b> in color, and expands abruptly into the cup. The brownish flesh of the fungus is thin and brittle. It {{does not have any}} distinctive taste, but has an unpleasant smell when crushed in water. The edibility of the fungus is not known, but the fruitbodies are insubstantial and unlikely to be harvested for eating.|$|E
5|$|The lichen has a {{distinct}} prothallus—fibers of <b>whitish</b> fungal hyphae at the edge that lack photobiont, and which project beyond the thallus onto the growing surface. The prothallus is red to <b>whitish</b> in the inner part, red the in outer part. The surface of the thallus {{does not have a}} well-defined cortex, an outer layer of well-packed hyphae. The medulla (a loosely arranged layer of hyphae below the cortex and photobiont zone) is <b>whitish</b> but the lower part is red. It has few to many calcium oxalate crystals that are 3–8μm diameter. The hyphae of the medulla have many such crystals on the walls, that are 1–2μm in diameter. The algal photobiont (technically a phycobiont, as it is a green algal photosynthetic partner) is from the genus Trentepohlia. Normally, the algae is long and filamentous; when in the lichen state, it is divided into shorter filaments. The alga has a large chloroplast that contains droplets of beta-carotene. The lichen is heteromerous, meaning that the mycobiont and photobiont components are in well-defined layers, with the photobiont in a more or less distinct zone between the upper cortex and the medulla. Cells are single or a few cells aggregated, with dimensions of about 8–15 by 5–11μm.|$|E
5|$|They found mines {{with the}} <b>whitish</b> metal nuggets {{and took them}} home to Spain. Antonio de Ulloa {{returned}} to Spain and established the first mineralogy lab in Spain {{and was the first}} to systematically study platinum, which was in 1748.|$|E
5|$|Young {{southern}} boobooks {{are usually}} paler than adults, {{and do not}} attain adult plumage properly until their third or fourth year. Juveniles (up to a year old) have <b>whitish</b> underparts and foreneck, a larger and more prominent pale eyebrow and larger <b>whitish</b> spots on their upperparts. The tips of their feathers are white and fluffy, remnants of the nestlings' down. These are worn away over time, persisting longest on the head. The feathers of the head, neck and underparts are fluffier overall. Immatures in their second and third year have plumage more like adults, though their crowns are paler and more heavily streaked.|$|E
5|$|Both species lay 3–5 {{normally}} <b>whitish</b> eggs blotched {{with brown}} or grey, which are incubated by the female alone. The chicks hatch after {{two to three}} weeks. Red-billed chough chicks are almost naked, but the chicks of the higher altitude Alpine chough hatch with a dense covering of natal down. The chicks are fed by both parents and fledge in 29–31 days after hatching for Alpine chough, and 31–41days for red-billed.|$|E
5|$|Geastrum welwitschii {{also has}} similar {{morphological}} characters to G.minimum in having small fruit bodies, <b>whitish</b> spore sacs, and fibrillose peristomes. However G.welwitschii is differentiated from G.minimum by its fornicate, mostly 3–6, {{rays of the}} exoperidia, and the mycelial layer that easily loosens from the fibrous layer to form a mycelial cup. G.welwitschii is distinguished from G.entomophilum by its dark and sessile endoperidium, and smaller spores (2.8–3.5μm).|$|E
5|$|Hindfoot {{length is}} 37mm (1.5in). The upper {{sides of the}} feet are covered with grayish white fur, which extends around the claws to form ungual tufts. On the hindfeet, the fifth digit is {{relatively}} short at 6mm (0.2in); the hallux (first digit) is 8mm (0.3in) long, and the other digits 11 to 12mm (0.4 to 0.5in). The tail is 238mm (9.4in) long and naked in part. At the base, it is dark brown both above and below, but slightly lighter below. The upper side remains dark brown for much of its length, though the color does become lighter towards the tip. The lower side becomes mottled at about 55mm (2.2in) from the tip and then <b>whitish</b> at about 65mm (2.6in). It has a well-developed tuft at its tail tip, consisting of <b>whitish</b> and occasional light brown hairs. This tuft commences at about 130mm (5.1in) from the base with fairly short hairs and becomes more pronounced at 180mm (7.1in). In contrast, the greater big-footed mouse has a weaker, dark brown tuft.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, a safe was {{discovered}} during excavations of a burial trench at the Hanford nuclear site. Inside the safe were various items, including a large glass bottle containing a <b>whitish</b> slurry which was subsequently {{identified as the}} oldest sample of weapons-grade plutonium known to exist. Isotope analysis by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory indicated that the plutonium in the bottle was manufactured in the X-10 Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge during 1944.|$|E
5|$|Krypton's {{multiple}} emission lines make ionized krypton gas discharges appear <b>whitish,</b> {{which in}} turn makes krypton-based bulbs useful in photography as a brilliant white light source. Krypton is used in some photographic flashes for high speed photography. Krypton gas is also combined with other gases to make luminous signs that glow with a bright greenish-yellow light.|$|E
5|$|M. s. melanotus, {{known as}} the black-backed fairywren, was {{described}} by John Gould in 1841 as a separate species. It {{is found in the}} mallee country of South Australia (Sedan area north-east of Adelaide) through western Victoria, western New South Wales and into south western Queensland. It differs from the nominate subspecies in having a black back and <b>whitish</b> lower belly.|$|E
5|$|Marbled newts {{owe their}} name to their green–black, marbled colour pattern. In females, an orange-red line runs down back and tail. The crest of male marbled newts is smaller and fleshier {{than that of}} the crested newts and not indented, but marbled newt males also have a <b>whitish</b> tail band at {{breeding}} time.|$|E
5|$|Moult {{is poorly}} recorded, the only records coming from Sakhalin and Himachal Pradesh. In Sakhalin, moult occurs in August and September, between the {{breeding}} season and migration. In Himachal Pradesh, aviculturalist G. A. Perreau observed captive and wild birds {{and reported that}} they were yellow from December to spring and <b>whitish</b> during the remainder of the year, a pattern which may be atypical.|$|E
5|$|Mycena granulifera, {{a species}} {{originally}} described from Brazil, {{is comparable to}} M.nidificata in having inamyloid spores, club-shaped cheilocystidia with finger-like outgrowths, and diverticulate cap cuticle hyphae. M.granulifera differs in forming a <b>whitish,</b> wrinkled cap and club-shaped to roughly spindle-shaped pleurocystidia. Mycena nidificata also bears some resemblance to the European species M.flos-nivium, which is distinguished by having cylindrical, amyloid spores, gills without veins between them, and an absence of cord-like rhizomorphs.|$|E
5|$|P. c. capitalis {{is found}} in the {{southern}} Rocky Mountains from eastern Idaho, south-central Montana, and western and southern Wyoming south through eastern Utah, and western and central Colorado, to east-central Arizona and north-central New Mexico. American naturalist Spencer Fullerton Baird described this subspecies in 1873. It has a wholly <b>whitish</b> head with a pale band {{on the back of the}} neck, and overall more ashy grey plumage. It is also generally larger than the nominate subspecies canadensis.|$|E
5|$|Russula brevipes was {{initially}} described by American mycologist Charles Horton Peck in 1890, from specimens collected in Quogue, New York. It is {{classified in the}} subsection Lactaroideae, a grouping of similar Russula species characterized by having <b>whitish</b> to pale yellow fruit bodies, compact and hard flesh, abundant lamellulae (short gills), {{and the absence of}} clamp connections. Other related Russula species with a similar range of spore ornamentation heights include Russula delica, R.romagnesiana, and R.pseudodelica.|$|E
5|$|The nest, {{built from}} plant {{material}} and unlined, is placed among dense vegetation or {{in a tree}} hole. The typical clutch is around ten <b>whitish</b> eggs. The breeding adults, which pair for life, take turns to incubate, and the eggs hatch in 24–29 days. The downy grey ducklings leave the nest {{within a day or}} so of hatching, but the parents continue to protect them until they fledge around nine weeks later.|$|E
5|$|There {{are a few}} greenish Stropharia {{with which}} S.caerulea might be confused. Stropharia pseudocyanea is an {{uncommon}} species that grows in meadows. It has a more slender form than S.caerulea, a soft, spongy stipe, and flesh with an odour similar to fresh pepper. Microscopically, it has a dense palisade of slender, capitate (with a spherical tip) non-staining cheilocystidia on the gill edge. This gives the gills of young, fresh fruit bodies a <b>whitish</b> edge, a feature that is absent from S.caerulea. Another lookalike, S.aeruginosa, is less common than S.caerulea. It is distinguished from the latter by the well-developed ring zone on its stipe, darker gills with white edges, and more numerous <b>whitish</b> scales around the cap margin. Additionally, S.aeruginosa has more stable colours than S.caerulea, the colouration of which tends to quickly wash out. However, collections of Stropharia often show characteristics that are intermediate between two or more species, making them difficult to identify accurately.|$|E
5|$|Tremella mesenterica {{may also}} be {{confused}} {{with members of the}} Dacrymycetaceae family, like Dacrymyces chrysospermus (formerly D.palmatus), due to their superficial resemblance. Microscopic examination shows that the Dacrymycetaceae have Y-shaped basidia with two spores, unlike the longitudinally split basidia characteristic of Tremella; additionally, D.chrysospermus is smaller, has a <b>whitish</b> attachment point to its substrate, and grows on conifer wood.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the genus}} Entoloma, the fungus is {{classified}} in the subgenus Leptonia, section Cyanula because of its overall habit, clampless hyphae, and abundant granules of pigment. Noordeloos and Gates place it in the stirps (a grouping of related species within a genus) Austroprunicolor, characterized by mushrooms with a violaceous pink or blue cap that contrasts with a pallid, <b>whitish,</b> polished stipe.|$|E
5|$|American {{paddlefish}} are smooth-skinned {{and almost}} entirely cartilaginous. Their eyes {{are small and}} directed laterally. They have a large, tapering operculum flap, a large mouth, and a flat, paddle-shaped rostrum that measures approximately one-third of their body length. During {{the initial stages of}} development from embryo to hatchling, American paddlefish have no rostrum. It begins to form shortly after hatching. The rostrum is an extension of the cranium, not of the upper and lower jaws or olfactory system as with the long snouts of other fishes. Other distinguishing characteristics include a deeply forked heterocercal caudal fin and dull coloration, often with mottling, ranging from bluish gray to black dorsally grading to a <b>whitish</b> underbelly.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{external}} appearance, Plectania nannfeldtii {{is similar to}} Pseudoplectania vogesiaca. Although this latter species {{may be difficult to}} distinguish by its less hairy external fruit body surface, its microscopic characters identify it more definitively: P.vogesiaca has spores that are much smaller, typically with widths of 12–14µm. Helvella corium is another black cup fungus that appears in the spring; it has smaller spores, <b>whitish</b> margins on the cup edges, and shorter stems than P.nannfeldtii. Pseudoplectania nigrella is smaller, with a hairier outer surface, a darker inner cup surface, and a rudimentary stem.|$|E
5|$|Calcium oxalate is {{a common}} {{crystalline}} compound found in many fungi, including the earthstars. The presence of calcium oxalate crystals—apparent as a <b>whitish</b> powder {{on the surface of}} the spore sac—has been verified for G.pectinatum using scanning electron microscopy. The calcium oxalate crystals occur in the tetragonal form, known as weddellite. A study on the related species Geastrum saccatum has shown that these crystals are responsible for the characteristic opening (dehiscence) of the outer peridial layers. The formation of calcium oxalate crystals stretches the layers of the outer walls, pushing apart the inner and outer layers of the peridium.|$|E
5|$|Chicks hatch within 24 {{hours of}} each other. Six days after hatching, the chicks' eyes have opened and after eight days they {{are covered in}} <b>whitish</b> down. Chicks defecate outside of the nest by raising their tail {{to the side of}} the nest, so nests with older chicks are {{surrounded}} by faecal matter. Both parents feed and brood the chicks, taking it in turns. When one parent returns with food, it takes over brooding duties while the other leaves to hunt.|$|E
5|$|Confusion {{with the}} highly {{regarded}} miller or sweetbread mushroom (Clitopilus prunulus) {{is a common}} cause of poisoning in France; the latter fungus has a greyish-white downy cap and <b>whitish</b> decurrent gills which turn pink with maturity. Young fruit bodies of Entoloma sinuatum can also be confused with St George's mushroom (Calocybe gambosa), although the gills of the latter are crowded and cream in colour, and the clouded agaric (Clitocybe nebularis), which has <b>whitish</b> decurrent gills and an unusual odour. To complicate matters, it often grows near these edible species. Its overall size and shape resemble members of the genus Tricholoma, although the spore colour (white in Tricholoma, pinkish in Entoloma) and shape (angular in Entoloma) help distinguish it. The rare and edible all-white dovelike tricholoma (T.columbetta) has a satiny cap and stem and a faint, not mealy, odour. E.sinuatum may be confused with Clitocybe multiceps in the Pacific Northwest of North America, although the latter has white spores and generally grows in clumps. A casual observer may mistake it for an edible field mushroom (Agaricus campestris), but this species has a ring on the stipe, pink gills that become chocolate-brown in maturity, and a dark brown spore print. The poorly known North American species E. albidum resembles E.sinuatum but is likewise poisonous.|$|E
5|$|In 1915, Walter Sydney Adams, using a 60-inch (1.5m) {{reflector}} at Mount Wilson Observatory, {{observed the}} spectrum of Sirius B and determined {{that it was a}} faint <b>whitish</b> star. This led astronomers to conclude that it was a white dwarf, the second to be discovered. The diameter of Sirius A was first measured by Robert Hanbury Brown and Richard Q. Twiss in 1959 at Jodrell Bank using their stellar intensity interferometer. In 2005, using the Hubble Space Telescope, astronomers determined that Sirius B has nearly the diameter of the Earth, , with a mass 102% of the Sun's.|$|E
5|$|In North America, Tricholoma pardinum can be {{confused}} with T.nigrum and forms of T.virgatum that have more streaked rather than spotted caps. A form of T.pardinum in North America can be nearly white with pale scales, and may {{be confused}} with the <b>whitish</b> edible species T.resplendens. Microscopically, the presence of clamp connections sets T.pardinum apart from most other members of the genus, although the similar-looking (though more tan-coloured) T.venenatum also has them. According to Alexander H. Smith, T.huronense is closely related, but can be distinguished from T.pardinum by its narrower gills, its tendency to form drops of reddish liquid on the gills and stalk, and an ash-grey and scaly stalk surface.|$|E
5|$|In mass, {{the spores}} are <b>whitish.</b> The spores are elliptical, smooth, hyaline, devoid of oil {{droplets}} (eguttulate), and have dimensions of 13–18 by 7–9µm. They are thin walled and germinate and grow rapidly in vitro {{in the absence}} of external stimuli. The asci are 190–225 by 9–10µm. The paraphyses are slightly club-shaped, unbranched, and have irregular orange-brown granules, with tips up to 5µm wide, and are not forked or lobed. The hypothecium, the layer of cells below the hymenium, is made of densely packed, small irregular cells.|$|E
5|$|Kalapuya brunnea is {{a species}} of truffle in the {{monotypic}} fungal genus Kalapuya. The truffle occurs only in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States, in western Oregon and northern California. Known locally as the Oregon brown truffle, it was formerly thought to be an undescribed species of Leucangium until molecular analysis demonstrated that it was distinct from that genus. The truffle is reddish brown with a rough and warty outer skin, while the interior spore-producing gleba is initially <b>whitish</b> before developing greyish-brown mottling as it matures. Mature truffles have an odor resembling garlicky cheese, similar to mature Camembert. The species has been harvested for culinary purposes in Oregon.|$|E
5|$|Lactifluus piperatus (synonym Lactarius piperatus), {{commonly}} known as the peppery milk-cap, is a semi-edible basidiomycete fungus of the genus Lactifluus. Despite being edible, it is not recommended by some because of its poor taste, though can be used as seasoning when dried. The fruiting body is a creamy-white mushroom which is funnel-shaped when mature, with exceptionally crowded gills. It bleeds a <b>whitish</b> peppery-tasting milk when cut. Widely distributed across Europe and eastern North America, Lactifluus piperatus has been accidentally introduced to Australia. Mycorrhizal, it forms a symbiotic relationship with various species of deciduous tree, including beech, and hazel, and fruiting bodies are found on the forest floor in deciduous woodland.|$|E
