25|$|Most Estonians {{greeted the}} Germans with {{relatively}} open arms and hoped for restoration of independence. In Southern Estonia pro-independence administrations were set up, led by Jüri Uluots, and a co-ordinating council {{was set up}} in Tartu as soon as the Soviet regime retreated and before German troops arrived. The Forest Brothers who drove the Red Army from Tartu made this possible. This <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>for</b> nothing since the Germans disbanded the provisional government and Estonia became a part of the German-occupied Reichskommissariat Ostland.

25|$|With the reopening of the theatres in 1660 {{after the}} Puritan ban, Dryden began writing plays. His first play The Wild Gallant {{appeared}} in 1663, {{and was not}} successful, but was still promising, and from 1668 on he was contracted to produce three plays {{a year for the}} King's Company in which he became a shareholder. During the 1660s and 1670s, theatrical writing was his main source of income. He led the way in Restoration comedy, his best-known work being Marriage à la Mode (1673), as well as heroic tragedy and regular tragedy, in which his greatest success <b>was</b> <b>All</b> <b>for</b> Love (1678). Dryden was never satisfied with his theatrical writings and frequently suggested that his talents were wasted on unworthy audiences. He thus was making a bid for poetic fame off-stage. In 1667, around the same time his dramatic career began, he published Annus Mirabilis, a lengthy historical poem which described the English defeat of the Dutch naval fleet and the Great Fire of London in 1666. It was a modern epic in pentameter quatrains that established him as the preeminent poet of his generation, and was crucial in his attaining the posts of Poet Laureate (1668) and historiographer royal (1670).|$|E
25|$|In November 1940, {{during the}} visit of the Soviet Foreign Commissar Vyacheslav Molotov to Berlin, Ribbentrop tried {{hard to get the}} Soviet Union to sign the Tripartite Pact. Ribbentrop argued that the Soviets and Germans shared a common enemy {{in the form of the}} British Empire, and as such, it was in the best {{interests}} of the Kremlin to enter the war on the Axis side. He proposed that, after the defeat of Britain, they could carve up the territory in the following way: the Soviet Union would have India and the Middle East, Italy the Mediterranean area, Japan the British possessions in the Far East (presuming of course that Japan would enter the war), and Germany would take central Africa and Britain. Molotov was open to the idea of the Soviet Union entering the war on the Axis side, but demanded as the price of entry into the war that Germany recognise Finland, Bulgaria, Romania, Turkey, Hungary and Yugoslavia as within the exclusive Soviet sphere of influence. Ribbentrop's efforts to persuade Molotov to abandon his demands about Europe as the price of a Soviet alliance with Germany were entirely unsuccessful. After Molotov left Berlin, the Soviet Union indicated that it wished to sign the Tripartite Pact and enter the war on the Axis side. Though Ribbentrop <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>for</b> taking Stalin's offer, Hitler by this point had decided that he wanted to attack the Soviet Union. The German–Soviet Axis talks led nowhere.|$|E

When the {{producers}} called him in for a third audition, Johnson informed them that if they wanted him then they would bring him in for a screen-test. After the screen-test, Johnson was cast and spent only one day filming his scenes for the pilot. The producers, along with Johnson, wanted to portray Whitney as {{more than just the}} [...] "stereotypical jock" [...] that he could have easily become, {{in an effort to make}} sure Lana did not look stupid for going out with him. Whitney was given multiple storylines in season one in an effort to get audiences to view the character in a more pleasant light, but Kristin Kreuk feels that it <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>for</b> naught, as the audience only sees him through Clark's eyes.|$|E
500|$|Since {{its first}} appearance, Captain Scarlet has been criticised for its filming, {{which has been}} {{considered}} too static due {{to the problem of}} moving the Supermarionation puppets convincingly. The return to a 25-minute episode format, as had been the case with series preceding Thunderbirds, has been blamed for a perceived drop in quality of storytelling and a lack of subplots. Concerns have also been raised about the development of the characters: in a 1986 interview, script editor Tony Barwick described Captain Scarlet as [...] "hard-nosed stuff" [...] that lacked humour, stating, [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>for</b> the American market and to that extent there was no deep characterisation. [...] all balanced one against the other." [...] To Jeff Evans, writer of The Penguin TV Companion, it is [...] "more detailed"; he explains: [...] "The agents were given private lives and real identities, and were furnished with other biographical data." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2009, the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences {{announced}} {{the retirement of}} the award category. President and CEO Neil Portnow stated that the Academy needed {{to do so in}} order to remain a [...] "relevant and responsive" [...] organization within a [...] "dynamic music community". Polka musicians and fans were disappointed with the category elimination. Three-time award winner Walter Ostanek admitted he [...] " [...] sorry for the future artists" [...] that would fail to be recognized by the Academy. Carl Finch of the group Brave Combo stated the following: [...] "Having a polka category was the most important step to legitimacy that we could ever hope to achieve. To have that taken away, it's like it <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>for</b> nothing." [...] Apart from ensuring that the [...] "awards process remains representative of the current musical landscape", the Academy cited dwindling competition as one reason for the category retirement. Others speculated that Jimmy Sturr's eighteen wins led to the elimination. Due to the elimination of a polka-specific category, polka musicians are likely to submit recordings in the folk and world music categories.|$|E

The differences between Stockwell and Beaufre were summarized by the American historian Derek Varble as: [...] "Stockwell favored existing plans; their methodical construction and underlying staff work reduced risks. Beaufre, by contrast an opportunist, saw plans merely a means to an end, without much inherent value. For him, altered circumstances or assumptions provided adequate justification to jettison part or all of the original plan".|$|E

She personally funded the construction and operation of the Nadia Comăneci Children's Clinic in Bucharest that provides low-cost and free medical and social support to Romanian children. In 2003, the Romanian government appointed her as an honorary consul general of Romania to the United States to deal with bilateral relations between the two nations. In addition, both Comăneci and Conner are involved with The Special Olympics. One of the public methods Comăneci used to raise funds for the Special Olympics in 2008 was to participate in [...] Donald Trump's reality show, [...] Prior to the airing of the season, Trump announced {{that it was going to}} be the [...] "nastiest version that we've done" [...] and [...] "a very vicious show" [...] because of the unusual combination of celebrities who were each competing to raise money for a favorite charity. Comăneci was a member of [...] "The Empresario" [...] team (all women), which lost to [...] "The Hydra" [...] team (all men) in the second episode.

2500|$|In {{support of}} a harder line both in the war and on the home front, Chamberlain {{involved}} himself in the intrigues to oust Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg as Chancellor and replace him with the [...] "hard man", Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz. In Chamberlain's opinion, if only Germany were to wage the war more ruthlessly and brutally, then the war would be won. Chamberlain loathed Bethmann-Hollweg whom he saw as an inept leader who simply {{did not have the}} will to win. Chamberlain had an unbounded confidence in the ability of the Army and Navy to win the war, but on the home front, Chamberlain believed the Reich was [...] "leaderless" [...] as he viewed Bethmann-Hollweg as a Jewish [...] "puppet" [...] unwilling and unable to stop defeatism, corruption or the demand for more democracy. Besides supporting Tirptiz as Chancellor, Chamberlain <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>for</b> adopting unrestricted submarine warfare-even at the risk of provoking the United States into the war-as the best way of starving Britain into surrender. Chamberlain was also a very public supporter of Zeppelin raids to destroy British cities. After a discussion with his friend and admirer, Count [...] Ferdinand von Zeppelin, Chamberlain published a newspaper essay in July 1915 complaining that the government had imposed far too much restrictions on Zeppelin raids to save innocent British lives, and he argued that his country should bomb British cities with no concern for lives of civilians as ordinary British people deserved to die.|$|E
2500|$|Scheduled for {{a release}} date of November 1998, the premiere issue was rescheduled for March 1999, to {{coincide}} with the creation of a trade paperback, , to help promote the new series. Collecting several of the character's printed appearances, Batman: Anarky was released in February 1999. However, the release date for the second volume was then pushed back again to May. An unintended result of this constant rescheduling was the effect it had on Grant's efforts to plot early story lines for the series. Due to increasing time constraints for the approaching millennium, it prevented Grant from exploring potential plots involving the Y2K bug he discussed with Breyfogle. Grant also reported that the series was dogged by editorial restrictions, including demands that he include cameos for particular characters, or [...] "tone down" [...] the degree of philosophy of the series. One of the earliest of these editorial mandates was that Grant was ordered to completely rewrite the first three-issue story line, and remove Anarky from Gotham City in the first issue. This was achieved by explaining that following an [...] Lonnie's parents disappear, their house is destroyed, and he is threatened by Batman to leave the city. [...] As one of many refugees who escapes from No Man's Land, he relocates to a new base of operations beneath the Washington Monument. Extremely displeased with the forced approach in creating this justification, Grant later said, [...] "Reading over that I was not so happy with the way I’d written that because it didn’t make sense to me at the time and it doesn’t make sense now." [...] These constant impositions on the part of editors nearly drove Grant to quit the series, but he continued the project for Breyfogle's benefit.
