25|$|Cazalet {{started his}} career as a jockey in {{point-to-point}} racing. He came second on Beau Geste at the North Cotswold Hunt in April 1929. In 1930, he moved up to National Hunt racing. He rode Rocquefort II at Haydock Park in December of that year. At this time, Cazalet was building a stable of steeplechasers at Fairlawne. They were trained by Harry Whiteman. Cazalet gave Elizabeth Taylor instruction in horse-riding <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>girl.</b>|$|E
25|$|Her {{focus on}} {{teaching}} left her {{little time for}} research, she did not pursue a master's degree or a doctorate. She {{was responsible for the}} laboratory training of her students, many of whom came up to College with little or no knowledge of chemistry. Amongst her students she was thought to be an inspirational teacher and a singular character. She had lost a leg in a cycling accident <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>girl</b> and used variously walking sticks, a prosthetic leg and a three-wheeled tricycle wheelchair worked with her arms. Her disability and unconventional style of dress made her a distinctive figure which was much remarked upon at the time by colleagues and contemporaries.|$|E
25|$|Home Life of Great Authors, {{published}} in Chicago, in 1877, included descriptive sketches of many authors, with glimpses {{of their home}} life and personal and domestic character: Goethe, Wordsworth, Lamb, Shelley, Emerson, George Sand, Tennyson, Whittier, Robert and Elizabeth B. Browning, Poe, Eliot, Burns, De Quincey, North, Irving, Carlyle, Macaulay, Hawthorne, Holmes, Charlotte Bronte, Thackeray, Kingsley, Madame de Stael, Scott, Lord Byron, Bryant, Hugo, Lytton, Longfellow, Lowell, Margaret Fuller, Dickens, and Ruskin. As its title would indicate, the book aimed to give a more personal and intimate view {{of men and women}} well-known to fame than was to be found in most reference works. The young readers of this volume learned that dates and statistics do not enable them to know people; they need to have some personal details as to the habits and daily lives of the people about whom they read. Griswold said in one of her works that as she had had such a hard time <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>girl</b> getting any picture in her mind of the great people about whom she read, that she determined {{to make it easier for}} other boys and girls to obtain these mental pictures; that is why she wrote The Home Life of Great Authors.|$|E
