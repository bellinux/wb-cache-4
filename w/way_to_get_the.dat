25|$|At this time, Allied {{forces were}} working {{to push the}} Ottoman Troops back from the Canal and deep into the desert. To get their {{supplies}} in, {{it was decided that}} a railway would be built by the engineers. There was however a slight problem. There was no <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> locomotives needed onto these rails. The Bridging Train was therefore tasked with building new wharves to unload the locomotives that would be needed for the desert trains, which they did by converting two small vessels into floating pile drivers.|$|E

25|$|Walking {{for normal}} able bodied {{children}} is {{a lot different than}} walking for below-knee-amputees. Walking is less fluid and symmetrical for the children who are amputees. Research was conducted in order to find the best <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> amputee children to develop a more symmetrical and fluid walking form like normal able bodied children. Because {{of the results of the}} study which showed that the normal bodied children can withstand a lot more external loading than the amputees, researchers are now looking into the manufacturing and design of the prosthetics that these amputees use. Potentially, they could come up a new idea or a model that can improve the walking capabilities of these amputee children.|$|E

Furthermore, Bischoff would have a one-hour head start on McMahon due to Nitro going on the air live at 8 PM, which would have been more than enough time to announce Hart's WCW arrival.

Verity believed his performances in unfavourable conditions for his bowling had greater merit than his successes in favourable ones. He once said: [...] "Do not praise me when I have taken 8 for 20 on a sticky wicket, but when I have got 2 for 100 on a perfect wicket."

[...] While they plan their attack, The Evil Thing's babies hatch and tries to eat the victims. Luckily, Sean and Cassie make it in time.
