500|$|The filmmakers {{decided not}} to {{replicate}} the X-Men costumes {{as seen in the}} comic book. Stan Lee and Chris Claremont supported this decision. Claremont joked, [...] "you can do that on a drawing, but when you put it on people it's disturbing!" [...] Producer/co-writer Tom DeSanto had been supportive of using the blue and yellow color scheme of the comics, but came to conclude that they would not work onscreen. To acknowledge the fan complaints, Singer added Cyclops' line [...] "What <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>prefer,</b> yellow spandex?" [...] – when Wolverine complains about wearing their uniforms – during filming. Singer noted that durable black leather made more sense for the X-Men to wear as protective clothing, and Shuler Donner added that the costumes helped them [...] "blend into the night".|$|E

2500|$|The {{negotiations}} {{for the land}} for the new cricket ground took place between de Mello and the then Bombay governor Lord Brabourne. De Mello used the name of Antonio Piedade da Cruz, an artist from Goa who was painting Lord Brabourne at the time, {{in order to obtain}} a meeting. The popular story goes that before returning {{at the end of the}} meeting, de Mello asked Lord Brabourne : 'Your excellency, which <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>prefer</b> to accept from sportsmen, money for your Government, or immortality for yourself?'. Brabourne chose immortality and the CCI was allotted 90,000 square yards at a price of [...] 13.50 per square yard from land reclaimed in the Backbay reclamation scheme. Messrs. Gregson, Batley and King were appointed the architects of the facility and Shapoorji Pallonji & Co. were awarded the contract for construction. The intention of the ground design was such that it be the Lord's of India.|$|E

6000|$|... "Would {{you rather}} {{go back to}} our mermaid home for a time and rest yourselves or <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>prefer</b> to start for Giant's Cave at once?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. <b>Would</b> <b>you</b> <b>prefer</b> to sit there? We {{can carry}} out this little table, and put the lamp on it. There is just room for three chairs." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I'd {{much rather}} keep it; {{but we had}} better be frank. <b>You</b> <b>would</b> <b>prefer</b> that Allinson didn't find the lode?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Poor Will! No; {{it is not}} Will. It is Frederic Aylmer. I think <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>prefer</b> him as a {{son-in-law}} even to {{my cousin}} Will." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{would be}} ungallant {{to assume that}} <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>prefer</b> it," [...] said M. de Vilmorin, with a glance at mademoiselle. [...] "Nor do I think it <b>would</b> serve. If <b>you</b> will wait..." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let me recommend," [...] he said, {{studying}} the menu {{for a moment}} with his horn-rimmed eyeglass, [...] "an artichoke with sauce mayonnaise, or <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>prefer</b> asparagus?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Will you {{sit down}} here, my dear,' the Progenitor was saying to Hilda at the exact moment he entered, 'or <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>prefer</b> your back to the fire?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{would be}} the best thing you could do, Julian, but, of course, there is no hurry about it. What part of the country <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>prefer</b> to settle in?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, madame, to Jamaica; but if <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>prefer</b> to be {{landed at}} Cape François or Port-au-Prince I shall {{be happy to}} give you a passage back again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps," [...] {{suggested}} Mr. Wentworth, delicately, [...] "perhaps <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>prefer</b> {{to go to}} {{some one}} else. I can give you any number of addresses, if you like." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But, candidly, Miss Reed, don't {{you think}} that <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>prefer</b> to have old Hannibal, whom you know, as county judge, than a {{stranger}} and a Northern man like ME?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, then," [...] said she, {{picking up}} the pebbles. [...] "I'm {{wondering}} whether I shall have fish-balls or lamb-chops to complete my meal. Which <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>prefer,</b> Woot the Wanderer?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good! Hee-haw! Excellent!" [...] cried Kik-a-bray, much pleased. [...] "You shall {{all have}} fine suppers and good beds. What food <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>prefer,</b> a bran mash or ripe oats in the shell?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "There {{are several}} rooms {{exactly in the}} {{locality}} you asked for," [...] he remarked, [...] "which are simply being held over. If <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>prefer</b> 317, <b>you</b> can have it, and I will give 217 to our other client." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is not necessary," [...] the Professor answered. [...] "You {{can enter}} me," [...] he added, {{as he held}} {{open the door for}} her, [...] "as a friend--or <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>prefer</b> a pseudonym?" ...|$|E
