5|$|Portrait of Monsieur Bertin is an 1832 oil-on-canvas {{painting}} by Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres. It depicts Louis-François Bertin (1766–1841), the French writer, art collector {{and director of}} the pro-royalist Journal des débats. Ingres completed the portrait during his first period of success; having achieved acclaim as a history painter, he accepted portrait commissions with reluctance, regarding them as a distraction from more important work. Bertin was a friend and a politically active member of the French upper-middle class. Ingres presents him as a personification of the commercially minded leaders of the liberal reign of Louis Philippe I. He is physically imposing and self-assured, but his real-life personality shines through– warm, <b>wry</b> and engaging to those who had earned his trust.|$|E

5|$|As he {{continues}} his investigations, Craven is visited by Emma's ghost. The fingerprints on the getaway car used by Emma's killer match that of Lowe, a man Craven arrested ten years previously. Meanwhile, Pendleton takes Craven {{to meet his}} colleague, Harcourt (Ian McNeice), who informs him that Emma {{was a member of}} a subversive anti-nuclear group called GAIA. A team of six GAIA members, led by Emma, had broken into a low level radioactive waste facility at Northmoor; all are now either dead or missing. After Craven makes a televised appeal for information about Emma's killer, he is contacted by CIA agent Darius Jedburgh (Joe Don Baker), an associate of Harcourt and Pendleton. Jedburgh shows Craven the CIA's file on Emma's activities: GAIA had become suspicious of Northmoor when a nearby reservoir had become contaminated with radioactive material, an occurrence that had also alerted the CIA, leading them to believe Northmoor was illegally storing plutonium. Jedburgh is played as a hard-bitten professional with a <b>wry</b> sense of humour and a passion for ballroom dancing. Along with Harcourt and Pendleton, he is keen to find the source and purpose of the plutonium.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps no American neo-noirs better {{reflect the}} classic noir A-movie-with-a-B-movie-soul {{than those of}} director-writer Quentin Tarantino; neo-noirs of his such as Reservoir Dogs (1992) and Pulp Fiction (1994) display a relentlessly self-reflexive, {{sometimes}} tongue-in-cheek sensibility, similar {{to the work of}} the New Wave directors and the Coens. Other films from the era readily identifiable as neo-noir (some retro, some more au courant) include director John Dahl's Kill Me Again (1989), Red Rock West (1992), The Last Seduction (1993), as well as Gus van Sant's To Die For (1995), and Andrew Davis's A Perfect Murder (1998); four adaptations of novels by Jim Thompson—The Kill-Off (1989), After Dark, My Sweet (1990), The Grifters (1990), and the remake of The Getaway (1994); and many more, including adaptations of the work of other major noir fiction writers: The Hot Spot (1990), from Hell Hath No Fury, by Charles Williams; Miami Blues (1990), from the novel by Charles Willeford; and Out of Sight (1998), from the novel by Elmore Leonard. Several films by director-writer David Mamet involve noir elements: House of Games (1987), Homicide (1991), The Spanish Prisoner (1997), and Heist (2001). On television, Remington Steele (1982–87) and Moonlighting (1985–89) paid homage to classic noir while demonstrating an unusual appreciation of the sense of humor often found in the original cycle. Between 1983 and 1989, Mickey Spillane's hardboiled private eye Mike Hammer was played with <b>wry</b> gusto by Stacy Keach in a series and several stand-alone television films (an unsuccessful revival followed in 1997–98). The British miniseries The Singing Detective (1986), written by Dennis Potter, {{tells the story of a}} mystery writer named Philip Marlow; widely considered one of the finest neo-noirs in any medium, some critics rank it among the greatest television productions of all time.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY: The {{utilization}} of the underground space for <b>wrying</b> out human activities goes far back into antiquity. A review of underground space major uses over time is given and pros and cons relating to the huge increase in tunnelling are listed. The impact on groundwater resources is estimated. And sigdcant variations in the aquifer regulation and storage capacity volume, hy&ulic conductivity and transmissivity, water flow and energy velocity are discussed. 1. UTILIZATION OF THE UNDERGROUND SPACE OVER TIME The {{utilization of}} the underground space for canying out human activities goes far back into antiquity, the earliest tunnels being caverns and man-made cave dwellings and galleries. Far fiom exhaustively and systematically reviewing all possible uses of the underground space over time, this article illustrates a few representative and poorly known cases. The multi-millennia history {{of the use of}} sub-surface cavities started out in the Neolithic age when the underground space served as hiding place to man. The underground chambers of Agrigento, the ancient Greek city of Acragas, were a major hydraulic engineering achievement. Fully excavated within the rock and designed for water collection (Amone, 1991; Polemio, 1995) they date back, according to Arnone, to as early as 480 BC. Thi...|$|R

Three practiced observers were used with each display. Sixty readings per observer, per target, per display were obtained. I t is suggested that f o r the targets most different in size f rom the background discs, the distributions of times t o locate are largely dependent on response time factors; and for the targets closest in size the distributions are largely dependent on search factors. Some support is lent t o theoretical work that suggests search times are exponentially distributed. The shortest time required to locate a particular target is used as an estimate of response time. Response times {{are found to be}} inversely proportional to both the difference between the log of the target and nontarget disc diameters, and t o the difference between the diameters. A n amendment, taking response time into account, is suggested for exponential search equations...|$|R

But out of Paradise our first parents were driven long ago, as anon I was to be from mine. For, as the Maid passed, I doffed my cap and waved it, since to shout [...] "Noel" [...] with the rest, I dared not, because of my infirmity. Now, it so fell that, glancing around, she saw and knew me, and bowed to me, with a gesture of her hand, as queenly as if she, a manant's child, had been a daughter of France. At that moment, noting the Maid's courtesy towards me, Charlotte stood up from beside me, {{with a handful of}} red roses, which she threw towards her. As it chanced, belike because she was proud to be with one whom the Maid honoured, or to steady herself as she threw, she laid her left hand about my neck, and so standing, cast her flowers, and then looked laughing back into my eyes, with a happy face. The roses missed the Maid, whose horse caracoled at that moment as she went by, but they lit in the lap of a damsel that rode at her rein, on a lyart {28} palfrey, and she looking up, I saw the face of Elliot, and Elliot saw me, and saw Charlotte leaning on me and laughing. Then Elliot's face grew deadly pale, her lower lip stiff, as when she was angered with me at Chinon, and so, <b>wrying</b> her neck suddenly to the left, she rode on her way, nor ever looked towards us again.|$|R
40|$|William Wordsworth wrote A Guide Through the District of the Lakes {{under the}} {{influence}} of a cultural movement which had stemmed from he picturesque aesthetics initiated by William Gilpin and others. It is evident that this work is in the tradition of a guidebook because the author is loyal to its conventions which Gilpin and Thomas West, another picturesque advocate and famous guidebook writer, formulated. But Guide is unique In a certain deviation from the tradition, and that is where the author goes beyond the picturesque aesthetics and thus Wordsworth, the poet and present-day <b>wrier,</b> emerges. In the historical description of the landscape of the Lake District, the author blamed late settlers for inadequate management of the area which led to deterioration of the landscape, and articulated the social shift to the machine-based production system which too had begotten its decline. Then he made some modification proposals as well as the plan for fashioning this region into national property, so Guide is also the book of accusation and improvement. The pivotal question is what enabled him to state these things. Wordsworth did not perceive landscape as the picturesque school had done and recommended. They view nature as a picture, which allows people to see selectively, while he views it as it is, including the changing aspects of the landscape even if they are unappealing. And by applying this visual mode in the work itself, Wordsworth tried to convert the taste or the value system of his contemporaries from aesthetical to environmental, and this intent is substantially the same as the one expressed in Lyrical Ballads, where the poet aimed to displace the readers' traditional ideas of poetry and poetics. Lastly, Guide could be regarded as the call to protect the environment, which is unquestionably of paramount concern to us today...|$|R
