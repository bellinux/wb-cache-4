5|$|Divine command theory (also {{known as}} {{theological}} voluntarism) is a meta-ethical theory which proposes that an action's status as morally good {{is equivalent to}} whether it is commanded by God. The theory asserts that what is moral is determined by <b>what</b> <b>God</b> commands, and that {{for a person to}} be moral is to follow his commands. Followers of both monotheistic and polytheistic religions in ancient and modern times have often accepted the importance of God's commands in establishing morality.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, {{religious}} {{language has}} been explained as via negativa, analogy, symbolism, or myth, {{each of which}} describes a way of talking about God in human terms. The via negativa {{is a way of}} referring to God according to <b>what</b> <b>God</b> is not; analogy uses human qualities as standards against which to compare divine qualities; symbolism is used non-literally to describe otherwise ineffable experiences; and a mythological interpretation of religion attempts to reveal fundamental truths behind religious stories. Alternative explanations of religious language cast it as having political, performative, or imperative functions.|$|E
5|$|The {{prosperity}} theology {{teaching of}} positive confession stems from its proponents' view of scripture. The Bible {{is seen as}} a faith contract between God and believers; God is understood to be faithful and just, so believers must fulfill their end of the contract to receive God's promises. This leads to a belief in positive confession, the doctrine that believers may claim whatever they desire from God, simply by speaking it. Prosperity theology teaches that the Bible has promised prosperity for believers, so positive confession means that believers are speaking in faith <b>what</b> <b>God</b> has already spoken about them. Positive confession is practiced to bring about what is already believed in; faith itself is a confession, and speaking it brings it into reality.|$|E

5|$|Various {{forms of}} divine command theory have been {{presented}} by philosophers including William of Ockham, St Augustine, Duns Scotus, and John Calvin. The theory generally teaches that moral truth does not exist independently of God and that morality is determined by divine commands. Stronger versions of the theory assert that God's command is {{the only reason that}} a good action is moral, while weaker variations cast divine command as a vital component within a greater reason. The theory asserts that good actions are morally good {{as a result of their}} being commanded by God, and many religious believers subscribe to some form of divine command theory. Because of these premises, adherents believe that moral obligation is obedience to God's commands; what is morally right is <b>what</b> <b>God</b> desires.|$|E
5|$|Evan loads {{hundreds}} of animals onto the Ark {{in front of}} {{hundreds of}} spectators and live news crews, who continue to mock him. Later, Long and the policemen arrive with a wrecking ball crew to try and destroy the ark, since it violates numerous building codes in Prestige Crest. When the wrecking crew threatens to demolish the ark within three minutes, a brief rainstorm occurs, prompting some of the spectators to leave. The rain also prevents the crew from proceeding, buying Evan a little time. Evan connects Long's profiteering ethics and <b>what</b> <b>God</b> had already {{told him about the}} original form of Prestige Crest, and realizes that the dam under Long Lake had violated building codes and will likely prepare to burst. Evan warns to those present must immediately board the ark, and many have do so when the prophesied flood is triggered soon after the dam bursts. Prestige Crest is catastrophically destroyed, and the ark later rides the flood through the streets and landmarks of Washington, D.C.. The ark reaches its final destination in front of the Capitol, which disrupts the vote on the Public Land Act bill. Long becomes outraged that the flood did really happen. Evan informs Long that the flood was actually caused by his poor design of the dam, which prompts the other Congressmen also present to turn against Long.|$|E

25|$|Similarly, for Emmanuel Levinas, God is ethics, so one {{is brought}} closer to God when justice is {{rendered}} to the Other. This means that one experiences {{the presence of}} God through one’s relation to other people. To know God is to know what must be done, so {{it does not make}} sense to speak of God as <b>what</b> <b>God</b> is, but rather <b>what</b> <b>God</b> commands.|$|E
25|$|A Scout {{should be}} spiritual but Scouting {{is open to}} all {{religions}}. Scouting deals with religions in the practical way: by nature study (to see <b>what</b> <b>God</b> is) and helping others (which is <b>what</b> <b>God</b> asks for). According to Baden-Powell this is part of all religions. Scouting develops the spiritual side through teaching life-saving techniques and by promoting the daily good deed. Today religious practice is not a duty any more, as long as the Scout follows the Scout law and promise.|$|E

The cylindrical structure was built in 306 AD on the orders of the tetrarch Galerius, who was thought to have intended it to be his mausoleum.

25|$|The {{contemporary}} Shia scholar Abu al-Qasim al-Khoei {{provides a}} counter argument to this belief.

Rather, these additions were interpretations or explanations of <b>what</b> <b>God</b> was saying, or were in the form of revelations from God, explaining the intention of the verses in the Quran. These additions were not part of the Quran and not part of what the Messenger of God was commanded to convey to the Muslim community.|$|E

25|$|Rabbinic {{tradition}} {{holds that}} the details and interpretation of the law, which are called the Oral Torah or oral law, were originally an unwritten tradition based upon <b>what</b> <b>God</b> told Moses on Mount Sinai. However, as the persecutions of the Jews increased and the details {{were in danger of}} being forgotten, these oral laws were recorded by Rabbi Judah HaNasi (Judah the Prince) in the Mishnah, redacted circa 200 CE. The Talmud was a compilation of both the Mishnah and the Gemara, rabbinic commentaries redacted over the next three centuries. The Gemara originated in two major centers of Jewish scholarship, Palestine and Babylonia. Correspondingly, two bodies of analysis developed, and two works of Talmud were created. The older compilation is called the Jerusalem Talmud. It was compiled sometime during the 4th century in Palestine. The Babylonian Talmud was compiled from discussions in the houses of study by the scholars Ravina I, Ravina II, and Rav Ashi by 500 CE, although it continued to be edited later.|$|E
