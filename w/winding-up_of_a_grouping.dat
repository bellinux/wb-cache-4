5000|$|The court {{noted that}} unlike the {{bankruptcy}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> person, the <b>winding-up</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{company does not}} transfer legal title to the company's property to the liquidator.

5000|$|Provisional {{liquidation}} is {{a process}} which exists {{as part of the}} corporate insolvency laws <b>of</b> <b>a</b> number <b>of</b> common law jurisdictions whereby after the lodging <b>of</b> <b>a</b> petition for the <b>winding-up</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> company by the court, but before the court hears and determines the petition, the court may appoint a liquidator on a [...] "provisional" [...] basis. [...] The provisional liquidator is appointed to safeguard the assets of the company and maintain the status quo pending the hearing of the petition. Unlike a conventional liquidator, a provisional liquidator does not assess claims against the company or try to distribute the company's assets to creditors.|$|R
50|$|A license can be {{terminated}} {{on the death}} of the licensee, the licensee becoming bankrupt, the licensee becoming a patient under the Mental Health Act 1959, a bankruptcy deal under the Bankruptcy Act 1914 in which the license is given to a trustee or a deal under the Deeds of Arrangement Act 1914 in which the licensee's license is handed to a trustee. Such provisions cover both individual, unincorporated bodies and partnerships who are license holders. These provisions do not cover corporate bodies, because following consultations the Government became aware that the liquidation and <b>winding-up</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> corporate body would pose problems with licensing, largely because the body continues to trade through a liquidator.|$|R

40|$|LL. M. (Commercial Law) Section 81 (1) (d) of the Companies Act 71 <b>of</b> 2008 allows <b>a</b> company, {{one or more}} of its {{directors}} or shareholders {{to apply}} to <b>a</b> court <b>of</b> law to wind up a solvent company. In essence, they can do so under three specified circumstances namely, where the directors are deadlocked in the management of the company and the shareholders are unable to break the deadlock, the shareholders are deadlocked in voting power and have failed for a period that includes at least two consecutive annual general meeting dates, to elect successors to directors whose terms have expired, or it is otherwise just and equitable for a company to be wound up. Item 9 schedule 5 (1) of the Companies Act 2008 states that chapter 14 of the Companies Act 1973 continues to apply in regard to <b>winding-up</b> and liquidation <b>of</b> companies under the Companies Act 2008 as if the Companies Act 61 of 1973 has not been repealed. By virtue of this schedule, section 347 of the Companies Act 1973 still remains applicable. However, section 347 (1) of the Companies Act 1973 still makes reference to section 346 of the Companies Act 1973 which is no longer applicable for <b>winding-up</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> solvent company and for that very reason it appears as though the intention is that section 347 (1) of the Companies Act 1973 should not apply in such circumstances, I recommended that an amendment be made to the Companies Act 2008 to rectify this discrepancy. In light of the inclusion of section 347 (2) of the Companies Act 1973, by virtue of item 9 schedule 5 of the Companies Act 2008, an application brought by shareholders places a definitive onus and an additional burden on the applicants to prove that they have exhausted all remedies available to them and they had no other alternative but to bring a winding-up application as a last resort. The all encompassing provision of section 81 (1) (d) (iii) of the Companies Act 2008, I argued, should allow for <b>a</b> <b>winding-up</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> company, even in respect of the weaker forms of deadlock, where it does not fit neatly within section 81 (1) (d) (i) and section 81 (1) (d) (ii) of the Companies Act 2008. The word ‘otherwise’, in my opinion, has been correctly included in section 81 (1) (d) (iii) of the Companies Act 2008. The courts will inevitably be 8 | P a g e left to determine the perimeters of section 81 (1) (d) (iii) of the Companies Act in relation to the sections 81 (1) (d) (i) and 81 (1) (d) (ii) of the Companies Act 2008. I discovered striking similarities to the wording of the just and equitable provision and this wording has been consistent in various versions of the companies acts (both current and previous) in various jurisdictions. The ejusdem generis principle, I argued, is not applicable and the just and equitable provision needs to be looked at independently of the other grounds. From the recent case law arising on the interpretation of section 81 (1) (d) of the Companies Act 2008, {{it is clear that the}} various principles which were developed during the era of the previous companies acts were still applicable and relevant to the Companies Act 2008, unless the Supreme Court of Appeal in South Africa decides otherwise...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (LLM (Mercantile Law)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2007. The {{freedom to}} {{transfer}} an undertaking {{is part of}} the employer’s freedom of contract. The transferee <b>of</b> <b>an</b> undertaking under the common law has the right to choose whether he wants to contract with employees or not. By the implementation of section 197 of the Labour Relations Act (1995) and the amended sections 197, 197 <b>A</b> <b>of</b> the Labour Relations Act (2002) the legislator provides for an automatic transfer in cases where the undertaking is transferred as a going concern. The former accordance with the regulations of the insolvency law and the fact that sequestration or the <b>winding-up</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> insolvent undertaking had to be to the advantage of the creditors was lost after the legislative steps of 1995. The effects of the above-mentioned sections and especially the problems regarding the transfer of insolvent undertakings shall be analysed in this thesis. It is the aim of this thesis to examine how sections 197, 197 <b>A</b> <b>of</b> the Labour Relations Act and section 38 of the Insolvency Act should be applied and interpreted to achieve social justice. This makes it necessary to examine the history and development of the South African law <b>of</b> transfer <b>of</b> <b>an</b> insolvent undertaking too. Section 197 of the Labour Relations Act is mostly based on European law. Although it is not the intention of this thesis to compare the European law with the South African law, several South African aspects will be examined from a European and especially German perspective...|$|R
