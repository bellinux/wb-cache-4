5|$|Things <b>We</b> <b>Do</b> <b>Not</b> Talk About: Exploring Latino/a Literature through Essays and Interviews (2014). By Daniel Olivas. Interview of Sandra Cisneros {{featured}} in book.|$|E
5|$|You {{are going}} to have a four-lane highway through Wyoming. You {{are going to}} build two four-lane {{highways}} through New Mexico and Arizona. Colorado needs to be able to compete with our neighboring states. <b>We</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> want to take anything away from them. <b>We</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> want them to get way out ahead of us, either, because these interstate highways are going to be very attractive highways for the East and West to travel on.|$|E
5|$|By {{meditation}} I mean prolonged reasoning {{with the}} understanding, in this way. We begin by {{thinking of the}} favor which God bestowed upon us by giving us His only Son; and <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> stop there but proceed to consider the mysteries of His whole glorious life.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why {{should you}} imagine, Elinor, that <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> go there, or that <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> see the house? Is not {{it what you}} have often wished to do yourself?" ...|$|R
30|$|Unlike Pritchett, <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> {{include the}} CIF/FOB ratio as a {{regressor}} because <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> obtain data of this variable {{for the whole}} period. This variable, however, <b>did</b> <b>not</b> have a statistically significant effect in Pritchett’s regression.|$|R
30|$|<b>We</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> perform {{intramuscular}} electromyography, as {{we considered}} it invasive even if relevant for our purpose. Moreover, <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> perform surface electromyography, {{as it has}} been proved that it <b>does</b> <b>not</b> accurately show the activity of the infraspinatus muscle [36, 37].|$|R
5|$|According to St Petersburg {{psychiatrist}} Vladimir Pshizov, {{with regard}} to punitive psychiatry, the nature of psychiatry is of such a sort that using psychiatrists against opponents of authorities is always tempting for the authorities, because it is seemingly possible not {{to take into account}} an opinion by the person who received a diagnosis. Therefore, the issue will always remain relevant. While <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> have government policy of using psychiatry for repression, psychiatrists and former psychiatric nomenklatura retained the same on-the-spot reflexes.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} cantatas Bach {{composed}} {{in his first}} years in Leipzig, <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> know {{the identity of the}} librettist. It is the third in a group of ten cantatas following the same structure of biblical text (in this case from the Old Testament) – recitative – aria – recitative – aria – chorale. The ten cantatas were dedicated to the 8th to 14th and 21st to 22nd Sunday after Trinity and the second Sunday after Easter.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} that <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> have Ine's laws in their original 7th-century form. Alfred mentions in the prologue to his laws that he rejected earlier laws which he disliked. He did not specify what laws he omitted, but {{if they were the}} ones no longer relevant in his own time, it cannot be assumed that the surviving version of Ine's laws is complete.|$|E
5000|$|Lord Caradon also maintained, We didn't {{say there}} should be a {{withdrawal}} to the '67 line; <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> put the 'the' in, <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> say all the territories, deliberately.. We all knew - that the boundaries of '67 were not drawn as permanent frontiers, they were a cease-fire line of a couple of decades earlier... <b>We</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> say that the '67 boundaries must be forever; it would be insanity.|$|R
5000|$|Nothing will deter us from Palestine. Which jail {{we go to}} {{is up to you}} British. <b>We</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> ask you {{to reduce}} our rations; <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> ask you to put us in Poppendorf and Am Stau.|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> furnish {{the whole}} house at first, but what mattered it? We had no horse or cow, but the pasture and barn were ready for them. <b>We</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> propose to begin with {{everything}} at once.|$|R
5|$|With Goya <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> {{think of}} the studio or even of the artist at work. We think only of the event. Does this imply that The Third of May {{is a kind of}} {{superior}} journalism, the record of an incident in which depth of focus is sacrificed to an immediate effect? I am ashamed to say that I once thought so; but the longer I look at this extraordinary picture and at Goya's other works, the more clearly I recognise that I was mistaken.|$|E
5|$|Hazlitt then {{comments}} {{on some of}} the other characters seen not in isolation but as they interact with and affect one another, comparing and contrasting them to highlight subtle differences. For example, the characters of Goneril and Regan, the comparison of which he begins with a note of personal distaste ("they are so thoroughly hateful that <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> even like to repeat their names"), are shown, he points out, partly in their reaction to their sister Cordelia's desire that they treat their father well—Prescribe not to us our duties—and partly by the contrast of their hypocrisy with the candor of the otherwise evil Edmund.|$|E
5|$|Information {{concerning}} the soft anatomy of Amphidromus is widely scattered and fragmentary. The most complete account {{is that of}} Arnold Jacobi (1895) on specimens from Great Natuna (Natuna Islands) and Djemadja (Anamba Islands). Unfortunately, although {{it is clear that}} anatomical differences exist in the two species Jacobi dissected, unfortunately <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> know which forms he worked on, because he had incorrectly identified his material. In his paper he referred to the two species as Amphidromus chloris and the interruptus phase of A. perversus. However, that is not possible, because in reality Amphidromus chloris is a species found only in the Philippine Islands, and the interruptus phase of A. perversus is not present in the Natuna Islands.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> agree. It is {{only fair}} {{to tell you}} that we differed--vitally. On the other hand, it is just that you should know that <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> part in anger, but, I think, with a mutual respect." ...|$|R
30|$|<b>We</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> {{have any}} funding.|$|R
6000|$|... 'We see, Merton,' said Clancy, 'that {{you know}} a good deal which <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> know {{ourselves}} till lately. In fact, <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> know each other till the Church Congress at Leamington. Then the other men came to tea at my rooms, and saw--' ...|$|R
5|$|The Senate {{as a body}} {{remained}} {{devoid of}} any significant power; nevertheless, the senators, who had been marginalized as potential holders of imperial functions during the 3rd century, could now dispute such positions alongside more upstart bureaucrats. Some modern historians see in those administrative reforms an attempt by Constantine at reintegrating the senatorial order into the imperial administrative elite to counter the possibility of alienating pagan senators from a Christianized imperial rule; however, such an interpretation remains conjectural, {{given the fact that}} <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> have the precise numbers about pre-Constantine conversions to Christianity in the old senatorial milieu—some historians suggesting that early conversions among the old aristocracy were more numerous than previously supposed.|$|E
25|$|We {{intend to}} publish nothing <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> {{think we can}} morally defend. All that we publish we shall defend.|$|E
25|$|We {{came down}} here to offer {{evidence}} in this case and the court has held under the law that the evidence we had is not admissible, so {{all we can do is}} to take an exception and carry it to a higher court to see whether the evidence is admissible or not...we cannot even explain to you that we think you should return a verdict of not guilty. <b>We</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> see how you could. <b>We</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> ask it.|$|E
60|$|Our ex-boarder {{wrote to}} us {{that he and his}} wife were anxious that we should return their visit during my holidays; but as <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> see exactly how we could return a visit of the kind, <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> try to <b>do</b> it.|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> {{wait for}} the kettle to boil, but {{concluded}} to do without tea or coffee, for this meal, and content ourselves with pure water. For some reason or other, however, the creek water <b>did</b> <b>not</b> {{seem to be very}} pure, and <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> like it a bit.|$|R
40|$| {{accumulation}} of genistein. <b>We</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> find any|$|R
25|$|<b>We</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> {{know how}} big the army was, {{but it had to}} be quite big, since it could wage war on two, or even three {{different}} fronts.|$|E
25|$|<b>We</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> {{know when}} or where cricket was first {{played in the}} West Indies but it is {{reasonable}} to assume that it was introduced by these early colonists.|$|E
25|$|Finally, <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> {{want the}} empty set {{to belong to}} U because then {{everything}} would belong to U, as every set has the empty set as a subset.|$|E
30|$|The {{limitations}} {{of the current study}} are as follows: First, <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> include non-CCRCC, such as papillary RCC and homophobic RCC, because their different cellular pathological types may influence diffusion. Second, <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> evaluate the renal tumors < 15  mm, therefore, the smaller sample size might have affected the results.|$|R
60|$|Well, we had {{all been}} badly hoaxed. But <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> trumpet our wrongs abroad. <b>We</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> even call Billy to account. We thought that least said was soonest mended in such a matter. We went very softly indeed, lest the grown-ups, {{especially}} that terrible Uncle Roger, should hear of it.|$|R
30|$|<b>We</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> find {{spontaneous}} pneumothorax cases {{in our case}} series.|$|R
25|$|Notice {{that the}} proof that L {{is a model}} of ZFC only {{requires}} that V be a model of ZF, i.e. <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>NOT</b> assume that the axiom of choice holds in V.|$|E
25|$|Our {{concern here}} {{is limited to}} crimes against {{individual}} persons. <b>We</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> address, for example, crimes defining and punishing treason, espionage, terrorism, and drug kingpin activity, which are offenses against the State.|$|E
25|$|Hankey wrote (26 November) {{that only}} Britain, the USA and Germany {{were likely to}} last until 1919 and that “on the whole the balance of {{advantage}} lies with us, provided <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> exhaust ourselves prematurely”.|$|E
30|$|Other biases: <b>We</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> {{find any}} other source of bias.|$|R
5000|$|Actor Erwin Geschonneck {{told that}} [...] "In Carbide and Sorrel <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> ignore {{the hardships of}} the time. <b>We</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> turn the people who rebuilt the country into a joke... We knew that, {{in spite of all}} the {{challenges}} back then, the people also had funny experiences and knew to laugh about them." ...|$|R
30|$|<b>We</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> publish or {{register}} a protocol for this systematic review.|$|R
