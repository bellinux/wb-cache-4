40|$|The {{cleaning}} of heat exchanging units is {{of a major}} concern for steam power plant. It has been proposed by the plant authority to install an on-line cleaning system at Callide Power Station located near Biloela, Queensland, Australia, on the steam condensing electrical generation units. The condenser is fitted with a <b>waterbox</b> to distribute the cooling water internally throughout. The cleaning system may incorporate the cycling of sponge balls throughout the cooling water circuit of the condenser, which through their abrasive action remove fouling. To predict the potential effectiveness of this cleaning system, {{it is important to}} determine the distribution of balls, i. e. the distribution of fluid velocity throughout the condenser tube systems is uniform and even. A Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model is developed in this study in order to simulate and evaluate the fluid velocity distribution inside the condenser <b>waterbox.</b> The simulation results are presented and discussed, so that plant authority can realize the implementation of this cleaning system...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the main features}} and performance of a retrofitted cathodic protection (CP) system on six, 5. 2 MGD multistage flash (MSF) units which has operated satisfactorily for an extremely long period. The installation of the CP system was precipitated by experience of severe corrosion on many carbon-steel components within months of commencing operation of the MSF units. An extensive impressed-current CP system was fitted to the internal surfaces of painted carbon-steel pipes, rubber-lined <b>waterboxes</b> and other components. After one year of operation, it was found possible to drastically {{reduce the number of}} anodes and, almost two decades later, the CP system continues to successfully control corrosion on the components. The paper {{describes the}} CP system and presents evidence from internal inspections of its effectiveness. The important features contributing to the performance of the CP system, in terms of operating parameters and economics, are discussed. In this respect, evidence is presented of the crucial role, in the corrosion-control process of the concurrent deposition of calcareous scale during operation of the CP system...|$|R

40|$|This article {{investigates the}} thermal {{distortion}} of a funnel mold for continuous casting of thin slabs and explores the implications on taper and solidification {{of the steel}} shell. The three-dimensional mold temperatures are calculated using shell-mold heat flux and cooling water profiles that were calibrated with plant measurements. The thermal stresses and distorted shape of the mold are calculated with a detailed finite-element model of a symmetric fourth of the entire mold and <b>waterbox</b> assembly, and they are validated with plant thermocouple data and measurements of the wear of the narrow-face copper mold plates. The narrow-face mold dis-torts into the typical parabolic arc, and the wide face distorts into a ‘‘W’ ’ shape owing to the large variation in bolt stiffnesses. The thermal expansion of the wide face works against the applied narrow-face taper and funnel effects, so the effect of thermal distortion must be con-sidered to accurately predict the ideal mold taper...|$|E
40|$|Copyright 2015 ACM. Smart water {{distribution}} networks {{are a good}} example of a large scale Cyber-Physical System that requires monitoring for precise data analysis and network control. Due to the critical nature of {{water distribution}}, an extensive simulation of decision making and control algorithms are required before their deployment. Although some aspects of water network behaviour can be simulated in software such as hydraulic responses in valve changes, software simulators are unable to include dynamic events such as leakages or bursts in physical models. Furthermore, due to safety concerns, contemporary large-scale testbeds are limited to the monitoring processes or control methods with well established safety guarantees. Sophisticated algorithms for dynamic and optimal water network reconfiguration are not yet widespread. This paper presents a small-scale testbed, <b>WaterBox,</b> which allows the simulation of emerging/advanced monitoring and control algorithms in a fail-safe environment. The flexible hydraulic, hardware, and software infrastructure enables a substantial number of experiments. On-going experiments are related to in-node data processing and decision making, energy optimization, event-driven communication, and automatic control...|$|E
40|$|In {{the drug}} {{discovery}} process, {{there are multiple}} factors that make a successful candidate other than whether it antagonises a chosen active site, or performs allosteric regulation. Each test candidate is profiled by its absorption into the bloodstream, distribution throughout the organism, its products of metabolism, method of excretion, and overall toxicity; summarised as ADMET. There are currently methods to calculate and predict such properties, {{but the majority of}} these involve rule-based, empirical approaches that run the risk of lacking accuracy as one's search of chemical space ventures into the more novel. The lack of experimental data on organometallic systems also means that some of these methods refuse to predict properties on them outright, losing the opportunity to exploit this relatively untapped area that holds promise for new antibacterial and antineoplastic pharmaceutical compounds. Using the more transferable and definitive quantum mechanical (QM) approach to drug discovery is desirable, but the computational cost of conventional Hartree-Fock (HF) and Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations are too high. Using the linear-scaling DFT program, onetep, we aim to exploit the benefits of DFT in calculations with much larger fragments of, and in some cases entire biomolecules, in order to demonstrate calculations which could ultimately be used in developing more accurate methods of profiling drug candidates, with a computational cost that albeit still high, is now feasible with the provision of modern supercomputers. In this thesis, we first use linear-scaling DFT methods to address the lack of electron polarisation and charge transfer effects in energy calculations using a molecular mechanics forcefield. Multiple DFT calculations are performed on molecular dynamics(MD) snapshots of small molecules in a <b>waterbox,</b> with the aim of computing a MM!QM correction term, which can be applied to a forcefield binding free energy approach (such as thermodynamic integration) which will process a far greater number of MD snapshots. As a result, one will obtain the precision from processing very large numbers of MD snapshots of biomolecular systems, but the accuracy of QM. To improve efficiency of the QM phase of the overall method, we use electrostatic embedding to model the regions of the <b>waterbox</b> that are far from the solute, yet are still important to include. As this is a relatively new module in onetep, we present validation data prior to its use in the main work. Secondly, we validate different methods of calculating the pKa {{of a wide variety of}} molecules: from small, organic compounds, to the organometallic cisplatin, with the ultimate goal being of such calculations to eventually address questions such as, assuming oral intake, where in the gastrointestinal tract will a drug molecule be absorbed into the bloodstream, and how much of the original dose will be absorbed. These calculations are then scaled up significantly to examine the potential of using linear-scaling DFT to calculate the pKa of specific residues in proteins. This is performed with a 305 -atom tryptophan cage, the 814 -atom Ovomucoid Silver Pheasant Third Domain(OMSVP 3) and a 2346 -atom section of the T 99 A/M 102 Q T 4 -lysozyme mutant. We also highlight the challenges in calculating protein pKa. Finally, we study the hydrogen-abstraction reaction between cyclohexene and cytochrome P 450 cam, through onetep single point energy calculations of a 10 -snapshot adiabaticreaction profile generated by the Mulholland Group(University of Bristol). Following this, the LST and QST methods of determining the transition state (available through onetep) are used, with the aims of determining the importance of the protein surrounding the active site in regards to the activation energy and structural geometry of the calculated transition state. The LST and QST methods are also validated, through modelling of the SN 2 reaction between fluoride and chloromethane. The aim of this part of our work is to eventually assist in developing a metabolism (and toxicity) model of the different isoforms of cytochrome P 450. Overall, this thesis aims to highlight not only the capability of linear-scaling DFT in becoming an important part of biomolecular simulation, but also the challenges that one will face upon scaling up calculations that were previously simple to perform, based on the small size of the system being modelled. <br/...|$|E
