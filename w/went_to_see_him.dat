25|$|In February 1897, {{six months}} after his arrival at Tiruvannamalai, Ramana moved to Gurumurtam, a temple about a mile away. Shortly after his arrival a sadhu named Palaniswami <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him.</b> Palaniswami's first darshan left him filled with peace and bliss, and from that time on he served Ramana as his {{permanent}} attendant. Besides physical protection, Palaniswami would also beg for alms, cook and prepare meals for himself and Ramana, and care for him as needed. In May 1898 Ramana moved to a mango orchard next to Gurumurtam.|$|E
25|$|At 08:00 {{the rebel}} {{officers}}' nominal superior, Maj. Kofuji, {{was told to}} inform the officers of the imperial command and order them {{to return to their}} units. However, Muranaka and Kōda had already heard of the command from Nakahashi. Believing the order to be a mistake, they <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him.</b> When they met Kofuji he only told them to come to 1st Division Headquarters. There they met Gen. Hori, who lied to them, telling them that no command had been issued. The relieved but skeptical officers left.|$|E
500|$|Hastings {{approached}} Gill {{and asked}} him for a place in his chambers. Gill's chambers were full but he did suggest a well-respected barrister named F. E. Smith, and Hastings <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> with a letter of recommendation from Gill. Smith was out and Hastings instead spoke to his clerk; the two did not get on, and Hastings left without securing a place. Hastings later described this as [...] "the most fortunate moment of my whole career". Directly below Smith's chambers were those of Horace Avory, {{one of the most}} noted barristers of the 19th and early 20th centuries. As he prepared to return home, Hastings was informed that Chartres Biron (one of the barristers who occupied Avory's chambers) had been appointed a Metropolitan Magistrate, which freed up a space in the chambers. He immediately went to Avory's clerk and got him to introduce Hastings to Avory. Avory initially refused to give Hastings a place in the chambers, but after Hastings lost his temper and exclaimed that [...] "if he didn't want me to help him it would leave me more time to myself", Avory laughed and changed his mind.|$|E

500|$|Later, {{his style}} of {{scouting}} {{was used as a}} blueprint by scouts to evaluate players. He usually ignored the obvious tools such as ability to hit, size, speed, and human power, saying that [...] "any dope" [...] could see it. When he scouted a prospect, his top priority was checking that the subject could handle the pressure of playing Major League Baseball. When he got word of a promising player, he <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> play. If Krichell liked what he saw, he discussed the player's goals and motivation with him and his family. He decided whether the player was ready for the Yankees or one of their farm teams to use. He tended to take a risk with players passed by other teams. He discounted some of a player's weaknesses if their remaining skills were up to par, for example with Tony Lazzeri, who was a poor fielder. Krichell also {{was one of the first}} to notice that intelligence mattered in a game filled with uneducated people. Most of his signings were college graduates who Krichell believed could take advantage of their ability to think.|$|E
2500|$|Shortly {{after his}} birth, Pasternak's parents {{had joined the}} Tolstoyan Movement. Novelist Leo Tolstoy was a close family friend, as Pasternak recalled, [...] "my father {{illustrated}} his books, <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him,</b> revered him, and ...the whole house was imbued with his spirit." ...|$|E
2500|$|Paul VI {{supported}} the new-found harmony and cooperation with Protestants {{on so many}} levels. When Cardinal Augustin Bea <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> for permission for a joint Catholic-Protestant translation of the Bible with Protestant Bible societies, the pope walked towards him and exclaimed, [...] "as far as the cooperation with Bible societies is concerned, I am totally in favour." [...] He issued a formal approval on Pentecost 1967, the feast on which the Holy Spirit descended on the Christians, overcoming all linguistic difficulties, according to Christian tradition.|$|E

2500|$|In 56 BC Caesar, who was {{fighting}} the Gallic Wars, crossed the Alps into Italy and wintered in Luca (Lucca, Tuscany). In the Life of Crassus, Plutarch wrote {{that a big}} crowd {{wanted to see him}} and 200 men of senatorial rank and various high officials <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him.</b> [...] He met Pompey and Crassus and agreed {{that the two of them}} would stand for the consulship and that he would support them by sending soldiers to Rome to vote for them. They were then to secure the command of provinces and armies for themselves and confirm his provinces for a further five years. Therefore, he worked on putting the officials of the year under his obligation. In the Life of Pompey, Plutarch added that Caesar also wrote letters to his friends and that the three men were aiming at making themselves the masters of the state. Suetonius maintained that Caesar compelled Pompey and Crassus to meet him at Luca. This was because Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus, one of the praetors, called for an inquiry into his conduct in the previous year. Caesar went to Rome and put the matter before the senate. This was not taken up and he returned to Gaul. He was also a target for prosecution by a plebeian tribune, but he was not brought to trial because he pleaded with the other tribunes not to prosecute him on the grounds of his absence from Rome. Lucius Domitius was now a candidate for the consulship and openly threatened to take up arms against him. Caesar prevailed on Pompey and Crassus to stand for the consulship against Lucius Domitius. He succeeded through their influence to have his term as governor of Gaul extended for five years. In Appian’s account, too, 200 senators went to see Caesar. So did many incumbent officials, governors and commanders. They thanked him for gifts they received or asked for money or favours. Caesar, Pompey and Crassus agreed on the consulship of the latter two and the extension of Caesar’s governorship. In this version Lucius Domitius presented his candidacy for the consulship after Luca and did so against Pompey.|$|E
