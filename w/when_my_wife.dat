6000|$|... "Yva, <b>when</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> {{lay dying}} she bade me seek her elsewhere, for {{certainly}} I should find her. Doubtless she meant beyond {{the shores of}} death--or perhaps she also dreamed." ...|$|E
60|$|HECTOR. Yet {{she breaks}} hearts, easy as her house is. That poor devil upstairs with his flute howls when she twists his heart, just as Mangan howls <b>when</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> twists his.|$|E
60|$|It {{was late}} in the summer <b>when</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> returned, and when she made her first visit of {{inspection}} to the grounds and gardens, her eyes, of course, fell upon the unfinished well. She was shocked.|$|E
6000|$|... "I was {{not aware}} of it," [...] he answered. [...] "Testimony in my favor can be called which will prove that <b>when</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife's</b> {{complicity}} was discovered I was absent from Paris." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, <b>when</b> I and <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> {{were married}} at Norcombe Church," [...] {{said the old}} maltster, not pleased at finding himself {{left out of the}} subject, [...] "we were called the handsomest couple in the neighbourhood--everybody said so." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{investment}} is bringing in good interest," [...] he said, [...] "and {{as it was}} Jerry who did the work in getting it, the lad shall have it just as it stands <b>when</b> I and <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> die." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Many thanks," [...] he said. [...] "Then {{there is}} no mistake, and I am the happy benedict. I suppose I should go stand upon the bridal corner, and <b>when</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> gets through walking the streets she will look me up." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{rats and}} mice Amenda did not object to. She said she liked to watch them. But against the blackbeetles she was prejudiced. Therefore, <b>when</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> {{informed}} her that MacShaughnassy's aunt had given us an infallible recipe for their annihilation, she rejoiced.|$|E
60|$|About noon on the {{following}} day, <b>when</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> and I were laughing and arguing over some little domestic detail of our meagre establishment--so soon are great griefs forgotten in an overwhelming joy, of a sudden I saw her face change, and asked what was the matter.|$|E
6000|$|... "Part of the {{sacrifice}}," [...] Hamel repeated, frowning. [...] "Is she, indeed! I don't {{know what}} sacrifice you mean, but Esther is the girl whom sooner or later, somehow or other, I {{am going to}} make <b>my</b> <b>wife,</b> and <b>when</b> she is <b>my</b> <b>wife,</b> I shall {{see to it that}} she isn't afraid of Miles Fentolin or of any other man breathing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't reckon to ever {{sell the}} mill," [...] said Collinson simply. Then observing {{the look of}} {{suspicion}} in his companion's face, he added gravely, [...] "You see, I rigged up the whole thing <b>when</b> I expected <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> out from the States, and I calkilate {{to keep it in}} memory of her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I can," [...] said Otto, [...] "for when I grow to {{be a man}} I {{will come}} again and marry thee, and <b>when</b> thou art <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> I can tell thee all the stories that I know. Dear Pauline, canst thou not tell my father where I am, that he may come here and take me away before I die?" ...|$|R
60|$|At {{the hour}} <b>when</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> and Clara set sail for America, Susy {{was in no}} danger. Three hours later there came a sudden change for the worse. Meningitis set in, and it was {{immediately}} apparent that she was death-struck. That was Saturday, the 15th of August.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very {{trying for}} your nerves. I {{know what it}} is. We're {{different}} from the last generation; they thought nothing of it. When Charles was born my dear old father was out hunting all day. <b>When</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> had George, it made me as nervous as a cat!" ...|$|E
6000|$|That was the 15th of August, 1896. Three days later, <b>when</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> and Clara {{were about}} half-way across the ocean, I was {{standing}} in our dining-room thinking of nothing in particular, when a cablegram was put into my hand. It said, [...] "Susy was peacefully released to-day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It shall depend entirely upon you. And yet I {{ought not}} to ask you. I ought to do as these people bid me without even troubling you for an {{expression}} of your wish. I do believe that <b>when</b> you become <b>my</b> <b>wife,</b> you will have as complete a right to the title as has Lady Kingsbury to hers. Shall it be so?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There's {{one thing}} I ought {{to tell you}} before I go further. <b>When</b> we married, <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> made over all her {{property}} to me--rather against my will, for I saw how awkward {{it would be if}} my business affairs went wrong. However, she would have it so, and it was done. Well, about six weeks ago she came to me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Pooh!" [...] said Mr. Tulliver, jealous for Maggie, [...] "she's a small thing, {{not much}} of a figure. But fine {{feathers}} make fine birds. I see nothing to admire so much in those diminutive women; they look silly by the side o' the men,--out o' proportion. <b>When</b> I chose <b>my</b> <b>wife,</b> I chose her the right size,--neither too little nor too big." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{waters of}} the family council were troubled when Jenny, flaming with enthusiasm, brought home the report of this conversation. <b>When</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> proceeded, with her well-trained {{business}} knowledge, to compare the prices of the simplest elegancies recommended by Aunt Easygo with the sum total to be drawn on, faces lengthened perceptibly.|$|E
6000|$|There soon appeared, pausing in {{the dark}} doorway as he entered, a hale, grey-haired old man. Little Agnes, {{attracted}} by his looks, had run to bring him in, and I had not yet clearly seen his face, <b>when</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife,</b> starting up, cried out to me, in a pleased and agitated voice, that it was Mr. Peggotty! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My wife {{is there}} {{now with our}} only driving wagon, or I would offer to take you over," [...] said Forster. [...] "I can, however, lend you a saddle-horse, and Miss Merril could stay with Miss Wheelock until we see {{what can be done}} with the wagon. If necessary, I will drive her across <b>when</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> comes back." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "At this point," [...] {{said the}} Master of the House, [...] "your hero makes me angry. Why should {{he think he}} could not go away and leave his wife for three days, <b>when</b> I leave <b>my</b> <b>wife,</b> and {{daughter}} too, for three years? His Anita is not worth one twentieth as much as either <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> or daughter. Then again, if I were in his place, I would not allow a disadvantageous half-million to take me away from you two. It is only the absolutely necessary thousands that make me leave you as I do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Bobbie," [...] I said, [...] "it's {{a pretty}} hard case to spring on an untrained amateur like me. Suppose someone {{had come to}} Sherlock Holmes and said, 'Mr. Holmes, here's a case for you. <b>When</b> is <b>my</b> <b>wife's</b> birthday?' Wouldn't that have given Sherlock a jolt? However, I {{know enough about the}} game to {{understand}} that a fellow can't shoot off his deductive theories unless you start him with a clue, so rouse yourself out of that pop-eyed trance and come across with two or three. For instance, can't you remember the last time she had a birthday? What sort of weather was it? That might fix the month." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wait," [...] he said. [...] "She {{has made}} her choice, as I knew she would; but I have yet to make mine. And I choose to marry no woman whose love belongs to another living man. Phillippa, I thought Owen Blair was dead, and I {{believed}} that, <b>when</b> you were <b>my</b> <b>wife,</b> I could win your love. But I love you too well to make you miserable. Go to the man you love--you are free!" ...|$|R
60|$|So I {{locked the}} door from the kitchen {{into the house and}} then the outside door of the kitchen, and <b>when</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> came down we hurried off. On the way I told her what I {{intended}} to do, and what I thought of our guest. She answered scarcely a word, and I hoped that she was frightened. I think she was.|$|E
60|$|Brain. Friendship, {{which has}} done much, will yet do more. [Shows a key.] With this passe par tout, I will {{instantly}} conduct her {{to my own}} chamber, that she may out-face the keeper, she has been there; and, <b>when</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> returns, who is my slave, I will lay my conjugal commands upon her, to affirm, they have been all this time together.|$|E
6000|$|My {{wife and}} I {{were sitting at}} the open bow-window of my study, {{watching}} the tuft of bright-red leaves on our favorite maple, which warned us that summer was over. I was solacing myself, like all the world in our days, with reading the [...] "Sch√∂nberg Cotta Family," [...] <b>when</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> made her voice heard through the enchanted distance, and dispersed the pretty vision of German cottage life.|$|E
60|$|Pretty {{thoughts}} again! and how persistently they come! It is {{one o'clock}} and I {{will go to}} bed. The rain is falling in sheets outside. I can hear it lashing against the window panes, and the wind wails through the tall wet elms {{at the end of}} the garden. I could tell the voice of those elms anywhere; I know it as well as the voice of a friend. What a night it is; we sometimes get them in this part of England in October. It was just such a night <b>when</b> <b>my</b> first <b>wife</b> died, and that is three years ago. I remember how she sat up in her bed.|$|R
6000|$|... "Have I a bed? Where slept, I {{should like}} to know, the Vice-Principal of the Convent of Molk {{on the day before}} the last holy Ascension? The waters were out in the morning; and <b>when</b> will <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> forget what his reverence was pleased to say when he took his leave; 'Good woman!' said he, 'my duty calls me; but the weather is cold; and between ourselves, I am used to great feasts, and I should have no objection, if I were privileged, to stay and to eat again of thy red cabbage and cream!' What say you to that? Do you think we have got beds now? You shall sleep to-night, sir, like an Aulic Councillor!" ...|$|R
6000|$|It {{seems to}} me that it is better to have a good man's {{flattering}} estimate of my influence--and to keep it--than to fool it away with trying to get him an office. But <b>when</b> <b>my</b> brother--on <b>my</b> <b>wife's</b> side--Mr. Charles J. Langdon--late of the Chicago Convention--desires me to speak a word for Mr. Fred Douglass, I am not asked [...] "to use my influence" [...] consequently I am not risking anything. So I am writing this as a simple citizen. I am not drawing on my fund of influence at all. A simple citizen may express a desire with all propriety, in the matter of a recommendation to office, and so I beg permission to hope that you will retain Mr. Douglass in his present office of Marshall of the District of Columbia, if such a course will not clash with your own preferences or with the expediencies and interest of your administration. I offer this petition with peculiar pleasure and strong desire, because I so honor this man's high and blemishless character and so admire his brave, long crusade for the liberties and elevation of his race.|$|R
60|$|I {{was going}} into town one morning from my {{suburban}} residence, <b>when</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> handed me {{a little piece of}} red calico, and asked me if I would have time, during the day, to buy her two yards and a half of calico like that. I assured her that it would be no trouble at all; and putting the sample in my pocket, I took the train for the city.|$|E
60|$|MORELL (with cold scorn). Wait a moment: I am {{not going}} to touch you: don't be afraid. <b>When</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> comes back she will want to know why you have gone. And when she finds that you are never going to cross our {{threshold}} again, she will want to have that explained, too. Now I don't wish to distress her by telling her that you have behaved like a blackguard.|$|E
60|$|There was {{no reason}} why our {{intimacy}} with the lovers' affairs should continue, and it did not. Miss Bentley made mention of Glendenning, <b>when</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> saw her, with what Mrs. March decided to be an abiding fealty, but without offer of confidence; and Glendenning, when we happened to meet at rare intervals, did not invite me to more than formal inquiry concerning the well-being of Mrs. Bentley and her daughter.|$|E
6000|$|... "I cannot say who;--perhaps everybody. Should every {{shilling}} of it {{be yours}} I should marry her as willingly to-morrow. They {{have given me}} what is my own, and that is enough for me. For what is now hers and, perhaps, should be yours, I will not interfere with it. <b>When</b> she is <b>my</b> <b>wife,</b> I will guard for her {{and for those who}} may come after her what belongs to her then; but as to what may be done before that, I care nothing." ...|$|R
5000|$|In early 2000, it was {{announced}} that a new doctor would arrive in EastEnders. A few days later it {{was announced}} he would be played by Nick Bailey. Bailey was working for an investment bank unloading boxes, when he received the call about auditioning for Anthony. He explained [...] "I was alone in the stockroom <b>when</b> <b>my</b> agent's <b>wife</b> rang and told me I'd got the part. I just jumped up and punched the air, then did a rumba round the room." [...] EastEnders marked Bailey's first major television role. Anthony was introduced as the son of B&B owner Audrey Trueman (Corinne Skinner-Carter). He made his first on-screen appearance on 11 December 2000. It was later announced his family would arrive later in the year.|$|R
6000|$|Immediately after Dan's {{departure}} I left Haco and Susan together, {{and they}} held the following conversation when left alone. I am enabled to report it faithfully, reader, because Susan told it word for word to her mistress, who has a very reprehensible habit of listening to the gossip of her maid. Of course Mrs B told it to me, because she tells everything to me, sometimes {{a good deal more}} than I care to hear. This I think a very reprehensible habit also. I am bound to listen, because <b>when</b> <b>my</b> strong-minded <b>wife</b> begins to talk I might as well try to stop a runaway locomotive as attempt to silence her. And so it comes about that I am now making the thing public! ...|$|R
