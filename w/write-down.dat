First, in July 2001, NAB had a $450 million write {{down of the}} value of its capitalised mortgage servicing rights (CMSRs) during the quarter ending 30 June 2001, and was the result of exceptionally high mortgage refinance volumes which lowered the value of the CMSRs, combined with a more challenging capital markets environment in which to hedge interest rate risk. This was followed shortly by a second <b>write-down</b> reported in September totalling $1.75 billion; this second <b>write-down</b> consisted of US$400 million from an incorrect interest rate assumption embedded in the mortgage servicing rights valuation model, US$760 million from changed assumptions in the model flowing from the continued unprecedented uncertainty and turbulence in the mortgage servicing market, and US$590 million from writing off of the goodwill. In total, NAB booked $2.2 billion in losses due to HomeSide.|$|E

25|$|Since re-established in 2002, ACF Fiorentina S.p.A. {{are yet to}} self-sustain to {{keep the}} team in top {{division}} {{as well as in}} European competitions. In the 2005 financial year, which cover the first Serie A season, the club made a net loss of €9,159,356, followed by a net loss of €19,519,789. In 2006 (2005–06 Serie A and 2006–07 Serie A), Fiorentina heavily invested on players, meaning the amortisation of intangible asset (the player contract) had increased from €17.7million to €24million. However the club suffered from the 2006 Italian football scandal, which meant the club did not qualify for Europe. In 2007 Fiorentina almost broke-even, with a net loss of just €3,704,953. In the 2007 financial year the TV revenue increased after they qualified to the 2007–08 UEFA Cup. Despite qualifying to the 2008–09 UEFA Champions League, Fiorentina made a net loss of €9,179,484 in 2008 financial year after the increase in TV revenue was outweighed by the increase in wage. In the 2009 financial year, Fiorentina made a net profit of €4,442,803, largely due to the profit on selling players (€33,631,489 from players such as Felipe Melo, Giampaolo Pazzini and Zdravko Kuzmanović; increased from about €3.5million in 2008).

In the 2011 financial year, the turnover slipped to €67,076,953, as the club's lack of capital gains from selling players and 2010 financial year still included the instalments from UEFA for participating 2009–10 UEFA Europa League. Furthermore, the gate income had dropped from €11,070,385 to €7,541,260. The wage bill did not fall much and in reverse the amortisation of transfer fee had sightly increased due to new signings. La Viola had savings in other costs but counter-weighted by huge €11,747,668 <b>write-down</b> for departed players, due to D'Agostino, Frey and Mutu, but the former would counter-weight by co-ownership financial income, which all made the operating cost remained high as worse as last year. Moreover, in 2010 the result was boosted by acquiring the asset from subsidiary (related to AC Fiorentina) and the re-valuation of its value in separate balance sheet. If deducting that income (€14,737,855), 2010 financial year was net loss 24,342,208 and 2011 result was worse with €8,131,876 only in separate balance sheet. In 2012, the club benefited from the sales of Matija Nastasić and Valon Behrami, followed by Stevan Jovetić and Adem Ljajić in 2013. In 2014, due to €28.4million drop from the windfall profit of selling players, the club recorded their worst financial results since re-foundation, despite the fact the club maintained the same level of windfall profit, the result was still worse than in 2013. Moreover, Fiorentina also revealed that the club had a relevant football net income of minus €19.5million in the first assessment period of UEFA Financial Fair Play Regulations in the 2013–14 season (in May 2014). (aggregate of 2012 and 2013 results), which within the limit of minus €45million, as well as minus €25.5million in assessment period 2014–15 (aggregate of 2012, 2013 and 2014 results). However, as the limit was reduced to minus €30million in assessment period 2015–16, 2016–17 and 2017–18 season, the club had to achieve a relevant net income of positive €5.6million in 2015 financial year. La Viola sold Juan Cuadrado to Chelsea in January 2015 for €30million fee, to make the club eligible to 2016–17 edition of UEFA competitions.|$|E

[...] Foreign investment remained low because of the Argentine hostility towards the IMF, the U.S. and the United Kingdom, the re-nationalization of privatized companies (such as the water supply, managed by the French company Suez), diplomatic isolation and state interventionism.

In this paper, we develop a model of sovereign debt <b>write-downs,</b> where governance problems reflect domestic distributive conflict between two classes in the society and intertemporal conflict. The main policy issue is how to design the optimal form of debt <b>write-downs</b> and the conditionality requirements attached to it with such governance problems in mind. To deal with the domestic distributive conflict, it is crucial that the conditionality requirements target both provision of public goods and private consumption level of the poor citizens. Addressing the intertemporal conflict problem requires the use of long-run conditionality requirements. Against such a benchmark, we then evaluate the efficacy of the current debt relief initiatives and discuss some policy implications. Debt Relief, Conditionality, HIPC Initiative. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{examines}} {{whether the}} scale advantage of auditing firms {{can be used}} as an alternative indicator of audit quality when the evaluation of audit quality is costly. The adoption of asset impairment recognition in China has brought about a considerable impact on financial reporting of Chinese listing companies in recent years. This new accounting practice provided a special environment, which was subjected to less endogeneity problems than usual, to test the relationship between the scale of auditing business and audit quality. Prior research reported empirical evidence that both market value and firm characteristics are empirically related to <b>write-downs,</b> reflected in the four dimensions return relevance, price relevance, persistence and determinant. Using these four dimensions, we investigated whether audit business scale advantage (ABSA) affect audit quality of asset <b>write-downs.</b> We contribute to the literature with the following findings. First, auditors’ business scale is positively related to return relevance of <b>write-downs.</b> Second, auditors with ABSA not only enhance the relevance between impairments and economic variables but also weaken the relation between impairments and managerial variables; however, the results appear in {{only a few of the}} firm-specific variables. Third, results are mixed when we test the ABSA effect on price-relevance and persistence dimensions. Fourth, the ABSA effect is stronger when the complexity of asset <b>write-downs</b> requires some inside information to comprehend the nature of action. Adding to the main finding, we also found the ABSA effect became weaker when we proxy ABSA with raw data of companies’ business scale instead of the top five auditors in business scale. Taken together, our results show that the ABSA effect does exist in auditing of assets <b>write-downs,</b> although with weak evidence. Our results also indicated rational auditor choice based on quality of service in China's audit market. We identified some unique factors from stakeholders’ cooperative structuring actions in China audit market as potential explanations to the market rationality...|$|R
