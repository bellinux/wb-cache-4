5|$|In a {{small sample}} of 11 {{deceased}} dogs, Australian Cattle Dogs had a median longevity of 11.7years (maximum 15.9yrs). A larger survey of 100 deceased dogs yielded a mean longevity of 13.41years <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> of 2.36years. The median longevities of breeds of similar size are between 11 and 13years. There is an anecdotal report of a Cattle Dog named Bluey, born in 1910 and living for 29.5years, but the record is unverified. Even if true, Bluey's record age would have to be regarded more as an uncharacteristic exception than as an indicator of common exceptional longevity for the entire breed. It remains, however, that Australian Cattle Dogs generally age well and appear to live on average almost a year longer than most dogs of other breeds in the same weight class. Many members of the breed are still well and active at 12 or 14years of age, and some maintain their sight, hearing and even their teeth until their final days.|$|E
5|$|The upper incisors {{are small}} and flat-crowned and are weakly divided into two lobes. A single large cusp is present on C1, with a smaller shelf at the back side. P2 is very small and P4 {{contains}} a high cusp at the front, a smaller cusp before it on the inner (lingual) side, and a shelf behind the high cusp. The length of P4 averages 2.13mm, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> (SD) of 0.104mm, and width is 2.52mm with an SD of 0.168mm. On the first upper molar (M1), the protofossa, a basin between cusps {{at the front of}} the tooth, is closed. The second molar (M2) is similar, but smaller and more squared. M3 is much smaller and has a reduced crown pattern resembling a W.|$|E
25|$|Those {{who died}} of {{multiple}} organ failure additionally exhibited signs of skin hemorrhaging and necrosis, though both are otherwise rare. The two likely reasons for skin hemorrhaging and necrosis are an inability to effectively neutralize the venom, or unusually potent venom toxicity for that set of stings. In either case, these stings lead to multiple organ injury. While not everyone displayed lesions or necrosis, a strong correlation existed {{between the number of}} stings and the severity of injury. Those who died, on average, were stung 59 times (<b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> of 12) while those who survived suffered 28 stings (<b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> of 4).|$|E

25|$|According to the {{findings}} of the Collaborative Longitudinal Evaluation of Keratoconus (CLEK), people who have keratoconus could be expected to pay more than $25,000 over their lifetime post-diagnosis, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> of $19,396. There is limited evidence on the costs of corneal cross-linking, a cost-effectiveness study estimated the costs of the total treatment for one person as £928 ($1,392 U.S.) in the UK National Health Service, but this may be as high as $2,500 per eye in other countries.

25|$|For example, assume an {{investor}} {{had to choose}} between two stocks. Stock A over the past 20 years had an average return of 10 percent, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> of 20 percentage points (pp) and Stock B, over the same period, had average returns of 12 percent but a higher standard deviation of 30 pp. On the basis of risk and return, {{an investor}} may decide that Stock A is the safer choice, because Stock B's additional two percentage points of return is not worth the additional 10 pp standard deviation (greater risk or uncertainty of the expected return). Stock B is likely to fall short of the initial investment (but also to exceed the initial investment) more often than Stock A under the same circumstances, and is estimated to return only two percent more on average. In this example, Stock A is expected to earn about 10 percent, plus or minus 20 pp (a range of 30 percent to −10 percent), about two-thirds of the future year returns. When considering more extreme possible returns or outcomes in future, an investor should expect results of as much as 10 percent plus or minus 60 pp, or a range from 70 percent to −50 percent, which includes outcomes for three standard deviations from the average return (about 99.7 percent of probable returns).|$|E
500|$|A {{total of}} 113 Justices have {{served on the}} Supreme Court of the United States, the highest {{judicial}} body in the United States. Justices have life tenure, and so they serve until they die in office, resign or retire, or are impeached and removed from office (which has never happened; the one impeached Justice was acquitted). The longest-serving member of the current court is Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy, with a term to date of [...] days ( [...] years). For the 104 non-incumbent justices, the mean length of service was 6,112 days (16.7 years) <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> of 3,620 days (9.9 years).

2500|$|A strong {{indication}} of the reliability of Chandrasekhar's formula is that the absolute magnitudes of supernovae of Type Ia are all approximately the same; at maximum luminosity, MV is approximately -19.3, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> {{of no more than}} 0.3., (1) [...] A 1-sigma interval therefore represents a factor of less than 2 in luminosity.

40|$|High speed {{photography}} {{coupled with}} sophisticated image analysis {{has been used}} to study the low frequency pulsation in the volume of melt being instantaneously delivered to the melt nozzle during close-coupled gas atomization. We find that at low gas pressures the distribution of material at the melt tip can be described by a log-normal distribution. At high gas pressure the distribution is better described by two superimposed log-normal distributions, one <b>with</b> <b>a</b> high <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> when there is little melt at the atomizer tip and <b>a</b> second <b>with</b> <b>a</b> lower <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> when there is more melt at the atomizer tip.

2500|$|In a neuron, {{synaptic}} vesicles (or neurotransmitter vesicles) store various neurotransmitters {{that are}} released at the synapse. The release is regulated by a voltage-dependent calcium channel. Vesicles {{are essential for}} propagating nerve impulses between neurons and are constantly recreated by the cell. The area in the axon that holds groups of vesicles is an axon terminal or [...] "bouton". Up to 130 vesicles can be released per bouton over a ten-minute period of stimulation at 0.2Hz. In the human brain region V1 synaptic vesicles have an average diameter of 39.5nanometers (nm) <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> of 5.1nm.|$|E

We can then infer that the probability that it has between 600 and 1400 words (i.e. within knbsp&=nbsp&2 standard deviations of the mean) must be at least 75%, because there is no more than [...] chance to be outside that range, by Chebyshev's inequality. But if we additionally know that the distribution is normal, we can say there is a 75% chance the word count is between 770 and 1230 (which is an even tighter bound).|$|E

2500|$|Two of {{the longest}} living dogs on record, [...] "Bluey" [...] and [...] "Chilla", were Australian Cattle Dogs.

The 100-dog survey yielded a mean longevity of 13.41 years <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> of 2.36 years. The study concluded that while Australian Cattle Dogs are a healthy breed and do live on average almost a year longer than most dogs of other breeds in the same weight class, record ages such as Bluey's or Chilla's should be regarded as uncharacteristic exceptions rather than as indicators of common exceptional longevity for the entire breed.|$|E
2500|$|The idea of {{characteristic}} earthquakes was {{the basis}} of the Parkfield prediction: fairly similar earthquakes in 1857, 1881, 1901, 1922, 1934, and 1966 suggested a pattern of breaks every 21.9 years, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> of ±3.1 years. Extrapolation from the 1966 event led to a prediction of an earthquake around 1988, or before 1993 at the latest (at the 95% confidence interval). The appeal of such a method is that the prediction is derived entirely from the trend, which supposedly accounts for the unknown and possibly unknowable earthquake physics and fault parameters. [...] However, in the Parkfield case the predicted earthquake did not occur until 2004, a decade late. This seriously undercuts the claim that earthquakes at Parkfield are quasi-periodic, and suggests the individual events differ sufficiently in other respects to question whether they have distinct characteristics in common.|$|E
2500|$|If the {{population}} of interest is approximately normally distributed, the standard deviation provides information on the proportion of observations above or below certain values. For example, the average height for adult men in the United States is about 70inches (177.8cm), <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> of around 3inches (7.62cm). This means that most men (about 68%, assuming a normal distribution) have a height within 3inches (7.62cm) of the mean (67–73inches (170.18–185.42cm))one standard deviationand almost all men (about 95%) have a height within 6inches (15.24cm) of the mean (64–76inches (162.56–193.04cm))two standard deviations. If the standard deviation were zero, then all men would be exactly 70inches (177.8cm) tall. If the standard deviation were 20inches (50.8cm), then men would have much more variable heights, with a typical range of about 50–90inches (127–228.6cm).
