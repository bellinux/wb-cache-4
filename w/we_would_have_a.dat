25|$|Note {{that using}} a {{hierarchical}} system like this (assuming {{it is done}} carefully) changes the intersection computational time from a linear dependence {{on the number of}} objects to something between linear and a logarithmic dependence. This is because, for a perfect case, each intersection test would divide the possibilities by two, and <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> binary tree type structure. Spatial subdivision methods, discussed below, try to achieve this.|$|E
25|$|Picture {{a series}} of water pipes, fitting into a network. Each pipe is of a certain diameter, so it can only {{maintain}} a flow of {{a certain amount of}} water. Anywhere that pipes meet, the total amount of water coming into that junction must be equal to the amount going out, otherwise we would quickly run out of water, or <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> buildup of water. We have a water inlet, which is the source, and an outlet, the sink. A flow would then be one possible way for water to get from source to sink so that the total amount of water coming out of the outlet is consistent. Intuitively, the total flow of a network is the rate at which water comes out of the outlet.|$|E

500|$|Smith {{was one of}} {{the loudest}} voices of white dissent against the new constitution. He opposed its {{splitting}} of the heretofore non-racial, qualified electorate into graduated [...] "A" [...] and [...] "B" [...] rolls, saying the proposed system had [...] "racialist" [...] connotations, and objected to the idea that the first black MPs would be elected on what he said would be a [...] "debased franchise". [...] "Our policy in the past has always been that <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> government, in Rhodesia, based on merit and that people wouldn't worry whether you were black or whether you were white," [...] he said. He also pointed out that the document did not actually guarantee Southern Rhodesian independence in the event of Federal dissolution. At the UFP vote on the constitution on 22 February 1961, Smith was the only member out of 280 to vote against it. Deeply disillusioned by these developments, he resigned from the UFP soon after to sit in the Federal Assembly as an independent. He lent his support to the [...] "United Group", an awkward coalition wherein Winston Field's conservative Dominion Party closed ranks with Sir Robert Tredgold and other liberals against the constitutional proposals, despite opposing them for totally contradictory reasons. The black nationalist leaders initially endorsed the constitution, signing the draft document, but almost immediately repudiated it and called for blacks to boycott elections held under it. A referendum of the mostly white electorate approved the new constitution by a majority of 65% on 26 July 1961.|$|E

"I am {{charged in}} this case with {{publishing}} and distributing a paper known as The Revolutionary Age, in which paper was printed a document known as the Left Wing Manifesto and Program. It is held that that document advocates the overthrow of government by force, violence, and unlawful means. The document itself, the Left Wing Manifesto, is a broad analysis of conditions, economic conditions, and historical events in the world today. It is a document based upon the principles of socialism from their earliest inception. The only thing that the document does is to broaden those principles {{in the light of}} modern events.... The socialists have always maintained that the change from capitalism to socialism would be a fundamental change, that is, <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> complete reorganization of society, that this change would not be a question of reform; that the capitalist system of society would be completely changed and that that system would give way to a new system of society based on a new code of laws, based on a new code of ethics, and based on a new form of government. For that reason, the socialist philosophy has always been a revolutionary philosophy and people who adhered to the socialist program and philosophy were always considered revolutionists, and I as one who maintain that, {{in the eyes of the}} present day society, I am a revolutionist." ...|$|E
