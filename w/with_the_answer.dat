5|$|Steve, the host, {{presents}} {{the audience with}} a puzzle involving Blue, the animated dog... To help the audience unlock the puzzle, Blue leaves behind a series of clues, which are objects marked {{with one of her}} paw prints. In between the discovery of the clues, Steve plays a series of games — mini-puzzles — with the audience that are thematically related to the overall puzzle... As the show unfolds, Steve and Blue move from one animated set to another, jumping through magical doorways, leading viewers on a journey of discovery, until, {{at the end of the}} story, Steve returns to the living room. There, at the climax of the show, he sits down in a comfortable chair to think — a chair known, of course, in the literal world of Blue's Clues, as the Thinking Chair. He puzzles over Blue's three clues and attempts to come up <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{first story}} is about the opening of Shiva's third eye when he visits Madurai, {{the capital city of}} the Pandya Kingdom, ruled at that time by Shenbagapandian. Shenbagapandian wants to find the answer to a {{question}} posed by his wife— whether the fragrance from a woman's hair is natural or artificial— and announces a reward of 1000gold coins to anyone who can come up <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer.</b> A poor poet named Dharumi desperately wants the reward and starts to break down in the Meenakshi Amman Temple. Shiva, hearing his cries, {{takes the form of a}} poet and gives Dharumi a poem containing the answer. Overjoyed, Dharumi takes the poem to Shenbagapandian's court and recites it, but Nakkeerar, the court's head poet, claims the poem's meaning is incorrect. On hearing this, Shiva argues with Nakkeerar about the poem's accuracy, burning him to ashes when he refuses to relent. Later, Shiva revives Nakkeerar, and says that he only wanted to test his knowledge. Nakkeerar asks the king to give the reward to Dharumi.|$|E

500|$|As customary, {{the game}} {{began with the}} first of two rounds in which contestants {{answered}} questions to earn spins for the [...] "Big Board"; a correct buzz-in answer earned three spins, while a correct multiple-choice answer earned one spin. Larson's memorization of the patterns could not help him here, and he struggled early. On the second question, host Peter Tomarken asked, [...] "You've probably got President Franklin D. Roosevelt in your pocket or purse right now, because his likeness is on the head side". Larson buzzed in at this point and answered, [...] "$50 bill", after which Tomarken finished the question [...] "of what American coin?" [...] <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> being [...] "a dime"; the other choice was [...] "a nickel". He did not buzz in again, answering the last two questions multiple choice and finishing with three spins, behind Long's four and Litras's ten. With the fewest spins, Larson went first. On his first spin, he hit a Whammy; however, on his next two, he hit square #4 for $1,250 and finished the round with $2,500. Long and Litras finished the round without a Whammy and won $4,080 and $4,608, respectively, putting Larson in last place.|$|E

He got Adrian Fisher for that, and he involved him {{in all of the}} political and other activities that he himself was involved in. The Secretary of State always is involved in a lot of controversial things, and here we had the McCarthy era, the attack on the whole concept of Foreign Service and the State Department, and a terrific controversy over what to do about China, who had [...] "lost China." [...] Fisher was always at Acheson's right hand when he was dealing with other people about these things. Wherever he went, Fisher's office was backstopping him, getting all the necessary background information so he'd be prepared for any kind of question that came up. Of course, Acheson's own approach to being Secretary of State was such that when you took an agreement to him to be signed, his chief question was [...] "By what authority do I sign this?" [...] And whoever brought it to him to get it signed, had to be ready <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> that would satisfy a lawyer -- [...] "by what legal authority" [...] -- as well as what it provides and so forth.|$|E
500|$|Following Casey's eviction, the HouseGuests {{learned that}} the [...] "Cliques" [...] twist had ended, and that all HouseGuests were playing the game as individuals.

For this competition, HouseGuests sat on [...] "graduation caps" [...] suspended in the air while being hit by a foam diploma; the last HouseGuest remaining on their cap would be the new Head of Household. Russell was the winner. Jordan, as part of a twist in the competition, had to select three HouseGuests to be Have-Nots for the week; she chose Jessie, Kevin, and Natalie. Though the two initially had a feud, Jeff and Russell later chose to align with one another. On Day 27, Russell chose to nominate Lydia and Ronnie for eviction, with Ronnie being his main target. Though Russell was adamant about seeing Ronnie evicted that week, Chima, Jessie, and Natalie hoped to see Lydia be evicted instead. When picking players for the Power of Veto competition, Jessie, Kevin, and Michele were selected to compete; Chima was selected to host. On Day 28, HouseGuests competed in the [...] "Vini Vidi Veto" [...] Power of Veto competition. For this competition, HouseGuests had to determine the quantity of an object used to make an object. Each round, HouseGuests could either stay or fold; folding would allow them to continue in the game, but could not get a point whereas the HouseGuest <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> closest to the correct one would earn a point, though the farthest was eliminated. Michele was the winner of the Power of Veto. On Day 30, Michele chose not to use the Power of Veto on either nominee. Following this, Jeff learned that he had won the power of the [...] "Coup d'Etat", in which he could overthrow the Head of Household and make his own nominations on the spot; this power could only be used at the next two evictions, and the current Head of Household and Power of Veto holder were unable to be nominated. On Day 33, Ronnie became the fourth HouseGuest to be evicted from the house in a vote of four to three.|$|E
