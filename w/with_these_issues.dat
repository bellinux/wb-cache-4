5|$|According to Julien Merceron, the Worldwide Technology Director for Square Enix in {{the early}} 2010s, the concept for the new engine was born in 2011 {{while he was in}} the final stages of working on Final Fantasy XIII-2. This was a {{difficult}} period for Square Enix: the project then known as Final Fantasy Versus XIII was hitting technical barriers as it transitioned to open world environments its original Crystal Tools engine could not handle, and Final Fantasy XIV had met with a disastrous launch due to development and technical problems. Faced <b>with</b> <b>these</b> <b>issues,</b> Square Enix decided to bring in former developers from Sega to create new engines for their products, including Luminous Studio. Talking about sharing the engine, Merceron said that he advised the company to avoid sharing between companies or internally between games until the engine had been finalized with the released game: this resulted in Luminous Studio being restricted to what would become Final Fantasy XV during development, while other major next-generation titles would use other outsourced engines.|$|E

The Germans took Staewen to Libya to avoid Chadian authorities. Later, Chad broke diplomatic relations with West Germany and declared Pierre Claustre, who had already left for France, a persona non grata.|$|R
50|$|For Braga, the {{necessity}} to support its population, came from its archbishops, which were preoccupied <b>with</b> <b>these</b> <b>issued</b> {{at least until the}} 16th century. Until the beginning of that century, D. Diogo de Sousa had brought water from Fonte dos Granginhos, in 1531 until Fonte de Santiago and Fonte da Pracinha, while (at the same time) constructing the fountain of Carcova, building a fountain in the Largo do Paço.|$|R
25|$|Most Japanese {{people and}} {{agencies}} have adopted customs to deal <b>with</b> <b>these</b> <b>issues.</b> Address books, for instance, often contain furigana or ruby characters {{to clarify the}} pronunciation of the name. Japanese nationals are also required to give a romanized name for their passport. The recent use of katakana in Japanese media when referring to Japanese celebrities who have gained international fame has started a fad among young socialites who attempt to invoke a cosmopolitan flair using katakana names as a badge of honor. All of these complications are also found in Japanese place names.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} ecumenical councils were convened in the 4th and 5th centuries to deal <b>with</b> <b>these</b> <b>issues.</b> The Council of Ehesus debated {{hypostasis}} (co-existing natures) versus Monophysitism (only one nature) versus Miaphysitism (two natures united as one) versus Nestorianism (disunion of two natures). The 451 Council of Chalcedon was highly influential and marked a key {{turning point in}} the Christological debates that broke apart the church of the Eastern Roman Empire in the 5th century. In Chalcedon the hypostatic union was decreed, namely that Jesus is both fully divine and fully human, making this part of the creed of Orthodox Christianity.|$|E
25|$|Sheikh Abdullah {{has played}} a key role in {{directing}} Ooredoo's growth and its vision of enriching people's lives along the way by using social impact to drive financial performance. By working with widely respected international organisations, Sheikh Abdullah has supported Ooredoo's work across a series of key areas, including the empowerment of women and provision of mobile finance for the unbanked. In March 2014, Sheikh Abdullah was appointed to the World Bank Group Advisory Council on Gender and Development. His appointment is a reflection of Ooredoo's engagement in women's initiatives across its footprint, and also H.E.'s personal engagement <b>with</b> <b>these</b> <b>issues.</b>|$|E

25|$|<b>With</b> <b>these</b> <b>issues</b> pushed aside, {{the negotiators}} in Geneva {{were able to}} {{concentrate}} on moving forward with the Doha Round. After intense negotiations in late July 2004, WTO members reached what {{has become known as}} the (sometimes called the July Package), which provides broad guidelines for completing the Doha round negotiations. The agreement contains a 4-page declaration, with four annexes (A–D) covering agriculture, non-agricultural market access, services, and trade facilitation, respectively. In addition, the agreement acknowledges the activities of other negotiating groups (such as those on rules, dispute settlement, and intellectual property) and exhorts them to fulfill their Doha round negotiating objectives. The agreement also abandoned the 1 January 2005 deadline for the negotiations and set December 2005 as the date for the 6th ministerial to be held in Hong Kong.|$|E
25|$|All {{parts of}} Afghanistan are {{considered}} dangerous due to militant activities. Hundreds of Afghan police are {{killed in the}} line of duty each year. Kidnapping and robberies are also reported. The Afghan Border Police (ABP) are responsible for protecting the nation's airports and borders, especially the disputed Durand Line border, which is often used by members of criminal organizations and terrorists for their illegal activities. A report in 2011 suggested that up to 3 million people were involved in the illegal drug business in Afghanistan. Attacks on government employees may be ordered by powerful mafia groups who reside inside and outside the country. Drugs from Afghanistan are exported to neighboring countries and then to other countries. The Afghan Ministry of Counter Narcotics is tasked to deal <b>with</b> <b>these</b> <b>issues</b> by bringing to justice major drug traffickers.|$|E
500|$|Military {{conflicts}} {{throughout the}} area and an ongoing Allied presence led to food shortages throughout the city, as well as constant blackouts {{and the establishment of}} a curfew. Civilian-run groups attempted to deal with the food shortages but were unable to cope. In an attempt to deal <b>with</b> <b>these</b> <b>issues,</b> Soegijapranata sent a local man, Dwidjosewojo, to the capital at Jakarta– renamed from Batavia during the Japanese occupation– to speak with the central government. Dwidjosewojo met with Prime Minister Sutan Sjahrir, who sent Wongsonegoro to help establish a civilian government, installing Moch. Ikhsan as mayor. The city's government was, however, still unable to handle the crisis, and the major figures in this government were later captured by the Dutch-run Netherlands-Indies Civil Administration ( [...] , or NICA) and imprisoned; Soegijapranata, although he at times harboured Indonesian revolutionaries, was spared.|$|E

500|$|The fountains use {{over one}} million LEDs. [...] The inner surface of each tower uses 147 smaller screens {{with a total of}} 264,480 LED points (each with two red, one blue and two green LEDs). The {{physical}} demands of LED screens, in particular the red, green, and blue long-life light bulbs and the requisite circuitry, created three major challenges: supporting the physical structure, combating heat buildup, and optimizing perceptibility of the display. [...] Plensa had used LED fixtures on previous projects, and thus had some experience <b>with</b> <b>these</b> <b>issues.</b> [...] The LED structure is not supported as a single wall (which would be [...] high), but rather as several segments that are noticeable as visible horizontal bands every few feet: these show where the LED equipment is supported. The heat generated is handled by fans that cool the air at the bottom, that then works its way through the chimney-like tower. Perceptibility was determined to be optimal with LED lights [...] behind the glass.|$|E
500|$|Like its predecessor, many of {{the songs}} on the album have {{political}} and military undertones. However, the opening track [...] "Skin o' My Teeth" [...] was speculated being about suicide, a theme which differs {{from the rest of}} the album. [...] "Symphony of Destruction", with lyrics written by Dave Mustaine, details a story about a regular citizen as the head of a puppet regime, as the country is run by a phantom government. The song was noted by critics for its great social and philosophical impact. [...] "Architecture of Aggression" [...] explores the nature of global conflict; Mustaine revealed that the song was about former Iraq president Saddam Hussein, who was engaged in the Gulf War at the time. [...] "Foreclosure of a Dream" [...] deals with economic concerns and social inequality. According to music critic Eduardo Rivaldivia, [...] "perhaps no other Megadeth song in history deals as directly and soberly" [...] <b>with</b> <b>these</b> <b>issues.</b> The song sampled then-U.S. President George H. W. Bush's infamous [...] "" [...] speech, making a statement about taxation endangering the [...] "American Dream". Billboard praised the track, along with [...] "Symphony of Destruction", for being [...] "socially conscious" [...] and described them as [...] "powerful statements for hard rockers".|$|E
500|$|<b>With</b> <b>these</b> <b>issues,</b> Kavanagh {{argues that}} there {{are likely to be}} consequences. Firstly, if judges replace the text of a statute with the meaning given to it by a single {{minister}} in Parliament, there is a risk that they will attribute a meaning to it which was not supported by the MPs; interpretations, based on the views of ministers, are more likely to reflect the executive's intention than that of Parliament. Kavanagh also suggests that it could impact on the actions of ministers; rather than attempting to specify law through the difficult route of placing it in legislation, they can simply make a statement within Parliament about the legislation's intent. Lord Mackay's worry that this would increase the cost of litigation was also considered; under Pepper, every lawyer must go through every word said in both Houses of Parliament and in the various committees to ensure that they are giving the best advice to their client. Academics have also expressed worry about the reliability of Hansard as a source; [...] "the debate on the Bill is a battle of wits often carried out under extreme pressure and excitement where much more than the passage of this Bill may be at stake. The Ministers supporting it cannot be expected to act as if they were under oath in a court of law".|$|E

2500|$|China inland fish {{production}} before 1963 came {{mainly from}} wild inland fisheries. Since then, wild inland fishery resources have decreased because of overfishing, dam building, land reclamation for agriculture, and industrial pollution. [...] During the 1970s, the annual output of wild inland fisheries {{had dropped to}} 300,000 tonnes per year. [...] In 1978, the government set up organizational structures to deal <b>with</b> <b>these</b> <b>issues,</b> and to stock fish fingerlings in rivers, lakes and reservoirs. This reversed many of the problems, and by 1996 production reached 1.76 million tonnes. However, inland aquaculture has made even bigger gains, and now outstrips production from the wild inland fisheries.|$|E
