50|$|Gas was {{distributed}} throughout the whole theater so, how did the system actually <b>work?</b> <b>Step</b> one is the heating of coal gas in a cast iron cylinder and extracting gas from the coal. This process produced an explosive carbon that was removed simply by turning the cylinder on its side and placing doors on the ends for the carbon's easy removal. Purified gas consisted of hydrogen, methane, carbonic oxide, heavy hydrocarbon, and nitrogen. Gas was stored in tanks called gasometers. Dr. Charles Kugler {{came up with this}} concept and found that carbon was easier to remove from the gas after the gas was extracted from the gasometer.|$|E

In 2006, with the dancer Tamara Ashley, she made 'The Pennine Way: The Legs that Make Us', a durational art project {{in the form of}} a walk, creating a performance lecture about the project for ROAM a weekend of walking at Loughborough University in 2008, and a book published by Brief Magnetics in 2007. With Andrew Brown and Katie Doubleday she instigated the 'Open City' project in 2006, exploring the organisation and control of behaviour in the public realm. Kenyon worked with Deveron Arts in Huntly, Aberdeenshire on the founding of their Walking Institute and completed a commission 'Hielan' Ways' - a long distance walk in the Cairngorns in 2013-14.

And {{much of what they}} say is wrong. My own beliefs have always been to the left, and it gives me no great pleasure to see respected left-wing writers coming in for such criticism.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} an overview about standard representation of product data for better communication and exchange between CAD / CAM systems. For mechanical parts, standard use for {{description of product}} data is ISO 10303 - Product data representation and exchange, also known as STEP. This make possible to use standard data during design, process planning and production stage to integrate CAD and CAM. The main barriers to realizing this concept is most of computer numerical control (CNC) machines, which use ISO 6983 G/M codes language. G/M codes lack the portability because of the following reasons. First it focus only on tool center path rather than machining process, second some vendors use language supplement with their own extensions programme which make it ambiguous. ISO 14649 called as STEP-NC is a new standards which extend STEP standard for NC. STEP-NC replaces G/M codes by remedies the above shortcomings. STEP-NC specifying machining processes rather than machine tool motion, using the concept of working <b>steps.</b> <b>Working</b> <b>steps</b> correspond to high-level machining features and associated process parameters.

40|$|PURPOSE To compare time-efficiency in the {{production}} of implant crowns using a digital workflow versus the conventional pathway. MATERIALS AND METHODS This prospective clinical study used a crossover design that included 20 study participants receiving single-tooth replacements in posterior sites. Each patient received a customized titanium abutment plus a computer-aided design/computer-assisted manufacture (CAD/CAM) zirconia suprastructure (for those in the test group, using digital workflow) and a standardized titanium abutment plus a porcelain-fused-to-metal crown (for those in the control group, using a conventional pathway). The start of the implant prosthetic treatment was established as the baseline. Time-efficiency analysis was defined as the primary outcome, and was measured for every single clinical and laboratory <b>work</b> <b>step</b> in minutes. Statistical analysis was calculated with the Wilcoxon rank sum test. RESULTS All crowns could be provided within two clinical appointments, independent of the manufacturing process. The mean total production time, as the sum of clinical plus laboratory work steps, was significantly different. The mean ± standard deviation (SD) time was 185. 4 ± 17. 9 minutes for the digital workflow process and 223. 0 ± 26. 2 minutes for the conventional pathway (P =. 0001).
