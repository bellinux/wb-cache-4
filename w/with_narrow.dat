5|$|Banksia telmatiaea, {{commonly}} known as swamp fox banksia or rarely marsh banksia, is a shrub that grows in marshes and swamps along the lower west coast of Australia. It grows as an upright bush up to 2m (7ft) tall, <b>with</b> <b>narrow</b> leaves and a pale brown flower spike, which can produce profuse quantities of nectar. First collected in the 1840s, it was not published as a separate species until 1981; as with several other similar species it was previously included in B.sphaerocarpa (Fox Banksia).|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, {{there is}} a unique {{combination}} of traits not in themselves unique. The transverse processes, the side extensions, of the tail are present up to the twenty-eighth vertebra of the series. The transverse processes of the front tail vertebrae are rod-shaped <b>with</b> <b>narrow</b> bases and do not touch the plate formed by the fusion of the processes of the sacral vertebrae. The chevrons, bones pointing to below from the bottom side of the tail vertebrae, have {{the shape of an}} inverted T. The length of the ilium equals, or is greater than, that of the thighbone.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{examine the}} {{relationships}} of retinal vascular caliber with optic disc, macular, and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) characteristics as measured with optical coherence tomography (OCT). Design: Observational cross-sectional study. Methods: This study included a subset of healthy children enrolled in the Singapore Cohort Study of the Risk Factors of Myopia (SCORM). Optic disc, macular, and RNFL morphology were measured with Stratus OCT 3. Digital retinal photography was performed and retinal arteriolar and venular caliber measured using validated imaging software. Results: One hundred and four children (mean age 11. 51 ± 0. 52 years; 50 % male) were included. In multivariate analyses, smaller horizontal integrated rim width and rim area were associated <b>with</b> <b>narrower</b> retinal arterioles and venules (all P <. 05), and shorter horizontal rim length was associated <b>with</b> <b>narrower</b> venules (P =. 04). Optic disc diameter {{was not associated with}} arteriolar or venular caliber. Larger vertical cup-to-disc ratios and cup-to-disc-area ratios were associated <b>with</b> <b>narrower</b> venules but not arterioles (P =. 01 and P =. 003, respectively). A thinner average RNFL measurement was associated <b>with</b> <b>narrower</b> arterioles and venules, and smaller total macular volume was associated <b>with</b> <b>narrower</b> venules. Conclusions: Thinner optic disc rims and RNFL measurements were associated <b>with</b> <b>narrower</b> retinal arterioles and venules, and larger cup-to-disc ratios <b>with</b> <b>narrower</b> venules. These findings suggest that retinal vessel caliber varies systematically with morphologic differences in the optic nerve head, retina, and macula. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Instead, the ministry wanted to again consider the Ålgård Line as part of the Sørlandet Line, and proposed that the Ålgård Line be built with standard gauge—which would be used for the Sørlandet Line—instead of the narrow gauge used by the Jæren Line. However, there would be no need for standard gauge until the Sørlandet Line was extended to Rogaland, so the line was planned to be built <b>with</b> <b>narrow</b> gauge track, but all other installations would be prepared for standard gauge.|$|E
5|$|In north-west Nelson, {{there are}} three {{ecotypes}} defined by soil and exposure. Trees growing on limestone bluffs have stiff, blue-green leaves. On the river flats, the trees are tall <b>with</b> <b>narrow,</b> lax, dark green leaves, and an uneven canopy. They resemble the cabbage trees of the North Island's East Cape. Along the coast to the far west, the trees are robust with broad, bluish leaves. The latter two forms extend down the West Coast, with the lax-leaved forms growing in moist, fertile, sheltered river valleys while the bluish-leaved forms prefer rocky slopes exposed to {{the full force of}} the salt-laden coastal winds.|$|E
5|$|Strobilomyces strobilaceus {{is roughly}} similar in {{appearance}} {{because of its}} rough scaly cap and lacerated margin, but may be distinguished from B.ananas by smooth stem without a ring, different spores, and flesh that is less tough.

5|$|The Rhondda Valley {{is located}} in the upland, or Blaenau, area of Glamorgan. The {{landscape}} of the Rhondda was formed by glacial action during the last ice age, as slow moving glaciers gouged out the deep valleys that exist today. With the retreat of the ice sheet, around 8000BC, the valleys were further modified by stream and river action. This left the two river valleys of the Rhondda <b>with</b> <b>narrow,</b> steep sided slopes which would dictate the layout of settlements from early to modern times.|$|E
5|$|The Salvation Army {{gave the}} castle to the Ministry of Works in 1948, {{and it is}} now owned by English Heritage, classed as a {{scheduled}} monument and a Grade I listed building. Subsidence and landslips have continued; the north-east tower largely collapsed in the 1950s, and further major slippages occurred in 1969, 1970, and 2002.

5|$|A 2011 study {{proposed}} the following treatment. The long-tailed birds from the Tibetan Plateau {{with a narrow}} white throat patch are separated as Salim Ali's swift, A. salimali, the small swifts <b>with</b> <b>narrow</b> white rumps from the Himalayas of India, Nepal and Bhutan become Blyth's swift, A. leuconyx, and the population that breeds in limestone caves in northern Southeast Asia, characterised by a green iridescence and shallow tail fork, is split as Cook's swift, A. cooki. The remaining subspecies are the nominate A. p. pacificus and the southern race A. p. kurodae (which includes the Tibetan population formerly named as kanoi). This arrangement has been accepted by the International Ornithological Committee (IOC), but not the International Union for Conservation of Nature. A 2012 paper showed that cooki {{is closely related to}} the dark-rumped swift, A. acuticauda, which should therefore be included in the pacificus clade, but made no further taxonomic recommendations.|$|E
5|$|In {{anticipation}} of the areas surrounding the bridge becoming prosperous suburbs, tolls were set at relatively high rates on a sliding scale, ranging from a penny for pedestrians to 2s6d for vehicles drawn by six horses. Exemptions were granted for mail coaches, soldiers on duty and parliamentary candidates during election campaigns. However, {{the area around the}} bridge failed to develop as expected. In 1815 John Doulton built the Doulton & Watts (later Royal Doulton) stoneware factory at Vauxhall, and consequently instead of the wealthy residents anticipated by the company, the area began to fill <b>with</b> <b>narrow</b> streets of working class tenements to house the factory's workers. Meanwhile, the large Millbank Penitentiary was built near the northern end of the bridge, discouraging housing development. Consequently, toll revenues were initially lower than expected, and the dividends paid to investors were low.|$|E

5|$|Injection {{moulding}} {{consists of}} the high pressure injection of the raw material into a mould which shapes the polymer into the desired shape. Moulds can be of a single cavity or multiple cavities. In multiple cavity moulds, each cavity can be identical and form the same parts or can be unique and form multiple different geometries during a single cycle. Moulds are generally made from tool steels, but stainless steels and aluminium moulds are suitable for certain applications. Aluminium moulds are typically ill-suited for high volume production or parts <b>with</b> <b>narrow</b> dimensional tolerances, as they have inferior mechanical properties and {{are more prone to}} wear, damage, and deformation during the injection and clamping cycles; however, aluminium moulds are cost-effective in low-volume applications, as mould fabrication costs and time are considerably reduced. Many steel moulds are designed to process well over a million parts during their lifetime and can cost {{hundreds of thousands of dollars}} to fabricate.|$|E
5|$|Leccinum manzanitae {{mushroom}} {{produce a}} cinnamon-brown spore print. Spores are 13–17 by 4–5.5µm, somewhat elliptical to cylindrical, and tapered on each end (fusoid); their walls are smooth and moderately thick. The spore-bearing cells, the basidia, are 27–32 by 6–9µm, club-shaped to pear-shaped (pyriform) and four-spored. The cystidia are 23–32 by 4–6µm, fusoid to club-shaped <b>with</b> <b>narrow,</b> elongated apices. Caulocystidia (found on the stipe surface) are thin-walled, club-shaped to somewhat fusoid, and sometimes {{end in a}} sharp point; they measure 35–45 by 9–14µm. Clamp connections are absent in the hyphae of Leccinum manzanitae. The hyphae of the cap cuticle are arranged {{in the form of}} a trichoderm (wherein the outermost hyphae emerge roughly parallel, perpendicular to the cap surface).|$|E
5|$|Most of the cultivars {{brought into}} {{cultivation}} in Australia {{in the latter}} part of the 20th century are perennials. 'Dargan Hill Monarch' was the first of these, and many more have followed. Profusely flowering, these grow in many colours including white, yellow, orange, bronze, pink, and red. Their commercial lifespans are generally around three years. Queensland-based company Aussie Winners has a range of compact plants ranging from orange to white known as Sundaze. Plants of this series usually have larger leaves. This range won the Gran premio d'oro at the Euroflora exposition in Geneva in 2001, for the best new plant series in the previous three years. 'Florabella Gold', a member of the Florabella series, won the award for best new pot plant (vegetative) in the Society of American Florists' competition of 1999. The Wallaby cultivars are range of taller forms <b>with</b> <b>narrow</b> leaves and white, yellow or pink flowers. Other commercial ranges include the Nullarbor series, and Queensland Federation daisies, including 'Wanetta Sunshine' and 'Golden Nuggets'.|$|E

5|$|Myotis alcathoe is a {{rare species}} <b>with</b> <b>narrow</b> {{ecological}} requirements. According to {{a study in the}} Czech Republic, the diet of Myotis alcathoe mostly consists of nematoceran flies, but caddisflies, spiders, small lepidopterans, and neuropterans are also taken. The presence of spiders in the diet suggests that the species gleans prey from foliage. It forages mainly high in the canopy and over water, and is often found in dense vegetation. The parasitic mite Spinturnix mystacina has been found on M.alcathoe, and the mites on M.alcathoe, M.brandtii, and M.mystacinus are genetically closely related. The bat fly Basilia mongolensis nudior has been recorded on M.alcathoe in Thuringia and the tick Ixodes vespertilionis in Romania. When caught, individuals of M.alcathoe are much calmer than M.mystacinus or M.brandtii.|$|E
5|$|Siting of the Ålgård Line from Ganddal to Ålgård {{started in}} 1920. The final cost {{estimate}} was NOK2.82 million {{and the plan}} was passed by Parliament on 20 July 1921, with construction commencing on 21 December. The construction was organized by Just Broch and led by Olaf Bakke. Between 200 and 250 people worked on the line during construction. Because of the recession, the railway works were seen as way to create jobs. Most of the workers came from Stavanger and nearly all had families to support. The first train to operate on the line went from Stavanger on 20 December 1924, with the official opening by Minister of Labour Lars Oftedal taking place when it reached Ålgård. The line became the last state-owned railway in Norway to be opened <b>with</b> <b>narrow</b> gauge.|$|E
5|$|The Clearfield-McIntyre Syncline {{runs through}} the western {{lower part of the}} Kettle Creek {{watershed}} in a southwest-to-northeast direction. North of this syncline lies the Wellsboro Anticline. South of it lies the Hyner Dome. A set of fractures in the watershed causes the tributary Huling Branch to have a straight and narrow valley and for Kettle Creek itself to make a sharp 90-degree turn near the mouth of the tributary Twomile Run. Lateral bars that are nearly or completely devoid of vegetation can be found throughout the main stem of Kettle Creek. In the southern reaches of the watershed, where Pennsylvanian-epoch sandstones are located, the creek flows through steep valleys <b>with</b> <b>narrow</b> floodplains. In the central and northern reaches of the watershed, the main rocks are Mississippian and Devonian rocks. This part of the watershed is characterized by wider floodplains, less steep valleys, and some plateaus, enabling agricultural and residential development to a limited extent. Several miles upstream of the Alvin R. Bush Dam, the creek makes two 180-degree turns. This may eventually cause an oxbow lake to form.|$|E
