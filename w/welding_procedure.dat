5|$|While the {{aerospace}} industry {{is one of the}} primary users of gas tungsten arc welding, the process is used {{in a number of other}} areas. Many industries use GTAW for welding thin workpieces, especially nonferrous metals. It is used extensively in the manufacture of space vehicles, and is also frequently employed to weld small-diameter, thin-wall tubing such as those used in the bicycle industry. In addition, GTAW is often used to make root or first-pass welds for piping of various sizes. In maintenance and repair work, the process is commonly used to repair tools and dies, especially components made of aluminum and magnesium. Because the weld metal is not transferred directly across the electric arc like most open arc welding processes, a vast assortment of welding filler metal is available to the welding engineer. In fact, no other welding process permits the welding of so many alloys in so many product configurations. Filler metal alloys, such as elemental aluminum and chromium, can be lost through the electric arc from volatilization. This loss does not occur with the GTAW process. Because the resulting welds have the same chemical integrity as the original base metal or match the base metals more closely, GTAW welds are highly resistant to corrosion and cracking over long time periods, making GTAW the <b>welding</b> <b>procedure</b> of choice for critical operations like sealing spent nuclear fuel canisters before burial.|$|E
5000|$|In Europe, the European Committee for Standardization (CEN) {{has adopted}} the ISO {{standards}} on <b>welding</b> <b>procedure</b> qualification (ISO 15607 to ISO 15614), which replaced the former European standard EN 288.

40|$|<b>Weld</b> <b>procedure</b> {{development}} can require extensive experimentation, in-depth process knowledge, and is {{further complicated by}} the fact that there are often multiple sets of parameters that will meet the weld requirements. Choosing among these multiple <b>weld</b> <b>procedures</b> can be hastened with computer models that find parameters to meet selected weld dimensional requirements while simultaneously optimizing important figures of merit. Software is described that performs this task for CO{sub 2 } laser beam welding. The models are based on dimensionless parameter correlations that are derived from solutions to the moving heat source equations. The use of both handbook and empirically verified thermophysical property values allows OSLW to be extended to many different materials. Graphics displays show the resulting solution on contour plots that can be used to further probe the model. The important figures of merit for laser beam welding are energy transfer efficiency and melting efficiency. The application enables the user to input desired weld shape dimensions, select the material to be welded, and to constrain the search problem to meet the application requirements.

5000|$|In practice, the {{arrangement}} {{had a number}} of disadvantages. Cracks developed in the oil bath casing due to incorrect <b>welding</b> <b>procedure.</b> Condensation caused corrosion, and oil leaked out through inadequate seals, causing wheelslip and fire hazards. Valve timing was highly unpredictable; this has been attributed to chain stretch, although Bulleid claimed that it was allowed for. The chains were replaced as part of a valve and piston examination at around 30,000 to 36,000 mi, by which time they were considerably worn. This wear, in the chain pins and sprockets, could result in an elongation of the chains by as much as 6 in. Bulleid asserted that a slack of 3 in would be absorbed by the chain coming under load, with the remaining valve irregularity corrected by adjusting the cut-off.|$|E

40|$|This study aims {{to provide}} an {{understanding}} of the factors that control weld metal strength and toughness of mechanized field girth welds produced in X 80 and X 100 line pipe steels using a range of pipeline gas metal arc <b>welding</b> <b>procedures.</b> In the investigation of X 80 welds, a series of experimental single and dual torch gas metal arc welds were prepared with three C-Mn-Si wires, which contained additions of Ti, Ni-Ti and Ni-Mo-Ti. The weld metal microstructures, tensile properties, notch toughness, and fracture resistance were evaluated. The results indicate that high weld metal yield strength and good toughness can be achieved. The X 80 single torch welds exhibited higher yield strength but lower toughness compared to the corresponding dual torch welds. For the development and evaluation of <b>welding</b> <b>procedures</b> for mainline girth welding of X 100 pipe, two narrow gap mechanized gas metal arc <b>welding</b> <b>procedures</b> were evaluated with emphasis placed on measurement of the tensile properties. The results show that dramatically different properties (strength and toughness) can be found as a result of differences in energy input, interpass temperature and weld width or offset distance. Additionally, the preliminary tensile testing, which utilized both standard round bar and modified strip tensile specimens, illustrates the potential variation that can occur when assessing all-weld-metal tensile properties of narrow gap pipeline girth welds...|$|R
