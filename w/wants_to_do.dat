5|$|There was {{a simpler}} {{performance}} on tape {{and a more}} difficult one, with Mariah singing out more, with more licks. But we chose a happy medium. The song really calls for not anything really fancy. But she's always fighting the forces inside of her because she's her own devil's advocate. She <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something that's so {{over the top and}} use her talents and the voice she has.

5|$|Homer {{decides to}} take his family to the new sushi bar, The Happy Sumo. After {{sampling}} most of {{the items on the}} menu, he tries sushi made from fugu. The chef in charge is busy making love with Edna, so his apprentice has to slice the fish, of which certain parts are toxic. He tries to do it carefully, but Homer becomes impatient, only to have it served and become unsure if the poisonous portions have been removed. Homer considers it a treat, but the chef soon returns and believes that the fish has not been prepared correctly and tells Homer that he may have been poisoned. Homer and Marge go to the hospital, where Dr. Hibbert informs Homer that based on a chat he had with the sushi chef, Homer is found out that he has increased likeliness of death and has 22 hours left to live. At night with Marge by his side, he decides not to tell his children about the bad news and makes {{a list of all the}} things he <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> before death.|$|E
5|$|On DS9, Sisko informs Nog that he {{will not}} give him a {{recommendation}} as he has concerns that it is a scheme. Nog confesses that he <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it so that he doesn't turn out like his father Rom (Max Grodénchik), whom he describes as an engineering genius but his culture won't let him pursue it. Sisko, stunned by this confession of a Ferengi having such upstanding ambitions, responds by agreeing to recommend Nog to the Academy. Odo is suspicious of Kira's responses and points a phaser at her, demanding to know who she is. Kira and the crystal suddenly morph into the female Founder (Salome Jens), who reveals that she stole the Maquis ship and she was hoping to convince Odo to return to the Dominion. She reveals the location of the real Kira and transports away. Odo finds Kira and tells her of the Founder, but not of his feelings for her.|$|E
5|$|The anime {{adaptation}} shows Deep Blue as a voice {{coming from}} a blue light, to whom Kisshu gives progress reports, and a shadowed version of his true form is seen when Quiche brings him some mew aqua in episode twenty-six. His death is changed in the anime to come {{at the hands of}} Mew Ichigo rather than Masaya, though Masaya aids her by taking over the body. To keep the true identity of Deep Blue a secret, his voice actor's name is shown only as a question mark until his identity is revealed in episode forty-nine; after which the credits are changed to list Megumi Ogata (who also voices Masaya and the Blue Knight). Deep Blue {{is one of the few}} characters whose name remains unchanged in the Mew Mew Power dub. The anime slightly modified his role from that of a savior for the aliens to a destructive force that <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> nothing but destroy the Earth which causes the aliens to turn against him.|$|E

25|$|Halakha (Jewish law) {{generally}} {{allows for}} divorce. The document of divorce is termed a get. The final divorce ceremony involves the husband giving the get document into {{the hand of}} the wife or her agent, but the wife may sue in rabbinical court to initiate the divorce. In such a case, a husband may be compelled to give the get, if he has violated any of his numerous obligations; this was traditionally accomplished by beating and or monetary coercion. The rationale was that since he was required to divorce his wife due to his (or her) violations of the contract, his good inclination desires to divorce her, and the community helps him to do what he <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> anyway. In this case, the wife {{may or may not be}} entitled to a payment.|$|E
25|$|Leon {{arrives in}} the show's setting of Albert Square as a new student at Walford High School, and Peter Beale (Thomas Law) is to be his 'buddy'. Peter's sister Lucy (Melissa Suffield) takes a big liking to Leon and holds a party in 89b George Street so she can spend time with him. The party turns to chaos and Lucy and Leon get {{everyone}} out by saying the police are outside. Leon offers to help Lucy clean up and asks her to join {{in a game of}} Twister with him. As they are playing, a condom falls out Lucy's pocket. Leon sees it and says {{he did not want to}} take advantage of her. However, she kisses him passionately, which leads to sex. After they have sex, Leon receives a text message and gets dressed but asks if Lucy <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it again. Lucy says yes, but after appears disturbed.|$|E
25|$|While Poe herself {{admitted}} that her biggest {{strength in the}} campaign was her surname, she also conceded {{that it would be}} insufficient for her to be elected simply on that alone, emphasizing that her platform {{is just as important as}} her name in getting her elected to the Senate. She also dismissed claims that her candidacy was her family's revenge against her father's loss in 2004, saying that all she <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is serve should she be elected to the Senate. A day after the election, Poe was announced as among the winners with her having the highest number of votes. She was officially proclaimed a senator by the COMELEC board on May 2013, along with fellow Team PNoy candidates Chiz Escudero, Sonny Angara, Alan Peter Cayetano, and Loren Legarda, as well United Nationalist Alliance candidate Nancy Binay (who did not attend, opting instead to send her lawyer to represent her).|$|E

25|$|Wolfe dispatches Archie Goodwin {{to secure}} {{a copy of the}} final riddles and their answers for Wolfe's reference, and {{proceeds}} to interview each of the contestants: Gertrude Frazee, the leader of an anti-cosmetics women's group who has been using her members to find the answers for the riddles to try and embarrass the cosmetics industry; Carol Wheelock, a housewife who wants the prize money {{to secure a}} better life for her family; Harold Rollins, a condescending academic who entered the competition as part of an intellectual exercise; Susan Tescher, a magazine editor who <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> a profile on Wolfe himself; and Philip Younger, a retiree seeking to recover a fortune he lost during the Great Depression. Although skeptical that Wolfe is only investigating the theft and not the murder, Inspector Cramer shares what the police have learned about the case so far. Other than the financial motive, none of the contestants appears to have had any serious reason or opportunity to either murder Dahlmann or steal the answers, and much to Archie's concern Wolfe's investigation appears to lose energy and focus.|$|E
25|$|After {{finishing}} elementary school, {{students are}} obliged to take one year in high school. They are able to pick from Gymnasium, which {{is seen as the}} highest level of high-school education and usually considered as a preparatory school for attending a university, although anyone can apply to any university. Besides Gymnasiums, Slovakia has specialised high schools with bacalaureat and specialised highschools without bacalaureat. Schools with bacalaureat take 5 years to complete while the ones without usually take less. Gymnasiums and many other high schools require passing an entry exam, consider previous study results or perform a combination of both before accepting a new student. A student may apply to two high schools at once. If student fails to get accepted in any high school, the student can submit an appeal or seek a third high school with an empty slot for one more student outside of the standard application process. Parents and students prefer to avoid this uncertainty and tend to choose at least one high school with a high chance of acceptance. Most high-schools are finished by passing a matura exam, which consists of Slovak language and literature, one foreign language and one specialised subject. If school offered multiple specializations or taught multiple foreign languages, student may choose which subject he or she <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the matura exam in. If student wants and the school allows it, it's possible to do matura exam in more than three subjects.|$|E
25|$|It {{starts with}} Polka, {{a young girl}} that has magic, which means {{she is going to}} die soon. One day, after being {{rejected}} by the citizens of Ritardando, because average people think the magic disease is contagious, she decides that she <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something with her life before it ends. The initial party wants to find out why the mineral powder is so cheap compared to the floral powder and to stop the mining of Mt. Rock to acquire it because the mining damages Agogo Forest. As they progress, the party learns that the mineral powder has fatal side effects that would aid Forte's insurrection against its enemy, Baroque. Realising this, the party heads for Forte, but are stopped and taken into the Forte dungeon because Forte was alerted to the planned arrival of the rebellion group, Andantino. Shortly after escaping, the party unites with Andantino and are spotted by the same Forte personnel south of Fort Fermata (which is a short walk from Forte), and fall off a bridge into a river. Half of the party, along with Andantino, go through poisonous swamps to Andante, the hideout of Andantino. The other half of the party were saved by Prince Crescendo of Baroque, with his ship. They encounter pirates and defeat them shortly thereafter. After getting safely into Baroque, the party discuss the situation. Forte is threatening a war, but Baroque wants peace. Crescendo thinks of the plan to assassinate Count Waltz of Forte, but the plan is quickly discarded.|$|E

5000|$|A key {{component}} of the HighScope approach is the plan-do-review sequence. Children first plan what materials they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> work with, what they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> and whom they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it with (this can be done formally or informally in small groups). Once {{they have made a}} plan, however vague, of what they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> they can go and do it. Then, after this chosen worktime, the children discuss what they did and whether it was the same as, or different from, what they had planned.|$|R

25|$|Several {{months after}} her presumed death, Ryan {{receives}} a champagne flute from Greenlee. Realizing {{that no one ever}} actually identified the body, he comes to believe that Greenlee is still alive. In November 2009, Ryan discovers Greenlee's medical records on David's computer, who claims he was using them for research into Amanda Dillon's pregnancy. It is later revealed that David has been keeping Greenlee in Massachusetts while she recovers. Greenlee has been comatose for the past year and has no memory of the accident. Upon her awakening, David tells Greenlee that she is paralyzed and if she does not have surgery to fix her spine, she will remain paralyzed {{for the rest of her}} life. She tells David that she <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the surgery, but if she dies during surgery, not to tell anybody that she was alive before her death. After successfully recovering from her injuries, Greenlee attempts to visit Ryan but is surprised to see him having sex with Erica Kane. Out for revenge, Greenlee asks David to bring her a hard-drive hidden in Ryan's house. She puts the hard-drive into Fusion's computer and it crashes all the files. Even with Fusion's files being lost, Erica is set out to build Fusion back up once again; during an interview, she tells reporters that whoever crashed Fusion's computers has not destroyed the company. Greenlee feels that she has not done enough and decides to stay in Pine Valley. Greenlee asks David to marry her, hoping that when she walks down the aisle at her wedding, everyone will be surprised, and that Ryan will be hurt.|$|E
