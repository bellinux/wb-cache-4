5|$|It {{must seem}} {{to the reader}} that this Colonel Beriah Norton was a traitor to his own people, but <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>do</b> but give in to Grey's command! Grey had the force and the power and could have {{destroyed}} the towns on the island in half a day, and would have done so if they had resisted in any way. In the diary, September 12th and 13th are omitted. Those were {{the days when the}} British troops were ravaging the island from Edgartown to Gay Head.|$|E
60|$|But <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>do?</b> In actual cash Mother and he {{had less}} than seven dollars in the world.|$|E
60|$|<b>What</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>do?</b> Talk it {{over with}} Soames? That would only make matters worse. And, after all, {{there was nothing in}} it, he felt sure.|$|E
60|$|And an obstinacy in him {{made him}} {{put his arm}} round her and draw her to the shadow. She submitted: let him try <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do.</b> Let him try <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do.</b> <b>He</b> leaned {{against the side of}} the stack, holding her. The stack stung him keenly with a {{thousand}} cold, sharp flames. Still obstinately he held her.|$|R
60|$|<b>What</b> else <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>do?</b> Not even to God's elect {{does the}} sky always send down manna.|$|R
60|$|<b>What</b> else <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>do?</b> <b>He</b> locked them in, and was, {{through the}} failure of the man, in a quandary which made clear {{reflection}} necessary—and impossible.|$|R
6000|$|Scoutbush was {{honestly}} shocked. Who {{would have}} dreamed it? No {{one had ever}} {{told him that the}} cholera had really been there before. <b>What</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>do?</b> Send for Thurnall? ...|$|E
60|$|Again, <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>do</b> by way {{of earning}} a living? He did not {{know much about the}} City and its ways, but he knew enough to {{understand}} that summary dismissal from a bank is not the best recommendation one can put forward in applying for another job. And if he did not get another job in the City, <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>do?</b> If it were only summer, he might get taken on somewhere as a cricket professional. Cricket was his line. He could earn his pay at that. But it was very far from being summer.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>do</b> {{better than}} disappear? I suppose I {{shall have to}} make him an {{allowance}} some of these days, and if he can live and keep himself dark I will do so." ...|$|E
60|$|Neither paupers nor poachers abounded in Hillside; {{the natives}} were chiefly tenants and {{employed}} on the property, and, between good management and beneficence, {{there was little}} real want and much friendly confidence and affection; and thus, in spite of surrounding riots, Hillside seemed {{likely to be an}} exception, proving <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>done</b> by rightful care and attention. Nor indeed did the attack come from thence; but the two parsons were bitterly hated by outsiders beyond the reach of their personal influence and benevolence.|$|R
6000|$|... "Still, isn't that {{a trifle}} unreasonable? <b>What</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> have <b>done</b> that <b>he</b> hasn't <b>done?</b> <b>He</b> was ill and worn out, but he wouldn't even stay {{a day after}} he got the money." ...|$|R
60|$|STEPHEN. <b>What</b> <b>could</b> they <b>do?</b> <b>He</b> <b>does</b> not {{actually}} break the law.|$|R
6000|$|Captain Horn {{gave up the}} {{treasure}} as lost. The Dunkery Beacon was probably shaping her course for the coast of Africa, {{and even if he}} had a swifter vessel and could overhaul her, <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>do?</b> ...|$|E
6000|$|Then {{the king}} {{went to his}} chief adviser and asked <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>do.</b> And the chief adviser bade him to give another ball, {{and this time he}} said, [...] "Give it to poor as well as rich." ...|$|E
6000|$|There was {{bitterness}} in poor Ian's spirit, for {{grizzly bears}} {{were not to}} be fallen in with every day, and it might be that he would never have another opportunity. Even if he had, <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>do?</b> ...|$|E
6000|$|Petru did {{not know}} what to <b>do.</b> <b>He</b> listened in silence for the most part, but now and then he would say, 'Yes, yes, you must have been badly treated,' just for politeness' sake; <b>what</b> more <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>do?</b> ...|$|R
6000|$|I was {{astonished}} {{that she should}} dare before Jacobus. Yet <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> have <b>done</b> to repress her? He needed her too much. He raised a heavy, drowsy glance for an instant, then looked down again. She insisted with shrill finality: ...|$|R
60|$|DAVID. That's how I like to {{hear you}} speak. A young Scotsman of your ability let loose upon the world with L300, <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> not <b>do?</b> It's almost appalling to think of; {{especially}} if he went among the English.|$|R
6000|$|... "He is here," [...] {{the bishop}} knew, [...] "because {{he could not}} avoid coming. He tried to excuse himself. His mother wept. <b>What</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>do?</b> But the church's {{teaching}} nowadays fails even to grip the minds of boys." ...|$|E
6000|$|Jack replies, {{he had no}} {{design to}} mutiny, but the second mate drew him in, {{and he did not}} know what to do, he wished he had not meddled; he knew he was undone; but now <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>do?</b> ...|$|E
6000|$|Captain Hedzoff rode {{away when}} King Padella uttered this cruel command, having done his duty in {{delivering}} the message with which his royal master had entrusted him. Of {{course he was}} very sorry for Rosalba, but <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>do?</b> ...|$|E
60|$|So Scoutbush begged humbly of Thurnall only to {{tell him}} <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Then the Marquis {{drew his}} head in again, and went on with his dressing. <b>What,</b> indeed, <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>do</b> himself if the man were {{to appear on the}} scene, and if his {{daughter}} should declare herself willing to go off with him? ...|$|R
2500|$|I {{was very}} fond of Kenny as an actor, {{although}} he wasn't particularly versatile. <b>What</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do,</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> very well. His strengths were his ability to portray charm; basically he was the officer returning from the war and he was superb {{in that kind of}} role. The minute that kind of role went out of existence, he began to go down as a box office star." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{smiled and}} looked foolish, and {{declared}} that he only offered his assistance because perhaps it might be convenient at the present moment. <b>What</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>do</b> for her? How could he show his friendship for her now at once? ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>What</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>do?</b> He was committed--Cyril {{only knew}} how deeply. What might not the wily {{archbishop}} have discovered? What might not he pretend to have discovered? What accusations might he not send {{off on the}} spot to the Byzantine Court? ...|$|E
60|$|And <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>do?</b> Nothing. There was {{literally}} no way out. His mind {{went back to}} the night when he had saved Wyatt by a brilliant coup. The most brilliant of coups could effect nothing now. Absolutely and entirely the game was up.|$|E
6000|$|There was a {{very good}} little boy once who wanted to go to sea. And the captain asked him <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do.</b> <b>He</b> said <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> the multiplication-table {{backward}} and paste sea-weed in a book; that he knew how many times the word [...] "begat" [...] occurred in the Old Testament; and could recite [...] "The Boy Stood on the Burning Deck" [...] and Wordsworth's [...] "We Are Seven." ...|$|R
6000|$|He took counsel with himself. Should he [...] "chuck" [...] the outfitting? It wasn't {{any good}} for him now, and {{presently}} when he was older and his youthful smartness had passed into the dulness of middle age it would be worse. <b>What</b> else <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>do?</b> ...|$|R
50|$|Byrd {{then told}} him that all his men were hired, but that he would see <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do.</b>|$|R
6000|$|The {{first time}} that Peter deniéd his Lord [...] He had neither the Throne, nor the Keys nor the Sword-- [...] A poor silly fisherman, <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>do</b> [...] When the cock crew--when the cock crew-- [...] But weep for his wickedness when the cock crew? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You shall {{always have}} that," [...] {{she told him}} with shining eyes, [...] "always, always." [...] And <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>do</b> but look at her with the wonder and the awe that come to every man who, for one moment in his life, knows a woman well? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think it}} is clear enough. You came back by an {{unexpected}} way, and so he had no warning until {{you were at the}} very door. <b>What</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>do?</b> He caught up everything which would betray him, and he rushed into your bedroom to conceal himself." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> {{wondered}} <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> {{with all}} of it, and speculated as to whom <b>he</b> <b>could</b> give it away.|$|R
50|$|Knapp {{could neither}} persuade local farmers {{to adopt the}} {{techniques}} he had perfected on his farm nor enlist farmers from the North {{to move to the}} region to serve collectively as a sort of educational catalyst. <b>What</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do,</b> <b>he</b> reasoned, was to provide incentives for farmers to settle in each township with the proviso that each, in turn, would demonstrate to other farmers <b>what</b> <b>could</b> be done by adopting his improved farming methods.|$|R
6000|$|Then Granville, too, {{was bound}} for the diamond fields like himself. What an {{incredible}} coincidence! How strange! How inexplicable! That rich man's son, the pampered heir to Tilgate! <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>HE</b> be <b>doing</b> here, in this out-of-the-way spot, this last resort of poor broken-down men, this miserable haunt of wretched gambling money-grubbers? ...|$|R
