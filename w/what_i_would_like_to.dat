I was in prison for almost 15 years. I have reflected a great deal over it, and I understand that violence did harm to society; I understand it and I regret that I participated in it.

People from the bourgeois sphere were altogether without appeal or interest. All middle-class life seemed pedantic to me. On the other hand, I felt the proletariat had guts.

But <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> emphasize once more is that compassion and commiseration were at first of very little importance in attracting me to the representation of proletarian life; what mattered was simply that I found it beautiful." ...|$|E

2500|$|In January 2008, Kaz Hirai, CEO of Sony Computer Entertainment, {{suggested}} that the console may start making a profit by early 2009, stating that, [...] "the next fiscal year starts in April {{and if we can}} try to achieve that in the next fiscal year that would be a great thing" [...] and that [...] " [...] is not a definite commitment, but that is <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> try to shoot for". However, market analysts Nikko Citigroup have predicted that PlayStation 3 could be profitable by August 2008. In a July 2008 interview, Hirai stated that his objective is for PlayStation 3 to sell 150 million units by its ninth year, surpassing PlayStation 2's sales of 140 million in its nine years on the market. In January 2009 Sony announced that their gaming division was profitable in Q3 2008.|$|E
2500|$|Considerable media {{attention}} {{was paid to}} the ideology and pathology of Zehaf-Bibeau. Along with Martin Couture-Rouleau and Justin Bourque, he has been labelled a [...] "lone-wolf terrorist". Couture-Rouleau and Zehaf-Bibeau were [...] "both self-radicalized and adrift in their lives and connected in their sympathy to radical Islamic ideology." [...] Other opinions diverged from simply calling Zehaf-Bibeau a terrorist. Vancouver Sun columnist Ian Mulgrew commented on how the incident, as well as a failed bombing attempt in Victoria by persons motivated similarly to Zehaf-Bibeau, showed 'gaping holes' in the social security net. [...] "These incidents are examples not of Muslim extremism but of the lack of community support for the dysfunctional of any faith who, with a lack of proper attention or the wrong catalyst, become dangerous. I know which approach would make me feel safer, what I would call real security measures: a social safety net that caught those in obvious need before they went postal, people like Zehaf-Bibeau." [...] Green Party leader Elizabeth May said in the House of Commons: [...] "I would put money on these being the acts of isolated, disturbed and deeply troubled men who were drawn to something crazy. I do not believe that it was a vast network, or that the country is more at risk today than it was last week. However, that is my opinion. I can be wrong...I am undoubtedly going to be wrong again, but <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> suggest is that we wait for answers from the police before we make assumptions, and that we speak calmly, truthfully and openly to all Canadians." ...|$|E

On 30 October 1995, five days before his death, Eddington made an appearance with Jeremy Isaacs on the television series Face to Face, discussing his life, career and battle with lymphoma. On that show, Eddington said, [...] "A journalist once asked me <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> my epitaph to be and I said <b>I</b> think <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> it to be 'He did very little harm'.

5000|$|He {{illustrates}} humorous and surreal {{oil paintings}} of strange situations and subjects, explaining, [...] "In my paintings, I {{am interested in}} telling a story. I like the story to be open ended and enigmatic. It should have an internal truth, which the viewer will recognize in his/her own way. As elements in my storytelling, I use symbols and their arrangement. I like everyday objects to have a meaning beyond the obvious, a metaphysical meaning. When I paint I try to keep a balance between my intellect, my intuition and my somewhat humouristic approach. In this way I keep the painting always interesting and alive for me. This is also <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> the painting {{to be for the}} viewer, a stimulating and entertaining puzzle." ...|$|R

40|$|We have to {{describe}} the solar system as it really is and not as we <b>would</b> <b>like</b> it to be’ (‘Pluto Loses Status as a Planet’). These words by Iwan Williams, the chairman of a panel which demoted Pluto to a status of a ‘dwarf planet’ in 2006, invoke so well, though most likely unintentionally, the particular kind of space that I regularly attend as a curator and researcher. As a practitioner at work, curating and researching, I find myself often at the disjuncture so neatly defined by this statement: between the apparent real and the imaginary, between what is and <b>what</b> <b>I</b> hope for. In my practice, this space of separation is between what curating is, how it is defined and practised, and <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> it to be. I find that {{it is through the}} practice that I am able to articulate my desires, through doing it. There it is. This fluency is less present in the writing about it, however. And there I so often mask the fact that I fail, when <b>I</b> pretend that <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> it to be really is. Perhaps one reason for this is the subject of my research which proposes to understand curating in/as common/s. If the common, as Hardt and Negri say (256), is discovered and produced through joyful encounters, then perhaps writing about curating in/as common/s should be also done with others. And so, even as I am writing it now in the solitude of my study, with books and papers scattered around me, with multiple browser windows open, with multiple versions of this paper that I started and never finished, I will attempt to practice the joyful encounter now: an event of encountering texts, words, and people, their ideas and theories, and software and hardware too, though that reminds me that not all is full of joy...|$|R

40|$|Intelligent systems need knowledge. However, {{the simple}} {{equation}} “knowledge is power ” leaves three major questions unanswered.

In particular I will focus on some of the mile-stones in understanding the nature of knowledge and some of what we have learned from 50 years of AI research.
