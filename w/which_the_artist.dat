25|$|The Turner Prize {{is awarded}} {{for a show}} by the artist in the {{previous}} year. When nominees are told of their nomination, they then prepare exhibits for the Turner Prize exhibition, often at short notice.

However, {{it tends to be}} the basis on which public and press judge the artist's worthiness for nomination.|$|E
25|$|A four-meter-high, hundred-meter-long picture lane in <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> {{recalls the}} events of Reichskristallnacht, the actual {{beginning}} of the Holocaust, on 9 November 1938. He confronts the passersby with larger-than-life children's faces lined up in a seemingly endless row, as if for concentration camp selection. Just days into the exhibit, these portraits were vandalized by unknown persons, symbolically cutting the throats of the depicted children's faces. Helnwein consciously left the panels with the gashes and included them into the presentation, because he decided it made the work stronger and more relevant.|$|E
25|$|Before leaving school, {{towards the}} end of 1855, he became {{assistant}} to the painter and professor Louis (Lodewijk) Jan de Taeye, whose courses in history and historical costume he had greatly enjoyed at the Academy. Although de Taeye was not an outstanding painter, Alma-Tadema respected him and became his studio assistant, working with him for three years. De Taeye introduced him to books that influenced his desire to portray Merovingian subjects early in his career. He was encouraged to depict historical accuracy in his paintings, a trait for <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> became known.|$|E

25|$|Van Gogh {{also wrote}} to Wilhelmina {{regarding}} the Portraits of Madame Ginoux he painted first in Arles in 1888 {{and again in}} February 1890 while at the hospital in Saint-Rémy. The second set were styled after the portrait of the same figure by Gauguin, and Van Gogh described Gachet's enthusiasm upon viewing the version painted earlier that year, <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> had carried {{with him to the}} home in Auvers. Van Gogh subsequently carried compositional elements from this portrait to that of Dr. Gachet, including the table-top with two books and pose of the figure with head leaning on one hand.|$|E
25|$|The artists on the Ships and Dip cruises have sailed {{on board}} {{with the rest of}} the {{passengers}} for the duration of the cruises; this contrasts some music cruises on <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> or artists travel separately to one of the cruise destinations and perform there, or join the cruise for only a portion of the trip. Band members have enjoyed other artists' shows and the ship's amenities freely with the other guests. Barenaked Ladies have performed several full shows on each cruise, and the band members also commonly have sat in with other artists at their shows.|$|E
25|$|Certain symbols {{within the}} Aboriginal modern art {{movement}} retain the same meaning across regions although {{the meaning of}} the symbols may change {{within the context of a}} painting. When viewed in monochrome other symbols can look similar, such as the circles within circles, sometimes depicted on their own, sparsely, or in clustered groups. Depending upon the tribe of <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> is a member, symbols such as campfire, tree, hill, digging hole, waterhole, or spring can vary in meaning. Use of the symbol can be clarified further by the use of colour, such as water being depicted in blue or black.|$|E

25|$|In 1967, Cuevas {{created a}} mural on a rooftop in Zona Rosa only {{to destroy it}} seconds afterwards. This event was meant to rebel against the social and {{political}} content of most of Mexico’s post-Revoluction mural movement. In 2003, a reproduction of Cuevas’ “ephemeral mural” was placed on the same rooftop on <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> created and destroyed the original. This era of Zona Rosa’s development continued until the 1980s. During this time many galleries, bohemian bars and restaurants opened. The area was considered to be tolerant, intellectual and cosmopolitan. It even had its own literary magazine called Zona Rosa.|$|E
25|$|His first {{works were}} an Odalisque {{inspired}} by the writing of Victor Hugo and a Lélia illustrating George Sand, but he soon abandoned literary influences, choosing instead to base his paintings on observed reality. Among his paintings of the early 1840s are several self-portraits, Romantic in conception, in <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> portrayed himself in various roles. These include Self-Portrait with Black Dog (c. 1842–44, accepted for exhibition at the 1844 Paris Salon), the theatrical Self-Portrait which {{is also known as}} Desperate Man (c. 1843–45), Lovers in the Countryside (1844, Musée des Beaux-Arts, Lyon), The Sculptor (1845), The Wounded Man (1844–54, Musée d'Orsay, Paris), The Cellist, Self-Portrait (1847, Nationalmuseum, Stockholm, shown at the 1848 Salon), and Man with a Pipe (1848–49, Musée Fabre, Montpellier).|$|E
25|$|Like Harrington, other reviewers {{recognize}} that Spybuck possessed a remarkable talent, but it often served a practical {{purpose in the}} domain of ethnography. His paintings served as illustrations for numerous anthropological writings. Dobkins calls this practice autoethnography, in <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> or writer assimilates the techniques of ethnographers to create representations of themselves and their cultures, with the implication of an asymmetrical power relationship between the ethnographer patron and the Native artist. Along with Spybuck, Dobkins names Jesse Cornplanter (Seneca), Peter Pitseolak (Inuit), and Frank Day (Maidu) as artists who practiced autoethnography to regain control over representations of their cultures and to retrieve and preserve their traditions. Other reviewers recognize Spybuck as an Indian artist who is a recorder and preserver of traditional practices in the midst of social change.|$|E
5000|$|Throughout the 1980s, Yves Chaland, Ted Benoit, Serge Clerc and Floc'h relaunched the ligne claire {{style in}} France. This {{incarnation}} {{was a very}} stylistic and artistic variation, <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>artists</b> also utilized for illustrating posters and LP covers etc. Swarte dubbed this variant [...] "atoomstijl" [...] ("atomic style").|$|R
5000|$|... "Silver Wilkinson" [...] {{comes from}} {{the name of a}} salmon fishing fly, <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>artist's</b> girlfriend showed him. It was {{originally}} supposed to be a track title, but he decided to use it for the album's name. Bibio is another type of fishing fly, while <b>the</b> <b>artist's</b> name is Stephen Wilkinson. This gives [...] "Silver Wilkinson" [...] the impression of being a self-titled album.|$|R

25|$|The {{drawings}} {{produced in}} the course of the three years of the artist's life thus absorbed, are notable for showing, apart from a real power of interpreting the local character of each scene, a rare sense of the dramatic, the gift of effective silhouetting being particularly characteristic. We see here well exemplified the profit <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> (who long taught mural painting at Warsaw Academy) derived from his protracted studies of the frescoes in Rome and Assisi. Figure-drawing, of a very incisive kind, inevitably comes much to the fore in scenes which succeed each other on the walls of the exhibition, but many of the impressions of landscape, here displayed, will also remain impressed upon the spectator's memory. Altogether, this is an art very much in the best Polish tradition, and with an individual note definitely its own.|$|E
25|$|Although a {{receptive}} and conscientious {{student at}} the revered École, Seurat had been open to ideas from some more esoteric sources too. In 1879, with his friend, fellow École student, and future portrait-subject Edmond Aman-Jean, Seurat attended the fourth exhibition of paintings from the then very unrevered Impressionist painters, where they duly received an “unexpected and profound shock”. And although Seurat had already seen modern aesthetic theories summarised in Blanc’s Grammaire, he sought out the original texts from the theoreticians themselves, such those of David Sutter, the chemist MichelEugèneChevreul, and the physicist OgdenRood, whose Modern Chromatics was written while Seurat was at the École, and <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> read {{as soon as it}} was translated into French in 1881. Having immersed himself in these authors’ works, Seurat borrowed heavily from their modern theories about colours and the way humans perceive them. These influences allowed Seurat to emerge from the venerable disciplines of the École to fashion his own distinctly modern method of using tone and colour.|$|E
25|$|In this performance, Abramović {{sought to}} re-evoke {{the energy of}} extreme bodily pain, using a large petroleum-drenched star, <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> lit on fire {{at the start of}} the performance. Standing outside the star, Abramović cut her nails, toenails, and hair. When {{finished}} with each, she threw the clippings into the flames, creating a burst of light each time. Burning the communist five-pointed star represented a physical and mental purification, while also addressing the political traditions of her past. In the final act of purification, Abramović leapt across the flames, propelling herself into the center of the large star. Due to the light and smoke given off by the fire, the observing audience did not realize that, once inside the star, the artist had lost consciousness from lack of oxygen. Some members of the audience realized what had occurred only when the flames came very near to her body and she remained inert. A doctor and several members of the audience intervened and extricated her from the star.|$|E
50|$|On 18 March 2011 eight artists {{gathered}} together in Acton Scott, Shropshire, {{to write and}} rehearse the material.

40|$|In {{her essay}} on Mallon's work, Sherlock focuses {{on how the}} {{analytic}} images of science upon <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>artist’s</b> drawings are based are also modes of representation.
