Dubbed the [...] "feminist rant" [...] by media publications, Clair's speech to future son-in-law Elvin about gender roles in marriage in the episode [...] "Cliff in Love" [...] is often lauded {{as one of the}} character's greatest moments, to which the studio audience responded with enthusiastic applause. CNN ranked the rant their seventh favorite The Cosby Show moment. Slates Jason Bailey hailed the scene as [...] "Rashad’s finest moment on the show." [...] The rant has proven so popular that it continues to be frequently quoted and referenced on the Internet and social media. Pastes Shannon M. Houston believes that [...] "If you’re a woman, and you <b>work,</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> identify as a feminist, there’s a 90 percent chance you or someone you know has posted that clip". Additionally, Houston believes that the scene remains so popular because the discussion about women in the workplace has hardly changed since the episode first aired 30 years ago. According to Nico Lang of The Daily Dot, Clair taught an entire generation [...] "what a strong, successful woman looked like". Former United States First Lady Michelle Obama has constantly been compared to Clair, by which Obama admitted she is flattered because she considers the character to be an [...] "American icon". Patrice Evans of Jezebel wrote that although [...] "Michelle Obama might be taking the baton as the quintessential symbol of the professional black woman/doting mother ... she'll still need Barack to win a second term before she can approach the status of Clair Huxtable." [...] However, Rashad herself has discredited the Clair-Obama comparisons. LGBT rights activist Janet Mock cites Clair as one of her biggest influences: [...] "I wanted to be her; I wanted to be beautiful, be successful, and maybe have a great family and a brownstone in Brooklyn." ...|$|E
