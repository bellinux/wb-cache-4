As she <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> leave with Harrison and John and Cynthia Lennon, Riley told them that he had spiked their drinks and tried to persuade them to stay. Outside, Boyd was in an agitated state from the drug and threatened to break a store window, but Harrison pulled her away.

25|$|On May 2, Lee {{met with}} his generals on Clark Mountain, obtaining a {{panoramic}} view of the enemy camps. He realized that Grant <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> attack, but did not know the precise route of advance. He correctly predicted that Grant would cross to the east of the Confederate fortifications on the Rapidan, using the Germanna and Ely Fords, but he could not be certain. To retain flexibility of response, Lee had dispersed his Army over a wide area. Longstreet's First Corps was around Gordonsville, from where they had the flexibility to respond by railroad to potential threats to the Shenandoah Valley or to Richmond. Lee's headquarters and Hill's Third Corps were outside Orange Court House. Ewell's Second Corps was the closest to the Wilderness, at Morton's Ford.|$|E

When the Later Tang forces, after a short rest, <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> march on Daliang, Wang still tried to prevent its advance by falsely stating to the Later Tang emperor that Duan's army (which in reality was trapped north of the Yellow River and {{would not be able to}} come to Daliang's aid) was on its way, the Later Tang emperor executed him. Shortly after, the Later Tang forces captured Daliang; Zhu Zhen committed suicide, and Later Liang was at its end.|$|E

He wrote it from September until February the next year, after which the story was divided among the scenario writers, who wrote the script over the course of three months, from March to May 2002.|$|E
500|$|Panzer Dragoon {{was created}} in the early 1990s as the Japanese video game company Sega <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> release its Saturn console. At the time, the Saturn lacked {{third-party}} games; because of this, Sega had to internally develop games in every genre, including shoot 'em up. In 1993, Sega asked its developers for new game ideas, and it was then that Yukio Futatsugi, a young developer who had joined Sega only two years before, proposed several new concepts. [...] One of these concepts was accepted and became Panzer Dragoon. Futatsugi, then 23 years old, was put in charge of the project and became the head of Team Andromeda, a development team that Sega assembled for the occasion in early 1994 and was built around the duo formed by Futatsugi and Manabu Kusunoki, art designer on the project. Overall, development lasted almost a year, and 15 people worked on the game.|$|E

He later said, [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> do some acoustic shows on a promotional tour for Revelations and I just wanted {{to have fun with}} it." [...] The cover received favorable reviews from critics. MTV noted the [...] "bluesier, more pained and impassioned feel" [...] which stripped away [...] "any pop elements of the original". Los Angeles Times described the track as [...] "a grim, spooky take" [...] on Jackson's [...] "Billie Jean", and added that it was [...] "amusing enough, even if it sounds a lot more like Metallica's 'Nothing Else Matters'". The newspaper concluded that [...] "Jacko's mega hit [...] the stunt translation". In 2008, Cornell's version was performed live by David Cook on the seventh season of American Idol, and this version charted on Billboard's Hot 100 at No. 47. In May of the same year, dance act Signature used [...] "Nachna Onda Nei" [...] on Britain's Got Talent in their audition and again in their final performance. In 2011, Patrick Stump covered the song in an a cappella mash-up tribute to Jackson along with several other songs over pre-recorded backing vocals.|$|E
