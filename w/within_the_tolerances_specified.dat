50|$|As is {{recorded}} in John Stow's Survey of London, a crisis arose when coins minted under Lonyson's direction {{were found to}} be consistently underweight and of less fineness than was prescribed. Lonyson responded that the variances were <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>tolerances</b> <b>specified</b> in his indenture and therefore allowable. The purity of the Elizabethan coinage was a matter of great pride to the government after the debased coinages and consequent inflation of the reigns of Henry VIII and Edward VI, and the matter was taken up {{at the highest levels of}} the government. The Warden, Richard Martin, raised charges against Lonyson for intentionally reducing both weight and fineness by the maximum amounts allowed under the indenture, against prior custom and for personal profit. The matter was finally weighed in 1578 by a commission of Privy Council members including Nicholas Bacon (the Lord Keeper), William Cecil, Lord Burghley (the Lord Treasurer), Sir Christopher Hatton, the Earls of Leicester and Sussex, Sir Francis Walsingham, and Sir Walter Mildmay. The wording of Lonyson's indenture was imprecise, and he avoided conviction. Ultimately the Council required Lonyson to coin only on short-term commissions that quite specifically established the Master's portion of precious metals at a level higher than the intention of the original indenture but lower than Lonyson's practice of 1572-76. Lonyson accepted the new oversight and was cleared of intentional wrongdoing in his prior practice. He continued to serve in the Royal Mint until his death.|$|E

The compensator is designed using optimization technique so that the control system meets the system specifications.

This paper explores an {{automated}} methodology to design eight-bar linkages for five positions, by constraining the user defined 4 R open chain and 6 R closed chain using RR dyads. The application in focus {{is that of}} rectilinear motion. The paper lays down the rules for systematic selection of link pairs {{for the application of}} RR constraints, that help automate the synthesis of eight-bar linkages. The methodology performs a random search <b>within</b> <b>the</b> user <b>specified</b> <b>tolerance</b> zones around <b>the</b> task specifications {{to increase the number of}} candidate linkage solutions. These linkages are then subjected to forward kinematic analysis using the Dixon determinant elimination procedure to find all possible linkage configurations over the range of motion of the input link.

The result is an array of defect-free eight-bars that can perform approximate rectilinear motion. This method provides increased flexibility and control over the synthesized linkage compared to other known rectilinear motion linkages, owing to the ability to specify the backbone chain.

The present isolator has features of compactness, long stroke, and adjustability to various load capabilities. To realize these features, we use constant-force springs, which sustain constant load {{regardless of their}} elongation, and propose a variable ellipse curve mechanism that is inspired by the principle of ellipsographs. The variable ellipse curve mechanism can convert the restoring force of the horizontally placed constant-force springs to the vertical restoring force of the vibration isolator. At {{the same time as}} converting the direction, the vertical restoring force can be adjusted by changing the ratio of the semi-minor axis to the semi-major one of the ellipse. In this study, a prototype of a class of quasi-zero-stiffness vibration isolator with the proposed variable ellipse curve mechanism is created.

A Scotch-Brite grinding wheel, on a pneumatic actuator, was used to grind {{the edges of the}} blades. The objective of this research work was to identify the major factors that influence the accuracy of the process and the final part quality.

30|$|The main {{disadvantage}} of arithmetic tolerancing or worst-case tolerancing {{is that it}} does not follow any trend or pattern <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>tolerance</b> zone and part dimensions resulting from the machining process can possess any value <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>tolerance</b> zone. This results in checking up of each individual dimension for its correctness <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>tolerance</b> zone, which is impractical in mass production. <b>The</b> statistical <b>tolerance</b> overcomes this drawback of arithmetic <b>tolerance</b> and facilitates <b>the</b> machining to yield dimensions according to a normal distribution. Also statistical tolerancing allows some cancellation of variation from normal distribution. Hence, this paper in essence reflects the theme of statistical tolerancing.|$|R
