2500|$|Maggie Smith {{is portrayed}} as an actress who prefers to work from home (or not work at all).

She refused the conventional ceremonial banquet for laureates, asking that its $192,000 cost be given to the poor in India and saying that earthly rewards were important only if they helped her to help the world's needy. When Teresa {{received the}} prize she was asked, [...] "What can <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> promote world peace?" [...] She answered, [...] "Go home and love your family." [...] Building on this theme in her Nobel lecture, she said: [...] "Around the world, not only in the poor countries, but I found the poverty of the West so much more difficult to remove. When I pick up a person from the street, hungry, I give him a plate of rice, a piece of bread, I have satisfied. I have removed that hunger. But a person that is shut out, that feels unwanted, unloved, terrified, the person that has been thrown out from society—that poverty is so hurtable [...] and so much, and I find that very difficult." [...] Teresa singled out abortion as [...] "the greatest destroyer of peace today.

2500|$|The matter {{became the}} object of student protest in 1922, when 6 banned black freshmen, led by a recent alumnus who was {{studying}} at the Business School, protested their exclusion. Lowell wrote this explanation to Roscoe Conkling Bruce, himself an African American Harvard alumnus {{and the father of}} an incoming freshman: [...] "We have not thought it possible to compel men of different races to reside together." [...] Bruce’s lengthy reply underscored the irony of Lowell's position: [...] "The policy of compulsory residence in the Freshman Halls is costly indeed if it is the thing that constrains Harvard to enter open-eyed and brusque upon a policy of racial discrimination." [...] Lowell stood his ground: [...] "It is not a departure from the past to refuse to compel white and colored men to room in the same building. We owe to the colored man the same opportunities for education that <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> the white man; but we do not owe it to him to force him and the white into social relations that are not, or may not be, mutually congenial." [...] He accused Bruce of insisting on a change of policy and employed an argument about minority presence provoking prejudice that he also used about the same time in the Jewish quota dispute. [...] "For the colored man to claim that he is entitled to have the white man compelled to live with him is a very unfortunate innovation which, far from doing him good, would increase a prejudice which, as you and I will thoroughly agree, is most unfortunate and probably growing." ...|$|E
2500|$|On Thursday 18 February, {{the weekly}} lecture {{proceeded}} as usual, {{though it was}} noticed that the congregation were paying {{particular attention to the}} detail of the sermon. However, when the minister finished his last prayer by asking [...] "Lord who hath believed our report; and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed? where are the fruits of my poor labours among this people" [...] several people cried out publicly in response - an event rare in Scottish worship. Afterwards, some 50 people came back in anguish to the manse, expressing a strong conviction of sin and fearing dreadful punishment in the next life. Then began so great an influx of people to Cambuslang that the minister started giving daily sermons and instruction. This lasted for about seven or eight months, until the coming of autumn. Many who attended the sermons were seized with a strong conviction that they were sinners and experienced an horrific sense of future punishment, many [...] "bewailing their lost and undone condition by nature; calling themselves enemies to God, and despisers of precious Christ; declaring that they were unworthy to live {{on the face of the}} earth; that they saw the mouth of hell open to receive them, and that they heard the shrieks of the damned". The most insistent cry was [...] "what shall <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> be saved?" [...] Some beat their breasts and trembled. Many were seized with violent contortions, one woman saying afterwards that it was far worse than the pain of childbirth. Others fainted or bled at the nose. It was noted that the minister, and some of the congregation, encouraged people to give vent to their distress. Those who had been affected often went back to the manse and many spent long nights there in prayer and admonition. They returned to sermon the next day, often bandaged, and sat weeping and moaning in the front row of the congregation, or outside the entrance to the tents. This part of the process [...] of becoming aware of their sinfulness [...] was known as [...] "conviction" [...] and many were convicted. Not all, however, went on to the next stage, that is [...] "conversion". Several were converted, though, and often quite suddenly. They were [...] "raised all at once from the lowest depth of sorrow and distress, to the highest pitch of joy and happiness, crying out with triumph and exultation…that they had overcome the wicked one; that they had gotten hold of Christ!" [...] They often followed this with a joyous appeal to the congregation to pray or sing along with them.|$|E
