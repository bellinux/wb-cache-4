5|$|The {{album cover}} {{consists}} of a cropped Polaroid photograph of two unidentified fans taken at a Sonic Youth show in Amherst, Massachusetts in April 1995, during a short tour undertaken while the album was still in production. The fans are depicted wearing T-shirts that were sold as merchandise during that tour; early in 1995, the band was toying {{with the idea of}} changing their name to Washing Machine. Visible on the shirt on the left are signatures by Thalia Zedek and Chris Brokaw of the tour's opening band Come. The photo was taken by Gordon, who believed it could be used as the album cover. The band liked the shot, but the record label did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> without permission from the fans. As the band did not have any way to contact them, their faces had to be cropped out.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with XXL magazine, rapper Fat Joe claimed that he helped produce the track while working with producer Scott Storch. He stated: [...] "I'm pretty sure the world don't know we actually produced Candy Shop together. I produced it with him (Storch) ... Scott called me like 50 times, 100 times: 'Yo, you sure you don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>it?</b> 50 Cent called me. 50 Cent want it.' I {{never had a problem}} with this dude. I was like, 'Go ahead.'" [...] When writing the song, 50 Cent stated: [...] "I attempted to be as sexual as possible, from a male perspective, without being vulgar or obscene".|$|E
500|$|Despite earning {{critical}} acclaim and a sizable fanbase, commercial success eluded the group. Early in their career, their 1993 EP Jenny Ondioline entered the UK Singles Chart, but financial issues prevented the band from printing enough records to satisfy demand. When Elektra Records was closed down by Warner Bros. Records in 2004, Stereolab was dropped {{along with many}} other artists, reportedly because of poor sales. Since then, Stereolab's self-owned label Duophonic has inked a worldwide distribution deal with independent label Too Pure. Through Duophonic the band both licenses their music and releases it directly (depending on geographic market). According to Tim Gane, [...] "...we license our recordings and just give them to people, then we don't have to ask for permission if we <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>it.</b> We just want to be in control of our own music." ...|$|E

500|$|Fry's podgrams {{consist of}} anecdotes, {{such as how}} he broke his arm while filming a {{documentary}} in Brazil. He has also presented lectures, discussed certain themes in detail, or argued against things he sees as being wrong in today's society. In discussing his hatred of dancing, he said of music, [...] "I do not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> as an exercise track for a farcical, meaningless, disgusting, brainless physical public exhibition of windmilling, gyrating and thrashing in a hot, loud room or hall." [...] The material is usually original for each podcast, but he may revisit topics that he has previously discussed. For example, one podgram consisted of a speech he had previously made concerning public service broadcasting. His apologetic explanation for the repeated subject matter described his busy life, and he stated that the podgram was [...] "all I can offer you." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Equus October" [...] {{was born}} out of a song that the band were {{considering}} discarding because they were never able to finish it until they entered the studio and changed their minds, wanting more material on the album. They decided to use a riff from it only as an interlude that ran 30 seconds long, but they came up with more ideas {{about what to do with}} it during the mixing process, eventually increasing the length of the song. Rubalcaba explained that the bass guitar line remained a constant fixture on jam sessions between himself and Eginton, and they decided to give it a chance by recording it at the album's sessions. Once Mitchell also began adding material to the song, Rubalcaba felt it started taking on a [...] "strong & majestic yet mournful" [...] sensation, almost as if it were about a ritualistic sacrifice. He later discovered the ritual of the October Horse and based the song's title on that of the ritual. [...] "It took on the feeling I had about the jam & how it just completely comes crashing down so abruptly at the end," [...] he explained. Expanding the song in the studio led the group to <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> as an interlude that leads into the album's title track.|$|E

2500|$|By the mid-1980s, Jourgensen parted {{ways with}} George and signed to Sire Records. Jourgensen {{performed}} mostly solo for Ministry's next LP, Twitch (1986), which sold well, {{but was still}} considered to be [...] "underground". The music was danceable electronic music, but was not pop music, and the sound was harsher and more aggressive than what Ministry had recorded before. According to Jourgensen, [...] "Twitch was stuff that I was doing before With Sympathy came out. Some of that stuff was already {{four or five years}} old, but the record company didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>it,</b> so...". Much of the new sound was created with the use of digital sampling and the input of producer Adrian Sherwood.|$|E

2500|$|Florence and the Machine {{played at}} Australia's Splendour in the Grass music festival in July 2010. The group drew {{one of the}} biggest crowds of the three-day festival. They {{performed}} in the natural open-air amphitheatre, which had to be closed off by security due to safety concerns as an unprecedented number of festival-goers rushed to see the performance. It is estimated that 28,000 people of the 33,000 people who attended the festival crammed in to see Florence and the Machine. The amphitheatre was reopened shortly after the start, once the safety concerns were allayed. In October 2009, the band's equipment and instruments were caught in a trailer fire during their European tour, forcing the band to use rented instruments to complete their remaining shows. Welch stated, [...] "You could hear the harp's strings ping in the fire. Strange sound. We recorded it and I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> in a song." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lullaby is {{the story}} of Carl Streator, a {{newspaper}} reporter who has been assigned to write articles on a series of cases of sudden infant death syndrome, from which his own child had died. Streator discovers that his wife and child had died immediately after he read them a [...] "culling song", or African chant, from a book entitled Poems and Rhymes Around the World. As Streator learns, the culling song has the power to kill anyone it is spoken to. [...] Because of the stress of his life, it became unusually powerful, allowing him to kill by only thinking the poem. During his investigations into other SIDS cases for his article, he finds that a copy of the book was at the scene of each death. In every case, the book was open to a page that contained the [...] "culling song". [...] Streator unintentionally memorizes the deadly poem and he semi-voluntarily becomes a serial killer (killing, for example, abusive radio hosts and people who elbow into an elevator when he is late for work). He then turns to Helen Hoover Boyle, a real estate agent who has also found the culling song in the same book and knows of its destructive power. While she is unable to help him stop using the culling song, she is willing to help him stop anyone else from being able to use it again. The two of them decide to go on a road trip across the country to find all remaining copies of the book and remove and destroy the page containing the song. They are joined by Helen's hippie assistant, Mona [...] "Mulberry" [...] Sabbat, and Mona's boyfriend, a nihilistic environmentalist named Oyster. Streator now must not only deal with the dangers of the culling song, but with the risk of it falling into the hands of Oyster, who may <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> for sinister purposes.|$|E
