2500|$|This {{concerns}} the philosophical issue of epistemology, or {{the study of}} knowledge. [...] Even if <b>we</b> <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> the psychological assumption is false, AI researchers could still argue (as AI founder John McCarthy has) {{that it was possible}} for a symbol processing machine to represent all knowledge, regardless of whether human beings represented knowledge the same way. Dreyfus argued that there was no justification for this assumption, since so much of human knowledge was not symbolic.|$|E
2500|$|... "The Government appeals {{from the}} {{district}} court's judgment of acquittal on the conspiracy count, and Valle separately appeals from the judgment of conviction on the CFAA count. Because <b>we</b> <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> there was insufficient evidence as {{to the existence of}} a genuine agreement to kidnap and of Valle's specific intent to commit a kidnapping, we affirm the district court's judgment of acquittal on the conspiracy count. Because we find that the district court's construction of the CFAA violates the rule of lenity, we reverse the judgment of conviction on the CFAA count." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 21 August, Defense Minister Nosiviwe Noluthando Mapisa-Nqakula {{became the}} first South African {{government}} official to apologise for the shooting and asked for forgiveness from angry miners who held up plastic packets of bullet casings to her. [...] "We agree, as you see us {{standing in front of}} you here, that blood was shed at this place. <b>We</b> <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> it was not something to our liking and, {{as a representative of the}} government, I apologise...I am begging, I beg and I apologise, may you find forgiveness in your hearts." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Have you {{forgotten}} what <b>we</b> <b>agreed</b> on, Godfrey, when {{you spoke to}} me in the country? <b>We</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> were to be cousins, and nothing more." ...|$|R
60|$|We {{talked the}} matter over on my return, and <b>we</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> {{as it seemed}} {{impossible}} to depend upon a supply of fish, from the waters about our camp, {{it would be better}} to let old John bring fresh meat from the butcher, and as neither of us liked crackers, <b>we</b> also <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> he should bring bread.|$|R
2500|$|On December 22, 2010, the Alaska Supreme Court {{upheld a}} lower court {{decision}} and denied Miller's suit. The high court, in its ruling, called voter intent [...] "paramount," [...] and said [...] "any misspelling, abbreviation, or other minor variation {{in the form of}} the candidate's name on a write-in ballot does not invalidate a ballot so long as the intention of the voter can be ascertained." [...] and [...] "The State characterizes the standard urged by Miller as the 'perfection standard,' and <b>we</b> <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> such a standard would tend to disenfranchise many Alaskans on the basis of 'technical errors".|$|E
2500|$|<b>We</b> <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> the {{challenge}} to 25524.2 is ripe for judicial review, but that the questions concerning 25524.1(b) are not. The basic rationale of the ripeness doctrine [...] "is to prevent the courts, through avoidance of premature adjudication, from entangling themselves in abstract disagreements over administrative policies, and also to protect the agencies from judicial interference until an administrative decision has been formalized and its effects felt in a concrete way by the challenging parties." [...] Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, [...] 387 [...] U.S. 136, 148 -149 (1967). In Abbott Laboratories, which remains our leading discussion of the doctrine, we indicated {{that the question of}} ripeness turns on [...] "the fitness of the issues for judicial decision" [...] and [...] "the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration." [...] Id., at 149.|$|E
2500|$|Following complaints, the Sun News Network {{removed the}} video from its website and issued an apology: [...] "Two weeks {{ago on the}} Sun News program [...] "The Source" [...] {{we looked at the}} issue of Canadian refugee claims by the Roma people. Following the {{broadcast}} we received a number of complaints from viewers who felt the broadcast reinforced negative stereotypes about the Roma people. We have completed a review of the material and <b>we</b> <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> this content was inappropriate and should not have gone to air. It was not the intent of Sun News, or anyone employed by Sun News, to promote negative stereotypes about the Roma people. We regret our error in these broadcasts, and we apologize unreservedly to the Roma people and to you, our viewers." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{after some}} more talk <b>we</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> {{the wisdom of}} rats had been grossly overrated, being in fact no {{greater than that of}} men.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why not of [...] "Zeus, {{father of}} gods and men"? For <b>we</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> it--we will call it he, now, having <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> it is a person--could owe its {{existence}} to none but God Himself.' ...|$|R

2500|$|Present {{throughout}} the work are masked portrayals of Cocea's political allies and adversaries. Pastia, who described such cameos as both cartoonish and interesting, identified Alexandru Averescu, Ion I. C. Brătianu, Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea, I. C. Frimu, Dumitru Iliescu-Turtucaia, Take Ionescu, Nicolae Iorga and some others. Pastia {{also suggests that}} the central theme (Bojogeanu as the bourgeois suffocating ancient boyardom) is conventional and ultimately irrelevant: [...] "That may well be, and <b>we</b> <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> our morals may tolerate the decay of the Azans and the ascent of the Bojogeanus. But this did not a novel make. An issue of Facla would have sufficed." [...] Călinescu spoke with displeasure about Fecior de slugă as an illustration of Cocea's [...] "strident, violent style, excessively vulgar and of a sexuality that is never redeemed by a hint of whatever is eternally human." [...] Pastia however found that Cocea wrote his book with noticeable talent [...] "in rendering that which is vulgar", a Romanian answer to Charles Baudelaire's Les Fleurs du mal.|$|E
2500|$|Statements of President Chávez over a {{potential}} coup {{involvement of the}} United States are varied. Shortly before the coup attempt, Chávez dismissed possible hostility from the United States, since [...] "times had changed." [...] After the coup, however, Chávez asserted numerous times that United States government officials knew about plans for a coup, approved of them, and assumed they would be successful, alleging that [...] "two military officers from the United States" [...] {{were present in the}} headquarters of coup plotters. Chávez would also state after the coup that there was [...] "little evidence" [...] that the United States orchestrated the plan. Rear Admiral Carlos Molina, a central leader of the coup, later said that [...] "We felt we were acting with US support... <b>we</b> <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> we can’t permit a communist government here. The US has not let us down yet." [...] However, the United States repeatedly informed the Venezuelan opposition {{that they would not be}} supported if there were a coup and President George W. Bush denied the United States' involvement.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Amy,' said Mr Dorrit, 'you {{have just}} now {{been the subject}} of some {{conversation}} between myself and Mrs General. <b>We</b> <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> you scarcely seem at home here. Ha--how is this?' ...|$|E
60|$|Comparing {{views in}} the train, <b>we</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> had lost the game by two points to one; and George, who was evidently disappointed, threw the book out of window.|$|R
6000|$|It {{was easy}} to understand. [...] "On her deathbed?" [...] But Kate took an instant's thought. [...] "Aren't <b>we</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> {{there was never any}} one in the world like her?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, sir, <b>we</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> {{there was}} no danger of my getting the prize. If I had got it, I should have told you everything. Reynolds will tell you that, sir.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If <b>we</b> <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> {{life has}} a meaning, and, {{in order to}} conform to the purpose of the Spirit of the Universe, must be lived in one way, we {{certainly}} cannot object to calling that right way of living, that decree of the Spirit, the Word.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{would have}} been useless {{for me to make}} the journey had this been all, Mr. Tallboys. I am very glad to have heard your opinion, which agrees exactly with that which I myself have formed, but it was {{scarcely}} with the object of eliciting it that I have made this journey. We will now proceed to that part of the subject. <b>We</b> <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> the will is probably still in existence, and that it is hidden somewhere about the Hall. The next question is, how is it to be found?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay," [...] here {{interposed}} Marcus Ancyrus with stern reproof, [...] "before {{we begin}} to vote let us be agreed on one point: let us be prepared to swear by the gods that we will adhere truly and loyally to {{the choice of the}} majority--and if, as meseems is likely, <b>we</b> <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> the unknown future husband of Dea Flavia Augusta become the ruler of us all, then must we swear to proclaim him the Cæsar with one accord, else doth our voting become a mere farce. Friends, before ye vote, are you ready to take this oath?" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{liked this}} scheme, and Provis was quite elated by it. <b>We</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> {{it should be}} carried into execution, and that Provis should never {{recognize}} us if we came below Bridge, and rowed past Mill Pond Bank. But <b>we</b> further <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> he should pull down the blind {{in that part of}} his window which gave upon the east, whenever he saw us and all was right.|$|R
6000|$|... “You know <b>we</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> {{must make}} the best of everything,” Will said. “If we work as we are doing we can’t but please our overseers, and shall save {{ourselves}} from blows.” ...|$|R
60|$|And then <b>we</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> he {{had better}} be put to bed at once in Eustace's room, as there was already a fire there, and any other would take long in being warmed.|$|R
6000|$|... "You are then," [...] replied Zero, [...] "in a {{position}} to grasp my argument. <b>We</b> <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> humanity is the object, the glorious triumph of humanity; and being pledged to labour for that end, and {{face to face with}} the banded opposition of kings, parliaments, churches, and the members of the force, who am I--who are we, dear sir--to affect a nicety about the tools employed? You might, perhaps, expect us to attack the Queen, the sinister Gladstone, the rigid Derby, or the dexterous Granville; but there you would be in error. Our appeal is to the body of the people; it is these that we would touch and interest. Now, sir, have you observed the English housemaid?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'She {{held up her}} stately head, {{and thought}} it would be a better return for Mr. Mansell's {{kindness}} to tell him herself before leaving Beauchastel; but Lady Conway entreated her not to be hasty, and protested that her fears were of Mr. Mansell's displeasure with her for not having taken better care of her--she dreaded a break, and so on,--till the end of it was, that though <b>we</b> <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> prudence would carry us off to-morrow morning, yet her ladyship will look the other way, if you happen to be on the southern beach at eleven o'clock to-morrow morning. I suppose you were very headlong and peremptory in your note, for I could not imagine Isabel consenting to a secret tryste even so authorized.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{allude to}} our tails?--Why, sir, nature has dealt out these {{ornaments}} {{with a very}} unequal hand, as you may perceive on looking out of the window. <b>We</b> <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> the tail is the seat of reason, and that the extremities are the most intellectual parts; but, as governments are framed to equalize these natural inequalities, we denounce them as anti-republican. The law requires, therefore, that every citizen, on attaining his majority, shall be docked agreeably to a standard measure that is kept in each district. Without some such expedient, {{there might be an}} aristocracy of intellect among us, and there would be an end of our liberties. This is the qualification of a voter, too, and of course we all seek to obtain it." ...|$|E
5000|$|For example, one {{reported}} note by Provenzano read [...] "I met 512151522 191212154 and <b>we</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> {{will see}} each other after the holidays..." [...] This name was decoded as [...] "Binnu Riina".|$|R
6000|$|S. [...] "And I fear, too, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> he only who {{possessed the}} spirit of truth saw facts as they are; for that was {{involved}} in our definition of {{the spirit of}} truth." ...|$|R
60|$|Harris said {{he thought}} it was a very fine maze, so far as he was a judge; and <b>we</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> would try to get George to go into it, on our way back.|$|R
6000|$|... ... The Judge alludes {{very often}} {{in the course of}} his remarks to the {{exclusive}} right which the States have to decide the whole thing for themselves. I agree with him very readily.... Our controversy with him is in regard to the new Territories. <b>We</b> <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> when States come in as States they have the right and power to do as they please.... We profess constantly that we have no more inclination than belief in the power of the government to disturb it; yet we are driven constantly to defend ourselves from the assumption that we are warring upon the rights of the States. What I insist upon is, that the new Territories shall be kept free from it while in the territorial condition ...|$|E
6000|$|Certain {{common and}} obvious {{mistakes}} may {{be ruled out}} from the beginning. For example, <b>we</b> <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> we want superior mind; but we need not fall into the football club folly of counting on this {{as a product of}} superior body. Yet if we recoil so far as to conclude that superior mind consists in being the dupe of our ethical classifications of virtues and vices, in short, of conventional morality, we shall fall out of the fryingpan of the football club into the fire of the Sunday School. If we must choose between a race of athletes and a race of [...] "good" [...] men, let us have the athletes: better Samson and Milo than Calvin and Robespierre. But neither alternative is worth changing for: Samson is no more a Superman than Calvin. What then are we to do? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've {{been talking}} {{with some of our}} men," [...] Peter said a few days afterward, [...] "and <b>we</b> <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> we are bound {{to get to the bottom}} of this matter. We're sartin sure that the traitor don't belong to us. What we propose is this, that the hull of us shall go up together, without saying a word to a soul, and scatter {{ourselves}} along the river at all the points where a chap going with a message to the enemy would be likely to cross. The night we go out we'll get the three captains all to give orders to their men for an expedition, so that whoever it is that sends messages from here would be sure to send over word to the Yankees; and it'll be hard if we don't ketch him. What do you say?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Last Friday night <b>we</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> it {{was well}} that we should learn the {{intentions}} of the English, and that we should ascertain the position in which we should stand were they to come here." ...|$|R
6000|$|S. [...] "Impious, truly, if we {{held that}} this spirit of truth {{was a part}} of your own self. But <b>we</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> it was not a part of you, but {{something}} utterly independent of you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But that couldn't {{make you}} think it. However, it's all over between us. <b>We</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> it should be so this morning; and I thought it right {{to come out and}} let you know at once." ...|$|R
