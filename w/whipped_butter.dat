500|$|Deep-fried butter's flavor {{has been}} {{compared}} to that of French toast, and has also been described as tasting like [...] "the most buttery bread you've ever had." [...] It has been stated that the butter mostly melts into the mix when it is cooked. It may be prepared using <b>whipped</b> <b>butter,</b> which is less dense compared to standard butter. When consumed, stray liquefied butter inside the product may ooze from the product onto one's face and fingers.|$|E
50|$|Aside from icing, pastry {{bags are}} {{commonly}} used to shape meringue and whipped cream, and to fill doughnuts with jelly or custard. They are used to form cream puffs, éclairs, and ladyfingers. When presentation is especially important, fluted tips {{can be used to}} shape savory foods such as filling for deviled eggs, <b>whipped</b> <b>butter,</b> and mashed potatoes (especially for Pommes duchesse).|$|E
50|$|Commercial {{grades are}} A, B, and C. The color of raw (grade A) butter ranges from cream (like <b>whipped</b> <b>butter)</b> to grayish yellow. It has a nutty aroma which is removed {{in the other}} grades. Grade C is pure white. While the level of vitamin content can be {{affected}} by refining, up to 95% of vitamin content can be removed from refined grades (i.e., grade C) of shea butter while reducing contamination levels to undetectable levels.|$|E

50|$|Jif is an American {{brand of}} peanut butter made by The J.M. Smucker Company, which {{purchased}} the brand from Procter & Gamble in 2001. In 1955, Procter & Gamble bought Big Top peanut butter from William T. Young of Kentucky and, in the ensuing years, reformulated and rebranded it to compete with Skippy and Peter Pan. P. & G. named its product Jif, used oils other than peanut oil in its hydrogenation process, and sweetened the recipe, adding sugar and molasses. The original Creamy and Crunchy style Jif peanut butters both debuted in 1958.In 1974, Extra Crunchy Jif was introduced, followed in 1991 by Simply Jif, a peanut butter variant with low sodium and less sugar than regular Jif. Reduced Fat Jif was introduced three years later in 1994. In 2014, Jif Whips was released as the first <b>whipped</b> peanut <b>butter.</b>|$|R
50|$|Banan{{a pancake}}s is a pancake dish {{prepared}} using bananas and pancake batter as primary ingredients. The bananas can be mashed or sliced, {{after which they}} {{are added to the}} batter.

40|$|Premix {{product is}} a {{ready-made}} flour processed food contained the ingredients and some additives that {{are stable in}} the mixture which still need some additional minimum such as; egg, water and <b>butter.</b> <b>Whipping</b> cream premix is a powder product which is strongly influenced by environmental temperature. The main objective {{of this study is}} to determine chemical and physical characteristics of whipping cream premix. Chemical analyses consist of moisture content and water activity variables, while physical analyses consist of overrun and stiffness variables, also observation on decoration properties. The second objective {{of this study is to}} determine the whipping cream premix shelf-life based on its chemical and physical characteristics. The whipping cream premix shelf-life measured using Accelerated Shelf Life Test (ASLT) Arrhenius Model, with three different extreme temperatures, i. e. 21 °C, 27 °C and 37 °C. The result shows that water activity was supposed as the key to determine whipping cream premix shelf-life, with regression linear equation follows order 0 (y = y =- 5. 507 x + 12, 50). Based on water activity variable, the shelf-life of whipping cream premix on supermarket temperature (25 °C) is 250 days...|$|R
