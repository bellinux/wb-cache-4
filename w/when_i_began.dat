5|$|I {{should say}} I {{wanted to write}} poetry in the {{beginning}} because I {{had fallen in love}} with words. The first poems I knew were nursery rhymes and before I could read them for myself I had come to love the words of them. The words alone. What the words stood for was of a very secondary importance... I fell in love, that is the only expression I can think of, at once, and am still at the mercy of words, though sometimes now, knowing a little of their behaviour very well, I think I can influence them slightly and have even learned to beat them now and then, which they appear to enjoy. I tumbled for words at once. And, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> to read the nursery rhymes for myself, and, later, to read other verses and ballads, I knew that I had discovered the most important things, to me, that could be ever.|$|E

Reflecting on her decision, Wong told Motion Picture Magazine in 1931: [...] "I was so young <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> that I knew I still had youth if I failed, so I determined to give myself 10years to succeed as an actress." ...|$|E
500|$|On February 23, 2007, Abrams {{accepted}} Paramount's {{offer to}} direct the film, after having initially been attached to it solely as a producer. He explained that he had decided {{to direct the}} film because, after reading the script, he realized that he [...] "would be so agonizingly envious of whoever stepped in and directed the movie." [...] Orci and Kurtzman said that their aim had been to impress a casual fan like Abrams with their story. Abrams noted that, during filming, he had been nervous [...] "with all these tattooed faces and pointy ears, bizarre weaponry and Romulan linguists, with dialogue about 'Neutral Zones' and 'Starfleet' [...] I knew this would work, because the script Alex and Bob wrote was so emotional and so relatable. I didn't love Kirk and Spock <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> this journey – but I love them now." ...|$|E

500|$|In the 1920s, Pullin was {{included}} in the Births and deaths section of Wisden, a rarity for non-players, due to his standing as a reporter. Wisden described him {{as one of the greatest}} authorities on cricket. Pullin retired in 1931. Although his reputation was later obscured by writers such as Neville Cardus, Allison believes that [...] "Pullin's greatest achievement was to define the role of the journalist in sport as the critic, popularizer, and interpreter of a particular team to its public." [...] Cardus himself wrote that Pullin [...] "was one of the first writers who gave me help and counsel <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> to write on cricket. He belonged to the dignified old school of cricket journalism and had much in common with Sydney Pardon, though he was always the hard-headed Yorkshireman. He kept his mind on the game, had no use for frills, and despised modern stunting." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "It was my intention, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> writing fiction {{several years}} ago, to {{construct}} texts that were both written and drawn.... I continued this method right through Apples and Pears... The designer [...] understood [...] collages to be gratuitous illustrations {{having nothing to}} do with anything, reduced them all to burnt toast, framed them with nonsensical lines, and sabotaged my whole enterprise. I took this as final defeat, and haven't tried to combine drawing and writing in any later work of fiction." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "In {{spite of}} everything, {{it was a}} very fertile period for me. During the first weeks, I had a dream almost every night, some of which {{anticipated}} my future work. In my cell I was surrounded by a profound silence. I could work on myself and that is <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> to write a novel. My neighbors simply waited for each day to pass. That time of captivity was precious to me because I could exercise zazen meditation and remain in immobility for hours." ...|$|E
2500|$|Babel later recalled, [...] "My journalistic work {{gave me a}} lot, {{especially}} {{in the sense of}} material. I managed to amass an incredible number of facts, which proved to be an invaluable creative tool. I struck up friendships with morgue attendants, criminal investigators, and government clerks. Later, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> writing fiction, I found myself always returning to these 'subjects', which were so close to me, in order to put character types, situations, and everyday life into perspective. Journalistic work is full of adventure." ...|$|E

Running away would not do any good, the police would find me where ever I went and would bring me back to it all. No, Mother and Daddy are not to blame, it is just me.

2500|$|... "So the {{question}} is: 'How to win?' That's <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> to develop what you now see full-fledged in the 'wedge' strategy: 'Stick {{with the most}} important thing' —the mechanism and the building up of information. Get the Bible and the Book of Genesis out of the debate because {{you do not want}} to raise the so-called Bible-science dichotomy. Phrase the argument in such a way that you can get it heard in the secular academy and in a way that tends to unify the religious dissenters. That means concentrating on, 'Do you need a Creator to do the creating, or can nature do it on its own?' and refusing to get sidetracked onto other issues, which people are always trying to do." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2004 Michael said [...] "I used {{to sleep}} with women quite {{a lot in the}} Wham! days but never felt it could develop into a {{relationship}} because I knew that, emotionally, I was a gay man. I didn't want to commit to them but I was attracted to them. Then I became ashamed that I might be using them. I decided I had to stop, which I did <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> to worry about AIDS, which was becoming prevalent in Britain. Although I had always had safe sex, I didn't want {{to sleep with}} a woman without telling her I was bisexual. I felt that would be irresponsible. Basically, I didn't want to have that uncomfortable conversation that might ruin the moment, so I stopped sleeping with them." [...] In the same interview, he added : [...] "If I wasn't with Kenny , I would have sex with women, no question". He said he believed that the formation of his sexuality was [...] "a nurture thing, via the absence of my father who was always busy working. It meant I was exceptionally close to my mother", though he stated that [...] "there are definitely those who have a predisposition to being gay in which the environment is irrelevant." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 9 August 2009, while commentating on {{the fourth}} Ashes Test at Headingley that season, Botham was invited {{to take part in}} an on-field {{ceremony}} to induct him into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame along with the Yorkshire greats Wilfred Rhodes, Fred Trueman and Geoffrey Boycott. Geoff Boycott was also in attendance, along with Fred Trueman's widow Veronica and Colin Graves who, as Yorkshire County Cricket Club chairman, accepted the honour on behalf of Wilfred Rhodes. Botham said: [...] "To be named amongst 55 of the most prolific players in cricketing history is a great honour for me. To have my cricketing career recognised in the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame is not something I would have thought <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> playing cricket but to be receiving this award today is something I'm extremely grateful for". Colin Graves included Botham in his tribute to Rhodes when he said: [...] "It is a great honour to accept the cap on behalf of a Yorkshire legend. Wilfred Rhodes was an exceedingly gifted player and is rightly regarded as one of England's greatest all-rounders. I am also delighted to see two other great Yorkshiremen and another great all-rounder inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame today".|$|E
2500|$|The Times David Chater commented {{positively}} on {{the episode}} [...] "Elliot's Wonderful Life", writing that: [...] "Holby City fans will love this episode [...] It is highly effective {{in what it}} sets out to do, although – like so much television at Christmas – you need to drink a pint of warm Baileys for the full effect." [...] The episode was selected as recommended viewing by several TV critics, including Dydd Iau of the Liverpool Daily Post, and Roz Laws of the Sunday Mercury, who noted: [...] "It sounds a bit strange, but there's snow, carols and an uplifting happy ending for a change." [...] The Mirror Maeve Quigley called it [...] "a timeless story", though questioned the plausibility of {{a world in which}} Elliot's patients went untreated, as [...] "the NHS isn't a one- man band after all". In contrast, Robert Hanks of The Independent reviewed the episode negatively, calling it [...] "incompetent to the point of sacrilege". Hanks wrote: [...] "What it did add to the mix, that James Stewart never achieved, was to give the viewer an authentic frisson of empathy: there was a point towards the end - during an encounter with Elliot's miraculously resurrected, motor-neurone-disease-afflicted yet remarkably soignée and articulate wife - <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> to see never having been born as preferable, sometimes, to prime-time TV." ...|$|E
2500|$|André St-Pierre is the {{director}} of the episodes. He is best known as the co-director of the Télé-Québec show Les Francs-Tireurs and La Job was his first fiction. Script adaptation was given to Ian Lauzon and Jean-Philippe Granger was made screenwriter. Like the American Office, improv veterans were called to fill the shoes of some of the original actors. The role of the David Brent boss was entrusted to Antoine Vézina, a performer of the reputed Ligue nationale d'improvisation (LNI), a Quebec-born concept of improvisational theatre and international improv team competition (Quebec, France, Belgium, Switzerland and Italy). Sophie Cadieux, who holds the role corresponding to Dawn Tinsley, has also taken part in the LNI. Paul Ahmarani, playing La Jobs Gareth Keenan, is a great fan of the British series. About the black humor of the show, he comments: [...] "Personally, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> watching that show, after five minutes, I knew that I had before my eyes something unique, that would literally shatter all that we had seen before". On his character, he sums up that [...] "I'm someone that is very much of a coward, so I like to take refuge in military fantasies of virility... I really like to say that I spent three years in the army... I'm a bit of a loser, very right-wing, very militarist". Sébastien Huberdeau, the Tim Canterbury equivalent, was seen on international screens in The Barbarian Invasions, winner of the 2004 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.|$|E
