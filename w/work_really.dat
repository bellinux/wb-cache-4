[...] He wrote, [...] "It's just so unique the way they use {{state of the art}} 3D computer animation to create a retrofitted look.

5000|$|When I {{moved up}} to coach the first team I was still doing the youth team, the reserves, the goalkeeping {{coaching}} and also the centre of excellence along with Neil Baker and Richard O'Kelly. It was a seven-day-a-week job, so it's fair to say I was heavily involved. I also introduced a fitness programme and <b>worked</b> <b>really</b> hard with the first team on dividing them into units and concentrating on their jobs in each third of the pitch.

500|$|... "Luxurious" [...] is an R ballad, whose {{instrumentation}} {{consists of}} keyboards and synthesizers. It {{is written in}} common time in the key of A minor. The song uses a descending i-vii-VI-V chord progression. The lyrics of the song include descriptions of wealth and riches, what one reviewer called [...] "a world of Egyptian cotton, cashmere, tuberoses, and, of course, diamonds". Stefani stated that [...] " [...] song really is more about a love relationship. If you really listen to the lyrics, {{it has nothing to}} do with money or luxury. It has to do with love, being rich in love. I just wanted to think of a clever way to express how you have to <b>work</b> <b>really</b> hard for the rewards of that."

500|$|Finding it {{ironic that}} Outliers {{provided}} {{suggestions on how}} to resolve cultural biases, the Sunday Times review by Kevin Jackson agreed that the book itself suffered from an unbalanced focus on American subjects, predicting that this would lead to better sales in the United States than in the United Kingdom.

The track was written in February 2010, and when asked about working with Dragonette on the track, Roberts responded, [...] "I was with them for quite a while writing, and they were the first people that I went in with when I started making the record.

500|$|This {{study has}} been {{extensively}} discussed by later scholars and several major criticisms have emerged. First, Durkheim took most of his data from earlier researchers, notably Adolph Wagner and Henry Morselli, who were much more careful in generalizing from their own data. Second, later researchers found that the Protestant–Catholic differences in suicide seemed {{to be limited to}} German-speaking Europe and thus may have always been the spurious reflection of other factors. Durkheim's study of suicide has been criticized {{as an example of the}} logical error termed the ecological fallacy. However, diverging views have contested whether Durkheim's <b>work</b> <b>really</b> contained an ecological fallacy. More recent authors such as Berk (2006) have also questioned the micro–macro relations underlying Durkheim's work. Some, such as Inkeles (1959), Johnson (1965) and Gibbs (1968), have claimed that Durkheim's only intent was to explain suicide sociologically within a holistic perspective, emphasizing that [...] "he intended his theory to explain variation among social environments in the incidence of suicide, not the suicides of particular individuals".|$|E

It was a winner", while VanDerWerff wrote, [...] " [...] 'Dog Days Are Over' is right in this show's wheelhouse, so, naturally, it hits the song out of the park."

500|$|Wired writer Nate Ralph {{found that}} [...] "Bloody Fun Day might not feature a deep or even logical narrative, but it's got style in spades, bolstered by simple, fun game mechanics." [...] He {{added that the}} {{increased}} amount of turns needed to hatch eggs [...] "can lead to some delightfully irritating close shaves." [...] IndieGames.com writer Michael Rose agreed, stating [...] "The game mechanics <b>work</b> <b>really</b> well and it's a very nice concept." [...] Anthony Carboni, a former co-host of Attack of the Show! and current presenter of online video game review show Bytejacker, was also positive. In his review he said [...] "It's {{a lot of fun}} and easy to pick up, but as levels progress things do get pretty intense." [...] Zenko stated the game embodied three virtues; [...] "simple, hot and deep". These virtues were required in games published by Electronic Arts, which had been outlined to Zenko in a letter from Electronic Arts' founder Trip Hawkins after Zenko had written to Hawkins as a teenager.

500|$|According to the directors, [...] " [...] patronizing quality" [...] {{was vital}} to Scar's {{role in the}} film. Minkoff told the Los Angeles Times, [...] "When Scar puts the guilt trip on Simba, that's an intense idea... {{probably}} {{something that is not}} typical of the other Disney pictures, {{in terms of what the}} villain does." [...] Additionally, Scar serves as a departure from previous Disney villains because they [...] "came off at least as buffoonish as they were sinister". Because Scar is the film's main antagonist, supervising animator Andreas Deja believed that [...] "villains <b>work</b> <b>really</b> well when they're subtle", explaining, [...] "to see them think and scheme and plot is much more interesting than showing them beating somebody up." [...] By blaming Mufasa's death on an innocent Simba, Scar ultimately triggers [...] "a cycle of guilt, flight, denial and redemption, as the hero goes into self-imposed exile before finally reconciling with his father's memory, returning to face his wicked uncle and generally coming of age." [...] The character's first line in The Lion King essentially summarizes the entire film, providing foreshadowing. It reads, [...] "Life's not fair is it? You see I-well, I... shall never be King. And you... shall never see light of another day," [...] subtly revealing the plot as well as [...] "the reason why [...] decides to murder his own brother." ...|$|E
500|$|Mills left Forest {{shortly before}} the end of 1981–82 to join the Seattle Sounders of the North American Soccer League in March 1982. He made 31 appearances, scored five goals and {{recorded}} seven assists in the 1982 North American Soccer League season as Seattle finished first in the Western Division. He started for Seattle in Soccer Bowl '82 before being substituted for Roger Davies, and the match was won 1–0 by the New York Cosmos with a 31st-minute goal scored by Giorgio Chinaglia. Less than a month later he made a temporary return to England by signing for Forest's local rivals Derby County on loan on 13 October 1982. Mills made his debut three days later in a 1–1 away draw with Grimsby Town in the Second Division, before scoring his first goal with Derby's second in a 2–0 home win over Queens Park Rangers on 3 January 1983. His loan ended in April 1983, having made 23 appearances and scored two goals for Derby in 1982–83. Early in the 1983 North American Soccer League season he had his leg broken by David Watson and was kept out of action for a year. However, this acted as a wake-up call for Mills, who said: [...] "It made me <b>work</b> <b>really</b> hard and that's what made me go on and play until I was 47.
