5|$|From January until March 1686, La Salle {{and most}} of his men searched {{overland}} for the Mississippi River, traveling towards the Rio Grande, possibly as far west as modern-day Langtry, Texas. The men questioned the local Native American tribes, asking for information on the locations of the Spaniards and the Spanish mines, offering gifts, and telling stories that portrayed the Spanish as cruel and the French as benevolent. When the group returned, they were unable to find the Belle where they had left her and were forced to <b>walk</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fort.|$|E
25|$|However, nothing went as planned, {{and the new}} ride opened {{significantly}} {{later than}} the scheduled opening date. On the final ceremonial ride of World of Motion, on January 2, 1996, it broke down. GM executives who were riding it had to climb out and <b>walk</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> exit.|$|E
25|$|Despite the men's efforts Main died of her injuries. Kemsley {{then found}} a clergyman {{who had been}} a {{passenger}} on the train, and got him to <b>walk</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bodies to say a prayer. McPhee also found injured passenger Sharmin Bacchus trapped in the wreckage, and kept her conscious until she was freed.|$|E

25|$|After work on 21 September 2012, Meagher {{went with}} {{co-workers}} from ABC Melbourne to the Brunswick Green bar on Sydney Road, Brunswick, later moving to Bar Etiquette (also in Sydney Road and now closed). She left {{the bar at}} around 1:30 am and began the short <b>walk</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> home she shared with her husband.|$|E
25|$|Peach and Perry battle {{through eight}} worlds, rescuing Toads along the way. After {{defeating}} Giant Kamek, the seventh world's boss, they free Luigi from the bubble Kamek captured him in. Peach and Perry arrive at Bowser's Villa, where they battle and defeat Bowser {{along with the}} Hammer Bros. Bowser uses the Vibe Scepter {{to turn into a}} giant, but Peach defeats him once again by throwing a Bob-omb on him and whacking him out of the villa using Perry. After Bowser's defeat, Peach frees and kisses Mario and in turn, Mario gives Peach a bunch of flowers. The game ends when Mario, Luigi, Peach and the Toads <b>walk</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Mushroom Kingdom. What became of the Vibe Scepter is unknown.|$|E
25|$|Backyard cricket, Beach cricket, Street cricket are all {{different}} names {{used to describe}} {{a wide range of}} related informal games. The rules are often ad hoc, and the laws of cricket, such as those involving leg before wicket, penalty runs, and others, are ignored or modified to suit both the setting and participants' preferences. In India and Pakistan, there is Gali cricket ('gali' in Hindi means 'street'. It is pronounced as 'gully' but {{should not be confused with}} the fielding position). Often, there are no teams, and each player plays for himself, and fields when he is not batting. Often, there is one wicket, and one bowling position, and no overs. If the batsman runs an odd number of runs, he is allowed to <b>walk</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wicket before the next ball is bowled.|$|E

25|$|While in the garden, the {{children}} are surprised to see Ben Weatherstaff looking over the wall on a ladder. Startled and angry to find {{the children}} in the secret garden, he admits that he believed Colin to be a cripple. Colin stands up from his chair and finds that his legs are fine, though weak from long disuse. Colin soon spends every day in the garden, sometimes with Dickon as company. The children conspire to keep Colin's recovering health a secret, so as to surprise his father, who is travelling abroad. As Colin's health improves, his father sees a coinciding increase in spirits, culminating in a dream where his late wife calls to him from inside the garden. When he receives a letter from Mrs Sowerby, he takes the opportunity finally to return home. He walks the outer garden wall in his wife's memory, but hears voices inside, finds the door unlocked, and is shocked to see the garden in full bloom, and his son healthy. The servants watch, stunned, as Mr Craven and Colin <b>walk</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> manor together.|$|E
25|$|Along with Bob Simpson, {{he formed}} an opening {{partnership}} that {{was regarded as}} one of the finest in Test history. Lawry was fast between the wickets, and the pair were especially well known for their understanding, as exemplified by their fluency in rotating the strike with quick singles. Lawry was known for his peculiar stance. He had little bend in his knees, and as a result batted with a stoop over his bat. He used his long reach to blunt spin bowling. He played with a very straight bat, combining well-organised defence with a somewhat limited range of strokes, marked by an efficiency of placement and an unusually heavy reliance on the hook shot. His strengths were regarded as his composure and intense concentration which powered a relentless single-mindedness. His defiant style was accentuated by his habit of tugging on his cap after every ball, as though starting afresh. John Snow wrote that 'He always had to be got out and even if you managed to knock all three stumps over he still stayed at the crease a moment looking round for some excuse to continue batting before reluctantly starting his <b>walk</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> dressing room'. Lawry was also a left-hander during his winter baseball recreation, which equipped him with a powerful throwing arm.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, for {{the sixth}} {{consecutive}} year, Halladay was Toronto's opening-day starter, improving his own club record. He lost 3–2 in a pitcher's duel with New York's Chien-Ming Wang. His first win of the season came in his next start against Boston, when he outpitched Josh Beckett in his season debut. In his third start, Halladay pitched a complete game against the Texas Rangers, in a 4–1 win. Three of his nine complete game efforts resulted in losses due to Toronto's underachieving offense early in the season. In fact, those three complete game losses came in three consecutive starts. On June 20 against the Pittsburgh Pirates, Halladay was struck in the temple by a line-drive off the bat of Nyjer Morgan. The ball caromed off Halladay's head and was caught by third baseman Scott Rolen, ending the inning. Halladay was able to <b>walk</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> dugout, but {{was taken out of}} the game for safety concerns. Although he was given {{a clean bill of health}} for his next start, it was later suggested by television commentators that Halladay may have in fact suffered a temporary lapse in recognition of what happened on the play. Halladay pitched his 10th career shutout against the Seattle Mariners on June 30. He limited them to four hits in his sixth complete game of the season. The shutout tied him with the Cardinals' Mark Mulder for 10th among active pitchers. On July 11, 2008, Halladay pitched his 7th complete game and second shutout of the season against the New York Yankees, allowing 0 runs on 2 hits for his 38th career complete game. Halladay was named to the American League All-Star Team as a reserve. He pitched in the fourth inning, yielding only one hit and striking out Lance Berkman. In his last start of the season, he fittingly pitched a complete game against the Yankees to win his 20th game of the year. In so doing, he became the first pitcher to win five games against the Yankees in a single season since Luis Tiant in 1974. In addition, he led the AL with a 1.05 WHIP. Halladay finished second in the 2008 American League Cy Young Award voting, behind Cliff Lee of the Indians. He also led the AL with 9 complete games, and struck out a career-high 206 batters (two more than his 2003 season) as well as posted a 2.78 ERA (the second-best of his career) that was second only to Cliff Lee's 2.54 ERA. Halladay also became just the fourth pitcher in major league history to post two seasons of 200 strikeouts and fewer than 40 walks. He was presented the George Gross/Toronto Sun Sportsperson of the Year award.|$|E

500|$|About five {{ambulances}} reached Pearl Roundabout, {{where they}} were confronted by police and army forces; three drivers and nine paramedics were attacked. One of the injured drivers claimed that police had clubbed him and that a senior officer had told him: [...] "If I see you again, I’ll kill you." [...] Another ambulance driver, who was unharmed, said that police removed injured protesters from his vehicle by force and a military officer– whom he {{believed to be a}} Saudi, based on his Arabic dialect– held a gun to his head and warned him to drive away or be shot. One ambulance was reportedly confiscated by police, who then took it to an unknown location after beating its driver and other paramedics, who had to <b>walk</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> SMC.|$|E
500|$|Bert, Eddie, and Sarah {{travel to}} the Kentucky Derby, where Bert {{arranges}} a match for Eddie against a wealthy local socialite named Findley. The game {{turns out to be}} carom billiards, not pool. When Eddie loses badly, Bert refuses to keep staking him. Sarah pleads with Eddie to leave with her, saying that the world he is living in and its inhabitants are [...] "perverted, twisted, and crippled"; he refuses. Seeing Eddie's anger, Bert agrees to let the match continue at $1,000 a game. Eddie comes back to win $12,000. He collects his $3,000 share and decides to <b>walk</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hotel. Bert arrives first and subjects Sarah to a humiliating sexual encounter. After, she scrawls [...] "PERVERTED", [...] "TWISTED", and [...] "CRIPPLED" [...] in lipstick on the bathroom mirror. Eddie arrives back at the hotel to learn that she has killed herself.|$|E
500|$|The Allies {{were confronted}} with an {{interior}} covered with rainforest and tall mountains where wheeled vehicles could not operate. The Australian Army {{was forced to}} rely on air transport and native carriers, two modes of transportation that it had never used before. Thousands of Papuans were conscripted to help the war effort. Trucks and jeeps carried stores, ammunition and rations {{only part of the}} way; pack animals and a flying fox (zip-wire) took them a bit further. The rest of the journey was completed on the backs of Papuan carriers, who struggled over the mountains lugging heavy loads. The environment posed the danger of endemic tropic diseases, particularly dysentery, scrub typhus and malaria. Medical units had to combat these, while caring for the sick and wounded, many of whom had to <b>walk</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> base area along the Kokoda Track. Often the Papuan carriers had to carry the wounded on the way back, earning them the sobriquet of [...] "Fuzzy Wuzzy Angels".|$|E

500|$|On 27 July 1890, aged 37, Van Gogh {{shot himself}} in the chest with a 7mm Lefaucheux à broche revolver. There were no {{witnesses}} and he died 30 hours after the incident. The shooting may have taken place in the wheat field in which he had been painting, or a local barn. The bullet was deflected by a rib and passed through his chest without doing apparent damage to internal organs – probably stopped by his spine. He was able to <b>walk</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Auberge Ravoux, where he was attended to by two doctors, but without a surgeon present the bullet could not be removed. The doctors tended to him as best they could, then left him alone in his room, smoking his pipe. The following morning Theo rushed to his brother's side, finding him in good spirits. But within hours Vincent began to fail, suffering from an untreated infection resulting from the wound. He died {{in the early hours of}} 29 July. According to Theo, Vincent's last words were: [...] "The sadness will last forever".|$|E
500|$|The team's {{fortunes}} took {{a dramatic}} turn the next day. On {{the same day}} that breakaway riders Flecha and Johnny Hoogerland were sideswiped by a car {{at the front of the}} race, Vinokourov crashed along with Jurgen Van den Broeck, Andreas Klöden, and David Zabriskie, all of whom eventually left the race due to their injuries. Vinokourov's injuries were quite clearly serious immediately [...] he could not <b>walk</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> road from which he fell, needing to be held up by Di Gregorio and Grivko. He was revealed to have sustained a broken right femur. Fofonov also crashed, witnessing what took place from his position directly behind Vinokourov. He described that the race had been extremely fast, and the road wet, with Hushovd and a rider from [...] taking a line around a left-hand curve that resulted in those behind taking it much too widely and falling off the road. Vinokourov was quoted as saying [...] "I never expected such a dramatic end on the Tour de France" [...] and said that he expected the team to fight on for a stage win. He had surgery in Aurillac the next day, with the scheduled recovery time for the injury ruling him out for the remainder of the season, also meaning that it would likely end his professional career. A week later, Vinokourov indeed announced his retirement from the sport, for a second time. After his first four weeks of rehabilitation went better than anticipated, Vinokourov announced that he would ride the Giro di Lombardia before retiring. Later this plan changed, to have him ride the Chrono des Nations instead, due to the lesser risk of crashing in an individual time trial than in a hilly classic. In September, Vinokourov came out of retirement altogether and announced that he would return as an active rider in 2012.|$|E
2500|$|When he was {{six years}} old, Gacy stole a toy truck from a {{neighborhood}} store. His mother made him <b>walk</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> store, return the toy and apologize to the owners. His mother told his father, who beat Gacy with a belt as punishment. After this incident, Gacy's mother attempted to shield her son from his father's verbal and physical abuse, yet this only succeeded in Gacy earning accusations {{that he was a}} [...] "sissy" [...] and a [...] "Mama's boy" [...] who would [...] "probably grow up queer".|$|E

2500|$|At {{the end of}} {{the third}} week, the members perform the {{imprisonment}} and retrieve prisoners' patrol, which is considered one of the toughest because members play the role of the prisoners and they undergo real torture similar to what they might face if they get captured by the enemy. On the fourth week (after the enemy is defeated), work is performed day and night to chase the enemy, where they begin tracing the enemy and perform different hits ranging from ambushes to raids, in addition to the [...] "hammer and anvil patrol" [...] in which they surround and finish-off the enemy. At the end, the members <b>walk</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> school, a walk between 80 and 100km, again with full gear.|$|E
2500|$|Once the FBI {{discovered}} through Selbold that Duquesne {{was again}} in New York operating as a German spy, director J. Edgar Hoover provided a background briefing to President Franklin Roosevelt. FBI agent Raymond Newkirk, {{using the name}} Ray McManus, was now assigned to DUNN and he rented a room immediately above Duquesne's apartment near Central Park and used a hidden microphone to record Duquesne's conversations. But monitoring Duquesne's activities proved to be difficult. As Newkirk described it, [...] "The Duke had been a spy {{all of his life}} and automatically used all of the tricks in the book to avoid anyone following him... He would take a local train, change to an express, change back to a local, go through a revolving door and keep going on right around, take an elevator up a floor, get off, <b>walk</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground, and take off in a different entrance of the building." [...] Duquesne also informed Sebold that he was certain he was under surveillance, and he even confronted one FBI agent and demanded that he stop tracking him, a story confirmed by agent Newkirk.|$|E
2500|$|La Salle {{chose to}} {{establish}} Fort Saint Louis {{on a bluff}} overlooking Garcitas Creek, 50miles (80km) from their initial campsite. [...] With their permanent camp established, the colonists took several short trips {{within the next few}} months to further explore their surroundings. At the end of October La Salle decided to undertake a longer expedition and reloaded the La Belle with much of the remaining supplies. He took 50men, plus the La Belle's crew of 27sailors, leaving behind 34 men, women, and children. The bulk of the men traveled with La Salle in canoes, while the La Belle followed further off the coast. Several of the men, including the captain of the La Belle, Canil Maraud, died on this expedition from eating prickly pear. Soon after, the Karankawa killed a small group of the men, including the new captain of La Belle, former pilot Eli Richaud, who had camped on the shore at night. In January 1686, La Salle left the ship [...] from Fort Saint Louis. [...] La Salle took 20men with him to travel overland to reach the Mississippi, leaving Pierre Tessier, the former second in command of the La Belle, in charge of the ship. After threemonths of searching overland, La Salle's group returned, but were unable to find the La Belle where they had left her and were forced to <b>walk</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fort.|$|E
