40|$|The {{technology}} of electric tree pruners {{in the current}} agricultural market has many engineering problems, including; a deficit in power output, excessive overheating, and ergonomics. The 3 -man pruner team has coordinated with H. F. Hauff Co. Inc., an agricultural equipment company owned by Neil Hauff, to produce an electric pruner prototype which addresses these problems. The methods used to design the optimal pruner prototype includes traditional engineering stress analysis, force flow analysis, finite element software, and Solidworks modeling software. The construction of the pruner involved manual machining methods and C. N. C. (Computerized Numerical Control) mill technology. During the design process, the team learned advanced analysis practices, the relationships between torque and linear output, <b>work</b> <b>fixture</b> design, product design practices, and found that slight modifications to geometry caused a force amplification effect. With the help of Neil, and his staff, the pruner team gained an appreciation and insight into the professional design process {{and the relationship between}} part complexity and fabrication time. The finished prototype was able to meet the initially established design requirements of the pruner. However, the design is still limited with regards power output and operation temperature. The design and analysis performed for this project has made it possible for further optimization of the current prototype and some engineering problems of current electric pruners were addressed and fixed. Weaknesses of the design include a high weight and non-optimal center of gravity...|$|E

40|$|Conventional {{threading}} operations involve {{two distinct}} machining processes: drilling and threading. Therefore, {{it is time}} consuming for the tools must be changed and the workpiece has to be moved to another machine. This paper presents {{an analysis of the}} combined process (drilling followed by threading) using a single tool for both operations: the tap-milling tool. Before presenting the methodology used to evaluate this hybrid tool, the ODS (operating deflection shapes) basics is shortly described. ODS and finite element modeling (FEM) were used during this research to optimize the process aiming to achieve higher stable machining conditions and increasing the tool life. Both methods allowed the determination of the natural frequencies and displacements of the machining center and optimize the workpiece fixture system. The results showed that there is an excellent correlation between the dynamic stability of the machining center-tool holder and the tool life, avoiding a tool premature catastrophic failure. Nevertheless, evidence showed that the tool is very sensitive to work conditions. Undoubtedly, the use of ODS and FEM eliminate empiric decisions concerning the optimization of machining conditions and increase drastically the tool life. After the ODS and FEM studies, it was possible to optimize the process and <b>work</b> material <b>fixture</b> system and machine more than 30, 000 threaded holes without reaching the tool life limit and catastrophic fail...|$|R
25|$|Though its exact {{parameters}} remain debatable, {{from the}} early 1970s {{to the present day}} the most salient literary movement has been postmodernism.

40|$|A {{new method}} has been devised to test {{composite}} specimens {{as thin as}} 8 plies and up to 7. 6 cm in width for compression strength. This method utilizes a fixture incorporating the best features of the Celanese and IITRI fixtures combined with an antibuckling jig developed at the University of Dayton Research Institute. This new method uses up to 83 percent less material than {{the most commonly used}} compression-after-impact technique (which calls for a 48 ply test specimen) and can also be performed on smaller loading frames since a much smaller force is needed to fail the specimen. The thickness of the test specimen can be fabricated to exactly match production part thickness, thus yielding more meaningful results. CAI tests were performed on IM 6 / 3501 carbon/epoxy utilizing this new method. To verify the design, a series of tests were performed in which undamaged specimens were tested using the new fixture and ASTM D 3410 - 87 (Celanese compression test) and the results compared.

The warpage of the specimens was monitored during irradiation at different constant dose rates and the subsequent post-cure process. A cure kinetics model for Tactix 123 was used to predict the degree of cure at the onset of residual stress development. The results showed that the dose rate imposed on a specimen is the main contributor to the development of residual stress in an EB curing process. Furthermore, the stress free temperature for CAT B was about 5 °C higher compared to Tactix 123...|$|R

40|$|This Master of Science thesis {{was a part}} of Pharmadule Emtungas {{project to}} {{construct}} a mobile automated cell for welding of carbon steel pipe (Heating, Ventilation and Sanitation). Pharmadule Emtunga is using a modular building concept for building pharmaceutical factories. The modules contain these pipes. The goal of the thesis was to present concepts for technical solutions regarding welding methods and fixtures for the cell. Conceptual models for the cell were made with aid of CAD software. A concept generation/evaluation resulted in the winning concept; orbital welding using V-stands as fixture method. The main purpose of the fixture is to offer fast and accurate alignment of pipes, with arbitrary lengths and fittings. The fixture was made after a thorough evaluation of data concerning geometries and occurrences of pipes in a typical pharmaceutical factory. A number of efficiency problems concerning welding were identified during the project. The thesis presents a four-step process for increased productivity of welding in workshop {{as well as in the}} automated cell: 1. Change payment routines so that Pharmadule Emtunga does not pay for so called “double welds”, welds that never is carried out. 2.

40|$|Fixture {{design is}} a complex and an {{experience}} based process without any throughout numerical theory behind. Proper fixture design could {{improve the quality of}} products and reduce the cost as well as required time of manufacturing; consequently the modern manufacturing environment requires suitable design systems to achieve appropriate fixtures. In this paper to obtain an acceptable machining fixture design, a case-based reasoning method with developed retrieval system is proposed. In order toincrease the effectiveness of the case based reasoning (CBR) retrieval system some formulae are derived which are able to measure similarity between symbolic attributes. This method references previous design cases to help designers for a new case in an easy manner.

40|$|A {{method was}} devised {{to test the}} {{compression}} strength of composite laminate specimens that are much thinner and wider than other tests require. The specimen can be up to 7. 62 cm (3 in) wide and as thin as 1. 02 mm (. 04 in). The best features of the Illinois Institute of Technology Research Institute (IITRI) fixture are combined with an antibuckling jig developed and used at the University of Dayton Research Institute to obtain a method of compression testing thin, wide test coupons on any 20 kip (or larger) loading frame. Up to 83 pct. less composite material is needed for the test coupons compared to {{the most commonly used}} compression-after-impact (CAI) tests, which calls for 48 ply thick (approx. 6. 12 mm) test coupons. Another advantage of the new method is that composite coupons of the exact lay-up and thickness of production parts can be tested for CAI strength, thus yielding more meaningful results. This new method was used to compression test 8 and 16 ply laminates of T 300 / 934 carbon/epoxy. These results were compared to those obtained using ASTM standard D 3410 - 87 (Celanese compression test). CAI testing was performed on IM 6 / 3501 - 6, IM 7 /SP 500 and IM 7 /F 3900.

40|$|In {{order to}} further the {{comprehension}} of the electron beam (EB) processing of polymers and composites, {{it is necessary to}} better understand the development of residual stresses during processing. In-situ measurement of stress development during EB irradiation is a challenging task. The instrumentation has to be adequately shielded from the high-energy electron beam. In this <b>work,</b> a special <b>fixture</b> was designed specifically to measure the warpage of a specimen throughout the EB curing process. The specimen consisted of a thin layer of epoxy resin (Tactix 123 or CAT B) embedded in a layer of glass scrim cloth, sandwiched between layers of steel and aluminum plates and also antisymmetric unidirectional carbon-epoxy laminates. The warpage of the specimens was monitored during and after irradiation at different constant dose rates. The results confirmed that the experimental instrumentation was not affected by the EB exposure and {{that it was possible to}} monitor the specimen warpage during the EB process. The results show that the EB cured specimens have lower stress-free temperature compared to equivalent thermally cured specimens. It was also shown that an increase in dose rate increased the level of residual stresses. Furthermore, the results suggest that there is a direct relation between the stress free temperature (TSF) and the temperature of the specimen at gelation (TGEL). Also, the stress free temperatures for CAT B specimens were 5 ºC higher than the Tactix 123 specimens cured under the same curing conditions. Finally, a cure kinetics model for Tactix 123 was used to predict the degree of cure (~ 0. 32) at onset of residual stress development and the results proved to be valid when compared to parallel plate rheology results...|$|R
40|$|In {{this project}} the {{feasibility}} of friction stir welding (FSW) of Aluminium alloy pipe with Stainless Steel plate is investigated. Aluminium alloy and Stainless Steel are widely used in aerospace, automotive, marine, defense, construction etc. due to their high strength, low weight, high machinability, good conductivity of heat and electricity etc. Friction stir welding is preferred for joining these materials {{as it is a}} solid state forge welding process and problems related with welding of Aluminium alloys and stainless steel can be subdued through this process. This welding process is a solid state welding procedure that uses a non-consumable rotating tool that is permitted to rub against the work piece hence generating frictional heat. When the weld constraints such as tool or work piece rotation speed, welding time, axial load are optimum the friction between the work piece and the tool generates enough heat to create a plastic deformation layer at the weld interface. The process doesn’t involve any melting process and whole process occurs in solid state through plastic deformation and mass flow among the work pieces. The experimental investigation of FSW is done by varying the friction stir welding parameters such as work piece rotation speed, welding time, feed (axial load). The work piece is rotated at the speeds 860 rpm, 1400 rpm and 2000 rpm. The experiment is done in a general purpose center lathe machine. To hold the <b>work</b> piece a <b>fixture</b> is designed.

40|$|Graduation date: 1996 Biaxial {{strength}} {{characteristics of}} wood-based structural panels {{were evaluated by}} using analytical and experimental methods. Cruciform plywood specimens were tested under biaxial tensile-tensile, compressive-compressive loadings in a symmetrically-jointed- arm test fixture, which was mounted on a universal testing machine. Performance of the test fixture was also evaluated during the tests. Electrical resistance strain gauges were used to measure strain values at a point of interest, and brittle coatings were also used to analyze strain distributions over the test section. Finite-element analysis was employed to develop an analytical tool. The basic configurations, detail alternatives, {{and the influence of}} reinforcement orientation on the uniformity of the biaxial stress/strain distributions in the test section of the cruciform specimen were examined by using the finite-element method. The experimental strain values and those from finite-element analysis were found in close agreement. The Tsai-Wu Tensor Polynomial Strength Theory was used to construct a predicted biaxial strength envelope in stress space. Comparisons were made between the experimental data and the theoretical predictions in quadrants I and III of stress space, as well as between the finite-element results and the theoretical predictions in quadrants II and IV of stress space. Good agreements were found in quadrants I, II and IV at a load value that corresponded with audible cracking. In quadrant III of stress space, compressive-compressive stress space, the experimental failure stress condition did not agree with the analytical solution for the strength theory envelope in that quadrant. With respect to testing method, the jointed-arm test <b>fixture</b> <b>worked</b> well in tension-tension tests. However, a method of special lateral support was needed for the compression-compression biaxial condition. Results also indicated that reinforcement orientation in the arms may influence ultimate load capacity and failure mode of the biaxial specimen...|$|R
