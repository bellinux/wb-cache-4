5|$|A {{securely}} attached toddler will explore freely while the caregiver is present, engage with strangers, be visibly upset <b>when</b> <b>the</b> caregiver departs, and {{happy to see}} the caregiver return. The anxious-ambivalent toddler is anxious of exploration, extremely distressed <b>when</b> <b>the</b> caregiver departs but ambivalent <b>when</b> <b>the</b> caregiver returns. The anxious-avoidant toddler will not explore much, avoid or ignore the parent—showing little emotion <b>when</b> <b>the</b> parent departs or returns—and treat strangers {{much the same as}} caregivers with little emotional range shown. The disorganized/disoriented toddler shows a lack of a coherent style or pattern for coping. Evidence suggests this occurs <b>when</b> <b>the</b> caregiving figure is also an object of fear, thus putting the child in an irresolvable situation regarding approach and avoidance. On reunion with the caregiver, these children can look dazed or frightened, freezing in place, backing toward the caregiver or approaching with head sharply averted, or showing other behaviors implying fear of the person who is being sought. It is thought to represent a breakdown of an inchoate attachment strategy and it appears to affect the capacity to regulate emotions.|$|E
5|$|A {{solar eclipse}} (as {{seen from the}} planet Earth) {{is a type of}} eclipse that occurs <b>when</b> <b>the</b> Moon passes between the Sun and Earth, and <b>when</b> <b>the</b> Moon fully or {{partially}} blocks ("occults") the Sun. This can happen only at new moon <b>when</b> <b>the</b> Sun and the Moon are in conjunction as seen from Earth in an alignment referred to as syzygy. In a total eclipse, the disk of the Sun is fully obscured by the Moon. In partial and annular eclipses, only part of the Sun is obscured.|$|E

5|$|Although ionic {{compounds}} contain charged atoms or clusters, {{these materials}} do not typically conduct electricity to any significant extent <b>when</b> <b>the</b> substance is solid. In order to conduct, the charged particles must be mobile rather than stationary in a crystal lattice. This is achieved {{to some degree}} at high temperatures <b>when</b> <b>the</b> defect concentration increases the ionic mobility and solid state ionic conductivity is observed. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> ionic compounds are dissolved in a liquid or are melted into a liquid, they can conduct electricity because the ions become completely mobile. This conductivity gain upon dissolving or melting is sometimes used as a defining characteristic of ionic compounds.|$|E

More distant metastases are spread by the blood and often occur in the lungs, as well as the liver, brain, and bone. Endometrial cancer metastasizes to the lungs 20–25% of the time, more than any other gynecologic cancer.|$|E
5|$|Factors {{affecting}} one's {{ability to}} delay gratification {{depend on whether}} the delay contingency is self-imposed (delay can be terminated at {{the will of the}} person waiting) or externally imposed by another person, institution or circumstance. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> contingency is self-imposed, the physical presence of the reward seems to aid in delaying gratification. On the other hand, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> delay is externally imposed, children are not able to wait as long <b>when</b> <b>the</b> reward is present, suggesting greater frustration under these circumstances.|$|E

5|$|Four {{different}} attachment classifications {{have been}} identified in children: secure attachment, anxious-ambivalent attachment, anxious-avoidant attachment, and disorganized attachment. Secure attachment is when children feel they can rely on their caregivers to attend to their needs of proximity, emotional support and protection. It is considered to be the best attachment style. Anxious-ambivalent attachment is <b>when</b> <b>the</b> infant feels separation anxiety when separated from the caregiver and does not feel reassured <b>when</b> <b>the</b> caregiver returns to the infant. Anxious-avoidant attachment is <b>when</b> <b>the</b> infant avoids their parents. Disorganized attachment is when {{there is a lack of}} attachment behavior.|$|E
