40|$|We {{describe}} an expert evaluation for user requirement elicitation of an annotation system - The Digital Library Annotation Service, DiLAS, that facilitates collaborative information access and sharing. An analytical evaluation was conducted as a Participatory Group Evaluation, which involved presentation beyond the written papers {{of the objectives}} and rationale behind {{the development of the}} prototype. The empirical evaluation of DiLAS consisted of two experiments. The first evaluation experiment was a bottom up evaluation of the usability of the interface using a qualitative approach. The second stage of our evaluation moved towards a broader work context with a User and <b>Work</b> <b>Centred</b> <b>Evaluation</b> involving an entire, collaborative task situation, which required knowledge sharing on a common real life work task. This paper describes a first evaluation stage in an iterative evaluation process, and the preliminary result is a set of requirements that will inform the next stage of the DiLAS...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to obtain knowledge regarding how effective user <b>centred</b> <b>evaluation</b> methods are and how user <b>centred</b> <b>evaluations</b> are conducted by IT professionals. This will be achieved by exploring user <b>centred</b> <b>evaluation</b> in experimental and practical settings. The knowledge gained in these studies should inspire suggestions for further research and suggestions for improvements on the user <b>centred</b> <b>evaluation</b> activity. Two experimental studies were conducted. One compares the results from using three user <b>centred</b> <b>evaluation</b> methods, and the other examines two factors while conducting heuristic evaluation. The {{results show that the}} think-aloud evaluation method was the most effective method in finding realistic usability problems of the three methods. The number of critical problems found during think-aloud evaluation increases, if heuristic evaluation is conducted prior to the think-aloud evaluations. Further, two studies of user <b>centred</b> <b>evaluation</b> in practical setting...|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{concentrates}} on influence of <b>work</b> <b>evaluation</b> and supervision on motivation of workers of low threshold clubs {{for children and}} youth. Supervision and <b>work</b> <b>evaluation</b> is perceived as an obligation for providers of social services defined in quality standards of social services. The thesis concetrates on effects of supervision and <b>work</b> <b>evaluation</b> on the motivation of workers. The opening of the thesis describes roles {{in the process of}} motivation (roles of workers and the roles of their supervisors and senior executives), along with two fundamental theories of motivation (developed by Maslow and Herzberg). In the same chapter, the risks connected with work motivation (helpers' syndrome and burn-out syndrome) within helping professions are tackled. The thesis further introduces measures, which influence motivation of workers, employees of social services, namely financial recognition and education. Attention is also paid to non-financial means of motivating employees. Two selected measures of non-financial motivation, supervision and <b>work</b> <b>evaluation,</b> are described in greater detail, specifically in terms of their foundation, function, form, procedures, purpose and impact. In the pratical part of the thesis it is verified, whether all low threshold clubs for children and youth carry out [...] ...|$|R
