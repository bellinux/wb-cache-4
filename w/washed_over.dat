5|$|Early in its duration, Pongsona first {{affected}} Pohnpei as {{a tropical}} storm. There, it produced heavy rains and gusty winds, though little damage was reported. Later, it brought tropical storm force winds to Chuuk. High waves {{from the storm}} <b>washed</b> <b>over</b> and covered some atolls.|$|E
5|$|Although the camas {{pocket gopher}} is {{fiercely}} defensive when cornered, {{it may become}} tame in captivity. While population trends are generally stable, threats to the species' survival include urbanization, habitat conversion for agricultural use and active attempts at eradication with trapping and poisons. It is prey for raptors and carnivorous mammals, and host to several parasitic arthropods and worms. Scientists believe that the gopher's evolutionary history was disrupted when the Missoula Floods <b>washed</b> <b>over</b> the Willamette Valley {{at the end of}} the last ice age. The floods almost completely inundated its geographic range, which may have caused a genetic bottleneck as survivors repopulated the region after the waters receded.|$|E
5|$|The {{waters in}} which Kimberella dwelt were {{occasionally}} disturbed by sandy currents, caused when sediments were whipped up by storms or meltwater discharge, and <b>washed</b> <b>over</b> the creatures. In {{response to this}} stress, the organisms appear to have retracted their soft parts into their shells; apparently they could not move fast enough to outrun the currents. Some organisms survived the current, and attempted to burrow {{out of the sand}} that had been deposited above them; some unsuccessful attempts can be seen where juveniles were fossilised {{at the end of a}} burrow a few centimetres long.|$|E

5|$|By 01:00, {{there was}} too much water in the hull for the pumps to handle. Water began to enter the forward {{generator}} compartments, which forced the crew to work by candlelight. Lützow was so low in the water by 01:30 that water began to flood the forward boiler room. By that point, almost all of the compartments in the forward part of the ship, up to the conning tower and below the main armored deck, were thoroughly flooded. Water had also entered the ship through shell holes in the forecastle above the armored deck; the majority of the upper portion of the ship forward of the forward-most barbette was flooded as well. The battlecruiser's crew attempted to patch the shell holes three times, but as the flooding worsened and the draft increased, water increasingly <b>washed</b> <b>over</b> the deck and inhibited progress on the repair work. The crew attempted to reverse direction and steam backwards, but this had to be abandoned when the bow became so submerged that the propellers were pulled partially out of the water; forward draft had increased to over 17meters.|$|E
5|$|In New York and {{northern}} New Jersey, the storm system left the most coastal damage since the 1944 Great Atlantic hurricane. Numerous boats were damaged or destroyed, killing two people off Staten Island. High winds swept a man off a bridge, killing him. High waves flooded {{the beach at}} Coney Island. In Sea Bright, New Jersey, waves <b>washed</b> <b>over</b> a seawall, forcing 200 people to evacuate. Further inland, the Hudson, Passaic, and Hackensack rivers experienced tidal flooding. Outside Massachusetts, damage was heaviest in southern New Jersey, where the cost was estimated at $75 million (1991 USD). Across the area, tide heights reached their highest since the 1944 hurricane, leaving severe coastal and back bay flooding and closing many roads. The storm caused significant beach erosion, with 500,000 cubic yards (382,000 cubic meters) lost in Avalon, as well as $10 million damage to the beach in Cape May. The presence of a dune system mitigated the erosion in some areas. There was damage to the Atlantic City Boardwalk. Fire Island National Seashore was affected, washing away an entire row of waterfront houses in towns like Fair Harbor. Following the storm, there was a moratorium on clamming in the state's bays, due to contaminated waters. Along the Delmarva Peninsula, there was widespread water damage to homes, including ten affected houses in Sandbridge Beach, Virginia. Tides in Ocean City, Maryland, reached a record height of , while elsewhere the tides were similar to the Ash Wednesday Storm of 1962.|$|E

25|$|East Hampton {{does not}} have the barrier beaches that run almost {{the entire length of the}} south shore of Long Island from Coney Island to Southampton. East Hampton's ocean beaches are {{connected}} to the mainland, which prevents them from being <b>washed</b> <b>over</b> in storms.|$|E
25|$|A massive wave of {{development}} <b>washed</b> <b>over</b> the Falls Church area as it {{participated in the}} rapid growth of the greater Washington area. Fields and farms, which had always separated the town from its neighbors, were rapidly developed into housing. Seven Corners, one of the region's first suburban shopping malls, opened in 1956. Its success was followed by the opening of Tyson's Corner in 1966. Their cumulative effect was to shrink Falls Church's business market considerably.|$|E

25|$|The {{degree and}} extent of damage caused by the {{earthquake}} and resulting tsunami were enormous, {{with most of the}} damage being caused by the tsunami. Video footage of the towns that were worst affected shows little more than piles of rubble, with almost no parts of any structures left standing. Estimates {{of the cost of the}} damage range well into the tens of billions of US dollars; before-and-after satellite photographs of devastated regions show immense damage to many regions. Although Japan has invested the equivalent of billions of dollars on anti-tsunami seawalls which line at least 40% of its 34,751km (21,593mi) coastline and stand up to 12m (39ft) high, the tsunami simply <b>washed</b> <b>over</b> the top of some seawalls, collapsing some in the process.|$|E
25|$|Conduit operation, {{in which}} trams took {{electricity}} from a conduit below {{and between the}} tracks, though very successful in locations such as town or city centres, proved to be very problematic on a line {{so close to the}} coast. During bad weather, sea water <b>washed</b> <b>over</b> the track and into the conduit where it short circuited the traction supply and operated the circuit breakers in the power station. Sand from the beaches was blown across the tracks and filled up the conduits. It was constantly necessary to remove this sand, as the addition of sea water would leave the conduits filled with wet sand which short circuited the supply. Another problem was that electrical resistance was greater than anticipated and the voltage in portions of the conduit was far less than that generated at Blundell Street – 230V dropped to 210V at the junction with the main line on the Promenade, 185V at Cocker Street and 168V at South Pier (then Victoria Pier).|$|E
25|$|Anyone {{who came}} into contact with a human corpse, or grave, was so ritually impure that they had to be {{sprinkled}} with the water produced from the red heifer ritual, in order to become ritually pure again; however, the person who carried out the red heifer ritual and who sprinkled the water, was to be treated as having become ritually impure by doing so. According to biblical scholars, this ritual derives from the same origin as the ritual described in Deuteronomy for a group of people to atone for murder by an unknown perpetrator, according to which a heifer is killed at a stream, and hands are <b>washed</b> <b>over</b> it; biblical scholars believe that these are both ultimately cases of sympathetic magic, and similar rituals existed in Greek and Roman mythology. The masoretic text describes the water produced from the red heifer ritual as a sin offering; some English translations discount this detail, because it differs from other sin offerings by not being killed at the altar, although biblical scholars believe that this demonstrates a failure by these translations to understand the meaning of sin offerings.|$|E

25|$|It wasn’t {{until the}} Wall Street {{stock market crash}} of 1929 that the roaring 20’s era of glitz and glamour came to an end, and with it, the flapper dress. Unable to afford the latest trends and lifestyle, the once vibrant flapper women {{returned}} to their dropped hemlines. A sudden serious tone <b>washed</b> <b>over</b> the public {{with the appearance of}} The Great Depression. Transitioning into the thirties was no easy task. Campaigns such as the “Make do and Mend” slogan were becoming prevalent to ensure there was no overconsumption throughout society. Fabric choices were among the many items to be cut back on during this poverty-stricken time. Artificial fabrics were used instead of elegant fabrics, like silk, which were so popular in the early 1900s. No longer were party dresses adorned with decorative embellishments or made brightly colored. Instead, women headed to work to take over men’s roles while they were at war. The physically demanding jobs called for the creation and social acceptance of women’s pants in society. Although the era of the flapper had vanished almost overnight, its symbol for women’s liberation would live on. No longer would a woman have to be a homemaker. The freedom to choose her role in society was created. Even though many opposed the radical era, one can see how the flapper dress helped bridge a gap between genders in society, ultimately leading in the direction of women’s rights.|$|E
500|$|The {{ferocity of}} the weather should not be underestimated. In 1868 a huge wave <b>washed</b> <b>over</b> the top of Geirum Mor, taking the sheep with it. The summit of the islet is 51 metres (170ft) above sea level. Fraser Darling and Boyd (1969) also {{speculate}} about the [...] "quiet failure" [...] of the populations of small islands like Mingulay to husband their available natural resources. Certainly the population began to exceed the carrying capacity of the land. The Congested Districts Board installed a derrick {{to assist with the}} landings at Aneir {{at the south end of}} the Bay in 1901, but the design was flawed and its failure was a further disappointment.|$|E
500|$|In Maryland, {{the storm}} struck just before high tide. A station on Assateague Island {{reported}} wind gusts of over [...] during the storm's closest approach. On the island, the storm killed 11Assateague Ponies and 20deer. The cost to repair damages at Assateague Island National Seashore {{was estimated at}} $2.5million (1992USD). High winds in eastern Maryland left 32,000people without power. The storm surge at Ocean City was estimated at 6.6ft (2m), which <b>washed</b> <b>over</b> the city's dune system in several locations. However, high waves destroyed the pier that the tidal gauge was on in the city. The combined effects of the nor'easter and the Perfect Storm from the previous October caused significant beach erosion along the Maryland coastline. In Ocean City, some streets lost a significant volume of sand while others gained sand. The cost of the lost beach was estimated between $1030million (1992USD). Low-lying sections and coastal hotels in Ocean City were flooded. West of the city, the storm damaged several summer homes, washing four houses off their foundations. Damage in Ocean City was estimated around $700,000 (1992USD), much of which to a public golf course.|$|E

500|$|Many of {{the male}} islanders {{utilised}} {{their knowledge of the}} Firth's currents to hire themselves out to passing vessels as maritime pilots. Their expertise was the product of a lifetime's experience on the waters of the Firth; as it was said, they had been [...] "dabbling in salt water from their childhood upwards". Indeed, the whole island was drenched in salt water thrown up by the powerful tides and storms to which it was subjected, particularly in the winter. The Statistical Account of Scotland noted that during a storm the sea level on the west of the island was more than two fathoms [...] higher than on the east side, and that the spray was thrown so high that it <b>washed</b> <b>over</b> the cliff tops [...] "and falls in such profusion as to run in rills to the opposite shore". The islanders took advantage of this phenomenon by capturing the water in a reservoir to power a watermill which ground their grain in the winter months. It is not now known exactly where the mill was or what happened to it. Although it is described in the Statistical Account, written in the 1790s, and a Robert Miller is listed in the 1851 census as its miller, by 1861 he had moved to farm a five-acre croft and no further mention is made of the mill in contemporary accounts.|$|E
500|$|The {{stronger}} northeast quadrant moved {{directly over}} Delaware for one tidal cycle, producing strong east-northeasterly wind gusts that peaked at [...] at a station along the Indian River. The highest tides and flooding along the Delaware coastline were between Bowers and Prime Hook National Wildlife Refuge, where high waves built momentum from the Atlantic Ocean through the Delaware Bay. In Bowers, the tide reached [...] along the Murderkill River; the reading was only [...] {{less than the}} record set during the Ash Wednesday Storm of 1962. The high tides flooded marsh vegetation in the town. In Lewes, the highest tide was , which was the second highest on record; only the 1962 storm was higher, which produced a tide of [...] The storm caused significant flooding in Dewey Beach, where a high tide of [...] marked the second-highest tide in Delaware history. The saltwater contaminated the town's water supply. The ocean <b>washed</b> <b>over</b> dunes in several locations along Delaware Bay, including in Fowler Beach where flooding reached [...] inland. Near Mispillion Light, the high tides damaged the marina and several nearby buildings. The high tides flooded marshes and low-lying areas throughout the state, which briefly closed portions of state highways 54, 26, and 1. High tides destroyed 11blocks of the boardwalk in Rehoboth Beach {{and half of the}} promenade at Bethany Beach. At nearby South Bethany, high waves destroyed three houses. Along the coast, the storm destroyed 15houses and damaged 500others, amounting to over $5million (1992USD) in property damage. In addition to the strong winds and high tides, the nor'easter produced light rainfall that did not cause any flooding. The highest total in the state was [...] in Georgetown. Due to the damage, Kent and Sussex counties were declared federal disaster areas on February6; this allocated federal funding for repairing storm damage. Then-governor Michael Castle activated the state's National Guard to assist clearing highways and prevent civilian access to damaged areas. Due to storm damage, access to Dewey Beach and Rehoboth Beach were restricted to residents.|$|E
