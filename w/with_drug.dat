5|$|A judge banned all filming {{but this}} ruling was {{overturned}} by an injunction. Although officials were angry, the residents were not and Jackson {{was surrounded by}} crowds of enthusiastic onlookers during filming. One woman managed to push through security to hug Jackson who continued dancing while hugging her. Another woman appeared and hugged him from behind. He then {{fell to the ground}} as police pulled the two women off him and escorted them away. After the director helped Jackson get up off the street, he continued to sing and dance. This incident made it into the music video. 1,500 policemen and 50 residents acting as security guards effectively sealed off the Dona Marta favela. Some residents and officials found it offensive that Jackson's production team had negotiated <b>with</b> <b>drug</b> dealers in order to gain permission to film in one of the city's shantytowns.|$|E
5|$|As a major {{industrial}} city into the mid-20th century, Omaha shared in social tensions of larger cities that accompanied rapid growth and many new immigrants and migrants. By the 1950s, Omaha was {{a center for}} illegal gambling, while experiencing dramatic job losses and unemployment because of dramatic restructuring of the railroads and the meatpacking industry, {{as well as other}} sectors. Persistent poverty resulting from racial discrimination and job losses generated different crimes in the late 20th century, <b>with</b> <b>drug</b> trade and drug abuse becoming associated with violent crime rates, which climbed after 1986 as Los Angeles gangs made affiliates in the city.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1990s, friends were {{concerned}} about the Marquess's addiction to drugs, particularly since multiple prison sentences had done nothing to alleviate it. He was deported from Australia in April 1990 and charged <b>with</b> <b>drug</b> possession in November 1991 and March 1992. That October, his estate company was liquidated with debts over £650,000. In June 1993, he avoided a jail sentence by being ordered to attend a rehabilitation clinic, but travelled to the South of France instead and was sentenced to 10 months in an open prison, where he was released after five. He was arrested again in September 1994 for possession.|$|E

5|$|Following {{a period}} of {{personal}} and legal troubles <b>with</b> <b>drug</b> addiction, Gil Scott-Heron recorded and released his first album of original material in sixteen years, I'm New Here (2010), {{with the assistance of}} XL Recordings-label head Richard Russell. Produced by Russell, the album served as a departure from Scott-Heron's earlier work, both musically and thematically, eschewing its soul, jazz, and funk styles and social commentary for more personal, reflective lyrics with ruminations on love, loss, and identity, set to contemporary electronic music. It was well received by fans and music critics, who viewed it as a comeback for Scott-Heron.|$|E

5|$|Indonesian {{law does}} not require that arrested people be {{immediately}} charged with an offence, and by 22 April 2005 no charges had yet been laid. Police indicated that the five arrested at the airport would be charged <b>with</b> <b>drug</b> trafficking, which carries the death penalty, while those arrested in the hotel would be charged with the lesser offence of drug possession, which carries a maximum penalty of ten years' imprisonment. It was suggested that Andrew Chan recruited the other eight to act as drug mules – couriers who would not arouse suspicion while carrying heroin to Australia – and offered them A$10,000 to A$15,000 each {{to carry out this}} task, and given A$5000 spending cash.|$|E
5|$|On May 3, 1969, customs {{agents at}} Toronto International Airport {{detained}} Hendrix after finding {{a small amount}} of what they suspected to be heroin and hashish in his luggage. Four hours later, after a mobile lab confirmed what had been found, he was formally charged <b>with</b> <b>drug</b> possession. Released on $10,000 bail, Hendrix was required to return on May 5 for an arraignment hearing. During a performance at Maple Leaf Gardens later that night, he displayed a jovial attitude, joking with the audience and singing a few lines of mock opera for comedic effect.|$|E
5|$|Robinson's eldest son, Jackie Robinson Jr., had {{emotional}} trouble {{during his}} childhood and entered special education {{at an early}} age. He enrolled in the Army {{in search of a}} disciplined environment, served in the Vietnam War, and was wounded in action on November 19, 1965. After his discharge, he struggled <b>with</b> <b>drug</b> problems. Robinson Jr. eventually completed the treatment program at Daytop Village in Seymour, Connecticut, and became a counselor at the institution. On June 17, 1971, he was killed in an automobile accident at age 24. The experience with his son's drug addiction turned Robinson Sr. into an avid anti-drug crusader {{toward the end of his}} life.|$|E

5|$|While Croitoru was {{awaiting}} {{trial for the}} bombing, the Hamilton branch of Satan's Choice was shut down after an informant gave the police information about the gang's involvement <b>with</b> <b>drug</b> dealing and extortion. The gang's clubhouse was confiscated and the club's national leadership decided to disband the Hamilton chapter. Croitoru got in a fight in Hamilton with another former Satan's Choice member on January 13, 1998. A police officer saw Croitoru punch the other man {{in the face and}} arrested Croitoru for assault. In addition to the assault charge, Croitoru was charged with extortion from an unrelated incident as well as carrying a concealed weapon and breaking the conditions of his release following the police station bombing.

He admitted to have worked <b>with</b> <b>drug</b> distributor Ramón Torresillos-Rendón, and that he used him as a mediator for a drug transaction with an undercover federal agent. In court, Francisco Rafael admitted having sent Torresillos-Rendón and four other individuals to sell nine ounces of cocaine to the agent. He was arrested in California on 7 August 1980 and remained under custody until or around 8 September 1980 after paying a US$150,000 bond and promising to appear at every court session. Nonetheless, he fled to Mexico shortly afterwards and did not appear in court on 8 October 1980.|$|E
