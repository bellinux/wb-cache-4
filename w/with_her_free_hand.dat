60|$|Something in {{the agony}} of his appeal, {{something}} in the pathos of Elsa's defiant attitude must have struck a more gentle cord in the Jewess' heart.

60|$|Then Moore was silent, holding <b>her</b> <b>with</b> his <b>free</b> <b>hand,</b> {{breathing}} hard, {{and slowly}} quieting down. Columbine felt {{then that he}} {{knew that there was}} something terribly wrong, and that perhaps he dared not voice his fear. At any rate, he silently held her, waiting. That silent wait grew unendurable for Columbine. She wanted to prolong this moment that was to be all she could ever surrender. But she dared not do so, for she knew if he ever kissed her again her duty to Belllounds would vanish like mist in the sun.|$|R
5000|$|Vasudhara or Vasundhara, the 'treasure holder', is {{a popular}} Newar goddess of {{fertility}} and prosperity, and a consort of the wealth-god Jambhala. She sits in the posture of 'royal ease' on a moon disc and a pink lotus, <b>with</b> <b>her</b> left leg drawn up and her extended right foot resting (similar posture to Green Tara - showing her willingness to [...] "come down from her lotus throne" [...] {{to help those who}} call upon her) upon a white conch shell (symbolising having conquered/having perfect control of speech) and a golden treasure-vase (wealth/prosperity). She is beautiful and attractive, as youthful as a sixteen-year-old, and her golden body scintillates <b>with</b> radiant light. <b>Her</b> three beautiful and smiling faces are coloured red (right - red being the colour of controlling), golden (centre, golden being the colour of increasing), and red (left), representing perfect compassion, wisdom understanding, awareness and insight into the past, present and future, she is adorned with the five divine silks and the eight jewelled ornaments. Her first right hand makes the gesture of generosity, while her other two right hands hold the 'Three Jewels' of the Buddha, Dharma and Sangha, - symbolising the necessity of maintaining the commitments of refuge to the three jewels, and a golden rosary, symbolising continuous practise and self-examination, vital to enlightenment. <b>With</b> <b>her</b> three left hands she holds a small treasure-vase, for long life and intitiation, an ear of grain, for abundant harvests and earthly benefits, and a sacred text to grant wisdom. In her hands, Vasudhara holds a variety of objects attributed to her. Most representations show her holding a sheaf of corn in her left hand, symbolizing an abundant harvest. [...] She may also be holding a gem or small treasure, a symbol of wealth. Representations with more arms, such as the six-armed Nepali representation, also depict her holding a full vase and the Book of Wisdom. <b>With</b> <b>her</b> <b>free</b> <b>hands,</b> Vasudhara performs mudras. A commonly seen mudra in paintings and figurines featuring Vasudhara is the varada mudra, also known as the charity mudra, which symbolizes the “pouring forth of divine blessings.”In her 2 armed one faced form, she has a golden body, representing the earth element, Ratnasambhava in her crown, sometimes 2 eyes or 3 eyes, if with 3 eyes - representing perfect awareness, understanding, compassion, wisdom and insight into the past, present and future. Her 2 hands holding a sheaf or corn for agricultural prosperity and to [...] "sew the seeds" [...] of enlightenment, and either a single wishfulfilling jewel or a bowl of wish fulfilling jewels for wealth and wish fulfilment. Vasudhara is the subject of numerous bronzes and paintings. She is predominantly the central figure of bronze sculptures or painted mandalas. She may also, however, appear alongside her consort, Vaiśravaṇa (Jambhala) the Buddhist God of Riches. Despite his status, she surpasses him in popularity and is more commonly the central figure of her own mandalas.|$|R

60|$|At {{that moment}} {{she heard a}} sound in the court, as of some one approaching, and to avoid letting others know of this {{fascinating}} secret the girl thoughtlessly grasped the adobe door <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>free</b> <b>hand</b> and swung it shut behind her.|$|E
50|$|Milla ends up at {{the edge}} of a burnt field, she calms down and starts to head back to Tal when she realizes there is {{something}} underneath her, a quick glance shows that she is on the only patch of green grass in the area. She then jumps just in time as the creature, called a Hugthing, snaps shut, clasping <b>her</b> legs together. <b>With</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>free</b> she hacks at the Hugthing <b>with</b> <b>her</b> sword, but it just bounces off. Just as her ribs are about to break Odris appears in the sky and hurls lighting bolts at the creature. it lets go and runs away making scared noises. She and Milla walk together through the trees when they run into a pack of giant hunting birds, the pack of birds then chase the pair until they reach a giant tower carved from a gigantic tree, where Odris lands on top. Milla takes the stairs to the bottom floor and can't explain why the door is wide open but the birds, called Nanuchs remain content to remain outside and wait for them to come out.|$|R
50|$|Movement in {{the game}} is varied and allows for complex {{interactions}} with the environment. Besides walking, running, and jumping, Lara can perform side-steps, hang on ledges, roll over, dive, and swim through water. In a free environment, Lara has two basic stances: one with weapons drawn and one <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>free.</b> By default she carries two pistols with infinite ammo. Additional weapons include the shotgun, dual magnums and dual Uzis. At {{a certain point in}} the story, Lara will be stripped of all her weapons, leaving the player defenceless and forced to recover her pistols, a development which later became a staple of the series. Numerous enemies as well as a variety of lethal traps can bring about Lara's death in Tomb Raider, the most important threat of which is falling to death. As the game adopts a platform style approach of progress, well timed jumps must often bring Lara safely {{to the other side of}} a ledge or she will plummet to the ground below. Other means by which the game will prematurely end include death by burning, drowning, electrocution, becoming impaled on spikes, killed by human enemies, or creatures and even being turned into gold by the hand of Midas.|$|R
5000|$|On 6 January 1789 {{a letter}} written at Ellisland Farm to Mr Robert Ainslie {{makes it clear that}} Jenny Clow had served Burns with a writ and he {{intended}} to travel to Edinburgh, to [...] "settle that matter <b>with</b> <b>her,</b> and <b>free</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> of the process". [...] She was suffering at this time from TB, from which she eventually died in January 1792.Whilst he was in Dumfries in November 1791, three years after the birth of Robert Burns Clow, Robert Burns received a letter from Agnes McLehose, informing him that Jenny Clow [...] "to all appearances is at this moment dying. Obliged, from all the symptoms of a rapid decay, to quit her service, she is gone to a room almost without common necessaries, untended and unmourned. In circumstances so distressing, to whom can she so naturally look for aid as to the father of her child, the man for whose sake she has suffered many a sad and anxious night, shut from the world, with no other companions than guilt and solitude? You have now an opportunity to evince you indeed possess those fine feelings you have delineated, so as to claim the just admiration of your country. I am convinced I need add nothing farther to persuade you to act as every consideration of humanity must dictate." [...] Burns asked Mrs McLehose to get a porter to take five shillings from him to Jenny Clow.|$|R

Mrs. Gallilee said, [...] "I am waiting for you, Mr. Le Frank." ...|$|E
60|$|Billy declined, {{being of}} the opinion {{that it would be better}} in the morning. Saxon was troubled, and as she dozed off she knew that he was lying restlessly wide awake. A few minutes afterward, roused by a heavy blast of wind and rain on the canvas, she heard Billy softly groaning. She raised herself on her elbow and <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>free</b> <b>hand,</b> in the way she knew, {{manipulating}} his forehead and the surfaces around his eyes, soothed him off to sleep.|$|E
6000|$|A {{whiff of}} wind down the big-throated chimney stirred the log embers on the hearth, {{and the girl}} jumped to her feet, closing the book with an {{impatient}} snap. She knew her mother's voice would follow. It was hard to leave her heroine at the crucial moment of receiving an explanation from a presumed faithless lover, just to climb a hill and take {{in a lot of}} soulless washing, but such are the infelicities of stolen romance reading. She threw the clothes-basket over her head like a hood, the handle resting across her bosom and shoulders, and <b>with</b> both <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>free</b> started out of the cabin. But the darkness had come up from the valley in one stride after its mountain fashion, had outstripped her, and she was instantly plunged in it. Still the outline of the ridge above <b>her</b> was visible, <b>with</b> the white, steadfast stars that were not there a moment ago, and by that sign she knew she was late. She had to battle against the rushing wind now, which sung through the inverted basket over her head and held <b>her</b> back, but <b>with</b> bent shoulders she at last {{reached the top of the}} ridge and the level. Yet here, owing to the shifting of the lighter background above her, she now found herself again encompassed with the darkness. The outlines of the poles had disappeared, the white fluttering garments were distinct apparitions waving in the wind, like dancing ghosts. But there certainly was a queer misshapen bulk moving beyond, which she did not recognize, and as she at last reached one of the poles, a shock was communicated to it, through the clothes-line and the bulk beyond. Then she heard a voice say impatiently,-- ...|$|R
60|$|For reply, Saxon reached <b>her</b> <b>free</b> <b>hand</b> over to {{the hand}} that rested on Billy's arm.|$|R
60|$|She raised <b>her</b> <b>free</b> <b>hand</b> to his {{shoulder}} and swayed toward him. He held her a moment, clasped tight, and then released her.|$|R
60|$|His arm, like {{a band of}} iron, held her, yet it was {{flexible}} and yielded her to {{the motion of the}} horse. One instant she felt the brawn, the bone, heavy and powerful; the next the stretch and ripple, the elasticity of muscles. He held her as easily {{as if she were a}} child. The roughness of his flannel shirt rubbed her cheek, and beneath that she felt the dampness of the scarf he had used to bathe her arm, and deeper still the regular pound of his heart. Against her ear, filling it with strong, vibrant beat, his heart seemed a mighty engine deep within a great cavern. Her head had never before rested on a man's breast, and she had no liking for it there; but she felt more than the physical contact. The position was mysterious and fascinating, and something natural in it made her think of life. Then as the cool wind blew down from the heights, loosening her tumbled hair, she was compelled to see strands of it curl softly into Stewart's face, before his eyes, across his lips. She was unable to reach it <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>free</b> <b>hand,</b> and therefore could not refasten it. And when she shut her eyes she felt those loosened strands playing against his cheeks.|$|E
60|$|Flora {{with the}} toy {{in her hand}} looked round at her companion; then seeing his {{attention}} had been solicited in another quarter she moved away with the shop-girl, who had evidently offered to conduct her into the presence of more objects of the same sort. When she reached the indicated spot I {{was in a position}} still to observe her. She had asked some question about the working of the toy, and the girl, taking it herself, began to explain the little secret. Flora bent her head over it, but she clearly didn't understand. I saw her, in a manner that quickened my curiosity, give a glance back at the place from which she had come. Lord Iffield was talking with another young person; she satisfied herself of this by the aid of a question addressed to her own attendant. She then drew closer to the table near which she stood and, turning her back to me, bent her head lower over the collection of toys and more particularly over the small object the girl had attempted to explain. She took it again and, after a moment, with her face well averted, made an odd motion of her arms and a significant little duck of her head. These slight signs, singular as it may appear, produced in my bosom an agitation so great that I failed to notice Lord Iffield's whereabouts. He had rejoined her; he was close upon her before I knew it or before she knew it herself. I felt at that instant the strangest of all promptings: if it could have operated more rapidly it would have caused me to dash between them in some such manner as to give Flora a caution. In fact as it was I think I could have done this in time had I not been checked by a curiosity stronger still than my impulse. There were three seconds during which I saw the young man and yet let him come on. Didn't I make the quick calculation that if he didn't catch what Flora was doing I too might perhaps not catch it? She at any rate herself took the alarm. On perceiving her companion's nearness she made, still averted, another duck of her head and a shuffle of her hands so precipitate that a little tin steamboat she had been holding escaped from them and rattled down to the floor with a sharpness that I hear at this hour. Lord Iffield had already seized her arm; with a violent jerk he brought her round toward him. Then it was that there met my eyes a quite distressing sight: this exquisite creature, blushing, glaring, exposed, with a pair of big black- rimmed eye-glasses, defacing her by their position, crookedly astride of her beautiful nose. She made a grab at them <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>free</b> <b>hand</b> while I turned confusedly away.|$|E

Once upon a time she walks out for a multitude of strange revelations and episodes, including naked Mongols (asking for the ticket), talking dogs and a very strange circus. The main character Kiti recalls in the story a part of Hungary as Kovács himself visited virtually every summer during the youth - grandfather was a youngster.

60|$|Michael, his forefeet on the gunwale, barked {{to him in}} a puzzled, {{questioning}} sort of way, and Jerry whimpered back incommunicable understanding.

She gathered his body close against her breast in one encircling arm, <b>her</b> <b>free</b> <b>hand</b> resting on the rail, half-closed, a pink- and-white heart of flower, fragrant and seducing. Jerry's nose quested the way of it. The aperture invited.

5000|$|One {{hallmark}} of Mishkutionok/Dmitriev's style was their creative spins, especially {{one in which}} Mishkutionok would do a split and point <b>her</b> head down, <b>with</b> an arm around Dmitriev's calf so that they were both vertical and aligned; this signature move, called [...] "Natasha's spin" [...] was incorporated into most of their programs. Another signature move was a backwards inside death spiral in which Mishkutionok bent backwards, holding her foot behind and above her head while Dmitriev also held her raised skate blade and <b>her</b> <b>free</b> <b>hand.</b> Mishkutionok/Dmitriev competed before, during, and after {{the breakup of the}} Soviet Union, thus, they competed for the Soviet Union, the Unified Team, and Russia, all within a four-year period.|$|R
