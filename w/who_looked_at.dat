She later described what she saw in great detail: the lady was wearing a light summer dress, on her head was a shady white hat, and she had lots of fair hair. Moberly thought she was a tourist at first, but the dress appeared to be old-fashioned. Moberly came to believe that the lady was Marie Antoinette. Jourdain, however, did not see the lady.|$|E
5|$|Even Born was {{surprised}} to discover that Paul Dirac had been thinking along the same lines as Heisenberg. Soon Wolfgang Pauli used the matrix method to calculate the energy values of the hydrogen atom, and found that they agreed with the Bohr model. Another important contribution was made by Erwin Schrödinger, <b>who</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the problem using wave mechanics. This {{had a great deal of}} appeal to many at the time, as it offered the possibility of returning to deterministic classical physics. Born would have none of this, as it ran counter to facts determined by experiment. He formulated the now-standard interpretation of the probability density function for ψ*ψ in the Schrödinger equation, which he published in July 1926.|$|E

25|$|Thorstein Veblen {{laid the}} {{foundation}} for the perspective of institutional economics with his criticism of traditional static economic theory. As much as Veblen was an economist, he was also a sociologist who rejected his contemporaries <b>who</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the economy as an autonomous, stable, and static entity. Veblen disagreed with his peers, as he strongly believed that the economy was significantly embedded in social institutions. Rather than separating economics from the social sciences, Veblen viewed the relationships between the economy and social and cultural phenomena. Generally speaking, the study of institutional economics viewed economic institutions as the broader process of cultural development. While economic institutionalism never transformed into a major school of economic thought, it allowed economists to explore economic problems from a perspective that incorporated social and cultural phenomena. It also allowed economists to view the economy as an evolving entity of bounded rationale.|$|E

25|$|During the Edo period (1603–1868) {{there was}} a flourishing of the visual and {{performance}} arts particularly through proliferation of ukiyo-e ("pictures of the floating world"). Etoki once again became popular during the later eighteenth century as storytellers began to set up on street corners with an unrolled scroll hanging from a pole. In the Meiji Period (1868–1912) tachi-e ("stand-up pictures"), {{similar to those in}} the Edo period, were told by performers who manipulated flat-paper cut-outs of figures mounted on wooden poles (similar to the shadow puppets of Indonesia and Malaysia). The Zen priest Nishimura is also credited to have used these pictures during sermons to entertain children. Another form of etoki was the Japanese modified stereoscope imported from the Netherlands. Much smaller in size, six engravings of landscapes and everyday scenes would be placed one behind the other on top of the device and lowered when required so that the viewer, <b>who</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> them through a lens, could experience the illusion of space created by this device. The artistic and technological developments of the Edo and Meiji periods can be linked to the establishment of kamishibai.|$|E

2500|$|India {{provides}} an example of the British Empire pouring its money and expertise into a very well built system designed for military reasons (after the Mutiny of 1857), with the hope that it would stimulate industry. The system was overbuilt and too expensive for the small amount of freight traffic it carried. [...] Christensen (1996), <b>who</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> colonial purpose, local needs, capital, service, and private-versus-public interests, concluded that making the railways a creature of the state hindered success because railway expenses had to go through the same time-consuming and political budgeting process as did all other state expenses. Railway costs could therefore not be tailored to the timely needs of the railways or their passengers.|$|E

2500|$|The first {{empirical}} {{study that}} tested {{the requirements of}} the storage effect was done by Pake and Venable, <b>who</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> three desert annual plants. [...] They experimentally manipulated density and water availability over a two-year period, and found that fitness and germination rates varied greatly from year to year, and over different environmental conditions. [...] This shows that each species has a unique environmental response, and implied that likely there is a covariance between environment and competition. [...] This, combined with the buffered population growth that is a product of a long-lived seed bank, showed that a temporal storage effect was probably an important factor in mediating coexistence. [...] This study was also important, because it showed that variation in germination conditions could be a major factor promoting species coexitstence.|$|E
2500|$|As {{they were}} going below, Francisco Portusach sailed across {{the bow of the}} Charleston in a {{whaleboat}} with the American flag at the topmast. A loud voice from the ship called, [...] "Frank, come on board." [...] Portusach looked up to the deck and saw Captain Hallett, a man whom he had known years before. The skipper of the whaleboat then went to the lee side of the cruiser and clambered aboard. When he reached the deck, he was surprised to find a reporter with whom he was acquainted, a representative of the San Francisco Chronicle. While the reporter and the old whaling captain were talking about old times, Lieutenant William Braunersreuther, the navigator, walked up to Portusach and demanded to know by what right he was hoisting the American flag at the topmast of the little boat. The Guam merchant merely grinned and replied the flag was being flown legally. The lieutenant promptly requested proof, and Portusach produced American naturalization papers from an inside coat pocket and handed them to the doubting Braunersreuther <b>who</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> them and said, [...] "Well! Twenty-second of October, 1888, Chicago, Cook County, State of Illinois." [...] The navigator examined the document more thoroughly and requested Portusach to accompany him to visit Glass. The [...] "welcoming party" [...] had just departed for shore, so the two men entered the captain's cabin, and the lieutenant handed the naturalization papers to Glass <b>who</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> them for a few moments. He had already heard from José Portusach that Francisco possessed some lighters and boats, so he greeted the merchant by inquiring if it was possible to obtain the use of two lighters and a boat to transfer coal from the City of Peking to the bunkers of the Charleston and offered to pay for the service. Portusach agreed to furnish the boats without compensation since he felt an obligation, as the only United States citizen on the island, to aid his country in time of war.|$|E
2500|$|Cage {{returned}} to the United States in 1931. He went to Santa Monica, California, where he made a living partly by giving small, private lectures on contemporary art. He got to know various important figures of the Southern California art world, such as pianist Richard Buhlig (who became his first teacher) and arts patron Galka Scheyer. By 1933 Cage decided to concentrate on music rather than painting. [...] "The people who heard my music had better {{things to say about}} it than the people <b>who</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> my paintings had to say about my paintings", Cage later explained. In 1933 he sent some of his compositions to Henry Cowell; the reply was a [...] "rather vague letter", in which Cowell suggested that Cage study with Arnold Schoenberg—Cage's musical ideas at the time included composition based on a 25-tone row, somewhat similar to Schoenberg's twelve-tone technique. Cowell also advised that, before approaching Schoenberg, Cage should take some preliminary lessons, and recommended Adolph Weiss, a former Schoenberg pupil.|$|E

2500|$|Bosworth {{had contact}} {{with many of the}} Pentecostal and holiness ministers of his generation, and was both {{influenced}} by them and influenced them. [...] Prior to coming to his Pentecostal experience, Bosworth spent several years under the ministry of John Alexander Dowie, where he would have heard many of Dowie's ideas on divine healing. [...] From Zion City he knew John G. Lake, Charles Parham, {{and a number of other}} Pentecostal pioneers. [...] In mid-1907, Bosworth, Lake, and Tom Hezmalhalch were visited by William Seymour and Glenn Cook from Los Angeles, thus leading to close contacts with the Azusa Street Revival. He was associated with many of the early Pentecostal ministers, had Maria Woodworth-Etter hold several months of services for him in 1912, and knew the early leaders of the Assemblies of God. [...] Bosworth also knew many of the ministers associated with the Christian and Missionary Alliance church, including A.B. Simpson and both Paul and Luke Rader. [...] While in the Chicago area, Bosworth also met E. W. Kenyon. [...] It is unclear whether his meeting with Kenyon was before his move to Texas, since he had returned to the Chicago area by 1924. How close a relationship the two men had and the degree Kenyon may have influenced Bosworth's early thinking are unclear. Bosworth's 1930's booklet [...] "The Christian Confession", which was later condensed into a chapter of the 1948 edition of [...] "Christ the Healer", mentions that many of the thoughts in that booklet / chapter came from some of Kenyon's writings and were used with permission. [...] One researcher, <b>who</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> Bosworth's other works to determine if any were influenced by Kenyon could find no other link, and the 1924 edition of [...] "Christ the Healer" [...] does not contain the chapter that is in the 1948 edition.|$|E
2500|$|Calling {{the uproar}} messy, Caroline Framke of Vox said killing off Lexa [...] "may have alienated part of [...] for good[...]" [...] She argued that [...] "on the one hand, [...] death was gut wrenching, and it {{unexpectedly}} brought together several disparate story strands in The 100 's floundering third season. On the other, Lexa was an openly queer woman leading 12 armies, a rare sight for LGBTQ representation on television. Less rare, unfortunately, is the trope {{of television and}} movies killing gay women off for shock value." [...] Framke was especially critical of the show having Lexa die immediately after having sex and pillow talk with Clarke, which were long-awaited scenes; to Framke, this signaled [...] "sex, love, death", particularly for lesbian couples. Eric Goldman of IGN argued similarly, stating, [...] "No, no, no, no, no. [...] If there's one thing I truly hate about how Lexa's death was handled, it's this." [...] Feeling that this setup was [...] "really trite and cliché", and made worse by the dead lesbian trope, he commented, [...] "While I don't think The 100 writers ever intended to imply 'sex = death,' it ended up coming off that way." [...] He felt fans of the couple [...] "were truly manipulated and treated poorly" [...] and that, given how important the couple was to people, they deserved more time to see them happy. [...] "To the LGBTQ fandom <b>who</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> Lexa as important, I can sympathize," [...] he said, [...] "but as a straight white male, I wouldn't dream of saying 'I totally get it.'" [...] Goldman, like Framke, however, felt Lexa's death was {{a good opportunity to}} propel the show's story of artificial intelligence (AI) with respect to Lexa forward. [...] "If The 100 is smart—and it usually is—Lexa's death will be the defining moment of the season," [...] he said.|$|E
