In 1893 William Rose invented the world's first packaging machine, {{and two years}} later bought the Trentside Works site and started to rapidly expand his packaging machine business. Rose's diversified into many other areas, and for many years they were associated with many household brands which produced the demand items of the day, including starch, razor blades and sweets, including Cadbury's chocolates after which the Roses selection is named. They produced seaside rock-making machines, cigarette-making machines and bread-slicing and <b>wrapping</b> <b>machines.</b> When the company closed, A.M.P Rose bought the confectionery packaging side of the business.|$|E

In the process of packaging Flipped-off (FO) type of infusion, there is wrapping process done by <b>wrapping</b> <b>machine.</b> At this process is expected no defect product [...] However, in fact defect product is still exist. In March to May 2016 total reject products in a row are 1204 bags, 1357 bags, and 960 bags. It happened because <b>wrapping</b> <b>machine</b> is often experienced breakdown. Based of those problems above, observation is done to find the biggest loss factor of the <b>wrapping</b> <b>machine,</b> measuring overall <b>wrapping</b> <b>machine</b> effectiveness, and to do an improvement that will decrease downtime of <b>wrapping</b> <b>machine.</b> Problem solving is done by measuring Six Big Losses and use pareto diagram to find the biggest loss factor. Fishbone diagram is also used to find factors that affect the biggest loss factor. Next step is measuring Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) of <b>wrapping</b> <b>machine.</b> To measure OEE, the calculation of Availability, Performace Efficiency, and Quality rate are needed first. Then those values is compared with the world standard of each value. Based on this whole observation, there are two biggest loss factors, they are reduced speed and idling and minor stoppages. These loss factors influenced the value of Performance Efficiency which is lower than the world standard, based on the measurement that had been done.

50|$|The {{turning moment}} arises because the <b>wrapping</b> <b>machine</b> passes a heavy drum of cable around the machine axis {{so as to}} wrap the fibre optic cable onto the host conductor. This motion is {{achieved}} {{by means of a}} gearbox that converts the linear travel of the <b>wrapping</b> <b>machine</b> along the conductor into a rotating movement of the drum carrier. The force of moving the drum in one direction (say clockwise around the conductor) causes a resultant force to act on the machine in the opposite direction, making the <b>wrapping</b> <b>machine</b> spin on its own axis (counter-clockwise in this example). Frictional effects from the machine’s grip on the conductor can be used to counter this to some degree, but in practice it is insufficient and the required stability can only be achieved by having a relatively large weight suspended rigidly below the conductor from the non-rotating part of the <b>wrapping</b> <b>machine.</b> The motor unit is heavy, has a good grip on the conductor and so is often used to provide the necessary stability. For rope-pulled machines with no motor unit, a separate ‘keel weight’ is used to achieve the same effect.|$|R

50|$|St. Louis baker Gustav Papendick bought Rohwedder's second bread slicer {{and set out}} {{to improve}} it by devising a way to keep the slices {{together}} at least long enough to allow the loaves to be wrapped.

The tray aligned the slices, allowing mechanized <b>wrapping</b> <b>machines</b> to function.|$|E
5000|$|The {{installation}} machinery {{carries a}} drum of {{fibre optic cable}} along the host conductor on the overhead line, passing the drum around and around the conductor. The machine pays out the cable at a controlled tension and wraps the cable around the host conductor at a helical pitch of about 1 metre. The <b>wrapping</b> <b>machine</b> may be pulled by hand using a rope from the ground {{or it may be}} self-propelled and radio controlled. Motive power may be provided by a petrol engine or a battery pack. The motive power unit may be built into the <b>wrapping</b> <b>machine</b> or it may be a separate unit. Separate units are frequently called [...] "Tug" [...] or [...] "Puller" [...] and have the advantage that two smaller pieces of equipment are easier to handle {{at the top of a}} tower or pole than one big piece.|$|R
50|$|There are {{designs of}} <b>wrapping</b> <b>machine</b> that are self-balancing, using two drums of cable carried {{one on each}} side of the machine axis: the Teralink (Russian) device {{dispenses}} a single cable that is pre-wound onto 2 drums.

5000|$|In {{order to}} post-tension the {{concrete}} roof, the construction crews used the <b>wrapping</b> <b>machine</b> to <b>wrapped</b> {{the edge of}} the roof in miles of steel wire and pull the wires extremely tight. The effect is similar to a rubber band. The rubber band (the steel wire) wants to constrict into a smaller circle, while the roof of Assembly Hall pushes radially outward. The two forces are designed to cancel each other out. In order to create the required stress, the wire was pulled through a steel die that reduced its diameter. The first 75% of steel wire was pulled through a 0.211-in.-dia die to create a 130,000-psi stress. The last 25% of steel wire was pulled through a 0.214-in.-dia die to create a 120,000-psi stress. [...] The <b>wrapping</b> <b>machine</b> was propelled by a 200-hp motor, along an endless chain 1260 ft long around the circumference of the dome. Average speed of the machine was 8 mph.|$|R
50|$|Whoppers {{were first}} sold unwrapped, two pieces for one cent.

50|$|In 1832, the Neptune Mill was {{constructed}} beside a dam just North of the Salmon River Cove. The Card Company, {{as it was}} then known also made stocking yarn and carpet warp. New cord <b>wrapping</b> <b>machines</b> filled these mills and twine was produced on a massive scale. Over the years, the Neptune Mill expanded until it reached its 100x100 ft dimensions. Three stories tall, it was a massive edifice, architecturally resembling a church with its steeple and bell that would call workers into the factory each morning.|$|E
50|$|By {{the early}} 1920s average {{turnover}} was £570,000, representing 650 tons of chocolate and 1,500 tons of sweets, {{with a range}} now including Christmas boxes and Easter eggs. There were 1,700 employees, mainly female, with many more employed on a seasonal (especially pre-Christmas and pre-Easter) basis. However, although the company was large, {{it was not a}} truly national firm, and never had more than about one per cent of the market. In 1927, the factory packing areas were air-conditioned, enabling sweet packing to continue in all weathers. Sweet wrappers were introduced in the early 1920s, but this process was undertaken by hand until the first <b>wrapping</b> <b>machines</b> were introduced in 1928.|$|E
