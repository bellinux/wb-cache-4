5|$|I am {{not quite}} {{certain that the}} present {{regulations}} governing the arrangement of matches give entire satisfaction, {{and it would be}} worth considering <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not be arranged so that each team would play once at home and once at the place where their opponents hail from.|$|E
5|$|Medical {{students}} at London's teaching hospitals were enraged by the plaque. The {{first year of}} the statue's existence was a quiet one, while University College explored <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> take legal action over it, but from November 1907 the students turned Battersea into the scene of frequent disruption.|$|E
5|$|In 1967, {{when the}} King Island emu was still {{thought to be}} only known from prehistoric remains, James Greenway {{questioned}} <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> have been exterminated by a few natives, and speculated that fires started by prehistoric men or lightning may have been responsible. At this time, the mainland emu was also threatened by overhunting, and Greenway cautioned that it could end up sharing the fate of its island relatives if no measures were taken in time.|$|E
30|$|For level 1, {{the views}} of the {{learners}} were solicited. The questions concerned the degree to which learning experience was valuable, <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> felt the training was effective, and <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> believed <b>they</b> <b>could</b> apply what <b>they</b> learned.|$|R
50|$|The PDP-11 {{supports}} hardware interrupts at four priority levels. Interrupts are {{serviced by}} software service routines, which <b>could</b> specify <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> themselves <b>could</b> be interrupted (achieving interrupt nesting). The event {{that causes the}} interrupt is indicated by the device itself, as it informs the processor of the address of its own interrupt vector.|$|R
50|$|The {{administrators of}} Transbus International Ltd {{applied to the}} court under IA 1986 Sch B1, para 63 for {{directions}} about <b>whether</b> or not <b>they</b> <b>could</b> effect a sale of the business.|$|R
5|$|Although {{the police}} were sure murder had taken place, and {{that at least one}} of the four was guilty, they were {{uncertain}} <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> secure a conviction. Police also suspected there had been other murders committed, but the lack of bodies hampered this line of enquiry. As news of the possibility of other murders came to the public's attention, newspapers began to publish lurid and inaccurate stories of the crimes; speculative reports led members of the public to assume that all missing people had been victims. Janet Brown went to the police and identified her friend Mary Paterson's clothing, while a local baker informed them that Jamie Wilson's trousers were being worn by Constantine Burke's son. On 19 November a warrant for the murder of Jamie Wilson was made against the four suspects.|$|E
5|$|During {{the summer}} of 1994, Pixar's story {{department}} began turning their thoughts to their next film. The storyline for A Bug's Life originated from a lunchtime conversation between John Lasseter, Andrew Stanton, Pete Docter, and Joe Ranft, the studio's head story team; other films such as Monsters, Inc. and Finding Nemo were also conceived at this lunch. Lasseter and his story team had already been drawn {{to the idea of}} insects serving as characters. Like toys, insects were within the reach of computer animation back then, due to their relatively simple surfaces. Stanton and Ranft wondered <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> find a starting point in Aesop's fable The Ant and the Grasshopper. Walt Disney had produced his own version with a cheerier ending decades earlier in the 1934 short film The Grasshopper and the Ants. In addition, Walt Disney Feature Animation (now Walt Disney Animation Studios) had considered producing a film in the late-1980s entitled Army Ants, that centered around a pacifist ant living in a militaristic colony, but this never fully materialized.|$|E
5|$|Following the 2009 {{legislative}} session, Attorney General Jack Conway {{was asked}} to issue advisory opinions on two gambling-related issues. Republican state senator Damon Thayer asked for an opinion as to whether Instant Racing – allowing individuals to bet {{on the outcome of}} previously run horse races – would be allowable under the state constitution. Democratic Representative Jody Richards also asked for an advisory opinion as to whether a constitutional amendment was required to allow video lottery terminals at the state's racetracks or <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> be construed as legal under the amendment that allowed a state lottery. Critics charged that Conway had a conflict of interest in the matter because his father {{was a member of the}} Kentucky Horse Racing Commission, but Conway denied that a conflict existed, and the state Executive Branch Ethics Board refused to take a position unless an official request for an investigation were made. Conway subsequently opined in June 2009 that video lottery terminals would be legal if governed by the Kentucky Lottery Corporation and in January 2010 that instant racing would be allowable under the state's parimutuel betting statutes with a few regulatory changes.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Although {{most studies}} report high {{frequencies}} of consent to HIV tests, {{critics argue that}} clients are subject to pressure, that acceptors later indicate <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not have refused, and that provider-initiated HIV testing raises serious ethical issues. We examine the meaning of consent and why clients think <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not have refused. Methods: Clients in Burkina Faso, Kenya, Malawi and Uganda were asked about consenting to HIV tests, <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> thought <b>they</b> <b>could</b> have refused and why. Textual responses were analyzed using qualitative and statistical methods. Results: Among 926 respondents, 77 % reported <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not have said no, but in fact, 60 % actively consented to test, 24 % had no objection and only 7 % tested without consent. There were few significant associations between categories of consent and their covariates. Conclusions: Retrospectively asking clients if <b>they</b> <b>could</b> have refused to test for HIV overestimates coercion. Triangulating qualitative and quantitative data suggests a considerable degree of agency...|$|R
50|$|Shortly after Shoghi Effendi's death, the 27 then-living Hands of the Cause (Hands) deliberated over <b>whether</b> or not <b>they</b> <b>could</b> legitimately {{consent to}} any successor. Following these events Time Magazine {{reported}} that there were debates about two possible candidates for Guardian.|$|R
50|$|At graduation, Peter, Matt, Ivy, and Nadia wonder <b>whether</b> or not <b>they</b> <b>could</b> have {{prevented}} Jason's death {{and consider the}} role they played in it. The graduates all move forward into a world that will yield {{more questions than answers}} ("No Voice").|$|R
5|$|While {{portraying the}} bonds between {{the members of}} Class Zero, and between them and their summoned monsters, along with the game's themes of death and war, Naora drew {{inspiration}} from {{when he saw a}} cat killed by a car surrounded by other cats. Nomura was in charge of choosing the voice cast, which featured several well-known voice actors. When listening to the samples and picking the actors, Nomura focused on <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> successfully project the characters' personalities. The actors and actresses helped define the characters, adding individual touches during voice recording sessions. Sayoko Hoshino acted as the game's character texture artist. Originally, she was going to put in black voids where a female character's panties would have been due to hardware limitations. However the staff realized that the players would be looking at the backs of characters a lot, so Hoshino designed panties for each female character and worked with the staff to incorporate them into the character models.|$|E
25|$|When police {{knocked on}} Einem's door and enquired about <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> {{ask him a}} few questions, his {{immediate}} reaction was {{to say that he}} wouldn't answer anything without speaking to his lawyer first. This made police suspect that he had something to hide.|$|E
25|$|No duplex {{locomotives}} survive. Even today, {{their success}} and <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> {{have been made}} to work well given sufficient time and effort is a controversial subject. A common conclusion is that the conventional steam locomotive's problems were not as insoluble as Baldwin believed, and that the duplex arrangement introduced as many problems as it solved.|$|E
50|$|The first roster was {{established}} for the 2014 Global Games in Vancouver. No try-outs were held and players had to be chosen {{on the basis of}} <b>whether</b> or not <b>they</b> <b>could</b> afford the trip. The following players took part to this competition.|$|R
50|$|In {{his private}} practice, he was widely {{known for his}} {{altruism}} and his humanitarian behavior. He attended to all his patients with the same care and dedication, regardless of the social class to which <b>they</b> belonged, or <b>whether</b> or not <b>they</b> <b>could</b> afford to pay his fees.|$|R
50|$|Many of the {{settlers}} {{went home to}} get their families and households. Many had left their business hanging fire until <b>they</b> found out <b>whether</b> or not <b>they</b> <b>could</b> actually find a claim in the newly opened country. They had to sell out or close out their business and farms back home.|$|R
25|$|The {{experiences}} {{of patients who}} have experienced anesthesia awareness vary widely depending on why they became aware, whether they were paralyzed and patient responses and sequelae vary widely as well. It is unusual for someone having experienced awareness without pain or suffocation to suffer bad sequelae. The experience may be extremely traumatic for the patient {{or not at all}} depending on <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> breathe and what errors were made.|$|E
25|$|In February 1850 the Superintendent of Indian Affairs in New Mexico, James S. Calhoun, sent Auguste Lacome, a noted scout, trader, and mountaineer, and Encarnacion Garcia, also a trader, {{to inquire}} into their {{location}} and <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> be ransomed. Lacome met with Utes {{affiliated with the}} Jicarilla Apache and confirmed that the child had been killed shortly after {{the attack on the}} camp and her body thrown in a river. The servant was killed a short time later, being unable {{to keep up with the}} band.|$|E
25|$|The {{conclave}} {{began in}} the Vatican on 21 April, Easter Sunday. At the opening ceremonies, out of sixty living cardinals thirty-nine were in attendance. Three more arrived later, in time to cast a vote: Andreas of Austria, Ludovico Madruzzo of Trent, and Guido Luca Ferrero of Vercelli. Two factions quickly formed. The first was led by Cardinal Ferdinando de' Medici and the second by Luigi d'Este (grandson of King Louis XII of France). They were willing to combine to make a pope, but it depended on <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> agree on a common candidate.|$|E
50|$|There {{were also}} {{attempts}} by Babri Masjid supporters to prohibit all archaeological excavations at the disputed site. Naved Yar Khans petition at the Supreme Court to prohibit all archaeological excavations at the Mosque site was rejected. Similarly, there were questions raised {{as to what}} level the archaeological digging should reach — should they stop when evidence of a Hindu temple was found? Both Buddhists and Jains asked for the digging to continue much further to learn <b>whether</b> <b>they,</b> too, <b>could</b> lay claim to the site.|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} few years protest {{movements}} such as the Arab Spring and Occupy, have cascaded through much of the world. All of these were regularly portrayed as ’Internet Revolutions’ in the media, but among sociologists there is strong doubt about <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> actually <b>could</b> have been accelerated by the communicative capabilities of the Internet. In the research that will be presented Illustrative agent-based modeling shall be used to examine whether the Internet could have {{had anything to do with}} them, and if so, through what possible social mechanisms...|$|R
30|$|The {{participants}} were asked a range of questions pertaining to {{their perceptions of the}} event such as <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> learnt something new during the performance, the teaching effectiveness of the performer, whether the performance had an emotional impact on them, <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> thought it <b>could</b> change public/mental healthcare providers’/their own acceptance of BD and overall satisfaction with the event. The evaluation forms were similar for people with BD and BD healthcare providers.|$|R
25|$|As 1762 began, the Prussian armies had {{dwindled to}} only 60,000 men, {{and it was}} {{doubtful}} <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> prevent a renewed Russian and Austrian advance to Berlin. A total Prussian collapse seemed imminent; the British now threatened to withdraw their subsidies if Prussia did not offer concessions to secure peace, a threat that was made good later that year by the new British prime minister, Lord Bute. Then, on 5 January 1762 the ailing Russian Empress Elizabeth died; her nephew and successor, Tsar Peter III, was an ardent admirer of Frederick's, and he at once reversed Elizabeth's foreign policy and ordered a ceasefire with Prussia.|$|E
25|$|Willard was {{succeeded by}} his Lieutenant Governor Abram Hammond who {{fulfilled}} {{the final three}} months of his term. Willard's death had profound negative consequences for the state Democratic Party, who lost the election primarily because they were unable t field a new candidate very quickly, {{although it has been}} debated <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> have won. Although he helped keep the Democrats in control of the General Assembly going into the Civil War, things quickly feel apart for his party. As the primary enforcer of party unity, the duty fell to Jesse D. Bright, who was soon caught up in scandal. Many members of the party joined the Republicans and two decades would pass before his party would regain power.|$|E
25|$|After naming an {{unchanged}} line-up, England {{were immediately}} {{faced by the}} pairing of Glenn McGrath and Brett Lee. There were doubts about <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> play before the match started, because of the injuries they had sustained earlier, but they both passed fitness tests. Though Strauss succumbed in the tenth over, England lost no further wickets before lunch, and only one more before tea. There were many missed opportunities for Australia, who dropped Trescothick, Vaughan (twice) and Bell on the first day, which helped Trescothick and Vaughan to get a partnership of 137 before Trescothick was dismissed after lunch. Vaughan powered on, making his hundred after 206 minutes {{to become the first}} man in the series to get a century.|$|E
60|$|This was no easy {{question}} to answer. As {{if by magic}} darkness had settled all around them, shutting out the sight of objects {{less than a hundred}} yards away. To go forward was all but impossible, and <b>whether</b> or not <b>they</b> <b>could</b> get back to where they had come from was a serious problem.|$|R
50|$|In September 2007, the Bodmin and Wenford Railway {{announced}} plans to rebuild the North Cornwall Line from Bodmin Road (now known as , the nearest railway station to Padstow now) as far as Wadebridge, following {{the line of the}} Camel Trail. The plans have raised speculation as to <b>whether,</b> if realised, <b>they</b> <b>could</b> lead to a further connection to Padstow.|$|R
50|$|A Russian daily, Gazeta, {{reported}} {{that according to}} a poll conducted by the independent Levada Center, only 33 percent of Russians believe that Ramzan Kadyrov can be trusted, while 35 percent believed that he cannot. Asked <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> thought Kadyrov <b>could</b> normalise the situation in Chechnya and end the bloodshed there, 31 percent said yes and 38 percent said no.|$|R
25|$|In {{absence of}} these indulgences of the O’Donnell dynasty kings having {{maintained}} the MacDonlevy and MacNulty physicians as a dignified community, it is debatable <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> have so influenced {{the course of}} western medicine, educating and training Niall Ó Glacáin (L. Nellanus Glacanus) in the medical arts, so he could later on the Continent apply empirical method to pioneer the field of forensic anatomy and pathology, first describe the petechial haemorrhages of the lung and swelling of the spleen incident of bubonic plague (Tractatus de Peste, 1629), and early elucidate the empirical method of differential diagnosis for the continental European medical community, and producing the medieval physician and medical scholar Cormac MacDonlevy translator from Latin to vernacular of Bernard de Gordon's Lilium Medicine, Gaulteris Agilon's De dosibus and Gui de Chuliac's Chirurgia.|$|E
25|$|On 21 December 1920, Hassan died of {{influenza}} {{at the age}} of 64, his grave is believed to be somewhere close to Imi town of the Somali region of Ethiopia; however, the exact spot of the Sayid's grave is unknown. In mid 2009, the Somali Regional State administration announced that they would exhume his remains and rebury them in his old castle at Imi. Most of the people who knew the exact location of the Hassan's tomb were long dead, but the Regional Information Minister Guled Casowe told VOA Somali Section that a few, very old individuals might be left and {{they would be able to}} reveal the details of the Hassan's grave. Remains were found in a graveyard at Gindhir and the Somali Region of Ethiopia then tried to test the DNA to determine <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> be those of Sayid Mohammed Abdullah Hassan.|$|E
25|$|The City Commissioners, however, were undeterred {{in their}} desire to extend North Capitol Street. Although they knew federal law {{prohibited}} the use of cemetery land, on November 5, 1886, the commissioners claimed to have contacted the lotholders, {{a large majority of}} whom were said to favor the donation of cemetery land for the road. The commissioners had city legal counsel study <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> condemn the land and accept it as a donation (as Congress had appropriated no money for the city to pay for the property). The city's chief attorney, Albert G. Riddle, reported that federal law barred the city from condemning the property. The only alternatives were for every single lotholder to give their approval for a donation of land or for the city to ask Congress to revise the corporation's charter. With neither option likely to happen, Commissioners William B. Webb and Samuel E. Wheatley agreed to cancel the extension of North Capitol Street.|$|E
50|$|However, in {{a survey}} taken in 2013, some 40 percent of the town’s {{residents}} responded that they had decided never to return, and 43 percent were undecided. Concerns over radiation exposure, {{and the loss of}} compensation money from TEPCO should they decide to return, coupled with uncertainty over <b>whether</b> or not <b>they</b> <b>could</b> make a living in Tomioka were major issues.|$|R
50|$|Lee {{controlled}} all of {{the living}} conditions for the workers inside a highly secured compound. He controlled what the workers ate, <b>whether</b> or not <b>they</b> <b>could</b> leave the compound, with whom <b>they</b> <b>could</b> speak outside {{of the company and}} when they worked, hours for which they were often not compensated. If workers returned to the compound after the nightly curfew, they were abused by the guards. Complaining about the conditions resulted in punishment: lack of food, physical abuse, detainment or deportation.|$|R
40|$|This article investigates how {{girls were}} educated about sex, {{pregnancy}} and childbirth {{during the years}} 1930 to 1970. Based {{on the results of}} 92 oral-history interviews with Oxfordshire women, it explores how national debates surrounding sex education influenced what girls in Oxfordshire were taught. In addition, it examines how successful the women themselves thought this education had been in equipping them for maternity and <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> believed women <b>could</b> indeed be educated for motherhood. ...|$|R
