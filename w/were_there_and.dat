[...] Connelly remarked, [...] "it was a bit strange , but I think both Dave [...] and I got over that and just took it as a challenge to work with these puppets.

One of the students, Nathalie Provost, said, [...] "Look, we are just women studying engineering, not necessarily feminists ready to march on the streets to shout we are against men, just students intent on leading a normal life." [...] Lépine responded that [...] "You're women, you're going to be engineers. You're all a bunch of feminists. I hate feminists." [...] He then opened fire on the students from left to right, killing six, and wounding three others, including Provost. [...] Before leaving the room, he wrote the word shit twice on a student project.|$|E

For the latter role she was nominated for the Teen Choice Award for Choice Movie Scream Scene and the MTV Movie Award for Best Frightened Performance. She later revealed that she almost did not audition for the film due to her fear of dogs. [...] " [...] Michael Bay has these gigantic [...] [...] And, when I went to audition for The Amityville Horror, I went into his offices and literally these three huge dogs <b>were</b> <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> I almost turned around.

Faley has claimed that [...] "the album {{fell into place}} itself, like the songs basically told us where {{they wanted to go}} on the album". Late of the Pier picked the record's name at random after first contemplating using Peggy Patch and Her Sequenced Dress. The cover art was designed by a friend of the band members from Brighton, Jon Bergman. A final EP containing material already released in 2007 and 2008, Echoclistel Lambietroy, was released in July 2008 as part of the marketing campaign for the forthcoming album. Potter has summed the record's conception by concluding, [...] "I think in the three years to build up to the album, we never actually thought of a track list, and we never really kind of considered the fact that it should sound like an album. I think we recorded all the songs and then they <b>were</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> it was like, 'Oh, we have to kind of stitch this together and make it sound like one piece.'" ...|$|E

Ayers described the crowd's reaction as stunned disbelief: [...] "All the stars <b>were</b> <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> I heard serious comments, you know 'shit', 'Jesus', 'damn' and other words worse than that." [...] The successful performance earned Hendrix his first interview, published in Record Mirror with the headline: [...] "Mr. Phenomenon". [...] "Now hear this... we predict that [...] is going to whirl around the business like a tornado", wrote Bill Harry, who asked the rhetorical question: [...] "Is that full, big, swinging sound really being created by only three people?" [...] Hendrix commented: [...] "We don't want to be classed in any category... If it must have a tag, I'd {{like it to be}} called, 'Free Feeling'. It's a mixture of rock, freak-out, rave and blues". After appearances on the UK television shows Ready Steady Go! and the Top of the Pops, [...] "Hey Joe" [...] entered the UK charts on December 29, 1966, peaking at number six.

500|$|The {{deciding}} Game 7 of the 2015 Finals {{was scheduled}} to be played at 7:00 PM on April 30, 2015 at the WFCU Centre in Windsor, Ontario. The Express shootaround was set to take place before that of the Rainmen. The road team was supposed to arrive for warm-ups at approximately 1:00 PM, but entered the stadium approximately two hours earlier. Express assistant coach Gerry Brumpton recounted, [...] "They snuck in here before they even had the light on. We were here in the dark, I opened up the curtain and I looked in and there they were. They were still here working out. So they had been here for a while." [...] The Express told their opponents to leave the arena, but they refused, with one Rainmen player dunking a basketball instead. Windsor's Bill Jones then attempted to take a ball from Halifax center Liam McMorrow, but the player [...] "flinched," [...] pretending to throw a punch. According to Rainmen player Forrest Fisher, Jones tackled McMorrow to the ground and Express guard Tony Bennett followed up by hitting McMorrow with a chair. Referring to the Rainmen, Jones said, [...] "A couple of them kicked me and tried to take swings at me. And my players <b>were</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> they came to my rescue {{to be able to get}} me up." [...] Soon the violence escalated, with staff members and players from both teams involved. At around 10:40 AM, Windsor police received a phone call [...] "that between 15 to 20 men were involved in an altercation." [...] By the time they arrived at the WFCU Centre, however, the fighting was over and the Rainmen players had already reached their team bus.|$|E

[...] Hanna became convinced that McKinley was the only Ohioan who could gain the nomination, and by telegram hinted that Sherman should withdraw in the congressman's favor as the only Ohio Republican with a chance at the presidency. [...] Sherman, believing this to be his best chance for election, refused, a decision which Hanna accepted, fighting for Sherman to the end. [...] Hanna was greatly impressed by McKinley's loyal conduct in refusing to begin a run himself. [...] Foraker threw his support to Blaine, though he returned to Sherman when the New Englander did not run. [...] In the end, the nomination fell to former Indiana senator Benjamin Harrison. Hanna never forgave {{what he saw as}} Foraker's treason. [...] After 1888, there was a strong dislike between the two men, and the separation split the Ohio Republican Party into two factions, a rupture that did not heal until after Hanna's death in 1904. [...] Foraker stated in his memoirs that the break occurred because Hanna bribed black delegates from the South in 1888. [...] However, Ohio newspaper publisher J. B. Morrow contradicted Foraker's account, stating: [...] "I was at the convention in 1888 and know Senator Foraker [...] brought great scandal to the Ohio people who <b>were</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> to the delegates with his secret work with Mr. Blaine's friends... Mr. Hanna became thoroughly angered at what he thought was Senator Foraker's bad faith." [...] According to Horner, Foraker was the more embittered of the two as the years passed, feeling that {{if it had not been}} for that dispute, Foraker, not McKinley, might have become president.|$|E
