25|$|Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega sent {{a message}} to Trump saluting his electoral triumph on behalf of the Nicaraguan people and the {{government}} saying: <b>We</b> <b>join</b> those who believe {{that it is possible to}} work with the United States to contribute to a world that privileges dialogue and understanding to attend the serious problems that affect humanity prioritizing peace. From our dignified and free Nicaragua which works in Christianity, Socialism and Solidarity, I greet you, your family and your people.|$|E

500|$|Finding the Persian fleet {{gone from}} Samos, the Allies were thrown into uncertainty. Eventually they {{resolved}} {{that they would}} sail to the mainland, and equipped themselves for a naval battle. However, when the Allies approached Mycale, the Persians {{did not attempt to}} engage them, and remained guarding their camp. Leotychides therefore sailed as close to the camp as possible, and had a herald make an appeal to the Ionians: [...] "Men of Ionia, you who hear us, understand what I say, for by no means will the Persians understand anything I charge you with when <b>we</b> <b>join</b> battle; first of all it is right for each man to remember his freedom and next the battle-cry Hebe: and let him who hears me tell him who has not heard it." [...] Herodotus suggests that the purpose of this message was twofold; firstly to encourage the Ionians, unbeknownst to the Persians, to fight for the Allies (or at least not to fight against them); or, if the message became known to the Persians, to make the Persians mistrust the Ionians.|$|E

2500|$|... 23. We {{are fully}} aware of the {{difficulties}} confronting the public authorities in this matter, especially in the developing countries. In fact, We had in mind the justifiable anxieties which weigh upon them when We published Our encyclical letter Populorum Progressio. But now <b>We</b> <b>join</b> Our voice to that of Our predecessor John XXIII of venerable memory, and We make Our own his words: [...] "No statement of the problem and no solution to it is acceptable which does violence to man's essential dignity; those who propose such solutions base them on an utterly materialistic conception of man himself and his life. The only possible solution to this question is one which envisages the social and economic progress both of individuals and of the whole of human society, and which respects and promotes true human values." [...] No one can, without being grossly unfair, make divine Providence responsible for what clearly seems {{to be the result of}} misguided governmental policies, of an insufficient sense of social justice, of a selfish accumulation of material goods, and finally of a culpable failure to undertake those initiatives and responsibilities which would raise the standard of living of peoples and their children.|$|E

2500|$|Rather than {{arguing for}} an {{all-inclusive}} public sphere, or {{the analysis of}} tension between public spheres, he suggested that publics were formed by active members of society around issues. They are a group of interested individuals who engage in vernacular discourse about a specific issue. [...] "Publics may be repressed, distorted, or responsible, but any evaluation of their actual state requires that we inspect the rhetorical environment {{as well as the}} rhetorical act out of which they evolved, for these are the conditions that constitute their individual character". These people formed rhetorical public spheres that were based in discourse, not necessarily orderly discourse but any interactions whereby the interested public engages each other. This interaction can take the form of institutional actors as well as the basic [...] "street rhetoric" [...] that [...] "open a dialogue between competing factions." [...] The spheres themselves formed around the issues that were being deliberated. The discussion itself would reproduce itself across the spectrum of interested publics [...] "even though we lack personal acquaintance with all but a few of its participants and are seldom in contexts where we and they directly interact, <b>we</b> <b>join</b> these exchanges because they are discussing the same matters". In order to communicate within the public sphere, [...] "those who enter any given arena must share a reference world for their discourse to produce awareness for shared interests and public opinions about them". This world consists of common meanings and cultural norms from which interaction can take place.|$|E
2500|$|She {{supported}} {{the concept that}} abortion is a woman's choice, that it shouldn't be a crime or exclusively a doctor's choice or anyone else involved, and helped form NARAL (now NARAL Pro-Choice America) {{at a time when}} Planned Parenthood wasn't yet supportive. Alleged death threats against her speaking on abortion led to the cancellation of two events, although subsequently one of the host institutions, Loyola College, invited her back to speak on abortion and other homosexual rights issues and she did so. Her draft of NOW's first statement of purpose included an abortion plank, but NOW didn't include it until the next year. In 1980, she believed abortion should be in the context of [...] "'the choice to have children'", a formulation supported by the Roman Catholic priest organizing Catholic participation in the White House Conference on Families for that year, though perhaps not by the bishops above him. A resolution embodying the formulation passed at the conference by 460 to 114, whereas a resolution addressing abortion, ERA and [...] "sexual preference" [...] passed by only 292–291 and that only after 50 opponents of abortion had walked out and so hadn't voted on it. She disagreed with a resolution that framed abortion in more feminist terms that was introduced in the Minneapolis regional conference resulting from the same White House Conference on Families, believing it to be more polarizing, while the drafters apparently thought Friedan's formulation too conservative. As of 2000, she wrote, referring to [...] "NOW and the other women's organizations" [...] as seeming to be in a [...] "time warp", [...] "to my mind, there is far too much focus on abortion.... n recent years I've gotten a little uneasy about the movement's narrow focus on abortion {{as if it were the}} single, all-important issue for women when it's not". She asked, [...] "Why don't <b>we</b> <b>join</b> forces with all who have true reverence for life, including Catholics who oppose abortion, and fight for the choice to have children?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Many {{wanted to}} marry her but she refused all stating, 'I will go to Kham and there lives a great yogi who is descended from the noble clan of the Kyura race. This yogi I will marry and our sons and daughters and future generations will be {{extraordinary}} persons who will benefit all sentient beings by spreading {{the essence of the}} Buddha's teachings.' Then accompanying a merchant, she traveled to Kham. [...] They arrived at a place called Dentod Tsonrur and she said to her companion, 'This is the place I have to stay.' She departed and went to meet the great saint Ame Tsultrim Gyatso to whom she said, 'Although I have no attachment to the worldly life, if <b>we</b> <b>join</b> together our descendants will bear many enlightened beings who will do great benefit for the teachings of the Buddha.' [...] On their marriage day, Ame Tsultrim Gyatso did not have any possessions to arrange for the ceremony. Drolma said, 'Do not worry, I will take care of it.' So saying she miraculously pulled a damaru from her right pocket and a kapala from her left. Then beating the damaru and holding the kapala in her hand she made a mystic dance while gazing into the sky. [...] Immediately the house was filled with the finest food and drink and the richest garments with which to clothe themselves - thus giving great satisfaction and pleasure to all the guests. [...] They lived together and in time she gave birth to four sons: Namkhe Wangchuk, Pekar Wangyal, Sonam Pal and Kathung Trushi. These sons were exceptionally intelligent and became scholars on both the temporal and spiritual levels. [...] Of her four sons, Pekar Wangyal fathered four sons. They were Khenpo Dharma, Konchog Rinchen, Tsunpo Bar and Naljor Dorje - of these four, Naljor Dorje became the father of the great Ratnashri Jigten Sumgon, the great Drikungpa, who was the reincarnation of Nagarjuna.|$|E
