The legs are short and stubby and end in large webbed feet tipped <b>with</b> <b>sharp</b> claws. Well suited for an aquatic life, it can close its ears and nose while underwater.|$|E

Sharp denied paternity, and public opinion favored him. The disgraced Cooke became a recluse at her mother's plantation outside Bowling Green.|$|E
