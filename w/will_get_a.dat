5|$|We played Birmingham City in {{pre-season}} {{and he got}} {{a lovely}} ovation from their supporters and it was the same at Yeovil last year. He got a lovely clap at Northampton a few weeks ago when he was taken off. I don't think that happened by coincidence. And I've got a feeling that if he leaves Cheltenham he <b>will</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> similar reception if he comes back with another club. Supporters recognise him and they see the whole-heartedness and the commitment and the ability that he has got.|$|E
5|$|Santosh meets Rajeshwari and apologises to her. He {{also makes}} her {{understand}} his situation. Rajeshwari convinces Ramamoorthy that she <b>will</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> better groom than Santosh. Meanwhile, Subramaniam goes to meet Hasini and apologises to her. Hasini {{says that her}} father is angry on her for lying and {{she will have to}} obey her father now. But Govindan does not like Santosh as he has seen him before drinking with his friends in road. Subramaniam says that he will send Santosh to Govindan’s home for a week so that he will better understand his character. After numerous incidents between Govindan and Santosh, the former finally agrees for Santosh and Hasini's wedding.|$|E
5|$|Frustrated that Gee {{refuses to}} {{consider}} the possibility of a police shooting, Pembleton assures him he <b>will</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> confession out of Staley, whether he did it or not. Pembleton starts the interrogation calm and polite, but gradually becomes angrier, frightening Staley. Pembleton makes him feel responsible for allowing Cox to be at the crackhouse, and uses that guilt to break Staley down and confess, even though he is obviously innocent. Pembleton gives the confession to Gee, who is conflicted, especially when Pembleton compares it to past police practices of white detectives getting confessions from black suspects no matter what the cost. Ultimately, Gee tears up the confession and instead visits Staley at jail. Staley admits to Gee that Lt. Jimmy Tyron (Michael S. Kennedy) shot Cox in the back without warning while Cox was running away. Pembleton and Bayliss arrest Tyron at his home, where they confiscate a gun and bullets that appear to match those used against Cox. The arrest deeply saddens Howard, who had previously had an affair with Tyron. The affair ended because Tyron was married with children, but Howard continues to harbor romantic feelings for him.|$|E

5|$|Grand Prix – This mode has {{the player}} race against 7 (or 6) teams, which are {{controlled}} by the computer, {{in a series of}} predetermined courses. The player can choose to race using 3 different engine size classes: 50cc, 100cc and 150cc. A fourth unlockable class, Mirror Mode, allows the player to race through a mirrored version of the tracks using the 150cc engine size. Since all karts go faster when using higher engine sizes, the 4 classes serve as difficulty levels. There are 16 tracks, divided into 4 cups: Mushroom, Flower, Star and Special. A 5th cup has the player race in every track called the All-Cup Tour. The tour always starts with Luigi Circuit and ends with Rainbow Road, but the remaining tracks show up in random order. Every race is three laps long except for Baby Park and Wario Colosseum, which have 7 and 2, respectively. After all the human players cross the finish line, the positions of the computer-controlled teams are immediately locked in and they are given points based on those eight positions, ranging from 0 to 10. At the end of the cup, there will be an award ceremony for the 3 teams, where they <b>will</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> trophy ranging from bronze to gold. No matter which position they earned after each race, everyone will move on because of these new rules.|$|E
5|$|Keith {{questions}} Veronica {{about whether}} or not she broke into the house, despite knowing her guilt. Jake and a county prosecutor tell Keith that they <b>will</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> judge's order and will return to prosecute Veronica. The supercomputer processes the names of all the Castle members just as Keith hands over the surveillance tape to the county prosecutor. Logan tries to apologize to Veronica. One of the Castle members comes up and tells her that the organization videotaped her, and Logan assaults him. Veronica returns the tape to Jake Kane on the condition that he does not tell Keith about it. She sees in the newspaper that charges have been filed against Keith for tampering with evidence relating to Veronica's break-in, likely meaning that he will lose the votes needed to win the sheriff's election. She goes into a voting booth and votes for Keith as sheriff, walking away in pouring rain.|$|E
5|$|On September 17, 2013, the {{government}} announced that a four-year tentative agreement had been reached with the Newfoundland and Labrador Association of Public and Private Employees (NAPE), the province's largest public sector union. The deal between the two was reached after 18 months of negotiations, during at which point NAPE released radio and television advertisements criticizing {{the government}} for saying the province's economy was booming while they laid off employees and told unions to expect a modest increase in pay. The tentative deal included a wage freeze {{during the first two}} years of the deal, a two per cent increase in pay during year three and a three per cent wage increase in year four. Full-time employees will also receive a $1,400 signing bonus, while temporary, seasonal and part-time workers <b>will</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> pro-rated bonus. As well a new job evaluation system would see significant monetary benefits for some employees. Two weeks after reaching an agreement with NAPE, {{the government announced}} tentative agreements with the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) and the Association of Allied Health Professionals (AAHP). Both agreements had a similar structure as the one government reached with NAPE.|$|E

5|$|Brian and Stewie {{visit the}} local Quahog bank so that Brian can deposit holiday {{money in his}} safe deposit box. Stewie then {{wants to go to}} a store to return a $3,000 Thom Browne sweater. While they are still inside the vault, the door closes {{at the end of the}} work day and locks them inside until the next morning. Frightened, Stewie soils his diaper. Worried he <b>will</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> rash from the dirty diaper, Stewie desperately tries to make Brian eat his feces by {{threatening}} him with a gun that Brian had stored in his deposit box. They discover that Stewie has a cellphone in his pocket, but there's only enough charge in the battery for one short phone call. Unfortunately, Stewie uses the last of the phone's battery charge to call the clothing store rather than for help. Enraged, Brian hits Stewie, throws his phone on the ground (thus breaking the phone), and yells at Stewie, making him cry. Instantly remorseful and wanting to repair his relationship with Stewie, Brian reluctantly agrees to eat Stewie's feces in order to provide him with a clean diaper and make up for making Stewie cry. While watching Brian eating, Stewie becomes nauseated and throws up; Stewie then convinces Brian to eat his puke, correctly pointing out that Brian likes the taste of vomit. Realizing that he has nothing to clean his bottom with, Stewie manages to convince Brian to clean his bottom with his tongue in order to avoid infection, much to Stewie's pleasure. Afterward, they both decide to take a nap, but soon they realize that the next day is Sunday, meaning that they will have to wait another day before they can be released from the vault.|$|E

2500|$|We {{are taking}} a sum of finitely many {{function}} values of , multiplied with the differences of two subsequent approximation points. We can easily see that the approximation is still too large. Using more steps produces a closer approximation, but will always be too high and will never be exact. Alternatively, replacing these subintervals by ones with the left end height of each piece, we <b>will</b> <b>get</b> <b>an</b> approximation that is too low: for example, with twelve such subintervals we <b>will</b> <b>get</b> <b>an</b> approximate value for the area of 0.6203.|$|R
