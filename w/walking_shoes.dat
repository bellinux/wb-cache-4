She made up a small bundle of clothes, took her purse, which was well filled with guineas and silver, and moved softly to the door. Hide and seek had taught her all the modes of eluding observation, and with her <b>walking</b> <b>shoes</b> in her hand, and her feet slippered, she noiselessly crept through one empty room after another, and descended the stair into her own lobby, where she knew how to open the sash door.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Kinesiology, 2013 Embargoed for {{two years}} from date added to Humboldt Digital Scholar (2013 - 05 - 21). Released from embargo May 22, 2015. An ever-growing {{population}} of {{people are looking for}} ways to increase calorie burn without increasing activity levels. People in the shoe industry have capitalized on this concept and created curved bottom shoes. Curved bottom shoes are believed to provide the body with an unstable walking surface, initiating greater muscle activity patterns to stabilize the body, ultimately resulting in an increase in the metabolic cost of <b>walking</b> in curved <b>shoes.</b> The metabolic cost of walking is also determined in part by the exchange of mechanical energy and the cost of swinging the legs. However, it is unclear how <b>walking</b> in curved <b>shoes</b> may affect the pendulum like exchange of mechanical energy in the body and the cost of leg swing. This study investigated the effects of curved bottom shoes on the energetics and mechanics of walking. Sixteen subjects came to the Humboldt State Biomechanics Lab for two testing sessions. They walked on a treadmill and overground at three different speeds (0. 75, 1. 25, 1. 75 m/s) and in three different shoes (flat shoes (FS), curved shoes (CS), and flat shoes weighted to match the weight of curved shoes (WFS)). The metabolic cost of walking was greater in curved bottom shoes compared to the flat shoes (p=. 0001) but similar to weighted flat shoes (p=. 386). However, inverted pendulum energy exchange was greater in curved shoes when compared to both flat shoes (p<. 0001) and weighted flat shoes (p=. 001). In conclusion, <b>walking</b> in curved <b>shoes</b> allows for a greater exchange of mechanical energy via inverted pendulum mechanics but increases the metabolic cost as compared to <b>walking</b> in flat <b>shoes</b> likely as a result of an increased cost of leg swing...|$|R
40|$|Foot {{orientation}} can {{be assessed}} in realtime {{by means of a}} foot-mounted inertial sensor. We consider a method that uses only accelerometer and gyroscope readings to calculate the foot pitch and roll angle, i. e. the foot orientation angle in the sagittal and frontal plane, respectively. Since magnetometers are avoided completely, the method can be used indoors {{as well as in the}} proximity of ferromagnetic material and magnetic disturbances. Furthermore, we allow for almost arbitrary mounting orientation in the sense that we only assume one of the local IMU coordinate axes to lie in the sagittal plane of the foot. The method is validated with respect to a conventional optical motion capture system in trials with transfemoral amputees <b>walking</b> with <b>shoes</b> and healthy subjects walking barefoot, both at different velocities. Root mean square deviations of less than 4 ° are found in all scenarios, while values near 2 ° are found in slow <b>shoe</b> <b>walking.</b> This demonstrates that the proposed method is suitable for realtime application such as the control of FES-based gait neuroprostheses and active orthoses...|$|R

50|$|By {{changing}} the material hardness of the midsole, {{one will be}} able to change the EMG activity in various lower extremity muscles such as rectus femoris, biceps femoris, medial gastrocnemius, and tibialis anterior.

40|$|Abstract Background It {{is known}} that when barefoot, gait {{biomechanics}} of diabetic neuropathic patients differ from non-diabetic individuals. However, it is still unknown whether these biomechanical changes are also present during shod gait which is clinically advised for these patients. This study investigated {{the effect of the}} participants own shoes on gait biomechanics in diabetic neuropathic individuals compared to barefoot gait patterns and healthy controls. Methods Ground reaction forces and lower limb EMG activities were analyzed in 21 non-diabetic adults (50. 9 ± 7. 3 yr, 24. 3 ± 2. 6 kg/m 2) and 24 diabetic neuropathic participants (55. 2 ± 7. 9 yr, 27. 0 ± 4. 4 kg/m 2). EMG patterns of vastus lateralis, lateral gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior, along with the vertical and antero-posterior ground reaction forces were studied during shod and barefoot gait. Results Regardless of the disease, <b>walking</b> with <b>shoes</b> promoted an increase in the first peak vertical force and the peak horizontal propulsive force. Diabetic individuals had a delay in the lateral gastrocnemius EMG activity with no delay in the vastus lateralis. They also demonstrated a higher peak horizontal braking force <b>walking</b> with <b>shoes</b> compared to barefoot. Diabetic participants also had a smaller second peak vertical force in shod gait and a delay in the vastus lateralis EMG activity in barefoot gait compared to controls. Conclusions The change in plantar sensory information that occurs when wearing shoes revealed a different motor strategy in diabetic individuals. Walking with shoes did not attenuate vertical forces in either group. Though changes in motor strategy were apparent, the biomechanical did not support the argument that the use of shoes contributes to altered motor responses during gait. </p...|$|R
