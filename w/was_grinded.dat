[...] "Gird on thy sword!" [...] exclaimed the preacher emphatically; [...] "and was not that a pretty bit of steel as ever dangled from a corslet, or rung against a steel saddle? Ay, ye prick up your ears now, ye cutlers of Woodstock, as if ye should know something of a good fox broad sword--Did you forge it, I trow?--was the steel quenched with water from Rosamond's well, or the blade blessed by the old cuckoldy priest of Godstow? You would have us think, I warrant me, that you wrought it and welded it, grinded and polished it, and all the while it never came on a Woodstock stithy! You were all too busy making whittles for the lazy crape-men of Oxford, bouncing priests, whose eyes were so closed up with fat, that they could not see Destruction till she had them by the throat. But I can tell you where the sword was forged, and tempered, and welded, and grinded, and polished. When you were, as I said before, making whittles for false priests, and daggers for dissolute G--d d--n-me cavaliers, to cut the people of England's throats with--it was forged at Long Marston Moor, where blows went faster than ever rung hammer on anvil--and it was tempered at Naseby, in the best blood of the cavaliers--and it was welded in Ireland against the walls of Drogheda--and it <b>was</b> <b>grinded</b> on Scottish lives at Dunbar--and now of late it was polished in Worcester, till it shines as bright as the sun in the middle heaven, and there is no light in England that shall come nigh unto it." ...|$|E
