50|$|The {{magnitude}} of the RPR is inversely related to the annual rate of production, which may depend on geological features. For example, a highly fractured oil reserve with <b>water</b> <b>drive</b> may have a RPR as low as 6 years. By contrast, a low permeability oil reserve may have a RPR as high as 50 or 100 years. Government policies may deliberately slow production, thereby increasing the RPR {{in the interests of}} prolonging reserve life, whereas a company may inject water and/or gases into a reservoir to increase production, thereby decreasing the RPR—the increased production comes at the expense of decreased reserve life. The RPR depends signiﬁcantly on the stage of resource development. Typically, there is a high initial RPR during the early phases of development, then the RPR sharply declines toward the maximum level of production. Following to the production decline, the {{magnitude of}} the P/R ratio can either continue to decline, remain stable for some period of time, or increase, especially when a production slump occurs.|$|E

Comparison of prediction with new <b>water</b> <b>drive</b> curve, conventional one, and methods in references 27 and 28 was done with numerical simulation and field application in two oilfields, which showed that the new <b>water</b> <b>drive</b> curve could fit the development data both at the high water cut and at the ultra-high water cut stage and characterize the upwarping trend at ultra-high water cut stage. The new <b>water</b> <b>drive</b> curve at ultra-high water cut predicts the water-flooded recoverable reserve and water cut more accurately than other <b>water</b> <b>drive</b> curves and has better adaptability.|$|E
30|$|As a {{reservoir}} engineering method for prediction of development index and recoverable reserve, and dynamic {{analysis in the}} water-flooded reservoir, the <b>water</b> <b>drive</b> curves play {{important role in the}} oilfield development (Chen and Li 2001; Bondar and Blasingame 2002). Since Maкcимoв (1959) from the former Soviet Union firstly put forward the <b>water</b> <b>drive</b> curve in 1959, a lot of effort has been done worldwide in the research on the <b>water</b> <b>drive</b> curve, e.g. Haзapoв (1972) proposed type D <b>water</b> <b>drive</b> curve in 1972, Tong (1978) introduced the <b>water</b> <b>drive</b> curve proposed by Maкcимoв to China and named it as type A <b>water</b> <b>drive</b> curve in 1978, Caзoнoв (1973) and Tong (1981) conducted research on type B <b>water</b> <b>drive</b> curve and popularized it in the oilfield development, and Cилaчeв (1981) and Haзapoв (1982) proposed type C <b>water</b> <b>drive</b> curve. The researchers in China introduced the curves and conducted the theoretical extension and field application (Tong 1989). Chen (1985, 1993, 1994, 1995, 2000) and Yu and Jin (1995), Yu (1999 a, 2000) completed theoretical derivation of formulas for type A, B, C, D, and other <b>water</b> <b>drive</b> curves based on oil–water flow in the porous medium. Zhang (1998) completed derivation of <b>water</b> <b>drive</b> curve that is applied widely in the oilfields. Gao and Xu (2007) also conducted theoretical research based on the ratio of oil and water flow in the porous medium. After decades of development, there are more than 50 types of <b>water</b> <b>drive</b> curves (Yu 2000), among which the conventional <b>water</b> <b>drive</b> curves, i.e. type A, B, C, and D ones, are most used in the oilfield development and chosen as four methods in the standard of China’s oil and gas industry (Yu et al. 1999 b). The above four methods were derived theoretically based on the rule of flow in the semi-log linear relation between the ratio of oil and water relative permeability and the water saturation in the oil–water relative permeability curves (Chen 2002; Can and Kabir 2014). Field application showed that the linear relation is applicable in the oilfields at medium–high water cut stage. For the oilfields at ultra-high water cut stage, the rule of fluid flow in the formation has been changed fundamentally, and the ratio of oil and water permeability and the water saturation deviate from the linear relationship in the semi-log curve, showing the downwarping trend with nonlinear relation. Correspondingly, the conventional <b>water</b> <b>drive</b> curves are upwarping at ultra-high water cut stage without linear relationship. Thus, the conventional <b>water</b> <b>drive</b> curves are not applicable in the oilfields at ultra-high water cut stage (Chen and Tao 1997). The conventional <b>water</b> <b>drive</b> curves would result in higher recoverable reserve and recovery, creating the big error. Currently, there are few reports about the new formula of the relation between the ratio of oil and water permeability and the water saturation in oilfields at ultra-high water cut stage. Only Liu et al. (2011), Wang et al. (2013), Song et al. (2013), and Cui et al. (2015) in China proposed the exponential and binomial equations for the relation between the ratio of oil and water permeability and the water saturation, completed derivation of exponential, binomial, and inverse-proportion <b>water</b> <b>drive</b> curves, which have some limitations in prediction accuracy. Thus, it needs more effort to work out the <b>water</b> <b>drive</b> curve for the oilfields at ultra-high water cut stage. This paper aims at establishing the new formula of the relation between the ratio of oil and water permeability and the water saturation, based on which the new <b>water</b> <b>drive</b> curve is obtained. The numerical and field application confirmed the applicability of the new <b>water</b> <b>drive</b> curve in prediction of development index, recoverable reserve, and recovery, which is of significance to improvement of evaluation methods of oilfields at ultra-high water cut stage.|$|E

30|$|For the oilfields at ultra-high {{water cut}} stage, {{the curves of}} ln(K ro/K rw) and S w show the downwarping trend and {{transform}} from II linear relationship to III nonlinear relationship, and the <b>water</b> <b>drive</b> curves show the upwarping trend. The main reason is that as the water saturation increases, the oil of continuous phase in the formation transforms to partially continuous phase and non-continuous phase, causing the stronger Jamin effect, substantial reduction in oil permeability, and increment of water permeability, and thus resulting in the downwarping curve of ln(K ro/K rw) and S w which has the intrinsic rule consistent with conventional <b>water</b> <b>drive</b> curves showing upwarping trend at ultra-high water cut stage. Application of the conventional <b>water</b> <b>drive</b> curves in analysis of development dynamics of the oilfields at ultra-high water cut stage would result in big error of water cut and higher predicted recoverable reserves. Thus, the formula of ln(K ro/K rw) and S w characterizing oil and water flow in the oilfields at ultra-high water cut stage is needed to derive the new <b>water</b> <b>drive</b> curve, which is of significance to improvement of the evaluation methods of water-flooded reservoir at ultra-high water cut stage.|$|E

30|$|Active edge water gas {{reservoir}} accounts for approximately 20 – 35 % of <b>water</b> <b>drive</b> {{gas reservoir}}s {{and most of}} the gas reservoirs of China are at different degrees of <b>water</b> <b>drive</b> gas reservoirs.

During the development of high-sulfur gas reservoirs at <b>water</b> <b>drive</b> gas, the water body flows to the gas reservoir, forming a gas–water two-phase seepage with decreasing pressure. This results in a decrease in gas well recovery rate (Wang et al. 2011; Zeng et al. 2013; Li 2014; Liu et al. 2015; Yu et al. 2016).
