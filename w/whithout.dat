40|$|In this paper, {{motivated}} by the experimental evidence of rapidly rotating $C_{ 60 }$ molecules in fullerite, we study the low-energy electronic states of rotating fullerene within a continuum model. In this model, the low-energy spectrum is obtained from an effective Dirac equation including non-Abelian gauge fields that simulate the pentagonal rings of the molecule. Rotation is incorporated into the model by solving the effective Dirac equation in the rotating referential frame. The exact analytical solution for the eigenfunctions and energy spectrum is obtained, yielding the previously known static results in the no rotation limit. Due to the coupling between rotation and total angular momentum, that appears naturally in the rotating frame, the zero modes of static $C_{ 60 }$ are shifted and also suffer a Zeeman splitting <b>whithout</b> {{the presence of a}} magnetic field...|$|E
