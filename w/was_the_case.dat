5|$|According to some scholars, the Black Stone was {{the same}} stone that Islamic {{tradition}} describes as greeting Muhammad before his prophethood. This led to a debate about whether the Black Stone's greeting comprised actual speech or merely a sound, and following that, whether the stone was a living creature or an inanimate object. Whichever <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> the stone was held to be a symbol of prophethood.|$|E
50|$|Subjunctive conditionals are {{familiar}} from ordinary language. They <b>are</b> of <b>the</b> form, if A <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> then B would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> or if A had <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> then B would have <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>case.</b> Counterfactual conditionals <b>are</b> specifically subjunctive conditionals whose antecedents {{are in fact}} false, hence the name. However the term used technically may apply to conditionals with true antecedents as well.|$|R

5|$|After Pather Panchali, Ray {{went on to}} make 36 more films, {{including}} feature films, documentaries and shorts. He {{worked on}} scripting, casting, scoring, cinematography, art direction and editing, as well as designing his own credit titles and publicity material. He developed a distinctive style of film-making based, as <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> with Pather Panchali, on visual lyricism and strongly humanistic themes. Thus, Ray established himself as an internationally recognized auteur of cinema.|$|E
5|$|As <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> {{with almost}} all German capital ships during World War I, Moltkes action was {{somewhat}} limited.

At the start of the war, the ship was assigned to the I Scouting Group of the High Seas Fleet, under the command of Rear Admiral Franz Hipper.|$|E
5|$|As <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> {{with his}} grandfather, Sultan Ibrahim, Sultan Iskandar's {{independent}} mindset resulted in strained {{relations with the}} Malaysian federal government on numerous occasions. This was more so during his days as the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, whereby a number of notable public incidents involved Sultan Iskandar. Nevertheless, Sultan Iskandar was reputed to show great concern to his subjects, and was held in high esteem by many of his subjects–particularly the Malays and Orang Aslis.|$|E
5000|$|The {{acquaintance}} theorist {{can argue}} that one has a noninferentially justified belief [...] "that P" [...] only when one has the thought [...] "that P" [...] and one is acquainted with both the fact that P <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> <b>the</b> thought [...] "that P", and the relation of correspondence holding between the thought [...] "that P" [...] {{and the fact that}} P <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case.</b> So I must not only know the proposition P, and the fact that P <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> but also know that the fact that P <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>is</b> what makes proposition P true.|$|R

5|$|As <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> {{with many}} of his contemporaries, Miller's {{sporting}} career was interrupted by World War II.

5|$|As <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> {{with most}} of his works, Etty did not give the {{painting}} a title. It was initially exhibited as A Composition, taken from the Eleventh Book of Milton's Paradise Lost, and was referred to by Etty himself as The Bevy of Fair Women and The Origin of Marriage. By 1862, when it was shown at the International Exhibition, it had acquired its present title.|$|E
5|$|For {{the purpose}} of {{reproduction}} most amphibians require fresh water although some lay their eggs on land and have developed various means of keeping them moist. A few (e.g. Fejervarya raja) can inhabit brackish water, {{but there are no}} true marine amphibians.

Such <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> with the Black Sea invasion of the natural hybrid Pelophylax esculentus reported in 2010.|$|E

5|$|In 2013, Fey starred {{alongside}} Paul Rudd in {{the romantic}} comedy-drama film Admission, {{based on the}} Jean Hanff Korelitz novel by the same name. The film was directed by Paul Weitz. Fey later starred in the 2014 comedy-drama This Is Where I Leave You, helmed by Date Night director Shawn Levy. As <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> with Baby Mama, although both of these films received generally mixed reviews, Fey's performances were well received by film critics.|$|E

The settlements, which included massive post construction houses even over 50 meters long as well as industrial facilities, extended continuously over a stretch of land more than three kilometers long. Some of the identified structures functioned together, as <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> when the buildings were connected by a courtyard and protected by a common fence.|$|E
5|$|Music {{was also}} {{appreciated}} in Macedonia. In {{addition to the}} agora, the gymnasium, the theatre, and religious sanctuaries and temples dedicated to Greek gods and goddesses, {{one of the main}} markers of a true Greek city in the empire of Alexander the Great was the presence of an odeon for musical performances. This <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> not only for Alexandria in Egypt, but also cities as distant as Ai-Khanoum in what is now modern-day Afghanistan.|$|E
5|$|Originally to air on CBS with a {{start time}} of 2:30p.m. CST, CBS reassigned the game for primetime {{television}} at 7:00p.m. CST {{as part of a}} trade announced October 23.

5|$|The Mafia of Villalba was of {{relatively}} recent origin, {{as it did}} {{not go back to}} the 1860s, considered to be the period when the Mafia emerged around Palermo.

5|$|The first sponsor {{to appear}} on Malmö FF's jerseys was local {{shipyard}} company Kockums in 1976, and since 1981 at least one sponsor logo has appeared on the club's kits.
