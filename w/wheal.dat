The mines continue up throughout the hills from Glen Osmond. While <b>Wheal</b> Gawler and <b>Wheal</b> Watkins are former open-cut mines (located in Glen Osmond), Mount Osmond contains more mineshafts which are up to sixty metres deep.|$|E
5|$|<b>Wheal</b> Eliza Mine on the River Barle near Simonsbath was an {{unsuccessful}} copper and iron mine.|$|E
5|$|In {{the mid-19th}} century a mine was {{developed}} alongside the River Barle. The mine was originally called <b>Wheal</b> Maria, then changed to <b>Wheal</b> Eliza. It was a copper mine from 1845â€“54 and then an iron mine until 1857, although the first mining activity on the site may be from 1552. At Simonsbath, a restored Victorian water-powered sawmill, which was damaged in the floods of 1992, has now been purchased by the National Park and returned to working order; it is now {{used to make the}} footpath signs, gates, stiles and bridges for various sites in the park.|$|E

5|$|When Adelaide {{was first}} planned and mapped out by Col. William Light, Mount Osmond {{received}} the three allotments 1070, 1277 and 1278. While much of Adelaide was relatively quickly bought (but not necessarily settled) Mount Osmond {{did not enjoy}} any early buyers. The first reported activity in the area was after the mining rush of Glen Osmond due to the <b>Wheal</b> Watkins and <b>Wheal</b> Gawler mines. Lot 1277 yielded a mine in Slaughterhouse Gully but it was worked only briefly. Subsequent finds of bluestone proved fruitful and the mineral was extracted until 1900, when mining ended and {{the last of the}} mines were either filled in or cordoned off.|$|E
5|$|The path now turns south again, {{passing the}} village of Perranuthnoe (or Perran) and Perran Sands, then {{skirting}} inland across the neck of Cudden Point to Prussia Cove and Bessy's Cove. A larger sandy beach is Praa Sands after which the path climbs up onto a series of cliff tops such as Trewavas Head. This area shows many signs of Cornwall's mining history with abandoned engine houses such as <b>Wheal</b> Prosper close to the path.|$|E
5|$|Crease {{was born}} at Ince Castle, in Cornwall, {{the son of a}} Royal Navy captain. He earned his BA from Clare College, Cambridge and then studied law at the Middle Temple. Though called to the bar in June 1849, he did not {{immediately}} pursue his career in law. Instead he joined his parents in an unsuccessful canal building endeavour in Upper Canada. After only a short turn as a barrister on his return to England, he took a job in Cornwall managing a tin mine owned by Great <b>Wheal</b> Vor United Mines, which ended with his employer suing him.|$|E

40|$|Bovine slow-reacting {{substance}} of anaphylaxis (SRS-A) {{is capable of}} producing dose-dependent vascular permeability changes in the skin of calves. The <b>wheals</b> are well-defined indurations, similar to <b>wheals</b> induced by histamine but different from those induced by prostaglandin E 2 (PGE). Three proposed SRS-A receptor blockers (i. e.

25|$|Medieval mining {{locations}} {{began to}} take on modern methods of mining in the 19th century, like that at <b>Wheal</b> Coates. <b>Wheal</b> Lushington {{is thought to have}} been the biggest tin mining operation in the area. Operational by 1808, smelting was also performed at <b>Wheal</b> Lushington. Modern mining practices were employed at Blue Hills Mine about 1810 and until 1897. There had been prior mining activities in that area before 1780. A number of copper, tin and arsenic mines operated during the 18th, 19th and some into the 20th century.|$|E

In 2010, the population was 1,440 in St Agnes Central and 2,480 in St Agnes Fringe, Mithian and Trevellas for a total of 3,920 people.

40|$|People {{frequently}} experience <b>whealing</b> {{and delayed}} papules from mosquito bites. Various antihistamines have previously been tried {{for the treatment}} of this condition. We performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study with levocetirizine 5 mg and matched placebo in 30 adults who were sensitive to mosquito bites. On the third treatment day the subjects received two Aedes aegypti bites on the forearm. The size of the bite lesions and the intensity of pruritus (visual analogue scale) were measured. Bite symptoms could be analysed in 28 subjects at 15 min and in 8 subjects at 24 h. Levocetirizine decreased the size of <b>wheals</b> by 60 % (p < 0. 001) and accompanying pruritus by 62 % (p < 0. 001) compared with placebo. The effect of levocetirizine increased in a linear fashion with the size of <b>wheals</b> and was most significant in the subjects with largest bite lesions. Levocetirizine also decreased the size of 24 -h bite lesions by 71 % (p= 0. 008) and accompanying pruritus by 56 % (p= 0. 016). These results show that prophylactic levocetirizine 5 mg is an effective treatment for both immediate and delayed mosquito bite symptoms and is especially effective in subjects with large <b>wheals...</b>|$|R

40|$|Aquagenic {{urticaria}} {{is a rare}} form {{of physical}} urticaria, in which contact with water evokes <b>wheals.</b> A 19 -year-old man and a 4 -year-old boy complained of recurrent episodes of urticaria.

Well-defined pin head to small pea-sized <b>wheals</b> surrounded by variable sized erythema were provoked by contact with water on the face, neck, and trunk, regardless of its temperature or source.

40|$|Food-dependent, exercise-induced {{anaphylaxis}} (FDEIA) is the triggering of anaphylaxis after {{ingestion of}} certain foods when followed by physical exercise. Symptoms vary from the typical generalized urticaria to severe allergic reactions. We report {{the case of}} a 20 -year-old woman who had a 7 -year history of recurrent <b>wheals</b> and dyspnea after ingesting sev-eral kinds of food (wheat, pork, and beef) along with physical exercise. Based on a provocation test, she was diagnosed with wheat-dependent, exercise-induced anaphylaxis. She was instructed to take 2 mg of ketotifen 2 hours before in-gestion of wheat to prevent the symptoms, and subsequently the provocation test did not elicit <b>wheals.</b> We therefore pre-scribed ketotifen (1 mg twice a day).

25|$|Tin mining {{once played}} an {{important}} part in the economy of Penwith, with mines across the district including Levant, Botallack, Cape Cornwall, Ding Dong and <b>Wheal</b> Hope. Tin mines gradually became economically mined out though the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, as the easier seams were exhausted and more amenable sources of metal were discovered in South America. The collapse of the world tin cartel in 1983 finished what remained of the industry.|$|E
25|$|Beam engines {{were found}} to be less {{suitable}} than rotary steam engines, because of the jerk experienced when the piston changed direction, and in Cornwall only the <b>Wheal</b> Reeth man engine, Godolphin, (where a pumping engine was converted to this new use) was powered by a piston acting directly on the rods. When not in use for the man engine, it was an advantage that a rotary engine could also be used to power a whim.|$|E
