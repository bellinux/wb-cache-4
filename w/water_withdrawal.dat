5|$|The St. Johns River {{is under}} {{consideration}} {{as an additional}} water source to meet growing public water needs. In 2008, the river's Water Management District undertook a Water Supply Impact Study of the proposed water withdrawals and asked the National Research Council to review science aspects of the study as it progressed. This resulted {{in a series of}} four reports that assessed the impact of <b>water</b> <b>withdrawal</b> on river level and flow, reviewed potential impacts on wetland ecosystems, and presented overall perspectives on the Water Management District study. The National Research Council found that, overall, the District performed a competent job in relating predicted environmental responses, including their magnitude and general degree of uncertainty, to the proposed range of water withdrawals. However, the report noted that the District's final report should acknowledge such critical issues as include future sea-level rises, population growth, and urban development. Although the District predicted that changes in water management would increase water levels and flows that exceed the proposed surface water withdrawals, these predictions have high uncertainties.|$|E

40|$|Humans have {{strongly}} impacted {{the global}} water cycle, not only water flows but also water storage. We have performed a first global-scale {{analysis of the}} impact of <b>water</b> <b>withdrawals</b> on <b>water</b> storage variations, using the global water resources and use model WaterGAP. This required estimation of fractions of total <b>water</b> <b>withdrawals</b> from groundwater, considering five water use sectors. According to our assessment, the source of 35 % of the water withdrawn worldwide (4300 cubic km/yr during 1998 - 2002) is groundwater. Groundwater contributes 42 %, 36 % and 27 % of water used for irrigation, households and manufacturing, respectively, while we assume that only surface water is used for livestock and for cooling of thermal power plants. Consumptive water use was 1400 cubic km/yr during 1998 - 2002. It is the sum of the net abstraction of 250 cubic km/yr of groundwater (taking into account evapotranspiration and return flows of withdrawn surface water and groundwater) and the net abstraction of 1150 km 3 /yr of surface water. Computed net abstractions indicate, {{for the first time at}} the global scale, where and when human <b>water</b> <b>withdrawals</b> decrease or increase groundwater or surface water storage. In regions with extensive surface water irrigation, such as Southern China, net abstractions from groundwater are negative, i. e. groundwater is recharged by irrigation. The opposite is true for areas dominated by groundwater irrigation, such as in the High Plains aquifer of the central USA, where net abstraction of surface water is negative because return flow of withdrawn groundwater recharges the surface water compartments. In intensively irrigated areas, the amplitude of seasonal total water storage variations is generally increased due to human water use; however, in some areas, it is decreased. For the High Plains aquifer and the whole Mississippi basin, modeled groundwater and total water storage variations were compared with estimates of groundwater storage variations based on groundwater table observations, and with estimates of total water storage variations from the GRACE satellites mission. Due to the difficulty in estimating area-averaged seasonal groundwater storage variations from point observations of groundwater levels, it is uncertain whether WaterGAP underestimates actual variations or not. We conclude that WaterGAP possibly overestimates <b>water</b> <b>withdrawals</b> in the High Plains aquifer where impact of human water use on water storage is readily discernible based on WaterGAP calculations and groundwater observations. No final conclusion can be drawn regarding the possibility of monitoring <b>water</b> <b>withdrawals</b> in the High Plains aquifer using GRACE.
