50|$|Wheel speed sensors {{mounted on}} {{front and rear}} wheel {{constantly}} measure the rotational speed of each wheel and deliver this information to an Electronic Control Unit (ECU). The ECU detects {{on the one hand}} if the deceleration of one wheel exceeds a fixed threshold {{and on the other hand}} whether the brake slip, calculated based on information of both wheels, rises above a certain percentage and enters an unstable zone. These are indicators for a high possibility of a locking wheel. To countermeasure these irregularities the ECU signals the hydraulic unit to hold or to release pressure. After signals show the return to the stable zone, pressure is increased again. Past models used a piston for the control of the fluid pressure. Most recent models regulate the pressure by rapidly opening and closing solenoid valves.While the basic principle and architecture has been carried over from passenger car ABS, typical motorcycle characteristics have to be considered during the development and application processes.One characteristic is the change of the dynamic wheel load during braking. Compared to cars, the wheel load changes are more drastic, which can lead to a <b>wheel</b> <b>lift</b> up and a fall over. This can be intensified by a soft suspension. Some systems are equipped with a rear <b>wheel</b> <b>lift</b> off mitigation functionality. When the indicators of a possible rear lift off are detected, the system releases brake pressure on the front wheel to counter this behavior.Another difference is that in case of the motorcycle the front wheel is much more important for stability than the rear wheel. If the front wheel locks up between 0.2-0.7s, it loses gyrostatic forces and the motorcycle starts to oscillate because the increased influence of side forces operating on the wheel contact line. The motorcycle becomes unstable and falls.|$|E

40|$|Targets for {{reducing}} emissions and improving energy efficiency present {{the automotive industry}} with many challenges. Passenger cars {{are by far the}} most common means of personal transport in the developed part of the world, and energy consumption related to personal transportation is predicted to increase significantly in the coming decades. Improved aerodynamic performance of passenger cars will be one of many important areas which will occupy engineers and researchers for the foreseeable future. The significance of wheels and wheel housings is well known today, but the relative importance of the different components has still not been fully investigated. A number of investigations highlighting the importance of proper ground simulation have been published, and recently a number of studies on improved aerodynamic design of the wheel have been presented as well. This study is an investigation of aerodynamic influences of different tyres. Two different tyre models were investigated in combination with three different wheel designs using the Volvo Aerodynamic Wind Tunnel; including moving ground and rotating wheels. In addition to force measurements, flow field investigations were also performed using both surface pressure probes and 12 - hole pressure probes. The tyre sizes investigated in this study were 215 / 50 R 17 and 215 / 55 R 16. An investigation of changes to the tyre geometry for 215 / 55 /R 16 tyres was also performed using two high speed cameras in the wind tunnel. Results show that different tyre types {{have a significant effect on}} not only aerodynamic drag, but also on lift to some extent. Drag differences between 5 – 10 drag counts were measured depending on wheel and vehicle configuration. It was also concluded that the drag difference between tyre types was dependent on wheel design. The flow field investigations showed noticeable changes to the front wheel wake structures as well as significant changes in the rear wheel and base wake structures. Investigations of the tyre deformations showed changes in <b>wheel</b> <b>lift,</b> as well as radial expansion and axial compression correlating with the observed drag changes...|$|E

50|$|Under most {{conditions}} {{the car is}} very responsive and forgiving, but it has some handling issues. The chassis, which is shared by the TR2, TR3, TR3A and TR4 has limited wheel travel. As a result, on very hard cornering, the inside rear <b>wheel</b> can <b>lift,</b> causing sudden over-steer due to the increased load on the outside rear tyre. This is particularly true with radial tyres; the original TR2/3/3A suspension was built with older, crossply tyre designs in mind. The <b>wheel</b> <b>lifting</b> is more sudden than that of other cars, because it is caused by coming {{to the end of}} the suspension travel while there is still load on the tyre, so the load on the other (outside) rear wheel is a discontinuous function of cornering load, rather than just changing slope.|$|R

Each van was evaluated with up to four load configurations depending on the test performed. he GMC Savana 3500 was tested with ESC enabled and disabled. Two maneuvers were used in this study: the Slowly Increasing Steer (SIS) and the NHTSA Road Edge Recovery (RER, {{also known as the}} NHTSA Fishhook). maneuver was used to measure maximum lateral acceleration and terminal yaw stability. e RER maneuver was used to quantify dynamic rollover resistance. Slowly Increasing Steer tests revealed that the terminal yaw stability of each vehicle was highly asymmetric, strongly depending on what combination of direction of steer and load was used. nerally speaking, Nominal Load tests produced higher lateral accelerations than those performed with 15 -Occupant loading. In the case of the GMC Savana 3500, the yaw stability observed during Nominal Load SIS tests depended on whether ESC was enabled or disabled; stability was much improved when ESC was enabled. When evaluated with the 15 -Occupant load, differences between ESC enabled and disabled SIS tests were much less apparent. Generally speaking, the static stability factors and dynamic rollover resistance of the vans degraded as the number of occupants increased. The only exception was that the maneuver entrance speed capable of producing two-wheel lift with 10 -Occupant loading was lower than that required by the 15 -Occupant configuration for the Ford E- 350. None of the load configurations used in this study induced two-wheel lift during RER tests performed with the GMC Savana 3500 when its ESC was enabled. However, when ESC was disabled the Savana 3500 's dynamic rollover resistance progressively worsened as the number of occupants increased. Results from this study indicate that installation of ESC on 15 -passenger vans may have important safety benefits in some, but not necessarily all, on-road driving situations.

40|$|The {{performance}} {{and safety of}} current open wheeler race cars depend heavily {{on the effectiveness of}} the aerodynamic package. The front wing and front wheels make a significant contribution and therefore must be well understood. Previous investigations have focused on the aerodynamic characteristics of either an isolated downforce generating wing in ground effect or a rotating wheel in isolation. Investigations that have considering both bodies working in unison conflictingly claim that the addition of a wheel downstream of a wing can aid or hinder the performance of the wing, and the wheel&# 146;s aerodynamic performance has not been reported. In order to obtain a more thorough understanding of the interaction of a wing and wheel, experimental results were used to conduct an extensive validation of a computational model, after an equally rigorous verification study had been conducted. A number of investigations were then conducted of a wing and wheel working in unison as well as each in isolation using the computational model. The combined wing and wheel investigation demonstrated that three main interactions can occur, depending on the selection of wing span, angle of attack and height used, while the wheel width and track were found to be less sensitive parameters. The three interacting states differ in the path that the main and secondary wing vortices take around the wheel and the subsequent variation in the combined wake structure. In general, the wing {{in the presence of the}} wheel reduced the wing&# 146;s ability to generate downforce by up to 45 %. This is due to the high pressure regions generated forward of the wheel, which reduce the suction that can be achieved by the bottom surface. This was also found to alleviate the adverse pressure gradients experienced by the wing, and also reduce the drag by up to 70 %. For this reason, the downforce loss phenomenon was observed to occur at a height 0. 08 c to 0. 32 c lower in comparison to the same wing in isolation, dependant on the wing span. <b>Wheel</b> <b>lift</b> and drag values were also observed to reduce in the presence of a wing by up to 65 % and 38 % respectively. The upwash and vortices generated by the wing were found to assist in reducing the separation from the contact patch and increasing the separation from the upper wheel tread; a phenomenon also observed during an isolated wheel investigation which was found to reduce the wheel&# 146;s lift and drag. As a result, it was shown that the combined wing and wheel downforce and drag optima differed by up to 75 % and 25 % respectively to those which would be estimated if the two bodies were investigated individually and the results summed. This highlights the importance of investigating these two bodies in unison...|$|E
