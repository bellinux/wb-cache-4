5|$|After early <b>work</b> <b>around</b> Philadelphia and New York City, Richie Powell {{played in}} the bands of Paul Williams (1951–52) and Johnny Hodges (1952–54). He {{switched}} {{in the spring of}} 1954 to being pianist and arranger for the quintet co-led by trumpeter Clifford Brown and drummer Max Roach. This band toured extensively across the U.S. for two years, and released both studio and concert recordings, including the Grammy Hall of Fame inductee Clifford Brown & Max Roach.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} game's {{conversion}} to Steamworks, Gold Edition was released for Microsoft Windows on March 26, 2015. Owners of the game from Steam or as a boxed retail Games For Windows Live can acquire a free Steamworks copy of the base game and purchase the new Gold Edition content. The Steamworks version did not allow the use of Nvidia's 3D Vision technology or fan modifications, though Capcom later confirmed a way to <b>work</b> <b>around</b> these issues.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, Oslo Sporveier again {{proposed}} {{closing the}} Ekeberg Line. This time {{the reason was}} {{the construction of the}} Oslo Tunnel and Oslo Central Station, which would involve construction <b>work</b> <b>around</b> Jernbanetorget. This proposal also resulted in a public reactions, and the same arguments from the mid-1960s were repeated. Again the suggestion to link the Lilleaker Line to the Ekeberg Line were launched. Oslo Sporveier calculated it would cost NOK3.6 million for investments, including rebuilding 20 Gullfisk trams, new rectifiers and new tracks. This was less than the necessary 30 buses needed for conversion to bus services.|$|E

The proposed development includes the construction of an 800-seat subterranean performance venue. Numbers 1–6 and 17–21 Denmark Place, which run parallel along the back of the street, and the York and Clifton Mansions will be demolished, along with partial demolition of No. 21 Denmark Street.|$|E
5|$|Life in Nelson {{remained}} {{difficult for}} Heaphy, who had by now lost his appetite for exploration. He eked {{out a living}} taking occasional jobs {{for the next six}} months. For much of 1847, he undertook survey <b>work</b> <b>around</b> Tasman Bay and later in that year was the representative of the New Zealand Company, when the government investigated the amount of land set aside by the company for the local Māori. Work had dried up by early 1848 and when he was offered employment with the Auckland Survey Office in April 1848, he accepted.|$|E
5|$|Mitsuda {{returned}} {{as the lead}} composer for 1999s Chrono Cross after composing its predecessor, Chrono Trigger. After being contacted to compose the score by the game's director Masato Kato, Mitsuda decided to center his <b>work</b> <b>around</b> old world cultural influences, including Mediterranean, Fado, Celtic, and percussive African music. To complement the theme of parallel worlds, he gave the songs for the two worlds of the game, Another and Home, respectively dark and bright moods. Mitsuda was happy to accomplish even half of what he envisioned. Once production concluded, Mitsuda played Chrono Cross to record his impressions and observe how the tracks intermingled with scenes.|$|E

5|$|Originally {{intended}} to be a proof of concept, BackupHDDVD is severely limited in its ability to produce fully functional copies of commercial discs. Early versions were unable to properly decrypt discs which used the in-movie experience technology. New versions <b>work</b> <b>around</b> this limitation by excluding interactive content from decrypted copies. The utility cannot process HD DVD navigation functionality which enables menus, chapters, secondary audio tracks and subtitles, so these features are inaccessible in copies created by BackupHDDVD. Most versions provide no validation for keys and will still attempt to decrypt a disc's contents with an incorrect key, resulting in corrupt files.|$|E
5|$|The filming {{was done}} at two hospitals, the Northwick Park Hospital in Middlesex and the North Hampshire Hospital in Basingstoke. This {{presented}} a problem because the show had to <b>work</b> <b>around</b> the real-life hospitals, with their actual doctors, patients and emergency situations. In one scene in the final episode in series one, Guy (Mangan) was hitting squash balls behind him, and nearly hit a patient. However, some scenes, {{such as those in}} Sue's and Alan's offices, were filmed in a studio.|$|E
5|$|The race began {{behind the}} safety car due to rain {{shortly before the}} start. Hamilton was able to convert his pole {{position}} into a third straight victory at the British Grand Prix, leading home Rosberg and Verstappen in changing conditions. Rosberg came {{under investigation by the}} race stewards after he received detailed instructions by his team how to <b>work</b> <b>around</b> a gearbox problem in the closing laps of the race, a practice forbidden under Formula One regulations. He was later handed a ten-second time penalty, demoting him to third place. The result saw Rosberg's championship lead reduced to just a single point over Hamilton.|$|E

5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 2000s {{and into}} the early 2010s, the genre started to become more commercially {{successful}} in the UK, with more singles and remixes entering the music charts. Music journalists and critics also noticed a dubstep influence in several pop artists' <b>work.</b> <b>Around</b> this time, producers also began to fuse elements of the original dubstep sound with other influences, creating fusion genres including future garage, the slower and more experimental post-dubstep, and the harsher electro house and heavy metal influenced brostep, the latter of which greatly contributed to dubstep's rising mainstream popularity in the United States.|$|E
5|$|A second prototype, {{completed}} {{near the}} end of 1978, had only about eight rooms, a single dragon, and two objects, and Robinett recognized that the game, though demonstrating what he had set out to do, was boring. He put the game aside for a few months and came back with additional ideas to improve the game, finishing it by June 1979. Two changes that Robinett added were the possibility of being eaten by the dragon, as well as the means to reset the avatar if this should happen, and the addition of the sword object, which could kill the dragon. Robinett found the various possibilities that arose from this combination of elements improved the excitement of the game, and subsequently made three dragons, reusing the same code for the behavior of all three. The magnet was created to <b>work</b> <b>around</b> a potential situation where the player could drop an object into a wall space and make it irretrievable.|$|E
5|$|As the game's {{dialogue}} {{consists of}} a lot of wordplay and misunderstandings, Smith would analyze scenes before writing them: he would see what the scenes were trying to accomplish, and where the beats in them were. After he had the structure of a scene in his head, he would write it; at times he was able {{to make use of the}} original Japanese dialogue, but most of the time he had to come up with new ideas himself. At several points, the English wordplay was inspired by the wordplay in the Japanese version. At some points, it was not possible to do wordplay in the same places as in the Japanese version, so Smith would change the structure of the scene slightly. At other points, Smith came up with a joke or funny line, and changed the scene to make the joke <b>work.</b> <b>Around</b> half of the jokes were rewritten based on the characters present in the scene, rather than being translations of the Japanese jokes.|$|E

5|$|In 1981, Sharman {{reunited with}} O'Brien to do Shock Treatment, a {{stand-alone}} feature {{that was not}} a direct sequel to the original film. This film reunites characters Brad and Janet and was originally conceived and written to depict the characters filmed in normal settings until the production changed to <b>work</b> <b>around</b> a Screen Actor's Guild strike. The eventual production would now entail the full film being shot entirely within a sound stage and purposely blending that into the story line. Shock Treatment has a cult following but not nearly as strong as the first film, and was a commercial failure in no small part due to the principal cast of Curry, Sarandon and Bostwick not returning.|$|E
5|$|Mason {{was born}} in 1725, most likely {{in what is now}} Fairfax County, Virginia. His father died when he was young, and his mother managed the family estates until he came of age. He married in 1750, built Gunston Hall, and lived the life of a country squire, supervising his lands, family, and slaves. He briefly served in the House of Burgesses and {{involved}} himself in community affairs, sometimes serving with his neighbor George Washington. As tensions grew between Britain and the American colonies, Mason came to support the colonial side, and used his knowledge and experience to help the revolutionary cause, finding ways to <b>work</b> <b>around</b> the Stamp Act of 1765 and serving in the pro-independence Fourth Virginia Convention of 1775 and the Fifth Virginia Convention of 1776.|$|E
5|$|Several of the gatehouses {{played an}} {{important}} part in the administration of the town in the 15th century. South Gate formed the main administrative centre for the port during the period, housing the Clerk of the King's Ships and collecting customs revenue. It was expanded in the 1430s and 1440s, but was in poor condition again by the 1480s, resulting in fresh construction <b>work</b> <b>around</b> the site. Bargate was partially used as a prison from the 15th century, in a similar fashion to many other towns. The first floor of the building had been used as the town's guildhall from at least 1441 onwards, and the treasury was kept in one of the towers. Elaborate feasts were served there on special occasions.|$|E

5|$|Since so {{many new}} sets had to be created, the {{production}} commenced filming with location photography. Four days were spent in the Titan Missile Museum, south of Tucson, Arizona—the disarmed nuclear missile was fitted with a fiberglass capsule shell to stand in for the Phoenixs booster and command module. The old missile silo provided a large set that the budget would have prohibited building from scratch, but the small size created difficulties. Each camera move was planned in advance to <b>work</b> <b>around</b> areas where the lighting would be added, and electricians and grips donned rock-climbing harnesses to move down the shaft and attach the lights. To give greater dimension to the rocket and lend the missile a futuristic appearance, Leonetti chose to offset the missile's metallic surface with complementary colors. Using different-colored gels made the rocket appear longer than it actually was; to complete the effect, shots from the Phoenixs nose downwards and from the engines up were filmed with a 30mm lens to lengthen the missile.|$|E
5|$|The Apollo {{program has}} been called the {{greatest}} technological achievement in human history. Apollo stimulated many areas of technology, leading to over 1,800 spinoff products as of 2015. The flight computer design used in both the Lunar and Command Modules was, along with the Polaris and Minuteman missile systems, the driving force behind early research into integrated circuits (IC). By 1963, Apollo was using 60 percent of the United States' production of ICs. The crucial difference between the requirements of Apollo and the missile programs was Apollo's much greater need for reliability. While the Navy and Air Force could <b>work</b> <b>around</b> reliability problems by deploying more missiles, the political and financial cost of failure of an Apollo mission was unacceptably high.|$|E
5|$|The Hungarian {{conquest of}} the Carpathian Basin is the {{principal}} subject of the Gesta Hungarorum, which is the earliest extant Hungarian chronicle. Most scholars agree that a notary of Béla III of Hungary, who ruled between 1173 and 1196, wrote the Gesta after the king's death. According to an alternative theory, {{the author of the}} Gesta, who is now known as Anonymus, had served Béla II of Hungary before starting to complete his <b>work</b> <b>around</b> 1150. Anonymus did not write of Svatopluk I of Moravia, Braslav, Duke of Lower Pannonia and the invading Magyars' other opponents who had been mentioned in works written in earlier centuries. Neither did he refer to the Magyars' fights with the Moravians, Franks and Bavarians which had been described in earlier annals and chronicles. On the other hand, Anonymus wrote of local polities and rulersincluding Gelou, the Vlach duke of Transylvania, Menumorut, the lord of the regions between the rivers Mureș, Someș and Tisza, and Salanus, the Bulgar ruler of the lands between the Danube and the Tiszaunknown from other primary sources.|$|E
