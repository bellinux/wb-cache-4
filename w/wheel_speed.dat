40|$|Results are {{presented}} {{of the study}} of the Venusian atmosphere, Magellan aerodynamic moment coefficients, moments of inertia, and solar moment coefficients. This investigation is based upon the use of attitude control data in the form of reaction <b>wheel</b> <b>speeds</b> from the Magellan spacecraft. As the spacecraft enters the upper atmosphere of Venus, measurable torques are experienced due to aerodynamic effects. Solar and gravity gradient effects also cause additional torques throughout the orbit. In order to maintain an inertially fixed attitude, the control system counteracts these torques by changing the angular rates of three reaction wheels. Model reaction <b>wheel</b> <b>speeds</b> are compared to observed Magellan reaction <b>wheel</b> <b>speeds</b> through a differential correction procedure. This method determines aerodynamic, atmospheric, solar pressure and mass moments of inertia parameters. Atmospheric measurements include both base densities and scale heights. Atmospheric base density results confirm natural variability as measured by the standard orbital decay method. Potential inconsistencies in free molecular aerodynamic moment coefficients are identified. Moments of inertia are determined with a precision better than 1 % of the largest principal moment of inertia. PAGE BLANK NOT FILMED ii...|$|R

The model is used to evaluate coupled dynamics of the SNAP spacecraft with both fixed base and free-free boundary conditions to mimic launch and on-orbit situations. The model is then used to evaluate the magnitudes of on-orbit telescope deflections induced by residual imbalances in spinning reaction wheels. It is shown that, when reaction <b>wheel</b> <b>speeds</b> are below fundamental resonances, the induced jitter is negligible or well below requirements.

25|$|The {{brain of}} the ESC {{system is the}} {{electronic}} control unit (ECU). The various control techniques are embedded in it. Often, the same ECU is used for diverse systems {{at the same time}} (ABS, Traction control system, climate control, etc.). The input signals are sent through the input-circuit to the digital controller. The desired vehicle state is determined based upon the steering wheel angle, its gradient and the <b>wheel</b> <b>speed.</b> Simultaneously, the yaw sensor measures the actual state. The controller computes the needed brake or acceleration force for each wheel and directs via the driver circuits the valves of the hydraulic modulator. Via a Controller Area Network interface the ECU is connected with other systems (ABS, etc.) in order to avoid giving contradictory commands.|$|E
25|$|The Butler Petrol Cycle was a {{three-wheeled}} vehicle, {{with the}} rear wheel directly driven by a 5/8hp (466W) 600 cc (40 in3; 2¼×5-inch {57×127-mm}) flat twin four stroke engine (with magneto ignition replaced by coil and battery) equipped with rotary valves and a float-fed carburettor (five years before Maybach) and Ackermann steering, {{all of which were}} state of the art at the time. Starting was by compressed air. The engine was liquid-cooled, with a radiator over the rear driving <b>wheel.</b> <b>Speed</b> was controlled by means of a throttle valve lever. No braking system was fitted; the vehicle was stopped by raising and lowering the rear driving wheel using a foot-operated lever; the weight of the machine was then borne by two small castor wheels. The driver was seated between the front wheels. It wasn't, however, a success, as Butler failed to find sufficient financial backing.|$|E
25|$|Typically ABS {{includes}} a central {{electronic control unit}} (ECU), four <b>wheel</b> <b>speed</b> sensors, {{and at least two}} hydraulic valves within the brake hydraulics. The ECU constantly monitors the rotational speed of each wheel; if it detects the wheel rotating significantly slower than the speed of the vehicle, a condition indicative of impending wheel lock, it actuates the valves to reduce hydraulic pressure to the brake at the affected wheel, thus reducing the braking force on that wheel; the wheel then turns faster. Conversely, if the ECU detects a wheel turning significantly faster than the others, brake hydraulic pressure to the wheel is increased so the braking force is reapplied, slowing down the wheel. This process is repeated continuously and can be detected by the driver via brake pedal pulsation. Some anti-lock systems can apply or release braking pressure 15 times per second. Because of this, the wheels of cars equipped with ABS are practically impossible to lock even during panic braking in extreme conditions.|$|E
25|$|During normal driving, ESC {{works in}} the {{background}} and continuously monitors steering and vehicle direction.

2500|$|Many ESC {{systems have}} an [...] "off" [...] {{override}} switch so the driver can disable ESC, {{which may be}} desirable when badly stuck in mud or snow, or driving on a beach, or if using a smaller-sized spare tire which would interfere with the sensors. Some systems also offer an additional mode with raised thresholds so that a driver can utilize the limits of adhesion with less electronic intervention. However, ESC defaults to [...] "On" [...] when the ignition is restarted. Some ESC systems that lack an [...] "off switch", such as on many recent Toyota and Lexus vehicles, can be temporarily disabled through an undocumented series of brake pedal and handbrake operations. Furthermore, unplugging a <b>wheel</b> <b>speed</b> sensor is another method of disabling most ESC systems. [...] The ESC implementation on newer Ford vehicles cannot be completely disabled even {{through the use of}} the [...] "off switch". [...] The ESC will automatically reactivate at highway speeds, and below that if it detects a skid with the brake pedal depressed.|$|E
