5|$|Artificial {{climbing}} <b>walls</b> <b>are</b> used {{to simulate}} boulder problems in an indoor environment, usually at climbing gyms. These <b>walls</b> <b>are</b> constructed with wooden panels, polymer cement panels, concrete shells, or precast molds of actual rock walls. Holds, usually made of plastic, are then bolted onto {{the wall to}} create problems. The walls often feature steep overhanging surfaces, forcing the climber to employ highly technical movements while supporting much of their weight with their upper body strength.|$|E
5|$|Harry's <b>Walls</b> <b>are</b> {{the remains}} of an {{unfinished}} artillery fort, started in 1551 {{by the government of}} Edward VI to defend the island of St Mary's in the Isles of Scilly. Constructed to defend the harbour of Hugh Town from possible French attack, the fortification incorporated Italianate-style bastions with protective orillons and would have been the most advanced design in the kingdom at the time. It was not completed, probably due to a shortage of funds and the passing of the invasion threat, and only the south-west side remains. In the 21st century, Harry's <b>Walls</b> <b>are</b> managed by English Heritage and open to visitors.|$|E

The first four terrace <b>walls</b> <b>are</b> showcases for bas-relief sculptures. These are exquisite, considered to be the most elegant and graceful in the ancient Buddhist world.|$|E
5|$|Four major rock {{formations}} {{are present in}} Worlds End State Park, all at least partly from the Carboniferous period. The youngest of these, which forms the highest points in the park, is the early Pennsylvanian Pottsville Formation, a gray conglomerate that may contain sandstone, siltstone, and shale, as well as anthracite coal. The Loyalsock gorge rim and {{the upper part of}} its <b>walls</b> <b>are</b> the late Mississippian Mauch Chunk Formation, which is formed with grayish-red shale, siltstone, sandstone, and conglomerate. Below this is the Mississippian Burgoon Formation, which comprises buff-colored sandstone and conglomerate. The creek bed and base of the gorge <b>walls</b> <b>are</b> the late Devonian and early Mississippian Huntley Mountain Formation, which is made of relatively soft grayish-red shale and olive-gray sandstone.|$|E

50|$|In 1823 {{a replica}} Carnot <b>wall</b> <b>was</b> {{constructed}} at Woolwich, Kent to test Carnot's theories. This <b>wall</b> <b>was</b> 21 ft high and 22 ft long. The tapering <b>wall</b> <b>was</b> 7 ft thick {{at its base}} and 6 ft thick at the top. A rampart of equal height with the <b>wall</b> <b>was</b> built {{in front of it}} to represent that of a real fort. The idea was that the gunners would be unable to see the wall itself when firing.|$|R
5|$|Most churches {{prior to}} the Reformation had painted walls, often with murals; these were {{whitewashed}} by the reformers, and often religious texts or the Ten Commandments replaced the images. These inscriptions were in turn obliterated under the Catholic Queen Mary.

50|$|Piran's three <b>walls</b> <b>were</b> {{built in}} {{response}} to the city's expansion. The first <b>wall</b> <b>was</b> built in the 7th century, separating the town into four streets, named for each entrance into the town: Miljska, Stolna, Osrednja (main) and Poljska. The first <b>wall</b> can <b>be</b> seen in the old part of the town. The <b>wall</b> <b>was</b> moved south-west when new streets were built. The fortification <b>wall,</b> which <b>was</b> built along the southern coast of the town, hasn't changed much since it was first built.|$|R
50|$|When a box {{is slowly}} expanded, the {{frequency}} of the light recoiling from thewall can be computed from the Doppler shift. If the <b>wall</b> <b>is</b> not moving,the light recoils at the same frequency. If the <b>wall</b> <b>is</b> moving slowly, the recoil frequency is only equal in the frame where the <b>wall</b> <b>is</b> stationary. In the frame where the <b>wall</b> <b>is</b> moving away from the light, the light coming in is bluer than the light coming out by twice the Doppler shift factor v/c.|$|R

5|$|The basidia are 15–25×3.5–5.5µm {{and have}} a slim, club-like shape. Each {{basidium}} features four sterigmata, each of which bear one spore. The spores' shape is slimly ellipsoidal or cylindrical. Their surface is smooth and their <b>walls</b> <b>are</b> thin. Although they are colourless and hyaline, the spores are amyloid, meaning they will turn bluish or purple when stained with Melzer's reagent. This characteristic differs from other very similar species, and this gave the genus its name.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} was altered in 1890, with two additions of Victorian architecture, the first being the main entrance, above the fanlight, is an arched awning with incised consoles. The other addition was the octagonal cupola {{on the roof}} over the original bell tower which dates from 1830. The exterior of the school has complementary colors. The <b>walls</b> <b>are</b> painted a cream color while the foundation, doors, window trims, and cornices are a chocolate-brown.|$|E
