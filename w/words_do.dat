5|$|The {{single-celled}} choanoflagellates {{resemble the}} choanocyte cells of sponges {{which are used}} to drive their water flow systems and capture most of their food. This along with phylogenetic studies of ribosomal molecules {{have been used as}} morphological evidence to suggest sponges are the sister group to the rest of animals. Some studies have shown that sponges do not form a monophyletic group, in other <b>words</b> <b>do</b> not include all and only the descendants of a common ancestor. Recent phylogenetic analyses suggest that comb jellies rather than sponges are the sister group to the rest of animals.|$|E
5|$|It is {{constructed}} in a verse-pre-chorus-chorus form, with a bridge before {{the third and}} fourth chorus. It starts with an instrumental introduction, and uses a chord progression of C–B–Am7–G, that is also used during the verses and the chorus. In the first verse, Halliwell, Chisholm, Bunton, and Beckham sing each one line. The chords change to Dm11–Dm9–Dm11–Dm9–Dm7–Em7–F major7–G during the pre-chorus, followed by the chorus. The same pattern occurs leading to the second chorus, {{the first part of the}} second verse consists on the repeated use of the <b>words</b> <b>do</b> and ba da, then Bunton and Chisholm sing the rest of the verse. The group then sing the bridge, and end the song repeating the chorus twice. The song uses the verse melody of When You Were Mine (Prince song) with slightly altered phrasing.|$|E

25|$|In the East Syriac {{variant of}} the alphabet, spirantization marks are usually omitted when they {{interfere}} with vowel marks. The degree to which letters can be spirantized varies from dialect to dialect as some dialects have lost the ability for certain letters to be spirantized. For native words, spirantization depends on the letter's position within a word or syllable, location relative to other consonants and vowels, gemination, etymology, and other factors. Foreign <b>words</b> <b>do</b> not always follow the rules for spirantization.|$|E

25|$|In the {{toolmakers}} paradigm, <b>words</b> <b>do</b> {{not contain}} ideas, so POEM1 cannot contain POEM2; therefore, {{a distinction between}} them must be preserved. Although {{there is only one}} POEM1 in most cases, the differences in mental content among people (and the difficult task of assembling it based on instructions in the text) mean that there are as many POEM2s as there are people. These internal POEM2s will only come to resemble one another after people expend effort comparing their mental content.|$|E
25|$|The French œil, Italian occhio, Spanish ojo, and Portuguese olho appear quite different, {{but they}} descend from a {{historical}} form oculus. German Auge, Dutch oog and English eye (cf. Czech and Polish oko, Ukrainian око (óko)) {{are related to}} this form in that all three descend from Proto-Indo-European *okʷ. In addition, international derivatives like ocular and oculista occur in all of Interlingua's control languages. Each of these forms contributes to the eligibility of the Interlingua word. German and English base <b>words</b> <b>do</b> not influence {{the form of the}} Interlingua word, because their Indo-European connection is considered too remote. Instead, the remaining base words and especially the derivatives determine the form oculo found in Interlingua.|$|E
25|$|Kant {{proceeds}} to motivate {{the need for}} the special sort of inquiry he calls a metaphysics of morals: “That there must be such a philosophy is evident from the common idea of duty and of moral laws.” The moral law must “carry with it absolute necessity.” (4:389) The content and the bindingness of the moral law, in other <b>words,</b> <b>do</b> not vary according to the particularities of agents or their circumstances. Given that the moral law, if it exists, is universal and necessary, the only appropriate means to investigate it is through a priori rational reflection. Thus, a correct theoretical understanding of morality requires a metaphysics of morals. Kant thinks that until we have completed this sort of investigation, “morals themselves are liable to all kinds of corruption” because the “guide and supreme norm for correctly estimating them are missing.” A fully specified account of the moral law will guard against the errors and rationalization to which human moral reasoning is prone. (4:390) The search for the supreme principle of morality—the antidote to confusion in the moral sphere—will occupy Kant for the first two chapters of the Groundwork.|$|E

500|$|Mass-classifiers (true measure <b>words)</b> <b>do</b> {{not pick}} out {{inherent}} properties {{of an individual}} noun like count-classifiers do; rather, they lump nouns into countable units. Thus, mass-classifiers can generally be used with multiple types of nouns; for example, while the mass-classifier (hé, box) {{can be used to}} count boxes of lightbulbs (yì [...] dēngpào, [...] "one [...] of lightbulbs") or of books (yì [...] jiàocái, [...] "one [...] of textbooks"), each of these nouns must use a different count-classifier when being counted by itself (yì [...] dēngpào [...] "one lightbulb"; vs. yì [...] jiàocái [...] "one textbook"). While count-classifiers have no direct English translation, mass-classifiers often do: phrases with count-classifiers such as (yí [...] rén, one- person) can only be translated as [...] "one person" [...] or [...] "a person", whereas those with mass-classifiers such as (yì [...] rén, one--person) can be translated as [...] "a crowd of people". All languages, including English, have mass-classifiers, but count-classifiers are unique to certain [...] "classifier languages", and are not a part of English grammar apart from a few exceptional cases such as head of livestock.|$|E
500|$|Since {{all modern}} ctenophores except the beroids have cydippid-like larvae, it has widely been assumed that their last common {{ancestor}} also resembled cydippids, having an egg-shaped {{body and a}} pair of retractable tentacles. Richard Harbison's purely morphological analysis in 1985 concluded that the cydippids are not monophyletic, in other <b>words</b> <b>do</b> not contain all and only the descendants of a single common ancestor that was itself a cydippid. Instead he found that various cydippid families were more similar to members of other ctenophore orders than to other cydippids. He also suggested that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores was either cydippid-like or beroid-like. A molecular phylogeny analysis in 2001, using 26 species, including 4 recently discovered ones, confirmed that the cydippids are not monophyletic and concluded that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores was cydippid-like. It also found that the genetic differences between these species were very small – so small that the relationships between the Lobata, Cestida and Thalassocalycida remained uncertain. This suggests that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores was relatively recent, and perhaps survived the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event [...] while other lineages perished. When the analysis was broadened to include representatives of other phyla, it concluded that cnidarians are probably more closely related to bilaterians than either group is to ctenophores but that this diagnosis is uncertain. A clade including Mertensia, Charistephane and Euplokamis may be the sister lineage to all other ctenophores.|$|E
