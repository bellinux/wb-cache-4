Residual nitrogen is washed into the mine pit and piped to a nearby retention pond where its removal is accomplished by microbial activity prior to a final <b>water</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>step</b> and release into the sub-Arctic lake, Lac de Gras. Microbial removal of ammonium in the retention pond is rapid during the brief ice-free summer, but often slows under ice cover that persists up to nine months of the year. The aluminosilicate mineral zeolite was tested as an additive to retention pond water to increase rates of ammonium removal at 4 &# 176;C. Water samples were collected across {{the length of the}} retention pond monthly over a year. The structure of the microbial community (bacteria, archaea, and eukarya), as determined by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of PCR-amplified small subunit ribosomal RNA genes, was more stable during cold months than during July-September, when there was a marked phytoplankton bloom. Of the ammonia-oxidizing community, only bacterial amoA genes were consistently detected. Zeolite (10 g) was added to retention pond water (100 mL) amended with 5 mM ammonium and incubated at 12 &# 176;C to encourage development of a nitrifying biofilm. The biofilm community was composed of different amoA phylotypes from those identified in gene clone libraries of native water samples. Zeolite biofilm was added to fresh water samples collected at different times of the year, resulting in a significant increase in laboratory measurements of potential nitrification activity at 4 &# 176;C. A significant positive correlation between the amount of zeolite biofilm and potential nitrification activity was observed; rates were unaffected in incubations containing 1 - 20 mM ammonium. Addition of zeolite to retention ponds in cold environments could effectively increase nitrification rates year round by concentrating active nitrifying biomass...|$|E
40|$|This {{work was}} {{concerned}} with the determination of mass transfer and kinetic parameters of ozone reactions with four organic compounds from different families, namely reactive dye RO 16, triclocarban, naphthalene and methanol. In {{order to understand the}} mechanisms of ozone reactions with the organic pollutants, a radical scavenger (t-butanol) was used and the pH was varied from 2 to 9. Ozone solubility (CAL*) is an important parameter that affects both mass transfer rates and chemical reaction kinetics. In order to determine accurate values of the CAL* in the current work, a set of experiments were devised and a correlation between CAL* and the gas phase ozone concentration of the form CAL*(mol/L) = 0. 0456 CO 3 (g/m 3 NTP) was obtained at 20 °C. This work has also revealed that t-butanol did not only inhibit hydroxyl radical reactions but also increased mass transfer due to it increasing the specific surface area (aL). Values of the aL were determined to be 2. 7 and 3. 5 m 2 /m 3 in the absence and presence of t-butanol respectively. It was noticed that the volumetric mass transfer coefficient (kLa) has increased following the addition of t-butanol. Ozone decomposition was studied at pH values of 2 to 9 in a 500 mL reactor initially saturated with ozone. Ozone decomposition was found to follow a second order reaction at pH values less than 7 whilst it was first order at pH 9. When the t-butanol was added, the decomposition of ozone progressed at a lower reaction order of 1. 5 for pH values less than 7 and at the same order without t-butanol at pH 9. Ozone decomposition was found significant at high pHs due to high hydroxide ion concentration, which promotes ozone decomposition at high pHs. The reaction rate constant (k) of RO 16 ozonation in the absence of t-butanol was determined. The result suggests that RO 16 degradation occurs solely by molecular ozone and indirect reactions by radicals are insignificant. The chemical reaction of triclocarban with ozone was found to follow second order reaction kinetics. The degradation of naphthalene using the liquid/gas-ozone (LGO) system was studied. This result showed that hydroxyl radicals seemed to have limited effect on naphthalene degradation which was also observed when a radical scavenger (t-butanol) was used. Reaction rate constants were calculated and were found around 100 times higher than values reported in the literature due to differences in experimental conditions. From the results of the experimental investigation on the degradation of methanol by ozone {{it was found that the}} rate constant (k) of the degradation reaction increased at pH 9. The reaction stoichiometry was found to have a value of 1 mol/mol. The two steps of the liquid/solid-ozone (LSO) system were studied on beds of silica gel and a zeolitic material (D 915) and the ozone adsorption process was modeled and found that particle rate controls ozone adsorption step but liquid rate controls the <b>water</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>step.</b> Ozone desorption with pure deionised water was studied. The water flow rate was found to accelerate the desorption rates but pH was found to decrease the desorption rates. In contrast, the effect of pH was insignificant in the presence of t-butanol. Determination of the adsorption isotherms for RO 16, naphthalene and methanol revealed that RO 16 did not exhibit adsorption on silica gel, but both naphthalene and methanol showed adsorption on D 915 described by Langmuir model.

40|$|A {{member of}} the solanaceous family of plants, tomato is the eighth most {{economically}} important agricultural product, and the fourth most economically important crop worldwide with around 164 million tonnes produced yearly. Europe dominates the highest yielding production systems, with the UK being the third highest yielding producer worldwide. Much of the modern day British production uses soilless systems housed in glasshouses. Glasshouses allow for greater control over the environmental factors that affect production, from pests and diseases, to temperature fluctuation and water scarcity. Using a soilless system adds to the control the grower has over the crop production, being able to adjust water and nutrient supply as and when needed. However, due to environmental impacts and high costs, it is becoming common to use a recirculating water system, rather than systems where the water runs to waste. With this closed system approach, issues arise regarding the recirculation, {{and the potential for}} rapid dispersal of potentially pathogenic organisms amongst whole crops. This can have obviously devastating effects upon grower’s production and therefore it is now common place for growers to incorporate a <b>water</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>step</b> to remove such organisms or at least reduce their abundance. In this research, microbial populations were monitored at separate points throughout commercial tomato production systems, at quarterly time points throughout the season. The populations were assessed by means of a small scale microarray, developed to contain probes targeting organisms commonly associated with commercially grown tomato rhizospheres. Five commercial nurseries were monitored through the season, each featuring contrasting water treatment systems; pSSF (part slow sand filter), fSSF (full slow sand filter), heat treated, UV treated and a final nursery that was instead an open system using a RTW (run to waste) method. Nurseries each supplied five water sample sets from separate sampling points throughout the loops, as well as a set of root samples at each quarterly sampling point. On top of this, five more nurseries supplied root samples at two time points. The first aim of the research was to monitor the population changes as the water passes through each system loop, including a pre and post treatment sample. The second aim of the research was to monitor the microbial population changes associated with the roots of each system throughout the season and build a base of knowledge of the common trends and features of the population through the year and if the treatments affected this. The final research aim was to develop and validate a range of qPCR assays for four commonly detected pathogens; Colletotrichum coccodes, Plectospharella cucumerina, Pythium aphanidermatum and Pythium myriotylum. Many differences were demonstrated in the water samples throughout the various systems. The RTW system exhibited the lowest species richness of them all, whilst the fSSF exhibited the highest. In each system, peak species richness was usually found in either the slab solution samples or from the pre-treatment samples. From the species diversity scores, all treatments seemed to result in a reduction in diversity following treatment, and upon further inspection both pSSF and fSSF systems exhibited a significant difference. Throughout the season, two bacterial species Nitrospira and Pseudomonas were commonly detected as well as a range of Pythia species. From the root observations, again the Pythia were very common, as was Nitrospira, Pseudomonas, Xanthomonas and Erwinia. These were common across the five main nurseries as well as the additional nurseries. Most systems throughout the season showed a general decline in abundance of species towards the end. Again, the fSSF system scored the highest species richness, whilst the heat treated nursery featured the lowest species richness. In the RTW system, two crops were grown, a crop on non-grafted roots, and another on a grafted rootstock. It was found that over the season the grafted roots, despite starting with higher species richness, had a reduced organism number on their roots, and also in the water. Finally, for the q-PCR assays developed, both the C. coccodes and the P. cucumerina assays were successfully validated and tested and showed positive results, whilst the P. aphanidermatum and P. myriotylum assays also showed promising results in their preliminary tests. Unfortunately the latter two assays could not be tested further due to time constraints. From the findings of this research it was realised {{that it is important to}} use the microarray in conjunction with other techniques, and that the microarray should not be used alone to infer causality. As well as this, organisms such as Pythia were found to be consistently prevalent, across systems, sample types and the season. Further research should be carried out to characterise their habits and develop methods to effectively reduce their prevalence throughout the season. On top of this, samples from the system utilising the fSSF water treatment system generally yielded the highest species richness over the season whilst the pSSF seemed more effective at reducing this number. Little is known about the way in which SSF systems work, in terms of if they are a physical treatment or biological, and these results emphasise their complex attributes. Further research is needed into the organisms that may inhabit the filters, and whether potentially pathogenic species will remain dormant in them between seasons...|$|E

40|$|Polyfluorinated {{chemicals}} (PFCs), especially short chain fluorinated alkyl sulfonates and carboxylates, are ubiquitously {{found in}} the environment. This chapter aims at giving an overview of PFC concentrations found in European surface, ground- and drinking waters and their behavior during conventional <b>water</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>steps.</b> Main PFC sources to the aquatic environment are municipal and industrial wastewater treatment plants. Treated landfill leachates also showed {{to be an important}} source of PFCs to surface waters. Existing data suggest central and south European rivers to have higher concentrations and mass discharges of PFCs than Northern European countries. However, this conclusion might be an artifact due to differences of monitoring activities in different regions. High PFC levels in groundwater are often restricted to some contaminated areas, e. g., due to illegal waste deposition on agricultural land or in the vicinity of a fluoropolymer producing factory. Sites with former fire-fighting activities are also potential "hot spot" areas. Concentrations encountered in drinking water remain fairly low on average. Typical concentrations are in the low ng/L range with the exception of highly contaminated areas, like in the Möhne and Ruhr area in Germany. The encountered concentrations in drinking water depend on the treatment technologies used to purify the water. Drinking water prepared with activated carbon or reverse osmosis will in general contain lower concentrations in tap water than in the raw water.

40|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{environmental}} compounds of concern, e. g. pharmaceuticals or illicit drugs, are acids or bases that may predominantly be present as charged species in drinking water sources. These charged micropollutants may prove difficult to remove by currently used <b>water</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>steps</b> (e. g. UV/H 2 O 2, activated carbon (AC) or membranes). We studied the sorption affinity of some ionic organic compounds to both AC and different charged polymeric materials. Ion-exchange polymers may be effective as additional extraction phases in <b>water</b> <b>treatment,</b> because sorption of all charged compounds to oppositely charged polymers was stronger than to AC, especially for the double-charged cation metformin. Tested below 1 % of the polymer ion-exchange capacity, the sorption affinity of charged micropollutants is nonlinear and depends on {{the composition of the}} aqueous medium. Whereas oppositely charged electrolytes do not impact sorption of organic ions, equally charged electrolytes do influence sorption indicating ion-exchange (IE) to be the main sorption mechanism. For the tested polymers, a tenfold increased salt concentration lowered the IE-sorption affinity by a factor two. Different electrolytes affect IE with organic ions in a similar way as inorganic ions on IE-resins, and no clear differences in this trend were observed between the sulphonated and the carboxylated cation-exchanger. Sorption of organic cations is five fold less in Ca 2 + solutions compared to similar concentrations of Na+, while that of anionic compounds is three fold weaker in SO 42 - solutions compared to equal concentrations of Cl-.

40|$|Conventional {{coagulation}} is not {{an effective}} treatment option to remove natural organic matter (NOM) in water with high alkalinity/pH. For this type of water, enhanced coagulation is currently proposed {{as one of the}} available treatment options and is implemented by acidifying the raw water and applying increased doses of hydrolyzing coagulants. Both of these methods have some disadvantages such as increasing the corrosive tendency of water and increasing cost of treatment. In this paper, an improved version of enhanced coagulation through coagulant optimization to treat this kind of water is demonstrated. A novel coagulant, a composite polyaluminum chloride (HPAC), was developed with both the advantages of polyaluminum chloride (PACl) and the additive coagulant aids: PACl contains significant amounts of highly charged and stable polynuclear aluminum hydrolysis products, which is less affected by the pH of the raw water than traditional coagulants (alum and ferric salts); the additives can enhance both the charge neutralization and bridging abilities of PACl. HPAC exhibited 30 % more efficiency than alum and ferric salts in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) removal and was very effective in turbidity removal. This result was confirmed by pilot-scale testing, where particles and organic matter were removed synergistically with HPAC as coagulant by sequential <b>water</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>steps</b> including pre-ozonation, coagulation, flotation and sand filtration.

40|$|Swimming pools are {{traditionally}} disinfected with a residual disinfectant such as sodium hypochlorite. Nowadays, swimming water without a residual disinfectant is increasingly popular, {{as can be}} seen by the growing number of (natural) swimming ponds (Weilandt 2015), but health risks for bathers do raise concerns for these type of pools, so some form of disinfection is needed (Giampaoli et al. 2014). The combination of ultra-filtration and UV-disinfection for pool <b>water</b> <b>treatment,</b> without a residual disinfectant might be an interesting alternative. The Dutch Innovative Pool project (DIPool) was initiated to explore this new treatment concept, to study its applicability for swimming pools and to verify first system design specifications. The goals of this study were to compare the microbial <b>water</b> quality during <b>treatment</b> without disinfection, treatment with ultra-filtration, treatment with UV-disinfection, treatment with chlorination, and the influence of single <b>treatment</b> <b>steps.</b> Methods All <b>treatment</b> concepts were studied in a pilot plant equipped with a pool basin and simulated bathing load, containing only chemical components. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and intact cell count measurements were used to monitor the microbial water quality before and after each <b>treatment</b> <b>step</b> at regular intervals in several experiments during 23 days of operation. High pollutant/nutrient conditions without recirculation were used to study the effect of single <b>treatment</b> <b>steps,</b> and recirculation conditions were used to study the effect of accumulation of pollutants/nutrients. A chlorinated pilot plant was used as reference for the alternative disinfection. The influence of a biological activated carbon filtration during chlorinated conditions was also investigated. Both pilot plants were operated at 1 m 3 /h, with a turnover time of 30 minutes during the recirculation conditions. Results The results showed that the microbial quality of pool water with UV-disinfection was similar to that of chlorinated pool water, while pool <b>water</b> <b>treatment</b> without disinfection resulted in a higher microbial number. After 23 days, most of the results during chlorination and UV-disinfection experiments with recirculation were within 103 - 105 intact cells/mL and 0. 2 - 13 ng intracellular ATP /L which is similar to both bottled and tap <b>water.</b> <b>Treatment</b> <b>steps</b> with the highest reduction in microbial quality were ultrafiltration (UF) in the treatment setup with UV-disinfection and chlorination in the treatment setup with chlorination. The largest increase in microbial quality was observed during residence in the pool basin, which was obvious, and during biological activated carbon filtration. Most important conclusions were that i) the microbial water quality of pool water with a UV-based treatment can be similar to that of pool water with chlorination ii) UF {{plays an important role in}} maintaining a low number of micro-organisms during UV-based treatment and iii) P-limitation is an additional method to limit microbial growth in swimming pool water. <br/...|$|R

Therefore the aeration can be reduced to such a level that mixing is ensured. A final set of simulations showed that prolonged ammonium loads can be dealt with by reducing the influent flow rate. The amount of reduction depends of the operating temperature and influent ammonium concentration.

40|$|Introduction: D-tagatose is {{a natural}} low-calorie bulk {{sweetener}} (1. 5 kcal/g) showing 92 % of the sweetness of sucrose. It is low glycaemic, non-cariogenic and has prebiotic properties. Besides this wide range of healthy benefits, D-tagatose can also be applied as flavour enhancer and flavour creator in many applications. Tagatose significantly reduces the lingering sweetness and the bitter and metallic off-flavour of high intensity sweeteners. The natural occurrence of D-tagatose is however too limited for the increasing interest in this alternative sweetener. Chemical production of D-tagatose from D-galactose is economically not feasible due to byproduct formation and complex waste <b>water</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>steps.</b> A biocatalysed process using an immobilised L-arabinose isomerase enzyme for galactose isomerisation is therefore part of this study. Materials and methods: A wild type L-arabinose isomerase from Geobacillus stearothermophilus is used as enzyme source for bioconversion of D-galactose to D-tagatose with Escherichia coli (BL 21) strain as expression host. Cells are harvested from culture broth by centrifugation and are resuspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7) or ringer solution. Different biomass concentrations are immobilised with 5 % v/v alginate in a 1 / 1 biomass/alginate volumetric ratio. Biomass concentration is varied between 1. 3 and 6. 5 %. Batch conversion experiments are performed in a thermostatic shaking bath at 60 °C. Bead concentration is varied between 10 and 30 %. A galactose solution of 360 g/l is used as substrate, containing 1 mM MnCl 2 as co-factor at pH 7. Samples are analysed by HPLC with refractive index detection. Results and discussion: Tagatose production increases with a higher biomass concentration immobilised in alginate. By varying the biomass concentration from 1. 3 to 6. 5 % at a bead concentration of 20 %, the tagatose concentration obtained after 24 hours increases from 27 to 65 g/l. The increase in tagatose production is however not linearly correlated to the biomass concentration. A similar conclusion can be drawn for {{the influence of the}} bead concentration. At a biomass concentration of 3. 3 % w/v, tagatose concentration increases from 29 to 56 g/l for an increase in bead concentration of 10 to 30 %. No significant influence of the diluent of the biomass is noticed on tagatose production. What’s innovative: An enzymatic bioprocess is developed and optimised for production of D-tagatose from D-galactose. Besides the unique benefits of tagatose for many food applications (low caloric value, low glycaemic, non-cariogenic and prebiotic properties, less lingering artificial sweetener aftertaste), the application of an L-arabinose isomerase for production of D-tagatose results in a highly selective and environmentally friendly production process, which is not yet available on the current industrial market. As sugar substitute, tagatose will help to control weight, tooth decay and will be a major help in comfort of diabetics. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|In most of {{the cases}} caused by natural {{emergencies}} like earthquakes, flooding or tsunamis the public supply with electricity, drinking water and waste water breaks down. The public transportation system and the road-and path network will also collapse in a defined area. Especially in less developed countries, in which the public infrastructure is not build up that good anyway, this leads to a high health risk for the affected people because the access to safe drinking water is even more limited. This leads to the point that people drink water from unsafe origins like ponds and rivers. The German federal forces invented the so called common dosage plan to treat water from any contaminated water source (no salt water) to a safe, physical harmless drinking water. The system is based on different <b>water</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>steps,</b> namely flocculation, chlorination and activated carbon filtration. It is a large scale technical process and needs electrical power to run the pumps, stirrers, valves and controls. A group of scientist has adopted this large scale process and developed it to a currentless and simple to operate process, which can be used after natural catastrophes by the affected people. The author of this work was part of a drinking water helping team after the terrible Tsunami 2005. The team operated the drinking water supply for about 1000 refugees in a special tent camp. These experiences in the field work in Sri Lanka 2005 lead to the present work During the field work in Sri Lanka the so called sloping hose process was used. This process is based on the CDP and uses high amounts and concentrations of the treatment chemicals. Especially by the use of the chlorine tablets based on the waterfree disinfectant sodiumdichoroisocyanurate there were negative experiences during the field tests. In summary this was: - Rejection of the treated raw water by the affected people because of the high doses of <b>water</b> <b>treatment</b> the drinking <b>water</b> had a strong chemical smell and also a not common taste. This smell and taste was misinterpreted by the people because they thought the water could be toxic. - Production of high concentration of Trihalomethanes and other water soluble organic halogenated compounds due to the tablet additives of the used chlorine tables - The compounds sodium- and calciumhypochlorite belong to the dangerous goods due to the regulations of the international air transport association and therefore {{it is not possible to}} transport these compounds by air for a quick drinking water help action within the first three days after such a catastrophe. Therefore in this work, which was restricted to the investigation of stipulated German products due to the German emergency water legislation, namely the three compounds sodiumhypochlorite (NaOCl), calciumhypochlorite (Ca(OCl) 2) and sodiumdichloroicocyanurate (NaCl 2 (CNO) 3) as waterfree compound or as dihydrate were compared as the only in Germany permitted disinfectants by measuring their efficiency during the chlorination of so called “worst case water”. This water quality was defined by the highest German Technical Drinking Water Authority (DVGW) as the effluent of a municipal waste water plant with at least 300. 000 inhabitants and is the worst water quality, which could be used for the drinking water supply as raw water in emergencies. All experiments were carried out as simple batch experiments. Additional a special chlorine-producing anodic oxidation device (diamond electrode) was tested...|$|R
40|$|We have {{performed}} a systematic {{variation of the}} wet chemical oxidation and the subsequent oxide etching steps during the cleaning of Czochralski CZ single crystalline silicon wafers prior to surface passivation. The optimization of these preconditioning steps was carried out on saw damage etched or textured Si wafers subsequently passivated by amorphous silicon nitride a SiNx H or chemical passivation by an iodine ethanol I E solution. Measuring the carrier lifetime using the spatially resolved microwave detected photoconductance decay, we monitored {{the impact of the}} wet chemical surface conditioning on the surface morphology and wafer base doping type. For damage etched surfaces in alkaline potassium oxide solutions and passivated by iodine ethanol, an optimum surface passivation is obtained by omitting the last water rinse as used in the standard clean and adding a hot <b>water</b> <b>treatment</b> as final <b>step</b> in the cleaning procedure. While this results was found for both p type and n type wafers, suggesting that the passivation mechanism is based on the saturation of dangling bonds, a strong dependence on the doping type was observed for the passivation by a SiNx H. Prior to passivation by a SiNx H, the best preconditioning for n type was achieved by adding a hot <b>water</b> <b>treatment</b> and subsequent etching of the oxide by hydrofluoric acid HF. For p type however, no improvement was achieved with respect to the standard cleaning step. This dependency on the base doping type could be attributed to the passivation mechanism of a SiNx H based on the field effect. By employing ammonium fluoride as final etching solution instead HF, followed by hot <b>water</b> <b>treatment,</b> compared to the standard treatment, an improvement of the lifetime can be observed for both surface structures, indicating that the surface micro roughness can be reduced and the contamination can be remove...|$|R
