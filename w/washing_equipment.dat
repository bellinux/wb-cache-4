40|$|Abstract. Cast {{iron and}} steel rolls used in the {{continuous}} pickling line must be changed frequently because the continuous acid <b>wash</b> <b>equipment</b> induces wear on the roll surface in a short period. The damage portions are usually repaired by using the flame spray coating. Recently, ceramics materials are planed to be introduced to prevent the damage because of their high abrasion and corrosion resistances. In this study new roll structure is considered where a ceramics sleeve is connected with steel shafts at both ends by shrink fitting. Here, the ceramics sleeve may provide a longer lifetime and reduces the cost for the maintenance. However, attention should {{be paid to the}} maximum tensile stresses appearing between the ceramics sleeve, spacer rings and steel shafts because the fracture toughness, plasticity and fatigue strengths of ceramics are extremely lower than the values of steel. In this study, finite element method analysis is applied to the new structure, and the maximum tensile stress and stress amplitude have been investigated with varying the dimensions of the structure. Fatigue strengths of ceramics are also considered under several geometrical conditions...|$|R

A backflow preventer is also important when potentially toxic chemicals are used, for instance for commercial/industrial descaling of boilers, or when chemical bleaches are used for residential power washing.|$|E
