5|$|Another Green World was {{recorded}} at Island Studios in London {{during the months}} of July and August 1975. Brian Eno originally viewed his new album as an experiment and entered the recording studio with nothing written or prepared beforehand. For the first four days in the studio, Eno failed to be productive. To look for new ideas, Eno turned to his instructional cards, the Oblique Strategies, and began coming up <b>with</b> <b>new</b> <b>ideas</b> {{as he did with}} his previous album Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy).|$|E
5|$|As the game's {{dialogue}} {{consists of}} a lot of wordplay and misunderstandings, Smith would analyze scenes before writing them: he would see what the scenes were trying to accomplish, and where the beats in them were. After he had the structure of a scene in his head, he would write it; at times he was able {{to make use of the}} original Japanese dialogue, but most of the time he had to come up <b>with</b> <b>new</b> <b>ideas</b> himself. At several points, the English wordplay was inspired by the wordplay in the Japanese version. At some points, it was not possible to do wordplay in the same places as in the Japanese version, so Smith would change the structure of the scene slightly. At other points, Smith came up with a joke or funny line, and changed the scene to make the joke work. Around half of the jokes were rewritten based on the characters present in the scene, rather than being translations of the Japanese jokes.|$|E

25|$|The {{city was}} in an uproar over {{political}} and religious controversies, and the competitive system where professors were dependent on attracting student fees for income meant that the university was riven with argumentative feuds and conflicts.

25|$|Dylan demoed some of {{the songs}} in the studio, {{something}} he rarely did. Members of Dylan's touring band were involved in these sessions. Dylan also used these loose, informal sessions to experiment <b>with</b> <b>new</b> <b>ideas</b> and arrangements. Dylan continued rewriting lyrics until January 1997, when the official album sessions began. It was the second collaboration between Dylan and Lanois, who had previously produced Dylan's 1989 release Oh Mercy and {{was known for his}} work with artists such as Emmylou Harris (on Wrecking Ball) and U2 (on The Joshua Tree and Achtung Baby).|$|E

25|$|The {{pedagogy}} of post-structuralism {{is marked}} by an attempt to redefine rhetoric {{as it relates to}} composition, drawing on post-modern ideology calling for new ideas in a modern world. For example, Victor Vitanza suggests that writing is an entity of its own, existing apart from institutions, social mores, and even writers. He believes that the intention of writing should be to infect the reader <b>with</b> <b>new</b> <b>ideas</b> that disrupt the rational, controlled world. Vitanza also notes that writing {{can be seen as a}} metadiscipline, as rhetoric applies to any field in which the artist attempts to convey a message, including photography and choreography, as writing is a performative and not authoritative act. Sharon Crowley views rhetoric as invention and discovery by identifying the available means of persuasion in making one’s argument. Furthermore, Crowley believes rhetoric has a civic purpose, as it changes the society in which it is engaged; she attests that rhetoric is the art of giving effectiveness to truth, and notes that it is persuasive and always moving.|$|E
25|$|Scholars now tend {{to agree}} that modern Chinese {{literature}} did not erupt suddenly in the New Culture Movement (1917–23). Instead, they trace its origins {{back at least to}} the late Qing period (1895–1911). The late Qing was a period of intellectual ferment sparked by a sense of national crisis. Intellectuals began to seek solutions to China's problems outside of its own tradition. They translated works of Western expository writing and literature, which enthralled readers <b>with</b> <b>new</b> <b>ideas</b> and opened up windows onto new exotic cultures. Most outstanding were the translations of Yan Fu (严复) (1864–1921) and Lin Shu (林纾) (1852–1924). In this climate, a boom in the writing of fiction occurred, especially after the 1905 abolition of the civil service examination when literati struggled to fill new social and cultural roles for themselves. Stylistically, this fiction shows signs of both the Chinese novelistic tradition and Western narrative modes. In subject matter, it is strikingly concerned with the contemporary: social problems, historical upheaval, changing ethical values, etc. In this sense, late Qing fiction is modern. Important novelists of the period include Wu Woyao (吴沃尧) (1866–1910), Li Boyuan (李伯元) (1867–1906), Liu E (刘鹗) (1857–1909), and Zeng Pu (曾朴) (1872–1935).|$|E
25|$|Tatsuro Udo, battle {{programmer}} for Eternia, Rebirth and Graces, {{helped design}} the battle system. During {{the beginning of}} development, the team had to recreate the basic gameplay from the Xillia games to work off, which proved a difficult task for the team. The battle system was intended to combine familiar elements from previous installments <b>with</b> <b>new</b> <b>ideas</b> intended to refresh the series. Creating the seamless transition between exploration and combat, as well as implementing Armitization, proved to {{be difficult for the}} team. The idea of encountering and fighting enemies in the same space as exploration was designed to help evoke a fresh sense of adventure for players, as the team felt the previous method of transferring to a separate battle arena was limiting the series' development. Until the battle system's completion, development of other systems related to it was slow. As part of this development, a completely new engine had to be developed for the game, rather than just modified their old engine {{as they did in the}} past. Because of a staff shortage, developing the game was harder than previous titles and took a longer time. The PlayStation 3 was chosen as the original platform of release as the next generation of gaming hardware had yet to take off in Japan in terms of sales, and Bandai Namco was unwilling to take the risk of releasing on platforms with low install bases.|$|E

She says the continual reinvention is [...] "liberating" [...] herself, which she has been drawn to since childhood. Gaga has a coloratura contralto vocal range and strongly dislikes lip syncing. She has changed her vocal style regularly, similar to Madonna and Gwen Stefani, and considers Born This Way [...] "much more vocally up to par with what I've always been capable of." [...] In summing up her voice, Entertainment Weekly wrote: [...] "There's an immense emotional intelligence behind the way she uses her voice. Almost never does she overwhelm a song with her vocal ability, recognizing instead that artistry {{is to be found}} in nuance rather than lung power." ...|$|E

However, Stegall questioned why Massive Dynamic would build a machine known to be the destroyer of mankind. IGN columnist Ramsey Isler praised the writing staff because [...] "just when you think they might be stuck in old habits, they come up <b>with</b> <b>new</b> <b>ideas</b> and put a whole new perspective on old storylines and characters." [...] Isler continued that while [...] "'Reciprocity'" [...] isn't the most groundbreaking episode in the series, it does try a number of new ideas, and it gives us one big new plot point that could change the tone {{of the rest of the}} season." ...|$|E
500|$|As the Basketmaker III people {{improved}} their farming techniques during the 8th century, the well-watered {{areas of the}} San Juan Basin became densely populated. Greater crop yields necessitated the construction of above-ground storage facilities, which were the first large-scale construction projects in the region. Fagan identifies this {{as the beginning of}} the first pueblos, [...] "ushering in a period of profound social tension, population movements, and political change." [...] In his opinion, [...] "by 800, there was no going back. The people of Chaco and elsewhere were locked completely into economies based on maize and bean cultivation." [...] Archeologists refer to the period starting [...] as the Pueblo I Period. By the early 10th century the large pit-house settlements had been supplanted by modular construction that later served as the foundation for the Ancestral Puebloan great houses. This marks the beginning of the Bonito Phase. During the 10th century, Chaco's population was swelled by a steady influx of immigrants from the San Juan River, approximately [...] north. Fagan notes, [...] "Within a few centuries, as rainfall became more irregular and life less predictable, the Chacoans embarked on a cultural trajectory that melded ancient traditions <b>with</b> <b>new</b> <b>ideas</b> that were to crystalize into a brilliant and short-lived Southwestern society." ...|$|E

500|$|Calling {{the show}} a [...] "theatrical {{multimedia}} spectacular", Madonna wanted a huge stage {{with a central}} platform from which {{a flight of stairs}} descended. The central [...] platform was flanked by two lower platforms, which housed the band and the musicians. A large video screen was suspended above the stairs, which descended during the show. Two projectors were situated {{at the front of the}} stage, which projected images of The Pope and President Ronald Reagan during the show. Patrick Leonard, who had produced True Blue, joined as the musical director for the shows. Instead of following every note on the records, Leonard encouraged the musicians to come up <b>with</b> <b>new</b> <b>ideas</b> for the songs. Hence a number of the old songs were rearranged, including introducing a medley of [...] "Dress You Up", [...] "Material Girl" [...] and [...] "Like a Virgin"—which contained a sample from the Four Tops song [...] "I Can't Help Myself (Sugar Pie Honey Bunch)". American choreographer Shabba Doo was signed to choreograph the show. 13-year-old Christopher Finch was signed to play the part of the small boy from the [...] "Open Your Heart" [...] video, since Felix Howard, who played the original part, did not get a working license, and hence could not join the tour. Madonna wanted three backup singers, a team of male dancers and a succession of costume changes. She took inputs from her then husband, actor Sean Penn saying, [...] "I really respect Sean's opinion. He has great taste and is a very brilliant man. When I was putting my tour together, it was always in the back of my mind: 'I wonder what Sean will think of this?' He's extremely opinionated and has really high standards, and that sometimes pushed me into making decisions I wouldn't have otherwise made." [...] The title [...] "Who's That Girl Tour" [...] came to Madonna's mind during rehearsals one-day when she looked at a gigantic image of herself, projected on a screen on the stage. She commented, ...|$|E
500|$|The {{stage was}} as huge as {{a tennis court}} and was made movable. Above the stage was a vast {{electrical}} grid, composed of truss sections, chain motors, electrical cables and the control devices that linked electronically or mechanically with the performances happening below. Four gigantic video monitors formed {{the backdrop of the}} stage. Other equipment included a mechanical bull and equipment for aerial movements. The sets were built in sections by three companies. A permanent crew of around hundred was hired. Monitor mixing was handled by four monitor engineers, with two of them for Madonna's monitors. Blake Suib, one of the engineers, commented that Madonna was a perfectionist and she knew when a sound, coming from the speakers, sounded bad or good during rehearsals. By the suggestion of music director Pat Leonard, they tried out using 14kHz of sound frequency in their live speakers, which was unusual to use at that point of time. Also they {{came up with the idea}} of using isolated amplifiers to pick up the sound of the instruments individually. Suib commented that [...] "the creative process of coming up <b>with</b> <b>new</b> <b>ideas,</b> implementing them, and then soberly evaluating their results was time-consuming but worth it." [...] The poster and the logo for the tour was developed by Chase Design Group. They wanted to make the logo as much aesthetic as possible. They developed a custom icon and logo type to convey the unique and ethereal qualities of Madonna's show, which was described by the group's founder Margo Chase as [...] "a multilayered musical and spiritual journey through diverse worlds." [...] Chase commented that since [...] "Madonna is a student of Kabbalah, she requested that we include references to that body of knowledge." [...] The resulting logo and poster included both Arabic and Hebrew references. A number of designs were prepared by Chase and the one ultimately chosen by Madonna made it to the main poster of the show, which featured Madonna's face-shot from the [...] "What It Feels Like for a Girl" [...] video shots.|$|E
