5|$|Without the cost-sharing subsidies, the {{government}} estimated that premiums would increase by 20 percent to 30 percent for silver plans. In 2017, the uncertainty {{about whether the}} payments would continue caused Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina to try to raise premiums by 22.9 percent the next year, {{as opposed to an}} increase of only 8.8 percent that it would have sought if the payments <b>were</b> <b>assured.</b>|$|E
5|$|As soon as Bahadur Shah came to {{know about}} his brother's death, he sent men to {{retrieve}} the corpse. They were attacked by Wala-Jah, but Wala-Jah fainted and died. Around 8 o'clock in the evening, Bahadur Shah's aide, Rustam Dil Khan, mounted the dead prince's elephant, beheaded the prince, {{and made his way}} to Bahadur Shah. However, instead of praises, he received reproaches for his action. His elephant was followed by two other elephants; the first one contained the dead body of Ali Tabar, the other one carried the dead princes' women, who <b>were</b> <b>assured</b> protection by Bahadur Shah.|$|E

25|$|The {{algorithm}} maintains two values, alpha and beta, {{which represent}} the minimum score that the maximizing player <b>is</b> <b>assured</b> of and the maximum score that the minimizing player <b>is</b> <b>assured</b> of respectively. Initially alpha is negative infinity and beta is positive infinity, i.e. both players start with their worst possible score. It can happen that {{when choosing a}} certain branch of a certain node the maximum score that the minimizing player <b>is</b> <b>assured</b> of becomes less than the minimum score that the maximizing player <b>is</b> <b>assured</b> of (beta <= alpha). If this is the case, the parent node should not choose this node, because it will make the score for the parent node worse. Therefore, the other branches of the node {{do not have to}} be explored.|$|R

5|$|Many Muslims {{considered}} this unexpected victory a proof {{that they had}} been favored by God and believed they <b>were</b> <b>assured</b> such victories in the future. A number of the leading tribesmen of Quraysh had been killed at Badr and so leadership passed to Abu Sufyan. He forbade the mourning of the losses at Badr, for he was eager to exact revenge upon Muhammad, vowing to conduct a retaliatory raid on the city of Medina. Several months later, Abu Sufyan accompanied a party of 200 men to the city, obtaining temporary residence with the chief of the Jewish tribe Banu Nadir and learning more of the current situation in Medina. He and his party then left Medina, burning down two houses and laying waste to some fields in fulfillment of his vow. Further skirmishes between the Meccans and the Muslims would occur thereafter.|$|E
5|$|The crew {{negotiated}} a truce, {{under the terms}} of which the Malagasy undertook to spare the lives of the surviving crew members. In exchange it was agreed that Meermin would return to Madagascar, where the Malagasy would be released. But gambling on the Malagasy's ignorance of navigation, the wounded Muller instead ordered his crew to head for the coast of southern Africa. After making landfall at Struisbaai, in the Cape Colony, which the Malagasy <b>were</b> <b>assured</b> was their homeland, 50–70 of them went ashore. Their intention was to signal to the others still on board Meermin if it was safe for them to follow, but the shore party soon found themselves confronted by a militia of farmers formed in response to Meermins arrival; the farmers had understood that as the ship was flying no flags, it was in distress.|$|E
5|$|Two French frigates {{were lost}} at Tamatave, taking {{the number of}} frigates lost by the French Navy during the {{campaign}} to ten. The defeat {{marked the end of}} the campaign and the end of French hopes of seriously disrupting British trade with India: the only remaining safe harbours in the region were a few Dutch colonies on Java, which became the next target of the Royal Navy forces in the region. The Mauritius campaign also had an effect on British post-war strategy in the Indian Ocean, demonstrated by the retention of Mauritius as a colony. Bourbon was returned to France in 1814 after Napoleon's abdication. With strategic bases placed along their trade routes, British convoys <b>were</b> <b>assured</b> a greater degree of safety and the Royal Navy provided with the infrastructure to operate worldwide.|$|E

5|$|In 1960, Johnson, {{as leader}} of the Women's Suffrage Movement, and Eugenia Lockhart, the organization's secretary, went to London to plead the case for suffrage. They met with the London branch of the International Alliance of Women to discuss the {{situation}} in the Bahamas, claiming that though they had the support of the majority of Bahamian women, many women could not voice their approval because they were employed by merchants and the government who were opposed to the cause. They also sought an audience at the Colonial Office to air their grievances, accompanied by the chairman of the PLP, Henry Milton Taylor. They met with the Secretary of State for the Colonies, Iain Macleod, and two women British Parliamentarians, Baroness Joan Vickers and Baroness Eirene White. The Bahamians <b>were</b> <b>assured</b> that their case was accepted and that change would soon follow. They returned, but no change was forthcoming.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Dennis Wise, ex-Chelsea and England player, became caretaker, and {{subsequently}} permanent player-manager, of the club. In {{his first season}} in charge Wise led the club to the first FA Cup Final in their history. When Millwall took to the field at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff they were only the second team from outside the top flight {{to play in the}} Cup final since 1982, and were the first team from outside the Premier League to reach the final since the foundation of the top tier in 1992. The club was missing 16 players from their squad due to suspension or injury. They played the Cup final on 22 May 2004, losing 3–0 to Manchester United. As United had already qualified for the UEFA Champions League, Millwall <b>were</b> <b>assured</b> of playing in the UEFA Cup. Midfielder Curtis Weston, substituted for Wise with one minute of normal time remaining, became the youngest Cup final player in history at 17 years 119 days, beating the 125-year-old record of James F. M. Prinsep. In the 2004–05 UEFA Cup, Millwall lost 4–2 on aggregate in the first round proper to Hungarian champions Ferencváros, with Wise scoring both Millwall's goals.|$|E
5|$|What was {{ultimately}} {{included in the}} constitution was a modified form of this plan. In the Grand Committee, Benjamin Franklin successfully proposed the requirement that revenue bills originate in the house. But the final July 16 vote on the compromise still left the Senate looking like the Confederation Congress. In the preceding weeks of debate, Madison, King, and Gouverneur Morris each vigorously opposed the compromise for this reason. Then on July 23, just before most of the convention's work was referred to the Committee of Detail, Morris and King moved that state representatives in the Senate be given individual votes, rather than voting en bloc, as {{they had in the}} Confederation Congress. Oliver Ellsworth of Connecticut, a leading proponent of the compromise, supported their motion, and the Convention adopted it. As the personally powerful senators were to receive terms much longer than the state legislators who appointed them, they became substantially independent. The compromise nonetheless continued to serve the self-interest of small-state political leaders, who <b>were</b> <b>assured</b> of access to more seats in the Senate than they might otherwise have obtained.|$|E

5|$|Robert Campbell was {{appointed}} by a 13-man sub-committee to be the club's first secretary-manager from a shortlist of 30applicants. Secretarial duties were carried out by committee member Whyte, with Campbell's role more on the playing side. The committee assembled a squad {{at the cost of}} £917 10s 0d. Their first game was a 2–0 defeat away at Grimsby Town on 1 September 1903, and first home game was six days later against Gainsborough Trinity, played in front of a crowd of 11,000 including the Lord Mayor and Lady Mayoress of Bradford. It was not until the third game against Burton United that the club recorded their first victory, {{on the way to a}} 10th-placefinish in Division Two. The club faced having to apply for re-election in their second season, until five wins in the final six games lifted the club to eighth position. In November 1905, Peter O'Rourke, one of the club's centre-halves, {{was appointed}} manager, with his last game as a player coming the following month. He guided City to finishes of 11th and fifth and then earned promotion to Division One in 1907–08. The season had started with an 8–1 victory over Chesterfield and included another six victories when City scored five goals or more, before promotion and then the title <b>were</b> <b>assured</b> with successive victories over Derby County and Burnley in April.|$|E
