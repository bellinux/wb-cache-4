Their National League luck was short-lived too, as they lost to Nottinghamshire and Essex on successive <b>week-ends,</b> leaving them precariously placed before their last match of the season - which would be a virtual play-off match against Lancashire. First, however, they drew with Essex in the Championship, before National League relegation was a fact thanks to a 75-run loss to Lancashire.|$|E

25|$|The report {{published}} in December 2008 {{assumed that the}} total number of passenger journeys would be 150,000 per annum, each paying £3.15 per journey. It also assumed that no one would use the line at <b>week-ends,</b> even though it runs via the successful tourist attractions of the National Forest. This equates to an assumption that just over 300 return journeys would be made daily and only during the week, yet according to the latest travel-to-work plans, some 4000–6000 car journeys occur daily on the Coalville to Leicester corridor and 6000–8000 per day from the south. Thus, about 12,000 car journeys takes place along part or all the rail track; it is not considered credible that only 2.5% would be attracted on to the train. That led to a widespread belief that the report's economic assumptions were wrong.|$|E
25|$|In summertime village cricket is {{the delight}} of everyone. Nearly every village has its own cricket field where the young men play and the old men watch. In the village of Lintz in County Durham {{they have their own}} ground, where they have played these last 70 years. They tend it well. The wicket area is well rolled and mown. The outfield is kept short. It has a good club house for the players and seats for the onlookers. The village team play there on Saturdays and Sundays. They belong to a league, {{competing}} with the neighbouring villages. On other evenings after work they practise while the light lasts. Yet now after these 70 years a judge of the High Court has ordered that they must not play there any more. He has issued an injunction to stop them. He has done it at the instance of a newcomer who is no lover of cricket. This newcomer has built, or has had built for him, a house {{on the edge of the}} cricket ground which four years ago was a field where cattle grazed. The animals did not mind the cricket. But now this adjoining field has been turned into a housing estate. The newcomer bought one of the houses on the edge of the cricket ground. No doubt the open space was a selling point. Now he complains that when a batsman hits a six the ball has been known to land in his garden or on or near his house. His wife has got so upset about it that they always go out at <b>week-ends.</b> They do not go into the garden when cricket is being played. They say that this is intolerable. So they asked the judge to stop the cricket being played. And the judge, much against his will, has felt that he must order the cricket to be stopped: with the consequence, I suppose, that the Lintz Cricket Club will disappear. The cricket ground will be turned to some other use. I expect for more houses or a factory. The young men will turn to other things instead of cricket. The whole village will be much the poorer. And all this because of a newcomer who has just bought a house there next to the cricket ground.|$|E

2500|$|So {{that the}} distractions {{of a busy}} life should not {{interfere}} with Head's introspective analysis, {{it was decided that}} the experimentation should take place in Rivers's rooms. Here, as Head states, [...] "for five happy years we worked together on <b>week-ends</b> and holidays in the quiet atmosphere of his rooms at St. John's College." [...] In the normal course of events, Head would travel to Cambridge on Saturday, after spending several hours on the outpatient department of the London Hospital. On these occasions, however, he would find that he was simply too exhausted to work on the Saturday evening so experimentation would have to be withheld until the Sunday. If, therefore, a long series of tests were to be carried out, Head would come to Cambridge on the Friday, returning to London on Monday morning. At some points, usually during Rivers's vacation period, longer periods could be devoted to the observations. Between the date of the operation and their last sitting on 13 December 1907, 167days were devoted to the investigation.|$|E

60|$|The {{invention}} of <b>Week-Ends</b> is a feat of the English social genius dating since long after my stay of twenty-odd years ago.

It is the time when, if you have friends within reasonable, or even unreasonable reach of London, you are asked down. Science has ascertained that in this interval of fifty or sixty hours no one can do anything, and that the time had better be frankly given up to pleasure.|$|E
