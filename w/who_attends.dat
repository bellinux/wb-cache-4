5|$|Warring Capulets (Michael Toland) and Montagues (Stephen Goldberg), {{portrayed as}} Steller and California sea lions respectively, have their feud watched sadly by Capulet's only daughter, Juliet (Patricia Trippett). A {{fight on the}} shore is ended when the Prince (Phil Nibbelink), a large and monstrous {{elephant}} seal, appears and warns the two groups that, should there be any more disturbance, the seal who caused it shall be exiled to Shark Island, a fin shaped rock where a shark lives. Romeo (Daniel Tripett), Montague's only son, is depressed, wishing {{to fall in love}} with someone. His humorous friend, Mercutio (Chip Albers), urges him and another of his friends, Benvolio (Sam Gold), to go to a Capulet party later that evening. They attend the party, covered in white sand to look like Capulets, and Romeo falls in love with Juliet at first sight. Juliet, however, was promised by her father to marry the Prince, <b>who</b> <b>attends</b> the party. Romeo and his friends manage to wreak havoc, and are revealed to be Montagues. Later that evening, the play's balcony scene is recreated on a cliff on the beach where a tree grows. Romeo promises Juliet that they shall marry the next morning, and she will not have to marry the Prince.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{characteristics}} and school readiness of children with disabilities <b>who</b> <b>attend</b> Head Start programs, as well as the characteristics of the programs they attend and the school districts in which they receive special education. In addition, a second purpose was to determine whether there are differences in these characteristics of children <b>who</b> <b>attend</b> Head Start programs and those <b>who</b> <b>attend</b> other early childhood education programs. I used data from the Pre-Elementary Education Longitudinal Study, a study of a nationally representative sample of preschool children with disabilities. I used a subsample of the data to compare the characteristics and school readiness of children with disabilities <b>who</b> <b>attended</b> Head Start to those <b>who</b> <b>attended</b> other early childhood education programs using chi-squares, analysis of variance, and ordinary least squares regression analyses. The results suggest that there is no difference in the school readiness of children with disabilities <b>who</b> <b>attended</b> Head Start and those <b>who</b> <b>attend</b> programs in elementary schools. However, in comparison to children <b>who</b> <b>attended</b> other programs, children with developmental delays <b>who</b> <b>attended</b> Head Start had more advanced receptive language skills and those with other disabilities had less advanced pre-reading skills. Additionally, the results of this study show that there is some variation in the characteristics of children with disabilities <b>who</b> <b>attend</b> Head Start and those <b>who</b> <b>attend</b> other programs. Children <b>who</b> <b>attended</b> Head Start were more likely to be Black or Hispanic and from low socioeconomic families. They were also less likely to have disabilities other than speech impairments or developmental delays and, on average, received fewer special education services. Finally, children <b>who</b> <b>attended</b> Head Start were more likely to be from rural school districts and districts with higher rates of poverty. These findings indicate that children with disabilities <b>who</b> <b>attend</b> Head Start programs face additional risk factors that are associated with poor school readiness and emphasize the need to ensure that the programs provide services that are adequate to meet the needs of the diverse population they serve and to prepare those children for the onset of formal schooling...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to analyze {{selected}} demographic characteristics of students <b>who</b> <b>attended</b> programming board events at a medium size, four-year, public institution located in the upper Midwest to determine if statistically significant differences were present between attendees and the full-time undergraduate population. The study tested for: (a) significant differences in the demographic characteristics of full-time undergraduate students <b>who</b> <b>attended</b> one or more programming board events versus fulltime undergraduate students <b>who</b> did not <b>attend</b> programming board events, (b) significant differences in the demographic characteristics of students <b>who</b> <b>attended</b> more than one programming board event versus those <b>who</b> <b>attended</b> only one event and (c) significant differences in the demographic characteristics of students <b>who</b> <b>attended</b> only entertainment events verses those students <b>who</b> <b>attended</b> only educational events.

The students <b>who</b> <b>attended</b> the combined course achieved considerably higher results on both tests compared to the students <b>who</b> <b>attended</b> the traditional course.

25|$|The present Eritrean Jewish {{community}} {{is believed to}} be started by Yemenite Jews from Yemen attracted by new commercial opportunities driven by Italian colonial expansion in the late 19th Century. The Jewish population then later increased from European refugees coming to Eritrea to escape the anti-Semitic regimes in Europe at the time. Many returned to Israel in 1948. During British administration, Eritrea was often used as a location of exile for Irgun and Lehi guerrillas. Among those imprisoned was future Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Shamir and Haim Corfu, a founder of Beitar Jerusalem. In 1961 the Eritrean War of Independence began after Eritrea was annexed by Ethiopia. It was then that Jews began to leave Eritrea. In the early 1970s, Jewish emigration increased because of ensuing violence between Eritrea and Ethiopia (up to and beyond Eritrea's official declaration of independence in 1993). Judaism {{is not one of the}} four religions recognized by the Eritrean government and indeed, as of 2006 there was only one last native Jew left in Eritrea - Sami Cohen, <b>who</b> <b>attends</b> to the Asmara Synagogue and cemetery.|$|E
