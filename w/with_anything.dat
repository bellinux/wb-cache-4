5|$|Charged leptons {{can combine}} with other {{particles}} to form various composite particles such as atoms and positronium. The electron governs {{nearly all of}} chemistry, as it is found in atoms and is directly tied to all chemical properties. Neutrinos rarely interact <b>with</b> <b>anything,</b> and are consequently rarely observed. Neutrinos stream throughout the Universe but rarely interact with normal matter.|$|E

5|$|From the start, Habré {{isolated}} {{himself from}} {{the other members of}} the GUNT, which he treated with disdain. Habré's hostility for Libya's influence in Chad united itself with his ambition and ruthlessness: observers concluded that the warlord would never be content <b>with</b> <b>anything</b> short of the highest office. It was thought that sooner or later an armed confrontation between Habré and the pro-Libyan factions would take place, and more importantly, between Habré and Goukouni.|$|E
5|$|Tea is {{the second}} most {{consumed}} beverage in the world, after water. Argo was founded in response to a realization that Americans had so few tea offerings that they generally were unfamiliar <b>with</b> <b>anything</b> but bagged teas. At the time, most tea retailers either supplied bulk tea for home brewing or traditional sit-down service, but Argo focused on premium specialty drinks in paper cups. Meanwhile, a minority of Asian immigrants from countries such as India, Vietnam and China where tea is the national beverage were spreading some of their traditions. Argo endeavored to emphasize the healthy aspects of tea as an alternative to coffee. When it was founded, Argo was part of a field of blossoming tea cafe franchises meeting a burgeoning demand. By 2002, there were 1,100 tearooms with sit-down service. In 2003, retail sales of tea totaled $5.1billion, and in 2005, as the specialty tea market was growing 20percent per year, the total retail tea market was expected to surpass $10 billion by 2010.|$|E
5|$|The team {{decides to}} try a {{different}} location on the planet, {{in the hope of}} moving away from the sentience they believe to be in the forest. They find that the fear emanations can be felt at their new camp as well, which is in a grassland, which makes them realize that the sentience extends over all of the vegetation on the planet. Osden also realizes that this sentience has never been in contact <b>with</b> <b>anything</b> alien before; thus it experienced fear when the explorers landed. Osden decides to attempt to communicate with the sentience, with the help of Tomiko and two others. They land {{in the middle of a}} forest, where a surge in the fear response kills one of them. Osden leaves the group, and by surrendering to the fear completely makes the planet understand that they mean it no harm; and the fear emanations cease. The group tries to locate Osden, but is unable to find him; Tomiko suspects that he does not want to be found. They leave him enough provisions for the rest of his life, and return to Terra after finishing the survey.|$|E

25|$|The {{traditional}} smelter was a bole, a large fire {{built on}} a hill and relying on wind power. It functioned best with large pieces of rich ore known as bing and could not deal <b>with</b> <b>anything</b> small enough to pass through a half-inch mesh riddle. The bole smelter therefore resulted in large amounts of ore accumulating on waste heaps. It required two days of strong wind and could only function when the conditions were favourable.|$|E
25|$|Spinoza’s second {{knowledge}} involves reasoning plus emotions.

An example of this could be anything that is classified as being of imperfect virtue. Imperfect virtues are seen as those which are incomplete. Many philosophers, such as Thomas Aquinas and Aristotle, would compare imperfect virtue to pagan virtue.|$|E

25|$|His highest score, coincidentally, was 30 in both {{forms of}} the game.
