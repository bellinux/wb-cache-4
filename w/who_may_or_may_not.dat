5|$|As {{the files}} {{converge}} {{on the east}} frieze we encounter the first women celebrants E2–27, E50–51, E53–63. The priestesses carry the sacrificial instruments and paraphernalia including the phiale (phial or jug), oinochoai (wine jars), thymiaterion (incense burner), {{and in the case}} of E50–51, evidently they have just handed the marshal E49 a kanoun, making the girl the kanephoros. The next groups E18–23, E43–46, are problematic. Six on the left and four on the right, if one does not count two other figures <b>who</b> <b>may</b> <b>or</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> be marshals, then this group might be taken to be the ten eponymous heroes who gave their names to the ten tribes. Their proximity to the deities indicates their importance, but selecting differently, then nine of them may be the archons of the polis or athlothetai officials who managed the procession; there is insufficient iconographic evidence to determine which interpretation is correct.|$|E

40|$|This {{volume of}} To Improve the Academy begins with essays {{examining}} {{different groups of}} faculty within our institutions. We clustered these together because each spotlights a special group of faculty. One danger in {{institutions of higher learning}} is that the term 2 ̆ 2 community 2 ̆ 2 may be misused. It could be restricted to an academic department that must get along by reason of budgets, proximity of offices, or shared parking lots. Or the term could be a convenient designation for a group of people sharing a category-such as the 2 ̆ 2 research faculty. 2 ̆ 2 Or it could be used to disguise problems within or between campus groups. Authors of each of the articles in this section identify a group of individuals <b>who</b> <b>may</b> <b>or</b> <b>may</b> be members of only a superficial community. In each case, the essays exemplify the role faculty development can play in assisting individuals to become truly members of the academic community...|$|R

40|$|Background Alcohol is {{a leading}} risk factor for avoidable disease burden. Research {{suggests}} that a drinker's social network can play an integral role in addressing hazardous (i. e., high-risk) or problem drinking. Often however, social networks do not have adequate mental health literacy (i. e., knowledge about mental health problems, like problem drinking, or how to treat them). This is a concern as the response that a drinker receives from their social network can have a substantial impact on their willingness to seek help. This paper describes the development of mental health first aid guidelines that inform community members on how to help someone <b>who</b> <b>may</b> have, <b>or</b> <b>may</b> be developing, a drinking problem (i. e., alcohol abuse or dependence). Methods A systematic review of the research and lay literature was conducted to develop a 285 -item survey containing strategies on how to help someone <b>who</b> <b>may</b> have, <b>or</b> <b>may</b> be developing, a drinking problem. Two panels of experts (consumers/carers and clinicians) individually rated survey items, using a Delphi process. Surveys were completed online or via postal mail. Participants were 99 consumers, carers and clinicians with experience or expertise in problem drinking from Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Items that reached consensus on importance were retained and written into guidelines. Results The overall response rate across all three rounds was 68. 7...|$|R

50|$|One of {{the primary}} reasons for {{performing}} arthroscopies is to repair or trim a painful and torn or damaged meniscus. The surgery is known as an arthroscopic partial meniscectomy (APM).

Some professional societies still support the use of arthroscopic partial meniscectomy for meniscal tears, but after evaluating the entire body of evidence, an independent international panel without free from conflicts of interest made a strong recommendation against arthroscopic partial meniscectomy in nearly all patients.
