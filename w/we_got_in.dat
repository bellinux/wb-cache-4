500|$|In 2003, one of Sesame Street's {{international}} co-productions, Takalani Sesame, {{caused some}} {{controversy in the}} US when the first HIV-positive Muppet, Kami, was created in response to South Africa's AIDS epidemic. It {{marked the first time}} AIDS and the goal of confronting the disease's stigma was included in a preschool curriculum. According to the documentary, The World According to Sesame Street, the reaction of many in the US surprised Sesame Workshop. Some members of Congress attacked Sesame Street, Sesame Workshop, and PBS. According to co-producer Naila Farouky, [...] "The reaction <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>in</b> the US blew me away. I didn't expect people to be so horrible... and hateful and mean". The controversy in the US was short-lived, and died down when the public discovered the facts about the South African co-production, and when United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan and prominent minister and conservative political commentator Jerry Falwell praised the Workshop's efforts. Kami went on to be named UNICEF's Champion for Children in November 2003.|$|E
500|$|Although {{there had}} been stress and {{conflict}} during the recording of other Chili Peppers albums, the Mother's Milk sessions were uncomfortable due to Beinhorn's incessant desire to create a hit. He recalled {{that he and the}} band were at odds: [...] "Suffice to say that I had a very intense personal relationship [...] and somewhere along the line I fell out with [...]" [...] Beinhorn constantly clashed with Frusciante over guitar effects. According to Kiedis, [...] " [...] wanted John to have a big, crunching, almost metal-sounding guitar tone whereas before we always had some interesting acid-rock guitar tones as well as a lot of slinky, sexy, funky guitar tones." [...] Frusciante was frustrated with the producer's attitude and ultimately resented his playing on the record, feeling it was too [...] "macho". Kiedis recalled that, in the end, [...] "I couldn't tolerate his direction any longer. He was trying to squeeze something out of me that I wasn't feeling, and <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>in</b> a fight and I knew that I was done with him." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2001 the Workshop {{introduced}} Sesame English, {{a series}} focused on teaching {{children and their}} families the basics of the English language and on familiarizing them with some aspects of American culture. As of 2009 it aired in several countries, including Japan, Korea, and Italy. In 2003, in response to the epidemic of AIDS in South Africa, the co-producers of Takalani Sesame included the first preschool AIDS/HIV curriculum. They created the first HIV-positive Muppet, Kami, to confront the stigma of HIV and AIDS in South Africa. According to the documentary The World According to Sesame Street, the reaction of many in the US surprised Sesame Workshop. Some members of Congress attacked Sesame Street, Sesame Workshop (previously, the CTW), and PBS. According to co-producer Naila Farouky, [...] "The reaction <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>in</b> the US blew me away. I didn't expect people to be so horrible... and hateful and mean". The controversy in the US was short-lived, and died down when the public discovered the facts about the South African co-production, and when UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan and American televangelist and conservative activist Jerry Falwell praised the Workshop's efforts.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} several negative reviews. Andrew Billen, writing for The Times, lamented that Davies had [...] "forgotten that Doctor Who's main {{task is to}} send children scuttling behind sofas while entertaining their fathers with the odd philosophical idea, the occasional classical reference, a joke or two they would probably not wish to explain and a wee bit of space totty". Billen also criticised the writing and acting, but commended Tate for a [...] "toned down performance". Alan Stanley Blair of SyFy Portal summarised it as [...] "a runaway Saturday morning cartoon in desperate need to a solid story". Blair found flaws with the comedy and the music in the episode, but was impressed with Tate's acting and Piper's cameo. Kevin O'Sullivan of the Sunday Mirror criticised Tate and Tennant for overacting, and had concerns about the writing: [...] "It didn't exactly ooze tension. All <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>in</b> the way of terrifying space enemies was Sarah Lancashire hamming it up as an intergalactic super nanny, a couple of security guards with guns and lots of cute little fat babies." [...] Ian Hyland of News of the World criticised the child-friendly storyline, comparing it to [...] "the back of a fag packet". He also criticised Tennant for appearing [...] "jaded" [...] and Tate for [...] "still shouting".|$|E

2500|$|In {{revising}} Ivory's {{draft of}} the script, Guadagnino took out {{a considerable amount of}} nudity. He described Ivory's version as [...] "a much more costly [...] different film" [...] which could not have been made because of [...] "market realities." [...] In 2016, Ivory stepped down from directing to avoid conflicts, leaving Guadagnino to direct the film alone. [...] "It would be awkward," [...] Ivory said, [...] "to have two directors working together. It might take longer, it would look terrible if <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>in</b> fights on the set, and so on." [...] Ivory subsequently sold the rights to the screenplay to Guadagnino's company.|$|E

2500|$|Perhaps {{the best}} {{endorsement}} made of Cosgrave, {{came from his}} old rival Éamon de Valera, with whom he was reconciled before his death. De Valera, once in 1932 and later close to his own death, made two major comments. To an interviewer, when asked what was his biggest mistake, he said without a pause, [...] "not accepting the Treaty". To his own son, Vivion, weeks after taking power in 1932 and reading the files on the actions of Cosgrave's governments in relation to its work in the Commonwealth, he said of Cosgrave and Cosgrave's ministers [...] "when <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>in</b> and saw the files[...] [...] they did a magnificent job, Viv. They did a magnificent job." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, {{there is}} a view that while {{it is likely that}} the Germans were expecting an attack somewhere on the French shoreline, {{evidence}} of expectation of an attack at Dieppe in particular, at that particular time, is less conclusive. [...] Proponents of this view point out that elements of the Canadian forces, such as at Green beach, landed without trouble. [...] Lt Col Merrit has been quoted as saying 'How could the Germans have known if <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>in</b> on our beach against defences which were unmanned?' [...] No 4 Commando's troops also reported that they achieved surprise against the gun batteries they were tasked with destroying. [...] Under this view, the statements by German POWs that the raid was fully expected are explained as being propaganda.|$|E
2500|$|Also in 2002 {{they were}} invited by ABC's Radio National to {{represent}} Australia at the European Broadcasting Union's International Folk Festival in Hamburg. Lucas recalled [...] "e {{were a bit}} different… {{it was kind of}} scary, but it was really good. We got a really good response. <b>We</b> <b>got</b> <b>in</b> the local paper. We got to meet the Mayor of Hamburg town. We couldn’t understand what he was saying to us, and he couldn’t understand us either, so we had a great time". During the following year they performed at various Australian festivals and at venues across the country. A proposed appearance at the 2003 Shanghai Spring International Music Festival in May was postponed to the following year due to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak. They toured southern China and were broadcast by radio stations based in Shanghai.|$|E

2500|$|Remarkably, Bore {{found the}} middle of the bat time and again, and when the last over started, another 14 runs were needed. Stephen Booth bowled the first ball of the season's last over and Bore scored a boundary. [...] The second ball went to the ropes again, and the third went for two runs. [...] Nottinghamshire needed four more runs from three balls to {{complete}} a remarkable win. Bore blocked the fourth ball and Andy Pick, Nottinghamshire's number 11, walked down the pitch to ask [...] "What did you do that for?" [...] "It wasn't in the right place." [...] Bore replied. The next delivery saw Bore launch a blow towards the stands. [...] The crowd and the entire Nottingham team were on their feet and Bore thought, as soon as he'd hit it, [...] "That's it, we've won". However Somerset's Richard Ollis ran in and caught the ball above his head, just ten feet from the boundary. [...] Nottinghamshire had lost by three runs and Bore's innings had been in vain. [...] As Bore related in an interview with Simon Lister [...] "We were stunned. <b>We</b> <b>got</b> <b>in</b> the car and I don't think we spoke a word until we were well past Gloucester. No matter how many times I lie in bed and replay that ball I never score those four runs".|$|E
2500|$|After the game, Lyle Blackwood {{criticized the}} referee's ruling of Freddie Solomon's fumble as an {{incomplete}} pass. [...] "You don't want {{the game to}} hinge on that play, but you never know," [...] Blackwood said. [...] "I could have taken the ball up the sideline. That's a 14-point swing." [...] However, other Dolphins were not convinced. [...] "We were dominated {{to the point where}} one play didn't make much of a difference," [...] said Dolphins coach Don Shula. [...] "Our major objective was to contain Montana, and we did a terrible, terrible job of it," [...] added defensive coach Chuck Studley. Even Reggie Roby, who averaged only 39.3 yards per punt and didn't place any of his 6 punts inside the 20, took some responsibility for the loss. [...] "I was trying to kill the ball, and I kicked it bad," [...] he said. [...] "I didn't hit one well. I was scared – scared to make a mistake. It was the worst game of my life, counting high school, college, counting everything." [...] Meanwhile, in the 49ers' locker room, Joe Montana had his own explanation for the win. [...] "As far as my own game, well, I'd have to admit it was pretty close to the best I've ever played. I didn't throw anything I didn't have confidence in. <b>We</b> <b>got</b> <b>in</b> sort of a groove. Once you get going like that you gain confidence, and it carries over to the defense, and then back to the offense. It's a snowball kind of thing." ...|$|E
2500|$|On Sunday, November 21, {{a hunting}} party of about 15 {{people were in}} a cabin on this private land. [...] Terry Willers, {{one of the two}} co-owners of the land, left the cabin and saw Vang sitting in a deer stand. He used a {{handheld}} radio to ask the people still in the cabin whether or not anyone should be in the stand. Upon receiving a response in the negative, he approached Vang and told him to leave the property. Vang then apologized and started moving south towards a trail through a forested area of the property. According to Terry Willer's testimony, [...] "As Bob got back on the radio and asked me where he was at and I said, uh, he's heading south down on the food plot right now. I radioed in to the cabin that I had a tree-rat and I had chased him off." [...] At that point five of the hunters from the cabin who had heard the radio message arrived at the tree stand. Lauren Hesebeck a surviving victim stated, [...] "Bob had said I'm going to go talk to him to find out who he is, why he's there, and make sure he doesn't, you know, knows that he's on private property and that he's not welcomed there. Denny had said to me this ought to be interesting, let's go and see what's going on. <b>We</b> <b>got</b> <b>in</b> the back of it standing up (ATV), hanging on the rear bar."After following the directions given by Willers, they proceeded to approach Vang further down the trail. Crotteau then suggested making a note of his hunting license number to make a report to the DNR and, according to Hesebeck's testimony, Crotteau [...] "flipped over the hunting tag on Vang's back to get his license number".|$|E
