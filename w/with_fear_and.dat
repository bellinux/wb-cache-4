5|$|It is, as an Upanishad, {{a part of}} {{the corpus}} of Vedanta {{literature}} that presents the philosophical concepts of Hinduism. The Varaha Upanishad emphasizes that liberation from sorrow and fear requires a human being to know the non-dualistic nature of existence, oneness between Self, Brahman and Vishnu, and the role of Yoga in self-liberation, and lists ten Yamas (virtues) as essential to a liberation of one's soul: nonviolence, satya, asteya, brahmacharya, compassion, rectitude, kshama, non-hypocrisy, mitahara, and shaucha. The text describes the Jivanmukta as one whose inner state, amongst other things, is neither affected by happiness nor by suffering inflicted on him, who does not shrink out of fear from the world, nor the world shrinks from him <b>with</b> <b>fear,</b> <b>and</b> whose sense of calm and inner contentment is free from anger, fear, and joy toward others.|$|E
5|$|The video {{opens in}} a deserted, {{destroyed}} school hallway with Lee's character shown {{sitting on the}} ground. As the first verse begins, he slowly begins {{to stand up and}} makes his way through the hallway. The boy then sees a female teacher in a classroom who's stricken <b>with</b> <b>fear</b> <b>and</b> closes the door, realizing that the boy is the cause of the damage. As the boy makes his way outside the school building, a police car arrives and the teacher rushes outside to tell the policeman about the boy, who then quickly rides a bicycle home to pack his things. While at home, he sees a news report about the incident, causing him to quickly gather his things to flee. Several policemen then appear outside {{the front door of the}} boy's house, while he tries to escape through the back door. The boy realizes that the door is locked so he uses his telekinetic powers to grab the keys from the kitchen bench. The policemen then enter the house to find that the boy has escaped, but find a teddy bear and a plush frog floating in the air. The final scene shows the boy running away from a SWAT team in the woods. The boy is caught by one of the men who pushes him to the ground. The video ends with the boy using his supernatural powers once again to push the men away in a burst of power; this references how the boy destroyed the school in the first place, as he's in the same position he was in at the beginning of the video. The aftermath of the outburst in the end, however, remains unknown.|$|E

25|$|Humans are {{a social}} species {{with a long}} history of living in tribal groups. The {{psychological}} mechanisms that evolved to handle the complexities of group living have also created heuristics for quickly categorizing others as ingroup or outgroup members, with different behavioral strategies for each: treat ingroup members (those in one’s own group) favorably, and react to outgroup members (those who belong to a different group) <b>with</b> <b>fear</b> <b>and</b> aggression. These tendencies arise with little motivation, and have been provoked over superficial groups in lab studies—for example, by showing paintings to participants and creating groups based on which painting participants prefer. Ingroup and outgroup preferences have also been observed in other social primates, such as the rhesus macaque.|$|E
25|$|In 1353, Kantakouzenos {{was still}} hopeful that peace would be maintained, {{but in that}} year, John V {{launched}} a military attack on Matthew, thereby re-igniting the civil war. John V was demoted and exiled to the island of Tenedos, {{one of the few}} islands in the Aegean still under Byzantine control, while Kantakouzenos made his son Matthew co-emperor. John V would not give up so easy however, and in 1354 Ottoman troops began crossing over into Thrace in his support.

25|$|The {{amygdala}} {{is part of}} the {{limbic system}} which is related to fear cognition and emotional learning. Individuals with social anxiety disorder have been found to have a hypersensitive amygdala; for example in relation to social threat cues (e.g. perceived negative evaluation by another person), angry or hostile faces, and while waiting to give a speech. Recent research has also indicated that another area of the brain, the anterior cingulate cortex, which was already known {{to be involved in the}} experience of physical pain, also appears to be involved in the experience of 'social pain', for example perceiving group exclusion. A 2007 meta-analysis also found that individuals with social anxiety had hyperactiviation in the amygdala and insula areas which are frequently associated <b>with</b> <b>fear</b> <b>and</b> negative emotional processing.|$|E

25|$|If Charlie {{is uncomfortable}} with Nancy and her desires, he has bigger {{problems}} with the lizards. At first, he insists {{that they are a}} death hallucination caused by rotten liver paste sandwiches. While the creatures intrigue Nancy, Charlie continually acts <b>with</b> <b>fear</b> <b>and</b> resistance. He follows his wife's lead on posing submissively when the creatures first approach, but he will not respond to them until she orders him to. Even after the ice has been broken, Charlie remains uncertain about the creatures and their intentions. Leslie and Sarah's ignorance on many things (emotions, anatomy, etc.) adds to Charlie's negative attitude. When he has to explain these ideas to them, he is easily frustrated and often condescending. He drives Leslie to beat and choke him. Yet at the end, Charlie agrees with Nancy that the lizards have to stay on land and not go back into the water. Though he helps because Nancy will do it whether or not he agrees, Charlie does offer to take them by the hand.|$|E

500|$|The android {{character}} Bishop {{has been}} the subject of literary and philosophical analysis as a high-profile fictional android conforming to science fiction author Isaac Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics and as a model of a compliant, potentially self-aware machine.

This is seen as part of a larger trend of technophobia in films before the 1990s, with Bishop's role being particularly significant as he doubly proves his worth at the end of the film, thus confounding Ripley's expectations.|$|E

500|$|Fear and Desire was a {{commercial}} failure, but garnered several positive reviews upon release. Critics {{such as the}} reviewer from The New York Times believed that Kubrick's professionalism as a photographer shone through in the picture, and that he [...] "artistically caught glimpses of the grotesque attitudes of death, the wolfishness of hungry men, {{as well as their}} bestiality, and in one scene, the wracking effect of lust on a pitifully juvenile soldier and the pinioned girl he is guarding". Columbia University scholar Mark Van Doren was highly impressed by the scenes with the girl bound to the tree, remarking that it would live on as a [...] "beautiful, terrifying and weird" [...] sequence which illustrated Kubrick's immense talent and guaranteed his future success. [...] Kubrick himself later expressed embarrassment <b>with</b> <b>Fear</b> <b>and</b> Desire, however, and attempted over the years to keep prints of the film out of circulation.|$|E
500|$|In his {{biography}} of the author, Bare-Faced Messiah (1987), Russell Miller characterized Typewriter in the Sky as one of Hubbard's works which [...] "would come {{to be regarded as}} classics", along <b>with</b> <b>Fear</b> <b>and</b> Final Blackout. In a biography of Hubbard written by Kent State University professor Donald M. Hassler in The New Encyclopedia of Science Fiction (1988), he noted, [...] "Typewriter in the Sky (1940/1951), which anticipates plot gimmicks now popular among experimental metafictionists, ought to be taken seriously by the critics who will evaluate his strange genius". In a review upon the 1995 re-release of the book, Ann Patterson-Rabon of the Spartanburg Herald-Journal concluded: [...] "A short novel, 'Typewriter' is a perfect afternoon read: quick, fun and only as deep as you care to go." [...] Sandy Bauers of Knight News Service called the 1995 audio publication of the work [...] "swashbuckling fun".|$|E
500|$|The Age of Reason {{was largely}} ignored after 1820, except by radical groups in Britain and freethinkers in America, among them Robert G. Ingersoll and the American {{abolitionist}} Moncure Daniel Conway, who edited his works {{and wrote the}} first biography of Paine, favorably reviewed by The New York Times. Not until the publication of Charles Darwin's The Origin of Species in 1859, and the large-scale abandonment of the literal reading of the Bible that it caused in Britain, did many of Paine's ideas take hold. As writer Mark Twain said, [...] "It took a brave man before the Civil War to confess he had read the Age of Reason...I read it first when I was a cub pilot, read it <b>with</b> <b>fear</b> <b>and</b> hesitation, but marveling at its fearlessness and wonderful power." [...] Paine's criticisms of the church, the monarchy, and the aristocracy appear most clearly in Twain's A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (1889).|$|E

500|$|The Britten scholar Donald Mitchell has written, [...] "It is easy, {{because of}} the scope, stature, and sheer volume of the operas, and the wealth of vocal music of all kinds, to pay {{insufficient}} attention to the many works Britten wrote in other, specifically non-vocal genres." [...] Maw said of Britten, [...] "He {{is one of the}} 20th century's great orchestral composers... His orchestration has an individuality, incisiveness and integration with the musical material only achieved by the greatest composers." [...] Among Britten's best-known orchestral works are the Variations on a Theme of Frank Bridge (1937), the Sinfonia da Requiem (1940), the Four Sea Interludes (1945) and The Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra (1945). The Variations, an affectionate tribute to Britten's teacher, range from comic parodies of Italian operatic clichés and Viennese waltzes to a strutting march, reflecting the rise of militarism in Europe, and a Mahlerian funeral march; the piece ends with an exuberant fugal finale. The Sinfonia moves from an opening Lacrymosa filled <b>with</b> <b>fear</b> <b>and</b> lamentation to a fierce Dies irae and then to a final Requiem aeternam, described by the critic Herbert Glass as [...] "the most uneasy 'eternal rest' possible". Mason considers the Sinfonia a failure: [...] "less entertaining than usual, because its object is not principally to entertain but to express symphonically. It fails because it is neither picturesquely nor formally symphonic". The Sea Interludes, adapted by Britten from the full score of Peter Grimes, make a concert suite depicting the sea and the Borough in which the opera is set; the character of the music is strongly contrasted between [...] "Dawn", [...] "Sunday Morning", [...] "Moonlight" [...] and [...] "Storm". The commentator Howard Posner observes {{that there is not a}} bar in the interludes, no matter how beautiful, that is free of foreboding. The Young Person's Guide, based on a theme by Purcell, showcases the orchestra's individual sections and groups, and gained widespread popularity from the outset. Christopher Headington calls the work [...] "exuberant and uncomplicated music, scored with clarity and vigour [...] fits well into Britten's oeuvre." [...] David Matthews calls it [...] "a brilliant educational exercise." ...|$|E
