5|$|Eleanor also {{broke with}} {{tradition}} by inviting hundreds of African-American guests to the <b>White</b> <b>House.</b> When the black singer Marian Anderson was denied {{the use of}} Washington's Constitution Hall by the Daughters of the American Revolution in 1939, Eleanor resigned from the group in protest and helped arrange another concert {{on the steps of}} the Lincoln Memorial. Roosevelt later presented Anderson to the King and Queen of the United Kingdom after Anderson performed at a <b>White</b> <b>House</b> dinner. Roosevelt also arranged the appointment of African-American educator Mary McLeod Bethune, with whom she had struck up a friendship, as Director of the Division of Negro Affairs of the National Youth Administration. To avoid problems with the staff when Bethune would visit the <b>White</b> <b>House,</b> Eleanor would meet her at the gate, embrace her, and walk in with her arm-in-arm.|$|E
