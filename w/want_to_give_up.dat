5|$|On 27 April Model {{met with}} Hitler {{to review and}} express his concern for {{reconnaissance}} information which showed the Red Army constructing very strong positions at {{the shoulders of the}} salient and having withdrawn their mobile forces from the area west of Kursk. He argued that the longer the preparation phase continued, the less the operation could be justified. He recommended completely abandoning Citadel, allowing the army to await and defeat the coming Soviet offensive, or radically revising the plan for Citadel. Though in mid-April Manstein had considered the Citadel offensive profitable, by May he shared Model's misgivings. He asserted that the best course of action would be for the German forces to take the strategic defensive, ceding ground to allow the anticipated Soviet forces to extend themselves and allow the German panzer forces to counterattack in the type of fluid mobile battle at which they excelled. Convinced that the Red Army would deliver its main effort against Army Group South, he proposed to keep the left wing of the army group strong while moving the right wing back in stages to the Dnieper River, followed by a counterattack against the flank of the Red Army advance. The counteroffensive would continue until the Sea of Azov was reached and the Soviet forces were cut off. Hitler rejected this idea; he did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> so much terrain, even temporarily.|$|E
25|$|When Shunryu {{had first}} come to Zoun-in, eight other boys were {{studying}} there. By 1918, {{he was the}} only one who stayed. This made his life a bit tougher with So-on, who had more time to scrutinize him. During this period Suzuki wanted to leave Zoun-in but equally didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up.</b>|$|E
25|$|According to the Soviet law of 29 November 1939, all {{residents}} of the annexed area, referred to as citizens of former Poland, automatically acquired the Soviet citizenship. Residents were still required and pressured to consent and those who opted out (most Poles did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> the Polish citizenship) were threatened with repatriation to Nazi controlled territories of Poland.|$|E

25|$|The Iranian {{authorities}} {{assert that}} they cannot simply trust the United States or Europe to provide Iran with nuclear energy fuel, {{and point to}} {{a long series of}} agreements, contracts and treaty obligations which were not fulfilled.

25|$|In 1976 {{the groups}} {{struggled}} on {{allocation of funds}} among the Oklahoma and Florida tribes. Based on early 20th-century population records, at which time {{most of the people}} were full-blood, the Seminole Tribe of Oklahoma was to receive three-quarters of the judgment and the Florida peoples one-quarter. The Miccosukee and allied Traditionals filed suit against the settlement in 1976 to refuse the money; they did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> their claim for return of lands in Florida.|$|E
25|$|On November 29, 2012, a House {{subcommittee}} met {{to consider}} replacing the dollar bill. This action took {{place after the}} seventh Government Accountability Office report on the subject. The latest report claimed that switching to dollar coins would save $4.4 billion over thirty years. However, according to polls, few Americans <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> dollar bills. Recent budgets passed by Congress have included provisions to prevent the Treasury Department from spending any of its funds to redesign the one dollar bill, largely because of potential cost impacts on the vending machine industry.|$|E

25|$|Burnside {{dispatched}} some cavalry reinforcements to Rosecrans {{and made}} preparations for {{an expedition to}} clear the roads and gaps from East Tennessee to Virginia and if possible secure the saltworks beyond Abingdon. During this time, the Battle of Chickamauga loomed, and frantic requests from Washington, D.C., to move south and reinforce Rosecrans were effectively ignored by Burnside, who did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> his newly occupied territory and its loyal citizens. Furthermore, Burnside was encountering difficulties in moving supplies through the rugged territory and was concerned that if he moved even farther from his supply base, he might get into serious difficulty.|$|E
25|$|Eddie Gard {{had been}} {{contacted}} by Salvatore Sollazzo, {{the man responsible}} for operating the point shaving scandals at several New York City schools between the late 1940s and 1951 (City College of New York, Manhattan College, New York University and Long Island University). Sollazzo was a 45-year-old jeweler and gambler who had spent five years in prison during the 1930s. Gard's family was poor and he did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> a steady income of cash, which amounted to $1,000 per player per thrown game. The original LIU players involved were Gard, Bigos and Feurtado. Eventually White and LeRoy Smith joined.|$|E
25|$|The pilot {{aired on}} June 11, 1987, but NBC {{had decided not}} to pick up the series even before it was shown. Tartikoff didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> on the show, though, and made a deal with the Disney Channel to air {{thirteen}} episodes of the series in prime time. If the initial order did well, Disney was prepared to order an additional seven-seven. The show was completely retooled, with Mills the sole remaining cast member from the pilot. Miss Bliss's class was changed from the sixth grade to the eight grade, and the kids would be more central to the story.|$|E

25|$|During {{early summer}} 2002, Rosa {{suddenly}} laid down work. As an artist {{he could not}} live under the conditions Egmont was offering him, {{but he did not}} <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> making Scrooge McDuck comics either. So, his only choice was to go on hiatus and try to come to an agreement with Egmont. His main issues were that he had no control over his works. Rosa had discovered too often that his stories were printed with incorrect pages of art, improper colors, poor lettering, or pixelated computer conversions of the illustrations. Another matter was that his name was used in promotion of books and collections of stories without his agreement and without sending royalties to him. Rosa has never, as with any other Disney artist, received royalties for a single use of any of his stories worldwide.|$|E
25|$|Hart's {{imminent}} move to WCW {{created a}} tense situation, {{as he had}} won the WWF World Heavyweight Championship at SummerSlam 1997 from The Undertaker. Hart's WCW contract was scheduled to begin on December 5, {{one month after the}} WWF's annual Survivor Series event, which was to be held in Montreal. Shawn Michaels, the leader of the emerging stable D-Generation X had been booked into a main event title match with Hart. McMahon, anxious for Hart to give up the title, sought Hart's consent to job to Michaels. Hart didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> the title to a member of The Kliq (which included Michaels, Kevin Nash, Scott Hall, Hunter Hearst Helmsley and Sean Waltman), apparently standing up {{for the rest of the}} locker room. As part of their rivalry storyline, Michaels had repeatedly performed acts insulting the Canadian flag and Canadian fans, which had also upset Hart. Wrestling fans also knew of Hart's long-standing personal difficulty with Michaels—Hart had been angered at Michaels' forfeiture of the WWF World Heavyweight Championship in February 1997, which ruined plans for a Hart–Michaels rematch at WrestleMania 13 where Michaels was expected to lose the title to him. Hart also believed that Michaels had faked a knee injury and talked about major surgery just to get out of their planned match. While Michaels denied rumors that he did not want to lose to Hart, and indeed Hart wound up winning the title shortly after Michaels relinquished it, Hart felt certain that Michaels would not have offered a loss in return if he had been staying with the WWF. The two had been involved in a real fight after Michaels implied that Hart was having an affair with WWF valet Sunny. The recent storyline rivalry had also seen Michaels make insulting remarks about Hart's father Stu Hart, which had left Bret and others in the Hart family upset. McMahon's offering of an estimated $3 million contract to Hart in 1996 had reportedly also upset Michaels.|$|E

500|$|Inspired by {{an event}} in The Simpsons writer Mike Reiss' childhood, young Bart does not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> {{sleeping}} in the crib {{to make way for}} his newborn sister. Noticing Bart's affection for Krusty the Clown but unable to afford a professionally built Krusty-themed bed, Homer decides to build a bed with Krusty's likeness to please his son. However, because of Homer's poor handicraft skills, the bed takes on an ominous appearance and frightens Bart, especially in the darkened room. In his first night in the new bed, far from [...] "laughing himself to sleep", Bart imagines that the face on the headboard of the bed comes to life, intoning with evil glee, [...] "if you should die before you wake...", before collapsing into evil cackling.|$|E
500|$|The {{funeral for}} Storm {{and his mother}} was at Oakvale Congregational Church, Broadgreen, on 19 October 1972. Mourners sang Storm's {{favourite}} song, [...] "You'll Never Walk Alone". The two coffins were carried from the hearse to the cremation (at Anfield Crematorium) by former band members. Storm's remains were scattered on section 23 at Anfield Crematorium's Gardens of Remembrance. When Starr was asked why he did not attend, he said, [...] "I wasn't there when he was born either." [...] Although Starr had often offered to arrange for Storm to record whenever he wanted to, Storm was not interested in finding new or original material. His sister said: [...] "He [...] was happy to be the King of Liverpool—he was never keen on touring, he didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> running for the Pembroke Harriers ... and he'd never miss a Liverpool football match!" ...|$|E
500|$|On 21 October, {{soldiers}} again attacked an army {{barracks in}} what the New York Times said was a coup attempt against the interim government. It also cited the arrest of an unnamed dissident army captain on 27 October as the organiser of the countercoup attempt and reported that two other unnamed government critics were assaulted and left outside Bissau. Army Chief of Staff General Antonio Indjai laughed off questions {{that he was the}} power behind the throne and responded to the criticism in saying: [...] "People say I’m a drug trafficker. Anybody who has the proof, present it! We ask the international community to give us the means to fight drugs." [...] Gonzalez-Ducay then responded: [...] "I can't believe that the one who controls the drug trafficking is going to fight the drug trafficking." [...] The U.S. State Department's Foreign Service Officer for Guinea-Bissau Russell Hanks, who is not present in the country following the U.S. shutting its embassy during the Bissau-Guinean Civil War in 1998, said: [...] "You will only have an impact on this transition by engagement, not by isolation. These are the people who came in {{to pick up the pieces}} after the coup." [...] His staff pointed to photographs of newly created stretches of road in a remote rural area near the Senegal border that had space for small planes to land and they suggested was under the supervision of the armed forces. Chief of Guinea-Bissau's judicial police João Biague reported on a dubious aircraft landing months before the coup near Indjai's farm. He also added that [...] "The traffickers know [...] can't do much. The agents we have in the field <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> because they have nothing to eat." [...] Guinea-Bissau's former prosecutor general added: [...] "A country that’s not capable of discussing its own problems — it's not a country, it's not a state." ...|$|E
50|$|Notably, the Cameron Highlanders {{were the}} last battalions that wore the kilt in battle, due to the {{purposeful}} delaying of orders by commanding officers in the battalions (no one <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> the kilt) and a surprise attack by the Germans (successfully repelled). For this they earned the nickname of 'Ladies from Hell'.|$|R
