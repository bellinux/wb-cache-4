Managing director of Whitbread, Miles Templeman, explained that: <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>thinking</b> how to turn a second-rate north-west brand into something more stylish, {{to make it more}} appealing again. BBH thought of focusing on the creamy aspect, of selling a beer like a face cream.

500|$|Green Day {{made the}} record an album-long {{conceptual}} piece {{which was a}} response to the realities of the post-9/11 era. The band took inspiration from the concept records by The Who, sources in the musical theater repertoire like The Rocky Horror Show and West Side Story, and the concept album-cum-stage musical Jesus Christ, Superstar. Armstrong also said the band intended [...] "that it would be staged or we'd create a film or something... <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>thinking</b> in terms that it kind of felt like scoring a movie." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Kerrang!, Jesse Lacey commented on the upcoming album's content, [...] "It's a pretty exhausting record.

[...] He then questioned the future of the band, saying, [...] "I {{think a lot of the}} record is about us trying to make decisions about how long the band should go on. When I listened back to it, I realized how many songs are about something coming to a close, or knowing when it's time to put something away and move on." ...|$|E
40|$|Introduction We often {{know that}} <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>thinking,</b> and what <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>thinking</b> about. Here ‘thinking’ is not {{supposed}} to be an umbrella term for cognition in general, but should be taken in roughly the sense of ‘a penny for your thoughts’: mental activities like pondering, ruminating, wondering, musing and daydreaming all count as thinking. In the intended sense of ‘thinking’, <b>thinking</b> <b>is</b> not just propositional: in addition to thinking that p, there <b>is</b> <b>thinking</b> of (or about) x. Belief is necessary but not sufficient for thinking that p: thinking that p entails believing that p, but not conversely...|$|R

Following their 11 May concert at Rainbow Music Hall in Denver, concert {{promoter}} Chuck Morris took the band to the nearby Red Rocks Amphitheatre—a natural amphitheatre located between sandstone cliffs in the Rocky Mountains. Bassist Adam Clayton said, [...] "From the moment we saw it, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>thinking,</b> 'Some day we will play here'. It was very photogenic." [...] U2's manager Paul McGuinness had long wanted to film the group for a concert video to highlight their success as a live act and to promote them to American audiences still unfamiliar with the Irish band. Concert promoter Barry Fey, who presented U2's shows in the southwestern United States, saw the group's potential and successfully lobbied for them to perform at Red Rocks.|$|E

[...] Bassist Dave [...] "Phoenix" [...] Farrell predicted the band's fans would be divided about A Thousand Suns, saying, [...] "We've known [...] going to be different, and if fans were expecting Hybrid Theory or Meteora, they're going to be surprised.

[...] Wyman was originally supposed to direct several episodes the previous year and earlier in the season, but found he was too busy. He explained, [...] "Then an episode was coming up that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>thinking</b> about writing and I really felt close to it.

They wrote it as [...] "...just sort of a little sample calling card of what <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>thinking</b> about." [...] The story of the song was conceived with the help of one of the episode's writers Mr. Lawrence. Kenny explained, [...] "...Eventually somebody at Nickelodeon found it [...] on their desk and decided to make it into a holiday special." [...] The network let Kenny and Paley write three more songs for the upcoming special episode (Nickelodeon eventually decided to release a soundtrack album, which became It's a SpongeBob Christmas!

40|$|Extract) Unless we {{stop and}} think about thinking, {{critical}} <b>thinking</b> can <b>be</b> elusive. <b>Thinking</b> about <b>thinking</b> <b>is</b> a form of metacognition. It requires effortful understanding of the thinking process and an ability to exert control over it. When we think we often use heuristics, or a rule of thumb, to guide our conclusions. This of course means that {{there is no guarantee that}} our conclusions are correct. Conclusions may be drawn on the basis of impressions. These cognitive shortcuts allow for rapid processing of information, but they can also mislead and be inaccurate. Stereotypes are another example of classification according to salient features rather than factual elements. Before these are discussed in more detail, a quick look at comprehension and evaluation is worthwhile. Comprehension can be taken for granted or people can <b>be</b> put off <b>thinking</b> about what <b>is</b> being said by jargon-heavy or disciplinespecific language. It is easy, though, to unpack information and identify exactly what is being communicated. This unpacking will ultimately result in a far better ability to evaluate information. Although this may seem selfevident, unless <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>thinking</b> about what <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>thinking,</b> and why <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>thinking</b> about an issue in a certain way, we may fall into effortless thinking that can lead to false conclusions...|$|R

2500|$|Many early Black Flag shows {{ended in}} violence, often {{involving}} the Los Angeles Police Department. As a result, the police tapped the label's phones {{and kept the}} SST office under surveillance. Ginn claims undercover police posing as homeless people sat close to SST's front door. The band were unable to hire a lawyer {{because of a lack}} of money; Ginn later explained: [...] "I mean, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>thinking</b> about skimping on our meals. … There was no place to go".

It worked for us on the first record; it became a trademark sound. Not degrading it, we loved it, but at some point you have to grow as an artist or you get stuck. According to Lisa: We made that record [...] two years ago. It would be so dated to do it again. I feel we're staying current but staying ourselves. It was a natural progression.

2500|$|George Clinton {{produced}} the next album, Freaky Styley (1985). Clinton combined various elements of punk and funk into the band's repertoire, allowing their music to incorporate {{a variety of}} distinct styles. The album featured Maceo Parker and Fred Wesley {{on many of the}} album's tracks. The band often indulged in heavy heroin use while recording the album, which influenced the lyrics and musical direction of the album. The band had a much better relationship with Clinton than with Gill, but Freaky Styley, released on August 16, 1985, also achieved little success, failing to make an impression on any chart. The subsequent tour was also considered unproductive by the band. Despite the lack of success, the band was satisfied with Freaky Styley; Kiedis reflected, that [...] "it so surpassed anything we thought we could have done that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>thinking</b> we were on the road to enormity." [...] The band appeared in the 1986 movie Thrashin' (directed by David Winters and starring Josh Brolin) playing the song [...] "Blackeyed Blonde" [...] from Freaky Styley. During this time the band also appeared in the movie Tough Guys starring Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas performing the song [...] "Set It Straight" [...] at a Los Angeles nightclub.|$|E
2500|$|Author Michael Zager {{wrote that}} Pet Sounds resembles Spector's {{productions}} {{more than it}} does Rubber Soul, and that it recycles many of Spector's Wall of Sound production watermarks. Wilson talked of Spector's influence on his work, having learned how to produce records through attending his sessions, and in a 1988 interview, Wilson asserted that the album aspired to [...] "extend" [...] Spector's music, that [...] "in one sense of the word, we [...] were his messengers." [...] In Pet Sounds, Wilson sought to emulate Spector's Wall of Sound, driven by his fascination with [...] "combining one [...] to make another... It's amazing". Shortly before the album's release, Wilson spoke of recent popular music trends, saying [...] " [...] helped the Beach Boys evolve. We listen to what's happening and it affects what we do too. The trends have influenced my work, but so has my own scene." [...] In 1996, Wilson said of his partnership with Asher: [...] "none of us looked back... We went forward, kind of like on our own little wavelength. It wasn't like <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>thinking,</b> 'Okay, let's beat Spector,' let's out-do Motown.' It was more what I would call exclusive collaboration not to specifically try to kick somebody's butt, but just {{to do it the}} way you really want it to be. That's what I thought we did." ...|$|E
2500|$|The name Pet Sounds was Love's invention, {{according}} to himself, Brian, and Jardine. Brian {{explained that the}} album was named [...] "after the dogs... That was the whole idea", and that the title was a [...] "tribute" [...] to Spector by matching his initials (PS), but could not recall who thought {{of going to the}} zoo. Love recounted: [...] "We were standing in the hallway in one of the recording studios, either Western or Columbia, and we didn't have a title.... We had taken pictures at the zoo and... there were animal sounds on the record, and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>thinking,</b> well, it's our favorite music of that time, so I said, 'Why don't we call it Pet Sounds?'" [...] Brian has also credited Carl for the title, while Carl said with uncertainty that it might have come from Brian: [...] "The idea he [...] had was that everybody has these sounds that they love, and this was a collection of his 'pet sounds.' It was hard to think of a name for the album, because you sure couldn't call it Shut Down Vol. 3.. It was just so much more than a record; it had such a spiritual quality. It wasn't going in and doing another top ten. It had so much more meaning than that." ...|$|E
