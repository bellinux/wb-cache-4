When he was just eight years old, {{he was given a}} small yacht, which he would sail between Petergof and Kronstadt, spending his days at sea and returning home at night. In 1836, accompanied by Litke, he embarked on a lengthy sailing expedition and finally he was given command of the Russian frigate Hercules under Litke's direction. During his training Konstantin was treated like all other naval cadets, {{even to the point of}} his title of Grand Duke being dispensed with. He was placed on <b>watch</b> <b>duty</b> at midnight as well as in rain and storms. At the age of sixteen, Konstantin was promoted to the rank of captain and served as commander of the frigate Ulyses, visiting various ports along the Gulf of Finland and embarking on a southern tour that included the Mediterranean.|$|E

After 10 days at Casco Bay, she returned to Argentia and remained there until late January 1942, when she got underway to escort a convoy to England. After delivering her charges, the battleship patrolled waters near Iceland until March when she returned home. Around this time, the secondary battery was reduced to six 5-inch guns and the light AA battery was greatly increased, with the two 1.1-inch/75 caliber quad mount guns replaced by 6 (later 10) quad mount [...] Bofors and 44 [...] Oerlikon cannons, the attack on Pearl Harbor having demonstrated the need for this. For the next six months, she continued convoy-escort missions to various destinations. On one occasion, she escorted Guadalcanal-bound marines as far as Panama; on another, the warship screened service troops to Freetown, Sierra Leone, {{on the west coast}} of Africa. More frequently, she made voyages to and from the United Kingdom escorting both cargo- and troop-carrying ships.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the early}} {{eighteenth-century}} London, the night watchman was indeed an old controversial figure (established {{for the first}} time in the 1285 Statute of Winchester), deeply-rooted in the belief that the individual citizen had to perform his social and moral duty for the well-being of the society. Hence, every London parish requested its householders to perform by rotation the watch-duty on an unpaid and amateur basis, from dusk until dawn, and with only a stick or an halberd as a weapon. Each watchman was assigned with a short length of street to patrol every hour, and he had to examine all suspicious characters from his assigned watch box (a sentry box with half-door). The performance of such duty took away a great amount of money and energy, so by the late seventeenth-century it grew up the practice to pay a substitute (often another parishioner) to take up your <b>watch</b> <b>duty.</b> The fact that this service had to be arranged locally by parish officers rose a great number of issues. Firstly, the only men willing to take on this job for a very small wage were those who had little prospect of some other employment, usually old men hired as an alternative to the poor law grant. Secondly, Moreton suggests that [...] "parochial misapplication" [...] were commonplace around constables and beadles, appointed to collect the individual fee for the night-watch. They were often accused to spend as little as possible on hiring watchmen and pocket the difference as a recompense for the unpaid service they had performed.|$|E
