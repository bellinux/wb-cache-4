5|$|August 12. The Feast of the Prophet and His Bride. This holiday commemorates the {{marriage}} of Aleister Crowley and his first wife Rose Edith Crowley. Rose was {{a key figure in}} the <b>writing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Book of the Law.|$|E
5|$|April 8 through April 10. The Feast of the Three Days of the <b>Writing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Book of the Law. These {{three days}} are {{commemorative}} {{of the three}} days in the year 1904 during which Aleister Crowley wrote the Book of the Law. One chapter was written each day, the first being written on April 8, the second on April 9, and the third on April 10. Although there is no official way of celebrating any Thelemic holiday, this particular feast day is usually celebrated by reading the corresponding chapter {{on each of the}} three days, usually at noon.|$|E
5|$|Both {{character}} and actress received mixed reviews from critics throughout the series; Baxendale received the Best Actress {{award from the}} Broadcasting Press Guild for her portrayal of Rachel in the pilot and {{was nominated for a}} British Comedy Award. However, television reviewers criticised the character when the series began. Rachel's diagnosis with Asherman's syndrome in the fourth series drew criticism from the British Pregnancy Advisory Service, which had been consulted during the <b>writing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> storyline. When the series ended, there was a 20% {{increase in the number of}} people taking out life insurance policies with one provider, Tesco Personal Finance, which a spokesperson for the company attributed to Rachel's premature death.|$|E

5|$|Brütal Legend was {{generally}} well received by game reviewers, praising Schafer's vision and <b>writing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> heavy metal-inspired world, and {{the performances of}} the voice cast, particularly Black and Osbourne. Some felt that the hybrid gameplay of action and real-time strategy games did not mix well, however, blaming console control limitations and missing features normally found in games of either genre.|$|E
5|$|During {{most of his}} {{own life}} {{conservationism}} wasn't yet on the political agenda, and Tolkien himself did not directly express conservationist views—except in some private letters, in which he tells about his fondness for forests and sadness at tree-felling. In later years, a number of authors of biographies or literary analyses of Tolkien conclude that during his <b>writing</b> <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Lord of the Rings, Tolkien gained increased interest in the value of wild and untamed nature, and in protecting what wild nature was left in the industrialized world.|$|E
5|$|I was in Russia, then Germany, {{and spent}} a lot of time in Eastern Europe. There is this amazing German house-techno music, so I wanted to make a pop {{experimental}} record. I kind of wanted to leave the '80s a little bit, so the chorus is a '90s melody, which is what the inspiration was. There was certainly some whisky involved in the <b>writing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> record. It's about being in love with your best friend.|$|E

5|$|In 1006 Ælfheah succeeded Ælfric as Archbishop of Canterbury, taking Swithun's {{head with}} him as a relic for the new location. He went to Rome in 1007 to receive his pallium—symbol of his status as an archbishop—from Pope John XVIII, but was robbed during his journey. While at Canterbury he {{promoted}} the cult of Dunstan, ordering the <b>writing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second Life of Dunstan, which Adelard of Ghent composed between 1006 and 1011. He also introduced new practices into the liturgy, and {{was instrumental in the}} Witenagemot's recognition of Wulfsige of Sherborne as a saint in about 1012.|$|E
5|$|In 1873, Coolsma {{published}} a grammar of the Sundanese language, titled Handleiding bij de beoefening der Soendaneesche taal (Manual for the <b>Writing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sundanese Language). He reluctantly used a transcription method developed by K.F. Holle and proscribed by the colonial government. That {{year he was}} tasked with translating the New Testament into Sundanese. He left his school {{in the hands of}} fellow missionary D. J. van der Linden and went to Sumedang; there he worked on his translation over a period of three years.|$|E
5|$|In Belgium, the In Flanders Fields Museum in Ypres, {{named after}} the poem and devoted to the First World War, is {{situated}} in one of Flanders' largest tourist areas.

5|$|In The History of The Lord of the Rings series Christopher Tolkien {{recorded}} {{that his}} father had not foreseen the emergence of Faramir during the <b>writing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> book, only inventing him at the actual point of his appearance in The Two Towers. J.R.R.Tolkien noted that the introduction of Faramir had led to postponement of the book's dénouement and to further development of the background for Gondor and Rohan. Long after completing The Lord of the Rings, Tolkien would write that of all characters Faramir resembles the author most, and that he had deliberately bestowed upon the character several traits of his own.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s and 1970s however Dessau's {{original}} arguments received powerful restatement {{and expansion}} from Sir Ronald Syme, who devoted three books {{to the subject}} and was prepared to date the <b>writing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> work closely {{in the region of}} AD 395. Other recent studies also show much consistency of style, and most scholars now accept the theory of a single author of unknown identity, writing after 395. Although it was believed that the History Augusta did not reference any material from Ammianus Marcellinus' history, which was finished before 391 and which covered the same period, this has now been shown not to be the case, and that the Historia Augusta does in fact make reference to Ammianus' history.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} days of U2, his {{contributions}} to the band were often limited to fills and drum rolls, but he became more involved in the <b>writing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> songs later, particularly in conjunction with Adam Clayton, his partner in the rhythm section, with whom he has collaborated on solo projects. When the band was first being signed to CBS Records, they refused to sign the band unless Mullen was fired. He was not, and as a result, his drumming became more integrated into the song structures. His experiences in the Artane Boys Band reportedly heavily contributed to the martial beat featured in many of U2's songs, helping to evoke military imagery.|$|E

5|$|In the {{historical}} <b>writing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time, the humble devotion of the Decembrist women was {{contrasted with the}} intrigues and hedonism of female aristocrats of the 18thcentury, like Catherine the Great, whose excesses were seen as the danger of too-sudden liberation for women. Although they did not explicitly espouse a feminist agenda, the Decembrist women were used as an example by later generations of Russian feminists, whose concern for gender equality was also tied to revolutionary political agendas.|$|E
5|$|Joan of Arc is a 1796 epic poem {{composed}} by Robert Southey. The {{idea for the}} story came from a discussion between Southey and Grosvenor Bedford, when Southey realised that the story would be suitable for an epic. The subject further appealed to Southey because {{the events of the}} French Revolution were concurrent to the <b>writing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> poem and would serve as a parallel to current events. Eventually, Samuel Taylor Coleridge helped rewrite parts of the poem for a 1798 edition. Later editions removed Coleridge's additions along with other changes.|$|E
5|$|On 14 September 1955, the Apostolic Vicariate of Dakar {{became an}} archdiocese, and Lefebvre thus {{became the first}} Metropolitan Archbishop of Dakar.

5|$|On {{the back}} of the cover, the UK album {{contained}} a review of the White Album written for The Observer by Tony Palmer. The review was introduced by a few liner notes by Apple press officer Derek Taylor. The US cover contained a fictitious illustrated biography by Dan Davis of the Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, in which the ensemble's battle with the Blue Meanies was compared to three other epic struggles {{in the history of the}} English-speaking world: Beowulf's struggle to save the Heorot mead hall, King John's signing of the Magna Carta and Thomas Jefferson's <b>writing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Declaration of Independence.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} the two Eon Productions Bond films {{released}} prior to the <b>writing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> novel (Dr. No and From Russia with Love) were reflected in the novel through the increased number of gadgets used. One of these was the poison gun used in {{the scene of the}} attempted assassination of M. The idea was taken from the story of Bohdan Stashynsky, who defected from the Eastern Bloc to the West in 1961. Stashynsky was put on trial for the murder of Ukrainian nationalist leaders Lev Rebet and Stepan Bandera and stated that he had used a poison-spray gun to do it.|$|E
5|$|The prison {{became known}} {{around the world}} in the 19th century through the <b>writing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> English novelist Charles Dickens, whose father was sent there in 1824, when Dickens was 12, for a debt to a baker. Forced as a result to leave school to work in a factory, Dickens based several of his {{characters}} on his experience, most notably Amy Dorrit, whose father is in the Marshalsea for debts so complex no one can fathom how to get him out.|$|E
