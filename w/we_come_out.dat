500|$|In May 1946, the LDS Church excommunicated Brodie. She {{never tried}} to regain her membership. Brodie once wrote to a friend that what she {{suffered}} from her disillusionment with Mormonism [...] "had {{to do with the}} pain I caused my family. [...] The disillusionment itself was...a liberating experience." [...] Before No Man Knows My History was published, Brodie sought to comfort her parents, [...] "You brought us all up to revere the truth, which is the noblest ideal a parent can instill in his children, and the fact that <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> on somewhat different roads certainly is no reflection on you." [...] Brodie's mother and three sisters were enthusiastic about the book, but Thomas McKay refused to read it.|$|E
500|$|Beating as One was {{recorded}} at House of David in Nashville, Tennessee and produced by Roger Moutenot, who also produced the band's previous two albums. Kaplan described the recording sessions {{of the album}} as follows: [...] "We hole up {{in a room and}} work for a really long time. Then <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> and blink our eyes because it's sunny out". Initially, the band did not intend to write a long album, but eventually felt that having a long album {{was the only way to}} accommodate the instrumental track [...] "Spec Bebop", which the band felt it needed to be included in the album [...] "by hook or by crook". Beating as One is the only Yo La Tengo album that {{was recorded}} on an ADAT magnetic tape format, even though it was mixed to analog later. Audio mixing took place at Big House and Magic Shop in New York City.|$|E
2500|$|The character's {{wardrobe}} originally encompassed a rocker yet feminine look. She {{would drive}} {{around in a}} vintage car, listening to loud rock, often wearing a Ramones T-shirt. [...] " [...] – I just love her. Working with her (has) been wonderful. For her, [...] more of the do-it-yourself girl. She’s so into music, art, she’s such a rich character {{that there are a}} lot of different things to draw on," [...] stated One Tree Hill’s costume designer, Carol Cutshall. [...] "Sometimes she’ll just be in a plaid flannel shirt because she’s painting. Some days she’ll be in a concert T-shirt. We have to find the right concert T-shirt. I do alter them a lot." [...] Cutshall would take a men’s concert T-shirt, and have Burton put it on. [...] "She’s also very, very slender, so I’ll taper them down to her figure. <b>We</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> of it with kind of a one-o-f-a-kind rock T-shirt. I take something and then turn it into my own piece of clothing," [...] said Cutshall. Peyton’s main brands have been Cheap Monday, Levi’s, some Diesel and Miss Sixty.|$|E

2500|$|... "Dolobran. [...] The country-seat of Clement A. Griscom, Esq., is a {{about half}} a mile {{northeast}} from Haverford Station, Pennsylvania Railroad, and comprises somewhat more than eighty acres, of a rolling, uneven nature, the larger portion of the land sloping generally toward the northward, and eastward to a stream of water which flows through the tract in an easterly direction. The tract is nearly rectangular in shape. The southwestern portion is gently rolling, and has been appropriated for a lawn, through which the carriage road winds to the residence past beds of beautiful variegated plants and flowers, clumps of evergreens, etc. Close by the residence is the upper end of a heavily wooded ravine, extending to the stream of water; a woodland walk has been made in this ravine, which is so closed in by trees and shrubbery that one could easily imagine himself following a path in the forest; here and there along this walk are rustic benches and 'crow-nests' for those who would rest a while. At the bottom of this walk <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> to the stream near a large lake, where there are facilities for boating and bathing. Near the head of the ravine just described, and near the mansion house is a flower garden devoted exclusively to Japanese plants. The northerly portion of the estate is naturally much rougher, and splendidly adapted by nature to the purpose to which Mr. Griscom has devoted about thirty acres of this section, namely, as an 'American Wild Garden.' Besides being originally heavily wooded, innumerable native American trees, plants, and flowers were brought from all sections of the country. Two or three old stone quarries in this tract have been utilized to make forest pools, in which are many varieties of beautiful water lilies and other water-growing flowers and plants; while rhododendrons and ferns abound along the shores of the pools and on the outcropping ledges of the cliffs. Throughout this tract woodland paths wind in every direction, along which the pedestrian can catch a glimpse of shaded pools, wooded glens, and nooks, mossy banks of rivulets, and such pretty bits of nature, and the paths are of a length that traversing all of them without going along the same one twice makes one feel that he had had plenty of exercise for the time. From the porch of the house one might imagine that the residence was the only building on the property, so thoroughly do the near-by tree growths hide the usual buildings of a country place, but it is only a walk of a minute or two through the trees to a finely-appointed stable, in which is kept a number of blooded horses for riding and driving, and not far off is a large greenhouse for the growth of many kinds of flowers, and hotbeds for early vegetable delicacies for the table. On {{the eastern edge of the}} estate is an attractive cottage occupied by Mr. and Mrs. Bettle, Mrs. Bettle being Mrs. Griscom's daughter; and at the foot of the lawn sloping to the eastward from the mansion house is another cottage in which reside Mr. Griscom's son, Rodman E. Griscom, and his wife." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We may," [...] Weiss answered, [...] "but it's a big thing. Even if <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> safe, {{we shall}} come out losers. Well, {{did you see}} the girl?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{under which}} king does Bezonian speak or die?" [...] asked Warrington. [...] "Do <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> as Liberal Conservative, or as Government man, or {{on our own}} hook?" ...|$|E
60|$|Holmes and I {{followed}} {{them down the}} lane, and my friend plucked at my sleeve as <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>out.</b>|$|R
60|$|Towards morning <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> upon an open plain, {{and left}} these evil prowlers {{of the night}} behind us.|$|R
60|$|As <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> of {{the club}} there stood two men on the {{sidewalk}} near the steps in earnest conversation.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's fine, dad!" [...] cried Tom, {{and threw}} his cap in the air. [...] "Hurrah! <b>We</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> ahead every time, don't we?" [...] And {{then he did}} a jig, he felt so happy.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, we {{will take}} {{particular}} notice of some great building, or something else that is remarkable where <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> into the street, and by that means we shall {{be able to find}} our way back to the hotel." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am quite}} sorry to go, {{you are so}} amusing," [...] said Fanny, [...] "but I suppose you will have settled about heroism by the time <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> again, and will {{tell me what the}} boys ought to play at." ...|$|E
60|$|As <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> {{upon the}} floor of the church again, another priest volunteered to show us the treasures of the church.|$|R
6000|$|... "Very {{thoughtful}} of you, Lady Dennisford," [...] I answered. [...] "We {{certainly did}} not mean to walk so far when <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> into the park." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Richard," [...] said he, {{slipping}} his {{arm through}} mine as <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> into Parliament Street, [...] "I promised you some sport. Have you enjoyed it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] Reuben said, [...] "they {{would only}} shoot us down as <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>out.</b> They must guess {{that some of}} us are up at this window, or they would try to carry the horses off, instead of {{destroying}} them.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{have him}} for this evening, at any rate," [...] Sophy replied contentedly; [...] "and he hasn't spent all his fortune yet. I am {{not at all sure}} that I shall not hint at supper when <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> of the Palace." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Rochester Row," [...] said he. [...] "Now Vincent Square. Now <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> on the Vauxhall Bridge Road. We {{are making}} for the Surrey side, apparently. Yes, I thought so. Now {{we are on}} the bridge. You can catch glimpses of the river." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] says he, [...] "you're mighty bold for a barber; and I like you, Coxe, {{for your}} spirit." [...] And so <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> of the gate.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I mean,' {{she added}} in an undeceiving tone, 'because I saw Mrs. Goodman enter the tent {{again just as}} <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> here; so I have no further responsibility.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hunger--fatigue--all {{those things}} are different. Everything is different--everything. To me it seems that since first <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> of the sphere has been only a {{question}} of hours--long hours--at most." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No,' replied Jerry, 'no, it's not {{the custom}} with us. But we've been playing {{a little on}} the road to-day, and <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> with a new {{wardrobe}} at the races, so I didn't think it worth while to stop to undress. Down, Pedro!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It wouldn't {{be of any}} use," [...] {{cried the}} young girl gaily. [...] "We're all wrapped up, and you couldn't form any idea of us. You must wait, and let us burst upon you when <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> of the dressing-room at Madame Uccelli's." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There ain't no need ter see a trail hyer," [...] replied Ike Watson. [...] "This yere way is a blind pocket fer all o' {{these three}} miles. Ye couldn't go no {{different}} if ye tried. Byme-by, when <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> on Sampson's flats, we'll {{look for the}} trail ag'in." ...|$|E
60|$|As <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> of the Stylites Arms, Poirot drew {{me aside}} by a gentle {{pressure}} of the arm. I understood his object. He {{was waiting for the}} Scotland Yard men.|$|R

6000|$|Our {{visit to}} the {{hospital}} took more time than we had reckoned on, and the sun had dipped before <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>out.</b> When Van Helsing saw how dark it was, he said, ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dears," [...] said I, [...] "we {{philosophers}} {{must give}} an occasional {{dip into the}} mystical, and say something apparently absurd {{for the purpose of}} explaining that we mean nothing in particular by it. It gives common people an idea of our sagacity, to find how clear <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> of our apparent contradictions and absurdities. Listen." ...|$|E
6000|$|He knows--none better!--that {{the plains}} of Mont Saint Jean are the great {{gambling}} tables on which the supreme gambler--Napoleon, once Emperor of the French and master of half the world--had staked his all.

6000|$|... “About {{the tenth}} easy day’s journey, after <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> of Mecca, we enter into Medina, {{the place where}} Mahomet lies entombed. Although it be (as I take it) two or three days’ journey out of the direct way from Mecca to Egypt, yet the Hagges pay their visit there for the space of two days, and come away the third.|$|E
6000|$|The {{case had}} taken wind among the workmen at the potteries; and as <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> at their dinner-hour, {{there was a}} great assemblage, loudly cheering, [...] "Alison, the poor man's friend!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I really don't know. I {{missed her}} when <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> on the terrace. She will very likely join {{us at the}} lake. Do you care about seeing the lake, Lady Lundie?" ...|$|R
