"But <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> {{most was}} the men--the men leering and blathering at you across tables, {{trying to buy}} you with Würzburger or Extra Dry, {{according}} to their estimate of your price.

Oh, how I hate 'em! ...|$|E

I am sure he thinks poor people nothing but a study, and rich ones nothing but a profit. And his half sneers! But <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> most {{was his way of}} avoiding discussions. When he saw he had said what would not go down with papa, he did not honestly stand up to the point, and argue it out, but seemed to have no mind of his own, and to be only talking to please papa--but not knowing how to do it. He understand my father indeed!" ...|$|E

In spite of what my master Leo had said, my father got me an engagement, not at the opera, but to take singing parts at a suburb theatre in Vienna. He {{had nothing to do}} with the theatre then; I did not {{understand}} what he did, but I think he was continually at a gambling house, though he was careful always about taking me to the theatre. I was very miserable. The plays I acted in were detestable to me. Men came about us and wanted to talk to me: women and men seemed to look at me with a sneering smile; it was no better than a fiery furnace. Perhaps I make it worse than it was--you don't know that life: but the glare and the faces, and my having to go on and act and sing <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>hated,</b> and then see people who came to stare at me behind the scenes--it was all so much worse than when I was a little girl. I went through with it; I did it; I had set my mind to obey my father and work, for I saw nothing better that I could do. But I felt that my voice was getting weaker, and I knew that my acting was not good except when it was not really acting, but the part was one that I could be myself in, and some feeling within me carried me along. That was seldom.|$|E

The game {{was in the midst}} of a 12-1 BYU season. It was also their second consecutive win against Utah and their eighth win out of the last nine games against Utah.
