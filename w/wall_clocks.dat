2500|$|Fused {{plugs and sockets}} {{of various}} {{proprietary}} and non-interchangeable types are found in older public buildings in the UK, where {{they are used to}} feed AC electric <b>wall</b> <b>clocks.</b> They are smaller than conventional sockets, commonly being made to fit BESA junction boxes, and are often of very low profile. Early types were available fused in both poles, later types fused in the line only and provided an earth pin. Most are equipped with a retaining screw or clip to prevent accidental disconnection. The prevalence of battery powered quartz controlled <b>wall</b> <b>clocks</b> has meant that this connector is rarely seen in new installations for clock use. [...] However, it has found use where a low profile fused connector is required and is still available. [...] A relatively common example of such a use is to supply power to an illuminated mirror that has limited clearance from the wall.|$|E

2500|$|Che Guevara's {{likeness}} {{has undergone}} continual apotheosis while being weaved throughout {{the public consciousness}} {{in a variety of}} ways. From being viewed as a [...] "Saintly Christ-like" [...] figure by the rural poor in Bolivia where he was executed, to being viewed as an idealistic insignia for youth, longing for a vague sense of rebellion. His likeness can also be seen on millions of posters, hats, key chains, mouse pads, hoodies, beanies, flags, berets, backpacks, bandannas, belt buckles, wallets, watches, <b>wall</b> <b>clocks,</b> Zippo lighters, pocket flasks, bikinis, personal tattoos, and most commonly T-shirts. Meanwhile, his life story can be found in an array of films, documentaries, plays, and songs of tribute. Throughout television, music, books, magazines, and ironically even corporate advertisements, Che's visage is an ever-present political and apolitical emblem that has been endlessly mutated, transformed, and morphed over the last forty years of visual popular culture. This allows Che to operate as [...] "both a fashionable de-politicized logo, as well as a potent anti-establishment symbol used by a wide spectrum of human rights movements and individuals affirming their own liberation." ...|$|E
25|$|To {{keep the}} <b>wall</b> <b>clock</b> {{in sync with}} the {{reference}} clock, each week the owner compares the time on his <b>wall</b> <b>clock</b> to a more accurate clock (a phase comparison), and he resets his clock.

30|$|Also, by solely {{relying on}} event time semantics, SECRET cannot model {{the aspects of}} an engine that depend on <b>wall</b> <b>clock</b> time.

25|$|Some clocks have a timing {{adjustment}} (a fast-slow control). When {{the owner}} compared his <b>wall</b> <b>clock's</b> {{time to the}} reference time, he noticed that his clock was too fast. Consequently, he could turn the timing adjust a small amount to make the clock run a little slower (frequency). If things work out right, his clock will be more accurate than before. Over a series of weekly adjustments, the <b>wall</b> <b>clock's</b> notion of a second would agree with the reference time (locked both in frequency and phase within the <b>wall</b> <b>clock's</b> stability).|$|R

40|$|An {{inexpensive}} <b>wall</b> <b>clock</b> {{has been}} devised for displaying solar time or sidereal {{time as it}} would be perceived on a planet other than the Earth, or for displaying sidereal time on the Earth. The concept of a <b>wall</b> <b>clock</b> synchronized to a period other than the terrestrial mean solar day is not new in itself. What is new here is that the clock is realized through a relatively simple electronic modification of a common battery-powered, quartz-crystal-oscillator-driven <b>wall</b> <b>clock.</b> The essence of the modification is to shut off the internal oscillator of the clock and replace the internal-oscillator output signal with a signal of the required frequency generated by an external oscillator. The unmodified clock electronic circuitry includes a quartz crystal connected to an integrated circuit (IC) that includes, among other parts, a buffer amplifier that conditions the oscillator output. The modification is effected by removing the quartz crystal and connecting the output terminal of the external oscillator, via a capacitor, to the input terminal of the buffer amplifie...|$|R
40|$|For sensor {{networks}} a {{wide variety}} of time synchronization protocols exist. These protocols establish a common logical clock between participating nodes. This logical clock has no relation with <b>wall</b> <b>clock</b> time. While a synchronized logical clock enables many interesting applications, such as more energy efficient MAC protocols, it does not cater much to the needs of data gathering, the main application of sensor networks. Sensor data is often useless if the time of the measurement is unknown. Time synchronization protocols in conjuction with a method of converting logical <b>clock</b> values to <b>wall</b> <b>clock</b> time, such as UTC, would enable one to order events in applications where sensor data is sampled from multiple, independent sensor networks. In this thesis a method is proposed to establish a relationship between the logical clock provided by time synchronization protocols and <b>wall</b> <b>clock</b> time with the aid of the Global Positioning System. Furthermore the proposed approach is, implemented on a small network of sensor nodes with the Zigbit 900 chip using TinyOS. 3...|$|R
30|$|The total <b>wall</b> <b>clock</b> {{time that}} each {{benchmark}} takes to run {{is roughly the}} same (σ/μ< 0.6 %) under DVFS, DFS, and MVF; the reason being that we are considering a reactive scenario, where {{the pace of the}} system is not determined by the core frequency but by the data input rate imposed by the environment. In other words, the system must complete a given workload within a specified <b>wall</b> <b>clock</b> time. It cannot complete the workload significantly faster, because the input data only becomes available in real time, and it must not complete its workload significantly slower (the latter would indicate an abnormal overload situation).|$|R
