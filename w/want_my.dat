25|$|I guess I {{just wanted}} this album to {{be a lot}} about me and all the {{different}} styles of music that I like – not just one sort of style or genre. I really {{want to be able to}} tell real stories through my music, rather than talking about stuff that doesn’t really matter which is what a lot of people seem to end up doing these days. I don’t want it to be just glossy and disposable; I <b>want</b> <b>my</b> songs to deal with real issues.|$|E

The first verse {{of the song}} begins with Beyoncé reminiscing about the times she and her father/manager, Mathew Knowles shared {{as a child and}} through her adolescence. She sings about wanting to be with a man and a child who has similar qualities as her father. This is {{illustrated}} in the lyrics: [...] "I treasure every irreplaceable memory and that's why I <b>want</b> <b>my</b> unborn son to be like my daddy, I <b>want</b> <b>my</b> husband to be like my daddy, there is no one else like my daddy." [...] According to Marc Anthony Neal of the PopMatters, Beyoncé also confidently embraces her womanhood in the song. In a way, Beyoncé pays tribute to her father through this song.|$|E

500|$|... "Lord Tell Me Why" [...] is {{a gospel}} song with a rolling funk groove, sung from the {{perspective}} of a lower class White man who has become disillusioned with the American dream. His ironic lyrics ask in the chorus, [...] "Lord tell me why a white man / Ain't worth nothin' in this world no more." [...] The guitar-based [...] "I <b>Want</b> <b>My</b> Crown" [...] was recorded with an 11-piece band and has an aggressive blues style, rumba-rock groove, and growling vocals. The song is an indictment of politicians as [...] "Judas men" [...] who sided with oil barons and Republicans, and their greed that leads to war. [...] "I <b>Want</b> <b>My</b> Crown" [...] has been described by one writer as a [...] "Mephistopheles-as-Right-winger character study".|$|E
500|$|The title track, {{which was}} also the theme song to her MTV reality series The Ashlee Simpson Show, opens the album by {{introducing}} Simpson, who sings [...] "got stains on my t-shirt, and I'm the biggest flirt" [...] and [...] "if you <b>want</b> <b>my</b> auto, <b>want</b> <b>my</b> autobiography / baby, just ask me". The Village Voice review described the song as [...] "wrist-pumping Joan Jett rock candy", but Stylus labelled the track [...] "an age-old trope and a boring one at that". [...] "Pieces of Me", a song about the comfort and happiness Simpson found in her relationship with Ryan Cabrera, has been characterised as a soft rock ballad with [...] "stringy guitar riffs". [...] "Shadow", described by People magazine as the [...] "most personal song" [...] on the album, is a slower tune in which Simpson recounts playing a lesser role to her sister when she was younger, but eventually finding her own identity.|$|E

500|$|Rundgren {{points out}} that [...] "the themes of the songs were darker." [...] The second track, [...] "Life is a Lemon and I <b>Want</b> <b>My</b> Money Back", {{demonstrates}} this pessimism.

AllMusic labels it [...] "a stomping rocker that wraps serious feelings in a cryptically witty metaphor." [...] Despite the pessimism, both AllMusic and Meat Loaf point out that [...] "it is a funny song." ...|$|E

500|$|Jackson {{released}} her fourth album, Rhythm Nation 1814, in September 1989. Although her record label desired a direct sequel to Control, Jackson chose {{to include a}} socially conscious theme among various musical styles. She stated, [...] "I know an album or a song can't change the world. I just <b>want</b> <b>my</b> music and my dance to catch the audience's attention, and to hold it long {{enough for them to}} listen to the lyrics." [...] The album's central theme of unity was developed in response to various crimes and tragedies reported in the media.|$|E

500|$|Visual {{elements}} employed during Nine Inch Nails concerts {{have often}} included numerous lighting, stage and projection effects employed to accompany and augment presentation. [...] Prior to the Fragility tour in 2000, Reznor reflected that [...] "I’ve adopted {{a philosophy of}} the way to present Nine Inch Nails live that incorporates a theatrical element. I want it to be drama. I <b>want</b> <b>my</b> rock stars to be larger than life, you know? The Kurt Cobains of the world, I’m sick of that shit. I don’t want a gas station attendant being my hero.

500|$|Anthony DeCurtis of Rolling Stone {{commented that}} the album, which starts with [...] " [...] {{cauldron}} of energy" [...] on [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] (2003), ends by contrast with [...] "Daddy" [...] which he described as a five-minute tribute to her manager-father, and considered to be [...] "an anthology of vocal and lyrical cliches." [...] MTV News wrote that [...] "Daddy" [...] {{is different from the}} other relationship songs on Dangerously in Love, and added that it has a powerful message. By contrast, Allison Stewart of The Washington Post and Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times both called [...] "Daddy" [...] a [...] "creepy bonus track". Similarly, Spence D., writing for IGN Music stated that [...] "Daddy" [...] is not really worth uncovering, as it follows suit in terms of being [...] "a by-the-books contempo R rendition", and he commented that [...] "there is something oddly eerie about an attractive woman such as Beyoncé crooning the words 'I <b>want</b> <b>my</b> husband to be like my Daddy.'" [...] Mike Wass of the website Idolator called the song one of the [...] "duds" [...] on the album and added that it was a [...] "best forgotten ode to the superstar's father complete with stomach-churning lyrics like 'I <b>want</b> <b>my</b> husband to be like my daddy'". In 2014, Louis Virtel of the website HitFix reviewed the song negatively, calling it the worst on Dangerously in Love and describing its lyrics as [...] "seriously simplistic". [...] "Daddy" [...] peaked at number 26 on the Billboard Hot RingMasters charts in the United States in 2014.|$|E
