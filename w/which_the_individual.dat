5|$|Finally {{the tidal}} radius, or Hill sphere, is the {{distance}} {{from the center of the}} globular cluster at which the external gravitation of the galaxy has more influence over the stars in the cluster than does the cluster itself. This is the distance at <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> stars belonging to a cluster can be separated away by the galaxy. The tidal radius of M3 is about 40 arc minutes, or about 113 pc at the distance of 10.4 kpc.|$|E
5|$|In a medium, light {{usually does}} not {{propagate}} {{at a speed}} equal to c; further, different types of light wave will travel at different speeds. The speed at <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> crests and troughs of a plane wave (a wave filling the whole space, with only one frequency) propagate is called the phase velocityvp. An actual physical signal with a finite extent (a pulse of light) travels at a different speed. The largest part of the pulse travels at the group velocityvg, and its earliest part travels at the front velocityvf.|$|E

5|$|The Rights of Men indicts monarchy and {{hereditary}} distinctions {{and promotes}} a republican ideology. Relying on 17th- and early 18th-century notions of republicanism, Wollstonecraft maintains that virtue {{is at the}} core of citizenship. However, her notion of virtue is more individualistic and moralistic than traditional Commonwealth ideology. The goals of Wollstonecraft's republicanism are the happiness and prosperity of the individual, not the greatest good for the greatest number or the greatest benefits for the propertied. While she emphasizes the benefits that will accrue to the individual under republicanism, she also maintains that reform can only be effected at a societal level. This marks a change from her earlier texts, such as Original Stories from Real Life (1788), in <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> plays the primary role in social reform.|$|E
5|$|The selfish herd {{theory was}} {{proposed}} by W.D. Hamilton {{to explain why}} animals seek central positions in a group. The theory's central idea {{is to reduce the}} individual's domain of danger. A domain of danger is the area within the group in <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> {{is more likely to be}} attacked by a predator. The center of the group has the lowest domain of danger, so animals will constantly strive to gain this position. Testing Hamilton's selfish herd effect, Alta De Vos and Justin O'Rainn (2010) studied brown fur seal predation from great white sharks. Using decoy seals, the researchers varied the distance between the decoys to produce different domains of danger. The seals with a greater domain of danger had an increased risk of shark attack.|$|E
5|$|Later {{research}} {{has managed to}} create convincing models of patterns as diverse as zebra stripes, giraffe blotches, jaguar spots (medium-dark patches surrounded by dark broken rings) and ladybird shell patterns (different geometrical layouts of spots and stripes, see illustrations). Richard Prum's activation-inhibition models, developed from Turing's work, use six variables {{to account for the}} observed range of nine basic within-feather pigmentation patterns, from the simplest, a central pigment patch, via concentric patches, bars, chevrons, eye spot, pair of central spots, rows of paired spots and an array of dots. More elaborate models simulate complex feather patterns in the guineafowl Numida meleagris in <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> feathers feature transitions from bars at the base to an array of dots at the far (distal) end. These require an oscillation created by two inhibiting signals, with interactions in both space and time.|$|E

40|$|We used DNA {{polymorphic}} markers on {{the long}} arm of human chromosome 21 {{in order to determine}} the parental and meiotic origin of the extra chromosome 21 in families with recurrent free trisomy 21. A total of 22 families were studied, 13 in <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>individuals</b> with trisomy 21 were siblings (category 1), four families in <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>individuals</b> with trisomy 21 were second-degree relatives (category 2), and five families in <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>individuals</b> with trisomy 21 were third-degree relatives, that is, their parents were siblings (category 3). In five category 1 families, parental mosaicism was detected, while in the remaining eight families, the origin of nondisjunction was maternal. In two of the four families of category 2 the nondisjunctions originated in individuals who were related. In only one of five category 3 families, the nondisjunctions originated in related individuals. These results suggest that parental mosaicism is an important etiologic factor in recurrent free trisomy 21 (5 of 22 families) and that chance alone can explain the recurrent trisomy 21 in many of the remaining families (14 of 22 families). However, in a small number of families (3 of 22), a familial predisposing factor or undetected mosaicism cannot be excluded...|$|R

30|$|The F 1 factor—desire for the {{structure}} {{is referred to as}} <b>the</b> extent to <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>individuals</b> want to establish a structure in their daily lives.

The F 2 factor—response to the lack of structure is referred to as <b>the</b> extent to <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>individuals</b> respond to unstructured, unpredictable situations. People who expressively dislike uncertain situations or changes in their plans at the last moment achieve a high score in the response to the lack of structure. The results of research studies conducted by Neuberg and Newsom (1993) indicate that both factors of the PNS scale are in different relationships to various individual features: response to lack of structure correlates with neuroticism and introversion, while desire for structure does not.|$|R

25|$|Resolution of {{the tension}} causing this type of {{neurosis}} involves a careful constructive study of the fantasies.

25|$|In part two, Unger {{attempts}} {{to explain how}} one becomes capable of passion.
