40|$|The Indonesian {{shipbuilding}} industry {{must get}} involved in a collaboration network in order to be survived in the global competitiveness. The competitiveness level of Indonesian shipbuilding industry is low with only about 1. 6 percent of International market share. Most of the proportion is contributed by PT PAL Indonesia with its maximum 50. 000 DWT of shipbuilding capacities. The reason can be identified as the Indonesian domestic shipyards are still working as a single company respectively. This fact is contradicted with the tendency of international shipbuilding industry in the current global competitiveness to do collaboration among them to increase their <b>production</b> <b>capacities.</b> Successful example of the shipyard collaboration {{in order to get the}} most of the shipbuilding international market is collaboration among shipyards in South Korea and China. Both of these countries have integrated their shipyards and hence have increased significantly their <b>shipbuilding</b> <b>production</b> <b>capacities.</b> Currently, they have been recognized as a shipbuilder country.

It is expected from suggested methodology to give {{better and more}} efficient tool for complex <b>shipbuilding</b> <b>production</b> processes design procedure. Within {{the first part of}} {{this research}} existing practice for production process design in shipbuilding was discussed, its shortcomings and problem were emphasized. In continuing, discrete event simulation modelling method, as basis of suggested methodology, is investigated and described regarding its special characteristics, advantages and reasons for application, especially in <b>shipbuilding</b> <b>production</b> process. Furthermore, simulation modeling basics were described as well as suggested methodology for production process procedure. Case study of suggested methodology application for designing a robotized profile fabrication production process line is demonstrated. Selected design solution, acquired with suggested methodology was evaluated through comparison with robotized profile cutting production line installation in a specific shipyard production process. Based on obtained data from real production the simulation model was further enhanced. Finally, on grounds of this research, results and droved conclusions, directions for further research are suggested...|$|R
