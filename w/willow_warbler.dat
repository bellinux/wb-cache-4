5|$|This warbler {{gets its}} name from its simple {{distinctive}} song, a repetitive cheerful chiff-chaff. This song {{is one of the}} first avian signs that spring has returned. Its call is a hweet, less disyllabic than the hooeet of the <b>willow</b> <b>warbler</b> or hu-it of the western Bonelli's warbler.|$|E
5|$|The British naturalist Gilbert White {{was one of}} {{the first}} people to {{separate}} the similar-looking common chiffchaff, <b>willow</b> <b>warbler</b> and wood warbler by their songs, as detailed in 1789 in The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne, but the common chiffchaff was first formally described as Sylvia collybita by French ornithologist Louis Vieillot in 1817 in his Nouveau Dictionnaire d'Histoire Naturelle.|$|E
25|$|Since 1970, {{reduction}} of farmland {{has resulted in}} reduced environment for, and reduced numbers of various shrubland birds including the American woodcock, brown thrasher, eastern towhee, <b>willow</b> flycatcher, golden-winged <b>warbler,</b> blue-winged warbler, field sparrow, and Baltimore oriole.|$|R
50|$|The grounds also {{qualify as}} a Local Biodiversity Site (LBS). The Scottish Ornithologists Club (SOC) have {{identified}} Spier's as a site for birdwatching with, amongst others, tits, finches, thrushes, greater spotted woodpecker, chiffchaff, blackcap, <b>willow</b> and garden <b>warbler.</b> An unusual bird migrant record for the school grounds in the 1920s {{is that of the}} mealy redpoll (Carduelis flammea flammea). It breeds across the northern parts of North America and Eurasia.|$|R
50|$|The Great Swamp is home {{to about}} 180 species of bird, {{including}} 100 that breed there. The red-winged blackbird {{is one of the}} most commonly observed, while the bittern, sora, and marsh wren are often not seen. The large size, wide range of habitat, and river dynamics are what make these wetlands so suitable for wildlife. Several areas, ponds, and preserves have concentrated wildlife. Camp Sharparoon, now the Dover Furnace Shooting Preserve, an 1800 acre area west of New York State Route 22, was home to one of the first breeding grounds for ravens within the county. Other commonly seen species include turkey vultures, red-tail hawks, swallows, swifts, black vulture, redstart, veery, indigo bunting, Louisiana waterthrush, northern waterthrush, winter wren, black-throated green <b>warbler,</b> <b>willow</b> flycatcher, and alder flycatcher. Throughout other areas, the wood duck, mallard, Canada goose, great blue heron, and belted kingfisher are seen nesting in various bridges. The Great Swamp is Audubon-designated Important Bird Area #89.|$|R
5|$|The common {{chiffchaff}} breeds across Europe and Asia east {{to eastern}} Siberia and north to about 70°N, with isolated populations in northwest Africa, northern and western Turkey and northwestern Iran. It is migratory, {{but it is}} one of the first passerine birds to return to its breeding areas in the spring and among the last to leave in late autumn. When breeding, it is a bird of open woodlands with some taller trees and ground cover for nesting purposes. These trees are typically at least 5metres (16ft) high, with undergrowth that is an open, poor to medium mix of grasses, bracken, nettles or similar plants. Its breeding habitat is quite specific, and even near relatives do not share it; for example, the <b>willow</b> <b>warbler</b> (P. trochilus) prefers younger trees, while the wood warbler (P. sibilatrix) prefers less undergrowth. In winter, the common chiffchaff uses a wider range of habitats including scrub, and is not so dependent on trees. It is often found near water, unlike the <b>willow</b> <b>warbler</b> which tolerates drier habitats. There is an increasing tendency to winter in western Europe well north of the traditional areas, especially in coastal southern England and the mild urban microclimate of London. These overwintering common chiffchaffs include some visitors of the eastern subspecies abietinus and tristis, so they are certainly not all birds which have bred locally, although some undoubtedly are.|$|E
25|$|Sound Heath {{forms an}} {{important}} breeding {{site for a}} wide range of birds. Locally rare species include the Eurasian sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus) and the willow tit (Parus montanus). Among the other species that have been observed here are the moorhen, reed bunting, turtle dove and <b>willow</b> <b>warbler,</b> the tawny, little and barn owls, and the greater spotted, lesser spotted and green woodpeckers.|$|E
25|$|Few animals live {{in these}} areas; birds, mostly, {{such as the}} <b>willow</b> <b>warbler,</b> the meadow pipit, the {{northern}} wheatear, and these rarer ones: the European golden plover, the Eurasian dotterel, the snow bunting, and the Lapland longspur. The willow ptarmigan is relatively common, whereas the rock ptarmigan is found only on the highest peaks. For many of these species, Fulufjället is the southernmost part of their range in Sweden.|$|E
40|$|Executive Summary To {{achieve the}} goals {{set forth in}} the American Woodcock Conservation Plan, {{published}} in 2008, the Wildlife Management Institute and its partnering agencies and organizations have launched four regional habitat initiatives in the primary breeding range of the American woodcock, which spans eastern North America from Atlantic Canada to the Great Lakes. Since the 1960 s the woodcock population has fallen by about 1. 2 percent each year, largely because the birds’ preferred habitat – young, brushy forest – has dwindled. Many states now classify the woodcock as a “species of greatest conservation need. ” Conservation biologists consider the woodcock to be an “umbrella species,” which means that creating habitat for woodcock simultaneously helps more than 50 other kinds of wildlife – including many species whose populations also have fallen – that need young forest during part or all of their life cycles. In carrying out the regional initiatives, teams of experienced biologists provide public and private landowners with technical advice on how best to create young forest. They work to build and strengthen partnerships between and among federal and state natural resource agencies, wildlife and land-use organizations, foresters and forest-products companies, and owners of woodlands both large and small. Using the latest scientific techniques, they monitor woodcock, including the response of local populations to improvements and increases in habitat. More than 50 new Demonstration Areas (described in Part II of this publication) showcase habitatmanagement techniques while providing thousands of acres of young forest where woodcock can feed, breed, and rear their young. Clearly, the many partners in the American Woodcock Conservation Plan are making progress toward reversing the woodcock’s population decline. The challenges are great: To restore the species’ population to 1970 s levels, we must add more than 20 million acres of young forest to the current landscape. In the near future, partners plan to start additional regional habitat initiatives in the United States and Canada within the woodcock’s breeding range, migration corridors, and wintering ranges. As we work to reverse the woodcock’s population decline, we help wild animals, both uncommon and abundant, that share the habitat: reptiles and amphibians, birds, and mammals. Some of the many species that benefit from creating and restoring young forest are snowshoe hare, New England cottontail, bobcat, white-tailed deer, ruffed grouse, whip-poor-will, golden-winged <b>warbler,</b> <b>willow</b> flycatcher, indigo bunting, box turtle, bog turtle – as well as a host of insects and plants. Meeting the habitat goals {{set forth in the}} American Woodcock Conservation Plan requires nothing less than re-educating North Americans to understand that creating and perpetually renewing young forest is necessary for safeguarding our continent’s fascinating and valuable biodiversity...|$|R
25|$|Among the birdlife {{which can}} be seen at Cors Caron are buzzard, {{peregrine}} falcon, merlin, Eurasian sparrowhawk and hen harrier. There have also been rare sightings of Montagu's harrier. The reserve provides a habitat for the endangered red kite. Once nearly extinct, the bird of prey has made a dramatic resurgence in the area. The wetlands attract a variety of wild fowl such as the teal, curlew, and water rail. Snipe, red grouse, tree pipit, grasshopper warbler and whinchat can be seen more in the drier areas and the common redstart and <b>willow</b> <b>warbler</b> nest in the willow scrub.|$|E
25|$|Where bracken is {{dominant}} it excludes most specialist heathland/moorland {{bird species}} of conservation concern, {{although there are}} a few species that may benefit from a certain proportion of bracken. Deeper bracken stands provide a good food site for many resident or breeding birds, such as threatened ground-nesting species skylark, yellowhammer, curlew and lapwing. Some British birds such as the whinchat and the nightjar use bracken as their preferred habitats. The nightjar may lay its eggs on the bare ground under the bracken. The skylark often nests in bracken and uses it for cover. Small stands of bracken provide nesting, feeding and roosting habitat for a variety of smaller birds, including the <b>willow</b> <b>warbler</b> (which will also use bracken to construct its nest), the tree pipit, the yellowhammer, the ring ouzel, the woodcock and the twite.|$|E
25|$|Research using {{mathematical}} modelling is indeed demonstrating that predation can indeed stabilize lumps of very similar species. <b>Willow</b> <b>warbler</b> and chiffchaff and other very similar warblers {{can serve as}} an example. The idea {{is that it is}} also a good strategy to be very similar to a successful species or have enough dissimilarity. Also trees in the rain forest can serve as an example of all high canopy species basically following the same strategy. Other examples of nearly identical species clusters occupying the same niche were water beetles, prairie birds and algae.The basic idea is that there can be clusters of very similar species all applying the same successful strategy and between them open spaces. Here the species cluster takes the place of a single species in the classical ecological models.|$|E
25|$|Also {{nearby is}} Beeston Common, {{consisting}} of 24.7 hectares/61 acres of grassland, heath, marsh, fen and secondary woodland. The common {{was made a}} Site of Special Scientific Interest/SA6 in the year 2000 and is habitat {{for a wide range}} of mammals, birds, and insects. There are some forty species of rare flowering plants, and fourteen species of British orchids have been recorded on the common due to its special soil conditions. With such a variety of flowers the site is attractive to butterflies. Twenty-six species have been regularly recorded, including green hairstreak, brown argus and Essex skipper. Kingfisher and heron are also visitors to the pond, and no fewer than 19 species of dragonfly/damselfly have been observed. The bird life of the common includes varieties such as chiffchaff, <b>willow</b> <b>warbler,</b> blackcap, common whitethroat, lesser whitethroat, reed warbler and occasionally sedge and grasshopper warblers. Nightjars are occasionally heard. Foxes and muntjac deer along with smaller mammals such as water shrew, field voles, and harvest mice are present. Adders, slowworms and common lizards can also be found on the common.|$|E
500|$|Although pairs stay {{together}} during the breeding season and polygamy is uncommon, {{even if the}} male and female return to the same site in the following year there is no apparent recognition or fidelity. Interbreeding with other species, other than those formerly considered as subspecies of P. collybita, [...] is rare, but a few examples are known of hybridisation with the <b>willow</b> <b>warbler.</b> Such hybrids give mixed songs, but the latter alone is not proof of interspecific breeding.|$|E
500|$|When not singing, {{the common}} {{chiffchaff}} {{can be difficult}} to distinguish from other leaf warblers with greenish upperparts and whitish underparts, particularly the <b>willow</b> <b>warbler.</b> However, that species has a longer primary projection, a sleeker, brighter appearance and generally pale legs. Bonelli's warbler (P. bonelli) might be confused with the common chiffchaff subspecies tristis, but it has a plain face and green in the wings. The common chiffchaff also has rounded wings in flight, and a diagnostic tail movement consisting of a dip, then sidewards wag, that distinguishes it from other Phylloscopus warblers and gives rise to the name [...] "tailwagger" [...] in India.|$|E
500|$|The {{goldcrest}} feeds in trees, frequently foraging on the undersides {{of branches}} and leaves. This {{is in contrast}} to the common firecrest, which mainly exploits the upper surface of branches in coniferous habitat and of leaves in deciduous trees. In winter, flocks of goldcrests cover a given distance at only one-third of the speed of common firecrests, taking the smallest prey items ignored by their relative. The differences in behaviour are facilitated by subtle morphological differences; firecrests have broader bills with longer rictal bristles (which protect a bird's eye from food items it is trying to capture), and these features reflect the larger prey taken by the species. The firecrest's less forked tail may reflect its longer episodes of hovering while hunting. Firecrests forage more often while on foot, and have a foot better adapted for perching, whereas the goldcrest's longer hind toe reflects its habit of moving vertically along branches while feeding. It also has deep furrows in the soles of its feet capable of gripping individual needles, while firecrests have a smoother surface. The goldcrest has much the same range and habitat preference as the common chiffchaff, and {{there is some evidence that}} high breeding densities of the kinglet depress the population of the warbler, although the converse is not true. There is no evidence that the species compete for territories, and in any case the chiffchaff is 50% heavier than the goldcrest. Nevertheless, there are 1.5million breeding pairs of goldcrests in Finland, compared with 0.4million breeding pairs of chiffchaffs, and only the kinglet has increased in numbers as the area of spruce woodland in the country has expanded. The goldcrest may be out-competing the warbler for food, especially as the larger bird faces more competition from other insectivores, including other Phylloscopus warblers. Both birds occur in similar forests, but the chiffchaff is found within [...] of the forest edge, with the goldcrest breeding deeper in the woodland. Nevertheless, there is no conclusive evidence that the decline of the chiffchaff subspecies Phylloscopus collybita abietinus in parts of Finland is due to competition with the <b>willow</b> <b>warbler</b> and goldcrest.|$|E
2500|$|The {{western edge}} of Coimbra is covered by the Reserva Natural do Paul de Arzila (Arzila Swamp Natural Reserve), which is {{designated}} both as a Special Protection Zone (...) and Special Conservation Zone (...) , coincident with the civil parish of Arzila (sometimes {{referred to as the}} Paul de Arzila or marsh of Arzila). It is a wetland that has sheltered migratory birds, and supports other animal and plant species; this has included predominantly avian species, such as the: Eurasian reed warbler (Acrocephalus scirpaceus), sedge warbler (Acrocephalus schoenobaenus), melodious warbler (Hippolais polyglotta), <b>willow</b> <b>warbler</b> (Phylloscopus trochilus), little bittern (Ixobrychus minutus), great reed warbler (Acrocephalus arundinaceus), and the Savi's warbler (Locustella luscinioides). The 482 hectare area, under threat from industrial, residential and agricultural pollution, expansion of aquatic plants and eutrophication, has forced the governmental reorganization of land use in order to promote models of sustainability, and rural use that does not affect the migratory and aquatic bird populations.|$|E
