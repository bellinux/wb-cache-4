60|$|<b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>happened?</b> Why, he was {{rolled over}} {{on to his}} feet so gently that he just gasped with surprise. It didn't seem {{possible}} that such a great paw could be so gentle.|$|E
60|$|Oh, dear! <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>happened?</b> A wasp {{flew out}} and stung her lips; then both wasp and box vanished, and May {{was left to}} cry alone, with a sharp pain in the lips that said the unkind words.|$|E
60|$|Not {{knowing what}} to do the poor magpie had to agree, and flying back, with a heavy heart, he threw one of his young ones out of the nest. The fox seized it in his mouth and ran off in triumph, while the magpie, though deeply grieved for the loss of his little one, found some comfort in the thought that only a bird of {{extraordinary}} wisdom would have dreamed of saving the rest by the sacrifice of the one. But <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>happened?</b> Why, a few days later, Michael the fox might have been seen sitting under the very same tree, and a dreadful pang shot through the heart of the magpie as he peeped at him from a hole in the nest.|$|E

6000|$|... 'A baddish {{state of}} things, eh, doctor!' said Charles. 'Well, <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> this lady proposes? To set off forthwith, both of us, {{to take charge}} of him. <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of that, Dr. Mayerne?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Say, if you haven't {{taken any}} of Gumley's pills you don't know what you've missed," [...] went on Spud, {{with a wink}} at the others. [...] "Why, {{there was a man}} over in Rottenberg who was flat on his back with half a dozen fatal diseases. The doctors gave him just three days to live,--three days, think of it! His wife nearly cried her eyes out. Then along came this Gumley man with a trunk full of his Red Pills for Red-Blooded People. He didn't exactly know if the dying man was red-blooded or not, but he took a chance and gave the fellow sixteen pills, four after breakfast, four after dinner, four after supper and four on retiring, and the next day, <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>happened?</b> That man {{got up and went to}} work, and he's been at his Job ever since." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>happened</b> this morning? Two wedding-presents arrived. The {{first was}} a very nice fish slice and fork in a case. It was from dear old Mrs. Jones Beyrick, on whom we really had no claim whatever. We all think it so kind of her, and such a nice fish-slice. The other was a {{beautiful}} travelling-bag from Uncle Arthur. Stamped in gold upon it were the letters M.C., I said, 'Oh, what a pity! They have put the wrong initials.' That made mamma laugh. I suppose one soon gets used to it. Fancy how you would feel if it were the other way about, and you changed your name to mine. They might call you Selby, but you would continue to feel Crosse. I didn't mean that for a joke, but women make jokes without intending it. The other day the curate drove up in his donkey-cart, and mother said, 'Oh, what a nice tandem!' I think that she meant to say 'turn- out'; but papa said it was the neatest thing he had heard for a long time, so mamma is very pleased, but I am sure that she does not know even now why it should be so funny.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{occasion}} {{seems to}} bring that something out," [...] the lawyer remarked. [...] "When I proposed the separation, and mentioned my reasons, I expected to find some difficulty in persuading Mrs. Presty {{to give up the}} adventurous journey with her daughter and her grandchild. I reminded her that she had friends in London who would receive her, and got snubbed for taking the liberty. 'I know that as well as you do. Come along--I'm ready to go with you.' It isn't agreeable to my self-esteem to own it, but I expected to hear her say that she would consent to any sacrifice for the sake of her dear daughter. No such clap-trap as that passed her lips. She owned the true motive with a superiority to cant which won my sincerest respect. 'I'll do anything,' she said, 'to baffle Herbert Linley and the spies he has set to watch us.' I can't tell you how glad I was that she had her reward on the same day. We were too late at the station, and we had to wait for the next train. And <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>happened?</b> The two scoundrels followed us instead of following Mrs. Linley! They had inquired no doubt at the livery stables where we hired the carriage--had recognized the description of us--and had taken the long journey to London for nothing. Mrs. Presty and I shook hands at the terminus the best friends that ever traveled together with the best of motives. After that, I think I deserve another glass of wine." ...|$|E
3000|$|The {{second phase}} of {{fieldwork}} was conducted in 2011 by an anthropologist and included eight interviews centred on the contemporary scientific publications on moths, reindeer and mountain birches (e.g. Klemola et al. 2003, Klemola 2009, Tømmervik et al. 2009, Ammunét 2011). The results put forward in these publications were presented in popular form to the herders, who were asked key questions such as: <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> if outbreaks of both autumnal and winter moth become more common as the climate gets warmer? <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> {{about the impact of}} global warming and reindeer on the growth of birch trees? <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of the future of reindeer herding? <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of the future of the mountain birch forests in your area?
