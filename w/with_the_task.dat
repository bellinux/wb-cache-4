5|$|By 536, he {{was raised}} to the honorary {{consulate}} and the rank of patricius, and held the post of magister militum praesentalis. In that year, {{he was sent to}} North Africa to succeed Solomon as military commander, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>task</b> of suppressing a large-scale mutiny of the Byzantine troops led by Stotzas. His tenure there, described by Procopius, was a thorough success. By appearing conciliatory and paying the arrears, he won over {{a large part of the}} mutinous army. He then defeated the remaining rebels under Stotzas at the Battle of Scalas Veteres in the spring of 537 and stabilized the situation by suppressing another conspiracy amongst his troops (cf. Maximinus) and restoring discipline.|$|E
5|$|Charles II {{returned}} to the throne in 1660 and reinstated the Council of the Marches in 1661, but the castle never recovered from the war. Richard Vaughan, the Earl of Carbery, was appointed president and given £2,000 to renovate the castle, and between 1663 and 1665, a company of infantry soldiers was garrisoned there, overseen by the earl, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>task</b> of safeguarding the money and contents of the castle {{as well as the}} ammunition for the local Welsh militia. The Council of the Marches failed to reestablish itself and was finally disbanded in 1689, bringing an end to Ludlow Castle's role in government. Uncared for, the condition of the castle rapidly deteriorated.|$|E

5|$|Each of the valid Band1 {{permutations}} can {{be expanded}} (completed) into a specific number of solutions with the Band2,3 permutations.

We are still left <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>task</b> of identifying and calculating the size of each equivalence class. Further progress requires the dexterous application of computational techniques to catalogue (classify and count) the permutations into equivalence classes.|$|E

The educational practice, observed at the College of St Omer, of dividing a class into Romans and Carthaginians continued long after the migration to Stonyhurst but is not employed today; each pupil would be pitched against an opponent <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>task</b> of picking up on the other's mistakes {{in an attempt to}} score points.|$|E

5|$|Even {{though some}} of his {{soldiers}} came within 60 meters of the pillbox, after 19 of them (over a third) were killed and the sun began rising in the horizon, Kotzer decided to retreat, unable to receive official permission due to communication problems. He ordered all of his troops to collect the wounded and any weapons they could carry, helping <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>task</b> himself. The dead were left in the field, including the medics (not a single medic survived). The injured were brought under fire into the wadi and at about 07:00 the force {{made its way to}} an unoccupied two-storey building on the east bank. After the Egyptians started shelling the building with mortars, Kotzer's company began to move towards Gan Yavne.|$|E
5|$|He {{became a}} member of Institut International de la Paix in 1913. He was a {{consultant}} for the Norwegian Nobel Institute from 1904 to 1913, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>task</b> of examining proposed candidates for the Nobel Peace Prize. From 1918 to 1942 he served on the Norwegian Nobel Committee. In 1931, he gave the Award Ceremony Speech for the Nobelists Jane Addams and Nicholas Murray Butler, but was absent in the decisive meeting in 1936 that awarded the Nobel Peace Prize to Carl von Ossietzky. He was also absent while serving as Minister of Foreign Affairs, not wishing to combine the two roles. He returned briefly afterwards, before leaving again in 1942. Another reason for his inactivity was that he had not lived in Norway since 1940, but either way the Prize was not awarded in any of the years from 1939 to 1943.|$|E
5|$|In 1914, the Governor of British East Africa {{requested}} {{assistance to}} deal with the German forces in German East Africa and the problem was handed to the India Office, which assembled two forces and shipped them to his aid.

5|$|In 1943, Ramsey was {{approached}} by Robert Oppenheimer and Robert Bacher, who asked him to join the Manhattan Project. Ramsey agreed to do so, but {{the intervention of the}} Project director, Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves Jr., was necessary in order to prise him away from the Secretary of War's office. A compromise was agreed to, whereby Ramsey remained on the payroll of the Secretary of War, and was merely seconded to the Manhattan Project. In October 1943, Group E-7 of the Ordnance Division was created at the Los Alamos Laboratory with Ramsey as group leader, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>task</b> of integrating the design and delivery of the nuclear weapons being built by the laboratory.|$|E
5|$|In 1946, Suslov {{was made}} {{a member of the}} Orgburo, and {{immediately}} became the Head of the Foreign Policy Department of the Central Committee. Within a year, Suslov was appointed Head of the Central Committee Department for Agitation and Propaganda. He also became a harsh critic of the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee in the post-war years. In 1947 Suslov was transferred to Moscow and elected to the Central Committee Secretariat; he would retain this seat {{for the rest of his}} life. Suslov had the full confidence of Stalin, and in 1948, he was entrusted <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>task</b> of speaking on behalf of the Central Committee before a solemn meeting on the twenty-fourth anniversary of Vladimir Lenin's death. From September 1949 to 1950 he was editor-in-chief of the central Party daily Pravda.|$|E
5|$|In the {{long-range}} reconnaissance role, the SASR typically operates in small patrols of {{between five and}} six operators <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>task</b> of infiltrating enemy-held territory and providing intelligence on enemy activities and capabilities. During such tasks the SASR seeks to evade rather than confront the enemy. SASR soldiers also direct fire support including air strikes to destroy enemy installations and disrupt or kill enemy forces whenever possible. SASR reconnaissance patrols can be inserted by air (either by helicopter, parachute or high altitude parachute), land (on foot or by vehicle) or water (including by submarine, small boats, kayaks or diving) and have proved capable of covering long distances and staying concealed in jungle, desert and mountain terrain. SASR patrols may also conduct sabotage and short-duration raids on high-value targets, including headquarters, airfields and communications nodes.|$|E
30|$|The {{observation}} {{demands of}} emergency tasks {{refer to a}} series of demands that the imaging satellite needs to complete <b>the</b> observing <b>tasks</b> due to <b>the</b> temporary needs of users or some emergencies.

30|$|The test {{users were}} then asked to start <b>the</b> <b>tasks</b> for <b>the</b> BOS UI and the ESHL GUI. Since there are three roles in the BOS UI, <b>the</b> <b>tasks</b> were {{organized}} according to the responsibilities of the different roles. The participants were given different roles to complete corresponding tasks on BOS UI. In total, there were 22 <b>tasks</b> for <b>the</b> BOS UI which are listed in Appendix “Tasks for the BOS UI in the experiment”. The ESHL GUI, on the other hand, does not support multiple roles, therefore only 8 tasks were designed for this user interface. These tasks can be found in Appendix “Tasks for the ESHL GUI in the experiment”. In order to prevent test users from having a preconceived prejudice against any of the both user interfaces, the evaluation website was programmed to display <b>the</b> <b>tasks</b> for <b>the</b> two user interfaces in different orders. More specifically, half of the test users started <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>tasks</b> for <b>the</b> BOS UI and another half started <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>tasks</b> for <b>the</b> ESHL GUI, so as to balance potential bias.|$|R
