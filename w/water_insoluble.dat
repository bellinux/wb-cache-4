Due to its porosity, earthenware is susceptible to moisture and creates problems including cracks, breaks and mold growth. Porcelain and stoneware is fired at the highest temperatures between 1200-1400°C or 2192-2552°F. Porcelain clay mixtures are fired to create a non-porous and very hard surface. However, the materials also create a very brittle surface which increases the potential for chips, cracks and breaks.|$|E

5000|$|Pyrolysis or thermal {{decomposition}} of wood {{in a low}} oxygen manner originated prehistorically to produce charcoal.

Pliny the Elder recorded in one of his ten volumes of Natural History the use of wood vinegar as an embalming agent, declaring it superior to other treatments he used. Widely recognized as the father of chemical engineering, another naturalist documentarian Johann Rudolf Glauber outlined in Furni Novi Philosophici [...] the methods to produce wood vinegar during charcoal making.

5000|$|Based on the {{comprehensive}} {{studies of the}} ultrasound effect on mass transport, Kost proposed {{the use of the}} enhanced skin transport in the opposite direction to delivery, for the non-invasive continuous detection of blood analytes. The major focus has been the development of a non-invasive continuous detection of glucose. The first clinical study on diabetic volunteers was published by Kost et al. in Nature Medicine 2000. Since, Kost also proposed a novel approach for a glucose flux continuous biosensor and noninvasive detection of amniotic fluid for prenatal testing. Additional applications studied by Kost are the use of ultrasound for on-demand targeted delivery of drugs from liposomes, combined ultrasonic and enzymatic debridement of necrotic eschars and the use of ultrasound for more efficient cancer gene therapy. Nowdays, he study gene therapy approach for the treatment of psoriasis. The focus in these studies is on the effect of ultrasound on transport through tissues of no viral carriers developed by Kost complexed with miRNA. In addition to his studies on responsive controlled release systems: pH sensitive, glucose sensitive and calcium sensitive drug delivery Kost also developed a novel injectable delivery system to provide the body with a steady supply of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor. The system is based on the principle that a <b>water</b> <b>insoluble</b> polymer, dissolved in a biocompatible solvent, will participate upon contact with physiological fluids.In 2012 a collaborative project entitled “Bio-inspired Nano-carriers for Sub-Cellular Targeted Therapeutics” of eleven research groups from Ben-Gurion University, Weizmann Institute of Science and The Hebrew University, led by Prof. Kost was approved in the framework of the National 5-year Nano-Science and Technology Program.
