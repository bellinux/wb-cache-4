One {{of the most interesting}} methods used for biometric protection of computer system (and other objects) is speech parameters extraction, analysis and recognition. Problem under consideration is concentrated on methods showing, how to distinguish between voices of particular people and how to do it independent on the text pronounced by recognized person. Methods used for this purpose are complementary ones in comparison with widely used speech recognition goals, where <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>understood</b> the merit content of the utterance disregarding individual features of the voices of different speakers taken into account. The paper shows general problems related to biometric speaker identification and gives general outline, how to use voice as a key for guarded systems.
