After declining from 1990 through 1992, the private equity industry began to increase in size raising approximately $20.8 billion of investor commitments in 1992 and reaching a high-water mark in 2000 of $305.7 billion, outpacing the growth of almost every other asset class.|$|E

Bodies with large temperature differences transfer heat faster than bodies with lower temperature differences.|$|E
25|$|The musical forms {{encountered}} in Visigothic/Mozarabic chant present {{a number of}} analogies {{with those of the}} Roman rite. For example, a comparable distinction exists between antiphonal and responsorial singing. And Visigothic/Mozarabic chant may be seen to make use of three styles: syllabic, neumatic and melismatic, much as in Gregorian chant. In the following descriptions of the principal musical items in both the Visigothic/ Mozarabic Office and Mass, some of these analogies <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>discussed</b> further. The items from the Mass are presented here in the appropriate liturgical order.|$|E
25|$|Bridge 15 {{was built}} ca. 1910 as a {{replacement}} for a wooden bridge formerly at the same location. During this time, the Third Welland Canal was still in use, however the need for expansion of the canal had been recognized. Accordingly, any new bridges were being constructed to standards which were expected to apply to the Fourth Welland Canal, which would not be completed until 1932. As <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>discussed</b> later in this article, these standards were not set high enough and this fact would make the swing bridge a serious hazard to navigation decades down the road.|$|E

25|$|In {{the latter}} part of the twentieth century, {{research}} trends shifted to more intense study of spaces like manifolds which are locally well understood (being locally homeomorphic to Euclidean space) but have complicated global behavior. By this it is meant that although the basic point-set topology of manifolds is relatively simple (as manifolds are essentially metrizable according to most definitions of the concept), their algebraic topology is far more complex. From this modern perspective, the stronger property of local path connectedness turns out to be more important: for instance, in order for a space to admit a universal cover it must be connected and locally path connected. Local path connectedness <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>discussed</b> as well.|$|E
