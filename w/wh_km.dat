40|$|In this work, the {{prospects}} of available and new battery technologies for battery electric vehicles (BEVs) are examined. Five selected battery technologies are assessed on battery performance and cost in the short, medium and long term. Driving cycle simulations are carried out to assess {{the influence of the}} batteries on the energetic, environmental and economic performance of BEVs in the medium term. Well-to-wheel energy consumption and emissions of BEVs are lowest for lithium-ion batteries; 314 - 374 <b>Wh</b> <b>km</b> - 1 and 76 - 90 gCO 2 eq km - 1 (assuming 593 gCO 2 kWh - 1 for European electricity mix), compared to 450 - 760 <b>Wh</b> <b>km</b> - 1 and 150 - 170 gCO 2 eq km - 1 for petrol and diesel cars. The total driving costs are lowest for ZEBRA batteries (0. 43 - 0. 62 $ km - 1). But, only if ZEBRA batteries attain a very low cost of 100 $ kWh - 1 and driving ranges are below 200 km, BEVs become cost competitive to diesel cars. For all batteries, it remains a challenge to simultaneously meet requirements on specific energy, specific power, efficiency, cycle life, lifetime, safety and costs in the medium or even long term. Only lithium-ion batteries could possibly attain all conditions in the medium term. Batteries that do not contain lithium have best perspectives to attain low costs. © 2012 Elsevier B. V.
