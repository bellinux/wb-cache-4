5|$|The {{effect of}} {{population}} density on sexual selection for convict cichlids has been studied. When nest density was greater, the females {{tended to be}} larger, which is more accurately explained by density-dependent mate preference and mating competition, as opposed to predation and resource competition. Moreover, as the two nest density regimes were compared, with one high and one low, there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> brood survival between the two; however, the convict cichlids did prefer to breed farther away from each other, not in close proximity. This indicates {{that there are some}} other costs with breeding in an environment with high population density, an example being energy loss because of the resulting increased aggression when guarding territory.|$|E
5|$|In Paynes Prairie, there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> rate of {{infection}} {{between males and}} females, but only 4% of juveniles were infected, compared to 52% of adults. Most species of Capillaria occur in multiple hosts, but A.forresteri has been found only in the marsh rice rat, even though several other small mammals (the round-tailed muskrat, Neofiber alleni; cotton mouse, Peromyscus gossypinus; hispid cotton rat, Sigmodon hispidus; and marsh rabbit, Sylvilagus palustris) occur in Paynes Prairie. The rice rat eats more animal food than any of those, and perhaps A.forresteri has an intermediate host that is not eaten by the other species. A.forresteri is markedly more prevalent in the wet season (spring) than the dry season (autumn), perhaps because rainfall patterns influence the habits of the rice rat in some way. One possibility is that the intermediate host is an earthworm or other oligochaete worm that moves to the surface when it rains.|$|E

25|$|Another {{follow-up}} {{study examined the}} extent to which the statistical information learned during this type of artificial grammar learning feeds into knowledge that infants may already have about their native language.

This finding suggests that even pre-linguistic infants are able to integrate the statistical cues they learn in a laboratory into their previously-acquired knowledge of a language. In other words, once infants have acquired some linguistic knowledge, they incorporate newly acquired information into that previously-acquired learning.|$|E

25|$|Tendonectomy {{involves}} {{cutting the}} deep digital flexor tendon of each claw, {{resulting in the}} cat being unable to move its distal phalanges. Without the ability to expose its claws, the cat is unable to wear down or groom its claws. For this reason, the cat subsequently requires regular nail clippings to prevent its claws from growing into its paw pads. A 1998 {{study published in the}} Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association comparing cats undergoing onychectomy to cats undergoing tendonectomy found that, although the cats undergoing tendonectomy appeared to suffer less pain immediately post-operatively, there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> postoperative lameness, bleeding, or infection between the two groups. A 2005 study found no evidence that tendonectomy is less painful than onychectomy. The American Veterinary Medical Association and the Canadian Veterinary Medical Association explicitly do not recommend this surgery as an alternative to declawing.|$|E
25|$|Concern {{regarding}} the immunogenicity of IPS cells arose in 2011 when Zhou et al. performed a study involving a teratomaformation assay and demonstrated that IPS cells produced an immune response {{strong enough to}} cause rejection of the cells. When a similar procedure was performed on genetically equivalent ES cells however, Zhou et al. found teratomas, which indicated that the cells were tolerated by the immune system. In 2013, Araki et al. attempted to reproduce the conclusion obtained by Zhou et al. using a different procedure. They took cells from a chimera that had been grown from IPSC clones and a mouse embryo, this tissue was then transplanted into syngenic mice. They conducted a similar trial using ES cells instead of IPSC clone and compared the results. Findings indicate that there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> the immunogenic response produced by the IPS cells and the ES cells. Furthermore, Araki et al. reported little or no immunogenic response for both cell lines. Thus, Araki et al. was unable {{to come to the}} same conclusion as Zhou et al.|$|E
25|$|Another study {{examined}} the incorporation of music with therapeutic upper extremity exercises on pain perception in stroke victims. Over the course of eight weeks, stroke victims participated in upper extremity exercises (of the hand, wrist, and shoulder joints) in conjunction {{with one of the}} three conditions: song, karaoke accompaniment, and no music. Patients participated in each condition once, according to a randomized order, and rated their perceived pain immediately after the session. Results showed that although there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> pain rating across the conditions, video observations revealed more positive affect and verbal responses while performing upper extremity exercises with both music and karaoke accompaniment. Nayak et al. examined the combination of music therapy with traditional stroke rehabilitation and also found that the addition of music therapy improved mood and social interaction. Participants who had suffered traumatic brain injury or stroke were placed in one of two conditions: standard rehabilitation or standard rehabilitation along with music therapy. Participants received three treatments per week for up to ten treatments. Therapists found that participants who received music therapy in conjunction with traditional methods had improved social interaction and mood.|$|E

2500|$|In most early studies, {{researchers}} did {{not find}} clear RT differences between test items (interlexical homographs or cognates) and control items.

[...] The cognates and control words were either high frequency or low frequency in both English and Spanish. The homographic non-cognates were high frequency in English and low frequency in Spanish or vice versa. The results generally supported the language-selective hypothesis. [...] Even {{though there was a}} significant main effect of word type for the bilingual group, it was mainly caused by the slow response to homographic noncognates which were of low frequency in the target language but of high frequency in the non-target language. Finally, there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> the reaction time between bilinguals and monolinguals, which suggested that the lexical access for bilinguals in this research was restricted to only one language.|$|E

2500|$|According to the 2015 International Encyclopedia of the Social & Behavioral Sciences, sex {{differences}} in aggression {{is one of the}} most robust and oldest findings in psychology. Past meta-analyses in the encyclopedia found males regardless of age engaged in more physical and verbal aggression while small effect for females engaging in more indirect aggression such as rumor spreading or gossiping. It also found males tend to engage in more unprovoked aggression at higher frequency than females. This analysis also conforms with the Oxford Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology which reviewed past analysis which found men to use more verbal and physical aggression with the difference being greater in the physical type. There are more recent findings that show that differences in male and female aggression appear at about two years of age, though the differences in aggression are more consistent in middle-aged children and adolescence. Tremblay, Japel and Pérusse (1999) asserted that physically aggressive behaviors such as kicking, biting and hitting are age-typical expressions of innate and spontaneous reactions to biological drives such as anger, hunger, and affiliation. Girls' relational aggression, meaning non-physical or indirect, tends to increase after age two while physical aggression decreases. There <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> aggression between males and females before two years of age. A possible explanation for this could be that girls develop language skills more quickly than boys, therefore they have better ways of verbalizing their wants and needs.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the amount of homework assigned to sophomore and senior high school students of White Plains High School, White Plains, New York, during a typical school day, and to determine certain parent, teacher and student reactions and expectations relative to those assignments. The subject areas for which homework assignments were studied in detail, and upon which correlations were made, were English, mathematics, social studies, and science. Instruments, specifically developed to correlate responses from three different groups were completed by 159 parents of students involved in the study, 54 teachers of the four subject areas indicated above, 505 sophomores, and 408 seniors. Two hundred and eighteen student response sheets which were electronically rejected because of deviations in responding techniques, were hand scored to obtain responses to specific questions. All other response sheets were tabulated electronically. Because of an insufficient number of responses, data gathered from the parent instruments were not used for statistical analysis. Data obtained from the various instruments were applied to the chi-square test of independence to determine rejection of null hypotheses. In applying data obtained from questionnaires to the chisquare formula, eight hypotheses were rejected and five hypotheses were not rejected. There was insufficient data to allow application of this formula to one of the hypotheses; one hypothesis, therefore, remains untested. The hypotheses that were rejected are:There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> in the amount of time that English teachers think that it takes students to complete assignments and the amount of time that students actually work on those assignments. There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> in the amount of time that mathematics teachers think that it takes students to complete assignments and the amount of time that students actually work on those assignments.
