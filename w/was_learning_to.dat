5|$|He {{was born}} to a Telugu Naidu Family, Karthik began playing cricket {{at the age of}} 10, after a two-year stint living in Kuwait, where his father Krishna Kumar worked. He studied in Fahaheel Al- Watanieh Indian Private School while in Kuwait. Karthik was taught by his father, a first-division cricketer from Chennai. Disappointed that his own career was {{hindered}} when he was forced by his family to put his education first, Karthik's father did not want his son to suffer the same way, and trained him hard from an early age. Karthik honed his reflexes at this young age by having his father throw hard leather balls at him at high speed. Initially he played in the youth teams for Tamil Nadu as a batsman who <b>was</b> <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> keep wicket, and was regarded by Robin Singh as having very high levels of fitness.|$|E

25|$|Upon {{his return}} to Paris, Sargent quickly {{received}} several portrait commissions. His career was launched. He immediately demonstrated the concentration and stamina that enabled him to paint with workman-like steadiness for the next twenty-five years. He filled in the gaps between commissions with many non-commissioned portraits of friends and colleagues. His fine manners, perfect French, and great skill made him a standout among the newer portraitists, and his fame quickly spread. He confidently set high prices and turned down unsatisfactory sitters. He mentored his friend Emil Fuchs who <b>was</b> <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> paint portraits in oils.|$|E

Winehouse and drummer Questlove of The Roots had agreed to form a group but her problems obtaining a visa delayed their working together: Salaam Remi had already created some material with Winehouse {{as part of the}} project. According to The Times, Universal Music pressed her for new material in 2008, and Winehouse as of 2 September had not been near a recording studio.

500|$|One {{of these}} {{paintings}} was St. Jerome in the Wilderness, which Bortolon associates with a difficult period of Leonardo's life, as evidenced in his diary: [...] "I thought I <b>was</b> <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> live; I was only learning to die." [...] Although {{the painting is}} barely begun, the composition can be seen and is very unusual. Jerome, as a penitent, occupies {{the middle of the}} picture, set on a slight diagonal and viewed somewhat from above. His kneeling form takes on a trapezoid shape, with one arm stretched to {{the outer edge of the}} painting and his gaze looking in the opposite direction. J. Wasserman points out the link between this painting and Leonardo's anatomical studies. Across the foreground sprawls his symbol, a great lion whose body and tail make a double spiral across the base of the picture space. The other remarkable feature is the sketchy landscape of craggy rocks against which the figure is silhouetted.|$|E

2500|$|Ever {{since her}} debut, Amuro has been {{classified}} {{as one of}} Japan's most successful idol singers. In an opined article published by The Japan Times, writer Ian Martin encompassed the singer alongside superlatives Yumi Matsutoya, Utada Hikaru, Ayumi Hamasaki, Seiko Matsuda and Hibari Misora as the leading female figures in Japanese music history. Although Martin identified Utada {{as one of the}} [...] "only contemporaries" [...] to break the Western society, he felt Amuro was her [...] "most immediate predecessor," [...] based solely on the fact that [...] " [...] represented a period when Japanese pop <b>was</b> <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> see itself as something that could stand alongside the Western music from which it took many cues." [...] Additionally, Amuro's career has been constantly compared to the likes of Matsuda's, both whom grew up in the idol routine and having achieved commercial resilience ever since; music author Motti Regev regarded the musicians as part of the [...] "golden age of J-Pop", before records declined due to the rise of the digital market in mid-2000s.

2500|$|The {{second section}} opens with another nostalgic soliloquy, which famously {{begins with the}} words: [...] "I wouldn't know what other people are like, but for myself, when I start {{thinking}} about my birthplace, Humulești, about the post holding the flue of the stove, round which mother used to tie a piece of string with tassels {{at the end of}} it, with which the cats played till they plopped, the earthen ledge of the stove that I used to cling to when I <b>was</b> <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> walk with my head held high, the place on top of the stove where I used to hide when we children played at hide-and-seek, as well as other games and delights full of childlike fun and charm, I seem to feel my heart pound with joy even to this moment!" [...] The text goes on to recount his mother's superstitious beliefs, which he himself had come to share. Following Smaranda's indication, Nică believed that blond-haired boys such as himself could invoke sunny weather by playing outside on a rainy day, that various dangers could be cursed away, and that marking the human body with soot or mud meant protection against the evil eye.
