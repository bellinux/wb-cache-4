25|$|American <b>wire</b> <b>gauge</b> (AWG), {{also known}} as the Brown & Sharpe <b>wire</b> <b>gauge,</b> is a {{standardized}} <b>wire</b> <b>gauge</b> system used since 1857 predominantly in North America for the diameters of round, solid, nonferrous, electrically conducting wire. Dimensions of the wires are given in ASTM standard B 258. The cross-sectional area of each gauge is an important factor for determining its current-carrying capacity.|$|E

5000|$|A {{table of}} <b>wire</b> <b>gauges</b> and diameters is shown below. [...] The {{relationship}} of diameter to gauge is piecewise linear, only approximating a (constant-ratio) exponential curve.|$|R
50|$|Twist-on {{connectors}} are {{not often}} used on <b>wire</b> <b>gauges</b> thicker than AWG #10 (5.26 mm²), because such solid wires are too stiff to be reliably connected with this method. Instead, set screw connectors, clamps or crimp connectors are used.|$|R
25|$|Sheet {{metal in}} the U.S. is {{commonly}} measured in gauge (not {{to be confused}} with the American <b>wire</b> <b>gauge),</b> which is derived from weight and thus differs by material.|$|E
25|$|Increasing gauge numbers denote {{decreasing}} wire diameters, {{which is}} similar to many other non-metric gauging systems such as British Standard <b>Wire</b> <b>Gauge</b> (SWG), but unlike IEC 60228, the metric wire-size standard used {{in most parts of the}} world. This gauge system originated in the number of drawing operations used to produce a given gauge of wire. Very fine wire (for example, 30gauge) required more passes through the drawing dies than 0gauge wire did. Manufacturers of wire formerly had proprietary <b>wire</b> <b>gauge</b> systems; the development of standardized wire gauges rationalized selection of wire for a particular purpose.|$|E
25|$|Unshielded {{twisted pair}} (UTP) cables {{are found in}} many Ethernet {{networks}} and telephone systems. For indoor telephone applications, UTP is often grouped into sets of 25 pairs according to a standard 25-pair color code originally developed by AT Corporation. A typical subset of these colors (white/blue, blue/white, white/orange, orange/white) shows up in most UTP cables. The cables are typically made with copper wires measured at 22 or 24 American <b>Wire</b> <b>Gauge</b> (AWG), with the colored insulation typically made from an insulator such as polyethylene or FEP and the total package covered in a polyethylene jacket.|$|E
40|$|The {{feasibility}} of measuring the vibration in the buckets {{of a gas}} turbine under service conditions of speed and temperature was determined by use of a high temperature <b>wire</b> strain <b>gauge</b> cemented to a modified supercharger turbine bucket.

50|$|Six {{different}} {{series are}} available, named after their width in inches. Insulated {{versions of the}} terminals are color-coded to indicate what <b>wire</b> <b>gauges</b> they may be used with. The terminal system consists of tabs (male) and receptacles (female). There are also versions of both tabs and receptacles and ones that can be mounted directly to circuit boards.|$|R
50|$|Test leads {{are usually}} made with finely {{stranded}} wire {{to keep them}} flexible, of <b>wire</b> <b>gauges</b> sufficient to conduct a few amperes of electric current. The insulation is chosen to be both flexible and have a breakdown voltage higher than the voltmeter's maximum input voltage. The many fine strands and the thick insulation make the wire thicker than ordinary hookup wire.|$|R
2500|$|UF-B {{cable is}} [...] "underground feeder" [...] cable, which {{regardless}} of <b>wire</b> <b>gauge</b> {{has a solid}} waterproof grey sheath completely surrounding and filling {{the space between the}} conductors, which still have their individual colors. [...] Other types of armored or metallic cable (types AC and MC) have an aluminum casing that may be used as a ground conductor, for which {{it is not necessary to}} calculate an equivalent <b>wire</b> <b>gauge.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In the UK, {{knitting}} needle 'numbers' are the Standard <b>Wire</b> <b>Gauge</b> designation {{of the wire}} from which metal needles are made. [...] The origin of the numbering system is uncertain but {{it is thought that}} needle numbers are {{based on the number of}} increasingly fine dies that the wire has to be drawn through. [...] In the UK, then, thinner needles thus have a larger number, whereas in the US the opposite [...] applies.|$|E
2500|$|The {{wire drawing}} process is quite simple in concept. The wire is {{prepared}} by shrinking {{the beginning of}} it, by hammering, filing, rolling or swaging, {{so that it will}} fit through the die; the wire is then pulled through the die. As the wire is pulled through the die, its volume remains the same, so as the diameter decreases, the length increases. Usually the wire will require more than one draw, through successively smaller dies, to reach the desired size. The American <b>wire</b> <b>gauge</b> scale is based on this. This can be done on a small scale with a draw plate, or on a large commercial scale using automated machinery. [...] The process of wire drawing changes material properties due to cold working.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Birmingham has a {{long history}} of wire and cable manufacture, the {{industry}} set various international standards for <b>wire</b> <b>gauges</b> and the city became one of the foremost producers of wire for musical instruments in Europe. In 1865 the first successful Transatlantic telegraph cable was made by Webster and Horsfall, who also improved the manufacture of piano wire (giving them a near monopoly).|$|R
50|$|Unlike other Ethernet {{physical}} layers {{that provide}} a single rate such as 10, 100, or 1000 Mbit/s, 10PASS-TS link rate can vary, similar to 2BASE-TL, depending on the copper channel characteristics, such as length, <b>wire</b> diameter (<b>gauge),</b> <b>wiring</b> quality, the number of pairs if the link is aggregated and other factors.|$|R
50|$|While {{there are}} three wires in the basic {{sheathed}} cable, in the United States it is referred to by its gauge {{and the number of}} the insulated (non-ground wires). Thus, 14-2 ("fourteen two") describes 14 <b>gauge</b> <b>wires</b> (black, white, ground). 12-2 describes thicker <b>wire,</b> 12 <b>gauge.</b> These types of cable are used for most (single pole) switches and receptacles.|$|R
50|$|Needle <b>wire</b> <b>gauge</b> {{was derived}} from the Stubs Iron <b>Wire</b> <b>Gauge.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Stubs Iron <b>Wire</b> <b>Gauge</b> system (also {{known as}} the Birmingham <b>Wire</b> <b>Gauge</b> and not the same as, though similar to, the Stubs Steel <b>Wire</b> <b>Gauge)</b> is used to specify {{thickness}} or diameter of metal wire, strip, and tube products. The Stubs system was the first <b>wire</b> <b>gauge</b> recognized as a standard by any country when Great Britain adopted it in 1884; though nearly obsolete, {{it is the only}} <b>wire</b> <b>gauge</b> recognized in the United States through an Act of Congress.|$|E

50|$|Chicken wire, or poultry netting, is a mesh of wire {{commonly}} used to fence poultry livestock, such as chickens, in a run or coop. It is made of thin, flexible galvanized steel wire, with hexagonal gaps. Available in 1 inch (about 2.5 cm) diameter, 2 inch (about 5 cm) and 1/2 inch (about 1.3 cm), chicken wire is available in various <b>wire</b> <b>gauges</b> usually 19 gauge (about 1 mm <b>wire)</b> to 22 <b>gauge</b> (about 0.7 mm wire). Chicken wire is occasionally used to build inexpensive cages for small animals (or to protect plants and property from animals) though the thinness and zinc content of galvanized wire may be inappropriate for animals prone to gnawing and will not keep out predators.|$|R
50|$|General-purpose, {{high-carbon}} steel, drawn {{music wire}} (such as ASTM A228) is manufactured in both inch and metric music <b>wire</b> <b>gauges</b> (m.w.g.) in diameters {{as small as}} 0.15 mm up to 4.8 mm (0.006 to 0.192 inch). A small number of companies produce the tough, high tensile polished wire intended for limited music instrument markets, which is manufactured from steel of a specific composition by cold drawing. Unlike many other forms of wire, piano wire has no twist and is not formed from bundles of smaller-diameter wires.|$|R
40|$|A {{vibrating}} <b>wire</b> strain <b>gauge</b> {{capable of}} measuring strains in concrete elements to an accuracy of better than 0. 5 με is presented. This offers some advantages over conventional electrical resistance gauges, the quoted accuracy {{of which is}} typically 3 με, and which are often considered unsuitable for concrete because of their inability to span cracks. While vibrating <b>wire</b> <b>gauges</b> are potentially more accurate, they are prone to significant errors because of temperature changes. In the purpose-built gauge described here, temperature correction is achieved using an unstrained reference gauge. The vibration data are analysed using a moving-window Fourier transformation {{in order to identify}} and remove the geometrically nonlinear portion of the response. The resulting system is accurate, economical and easy to use. The gauges have been used to study the behaviour of cracked concrete specimens. Typical results are presented and discussed. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd...|$|R

50|$|The {{terminal}} {{consists of}} a spring-loaded metallic pincher which opens when the level is pressed, and when released will tightly grip the conductor which has been inserted into it. This type of terminal is popular {{because it does not}} require any special connector to be applied {{to the end of the}} wire; instead the wire is simply stripped of insulation on its end and inserted into the terminal. This terminal may be used with a variety of <b>wire</b> <b>gauges</b> as well as with either solid core or stranded wires.|$|R
5000|$|A wire is a single, usually cylindrical, {{flexible}} strand or rod of metal. Wires {{are used}} to bear mechanical loads or electricity and telecommunications signals. Wire is commonly formed by drawing the metal {{through a hole in}} a die or draw plate. <b>Wire</b> <b>gauges</b> come in various standard sizes, as expressed in terms of a gauge number. The term wire is also used more loosely to refer to a bundle of such strands, as in [...] "multistranded wire", which is more correctly termed a wire rope in mechanics, or a cable in electricity.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development and}} use of a vibrating <b>wire</b> strain <b>gauge</b> for measuring very small strains in concrete elements. Conventional electrical resistance gauges are inadequate for this application because they do not provide sufficient resolution and are difficult to attach to concrete specimens. Vibrating <b>wire</b> <b>gauges</b> are more sensitive, but are prone to significant errors due to temperature changes. In the purpose-built gauges described here, temperature correction is achieved using an unstrained reference gauge. The vibration data are analysed using a moving-window Fourier transform in order to identify and remove the geometrically non-linear portion of the response. The resulting system is economical, easy to use and gives an accuracy of around 0. 5 microstrain. The gauges have been used to measure the low-amplitude hysteresis characteristics of cracked concrete specimens. This information is required in order to model the non-linear response of a damaged concrete structure to a small load, such as might be applied in a damage assessment technique. Typical results are presented and discussed...|$|R

50|$|SWG {{was fixed}} by Order of Council August 23, 1883.

SWG {{is not to be}} confused with American <b>Wire</b> <b>Gauge</b> which has a similar but not quite interchangeable numbering scheme.|$|E
50|$|The gauge {{numbers in}} SWG (standard <b>wire</b> <b>gauge)</b> and AWG (American <b>wire</b> <b>gauge)</b> reduce as the wire gets larger. Sizing in square {{millimeters}} is also common {{outside of the}} US. Suppliers and manufacturers often specify their cable in strand count. A 189 strand count wire has a cross-sectional area of 1.5 mm2 which equates to 126.7 strands per mm2.|$|E

2500|$|The {{table below shows}} various data {{including}} both {{the resistance of the}} various <b>wire</b> <b>gauges</b> and the allowable current (ampacity) based on a copper conductor with plastic insulation. The diameter information in the table applies to solid wires. Stranded wires are calculated by calculating the equivalent cross sectional copper area. Fusing current (melting wire) is estimated based on 25°C ambient temperature. The table below assumes DC, or AC frequencies equal to or less than 60Hz, and does not take skin effect into account. [...] Turns of wire is an upper limit for wire with no insulation.|$|R
