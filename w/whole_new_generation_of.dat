His essay [...] "About Conducting" [...] (1869) advanced Hector Berlioz's technique of conducting and claimed that conducting was {{a means by which}} a musical work could be re-interpreted, rather than simply a mechanism for achieving orchestral unison. He exemplified this approach in his own conducting, which was significantly more flexible than the disciplined approach of Felix Mendelssohn; in his view this also justified practices that would today be frowned upon, such as the rewriting of scores. Wilhelm Furtwängler felt that Wagner and Bülow, through their interpretative approach, inspired a <b>whole</b> <b>new</b> <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> conductors (including Furtwängler himself).|$|E

His first compositions date from c. 1900 and were pastiches in the style of Mozart (quartets, 1905 album verses for piano). His first quartet was performed in Leipzig in 1908, and his sixth (Opus 12, 1905) in the year 1909. In 1909, his Chamber Symphony in F major (written 1906) won the Frankfurt/Main Mozart prize. From this time onwards, Toch dedicated himself to being a full-time composer. He won the Mendelssohn prize for composition in 1910. In 1913, he was appointed lecturer of both piano and composition at the College of Music in Mannheim. After winning a further five major prizes for his works, he served four years in the army on the Italian Front during World War I. In 1916, he married Lilly Zwack, the daughter of a banker.|$|R
500|$|The Way I See It {{also earned}} Saadiq the highest {{international}} profile of his career. In promoting the album, he broadened his audience demographic and expanded his repertoire as a touring artist.

The Press of Atlantic City wrote that the album [...] "brought in a <b>whole</b> <b>new</b> <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> Saadiq fans, with songs such as '100 Yard Dash' striking a chord with even ironic teenagers." [...] According to Gail Mitchell of Billboard, The Way I See It helped Saadiq reach [...] "the major-market hipster crowd, music supervisors and festival bookers." [...] He also attained a following among Japanese audiences. Saadiq's touring for the album influenced his approach for recording his next album, Stone Rollin', in 2011, as he noted the louder, raw sound and general feeling of performing live. It also continued his partnership with Charles Brungart, who assisted Saadiq in recording Stone Rollin.|$|E

[...] Bunker criticized the promotional methods of the film—instead of granting interviews about the film to the press, John Travolta went on a book tour and signed copies of L. Ron Hubbard's novel. Bunker stated, [...] "When Michael Caine goes around to promote The Cider House Rules, he doesn't tour bookstores and sign copies of John Irving's novel… Through the movie tie-in with the book, kids will send in the card to get their free poster, and eventually be introduced to Dianetics." [...] Scientologist Nancy O'Meara, at the time treasurer of the Foundation for Religious Freedom and currently treasurer of the Scientology-run New Cult Awareness Network, responded to Bunker's statement: [...] "Gimme a break… That's like saying people are going to go see Gladiator and then suddenly find themselves wanting to explore Christianity." ...|$|E

[...] Tania Zeine from ARIA Charts described the track as a [...] "powerful violin ballad with the accompaniment of a large orchestra throughout the remainder." [...] Simon Price from The Independent said that while the original version of [...] "Can't Get You Out of My Head" [...] would be [...] "impossible to improve on," [...] the reworked version [...] "turns it into a pizzicato thriller score."

50|$|A <b>whole</b> <b>new</b> <b>of</b> <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> Pistons and Lakers {{would meet}} as they squared off {{again in the}} 2004 NBA Finals. Los Angeles {{originally}} entered the 2003-04 NBA season {{on a mission to}} win the championship, due to a multi-talented roster featuring 4 NBA superstars: Shaquille O'Neal, Kobe Bryant, Gary Payton, and Karl Malone. Despite trying to meet high expectations and getting off to a promising start, the Lakers suffered through injuries and turmoil throughout the campaign; Malone struggled with a knee injury which he had to have surgery on, and was limited to playing only 42 games. Payton never grew comfortable learning the nuances of head coach Phil Jackson's triangle offense. Finally, O'Neal and Bryant spent the whole season feuding over who was a more valuable player for the Lakers. Nevertheless, Los Angeles finished with a 56-26 record, winning the Pacific Division title {{on the last day of}} the season. Next, the Lakers eliminated the Houston Rockets, San Antonio Spurs, and Minnesota Timberwolves to win the Western Conference crown. The Pistons also struggled through the early part of their season as well. However, their fortunes soon improved vastly thanks to the February acquisition of Rasheed Wallace via trade, and the firm guidance of head coach Larry Brown. Detroit finished with a 54-28 record. Then, they defeated the Milwaukee Bucks, New Jersey Nets, and Indiana Pacers en route to the Eastern Conference title. Just like they had in both 1988 & 1989, the Lakers entered the NBA Finals as the clear favorite to win the championship. Still, the Pistons were not discouraged by their underdog status, stunning Los Angeles with a Game 1 win in L.A. The Lakers pulled out an overtime victory over Detroit in Game 2, thanks to Bryant's game-tying 3-pointer in the final seconds of regulation, enabling L.A. to eventually tie the series. However, as the series shifted to Detroit, the Pistons imposed their will on the Lakers. Their commitment to team basketball and tough, physical defense proved to be insurmountable. L.A.'s title dreams were dashed when Malone reinjured his knee in Game 4, and was unable to suit up for the Lakers in Game 5. The Pistons convincingly won the next 3 games at the Palace of Auburn Hills, and won the series 4-1, capturing their 3rd NBA title overall. At the end of the series, Al Michaels, who was serving as the play-by-play announcer for the NBA on ABC during the finals, observed that even though the Lakers had Hall of Fame players, the Pistons beat L.A. by using players that nobody else wanted. Chauncey Billups, the Pistons' point guard, won the NBA Finals MVP Award. Billups became the first Finals MVP recipient since former Pistons star (and current Pistons GM) Joe Dumars to have won the award before making his first NBA All-Star team. Like Dumars, Billups would eventually go on to make multiple appearances in the NBA All-Star Game.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The {{identification}} and characterization of two M. tuberculosis-specific antigens (ESAT- 6 and CFP- 10) {{has led to}} the development <b>of</b> a <b>whole</b> blood <b>new</b> <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> M. tuberculosis specific diagnostic tests, that have several advantages over tuberculin skin test (TST), in terms of higher specificity, better correlation with surrogate measures of exposure to M. tuberculosis in low-incidence setting, and less cross-reactivity with M. bovis (BCG) vaccine and environmental mycobacteria. The role of these new tests in evaluating post-therapy tuberculosis eradication has not been investigated yet. Aim of this longitudinal study was to determinate changes of response to M. tuberculosis-specific antigens in patients during the standard tuberculosis treatment and to investigate the in vitro effects of tuberculosis drugs on the IFN-γ release. Methods: 23 individuals with active tuberculosis were enrolled and followed over time. They were tested with QuantiFERON TB-Gold (QFT-Gold) at four time points: at diagnosis (t 0), after 3 and 6 months of treatment (t 1 - t 2) {{and at the end of}} the specific treatment (t 3). Results: At baseline all patients were positive by QFT-Gold. At second time-point 17 out of 23 (74 %) were positive, at third time-point 11 of 23 (47 %) were positive, at treatment completion 3 / 23 (13 %) were positive. The conversion to negative response to M. tuberculosis-specific antigens was found in 87 % patients analyzed after successful therapy. Longitudinal QFT-Gold testing shown a significant decrease (p< 0. 001) of IFN-γ response during the therapy. No inhibitory effect on IFN-γ release was noted in vitro for chemotherapy using at concentrations compatible with those achieved in serum of treated patients. We have revealed an inhibitory effect only at concentrations 2 - 3 times greater than those previously tested. Conclusion: A successful therapy for tuberculosis causes a significant decrease of the ESAT- 6 and CFP- 10 response and this data suggest that the QTF-Gold assay may have a role as a tool for evaluating tuberculosis eradication after standard tuberculosis treatment...|$|R
