5|$|All of Van Dormael's films contain surreal elements.

5|$|In 2004, then-presidential {{candidate}} Viktor Yushchenko of Ukraine was poisoned {{with a large}} dose of TCDD. His blood TCDD concentration {{was measured}} 108,000 pg/g of fat, which is the second highest ever measured. This concentration implies a dose exceeding 2mg, or 25 μg/kg of body weight. Also he suffered from chloracne for many years, but again after initial malaise, other symptoms or abnormal laboratory findings <b>were</b> <b>few.</b>|$|E

30|$|In addition, there <b>are</b> <b>fewer</b> {{academics}} claiming any difficulty when sharing, {{and this}} {{could be explained by}} the fact that there <b>are</b> <b>fewer</b> algorithms in their possession and thus a lower number of people who see problems in sharing is natural.|$|R
5|$|It {{is unclear}} whether {{the story of the}} Tree That Owns Itself began with the Weekly Banner article, or if it had been an element of local {{folklore}} prior to that time. The article's author writes that, in 1890, there <b>were</b> <b>few</b> people still living who knew the story.|$|E

5|$|Politics in Texas {{during the}} early 1900s was defined by a spirit of Progressivism. Oil money funded the {{expansion}} of the highway system and the educational system.

5|$|The battleship, {{particularly}} the dreadnought, was the dominant naval weapon of the World War I era. There <b>were</b> <b>few</b> serious challenges at that time. The most significant naval battles of World War I, such as Jutland (May 31, 1916 – June 1, 1916), were fought by battleships and their battlecruiser cousins.|$|E
5|$|A 2004-05 EPA {{study of}} the river rated the water quality 6 out of 100. The study also {{discovered}} that dissolved oxygen levels in the water were low because there <b>were</b> <b>few</b> organisms, poor sediment, and little plant life in the river. Although storm water from residential neighborhoods added dissolved oxygen, it also brought ammonia from fertilizer. The Army Corps of Engineers found that the channeling prevented aquatic life from sustaining itself; few fish naturally spawn in the river because of the cement casing and flume at its mouth.|$|E

5|$|ABA Games' sole developer, Kenta Cho, {{began writing}} {{games as a}} child during the 1980s using the NEC PC-6001 microcomputer, as there <b>were</b> <b>few</b> commercially {{available}} games. After leaving university, Cho contemplated professional games development but ultimately instead joined Toshiba to work in multimedia research and development. He continues to work full-time for Toshiba while running ABA Games as a hobby, working mainly on weekends. Cho is the sole contributor to ABA Games. Lacking musical training, he creates the soundtracks to his games using commercially available, pre-made samples. ABA Games releases a game approximately every six months, with {{the first three months}} spent creating prototypes and the latter three spent refining a finished version.|$|E
5|$|After the election, Roosevelt {{continued}} to promote progressive ideals, a New Nationalism, much to Taft's dismay. Roosevelt attacked his successor's administration, arguing that its guiding principles were {{not that of}} the party of Lincoln, but those of the Gilded Age. The feud continued on and off through 1911, {{a year in which}} there <b>were</b> <b>few</b> elections of significance. Wisconsin Senator La Follette announced a presidential run as a Republican, and was backed by a convention of progressives. Roosevelt began to move into a position for a run in late 1911, writing that the tradition that presidents not run for a third term only applied to consecutive terms.|$|E
5|$|Although court {{entertainments}} <b>were</b> <b>few</b> {{after the}} Prince Consort's death, Beatrice and the Queen enjoyed tableau vivant photography, which was often {{performed at the}} royal residences. Henry, increasingly bored {{by the lack of}} activity at court, longed for employment, and in response, the Queen made him Governor of the Isle of Wight in 1889. However, he yearned for military adventure and pleaded with his mother-in-law to let him join the Ashanti expedition fighting in the Anglo-Asante war. Despite misgivings, the Queen consented, and Henry and Beatrice parted on 6 December 1895; they would not meet again. Henry contracted malaria and was sent home. On 22 January 1896, Beatrice, who was waiting for her husband at Madeira, received a telegram informing her of Henry's death two days earlier.|$|E

5|$|Although {{this was}} a good start, Hastings was not a {{particularly}} well-known barrister, and cases <b>were</b> <b>few</b> and far between. To get around the lack of funds Hastings accepted a pupil, and for the next year Hastings lived almost exclusively off the fees that the pupil paid him. To maintain the appearance of an active and busy chamber Hastings had his clerk borrow papers from other barristers and give them to the pupil to work on, claiming that they were cases of Hastings.|$|E
5|$|Beginning on July9, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center(JTWC) began {{dispatching}} aircraft reconnaissance {{to investigate}} {{an area of}} thunderstorms between Yap State and Koror that had potential to develop into a tropical cyclone. Tracking westward, there <b>were</b> <b>few</b> signs of organization or intensification until July12, when recon found a closed atmospheric circulation within the disturbance, signifying that a tropical depression had developed; JTWC bulletins and warnings commenced accordingly. Upon development, observations indicated that the system was quickly developing in favorable conditions, with initial reconnaissance flights finding a loose eye measuring 160km (100mi) in diameter shortly after classification as a tropical depression. Twelve hours later, the JTWC upgraded the cyclone to tropical storm status, assigning the name Billie.|$|E
5|$|Between 1916—when the {{university}} introduced a Doctorate of Philosophy for research—and 1939, there <b>were</b> <b>few</b> post-graduate students, {{and only one}} or two undergraduates took Arabic in final examinations each year.

Julia Bray, the current holder , was appointed in 2012. She is the 15th Laudian Professor, and the first woman to hold the position.
