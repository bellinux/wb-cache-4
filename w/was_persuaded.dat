5|$|After this, the Tibetan people's {{trade in}} tiger skins became a {{relatively}} more important threat to tigers. The pelts {{were used in}} clothing, tiger-skin chuba being worn by singers and participants in horse racing festivals, and had become status symbols. In 2004, international conservation organizations launched successful environmental propaganda campaigns in China against the Tibetan tiger skin trade. There was outrage in India, where many Tibetans live, and the 14th Dalai Lama <b>was</b> <b>persuaded</b> {{to take up the}} issue. Since then there has been a change of attitude, with some Tibetans publicly burning their chubas.|$|E
5|$|Allen did {{not feel}} suited to working in a {{department}} store, and on his return home took {{a job with the}} stockbroking company David Bevan and Co.
