Alex Tallchief Skibine opined that the case was almost unique, and he did not foresee that it would be significant for other tribes.|$|E

5|$|Jeff Tolbert also {{accepts the}} Slender Man as folkloric and {{suggests}} {{it represents a}} process he calls “reverse ostension.” Ostension in folkloristics {{is the process of}} acting out a folk narrative. According to Tolbert, the Slender Man does the opposite by creating a set of folklore-like narratives <b>where</b> <b>none</b> existed before. It is an iconic figure produced through a collective effort and deliberately modeled after an existing and familiar folklore genre. According to Tolbert, this represents two processes in one: it involves the creation of new objects and new disconnected examples of experience, and it involves the combination of these elements into a body of “traditional” narratives, modeled on existing folklore (but not wholly indebted to any specific tradition).|$|E
5|$|The novel has {{pervasive}} lesbian themes, {{concentrating on}} eroticism and self-discovery. Waters {{was working on}} a PhD dissertation in English literature when she decided to write a story she would like to read. Employing her love for the variety of people and districts in London, she consciously chose an urban setting. As opposed to previous lesbian-themed fiction she had read where the characters escape an oppressive society to live apart from it, Waters chose characters who interact with their surroundings. She has acknowledged that the book imagines a lesbian presence and history in Victorian London <b>where</b> <b>none</b> was recorded. The main character's experiences in the theatrical profession and her perpetual motion through the city allow her to make observations on social conditions while exploring the issues of gender, sexism, and class difference.|$|E

40|$|This paper surveys recent {{findings}} in neuroscience regarding the behavioral relevancy of the precise timing with which real spiking neurons emit spikes.

Additionally, new, more refined methods are finding precisely timed spikes <b>where</b> previously <b>none</b> <b>where</b> found. This line of evidence thus provides additional motivation for researching the computational properties of networks of artificial spiking neurons that compute with more precisely timed spikes...|$|R

The PDO/PGI regimes foster the creation of ethical food markets, predicated on 'local' produce.

In these instances, the 'local' is valorised as inherently 'good' or at least better than produce from an unrestricted, globalised food market.|$|E

25|$|Major {{threats that}} cold seep {{ecosystems}} {{and their communities}} face today are seafloor litter, chemical contaminants and climate change. Seafloor litter alters the habitat, by providing hard substrate <b>where</b> <b>none</b> was available before or by overlying the sediment, inhibiting gas exchange, and interfering with organisms {{on the bottom of}} the sea. Studies of marine litter in the Mediterranean include surveys of seabed debris on the continental shelf, slope, and bathyal plain. In most studies, plastic items accounted for much of the debris, sometimes as much as 90% or more of the total, owing to their ubiquitous use and poor degradability.|$|E
25|$|Within the entropy-coded data, after any 0xFF byte, a 0x00 byte is {{inserted}} by the encoder {{before the next}} byte, so that there {{does not appear to}} be a marker <b>where</b> <b>none</b> is intended, preventing framing errors. Decoders must skip this 0x00 byte. This technique, called byte stuffing (see JPEG specification section F.1.2.3), is only applied to the entropy-coded data, not to marker payload data. Note however that entropy-coded data has a few markers of its own; specifically the Reset markers (0xD0 through 0xD7), which are used to isolate independent chunks of entropy-coded data to allow parallel decoding, and encoders are free to insert these Reset markers at regular intervals (although not all encoders do this).|$|E
25|$|However, this {{reasoning}} breaks down for four keys {{because there are}} sets of keys w, x, y, and z <b>where</b> <b>none</b> of the four has a byte value {{that it does not}} share with {{at least one of the}} other keys. For instance, if the keys have two bytes each, and w, x, y, and z are the four keys that have either zero or one as their byte values, then each byte value in each position is shared by exactly two of the four keys. For these four keys, the hash values computed by tabulation hashing will always satisfy the equation , whereas for a 4-independent hashing scheme the same equation would only be satisfied with probability 1/m. Therefore, tabulation hashing is not 4-independent.|$|E
