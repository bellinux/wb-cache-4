[...] Lee {{explained}} that the concept [...] "to me is about falling back in love <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>thing,</b> with Evanescence, with what I've obsessed over for a decade, longer than that." [...] There were originally many album-title ideas, but Lee said that as the project became more collaborative [...] "it just felt like this is who we are, it's a band. And to have that feeling in the music where the band is so pumped up, {{it was just the}} only title that felt right. It's about falling back in love <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> in a major way."

It was later decided to release two versions of the album: a deluxe edition with all 16 songs and a standard edition with 12.|$|E

You remember that I had an idea that I was going to write the autobiography of a Communist ... There lay the trouble. I had planned to write a journalistic account of a strike. But as I thought of it as fiction the thing got bigger and bigger. It couldn't be that. I've been living <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> for some time now. I don't know how much I have got over, but I have used a small strike in an orchard valley as the symbol of man's eternal, bitter warfare with himself.|$|E

I had always thought an angel came down and sat on your shoulder and whispered in your ear 'dah-dah-dah-DUM.' Never occurred to me that art was something worked out. And suddenly it was skies opening up. As soon as you find out what a leading tone is, you think, Oh my God. What a diatonic scale is – Oh my God! The logic of it. And, of course, what that meant to me was: Well, I can do that. Because you just don't know. You think it's a talent, you think you're born <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>thing.</b> What I've found out and what I believed is that everybody is talented.

The Mayor has a daughter named Clementina, who is secretly in love with the priest.
