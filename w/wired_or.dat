5|$|Despite {{the modest}} {{popularity}} of IBM Token Ring in the 1980s and 1990s, virtually all LANs now use either <b>wired</b> <b>or</b> wireless Ethernet facilities. At the physical layer, most wired Ethernet implementations use copper twisted-pair cables (including the common 10BASE-T networks). However, some early implementations used heavier coaxial cables and some recent implementations (especially high-speed ones) use optical fibers. When optic fibers are used, the distinction {{must be made}} between multimode fibers and single-mode fibers. Multimode fibers {{can be thought of}} as thicker optical fibers that are cheaper to manufacture devices for, but that suffers from less usable bandwidth and worse attenuation – implying poorer long-distance performance.|$|E
25|$|Recently the National Fire Protection Association and ICC {{voted to}} allow for the {{elimination}} of the 30-day inspection requirement so long as the fire extinguisher is monitored electronically. According to NFPA, the system must provide record keeping {{in the form of an}} electronic event log at the control panel. The system must also constantly monitor an extinguisher’s physical presence, internal pressure and whether an obstruction exists that could prevent ready access. In the event that any of the above conditions are found, the system must send an alert to officials so they can immediately rectify the situation. Electronic monitoring can be <b>wired</b> <b>or</b> wireless.|$|E
25|$|Currently most {{operating}} systems support {{a variety of}} networking protocols, hardware, and applications for using them. This means that computers running dissimilar {{operating systems}} can participate in a common network for sharing resources such as computing, files, printers, and scanners using either <b>wired</b> <b>or</b> wireless connections. Networks can essentially allow a computer's operating system to access the resources of a remote computer to support the same functions as it could if those resources were connected directly to the local computer. This includes everything from simple communication, to using networked file systems or even sharing another computer's graphics or sound hardware. Some network services allow the resources of a computer to be accessed transparently, such as SSH which allows networked users direct access to a computer's command line interface.|$|E

500|$|In {{reaction}} {{to the introduction of}} the bikini in Paris, American [...] compromised cautiously by producing their own similar design that included a halter and a midriff-bottom variation. Though size makes all the difference in a bikini, early bikinis often covered the navel. When the navel showed in pictures, it was airbrushed out by magazines like Seventeen. Navel-less women ensured the early dominance of European bikini makers over their American counterparts. By {{the end of the decade}} a vogue for strapless styles developed, <b>wired</b> <b>or</b> bound for firmness and fit, along with a taste for bare-shouldered two-pieces called Little Sinners. But, it was the halterneck bikini that caused the most moral controversy because of its degree of exposure. So much so as bikini designs called [...] "Huba Huba" [...] and [...] "Revealation" [...] were withdrawn from fashion parades in Sydney as immodest.|$|E
2500|$|Photovoltaic (PV) energy {{harvesting}} wireless technology offers significant advantages over <b>wired</b> <b>or</b> solely battery-powered sensor solutions: virtually inexhaustible sources of power {{with little or}} no adverse environmental effects. [...] Indoor PV harvesting solutions have to date been powered by specially tuned amorphous silicon (aSi)a technology most used in Solar Calculators. [...] In recent years new PV technologies have come to the forefront in Energy Harvesting such as Dye Sensitized Solar Cells (DSSC). [...] The dyes absorbs light much like chlorophyll does in plants. [...] Electrons released on impact escape to the layer of TiO2 and from there diffuse, through the electrolyte, as the dye can be tuned to the visible spectrum much higher power can be produced. [...] At [...] a DSSC can provide over [...] per cm².|$|E
2500|$|The user {{interface}} for configuring, troubleshooting {{and working with}} network connections has changed significantly from prior versions of Windows as well. Users can {{make use of the}} new [...] "Network Center" [...] to see the status of their network connections, and to access every aspect of configuration. The network can be browsed using Network Explorer, which replaces Windows XP's [...] "My Network Places". Network Explorer items can be a shared device such as a scanner, or a file share. Network Location Awareness uniquely identifies each network and exposes the network's attributes and connectivity type. Windows Vista graphically presents how different devices are connected over a network in the Network Map view, using the LLTD protocol. In addition, the Network Map uses LLTD to determine connectivity information and media type (<b>wired</b> <b>or</b> wireless). Any device can implement LLTD to appear on the Network Map with an icon representing the device, allowing users one-click access to the device's {{user interface}}. When LLTD is invoked, it provides metadata about the device that contains static or state information, such as the MAC address, IPv4/IPv6 address, signal strength etc.|$|E

50|$|Slackwire or slackrope {{is a type}} of <b>wire</b> <b>or</b> rope walking {{where the}} support is {{flexible}} or 'slack'. The tension on the <b>wire</b> <b>or</b> rope is mainly provided by the weight of the performer and their props. The difference in technique required to maintain balance on a slackwire is that the performer moves the wire under his centre of mass. The flexibility of the <b>wire</b> <b>or</b> rope allows the performer to achieve this.|$|R

2500|$|Alamein {{itself was}} an inconsequential railway {{station on the}} coast. Some [...] to the south lay the Ruweisat Ridge, a low stony ridge that {{nonetheless}} gave excellent observation for many miles over the surrounding desert. [...] {{to the south of}} that lay the Qattara Depression. The line the British chose to defend stretched between the sea and the Qattara Depression, which meant that Rommel could outflank it only by taking a significant detour to the south and crossing the Sahara Desert. The British Army in Egypt recognised this before the war and had the Eighth Army begin construction of several [...] "boxes" [...] (localities with dug-outs and surrounded by minefields and barbed wire), the most developed being around the railway station at Alamein. Most of the [...] "line", however, was just open, empty desert. Lieutenant-General William Norrie (GOC XXX Corps) organised the position and started to construct three defended [...] "boxes". The first and strongest, at El Alamein on the coast, had been partly wired and mined by 1st South African Division. The Bab el Qattara box—some [...] from the coast and [...] south-west of the Ruweisat Ridge—had been dug but had not been <b>wired</b> <b>or</b> mined, while at the Naq Abu Dweis box (on the edge of the Qattara Depression), [...] from the coast, very little work had been done.|$|E
