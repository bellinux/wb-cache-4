5|$|Emily Wilding Davison (11 October 1872– 8 June 1913) was a suffragette {{who fought}} for votes {{for women in the}} United Kingdom in the early twentieth century. A member of the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) and a militant fighter for her cause, she was arrested on nine occasions, went on hunger strike seven times and was force fed on forty-nine occasions. She died after being hit by King George V's horse Anmer at the 1913 Epsom Derby <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> onto the track during the race.|$|E

25|$|Investigators {{discovered}} {{that one of the}} last people to see Paula alive was a man who lived along Harbour Road. He {{was in the midst of}} an argument with his girlfriend <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> by. The man stormed off in a jealous rage shortly thereafter and depending on different statements he made, he went to his shack and spent the evening by himself, or he drove his truck up the travel portion of the trail (where Paula was heading). He lied to police on several occasions and was a person of interest in 1946 and again in 1952 when the case was revisited. Reportedly, he told at least two people that he knew within a hundred feet where Paula was buried but later claimed it was just idle talk. When no evidence was found that a crime had actually been committed, no body was ever discovered, and no forensic clues were identified, this avenue of the investigation ended.|$|E

500|$|For {{the role}} of Constance Welch—the Woman in White—production {{set out to find}} the [...] "perfect actress". Nutter, a fan of The L Word, had watched an episode {{featuring}} actress Sarah Shahi one night during the casting process. He felt she was [...] "really sharp" [...] and a [...] "fine actress", with a [...] "seductive quality about her". Surprised when she came in to audition the following day, he knew she [...] "had the job <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> in the door". Because the scene involving Constance's husband Joseph Welch merely discusses Constance's backstory, the scene hinged on the actors' performances. Seeking a [...] "great actor", Nutter recalled his previous experience working with Steve Railsback, and offered him the role. Other guest stars include Adrianne Palicki as Sam's girlfriend Jessica Moore, and Samantha Smith as Mary Winchester. The latter felt she landed the part due to her joking around with Nutter during the audition.|$|E
500|$|When Powell was 17, {{her father}} died after a long battle with lung cancer. Before he died, he told her {{she would have to}} get a job to support her mother, and {{would not be able to}} go to art school. As her mother wanted her to receive an education, she rented out a room to four {{apprentice}} electricians. In September 1957, Powell gained a place at the Liverpool College of Art. Although studying graphics, she also took lettering classes, as did Lennon. He never had any drawing tools with him, so he constantly borrowed pens and pencils from Powell, who discovered he was only there because other teachers had refused to instruct him. She had an air of respectability and moved in different social circles than her future husband. Lennon and an art school friend, Geoff Mohammed, used to make fun of her by stopping the conversation <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> in the room, saying: [...] "Quiet please! No dirty jokes; it's Cynthia." ...|$|E

2500|$|Minnie was {{designed}} in the fashion of a [...] "flapper" [...] girl. Her main outfit consisted of a short flapper girl dress that often revealed her distinctive patched knickers. [...] In the 1929 cartoon The Karnival Kid, it was also revealed that she wears black stockings which were also fashionable among flapper girls. Her shoes are probably her most distinctive article of clothing. For comedic effect, she wears oversized high heeled pumps that are too big for her feet. Her heels often slip out of her shoes, and she even loses her shoes completely in The Gallopin' Gaucho. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> or danced, the clip clop of her large pumps was usually heard clearly and often went with {{the rhythm of the}} music that was played in the background. Along with Mickey, she was redesigned in 1940. Her hat was replaced with a large bow, and bows were added to her shoes as well. Her eyes were also given more detail. Throughout the forties and fifties, her look and personality became more conservative. [...] Minnie almost always wears red or pink, but in her early appearances, she could be seen wearing a combination of blue, black or green (when not depicted in black and white).|$|E
2500|$|According to an acquaintance, Pillco {{said after}} eight months he still owed a [...] debt on the $12,000 {{he had paid}} to be smuggled into the US, and {{he lived in the}} {{basement}} of a building owned by his employer. One of Shelly's neighbors told reporters that Pillco's stare had made the neighbor feel uncomfortable <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> past him. Shelly's husband sued contractor Bradford General Contractors, which had hired Pillco. The complaint alleged that Shelly would still be alive if the contracting firm had not hired him. Ostroy also sought to hold the owners and management of the building liable for Shelly's murder. According to a New York Post article, among other allegations, the complaint stated that Pillco was an undocumented immigrant...' as were his co-workers, and that [...] "it was in Bradford General Contractors' interest not to have 'police and immigration officials [...] to the job site' because that would have ground their work to a halt". On July 7, 2011, the lawsuit was dismissed by Judge Louis York. The court determined that Ostroy had not established legal grounds to hold the contractor liable, writing [...] "While this court sympathizes with [...] loss, plaintiffs have not presented sufficient legal grounds upon which to hold Bradford... liable for Pillco's vicious crime", and that there was likewise insufficient evidence presented to find that either the building's management agents or its owners [...] "had reason to believe that Pillco was a dangerous person who should not have been allowed to work at the premises" [...] in order to find them vicariously liable. Ostroy was said to be considering an appeal.|$|E
2500|$|Determining {{the cause}} of death was inconclusive, as the severe {{decomposition}} on the body had removed all signs of possible violence from the remains. However, the case is believed to have been a murder, as suicide was eliminated as a possibility of the girl's death. The circumstances of the location of the remains had also sparked suspicion among authorities. Toxicology tests were conducted to see if any drugs or alcohol had been in her system, yet the results were never released. Although the body was found in autumn, she had died in the summer, two to four months previously. This was established by examining traces from insects that were found on the remains. She had an overbite, and some fillings and dental sealants were found on the upper molars with no current cavities. The overbite was not described as extreme, but may have been noticeable, which could be a reliable feature depicted in her facial reconstruction. The estimated height was between 4'10" [...] and 5'4", the victim being between fifteen and twenty-one years old and weighing between 110 to 135 pounds, at an [...] "average frame". Examiners believe she was either white or Hispanic, although Native American and Asian races cannot be ruled out. She also may have been biracial. Other physical characteristics included a healed rib fracture and being pigeon toed or knock-kneed, which may have been noticeable <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>walked,</b> as her feet were slanted inward. She also suffered from spina bifida occulta, but may have been unaware of the condition. To obtain DNA information, her femur was transported to the University of Texas.|$|E
