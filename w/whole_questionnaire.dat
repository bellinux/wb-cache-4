The questionnaire survey had 1, 000 respondents – Czech households using a wood-based house. The survey was conducted separately in each region of the Czech Republic (40 – 100 questionnaires per region). The results were evaluated separately for each region and for the Czech Republic as a <b>whole.</b> <b>Questionnaires</b> consisted of four thematic groups of questions. This paper deals with processing and evaluation of results of {{the first group of}} questions. This group addresses characteristics of people using wood-based family houses. The results are evaluated for individual regions and for the whole Czech Republic. The evaluation covers seven characteristics of adults using the surveyed buildings: age of users, type of the buildings’ ownership, educational attainment, sector of employment, profession, type of previous housing, and the size of municipality of the previous housing. The aim of the paper is to create profile of a “common user” of wood-based buildings.

Methods: Five hundred and fifty-four CRN patients, inclusive of colorectal polyp or cancer, who attended the colorectal specialist outpatient clinic at Queen Mary Hospital in Hong Kong between October 2009 and July 2010, were included. Patients were interviewed with questionnaires on socio-demographic characteristics, and generic and health preference measures of HRQOL using the SF- 12 and SF- 6 D Health Surveys, respectively. Clinical information on stage of disease at diagnosis, time since diagnosis, primary tumour site was extracted from electronic case record. Mean HRQOL and health preference scores of CRN patients were compared with age-sex matched controls from the Chinese general population using independent t-test. Multiple linear regression analyses were conducted to explore the associations of clinical characteristics with HRQOL measures with the adjustment of socio-demographic characteristics. Results: Cross-sectional data of 515 eligible patients responded to the <b>whole</b> <b>questionnaires</b> were included in outcome analysis. In comparison with age-sex matched normative values, CRN patients reported comparable physical-related HRQOL but better mental-related HRQOL.

40|$|Introduction: In {{order to}} ensure the {{achievement}} of goals in clinical training, having the right tool with good reliability and validity is essential. Given {{the fact that no}} proper tool has ever been developed for evaluation of operating room students, this study aimed to develop and measure the validity and reliability of the evaluation tool for these students. Methods: This descriptive study was conducted in 2014 in Birjand University of Medical Sciences. After defining the concepts and behaviors to be measured using interviews and review of relevant literatures, the primary tool was developed and its face validity and content validity were verified both qualitatively and quantitatively (using experts’ opinions, CVR, and CVI). The reliability was calculated through interclass reliability and Cronbach’s alpha. Results: The final tool consisted of 62 items in 7 different subscales (professional characteristics, communication, examining the patient, training patients and families, submitting reports, clients’ safety, and clinical competence). The content validity index of the <b>whole</b> <b>questionnaire</b> was 0. 84 and content validity ratio for each item was reported 0. 62 and higher. With a sample size of 28 students, Cronbach's alpha of the <b>whole</b> <b>questionnaire</b> was 0. 82. Also, interclass reliability was 0. 45. Conclusion: The results indicated that the developed tool has adequate reliability and validity and that it {{can be used as a}} tool for clinical evaluation of operating room students...|$|E

The mean scores for the <b>whole</b> DREEM <b>questionnaire</b> and the five essential domains were found to be significantly different in different phases of medical education.

However, the results from the survey indicate that pay has positive significant implications on employees’ commitment and involvement.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study aims to {{evaluate}} Pontificia Universidade Católica de São Paulo (PUC-SP) medical students' {{perception of their}} preparedness to attend the internship course by comparing students who entered the internship in 2009, who were taught according to the traditional learning method, and those who entered the internship in 2010, who were taught {{according to the new}} method, i. e. problem-based learning (PBL). METHODS: 50 traditional learning method students answered a standard Lickert scale questionnaire upon entering internship in 2009. In 2010, the process was repeated with PBL students. The questionnaire was based upon the Preparation for Hospital Practice Questionnaire. This questionnaire was evaluated by professors from three medical schools in Brazil regarding its applicability. The original questions were classified according to the importance these professors attributed to them, and less important questions were removed. Scores obtained from the Student's t-test were considered significant with p < 0. 05. RESULTS: A significant statistical difference was observed in 16 questions, and the traditional learning method students reported higher average scores. When questions were divided into dimensions, a significant statistical difference appeared in the dimensions " social aspects of health", "medical skills", and "ethical concepts"; traditional learning method students again reported higher scores (p < 0. 001 for all dimensions). Higher scores were also reported when the average of the answers to the <b>whole</b> <b>questionnaire</b> was calculated. CONCLUSION: Traditional learning method students consider themselves to be better prepared for internship activities than PBL students, according to the following three comparative means: by analyzing the answers to each question, by grouping these answers into dimensions, and by calculating the means of answers to the <b>whole</b> <b>questionnaire...</b>|$|E

The Persian version of quality of lifeassessment tools in these patients is not checked. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the normative dataand some of the psychometric properties of the Persian version of quality of life questionnaire in patientswith diabetes mellitus in an Iranian population. Materials and Methods: Subjects were DM patients who were referred to health centers of Isfahan city(Iran) in 2007. A total number of 120 diabetic patients were selected through stratified randomizedsampling as well as equal number of matched control subjects. A demographic questionnaire, diabetesquality of life (DQOL) and WHO- quality of life (WHO-QOL) tools were administered to both groups. Results: The total mean score of QOL was relatively low in DM patients except for the domains ofworries. Using the chronbach’s alpha test, the reliability of the <b>whole</b> <b>questionnaire</b> and its subscales weredetermined to be 0. 89 and 0. 51 to 0. 84, respectively.

The details of the KAP towards the <b>whole</b> grain <b>questionnaire,</b> {{as well as the}} development and validation procedure have been previously published (Koo et al. 2016 a). However, for the sake of completeness, a brief description is provided here. The questionnaire is constructed in the Malay language, and consists of four main sections: (1) demographic factors, (2) knowledge domain, (3) attitude domain and (4) practice domain. The demographic factors are intended to discover the demographic and whole grain consumption pattern. Whereas, the knowledge domain reflects the knowledge on general nutrition and whole grain information, including the food pyramid, source of carbohydrates, definition of whole grains, source of whole grains, nutritional content of whole grains and the benefits of whole grain consumption. The attitude domain is defined as the school children’s opinions and beliefs towards whole grain consumption, awareness and socio-cultural perspectives. Finally, the practice domain corresponds to the school children’s practice towards whole grain consumption, such as the frequency of the intake of whole grain ready-to-eat cereals, whole-grain bread, corn, whole-grain biscuits, oats, barley and brown rice.|$|R
