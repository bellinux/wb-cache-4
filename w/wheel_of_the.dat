5|$|Some Heathens {{celebrate}} the eight festivals {{found in the}} <b>Wheel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Year, a tradition that they share with Wiccans and other contemporary Pagan groups. Others celebrate only six of these festivals, as represented by a six-spoked <b>Wheel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Year. The use of such festivals is criticized by other practitioners, who highlight that this system is of modern, mid-20th century origin and does not link with the original religious celebrations of the pre-Christian Germanic world.|$|E
5|$|On 14 July 1947, the {{committee}} {{recommended that the}} flag of the Indian National Congress be adopted as the National Flag of India with suitable modifications, so as to make it acceptable to all parties and communities. It was also resolved that the flag should not have any communal undertones. The spinning <b>wheel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Congress flag was replaced by the Chakra (wheel) from the Lion Capital of Ashoka. According to Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, the chakra was chosen as it was representative of dharma and law. However, Jawaharlal Nehru explained that the change was more practical in nature, as unlike the flag with the spinning wheel, this design would appear symmetrical. Gandhi was not very pleased by the change, but eventually came around to accepting it.|$|E
5|$|During the trip, Homer {{falls asleep}} and wakes up {{abruptly}} at the <b>wheel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> truck due to taking {{a combination of}} pep pills and sleeping pills that he bought at a general store. He awakes {{to discover that the}} truck drove by itself with its Navitron Autodrive System. He informs other truck drivers, who inform him that he cannot let anyone know about the Autodrive system because it would make all truck drivers lose their jobs. However, Homer tells the passengers of a passing bus about the system, which causes an angry mob of truckers to go after Homer. But even after the Autodrive system ejects itself from Homer's semi, Homer is able to escape from the angry trucker mob. Homer and Bart arrive in Atlanta to finish Red's shipment on time, and then commandeer a train full of napalm so they can return to Springfield.|$|E
30|$|In addition, {{the dynamic}} {{overloads}} obtained for <b>the</b> four <b>wheels</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same bogie have presented different behaviors {{as a result}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> curved stretch. For this reason, <b>the</b> eight <b>wheels</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wagon have been implemented in the numerical model instead <b>of</b> considering <b>the</b> superposition principle. This has considerably increased calculation times, but an improvement in <b>the</b> accuracy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> results has been obtained.|$|R
50|$|Honda {{has since}} {{announced}} an evolution of SH-AWD using hybrid electric technology. In a 2012 announcement, Sport Hybrid SH-AWD (Super Handling All Wheel Drive), replaces the engine powered mechanical drive shaft and clutch packs by two 27 hp electric motors, {{one on each}} wheel not driven by the gasoline engine. The first two announced applications <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sport Hybrid SH-AWD will be on <b>the</b> rear <b>wheels</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 2014 Acura RLX, and on <b>the</b> front <b>wheels</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new Acura NSX Concept.|$|R

Ford Chip Ganassi Racing entered the series with a full-time two-car entry, fielding two Ford GT vehicles driven by Andy Priaulx, Marino Franchitti, Harry Tincknell in the team's No. 67 entry and Olivier Pla, Stefan Mücke and Billy Johnson behind the <b>wheel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> company's No. 66 car. Patrick Long {{was committed to}} participating in the Pirelli World Challenge event on the Streets of Long Beach {{and was replaced by}} Klaus Bachler in the No. 88 Abu Dhabi-Proton Racing Porsche 911 RSR, joining the team's regular drivers David Heinemeier Hansson and Khaled Al Qubaisi.

5|$|The {{popularity}} of the tea ceremony among the ruling class had a significant influence on ceramic production. To satisfy the demand for high quality pottery items necessary to the tea ceremony {{a large number of}} celadon vases and tenmoku ash-glazed teabowls initially were imported from China from the mid-11th to the 16th centuries. These imported items were copied and produced locally at the Seto kiln in Owari Province. Around the mid-16th century adjacent Mino took over as a production center of conservative Chinese inspired Seto style pottery. The Japanese invasions of Korea from 1592–1598, and subsequent relocation of Korean potters to Kyushu, brought new pottery styles to Japan. From the late-16th century, Mino potters developed new, distinctly Japanese techniques such as Shino ware or Raku ware. This was also motivated by a general shift of tastes among teamasters and others, who came to prefer simpler unglazed tea bowls formed by hand rather than on a pottery <b>wheel.</b> <b>Of</b> <b>the</b> 14 pottery items in this list, eight entries are chawan bowls used in the tea ceremony, three are flower vases, one is an incense burner, one a tea-leaf jar and one a funerary pot. Eight objects originated in China, five in Japan and one in Korea.|$|E
