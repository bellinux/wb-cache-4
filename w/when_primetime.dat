50|$|<b>When</b> <b>Primetime</b> and Saga ceased {{broadcasting}} in 2006, Don {{emigrated to}} Estepona on the Costa del Sol in southern Spain. His final radio stop was with REM FM (now Talk Radio Europe), broadcasting to the Costas, the Canaries, Tenerife and Gibraltar, where, from May 2007, he presented weekend shows {{with a mix}} of music, chat and celebrity guests as diverse as the entertainer Max Bygraves and the jazz loving politician Ken Clarke.|$|E
50|$|Eventually, the PJs {{were joined}} {{by a variety of}} puppets named the Grogs, most famous of which, was Warren Chester Grog: a turtle/moss {{character}} resembling a chia-pet with a grumpy voice and cynical disposition. 1994 saw the introduction of animatronic character Snit (Atul N. Rao), which displayed a pair of moving teeth on a television screen covered with what appeared to be purple bubble gum. <b>When</b> a <b>primetime</b> version of The Zone, YTV Shift, was cancelled, its former host Paul McGuire joined Phil. On October 31, 1997, the two sent Snit into space, and Snit was replaced with the prop Elvays, a plastic Elvis head with a digitally added moving mouth.|$|R
50|$|Two daytime episodes {{aired in}} primetime. Episode #4035K (June 15, 2007, season finale and Bob Barker's final episode) was rebroadcast in primetime after airing that morning, {{leading to the}} Daytime Emmy Awards. Episode #4512K, the show's {{military}} special, originally intended for November 11, 2008, became the first daytime episode scheduled to originally air in <b>primetime</b> <b>when</b> it was moved to November 14.|$|R
25|$|On February 16, 2006, Joran van der Sloot and {{his father}} Paul were in New York City for an {{interview}} with ABC <b>Primetime</b> <b>when</b> they were served with a lawsuit filed by Twitty and her former husband David Holloway. The lawsuit alleged personal injury against Natalee Holloway and also alleged that Van der Sloot's father created a permissive environment. However, the case was dismissed on jurisdictional grounds on August 3, 2006.|$|R
5000|$|The use {{of family}} values as a {{political}} term dates back to 1976, when it appeared in the Republican Party platform. The phrase became more widespread after Vice President Dan Quayle used it in {{a speech at the}} 1992 Republican National Convention. Quayle had also launched a national controversy when he criticized the television program Murphy Brown for a story line that depicted the title character becoming a single mother by choice, citing it {{as an example of how}} popular culture contributes to a [...] "poverty of values", and saying: [...] "it doesn't help matters <b>when</b> <b>primetime</b> TV has Murphy Brown—a character who supposedly epitomizes today's intelligent, highly paid, professional woman—mocking the importance of fathers, by bearing a child alone, and calling it just another 'lifestyle choice'". Quayle's remarks initiated widespread controversy, and have had a continuing effect on U.S. politics. Stephanie Coontz, a professor of family history and the author of several books and essays about the history of marriage, says that this brief remark by Quayle about Murphy Brown [...] "kicked off more than a decade of outcries against the 'collapse of the family'".|$|E
5000|$|In 1986, Australian {{newspaper}} tycoon Rupert Murdoch purchased KRIV and {{the other}} five television stations in the Metromedia group, all of which became the founding owned-and-operated stations of his new television network, the Fox Broadcasting Company; upon the change in ownership, the station officially dropped the [...] "-TV" [...] suffix from its callsign. The acquisition resulted in channel 26 {{and the other}} former Metromedia stations to suddenly adopt a more sophisticated on-air appearance for a network, that at the time, did not exist. A unified music and graphics package was featured {{on all of the}} original Fox-owned stations, including KRIV, which was consistently noted for featuring graphics that were among the first of their kind for local television. The station changed its on-air branding to the current [...] "Fox 26" [...] upon the network's October 9, 1986 launch. Despite {{being a member of the}} new network, KRIV's schedule wouldn't change that much, as at that time, Fox only aired a late-night talk show upon the network's launch; even <b>when</b> <b>primetime</b> programming followed in 1987, the network initially aired the lineup on Saturdays and Sundays. Fox continued to gradually add additional nights of programming over the next six years until it went seven days a week in 1993. Over that seven-week wait, KRIV was still essentially a de facto independent station.|$|E
50|$|In 1995, WTKR {{began to}} produce the market's first prime time local {{newscast}}, a half-hour program at 10 p.m. called NewsChannel 3 at 10 on UPN 27. The newscast was cancelled in late 1997, due to low ratings. The 10 p.m. time period was used for off-network repeats until June 29, 2015 <b>when</b> the weeknight <b>primetime</b> newscast returned under the name WGNT News at 10 - Powered by NewsChannel 3. This is WTKR's second attempt at a weeknight 10 p.m. newscast for WGNT.|$|R
5000|$|Opposite {{dominant}} television series: On occasion, a {{regularly scheduled}} program may {{have this kind}} of dominant drawing power. Notable examples included NBC's The Cosby Show for most of the mid- and late-1980s, ER during its peak {{in the second half of}} the 1990s (at the time <b>when</b> NBC's Thursday <b>primetime</b> schedule represented the most watched television programs of the decade), and Fox's American Idol during its peak in the mid-2000s and early 2010s (at the peak of reality television in the U.S. during those decades) - each of which was dubbed a [...] "Death Star" [...] by the other networks because of the show's consistent ability to dominate the ratings.|$|R
50|$|The station {{originally}} {{broadcast on}} UHF channel 20 using a transmitter originally used for WWLP's partial satellite, WRLP-TV in Greenfield, Massachusetts (which closed down shortly before KSTU's sign-on). KSTU's programming {{at the time}} was typical for an independent station - cartoons, off-network classic sitcoms, classic movies, and drama series. The Springfield Television group was sold to Adams Communications in 1984. On October 6, 1986, the station became a charter affiliate of Fox. However, like most Fox affiliates early in the network's history, it was still essentially programmed as an independent. Fox initially ran only late night programming at launch and <b>when</b> it added <b>primetime</b> programming in April 1987, it only aired such programs on Saturdays and Sundays (it wasn't until 1993 that Fox would broadcast programming on every day of the week).|$|R
50|$|Originally, {{the program}} was aired live on the ABC network and {{featured}} a live studio audience. The first interviews included Roseanne Barr and a piece on a Middle East hostage crisis reported by Chris Wallace. Donaldson and Sawyer would allow audience members {{to comment on the}} program and ask questions of the guests, who were usually interviewed live via satellite or in studio, a practice that resulted in many technical difficulties and easy satirization on Saturday Night Live. Internal conflicts between Sawyer and Donaldson later led them to be separated, and the audience eliminated. However, the program has always had some live elements <b>when</b> broadcast as <b>Primetime</b> Live, generally consisting of Donaldson reading the opening remarks of packaged stories and the opening title as Primetime... LIVE!. Over time, live interviews were de-emphasized and hidden camera investigations began to occupy more of the schedule.|$|R
50|$|The {{plan was}} similar to CBS's pre-Letterman use of the slot for Crimetime After <b>Primetime</b> <b>when</b> police procedurals and mysteries aired in the slot in the early-1990s, and the late 1980s CBS Late Night which {{featured}} a mixture of scripted programming. CBS inaugurated the summer format with reruns of the final season of The Mentalist, a cancelled prime time police procedural, airing nightly from May 21 until June 5, 2015. Hawaii Five-0 (June 8-12, July 27-31), CSI: Cyber (June 15-19, August 17-21), Elementary (June 22-26), Blue Bloods (June 29-July 5), The Good Wife (July 6-10, August 24-28), NCIS: Los Angeles (July 13-17), NCIS (July 20-24) Scorpion (August 3-7), NCIS: New Orleans (August 10-14) and Madam Secretary (August 31-September 4) also aired during the summer in the 11:35 pm time slot between the Letterman and Colbert transition.|$|R
5000|$|Steve Lumbley, {{who worked}} for Tilton's {{ministry}} in 1991 <b>when</b> the original <b>Primetime</b> Live investigation took place, told {{a reporter for the}} Dallas Observer in 2006 that reports of prayer request disposal that were the centerpiece of the 1991 Primetime Live exposé were highly exaggerated. In an article for the dallasobserver.com blog [...] "Unfair Park", Lumbley asserted that [...] "the mailings all had some kind of gimmick. They weren't godly at all. But the primary allegation that came out of that—that prayer requests were thrown away—was categorically untrue, and I can guarantee you that was not a normal practice." [...] However, Lumbley, who now runs a Christian watchdog website called ApostasyWatch.com, does credit ABC and the Trinity Foundation for exposing Tilton's unethical fundraising tactics, noting that [...] "God was using Ole and ABC to chastise Tilton and bring him down." ...|$|R
2500|$|Nicola Walker {{completes the}} main cast as Gillian. She admired the character's honesty, bravery {{and lack of}} self-pity, and {{identified}} strongly with her tendency to speak before thinking things through and her deep love for her father. In 2014 The Daily Telegraph described the role as a [...] "game-changer" [...] in the trajectory of Walker's career. Though ultimately successful in winning the role Walker initially believed {{that she would not}} get the part {{due to a lack of}} confidence in her northern accent, and the presence of northern actresses in the audition. Her approach to the character saw her delve into Gillian's psychology with Walker particularly interested in the contradiction between Gillian's sexual confidence and her use of sex as a form of self-punishment. [...] She felt the series showed a very adult approach to storytelling, stating that she had [...] "never come across a character like Gillian before" [...] and praising the variety of strong female roles. The Independent noted the significance of the series having three female leads over the age of 40, stating that this, alongside Caroline's lesbian storyline and Gillian's attitude towards sex made the series [...] "quietly subversive" [...] <b>when</b> compared against <b>primetime</b> television as a whole.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we first present a {{detailed}} {{study on the}} trade-off between the computational complexity (directly related to the power consumption) and classification accuracy {{for a number of}} classifiers for classifying normal and abnormal ECGs. In our analysis we consider the spectral energy of the constituent waves of the ECG as the discriminative feature. Starting with the exhaustive exploration of single heart-beat based classification to ascertain the complexity-accuracy trade-off in different classification algorithms, we then extend our study for multiple heartbeat based classification. We use data available in Physionet as well as samples from Southampton General Hospital Cardiology Department for our investigation. Our primary conclusion is that a classifier based on Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) achieves comparable level of accuracy to the best performing Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers with advantage of significantly reduced computational complexity. Subsequently, we propose an ultra low-power circuit implementation of the LDA classifier that could be integrated with the ECG sensor node enabling on-body normal and abnormal ECG classification. The simulated circuit is synthesized at 130 nm technology and occupies 0. 70 mm² of silicon area (0. 979 mm² after Place and Route) while it consumes 182. 94 nW @ 1. 08 V, estimated with Synopsys <b>PrimeTime</b> <b>when</b> operating at 1 KHz. These results clearly demonstrate the potential for low-power implementation of the proposed design...|$|R
