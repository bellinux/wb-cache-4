5|$|It later {{emerged that}} Harding had also promised former Utah senator George Sutherland {{a seat on}} the Supreme Court, and <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{expectation}} that another place would become vacant. Harding was also considering a proposal by Justice William R. Day to crown his career by being chief justice for six months before retiring. Taft felt, when he learned of this plan, that a short-term appointment would not serve the office well, and that once confirmed by the Senate, the memory of Day would grow dim. After Harding rejected Day's plan, Attorney General Harry Daugherty, who supported Taft's candidacy, urged him to fill the vacancy, and he named Taft on June 30, 1921. The Senate confirmed Taft the same day, 61–4, without any committee hearings and after a brief debate in executive session. Taft drew the objections of three progressive Republicans and one southern Democrat. When he was sworn in on July 11, he became the first and to date only person to serve both as president and chief justice.|$|E

Before murdering Alleen, Schmid told Saunders to rape her, but he couldn't do it, because Saunders was gay. While the murder occurred, Mary French <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> car and {{listening}} to the radio. Afterwards the three buried her. When Alleen went missing, her father told her mother he felt she had been murdered and left in the desert. The mother, Norma Rowe, went to the police and was told that she needed more evidence before they could go looking in the desert.|$|E
25|$|Prior to Game 3 of the 1995 World Series, Cleveland Indians slugger Albert Belle {{unleashed}} a profanity-laced tirade at NBC reporter Hannah Storm as she <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Indians' dugout for a prearranged interview with Indians lead-off man, Kenny Lofton. On the same day, Belle snapped at a photographer near the first base line during batting practice. Belle was ultimately fined US$50,000 for his behavior towards Storm. This particular World Series was remembered for baseball television history being made twice by Storm. Prior to Game 2, {{she became the}} first female sportscaster to serve as solo host of a World Series game, and after Game 6 she would be the first female sportscaster to preside over the presentation of the Commissioner's Trophy to the World Series champions. However, she was not the first female sportscaster to cover the World Series: that honor fell to CBS Sports reporter Lesley Visser, who served as a field reporter for the Series from 1990 to 1993. She would also cover that same World Series but for a different network, ABC Sports.|$|E

25|$|Gloucestershire's strong {{challenge}} for the title was despite the loss of Wally Hammond but in Tom Goddard they had the best bowler in the country. He took 238 wickets in all matches, 61 more than his nearest rival. He was well supported by Sam Cook who took 120 championship wickets and gained a Test call, but the team lacked quality pace bowlers with George Lambert largely on his own apart from the medium pace of Test batsman Charlie Barnett. Five Gloucestershire batsmen scored over 1,000 runs in the championship: captain Basil Allen, Barnett, Jack Crapp, George Emmett and wicket-keeper Andy Wilson. Playfair recorded concerns about the pitch at Bristol which was alleged by some to have been prepared especially for Goddard. It is true that Gloucestershire won eight of the nine matches played there but equally true that Goddard took most of his wickets in matches not at Bristol. Ken Graveney made his debut for Gloucestershire in 1947 and his brother Tom <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wings. Other players included Monty Cranfield, Bev Lyon, Clifford Monks, William Neale, Grahame Parker, Colin Scott and Alfred Wilcox.|$|E

2500|$|The decisive {{moment in}} the game came {{in the bottom of}} the eighth inning. Kintzler gave up a lead-off walk to Chicago pinch-hitter Tommy La Stella. Leonys Martin then came in to pinch run for La Stella and {{advanced}} to second on Jon Jay′s sacrifice bunt. Kintzler then struck out third baseman Kris Bryant, and Baker brought in Óliver Pérez to pitch to first baseman Anthony Rizzo rather than walk Rizzo and face catcher Willson Contreras, who <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> on-deck circle. Rizzo hit Perez's first pitch weakly into left field for a bloop single that fell between Taylor, Werth, and shortstop Trea Turner. The hit scored Martin to give the Cubs a 2–1 lead before Rizzo was thrown out to end the inning when he tried to advance to second. Chicago closer Wade Davis then retired the Nationals in order in the top of the ninth and Chicago secured a 2–1 victory despite committing four errors in the field.
