50|$|The main {{components}} of every orbital welding system are the power source and controller, the <b>welding</b> <b>head</b> and, where required, a wire feed mechanism. Welding of certain sizes and material types will also {{require the use}} of a water/coolant system. There are a large number of factors that can have an influence on the welding result. These aspects include the arc length, magnitude and pulse frequency of the welding current, welding speed, inert shielding gas, parent material, filler material, weld preparation, and thermal conductivity. Ultimately, a high quality weld is achieved through detailed knowledge of how to precisely adjust all these parameters for each individual welding task.|$|E

50|$|In 1930, welding {{converters}} {{laid the}} foundation for Kjellberg’s worldwide success. The fundamentally new concept of these machines was the unification of all components under one housing, including control section and steerable carrier. Later, these converters were further developed into automatic welding machines. Experimental studies on automatic arc welding started in 1934. With the market launch of the automatic welding machines S I and S II in 1937, mechanised welding for industrial purposes was possible for the first time. Kjellberg offered three technological options for mechanised welding: with exchangeable electrode head for endless welding of rod electrodes, with <b>welding</b> <b>head</b> for bare wire coils and with carbon head for thin sheet welding.|$|E
50|$|EGW uses a {{constant}} voltage, direct current welding power supply, and the electrode has positive polarity. The welding current {{can range from}} 100 to 800 A, and the voltage can range between 30 and 50 V. A wire feeder is used to supply the electrode, which is selected based on the material being welded. The electrode can be flux-cored to provide the weld with protection from atmospheric contamination, or a shielding gas—generally carbon dioxide—can be used with a solid wire electrode. The <b>welding</b> <b>head</b> is attached to an apparatus that elevates during the welding process. Also attached to the apparatus are backing shoes which restrain the weld to {{the width of the}} workpieces. To prevent them from melting, they are made of copper and are water-cooled. They must be fit tightly against the joint to prevent leaks.|$|E
50|$|Due to the {{precision}} of orbital TIG welding, even the smallest standard tube diameters from 1.6 millimetres can be processed. On a larger scale, pipes with diameters up to 170mm and walls up to 3.5mm thick can be joined using closed chamber weld heads. These weld heads allow the torch to be positioned very precisely and ensure that the pipe is held securely. The inert gas atmosphere in the closed chamber prevents heat from tinting, even with the most sensitive of materials. For tube diameters between 8 and 275mm, {{it is possible to}} use more manageable open welding heads (except for high purity applications). A flexible hose system is used to supply the <b>welding</b> <b>head</b> with power, inert gas, cooling water and filler wire where required. The need for filler wire during the welding process depends on the type of welding task; thicker tube walls and difficult-to-control parent materials require the use of additional material, whereas thin-walled tubes can be welded without extra wire.In order to create high quality weld seams it is essential that tube ends are carefully prepared with the edges of the workpieces being free of scale and impurities. For thinner-walled tubes up to medium diameters, a simple right-angled saw cut is often sufficient. For thicker tube walls it is necessary to prepare the edges more carefully, for example using a U-groove cross-section.|$|E

40|$|Laser welding {{requires}} {{fast and}} accurate {{positioning of the}} laser beam over the seam trajectory. The task of accurate positioning of the laser tools is performed by robotic systems. It is therefore necessary to teach the robot the path it has to follow. Seam teaching is implemented in several ways: Offline Programming, Manual Point-to-point, Sensor Guided. The first two processes are time consuming; the second requires constant human interaction, whereas the last one is fast and fully automated. The most commonly used seam detection sensors are based on optical triangulation with a single structured light line. Such sensors impose restrictions on the laser tool orientation {{in relation to the}} seam trajectory. The shape of the seam trajectory in combination with the required speed, can force the robot into positioning errors due to robot dynamics. Furthermore, closed looped seam trajectories such as circles or rectangles are not possible to be taught with such sensors. A solution to these problems is given by the seam detection sensor of the integrated laser <b>welding</b> <b>head.</b> The developed perimetric sensor allows the detection and following of seam trajectories without restrictions on the relative position of the <b>welding</b> <b>head.</b> This reduces positioning errors due robot dynamics and allows looped seam trajectories.
