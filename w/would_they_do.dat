On {{the night of the}} raid there were also four harbour defence boats and ten ships from the 16th and 42nd Minesweeper flotillas berthed in the basin, while two tankers were berthed inside the Normandie dock. [...] The 6th and 7th U-boat flotillas, {{commanded}} by Kapitänleutnant Georg-Wilhelm Schulz and Korvettenkapitän Herbert Sohler respectively, were permanently based in the port.

He asked what <b>would</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> if the base was subject to an attack by British Commandos. Sohler replied that [...] "an attack on the base would be hazardous and highly improbable".|$|E
