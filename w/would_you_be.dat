The show chronicles real-life medical techniques and technology, on the Discovery Channel. Nielsen said: [...] "There {{are any number of}} things that you think about when you ponder if you hadn't been an actor, what <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>be,</b> and I've always said I'd like to be an astronaut or a doctor. I have such admiration for doctors. I just don't know how you go around to thank them enough for coming up with the world's most remarkable new discoveries." ...|$|E
500|$|Frank Arthur [...] "Bones" [...] Jenner (surname often misspelled Genor; 2 November 1903– 8 May 1977) was an Australian evangelist. His {{signature}} {{approach to}} evangelism {{was to ask}} people on George Street, Sydney, [...] "If you died within 24 hours, where <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>be</b> in eternity? Heaven or hell?" [...] Born and raised in England, he contracted African trypanosomiasis {{at the age of}} twelve and suffered from narcolepsy {{for the rest of his}} life. After some time, he joined the Royal Navy, but deserted in New York and joined the United States Navy. When he was 24, he deserted again while in Australia. He subsequently worked for the Royal Australian Navy until he bought his way out in 1937.|$|E

500|$|The {{group and}} the music {{industry}} were unsure how fans would receive the tour beforehand. During {{the first week of}} shows, Bono said, [...] "This show is a real roller coaster ride, and some people will want to get off, I'm sure." [...] He remained optimistic that their devoted fans would continue following them, but cautioned {{he had no intention of}} resisting the glamour and fame: [...] "Oh, but it's fun to be carried away by the hype. Where <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>be</b> without the hype?... You can't pretend all the promotion and all the fanfare is not happening." [...] Some hardcore fans, particularly in the US, objected to the tour as a blatant sellout to commercial values, while others misinterpreted the tour's mocking of excess, believing that, according to VH1's Legends, [...] "U2 had 'lost it' and that Bono had become an egomaniac". Many Christian fans were offended the band's antics and believed they had abandoned their religious faith.|$|E
500|$|Mudvayne guitarist Greg Tribbett {{approached}} Maxwell [...] "out of the blue" [...] {{and wanted}} to join the band. Nothingface drummer Tommy Sickles originally helmed the drum kit for the band's demo, however, things did not work out {{and the search for}} a new drummer began. The band knew former Pantera and Damageplan drummer Vinnie Paul, and tried to persuade him to join the band as their drummer. Originally, Paul was not sure if he would return to music {{after the death of his}} brother, Dimebag Darrell and an 18-month hiatus: [...] "It was one of those things that I didn't think I'd be apart of this ever again without him, and after about a year and a half had gone by, these guys called me up, Chad [...] and Tom , they were like, 'We're thinking about putting this band together, <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>be</b> into it?' First couple of times, I told them, 'No, I don't think I'm ready to do this yet.' And they just were real persistent, they kept calling me. And one night, I had been drinking some red wine and listening to some KISS on 12" [...] vinyl record and I said, 'You know what, lets take a shot at this, lets see what happens.'" ...|$|E
500|$|But {{there is}} some {{opposition}} {{to the idea of}} an empowered global parliament. A 2007 BBC poll of approximately 12,000 respondents asked, [...] "How likely <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>be</b> to support a Global Parliament, where votes are based on country population sizes, and the global parliament is able to make binding policies?" [...] Of those polled, 19.1% responded [...] "Very unlikely–it is a bad idea"; 14.9% responded [...] "Quite unlikely–but it might work"; 23.1% said [...] "Quite likely–but with reservations"; and 14.4% said [...] "Very likely–it is a good idea". The poll was broken out by country, and the U.S. and Australia showed the strongest opposition. Potential challenge to the UNPA are political organizations such as the U.S. Constitution Party, and politicians such as 2008 U.S. presidential candidate Ron Paul, which favor withdrawal from the United Nations and other multilateral organizations altogether due to sovereignty concerns. Canadian Action Party leader Connie Fogal also opposes the UNPA, saying, [...] "It is very revealing to see the NDP and the Greens as part of and promoting this...Further, the European assembly {{has proven to be a}} rubber stamping mechanism of bureaucratic decisions. This is not democracy." [...] In addition, a Civicus article warns, [...] "With an unexpected backlash against civil society in the offing (despite the good efforts of the UN General Assembly President, Jan Eliasson, to reverse the trend), citizen participation at the UN is diminishing quickly. It would be safe to assume that Member States as a whole are not in the mood to consider a Parliamentary Assembly at this time." ...|$|E

500|$|Out of {{gratitude}} to God for giving him salvation, Jenner committed to consistently engaging in personal evangelism, and aimed {{to talk with}} ten different people every day thenceforward. For 28 years, from his initial conversion until his debility from Parkinson's disease, Jenner engaged in this form of evangelism. He probably spoke with more than 100,000 people in total, hundreds of whom made initial professions of commitment to Christianity. He kept religious tracts in his shirt pocket where he had previously kept his rabbit's foot, and he often gave these tracts to people he met. He also kept a card in his pocket with Philippians 4:13 on {{it in order to}} give himself courage in evangelising. This verse reads, [...] "I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me." [...] While engaging in these activities, Jenner would normally wear a white shirt, black shoes, and trousers, and sometimes a navy greatcoat. Usually evangelising on George Street, Sydney, Jenner asked many people the same question: [...] "If you died within 24 hours, where <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>be</b> in eternity? Heaven or hell?" [...] If they were willing to engage in conversation with him, he would invite them either to his home or to a local church. The question became known as [...] "the Frank Jenner question". Jenner was most active in evangelism during World War II. On Saturday nights during the war, Jenner would invite groups of sailors to his home for a service consisting of some hymns and a short sermon.|$|E
500|$|Rathbun {{was arrested}} on three occasions, with each arrest {{bringing}} increased local, national, and international media attention to the medical cannabis movement. [...] Her grandmotherly appearance generated public sympathy for her cause and undermined attempts by the district attorney's office to prosecute her for possession. [...] The City of San Francisco eventually gave Rathbun permission to distribute cannabis brownies to people with AIDS. [...] Her arrests generated interest {{in the medical community}} and motivated researchers to propose one of the first clinical trials to study the effects of cannabinoids in HIV-infected adults., DEA. : [...] "I spent about a year or so trying to find researchers willing to invest their time in this, and I couldn't find anybody. And then there was a report in the paper about a woman in California who, she was called [...] "Brownie Mary." [...] She made marijuana brownies for AIDS patients to help them with appetite. And she was arrested at—while she was getting marijuana to make into these brownies, and she worked at San Francisco General Hospital at the AIDS ward. And so I called doctors there, and I said one of your volunteers has just been arrested. <b>Would</b> <b>you</b> <b>be</b> interested in trying to do some research to show whether she was doing something that might actually have been helpful to these patients? She probably thought that it was helpful since, you know, she was permitted on the ward to do this. And so I spoke to a Dr. Donald Abrams {{and he said that he}} would be interested in trying to do research in this area, and so we started to collaborate"; Sheehy, 2000: [...] "According to Donald Abrams, MD, lead author of the study and professor of clinical medicine in the UCSF Positive Health Program at San Francisco General Hospital Medical Center, this was the first attempt to study the effects of marijuana in people with HIV and one of the most comprehensive studies about the effects of marijuana on the immune system." ...|$|E

The cars sold steadily throughout the decade, and though they managed to avoid the dreadful reviews reserved for Lada and FSO, commentators in the British motoring press were rarely more than lukewarm in their praise of the car - a headline from 1986 read “The Yugo 55 is a good small car, but <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>be</b> seen in one?” ...|$|E

2500|$|A common way to {{test whether}} an innate jealousy {{response}} exists between sexes {{is to use a}} forced-choice questionnaire. This style of questionnaire asks participants [...] "Yes or No" [...] and [...] "Response A or Response B" [...] style questions about certain scenarios. For example, a question might ask, [...] "If you found your partner cheating on you <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>be</b> more upset by (A) the sexual involvement or (B) the emotional involvement". As the name implies, one is forced to choose between the two options. Many studies using forced choice questionnaires have found statistically significant results supporting an innate sex difference between men and women. [...] Furthermore, studies have shown that this observation holds across many cultures, although the magnitudes of the sex difference vary within sexes across cultures.|$|E
2500|$|In the end, Isac {{opted to}} throw his support behind the unionist movement. He {{attended}} the 9th Social Democratic Congress, and was elected a {{representative to the}} Alba Iulia assembly. There, on December 1, the Romanian socialist clubs, together with the Romanian National Party and the various other civic forces, demanded the union with Romania [...] (see Great Union Day). According to fellow socialist Tiron Albani, Isac first sparked disagreements within the unionist gathering, after endorsing proposals that the Romanian Kingdom become a republic in exchange for union. Isac's controversial address to his peers, as cited by Grapini, stresses: [...] "a {{quarter of an hour}} ago you have approved of the resolution [...] Now you are revolted that a human idea is being expressed. Today, when three emperors have been ejected and their crowns hurled back at them! <b>Would</b> <b>you</b> <b>be</b> more consistent! [...] a king may well be good and wise, but he may also be a tyrant, and he'll still be king". In the end, the socialist delegation renounced its republican aims, placated by a resolution to ensure land reform and workers' rights throughout the resulting nation.|$|E
2500|$|Due {{to their}} low social status and {{language}} barrier, Korean Americans received very {{little if any}} aid or protection from police authorities. David Joo, a manager of the gun store, said, [...] "I {{want to make it}} clear that we didn't open fire first. At that time, four police cars were there. Somebody started to shoot at us. The LAPD ran away in half a second. I never saw such a fast escape. I was pretty disappointed." [...] Carl Rhyu, a participant in the Korean immigrants' armed response to the rioting, said, [...] "If it was your own business and your own property, <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>be</b> willing to trust it to someone else? We are glad the National Guard is here. They're good backup. But when our shops were burning we called the police every five minutes; no response." [...] At a shopping center several miles north of Koreatown, Jay Rhee, who estimated that he and others fired five hundred shots into the ground and air, said, [...] "We have lost our faith in the police. Where were you when we needed you?" [...] Koreatown was isolated from South Central Los Angeles, yet despite such exclusion it was the heaviest hit.|$|E
