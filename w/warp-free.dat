40|$|Stacking {{sequence}} configurations for hygrothermally curvature-stable (HTCS) laminates {{have been}} recently {{been identified in}} 9 classes of coupled laminate with standard ply angle orientations + 45, − 45, 0 and 90 °. All arise from the judicious realignment of the principal material axis of laminate classes with Bending-Twisting and/or Bending- Extension and Twisting-Shearing coupling; Off-axis material alignment of these parent classes gives rise to more complex combinations of mechanical coupling behavior. However, for standard ply angle orientations + 45, − 45, 0 and 90 °, HTCS solutions were found in only 8 -, 12 -, 16 - and 20 -ply laminates. This article presents new solutions for non-standard ply angle orientations + 60, − 60, 0 and 90 °, which lead to solutions in all ply number groupings for 10 plies and above, thus offering a possibility for tapered <b>warp-free</b> laminate designs...|$|E
40|$|Experimental {{work was}} {{continued}} {{on the development}} and characterization of bulk and hot pressed powders and tapecast materials in the Bi-Sr-Ca-Cu-O and Tl-Ba-Ca-Cu-O systems. A process for producing <b>warp-free,</b> sintered, superconducting tapes of Bi composition Bi 1 Sr 2 Ca 2 Cu 3 O(x) was established. The procedure requires a triple calcination at 830 C for 24 hours and sintering at 845 C from 20 to 200 hours. Hot pressing the triple calcined powder at 845 C for 6 hours at 5000 psi yielded a dense material, which on further heat treatment at 845 C for 24 hours, exhibited a Tc of 108. 2 K. The Bi compositions {{were found to be}} much less oxygen sensitive than the Y compositions. This was especially noted {{in the case of the}} hot pressed materials which were superconducting as hot pressed, a condition that could not be achieved in the Y compositions. Safire-type grounding links are in the process of being fabricated from these materials...|$|E
40|$|In this article, {{we present}} OSTE+RIM, a novel {{reaction}} injection molding (RIM) process that combines {{the merits of}} off-stoichiometric thiol–ene epoxy (OSTE+) thermosetting polymers with the fabrication of high quality microstructured parts. The process relies on the dual polymerization reactions of OSTE+ polymers, where the first curing step is used in OSTE+RIM for molding intermediately polymerized parts with well-defined shapes and reactive surface chemistries. In the facile back-end processing, the replicated parts are directly and covalently bonded and become fully polymerized using the second curing step, generating complete microfluidic devices. To achieve unprecedented rapid processing, high replication fidelity and low residual stress, OSTE+RIM uniquely incorporates temperature stabilization and shrinkage compensation of the OSTE+ polymerization during molding. Two different OSTE+ formulations were characterized and used for the OSTE+RIM fabrication of optically transparent, <b>warp-free</b> and natively hydrophilic microscopy glass slide format microfluidic demonstrator devices, featuring a storage modulus of 2. 3 GPa and tolerating pressures of at least 4 bars.   QC  201500618 </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{non-linear}} filtration {{law with}} a limiting gradient of two immiscible fluids (oil and water) into a flat <b>warp-free</b> layer exploited by {{horizontal and vertical}} wells is investigated. The method for numerical determination of pressure and oil saturation and the corresponding difference analogues are considered. The analysis of high viscosity oil displacement by water in the five-point waterflooding element for three types of heterogeneity (zonal, with spline-interpolation application, and laminated) is carried out. The influence of the displacement limiting gradient on the basic technological characteristics of non-Newtonian oil production is studied. The results of the mathematical simulation show that the front movement at the initial stage of displacement is close to circular. The movement of non-Newtonian oil after the displacing fluid breakthrough into the producing well occurs mainly in a narrow area close to the straight current line connecting the producing and pressure wells. The dynamics of the current oil recovery coefficient depends on {{the properties of the}} displaced fluid, absolute permeability distribution in the filtration area, and set of limitations to exploitation of the operating producing and pressure wells...|$|E
40|$|New design {{concepts}} are demonstrated for twenty-four classes of laminate, {{which have been}} derived {{as part of an}} ongoing study on the development of a unified approach to the characterization of coupled laminates. This article presents a description of each class of coupled laminate; the vast majority possessing coupling behaviour not previously identified in the literature. Coupled laminates have potential applications in the: design of aero-elastic compliant rotor blades or aircraft wing structures, by introducing tailored Extension-Twisting and/or Shearing-Extension coupling at the laminate level or; design of thermally activated morphing structures, by exploiting more complex coupling behaviour. Results are presented which demonstrate various mechanical coupling responses, including thermally induced curvature predictions resulting from a high temperature cure process. However, the main focus of this article concerns the identification of laminates possessing complex mechanical couplings that remain hygro-thermally curvature stable; also referred to as <b>warp-free</b> laminates. The number of solutions for each class of coupled laminate is given together with example stacking sequences. These laminates contain standard cross-ply and/or angle-ply combinations, although double angle-ply laminates are also considered, and correspond to any standard fibre/matrix system with a constant ply thickness throughout...|$|E
40|$|Definitive listings of {{laminate}} stacking sequences {{are derived}} for balanced plain weave laminated materials, assuming each layer {{is composed of}} the same material with constant thickness throughout and that standard ply angle orientations 0, 90, and ± 45 ° are adopted; consistent with industrial design practice. A single layer of balanced plain weave material is shown to be immune to thermal distortion following a standard high temperature manufacturing process, which implies that all laminates constructed of this material possess what is {{commonly referred to as}} the hygro-thermally curvature-stable or <b>warp-free</b> condition, irrespective of the individual ply orientations used or the laminate stacking sequence definition. A single uncoupled parent laminate class is shown to contain sub-groups with extensionally isotropic and fully isotropic properties that are invariant with off-axis orientation of the principal material axes with respect to the system or structural axes. By contrast a single mechanically coupled parent laminate class is shown to give rise to seven unique forms of coupled laminate through judicious off-axis orientation. Invariant off-axis properties are also identified in coupled laminate designs. Finally, example calculations, abridged stacking sequence listings and design data are presented...|$|E
40|$|Conventional voxel-based group {{analysis}} of functional {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) data typically requires warping each subject’s brain images onto a common template to create an assumed voxel correspondence. The implicit assumption is that aligning the anatomical structures would correspondingly align the functional regions of the subjects. However, due to anatomical and functional inter-subject variability, mis-registration often occurs. Moreover, wholebrain warping is likely to distort the spatial patterns of activation, which {{have been shown to be}} important markers of task-related activation. To reduce the amount of mis-registration and distortions, warping at the brain region level has recently been proposed. In this paper, we investigate the effects of both whole-brain and region-level warping on the spatial patterns of activation statistics within certain regions of interests (ROIs). We have chosen to examine the bilateral thalami and cerebellar hemispheres during a bulb-squeezing experiment, as these regions are expected to incur taskrelated activation changes. Furthermore, the appreciable size difference between the thalamus and cerebellum allows for exploring the effects of warping on various ROI sizes. By applying our recently proposed 3 D moment-based invariant spatial features to characterize the spatial pattern of fMRI activation statistics, we demonstrate that whole-brain warping generally reduced discriminability of task-related activation differences. Applying the same spatial analysis to ROIs warped at the region level showed some improvements over whole-brain warping, but <b>warp-free</b> analysis resulted in the best performance. We hence suggest that spatial {{analysis of}} fMRI data that includes spatial warping to a common space must be interpreted with caution...|$|E
40|$|Experimental {{work has}} {{continued}} {{on the development}} and characterization of bulk and hot pressed powders and tapecast materials in the Bi-Sr-Ca-Cu-O and Tl-Ba-Ca-Cu-O systems. A process for producing <b>warp-free,</b> sintered, superconducting tapes of Bi composition Bi 2 Sr 2 Ca 2 Cu 3 O(x) with a mixed oxide process was established. This procedure required a triple calcination at 830 C for 24 hours and sintering at 845 C from 20 to 200 hours. Hot pressing the triple calcined powder at 845 C for 6 hours at 5000 psi yielded a dense material which on further heat treatment at 845 C for 24 hours exhibited a Tc of 108. 2 K. A further improvement in the processing of the bismuth materials was achieved via a chemical coprecipitation process wherein the starting nitrate materials were coprecipitated with oxalic acid, thus yielding a more chemically homogeneous, more reactive powder. With the coprecipitated powders, only one calcine at 830 C for 12 hours and a final sinter at 845 C for 30 hours was sufficient to produce a bulk superconducting material with a Tc of 108. 4 K. SAFIRE-type grounding links were successfully fabricated from sintered, tapecast, coprecipitated BSCCO 2223 powders. Compositional and processing investigations were continued on the Tl-based superconductors. Manganese and lithium additions and sintering temperature and time were examined to determine their influence on superconducting properties. It was found that lithium substitutions for copper enhance the transition temperatures while manganese additions produced deleterious effects on the superconducting properties. A suitable procedure for producing reproducible bulk and tapecast material of Tl composition Tl 2 Ba 2 Ca 2 Cu 3 O(x) was developed and used in fabricating uniform superconducting tapes. The highest transition temperature for Tl-based tapes was measured at 110. 2 K. Thallium superconducting SAFIRE-type grounding links were fabricated from the tapes...|$|E
40|$|This article {{presents}} definitive stacking sequence listings for tapered, <b>warp-free</b> balanced plain weave and non-crimp fabric (NCF) laminate designs {{with and without}} Extension-Shearing and/or Bending-Twisting coupling behaviour. With few exceptions, tapered designs for uni-directional (UD) material are currently certified only for balanced and symmetric laminate construction, despite the severe design constraint that 1 angle-ply termination therefore requires a further 3 angle-ply terminations. By contrast, an extensive design space has recently been discovered for tapered UD laminates with single ply terminations, including single angle-ply terminations, representing unconventional laminate designs with unbalanced and/or non-symmetric stacking sequences. Such designs give rise to Bending-Twisting and/or Extension-Shearing coupling: Extension-Shearing coupling, which arises in unbalanced construction, can be exploited to produce bending-twisting deformation in aircraft wing-box structures when top and bottom skins have identical bias fibre alignment, but equally, this can be eliminated with opposing bias fibre alignment; Bending-Twisting coupling, which is generally present in symmetric laminate construction, results in weaker compression buckling strength compared to the equivalent fully uncoupled laminate (with matching stiffness properties), but with potentially stronger shear buckling strength. Single ply terminations applied to NCF or balanced plain weave materials are equivalent to two adjacent ply terminations in traditional UD materials, and therefore introduce a constraint that may reduce the design space substantially, particularly in ‘thin laminate’ designs. However, this can be overcome by adopting ‘thin-ply’ or ‘spread-tow’ technology, which will allow an exponential increase in tailoring opportunities by bringing design flexibilities, found only in traditionally thick laminate construction, into the thin laminate domain. Thin-ply technology will, for instance, offer {{the prospect of a}} repeating 8 -ply NCF laminate, with a similar thickness to that of a single ply of traditional UD material. This design also follows the repeating bi-angle philosophy, possessing Extension-Shearing and Bending-Twisting coupling, but now with immunity to thermal warping distortions, which are eliminated in bi-angle laminates only when the number (r) of repeats becomes very large...|$|E
40|$|Tapered {{designs are}} {{currently}} certified only for balanced and symmetric laminate construction, despite the severe design constraint that 1 angle-ply termination requires a further 3 angle-ply terminations: two terminations to maintain balanced construction and a further two terminations to maintain symmetry. This constraint is often violated in practice, leading to localised thermal warping; {{the effects of}} which {{have yet to be}} quantified. An obvious, but somewhat controversial strategy for ‘thin laminate’ designs, with traditional uni-directional (UD) material, is to adopt unbalanced and/or nonsymmetric stacking sequence configurations to fully exploit the available design space, particularly where tapered designs are a requirement. This extended design space has previously been shown to contain <b>warp-free</b> laminates with either fully uncoupled mechanical properties or with Extension-Shearing and/or BendingTwisting coupling behaviour. Extension-Shearing coupling, which arises in unbalanced construction, can be exploited to produce bending-twisting deformation in aircraft wing-box structures when top and bottom skins have identical bias fibre alignment, but equally, this can be eliminated with opposing bias fibre alignment. Bending-Twisting coupling, which is generally present in symmetric laminate construction, results in weaker compression buckling strength compared to the equivalent fully uncoupled laminate (with matching stiffness properties), but with potentially stronger shear buckling strength. Recent studies on Extension-Shearing and Bending-Twisting coupled laminates have provided useful insight into the available design space for tapered laminates with single angle-ply or cross-ply terminations. Similar tailoring strategies are now applied to unconventional tapered laminate designs (i. e. those free from the ubiquitous symmetric and balanced, or un-balanced, design constraint) with two-ply terminations, to investigate the extent to which angleply layers can be terminated without introducing Extension-Shearing coupling, or the extent to which angle- and cross-ply combinations can be terminated to tailor or maintain Extension-Shearing throughout the tapered laminate. Consideration is also given to the potential effectiveness of introducing tailored mechanical coupling through ply terminations, e. g. to induce bending-twisting coupling in a wing-tip or winglet, using Extension-Shearing coupling at the laminate level, whilst maintaining fully uncoupled laminate behaviour in the tapered skins elsewhere in the wing-box...|$|E
