[...] "He was like, hey, I'll front you the money, and we'll split the profits until you pay me back," [...] {{recalled}} Hoppus in 2001. The two had met when Secor transferred from a north San Diego location. The two became friends quickly, despite Secor's seniority of post. [...] "At that point they'd played around enough to get their chops up so I took all the money I had in savings and <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> studio for two days," [...] said Secor.|$|E

500|$|Three {{weeks after}} Marky joined the band, the Ramones began {{recording}} Road to Ruin in Midtown Manhattan at Media Sound Studios, {{the premises of}} a former Episcopalian Church. [...] Album engineer Ed Stasium explained the recording process: [...] "After Tommy left the band, we went straight into working on the Road to Ruin album with Marky. We rehearsed a long time with Marky, just getting it down. Then <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> studio, recorded, and mixed the record at Media Sound. We {{spent a lot of}} money, and the entire summer, on Road to Ruin." [...] Music critic John Young of Rolling Stone called the album's production [...] "clean and simple", but pointed out that the track [...] "Bad Brain" [...] contained [...] "funny noises" [...] in between drum beats, which prevents the song from having the humorous asperity that was intended.|$|E
500|$|What {{is certain}} is that the breed took its name from Clumber Park and that the Duke of Newcastle's gamekeeper, William Mansell, is {{credited}} with their development and improvement. Prince Albert, the Prince consort of Queen Victoria, was a fancier and promoter of the breed, as was his son King Edward VII, who bred them at the Sandringham estate in Norfolk. The breed was shown in England from 1859 onward. They are referred to in Queen Victoria's diary: on October 16, 1840, she wrote, [...] "Walked out directly after breakfast before Albert went to shoot. He had his 7 fine Clumber Spaniels with us and <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Slopes, with such a funny old Gamekeeper, Walters, in order that I should see how the dogs found out their game. They are such dear, nice dogs." ...|$|E
500|$|Osbourne {{initially}} {{set out to}} form a solo project featuring former Dirty Tricks members John Frazer-Binnie, Terry Horbury, and Andy Bierne. As the new band were in rehearsals in January 1978, Osbourne had {{a change}} of heart and rejoined Black Sabbath. [...] "Three days before we were due to go into the studio, Ozzy wanted to come back to the band", Iommi explained. [...] "He wouldn't sing any of the stuff we'd written with the other guy (Walker), so it made it very difficult. <b>We</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> studio with basically no songs. We'd write in the morning so we could rehearse and record at night. It was so difficult, like a conveyor belt, because you couldn't get time to reflect on stuff. 'Is this right? Is this working properly?' It was very difficult for me to come up with the ideas and putting them together that quick." ...|$|E

500|$|Faye Marsay, who {{portrayed the}} Waif, spoke about her scenes and filming with Williams, saying, [...] " [...] I {{think we did}} a month in Belfast before we started shooting. <b>We</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> stunt tent and lived there. It was choreographed like a dance. Maisie is so well coordinated and good at what she does. I'm {{a little bit less}} coordinated and easily pissed off. I would drop the stick down and go, [...] "I can't do it!" [...] And she would {{encourage}} me. She's so supportive. We did a month, and then the day before the cameras turned on, we would go through the moves a couple of times so we wouldn't hurt each other. There were a few times we clipped each other. I remember getting her in the stomach really bad one time, and she nearly cut my ear off at one point. It was fun. It was a lot of fun, but we were exhausted as well." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{recording}} {{her debut}} studio album in 2005, Rihanna met Ne-Yo {{for the first}} time, {{but they could not}} collaborate on the album. She wanted to work with him since she heard [...] "Let Me Love You" [...] (2004) by Mario, which Ne-Yo wrote. When the production for A Girl like Me started, she considered working with him. She said, [...] "So for the second album, I was like, 'You know what? I have to work with that guy Ne-Yo.' So <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> studio and we started working on this song." [...] Ne-Yo and Norwegian production duo Mikkel S. Eriksen and Tor Erik Hermansen collectively known as StarGate wrote [...] "Unfaithful", which Rihanna said was [...] "new ground for [...] " [...] because it was a ballad. It was produced by StarGate while Debbie Mounsey served as a production assistant. [...] "Unfaithful" [...] was recorded by Eriksen, Al Hemberger, Malcolm Pollack and Tiger Stylz at Battery and Avatar Studios in New York City, Loft Recording Studios in Bronxville and Digital Insight Recording Studios in Las Vegas. It was mixed by Phil Tan and Makeba Riddick provided the vocal production.|$|E
500|$|The group {{moved to}} Macon, Georgia by May 1, where Walden was {{establishing}} Capricorn Records. The band performed locally, {{as well as}} eighty miles north in Atlanta's Piedmont Park, and practiced at the newly minted Capricorn nearly each day. The group forged a strong brotherhood, spending countless hours rehearsing, consuming psychedelic drugs, and hanging out in Rose Hill Cemetery, where they would write songs. Their first performances outside the South came on May 30 and 31 in Boston, opening for the Velvet Underground. In need of more material, the group remade old blues numbers like “Trouble No More” and “One Way Out”, in addition to improvised jams such as “Mountain Jam.” Gregg, who had struggled to write in the past, became the band’s sole songwriter, composing songs such as “Whipping Post" [...] and “Black-Hearted Woman.” Much of the material collected on The Allman Brothers Band was written between the period of May to August 1969 and premiered live. According to Johanson, the group gauged crowd reaction to the numbers and adjusted the songs accordingly. [...] "Before <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> studio, {{we had a very}} clear idea of what we were all trying to do musically and that it was unique, totally different from anything else that anyone was playing," [...] said Betts. [...] "From the earliest rehearsals, we all had the same mind-set." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the Tour de France, I took steroids. That {{is not a}} stimulant, just a strengthener. If I hadn't, I {{would have}} had to give up.

2500|$|Following {{the failed}} effort {{to record a}} new studio album, the Police {{effectively}} disbanded. In the liner notes to the Police's box set Message in a Box, Summers explains: [...] "The attempt to record a new album was doomed from the outset. The night before <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> studio Stewart broke his collarbone falling off a horse and that meant we lost our last chance of recovering some rapport just by jamming together. Anyway, it was clear Sting had no real intention of writing any new songs for the Police. It was an empty exercise." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 4 February 2013, it was {{announced}} that Rob Caggiano, formerly of Anthrax, had officially joined the band as second guitarist. He had been producing and recording guest solos on the band's upcoming album, Outlaw Gentlemen and Shady Ladies, which the band also announced will be released on 8 April 2013 (GSA on 5 April and US on 9 April), before being asked to join as a full-time member. Singer and guitarist Michael Poulsen said of the chemistry between Caggiano {{and the rest of the}} band [...] "The collaboration with Rob in the studio was so inspiring and in good spirit that we the decided to keep him. Basically <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> studio as a three piece and came out as a whole band!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Despite the {{nervousness}} of {{the band}} members, the recording sessions ran smoothly. [...] "We were so ready before <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> studio, we'd been rehearsing six or seven times a week, and we'd even been rehearsing in pitch black darkness in order to play the songs perfectly without even looking", Åkerfeldt recollected in 2009, speaking to Kerrang! However, the band regretted not having enough time to record the acoustic piece [...] "Requiem". The song was first recorded at Unisound, but the band was unhappy with the result. [...] "Requiem" [...] was then recorded in a studio in Stockholm with Pontus Norgren acting as co-producer. Due to a mix-up in Orchids mastering process, the end of [...] "Requiem" [...] was placed {{at the beginning of}} [...] "The Apostle in Triumph". The band has expressed regret for this, and said it was no fault of their own.|$|E
2500|$|According to Collins, [...] "What we're {{in court}} {{deciding}} {{seems to be}} a level or two down from what, before <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> jury, we supposed the trial was about, or had been initially about, which was who leaked [...] Some jurors commented at some point: 'I wish we weren't judging Libby. You know, this sucks. We don't like being here.' But that wasn't our choice." [...] Collins described how after 10 days of deliberations, [...] "What we came up with from that was that Libby was told about Mrs. Wilson nine times...We believed he did have a bad memory, but it seemed very unlikely he would not remember about being told about Mrs. Wilson so many times....Hard to believe he would remember on Tuesday and forget on Thursday." [...] Collins told the press [...] "Well, as I said before, I felt like it was a long, you know, haul to get this jury done. And if Mr. Libby is pardoned, I would have no problem with that." ...|$|E
2500|$|At the time, Vallance was {{primarily}} {{known as a}} songwriter, having written most frequently (and successfully) with Bryan Adams. [...] He also had some previous production experience, having produced one album apiece by Adams, Doug and the Slugs and CANO in the early 1980s. The band's lead vocalist Alan Frew recalled: [...] "It worked out great because we were {{all at the same}} stage of development. He didn't change the sound of the band at all. He let us experiment but wasn't afraid to get heavy-handed when he had to." [...] Vallance composed [...] "Don't Forget Me (When I'm Gone)" [...] with the band, while Adams provided backing vocals. Frew - [...] "On the very first day that we met Jim Vallance, he picked us up at the airport and to break the ice asked us what we were listening to. One was Tears For Fears. We went to his house and drank tea and listened to some tunes. 'Everybody Wants to Rule the World' came on and we really liked the shuffle beat. So <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> studio and based on this shuffle beat, we wrote 'Don't Forget Me (When I'm Gone)'. First day, first song." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "I'm a Rocker" [...] is a {{cover of}} the Chuck Berry track. To promote the album in Belgium, a Belgian film crew {{recorded}} the band performing the song at Portland Studios in London. The song was released as a single in Belgium in 1980, peaking at number one there. The song originally came to Holder's attention when it was played on Radio One by DJ Annie Nightingale. In a 1980 interview, Holder said: [...] "I really liked it [...] mentioned to {{the others in the}} band that I'd heard a really great Chuck Berry number". After spending time trying to get hold of a copy of the song, Holder obtained Berry's the album of the same name from an import shop. Holder revealed: [...] "After listening to it, we started to play it live on stage, first of all just as a jam {{at the end of the}} set. Then one night <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> studio, we'd been all over the pub, and we had half an hour left at the end of a session, and we decided to record it, and we got it down in one take. The feel is there in that song, it's us, Slade – it's what we are all about." ...|$|E
2500|$|On his {{recovery}} from illness Gartside returned to London {{and went straight}} into the studio with the group to begin recording the album {{at the end of}} 1980. It was recorded at Berry Street Studio in London, with the exception of [...] "Faithless" [...] which was recorded at Island Studios (now renamed Sarm Studios). The band were able to take their time with the recording and to employ guest musicians including Mike McEvoy and Joe Cang because their label Rough Trade paid each member a salary of £50 per week, as well as giving them a generous advance to record the album. Gartside explained that the album had taken several months to make because [...] "a lot of the ideas for this album, particularly lyrically, weren't finalised by the time <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> studio, so we decided to do a couple of days at a time. Also, we were working with Adam Kidron, who was at the time committed to Delta Five [...] and Pere Ubu and Orange Juice, so it took that much longer to complete. Plus the fact that there's quite a few other musicians playing on it, many of whom could only work two hour schedules." ...|$|E
2500|$|The song [...] "Iron Man" [...] was {{originally}} entitled [...] "Iron Bloke"; upon hearing the main guitar riff {{for the first}} time, Osbourne remarked that it sounded [...] "like a big iron bloke walking around". The title was later changed to [...] "Iron Man" [...] as bassist and lyricist Geezer Butler composed the lyrics. [...] The riff to [...] "Iron Man" [...] is iconic among heavy metal guitarists, with Osbourne declaring in his memoir that [...] "...Tony Iommi {{turned out to be}} one of the greatest heavy rock riff-makers of all time. Whenever <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> studio we'd challenge him to beat his last riff and he'd come up with something like 'Iron Man' and blow everyone away." [...] Butler wrote the lyrics as the story of a man who time travels into the future and sees the apocalypse. In the process of returning to the present, he is turned into steel by a magnetic field. He is rendered mute, unable verbally to warn people of his time of the impending destruction. His attempts to communicate are ignored and mocked. This causes Iron Man to become angry and have his revenge on mankind, causing the destruction seen in his vision. [...] "Electric Funeral" [...] also contains apocalyptic imagery dealing with nuclear warfare. In The Last Supper concert film, Iommi remembers that at the time with most bands [...] "it was all the 'flowers in your hair' and we wanted to sing and play about the other side of life." [...] In the 1992 documentary Don't Blame Me Osbourne concurs: [...] "It was me and five kids living in a two bedroom house. My father worked nights, my mother worked days, we had no money, we never had a car, we very rarely went on holiday... And suddenly, you know, we hear about 'If you're going to San Francisco be sure to wear a flower in your hair'. And we're thinking, (contemptuously) 'What the fuck is San Francisco? Where is this? What's all this flower shit? I've got no shoes on my feet. [...] "You could just see that a lot of things were going wrong in the world," [...] Butler recalled to Classic Albums in 2010, [...] "and no one was saying anything about it. Bob Dylan had long since faded from the present memory and there was nobody talkin' about the things that I wanted to talk about political stuff so that's what inspired me." ...|$|E
