Young also briefly played live with Ayers Rock in Australia, including an October 1975 show at the State Theatre in Sydney.

Araya asserts, [...] "We basically used whatever money we got to get from point A to point B. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> back, Brian was like, 'So, where's the money?'

500|$|Following their Edinburgh Fringe shows, {{the group}} enjoyed {{considerable}} {{success in the}} United Kingdom, making appearances on numerous BBC comedy shows. In 1988, the group was nominated for the Perrier Comedy Award for their performances at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. Fidler says that the British people were more receptive to their act at the time than Australians had been. [...] "The whole thing exploded for us <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> there, it was quite incredible. Within {{a very short time}} we were doing national television appearances in front of millions of people and playing these enormous shows," [...] he says. They played extensively in Canada, Germany, America and Britain, and finished their time in Britain by appearing on the final episode of the successful Friday Night Live. However, despite the acclaim they were receiving overseas, when they returned to Australia at the end of 1988 they remained unknown. Upon arriving in Melbourne, they struggled to gain a following and went back to busking on the streets.|$|E

Although his performances during August quickly improved, they were still not up to his previous standard and the Evening Post revealed on the 30th that Reading were preparing to sell him [...] "to a First Division club". After scoring in two successive Reading home wins on 4 and 7 September, against Walsall and Wrexham respectively, Friday {{took part in a}} third consecutive victory on the 13th, away against Northampton Town.

500|$|Colts {{head coach}} Weeb Ewbank cited {{injuries}} to fullback Alan Ameche {{as the key}} reason for the team's inability to win a third straight NFL championship. Ewbank hoped Perry could fill in the role if Ameche was not ready when the season began. Ameche retired prior to the season, and Perry filled in to lead the Colts in rushing in 1961, while catching a career-high 34 passes for 322 yards. [...] "Joe {{was the kind of}} guy you'd love to play your whole career with," [...] said Colts quarterback Johnny Unitas. [...] "He was older <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> him, but he did well for us. He was amazing on the screen pass, like McElhenny. And Joe clawed and scratched for every yard." [...] A thigh ligament injury caused him to miss several games in 1962 which, along with an injury to halfback Lenny Moore, severely hampered the Colts' running game. He was traded back to San Francisco in 1963, where he played a diminished role in his final nine games before retiring at age 36.|$|E

Kohan and Mutchnick joined long-time {{director}} James Burrows on the set as filming began. The cast and crew tried to remain cheerful in front of the live audience between takes while the writers gathered in a room to rework lines for potentially larger laughs.

Bennington commented on the collaborations, stating that [...] "We really felt like {{if we need to}} be inspired and move in another direction. I think <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> Page in, Mike had written this chorus and sang it, and his voice had this tone, and it was unlike anything I'd heard from him before.

500|$|The album {{opens with}} [...] "Wild Night", {{a hybrid of}} R, soul and country music influences, which {{utilizes}} a moderate 4/4 time signature and features the lead guitar playing of Ronnie Montrose. The song's intro was created, according to Montrose, [...] when [...] "One afternoon I was messing around with {{what is now the}} intro on the record, [...] stopped me and ... said ' ... that thing you just played ... that's the intro, don't forget it'". This guitar driven intro in Clinton Heylin's opinion made it one of Morrison's most memorable singles. [...] "Wild Night", which has been described by biographer Ken Brooks as [...] "a great start to the album", was first recorded after the Astral Weeks sessions in Autumn 1968 and was re-recorded numerous times before its eventual release on Tupelo Honey. Morrison recalled during an interview that the song was originally [...] "a much slower number, but <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> to fooling around with it in the studio, we ended up doing it in a faster tempo." ...|$|E
500|$|However, {{after the}} splendour of the premiere and the praise of some reviewers, when the Andersons {{departed}} {{on a tour}} of Britain to promote the film it was revealed that public interest was mediocre and box office revenue poor, as Gerry Anderson explains: [...] "When we got off the plane at the first destination we were told that the film was in trouble. Cinemas were apparently half-full. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> to the next big city we got more news that made us even more depressed – box office figures were inexplicably low wherever we went." [...] Anderson proposes that the presence of Thunderbirds on television damaged the chances of its big-screen transfer, asserting, [...] "The only thing we could think was that at that time the audience was not used to seeing a feature film version of a television show. So people would see Thunderbirds and think, 'We've seen it on television.'" [...] Sylvia Anderson offers a similar explanation: [...] "Although we still had our loyal television fans, they remained just that – firmly seated in front of their television screens and not in the cinema." ...|$|E
