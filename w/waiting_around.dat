25|$|In 2009, Stewart {{appeared}} alongside Ian McKellen as {{the lead}} duo of Vladimir (Didi) and Estragon (Gogo), in Waiting for Godot. Stewart had previously appeared only once alongside McKellen on stage, but the pair had developed a close friendship while <b>waiting</b> <b>around</b> on set filming the X-Men films. Stewart stated that performing in this play was the fulfilment of a 50-year ambition, having seen Peter O'Toole appear in it at the Bristol Old Vic while Stewart was just 17. Reviewers stated that his interpretation captured well the balance between humour and despair that characterises the work.|$|E

500|$|Thompson's {{first draft}} {{was more than}} three hundred {{handwritten}} pages, which required her to reduce it to a more manageable length. She found the romances to be the most difficult to [...] "juggle", and her draft received some criticism for the way it presented Willoughby and Edward. Doran later recalled the work was criticized for not getting underway until Willoughby's arrival, with Edward sidelined as backstory. Thompson and Doran quickly realised that [...] "if we didn't meet Edward and do the work and take that twenty minutes to set up those people... then it wasn't going to work." [...] At the same time, Thompson wished to avoid depicting [...] "a couple of women <b>waiting</b> <b>around</b> for men"; gradually her screenplay focused as much on the Dashwood sisters' relationship with each other as it did with their romantic interests.|$|E
500|$|... "Bad Omen" [...] {{explores the}} theme of occultism. Mustaine {{described}} [...] "Bad Omen" [...] like [...] "two happy campers who have stumbled onto a Satanic orgy {{in the middle of}} the woods" [...] and then [...] "they see these fools <b>waiting</b> <b>around</b> for Satan's blessing". Asked whether the band members really believe in the subject matters they write, Mustaine responded: [...] "We're aware of the subjects we write about—witchcraft, Satanic sacrifices and the like—but we're not condoning them." [...] "I Ain't Superstitious" [...] was written by Willie Dixon and originally recorded by Howlin' Wolf in 1961. However, Megadeth's version is vastly different from the original. [...] "My Last Words" [...] is about a game of Russian roulette and the fear one goes through when playing the game. Despite being one of the lesser known tracks on the record, music journalist Martin Popoff said that the song was an example of the band's [...] "fast thrashers" [...] and an evidence why Megadeth were dubbed as the [...] "fearless speed progenitors".|$|E
500|$|The {{evening of}} 2 October, Confederate pickets {{observed}} the three riverboats <b>waiting</b> <b>around</b> South Quay, Virginia, approximately [...] downriver from Franklin. [...] At 5:45a.m. the next day, the three ships began moving towards the city while shelling the nearby banks. The attack {{was led by}} the Commodore Perry, followed by the Whitehead astern the Hunchback. [...] While the Union shelled {{the banks of the}} Blackwater, Confederate troops began distributing themselves along the riverside {{to take advantage of the}} concealment there. Some of the 4th North Carolina Cavalry was dismounted and taken up by Colonel Marshall of the 52nd, and positioned along with his men at Crumpler's and neighboring bluffs to fire upon the riverboats. Colonel Ferebee took the rest of the 4th NC Cavalry and dismounted and positioned them behind the trees and bushes along the banks of the Blackwater, under the command of a Lieutenant Ruffin. [...] According to a Union naval officer later, the Confederate's forces along the Blackwater also included [...] "some nonuniformed irregulars and even 'some negroes.|$|E

In an early interview, she confessed to being an [...] "introvert, yet [...] extremely candid and blunt", reasoning: [...] "Total faith and complete belief in myself is my attitude towards life, films and virtually everything else. I am all about doing what I feel is right. It {{is not easy to}} pin me down as I can be a bundle of contradictions." [...] Journalist Subhash K Jha explained that while this approach has sometimes been at the cost of professional opportunities, it [...] "makes her such a favourite among the generation that believes in self regard being the highest form of creativity [...] She lives for the moment and crams all her intensity into it, not sparing a single thought for what is gone and what is <b>waiting</b> <b>around</b> the corner." [...] Meanwhile, Anu Ahuja suggested that Kapoor's demeanour is an act; she is [...] "cold and unapproachable so that no one will act funny with her".|$|E
500|$|Meeting the Detroit Red Wings for {{the second}} {{straight}} year in the Finals, Crosby won his first Stanley Cup with the Penguins in seven games. At 21 years, 10 months, and 5 days, Crosby became the youngest NHL captain to win a Stanley Cup championship since 1895. (The youngest captain to lead his team to the Stanley Cup {{in the history of the}} trophy is Mike Grant of the 1895 Montreal Victorias, who was 21 years and 2 months at the time.) In the deciding game seven, Crosby was forced to watch all but 32 seconds of the third period from the bench after suffering a knee injury less than halfway through the second period due to a hit from Johan Franzén. Following the game, Crosby was criticized by Detroit forward Kris Draper for neglecting to shake hands with some of Detroit's players, most notably captain Nicklas Lidström. An irate Draper was quoted as saying [...] "Nick was waiting and waiting, and Crosby didn't come over to shake his hand. That's ridiculous, especially as their captain." [...] Crosby replied afterward, saying, [...] "I just won the Stanley Cup. I think I have the right to celebrate with my teammates. I know it's not easy waiting around...I understand if they don't feel like <b>waiting</b> <b>around.</b> But you know what? It's the easiest thing to do in the world, to shake hands after you win. I had no intentions of trying to skip guys and not shake their hands. I think that was a pretty unreasonable comment." ...|$|E

2500|$|While many of O'Brien's {{professional}} advisors {{and managers}} {{pushed for the}} Fox deal, O'Brien's desire to one day perhaps take over The Tonight Show after Leno made it a difficult decision (O'Brien, like many baby-boomer comedians, had grown up idolizing Carson's incarnation). Chernin warned O'Brien that <b>waiting</b> <b>around</b> for Leno to leave would be [...] "only an invitation to long-term disappointment, and potentially a path toward undermining a promising career." [...] Nevertheless, O'Brien signed the deal with NBC in March 2002; the contract extended him through 2005 and most significantly contained an [...] "explicit Prince of Wales clause" [...] that solidified the official line of succession: If anything were to happen to Leno, O'Brien would step in. O'Brien's successful hosting job at the 2002 54th Primetime Emmy Awards [...] "sent out the most resounding message yet about his growing strength as a performer", and a year later, NBC broadcast O'Brien's tenth anniversary special in primetime. By the time Leno's contract again came up for renewal, a discussion would be needed regarding the future of The Tonight Show. Facing the prospect of attempting to keep both Leno and O'Brien, Zucker made the final call on Leno's deal: [...] "Yes, we’ll extend your deal. But this is your last contract. Time {{to hand over the}} keys." [...] The plan would extend Leno four additional years, after which he would give The Tonight Show to O'Brien.|$|E
2500|$|The {{sold out}} {{night on the}} last day of the month billed as [...] "The Pirate Metal Extravaganza" [...] would be the largest show that Ant had {{performed}} at since 1995. There was concern in the building as rumour had it (quite correctly) that Ant was still in Portsmouth, but fears were put aside just after 8pm as he turned up and headed off into the venue to chat to fans <b>waiting</b> <b>around</b> the merchandise stall. The evening was running late, but as the band – also named Adam Ant's Pirate Metal Extravaganza (as he explained at the start of the show) – went on, the place erupted, and rather than the expected half-hour set, the final running time was almost 3 times that, with a set consisting of several covers and a batch of Ant material spanning from 1977 to 1985, although one glaring omission from the set was the planned new single [...] "Gun in Your Pocket" [...] which was on the setlist but never performed. On this occasion, both Leggs and Love teamed up as double drummers (as had been the custom on several of Adam's previous backing bands, most notably Hughes and Miall in the early 1980s Ants), and two female backing vocalists (Sacha and Tasha), additional to Carr, were featured. Much of Adam's entourage were on the stage also, including promoter Simon [...] "Barnzley" [...] Armitage (also the designer of East-end fashion line Child of the Jago). Marc Almond and Simon Price were also in the audience that evening.|$|E
