500|$|The third parody {{recorded}} for {{the album was}} a parody of [...] "I <b>Want</b> <b>a</b> <b>New</b> Drug" [...] by Huey Lewis and the News entitled [...] "I <b>Want</b> <b>a</b> <b>New</b> Duck". After the recording of [...] "I <b>Want</b> <b>a</b> <b>New</b> Duck", Yankovic was comfortable with releasing the album as it was. However, Scotti Bros. insisted that Yankovic include a parody of a Cyndi Lauper song. Yankovic begrudgingly complied, producing [...] "Girls Just Wanna Have Lunch". Yankovic has cited {{it as one of}} his least favorite songs, and ultimately left it off his 1993 compilation album The Food Album. Yankovic also approached Prince about a potential parody of [...] "When Doves Cry", circa 1984. Prince refused, and did not accept any future parody ideas Yankovic presented to him.|$|E

500|$|Although the second-place {{finisher}} usually concedes the race, {{as happened}} in 2002 and 2010, Milne refused to concede. He considered requesting a recount, but did not do so, reasoning that it was [...] "extremely unlikely, almost unfathomable, that a recount would put either candidate above the 50 percent mark." [...] Before the election, Milne said that if Shumlin won a plurality, he would support him and would expect Shumlin {{to do the same}} if the situation were reversed.

The first session yielded four originals: [...] "Dare to Be Stupid", [...] "Cable TV", [...] "Slime Creatures from Outer Space", and [...] "One More Minute". The band also recorded a cover tune of the theme from [...] "George Of The Jungle". The following month, Yankovic began recording the four parodies and polka medley that would appear on the album, [...] "Yoda", [...] "Like a Surgeon", [...] "I <b>Want</b> <b>a</b> <b>New</b> Duck", [...] "Girls Just Want to Have Lunch", and [...] "Hooked on Polkas".|$|E

2500|$|Society today {{revolves}} around technology {{and by the}} constant need for the newest and most high-tech products we are contributing to mass amount of e-waste.

Electrical waste contains hazardous but also valuable and scarce materials. Up to 60 elements can be found in complex electronics. As of [...] 2013, Apple has sold over 796 million iDevices (iPod, iPhone, iPad). Cell phone companies make cell phones that are not made to last so that the consumer will purchase new phones.

2500|$|But the {{proposal}} {{did not receive}} support to pass the Maryland legislature, in spite of assurances that contributions from taxpayers would be limited strictly to city and state loans. On February 27, 1974, Maryland's Governor Mandel {{pulled the plug on}} the idea. Orioles owner Jerold Hoffberger was blunt: [...] "I will bow to the will of the people. They have told us what they want to tell us. First, they don't <b>want</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> park and second, they don't want a club." [...] Robert Irsay was willing to wait. [...] "It's not a matter of saying {{that there will be no}} stadium. It's a matter of getting the facts together so everybody is happy when they build the stadium. I'm a patient man. I think the people of Baltimore are going to see those new stadiums in New Orleans and Seattle opening in a year or two around the country, and they are going to realize they need a stadium ... for conventions and other things besides football." ...|$|E
2500|$|Moreover, Saxony and Russia, both {{of which}} had been Austria's allies in the Seven Years' War, were now allied with Prussia. [...] Although Frederick was weary of war in his old age, he was {{determined}} not to allow the Austrians such dominance in German affairs. [...] Frederick and Prince Henry marched the Prussian army into Bohemia to confront Joseph's army, but the two forces ultimately descended into a stalemate, largely living off the land and skirmishing rather than actively attacking each other. [...] Frederick's longtime rival Maria Theresa (Joseph's mother and co-ruler) did not <b>want</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> war with Prussia, and secretly sent messengers to Frederick asking for peace negotiations. [...] Finally, Catherine II of Russia threatened to enter the war on Frederick's side if peace was not negotiated, and Joseph reluctantly dropped his claim to Bavaria. [...] When Joseph tried the scheme again in 1784, Frederick created the Fürstenbund, allowing himself {{to be seen as a}} defender of German liberties, in contrast to his earlier role of attacking the imperial Habsburgs. In the process of checking Joseph II's attempts to acquire Bavaria, Frederick enlisted two very important players, the Electors of Hanover and Saxony along with several other second rate German princes. Perhaps even more significant, Frederick benefited from the defection of the senior prelate of the German Church (Archbishop of Mainz) who was also the arch-chancellor of the Holy Roman Empire, which further strengthened Frederick and Prussia's standing amid the German states.|$|E
