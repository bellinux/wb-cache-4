5|$|Thrasher and Blastus are {{two teenage}} robots <b>who</b> <b>live</b> <b>on</b> the planet of Insanus. Their planet is {{inhabited}} by murderous robots {{who seek to}} kill one another for no apparent reason. Slightly less horrific than their peers, the duo seek {{to make it through}} high school, and navigate their lives with mixed results. Thrasher (Patton Oswalt), a tall and lanky robot, wishes to gain the affections of an attractive female robot named Maimy (Jessie Cantrell). Meanwhile, Blastus (John Gemberling), a small and rotund robot, just wants to be popular. As with Blastus, unlike most robots on Insanus, he is mostly sensitive and non-criminal, much to the disapproval of his mother. In his quest to be cool, however, he is incredibly impulsive and overconfident in his abilities. Thrasher, though calm and reserved, often falls prey to Blastus' badly-thought out plans.|$|E
