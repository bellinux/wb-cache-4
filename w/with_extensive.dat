5|$|A {{search warrant}} {{executed}} on April 25, 2007, {{as part of}} a drug investigation of Vick's cousin Davon Boddie led to discovery of evidence of unlawful dog fighting activities at a property owned by Vick in rural Surry County in southeastern Virginia, <b>with</b> <b>extensive</b> facilities for the activity. Media attention quickly grew as state officials investigated, soon joined by federal authorities. As separate state and federal investigations progressed, more details emerged about an interstate dog-fighting ring that involved drugs and gambling. Gruesome details of abuse, torture, and execution of under-performing dogs galvanized animal rights activists and expressions of public outrage. Vick and several others were indicted on federal and Virginia state felony charges related to the operation.|$|E

5|$|After {{the end of}} the war, Arkansas {{participated in}} Operation Magic Carpet, the {{repatriation}} of American servicemen from the Pacific. She took around 800 men back to the United States, departing on 23 September, and reaching Seattle, Washington on 15 October. She made another three Magic Carpet trips between Pearl Harbor and the continental United States to ferry more soldiers home. During the first months of 1946, Arkansas lay at San Francisco. In late April, the ship got underway for Hawaii. She reached Pearl Harbor on 8 May, and departed Pearl Harbor on 20 May, bound for Bikini Atoll, earmarked for use as target for atomic bomb testing in Operation Crossroads. On 1 July, Arkansas was exposed to an air burst in ABLE, but survived <b>with</b> <b>extensive</b> shock damage to her upperworks, while her hull and armored turrets were lightly damaged.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{population}} {{now appears to}} be declining, the decrease is not rapid or large enough to trigger conservation vulnerability criteria. Given its high numbers and very large range, this thrush is therefore classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of least concern. The perceived decline {{may be due to the}} loss of invertebrate-rich pastures and mixed farms through conversion to arable agriculture or more intensively managed grassland. Adult survival, clutch size and fledging success are all lower in arable landscapes than in areas <b>with</b> <b>extensive</b> pasture. In Finland, the loss of ancient forests is thought to have led to a local decline.|$|E

In 1880, the Angel was refurbished internally for William Henry and Richard Baker, later to become large-scale pub owners. In 1883 the stables were sold to the London Street Tramways and the main building was sold to the brewers Truman, Hanbury, Buxton & Co. in 1896.|$|E

5|$|Castle Acre Castle {{was built}} by William de Warenne, the Earl of Surrey, in the manor of Acre during the 1070s. William was a Norman lord who had {{accompanied}} William the Conqueror in the conquest of England in 1066; he was rewarded <b>with</b> <b>extensive</b> estates across England. Acre was already an Anglo-Saxon estate centre {{and at the time}} of the invasion was owned by a wealthy man called Toki, but he was quickly replaced by Frederick, a Flemish lord and William's brother-in-law. When Frederick died around 1070, William acquired control of the manor, which formed part of his massive land holdings across the region.|$|E

5|$|Constant {{shelling}} had {{blocked the}} Ravebeek stream, creating an impassable swamp directly between {{the boundary of}} the 3rd Canadian and the 4th Canadian Divisions, necessitating a two-prong attack.

In the more restricted ground south of the Ravebeek stream, the 4th Canadian Division would occupy advanced positions in no man's land {{before the start of}} the offensive and take Decline Copse, which straddled the Ypres–Roulers railway. Currie planned the attack <b>with</b> <b>extensive</b> depth in resources. The remaining units of the 8th, 9th and 10th Canadian Infantry Brigades were placed in support, while the 7th, 11th and 12th Canadian Infantry Brigades were held in divisional and corps reserve.
