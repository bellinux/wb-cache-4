60|$|A whirl of {{conflicting}} ideas was battling {{in my own}} mind. What was I to do? Should I stand up now and denounce them before both passengers and Captain? Should I demand a few minutes' conversation with the latter in his own cabin, and reveal it all? For an instant I was half resolved to do it, but then the old constitutional timidity came back with redoubled force. After all {{there might be some}} mistake. Dick had heard the evidence and had refused to believe in it. I determined to let things go on their course. A strange reckless feeling came over me. Why should I help men <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>blind</b> to their own danger? Surely it was the duty of the officers to protect us, not ours to give warning to them. I drank off a couple of glasses of wine, and staggered up on deck with the determination of keeping my secret locked in my own bosom.|$|E
60|$|Yet did his beauty work him evil. For he grew proud, and cruel, and selfish. The {{children}} of the Woodcutter, and the other {{children of}} the village, he despised, {{saying that they were}} of mean parentage, while he was noble, being sprang from a Star, and he made himself master over them, and called them his servants. No pity had he for the poor, or for those <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>blind</b> or maimed or in any way afflicted, but would cast stones at them and drive them forth on to the highway, and bid them beg their bread elsewhere, so that none save the outlaws came twice to that village to ask for alms. Indeed, he was as one enamoured of beauty, and would mock at the weakly and ill-favoured, and make jest of them; and himself he loved, and in summer, when the winds were still, he would lie by the well in the priest's orchard and look down at the marvel of his own face, and laugh for the pleasure he had in his fairness.|$|E

40|$|The study {{investigated}} the teachers’ opinions about inclusion of children <b>who</b> <b>are</b> blind; the factors which may influence their opinions and what they think {{can be done to}} include children <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> in primary schools. It was a qualitative study which purposely involved five teachers from two primary schools. Data was collected through interviews. The centre of interest in the study was on the acceptance of children <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> by the teachers; participation of children <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> in classroom and outdoor activities, benefits of placing children <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> in mainstream primary schools, the challenges of including children <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> in the mainstream and what teachers think ca be done to overcome such challenges. The study findings revealed that the nature of attitudes the teachers had towards children <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>blind,</b> additional disability and class size determined the teachers’ acceptance of children <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>blind.</b> The teachers also believed that children <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> can <b>be</b> helped to participate in school activities through classroom and physical environmental modifications; curriculum modifications and provision of specialised equipment. Teachers felt that placement of children <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> in the mainstream can make them achieve social benefits; academic benefits and acquire special skills. The study findings also revealed that for successful inclusion of children <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>blind,</b> teachers needed support in the provision of special specialised equipment; collaboration with other professionals; construction and equipping the resource rooms where remedial support for children <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> can <b>be</b> exercised. The following challenges were expressed by the teachers: Lack of skills and competence, large class sizes and lack of specialised equipment. In order to overcome these challenges, teachers used various methods of teaching for example peer teaching, cooperative learning and team teaching. It is suggested that training and re-training of teachers in the filed of Special Needs Education, provision of specialised equipment, recruitment of more teachers and awareness seminars may help in the inclusion of children <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>blind...</b>|$|R

40|$|Studies of how {{children}} <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> acquire and use language have focused less on cognitive compensations {{and more on}} delays in development. Vision {{is important in the}} establishment of early communicative patterns, and sighted children regularly use contextual visual information, such as a speaker's gestures and eye gaze, to make sense of speech that is directed at them (Mills, 1988). Some researchers have argued that, in the absence of vision, children may be expected to have more difficulty understanding concepts and the relationships between them and in acquiring generalizations about language and the way it works (Andersen, Dunlea, & Kekelis, 1993). In contrast, {{it has been argued that}} linguistic experience may be more important for children <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> than for sighted children and that children <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> may pay more attention to language (Chomsky, 1990; Perez-Pereira & Castro, 1997). It seems that children <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> may show an uneven pattern of language development. Andersen et al.

40|$|Special events, such as fairs, conventions, ballgames, {{and concerts}} are {{typically}} activities people attend {{to participate in}} the festivities and enjoy with friends and family members. For individuals with disabilities, however, these types of events can create more challenges than enjoyment. Despite a thorough review of the literature, no studies were found which evaluated the experiences of individuals <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> and have visual impairments at events and meetings. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the current level of accessibility at meetings perceived by consumers <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> and visually impaired. Respondents to the survey indicated many obstacles to accessing meetings including: discrimination, a paucity of accessible features, and accessibility features that are not truly accessible for consumers <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> and visually impaired.

40|$|Unemployment and {{underemployment}} have, {{for many}} years, been {{a social and}} economic problem for people with disabilities. This study looks at consumers 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of access to employment for people <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> or vision impaired as one target group within the disability field. Using the Employment Access Questionnaire (EAQ), the perceptions of people <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> or vision impaired were compared with the perceptions of people <b>who</b> <b>are</b> not <b>blind</b> or vision impaired (nondisabled). Results of the study indicated that people <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> or vision impaired and people <b>who</b> <b>are</b> nondisabled view work as equally important in their lives. However, people <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> or vision impaired {{reported that they were}} significantly less satisfied with career development and services and training opportunities as compared with their peers <b>who</b> <b>were</b> nondisabled. A factor analysis of the data gathered from 85 blind or vision impaired and 84 nondisabled participants revealed a four factor structure for the EAQ.

We employed Value Sensitive Design (VSD) to ex-plore the potential of technology to enhance exercise for peo-ple <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> or low-vision. We conducted 20 semi-structured interviews about exercise and technology with 10 people <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> or low-vision and 10 people who facil-itate fitness for people <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> or low-vision. We also conducted a survey with 76 people to learn about outsider perceptions of hypothetical exercise with people <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> or low-vision. Based on our interviews and survey, we found opportunities for technology development in four ar-eas: 1) mainstream exercise classes, 2) exercise with sighted guides, 3) rigorous outdoors activity, and 4) navigation of exercise spaces. Design considerations should include when and how to deliver auditory or haptic information based on exercise and context, and whether it is acceptable to develop less mainstream technologies if they enhance mainstream ex-ercise. The findings of this work seek to inform the design of accessible exercise technologies. Author Keywords Accessibility; exercise; exergames; visual impairments...|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} focused on {{teachers}} experiences (ordinary teachers and specialist teachers) {{in the teaching of}} mathematics to children <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> in inclusive primary one classes in Uganda. The study was conducted in two districts from which one school was selected from each. A case study design with orientation to qualitative research approach was used. The sample comprised of two ordinary teachers and two specialist teachers (one category of each selected to represent each case). Data was collected from the interviewees through interviews. Findings obtained show that the interviewees faced similar experiences as regards the teaching of mathematics to children <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>blind.</b> These included use of extra time, repetition, variation in methods of teaching, variation in understanding among children <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>blind,</b> use of varied teaching and learning materials and the use of local language when teaching mathematics to children <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>blind.</b> However, the two categories of respondents faced some challenges for example language problem, inadequacy of the teaching learning materials, inadequacy of time, poor teacher collaboration and lack of parental involvement in the teaching of mathematics to their children <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>blind.</b> Findings stated how the above challenges could be overcome for example need for teachers commit more time to teaching mathematics to children <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>blind,</b> repetition of content taught, use of local language to supplement English when teaching mathematics, provision of Braille text books by Ministry of Education and Sports, use of local materials when teaching mathematics and full parental involvement...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present review is to examine the {{criticism}} of full inclusion that has been put forth in the United States by an organization for people <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> and by {{teachers of students with visual}} disabilities, in order to investigate the implications of these criticisms. The organization for people <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> criticized full inclusion on the grounds that there has been a lack of understanding of blindness-specific skills and, in the methods of teaching these skills (including separated settings), due significance had not been given to the emotional and social meaning of peer interactions for students <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> and their role as a member of society, and that the methods required for assisting them to attain social status have been treated as unimportant. Students <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> have <b>been</b> faced with isolation, poor training, and insufficient participation for society, although they have benefited from long-term education in an inclusive education system. A full inclusion setting definitely ought to be beneficial for students with mild mental retardation and learning disabilities; however, students <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> have failed to benefit from similar options, because they have not learned such matters as blindness-specific skills that they would have acquired ideally in a separate educational setting...|$|R
