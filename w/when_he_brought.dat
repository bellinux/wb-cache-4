5|$|Although the European colonial {{occupation}} of Egypt destroyed {{a significant portion}} of the country's historical legacy, some foreigners left more positive marks. Napoleon, for example, arranged the first studies in Egyptology <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>brought</b> some 150 scientists and artists to study and document Egypt's natural history, which was published in the Description de l'Égypte.|$|E
5|$|In 1531, the ikki {{control of}} Kaga was of such {{dominance}} that a conflict for leadership within the Hongan-ji embroiled the province {{in a civil}} war, often called the Daishō-Ikki, or Big League-Little League, war. A faction led by Renjun, a son of Rennyo, {{came to power in}} the Hongan-ji, and was hostile to the three main Kaga temples. In the resultant war, the three Kaga temples were backed by the Togashi clan, other powerful vassals, local Hongan-ji priests, and the ikki based in Echizen. Renjun was backed by many of the smaller temples and emerged victorious from the conflict <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>brought</b> in an Ikkō-Ikki army from Mikawa Province. Togashi Taneyasu was exiled, as were the other opposition leaders, and the position of shugo abolished.|$|E
5|$|Milan kicked-off {{the second}} half. Two {{minutes into the}} half, Liverpool had the first attack but Nesta tackled Gerrard before he could reach Kuyt's pass. Jankulovski {{received}} a yellow card in the 54th minute <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>brought</b> Pennant down. Immediately afterwards, Milan had an attack. Pirlo received the ball from a header by Clarence Seedorf, Pirlo played a high pass to Kaká who was ruled to be offside by the assistant referee, despite being behind the defence when the ball was played. Milan had another attack straight after the offside, but Liverpool defender Daniel Agger tackled Inzaghi before he could shoot. Liverpool had their first yellow card in the 59th minute when Javier Mascherano received one for bringing down Pirlo. After the yellow card, Liverpool decided to replace Boudewijn Zenden with Harry Kewell. Liverpool's best goalscoring chance of the match occurred minutes later. Gerrard capitalised on an error by Gattuso to be one-on-one with Dida, but his shot did not possess enough power to beat the Milan goalkeeper.|$|E

25|$|Under the {{direction}} of Sullivan, the divisions of Stirling and Stephen resisted the British attack stoutly for an hour. Stirling's command was forced to retreat first, though Conway acquitted himself well. Finally, Stephen's division was overwhelmed and compelled to withdraw.

25|$|Deslys {{had many}} admirers among royalty, most notably King Manuel II of Portugal, and her origins became {{the subject of}} dispute. A private detective claimed her true name was Hadiwga Nawrati, or Hedvika Navrátilová, and that she was a Czech peasant girl, born in the village of Horní Moštěnice, then part of the Kingdom of Hungary. The {{investigator}} reported that Deslys had denied her alleged mother's claim to kinship <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>brought</b> her to see the dancer, paying her a large amount of money to leave.

25|$|After 25 overs, England were 65 for 5, but the Australian spinners didn't get {{too much}} out of the track. Dot-balls flourished, but the {{partnership}} kept in there, and a second six – from Jones off Hogg – showed their intent. After 35 overs, England were 113 for 5, and required a run a ball, with four overs of Lee and three of McGrath still to negotiate. However, England kept pushing, never letting the run-rate get above 7. Skipper Ponting showed some desperation <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>brought</b> Michael Hussey on with nine overs to spare, knowing that the spinners couldn't keep it tight, but got his reward in Hussey's second over when Collingwood was run out for 53 – off 116 balls.|$|E
25|$|Orr {{then became}} a serious arson suspect {{and the subject of}} {{investigation}} and surveillance for several months. Orr was alerted to this surveillance effort on May 3, 1991, when he discovered and removed a tracking device that belonged to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) hidden under the bumper of the vehicle he was driving. However, Orr was apparently unaware of the fact that a Teletrac tracking device was later installed behind his dashboard <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>brought</b> his city vehicle for service on November 22, 1991. Meanwhile, a federal grand jury handed down an indictment, and shortly thereafter Orr was present at the scene of a suspicious fire, so a decision was made to end the surveillance, obtain an arrest warrant, and effect an arrest. Orr was arrested on December 4, 1991.|$|E

25|$|McDonald {{started his}} first class career with 32 wickets {{in his first}} ten games in 2003–04. His best spell was 6 for 67 against Western Australia. He was {{struggling}} however with the bat and despite batting at 4 {{at the start of}} the summer he would end it at number 8 in the batting order. Finger surgery the following season limited his appearances. In 2005–06 he played just four matches and only managed 83 runs and four wickets. Injury free, McDonald came into his own in the 2006–07 season. In the Pura Cup he boasted a batting average of over a hundred <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>brought</b> up his 500th run. He finished the season as only the 4th player in Sheffield Shield/Pura Cup history to reach the double of 750 runs and 25 wickets in a season.|$|E
25|$|Gagé and D'Albret remark an {{accentuation}} of the matronal {{aspect of}} Juno Regina that {{led her to}} be the most matronal of the Roman goddesses {{by the time of the}} end of the republic. This fact raises the question of understanding why she was able of attracting the devotion of the matronae. Gagé traces back the phenomenon to the nature of the cult rendered to the Juno Regina of the Aventine in which Camillus played a role in person. The original devotion of the matronae was directed to Fortuna. Camillus was devout to her and to Matuta, both matronal deities. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>brought</b> Juno Regina from Veii the Roman women were already acquainted with many Junos, while the ancient rites of Fortuna were falling off. Camillus would have then made a political use of the cult of Juno Regina to subdue the social conflicts of his times by attributing to her the role of primordial mother.|$|E
25|$|On 22 May 2017, Sangakkara {{announced}} that the following season {{would be his last}} in first-class cricket and that he would retire at the end of County Championship.

Edwards dominated the final laps of the 2016 Food City 500 to win the race after starting on pole. He also dominated nearly the whole race as he led 276 of 500 laps, holding off Dale Earnhardt Jr. and Kurt Busch on 4 restarts to win the race. On the final lap at Richmond, Edwards won the race after making a last-lap pass on teammate Kyle Busch, by moving him up the race track. He became the first driver to make a last lap pass in Richmond Speedway's history. This elevated him from 6th in the standings to 3rd.

25|$|Hubert has had {{the most}} success in the Craftsman Truck Series, scoring two top fives in fifteen races.

He had a wild ride during the 100th race in Craftsman Truck series history at Evergreen when he spun after contact from behind by David Starr through an opening in the inside wall and went into the infield. Amazingly, he didn't hit anything, but <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>brought</b> it into the pits seconds later, his brakes failed and his truck caught fire, sending him out. His best finish during the season, 17th, would come in the #7 Conely Racing Engines Chevrolet at Phoenix. He has yet to return to the Craftsman Truck Series since the 1999 season.|$|E
25|$|O'Brian used {{literary}} {{license in}} making Aubrey a Commodore while still a relatively junior captain, however this puts him equal in rank {{to the man}} who led the squadron in history, Commodore Rowley. In the novel, Aubrey was appointed directly by the Admiralty with the help of Maturin's persuasion, as Maturin had been at work on the intelligence side of the project. There are other differences from the historical event, one being that the French captain of the Vénus Hamelin survived the encounter, surrendering to the British, going on to honor in France. In contrast, Captain Corbett's reputation and death aboard ship match that of Robert Corbet, who was captain of Néréide and then given the Africaine <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>brought</b> the captured Caroline in to England. Lord Clonfert is fictional, in place of Nesbit Willoughby, who was captain of HMS Néréide; though Willoughby had a spotty career and took many wounds, he survived the battle and lived unmarried. Lord Clonfert takes the same splinter wound to the eye as Willoughby received. In the battle, Pym was taken prisoner by the French in the Battle of Grand Port in August 1810, released only when a later squadron from Cape Town re-took Île de la Passe in December 1810, freeing Pym and others taken prisoner. For the loss of his ship, Pym faced the usual court martial, and was exonerated of blame for the losses. In the novel, it is Captain Lord Clonfert who is left a prisoner in the action, seriously wounded, under the care of his own and French physicians until the squadron arrives under Admiral Bertie to accept the island's capitulation, but he does not live to face a court martial.|$|E
