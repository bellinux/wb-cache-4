5|$|Barriers to {{reproduction}} {{between two}} diverging sexual populations {{are required for}} the populations to become new species. Gene flow may slow this process by spreading the new genetic variants also to the other populations. Depending on how far two species have diverged since their most recent common ancestor, it may still be {{possible for them to}} produce offspring, as with horses and donkeys mating to produce mules. Such hybrids are generally infertile. In this case, closely related species may regularly interbreed, but hybrids <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>selected</b> against and the species will remain distinct. However, viable hybrids are occasionally formed and these new species can either have properties intermediate between their parent species, or possess a totally new phenotype. The importance of hybridisation in producing new species of animals is unclear, although cases have been seen in many types of animals, with the gray tree frog being a particularly well-studied example.|$|E

25|$|In general, each project's value will be {{estimated}} using a {{discounted cash flow}} (DCF) valuation, and the opportunity with the highest value, {{as measured by the}} resultant net present value (NPV) <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>selected</b> (applied to Corporate Finance by Joel Dean in 1951). This requires estimating the size and timing of all of the incremental cash flows resulting from the project.

25|$|In 2008, the PGA Tour Policy Board {{approved}} {{a change in}} the number of players that will make the cut. The cut will continue to be low 70 professionals and ties, unless that results in a post-cut field of more than 78 players. Under that circumstance, the cut score <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>selected</b> to make a field as close to 70 players as possible without exceeding 78. Players who are cut in such circumstances but who have placed 70th or worse will get credit for making the cut and will earn official money and FedEx Cup points. This policy affected two of the first three events with cuts, the Sony Open in Hawaii and the Buick Invitational. In late February, the Policy Board announced a revised cut policy, effective beginning with the Honda Classic. The new policy calls for 36-hole cut to the low 70 professionals and ties and, if that cut results in more than 78 players, a second 54-hole cut to the low 70 professionals and ties. Those who do not survive the 54-hole cut are designated as MDF (made the cut, did not finish).|$|E

500|$|HIV-2 is {{much less}} {{pathogenic}} than HIV-1 and is restricted in its worldwide distribution. The adoption of [...] "accessory genes" [...] by HIV-2 and its more promiscuous pattern of coreceptor usage (including CD4-independence) may assist the virus in its adaptation to avoid innate restriction factors present in host cells. Adaptation to use normal cellular machinery to enable transmission and productive infection has also aided the establishment of HIV-2 replication in humans. A survival strategy for any infectious agent is not to kill its host but ultimately become a commensal organism. Having achieved a low pathogenicity, over time, variants more successful at transmission <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>selected.</b>|$|E
