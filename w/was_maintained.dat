Complex, high-profile or unresolved cases were often deferred to the Minister of Justice in the capital or even the emperor.

5|$|Although {{social order}} <b>was</b> <b>maintained</b> {{throughout}} the plague years, {{the economy of}} the region was devastated.

This ensured almost complete control of Norwich trade by the merchants who now dominated the council.|$|E

As a Roman Catholic, he was not a political threat to Suharto.|$|E
