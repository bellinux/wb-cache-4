5|$|Although Godwin {{was fond}} of his children, he was, in many ways, ill-equipped to care for them. As Todd explains, he was {{constantly}} annoyed by their noise, demanding silence while he worked. However, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> trip to Dublin to visit Wollstonecraft's sisters, he missed the girls immensely and wrote to them frequently.|$|E

5|$|O'Reilly {{eventually}} removed Hutton {{and ended}} with 3/178 off 85 overs. Nevertheless, these compared favourably with Fleetwood-Smith's 1/298 off 87 overs. O'Reilly was the only Australian to {{take more than a}} solitary wicket, and rated Hutton's knock as the finest innings played against him. Australia collapsed to lose by an innings and 579 runs, the heaviest defeat in Test history. O'Reilly's lack of success went with The Oval Test in 1934, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> total of 4/151.|$|E
5|$|In 1836 Staunton came to London, {{where he}} took out a {{subscription}} for William Greenwood Walker's Games at Chess, actually played in London, by the late Alexander McDonnell Esq. Staunton was apparently twenty-six <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> serious interest in chess. He said that at that time the strongest players he saw in London, Saint-Amant and George Walker, could easily have given him rook odds. In 1838 he played many games with Captain Evans, inventor of the Evans Gambit, and also lost a match against the German chess writer Aaron Alexandre. He had improved sufficiently by 1840 to win a match against the German master H. W. Popert, a slow, cautious player with great defensive skill.|$|E

5|$|O'Sullivan and {{a second}} round pick in the 2005 NFL Draft were traded to the Green Bay Packers for Mike McKenzie on October 4, 2004. After the trade, O'Sullivan was {{inactive}} for 11 games as the third quarterback. He then played the first regular season game of his career on January 2, 2005 in the season finale, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> knee twice to end the game. He was also inactive for the team's Wild Card Round playoff game. He re-signed with the Packers on April 22, 2005. He was released by the team on September 3, 2005.|$|E
5|$|According to Geisel's biographers Judith and Neil Morgan, Horton Hatches the Egg {{was born}} in 1940, the day after New Year's, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> break from drawing in his Park Avenue {{apartment}} and went for a walk. When he returned, he noticed that he had left a window open in his studio and that the wind had blown one sketch on transparent paper on top of another, making it look like an elephant {{was sitting in a}} tree. This account was based on interviews with Geisel, who had told similar stories about the book's creation to reporters asking about his creative process since as early as 1957. The story had changed with each telling but always involved the fortuitous juxtaposition of drawings of an elephant and a tree.|$|E
5|$|After Wade's resignation, Crisp {{was again}} {{retained}} {{on the football}} staff. Working under Frank Thomas, Crisp continued in his role of line coach, and again won {{a share of the}} national championship after the 1934 season. Under Thomas, Crisp's role outside of his duties as the line coach was that of the team disciplinarian to compliment the soft-spoken, diplomatic style of Thomas. He continued in his role as line coach {{through the end of the}} 1941 season <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> leave of absence to serve as a civilian physical training instructor for the U.S. Navy pre-flight school at the University of Georgia. He then returned to Alabama and again served as line coach for the 1945 season, before he left to take an assistant coaching position with the Miami Seahawks.|$|E
50|$|His career came to {{an abrupt}} halt on a spring day in 1950, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>an</b> admiral aloft at the Navy's Lakehurst, New Jersey, base. Suddenly, a shaft snapped, and the tail rotor came apart.|$|R

5|$|Hepburn {{was known}} for being {{fiercely}} private, and would not give interviews or talk to fans for much of her career. She distanced herself from the celebrity lifestyle, uninterested in a social scene she saw as tedious and superficial, and she wore casual clothes that went strongly against convention {{in an era of}} glamour. She rarely appeared in public, even avoiding restaurants, and once wrestled a camera out of a photographer's hand <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> picture without asking. Despite her zeal for privacy, she enjoyed her fame, and later confessed that she would not have liked the press to ignore her completely. The protective attitude thawed as she aged; beginning with a two-hour-long interview on The Dick Cavett Show in 1973, Hepburn became increasingly open with the public.|$|E
5|$|On 16February 1944, the {{day after}} the {{contentious}} destruction of Monte Cassino, Eaton took No.3 Squadron through a break in the bad weather to attack the ruined monastery, the only one of No.239 Wing's units to successfully bomb its target that day. He handed over command of No.3 Squadron later that month, and was transferred to No.1 Mobile Operations Room Unit as forward air controller for the final assault on Monte Cassino. The run of luck that Eaton experienced in his first weeks of air combat in Tunisia continued on the ground in Italy. He survived three months of constant artillery fire, including an occasion when a shell exploded directly above his observation post, striking down a British officer standing next to him. He also came under machine-gun fire <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> wrong turn one day and drove into the German lines, but again escaped unhurt. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order on 7April, in recognition of his leadership of No.3 Squadron in North Africa, Malta, Sicily and Italy.|$|E
