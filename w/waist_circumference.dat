500|$|Obesity {{is one of}} {{the leading}} {{preventable}} causes of death worldwide. A number of reviews have found that mortality risk is lowest at a BMI of 20–25kg/m2 in non-smokers and at 24–27kg/m2 in current smokers, with risk increasing along with changes in either direction. This appears to apply in at least four continents. In contrast, a 2013 review found that grade 1 obesity (BMI 30-35) was not associated with higher mortality than normal weight, and that overweight (BMI 25-30) was associated with [...] "lower" [...] mortality than was normal weight (BMI 18.5-25). Other evidence suggests that the association of BMI and <b>waist</b> <b>circumference</b> with mortality is U- or J-shaped, while the association between waist-to-hip ratio and waist-to-height ratio with mortality is more positive. In Asians the risk of negative health effects begins to increase between 22–25kg/m2. A BMI above 32kg/m2 has been associated with a doubled mortality rate among women over a 16-year period. In the United States, obesity is estimated to cause 111,909 to 365,000 deaths per year, while 1 million (7.7%) of deaths in Europe are attributed to excess weight. [...] On average, obesity reduces life expectancy by six to sevenyears, a BMI of 30–35kg/m2 reduces life expectancy by two to fouryears, while severe obesity (BMI>40kg/m2) reduces life expectancy by tenyears.|$|E

In this cross-sectional primary prevention study, data on indicators of fat distribution (waist, hip, and middle-upper arm circumferences), body mass index (BMI), BP, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), lipid and glucose profile of 370 children and adolescents (180 M, 190 F, mean age 9. 5 years, (range 6 - 14 years)) were collected. Parents (502, 251 M, 251 F, age range 28 - 36 years), who gave their informed consent, underwent BMI, fat distribution, and BP measurements. There were 131 (35. 4 %) hypercholesterolemic subjects and 72 (19. 5 %) hypertensives. Using tests on medians, in comparison with 298 normotensives, the 72 hypertensives had higher levels of insulin (p < 0. 005) and no differences in cholesterol levels, age, and height.

Cardiovascular risk profiles were assessed, including fasting glucose, lipids, anthropometrics, blood pressure, intima-media thickness, and metabolic syndrome. We found significantly higher fasting glucose levels, larger <b>waist</b> <b>circumferences,</b> and a 5 -fold increased prevalence of hypertension in women {{with a history of}} preeclampsia as compared with control subjects (P< 0. 001).

Mean carotid intima-media thickness was increased in a subset of women after preeclampsia diagnosed with chronic hypertension as compared with those without hypertension (P< 0. 01). Metabolic syndrome was more prevalent both in women with a history of preeclampsia and their mothers (P< 0. 05).

40|$|Background: Recent {{studies have}} shown that adult human possess active brown adipose tissue (BAT), which might be {{important}} in controlling obesity. It is known that ß-adrenoceptor-UCP 1 system regulates BAT in rodent, but its influence in adult humans remains to be shown. The present study is to determine whether BAT activity can be independently stimulated by elevated catecholamines levels in adult human, and whether it is associated with their adiposity. Methodology/Principal Findings: We studied 14 patients with pheochromocytoma and 14 normal subjects who had performed both 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18 F-FDG PET/CT) and plasma total metanephrine (TMN) measurements during 2007 – 2010. The BAT detection rate and the mean BAT activity were significantly higher in patients with elevated TMN levels (Group A: 6 / 8 and 6. 762. 1 SUVmean? g/ml) than patients with normal TMN concentrations (Group B: 0 / 6 and 0. 460. 04 SUVmean? g/ml) and normal subjects (Group C: 0 / 14 and 0. 460. 03 SUVmean?g/ml). BAT activities were positively correlated with TMN levels (R = 0. 83, p, 0. 0001) and were inversely related to body mass index (R = 20. 47, p = 0. 010), visceral fat areas (R = 20. 39, p = 0. 044), visceral/total fat areas (R = 20. 52, p = 0. 0043) and <b>waist</b> <b>circumferences</b> (R = 20. 43, p = 0. 019). Robust regression revealed that TMN (R = 0. 81, p, 0. 0001) and <b>waist</b> <b>circumferences</b> (R = 20. 009, p = 0. 009) were the two independent predictors of BAT activities.
