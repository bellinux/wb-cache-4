5|$|On December 15, 1917, Major married H. Binga Dismond in a {{military}} ceremony at Camp Logan in Houston. They were divorced in 1933 but remained cordial. In 1942 she married musician Gilbert Holland, a baritone <b>whose</b> <b>voice</b> was heard frequently on radio programs of the 1930s. Her last marriage was to a prominent mortician from Atlantic City, New Jersey, John Richard Major. The ceremony took place in Buenos Aires during a trip they took to South America, probably in 1946. This was her third marriage and his fourth. She was widowed by 1953 and did not remarry during the remaining three decades of her life.|$|E
5|$|Pinfold is very {{protective}} of his privacy, but uncharacteristically agrees {{to be interviewed}} on BBC radio. The main inquisitor is a man named Angel, <b>whose</b> <b>voice</b> and manner disconcert Pinfold, who believes he detects a veiled malicious intent. In the weeks that follow, Pinfold broods on the incident. He finds his memory beginning to play tricks on him. The encroaching winter depresses him further; he decides to escape by taking a cruise, and secures passage on the SS Caliban, bound for Ceylon. As the voyage proceeds, Pinfold finds that he hears sounds and conversations {{from other parts of}} the ship which he believes are somehow being transmitted into his cabin. Amid an increasingly bizarre series of overheard incidents, he hears remarks which become progressively more insulting, and then directly threatening towards himself. The main tormentors are a man and a woman, whose vicious words are balanced by those of an affectionate younger woman, Margaret. He is convinced that the man is the BBC interviewer Angel, using his technical knowledge to broadcast the voices. Pinfold spends sleepless nights, awaiting a threatened beating, a kidnapping attempt and a seductive visit from Margaret.|$|E
25|$|The theme song, {{written by}} the show's co-writer David Croft and {{composer}} Ronnie Hazlehurst, consists of a lift girl (<b>whose</b> <b>voice</b> was provided by Stephanie Gathercole) announcing each floor over the musique concrète sounds of a cash register (which effectively serves as the only percussion instrument) and a simple musical accompaniment.|$|E

25|$|The {{production}} was short-lived but {{was followed by}} the 1974 original London production of The Good Companions, alongside John Mills, Judi Dench and Christopher Gable in which she played Susie Dean, a member of a touring concert party. She was flown to Manchester to join the show during its tryout when the original actress Celia Bannerman, <b>whose</b> <b>voice</b> had proved unsuitable for the role, left the production.|$|E
25|$|The play is in {{the form}} of verses that are metered and lyrical, sung by vocalists <b>whose</b> <b>voice</b> has been trained to various melodies (raga), music and {{synchronized}} with the dance-acting on the stage. The vocalists not only deliver the lines, but help set the context and express the inner state of the character by modulating their voice. For example, anger is expressed by the use of sharp high voice and pleading is expressed by the use of a tired tone.|$|E

25|$|On September 29, 1965, Channel 9 TV Cerro Corá, of Asunción, Paraguay, {{began its}} {{official}} transmissions, after successive stages of testing. Its first program was {{the inauguration of}} its transmitting plant. The broadcast began at 19:00 hours and was narrated by the speaker Ricardo Sanabria, who in that way became the first speaker <b>whose</b> <b>voice</b> was heard in the few existing television sets.

25|$|Welles's next turn as {{director}} was the film Mr. Arkadin (1955), which {{was produced by}} his political mentor from the 1940s, Louis Dolivet. It was filmed in France, Germany, Spain and Italy on a very limited budget. Based loosely on several episodes of the Harry Lime radio show, it stars Welles as a billionaire who hires a man to delve into the secrets of his past. The film stars Robert Arden, who had worked on the Harry Lime series; Welles's third wife, Paola Mori, <b>whose</b> <b>voice</b> was dubbed by actress Billie Whitelaw; and guest stars Akim Tamiroff, Michael Redgrave, Katina Paxinou and Mischa Auer. Frustrated by his slow progress in the editing room, producer Dolivet removed Welles from the project and finished the film without him. Eventually five {{different versions of the}} film would be released, two in Spanish and three in English. The version that Dolivet completed was retitled Confidential Report. In 2005 Stefan Droessler of the Munich Film Museum oversaw a reconstruction of the surviving film elements.|$|E

40|$|Several {{recent studies}} have {{examined}} an interaction between talker's acoustic characteristics and spoken word recognition in speech perception and have shown that listener's familiarity about a talker influences an easiness of spoken word processing. The present study examined the effect of listener's familiarity about talkers on the free recall task of words spoken by two talkers. Subjects participated in three conditions of the task: the listener has (1) explicit knowledge, (2) implicit knowledge, and (3) {{no knowledge of the}} talker. In condition (1), subjects were familiar with talker's voices and were initially informed <b>whose</b> <b>voices</b> they would hear. In condition (2), subjects were familiar with talkers' voices but were not informed <b>whose</b> <b>voices</b> they would hear. In condition (3), subjects were entirely unfamiliar with talker's voices and were not informed <b>whose</b> <b>voices</b> they would hear. We analyzed the percentage of correct answers and compared these results across three conditions. We will discuss the possibility of whether a listener's knowledge about the individual talker's acoustic characteristics stored in long term memory could reduce the quantity of the cognitive resources required in the verbal information processing...|$|R

500|$|In January 2010, Reubens reprised {{his role}} as Pee-wee and reused the set of Pee-wee's Playhouse (albeit {{slightly}} modified) for a short sketch on Funny or Die. In the sketch, Pee-wee comes home and shows off a brand-new iPad {{given to him by}} Steve Jobs. This leads to a long argument between him and his puppet friends, who point out all of the iPad's disadvantages – even Conky himself points out its flaws by stating that [...] "it looks like a giant iPhone". In the end, Pee-wee uses the iPad as a serving tray to hold glasses of milk and lemonade during a party being held at the Playhouse hours later. All the voices of the puppet characters are dubbed in by different actors than the TV series, except for Globey <b>whose</b> <b>voice</b> is still done by George McGrath.|$|E
500|$|Initially, {{a version}} of the song {{featuring}} the vocals of Romanian singer Alessia was released in early 2009, and drew comparisons to Inna's [...] "Hot" [...] (2008) at that time. The track was further credited to Bogdan Croitoru, also known as Fizz, which opted for the pseudonym of Bob Taylor. However, following a dispute over compensation, the artists decided to quit their collaboration and Alessia demanded her vocals to be replaced with others, although [...] "Déjà Vu" [...] had already experienced commercial success in Romania and had been heavily played in night clubs. Particularly, the track was handed to Inna to re-record. According to Alessia, <b>whose</b> <b>voice</b> is a semi-tone higher than Inna's, the latter had a disadvantage when re-recording the song as it was not in her tonality, and this could not be changed because the track was already finished.|$|E
