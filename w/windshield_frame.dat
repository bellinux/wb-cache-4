2500|$|The C4 {{represented}} a clean {{break from the}} previous generation of Corvette with a completely new chassis and modern, sleeker styling. Since emissions regulations were still changing and electronic engine management was in its infancy, horsepower was, compared to earlier generations, low. Therefore, the primary design emphasis, {{at least for the}} launch, was on handling and braking, with all-independent suspension with light-weight suspension and wheels, and all new brakes with aluminum calipers. The front suspension saw the C3's coil springs replaced by a transverse fiberglass mono-leaf spring, which was only 1/3 of the weight of the coil springs while also introducing an anti-roll bar-like effect on the front. The price of this no-holds-barred emphasis on handling was ride comfort, especially with the Z51 performance and handling package.

2500|$|In 2002, {{a concept}} Bel Air {{convertible}} was {{shown at the}} North American International Auto Show. It features a few styling and design cues from the best remembered tri-five (1955–57) models, such as the chrome <b>windshield</b> <b>frame,</b> traffic light viewfinder, and a gas filler cap behind the tail light, similar to 1956–1957 Chevy's gas cap behind the chrome trim {{on the back of}} the tail fin, but more reminiscent of the 1948–1958 Cadillac gas cap tail light.

40|$|Accident {{investigations}} {{have shown that}} in pedestrian-versus-vehicle accidents, windshield edges, A-pillars, cowls are the main sources for severe head injuries due to their high stiffness. To mitigate head injury severities, {{it is necessary to}} improve the safety performance of these structures. An A-pillar mounted airbag system (AMAS) was devised with the aim to prevent head from directly impacting against stiff structures such as A-pillars, <b>windshield</b> <b>frames</b> and edges. The airbags of the AMAS are installed inside A-Pillars. When a car strikes with a pedestrian, the airbag will break the A-Pillar cover and deploy along the whole A-Pillar to cover the stiff structures. In this study, the safety performance that can be provided by this system was evaluated by mathematical simulations. A finite element (FE) Ford Taurus car model and an EEVC headform model were used to simulate the pedestrian headform tests as proposed by EEVC. FE airbag models were developed and the influence of airbag parameters, including airbag type, inflow mass rate, vent size and deploy timing, were investigated by mathematical simulations. The safety performance of the AMAS was also evaluated by an FE human head model. The results show that this system can greatly reduce the head injury severity in case a pedestrian head impacts with A-pillar areas. Keywords...|$|R

The inclusion criteria were pedestrians: (a) aged 14 years or older, (b) with a height of 1. 5 m and taller, and (c) who were injured in an upright standing position via vehicle frontal collision. The injury odds ratios (ORs) calculated from logistic regression analyses were {{used to evaluate the}} association between selected injury predictors and the odds of sustaining pedestrian head, torso, and lower extremity injuries. These predictors included a crash factor (impact speed), pedestrian factors (age, gender, height, and weight), and vehicle factors (front bumper central height, front bumper lead, ground to front/top transition point height (FTTPH), and rear hood opening distance (RHOD)). Results showed that impact speed was a statistically significant predictor for head, torso, and lower extremity injury odds, as expected. Comparison of people 65 years of age and older to young adults aged 14 to 64 showed that age was also a significant predictor for torso (p< 0. 001, OR= 23. 8) and lower extremity (p= 0. 020, OR= 2. 44) injury odds, but not for head injuries (p= 0. 661).

40|$|This {{study was}} aimed at {{investigating}} the injury mechanism of pedestrian chests in collisions with passenger vehicles of various frontal shapes and examining {{the influence of the}} local structural stiffness on the chest injury risk by using the headform impact test at the chest contact area of the vehicle. Three simulations of vehicle to pedestrian collisions were conducted using three validated pedestrian finite element (FE) models of three pedestrian heights of 177 (AM 50 th), 165 and 150 cm and three FE vehicles,models representing a one-box vehicle, a minicar and a medium car. The validity of the vehicle models was evaluated by comparing the headform acceleration against the measured responses from headform impact tests. The chest impact kinematics and the injury mechanisms were analyzed in terms of the distribution of the von Mises stress of the ribcage {{and in terms of the}} chest deflections. The chest contact locations on the front panel and the bonnet top were identified in connection to the causation of rib fractures. The risk of rib fractures was predicted by using the von Mises stress distribution. The headform impact tests were carried out at the chest contact area on the front panel and bonnet to examine the safety performance with respect to pedestrian chest protection. In simulations of the one-box vehicle to pedestrian collisions, the chest was struck directly by the frontal structure at a high velocity and deformed substantially, since a shear force was generated by the stiff <b>windshield</b> <b>frame.</b> The acceleration of the headform was related to the rib deflections. The injury threshold of the ribcage deflection (42 mm) corresponded to the headform average acceleration of 68 G. In the minicar collision, the chest was struck with the bonnet top and cowl area at a low velocity, and the deformation was small due to the distributed contact force between the chest and the bonnet top. Besides, the ribcage deformation was too small for bridging a relation between the headform accelerations and rib deflections. In the medium car collision, the deformation mode of the chest was similar to that in the minicar collision. The chest collided with the bonnet top at a low velocity and deformed uniformly. The deflection of the ribs had an observable correlation with the headform accelerations measured in the headform impact tests. The frontal shape of a vehicle has a large influence on a pedestrian's chest loadings, and the chest deformation depends on the size of the pedestrian and the stiffness of the vehicle. The one-box passenger vehicle causes a high chest injury risk. The headform impactor test can be utilized for the evaluation of the local stiffness of a vehicle's frontal structure. The reduction of the headform acceleration is an effective measure for pedestrian chest protection for specific shapes of vehicles by efficacy in modifying the local structural stiffness...|$|E
