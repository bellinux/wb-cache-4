40|$|Energy {{storage is}} mostly {{achieved}} with batteries {{and is a}} huge challenge of 21 st century [1]. Despite the developments made by the microelectronic industry, the battery technology didn’t follow these breakthroughs [2]. Batteries are ideal power source devices because they provide stable voltage and allow the leveling of energy consumption. This is of special <b>concern</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> target <b>applications</b> are in <b>the</b> biomedical field or for long cycle operations without requiring human activity [3, 4]. Solid-state film lithium batteries present the highest volumetric energy density (800 Whl− 1) and gravimetric energy density (350 Whg- 1), very high cycle life and charge-discharge rates up to 5 C (only exceeded by super-capacitors) [4, 6].

40|$|Privacy {{preservation}} {{is a major}} <b>concern</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>application</b> of {{data mining}} techniques to large repositories of data consists of personal, sensitive and confidential information. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is a matrix factorization method, which can produces perturbed data by efficiently removing unnecessary information for data mining. In this paper two hybrid methods are proposed which takes the advantage of existing techniques SVD and geometric data transformations {{in order to provide}} better privacy preservation. Reflection data perturbation and scaling data perturbation are familiar geometric data transformation methods which retains the statistical properties in the dataset. In hybrid method one, SVD and scaling data perturbation are used as a combination to obtain the distorted dataset. In hybrid method two, SVD and reflection data perturbation methods are used as a combination to obtain the distorted dataset. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed hybrid methods are providing higher utility without breaching privacy...|$|R
