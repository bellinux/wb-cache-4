2500|$|Other secular writers {{questioned}} Yoakum's faith healing practices. [...] As {{early as}} 1903, Yoakum claimed his movement had performed some 800 healings, and the Los Angeles Times described Yoakum as the [...] "leading apostle of the 'faith-healing' movement in this city." [...] However, the Times noted discrepancies in the dates and {{circumstances of the}} [...] "healings" [...] under the headline [...] "Pouring Oil on the Sick ... Stories Don't Jibe." [...] In 1909, the Los Angeles Times published a lengthy article criticizing Yoakum's tactics. [...] The article, titled [...] "No Miracles Without Cash: Services Halt While Money Is Collected," [...] described events {{at one of the}} healing services held at Pisgah Home. [...] The Times opened by quoting the Pisgah Home motto: [...] "God loves a cheerful giver." [...] It then described a [...] "Healing and Testimony of the Healed" [...] service:"Collection boxes were placed on the grounds about the home and in the tabernacle, and an extra large one was on the platform, where Dr. Yoakum and his assistants perform their miracles. [...] A large audience was present, but the sight alone of the collection boxes did not draw the dollars quite fast enough for the doctor, so the testimony service was stopped long enough for him to tell how necessary it is for one to give away all his money before entering the kingdom of heaven. [...] Dr. Yoakum said that he performs such miracles as mentioned in the Bible, but that the one-tenth of a person's income {{for the purposes of the}} Lord was entirely too small, and that every one should give all their money to God's servants, or rather servant. [...] After his talk the large box was placed on the front of the platform with the simple statement that there were several more at hand should one not prove large enough to hold all. [...] This admonition opened the persons of many and soon the space around the platform was crowded with cheerful givers, many of whom looked as though they needed the money at home. ... Dr. Yoakum said: 'If you have a debt to pay, do not hoard your money in trying to pay it and be a tight-wad, but give it for God's work and he will find a <b>way</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> get along.'" ...|$|E

60|$|A gruff sound followed. 'Come, come, my dear lad, 'tis bad enough, but I'll {{do my best}} to make up to you.

6000|$|... "It {{is such a}} long <b>way</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> come, and {{you have}} so little time to stay when you are here, that I am {{thinking}} of asking your aunt to let you live here at the Mission, as a pupil, {{in the house of}} the Senora Hernandez, until your lessons are finished. Padre Jose will attend to the rest of your education. Would you like it?" ...|$|E

I think that the best <b>way</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> decide this would be to come home to my flat.

6000|$|Brown {{continued}} to chuckle. To hear {{that a man}} who knew Mantegazza and Darwin and Whitman and Browning could even think of shingling, was highly humorous, but as he studied my forlorn face he sensed the despairing quiver in my voice and his kind heart softened. He ceased to smile. [...] "Oh, you mustn't do that," [...] he said earnestly. [...] "You mustn't surrender now. We'll fix up some <b>way</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> earn your keep.

60|$|In it {{you will}} find a brief {{argument}} in favor of conventions--and although I wrote it myself I will say to you that it is conclusive upon the point and can not be reasonably answered. The right <b>way</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> do is hold your meeting and appoint delegates any how, and if there be any who will not take part, let it be so. The matter will work so well this time that even they who now oppose will come in next time.|$|E
6000|$|... "No. I'm {{tired of}} them: I'm not tired of you. This is the <b>way</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> feel most how much I rest on you." [...] Fleda had a compunction, {{wondering}} as {{they continued to}} stroll whether it was right after all to leave her. She believed, however, that if the flame might for the moment burn low, {{it was far from}} dying out; an impression presently confirmed by the way Mrs. Gereth went on: [...] "But one's fatigue is nothing. The idea under which one worked kept one up. For you I could--I can still. Nothing will have mattered if she's not there." ...|$|E

"Why, Dick," [...] she {{interrupted}} him, {{fired by}} a new thought, [...] "if I loved Evan as madly as you think, you would mean so little that I'd be content, {{if it were the}} only <b>way</b> out, <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> have a hunting accident.

6000|$|... "No, indeed," [...] {{the officer}} replied, laughingly. [...] "The best <b>way</b> is <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> {{go to the}} court yourself, and explain how it happened, unless he is really guilty, in which case I suppose {{he will have to}} go to the Island.

6000|$|... "I {{will not}} have your thanks," [...] {{promptly}} retorted Mrs. Bowen, [...] "for I mean you no kindness. I am trying to do my duty to Imogene, and when that is ended, all is ended.

6000|$|That, {{he said in}} reply, was {{the easy}} {{criticism}} that any one {{who came to the}} reading in a hostile spirit would make. They would fasten on that apparently weak point and not pay much {{attention to the fact that}} it is fairly met and answered in the book. When he first read the book it convinced him; but he had come to it with an open mind and I with a prejudiced mind on account of my religious ideas. He advised me to read it again, to read and consider it carefully with the sole purpose of getting at the truth. [...] "Take it," [...] he said, [...] "and read it again in the right <b>way</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> read it--as a naturalist." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So, {{one night}} when he sits by the fire, very sick, his head hanging down, I say, 'My son, I have learned the <b>way</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> {{go to the white}} man's land.' He looks at me, and his face is glad. 'Go,' I say, 'even as Yamikan went.' But Bidarshik is sick and does not understand. 'Go forth,' I say, 'and find a white man, and, even as Yamikan, do you kill that white man. Then will the soldier white men come and get you, and even as they took Yamikan will they take you across the salt lake to the white man's land. And then, even as Yamikan, will you return very fat, your eyes full of the things you have seen, your head filled with wisdom.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{is quite}} good enough," [...] Colonel Ochterlony said. [...] "But I should {{think that it}} would be the {{shortest}} and best <b>way</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> recommend him direct to Lord Lake, who would be able to put him in orders at once. At the same time, I will send to Calcutta a recommendation that some special reward should be granted to him. There will be a large number of forfeitures of the estates of those who have sided with Scindia and Holkar. I make no doubt that, on my strong recommendation, he will obtain a grant of the revenue of a village or two. Such a grant would do good by showing that instances of fidelity, even in the case of a private soldier, do not go unnoticed or unrewarded. We expect the general's arrival here in a couple of days." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{think it}} would, if you're as charming as you've {{tried to make}} me believe. Oh, I don't mean, to your own knowledge; but some people have ways of being charming without knowing it.

'My dear,' says he, 'I {{have been}} {{considering}} very much upon it, {{you may be}} sure, and {{though it is a}} piece of advice that has a great many mortifications in it to me, and may at first seem strange <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> yet, all things considered, I see no better <b>way</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> than <b>to</b> let him go on; and if you find him hearty and in earnest, marry him.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Viola again burst forth: [...] "They {{are always}} {{talking to me}} about the honor of being a medium, about the {{distinction}} of it, and when I ask what distinction the world gave to the Fox sisters or Home or Madame Cerillio, they answer that the world has changed since then. But it has not changed enough to make my work respected. Mr. Clarke says it ought to be; but saying so does not make it so. Every time I read of a medium exposed I turn cold and hot, for I know people consider all mediums alike. I don't want to go about all my life like an outcast. I don't want to be happy after I'm dead; I want to be happy now. I don't want to be different from other girls; I want to be like them. If they publish me, I will be a medium forever.

Think of the {{daughter}} coming at last, too late for her dear father, who had so wished for one. She is very healthy, I am thankful to say; and I am now so much better, that the doctor says I may sail next week. Major Keith has taken our cabins, in the Voluta, and soon after you receive this, I hope to be showing you my dear boys. They are such good, affectionate fellows; but I am afraid they would be too much for my dear aunt, and our party is so large, so the Major and I both think it will be the best <b>way</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> take a house for me for six months.

[...] "There is no need in any <b>way</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> come to any {{resolution}} on the subject at present; I shall be well content to wait until you come of age. As you say, by that time you will see whether this is but a brief wind of royal favour, or whether my Lord Walsingham designs to continue you in the royal service and to advance your fortunes. I find that I am able to get on on board a ship better than I had expected, and have no wish to retire from the sea at present; therefore {{there will be plenty}} of time for you to decide when you get to the age of one and twenty. Nevertheless this talk will not have been without advantage, for it will be far better for you not to have set your mind altogether upon court service; and you will then, if you finally decide to return to the sea, not have to suffer such disappointment as you would do had you regarded it as a fixed thing that some great fortune was coming to you. So let it be an understood thing, that this matter remains entirely open until you come to the age of twenty-one." ...|$|E
