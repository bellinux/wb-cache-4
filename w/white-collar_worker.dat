5|$|The plot {{revolves}} around the lives of three close friends: Keong (Jack Neo), a spendthrift <b>white-collar</b> <b>worker,</b> Ong (Mark Lee), a general contractor, and Hui (Henry Thia), a kopi tiam waiter. After an argument with his boss (Chen Zhao Jin), Keong quits his job and is unable to get another due to his poor command of English, lack of academic qualifications and computer illiteracy. With bills (especially instalments) to pay and a family to support, he goes heavily into debt whereupon his wife leaves him, taking their daughter with her. Ong borrows S$40,000 from loan sharks, and plans to repay them after collecting a debt owed him by a friend who subsequently runs away. The loan sharks beat up Ong for not repaying the loan within the two-week deadline, so he flees to Johor Bahru. Hui, who is single and lives with his elderly mother, wastes his meagre salary on 4D and pursuing an insurance agent who he has a crush on.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, {{straight}} {{after finishing}} Cold Feet, Bathurst went straight into filming My Dad's the Prime Minister, a series {{in which he}} portrays fictional British prime minister Michael Philips. The first series was broadcast in a Sunday afternoon CBBC slot in 2003. He watched debates in the House of Commons {{to prepare for the}} role but did not base his portrayal on Tony Blair. In 2003, he returned to theatre {{for the first time in}} four years to play Vershinin in The Three Sisters, opposite Kristin Scott Thomas and Eric Sykes. He had not seen The Three Sisters before starring in it. Director Michael Blakemore advised him to turn this to his advantage, as he would not feel he had to live up to previous portrayals. After its run concluded, a special edition of The Three Sisters was filmed with the same cast for television broadcast on BBC Four. In 2005, the second series of My Dad's the Prime Minister was broadcast, now moved to a Friday night time slot to take advantage of the adult humour. The same year, he starred in the ITV thriller The Stepfather playing Christopher Veazey, a man whose daughter goes missing. Bathurst was pleased that this <b>white-collar</b> <b>worker</b> had an emotional side, in comparison to David Marsden, whom he used as a yardstick when accepting those sorts of roles. Also in 2005, he played Mr Sesseman in an adaptation of Heidi and Dottore Massimo in The Thief Lord.|$|E

30|$|Our results {{point to}} {{substantial}} differences across workers. Downward real wage rigidity is higher for <b>white-collar</b> <b>workers,</b> younger workers {{and those with}} lower earnings and bonus payments. These findings {{may be explained by}} a greater risk of shirking and higher hiring costs for <b>white-collars</b> <b>workers,</b> and also by the existence of automatic age-related pay rises for most <b>white-collar</b> <b>workers</b> in Belgium. Younger workers may have a higher propensity to leave in the event of wage cuts, but they also receive lower bonuses and premia.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the formation and}} modification of yakuin-shoyo in Japan. Yakuin signifies directors and auditors in these days. Soon after the Meiji Restoration, however, yakuin signified directors and <b>white-collar</b> <b>workers,</b> because National Bank Act of 1872 used this term in this way and many companies were established {{in accordance with the}} act. <b>White-collar</b> <b>workers</b> were stipulated in company's articles. Moreover, bonuses were paid not only to directors but also to <b>white-collar</b> <b>workers,</b> of which amounts were determined as a certain percentage of profits in some companies. <b>White-collar</b> <b>workers</b> were under the scheme of profit-sharing. After the commercial code, which was enforced in 1893, however, the influence of National Bank Act became weak and today's usage of yakuin prevailed very fast. Stipulations of articles on <b>white-collar</b> <b>workers</b> disappeared and bonuses to them were paid as costs after the reform of the commercial code of 1899. ...|$|R

In the Company of Men was a critical success, winning Best First Film at the 63rd annual New York Film Critics Circle Award.

30|$|Our point {{estimates}} {{imply that}} the estimated fraction of <b>white-collar</b> <b>workers</b> subject to DRWR is 10 percentage points {{higher than that of}} blue-collar workers. Campbell (1997) reports evidence for the US where nominal wage rigidity is more prevalent, showing that nominal wages of <b>white-collar</b> <b>workers</b> are much less responsive to the aggregate unemployment rate than blue-collar workers’ wages. This result is consistent with the shirking model of Shapiro and Stiglitz (1984) and with the turnover model of Stiglitz (1974). These models are {{based on the idea that}} firms may be less inclined to cut wages of <b>white-collar</b> <b>workers</b> because they are more difficult (costly) to replace and to monitor, and therefore are more likely to shirk their jobs. Franz and Pfeiffer (2006) report survey evidence for Germany indicating that the main reasons for wage rigidity of high-skilled workers are the existence of specific skills and the negative signal a wage cut may represent for newly-hired staff. In Belgium, in addition, <b>white-collar</b> <b>workers</b> obtain automatic wage increases with age or tenure, while this is rarely the case for blue-collar <b>workers.</b> This makes <b>white-collar</b> <b>workers</b> less likely to experience real wage cuts.|$|R

2500|$|... "Okies" [...] {{were the}} 250,000 hard-luck {{migrants}} {{who fled the}} Dust Bowl and depression in Oklahoma and neighboring states in the 1930s {{in search of a}} better future. Many sought farm labor jobs advertised in the Central Valley. They were harshly disparaged at the time. Police were stationed at the Arizona line to keep them out, and the state legislature passed a law to keep them out, but it was overturned by the United States Supreme Court. Historian James Gregory has explored the long-term impact of the Okies on California society. Gregory finds that most came from urban backgrounds, and one in six had been a <b>white-collar</b> <b>worker.</b> He notes that in The Grapes of Wrath, novelist John Steinbeck saw the migrants becoming active agitators for unions and the New Deal, demanding higher wages and better housing conditions. Steinbeck did not foresee that most Okies would move into well-paid jobs in war industries in the 1940s. The children and grandchildren of the Okies seldom returned to Oklahoma. They did leave the farms and became concentrated in Southern California's cities and suburbs. Long-term cultural impacts include a commitment to evangelical Protestantism (especially the Pentecostals and the Southern Baptists), a love of country music, populist conservatism of the sort that boosted Reagan, and strong support for traditional moral and cultural values.|$|E

30|$|Job-hopping {{is not a}} new {{phenomenon}} in China, {{especially when it comes to}} highly skilled <b>white-collar</b> <b>workers.</b> Twenty years ago, in the mid- 1990 s, with foreign investment growing fast, the demand for <b>white-collar</b> <b>workers</b> extended beyond the available pool of skilled labor.

Job-hopping became the quickest way to improve one’s standard of living, and many executives changed companies at almost an annual pace. ‘Job-hopping fever’ was the topic of many newspaper and magazine articles, as well as a common point of conversation in corporations.” (Duthie 2005) Job-hopping may have slowed down, and salary increases may not be as high as they were before, but there is still quite a number of opportunities open to <b>white-collar</b> <b>workers.</b>|$|R
