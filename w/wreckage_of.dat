While surveying the stored <b>wreckage</b> <b>of</b> the train crash that he survived, David recalls the car accident that ended his athletics career, remembering that he was unharmed and ripped a door off the car {{in order to save}} Audrey. David used the accident as an excuse to quit football because Audrey did not like the violence of the sport.|$|E

The ecological landscape of Haiti is used to represent the <b>wreckage</b> <b>of</b> the Revolution, being initially described as fertile and bountiful with the plantations, but later as worn down and bare. The powerful climate of the Caribbean is more similar to Africa than Europe, making nature an ally of the slaves. Natural elements also act on their own, with Henri Christophe's Citadel being attacked by fungi and thunderstorms before its completion.|$|E

2500|$|The {{day after}} the accident, all {{that could be seen}} of the Advance was [...] "one of the masts, some planking, and a {{confused}} heap of rigging, sails, and tackle". A few scraps <b>of</b> <b>wreckage</b> and part <b>of</b> the deckhouse were strewn across a nearby beach.|$|R
5|$|Offshore, a 30,000ton freighter, the MV Korean Star, {{sustained}} extreme damage {{during the}} storm. Rough seas caused {{the hull of}} the ship to break and the vessel was separated into two pieces. Although the freighter was in two pieces, the ship did not sink and the <b>wreckage</b> <b>of</b> it came ashore near Cape Cuvier. No one on the ship sustained injury as all 19 crew members abandoned ship. The crew was rescued within a day of sustaining the damage and flown to Carnarvon.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the first}} {{theories}} considered by investigators was that Flight 2511 {{was involved in a}} collision with another airliner, given the crash site's proximity to Wilmington Airport. Investigators reviewed the flight plan and other documents to determine if other aircraft were in the area. There was no record of any other aircraft, or of any military missiles having been fired. Furthermore, <b>wreckage</b> <b>of</b> Flight 2511 was confined to two general locations: the primary crash scene near Bolivia and the secondary scene in Kure Beach. All debris was accounted for as belonging to the DC-6.|$|E

The United States had direct evidence that the ISI chief, Lt. Gen. Ahmed Shuja Pasha, knew of bin Laden’s presence in Abbottabad, Pakistan. After the raid, there was an unconfirmed report that Pakistan allowed Chinese military officials to examine the <b>wreckage</b> <b>of</b> the crashed helicopter.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} storm watch was issued for Bermuda on August27 but swiftly canceled {{the next day}} as Danielle steered well clear of the island. Swells from the powerful hurricane reached the East Coast of the United States, leading to the rescues of 250 people in Ocean City, Maryland and an additional 70 people {{off the coast of}} Central Florida. The body of a man—whose death appeared to have been from drowning—was pulled from the waters of Satellite Beach, Florida; a second man went missing in Ocean City, but his body was never recovered and the search was eventually called off. Researchers examining the <b>wreckage</b> <b>of</b> RMS Titanic were forced to seek refuge in St. John's, Newfoundland; swells as large as 10ft (3m) impacted the coastline of Newfoundland.|$|E

5|$|Harvey's charred corpse {{was taken}} from the <b>wreckage</b> <b>of</b> Q turret in the {{aftermath}} of battle and buried at sea with full honours alongside the other 98 fatal casualties Lion had suffered. His bravery in the face of certain death did not go unnoticed; he was mentioned by name in Admiral Jellicoe's post-battle dispatch and he was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross. Harvey's widow Ethel was presented with the award at Buckingham Palace by King George V on 15 September 1916. His medal group was later loaned to the Royal Marines Museum, Eastney Barracks by his son Lieutenant-Colonel John Malcolm Harvey of the King's Regiment in 1973. Harvey's name is inscribed on the Chatham Naval Memorial to those with no known grave, administered by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission.|$|E
5|$|In July 1942, Harada was {{reassigned to}} the {{aircraft}} carrier Hiyō. In early October of that year, the carrier departed Japan {{to take part in}} the Guadalcanal Campaign. On 17 October, Harada formed part of the escort for a force of torpedo bombers which were attempting to attack targets on Guadalcanal. American Grumman F4F Wildcats attacked this force, and while Harada probably downed a Wildcat, his aircraft was badly damaged. His plane crash-landed near the Japanese base at Rekata Bay on Santa Isabel Island, and Harada had to dig himself out from underneath the <b>wreckage</b> <b>of</b> his plane with his bare hands. Harada was later returned to Japan on board a hospital ship.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, the company's former test pilot, Lou Leavitt, had {{purchased}} the <b>wreckage</b> <b>of</b> the XR-1A {{at a price}} of 4 cents per pound. Leavitt had formed a new company, Helicopter Air Transport, intending to provide helicopter flight training {{in anticipation of a}} postwar aviation boom, and he returned the XR-1A to flying condition. The projected boom failed to materialise, however, and HAT quickly entered bankruptcy, Leavitt selling the XR-1A to Frank Piasecki, another former Platt-LePage employee who had now started his own helicopter company. Piasecki soon grounded the aircraft due to airworthiness concerns, and used the airframe {{in the development of the}} PA-2B, a planned tiltrotor which failed to proceed beyond the mock-up stage.|$|E
