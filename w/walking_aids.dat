500|$|People with Huntington's {{disease may}} see a {{physical}} therapist for non-invasive and non-medication-based ways of managing the physical symptoms. Physical therapists may implement fall risk assessment and prevention, as well as strengthening, stretching, and cardiovascular exercises. <b>Walking</b> <b>aids</b> may be prescribed as appropriate. Physical therapists also prescribe breathing exercises and airway clearance techniques {{with the development of}} respiratory problems. Consensus guidelines on physiotherapy in Huntington's disease have been produced by the European HD Network. Goals of early rehabilitation interventions are prevention of loss of function. Participation in rehabilitation programs during early to middle stage of the disease may be beneficial as it translates into long term maintenance of motor and functional performance. [...] Rehabilitation during the late stage aims to compensate for motor and functional losses. For long-term independent management, the therapist may develop home exercise programs for appropriate people.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Some {{adults with}} type 2 {{diabetes}} mellitus (T 2 DM) have comorbidities and mobility impairments that limit their exercise capacity. In consideration of this, we developed and piloted a program called Active Steps for Diabetes for people with T 2 DM, comorbidities, and mobility impairments. The {{purpose of this paper}} was to report outcomes for the pilot program. Methods: Active Steps for Diabetes, an 8 -week program, included instruction on diabetes self-care andgroup and home exercise programs. Twenty-two females (62. 7 ± 6. 1 yrs) with T 2 DM and self-reported mobility impairments completed the program. Six participants used a <b>walking</b> <b>aid.</b> Outcome measures included two risk factors for coronary artery disease [daily physical activity and body mass index (BMI) ], cardiovascular fitness (6 -minute walk distance), and knowledge of diabetes-specific exercise guidelines. A two-way repeated measures ANOVA was used to compare outcomes before and after the program and between participants who did and did not use a <b>walking</b> <b>aid.</b> Results: Active Steps for Diabetes was effective in increasing daily physical activity in both groups of subjects (<b>walking</b> <b>aid</b> group: 2. 6 days/week [95 % confidence interval (CI) = 2. 1 to 3. 3]; no <b>walking</b> <b>aid</b> group: 1. 9 days/week [95 % CI= 1. 2 to 2. 5]). This was accompanied by increases in 6 -minute walk distances (<b>walking</b> <b>aid</b> group: 54. 0 m [95 % CI = 36. 4 to 71. 6]; no <b>walking</b> <b>aid</b> group: 62. 6 m [95 % CI= 55. 7 to 69. 4]). Changes in BMI were not significant (<b>walking</b> <b>aid</b> group: − 0. 4 [95 % CI = − 1. 2 to 0. 4]; no <b>walking</b> <b>aid</b> group: −. 24 [95 % CI = −. 91 to. 44]). Increases in knowledge of diabetes-specific exercise guidelines were observed in both groups (<b>walking</b> <b>aid</b> group: 18. 8 % [95 % CI = 11. 3 to 26. 4]; no <b>walking</b> <b>aid</b> group: 19. 3 % [95 % CI = 16. 1 to 22. 5]). Discussion:: Physical inactivity and low cardiovascular fitness are predictors of CAD morbidity and mortality in adults with T 2 DM. This pilot program suggests that a model for diabetes education, incorporating exercise programs developed by a physical therapist, may increase physical activity, improve endurance, and thereby potentially reduce CAD risk in people with T 2 DM and mobility impairments from comorbidities...|$|R

Timed Up & Go {{test score}} in {{patients}} with hip fracture {{is related to the}} type of <b>walking</b> <b>aid.</b> OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationship between Timed Up & Go (TUG) test scores and type of <b>walking</b> <b>aid</b> used during the test, and to determine the feasibility of using the rollator as a standardized <b>walking</b> <b>aid</b> during the TUG {{in patients with}} hip fracture who were allowed full weight-bearing (FWB). DESIGN: Prospective methodological study. SETTING: An acute orthopedic hip fracture unit at a university hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Patients (N= 126; 90 women, 36 men) with hip fracture with a mean age +/- SD of 74. 8 +/- 12. 7 years performed the TUG the day before discharge from the orthopedic ward. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The TUG was performed with the <b>walking</b> <b>aid</b> the patient was to be discharged with: a walker (n= 88) or elbow crutches (n= 38). In addition, all patients also performed the TUG using a rollator. RESULTS: Patients who performed the TUG with a walker were on average 13. 6 (95 % confidence interval [CI], 11. 2 - 16. 1) seconds faster using a rollator compared with the walker (P. 833, P<. 001). CONCLUSIONS: TUG scores are significantly related to the type of <b>walking</b> <b>aid</b> used during the test in patients with hip fracture who are allowed FWB when discharged from the hospital, but all patients were able to perform the TUG using the rollator as a standardized <b>walking</b> <b>aid.</b> Our findings indicate the importance of using a standardized <b>walking</b> <b>aid</b> when evaluating changes or comparing TUG scores in patients with hip fracture...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} {{influence}} of balance support on the energy cost of treadmill and overground walking in ambulatory patients with stroke. Design: Cross-sectional. Setting: Research laboratory at a rehabilitation center. Participants: Patients with stroke depending on a <b>walking</b> <b>aid</b> in daily life (n= 12; <b>walking</b> <b>aid</b> dependent ambulators) and <b>walking</b> <b>aid</b> independent ambulators (n= 12), all able to walk for at least 5 minutes. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Energy cost (J. kg(- 1). m(- 1)) and temporal gait parameters (walking speed, mean and coefficient of variation of stride time, and symmetry index) were obtained during 4 walking trials at preferred walking speed: overground with and without a cane and on a treadmill with and without handrail support. Results: On the treadmill, handrail support resulted in {{a significant decrease in}} energy cost of 16 %, independent of the group. Although <b>walking</b> <b>aid</b> dependent ambulators had on average a larger reduction in energy cost than <b>walking</b> <b>aid</b> independent ambulators (19 % vs 14 %), this interaction did not reach statistical significance (P=. 11). Interestingly, overground walking with support resulted in an 8 % reduction in energy cost for <b>walking</b> <b>aid</b> dependent ambulators, but a 6 % increase for <b>walking</b> <b>aid</b> independent ambulators. The reduction in energy cost with support was accompanied by changes in temporal gait parameters, most notably an increase in stride time and symmetry and a decrease in stride time variability. Conclusions: Balance support can result in a significant reduction in the energy cost of walking in stroke patients, the magnitude of which depends on walking ability and the walking task. Impaired balance control should not be overlooked as a contributing factor to the increased energy cost of walking in patients with stroke, and improving or assisting balance control should be considered to reduce the energy cost of hemiplegic gait.
