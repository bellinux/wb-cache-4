5|$|Gregory legislated on the {{behaviour}} of {{the laity}} and the clergy. He placed the new mission directly under papal authority {{and made it}} clear that English bishops <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> authority over Frankish counterparts nor vice versa. Other directives dealt with the training of native clergy and the missionaries' conduct.|$|E
5|$|The breaker (Channel 1 Aerosurfaces, ASA 1) {{is part of}} the shuttle's Flight Control Systems (FCS), a {{subsystem}} of the guidance, navigation, {{and control}} (GNC) systems. The failure <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> impact to the mission, due to redundant systems.|$|E
5|$|An {{extraterrestrial}} civilization {{might bring}} to Earth pathogens or invasive life forms {{that do not}} harm its own biosphere. Alien pathogens could decimate the human population, which <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> immunity to them, or they might use terrestrial livestock or plants as hosts, causing indirect harm to humans. Invasive organisms brought by extraterrestrial civilizations could cause great ecological harm because of the terrestrial biosphere's lack of defenses against them.|$|E

5|$|Anne {{soon learned}} that she <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> say in her son's care. James {{appointed}} {{as head of the}} nursery his former nurse Helen Little, who installed Henry in James' own oak cradle. Most distressingly for Anne, James insisted on placing Prince Henry in the custody of John Erskine, Earl of Mar at Stirling Castle, in keeping with Scottish royal tradition.|$|E
5|$|Fanning {{said the}} second part of the song, which {{contained}} the controversial lyrics, was written following the Queensland Director of Public Prosecutions passing down its finding in the death in custody case. He said that the band believed the song <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> bearing on the legal procedure, they would nonetheless include an alternative version of the song on Dream Days at the Hotel Existence.|$|E
5|$|Other {{observations}} in Hurricanes Anita, David, Frederic, and Allen {{also discovered that}} tropical cyclones have very little supercooled water {{and a great deal}} of ice crystals. The reason that tropical cyclones have little supercooled water is that the updrafts within such a system are too weak to prevent water from either falling as rain or freezing. As cloud seeding needed supercooled water to function, the lack of supercooled water meant that seeding <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> effect.|$|E
60|$|He {{had made}} {{allowances}} for her, but the ideal girl <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> need of allowances. The ideal girl would be plucky, cheerfully valiant, a fighter. She would not admit {{the existence of}} hard luck.|$|R

5|$|Paulus van der Sloot {{was arrested}} on 22 June 2005, for {{questioning}} in Holloway's disappearance. He was ordered released on 26 June {{after three days of}} questioning. According to Aruba's chief prosecutor, one of the Kalpoe brothers told investigators that Paulus, who at the time was training to be a judge, advised that without a body, the police <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> case. Beth Holloway pursued Van der Sloot's parents in the ensuing media circus on Aruba. She said that Paulus acknowledged that they could not control their son and had sent him to a psychiatrist.|$|E
5|$|Realizing {{that the}} plains Indians <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> {{experience}} on water, the townspeople fled prudently from the Comanche raiders {{to the safety}} of the water. They were saved by remaining aboard small boats and a schooner captained by William G. Marshall, which was at anchor in the bay. While safe in the water, the refugees witnessed the destruction and looting of their town, unable to do a thing except curse them.|$|E
5|$|Such a shell <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> net {{gravitational}} interaction with its englobed star (see shell theorem), and could drift {{in relation to}} the central star. If such movements went uncorrected, they could eventually result in a collision between the sphere and the star—most likely with disastrous results. Such structures would need either some form of propulsion to counteract any drift, or some way to repel the surface of the sphere away from the star.|$|E
5000|$|At {{least one}} scholar {{has argued that}} Khomeini's [...] "decrees, sermons, interviews, and {{political}} pronouncements" [...] have outlasted his theological works {{because it is the}} former and not the latter that the Islamic Republic of Iran [...] "constantly reprints." [...] Without the decrees, sermons, interviews, and political pronouncements [...] "there <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been <b>no</b> Khomeinism ideology. Without Khomeinism there <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been <b>no</b> revolution.

5|$|Unlike Conviction, {{the game}} <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> {{interactive}} torture sequences. Instead, players could choose whether {{to kill or}} incapacitate a target after interrogation. The system was not complex, and {{it was hoped that}} players would choose based on instinct. According to Béland, every player choice is gray and there are no right or wrong choices. However, the game demo has an interactive torture scene in which players can decide how deeply a knife penetrates a person's shoulder. After a mixed-to-negative response, Ubisoft removed the scene from its final product.|$|E
5|$|As {{soon as the}} two armies {{were drawn}} up, a clamour arose from the German ranks, loudly {{demanding}} that Chnodomar and his entourage of chiefs should dismount and lead {{the main body of}} German foot warriors from the front. Chnodomar and the chiefs immediately complied. In so doing, Chnodomar forfeited any strategic control of the battle, as, trapped in the centre of the action, he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> way of knowing what was happening in other sectors. Julian, on the other hand, maintained a detached position throughout (with his escort) and so was able to respond to events all over the field, such as the initial rout of his cavalry. It is unclear exactly where Julian was stationed but it was likely in the gap between the two Roman lines.|$|E
5|$|Augustus' brother, Otto, {{devised the}} scheme to corner United Copper, {{believing that the}} Heinze family already {{controlled}} {{a majority of the}} company. He also believed that a significant number of the Heinze's shares had been borrowed, and sold short, by speculators betting that the stock price would drop, and that they could thus repurchase the borrowed shares cheaply, pocketing the difference. Otto proposed a short squeeze, whereby the Heinzes would aggressively purchase as many remaining shares as possible, and then force the short sellers to pay for their borrowed shares. The aggressive purchasing would drive up the share price, and, being unable to find shares elsewhere, the short sellers <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> option but to turn to the Heinzes, who could then name their price.|$|E

50|$|If {{the vendor}} {{disposed}} {{of a thing}} that was not in commercio, such as a temple or a religious place, he was liable to the vendee for any loss that the latter might have incurred by the error. A stipulator in a similar case <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> remedy.|$|R
5|$|Despite his {{affection for}} Mary, Henry was deeply {{disappointed}} that his marriage had produced no sons. By the time Mary {{was nine years}} old, {{it was apparent that}} Henry and Catherine <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> more children, leaving Henry without a legitimate male heir. In 1525, Henry sent Mary to the border of Wales to preside, presumably in name only, over the Council of Wales and the Marches. She was given her own court based at Ludlow Castle and many of the royal prerogatives normally reserved for the Prince of Wales. Vives and others called her the Princess of Wales, although she was never technically invested with the title. She appears to have spent three years in the Welsh Marches, making regular visits to her father's court, before returning permanently to the home counties around London in mid-1528.|$|E
5|$|Ernest, Hereditary Prince of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, {{was born}} at Ehrenburg Palace in Coburg on 21 June 1818. He was the elder son of Ernest III, Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld and his first wife Princess Louise of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg. He was soon joined by a brother, Prince Albert, who would later become the husband of Queen Victoria. Though Duke Ernest fathered {{numerous}} children in various affairs, the two boys <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> other legitimate siblings. In 1826, their father succeeded as Ernest I, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha through an exchange of territories {{after the death of}} the duke's uncle, Frederick IV, Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg.|$|E
5|$|General Amherst, the British {{commander-in-chief}} in North America, was {{in overall}} charge of administering policy towards Native Americans, which involved both military matters and {{regulation of the}} fur trade. Amherst believed that with France out of the picture, the Native Americans <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> other choice than to accept British rule. He also {{believed that they were}} incapable of offering any serious resistance to the British Army; therefore, of the 8,000 troops under his command in North America, only about 500 were stationed in the region where the war erupted. Amherst and officers such as Major Henry Gladwin, commander at Fort Detroit, made little effort to conceal their contempt for the Native Americans. Native Americans involved in the uprising frequently complained that the British treated them no better than slaves or dogs.|$|E

5|$|He {{was offered}} the job as manager of Second Division club Middlesbrough on his 38th {{birthday}} in 1973. He {{declined to be interviewed}} for the position, and instead handed the club a list of responsibilities he expected to take, which if agreed to would give him total control of the running of the club. He refused a contract, and would never sign a contract throughout his managerial career. He took a salary of £10,000 a year despite the chairman being willing to pay a lot more; his only stipulations were a gentleman's agreement that he would not be sacked, assurances that he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> interference from the board in team affairs, and three days off a week for fishing and shooting. He decided to first repaint Ayresome Park and to publicise the upcoming league campaign so as to generate higher attendance figures.|$|E

Icke {{had been sent to}} heal the Earth, she said, and would become famous but would face opposition. The spirit world was going to pass ideas to him, which he would speak about to others. He would write five books in three years; in 20 years a new flying machine would allow us to go wherever we wanted and time <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> meaning; and there would be earthquakes in unusual places, because the inner earth was being destabilized by having oil taken from the seabed.|$|E

Worried that there would not be enough subscribers to support the magazine and hoping to ensure a good reception from traditional groups, the founders sent letters to leaders of ten sultanates in the archipelago asking that they subscribe to the magazine; however, only Syarif Muhammad Alkadrie, the sultan of Pontianak, agreed to subscribe.|$|E
