The show coincided {{with the opening of}} Vine's major show at Modern Art Oxford and <b>was</b> <b>prompted</b> <b>by</b> Thomson's anger that the material promoting her show did not mention her time with the Stuckists. Tate chairman Paul Myners visited both shows.|$|E
5|$|Second-generation {{technologies}} include {{solar heating}} and cooling, wind power, modern forms of bioenergy, and solar photovoltaics. These are now entering markets {{as a result}} of research, development and demonstration (RD) investments since the 1980s. Initial investment <b>was</b> <b>prompted</b> <b>by</b> energy security concerns linked to the oil crises of the 1970s but the enduring appeal of these technologies is due, at least in part, to environmental benefits. Many of the technologies reflect significant advancements in materials.|$|E
5|$|The Keating Five scandal <b>was</b> <b>prompted</b> <b>by</b> the {{activities}} of one particular savings and loan: Lincoln Savings and Loan Association of Irvine, California. Lincoln's chairman was Charles Keating, who ultimately served {{five years in prison}} for his corrupt mismanagement of Lincoln. In the four years after Keating's American Continental Corporation (ACC) had purchased Lincoln in 1984, Lincoln's assets had increased from $1.1 billion to $5.5 billion.|$|E

5|$|After the festival, the Wagner family {{journeyed to}} Venice for the winter. Wagner {{died of a}} heart attack at the age of 69 on 13 February 1883 at Ca' Vendramin Calergi, a 16th-century palazzo on the Grand Canal. The legend that the attack <b>was</b> <b>prompted</b> <b>by</b> {{argument}} with Cosima over Wagner's supposedly amorous interest in the singer Carrie Pringle, who had been a Flower-maiden in Parsifal at Bayreuth, is without credible evidence. After a funerary gondola bore Wagner's remains over the Grand Canal, his body was taken to Germany where it was buried in the garden of the Villa Wahnfried in Bayreuth.|$|E
5|$|On March 11, 1996, the Seattle City Council {{designated}} the exterior and {{roof of the}} original 1931 building as a Seattle city landmark, having approved a recommendation from the Landmarks Preservation Board. The move <b>was</b> <b>prompted</b> <b>by</b> a long-term proposal from The Seattle Times Company to redevelop their land in South Lake Union, {{at a cost of}} $150 million while preserving the historic character of the two buildings. The plans included two 10-story office buildings, a larger printing plant, and a multilevel parking garage.|$|E
5|$|The 1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt, {{commonly}} referred to as the August Coup, <b>was</b> <b>prompted</b> <b>by</b> the slow disintegration of the Soviet Union that resulted from Gorbachev's reform policy and Yeltsin's drive towards an independent Russia. The New Union Treaty being prepared called for further decentralisation of power to the republics, which weakened the government's already tenuous hold on the economy. Pavlov received a draft of the New Union Treaty on 12 August at a Security Council meeting and managed to get it published in the Moscow News on 14 August.|$|E

In January 2010, the American military released the names of 645 detainees held at the Bagram Theater Internment Facility in Afghanistan, modifying its long-held position against publicizing such information. This list <b>was</b> <b>prompted</b> <b>by</b> a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit filed in September 2009 by the ACLU, whose lawyers had also requested detailed information about conditions, rules and regulations.|$|E
5|$|The {{psychiatric}} incarceration {{of certain}} individuals <b>was</b> <b>prompted</b> <b>by</b> {{their attempts to}} emigrate, to distribute or possess prohibited documents or books, to participate in civil rights protests and demonstrations, and become involved in forbidden religious activities. The religious beliefs of prisoners, including those of well-educated former atheists who had become adherents of a religious faith, {{was considered to be}} a form of mental illness that required treatment. The KGB routinely sent dissenters to psychiatrists for diagnosing to avoid embarrassing publiс trials and to discredit dissidence as the product of ill minds. Highly classified government documents which have become available after the dissolution of the Soviet Union confirm that the authorities consciously used psychiatry as a tool to suppress dissent.|$|E
5|$|After {{leaving the}} University of Alabama, Applewhite moved to Houston, Texas, in 1965 {{to teach at}} the University of St. Thomas. His {{students}} regarded him as an engaging speaker and a stylish dresser. He served {{as chair of the}} music department; he also became a locally popular singer, serving as the choral director of an Episcopal church and performing with the Houston Grand Opera. In Texas, he was briefly openly gay but also pursued a relationship with a young woman, who left him under pressure from her family, greatly upsetting him. He resigned from the University of St. Thomas in 1970, citing depression and other emotional problems. Robert Balch and David Taylor, sociologists who studied Applewhite's group, speculate that this departure <b>was</b> <b>prompted</b> <b>by</b> another affair between Applewhite and a student. The president of the university later recalled that he was often mentally jumbled and disorganized {{near the end of his}} employment.|$|E

5|$|Although he {{initially}} agreed to these demands, on January 17, 1868, Yoshinobu {{declared that he}} would not be bound by the Restoration proclamation and called for its rescission. On January 24, he decided to prepare an attack on Kyoto, occupied by Satsuma and Chōshū forces. This decision <b>was</b> <b>prompted</b> <b>by</b> his learning of a series of arsons in Edo, starting with the burning of the outerworks of Edo Castle, the main Tokugawa residence. This was blamed on Satsuma rōnin, who on that day attacked a government office. The next day shogunate forces responded by attacking the Edo residence of the daimyō of Satsuma, where many opponents of the shogunate, under Takamori's direction, had been hiding and creating trouble. The palace was burned down, and many opponents killed or later executed.|$|E
5|$|Amtrak {{announced}} in October 1976 that the North Coast Hiawatha {{would be the}} second train, after the Empire Builder, to receive the new bi-level Superliner coaches, then on order from Pullman Standard. In the end the train was cancelled before the Superliners entered long-distance service. In the spring of 1977 Amtrak added seven hours to the schedule, increasing it to 52 hours 30 minutes. The change <b>was</b> <b>prompted</b> <b>by</b> new speed restrictions on Amtrak trains after a rash of derailments involving the new EMD SDP40F diesel locomotives. In September Amtrak eliminated the off-day ChicagoSt. Paul service, leaving the North Coast Hiawatha with three trips a week. Amtrak reduced the Empire Builder to quad-weekly service as well. The Twin Cities Hiawatha returned as a daytime service between Chicago and Minneapolis.|$|E
5|$|An earlier {{administrative}} and political {{function of the}} area was {{to serve as a}} core area for one of the three provincial things that together elected the king of Denmark. The first Danish administrative sub-divisioning occurred as part of the centralization process, when the area became divided into administrative units called hundreds (herreder in Danish). The hundreds were possibly based on older, already existing units, but the establishment of the new form of hundreds <b>was</b> <b>prompted</b> <b>by</b> an increase in royal power during the High Middle Ages. These differed from the provincial thing areas in that they were not local communities joined under a governing assembly but top-down regional divisions established to ensure royal authority. These medieval Danish hundreds were used to implement military obligations and to expedite the collection of renders due to the king in the provinces. They were first established in Jutland, where they replaced previous administrative units called syssel. According to some scholars, they were introduced in Skåneland possibly as early as the 11th century.|$|E

5|$|In September, October and November 1810, British forces {{arrived from}} Madras, Bombay and the Cape of Good Hope, {{warships}} joining Rowley's squadron off Isle de France and soldiers gathering at Rodriguez. The buildup of forces <b>was</b> <b>prompted</b> <b>by</b> the defeat at Grand Port {{combined with the}} heavy losses of East Indiamen during 1809 and 1810; the British authorities were determined to end {{the threat posed by}} the French squadron on Isle de France before the hurricane season made travel in the region too dangerous. In fact, the threat from Isle de France was already substantially reduced: the damage suffered by the French frigates in the engagements at Grand Port and during September could not be repaired with the available naval supplies on Isle de France. In addition, food supplies were running low due to the large number of British prisoners on the island and morale had collapsed in the aftermath of Hamelin's defeat.|$|E
5|$|Knox's final {{encounter}} with Mary <b>was</b> <b>prompted</b> <b>by</b> an incident at Holyrood. While Mary was absent from Edinburgh on her summer progress in 1563, a crowd forced {{its way into}} her private chapel as Mass was being celebrated. During the altercation, the priest's life was threatened. As a result, two of the ringleaders, burgesses of Edinburgh, were scheduled for trial on 24 October 1563. In order to defend these men, Knox sent out letters calling the nobles to convene. Mary obtained one of these letters and asked her advisors if {{this was not a}} treasonable act. Stewart and Maitland, wanting to keep good relations with both the Kirk and the Queen, asked Knox to admit he was wrong and to settle the matter quietly. Knox refused and he defended himself in front of Mary and the Privy Council. He argued that he had called a legal, not an illegal, assembly as part of his duties as a minister of the Kirk. After he left, the councillors voted not to charge him with treason.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of the line <b>was</b> <b>prompted</b> <b>by</b> the need of mine owners around Guisborough and East Cleveland to transport their iron ore to the River Tees. Guisborough was already served by the Middlesbrough and Guisborough Railway (M), {{a subsidiary of the}} Stockton and Darlington (S), which had built a line (opened in 1854) running along the south of the valley in which Guisborough sits. However, the line was an inconveniently long distance from the lucrative iron ore mines in the north of the valley, along the south flank of the Eston Hills, and provided no connection at all for mines east of Guisborough. The M had been built by a group of industrialists based in Stockton and Darlington who used it to service their own mines, deliberately avoiding the estates of their rivals. It only provided a minimal passenger service to Middlesbrough – one train a day each way – and the line had originally not even been planned to have a passenger station in Guisborough.|$|E
