5|$|At market, sand <b>whiting</b> is medium priced fish, sold {{fresh or}} frozen; whole and in fillet form. In abundance, sand <b>whiting</b> is {{moderately}} priced, with fillets being slightly more expensive. The recovery rate of fillets from whole fish is about 40%.

5|$|The sand <b>whiting</b> (Sillago ciliata), {{also known}} as the summer <b>whiting,</b> yellowfin <b>whiting</b> or blue-nose <b>whiting,</b> is a common species of coastal marine fish of the family Sillaginidae, the smelt-whitings. It is a slender, {{slightly}} compressed fish that is very similar to other species of Sillago, with detailed spine, ray and lateral line scale counts needed to distinguish the species between its nearest relative Sillago analis. The sand <b>whiting</b> is distributed along the east coast of Australia from Cape York south to Tasmania, as well as Lord Howe Island and New Caledonia in the Pacific Ocean.|$|E

In winter months the equipment was removed and stored for the next season. The track in <b>Whitings</b> is reconfigured and the wye is eliminated.

5000|$|The Loudun episode {{attracted}} the attention of composers, writers, historians, psychologists and the sort. The capacity of the events for generating a multiplicity of interpretations and intertwining religious elements with political ones granted the possibility of new plots, new compositions, and new answers. In addition to Penderecki, the theme of Loudun appealed to other Polish artists, including Jaros≈Çaw Iwaszkiewicz, Jerzy Kawalerowicz, and Romuald Twardowski. Even though the libretto for The Devils of Loudun is based on <b>Whiting's</b> play Demons, the two stories are fundamentally different. The libretto shortens, omits, and reorders some of the scenes of <b>Whiting's</b> play. [...] Most significant is the emotional and ideological dissimilarities of Penderecki's and <b>Whiting's</b> protagonist Grandier. Indeed, the <b>Whiting's</b> Grandier and Penderecki's Grandier are two different characters.|$|R
5|$|The sand <b>whiting</b> {{belongs to}} the genus Sillago, a {{division}} of the smelt <b>whiting</b> family Sillaginidae containing 29 individual species. The Sillaginidae are in the suborder Percoidei, {{a division of the}} Perciformes.|$|E
5|$|The sand <b>whiting</b> is {{a highly}} prized table fish often rated equal to the King George <b>whiting,</b> making it a common target for both {{commercial}} and recreational fisheries. The flesh is white, tender and has a moist, low oil content composition, making it easily digestible. Investigations into the aquaculture of the species began in the 1980s, and {{has led to the}} development of farmed sand <b>whiting.</b>|$|E
5|$|First {{described}} in 1829, the species {{has long been}} prized as a table fish and is commonly sought by both recreational and commercial fishermen in New South Wales and Queensland. The sand <b>whiting</b> fishery is most prolific in southern Queensland and northern New South Wales where the species is most abundant, often caught along other species of <b>whiting</b> in estuaries and from beaches. Due to its importance as a commercial fish, substantial research {{has been carried out}} on the species, especially feasibility studies involving the use of sand <b>whiting</b> in aquaculture.|$|E

5|$|The {{aquaculture}} {{potential for}} sand <b>whiting</b> was first investigated {{in the late}} 1980s, {{with a number of}} reports detailing both successful trials and also a number of problems with such trials. A 1988 study showed that sand <b>whiting</b> were more likely to grow in captivity than other <b>whiting</b> species, but the mortality rate of over 50% was unacceptable for use in an economic setting. A number of problems with diseases such as ulcerative dermatitis and the failure of the swim-bladder to inflate properly were also documented, however many of these initial problems have been overcome, and some facilities are breeding around 2000 larvae with a 95% survival rate. Some of these fingerlings are used to restock depleted estuaries, while others form the basis of commercial fish crops.|$|E
5|$|The sand whiting's {{distinctive}} {{body shape}} and mouth placement is an adaptation to bottom feeding, {{which is the}} predominant method of feeding for all <b>whiting</b> species. All larger <b>whiting</b> feed by using their protrusile jaws and tube-like mouths to suck up various types of prey from in, on or above the ocean substrate, as well as using their nose as a 'plough' to dig through the substrate.|$|E

5|$|The sand <b>whiting</b> is an inshore species, inhabiting exposed {{coastal areas}} such as beaches, sandbars and surf zones as well as quieter bays, {{estuaries}} and coastal lakes. Sand <b>whiting</b> enter estuaries, including intermittently open ones, and penetrate far upstream to the tidal limits of rivers and creeks where juveniles and adolescent fish may be abundant. The adults congregate around the mouths of estuaries, bars, and spits, in depths down to 5 m where they may constitute {{a large percentage of}} the icthyofauna of such regions. As implied by their name, they are often found exclusively over sandy substrates, with occasional appearances in Zostera seagrass beds. Individuals are occasionally taken in offshore waters to 40 m during winter.|$|E

Barrichello also added that his helmet was damaged from his collision with de la Rosa. Frentzen reacted {{by suggesting that}} Barrichello braked earlier which forced him {{to make contact with}} teammate Trulli. FIA Race Director Charlie <b>Whiting</b> defended his decision not to stop the race saying that the safety car was deployed as all cars involved were in the run-off areas and that he believed stopping the race would be dangerous. However, he admitted that he was not aware about Gislimberti's condition when making the decision. Jordan team principal Eddie Jordan believed that <b>Whiting</b> had made the right decision and praised the safety of the modern Formula One car for protecting drivers.|$|E

40|$|Sydney <b>Whiting‚Äôs</b> 1853 Memoirs of a Stomach {{provides}} {{a vehicle for}} investigating the body‚Äôs potential to resist human control and influence human activities. Such work is important to fat studies because a fear of such bodily agency underlies current Western fatphobia. Memoirs is modeled on eighteenth-century it-narratives, in which fictional nonhuman narrators recount their circulation through human systems of exchange. By granting the stomach authority over an erring ‚Äúself,‚Äù <b>Whiting‚Äôs</b> embodied manifestation of the it-narrative reverses the usual hierarchy of mind over matter. However, the comic nature of <b>Whiting‚Äôs</b> tale simultaneously undermines the authority it assigns to the stomach.
