5|$|After {{years of}} decline with {{abandoned}} buildings and high elderly populations, {{the demographics of}} Old Louisville began to change noticeably in the 1990s.

The Courier-Journal's Velocity weekly has reported the area as a hip, emerging center of culture in Louisville. This change is reflected in numerous coffeehouses, restaurants and bars opening in Old Louisville in the 1990s and early 2000s targeting at the younger crowd.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the Whig {{interpretation}} of Magna Carta {{and its role}} in constitutional history remained dominant during the 19th century. The historian William Stubbs's Constitutional History of England, published in the 1870s, formed the high-water mark of this view. Stubbs argued that Magna Carta had been a major step in the shaping of the English nation, and he believed that the barons at Runnymede in 1215 <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> representing the nobility, but the people of England as a whole, standing up to a tyrannical ruler in the form of King John.|$|E

30|$|Metaphors <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> language; they <b>are</b> a {{style of}} thinking. The ‘liquid city’ and the ‘solid modern city’ <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> language; it <b>is</b> a way of perceiving the city through the concept of liquid life/liquid modernity of Baumann (2005), as Franklin (2010) does. ‘The Green Heart’ <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> {{planning}} language; it has emotional and rational connotations, it influences behaviour. And the metaphor of ‘the rotten tooth’ makes it clear {{what has to be}} done: pull it. It is collective sense making for an urban redevelopment project. In short, metaphors are concepts that frame thinking and feeling.|$|R

5|$|At {{the same}} time, more recent work has {{suggested}} that the regular army of the 2nd century was considerably larger than the c. 300,000 traditionally assumed. This is because the 2nd-century auxilia <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> equal in numbers to the legions as in the early 1st century, but some 50% larger. The army of the Principate probably reached a peak of nearly 450,000 (excluding fleets and foederati) {{at the end of the}} 2nd century. Furthermore, the evidence is that the actual strength of 2nd-century units was typically much closer to official (c. 85%) than 4th century units.|$|E
5|$|A {{bank and}} ditch {{enclosure}} {{was a simple}} form of defence, and when found without an associated motte is called a ringwork; when the site was in use for a prolonged period, it was sometimes replaced by a more complex structure or enhanced {{by the addition of}} a stone curtain wall. Building the hall in stone did not necessarily make it immune to fire as it still had windows and a wooden door. This led to the elevation of windows to the first floor– to make it harder to throw objects in– and to change the entrance from ground floor to first floor. These features are seen in many surviving castle keeps, which were the more sophisticated version of halls. Castles <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> defensive sites but also enhanced a lord's control over his lands. They allowed the garrison to control the surrounding area, and formed a centre of administration, providing the lord with a place to hold court.|$|E

5|$|Ancestors of Vedar {{migrated}} to Sri Lanka via the Indian sub continent during the pre-historic period. A number of Mesolithic sites have been excavated containing human remains dated to 35,000 BCE. Anthropologists consider these skeletal remains {{to belong to}} a group ancestral to some of the surviving Vedar groups. Sri Lanka has also yielded Megalithic burial sites, one of which was excavated close to a present Vedar settlement, Kathiraveli. The precise time in which some of the Vedar lineage founders {{migrated to}} the east coast of Sri Lanka is unknown. The earliest written reference to Vedar is a Tamil chronicle, Nadukadu paraveni kalvettu, which is maintained amongst the custodians of a prominent Hindu temple in the town of Tirukovil in the Ampara District. It is a Tamil 14th to 16th-century original text. The chronicle documents the presence of a people who practiced hunting and gathering for survival, exercising jurisdiction over vast jungle tracts close to the Akkaraipattu township. It names a number of Vedar chiefs, such as Kadariyan and Puliyan. These Vedars <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> hunter-gatherers, but were also accepted as the rightful owners of the forest lands.|$|E
5|$|The species {{pertaining}} to Deinosuchus since {{the resurrection of}} the generic name in 1979 have been traditionally recognized as D. rugosus from {{the eastern side of the}} Western Interior Seaway and the larger D. riograndensis from the western side, characterized by differences of the shape of their osteoderms and teeth, this view was not always favored by all researchers and in 2002 it was proposed that there was only one species, Deinosuchus rugosus, with the differences found between the two species explained as the result of the larger size of the western morph. This proposal faced support and criticism and was dropped in 2010 when new fossils of specimens from both sides of the interior seaway showed that the differences between the two morphs <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> size related, teeth from large eastern specimens retained the common characteristics of other specimens of the region and osteoderms from small specimens of the western morph were no different from those of large ones, supporting the specific separation of the two morphs, now formalized as D. rugosus and D. riograndensis.|$|E
5|$|When renewed air {{operations}} began over the Bay, the Command found U-boats not only adhering {{to a new}} strategy (of avoidance), they discovered the Germans obeying new tactical instructions. The German crews were ordered to transit the Bay in groups, submerged, and at night, but on the surface in daylight, to concentrate their defensive fire. Later U-boat designs had their firepower upgraded for this purpose. Also, the Luftwaffe provided Junkers Ju 88 night fighters to escort the submarines. The increased firepower and determination of German air and submarine crews to fight it out did not deter British crews. The Third Bay Offensive became the bloodiest in the aircraft-submarine battle yet, which involved heavy losses. Despite efforts to defend themselves, by 17 June, air attacks had forced German submarines {{to make the trip}} submerged during daylight. The effects <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> indirect; patrols also inflicted increasing losses on U-boats. From 1 July to 2 August 1943, 86 submarines passed through the Bay; 55 were sighted and 16 sunk, in exchange for 14 aircraft.|$|E

5|$|The late 17th {{century in}} England {{was a time}} of great {{progress}} in design. Following the austere years of Commonwealth rule, a great flourishing and development in both architecture and the arts began after the restoration of the monarchy in 1660. Royalist exiles and wealthy young men who made the Grand Tour, returned home with new ideas—often extravagant variations on classical themes. This was, for England, the dawn of the Baroque era. The new wave of architects such as Roger Pratt, John Webb, and Sir Christopher Wren <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> building vast edifices in Renaissance-inspired styles, but also transforming existing older houses. Representative of the utilisation of older houses is Coleshill House in Berkshire, where Pratt transformed the medieval, but now redundant, great hall into a classically inspired entrance hall complete with an imperial staircase. Great Halls were considered redundant now that employers wished to live separately from their servants, and no longer ate with them in a Great Hall. All evidence and odours of cooking and staff were banished from the principal parts of the house. Employers began to live in fine airy rooms, above the ground floor, with privacy from their servants, who were now confined, unless required, to specifically delegated areas—often the ground and uppermost attic floors. This was a period of great social change in British history, and the educated prided themselves on enlightenment and elegance. While Belton is not in the Baroque style, it displays all the traits typical of the new tendencies.|$|E
