500|$|The flower spikes {{are not as}} {{prominent}} as in {{some other}} Banksia species, as they arise from two- to three-year-old nodes nested within the foliage. After flowering, old flower parts wither and fall away {{over a period of}} several months, revealing the [...] "cone", a woody axis embedded with many small follicles. The follicles are initially greenish and downy, but gradually fade to dark grey. Each follicle contains one or sometimes two seeds, separated by a thin <b>wooden</b> <b>separator.</b> The seed itself is black, 6 to 10 millimetres (0.2–0.4in) long with a feathery black 'wing' 10 to 20 millimetres (0.4–0.8in) long.|$|E
