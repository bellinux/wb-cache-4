500|$|California Chrome raced {{next in the}} September 20 Pennsylvania Derby at Parx Racing. He was the favorite, but {{drew the}} inside number 1 post position. Kentucky Derby rivals Candy Boy and Tapiture also entered. Bayern, who had a poor {{performance}} in the Preakness Stakes but later won the Haskell Invitational, was the second favorite. [...] Parx provided significant financial incentives to any horse entering who previously won a triple crown race or other selected Grade I races, so California Chrome's connections earned $200,000 simply for having him start. Trapped on the rail, first by a speed horse {{in the initial stages}} of the race, and again on the far turn by a challenger who faded in the stretch, California Chrome was unable to gain momentum and finished sixth. Bayern had a clean trip, leading <b>wire</b> <b>to</b> <b>wire,</b> and won by [...] lengths. Espinoza explained, [...] "I never really had a chance to let him run the way he had been running." ...|$|E
500|$|California Chrome's first graded stakes win was the March 8 Grade II San Felipe Stakes. Espinoza tried a {{different}} riding tactic {{and let the}} horse go to the lead {{right out of the}} gate. [...] California Chrome led most of the way, and after Espinoza gave him one tap on the shoulder with the whip, the horse pulled away from the field {{at the top of the}} homestretch and won by [...] lengths. Alan Sherman said, [...] "My jaw dropped", while Art Sherman joked, [...] "I'm glad I'm training at Los Alamitos, because he looked like a 350 [...] horse coming out of the gate"; a reference to Quarter Horse racing sprint distances. Espinoza remarked, [...] "I wanted to let him enjoy his race," [...] later adding, [...] "I wanted to see if he [...] go <b>wire</b> <b>to</b> <b>wire...</b> that was the day I found out how much he loves to run." [...] The San Felipe was California Chrome's first win in a race open to all three-year-olds, not just California-breds, and earned him 50 points in the Road to the Kentucky Derby system.|$|E
2500|$|The Cavaliers led <b>wire</b> <b>to</b> <b>wire</b> as they {{defeated}} the Warriors 96–91 {{and took a}} 2–1 series lead. [...] The first half was close throughout, with the Cavaliers leading 24–20 after the first quarter. [...] They led 44–37 at halftime. [...] Stephen Curry's struggles in Game 2 carried over to {{the first half of}} this game as he was held to 3 points in the first half. [...] In the third quarter, the Cavaliers seized control, outscoring the Warriors 28–18. [...] They led by as many as 20 in the third quarter before taking a 72–55 lead heading into the fourth quarter. [...] The 55 points scored by the Warriors was their lowest scoring output through three quarters all season. [...] However, the Warriors fought back, making it a 1-point game as they cut the deficit to 81–80 late in the fourth quarter. [...] However, Matthew Dellavedova banked in a circus shot as he tumbled to the floor while being fouled by Curry. [...] He made the free throw to put the Cavaliers up 84–80. [...] After Curry committed a turnover, LeBron James hit a three pointer to give the Cavs an 87–80 lead. [...] Curry hit a handful of three pointers down the stretch, but the Cavs made their free throws and closed out the win.|$|E

2500|$|Conical {{micrometer}} anvils, specifically {{suited to}} {{resting on the}} sides of the thread, are made for various thread angles, with 60° being the most common. Mics with such anvils are usually called [...] "thread mics" [...] or [...] "pitch mics" [...] (because they directly measure the pitch diameter). Users who lack thread mics rely instead on the [...] "3-wire method", which involves placing 3 short pieces of wire (or gauge pins) of known diameter into the valleys of the thread and then measuring from <b>wire</b> <b>to</b> <b>wire</b> with standard (flat) anvils. A conversion factor (produced by a straightforward trigonometric calculation) is then multiplied with the measured value to infer a measurement of the thread's pitch diameter. Tables of these conversion factors were established many decades ago for all standard thread sizes, so today a user need only take the measurement and then perform the table lookup (as opposed to recalculating each time). The 3-wire method is also used when high precision is needed to inspect a specific diameter, commonly the pitch diameter, or on specialty threads such as multi-start or when the thread angle is not 60°. [...] Ball-shaped micrometer anvils can be used in similar fashion (same trigonometric relationship, less cumbersome to use). Digital calipers and micrometers can send each measurement (data point) as it occurs to storage or software through an interface (such as USB or RS-232), in which case the table lookup is done in an automated way, and quality assurance and quality control can be achieved using statistical process control.|$|E

6000|$|... 1350. As an {{illustration}} of {{the condition of the}} polarized particles in a dielectric under induction, I may describe an experiment. Put into a glass vessel some clear rectified oil of turpentine, and introduce two wires passing through glass tubes where they coincide with the surface of the fluid, and terminating either in balls or points. Cut some very clean dry white silk into small particles, and put these also into the liquid: then electrify one of the wires by an ordinary machine and discharge by the other. The silk will immediately gather {{from all parts of the}} liquid, and form a band of particles reaching from <b>wire</b> <b>to</b> <b>wire,</b> and if touched by a glass rod will show considerable tenacity; yet the moment the supply of electricity ceases, the band will fall away and disappear by the dispersion of its parts. The conduction by the silk is in this case very small; and after the best examination I could give to the effects, the impression on my mind is, that the adhesion of the whole is due to the polarity which each filament acquires, exactly as the particles of iron between the poles of a horse-shoe magnet are held together in one mass by a similar disposition of forces. The particles of silk therefore represent to me the condition of the molecules of the dielectric itself, which I assume to be polar, just as that of the silk is. In all cases of conductive discharge the contiguous polarized particles of the body are able to effect a neutralization of their forces with greater or less facility, as the silk does also in a very slight degree. Further we are not able to carry the parallel, except in imagination; but if we could divide each particle of silk into two halves, and let each half travel until it met and united with the next half in an opposite state, it would then exert its carrying power (1347.), and so far represent electrolytic discharge.|$|E
