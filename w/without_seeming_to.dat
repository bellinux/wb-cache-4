25|$|Early in 1946, Rickey signed {{four more}} black players, Campanella, Newcombe, John Wright and Roy Partlow, {{this time with}} much less fanfare. After the {{integration}} of the major leagues in 1947, marked by the appearance of Jackie Robinson with the Brooklyn Dodgers that April, interest in Negro league baseball waned. Black players who were regarded as prospects were signed by major league teams, often without regard for any contracts that might have been signed with Negro league clubs. Negro league owners who complained about this practice were in a no-win situation: they could not protect their own interests <b>without</b> <b>seeming</b> <b>to</b> interfere with the advancement of players to the majors. By 1948, the Dodgers, along with Veeck's Cleveland Indians had integrated.|$|E
25|$|France's prime minister, Cardinal Fleury, saw the Polish {{struggle}} as {{a chance}} to strike at the Austrian monarchy in the west <b>without</b> <b>seeming</b> <b>to</b> be the aggressor. While he cared little for who should become King of Poland, the cause of the King's father-in-law was a sympathetic one. He also hoped to use the war to humble Austria, and perhaps secure the long-desired Duchy of Lorraine from Duke Francis Stephen, who was unofficially betrothed to Emperor Charles's daughter and heir Maria Theresa. Their marriage would bring Austrian power dangerously close to France. Fleury's diplomatic moves brought into the war additional powers with no interest in Polish affairs and politics, most notably Spain and King Charles Emmanuel III of Sardinia, who was also Duke of Savoy.|$|E
500|$|Bryan's opening claimed no {{personal}} prestige for himself—but nevertheless placed {{him as the}} spokesman for silver. According to Bensel, the self-deprecation helped disarm the delegates. As Bryan was not deemed a major contender for the nomination, even delegates committed to a candidate could cheer him <b>without</b> <b>seeming</b> <b>to</b> betray their allegiance. Bryan then recounted {{the history of the}} silver movement; the audience, which had loudly demonstrated its approval of his opening statements, quieted. Throughout the speech, Bryan had the delegates {{in the palm of his}} hand; they cheered on cue. The Nebraskan later described the audience as like a trained choir. As he concluded his historical recitation, he reminded the silver delegates that they had come to crown their victory, [...] "not to discuss, not to debate, but to enter up the judgment already rendered by the plain people of this country".|$|E

500|$|Cukor {{himself was}} highly {{dissatisfied}} by the film. [...] "I suspect {{the story was}} basically fraudulent," [...] he told an interviewer. Like many critics, he felt that [...] "as a piece of storytelling, the unfolding of a mystery, {{the first half of}} Keeper of the Flame is a damn good show", {{but the rest of the}} film had substantial problems. He praised Spencer Tracy's work, saying: [...] "Tracy... was at his best in the picture. Subdued, cool, he conveyed the ruthlessness of the reporter sent to investigate Forrest's death <b>without</b> <b>seeming</b> <b>to</b> try. He was ideally cast in the role, grimly and skeptically exploring the secret of the dead boys' club hero who was in fact a rampant fascist." [...] Hepburn, he felt, was hindered by the role and her approach to it. [...] "It was Kate's last romantic glamour-girl part, and she acted with some of that artificiality she'd supposedly left behind at RKO. That first scene, floating into a room in yards and yards of draperies with these lillies—well, it was all far, far too much. I don't think I really believed in the story, it was pure hokeypokey, and her part was phony, highfalutin." [...] He particularly disliked Hepburn's entrance in the film, with the long dress and lillies. But he felt Hepburn did her best: [...] "That's awfully tricky isn't it? And doesn't she give long, piercing looks at his portrait over the mantel? Well. I think she finally carried a slightly phony part because her humanity asserted itself, and her humor. They always did." [...] Overall, though, Cukor felt the film was leaden, and that it had [...] "a wax work quality". Even screenwriter Stewart eventually came to feel the film was [...] "tedious, wooden, and heavy-handed".|$|E
2500|$|In later years, Spurrier {{has stated}} that his seasons working to get maximum {{production}} out of outmanned Duke squads were critical to his development as a coach and an offensive strategist. Success at a school not known for its football program also built Spurrier's reputation as an innovative young offensive coach who could improvise and succeed <b>without</b> <b>seeming</b> <b>to</b> work very hard. Duke quarterback Ben Bennett recalls Spurrier diagraming a trick halfback option play with his cereal on the morning before a game, and the play going for a 60-yard touchdown pass that afternoon. During another game, Spurrier devised a new pass play on the sideline that worked for another score. Coach Wilson {{had not seen the}} play before and asked what it was, and Spurrier replied simply [...] "Touchdown, coach." ...|$|E
2500|$|Today Gotse Delchev is {{considered}} as a national hero in Bulgaria, {{as well as in}} the Republic of Macedonia, where it is claimed that he was among the founders of the Macedonian national movement. Despite such Macedonian historical interpretations, Delchev had Bulgarian national identityIn spite of these political differences, both groups, including those who advocated an independent Macedonian state and opposed the idea of a greater Bulgaria, never seem to have doubted [...] "the predominantly Bulgarian character of the population of Macedonia"Even Gotse Delchev, the famous Macedonian revolutionary leader, whose nom de guerre was Ahil (Achilles), refers to [...] "the Slavs of Macedonia as 'Bulgarians' in an offhanded manner <b>without</b> <b>seeming</b> <b>to</b> indicate that such a designation was a point of contention" [...] (Perry 1988:23). In his correspondence Gotse Delchev often states clearly and simply, [...] "We are Bulgarians" [...] (Mac Dermott 1978:273).}} and viewed his compatriots as Bulgarians. The designation Macedonian according to the then used ethnic terminology included Albanians, Bulgarians, Greeks, Turks, Vlachs, and Serbs, and when applied to the local Slavs, it meant a regional Bulgarian identity. However, contrary to Bulgarian assertions, his autonomist ideas of a separate Macedonian (and Adrianopolitan) political entity, have stimulated the development of contemporary Macedonian nationalism.|$|E

2500|$|The Salt Lake Tribune {{said that}} the album [...] "largely drops the punk-by-numbers that {{dominated}} past efforts {{to get a little}} more personal lyrically, thus becoming more approachable." [...] Alan Sculley of The Daily Herald explained that, [...] "Coming Home pretty much leaves any punk element behind. The songs still rock - just note the wallop delivered by [...] "Hold My Hand" [...] or [...] "Connected." [...] But the band pulls back on the tempos of virtually all of the songs." [...] Scene Point Blank writer Chris Abraham noted, [...] "Coming Home still encompasses the things that make New Found Glory great. Relatable lyrics, hooks so melodic and catchy that my hands are red from not buying a mitt, and, despite a mellower tone, I could still imagine myself going fucking nuts singing along to these songs live." [...] AbsolutePunk founder Jason Tate warned that, [...] "it's crucial you abandon any pre-conceived expectations for this album. If you're anticipating the band's previous albums re-hashed, you're going to be completely let-down. While the choruses and sing-a-long hooks could compete with the best on any of their previous albums - it's the slower melodic approach to the songs that truly makes the album come alive and fully breathe." [...] Rae Alexandra of Kerrang! magazine called the album a [...] "massive departure" [...] and suggested that, [...] "NFG are taking what will be, by far, the biggest gamble of their career. Some of you won't even recognise them immediately; it's not fast, it's not forced, but - in an entirely new way - it soars." [...] In an earlier Kerrang! article discussing the album, Alexandra wrote that [...] "It's Not Your Fault" [...] displays [...] "more maturity - and piano - than ever before", while [...] "When I Die" [...] is [...] "low key with orchestral accents", making it [...] "one of the most beautiful moments on Coming Home." [...] Corey Apar of AllMusic was in agreement and stated that [...] "from the album's packaging to the comfortable nature of the music, it actually feels more mature {{in a way that is}} catchy <b>without</b> <b>seeming</b> <b>to</b> care about radio accessibility." ...|$|E
