40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with mining the log file of a <b>Web</b> <b>site</b> for knowledge about the <b>Web</b> <b>site</b> and its users, and using the knowledge to assist users to navigate and search the <b>Web</b> <b>site</b> effectively and efficiently. First, we investigate approaches to adapting the organization and presentation of a <b>Web</b> <b>site</b> by learning from the <b>Web</b> <b>site</b> link structure and user behavior of the <b>Web</b> <b>site.</b> Approaches are developed for presenting a <b>Web</b> <b>site</b> using a link hierarchy and a conceptual link hierarchy respectively based on how users have used the <b>Web</b> <b>site</b> link structure. Link hierarchies and conceptual link hierarchies {{can be used to}} help users navigate the <b>Web</b> <b>site.</b> Second, we develop approaches for building a first-order Markov chain model of user navigation on the <b>Web</b> <b>site</b> link structure, link hierarchy, and conceptual link hierarchy respectively. Under a collaborative assumption, the model can be used for link prediction that assists users to navigate the <b>Web</b> <b>site.</b> Third, approaches are developed for ranking Web pages based on how users have used the <b>Web</b> <b>site</b> link structure. The page rankings can be used to help users search the <b>Web</b> <b>site.</b> The approaches developed in the thesis have been implemented in a prototype called Online Navigation Explorer (ONE). First, link hierarchies and conceptual link hierarchies are visualized in ONE. Second, link prediction using Markov chain models is integrated with link hierarchies and conceptual link hierarchies in ONE. Third, search results are visualized in ONE. Experimental results show that ONE can help users navigate a <b>Web</b> <b>site</b> and search for their desired information on the <b>Web</b> <b>site</b> effectively and efficiently. The work presented in the thesis is a step towards the development of an adaptive <b>Web</b> <b>site,</b> which can assist users to navigate the <b>Web</b> <b>site</b> and search for their desired information on the <b>Web</b> <b>site.</b> TABLE OF CONTENTS STATEMENT vi ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS vi...|$|R

How does trust affect consumer behavioral intent on a <b>Web</b> <b>site?</b> To address these questions, we develop a conceptual model that links consumer perceptions of <b>Web</b> <b>site</b> characteristics, consumer characteristics and demographics to perceptions of trust in a <b>Web</b> <b>site,</b> and trust to behavioral intent related to a <b>Web</b> <b>site.</b> We also examine whether trust mediates the relationship between Web sit...|$|R

40|$|This {{empirical}} paper {{explores the}} antecedents {{and consequences of}} trust in the online retail context and examines the moderating role of consumers' familiarity with a <b>Web</b> <b>site</b> {{in the relationship between}} <b>Web</b> <b>site</b> quality and trust. Data were collected with an online questionnaire. The research highlights the importance of the <b>Web</b> <b>site</b> interface in consumer online behavior by systematically examining how different quality features affect consumer trust. A multidimensional view of <b>Web</b> <b>site</b> quality with the following dimensions is developed: <b>Web</b> <b>site</b> usability, security and privacy assurance, and product information quality. Trust is shown to lead to positive consequences, such as the formation of positive attitudes and behavioral intentions toward the <b>Web</b> <b>site.</b> The study also identifies the moderating role of <b>Web</b> <b>site</b> familiarity in the relationships between aspects of <b>Web</b> <b>site</b> quality and trust.

40|$|<b>Web</b> <b>site</b> {{interactivity}} creates numerous {{opportunities for}} marketers to persuade online consumers and receives extensive {{attention in the}} marketing literature. However, research on cognitive and behavioral responses to <b>web</b> <b>site</b> interactivity is scarce, and more importantly, it does not provide empirical evidence for how interactivity effects can be explained. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} study was to investigate the underlying principle that explains the influence of <b>web</b> <b>site</b> interactivity on consumers' cognitive, affective and behavioral responses: online flow, the <b>web</b> <b>site</b> users' complete immersion in an online activity (Hoffman and Novak 2009). In two studies, the hypothesis was tested that a visitor's flow experience in a specific brand <b>web</b> <b>site</b> mediates the effects of interactivity on the number and type (<b>web</b> <b>site</b> vs. product related) of thoughts, on attitudes toward the brand and <b>web</b> <b>site,</b> and on several behavioral intentions. The results provide evidence for the importance of flow in a marketing context, and the notion that the flow experienced on a specific <b>web</b> <b>site</b> is the underlying mechanism by which cognitive, attitudinal, and behavioral responses to an interactive brand <b>web</b> <b>site</b> can be explained...|$|R
