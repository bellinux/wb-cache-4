500|$|On May 10, 1983, Howard Emerson, the {{adviser to}} the journalism class, {{submitted}} page proofs of the May 13 issue of the newspaper to principal Robert Eugene Reynolds for approval, a practice that was customary at the time. Reynolds objected {{to two of the}} stories scheduled to run. One was about teen pregnancy, containing interviews with three students who had been pregnant. The story used false names to keep the girls' identities a secret, but Reynolds was concerned that the students would still be identifiable from the text. He was also concerned that the references to sexual activity and birth control were inappropriate for younger students at the school. The second story was about divorce and featured an interview with a student whose parents were divorced, in which she complained that her father [...] "wasn't spending enough time <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>mom,</b> my sister, and I ... was always out of town on business or out late playing cards with the guys ... always argued about everything". Reynolds, unaware that the girl's name would also be changed, argued that her family should have been given an opportunity to respond within the story, or to object to its publication.|$|E
500|$|Kesha {{had been}} working on Animal for seven years prior to its release, and had written over 200 songs for the album.

[...] "For girls, I think it's an empowering record, it's funny, it's cheeky," [...] she said. [...] "I think people need to have fun with whatever they're doing—makeup, their clothes, music, live shows—anything you don't need to take too seriously, don't take too seriously." [...] When asked how the album related to her life, Kesha explained that the album was completely autobiographical. [...] "I just write about what I live—literally, [...] I think there's a great pop song in anything and everything, any situation." [...] She cites her songs [...] "Stephen" [...] and [...] "Dinosaur" [...] as examples of this. She explained: [...] "it's about this guy I've been stalking since I was 15.

5000|$|Evidence {{also spoke}} {{about why they}} chose Directors of Photography as the album title, saying: [...] "I always said that Directors of Photography would be a dope title so I could tie some {{personal}} stuff that I wanted to <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>mom's</b> situation or photography or whatever. I think that's the dynamic of this album, learning from our personal experiences and bringing it to Dilated. We used to rap about rapping. We would rap about how we were tight, or we would have an anthem, or we'd make a concept and rap around the concept, but this time, I think, we're letting who we are show a little bit. We've done so much growth as solo artists. To not bring it up at all here and pretend we haven't had this off time or we haven't had this growth period, {{it would be a}} disservice." ...|$|R
