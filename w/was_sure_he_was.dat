25|$|Gray's {{defenders}} {{would later}} argue that Gray simply practiced a management style {{that was different}} from that of Hoover. Gray's program of field office visits was something that Hoover had not done since his early years as director, and some felt Gray's visits did much to raise the morale of the agents working in those field offices. Furthermore, Gray's leadership style seemed to mirror what he had learned in the US Navy, in which the executive officer concentrates on the basic operation of the ship, while the captain concentrates on its position and heading. Felt believed Gray's methods were an unnecessary distraction and showed a lack of leadership. He <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> not {{the only one of the}} FBI leaders who disapproved of Gray's methods, particularly among those who had served under Hoover.|$|E
500|$|That same year, he {{fell out}} of a tree and broke his right hand. The injury forced him to play left-handed until his hand healed, making him {{effectively}} ambidextrous. In retrospect, he described this accident as [...] "a fortunate event" [...] and cited it {{as a factor in}} making him more versatile on the court. During a Press League game, the high school basketball coach saw him play. He was impressed by the budding star's two-handed ability and invited Cousy to come to practice the following day to try out for the junior varsity team. He did well enough to become a permanent member of the JV squad. He continued to practice day and night, and by his junior year <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> going to be promoted to the varsity; but failing his citizenship course made him ineligible for the first semester. He joined the varsity squad midway through the season, however, scoring 28 points in his first game. He had no intention of attending college, but after he started {{to make a name for}} himself on the basketball court he started to focus on improving in both academics and basketball skills to make it easier for him to get into college.|$|E
60|$|Now that he <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{not to be}} shot, Job Haskers {{was very}} indignant over being bound.|$|E
6000|$|... 'It's a {{thousand}} pities {{he should have}} ever been removed from Devonport, where I <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> both useful and ornamental.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay, but," [...] {{continued}} the sweetly communicative Maria, with some real and some assumed simplicity, [...] "your ladyship forgets--for you said presently after, you <b>were</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> no gentleman, for {{he did not}} run after you with your glove which you had dropped--and so I went back myself to find your ladyship's glove, and he never offered to help me, and I saw him closer than your ladyship did, and I <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> handsome, though <b>he</b> <b>is</b> not very civil." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> a very deserving, well-principled young man," [...] said Rosamond, with a neat air of {{patronage}} {{in return for}} Mrs. Plymdale's wholesome corrections.|$|R
6000|$|He was {{not very}} well {{received}} by Artaphernes, who <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{at the bottom of}} the revolt. “Aristagoras put on the shoe,” he said, “but it was of your stitching.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Mercy, how you rush {{about in}} this temperature!' his mother exclaimed, while I {{reflected}} that it was perhaps his billiard-balls I had heard ten minutes before. I <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> fond of billiards.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Brand {{looked at}} Felix {{for a moment}} sidewise, mistrustfully; then his eyes slowly wandered over the ceiling. Felix <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{secretly}} struck with the romance of the situation. [...] "I think this is none of our business," [...] the young minister murmured.|$|E
6000|$|... "Father, I verily {{think you}} are afraid of that beggar! I <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> as mysterious as the Queen of the Dew-drops!" [...] cried the mischievous girl.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Something is {{come over}} Felix,' said Lance. 'I never knew him give such a jaw {{as he has}} to me. To <b>be</b> <b>sure,</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> set on to it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He is gay enough, but I <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> no deceiver. A man {{may make}} himself nice to young ladies without deceiving any of them; may he not?" ...|$|R
60|$|When he {{neared the}} hotel, he took leave of his companion, {{saying that he}} would call in the afternoon; and Willy, after she had looked back and <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> out of sight, slipped into {{the grocery store and}} got her borax and blacking.|$|E
60|$|Toward {{the end she}} <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> dead. I do {{not know}} when she first {{made up her mind}} to this, nor whether it was not merely a phrase for those who wanted to discuss him with her. I know that she still sat at the window looking at the elbow of the brae.|$|E
60|$|Yes, yes, he was; he <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>was.</b> But {{where had}} he been so long, and why had he left his mother by herself, or worse than by herself, with her poor foolish boy? And had she really been as happy as they said? And where was she? Was she near there? She was not happy now, and he in jail? Ah, no.|$|E
60|$|Ant. Nay, I {{know not}} that: but I <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> {{old enough to}} be your father; and either father, or reverend father, I heard you call him.|$|R
60|$|P. 587. Burnet, {{speaking}} of Baillie's execution, says:--The only excuse that was ever pretended for this infamous prosecution <b>was,</b> that they <b>were</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> guilty.--Swift. Bishop of Rochester.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I don't know," [...] {{said the}} other, [...] "but I <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> eight feet high; didn't you see his {{back as he}} ran into the house." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "One of the {{greatest}} races was between one o' the cowboys and an Indian named Crowfoot Joe," [...] said the cowboy. [...] "The Indian <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> going to win, but he lost by a neck. That race took place two years ago, but the boys in these parts ain't done tellin' about it yet. We had a full holiday the time it come off." ...|$|E
6000|$|The more intently {{the ghosts}} gazed, the less [...] Could they {{distinguish}} whose the features were; [...] The Devil himself seemed puzzled even to guess; [...] They varied like a dream--now here, now there; [...] And several people swore from out the press, [...] They knew him perfectly; and one could swear [...] He was his father; upon which another [...] <b>Was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> his mother's cousin's brother: ...|$|E
6000|$|When Mr. Kendal {{returned}} home he looked much discomposed, though his first words were, 'Thank Heaven, {{it is no}} fever! Albinia, we must look after that poor lad; he is positively poisoned by that pestiferous river and bad living! Bowles said he <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> not eating meat enough. I dare say that greasy woman gives him nothing fit to eat! Albinia, you must talk to him--find out whether old Goldsmith gives him a decent salary!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{stranger}}," [...] I replied; [...] "a {{stranger to}} this place, I <b>am</b> <b>sure.</b> <b>He</b> <b>is</b> tall and dark; <b>he</b> <b>is</b> a little lantern-jawed--a hatchet-shaped face, I should call it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Of course--of course,' said Mr. Edmonstone; 'it {{would be}} the correct thing. I <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> always very civil to us, and you are next heir after this boy.' ...|$|R
60|$|Ballantrae's Hindu, still smiling, {{pulled out}} a pistol from his bosom, and though Ballantrae himself never moved a muscle I knew him well enough to <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> prepared.|$|R
6000|$|AUGUSTA (who {{has been}} speaking). And {{when we took}} him upstairs, I <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> going to die--it seemed {{to me as if}} nothing could save him. He's been sitting up and talking to us--of course he's pale and weak and wasted, but in spite of that, Asher, he seems to have a strength, a force that he didn't have before he went away. He isn't a boy any more. I can't {{describe}} it, but I'm almost afraid of him--! ...|$|E
6000|$|About noon, I was {{standing}} on the upper deck, when I saw Rectus coming toward me, looking very pale. He was generally a dark sort of a boy, and it made a good deal of difference in him to look pale. I <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> going to be sick, at last,--although it was rather queer for him to knock under when the voyage was pretty nearly over,--and I began to laugh, when he said to me, in a nervous sort of way: ...|$|E
60|$|He {{moved about}} the room a very dispirited, moody fool with no quip for anyone, for his {{thoughts}} were all on Gonzaga and the treason that he <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> hatching. Yet faithful to Francesco, who sat all unconcerned, and not wishing to alarm Valentina, he choked back the warning that rose to his lips, seeking to convince himself that his fears sprang perhaps from an excess of suspicion. Had he known how well-founded indeed they were he might have practised less self-restraint.|$|E
2500|$|... "The {{poor old}} Duke ! What shall I say of him? To <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> born in Ireland, but being {{born in a}} stable {{does not make a}} man a horse." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I hope not, Matteo; but I <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> {{not the man}} to give up {{the plan}} he has once formed easily, any more than <b>he</b> <b>is</b> to forgive an injury.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{should not}} think he needed that,' {{returned}} Aunt Ursel, 'though I should be very glad, I <b>am</b> <b>sure.</b> <b>He</b> <b>is</b> an excellent young man, and it is quite the obvious thing.' ...|$|R
60|$|Forgive her! Oh, how it enraged Grizel! How {{like the}} Tommy of old {{to put it}} in that way. There never had been a boy so good at {{forgiving}} people for his own crimes, and he always looked so modest when he did it. He was reclining on his chairs at this moment, she <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>was,</b> forgiving her in every sentence. She could have endured it more easily had she felt sure that he was seeing himself as he was; but she remembered him too well to have any hope of that.|$|E
60|$|On {{they came}} till, from their lofty perch, Miriam, who was keen-sighted, {{could see their}} {{separate}} armour and tell the colour of their horses. Eagerly she searched them with her eyes, for well she guessed that Marcus {{would be one of}} those who accompanied his general upon this service. That plumed warrior might be he, or that with the purple cloak, or that who galloped out from near by the Standard on an errand. He was there; she <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> there, and yet they were as far apart as when the great sea rolled between them.|$|E
6000|$|... "Faith, Mr. Crocker, I don't care if I {{am telling}} you. I {{always had a}} liking for you, sir, and bechune you and me it was that divil O'Meara what made all the trouble. I wasn't taking his money, not me; the saints forbid! But glory be to God, if he didn't raise a rumpus whin I come back without Allen! It <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> that the gent left that place,--what are ye calling it?--Mohair, in the Maria, and we {{telegraphs}} over to Asquith. He swore I'd lose me job if I didn't fetch him to-day. Mr. Crocker, sir, it's the lumber business I'll be startin' next week," [...] said McCann.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] said Ethel; [...] "there's a line--here--round his eyes, {{that there}} {{never used to}} be, and when it deepens, I <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> in pain, or has been kept awake." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come along, then. I <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> the man <b>is</b> {{still in}} the house. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> hiding in the {{cupboard}} by the dining-room. I know it. I <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> {{still in the}} house." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> right!" [...] said Ethel earnestly. [...] "Then {{you don't}} think the dream meant being beaten, only that our best {{things are not}} gained by successes in this world?" ...|$|R
