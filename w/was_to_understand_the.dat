5|$|The {{original}} {{motivation for}} research {{investigations of the}} rhodocene system <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> nature of and bonding within the metallocene class of compounds. In more recent times, interest has been rekindled {{by the desire to}} explore and apply the metal–metal interactions that occur when metallocene systems are linked. Potential applications for such systems include molecular electronics, semi-conducting (and possibly ferromagnetic) metallocene polymers (an example of a molecular wire), and exploring the threshold between heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysis. Examples of known bimetallocenes and termetallocenes that possess the rhodocenyl moiety include the hexafluorophosphate salts of rhodocenylferrocene, 1,1'-dirhodocenylferrocene, and 1-cobaltocenyl-1'-rhodocenylferrocene, each shown at right. Linked metallocenes can also be formed by introducing several metallocenyl substituents onto a single cyclopentadienyl ligand.|$|E
25|$|Boas also {{introduced}} {{the ideology of}} cultural relativism, which holds that cultures cannot be objectively ranked as higher or lower, or better or more correct, but that all humans see {{the world through the}} lens of their own culture, and judge it according to their own culturally acquired norms. For Boas the object of anthropology <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> way in which culture conditioned people to understand and interact with the world in different ways, and to do this it was necessary to gain an understanding of the language and cultural practices of the people studied. By uniting the disciplines of archaeology, the study of material culture and history, and physical anthropology, the study of variation in human anatomy, with ethnology, the study of cultural variation of customs, and descriptive linguistics, the study of unwritten indigenous languages, Boas created the four field subdivision of anthropology which became prominent in American anthropology in the 20th century.|$|E
500|$|According to the Pentagon Papers, [...] "the {{critical}} failure of both reports <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> fundamental political {{role that the}} army was coming to play in Vietnam". The papers concluded the ARVN was the only institution capable of deposing and replacing Diệm. Diệm and Nhu fully realized the potential threat, responding with the divide and conquer paradigm. They usurped the prerogative of senior officer promotion and appointed generals based on loyalty to the palace, giving orders directly to officers. This action caused deep distrust among the senior officers and fragmented their power. Krulak failed to realize that if the situation deteriorated {{to the point where}} discontent with Diệm posed the possibility of a communist victory, the generals would intervene in politics because of what would happen to them under communist rule. Neither Krulak nor Mendenhall seemed to anticipate that if a military junta came to power, the divisive effect of Diệm's promotion politics would manifest itself as the generals vied for power. Neither of the pair put any emphasis on the detrimental effects that would have been caused by political infighting among the generals.|$|E

2500|$|Bass–Serre {{theory was}} {{developed}} by Jean-Pierre Serre in the 1970s and formalized in Trees, Serre's 1977 monograph (developed in collaboration with Hyman Bass) on the subject.. Rédigé avec la collaboration de Hyman Bass. Astérisque, No. 46. Société Mathématique de France, Paris, 1977 Serre's original motivation <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> structure of certain algebraic groups whose Bruhat–Tits buildings are trees. However, the theory quickly became a standard tool of geometric group theory and geometric topology, particularly the study of 3-manifolds. Subsequent work of Hyman Bass contributed substantially to the formalization and development of basic tools of the theory and currently the term [...] "Bass–Serre theory" [...] is widely {{used to describe the}} subject.|$|E
2500|$|If we {{evaluate}} the molecular revolution {{within the context}} of biological history, it is easy to note that it is the culmination of a long process which began with the first observations through a microscope. The aim of these early researchers <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> functioning of living organisms by describing their organization at the microscopic level. From the end of the 18th century, the characterization of the chemical molecules which make up living beings gained increasingly greater attention, along with the birth of physiological chemistry in the 19th century, developed by the German chemist Justus von Liebig and following the birth of biochemistry {{at the beginning of the}} 20th, thanks to another German chemist Eduard Buchner. Between the molecules studied by chemists and the tiny structures visible under the optical microscope, such as the cellular nucleus or the chromosomes, there was an obscure zone, [...] "the world of the ignored dimensions," [...] as it was called by the chemical-physicist Wolfgang Ostwald. This world is populated by colloids, chemical compounds whose structure and properties were not well defined.|$|E

2500|$|Kitana was {{featured}} in a two-part episode in the 2011 prequel live-action webisode series [...] Her origin is told in part-live and part-animated episode [...] "Kitana & Mileena", which is an altered adaptation of their backstory from the original game series' canon. In a notable difference, her mother Sindel uses a ritual so her soul fuses with Kitana's in hopes to avoid Shao Kahn's corruption before committing suicide. Kitana appears both masked (only in the animated scenes) and unmasked, and bests Mileena in a fierce sparring match. When the young sisters are sent by Shao Kahn to assassinate {{the man who is}} really King Jerrod, Kitana's biological father who is killed by Mileena, Kitana eventually learns the truth after her past and decides to turn against Shao Kahn in the upcoming Mortal Kombat tournament. In the second season, Kitana rescues Johnny Cage and then fights and decapitates Mileena. Kitana was played by martial artist and stuntwoman Samantha Jo (credited as Sam Tjhia) in her acting debut. Jo, a self-professed Kitana fan since her childhood, did research [...] "to get on the same page" [...] with fans to see how they perceive Kitana while preparing for the role. She also said: [...] "The biggest hurdle for me <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> sibling rivalry and betrayal that Kitana faced in her past, and how it deeply affected the character she is now." [...] Kitana return for the second season of Legacy in 2013, still played by Jo, and her new outfit was revealed by director Kevin Tancharoen in December 2012. Jo featured in a clip titled [...] "Kitana's Lost Fan" [...] as promotion for the second season.|$|E
