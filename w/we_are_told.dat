5|$|The Torah {{provides}} four details {{regarding the}} traditions surrounding Joseph’s remains. The account in Genesis relates that, before his death, {{he had his}} brothers swear they would carry his bones out of Egypt to Canaan. He is then {{said to have been}} embalmed then placed in a coffin in Egypt. In Exodus, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>told</b> that Moses fulfilled the pledge by taking Joseph's bones with him when he left Egypt. In Joshua, Joseph’s bones are said to have been brought from Egypt by the Children of Israel and interred in Shechem.The bones of Joseph, which the Children of Israel brought up out of Egypt, were buried in Shechem in a parcel of land Jacob bought from the sons of Hamor, father of Shechem, for a hundred pieces of silver (qeśîṭâ)..|$|E
25|$|After the {{description}} of the four parties of Interzone, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>told</b> more stories about AJ. After briefly describing Interzone, the novel breaks into sub-stories and heavily cut-up influenced passages.|$|E
25|$|The Shannon reputedly hosts a river monster named Cata, first {{appearing}} in the medieval Book of Lismore. In this manuscript <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>told</b> that Senán, patron saint of County Clare, defeated the monster at Inis Cathaigh. Cata {{is described as a}} large monster with a horse's mane, gleaming eyes, thick feet, nails of iron and a whale's tail.|$|E
60|$|Presently a {{knock at}} the door {{interrupted}} us, and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>told</b> that the hairdresser was below.|$|R
50|$|Stills - What Falklanders <b>were</b> called when <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>told</b> to {{stop calling}} them Bennys. (Because {{they were still}} Bennys).|$|R
50|$|<b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>told</b> {{once that}} the land in which <b>we</b> lived <b>was</b> white man's land. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>told</b> <b>we</b> could buy from the white man, a white man could take {{transfer}} for us. The tribe determined to buy land and all contributed to buy chief's, i.e., Mokgatle Mokgatle's kraal. Then it was allowed that any petty chief should buy themselves ground. The chief Mokgatle said those {{who were able to}} do so could. My father was there and he told me.|$|R
25|$|Men's {{clothing}} {{is seen as}} formal and stiff, women's as elaborate and over-done. Clothing covered the entire body, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>told,</b> and even the glimpse of an ankle was scandalous. Critics contend that corsets constricted women's bodies and women's lives. Homes are described as gloomy, dark, cluttered with massive and over-ornate furniture and proliferating bric-a-brac. Myth has it that even piano legs were scandalous, and covered with tiny pantalettes.|$|E
25|$|It was {{probably}} this work which contained {{a story about}} souls, where <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>told</b> that there were once spirits {{who lived in a}} state of bliss, but having committed a crime (the nature of which is unknown) they were punished by being forced to become mortal beings, reincarnated from body to body. Humans, animals, and even plants are such spirits. The moral conduct recommended in the poem may allow us to become like gods again.|$|E
25|$|Say <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>told</b> that a {{woman has}} two children. If we ask whether either {{of them is a}} girl, and are told yes, what is the {{probability}} that the other child is also a girl? Considering this new child independently, one might expect the probability that the other child is female is ½ (50%). But by building a probability space (illustrating all possible outcomes), we see that the probability is actually only ⅓ (33%). This is because the possibility space illustrates 4 ways of having these two children: boy-boy, girl-boy, boy-girl, and girl-girl. But we were given more information. Once <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>told</b> that one of the children is a female, we use this new information to eliminate the boy-boy scenario. Thus the probability space reveals that there are still 3 ways to have two children where one is a female: boy-girl, girl-boy, girl-girl. Only ⅓ of these scenarios would have the other child also be a girl. Using a probability space, we are less likely to miss one of the possible scenarios, or to neglect the importance of new information. For further information, see Boy or girl paradox.|$|E

25|$|In verses {{five and}} six, Mazaraki gives his verdict on the property. He notes {{the absence of}} bird song, which he regards as a very bad sign. In verse six the doctor declares: “If no birds are heard/death reigns here./My advice is that we depart this place quickly/so off I go”. The doctor mounts up {{and returns to the}} city in verse seven, {{accompanied}} by Stampfer, Gutmann, and Barnett. Only Salomon “with his prophetic eyes” remains behind to spend the night on that hill, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>told</b> in verse eight.|$|E
25|$|When a freedman of Nero {{was giving}} a gladiatorial show at Antium, the public porticoes were covered with paintings, so <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>told,</b> {{containing}} life-like portraits of all the gladiators and assistants. This portraiture of gladiators has been the highest interest in art for many centuries now, but it was Gaius Terentius who began the practice of having pictures made of gladiatorial shows and exhibited in public; in honour of his grandfather who had adopted him he provided thirty pairs of Gladiators in the Forum for three consecutive days, and exhibited {{a picture of the}} matches in the Grove of Diana.|$|E
25|$|He was, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>told,</b> {{a passionate}} collector—not only {{of books and}} manuscripts but works of art of every kind; more {{remarkable}} still {{for a man of}} his class, he seems to have been an excellent painter. He was the most generous of patrons—to writers and scholars, artists and craftsmen. Finally, he was an excellent Emperor: a competent, conscientious and hard-working administrator and an inspired picker of men, whose appointments to military, naval, ecclesiastical, civil and academic posts were both imaginative and successful. He did much to develop higher education and took a special interest in the administration of justice.|$|E

25|$|The writer, {{it will be}} seen, makes free use of the New Testament. He {{seems to}} have used all the four Gospels, but that of which he makes most use is St. John's. He quotes from Paul's epistles to the Romans, Corinthians (both letters), Galatians, and Ephesians. There is a copious use also of the Old Testament; and besides <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>told</b> there is a use of the Gospel {{according}} to the Egyptians, and that of Thomas. But what most characterizes the document under consideration is the abundant use of pagan writings. For the author's method of exegesis enables him to find his system in Homer with as much ease as in the Bible.|$|E
25|$|An {{analytic}} proposition is true {{by nature}} {{of the meaning of}} the words in the sentence — we require no further knowledge than a grasp of the language to understand this proposition. On the other hand, a synthetic statement is one that tells us something about the world. The truth or falsehood of synthetic statements derives from something outside their linguistic content. In this instance, weight is not a necessary predicate of the body; until <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>told</b> the heaviness of the body we do not know that it has weight. In this case, experience of the body is required before its heaviness becomes clear. Before Kant's first Critique, empiricists (cf. Hume) and rationalists (cf. Leibniz) assumed that all synthetic statements required experience to be known.|$|E
25|$|The {{picture on}} the right was {{published}} in Zurich in 1563, in Conrad Gesner's Thierbuch (a compendium of animals) with the captions: 'Englischen Blüthund' and 'Canis Sagax Sanguinarius apud Anglos' (English scent hound with associations of blood). It was drawn by, or under the supervision of, John Caius, and sent to Gesner with other drawings to illustrate his descriptions of British dogs for European readers. It is thus the earliest known picture published specifically to demonstrate {{the appearance of the}} Bloodhound. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>told</b> it was done from life, and detail such as the soft hang of the ear indicates it was carefully observed. Fully accurate or not, it suggests changes between the Bloodhound of then and today. The collar and long coiled rope reflect the Bloodhound’s typical functions as a limer or leashed man-trailer in that period.|$|E

5000|$|The sisters first {{performed}} as The Osborn Sisters. In 1989, they were signed to RCA Records and recorded an album {{that was never}} released. Kristyn stated that the record's scrapping was a blessing in disguise: [...] I learned how <b>we</b> had <b>been</b> taken advantage of. We recorded a project for RCA that never got released. That album was missing something and it taught me a lesson. We did what <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>told.</b> <b>We</b> didn't stand up for ourselves because <b>we</b> <b>were</b> so young. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>told</b> to do a song and we did it. There were only three of our songs on there.|$|R

25|$|Also {{referred}} to as Natasha. Natasha is a seventeen-year-old daughter of Dar’ya Mikhailovna. She is observant, well-read and intelligent, but also quite secretive. While her mother thinks {{of her as a}} good-natured and well-mannered girl, she is not of a high opinion about her intelligence, and quite wrongly. She also thinks Natasha is ‘cold’, emotionless, but in the beginning of Chapter Five <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>told</b> by the narrator that “Her feelings were strong and deep, but reserved; even as a child she seldom cried, and now she seldom even sighed and only grew slightly pale when anything distressed her.” She engages in intellectual conversations with Rudin (which are not discouraged by her mother because she thinks that these conversations “improve her mind”); Natasha thinks highly of Rudin, who confides to her his ideas and “privately gives her books”, and soon falls in love with him. She also often compels him to apply his talents and act. Natasha is often thought of as the first of 'Turgenev maids' to feature in Turgenev's fiction.|$|E
25|$|On 1 January Derby told Haig that {{he saved}} Robertson from the sack by {{threatening}} resignation. He also hinted to Haig {{that the government}} wanted the removal of Launcelot Kiggell (“a tired man”) as BEF Chief of Staff, and that General Butler, Haig’s preferred choice, was not acceptable. Haig had {{an interview with the}} King (2 January) to pick up his Field Marshal’s baton. Haig appears to have been placing too much faith in recent German peace feelers ("Germany is now ready, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>told,</b> to give all we want in these respects"), now known not have been seriously intended. He told the King that British soldiers (who, in a large conscript army, now included men from “all classes in the nation, and many are most intelligent”) needed to be told what they were fighting for. In Haig’s view, Britain should keep to her original war aims - the defence of France and liberation of Belgium - not try to gain Alsace-Lorraine for France or Trieste for Italy. In Haig's view the “democratising of Germany”, about to be publicly reiterated by Lloyd George as a British aspiration in his Caxton Hall speech (5 January), was likely to destabilise Germany, as the fall of the Tsar in March 1917 had destabilised Russia, and was not “worth the loss of an Englishman” (like many Scots of his era, Haig often referred to Britain or even the British Empire as “England”).|$|E
25|$|Science is a {{magnificent}} force, {{but it is}} not a teacher of morals. It can perfect machinery, but it adds no moral restraints to protect society from the misuse of the machine. It can also build gigantic intellectual ships, but it constructs no moral rudders for the control of storm-tossed human vessel. It not only fails to supply the spiritual element needed but some of its unproven hypotheses rob the ship of its compass and thus endanger its cargo. In war, science has proven itself an evil genius; it has made war more terrible than it ever was before. Man used to be content to slaughter his fellowmen on a single plane, the earth's surface. Science has taught him to go down into the water and shoot up from below and to go up into the clouds and shoot down from above, thus making the battlefield three times as bloody as it was before; but science does not teach brotherly love. Science has made war so hellish that civilization was about to commit suicide; and now <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>told</b> that newly discovered instruments of destruction will make the cruelties of the late war seem trivial in comparison with the cruelties of wars that may come in the future. If civilization is to be saved from the wreckage threatened by intelligence not consecrated by love, it must be saved by the moral code of the meek and lowly Nazarene. His teachings, and His teachings alone, can solve the problems that vex the heart and perplex the world.|$|E

2500|$|A {{representative}} of the original trawling syndicate that purchased the Koraaga said yesterday: [...] "We started with everything against us. State administration had muddled every path we wanted to take. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>told</b> that people would not eat trawled fish. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>told</b> that trawled fish could not <b>be</b> landed fresh. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>told</b> <b>we</b> should not make our running expenses. To-day <b>we</b> <b>are</b> doing everything that the State industry at tempted, and are making it pay. We have put the trawling industry firmly on its feet. We started off with no better equipment than the State, and with handicaps Imposed on us by the State., But throughout we had the advantages of business administration and of cleanliness. As for the profits to be made, take our own case. Our profits have long since repaid us the cost of our trawler. We have Just floated ourselves into a company, with a capital of £20,000. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> looking round now in Scotland for a second trawler. We have only begun to show the possibilities of the industry. There are further big developments to come." ...|$|R

500|$|After {{speaking}} about the atomic theory of Democritus, Maxwell goes on {{to tell us that}} the word 'molecule' is a modern word. [...] He states, [...] "it does not occur in Johnson's Dictionary. [...] The ideas it embodies are those belonging to modern chemistry." [...] <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>told</b> that an 'atom' is a material point, invested and surrounded by 'potential forces' and that when 'flying molecules' strike against a solid body in constant succession it causes what is called pressure of air and other gases. [...] At this point, however, Maxwell notes that no one has ever seen or handled a molecule.|$|E
500|$|The {{debate has}} {{received}} technical criticism as well. Steven A. Edwards in The Nanotech Pioneers {{noted that the}} ambiguity of the specifications and even definition of a molecular assembler makes {{an evaluation of the}} argument difficult and minimizes its scientific implications. He remarked that [...] "nowhere in it does Nanosystems contain a blueprint for a molecular assembler... <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>told,</b> for instance, that a manipulator arm would involve 4,000,000 atoms, but we are not told which atoms, or how they would be put together." [...] He concludes that [...] "the debate over mechanosynthesis so far is huge to the participants, but mainly an entertaining academic diversion to most nanotechnologists." ...|$|E
500|$|Aly Michalka as Charlotte Barnes, popular ex-cheerleader {{and senior}} {{at the high}} school that Will attends. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>told</b> later in the film that her ailing father does not approve of how she only runs with the [...] "Populars" [...] in school. [...] Charlotte makes a vow to forsake the populars and run with the geekier teens like Will and Sa5m in hopes that this good {{behavior}} will cause her dad to get well. She terms this an [...] "experiment".
