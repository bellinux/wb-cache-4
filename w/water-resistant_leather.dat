40|$|Influence {{of acetate}} ion on {{stability}} of alumina-zirconium tanning to alkalization {{has been investigated}} in the paper. The investigation results have shown that at the ratio of Al 3 + :Zr 4 + :CH 3 COO = 1 : 1 : 1 it  is  possible  to  prepare  a  solution  of  masking    alumina-zirconium  tanning  (АЦД-М)   with  high stability and low consumption of aluminum sulfate. The paper reveals that masking of alumina-zirconium tanning by natrium acetate allows to increase stability to alkalization and improve tanning properties. It has been established that for a stable increase of fatty matter viscosity and improvement of  <b>leather</b> <b>water-resistant</b> properties {{it is necessary to}} use water-insoluble aluminum and zirconium soaps of carboxylic acids. </p...|$|R

5000|$|Russia leather is a <b>water-resistant</b> <b>leather,</b> oiled with {{birch oil}} after tanning. This leather {{was a major}} export good from 17th and 18th century Russia, as the {{availability}} of birch oil limited its geographical production. The oil impregnation also deterred insect attack and gave a distinctive and pleasant aroma that {{was seen as a}} mark of quality in leather.|$|E
5000|$|Deerskin is a tough, <b>water-resistant</b> <b>leather,</b> {{possibly}} {{due to the}} animal's {{adaptations to}} its thorny and thicket-filled habitats. Deerskin {{has been used by}} many societies, including indigenous Americans. Most modern deerskin is no longer procured from the wild, with deer farms breeding the animals specifically for the purpose of their skins. Large quantities are still tanned from wild deer hides in historic tanning towns such as Gloversville and Johnstown in upstate New York. Deerskin is used in jackets and overcoats, martial arts equipment such as kendo bogu, as well as personal accessories such as handbags and wallets.|$|E
50|$|During the Battle of Crécy, in August 1346, {{upwards of}} 5,000 Genoese crossbowmen were {{employed}} by the French in the first line against the English. At around 4 PM, a sudden rainstorm arose. The English longbowmen simply removed their bowstrings, and stored them under their <b>water-resistant</b> <b>leather</b> caps to keep them dry. Crossbows, on the other hand, cannot be unstrung and restrung without tools. The strings of the crossbows thus became stretched upon being drenched by rain. When the rain-soaked and now-stretched crossbow strings were used roughly an hour later during the initial attack against the emplaced and defending English, the crossbows were largely rendered useless, with their maximum ranges and bolt speeds greatly reduced from their normal performance. When the Genoese crossbowmen came under heavy long distance clouds of clothyard shafts from the English longbowmen, the Genoese commander, Ottone Doria, ordered his troops to retreat. The French knights behind the Genoese crossbowmen saw this as cowardice and cut them down as they retreated. Most of the crossbowmen were killed, their commander included. Losing {{only a very small}} number of soldiers, the English won the battle handily through directed long distance shooting with longbows against the French men-at-arms and the Genoese crossbowmen.|$|E
