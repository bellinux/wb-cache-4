40|$|This paper aims to {{describe}} {{some of the}} current literature on <b>work</b> <b>breaks</b> and to discuss important issues related to <b>work</b> <b>breaks</b> for keyboard operators. The relationship between <b>work</b> <b>breaks</b> and fatigue is examined, {{as well as the}} relationship between fatigue and injury. From the present literature available, {{there is no evidence to}} support any particular work/rest regime to reduce fatigue. Physiological studies support the concept of short frequent pauses (micropauses) as being the most effective way of reducing neuromuscular fatigue. No universal regime will be suitable for every keyboard situation. Prescribed regimented <b>work</b> <b>breaks</b> have many disadvantages and should be avoided if possible in favour of <b>work</b> <b>breaks</b> that are spontaneous or designed into the work...|$|R

It will evidently follow, {{upon our}} {{application}} of this test of natural resemblance, that we shall at once conclude that all perfectly beautiful forms must be composed of curves; since there is hardly any common natural form {{in which it is}} possible to discover a straight line. Nevertheless, Architecture, having necessarily to deal with straight lines essential to its purposes in many instances and to the expression of its power in others, must frequently be content with that measure of beauty which is consistent with such primal forms; and we may presume that utmost measure of beauty to have been attained when the arrangements of such lines are consistent with the most frequent natural groupings of them we can discover, although, to find right lines in nature at all, we may be compelled to do violence to her finished <b>work,</b> <b>break</b> through the sculptured and colored surfaces of her crags, and examine the processes of their crystallisation.|$|E

40|$|An {{effective}} {{way to reduce the}} duration and cost of projects with repetitive activities is through the relaxation of resource continuity and the introduction of <b>work</b> <b>breaks</b> at strategic points between repetitive project units. This paper describes the problem and introduces the basic concepts for determining the optimal location and duration of <b>work</b> <b>breaks</b> for both deterministic and probabilistic activity durations. The procedure is described in detail and is applied to an example project with 9 activities with probabilistic durations that repeat over 10 similar work units. The solution employs concepts from the Repetitive Scheduling Method (RSM), the Sequence Step Algorithm (SQS-AL), and is modeled in STROBOSCOPE, an activity-based simulation system. Numerical and graphical results explain the process and the underlying time and cost tradeoffs. ...|$|R

Claude used a high cooked caramel mixed with coffee until the right combination was achieved.|$|E

50|$|Nahum Tevet was {{the most}} extreme of the Israeli Minimalists in the mid-1970s.

However, at least two qualities in his <b>work</b> <b>break</b> the rules of Minimalism: the lyric quality of his color and line, and the frequent resemblance of his works to real objects, like tables or beds.
