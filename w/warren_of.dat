5|$|The British post-hardcore band Fall of Efrafa is {{a concept}} band who has {{recorded}} a trilogy of albums based loosely on the mythology of Watership Down. This trilogy is known as The <b>Warren</b> <b>of</b> Snares and consists of the albums Owsla (2006), Elil (2007) and Inlé (2009).|$|E
5|$|Passenger staterooms {{have largely}} {{deteriorated}} {{because they were}} framed in perishable softwoods like teak and pine, leaving a <b>warren</b> <b>of</b> hanging electrical wire, light fixtures and debris interspersed with more durable items like brass bed frames, light fixtures, and marble-topped washstands. Woodwork with attachments like doorknobs, drawer-pulls or push-plates survive in better condition {{because of the small}} electric charge emitted by metal which repels fish and other harmful organisms. On the whole hardwoods like mahogany, the material for most stateroom furnishings, is more resistant to decay. Lavatories and bathrooms within the passenger quarters survive because they were framed in steel.|$|E
5|$|The City was {{essentially}} medieval in its street plan, an overcrowded <b>warren</b> <b>of</b> narrow, winding, cobbled alleys. It had experienced several major fires before 1666, {{the most recent}} in 1632. Building with wood and roofing with thatch had been prohibited for centuries, but these cheap materials continued to be used. The only major stone-built area was the wealthy centre of the City, where the mansions of the merchants and brokers stood on spacious lots, surrounded by an inner ring of overcrowded poorer parishes whose every inch of building space was used to accommodate the rapidly growing population. These parishes contained workplaces, {{many of which were}} fire hazards—foundries, smithies, glaziers—which were theoretically illegal in the City but tolerated in practice.|$|E
50|$|Five {{other members}} of the family may also be mentioned. Thomas <b>Warren,</b> third son <b>of</b> the first Baronet, was a Member of Parliament. His ninth son Brisbane Warren was the father of the Very Reverend Thomas Brisbane <b>Warren,</b> Dean <b>of</b> Cork. Richard <b>Warren,</b> second son <b>of</b> Reverend Robert <b>Warren,</b> eldest son <b>of</b> Reverend Robert <b>Warren,</b> fifth son <b>of</b> the first Baronet, was a major-general in the British Army. Augustus Edmund <b>Warren,</b> second son <b>of</b> Richard Benson <b>Warren,</b> seventh son <b>of</b> the first Baronet, was also a major-general in the British Army. Robert <b>Warren,</b> son <b>of</b> Captain Henry <b>Warren,</b> eighth son <b>of</b> the first Baronet, was a {{politician}} and judge.|$|R

5|$|The {{buildings}} stand above a <b>warren</b> <b>of</b> tunnels: previously, {{live animals}} {{were brought to}} market by hoof (from the mid-19th century onwards they arrived by rail) and were slaughtered on site. The former railway tunnels are now used for storage, parking and as basements. An impressive cobbled ramp spirals down around West Smithfield's public garden, {{on the south side}} of the Market, providing access to part of this area. Some of the buildings on Charterhouse Street on Smithfield north side maintain access to the tunnels via their basements.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause of}} the {{explosion}} was debated in the days immediately following the fire. Public speculation led {{to the arrest of}} Crocker and Warren, the occupants of the warehouse. The Daily-Tribune reported that the explosions could not have occurred without the presence of gunpowder in addition to the saltpeter, and thus they were suspected of possessing gunpowder, which would have led to a murder charge. However, later inquiry released Crocker and <b>Warren</b> <b>of</b> all charges as no evidence of gunpowder was discovered.|$|E
5|$|In 1295 Westminster was {{the venue}} for the Model Parliament, the first English {{representative}} assembly, summoned by EdwardI; during his reign he called sixteen parliaments, which sat {{either in the}} Painted Chamber or the White Chamber. By 1332 the barons (representing the titled classes) and burgesses and citizens (representing the commons) began to meet separately, and by 1377 the two bodies were entirely detached. In 1512 a fire destroyed part of the royal palace complex and HenryVIII moved the royal residence to the nearby Palace of Whitehall, although Westminster still retained {{its status as a}} royal palace. In 1547 Henry's son, EdwardVI, provided St Stephen's Chapel for the Commons to use as their debating chamber. The House of Lords met in the medieval hall of the Queen's Chamber, before moving to the Lesser Hall in 1801. Over the three centuries from 1547 the palace was enlarged and altered, becoming a <b>warren</b> <b>of</b> wooden passages and stairways.|$|E

50|$|Warren {{incorporated}} as {{a village}} in 1893. Another settlement grew a few {{miles to the south}} of the village <b>of</b> <b>Warren.</b> This settlement incorporated as the village of Center Line in 1925. Center Line became a city in 1936 and was no longer part <b>of</b> <b>Warren</b> Township. On October 27, 1956, Governor G. Mennen Williams signed the charter that incorporated the remainder of the township, including the village <b>of</b> <b>Warren,</b> as the city <b>of</b> <b>Warren.</b> The city <b>of</b> <b>Warren</b> began operations on January 1, 1957.|$|R
5|$|The Allies' {{failure to}} secure a bridge over the Lower Rhine spelled the end of Market Garden. While all other {{objectives}} had been achieved, the failure to secure the Arnhem road bridge over the Rhine meant that the operation failed in its ultimate objective. Field Marshal Montgomery claimed that the operation was 90% successful and the Allies did possess a deep salient into German occupied territory that was quickly reinforced. Milton Shulman observed that the operation had driven a wedge into the German positions, isolating the 15th Army north of Antwerp from the First Parachute Army {{on the eastern side}} of the bulge. This complicated the supply problem of the 15th Army and removed the chance of the Germans being able to assemble enough troops for a serious counterattack to retake Antwerp. Chester Wilmot agreed with this, claiming that the salient was of immense tactical value for the purpose of driving the Germans from the area south of the Maas and removing the threat of an immediate counterattack against Antwerp. Kershaw views the situation differently, observing that the north flank of the west wall was not turned and the 15th Army was able to escape. Dr. John <b>Warren</b> <b>of</b> the American Historical Division of the United States Air Force believed that the Allies now controlled a salient leading nowhere. John Waddy is of the belief that the strategic and tactical debate of Market Garden will never be resolved.|$|E
25|$|William Johnson {{was born}} around 1715 in County Meath, in the Kingdom of Ireland. He was {{the eldest son}} of Christopher Johnson (1687–1764) of Smithstown, Co.

25|$|Two of {{the largest}} known {{collections}} belong to the hobbyists who built them. Philip <b>Warren</b> <b>of</b> England has a collection of 432 ship models built {{on the scale of}} 1:300, all of which he constructed himself. Erick Navas of Peru has a collection of 650 warships, some of which he built from scratch.|$|E

Sir Edward <b>Warren,</b> Baron <b>of</b> Stockport, gave {{additional}} increments to the Masters of the School {{over and above}} the salary paid by the Goldsmiths. He was High Sheriff of Cheshire in 1598. John and Edward Warren in 1705 arranged for a payment out of the manorial rates to be given to the Schoolmaster and Edward <b>Warren,</b> Lord <b>of</b> the Manor of Stockport in 1711 gave a considerable area of Great Moor to provide a permanent income for the Schoolmaster, the Mayor of the Town and the poor.|$|R

25|$|Due to more {{apparent}} than real lack of speed, enthusiasm and leadership, {{as well as some}} past grudges and a personality conflict, after Warren had just personally led a final heroic charge to end the battle, Sheridan unfairly relieved <b>Warren</b> <b>of</b> command of V Corps when the successful battle concluded. The Union Army held Five Forks and the road to the South Side Railroad {{at the end of the}} battle.|$|E
25|$|Clare Boothe Luce's {{emergence}} as a formidable political orator in Congress made her a candidate to deliver the keynote speech at the 1944 Republican National Convention. She did not, however, win that honor, as many reports erroneously state. (Nor was she {{the first woman to}} address a national political convention: Corinne Roosevelt Robinson did so in 1920.) Governor Earl <b>Warren</b> <b>of</b> California was ultimately selected as keynote speaker, and Luce was asked to introduce Herbert Hoover. After seeing a draft of her proposed remarks, Hoover suggested that for him to introduce her.|$|E
25|$|At the Battle of Five Forks on April 1, 1865, Sheridan judged {{that the}} V Corps had moved too {{slowly into the}} attack, and criticised Warren {{fiercely}} for not being {{at the front of}} his columns. Warren had been held up, searching for Samuel W. Crawford’s division, which had gone astray in the woods. But overall, he had handled his corps efficiently, and their attack had carried the day at Five Forks, arguably the pivotal battle of the final days. Nevertheless, Sheridan relieved <b>Warren</b> <b>of</b> command on the spot. He was assigned to the defenses of Petersburg and then briefly to command of the Department of Mississippi.|$|E

25|$|Despite his {{southern}} background at a {{time when}} the region was solidly Democratic in political affiliation, Scott was an active Republican. In 1944, he attended the massive rally organized by David O. Selznick in the Los Angeles Coliseum in support of the Dewey-Bricker ticket as well as Governor Earl <b>Warren</b> <b>of</b> California, who would become Dewey's running mate in 1948 and later the Chief Justice of the United States. The gathering drew 93,000, with Cecil B. DeMille as the master of ceremonies and short speeches by Hedda Hopper and Walt Disney. Among those in attendance were Ann Sothern, Ginger Rogers, Adolphe Menjou, and Gary Cooper. Despite the good turnout at the rally, most Hollywood celebrities who took a public position sided with the Roosevelt-Truman ticket.|$|E
25|$|During King George's War, {{also called}} the War of the Austrian Succession (1744–1748), a force of New England militia under William Pepperell and Commodore Peter <b>Warren</b> <b>of</b> the Royal Navy succeeded in {{capturing}} Louisbourg in 1745. By the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle that ended the war in 1748, France resumed control of Louisbourg in exchange for some of its conquests in the Netherlands and India. The New Englanders were outraged, and as a counterweight to the continuing French strength at Louisbourg, the British founded the military settlement of Halifax in 1749. During King George's War, military conflicts in Nova Scotia included: Raid on Canso; Siege of Annapolis Royal (1744); the Siege of Louisbourg (1745); the Duc d'Anville Expedition and the Battle of Grand Pré.|$|E
25|$|In May 1980 Union Rotorua was on {{passage from}} Tauranga to Sydney when she broke down 200 {{miles west of}} Cape Maria van Diemen. Union Rotoiti was only 80 miles away and the two masters agreed to attempt a tow. Captain Andrew Keyworth, {{one of the most}} senior masters of the USSCo, was the master of Union Rotoiti. With much skill on his part, and while the ships were {{sometimes}} only 25 metres apart, a line was made fast between the two ships by use of a line-carrying rocket. Once the tow began 422nm were covered in just over 56 hours at an average speed of 7.5 knots. It was a feat never before accomplished with two ships of this size, and Captain John <b>Warren</b> <b>of</b> Union Rotorua later exclaimed: ‘If anyone had previously tried to tell me it was possible … I would have thought them quite barmy’.|$|E

500|$|It wasn't {{until the}} late 19th century that {{scholars}} (including Paul Meyer) began entertaining the notion that Jean Renart, until then only known as the presumptive author of the Lai de l'Ombre, might also be responsible for either {{or both of the}} two contemporary romances L'Escoufle and Guillaume de Dole. F. M. <b>Warren</b> <b>of</b> Yale University, in a 1908 article, is one of the early proponents of identifying Renart as the author of all three, based on versification, phrasing, and vocabulary, and places the development of his poetic talent between 1195 and 1205. The next-to-last line of the poem contains an anagram on Renart's name: [...] "...qu'il enTRA EN Religion." ...|$|E
