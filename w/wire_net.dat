According to the legend, Toyotomi Hideyoshi ran out of stones when building the original three-story keep, and an old woman heard about his trouble.

At high densities, elephants potentially have negative impacts on the environment, specifically to large trees. Because of this, recent increases of elephants in the Associated Private Nature Reserves (APNR) on the Western Boundary of Kruger National Park, South Africa have caused concern regarding the health of several species of tree. My objective {{was to assess the}} effectiveness of wrapping protective <b>wire</b> <b>netting</b> around the trunk of the tree in preventing and reducing bark stripping by elephants. 2, 668 trees, 1352 marula (Sclerocarya birrea), 857 knobthorn (Acacia Nigrescens), and 459 false marula (Lannea schweinfurti), were assessed for elephant impact in the APNR, 1387 (52 %) of which had previously been wrapped in protective <b>wire</b> <b>netting</b> (789, 548, and 50 respectively). For knobthorn and marula, <b>wire</b> <b>netting</b> significantly decreased the number of the trees that were bark stripped. For all trees, <b>wire</b> <b>netting</b> decreased the level of bark stripping especially for the highest impact levels. No trees wrapped with wire were ringbarked, compared to 23 unwired trees. In addition, <b>wire</b> <b>netting</b> had an effect on the distribution of damage for the highest impact class incurred regardless of type. A higher relative frequency of wired trees were found in lower impact categories compared to unwired trees. <b>Wire</b> <b>netting</b> is a low maintenance and ecologically valuable technique that alleviates bark stripping for some species.

At high densities, elephants potentially have negative impacts on the environment, specifically for large trees. Because of this, recent increases of elephants in the Associated Private Nature Reserves (APNR) on the western boundary of the Kruger National Park (KNP), South Africa, have caused concern regarding the survival of several tree species. Our objective {{was to assess the}} effectiveness of wrapping protective <b>wire</b> <b>netting</b> around the trunk of the tree for preventing and reducing bark stripping, branch breaking, and felling by elephants. We assessed 2668 trees – 1352 Sclerocarya birrea (marula), 857 Acacia nigrescens (knobthorn), and 459 Lannea schweinfurthii (false marula) – for elephant impact in the APNR, 1387 (52 %) of which had previously been wrapped in protective <b>wire</b> <b>netting</b> (789, 548 and 50, respectively). <b>Wire</b> <b>netting</b> was effective in reducing the severity of bark stripping and the relative proportion of trees that were bark stripped.

5000|$|Pont Battant: Originally {{this was}} an ancient Roman stone bridge with five arches and a width of about 4 metres. For long times {{it was the only}} bridge over the river Doubs. During the Middle Ages and renaissance the bridge was {{repaired}} and modified several times. At the beginning of the 20th century, the Pont Battant consisted of the main three arches, the river Doubs flew through, a small arch at the old town river bank and an even sized arch at Battant quarter end that was actually a 90 degree tunnel, beginning under the riverside Promenade heading through the arch (that days under a street crossing; see postcard dating 1906) and ending under the Promenade on the other side. Unfortunately the bridge was partially destroyed during World War II and restored as a provisional solution. The replacement bridge, built in 1953 in concrete, had only a single arch, the design being intended {{to reduce the risk of}} flooding, like the January 1910 Doubs river flood. The bridge was often the site of an informal market where one may buy things from Sub-Saharan Africa due to its deck of 60 x 17 metres. After 60 years the concrete bridge had to be replaced. At 10. March 2012 Besançon city organized an event that ends up with the symbolic burning down the Pont Battant. The bridge was shut in April. Disassembling began in May. A pedestrian bridge was built on an interim basis. This temporary bridge was deconstructed, when 20. June 2013 the new bridge patially opened for footpathers and bicyclists only. The new Pont Battant was tested to take the weight of 400 tons, although it will have to withstand a calculated max weight of 160 tons. It passed the test at 28. October 2013. The first tram, named after the French writer [...] "Victor Hugo", crossed the new Pont Battant 15 January 2014. The new bridge has a single arch made of 1,100 tons of steel filled with 800 tons of concrete. It spreads 60 metres (the bridge segment is 65 metres), at a width of 24 metres and costs 7 million Euros. On the surface a mixture of resin and sand was spray coated. The immense width is needed to provide enough space for the 90 degrees curved rails for trams and a wide sidewalk.
