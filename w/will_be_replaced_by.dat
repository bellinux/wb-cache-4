Also, would may <b>be</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> another appropriate modal: could, should, might.|$|R
5|$|Since 1999 the RAAF has put its Hornets {{through a}} series of {{upgrades}} to improve their effectiveness. However, the aircraft are becoming increasingly difficult to operate and are at risk of being outclassed by the fighters and air-defence systems operated by other countries. As a result, the RAAF will begin to retire its F/A-18s in the late 2010s, and the last aircraft will leave service in the early 2020s. Under current Australian Government planning they <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> 72 Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II fighters.|$|E

5|$|The Dnestr/Dnepr radars were {{intended}} {{to be replaced by}} the newer Daryal radars starting in the 1990s. Only two of the planned Daryal radars became operational, due to issues such as the dissolution of the Soviet Union. As of 2012, the Russian early warning network still consists of some radars of this vintage. It is likely that all the existing radars <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> the third generation Voronezh radars by 2020.|$|E

5|$|The Nuclear Reactor Building {{was added}} to the National Register of Historic Places in 2009, after a {{campaign}} led by an architecture student in response to the proposed demolition of the building. Amid concerns from preservation groups and the City of Seattle, the UW Board of Regents ultimately decided in February 2016 to demolish the structure. The building was demolished in July 2016 and <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> a new computer science building.|$|E
5|$|If a {{representative}} is absent for whatever reason, {{his or her}} seat will be filled by a candidate from the same party-list—in other words, there are no by-elections. Representatives who die during the term are replaced permanently, whereas representatives who are appointed to a government position, such as government minister (cabinet member) or state secretary, <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> a deputy representative until the representative no longer holds the government position. Deputy representatives also meet during typically short-term absence, like when {{a representative}} travels abroad with a parliamentary work group or is absent for health reasons.|$|E
5|$|The {{pattern of}} 105.5, 8, 121.5 and 8 years {{is not the}} only pattern that is {{possible}} within the 243-year cycle, because of the slight mismatch between the times when the Earth and Venus arrive at the point of conjunction. Prior to 1518, the pattern of transits was 8, 113.5 and 121.5 years, and the eight inter-transit gaps before the AD 546 transit were 121.5 years apart. The current pattern will continue until 2846, when it <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> a pattern of 105.5, 129.5 and 8 years. Thus, the 243-year cycle is relatively stable, but the number of transits and their timing within the cycle will vary over time. Since the 243:395 Earth:Venus commensurability is only approximate, there are different sequences of transits occurring 243 years apart, each extending for several thousand years, which are eventually replaced by other sequences. For instance, there is a series which ended in 541 BC, and the series which includes 2117 only started in AD 1631.|$|E

5|$|Working together, the Autobots {{and human}} {{soldiers}} manage to rescue Carly and kill Laserbeak, Starscream, Soundwave and Shockwave, with Optimus using Shockwave's arm-cannon to blast the Control Pillar, disabling the Space Bridge. Sam confronts Gould as he reactivates the Control Pillar, and knocks Gould into the Pillar, electrocuting him. Bumblebee and Ratchet arrive {{and destroy the}} Control Pillar, permanently disabling the Bridge and causing the partially transported Cybertron to implode. Optimus and Sentinel fight while Carly convinces Megatron that he <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> Sentinel {{as leader of the}} Decepticons. Sentinel severs Optimus' right arm, and is about to execute him when Megatron intervenes, incapacitating Sentinel. Megatron slyly proposes a truce, having the desire to become the one in charge again, but Optimus instead attacks Megatron, decapitating and killing him. Sentinel pleads for his life, but Optimus executes him too for betraying his own principles. With the Decepticons defeated, Carly and Sam are reunited and the Autobots accept that, with Cybertron gone for good, Earth is now their home.|$|E
