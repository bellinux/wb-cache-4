5|$|Knowing that Angel {{has been}} cursed {{so that if}} he ever {{experiences}} pure happiness, he <b>will</b> <b>once</b> again lose his soul, Darla later returns and sleeps with him, but her plot fails; being with her only brings Angel despair, {{as well as providing}} him with a new understanding of his role as a champion.

Her pregnancy allows Darla to experience emotions that had previously been lost to her {{in the presence of the}} human soul of her unborn child. Admitting that creating life with Angel was the only good thing they ever did together, Darla makes sure Angel will relay that to their child before she stakes herself through the heart, sacrificing her life so their son, Connor, can be born.
