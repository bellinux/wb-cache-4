40|$|Abstract <b>When</b> <b>you</b> have a perceptual {{experience}} of a given physical object that object seems to be immediately present {{to you in a}} way it never does <b>when</b> <b>you</b> consciously <b>think</b> <b>about</b> or imagine it. Many philosophers have claimed that naı̈ve realism (the view that to perceive is to stand in a primitive relation of acquaintance to the world) can provide a satisfying account of this phenomenological directness of perceptual experience while the content view (the view that to perceive is to represent the world to be a certain way) cannot. I argue that this claim is false. Specifically, I maintain that the only acceptable naı̈ve realist account of the relevant phenomenology is circular and that the content view can provide a similar account. In addition, I maintain that a certain specific variety of the content view provides a non-circular and thus more satisfactory account of this phenomenology. If so, then contrary to what is commonly assumed there are powerful phenomenological grounds for preferring the content view to naı̈ve realism...|$|R

In response to Daniel's death, Cuse said, [...] "It was an incredibly painful thing to kill this beloved character, but we feel that’s what this show has to do. His death is kind of the culminating event in the entire season. It really ends one chapter and commences the start of the final chapter of the entire series." [...] Once the show runners explained that to Davies, he was saddened that his full-time status on Lost was coming to an end, but put the story [...] "above his own personal self". Damon seconded Carlton's emotions, adding that Jeremy took the news well: [...] "When Carlton and I called Jeremy to explain what was going to be happening with Daniel, we’ve never had a more awesome exit interview with somebody on the show.

[...] VanDerWerff continued that when thinking about the MCU as a television series, many [...] "common criticisms people tend to level at it take on a new context" [...] such as complaints that the films are formulaic, lack [...] "visual spark", or [...] "shoehorn in story elements" [...] that [...] "are necessary to set up future films", all characteristics that [...] "are fairly typical on television, where a director's influence is much lower than that of the showrunner", in this case, Feige. Comparing the films to the series Game of Thrones specifically, VanDerWerff noted that each solo film checks [...] "in on various characters and their individual side stories, before bringing everyone together in the finale (or, rather, an Avengers film)", with Guardians of the Galaxy being equivalent to the character Daenerys Targaryen—"both separated by long distances from everybody else." [...] He noted that this format was an extension of early [...] "TV-like" [...] film franchises such as Star Wars, as well as the format of the comics upon which the films are based. [...] "I say all of this not to suggest that film franchises resembling TV series is necessarily a good trend", VanDerWerff concluded, [...] "For as much as I generally enjoy the Marvel movies, I'm disheartened by the possibility that their particular form might take over the film industry ... But I also don't think it's {{the end of the world}} if Marvel continues on ... there's a reason TV has stolen so much of the cultural conversation over the past few decades.
