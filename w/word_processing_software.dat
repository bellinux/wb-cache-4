5|$|Although the ZX Microdrive was {{initially}} greeted with good reviews, it never took {{off as a}} distribution method due to worries {{about the quality of}} the cartridges and piracy. Hence the main use became to complement tape releases, usually utilities and niche products like the Tasword <b>word</b> <b>processing</b> <b>software</b> and Trans Express, (a tape to microdrive copying utility). No games are known to be exclusively released on Microdrive.|$|E
25|$|The Wang <b>word</b> <b>processing</b> <b>software</b> {{was also}} very graphical.

25|$|Acute accents {{may be used}} to emphasise a word in a phrase, on the vowel in the {{stressed}} syllable. If the vowel {{is written}} as a digraph, an acute accent is put on both parts of the digraph. Although that rule includes ij, the acute accent on the j is frequently omitted (resulting in íj instead of íj́), as putting an acute accent on a j is problematic in most <b>word</b> <b>processing</b> <b>software.</b> If the vowel is written as more than two letters, the accent is put on the first two vowel letters.|$|E

25|$|The {{unlicensed}} clone {{market has}} flourished following Nintendo's discontinuation of the NES. Some {{of the more}} exotic of these resulting systems have gone beyond the functionality of the original hardware and have included variations such as a portable system with a color LCD (e.g. PocketFami). Others have been produced with certain specialized markets in mind, such as an NES clone that functions as a rather primitive personal computer, which includes a keyboard and basic <b>word</b> <b>processing</b> <b>software.</b> These unauthorized clones have been helped by {{the invention of the}} so-called NES-on-a-chip.|$|E
25|$|Microsoft Word is {{the most}} widely used <b>word</b> <b>processing</b> <b>software</b> {{according}} to a user tracking system built into the software. Microsoft estimates that roughly half a billion people use the Microsoft Office suite, which includes Word. Many other word processing applications exist, including WordPerfect (which dominated the market from the mid-1980s to early-1990s on computers running Microsoft's MS-DOS operating system, and still (2014) is favored for legal applications), Apple's Pages application, and open source applications such as OpenOffice.org Writer, LibreOffice Writer, AbiWord, KWord, and LyX. Web-based word processors such as Office Online or Google Docs are a relatively new category.|$|E
25|$|Newspapers {{are usually}} printed on cheap, off-white paper known as newsprint. Since the 1980s, the {{newspaper}} industry has largely {{moved away from}} lower-quality letterpress printing to higher-quality, four-color process, offset printing. In addition, desktop computers, <b>word</b> <b>processing</b> <b>software,</b> graphics software, digital cameras and digital prepress and typesetting technologies have revolutionized the newspaper production process. These technologies have enabled newspapers to publish color photographs and graphics, as well as innovative layouts and better design. To help their titles stand out on newsstands, some newspapers are printed on coloured newsprint. For example, the Financial Times is printed on a distinctive salmon pink paper, and Sheffield's weekly sports publication derives its name, the Green 'Un, from the traditional colour of its paper. The Italian sports newspaper La Gazzetta dello Sport is also printed on pink paper while L'Équipe (formerly L'Auto) is printed on yellow paper. Both the latter promoted major cycling races and their newsprint colours were reflected in the colours of the jerseys used to denote the race leader; for example the leader in the Giro d'Italia wears a pink jersey.|$|E

50|$|Samna was a {{competitor}} to WordStar and MultiMate in the DOS market for word processors in the 1980s.

2500|$|Other early word-processing {{software}} required users to memorize semi-mnemonic key combinations rather than pressing keys labelled [...] "copy" [...] or [...] "bold". (In fact, many early PCs lacked cursor keys; WordStar famously used the E-S-D-X-centered [...] "diamond" [...] for cursor navigation, and modern vi-like editors encourage use of hjkl for navigation.) However, the price differences between dedicated word processors and general-purpose PCs, {{and the value}} added to the latter by software such as VisiCalc, were so compelling that personal computers and <b>word</b> <b>processing</b> <b>software</b> soon became serious competition for the dedicated machines. Word processing became the most popular use for personal computers, and unlike the spreadsheet (dominated by Lotus 1-2-3) and database (dBase) markets, WordPerfect, XyWrite, Microsoft Word, , {{and dozens of other}} <b>word</b> <b>processing</b> <b>software</b> brands competed in the 1980s; PC Magazine reviewed 57 different programs in one January 1986 issue. Development of higher-resolution monitors allowed them to provide limited WYSIWYG—What You See Is What You Get, to the extent that typographical features like bold and italics, indentation, justification and margins were approximated on screen.|$|E
2500|$|Developers were {{required}} {{to learn how to}} write software that used the Macintosh's graphic user interface, and early in the computer's history needed a Lisa 2 or Unix system to write Macintosh software. Despite standardizing on Pascal for software development Apple did not release a native-code Pascal compiler. [...] Until third-party Pascal compilers appeared, developers had to write software in other languages while still learning enough Pascal to understand Inside Macintosh. MacWrite's inclusion with the Macintosh discouraged developers from creating other <b>word</b> <b>processing</b> <b>software.</b>|$|E
2500|$|A common view {{within the}} PC {{community}} is that Wang Labs failed because it specialized in computers {{designed specifically for}} word processing and did not foresee (and was unable to compete against) general-purpose personal computers with <b>word</b> <b>processing</b> <b>software</b> in the 1980s. Word processing was not actually the mainstay of Wang's business by the time desktop computers began to gain in popularity. Although Wang manufactured desktops, its main business by the 1980s, was its VS line of mini-computer and [...] "midframe" [...] systems. The market for these mini-computers was ultimately conquered by enhanced micro-computers like the Apple Macintosh and the [...] "Wintel" [...] PC on one end and Sun, IBM and Hewlett-Packard servers on the other end.|$|E

2500|$|Wang {{wanted to}} compete against IBM as a {{computer}} company, selling directly to Management Information System departments. Before the VS, however, Wang Laboratories was not taken seriously as a computer company. The calculators, word processing systems and OIS were sold into individual departments, bypassing the corporate data-processing decision-makers. The chapter in Wang's book dealing with them shows that he saw them only as [...] "a beachhead in the Fortune 1000." [...] The Wang VS was Wang's entrée into IT departments. In his book, An Wang notes that, to sell the VS, [...] "we aggressively recruited salesmen with strong backgrounds in data processing... who had experience dealing with MIS executives, and who knew their way around Fortune 1000 companies." [...] As the VS took hold, the word processor and OIS lines were phased out. The <b>word</b> <b>processing</b> <b>software</b> continued, {{in the form of}} a loadable-microcode environment that allowed VS workstations to take on the behavior of traditional Wang WP terminals to operate with the VS and use it as a document server.|$|E
