5|$|In {{his later}} career, McMahon faced such wrestlers as Sorakichi Matsuda, Captain James C. Daly and Gus Lambert. He also faced William Muldoon, now {{a member of}} the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame. One match between the two, which took place on March 22, 1881, {{featured}} a best-of-three-falls rule, in which the wrestlers competed in Muldoon's favored Greco-Roman style, followed by the collar-and-elbow style preferred by McMahon. Each competitor won the fall in his preferred style, which led to a catch-as-catch-can match to determine the winner. The match did not take place, however, as the men were unable to agree to the outfits that would be worn during the match; as a result, the contest was declared a draw. One of McMahon's final series of matches was against Henry Moses Dufur. Their first match was declared a draw after neither competitor was able to throw the other within six hours. Although the wrestlers <b>were</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue,</b> the lease on the hall had expired and the match was ended at 2:45 in the morning. McMahon lost the second contest, but he defeated Dufur for the world collar-and-elbow championship in their final encounter.|$|E
5|$|Xenosaga Episode III {{was officially}} {{announced}} in 2005, alongside Xenosaga I & II—a Nintendo DS {{remake of the}} first two Xenosaga episodes—and Baten Kaitos Origins. With its announcement, it was widely confirmed that it would be the last installment in the Xenosaga series. While Episode III was intended as the conclusion of Shion's story arc and potentially the series, the team <b>were</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> the series if the game was a commercial success. The game was announced for a western release in April 2006. For its western release, all scenes where blood was visible were censored: the blood was removed, but all other elements remained unchanged, resulting in visual and audio inconsistencies. The game released in Japan on July 6, 2006 by Namco; in North America, the game released on August 29 of that year by Namco Bandai Games. The game was localized for the West by Namco Bandai and 8-4; Xenosaga Episode III was one of 8-4's earliest projects. English dubbing was handled by Cup of Tea Productions, who had previously worked on Episode II. Several original voice actors from Episode I, including KOS-MOS's original English actress Bridget Hoffman, were brought back after the recasting for Episode II. Unlike Episode II, Episode III was not released in Europe.|$|E

25|$|After {{contemplating the}} hijack {{of a ship}} to run the {{gauntlet}} of Bolshevik-operated coastal craft, Dunsterville decided not to risk alienating local opinion and turned back, intending to meet the party en route from Europe and make arrangements in Iran, while waiting for another chance to reach Tiflis. On 20 February, the party dodged the local authorities and returned to Hamadan, where it could use MEF and Russian army wireless stations, {{to keep in touch}} with Baghdad. It had become clear that there was little chance that the Russians formerly under Baratov could be induced to remain on service and that only Bicherakov and some of his Cossacks <b>were</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue.</b> On 11 February, Bicherakov flew to Baghdad and told Marshall that the Cossacks were willing to act as rearguard for the Russians before leaving and that the Tiflis initiative was doomed to failure. Marshall wanted an advance on Mosul to protect the Persian road but was over-ruled, in preference for operations in Palestine and at Hamadan, Dunsterville claimed that the Iranian public welcomed British protection and requested that he might wait at Hamadan to try again.|$|E
25|$|On 20 August 2006, {{during the}} fourth day of the fourth Test between England and Pakistan at The Oval, Darrell Hair and fellow umpire Billy Doctrove ruled that the Pakistani team had been {{involved}} in ball tampering. They awarded five penalty runs to England and offered them a replacement ball. The Pakistani players refused to take the field after the tea break in protest at the decision. The umpires left the field, directed the Pakistani players to resume play and returned once more 15 minutes later. After waiting two more minutes the umpires removed the bails and declared England winners by forfeiture. This was the first such end to a Test match in over 1000 tests. The Pakistani team did take to the field 25 minutes later, 55 minutes after the umpires first took to the field for a resumption of play, but by then it was Hair and Doctrove themselves who pointed out that the game had already ended with a Pakistani forfeiture the moment the bails were removed, even though both teams <b>were</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> the match. The Test was abandoned, with the match awarded to England.|$|E

2500|$|After {{the release}} of Nier, both {{director}} Yoko Taro and Square Enix producer Yosuke Saito {{wanted to create a}} sequel. When Saito spoke to assistant producer Yuki Yokoyama, Yokoyama was unwilling due to the original game's low sales. After the positive fan reception of the original Nier, however, both Square Enix and the lead staff who worked on the original game <b>were</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> the Nier IP, but also wanted to create a better, more action-oriented gameplay experience. As a result, they contacted PlatinumGames, which had developed a reputation for high-quality action games such as Bayonetta and [...] The collaboration was agreed upon on two conditions: that Yoko become director, and that he be present to help with production. The latter condition necessitated a move by Yoko from Tokyo to Osaka where PlatinumGames was located. Although Taro was initially uneasy about the collaboration, the staff at PlatinumGames had been wanting to work on a Nier game since its release, and their enthusiasm and wish to remain faithful to the original assuaged his doubts. Designer Takahisa Taura also wished to create a sequel to Nier prior to Square Enix approaching the company. The original plan was to make the game for mobile platforms or PlayStation Vita—Yoko claims that they intended for it to be similar to farming simulator Farmville—but it was soon decided to develop the game for PlayStation 4 instead. The game was co-produced by Saito and Eijiro Nishimura.|$|E

60|$|Captain Wilson, {{and his son}} {{had taken}} no part {{in any of these}} operations, as a short time after the capture of Harold and Harvey by the American cavalry the company had been disbanded. The men, when they entered the service, had volunteered for a year. This time already had been greatly exceeded--twenty months had passed since the battle of Bunker's Hill--and {{although}} the men <b>were</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> to give their services so long as it appeared to them that there was a prospect of a favorable termination of the war, no such hope any longer remained in their minds. The great army which England had sent over had done nothing toward restoring the king's authority in the colonies, and if, after a year's fighting, its outposts were still within a few miles of New York, how could it be expected or even hoped that it could ever subdue a country containing hundreds of thousands of square miles? The retreat from the Delaware and the virtual handing over of New Jersey again to Washington was the finishing stroke which decided the volunteers to demand their discharge, according to the terms of their engagement. Except during the Canadian campaign they had had but little fighting, nor in such a warfare as that which General Howe was carrying on was there much scope for their services. Many of the gentlemen who formed the majority of the company, and who for the most part had friends and connections in England, sailed for that country; some had left wives and families on their estates when they took up arms; and most of them, despairing of the final success of the war, had instructed their agents to sell these estates for any sum that they would fetch; others--among them Captain Wilson--now followed their example. It was but a mere tithe {{of the value of the}} property that was obtained, for money was scarce in the colonies, and so many had sold out and gone to England, rather than take part on one side or the other of the fratricidal strife, that land and houses fetched but nominal prices.|$|E
