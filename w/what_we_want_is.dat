Cameron stated, [...] "They were like, 'Oooooohkaaaaaay – a three-hour romantic epic? Sure, that's just <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>want.</b> <b>Is</b> {{there a little}} bit of Terminator in that? Any Harrier jets, shoot-outs, or car chases?' I said, 'No, no, no. It's not like that.'" [...] The studio was dubious about the idea's commercial prospects, but, hoping for a long-term relationship with Cameron, they gave him a greenlight.|$|E
2500|$|The idea {{of using}} an initial {{property}} {{is to set up}} the problem in terms of some auxiliary category E, and then identify that <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>is</b> to find an initial object of E. [...] This has an advantage that the optimization—the sense that we are finding the most efficient solution—means something rigorous and is recognisable, rather like the attainment of a supremum. [...] The category E is also formulaic in this construction, since it is always the category of elements of the functor to which one is constructing an adjoint. In fact, this latter category is precisely the comma category over the functor in question.|$|E

A very fiery young man was making a speech from a soapbox on the corner. A little knot of men, women, and {{children}} had collected about him. He was pointing up at my window — at me. He was saying things about us. I strained to hear... 'Municipal Ownership is no solution,' he cried, 'so long as the propertied classes own the municipalities. J.G. Phelps Stokes is a rich man — a man of property; he belongs to the capitalist class. The Municipal Ownership League is a rich man's creation. W.R. Hearst belongs in the millionaire class.

6000|$|Mr. Hobkirk, a {{large man}} with a very bad voice, made a fiery speech. [...] "Down with the middlemen," [...] he cried, and was applauded vigorously.

50|$|We PGT {{proposed}} {{the creation of}} peasant committees CALs in order {{to lay the groundwork}} for the eventual radicalization of the peasantry.

This would give the peasants a strong sense of their common needs. And if, from the system of lifetime tenure, cooperatives developed, the seeds of a more collective society would have been sown.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Artificial {{intelligence}} {{can be seen}} as {{the study}} of agents which achieve <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>want,</b> an agent being an interactive system. This can be mathematically modelled through decision theory, using probability distributions to capture <b>what</b> <b>we</b> know and utility functions to capture <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>want.</b> Optimal agents, those that maximally achieve <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>want,</b> <b>are</b> agents with maximal expected utility. We describe this theory of optimal agents. We detail how these optimal agents behave, giving an explicit formula for their actions. We discuss applications of this theory, in particular Marcus Hutter’s AIXI [Hut 04]. Finally, we suggest possible directions for future research extending Hutter’s work on universal AI...|$|R
