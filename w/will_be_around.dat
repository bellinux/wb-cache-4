25|$|Following fruit set, {{the grape}} berries are green {{and hard to}} the touch. They have very little sugar and are high in organic acids. They begin to grow to about half their final size when they enter the stage of veraison. This stage signals the {{beginning}} of the ripening process and normally takes place around 40–50 days after fruit set. In the Northern Hemisphere this <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>around</b> the end of July and into August and between the end of January into February for the Southern Hemisphere. During this stage the colors of the grape take form-red/black or yellow/green depending on the grape varieties. This color changing is due to the chlorophyll in the berry skin being replaced by anthocyanins (red wine grapes) and carotenoids (white wine grapes). In a process known as engustment, the berries start to soften as they build up sugars. Within six days of the start of veraison, the berries begin to grow dramatically as they accumulate glucose and fructose and acids begin to fall.|$|E

25|$|Boric acid in {{equilibrium}} {{with its}} conjugate base the borate ion {{is widely used}} (in the concentration range 50 - 100ppm boron equivalents) as a primary or adjunct pH buffer system in swimming pools. Boric acid is a weak acid, with pKa (the pH at which buffering is strongest because the free acid and borate ion are in equal concentrations) of 9.24 in pure water at 25°C. But apparent pKa is substantially lower in swimming pool or ocean waters because of interactions with various other molecules in solution. It <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>around</b> 9.0 in a salt-water pool. No matter which form of soluble boron is added, within the acceptable range of pH and boron concentration for swimming pools, boric acid is the predominant form in aqueous solution, {{as shown in the}} accompanying figure. The boric acid - borate system can be useful as a primary buffer system (substituting for the bicarbonate system with pKa1 = 6.0 and pKa2 = 9.4 under typical salt-water pool conditions) in pools with salt-water chlorine generators that tend to show upward drift in pH from a working range of pH 7.5 - 8.2. Buffer capacity is greater against rising pH (towards the pKa around 9.0), as illustrated in the accompanying graph. The use of boric acid in this concentration range does not allow any reduction in free HOCl concentration needed for pool sanitation, but it may add marginally to the photo-protective effects of cyanuric acid and confer other benefits through anti-corrosive activity or perceived water softness, depending on overall pool solute composition.|$|E

KBB explains that even though the residual value seems low, the projection considers that the first 200,000 Volts sold will qualify for a [...] federal tax credit, which effectively reduces the MSRP to , making the represent 51% of its original value after the tax credit. In comparison, KBB notes, the 2011 Toyota Prius has a projected residual of 46% after 36 months. KBB's estimate assumed gasoline price <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>around</b> [...] per gallon in 2014. For 2012, Kelley Blue Book expected the Volt to retain 42% of its original value after 3 years and 27% after 5 years. Based on these figures, in November 2011 KBB awarded the Volt with the 2012 Best Resale Value Awards in the plug-in electric car category. KBB explains that the residual value for the Volt is lower than the market 35.5% average due to the [...] federal tax credit, which lowers the transaction price and pushes down the residual value.|$|E
