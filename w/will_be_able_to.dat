5|$|During Part II of {{the series}} the concept of , {{altering}} the quality of chakra, is introduced. Nature manipulation allows ninja, following certain training, to convert their chakra into one of five elements: earth, water, fire, wind, and lightning.

Most ninja have a natural affinity {{for one of the}} five elements, allowing them to use jutsu of that type with greater ease. Ninja with an affinity for fire, for instance, <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> breathe fire much sooner than they <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> manipulate water.|$|E
