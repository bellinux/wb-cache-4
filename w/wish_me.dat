500|$|Within {{weeks of}} Ross's death, former cadets at Texas AMC began {{gathering}} {{funds for a}} monument. In 1917, the state appropriated $10,000 for the monument, and two years later, a 10-ft (3m) bronze statue of Ross, sculpted by Pompeo Coppini, was unveiled {{at the center of}} the Texas AMC campus. In more recent years, students began the tradition of placing pennies at the feet of statue before exams for good luck. School legend states that Ross would often tutor students, and as payment would accept only a penny for their thoughts. At exam time, his statue, located in Academic Plaza, is often covered in pennies. Country singer Granger Smith, an A graduate, wrote a song titled We Bleed Maroon, with a chorus having the line [...] "put a penny on old Sully and <b>wish</b> <b>me</b> some luck" [...] in homage to this student tradition.|$|E
