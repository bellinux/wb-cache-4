5000|$|Wolf has {{examined}} how modern Western women, born in inclusive, egalitarian liberal democracies, are assuming positions {{of leadership in}} neofascist political movements: Second-wave feminist theory abounds in assertions that war, racism, love of hierarchy, and general repressiveness belong to “patriarchy”; women’s leadership, by contrast, would naturally create a more inclusive, collaborative world. The {{problem is that it}} has never <b>worked</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> as the rise of women to leadership positions in Western Europe’s far-right parties should remind us. Leaders such as Marine Le Pen of France’s National Front, Pia Kjaersgaard of Danish People's Party, and Siv Jensen of Norway’s Progress Party reflect the enduring appeal of neofascist movements to many modern women in egalitarian, inclusive liberal democracies.|$|R
2500|$|The 1980s {{were a very}} {{turbulent}} time in Sweden that {{initiated the}} occasional decline of Social Democratic Party rule. In the 1980s, pillars of Swedish industry were massively restructured. Shipbuilding was discontinued, wood pulp was integrated into modernized paper production, the steel industry was concentrated and specialized, and mechanical engineering was digitalized. In 1986, one of the Social Democratic Party's strongest champions of egalitarianism and democracy, Olof Palme was assassinated. Swedish capital was increasingly moving Swedish investment into other European countries as the European Union coalesced, and a hegemonic consensus was forming among the elite financial community: progressive taxation and pro-egalitarian redistribution became economic heresy. A leading proponent of capital's cause at the time, Social Democrat Finance Minister Kjell-Olof Feldt reminisced in an interview, [...] "The negative inheritance I received from my predecessor Gunnar Sträng (Minister of Finance, 1955–1976) was a strongly progressive tax system with high marginal taxes. This was supposed {{to bring about a}} just and equal society. But I eventually came to the opinion that it simply didn't <b>work</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> Progressive taxes created instead a society of wranglers, cheaters, peculiar manipulations, false ambitions and new injustices. It took me at least a decade to get a part of the party to see this." [...] With the capitalist confederation's defection from the 1938 Saltsjöbaden Agreement and Swedish capital investing in other European countries rather than Sweden, as well as the global rise of neoliberal political-economic hegemony, the Social Democratic Party backed away from the progressive Meidner reform.|$|E

Later, after I got to the clubhouse, Graig Nettles said I should return to the field and touch home plate, just to make it official.

However, for most contemporary inventors, it hasn't <b>worked</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> The independent inventor today still has an extremely difficult time convincing corporations that he has a product which deserves to be on the market. Most companies have a tremendous resistance to ideas and technology developed on the outside.: You cannot develop a reputation for somebody who gives up. You have to be known as a fighter for your rights. Otherwise, you'll never license anything... Even Thomas Edison had a tough time supporting and protecting his patents.

5000|$|In {{response}} to the controversy, Chi Chi LaRue defended the film {{as a work of}} art, praising Blake Riley's performance and claiming that the film was more authentically bisexual than most bisexual porn.“I would say probably the biggest standout in this movie was Blake Riley, who has never been with a girl in his life. Blake fucks Shy and Brittany, and also fucks the lovely Ms. Amber while also getting fucked by Ryan Alexander’s big dick. Delish! I know all the complaints about bi porn in the past. Fans would always complain about how the sex wasn’t authentically bisexual with just one lesbian scene, one gay scene, one straight scene. Sometimes it <b>worked</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> but this movie is very bisexual. Just wait until you see that huge orgy. Everyone does everything to everyone.

The reason for this expectation came primarily from his paper with Kevin O'Regan: "A sensorimotor account of vision and visual consciousness", and also from his paper with Susan Hurley: "Neural plasticity and consciousness". Both papers, in my view at least, made wonderful contributions to articulating the importance of sensorimotor relations for understanding cognition and consciousness.

The key idea of the book is that perceiving is a way of acting. He starts out with the image of a blind person tapping his cane in a cluttered space, "perceiving that space by touch, not all at once, but through time, by skillful probing and movement. " (p. 1).
