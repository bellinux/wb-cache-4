40|$|Aim: To {{determine}} the various helminth parasites and associated helminth reservoir status of captive <b>wild</b> <b>ruminants</b> in the semi-arid region of north-eastern, Nigeria. Materials and Methods: Faecal samples were examined for nematode ova {{by the simple}} floatation technique using saturated sodium chloride solution as floatation medium. Trematode eggs were examined by the sedementation technique. The modified McMaster technique was used to {{determine the}} intensity of helminth infections among the various species of <b>wild</b> <b>ruminants</b> examined, while larval isolation and identification using the modified Baerman&# 8217;s technique {{was used to determine}} the various species of parasites encountered. Results: Out of the 36 samples examined, a high parasite count due to Strongyle infection without the manifestation of overt clinical signs was observed among the captive <b>wild</b> <b>ruminants.</b> The egg counts ranged from 500 + 10. 0 among the Grimm&# 8217;s duicker (Sylvicaprea grimmia) to 5, 350 + 51. 70 among the Senegal hartebeest (Damaliscus korrigum). The helminth larvae recovered which were common to all the species of <b>wild</b> <b>ruminants</b> were those of Haemonchus contortus, Trichostrogylus axei and Strongyloides papillosus, Demographic data such as age, sex and species of wild animals showed no significant (p> 0. 05) variation on the prevalence of the helminth infections.

The strength of this relationship significantly decreased as red deer (Cervus elaphus) population abundance increased. In addition, BTV RNA was detected by real time RT-PCR in 32 out of 311 (10. 3 %) spleen samples from seropositive animals. Although BT outbreaks in livestock have decreased substantially after vaccination campaigns, our results indicated that wild ruminants have been exposed to BTV in territories where outbreaks in domestic animals occurred.

The aim of this work was to investigate if BVDV can be detected by PCR in fecal samples from <b>wild</b> <b>ruminants</b> and cattle. Fecal samples (n= 60) were collected in 2 bovine farms with a history of seropositivity for BVDV- 1 (A, n= 40; B, n= 20). In addition, faecal samples from red deer (Cervus elaphus, n= 16), Appennine chamois (Rupicapra pyrenaica ornata, n= 13), fallow deer (Dama dama, n= 6), and roe deer (Capreolus capreolus, n= 5) were collected from the environment.

Real time PCR for Pestivirus [2, 3], nested PCR for BVDV [4] and PCR for 5 '- UTR sequencing [5] were carried out.

Our results suggest a complex epidemiology of BTV and underline {{the need for additional}} research on wildlife in Europe. In October 2004, an outbreak of bluetongue caused by bluetongue virus serotype 4 (BTV- 4) occurred in southern Spain (www. oie. int/hs 2 /zi_pays_mald. asp?c_ pays= 58 &c_mald= 10 &annee= 2004). Since then, several BTV- 4 outbreaks have occurred in livestock in Spain. Recently, BTV- 1 emerged in Spain and caused several outbreaks in livestock (www. oie. int/wahid-rod/public. php?page=single_report&pop= 1 &reportid= 5799). In addition, BTV- 8 emerged in central Europe in 2006 (1) (www. oie. int/esp/press/es_ 061023. htm). New outbreaks of BTV- 8 occurred in 2007, and this virus serotype was recently detected in the United Kingdom (www. oie. int/wahid-prod/ public. php?page=disease_immediate_summary). BTV is a vector-borne pathogen; Culicoides species biting midges (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) are its biologic vectors (2). The main BTV vector in Europe is C. imicola (2), a seasonal species that appears from late May to November (3). Other Culicoides species may also be vectors of BTV in Europe (4, 5; www. oie. int/esp/press/es_ 061023. htm).

While clinical disease is thought to occasionally occur, infection in most individuals is likely subclinical and the broader epidemiological role of bison is largely unknown (Vestweber et al. 1991, Ruder et al. in press) ...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the variations of rumen pH and fatty acids (acetic acid, propionic acid, iso-butyric acid, n-butyric acid, iso-valerianic acid, n-valerianic, caproic acid and total fatty acids) in 245 early lactating dairy cows under different temperature and humidity conditions. The animals were divided into six groups and rumen fluid was collected by rumenocentesis on 22 dairy cows in April (GroupA), 33 in May (Group B), 43 in June (Group C), 48 in July (Group D), 36 in September (Group E) and 60 in October (Group F). One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by the Bonferroni's test, showed a significant effect of environmental variations on all studied parameters (P< 0. 0001). Changes in studied parameters can be explained in relation to the microbial population and shift in the optima far rumen conditions associated with variations of environmental conditions. We can affirm that the microbial assemblages that underlie energy and protein supply to <b>wild</b> <b>ruminant</b> are evident especially in relation to temperature and humidity conditions...|$|E
50|$|Chabertia ovina, the large-mouthed bowel worm, is {{a species}} of {{parasitic}} roundworms that infects sheep, goats (occasionally cattle) and other <b>wild</b> <b>ruminants.</b> Infection of pigs are very infrequent. It is not known to be contagious to humans.|$|R
40|$|Our western rangelands {{support a}} wide variety of species {{including}} ruminants that are exquisitely suited to make use of these renewable resources. Domestic ruminants utilizing these rangelands include cattle, domestic sheep, and less frequently, at least in the northern Great Plains and intermountain west, domestic goats. <b>Wild</b> <b>ruminants,</b> in numbers, variety, and quality not found anywhere else in North America, include mule deer, pronghorn, and elk. White-tailed deer frequent the riparian areas, moose are found in low numbers in forest lands, bighorn sheep inhabit rough breaks and the higher altitudes, and free-ranging bison are found around the national parks in Wyoming and Montana. Domestic and <b>wild</b> <b>ruminants</b> have many biological, physiologic, and behavioral similarities, as well as considerable differences. These ruminants consume similar forages, share salt licks and blocks, and seek out the same sources of water in our desert/semi-desert region. Thus {{it is not surprising that}} they may share diseases. The purpose of this paper is to review what we know about some of the diseases that domestic and <b>wild</b> <b>ruminants</b> may exchange and to put the potential for sharing diseases into perspective...|$|R
50|$|Many orbiviruses are {{transmitted}} by ticks or haematophagus insect vectors (Culicoides, mosquitoes and sand flies) {{and have a}} wide host range that includes cattle, goats and sheep, <b>wild</b> <b>ruminants,</b> equids, camelids, marsupials, sloths, bats, birds, large canine and feline carnivores and humans.|$|R
