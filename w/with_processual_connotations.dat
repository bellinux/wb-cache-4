Using the pottery as an indicator, my objective is to analyse similarities and differences in space management, in the site function in the settlement system and in the organization of the production.

40|$|This paper reports four priming {{experiments}}, {{in which}} resultative, processual, and delimitative Russian verbs were tested. The experiments {{were based on}} the semantic decision task: the participants had to decide whether the target denoted an event / situation with a clear outcome. To assess the impact of morphological cues on the decision latencies, verbs of different morphological complexity (prefixed and unprefixed perfectives) were used. The results obtained suggest that the aspectual feature of resultativity is consistently exploited in semantic priming (processual targets were primed in two experiments), and that the morphological cues facilitate the identification of resultative targets (prefixed perfectives exhibited faster decision latencies than unprefixed perfectives). As far as the delimitative forms are concerned, a category-induction experiment was designed to investigate the subjects’ tendency to group them with resultatives or <b>with</b> <b>processuals,</b> since the delimitatives represent an in-between category. The proportion of yes/no answers confirmed that the speakers place the delimitatives between these two domains, but much closer to the processuals than to the resultatives. These findings support the distinction of boundedness vs. telicity from both the theoretical and the behavioural perspective. The fact that the resultative interpretation of the delimitatives was not ruled out completely for most verbs suggests that, when certain conditions are met (when no cognate resultative form is readily available and when the delimitative is frequent enough), the delimitative can be conceptualized as the perfective counterpart of the basic imperfective, thus taking on the prototypical perfective role (resultativity) ...|$|R

40|$|Cabot Square is {{a public}} space in west {{downtown}} Montreal. The Square {{has long been the}} site of controversy, as it is both a neighbourhood park and a gathering place for people experiencing various forms of homelessness and socio-economic marginalization. In 2008, the City of Montreal's Ville-Marie Borough released an urban planning document called the PPU Quartier des Grands Jardins (Arrondissement 2008), which included provisions to revitalize the Square, along with plans to build a set of condominiums across the street, carried out in 2012. The revitalization of the Square was initiated subsequently in 2014. Fieldwork was conducted between 2012 and 2014 in Cabot Square and the surrounding area {{in order to understand the}} ways in which the Square functions as a gathering place, and to learn from the experiences of people who spend time there, as well as the outreach workers and community organizers who support them. Theorizing space and place according to the work of Casey (1997), Massey (1994; 2005), and Ingold (2009; 2011), this thesis tells a story of Cabot Square as a gathering place <b>with</b> <b>processual,</b> relational, and political dimensions. Place is presented as an emergent human experience generated by paths of wayfaring and practices of relationality, and contested by divergent claims to boundaries and belonging. This conceptual frame aligns itself closely with the ways Cabot Square is experienced by those who linger in it, but differs from the view taken by urban planners and city employees who have been involved in the PPU Quartier des Grands Jardins. The argument of this thesis is that different conceptions of place affect the ways spaces are designed, used, regulated, and experienced, and that consideration of the processual, relational, and political aspects of place might inspire more sustainable and equitable urban development projects in the future...|$|R
40|$|The {{selective}} {{pressures and}} processes of cultural heritage management effectively disinherit some interest groups. Where this {{occurs in the}} context of postcolonial or nationalist conflict, the material archaeological record may be referenced to support or reject particular views. The disciplinary assumptions behind the archaeological evidence so produced are not usually contested in judicial contexts. A review of archaeology’s theoretical foundations suggests that this naivety itself may be problematic. A descriptive culture history approach dominated archaeology over {{the first half of the}} twentieth century with a strong political appeal to nationalist politics. Subsequently archaeology became concerned <b>with</b> <b>processual</b> explanation and the scientific identification of universal laws of culture, consistent with postwar technological optimism and conformity. A postprocessual archaeology movement from the 1970 s has promoted relativism and challenged the singular authority of scientific explanation. Archaeologists caught within this debate disagree over the use of the archaeological record in situations of political conflict. Furthermore, the use of archaeology in the sectarian debate over the Ayodhya birthplace of Rama suggests that the material record of the past can become highly politicized and seemingly irresolvable. Archaeological research is also subject to other blatant and subtle political pressures throughout the world, affecting the nature and interpretation of the record. A system that privileges archaeological information values may be irrelevant also to communities who value and manage their ancestral heritage for customary purposes. Collectively this review of theory and applied knowledge suggests that it is unrealistic to expect that archaeology can authoritatively resolve strident claims and debates about the past. Instead, an important contemporary contribution of archaeology may be its potential to document cultural and historical contradictions and inclusions for the consideration of contemporary groups in conflict...|$|R

30|$|Drawing {{upon the}} {{complexity}} theory of complexity absorption and Chinese processual philosophy, this paper proposes a new theoretical model of processual entrepreneurial strategic approaches. The empirical {{findings from the}} study of Chinese entrepreneurial organizations support the notion that timing, context and efficacy as key elements in a complexity absorption approach are strongly evidenced in entrepreneurial strategic practices, which contribute to the success of their businesses in the Chinese market. The paper has both theoretical and practical importance. Theoretically, the paper extends the scope of the literature of entrepreneurial strategy by developing a new model of entrepreneurial strategic approaches <b>with</b> a <b>processual</b> perspective through building up its link to complexity theory and processual philosophy. Practically, the insight gained from this research contributes to enhancing the understanding of entrepreneurial strategic approaches in a complex market like China and helps businesses prepare their mindsets and strategies when they enter or engage in such markets.|$|R
30|$|Second, {{this paper}} {{contributes}} {{to developing a}} new theoretical framework for processual entrepreneurial strategic approaches by bringing the complexity absorption concept into strategy literature.

This {{is based on the assumption}} that if beliefs are aligned with a clear understanding of what works then practice which is directed by our beliefs will become naturally aligned with the reality of the world around us. An ontological understanding of complexity theory is further developed within a unique context which sees this as normative in both philosophy and entrepreneurial strategic practice. The way that the concept of complexity absorption is developed here and paired <b>with</b> the <b>processual</b> approach favored by a complexity perspective contributes to an understanding that entails providing solutions to issues in complex business environments.|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the production and deployment of the digital maps in contemporary computational culture. By bringing together theories from Media Studies, Critical Cartography and Science and Technology Studies (STS) I look at digital maps as interfaces, designed to be implemented on various screens and modes. Building on production-studies informed ethnographies within a major public mapping organization and a smaller private commercial developer, I point out the tendency for such digital maps to be simultaneously ubiquitous in their desire to be available to all users, on all devices while being personalised by implementing various ways of tracking the user. Thus, I suggest the term ‘uniquitous’ to describe such configuration, and tie it to the changing nature of digital media and cartographic practices. Consequently, I offer a new conceptual framework to understand the emerging relations between mapmakers and map-users, which I name ‘casual power’. The framework identifies the ways digital map-makers attempt to embed into their interfaces affordances that reduce user reflexivity, make using the map seamless and enjoyable, and blur the differences between the map and the world it purports to represent. Such maps become naturalized objects in the habitual chains of actions that users perform vis-à-vis the world. Specifically, I have located three conceptual lenses that should be used when examining the inscription process I summarise above. First, I acknowledge that the cartographic illusion of maps changes when maps are transformed for screens. This happens {{due to the nature of}} contemporary media-scapes to operate under the conditions of the attention economy. From a static representation of the world, the animated map becomes a dynamic actor that aims to represent the world in (near) real-time while competing for the increasingly scarce attention of the user. The co-habitation of the map on digital platforms with other objects that actively demand user attention necessitates this, and the economic conditions that commodify such attention through views, clicks, shares and the like promote it further. Second and in conjunction, the digital map can be seen as inherently playful, especially when considering playfulness as an attitude expressed through objects and the view of ‘play as systems’. This is emphasized by the developing form of gameful design, underscoring autotelic engagement with the map rather than its use for a certain purpose. In line <b>with</b> <b>processual</b> and navigational views of cartography, mapping interfaces can thus be designed to be used ‘for fun’ rather than to serve any particular rational goal. Third and following the previous two, this is achieved through the numerical forms of the digital map that both underpin its existence as a data object and are used as interface elements to affect users. In particular, I claim that such modes could be understood by looking into quantifiable interactions within the context of neo-liberalism and the desire for more, as well as a digital design technique grounded in decoupling the understanding of processes grounded in physical world from the perception of the screen...|$|R

The center of this research-creation project is a question: What happens when I improvise? Investigating the question reveals a deep synergy between multiple and complementary modes of inquiry: theoretical reflections, stimulating the development of methodologies, enacted through practices over extended periods of time. These are co-dependent processes, mutually enriching each other through recursive and iterative cycles of inquiry. Improvisation is contextualized through phenomenological accounts, contemporary ideas from the embodied cognition paradigm, and an examination of somatic techniques. The practice is then articulated in the performance through a multiplicity of appearances: experienced through sight, sound, kinaesthetic empathy, words and concepts. Far from contradictory, these multiple points of view contribute {{to a kind of}} experiential synesthesia, leading to a richer appreciation of the phenomenon as a whole...|$|R
40|$|This article {{offers a}} {{critical}} {{exploration of the}} concept of resilience, which is largely conceptualized in the literature as an extraordinary atypical personal ability to revert or ‘bounce back’ to a point of equilibrium despite significant adversity. While resilience has been explored in a range of contexts, there is little recognition of resilience as a social process arising from mundane practices of everyday life and situated in person -environment interactions. Based on an ethnographic study among single refugee women with children in Brisbane, Australia, the women’s stories on navigating everyday tensions and opportunities revealed how resilience was a process operating inter-subjectively in the social spaces connecting them to their environment. Far beyond the simplistic binaries of resilience versus non-resilient, we concern ourselves here <b>with</b> the everyday <b>processual,</b> person environment nature of the concept. We argue that more attention should be paid to day-to-day pathways through which resilience outcomes are achieved, and that this has important implications for refugee mental health practice frameworks...|$|R
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{political}} perspective {{of the process and}} context of strategic leadership, in three top international Business Schools, IMD, INSEAD and London Business School. It remedies three inadequacies in the current literature. These are: first, the scarcity of empirical studies on strategic leadership <b>with</b> a <b>processual</b> perspective, despite the interest demonstrated in theoretical studies on leadership in the last decades, second, the lack of links between the leadership and strategy fields; third, scholars' call for studies on leadership from a political perspective. Longitudinal and comparative case studies were conducted with the purpose of describing the Strategic Leadership Process (SLP) in each and across the three Business Schools, over the period 1990 - 2004, through strategic agenda-building and -executing, in relation to a specific strategic initiative: Becoming a top international Business School. Findings show firstly, that among the three key actors (Board, Dean and Faculty), the Dean is the main key actor in the SLP because of his critical role of building and executing the School's strategic agenda. Secondly, for the Dean to succeed, it is crucial to deliver an inclusive approach with regard to the other key actors' (Board and Faculty) interests and priorities. Thirdly, Performance represents a precondition for the Dean to be credible and receive support from Faculty and Board. Fourthly, for an effective direction-setting, the Dean's capacity to scan and understand the external voice, signals and trends and raise them to the School's strategic agenda is fundamental. Fifthly, the ability to articulate and communicate vision through coalition-building combined with adequate delegation, represent critical competences to raise and execute breakthrough initiatives for the School...|$|R
40|$|Background: Swallowing {{difficulties}} challenge {{patient safety}} {{due to the}} increased risk of malnutrition, dehydration and aspiration pneumonia. A theoretically driven study was undertaken to examine the spread and sustainability of a locally developed innovation that involved using the Inter-Professional Dysphagia Framework to structure education for the workforce. A conceptual framework with 3 spread strategies (hierarchical control, participatory adaptation and facilitated evolution) was blended <b>with</b> a <b>processual</b> approach to sustaining organisational change. The aim {{was to understand the}} processes, mechanism and outcomes associated with the spread and sustainability of this safety initiative. Methods: An instrumental case study, prospectively tracked a dysphagia innovation for 34 months (April 2011 to January 2014) in a large health care organisation in England. A train-the-trainer intervention (as participatory adaptation) was deployed on care pathways for stroke and fractured neck of femur. Data were collected at the organisational and clinical level through interviews (n = 30) and document review. The coding frame combined the <b>processual</b> approach <b>with</b> the spread mechanisms. Pre-determined outcomes included the number of staff trained about dysphagia and impact related to changes in practice. Results: The features and processes associated with hierarchical control and participatory adaptation were identified. Leadership, critical junctures, temporality and making the innovation routine were aspects of hierarchical control. Participatory adaptation was evident on the care pathways through stakeholder responses, workload and resource pressures. Six of the 25 ward based trainers cascaded the dysphagia training. The expected outcomes were achieved when the top-down mandate (hierarchical control) was supplemented by local engagement and support (participatory adaptation). Conclusions: Frameworks for spread and sustainability were combined to create a ‘small theory’ that described the interventions, the processes and desired outcomes a priori. This novel methodological approach confirmed what is known about spread and sustainability, highlighted the particularity of change and offered new insights into the factors associated with hierarchical control and participatory adaptation. The findings illustrate the dualities of organisational change as universal and context specific; as particular and amendable to theoretical generalisation. Appreciating these dualities may contribute to understanding why many innovations fail to become routine...|$|R
40|$|I have {{conducted}} {{seven months of}} fieldwork among participants and employees at Nansen Center for Peace and Dialogue, in Lillehammer, Norway, and have taken part in seminars where dialogue is significant as concept and practice. The interlocutors in this study have background from Afghanistan, Iraqi Kurdistan, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Serbia, Croatia, Macedonia, Kosovo, United States, some living in these respective countries and some in Norway. Most of the interlocutors have experiences with conflict, {{and come to the}} seminars to learn about dialogue techniques, meet people from different sides in a conflict, and to build cooperation between participants, both in diaspora groups in Norway and in their country of origin. This thesis brings forward how knowledge acquired at seminars is understood and applied among interlocutors, and how participating in seminars is experienced. Taking part in seminars is by participants expressed as connecting and becoming like a family. Furthermore, similarity and difference emerged in identification processes among participants during seminars, for instance in different ways of practicing Islam. I argue that the way interlocutors approach practicing dialogue can be looked upon as a meta-perspective on communication. I argue that these ways of talking create internal jargons of understanding between participants, that I call `dialoging´. Since several participants have backgrounds from conflict areas, I moreover explore possibilities for empathy and resonance within processes where dialogue is central. Among interlocutors in this study, change on a personal level has been described like becoming a new person, or having a personal transformation. Moreover, several of the participants want to use what they learn, for instance starting dialogue initiatives in their countries, which underlines a social relevance of the seminars I have studied. Through this empirical study on the significance of dialogue, this thesis aims to fill a knowledge gap in dialogical anthropology, contributing <b>with</b> a <b>processual</b> and relational perspective on how to understand dialogue. Key words: dialogue, training seminar, similarity and difference, conflict, communication processes, personal and social change, empathy, resonance, peacebuilding, peace education...|$|R

40|$|Since the 1960 s, artworks {{that involve}} the {{participation}} of the spectator have received extensive scholarly attention. Yet interactive artworks using digital media still present a challenge for academic art history. In this book, Katja Kwastek argues that the particular aesthetic experience enabled by these new media works can open up new perspectives for our understanding of art and media alike. Kwastek, herself an art historian, offers a set of theoretical and methodological tools that are suitable for understanding and analyzing not only new media art but also other contemporary art forms. Addressing both the theoretician and the practitioner, Kwastek provides an introduction to the history and the terminology of interactive art, a theory of the aesthetics of interaction, and exemplary case studies of interactive media art. Kwastek lays the historical and theoretical groundwork <b>with</b> discussions of <b>processual</b> strategies of twentieth-century art and theories of aesthetic experience, process aesthetics, play, and performance. She then develops an aesthetics of interaction, discussing such aspects as real space and data space, temporal structures, instrumental and phenomenal perspectives, and the relationship between materiality and interpretability. Finally, she applies her theory to specific works of interactive media art, including narratives in virtual and real space, interactive installations, and performance—with case studies of works by Olia Lialina, Susanne Berkenheger, Stefan Schemat, Teri Rueb, Lynn Hershman, Agnes Hegedüs, Tmema, David Rokeby, Sonia Cillari, and Blast Theory.

Thus, the author aim to primarily contribute to the revenue model literature <b>with</b> insights on <b>processual</b> characteristics and activities. Method – The thesis uses an exploratory single case-study approach, based on qualitative data gathered mainly from semi-structured interviews. In total six manufacturing companies and five experts within relevant areas {{were included in the}} study. Data were analyzed through an abductive analysis approach, and a combination of the Gioia Methodology and Thematic coding. Findings – The study’s main findings show that the process when designing revenue models for smart, connected and integrated product-services, is characterized by an iterative phase layout and a strong customer focus. Key activities include pilot project testing, continuous evaluations and an organizational transformation, beginning with some initial analyzes to continue with a stepwise implementation and rollout of a new integrated product-service offer. Research limitations/implications – This study is limited by the single case study approach, and the aim to merely develop theory, not practically test it. The study contributes to the revenue model literature by enhancing knowledge about the processual characteristics when developing revenue models. Also, the processual framework provides structure and guidance for management at mature manufacturing companies. Originality/value – The novel contribution of this study is a processual framework and enhanced knowledge about the design process in the so far scarcely explored area of revenue models for smart, connected and integrated product-services.

40|$|Mishra** India’s rural {{socio-cultural}} scenario was at {{the crossroads}} in the 1960 s {{with the introduction of}} the new agricultural revolution, popularly known as the Green Revolution. One of the protracted debates that ensued during this period was regarding the economic gains and social costs of the Green Revolution. Although agrarian social structure could not retain the central place in the post- 1970 s period, there is no second thought that the technological revolution in agriculture has largely influenced many rural social institutions in India. The present paper is a modest attempt in re-evaluating empirically the bearing of this technological revolution on the socio-cultural scenario, and particularly on the agro-based rural institutions in Orissa. Taking the anthropological techniques like participant observations, interview and case study, the present paper tries to examine the impact of new-agro technology on the traditional inter jati relations, rural family andpower structures in a multi jati village of Bhadrak district in coastal Orissa. The study reveals that while the day-to-day relations between the jajmans and the kamins might have undergone changes this does not imply the erosion of the spirit of reciprocity wrapped with a ritual fervour, which is the characteristic of jajmani relations. It found that the ideology of jajmani as an inter jati exchange relationship continues to hold good in rural India <b>with</b> its usual <b>processual</b> changes in all its permutations and combinations just to adapt itself to the changing socio-economic realities but without rejecting the ideology behind such relations.

The thesis builds on exemplary studies of people in their wardrobes, {{with the aim of}} focusing on theoretical and methodological concerns and implications. It is structured in three parts, each of which consists -­‐ independently -­‐ of its own introductory framing, its own literature review, its own methods chapter, its own field work study, and its own conclusive reflections. As such, the parts, when taken as a whole, represent an evolving process through which my overall research questions are being filtered and reflected. My scholarly approach builds on the fusing of fashion and dress research and design research, in this way closing a gap between dress practice as, on the one hand, symbolic discourse and, on the other, as an embodied practice that is 'physically embedded' in the material capacities of dress objects. In Part I, I frame this view by {{addressing the}} concept of dressing as a 'bodily situated practice', as defined by Entwistle (2000), combined <b>with</b> a <b>processual</b> view on design and everyday practices, as defined by Shove et al. (2008). Based on these perspectives, I contribute with my own explanatory frameworks of 'sartorial systems' and 'sensory anchoring', on which I base the entire thesis. In order to operationalise these frameworks in my field work, I have developed a personal methodology for the wardrobe method that embraces the sensory and temporal aspects of dress practice. In Part II, I filter this through the vehicle of a collaborative project with Danish designer Mads Nørgaard, wherein I observe how dress objects from Nørgaard's collection are appropriated and used in the wardrobes of informants. In this way, I point to discrepancies between the production and the dissemination of dress objects that take place in the fashion industry, and to the ways that people use and experience these objects in their everyday lives. In Part III, I conduct a series of ‘wardrobe sessions’ with informants in collaboration with a designer, in order to explore how use practice might cast reflections back onto design processes. In my concluding chapter, I argue that my thesis contributes with a more facetted and reflected set of thinking in relation to dress practice, and that this way of thinking could potentially bring about radical changes in the way dress objects are currently produced, disseminated and sold. All together, this thesis shows that in order to establish a more tight fit between the production and consumption of dress objects, there is very good reason to look into the dress practices that are taking place in people’s wardrobes...|$|R
40|$|The metaphorical example... of a fertilized egg which differentiates into a {{fully formed}} organism, {{can now be}} made quite literal: the {{progressive}} differentiation of the spherical egg is achieved through a complex cascade of symmetry-breaking phase transitions. Manuel DeLanda (2013, 11) This paper will explore the ontology of song through the Deleuzian philosophies put forward by Manuel DeLanda and Elizabeth Grosz, {{with a focus on}} symmetry breaking and the fractal structure of (embodied) knowledge. Extending a notion I first put forward in What a Body Can Do: Technique as Knowledge, Practice as Research (2015), I argue that embodied research explores relatively reliable potentialities of human practice {{in a way that is}} closely analogous to laboratory research as understood by social and historical epistemologies. DeLanda’s rigorously analytical interpretation of Deleuze will form the basis of my proposal, while Grosz’s more impressionistic discussion in Chaos, Territory, Art (2008) will provide additional background for theorising the functionality of song as (topological) action. While a typology of songs would aim to categorise and order songs as coherent units, a topology of song is concerned <b>with</b> the <b>processual</b> generation of song in time—that is, with defining the phase space of song into which individual songs, song fragments, and song-actions intervene. From this perspective, song is not an “object” in Graham Harman’s speculative sense but more like a Deleuzian “zone of intensity” or what Hans-Jörg Rheinberger calls an “epistemic thing. ” While song as a cultivated organic resource may attain sufficient temporary individuality to be called upon at will, and thereby function as a relatively reliable bodily affordance, this individuality is nothing more than what DeLanda refers to as the virtual topological structure of a multiplicity. Hence, singing is an example of “the actualisation of the virtual in time” and the specific acts of symmetry breaking that we call “songs” are newly enacted each time we begin to sing—just as a natural symmetry returns in every moment of silence. In the case of song, silence is precisely analogous to DeLanda’s undifferentiated topological “egg. ” My presentation will include live vocal performance excerpts drawing on the ongoing embodied research project “Judaica,” which seeks to develop a technique of song-based practice grounded in the coordination of voice, movement, and association in the complete unit of human performance that twentieth-century theatre pioneers Konstantin Stanislavsky and Jerzy Grotowski called “action. ” I will demonstrate how vocal actions may use rhythm, melody, timbre, and other embodied techniques to generate the symmetry-breaking events that we experience as song. I contend that the flexibility of song across these and other dimensions derives from its topological structure, a fact that is routinely concealed by the epistemological dominance of recorded audio tracks and written scores in the study of music. My analysis of song is intended to re-examine and foreground the centrality of embodied technique in human life and to support innovative analyses of embodied practice, which I see as fundamental to the future of artistic research...|$|R
40|$|This study {{evolved from}} an {{involvement}} with professional {{people in a}} rural and semi-rural environment thereby {{taking into account the}} role which the Employee Assistance Programmes (EAP) plays in their professional context of work. Two underlying factors motivate the study. Firstly, that professional needs and capacities of faith, belief and spirituality are not been catered for in the EAPs. Secondly, that an African-Christian wholesome sense making approach provides more satisfactory answers to the lack of faith, belief and spirituality in the EAPs than the modern versions of the classic dualist and tripartite anthropological schemes of soul and body or soul, spirit and body. Furthermore, a wholesome sense making approach supports and tackles people’s wellness and well-being levels more satisfactorily than the classic dualist and tripartite views. An outline of an EAP in which faith leaders and consultants and their programmes are integrated and which contributes to the enhancing of well-being levels and performance management of professional people is described. The main focus of the study revolves around wholesome foursome experiential patterns in which alternating emphases of faith experience are acted out in the sense of ‘I believe God, I believe myself, I believe my human neighbours and I believe the physical natural environment’. This four side pattern of faith experience functions as an important theoretical assumption in the study. A second theoretical assumption has to do <b>with</b> the foursome <b>processual</b> framework of God’s grand acts of creation, reconciliation (redemption= cross and resurrection of Jesus), renewal (ongoing renewal of everything) and consummation and fulfilment towards the end (aim and goal) in which we as people and the physical natural environment are intrinsically and continuously involved. A third theoretical assumption revolves around the foursome experiential professional performance pattern of ‘I perform for God, I perform for myself, I perform for my human neighbours and I perform for the physical natural environment’. The foursome experiential patterns are also set as evaluative pointer patterns around which the empirical investigative part is constructed. Philosophy and Systematic TheologyD. Th.
