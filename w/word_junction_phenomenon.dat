40|$|It {{has been}} {{possible}} to measure the average interfacial velocities of grain boundaries {{during the process of}} recrystallisation of an oxide dispersion-strengthened iron-base alloy manufactured using the mechanical alloying technique. The measurements could be made using optical microscopy because the recrystallised grains are orders of magnitude larger than the surrounding unrecrystallised material. Furthermore, the peculiar way in which the alloy recrystallises, made it possible to observe large, flat segments of boundaries as they advanced into the higher energy matrix. The data have been analysed bearing in mind the pinning effect of the non-random distribution of oxide particles. It is concluded that the boundaries have a high mobility.

40|$|Currently, {{much effort}} {{is being put}} into {{detecting}} unconventional p-wave superconductivity in Josephson junctions based on topological insulators (TIs). For that purpose we propose to use superconducting Klein tunneling, i. e. the reflectionless passage of Cooper pairs through a potential barrier in a gated ballistic <b>junction.</b> This <b>phenomenon</b> occurs {{due to the fact}} that the supercurrent is carried by helical Andreev bound states (ABSs) characterized by spin-momentum locking similar to the normal-state carriers. We derive the spectrum of the helical ABSs and the corresponding Josephson current for a junction made on the surface of a three-dimensional TI. The superconducting Klein tunneling is predicted to yield a non-sinusoidal current-phase relation and an anomalous critical current $I_c$ that does not vanish with increasing barrier strength. We also analyze the dependence of the I_cR_n product (where R_n is the normal-state junction resistance) on the microscopic parameters of the superconductor/TI interface, which leads to lower I_cR_n values than expected from previous models of the proximity-effect Josephson junctions.

50|$|An input logical zero. Note {{that the}} base-collector {{junction}} of the multiple-emitter transistor and the base-emitter junction of the output transistor are in series between {{the bottom of}} the resistor and ground. If one input voltage becomes zero, the corresponding base-emitter junction of the multiple-emitter transistor is in parallel with these two <b>junctions.</b> A <b>phenomenon</b> called current steering means that when two voltage-stable elements with different threshold voltages are connected in parallel, the current flows through the path with the smaller threshold voltage. That is, current flows out of this input and into the zero (low) voltage source. As a result, no current flows through the base of the output transistor, causing it to stop conducting and the output voltage becomes high (logical one). During the transition the input transistor is briefly in its active region; so it draws a large current away {{from the base of the}} output transistor and thus quickly discharges its base. This is a critical advantage of TTL over DTL that speeds up the transition over a diode input structure.|$|R

40|$|Quick Summary is an {{innovate}} {{implementation of}} an automatic document summarizer that inputs a document in the English language and evaluates each sentence. The scanner or evaluator determines criteria {{based on its}} grammatical structure {{and place in the}} paragraph. The program then asks the user to specify the number of sentences the person wishes to highlight. For example should the user ask to have three of the most important sentences, it would highlight the first and most important sentence in green. Commonly this is the sentence containing the conclusion. Then Quick Summary finds the second most important sentence usually called a satellite and highlights it in yellow. This is usually the topic sentence. Then the program finds the third most important sentence and highlights it in red. The implementations of this technology are useful in a society of information overload when a person typically receives 42 emails a day (Microsoft). Another implication is meeting summary information from video for peace officer records and sports broadcasters. The paper also is a candid look at difficulty that machine learning has in textural translating. However, it speaks on how to overcome the obstacles that historically prevented progress.

Relevant articles were analysed to extract conclusions. Results Concomitant pelviureteric junction obstruction (PUJO) and renal lithiasis has been reported only scarcely in the literature. Although PUJO has been extensively studied throughout the years, the presence of calculi in such a patient has not received equal attention {{and there is still}} doubt surrounding the pathophysiology and global management. Conclusions Metabolic risk factors appear to play an important role, enough to justify metabolic evaluation in these patients. Urinary stasis and infection are well known factors predisposing to lithiasis and contribute to some extent. The choice for treatment is not always straightforward.

40|$|Tight {{junctions}} are intercellular junctions {{adjacent to}} the lateral end of the apical membrane. They have two functions: the barrier (or gate) function and the fence function. The barrier function of tight junctions regulates the passage of ions, water, and various macromolecules, even of cancer cells, through paracellular spaces. The barrier function is thus relevant to edema, jaundice, diarrhea and blood-borne metastasis. The blood-brain barrier exclusively depends on this function of tight junctions of endothelial cells. On the other hand, the fence function maintains cell polarity. In other <b>words,</b> tight <b>junctions</b> work as a fence to prevent intermixing of molecules in the apical membrane {{with those in the}} lateral membranes.

This paper was also presented at the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) conference in San Diego, USA, and was awarded the best paper prize. This contribution deals with the complex temperature profiles that are generated by the welding process in the intersection region of thick walled, cylinder-cylinder junctions. These affect material microstructure, mechanical properties and residual stresses.

Reduction of energy loss carried out by addition of Foward Facing Step Turbulator (FFST) in the upstream. Endwall junction area is modeled as a NACA 0015 airfoil and a flat plate. Position of FFST is at a distance L = 2 / 3 C upstream leading edge and a thickness d = 4 C. Free stream conditions Red = 100. 000 with turbulence intensity (Tu) 5. Research is conducted by numerical and experiment methods. Pathlines of numerical result methods has an identic structure with Oil Flow Visualization of the experiment. Result of the research states that the addition of FFST can increase the turbulence intensity in the flow near the wall. So at the same angle of attact (# 945), the saddle point position on the leading edge has distance early the same but a little more towards the lower side and the separation line is wider than without FFST. Because the flow has stronger turbulence intensity, attachment line of the upper and lower sides have a better capability of following the contours of the body.

40|$|Understanding {{failure in}} {{nanomaterials}} {{is critical for}} the design of reliable structural materials and small-scale devices that have components or microstructural elements at the nanometer length scale. No consensus exists on the effect of flaws on fracture in bulk nanostructured materials or in nanostructures. Proposed theories include nanoscale flaw tolerance and maintaining macroscopic fracture relationships at the nanoscale with virtually no experimental support. We explore fracture mechanisms in nanomaterials via nanomechanical experiments on nanostructures with pre-fabricated surface flaws in combination with molecular dynamics simulations. Nanocrystalline Pt cylinders with diameters of ~ 120 nm with intentionally introduced surface notches were created using a template-assisted electroplating method and tested in uniaxial tension in in-situ SEM. Experiments demonstrate that 8 out of 12 samples failed at the notches and that tensile failure strengths were ~ 1. 8 GPa regardless of whether failure occurred at or away from the flaw. These findings suggest that failure location was sensitive to the presence of flaws, while strength was flaw-insensitive. Molecular dynamics simulations support these observations and show that incipient plastic deformation commences via nucleation and motion of dislocations in concert with grain boundary sliding. We postulate that such local plasticity reduces stress concentration ahead of the flaw to levels comparable with the strengths of intrinsic microstructural features like grain boundary triple <b>junctions,</b> a <b>phenomenon</b> unique to nano-scale solids that contain an internal microstructural energy landscape.

40|$|Ten years ago, {{coherent}} oscillations {{between two}} quantum states of a superconducting circuit differing {{by the presence}} or absence of a single Cooper pair on a metallic island were observed for the first time. This result immediately stimulated the development of several other types of superconducting quantum circuits behaving as artificial atoms, thus bridging mesoscopic and atomic physics. Interestingly, none of these circuits fully implements the now almost 30 year old proposal of A. J. Leggett to observe coherent oscillations between two states differing by {{the presence or absence}} of a single fluxon trapped in the superconducting loop interrupted by a Josephson tunnel <b>junction.</b> This <b>phenomenon</b> of reversible quantum tunneling between two classically separable states, known as Macroscopic Quantum Coherence (MQC), is regarded crucial for precision tests of whether macroscopic systems such as circuits fully obey quantum mechanics. In this article, we report the observation of such oscillations with sub-GHz frequency and quality factor larger than 500. We achieved this result with two innovations. First, our ring has an inductance four orders of magnitude larger than that considered by Leggett, combined with a junction in the charging regime, a parameter choice never addressed in previous experiments. Second, readout is performed with a novel dispersive scheme which eliminates the electromagnetic relaxation process induced by the measurement circuit (Purcell effect). Moreover, the reset of the system to its ground state is naturally built into this scheme, working even if the transition energy is smaller than that of temperature fluctuations. As we argue, the MQC transition could therefore be, contrary to expectations, the basis of a superconducting qubit of improved coherence and readout fidelity. Comment: 12 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
