5000|$|After leaving Creed in 2000, Marshall {{stated that}} he had taken some time off before he later got back into music. In 2001, he began writing and {{recording}} music with a band he formed called Grand Luxx, featuring his former Mattox Creed band mates, guitarist Dan Bartley and drummer Hardy Mattox. Singer Matt Knabe, who had previously performed in a band called Project Simon, later joined and the newly formed quartet began recording songs. Marshall stated, [...] "I'd say our music is rock, but it's very eclectic, and I think it can reach a wide audience. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of alternative and some hard-rocking guitar riffs too. And Matt brings in some pop flair because his influences were bands in that genre." [...] He also stated that with Grand Luxx, he had [...] "kind of moved to a different role" [...] and did more work on the production side. By July 2001, the band, having played a few shows, had six songs written with initial plans to record an album that fall. Some of Grand Luxx's original songs include [...] "Stagnant" [...] and [...] "Insomniac's Dream." [...] Also during this time, Marshall was in a band called Head Heavy with vocalist Maceo Morris, Dan Bartley and James Thatcher. The band completed a full length recording at Marshall's home studio but it was never formally released to the public.|$|E
5000|$|Brad Keselowski won {{the pole}} {{with a time}} of 27.421 196.929 mph. He said that his [...] "Wurth Ford Fusion has been really good since we unloaded. Very similar to where we were at Kansas - really fast in {{practice}} and really fast in qualifying. But we just need that to stay with us in the race and we didn't get that in Kansas." [...] He also joked that his team will [...] "have the first pit stall and we get to keep it this time. We are really excited about the race Sunday.” Kevin Harvick, who qualified second, said that he practically [...] "ran the same speed in all three rounds there. Didn’t quite have the raw speed in the first round, but this is a racetrack where you want the car to keep going as long as you can. Felt like we had a good start to our race trim practice today and {{going to have a good}} spot to start on Sunday.” Kyle Busch, who qualified third, said that while his team doesn't [...] "need to win...we would love to win. I feel like this is a good opportunity for us to have a really good day and for us to score a victory. We come to every race trying to win and this one’s no different. I hope that Texas will bode well for us and we can score that win. If not, a solid top-five finish is exactly what we need. That’s where we need to be at the end of the day and carry on that momentum and go into Phoenix and hope for another solid day there.” Joey Logano, who qualified fourth, said while he doesn't [...] "think we are bad in race trim...I do think <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of work to do there, so I am anxious to get at that tomorrow and get to work on it and find a little bit more speed for Sunday." [...] Erik Jones, who qualified sixth driving in place of the suspended Matt Kenseth, said that his qualifying run was [...] "a really good effort for us. We made the final round at Kansas as well so it’s cool to make the final round in both our starts. We’ll see where it goes from here, obviously we’ve got a long ways to go yet for Sunday - 500 miles. This definitely helps everybody’s confidence a little bit for that.” Martin Truex, Jr., who qualified 23rd, said that his car [...] "never really clicked in qualifying trim today and that's why we're starting in the middle of the pack. But we've been there before and fought our way to the front. As I keep on saying this team never quits. We're always working hard to find the right combination and I am hopeful that our car will perform better in race trim during tomorrow's two practice sessions." ...|$|E
