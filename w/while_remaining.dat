Throughout his leadership of the Maryland Temperance Alliance, Daniel remained a member of the Republican Party, but in 1884 he left to join the small Prohibition Party.|$|E
5|$|Baird was {{the first}} cabinet {{minister}} to support Jim Flaherty's campaign to succeed Mike Harris as Progressive Conservative Party leader in the party's 2002 leadership election.

He was not, but was demoted {{to the position of}} Chief Government Whip <b>while</b> <b>remaining</b> associate minister for Francophone Affairs. His replacement in Social Services was Brenda Elliott, who was from the more centrist wing of the Progressive Conservative Party.|$|E

5|$|Its {{multiplayer}} {{features were}} praised; according to McCaffrey, the co-operative multiplayer mode had enough content {{for a separate}} game. Although he appreciated Spies vs. Mercs' faster pace, he found the mode less innovative than its predecessor.

De Matos wrote {{that it was one}} of the best multiplayer modes he had ever experienced, and the Blacklist version had evolved and modernized <b>while</b> <b>remaining</b> creative. Daniel Bloodworth of GameTrailers praised the game's satisfying co-op design, which tasks players to plan and coordinate strategy.|$|E
