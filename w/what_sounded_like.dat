25|$|The play {{proceeded}} {{without incident}} until the intermission between {{the fourth and}} fifth act, which occurred shortly after 11pm. During this time, the drop curtain was down, hiding the stage, and the orchestra was playing for the intermission. Some attendees in the parquet circle heard <b>what</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> a brawl behind the curtain, shouting by men, and the working of machinery; they could easily hear it above the playing of the orchestra.|$|E
25|$|It {{is alleged}} {{sometime}} around or after 4pm, 19-year-old Dick Rowland, a black shoeshiner employed at a Main Street shine parlor, entered the only elevator {{of the nearby}} Drexel Building, at 319 South Main Street, to use the top-floor restroom, which was restricted to blacks. He encountered Sarah Page, the 17-year-old white elevator operator who was on duty. The two likely knew each other at least by sight, as this building {{was the only one}} nearby with a restroom which Rowland had express permission to use, and the elevator operated by Page {{was the only one in}} the building. A clerk at Renberg's, a clothing store located on the first floor of the Drexel, heard <b>what</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> a woman's scream and saw a young black man rushing from the building. The clerk went to the elevator and found Page in what he said was a distraught state. Thinking she had been assaulted, he summoned the authorities.|$|E

500|$|According to author Andy Gill, by {{starting}} {{his new album}} with <b>what</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> [...] "a demented marching-band... staffed by crazy {{people out of their}} mind on loco-weed", Dylan delivered his biggest shock yet for his former folkie fans. The elaborate puns on getting stoned combine a sense of paranoiac persecution with [...] "nudge-nudge wink-wink bohemian hedonism". Heylin points out that the Old Testament connotations of getting stoned made the Salvation Army-style musical backing seem like a good joke. The enigmatic title came about, Heylin suggests, because Dylan knew a song entitled [...] "everybody must get stoned" [...] would be kept off the airwaves. Heylin links the title to the Book of Proverbs, chapter 27, verse 15: [...] "A continual dropping in a very rainy day and a contentious woman are alike." [...] Released as a single on March 22, 1966, [...] "Rainy Day Women" [...] reached number two on the Billboard singles chart, and number seven in the UK.|$|E
500|$|A fresh {{round of}} {{interest}} in L'Oiseau Blanc began in the 1980s, after freelance writer Gunnar Hansen of Northeast Harbor, Maine, researched and published {{an article in the}} June 1980 issue of Yankee Magazine, titled [...] "The Unfinished Flight of the White Bird". Hansen revealed how Anson Berry (d. 1936), a hermit living near Machias, Maine, claimed late in the afternoon of 9 May 1927 to have heard a sputtering aircraft fly over his isolated camp at Round Lake, Maine. Berry {{had not been able to}} see the aircraft because of fog and low clouds, but had heard <b>what</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> a crash or forced landing in the distance. Reportedly Berry tried to locate the crash site but was unsuccessful Hansen and others did a great deal of research during the 1980s, and located multiple other witnesses who reported memories of the aircraft in a line from Nova Scotia down to eastern Maine on that date.|$|E

5000|$|... "Introduction" [...] {{starts with}} various vocal sounds, then sped-up samples re-edited, then slowed down samples, moving into <b>what</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> the Return Mix and some re-edited {{instrumental}} bits.|$|R
50|$|The song also {{featured}} additional backgrounds, dialogue from <b>what</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> men {{talking on a}} street corner and a baby crying before Hathaway ended the song with frenetic hand claps.|$|R
2500|$|A 2010 audio {{analysis}} of the Strubbe tape by Stuart Allen and Tom Owen, who were described by the Cleveland Plain Dealer as [...] "nationally respected forensic audio experts," [...] concluded that the guardsmen were given an order to fire. It is the only known recording to capture the {{events leading up to}} the shootings. According to the Plain Dealer description of the enhanced recording, a male voice yells [...] "Guard!" [...] Several seconds pass. Then, [...] "All right, prepare to fire!" [...] "Get down!," [...] someone shouts urgently, presumably in the crowd. Finally, [...] "Guard!... followed two seconds later by a long, booming volley of gunshots. The entire spoken sequence lasts 17 seconds. Further {{analysis of}} the audiotape revealed that <b>what</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> four pistol shots and a confrontation occurred approximately 70 seconds before the National Guard opened fire. According to The Plain Dealer, this new analysis raised questions about the role of Terry Norman, a Kent State student who was an FBI informant and known to be carrying a pistol during the disturbance. Alan Canfora said it was premature to reach any conclusions.|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} book Laurents wrote closely {{adhered to}} Romeo and Juliet, but the characters based on Rosaline {{and the parents}} of the doomed lovers were eliminated early on. Later the scenes related to Juliet's faking her death and committing suicide also were deleted. Language posed a problem; four-letter curse words were uncommon in the theater at the time, and slang expressions were avoided for fear they would be dated by the time the production opened. Laurents ultimately invented <b>what</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> real street talk but actually was not: [...] "cut the frabba-jabba", for example. Sondheim converted long passages of dialogue, and sometimes just a simple phrase like [...] "A boy like that would kill your brother", into lyrics. With the help of Oscar Hammerstein, Laurents convinced Bernstein and Sondheim to move [...] "One Hand, One Heart", which he considered too pristine for the balcony scene, to the scene set in the bridal shop, and as a result [...] "Tonight" [...] was written to replace it. Laurents felt that the building tension needed to be alleviated in order to increase the impact of the play's tragic outcome, so comic relief in the form of Officer Krupke was added to the second act. He was outvoted on other issues: he felt the lyrics to [...] "America" [...] and [...] "I Feel Pretty" [...] were too witty for the characters singing them, but they stayed in the score and proved to be audience favorites. Another song, [...] "Kid Stuff", was added and quickly removed during the Washington, D.C. tryout when Laurents convinced the others it was helping tip the balance of the show into typical musical comedy.|$|E

50|$|<b>What</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> a honking {{saxophone}} {{line at the}} end of ”Equator”, is in fact a mellotron {{played by}} Ron Mael; the seductive whispers on the track are delivered by a speeded-up Russell Mael.|$|R
50|$|Phonologic {{programming}} deficit syndrome. The child {{speaks in}} long but poorly intelligible utterances, producing <b>what</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> jargon.

60|$|There broke {{upon their}} ear a hoarse {{screaming}} as of things protesting and clamouring in sudden pain; and then, far off like an echo, <b>what</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> a long nasal trumpet.|$|E
60|$|Further {{speculation}} as to {{the fate}} of their foes was checked very suddenly by <b>what</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> the groaning of a human being in deepest distress, coming from one corner of the room in which they were seated.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{sound was}} repeated. Without knowing what I did, I turned. I heard <b>what</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> words; I {{saw in the}} fog the stern of a vessel, with a man above it, {{shouting}} to me through a speaking-trumpet.|$|E
5000|$|The opening track, [...] "And the Cradle Will Rock...", {{begins with}} <b>what</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> a guitar, but is, in fact, a phase shifter-effected Wurlitzer {{electric}} piano played through Van Halen's 1960s model 100-watt Marshall Plexi amplifier.|$|R

60|$|Having {{repeated}} to Snip {{that which}} was in his mind, the boy was {{on the point of}} making himself ready for a visit from the dream elves when he heard, apparently from the room below, <b>what</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> a fall, a smothered exclamation, and the splintering of glass.|$|E
60|$|Anteek {{was first}} to catch sight of it, and point it out to his companion, who did not speak, but let out his lash and urged the dogs on. As they approached, the object was seen to move, then there came towards them <b>what</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> a {{prolonged}} melancholy howl.|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{thought it}} strange that, feeling much {{interested}} in you, I should start at <b>what</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> a proposal to bring you {{into contact with the}} murdered man who lies in his grave. I might have known--of course in a moment should have known--that it could not have that meaning. But my interest remains.' ...|$|E
5000|$|Record {{producer}} Rick Rubin has remarked, [...] "This is a funk jam {{with really}} interesting, jazzy chords. It's {{one of their}} more compact feeling songs. And it's the only Zep song to use <b>what</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> a cowbell." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are telling}} the truth now, at any rate," [...] she remarked, curtly, [...] "or <b>what</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> the truth. Why did you trouble in the matter at all? Where I have failed you {{are not likely to}} succeed." ...|$|R

60|$|When Unc' Billy Possum {{first heard}} <b>what</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> {{the voice of}} Sticky-toes the Tree Toad, he had thought, just as Peter Rabbit did, that Sticky-toes was over in an alder tree {{on the other side}} of the Laughing Brook. But when he heard a whisper right over their heads and looked up to see Sticky-toes himself, Unc' Billy almost chuckled out loud.|$|E
60|$|Tom Poppins lumbered {{up from a}} couch of terrifically new and red leather, and Mr. Wrenn was {{introduced}} to the five new people in the room with dismaying swiftness. There seemed to be fifty times five unapproachable and magnificent strangers from whom he wanted to flee. Of them all he was sure of only two--a Miss Nelly somebody and <b>what</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> Horatio Hood Tem (Teddem it was).|$|E

They gazed at the captives, and uttered <b>what</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> loud hurrahs or shouts; but after listening to Hassan, Lanty turned round trembling. 'The miserables! Some are for sacrificing us outright on the spot, but this decent man declares that he will make them sensible that their prophet was not out-and-out as bad as that. Never you fear, Mademoiselle.' ...|$|E
50|$|Slurrup is full {{of strange}} {{instrumental}} interludes and surreal yet humorous sound collages.

50|$|The sample {{interpolated}} of <b>what</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> a woman {{having an}} orgasm {{is in fact}} that of actress Lorna Patterson from the 1980 movie Airplane!, when her character Randy is crying to Dr. Rumack (Leslie Nielsen) that she's 26 and never been married.|$|R
5000|$|In Part C, the {{listener}} {{is taken to}} <b>what</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> a campfire vignette before being interrupted by a Native American rain dance followed by thunder and rain. The wordless vocal lines {{are similar to the}} [...] "Fire" [...] music from Smile.|$|R
