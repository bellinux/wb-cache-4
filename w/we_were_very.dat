500|$|The International Herald Tribunes Mike Zwerin {{noted the}} band's style of having [...] "four lead singers, four {{potential}} front men"—Imaginates strength {{was in their}} collective sound, argued Zwerin. On Garage Mahal, Taxiride had three active singer-songwriters, with their strong opinions on musical content clashing frequently. Singh told Dan Grunebaum of Metropolis Tokyo that the arguments came about [...] "because <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>very</b> passionate about what goes down onto tape", {{and so they were}} resolved by recognising the overall goal of the band's work.|$|E
500|$|Geologists at the United States Geological Survey and Uniform California Earthquake Rupture Forecast {{suggest that}} an {{earthquake}} with a magnitude of 6.7 or larger will almost definitely occur {{somewhere in the}} state within the next 30 years.

[...] <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>very</b> fortunate {{that there were no}} serious injuries or property damage." [...] Additionally, registration for the Great Southern California ShakeOut, a regional earthquake drill scheduled to occur on Nov. 13, 2008, increased significantly {{in the aftermath of the}} earthquake.|$|E

[...] King countered that [...] "if you're {{inferring}} {{that what we}} did was luck, I don't agree with you sir because I think we weren't lucky, we were just bloody good." [...] Vasey replied that what he meant was that he, Vasey, was lucky. He confided to Herring that he felt that he had made a potentially disastrous mistake: [...] "it is quite wrong to send out a small unit like the 2/6th Independent Company so far that they cannot be supported." ...|$|E

500|$|... "The End of All Things" [...] began a four-week {{break for}} the series, though the {{producers}} initially thought this gap would commence with the following episode. They were pleased that the switch did not cause issues, with Pinkner noting that [...] "we’re sort of in a zone of episodes where each one is amazing and each one either turns the story or resolves something important or there’s a cliffhanger– several episodes where each one is pretty awesome in itself and {{is also important to}} the overall patchwork of the season. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>very</b> happy this ended up being one before we went on a little break. I think the fans are going to be well satisfied to come back and watch the next one as well." ...|$|E
500|$|Likewise {{the first}} film, {{the film was}} shot in and around Vancouver Island. [...] "We know the arena, we know the people up there and let's be honest, there’s an {{enormous}} economic incentive to shoot there. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>very</b> fortunate to get [...] Justis Greene, who’s been working as a line producer up there for 30 years and {{who was able to}} get us the best crew working in town right now. It was advantageous to us on so many levels, that it was just the right place to go for this movie," [...] Perry stated as the reason for the film's production in British Columbia. British Columbia Highway 19 was utilized as Route 23. The Plaza of Nations was used as a stand-in for Ellis Medical Complex, the site of Tim's death.|$|E
500|$|Lee Tamahori {{was hired}} to direct Die Another Day; Barbara Broccoli admired his film Once Were Warriors, calling it [...] "a phenomenal piece of filmmaking".

Screenwriters Neal Purvis and Robert Wade {{returned}} and began work {{in the summer of}} 2000 with the producers. They used a premise from Fleming's novel Moonraker as a basis, that of an industrialist villain who had two identities. With the planned release of the film being in the 40th anniversary year of the Bond film series, Tamahori named the Hong Kong hotel seen in the film the [...] "Rubyeon Royale", for Eon's ruby anniversary, as well as Fleming's first novel, Casino Royale.|$|E

500|$|A lyrics {{video for}} the song was {{uploaded}} onto Muñiz's YouTube channel on 21 April 2017, showing [...] "some very summery scenes". The release of the official music video followed on 17 May 2017 on the same platform, but was not made available to watch until 26 May 2017. It was directed by Manuel Escalante of Enjambre Producciones in different locations in Mexico City and Barcelona, with production and photography handled by him along with Petter Lettocha and José Casillas. When interviewed, Muñiz expained {{the concept of the}} visual, [...] " [...] <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>very</b> moved by {{the idea of having a}} story of a long-distance virtual and sentimental relationship that is carried out through virtual reality: one in Mexico and the other one in Barcelona. Everything begins [...] when I invariably connect with my partner (Alexandra Stan) through a virtual reality system in which we live a super romance and where we see each other in different locations in Mexico City and Barcelona." ...|$|E
500|$|The Coens have {{acknowledged}} several cinematic inspirations for Barton Fink. Chief {{among these are}} three movies by Polish-French filmmaker Roman Polanski: Repulsion (1965), Cul-de-Sac (1966), and The Tenant (1976). These movies employ a mood of psychological uncertainty coupled with eerie environments that compound the mental instability of the characters. Barton's isolation in his room at the Hotel Earle is frequently {{compared to that of}} Trelkovsky in his apartment in The Tenant. Ethan said regarding the genre of Barton Fink: [...] "t is kind of a Polanski movie. It is closer to that than anything else." [...] By coincidence, Polanski {{was the head of the}} jury at the Cannes Film Festival in 1991, where Barton Fink premiered. This created an awkward situation. [...] "Obviously", Joel Coen said later, [...] "we have been influenced by his films, but at this time <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>very</b> hesitant to speak to him about it because we did not want to give the impression we were sucking up".|$|E
500|$|Observers {{described}} Nancy and Ronald's {{relationship as}} intimate. As President and First Lady, the Reagans {{were reported to}} display their affection frequently, with one press secretary noting, [...] "They never took each other for granted. They never stopped courting." [...] Ronald often called Nancy [...] "Mommy"; she called him [...] "Ronnie". While the President was recuperating in the hospital after the 1981 assassination attempt, Nancy wrote in her diary, [...] "Nothing can happen to my Ronnie. My life would be over." [...] In a letter to Nancy, Ronald wrote, [...] "whatever I treasure and enjoy... all would be without meaning if I didn't have you." [...] When her husband was afflicted with Alzheimer's disease In 1998, Nancy told Vanity Fair, [...] "Our relationship is very special. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>very</b> much in love and still are. When I say my life began with Ronnie, well, it's true. It did. I can't imagine life without him." [...] Nancy was known for the focused and attentive look, termed [...] "the Gaze", that she fastened upon her husband during his speeches and appearances.|$|E

500|$|Quentin Tarantino was {{originally}} intended to direct this episode, but was stopped from doing so by the Directors Guild of America. [...] Although the episode was written specifically for Tarantino to direct, the DGA complained that Tarantino, {{who is not a}} member, failed to join the union after working on ER as a director, per an agreement between the two entities. A spokeswoman from 20th Century Fox later noted, [...] "Quentin approached us, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>very</b> excited at the opportunity. We made some special arrangements, and we're disappointed that it's not happening. But we bow to Quentin's philosophical stance [...] we hope something can be worked out for the future." [...] The episode's air date was flipped with the episode [...] "Leonard Betts" [...] {{in order to ensure that}} the latter episode, which featured the show's two stars in their traditional roles, aired after the Super Bowl. Anderson has said that she would have played the part differently had she been aware of this at the time, as Scully discovers she has cancer at the end of [...] "Leonard Betts".|$|E
500|$|After {{being placed}} in {{detention}} together, Lana and Sky came {{to know each other}} better. They gradually formed a bond, and Lana developed feelings for Sky. Lana's crush on Sky eventually culminated in Neighbours first lesbian kiss. The episode featuring the kiss was broadcast in its usual 6.30pm G-rated timeslot. The executive producer of Neighbours, Ric Pellizzeri, said the storyline reflected reality and continued the show's move toward more contemporary issues. Pellizzeri explained that Neighbours was simply telling [...] "a story about tolerance." [...] The producer added that the kiss was as far as they would go, but the writers would not be discouraged from telling other stories about homosexuality in the future. On-screen, Sky told Lana that she was only interested in her boyfriend, but they remained friends. With her main storyline completed, Lana was seen attending the prom with a female admirer, before moving to Canada with her family. Script producer Luke Devenish told a reporter for the Sydney Star Observer, [...] "There is that great tradition that the lesbian is always dead in the final scene, and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>very</b> aware of that as we were writing her out. We wanted to avoid that at all costs." ...|$|E
500|$|Observers {{described}} the Reagans' relationship as close, authentic and intimate. During his presidency they {{were reported to}} frequently display their affection for one another; one press secretary said, [...] "They never took each other for granted.

[...] He once wrote to her, [...] "Whatever I treasure and enjoy... all would be without meaning if I didn't have you." [...] When {{he was in the}} hospital in 1981 after an assassination attempt, she slept with one of his shirts to be comforted by his scent. In a letter to the American people in 1994, Reagan wrote [...] "I have recently been told that I am one of the millions of Americans who will be afflicted with Alzheimer's disease... I only wish there was some way I could spare Nancy from this painful experience," [...] and in 1998, while he was stricken by Alzheimer's, Nancy told Vanity Fair, [...] "Our relationship is very special. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>very</b> much in love and still are. When I say my life began with Ronnie, well, it's true. It did. I can't imagine life without him." [...] Nancy Reagan died on March 6, 2016 at the age of 94.|$|E

500|$|Pamela's {{marriage}} to Bobby Ewing {{is central to}} understanding her character. The couple produced the opening scene of Dallas when the show first aired in 1978, with Bobby bringing his new bride home to meet Jock and Miss Ellie Ewing. [...] Their complex relationship has often been {{compared to that of}} Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. When asked about whether or not series creator David Jacobs had this parallel relationship in mind from the start, he said: [...] "Yes, guilty (laughs)". Relations can be made from William Shakespeare's two feuding families in Romeo and Juliet, the Montagues and the Capulets. These families represent the Barnes and the Ewing feuding families, with Pamela being portrayed as Juliet Capulet and Bobby as Romeo Montague. According to Patrick Duffy, being immediately paired off with Principal was a challenge. He said, [...] "We were {{in a constant state of}} competition. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>very</b> territorial in front of the camera, and it was a strain." [...] However, their off-screen relationship significantly improved in the show's third season, with Duffy explaining: [...] "I developed an appreciation for her, and I think for the first time she started to trust me. Some of the best scenes on the show were between Victoria and me, and they happened after we got comfortable with each other." ...|$|E
500|$|Recording {{sessions}} {{began in}} September 1995, and {{took place at}} the CTS Studios in London, with Madonna and co-actors Antonio Banderas and Jonathan Pryce. Engineer David Reitzas performed the mixing of the track at Larrabee North Studios, utilizing their Solid State Logic 9000 J series consoles for the mix. For the first day's sessions, music supervisor David Caddick suggested to record [...] "Don't Cry for Me Argentina" [...] with the 84 piece orchestra backing Madonna's vocals. However, Lloyd Webber was critical of [...] the recording arrangements done in the studio. The cast was also nervous. Flick noted that Banderas found the experience [...] "scary" [...] while Madonna was [...] "petrified" [...] when it came to recording the songs. [...] "I had to sing 'Don't Cry For Me Argentina' in front of Andrew Lloyd Webber... I was a complete mess and was sobbing afterwards. I thought I had done a terrible job", the singer recalled. Conductor John Mauceri remembered another challenge the production faced was adapting the stage numbers into a feature film; [...] "On film, it's different than being on stage because the person on the screen in front of you is never farther than someone on the pillow in bed next to you". Parker declared the first day of recording as [...] "Black Monday", since it was [...] "filled with trepidation and nerves... All of us came from very different worlds—from popular music, from movies, and from musical theater—and so <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>very</b> apprehensive".|$|E
500|$|A minute's {{silence was}} {{observed}} before kick-off {{in memory of}} Spagnolo; as is tradition in Italian football, the Milanese supporters clapped throughout to pay their respect. The game itself was lacklustre and {{was described as a}} [...] "training match," [...] lacking in [...] "fervour and commitment" [...] by The Times football correspondent Rob Hughes. There were few clear-cut chances created by both teams, and neither managed to score over the 90 minutes. Both however looked assured defending; Milan triggered the offside trap on several occasions, while Arsenal were boosted by club captain Tony Adams playing his first full match in two months. Manager George Graham assessed afterwards: [...] "It was back to the Arsenal of old. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>very</b> solid." [...] Glenn Moore, of The Independent felt Milan would have won had they finished better, noting Dejan Savićević's tame volley in the 75th minute. Marco Simone twice hit the ball wide, while a free-kick from Albertini forced Arsenal goalkeeper David Seaman to action. The home side's best chance came from Wright in the 36th minute. He picked up the ball from Arsenal's half and proceeded to run, evading the challenges of several Milan players. His shot at goal was smartly saved by Sebastiano Rossi. Further chances went to Hartson, who headed from a Stefan Schwarz's corner, and Steve Bould, before Campbell broke forward and had his effort blocked by the Milan goalkeeper.|$|E
