5|$|As {{you long}} ago wrote me, {{and told me}} personally, nay predicted, Jackson has thrown me overboard; he is not only unwilling to give me employment, as he promised after I {{declined}} a reelection to Congress, but has in every single instance refused office to my friends, and even respectful consideration to my letters of recommendation to others. Nor does he stop here. I am at this moment enduring the whole weight of the opposition to him, his friends, and the power and patronage of his government to break down myself and my friends in Virginia, and to prevent my reelection to the office I now fill. Without having much reputation for political matters, I have read those folks at Washington thoroughly... I am not of a temper to pocket insult, neglect, or injury. I have, my dear friend, determined on my course. I can be as silent and patient as any of my aboriginal ancestors, and like them I feel that vengeance would be sweet, but <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> of retribution shall come, it will be marked by {{the effects of the}} tomahawk. You must know that notwithstanding all efforts to prevent it I calculate on a reelection. Then I will begin to formulate a message in which, as you know, my own principles will be maintained.|$|E

5|$|Mike Walsh {{was worried}} about filming the moment when a beam breaks inside the Luthor mansion, from the wind {{generated}} by the storm, and lands on top of Lionel. His crew already knew which beam was going to fall, {{but they did not}} know where to cut the beam because they were not sure how Beeman intended to shoot the scene. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> of shooting came around everything worked out well. They used a stunt double for the initial impact of the beam, and then John Glover stepped back into the scene and fell down with the beam on top of him. The wind effects also created potential danger for the cast and crew. As Eric Johnson recalls, even the smallest piece of debris flying around at such high speeds can cause damage. Annette O’Toole had a similar experience for her scenes in the storm cellar. When Jonathan races into the storm after Nixon, the special effects crew used one of their jet fans and some dry leaves to simulate the winds that were coming from outside; the dry leaves were smacking O’Toole in the face, smothering her.|$|E

25|$|When the United States became {{involved}} in World War II, many families of Japanese descent were moved from San Diego and other West Coast cities to internment camps in Arizona and other inland locations.

Eventually, Zeus was forced to intervene by striking the runaway chariot and Phaeton with a lightning bolt {{to put an end to}} its rampage and Phaeton plunged into the River Eridanos.|$|E

500|$|Early traditions {{supporting}} a literal interpretation are transmitted on {{the authority of}} companions of Muhammad such as Ibn Abbas, Anas bin Malik, Abdullah bin Masud and others. According to the Indian Muslim scholar Abdullah Yusuf Ali, the moon will split again <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> of judgment approaches. He says that the verses may also have an allegorical meaning, i.e. the matter has become clear as the moon. The Qur'anic verses [...] {{was part of the}} debate between medieval Muslim theologians and Muslim philosophers over the issue of the inviolability of heavenly bodies. In 2010 a NASA Lunar Science Institute (NLSI) staff scientist named Brad Bailey said, [...] "No current scientific evidence reports that the Moon was split into two (or more) parts and then reassembled at any point in the past." ...|$|E
500|$|Al-Zamakhshari, {{a famous}} {{commentator}} of the Qur'an, acknowledged the splitting {{of the moon}} as one of Muhammad's miracles. But he also suggested that the splitting might take place only {{on the day of}} judgment. The Muslim scholar Yusuf Ali provides three different interpretations of the verse. He holds that perhaps all three are applicable to the verse: Moon once appeared cleft asunder at the time of Muhammad in order to convince the unbelievers. It will split again <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> of judgment approaches (here the prophetic past tense is taken to indicate the future). Yusuf Ali connects this incident with the disruption of the solar system mentioned in [...] Lastly, he says that the verses can be metaphorical, meaning that the matter has become clear as the moon.|$|E
