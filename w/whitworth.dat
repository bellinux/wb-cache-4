5|$|When first {{exhibited}} in 1832, The Destroying Angel was widely praised for its technical brilliance, but critics were {{divided on the}} subject matter. Some praised its vividness and ability to mix fear and beauty without lowering into tastelessness; others criticised its thematic matter as inappropriate, and chastised Etty for wasting his talents. The painting changed {{the manner in which}} art critics viewed the artist; some saw it as indicating previously unseen character depths, others considered it a renunciation of his previous works. In 1854 Henry Payne, who had commissioned the painting, sold it to Sir Joseph <b>Whitworth.</b> <b>Whitworth</b> donated it in 1882 to the Manchester Art Gallery, where it remains.|$|E
5|$|As St. Albyn had warned, Shiffner was not {{returned}} as a Member; instead, Lord Egremont, a local landowner, offered considerable {{financial support to}} his own candidate, Daniel Boone, while one of the incumbent MPs, Charles <b>Whitworth,</b> offered to sell parts of his estate to loyal supporters. An intervention from the Duke of Newcastle, at Egremont's request, led to Boone and <b>Whitworth</b> forming an alliance against Fownes Luttrell. Shiffner petitioned Parliament and was supported by an angered Fownes Luttrell, but Egremont and Fownes Luttrell eventually agreed a truce and by 1757 had agreed to return a member each and oppose any third candidates. Reluctant to stand himself, Fownes Luttrell supported Shiffner again. The pair would spend seven years dealing with the estate and consolidating his interest there; this, coupled with his arrangement with Egremont, meant that Shiffner was duly returned in 1761, alongside the first Earl of Thomond, brother of Egremont, beating an outsider, the Earl of Clanbrassill. During this Parliament, Fownes Luttrell entertained voters at Dunster Castle and in the village, where he laid on expensive feasts.|$|E

Whilst on leave in Australia in 1929, Koch met with Lieutenant Colonel Horace Brinsmead, Controller of Civil Aviation, who advised him to gain experience on larger aircraft.

Koch was also allowed to convert to the Vickers Vimy at No. 216 Squadron, and flew as second pilot on Vickers Victoria aircraft. He returned to Australia at the end of 1930, arriving in Melbourne on 15 December. In Egypt, Koch had continued his interest in rifle shooting and photography.|$|E

500|$|Shortly after departing German waters on 7 April, Lütjens′ {{force was}} {{attacked}} by British bombers which did no damage to the squadron. On 8 April, Admiral Hipper and the German destroyers were dispatched to Narvik while the German capital ships headed north for a diversionary manoeuver into the North Atlantic. As Admiral Hipper left, she met and engaged the British destroyer [...] which had become separated from Admiral <b>Whitworth′s</b> main force. Though Vizeadmiral Lütjens—and the two German battleships—was nearby, their assistance was deemed unnecessary, and Admiral Hipper sank Glowworm, though taking some damage in return. <b>Whitworth′s</b> main force then {{caught sight of the}} Scharnhorst and Gneisenau at 03:30 on 9 April and moved to engage the battleships.|$|R
5|$|Furious {{was laid}} down on 8 June 1915 at Armstrong <b>Whitworth's</b> Low Walker {{shipyard}} in Newcastle upon Tyne. The ship was launched on 18 August 1916 and commissioned on 26 June 1917. As completed, her complement numbered 737 officers and enlisted men.|$|R
50|$|Despite the Royal Navy {{winning a}} minor {{tactical}} {{victory over the}} Kriegsmarine, the Germans considered the engagement a strategic success {{due to the fact}} that <b>Whitworth′s</b> force was delayed long enough to keep it from interfering with the landings at Narvik. After the action had ended, <b>Whitworth′s</b> force continued to search for the German capital ships. With the British squadron occupied, the German destroyer-transports managed to make their way through to Narvik after destroying two Norwegian coastal defence ships in their path. After their engagement with Renown, the German battleships linked up with Admiral Hipper on the 11th near Trondheim. From there, they returned to Germany, reaching Wilhelmshaven on 12 April where the battle and weather damage to Scharnhorst and Gneisenau was repaired.|$|R
