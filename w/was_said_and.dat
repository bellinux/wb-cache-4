5|$|In Waters v. Churchill (1994), the Court {{was faced}} with two differing {{accounts}} of the speech at issue. The question presented to the Court was whether the Connick test ought be applied to what the employer thought was said or what was actually said. The case revolved around a nurse dismissed for a conversation she had with a coworker. There was a discrepancy between what she argued <b>was</b> <b>said</b> <b>and</b> what her employer thought was said. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, joined by a plurality of justices, opined that the Connick test must {{be applied to the}} speech the employer thought occurred, and on which it acted, rather than that which the finder of fact determines did occur.|$|E

25|$|With the NHL {{preparing}} for looming labor unrest, the Flyers let their leading scorer, Mark Recchi, leave for Pittsburgh during the off-season. Unsure about the future, the Flyers were unsure about his worth. The NHL lockout forced {{the cancellation of}} the 2004–05 NHL season. The Flyers {{were one of the}} more active teams once the NHL lockout came to an end. Replacing the high-profile names of Amonte, LeClair and Roenick were superstar Peter Forsberg, along with defensemen Derian Hatcher and Mike Rathje, as well as several players from the Calder Cup-winning Philadelphia Phantoms.

Zimmerman denies that he told Izetbegovic that if he withdrew his signature, the United States would grant recognition to Bosnia as an independent state. What is indisputable is that Izetbegovic, that same day, withdrew his signature and renounced the agreement.|$|E

25|$|Ghulam Ahmad went to Delhi, {{which was}} at the time {{considered}} a centre of religious learning and home to many prominent religious leaders, in 1891, with the intention of distinguishing what he believed to be the truth from falsehood. He published an advertisement in which he invited the scholars to accept his claim and to engage in a public debate with him regarding {{the life and death of}} Isa (Jesus), particularly Maulana Syed Nazeer Husain (1805–1901), who was a leading religious scholar.

25|$|On {{the final}} day of the regular season, the AL East was still up for grabs with both the Rays and New York Yankees tied for first place.

In September and October combined, the Rays split 30 games, going 15–15.

500|$|The Atlus {{version was}} {{directed}} by Kouji Okada, while the scenario's original elements were written by Kazunari Suzuki. Sprite and promotional artwork was designed by Esaki Minoru, and the music was composed by Tsukasa Masuko. During the early phases, the gameplay concept was a near-copy of the gameplay style of the Wizardry series, attributed by Suzuki to their superiors being fans of the series. Suzuki insisted on the inclusion of some new feature which would distinguish it from Wizardry. This resulted {{in the creation of}} the demon negotiation system. Okada later stated that demon negotiation was decided upon from an early stage. Speaking later about the first-person exploration, Okada was highly critical, feeling that after all their efforts [...] "All we had left after everything <b>was</b> <b>said</b> <b>and</b> done were lots and lots of long, winding dungeons!". Storage space on the cartridge was a recurring concern for the team, with Suzuki using unspecified programming tricks to include high-quality sprite graphics. Due to the rules of the gaming industry at the time, the teams and studios either went uncredited or had pseudonyms, with Masuko being credited as [...] "Project Satan".|$|E
500|$|MTV's Kevin P. Sullivan {{summarized}} the episode as follows: [...] "When all <b>was</b> <b>said</b> <b>and</b> done, {{it was another}} tribute episode, something that can't be uttered by a Glee fan without a sigh and an eye roll." [...] Bell noted that tribute episodes usually mean that [...] "all sense of plot continuity" [...] is forgone, but that this one ranked [...] "at the top {{of all of the}} other Glee tribute episodes because even though it was absurd at times, at least there was a plot—and it kind of made sense". Futterman was more complimentary and described it as the [...] "most effortless tribute episode yet", and Canning wrote that [...] "with songs we know and love and storylines that actually connected and delivered some meaningful and moving moments" [...] it was [...] "more than just a theme episode". Jen Chaney of The Washington Post, however, thought that it was very much like previous tributes in that it also [...] "featured scattered plot lines engineered to include as many songs by said artists as possible" [...] and also [...] "glorified their respective pop stars’ images to an absurd degree". The A.V. Club Todd VanDerWerff also noted the glorification of Jackson, and noted [...] "every time the show turns into an episode about Michael Jackson, it stops dead in its tracks entirely". He stated that what was [...] "weird" [...] about the episode was that [...] "what didn’t work was the spectacle, while what did work were the smaller, character-based stories" [...] which [...] "provided a spine some of the other spectacle-oriented episodes have lacked". Futterman was one of many reviewers who took note of a new feature of this tribute episode when she commented on the [...] "initial whiff of product placement and forced timing" [...] related to the [...] "Immortal World Tour" [...] dialogue. Rae Votta of Billboard thought the inclusion a [...] "brilliant bit of marketing synergy", but TVLine Michael Slezak called it [...] "ridiculously unsubtle product-placement".|$|E

2500|$|Some {{critics have}} blamed Star Wars, {{as well as}} Jaws, for ruining Hollywood by {{shifting}} its focus from [...] "sophisticated" [...] films such as The Godfather, Taxi Driver, and Annie Hall to films about spectacle and juvenile fantasy. One such critic, Peter Biskind, complained, [...] "When all <b>was</b> <b>said</b> <b>and</b> done, Lucas and Spielberg returned the 1970s audience, grown sophisticated on a diet of European and New Hollywood films, to the simplicities of the pre-1960s Golden Age of movies... They marched backward through the looking-glass." [...] In an opposing view, Tom Shone wrote that through Star Wars and Jaws, Lucas and Spielberg [...] "didn't betray cinema at all: they plugged {{it back into the}} grid, returning the medium to its roots as a carnival sideshow, a magic act, one big special effect", which was [...] "a kind of rebirth".|$|E
2500|$|General {{reaction}} to the verdict was one of shock and amazement.

[...] A misunderstanding of the jury instructions may have also {{played a role in the}} verdict. [...] The jury's understanding of the instructions was that they were required to find all of defendants guilty in order to convict and as they could not agree that all eight were involved they felt required to return a not guilty verdict.|$|E
2500|$|Providentissimus Deus, [...] "On the Study of Holy Scripture", was an {{encyclical}} {{issued by}} Leo XIII on 18 November 1893 on {{the interpretation of}} Scripture.

Nothing specific concerning evolution <b>was</b> <b>said,</b> <b>and</b> initially both those in favour and against evolution found things to encourage them in the text; however a more conservative interpretation came to be dominant, {{and the influence of}} the conservative Jesuit Cardinal Camillo Mazzella (with whom Leo had argued over Mons. D'Hulst) detected. Leo stressed the unstable and changing nature of scientific theory, and criticised the [...] "thirst for novelty and the unrestrained freedom of thought" [...] of the age, but accepted that the apparent literal sense of the Bible might not always be correct. In biblical interpretation, Catholic scholars should not [...] "depart from the literal and obvious sense, except only where reason makes it untenable or necessity requires". Leo stressed that both theologians and scientists should confine themselves to their own disciplines as much as possible.|$|E

2500|$|The Funeral Oration was {{recorded}} by Thucydides in book {{two of his}} famous History of the Peloponnesian War. Although Thucydides records the speech {{in the first person}} {{as if it were a}} word for word record of what Pericles said, there can be little doubt that he edited the speech at the very least. [...] Thucydides says early in his History that the speeches presented are not verbatim records, but are intended to represent the main ideas of what <b>was</b> <b>said</b> <b>and</b> what was, according to Thucydides, [...] "called for in the situation". [...] We can be reasonably sure that Pericles delivered a speech at the end of the first year of the war, but there is no consensus as to what degree Thucydides' record resembles Pericles' actual speech. [...] Another confusing factor is that Pericles is known to have delivered another funeral oration in 440 BC during the Samian War. [...] It is possible that elements of both speeches are represented in Thucydides' version. [...] Nevertheless Thucydides was extremely meticulous in his documentation, and records the varied certainty of his sources each time. [...] Significantly he begins recounting the speech by saying: [...] "Περικλῆς ὁ Ξανθίππου ... ἔλεγε τοιάδε", i.e. [...] "Pericles, son of Xanthippos, spoke like this". [...] Had he quoted the speech verbatim, he would have written [...] "τάδε" [...] ("this", or [...] "these words") instead of [...] "τοιάδε" [...] ("like this" [...] or [...] "words like these").|$|E
2500|$|In [...] when Abram was ninety-nine years old, God {{declared}} his new name: [...] "Abraham"– [...] "a father of many nations", {{and gave him}} the covenant of circumcision. God gave Sarai the new name [...] "Sarah", and blessed her. Abraham was given assurance that Sarah would have a son. Not long afterwards, Abraham and Sarah were visited by three men. One of the visitors told Abraham that upon his return next year, Sarah would have a son. While at the tent entrance, Sarah overheard what <b>was</b> <b>said,</b> <b>and</b> she laughed to herself about the prospect of having a child at their ages. The visitor inquired of Abraham why Sarah laughed at the idea of bearing a child, for her age was as nothing to God. Sarah soon became pregnant and bore a son to Abraham, at the very time which had been spoken. The patriarch, then a hundred years old, named the child [...] "Isaac" [...] (Hebrew yitschaq, [...] "laughter") and circumcised him when he was eight days old. For Sarah, the thought of giving birth and nursing a child, at such an old age, also brought her much laughter, as she declared, [...] "God hath made me to laugh, [...] all that hear will laugh with me." [...] Abraham held a great feast on the day when Isaac was to be weaned. It was during this banquet that Sarah happened upon the then teenaged Ishmael mocking and was so disturbed that she requested that both he and Hagar be removed from their company. Abraham was initially distressed by this but relented when told by God to do as his wife had asked.|$|E
2500|$|Having {{never before}} worn prostheses, Cecily Adams found the Ishka makeup [...] "rather daunting" [...] and {{described}} the three to four hour application process {{before moving on to}} costuming. [...] Originally the producers drew lines on Adams' hands to make them appear older, but later decided they didn't look old enough and added fake hands. [...] Once all <b>was</b> <b>said</b> <b>and</b> done, only the palms of Adams' hands and her upper lip were visible. [...] After begging and pleading with the DS9 staff to see the dailies, Adams realized how much she needed to overexpress to have her facial expressions translate through the makeup. [...] When she came back to DS9 for 's [...] "The Magnificent Ferengi", Adams agreed on the condition she receive her own custom faceplate. [...] Adams praised the other DS9 actors who suffered through similar makeup ordeals saying, [...] "I think it's astonishing that they were all in good cheer, and to be in the makeup all the time is really something." [...] Because Ishka is flouting Ferengi law by wearing clothes, it was decided that she would overdo it, and so Adams was encumbered with [...] "baubles and bangles and beads" [...] that made so much noise on set that Adams estimated she had to loop half her lines. [...] For [...] "Profit and Lace", where Ishka was to leave the Ferengi homeworld of Ferenginar for the first time, Adams was dressed in a [...] "Spandex suit from [...] wrists to the tip of [...] toes". [...] Further, because Ishka was old, the staff padded Adams' costume with , including fake breasts that Adams guessed weighed after watching the dailies, both Adams and Behr agreed that the breasts needed to be reduced as they were too distracting. [...] Adams would later thank both director René Auberjonois and co-star Armin Shimerman for helping her realize that overacting {{was the name of the}} game when working under such protheses.|$|E
