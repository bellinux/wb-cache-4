40|$|The {{possibility}} that consumption of aged <b>whole</b> <b>milk</b> <b>powders</b> containing significant levels of cholesterol oxides may {{be detrimental to}} health has stimulated extensive research. In this study, the effects of feeding regimen and processing technology on the oxidative stability of lipids and cholesterol in <b>whole</b> <b>milk</b> <b>powders</b> were evaluated. Animal feeding regimen {{had a significant effect}} (p < 0. 05) on the levels of total protein, true protein, casein protein and whey protein in standardised milk over the experimental period. Levels of peroxides, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and cholesterol oxidation products were used as indices of lipid oxidation occurring in <b>whole</b> <b>milk</b> <b>powders.</b> Lipid and cholesterol oxidation increased significantly (p < 0. 01) after 12 months storage, the predominant oxysterols being 7 -ketocholesterol, cholesterol-a-and (3 -epoxides, 25 -hydroxycholesterol and cholestanetriol. A positive correlation was found between the levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and cholesterol oxidation products. Significant decreases in lipid oxidation were observed as a result of high pre-heat treatment of milk prior to processing (p < 0. 001), vacuum packing of powders in laminated foil bags prior to storage (p < 0. 05), and storing powders at reduced temperatures (15 ° C) (p < 0. 05). Levels of free sulphydryl groups, which possess antioxidant activity in <b>whole</b> <b>milk</b> <b>powders,</b> increased significantly (p < 0. 05) {{as a result of a}} grass plus concentrate-fed diet and the application of high pre-heat treatment of milk. The toxicity of these oxysterols was evaluted using primary cultures of porcine ovarian granulosa cells. The activities of catalase and superoxide dismutase, two antioxidant defense enzymes, were increased significantly (p < 0. 01) following 24 hour exposure to 2. 5 (iM concentrations of both cholestanetriol and 25 - hydroxycholesterol. Levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances remained unchanged under these conditions. Administration of a-tocopherol to the culture medium significantly (p < 0. 01) improved cell viability and restored catalase and superoxide dismutase activities to control levels.

40|$|International audienceEnergy {{dispersive}} X-ray (EDX) is {{a technique}} rarely used for organic powders. Nevertheless, this technique is of great interest in the characterization of milk particle surface. In order to validate the method, the EDX technique was tested on pure milk components, on model powders composed of different ratio of lactose/whey proteins and on <b>whole</b> <b>milk</b> <b>powders</b> presenting or not free fat at the surface. For all these powders, satisfactory results were obtained with correct experimental atomic percentages in comparison with expected theoretical percentages. The technique was then applied to skimmed and <b>whole</b> <b>milk</b> <b>powders</b> sieved in 4 fractions. The surface and the core (cut particle) were analyzed by EDX and compared. A relationship between the particle size and the surface composition was observed. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) often used to characterize <b>milk</b> <b>powder</b> surface, however no differences were observed between surface and core composition using this method. The depth of analysis by EDX is far more significant (I mu m) in comparison {{to that of the}} XPS (5 nm); hence it was concluded that the analysis of cut particle by EDX was not interesting since too close to the results obtained at the surface.

The homogeneity of two AfM 1 contaminated <b>milk</b> <b>powders</b> was studied by taking samples at regular intervals of the filling sequences and analysing in triplicate for their AfM 1 contents by liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (LC FLD) using random stratified sampling schemes. The homogeneity testing of the AfM 1 "blank" <b>milk</b> <b>powder</b> material was performed by determining the nitrogen content because AfM 1 levels were below the limit of detection of the most sensitive determination method. The short-term stability of AfM 1 contaminated <b>milk</b> <b>powders</b> was evaluated at three different storage temperatures (+ 4, + 18, and + 40 °C). After storage times of 0, 1, 2 and 4 weeks samples were investigated utilising LC FLD.

40|$|Fluidized bed {{agglomeration}} is used {{to produce}} large and porous dry agglomerates with improved instant properties. Water (or binder solution) is sprayed in the fluidized bed of particles to render their surface sticky. The agglomerate growth results from the repetition of different steps (wetting of the particle surface, particles collision and bridging, and drying) and depends on the processing conditions and product properties. In this work, skim and <b>whole</b> <b>milk</b> <b>powders</b> were fluidized in hot air and agglomerated by spraying water in a bench-scale batch fluidized bed. The aim was to study {{the impact of the}} sprayed water flow rate (0 - 5. 5 g. min(- 1)), particle load (300 - 400 g), initial particle size (200 - 350 mu m), and composition (skim-whole milk) on the growth mechanisms and on the properties of the agglomerates obtained. Powder samples were regularly taken in the fluidized bed during agglomeration and characterized for the size, size distribution, and water content. Whatever the conditions tested, the size increase and the evolution of the particle size distribution during agglomeration were found to mainly depend on the relative amount of water sprayed in the particle bed. Agglomeration occurred in two stages, with first the rapid association of initial particles into intermediate structures, and second, the progressive growth of porous agglomerates.

40|$|A new {{and easy}} method has been {{proposed}} for compensation of inorganic acid matrix effects in ICP-OES and ICP-MS. The method consists on an on-line standard addition calibration using a Flow Blurring® multinebulizer (FBMN-based system). Experimental conditions of the FBMN-based system are optimized for both ICP-OES and ICP-MS. Under optimized conditions recovery values obtained {{in the analysis of}} synthetic acid samples were close to 100 % for HNO 3 and HCl (with acid concentrations of up to 15 % (w w- 1)) and H 2 SO 4 (up to 10 % (w w- 1)) for both plasma-based spectrochemical techniques. The applicability of the proposed method has been evaluated analyzing two <b>whole</b> <b>milk</b> <b>powders,</b> certified reference material and a commercial product, showing excellent recovery values. Compared with other calibration strategies and experimental setups used, the on-line standard addition calibration using the FBMN-based system is faster, easier to handle and significantly reduces reagents and sample consumption.

40|$|Many {{workers have}} {{observed}} that under standardized conditions {{only part of the}} fat present in spray-dried milk can be extracted by fat solvents. This fat is usually called 'free fat' and has been related to other powder properties which are of practical importance. Contradictory results obtained by different workers have raised doubts concerning the practical significance of free fat. Moreover the explanation generally accepted in the literature, that free fat is 'unprotected fat' mainly situated on the particle surface, is not altogether satisfactory. An experimental study of the properties of free fat and its relation to powder properties of practical significance was carried out. The results of this study were described in a series of papers in Netherlands Milk and Dairy Journal and are collected in this thesis. In Chapter 1 a general outline of the problem and a brief review of the literature are given. It seemed desirable to investigate the influence of the experimental conditions during the determination of the free-fat content because earlier authors used widely varying conditions. In Chapter 2 it is shown that the extraction time and temperature influence considerably the amount of fat which is extracted but its influence may depend strongly on the powder under investigation. Because it was not clear which experimental conditions yielded free-fat contents relevant to other powder properties, two methods were usually applied, differing widely in contact time and extraction temperature. Particle size is of major importance for the physical properties of most powders. In Chapter 3 two methods are described to determine the mean particle size and the particle size distribution of spray powders, viz gas permeametry and microscopic counting, respectively. With these methods the influence of certain process parameters on particle size and the influence of particle size on the free-fat content of spray-dried <b>whole</b> <b>milk</b> were studied. It is shown that the mean particle size increases inversely with Vp, p being the spray pressure. Orifice diameters appeared to be of minor importance. Increasing the dry-solids content of the concentrated milk in the range of 30 - 45 % resulted in a reduction of the number of small particles. No influence of the particle size on the fat content and the moisture content was observed, but both the mean particle density and the free-fat content strongly increase with decreasing particle size. It is suggested that the influence of some processing parameters on the free-fat content of spray-dried <b>whole</b> <b>milk</b> may be attributed to their influence on particle size. With 20 powders, widely differing in free-fat content, the possible relationship between free fat and other powder properties of practical importance is investigated (Chapter 4). From the results the following conclusions were drawn: 1. There is no influence of the free fat on the development of oxidation flavour during 6 months' storage at 30 °C in the presence of air; 2. The solubility of spray-dried <b>whole</b> <b>milk</b> is usually better if its free-fat content is higher, but probably there is no causal relationship between the two quantities; 3. Below a free-fat content of 20 % (of the fat) there is a tendency for the dispersibility to increase with decreasing amount of free fat. This is not the case above 20 % free fat. Because both particle size and homogenization may effect dispersibility as well as free-fat content, no causal influence of free fat on dispersibility could be observed; 4. Neither cream rising nor foam formation during reconstitution is materially influenced by the amount of free fat in the powder. Churning of the butterfat by vigorously stirring during reconstitution was observed only with powders containing much free fat, prepared from unhomogenized concentrated milk. No quantitative correlation was observed between the amount of churned butterfat and the free-fat content of the powder. Chapter 5 treats the stickiness of spray-dried <b>whole</b> <b>milk</b> and a simple test to determine the cohesion of such powders is described. Good agreement between this cohesion and the visual observation of stickiness was found. It is shown that the cohesion of spray-dried <b>whole</b> <b>milk</b> increases with decreasing particle size as expected. Unexpected, however, was that the cohesion is independent of fat content in the range of 20 - 45 % fat, and of free-fat content. In spite of this, experiments at different temperatures showed that the milk fat {{is an important factor in}} the cohesion, and it is suggested that only a small amount of surface fat on the particles is already sufficient to give cohesion to <b>whole</b> <b>milk</b> <b>powders.</b> Probably fat contents higher than 20 % result in more surface fat, but this does not increase the cohesion. It is shown that an increase of moisture content decreases the cohesion in the range of 2 - 4 %, but a strong rise of cohesion occurs in the range of 4 - 7 %, probably due to increased plasticity of the powder particles and to lactose crystallization. In Chapter 6 it is shown that the free-fat content decreases considerably when the moisture content of spray-dried <b>whole</b> <b>milk</b> is increased in the range of 2 - 8 %. The effect appeared to be reversible. It is suggested that part of the fat is extracted from the <b>milk</b> <b>powder</b> particles via capillary pores or cracks, which close when the powder absorbs water. With a scanning electron microscope photographs were taken of dried milk particles without water being used, this to avoid artefacts. The method is described in Chapter 7 and a few photographs are shown. From measurement of the penetration speed of nitrogen into the powder particle porosity factor was calculated (Chapter 8). There appeared to be a strong correlation (r = 0. 94) between the free-fat content and this particle porosity. From this observation it is concluded that the particle porosity is of major importance for the extraction of fat from <b>milk</b> <b>powders.</b> Photographs taken with a scanning electron microscope show cracks and pores in particles with high porosity, whereas in less porous powder particles only surface folds and occasional cracks could be observed. Possible explanations of particle porosity are discussed. Chapter 9 contains the fat globule size distributions in concentrated milk and in <b>milk</b> reconstituted from <b>whole</b> <b>milk</b> spray <b>powders</b> with various free-fat contents as determined with a Coulter counter. It is concluded that the spraying of concentrated milk causes a considerable size reduction of the fat globules. Some coalescence of fat globules takes place during drying or during reconstitution of <b>milk</b> from the <b>powders.</b> A rather good relationship is obtained between the free-fat content of the powders and the percentage of fat present as fat globules> 2 μm in milk reconstituted from the same powders. The phenomenon that only part of the fat in spray-dried <b>whole</b> <b>milk</b> can be extracted by fat solvents is usually explained by the assumption that this 'free fat' is unprotected surface fat. In Chapter 10 it is shown that surface fat in such powders is dissolved in a few seconds by organic solvents. The amount of fat extracted by the majority of the extraction methods with much longer contact times applied until now, consists for only a minor part of surface fat in many cases. Experiments with spray powders consisting only of lactose and anhydrous butterfat show that fat globules without protein membranes can be protected by the amorphous lactose against fat solvents. A new model for the occurrence of free fat in spray-dried <b>whole</b> <b>milk,</b> based on the accessibility of the fat in the powder particles, is proposed. The relationship between fat content and free-fat content of spray-dried <b>whole</b> <b>milk</b> is investigated, and the curves which were obtained are explained with the new model. Finally the practical consequences of the model are discussed and compared with the results of earlier experiments. The conclusion is that only the surface fat is relevant because of its possible influence on dispersibility and the cohesion of spray-dried <b>whole</b> <b>milk.</b> This fat can be determined approximately with a very short extraction (e. g. 10 seconds) at room temperature...|$|R
