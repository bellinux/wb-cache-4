5|$|Kenny Bräck won {{the pole}} {{position}} and maintained his advantage {{heading into the}} first lap. He led {{for a total of}} 134 laps, more than any other competitor. Franchitti employed a strategy that enabled him to drive in clean air while other drivers made pit stops. Bräck reclaimed the lead for the lap-163 restart, but lost it six laps later when a crew member dropped a <b>wheel</b> <b>nut</b> which cost him time. Franchitti took over the lead and held it {{for the remainder of the}} event to clinch the victory. It was Franchitti's third win of the season, his first on an oval track, and the tenth (and final) of his CART career. There were five cautions and nine lead changes during the course of the race.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton {{started from}} pole position, but was {{overtaken}} by Rosberg {{at the first}} corner. Rosberg held the lead {{for the remainder of}} the race, barring brief periods during pit stops, and won by over three seconds. Hamilton remained ahead of Williams driver Felipe Massa to claim the runner-up position. Ferrari driver Sebastian Vettel had been holding third position for much of the first half of the race, but a delay due to a stuck <b>wheel</b> <b>nut</b> during his pit stop dropped him into fourth place. Former World Champions Kimi Räikkönen and Fernando Alonso were eliminated on the first lap, after Räikkönen lost control of his Ferrari at the second turn and collided with Alonso. The two came to rest against the safety barrier, with Alonso's McLaren atop the Ferrari.|$|E
5|$|On lap thirty-one, Buemi {{tried to}} pass Glock on the outside heading into turn three but lost control of his car under braking and rammed {{into the side of}} Glock. Buemi {{sustained}} a broken left, front suspension and front wing damage, causing him to retire. The incident called for the race's third safety car period. During the safety car deployment, most of the drivers made pit stops for intermediate tyres. Alonso, who was called in by Ferrari when Vettel changed his strategy, had a pit stop that proved problematic. He arrived into his pit box sideways after locking his tyres. One of his mechanics could not fit his front right wheel because he dropped a wheel nut; he was required to fit a spare <b>wheel</b> <b>nut</b> onto the tyre, causing Alonso to be stationary for longer than usual. He lost third place to Hamilton.|$|E

5000|$|A {{peanut butter}} wrench, {{also known as}} a crank bolt spanner or a crank spanner, is a {{single-ended}} box wrench or ring spanner used in cycling to tighten older 14 mm and 15 mm crank bolts, or the <b>wheel</b> <b>nuts</b> (track nuts) on hubs with solid axles commonly found on track bicycles, particularly the 15 mm wrench made by Campagnolo. This is the only one-piece wrench {{that can be used to}} tighten or loosen the bolt or nut which holds the crank to a square-taper bottom bracket spindle (although a thin-walled 15 mm socket and handle will also serve), whereas any wrench/spanner of the correct size will tighten or loosen <b>wheel</b> <b>nuts.</b>|$|R
5|$|In {{the second}} {{practice}} session, Bird was quickest with a lap of {{one minute and}} 8.792 seconds, ahead of Rosenqvist in second and di Grassi third. Buemi was fourth-fastest; Robin Frijns was fifth and Piquet sixth. Turvey was seventh-fastest, Vergne eighth, Prost ninth and Maro Engel completed the top ten ahead of qualifying. Turvey impacted the chicane's barrier with Adam Carroll and Bird spinning their cars in the fifth turn. Loïc Duval's left-front tyre lost a <b>wheel</b> <b>nut,</b> causing it to become detached and the session was red flagged. As {{a result of the}} red flag to retrieve Duval's tire and the two stoppages seen in the first practice session, the second 45-minute practice period was extended by five minutes. Shortly after the session restarted, Engel stopped at the turn one exit with car problems but a second red flag was not required because he was off the track. Di Grassi pushed hard and went into the turn four wall, damaging his car's front-right corner and rear-end, and yellow flags were waved to warn drivers about the incident.|$|E
5|$|DRS was enabled on the 24th lap. Although Hamilton {{had closed}} Rosberg's lead {{to half a}} second and used the system, he could not pass his teammate. Räikkönen made a {{problematic}} pit stop that lap, as his mechanics struggled to install a right-front <b>wheel</b> <b>nut</b> correctly. Hamilton tried to pass Rosberg again the following lap by running in his slipstream, but Rosberg held the line and had enough acceleration to defend first place. Hamilton held a tighter line, while Rosberg complained of more oversteer on lap 26. On the 27th lap, Hamilton forgot to deactivate his DRS system and lost control of his rear end; his brakes locked, and {{he went into the}} turn one run-off area. However, he caught up to Rosberg and ran closely behind his teammate into the hairpin without trying to pass. Hamilton moved across the track during the lap in an attempt to pass; Rosberg's car shuddered, and Hamilton got a better run onto the pit-lane straight. He was in Rosberg's slipstream before passing him on the outside heading into the first turn to take the lead on lap 29. Hamilton pushed hard and pulled away from Rosberg, who lost control heading into the pit-lane straight.|$|E
5|$|The {{third round}} of green-flag pit stops {{commenced}} fifteen laps later when Bräck became the first driver to stop. Franchitti inherited the first position until he made his pit stop on lap 143, handing it to Manning. This meant Manning became the first driver to lead his début CART race twice. The fourth caution was necessitated on the 155th lap when Manning's right-hand rear wing endplate became detached and landed on the track {{between the first and}} second turns. Manning made a pit stop but his crew elected not to make repairs to his rear wing. It assisted in making his car develop less understeer and slightly improved its balance. Racing resumed on lap 163 with Bräck leading a single-file restart. The left side of Kanaan's car collided heavily with the wall on the backstraight six laps later, triggering the fifth (and final) caution. All drivers (including Bräck) made pit stops under caution. A crew member on Bräck's team dropped a left-rear <b>wheel</b> <b>nut</b> dropping him to ninth place. Fernández was observed speeding and was required to move to the rear of the field. Da Matta's team were slow to fit his right-rear tyre preventing him from taking the first position and he emerged in second place.|$|E

25|$|At the Grand Prix on 14 July, the {{pressures}} on Hill as national favourite and son of a famous father (Graham Hill) were not inconsiderable, but he responded well, setting pole. Unfortunately he muffed the start and later spun out of contention when a front <b>wheel</b> <b>nut</b> became loose, and his teammate Jacques Villeneuve {{went on to win}} at a fraction over 124mph, from Berger's Benetton and the McLaren of Häkkinen.|$|E
25|$|Button {{suffered}} {{his first}} retirement {{of the season}} at the , caused by an error at his final pit stop. The wheel gun failed to refit the <b>wheel</b> <b>nut</b> and Button was released by the pit crew with an unsecured wheel. At the , he retired in consecutive races {{for the first time}} since 2008, due to hydraulic issues. Button won his 200th Formula One race at the , where he had won his first Grand Prix in 2006. Button finished third in Belgium, having qualified in 13th after a miscommunication with his team, after overtaking Alonso with two laps to go. He finished second at both Monza. In Singapore, Button chased Vettel who was in the lead with a few laps to go, closing at over a second a lap, but at the final moment, traffic denied him the chance to take first. After Singapore he moved into second place in the Drivers' Championship, and he became the only driver that could deny Vettel a second consecutive title.|$|E
25|$|On lap 14, Morbidelli crashed, and Brundle crashed off {{shortly after}} {{at the same}} point whilst the marshalls were still dealing with Morbidelli's car. Although no-one was hit by the car, one marshall was hit by debris and {{suffered}} a broken leg; the race was stopped. The race restarted after some time behind the Safety Car and Frentzen ran wide into the first corner, dropping down three places. Schumacher, who was just ahead on track but 6 seconds ahead on aggregate pitted early on lap 19. He took on fresh tyres and a fuel load that was insufficient to last {{to the end of the}} race. He rejoined 17 seconds behind Hill on aggregate but got caught in traffic and soon the gap was up to 30 seconds before it stabilized. This meant that Hill rejoined 7 seconds ahead on lap 25 when he pitted and fueled to the end of the race, but only 3 of his tyres were changed due to a sticking <b>wheel</b> <b>nut.</b> This, coupled with Hill's heavy fuel load appeared to hinder him and Schumacher began to close in.|$|E

After qualifying outside the top ten in Australia, di Resta managed to battle through into the points, finishing just behind his teammate, Adrian Sutil in eighth place. In Malaysia, however di Resta retired after his car's <b>wheel</b> <b>nuts</b> kept jamming, and the team was ultimately forced to retire both cars.|$|R
25|$|Kartikeyan {{qualified}} {{last for}} the following 5 races (bar in Spain where Lewis Hamilton was excluded from qualifying and in Monaco where Sergio Pérez crashed without setting a time) however Karthikeyan only started 24th and last twice (in Bahrain and Canada) due to other drivers picking up grid penalties. In China Karthikeyan finished 22nd, ahead of Caterham's Heikki Kovalainen. In Bahrain, Karthikeyan finished 21st and was classified ahead of the Williams of Bruno Senna who retired due to brake issues. In Spain Karthikeyan retired for the first race in the same after a <b>wheel</b> <b>nut</b> failure on lap 22 due to a botched pit stop. In Monaco Karthikeyan started 22nd, ahead of Peréz and the penalised Pastor Maldonado and finished the race in 15th, classified ahead of McLaren's Jenson Button who retired after collision damage with Kovalainen (Karthikeyan also had his race quickest lap within 0.3 secs of Button). In Canada Karthikeyan retired {{for the second time}} in the season after suffering a brake failure on lap 22 which made him spin in turn 1 and stop later on in the lap, his teammate Pedro de la Rosa retire with a similar issue two laps later.|$|E

Trummer took advantage of a battle between Binder and Izawa to pass both drivers in the same passing manoeuvre in the opening corners for third place on the 14th lap. He passed Daly for second position two laps later. Bertbon went into the pit lane from the lead on lap 18 and narrowly avoided colliding with Trummer as he attempted to enter the pit lane. After leaving the pit lane, Berthon was affected by <b>wheel</b> <b>nut</b> problem that caused him to slow with a suspected loose wheel before returning to the pit lane. Leal was heavily delayed by Markelov allowing Palmer to pull away. Meanwhile, Trummer remained on track and lost small amounts of his pace by pushing hard. Vandoorne reduced Trummer's lead to eight seconds by the time Trummer made his pit stop at the end of lap 30. He was followed by Coletti, Pic and Nasr with the late-stopping Quaife-Hobbs and Izama moving through the field courtesy of having newer soft compound tyres installed on their cars.|$|E

500|$|The Benetton and Williams {{teams were}} {{employing}} different pit stop strategies – the Benetton team were planning a threestop strategy whereas the Williams team were only planning for twostops. Schumacher made a pit stop on lap18, but was momentarily baulked by the slowing Jordan car of Barrichello {{as he was}} entering the pitlane. Schumacher exited the stop behind Berger, but overtook the Austrian driver {{at the beginning of}} the next lap. Hill, who had remained close behind Schumacher before the German made a pit stop, made his own stop on lap21, exiting the pitlane in front of Schumacher. Coulthard took the lead of the race for one lap, before pitting and dropping behind the two leaders and the yet-to-stop Häkkinen and Berger. Häkkinen and Berger were the final drivers of the leading teams to pit, however, the McLaren mechanics had trouble getting the fuel hose off the Finn's car when he stopped on lap23, losing him tenseconds. Several other teams experienced problems with attaching and detaching the refuelling nozzles, and occasional small sprays of fuel were observed, reinforcing the problem experienced by McLaren with the equipment before the race meeting. Berger, adopting a strategy of pitting late, was the only driver not to have stopped by lap24 and thus was third, with Hill, Schumacher, Coulthard, Alesi and Salo the other drivers in the top six places. Salo's stop had been faultless, gaining him significant time on those drivers who had been running in front of him. By this stage Gachot had retired his Pacific car after it got stuck in fifth gear. Berger made his stop on lap 27, but had problems leaving the pit lane after a communication problem between him and his mechanics nearly led to him leaving the pit lane with a loose <b>wheel</b> <b>nut</b> on the front right-hand wheel. The pit [...] "lollipop", signalling the driver when to leave, was raised and lowered again in quick succession, preventing Berger from leaving until the <b>wheel</b> <b>nut</b> was sufficiently tightened. The miscommunication cost Berger 13seconds, dropping him back to seventhposition. Alesi fell behind Salo and Häkkinen after the firstset of pitstops, Salo overtaking him on lap25, with Häkkinen moving past threelaps later as Alesi was held up behind the lapped Montermini.|$|E
500|$|Manning {{said his}} ninth-place result in his début race was one they felt was a [...] "fantastic result". He thanked his crew, their sponsor, and the track's management. However, he was {{disappointed}} that {{he was unable to}} get practice runs before the qualifying session as he felt that he could have started in a higher position. Bräck stated that he lost the chance of victory when a crew member dropped a <b>wheel</b> <b>nut</b> on his final pit stop, saying: [...] "There is something hanging over us. I do my part, they do their part. When everyone is having a good day you win. If not, you lose." [...] Fernández was angry with the pit lane speeding penalty, saying he felt he could have achieved a better finishing position and that the rule on pit lane speeding could [...] "ruin your day". After the race, he spent several hours discussing the penalty with race officials. John Lopes, the CART Vice President of Racing Operations, later stated that the series would investigate the rules regarding pit lane speeding penalties but affirmed that no action could be taken until after the season's end.|$|E
500|$|Rosberg {{was again}} fastest {{in the second}} {{practice}} session on Friday evening. His time of 1:31.001 {{was more than one}} and a half seconds faster than the pole position time in the previous year's event. Lewis Hamilton finished second fastest, 0.241 seconds adrift of Rosberg. Jenson Button set the third fastest time for McLaren, although he was more than a second off the fastest time. Several drivers voiced surprise over McLaren's pace during Friday's practice sessions, described by Button as the team's best [...] "for a couple of years". Max Verstappen followed in fourth, ahead of the two Ferrari cars of Räikkönen and Vettel. The latter had set the third-fastest time on the soft tyre compound, but mistakes during his runs on the super-soft tyres meant that he was unable to place higher than sixth. He had to end his session fifteen minutes early when his rear-left <b>wheel</b> <b>nut</b> came loose. Vandoorne was eleventh fastest in his second session, while Sergio Pérez, who took back the car from Celis, was fifteenth, two places ahead of his teammate Nico Hülkenberg. Vibrations from running over the kerbs caused the front wing on Romain Grosjean's car to dislodge, forcing him off track. He was able {{to get back into the}} pitlane and had the wing replaced. At the end of the session, Renault's Kevin Magnussen failed to stop for weighing, instead returning to his garage, where work was conducted on his car. As a consequence, he was forced to start the race from the pitlane.|$|E

25|$|In late 1952 Bristol {{made the}} {{surprise}} announcement {{that the car}} was to be redesigned as a two-seat sports car, for entry into the following year's Le Mans race. Over the following few months the G-type was comprehensively redesigned and rebuilt by Bristol's new motor sport department, with the design team led by David Summers. The chassis itself was founded on twin, oval-section rails running {{the length of the}} car, which were changed to simple circular-section members for the Bristol. To these, the G-Type's double wishbone front and de Dion tube rear suspension were attached. The wheelbase was relatively long at 8ft 1¼ in (247cm), especially considering the car's narrow track of 4ft 3 in (130cm). Inboard brakes at the rear and an innovative hub/rim arrangement reduced unsprung weight. These innovative wheels consisted of a large hub spider – through which driveshafts could be switched without needing to remove the wheels and brakes – to which a wheel consisting of little more than a rim was attached. For the 1955 Le Mans race, to save further time during pit stops, Bristol developed an equally innovative multi-barreled, powered spanner, which could remove all five <b>wheel</b> <b>nuts</b> simultaneously. In {{much the same way as}} for modern Formula One wheel changes, the spanner would then retain the <b>wheel</b> <b>nuts</b> and allow precise reattachment of the new wheel to the car, applying the correct amount of torque to each nut.|$|R

2500|$|... {{would be}} Mansell's finest season. He started {{the year with}} five {{straight}} victories (a record not equalled until Michael Schumacher in [...] ). At the sixth round {{of the season in}} Monaco, he took pole and dominated much of the race. However, with seven laps remaining, Mansell suffered a loose <b>wheel</b> <b>nut</b> and was forced into the pits, emerging behind Ayrton Senna's McLaren-Honda. Mansell, on fresh tyres, set a lap record almost two seconds quicker than Senna's and closed from 5.2 to 1.9 seconds in only two laps. The pair duelled around Monaco for the final four laps but Mansell could find no way past, finishing just 0.2 seconds behind the Brazilian. Mansell became the most successful British driver of all time when he won the British Grand Prix at Silverstone, as he surpassed Jackie Stewart's record of 27 wins with his 28th. Mansell was crowned Formula One World Champion early in the season at the Hungarian Grand Prix, the 11th round of that season, where his second-place finish clinched the Drivers' Championship, securing the title in the least number of Grands Prix since the 16-race season format started. Mansell also set the then-record for the most number of wins in one season (9); both records stood until broken by Schumacher in 2002. He managed 14 pole positions that year, a record only broken by Sebastian Vettel in 2011 in the Brazilian Grand Prix on 26 November.
