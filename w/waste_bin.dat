500|$|The {{expression}} {{has also}} been used to characterize any process that happens with smoothness and precision, as a near-synonym to expressions such as [...] "like clockwork" [...] or [...] "a well-oiled machine."

40|$|Determining {{the optimal}} {{location}} {{and quantity of}} <b>waste</b> <b>bins</b> for the collection of municipal solid wastes is challenging because it influences service coverage and public satisfaction, and is often influenced by economic and environmental constraints. This study develops a framework that applies a geographic information system for siting municipal <b>waste</b> <b>bins</b> and determines the optimum quantity of <b>waste</b> <b>bins</b> using an analytic hierarchy process. The framework was applied to a neighborhood in a developing world city (Ilorin, Nigeria). The spatial performance of specific quantities of <b>waste</b> <b>bins</b> was evaluated for social, economic, and environmental effects, as determined from p-median solutions using field-collected solid waste generation data and operational data for the collection vehicles. For the study site, the most optimal solution is five <b>waste</b> <b>bins</b> whose spatial location utilized their capacities and produced less comparative negative effects. The result represents {{a starting point for}} extension to larger urban areas by considering the smallest basic unit for spatial and multicriteria analysis. The approach is promising for improvement of municipal solid waste management in developing world cities...|$|R

500|$|In 2004, the musicologist Olga Digonskaya {{discovered}} {{a trove of}} Shostakovich manuscripts at the Glinka State Central Museum of Musical Culture, Moscow.

[...] "A composer friend bribed Shostakovich's housemaid to regularly deliver the contents of Shostakovich's office <b>waste</b> <b>bin</b> to him, instead of {{taking it to the}} garbage.

500|$|Three {{days after}} the crash, German detectives searched Lubitz's Montabaur {{properties}} and removed a computer and other items for testing. They did not find a suicide note nor any evidence his actions had been motivated by [...] "a political or religious background". During their search of Lubitz's apartment, detectives found a letter in a <b>waste</b> <b>bin</b> indicating he had been declared unfit to work by a doctor. Germanwings stated it had not received a sick note from Lubitz for {{the day of the}} flight. News accounts said Lubitz was [...] "hiding an illness from his employers"; under German law, employers {{do not have access to}} employees' medical records, and sick notes excusing a person from work do not give information about medical conditions.|$|E
2500|$|A shelter, shed, small {{building}} or [...] "super-structure" [...] houses the squatting pan or toilet seat and provides privacy and {{protection from the}} weather for the user. Ideally, the shelter or small building should have handwashing facilities available inside or on the outside (e.g. supplied with water from a rainwater harvesting tank {{on the roof of}} the shelter) although this is unfortunately rarely the case in practice. In the shelter, anal cleansing materials (e.g. toilet paper) and a solid <b>waste</b> <b>bin</b> should also be available. A more substantial structure may also be built, commonly known as an outhouse.|$|E
40|$|The {{management}} of medical waste {{is of great}} importance due to its potential environmental hazards and public health risks because improper {{disposal of medical waste}} may pose a significant threat to human and environmental health. In this study, it was aimed to carry out bacteriologic analyses of disinfected medical <b>waste</b> <b>bins</b> used in health institutions. 571 samples taken from disinfected medical <b>waste</b> <b>bins</b> were grown in sheep blood agar, EMB agar and Chrome orientation medium and reproduction results were evaluated. Reproduction was observed in 502 samples out of 571 and the reproducing bacteria were E. faecalis, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. aureus, Proteus and S. Saprophyticus. Considering reproduction results of samples taken from medical <b>waste</b> <b>bins,</b> it becomes necessary {{to pay more attention to}} disinfection procedures and conform to standard infection prevention measures...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} the current solid waste management practices in Damaturu town and provides a brief discussion on the future challenges. Damaturu town became a state capital in August 1991. Since then the population has been on a steady increase mainly due to influx of people and its strategic location along axial route to major cities in the northeast region. Wastes are being generated mainly from residential, commercial and institutional land uses. <b>Waste</b> collection <b>bins</b> are placed at strategic locations identified by the agency and termed as high waste generating points with wheeled plastic <b>waste</b> <b>bins,</b> metal <b>waste</b> <b>bins</b> and constructed <b>waste</b> bunkers. The contents of these bins are finally disposed of at a location 6 kilometers away from the generating points. Spatial data on waste distribution was collected using a global positioning system (GPS). The data was manipulated and processed using Geographic information system (GIS) to produce the waste distribution map. Findings revealed that the existing solid waste management system is inefficient as the present practice rely on monthly collection and disposal of waste using an open dump site...|$|R
