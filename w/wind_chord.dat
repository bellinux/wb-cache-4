Guy Rickards describes the tone poem as an [...] "extraordinary score", magnificent yet subtle in its {{depiction of the}} sea's various moods, but nonetheless [...] "music suffused by light", while Robert Layton sees the piece as [...] "far more ambitious and highly organized in design" [...] than its immediate predecessor, The Bard. Tawaststjerna notes Sibelius's success at characterizing the sea: the [...] "playful flutes" [...] that bring the oceanides to life but which feel [...] "alien" [...] in the landscape's vastness; the [...] "powerful swell" [...] of wind and water conveyed by oboe and clarinet over undulating strings and harp glissandi; the sustained <b>wind</b> <b>chord</b> symbolizing the [...] "limitless expanse of the sea"; and, the [...] "mighty climax" [...] of the storm, the final wave crash which [...] "always exceeds one's expectations". The Finnish composer Kalevi Aho has argued {{in favor of the}} D major Yale version, feeling as though the piece loses [...] "something essential" [...] in terms of orchestral color in D major: [...] "The orchestral tone in D major is veiled, somehow mysterious and impressionistic. Compared with it D major sounds clearer, but also more matter-of-fact". The conductor Osmo Vänskä also has noted {{the difference between the two}} keys, comparing the D major version to a [...] "large lake" [...] and the D major to a [...] "mighty ocean".|$|E
40|$|The contrabassoon {{is seldom}} {{thought of as}} a solo instrument. Throughout the long history of contraregister double-reed {{instruments}} the assumed role has been to provide a foundation for the <b>wind</b> <b>chord,</b> along the same line as the double bass does for the strings. Due to the scale of these instruments - close to six metres in acoustic length, to reach the subcontra B flat’’, an octave below the bassoon’s lowest note, B flat’ - they have always been difficult and expensive to build, difficult to play, and often unsatisfactory in evenness of scale and dynamic range, and thus instruments and performers are relatively rare. Given this bleak outlook it is unusual to find a number of works written for solo contrabassoon by New Zealand composers. This exegesis considers the development of contra-register double-reed instruments both internationally and within New Zealand, and studies five works by New Zealand composers for solo contrabassoon, illuminating what it was that led them to compose for an instrument that has been described as the 'step-child' or 'Cinderella' of both the <b>wind</b> <b>chord</b> and instrument makers...|$|E

This section also features many solos for various instruments, followed by a pas de trois above a gently undulating accompaniment where lyrical melody lines are heard, with the oboe able to penetrate the whole texture in expressive fashion.

40|$|Small {{fixed-wing}} UAS {{that are}} able to hover combine the station keeping abilities of a rotary wing platform and the extended range of conventional aircraft. Current autopilots for these vehicles rely on inertial measurements plus airspeed to transition from forward flight to hover, accumulating appreciable position error during the transition. Once in hover, a combination of inertial and GPS data is used for station keeping. By combining additional real-time aerodynamic data with traditional inertial measurements, the aircraft can maintain high angle-of-attack operation for controlled slow flight and execute forward/vertical flight transitions closer to stall. Such a capability can expand the autonomous maneuver repertoire as well as improve accuracy at which existing maneuvers are conducted.

The aerodynamic characteristics of four span locations are determined from surface pressure measurements and wake surveys with a traversed five-hole probe performed in a low speed <b>wind</b> tunnel for <b>chord</b> Reynolds numbers ranging from 360, 000 - 640, 000. Two-dimensional modelling of the wind tunnel tests is performed with the commercial computational fluid dynamics code FLUENT. The predictive accuracies of five eddy-viscosity turbulence models are compared. The computational results are compared {{to each other and}} experimental data. It is found that agreement between computational and experimental results varies with turbulence model. For lower Reynolds numbers, the Transitional-SST turbulence model accurately predicted the presence of laminar separation bubbles and was found to be superior to the fully turbulent models considered. This highlighted the importance of transitional modelling at lower Reynolds numbers. With increasing angles of attack the bubbles were found to move towards the leading edge and decrease in length. This was validated with experimental data. For the tip blade section, computations implementing the k-ε realizable turbulence model best predicted experimental data. The two-dimensional panel method code, XFOIL, was found to be optimistic with significantly higher lift-to-drag ratios than measured. Three-dimensional modelling of the rotating wind turbine rotor is performed with the commercial computational fluid dynamics code NUMECA. The Coefficient of Power (Cp) predicted varies from 0. 440 to 0. 565 depending on the turbulence model. Sectional airfoil characteristics are extracted from these computations and compared to two-dimensional airfoil characteristics. Separation was found to be suppressed for the rotating case.
