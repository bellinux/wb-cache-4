5000|$|Litz wire: To reduce {{skin effect}} losses, some coils are wound {{with a special}} type of radio {{frequency}} wire called litz wire. Instead of a single solid conductor, litz wire consists {{of a number of}} smaller wire strands that carry the current. Unlike ordinary stranded wire, the strands are insulated from each other, to prevent skin effect from forcing the current to the surface, and are twisted or braided together. The twist pattern ensures that each wire strand spends the same amount of its length {{on the outside of the}} <b>wire</b> <b>bundle,</b> so skin effect distributes the current equally between the strands, resulting in a larger cross-sectional conduction area than an equivalent single wire.|$|E

40|$|Litz <b>wire</b> <b>bundles</b> {{are highly}} {{effective}} at enhancing the {{current carrying capacity}} and limiting the losses of electronic devices up to MHz frequencies due to the pattern in which the individual wires are braided in the bundle. However, the technology to fabricate Litz <b>wire</b> <b>bundles</b> at higher radio frequencies has not been developed due to current manufacturing limitations. Litz <b>wire</b> <b>bundles</b> developed to accommodate higher radio frequencies would have a tremendous impact for electronic devices because these bundles would allow for inductors to be manufactured with increased quality factors from the current range of less than 10 to a possible range of up to 1000 at frequencies of 1 - 10 GHz. This would allow for less spectral crowding, jamming, improved power handling, and more efficient systems. In this thesis, through collaboration with The Charles Stark Draper Laboratory, dielectrophoretic and driven fluid flow bead manipulation methods were explored for the purpose of demonstrating the plausibility of controlled litz wire braiding at a nano-to-micro scale. Results from this thesis show that both dielectrophoresis and driven fluid flow are viable methods for bead manipulation and should be further developed to enable fabrication of "NanoLitz" wires. by Alexxis Isaac and Makai Cartman.

40|$|Determining current {{carrying}} capacity (ampacity) of wire bundles in aerospace vehicles is critical not only to safety but also to efficient design. Published standards provide guidance on determining <b>wire</b> <b>bundle</b> ampacity but offer little flexibility for configurations where wire bundles of mixed gauges and currents are employed with varying external insulation jacket surface properties. Thermal modeling has been employed {{in an attempt to}} develop techniques to assist in ampacity determination for these complex configurations.

40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to present the results of two hypervelocity impact failure risk assessments for critical wire bundles exposed aboard the Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS- 1) to an increased orbital debris environment at its 824 km, 98. 8 deg inclination orbit. The first “generic” approach predicted the number of wires broken by orbital debris ejecta emerging from normal impact with multi-layer insulation (MLI) covering 36, 18, and 6 strand wire bundles at a 5 cm standoff using the Smooth Particle Hydrodynamic (SPH) code. This approach also included a mathematical approach for computing the probability that redundant wires were severed within the bundle. Based in part on the high computed risk of a critical <b>wire</b> <b>bundle</b> failure from the generic approach, an enhanced orbital debris protection design was examined, consisting of betacloth-reinforced MLI suspended at a 5 cm standoff over a seven layer betacloth and Kevlar blanket, draped over the exposed wire bundles. A second SPH-based risk assessment was conducted that also included the beneficial effects from the high (75 degree) obliquity of orbital debris impact owing to the flight orientation of the exposed wiring and shadowing by other spacecraft components. These factors resulted in a considerably reduced likelihood of critical <b>wire</b> <b>bundle</b> failure compared to the original baseline design with normal impacts and no shadowing...|$|E

The shorted wire was to have been constructed from nickel-plated copper conductors surrounded by the polyimide insulation Kapton, top-coated with an aromatic polyimide resin. The wires were analyzed via scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy dispersive X-Ray spectroscopy (EDX), and electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA); differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) were performed on the polyimide.

A combination of reaction wheels, reaction control system, and a slow rotisserie roll about the solar sail's normal axis were expected to handle attitude control and adjust for imperfections in the deployed sail during the 2. 5 -year mission. As the design for NEAScout matured, one of the critical design parameters, the offset {{in the center of}} mass and center of pressure (CP/CM offset), proved to be sub-optimal. After significant mission and control analysis, the CP/CM offset was accommodated by the addition of a new subsystem to NEAScout. This system, called the Active Mass Translator (AMT), would reside near the geometric center of NEAScout and adjust the CM by moving one portion of the flight system relative to the other. The AMT was given limited design space - 17 mm of the vehicle's assembly height-and was required to generate +/- 8 cm by +/- 2 cm translation to sub-millimeter accuracy. Furthermore, the design must accommodate a large <b>wire</b> <b>bundle</b> of small gage, single strand wire and coax cables fed {{through the center of the}} mechanism. The bend radius, bend resistance, and the exposure to deep space environment complicates the AMT design and operation and necessitated a unique design to mitigate risks of <b>wire</b> <b>bundle</b> damage, binding, and cold-welding during operation.

This paper studies the effect of random wire positions due to the bundle rotation on the coupling with external fields and presents an efficient method to estimate the averages and standard deviations of the voltages and powers induced on the loads. Three configurations of a four-wire bundle under external fields are investigated by using the Baum-Liu-Tesche equation in the frequency domain and together with the inverse Fourier transform in the time domain, and the results show that the induced voltages and powers change as sine functions when the bundle rotates. The proposed method can estimate the averages and standard deviations of the induced voltages and powers quickly, just by three times repeated analysis, and the results agree well with those obtained statistically. 1...|$|E
