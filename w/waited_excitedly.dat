60|$|In {{the center}} of the room was a pool of {{considerable}} size, the level of the water being but a few inches below the floor. Those behind the fleeing prince and his captive entered the chamber in time to see Metak leap into the water with the girl and disappear beneath the surface taking his captive with him, nor, though they <b>waited</b> <b>excitedly</b> around the rim of the pool, did either of the two again emerge.|$|E
50|$|It's May Day {{and a small}} {{community}} <b>waits</b> <b>excitedly</b> for this year's pagan parade to begin. Local teenager and dark horse, Linus Newcombe (Max Fowler), watches woefully as {{the love of his}} life, Caitlin Sutton (Leila Mimmack), kisses a rival. Meanwhile, {{on the other side of}} town, Caitlin's twin and the beautiful young May Queen, Hattie Sutton (Leila Mimmack), travels on her journey to appear as the town's symbol of new life.|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} Monday, Marsha {{is having}} a discussion with her friend Sheila Klein about Bill, a man that Marsha slept with the previous night. When the package arrives at the door, the two struggle to open the box while Waldo <b>waits</b> <b>excitedly</b> inside. Unable to open the box by other means and frustrated, Marsha retrieves a sheet metal cutter from her basement and gives it to Sheila, who stabs straight through the box as well as Waldo's head.|$|R
50|$|Ponyo and Sōsuke {{head into}} a tunnel, where Ponyo reverts {{to being a}} fish due to overuse of her magical powers. Meanwhile, Lisa and the {{residents}} of the nursing home, temporarily granted the power to breathe underwater by Granmamare, are <b>waiting</b> <b>excitedly</b> below the surface for Ponyo and Sōsuke to arrive. Sōsuke and Ponyo encounter Fujimoto, who warns the boy that the balance of nature is in danger and begs Sosuke to return Ponyo to him. Sōsuke doubts Fujimoto and attempts to flee, but the two children are quickly captured and Fujimoto takes them down to the protected nursing home.|$|R

5000|$|After Ted {{prevents}} {{a depressed}} Father Kevin (Tommy Tiernan) from jumping {{to his death}} at the [...] "It's Great Being a Priest" [...] conference, an American priest, from the USA called Father Buzz Cagney (Jeff Harding) asks him if he'll come to a parish in Los Angeles. Ted can’t <b>wait</b> and <b>excitedly</b> tells Jack, Dougal and Mrs. Doyle, who incorrectly {{think they will be}} able to come with him. Ted doesn't have the heart to tell them otherwise and brings them to the airport leaving them there while he gets on the plane. However, Ted has second thoughts when Buzz mentions the gang culture around Ted's new parish in LA, and its violent state. Realising he's in serious trouble, Ted abandons going to the USA and rejoins Jack, Dougal and Mrs Doyle. It transpires that the three of them never wanted to go to the States anyway, with the possible exception of Jack, who yells 'Feck!' when he learns of what's gone wrong, though the promise of a drink cheers him up. The group leaves the airport and heads for home, and Ted resigns himself to the fact he is probably never going to escape Craggy Island.|$|R
40|$|Since {{initiating}} {{market reforms}} in 1978, China {{has shifted from}} a centrally-planned to a market-based economy and has experienced rapid economic and social development. GDP growth has averaged nearly 10 % a year, the fastest sustained expansion by a major economy in history. States {{as diverse as the}} United Kingdom, the United States of America, Pakistan, Kyrgyzstan and Australia have all benefited from this transformation. Now, as this growth consolidates and slows, the nation looks to create policies that will ensure growth and stability for the future. Chinese leaders have unveiled a ‘foreign policy priority’, the One Belt One Road, an international treaty that seeks to supersede all previous trade arrangements. If successful, this policy will further integrate economic ties and increase the cooperation of states across continents. It has the potential, however, to create international economic and political tensions. As many (including Australia) <b>excitedly</b> <b>wait</b> for the implementation of the policy, others remain sceptical and even fear the outcomes China’s initiative will bring. This paper will discuss just some to the issues that this audacious policy, with the potential to revolutionise global trade, raises...|$|R
50|$|Iggy is <b>excitedly</b> <b>waiting</b> with a {{fatigued}} Jiggers in {{the center}} of Mooseknuckle. He tells Jiggers that Manly Boarman, a famous Australian explorer whom he has idolized since childhood, is coming to explore the Kookamunga, and that Iggy has agreed to be his guide. When Manly arrives, he is immediately swarmed by bees from the press, who are anxious to photograph him at all opportunities. When he lands after parachuting from his plane, he greets Iggy and Jiggers, who then proceed to lead him around the park. However, Boarman has not been exploring lately; being more caught up in his celebrityhood and public image. As a result, he has lost touch with nature, and repeatedly falls into scrapes with the wildlife and the landmarks. After narrowly escaping Mount Kaboom while hang-gliding with Iggy, Manly deals with the reporters once again, while Jiggers points out Manly's problems to Iggy. Iggy then decides to help Manly get back in touch with nature by taking him to Mango Tango Beach, a small beach where a flock of violent, stampeding flamingoes lives. When there, Manly's mother calls him on his cellphone, which alarms the flamingoes, who then proceed to run him down. As they are heading in Mooseknuckle's direction, Iggy and Jiggers make a fence all around their path, leading the flamingoes back to the beach. At the end of Manly Boarman's expedition, he tells them that he has been reinspired to get back to nature, and forget about publicity.|$|R
