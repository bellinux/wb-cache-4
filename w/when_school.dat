5|$|In 1969, Sanford became {{president}} of Duke University, a position he held for the next 16 years. That helped quell student unrest over the Vietnam War early in his tenure as university president. Addressing the protests of the 1970 Kent State shootings with tolerance, choosing to not call in police to clear the roads, leading to the protesting students going back to their rooms at night so that West Campus could be reopened the next day kept the campus calm during a turbulent spring. Shortly before his tenure, on February 13, 1969, 60 student members of the Afro-American Society had occupied Duke's main administration center, the Allen Building, demanding {{the creation of a}} Black Studies program. After three days of clashes with police, they left the building peaceably February 16, <b>when</b> <b>school</b> officials agreed to the program. During his tenure, Sanford strongly opposed confrontation and a heavy police action which helped defuse racial tensions.|$|E

25|$|<b>When</b> <b>school</b> resumed in September 1850, the {{building}} was still under construction.

That fall, women were no longer allowed to attend, and George Chandler and James Read took over as teachers from Rev. Fisher. Due in part to low enrollment, both teachers left the following year and eventually Erasmus D. Shattuck became the teacher until a Baptist from the east could arrive, who was Rev. J.D. Post who started in early 1854. Meanwhile, {{the building}} was finished in 1852. After disagreements with the board of trustees, Post left the next year.|$|E
25|$|Pell did {{not finish}} the 1984 {{season with the}} team. Due to reports of serious {{recruiting}} and other NCAA rule violations by the coach and his staff, he announced in August 1984 that he would retire {{at the end of}} the season. <b>When</b> <b>school</b> officials received a list of 107 major infractions from the NCAA in mid-September, however, university president Marshall Criser fired Pell. Offensive coordinator Galen Hall, who had just arrived for the 1984 season and was not involved with the rule violations, was named interim head coach before the season's fourth game. Hall rallied his players after a 1–1–1 start to win eight consecutive games for a 9–1–1 record (including an undefeated 5–0–1 SEC record), all but ensuring that he would become the permanent coach after the season. The SEC banned the Gators from the Sugar Bowl, and LSU went in their place. Two weeks after the end of the season, the NCAA imposed two years of probation (a third year was suspended) and banned the Gators from bowl games and live television in 1985 and 1986. The most damaging sanctions in the long run were a limit of 20 new scholarships in 1985 and 1986 and a reduction to 85 total scholarships in 1985 and 75 in 1986. In the spring of 1985, the SEC university presidents voted 6–4 to vacate the Gators' 1984 SEC championship.|$|E

Templeton Secondary School was used for Smallville High's interior. During season one, the production team repainted most of Templeton in Smallville High's red and yellow and distributed large Smallville High Crows logos; {{so much of the}} school was painted that it adopted red and yellow as its school colors. The students became accustomed to the film crew (which had to shoot <b>when</b> <b>school</b> was in session), and when a class was dismissed the crew stepped aside so the students could move the equipment to get to their lockers for the next class.|$|E
500|$|The second Galaxy Game {{prototype}} {{remained on}} display in the Tresidder building until May 1979, when it was removed due to the display processor becoming unreliable. Throughout its time on display, it remained popular, with [...] "ten to twenty people gathered around the machines most Friday and Saturday nights <b>when</b> <b>school</b> was in session." [...] Pitts later claimed that by the time the machine was removed, it had managed to make back the original investment. After its removal, the machine was dismantled, with the computer parts stored in an office and the casing outdoors. The unit was restored in 1997 with a recreated display processor and put on display for several years in the computer science department at Stanford with two consoles attached for free use by students. Due to issues with space and maintenance, in 2000 it was moved into the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California, in the displayed storage section. In August 2010, the museum loaned the console to Google to be placed at their headquarters campus at the request of Pitts—who wanted the game to be played as well as displayed—due to a discussion with senior vice president Jonathan Rosenberg, who had been hired as a 13 year old by Tuck and Pitts in the mid-1970s to keep the machine cleaned. It has since returned to the museum as a playable exhibit.|$|E
