25|$|The Lorentz transformations have a {{mathematical}} property called linearity, since x and t are obtained as linear combinations of x and t, with no higher powers involved. The linearity {{of the transformation}} reflects a fundamental property of spacetime that we tacitly assumed while performing the derivation, namely, that the properties of inertial frames of reference are independent of location and time. In the absence of gravity, spacetime looks the same everywhere. All inertial observers will agree on what constitutes accelerating and non-accelerating motion. Any one observer can use her own measurements of space and time, {{but there is nothing}} absolute about them. Another observer's conventions <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>just</b> as well.|$|E

Nonetheless, he praised the compilation for highlighting [...] "the sheer athleticism and skill that propelled Carey’s early work. She took very simple songs—both in terms of arrangements and theme—rooted in pop, gospel, and R and turned them into feats of strength, granting them dynamism and drama with a voice that juggled power, clarity, and agility with ease".|$|E
500|$|GamesTM said [...] "It's one {{of those}} mixed-bag {{situations}} – flashes of genius and genuinely enjoyable moments of success, occasionally mired by unbalanced weapon damage, clumsy AI and the odd bit of unfair level design that requires astounding feats of memory". Eurogamer called XIII [...] "a flawed masterpiece. A game brimming with variety and a freshness lacking {{from most of the}} factory farmed franchise exercises that pass through our offices with crushing regularity". Game Revolution complimented the game's story, graphical style, voice acting and soundtrack, while criticising the gameplay as [...] "about as straightforward – and in some cases boring – as it gets for an FPS". Electronic Gaming Monthly scored the game 6.5/6.5/6.5: Joe Fielder, the first reviewer, said, [...] "You'd be hard-pressed to find a more visually stunning game than XIII", but complained that [...] "numerous frustrations pile up to make XIII more chore than thrill". The magazine's Greg Ford, who provided the third review, said that its [...] "style, cut-scenes, and story are all great, [...] the actual gameplay is pretty mundane"; he concluded, [...] "But if {{all you need is a}} solid shooter fix, XIII <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>just</b> fine. It has no fatal flaws, and the conspiracy-laced story should keep you going".|$|E

500|$|Paine begins The Age of Reason {{by attacking}} revelation. Revelation, he maintains, {{can only be}} {{verified}} by the individual receivers of the message and is therefore weak evidence for God's existence. Paine rejects prophecies and miracles, writing: [...] "it is revelation to the first person only, and hearsay to every other, and consequently they are not obliged to believe it". He {{also points out that}} the Christian revelations appear to have altered over time to adjust for changing political circumstances. Urging his readers to employ reason rather than to rely on revelation, Paine argues that the only reliable, unchanging and universal evidence of God's existence is the natural world. [...] "The Bible of the Deist", he contends, should not be a human invention such as the Bible, but rather a divine invention—it should be [...] "creation". Paine takes this argument even further, maintaining that the same rules of logic and standards of evidence that govern the analysis of secular texts should be applied to the Bible. In Part II of The Age of Reason, he <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>just</b> this, pointing out numerous contradictions in the Bible. For example Thomas Paine notes, [...] " [...] The most extraordinary of all the things called miracles, related in the New Testament, is that of the devil flying away with Jesus Christ, and carrying him {{to the top of a}} high mountain, and to the top of the highest pinnacle of the temple, and showing him and promising to him all the kingdoms of the World. How happened it that he did not discover America, or is it only with kingdoms that his sooty highness has any interest? [...] " ...|$|E
