25|$|The {{aircraft}} was assembled {{in a few}} weeks, but Caproni still had to find an engine and a pilot. He tried to solve the first problem by buying an engine built by the recently founded Miller company of Turin; the engine wasn't expensive and the Trentine engineer was glad to use an Italian-built piece of technology, because of his irredentist sentiments; however, the four-cylinder <b>W</b> <b>engine</b> proved quite unreliable and was apparently unable to run smoothly {{for more than a}} few minutes at a time. As far as the second problem was concerned, Caproni decided to have Ugo Tabacchi, a Veronese-born Trentine chaffeur who had recently joined Caproni's team, pilot the maiden flight of his aircraft. Although some licensed pilots (mostly trained on Wright aircraft) were already available in Italy, Caproni couldn't afford to hire any of them.|$|E

Even when there are four cylinder banks (that would normally require a total of eight individual camshafts), the narrow-angle design allows the use of just four camshafts in total. For the Bugatti Veyron, which has a 16-cylinder <b>W</b> <b>engine</b> configuration, the four camshafts are driving a total of 64 valves.|$|E

40|$|The {{continuous}} {{increasing demand}} {{on the subject}} of smooth operation, performance and fuel economy have led to the progress of existing engines and the development of advanced engines. 20 Cylinder is the eminence of engine design and it is the sign of opulence class vehicles.

The 10. 26 L <b>W</b> 20 <b>engine</b> provide the performance like sports and muscle car performance with 840 Nm@ 5000 rpm. The new <b>W</b> 20 <b>engines</b> represents a successive new <b>engine</b> phase. The <b>W</b> <b>engines</b> place excessive demands on design. Large numeral of cylinders was adapted to the exceedingly concise dimensions of the engine. In this process, more consideration was paid to lightweight of <b>W</b> 20 <b>engine</b> design. The engine is exceptionally smooth running and performance at high speeds and engine loads. For effective design computer fluid dynamics techniques is used such as eddy dissipation, direct injection and layering approaches.
