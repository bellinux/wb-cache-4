30|$|In summary, we have {{synthesized}} various silver/aluminum-co-doped ZnO NWs on sapphire substrates by hot-walled {{pulsed laser}} deposition with Au catalysts. The XPS data of 1 [*]at.% SAZO NWs show Ag 2 -Al metallic bond. This means that this condition generates Ag-Al metal compound which {{acts as an}} interstitial defect in ZnO NWs. Therefore, 1 [*]at.% SAZO NWs have only one peak at 3.359 [*]eV which originated from the D 0 X. However, new peaks of 3 and 5 [*]at.% SAZO NWs located at 3.355 and 3.356 [*]eV originated from the exciton bound to neutral acceptors.

One facet of this trend are data from legislative bodies, including records and archived transcripts of plenary sessions as a measure of transparency and accountability.

30|$|Only {{a limited}} number of {{articles}} have been published in peri-implant dehiscence coverage [1, 2]. Most of the cases involved autogenous mucosal graft. A conventional CPF using vertical releasing incisions (VRIs) in combination with SCTG has been considered to be a major treatment option in peri-implant dehiscence coverage. However, VRIs have risks with esthetic disturbance and post-operative course. Therefore, we previously reported a technique with coronary positioned envelope flap using SCTG [8]. The CPF with envelope technique has the advantages of increasing keratinized mucosa, a better post-operative course, and a more positive esthetic evaluation such as scars after healing than CPF with VRIs [9]. In contrast, coronary positioning of flap is difficult in cases with scarring recipient mucosa and multi-implant recession due to less flap mobility. In such cases, additional semilunar incision is useful in improving the flap mobility. Coronary-anchored suture (CAS) <b>facilitates</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> space for insertion of connective tissue and to fix the position of CPF. Since reduction of micromotion during healing period influences graft survival, CAS may be useful in envelope and tunneling techniques. Further studies are needed to evaluate the usefulness of this technique.|$|R
40|$|This paper empirically {{shows that}} the effect of {{applying}} selected feature subsets on machine learning techniques significantly improves the accuracy for solar power prediction. Experiments are performed using five well-known wrapper feature selection methods to obtain the solar power prediction accuracy of machine learning techniques with selected feature subsets. For all the experiments, the machine learning techniques, namely, least median square (LMS), multilayer perceptron (MLP), and support vector machine (SVM), are used. Afterwards, these results are compared with the solar power prediction accuracy of those same machine leaning techniques (i. e., LMS, MLP, and SVM) but without applying feature selection methods (WAFS). Experiments are carried out using reliable and real life historical meteorological data. The comparison between the results clearly shows that LMS, MLP, and SVM provide better prediction accuracy (i. e., reduced MAE and MASE) with selected feature subsets than without selected feature subsets. Experimental results of this paper <b>facilitate</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a concrete verdict that providing more attention and effort towards the feature subset selection aspect (e. g., selected feature subsets on prediction accuracy which is investigated in this paper) can significantly contribute to improve the accuracy of solar power prediction...|$|R

40|$|Randomization enables reuse, {{minimizes}} {{the chance of}} error, and minimizes user time. Randomization is applicable in problem solving techniques such as searching and optimization. With the emergence of service oriented architectures (SOAs), building software by composing existing components has been <b>facilitated</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> use of components across the Internet. Such facilitation has scaled up the corresponding problem search space from tens of components in the local component repository to {{hundreds or thousands of}} components available anywhere connected by a network. In order to search for the right composites in a large search space, randomization can be used to heuristically reduce the search time. This paper demonstrates, for the software engineering community, how randomization can be applied using granularization of context-free grammatical reduction for the automatic synthesis of component-based software using service-oriented architectures. The approach taken is to iteratively extract largest common component granules and form productions using these granules. The grammar is then written using the common granule components. We review the savings incurred by such randomization in searching for a solution. A theoretical analysis and a use case scenario are provided. Granules allow us to search the space using more formal parameters for a temporal savings of orders of magnitude associated with the symmetric granules. Granted that we can miss viable solutions in this way, the speedup however is too great to be ignored. Furthermore, given that there is a high degree of reuse between solutions, symmetric granule solutions work best...|$|R
40|$|The {{determination}} of kidney size {{is important in}} clinical field, because it can <b>facilitate</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> decisions on the management strategy. 1 Of several indexes of kidney size, kidney length was traditionally used because it can conveniently be measured using ultrasonography (US). However, considering {{the complexity of the}} kidney shape, kidney length can not appropriately represent kidney mass. Additionally, kidney length, as measured by US, is prone to interobserver variability and poor repeatability. 2 Kidney volume is a more sensitive index of kidney size than kidney length for the detection of renal abnormalities. 3 It is also excellent predictor of renal function and correlates very well with body indexes. 4 Furthermore, pre-transplant kidney volume is an independent determinant of the prognosis of the graft kidney. 5 Kidney volume can be measured by US, but it needs calculation using ellipsoid formulae of three-dimensional value of the kidney. 3 Moreover, the calculation using ellipsoid formulae tends to under-estimate kidney volume. 6 With development of more elaborate imaging methods such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT), measurement of the mass or organ volume has become feasible. The MDCT which generates 3 -D recon-struction images is particularly accurate in measurement of organ volume. 7, 8 In this study, we estimated the normal kidney volume of healthy young Korean men by using MDCT and evaluated its predictability of renal function and relationship with body indexes...|$|R
