25|$|Construction of <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>plants</b> and {{reduction}} of groundwater overdrafting {{appear to be}} obvious solutions to the worldwide problem; however, a deeper look reveals more fundamental issues in play. Wastewater treatment is highly capital intensive, restricting access to this technology in some regions; furthermore the rapid increase in population of many countries makes this a race {{that is difficult to}} win. As if those factors are not daunting enough, one must consider the enormous costs and skill sets involved to maintain <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>plants</b> even if they are successfully developed.|$|E

Faecal samples for Salmonella and Campylobacter were studied. Gastrointestinal, dermal and other symptoms were compared between 81 <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>plant</b> workers and 89 food-processing workers. The blood donors had more antibodies against all of the tested antigens expect for S.

50|$|In {{the postwar}} years Canadian {{municipalities}} began treating raw sewage, which {{up to that}} time, with a few notable exceptions, {{had been allowed to}} flow directly from their sewer systems into nearby streams, rivers, lakes and oceans. New facilities were added in Toronto including the Highland Creek <b>Wastewater</b> <b>Treatment</b> <b>Plant</b> in 1956 and the Humber <b>Wastewater</b> <b>Treatment</b> <b>Plant</b> in 1960. Vancouver built a number of sewage treatment facilities including the Lions Gate <b>Wastewater</b> <b>Treatment</b> <b>Plant</b> in 1961, the Iona Island <b>Wastewater</b> <b>Treatment</b> <b>Plant</b> in 1963 and the Lulu Island <b>Wastewater</b> <b>Treatment</b> <b>Plant</b> in 1973. The City of Ottawa built the Green's Creek Pollution Control Center (now Robert O. Pickard Environmental Centre) in 1961. In 1970 the City of Montreal began the construction of a large sewer network which channeled all effluent to the <b>treatment</b> <b>plant</b> at Rivière-des-Prairies on the east end of the island and became operational in 1996. By 1980, 64% of Canadians were served by sewage treatment, with the figure rising to 78% in 1997.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to investigate the impact on the quality of life of people living close to a municipal <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>plant.</b> A case control study, including 235 inhabitants living within a 500 [*]m radius by a municipal <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>plant</b> (cases) and 97 inhabitants living in a different area (controls), was conducted. A standardized questionnaire was self-completed by the participants which examined the general health perception and the overall life satisfaction. Also, the concentration of airborne pathogenic microorganisms in aerosol samples collected around the <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>plant</b> was investigated. Significant risk for symptoms such as headache, unusual tiredness, and concentration difficulties was recorded and an increased possibility for respiratory and skin diseases was reported. A high rate of the cases being irritable and moody was noticed. Significantly higher gastrointestinal symptoms were also reported among the cases in relation to the controls. The prevalence of pathogenic airborne microorganisms originating from the <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>plant</b> was reported in high numbers in sampling points close to the <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>plant.</b> More analytical epidemiological investigations are needed to determine the cause as well as the burden of the diseases to inhabitants living surrounding the <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>plant...</b>|$|R

According to the Pakistan Water Situational Analysis, there are three <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>plants</b> in Islamabad, of which only one is functional. Karachi has two trickling filters, where effluents generally receive screening and sedimentation. Lahore has some screening and grit removal systems, but they are hardly functional. In Faisalabad, there is a wastewater treatment plant, in which wastewater receives primary treatment, but it treats only 7 percent of the collected wastewater in the city. Multan, Rawalpindi and Gujranwala have no <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>plants</b> at all. In rural areas, wastewater treatment is nonexistent, leading to pollution of surface and groundwater.|$|E
