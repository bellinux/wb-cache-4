As recently as the early 1990s, MSU was last among the eleven Big Ten schools, with barely over $100 million in endowment funds.|$|E
5|$|The Neolithic age, {{which began}} in the Middle East in about 9500BC, <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> humans became farmers. This {{agricultural}} revolution embraced the development of monoculture and presented an opportunity for the rapid spread of several species of plant viruses. The divergence and spread of sobemoviruses– southern bean mosaic virus– date from this time. The spread of the potyviruses of potatoes, and other fruits and vegetables, began about 6,600 years ago.|$|E
5|$|Nara period Buddhism was {{dominated}} by six state-controlled sects. They were introduced from the mainland and centred around the ancient capitals in Asuka and Nara. These schools were generally academic in nature, closely connected with the court and represented a doctrine that was {{far removed from the}} daily life of the people. In 804, two Japanese monks Kūkai and Saichō travelled to China; on their return they established Tendai and Shingon Buddhism respectively. Unlike their predecessors both esoteric schools took into account the needs of the common people. Though their origins lay in China, with time they acquired local Japanese traits. Generally the 9th century <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> Chinese learning thrived in Japan. Authors produced a wide variety of works in Chinese language, including commentaries and treatises on a variety of subjects.|$|E

25|$|This period, {{known as}} the Spring of Arda, <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> the Valar had ordered the World as they wished and rested upon Almaren, and Melkor lurked beyond the Walls of Night.

25|$|Henry (1977) {{alluded to}} Maclean's {{model of the}} {{tripartite}} brain suggesting that the reptilian brain is an older {{part of the brain}} and may contain not only drives but archetypal structures as well. The suggestion is that there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> emotional behaviour and cognition were less developed and the older brain predominated. There is an obvious parallel with Jung's idea of the archetypes 'crystallising out' over time.|$|E
25|$|When {{asked about}} the 1992 film A League of Their Own, a fictionalized account of {{activities}} in the AAGPBL created by Penny Marshall, Lee said the film was about 70% accurate. In real life, the managers never entered the women's dressing rooms, she mused.

However, Díaz was elected and he became the first Hispanic to serve on the City Council and the first Hispanic to serve as Vice-Mayor of Phoenix. The last time that Phoenix had an elected city official that was Hispanic was in 1885, when Henry Garfias worked his last year as city marshal.|$|E

25|$|Reston {{experienced}} increasing {{traffic congestion}} as it {{grew in the}} late 1970s and early 1980s. This <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> Reston's population was growing but the Dulles Toll Road had not been built. Commuter traffic between Reston and Washington created serious traffic congestion on the roads that connected Reston to Washington DC. In 1984 the toll road opened, and in 1986 the West Falls Church Washington Metro station opened. Most recently the Fairfax County Parkway, a major north-south artery, was opened.|$|E
25|$|Ward's catalog soon was copied {{by other}} enterprising merchants, most notably Richard Warren Sears, who mailed his first general catalog in 1896. Others entered the field, and by 1971 catalog sales of major U.S. firms {{exceeded}} more than $250 million in postal revenue. Although today the Sears Tower in Chicago is the United States's tallest building, there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> Montgomery Ward's headquarters was similarly distinguished. The Montgomery Ward Tower, {{on the corner}} of Michigan Avenue and Madison Street in Chicago, reigned as a major tourist attraction in the early-1900s.|$|E
25|$|There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> {{this city}} had a {{circumference}} of 64 kilometres and the fort had 84 gates.

From the 7th to the 10th century, talented Jain monk/writer Acharya Haribhadra, Mundas Gani, Udayprabhsuri, Mahnedrsuri, Rajendrasuri and many more created here valuable Jain literature and sanctified and beautified this place. The temple of the 23rd Jain Tirthankar Parshvanatha in Hathi pole area is regarded to be very ancient. This temple has great archaeological importance. A golden idol of Shri Parshvanatha in Padmasana posture is the presiding deity.|$|E

25|$|The Age of Enlightenment {{was well}} {{received}} in Swiss cities, {{in spite of}} contemporary tendencies towards political conservatism. The early modern period <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> Swiss science and literature flowered. In Zürich the scholar and physician Johann Jakob Scheuchzer wrote about Swiss history, geology, geography and science. In Basel the Bernoulli family and Leonhard Euler worked on mathematics and physics, coming up with some fundamental concepts in these fields. Albrecht von Haller and Jean-Jacques Rousseau praised the natural beauty and unspoiled state of Switzerland and triggered an early wave of tourism (notably, Goethe's visit to Switzerland in 1775).|$|E
25|$|Dark {{skin with}} large {{concentrations}} of melanin protects against ultraviolet light and skin cancers; light-skinned people {{have about a}} tenfold greater risk of dying from skin cancer, compared with dark-skinned persons, under equal sunlight exposure. Furthermore, UV-A rays from sunlight are believed to interact with folic acid in ways that may damage health. In a number of traditional societies the sun was avoided as much as possible, especially around noon when the ultraviolet radiation in sunlight is at its most intense. Midday <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> people stayed in the shade and had the main meal followed by a nap, a practice similar to the modern siesta.|$|E

This left a mark on Gremlins 2. Gremlins 2 exaggerated what could be seen on cable television at the time, although as the filmmakers noted in 2002, that humour might be lost on present-day audiences. Cable television later grew to provide the same variety. Genetics in 1990 {{is reflected in the}} laboratory scene in Gremlins 2, and frozen yogurt is what the mogwai eat after midnight.|$|E
