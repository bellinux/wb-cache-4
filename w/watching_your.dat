500|$|The {{song was}} listed {{as one of the}} best songs of the year by several publications. The New York Times placed the song amongst the best tracks of 2011. Ology's JT Langley placed the song amongst the best of the year, writing [...] "Frank makes a foul mouth sound sweeter than your usual R through his brand of crooning, and Tricky Stewart's {{production}} adds yet another morose element to provide the more macabre side of the drugs-for-love-lost genre." [...] Pitchfork named the song the 41st best song of the year, musing that [...] "he might be fronting like the Drakes and post-"808s" [...] Kanyes of the world, but there's too much self-effacement happening for Ocean not to realize the inherent humor in his own drama. If Ocean really is on that visionary Kubrick shit like he claims, then [...] "Novacane" [...] could very well be his Dr. Strangelove. Zimbio placed the song at number 2 on their best hip-hop songs of the year list, writing [...] "while every track on his mixtape, nostalgia, Ultra, warrants a listen, it's the radio-friendly [...] "Novacane" [...] that stands out as his most mature and enjoyable song to date." [...] Spin named the song the fifth best of the year, describing the track as [...] "a fully evolved Drake song, where you're slyly immersed in youthful, aww-shit decadence, while simultaneously <b>watching</b> <b>your</b> dreams of recreational stripper booty and complimentary cocaine breakfasts get methodically dismantled." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{reception}} of the Arbiter's elimination as a main playable character in Halo3 was similarly mixed. Hilary Goldstein of IGN decided the change took away the [...] "intriguing side-story of the Arbiter and his Elites", in the process reducing the character's role to that of [...] "a dude with a weird mandible and a cool sword". Likewise, Steve West of Cinemablend.com stated that the one important event in the game for the Arbiter would be lost on anyone for whom Halo3 was their first game in the series. IGN's reviewer took issue with the poor artificial intelligence (AI) of allies in the game, and singled out the Arbiter in particular; [...] "The Arbiter makes me question why the Elites were ever feared in the original Halo," [...] Hilary Goldstein said. Describing the AI of the character, Goldstein felt players could [...] "enjoy <b>watching</b> <b>your</b> supposed equal getting shot in the face repeatedly and generally making himself utterly useless. What {{is the point of}} sticking you with an AI compatriot if all he's good at is respawning?" [...] The New York Times Charles Herold found that in comparison to Halo2, where the character played a central role, the Arbiter in Halo3 was [...] "extraneous". On {{the opposite end of the}} spectrum were reviewers like G4tv, who argued that the Arbiter was more likeable, not to mention more useful, as an AI sidekick instead of the main player. In a list of the top alien characters in video games, MSNBC placed the Arbiter at the number two ranking.|$|E
