Parker was eliminated with the slowest time in the Skills Challenge history with 50.8seconds. He previously held the slowest time of 45.5points during the 2003 competition. In the second round, Harris <b>went</b> <b>first</b> and finished the course with 39.6seconds, 3.1seconds worse than his previous attempt. Rose {{went on to win}} the contest by recording a 35.3seconds time while finishing the course with a dunk. Rose also became the first rookie winner of the Skills Challenge competition.|$|E

50|$|Next, players {{decide the}} order in which they play. The normal {{approach}} is for players to each draw one tile: The player who picks the letter closest {{to the beginning of the}} alphabet <b>goes</b> <b>first,</b> with blank tiles taking precedence over the letter 'A'. In most North American tournaments, the rules of the US-based North American Scrabble Players Association (NASPA) stipulate instead that players who have <b>gone</b> <b>first</b> in the fewest number of previous games in the tournament <b>go</b> <b>first,</b> and when that rule yields a tie, those who have gone second the most <b>go</b> <b>first.</b> If there is still a tie, tiles are drawn as in the standard rules.|$|R

5|$|Washington {{experienced}} some tax trouble with federal authorities, concerning the financial relationship {{between himself and}} his company. In November 1918, he contracted with the company {{for the use of}} his trade secrets in the manufacture of the coffee, and a month later gave a four-fifths stake in this to his immediate family. The Washingtons insisted that taxes needn't be paid on the family members' income, and the case <b>went</b> <b>first</b> to the Board of Tax Appeals, and then to the Court of Appeals, which in 1927 ruled against the Washingtons by a two-to-one decision. A petition to the Supreme Court was not accepted.|$|E
5|$|During the 1640s, when Charles {{was still}} young, his father fought Parliamentary and Puritan {{forces in the}} English Civil War. Charles {{accompanied}} his father during the Battle of Edgehill and, {{at the age of}} fourteen, participated in the campaigns of 1645, when he was made titular commander of the English forces in the West Country. By spring 1646, his father was losing the war, and Charles left England due to fears for his safety. Setting off from Falmouth after staying at Pendennis Castle, he <b>went</b> <b>first</b> to the Isles of Scilly, then to Jersey, and finally to France, where his mother was already living in exile and his first cousin, eight-year-old Louis XIV, was king. Charles I surrendered into captivity in May 1646.|$|E
5|$|Yasui waited {{nine months}} for his chance {{in court for}} appeal. During {{this time he was}} incarcerated at the Multnomah County Jail in Portland, and later sent to the Minidoka War Relocation Center in Idaho. When that chance finally came, the case <b>went</b> <b>first</b> to the Ninth Circuit briefly, but was then moved on to the Supreme Court. There the judges came to the {{conclusion}} that Yasui was still a U.S. citizen. After a few days on June 21, 1943, however, in Yasui v. United States, the court ruled unanimously that the government did have the authority to restrict the lives of civilian citizens during wartime, deciding the case as a companion case to Hirabayashi v. United States. Yasui was sent back to Fee, who removed the fine and decided that the time already served was enough of a punishment. Yasui was released and moved into the Japanese internment camps.|$|E

5|$|The {{trust the}} Archduke placed in Schmitt was briefly {{interrupted}} in 1799 {{when he was}} connected, by rumor, to the 29 April assassination of the French delegates to the Congress of Rastatt. The assassination occurred as the delegation was leaving the city. The official investigation into the assassination placed enormous pressure on Schmitt, {{to such an extent}} that he briefly resigned as Charles' Chief of Staff, but he was quickly reinstated. On 1 March 1800, Schmitt was promoted to Feldmarschallleutnant, but later in that year, the Archduke was himself replaced as commander-in-chief by Field Marshal Pál Kray. Although Schmitt remained on Kray's staff, he again requested retirement, claiming he was tired and could no longer cope with the stress of the job. In reality, he and Kray's Quartermaster General, Generalmajor Johann Gabriel Chasteler de Courcelles, seldom saw eye-to-eye on any of the main issues facing the army and Kray relied more on Chasteler than on Schmitt. His request was initially refused, but on 19 August 1800, Emperor Francis II approved the petition when Kray seconded it. Schmitt <b>went</b> <b>first</b> to Vienna and then Hostitz at Kromeriz, near Brno. There he lived with his old friend Ferdinand Ritter von Geißlern until 1805.|$|E

25|$|Weill fled Nazi Germany in March 1933. A {{prominent}} and popular Jewish composer, Weill was officially denounced for his populist views and sympathies, {{and became a}} target of the Nazi authorities, who criticized and interfered with performances of his later stage works, such as Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny (Aufstieg und Fall der Stadt Mahagonny, 1930), Die Bürgschaft (1932), and Der Silbersee (1933). With {{no option but to}} leave Germany, he <b>went</b> <b>first</b> to Paris, where he worked once more with Brecht (after a project with Jean Cocteau failed) on the ballet The Seven Deadly Sins.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} side stood Kazimir Malevich, Anton Pevsner and Naum Gabo. They argued that art was {{essentially}} a spiritual activity; to create the individual's place in the world, not to organize life in a practical, materialistic sense. Many {{of those who were}} hostile to the materialist production idea of art left Russia. Anton Pevsner went to France, Gabo <b>went</b> <b>first</b> to Berlin, then to England and finally to America. Kandinsky studied in Moscow then left for the Bauhaus. By the mid-1920s the revolutionary period (1917 to 1921) when artists had been free to experiment was over; and by the 1930s only socialist realism was allowed.|$|E
25|$|After another arrest, Bakırköy Psychiatric Hospital again {{found him}} to have diminished responsibility. He stayed in a mental {{hospital}} for treatment lasting about one year. Following his release, he continued with his murders. He killed three people and injured two more severely with a screwdriver in Çorlu. Late at night, he <b>went</b> <b>first</b> to the Çorluspor facility, and murdered nightman Hüseyin Yumruk with a screwdriver. Then, he skewered Özcan Karagözoğlu in an industrial zone. Finally, he killed Şakir Temüriçi, whom he met on the street. He threw the bodies in a hole. In the early morning hours, he went in Tonguçlar Mosque, wounded the imam, Salih Baş, in his neck with a screwdriver, and escaped.|$|E

25|$|Some Christchurch {{members of}} the ATS moved into Aramoana at about 6:00a.m. on 14 November. The ATS <b>went</b> <b>first</b> to Gray's house, passing bodies on the street. After {{clearing}} neighboring houses, they put a stun grenade into Gray's, blowing out the windows, followed by tear gas. Kicking down the door, they discovered it was empty. The group then worked down the road, checking each house, a squad {{on either side of}} the street. The ATS called up the AOS, with members from Wanganui, Palmerston North, Napier, and New Plymouth, to their backs. The group discovered Sergeant Guthrie's revolver in a garden, and a woman who had been hiding under a table for more than twenty hours.|$|E
25|$|Hoover {{departed}} from Washington in March 1933, bitter at his election loss and continuing unpopularity.

The Hoovers <b>went</b> <b>first</b> to New York City, where they stayed {{for a while in}} the Waldorf Astoria hotel. Later that spring, they returned to California to their Stanford residence. Hoover enjoyed returning to the men's clubs that he had long been involved with, including the Bohemian Club, the Pacific-Union Club, and the University Club in San Francisco. Hoover and his wife lived in Palo Alto until her death in 1944, at which point Hoover began to live permanently at the Waldorf Astoria.|$|E
25|$|Tyre, on {{the coast}} of modern-day Lebanon, was the last major Crusader city that was not {{captured}} by Muslim forces. Strategically, it would have made more sense for Saladin to capture Tyre before Jerusalem; Saladin, however, chose to pursue Jerusalem first because {{of the importance of the}} city to Islam. Tyre was commanded by Conrad of Montferrat, who strengthened its defences and withstood two sieges by Saladin. In 1188, at Tortosa, Saladin released Guy of Lusignan and returned him to his wife, Queen Sibylla of Jerusalem. They <b>went</b> <b>first</b> to Tripoli, then to Antioch. In 1189, they sought to reclaim Tyre for their kingdom but were refused admission by Conrad, who did not recognize Guy as king. Guy then set about besieging Acre.|$|E
