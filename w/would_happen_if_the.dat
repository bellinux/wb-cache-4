25|$|The first judge {{assigned}} to the case recused himself because {{he said he had}} a negative opinion of Miller dating to 2004 when he was Miller's judicial supervisor. Miller filed a preliminary injunction as part of the suit, asking that the federal judge immediately order the State to stop counting the ballots, due to irreparable harm that <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> counting continued, but the request was denied.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Lawrence grabbed {{attention}} from the television movie The Day After. The TV movie first appeared on ABC but was later shown in movie theaters around the world. The movie depicted what <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> United States were destroyed in a nuclear war. The movie was filmed in Lawrence, and hundreds of local residents appeared in the film as extras and in speaking roles.|$|E

25|$|On 3 July 2006 Shalit's captors made an {{ultimatum}} {{according to which}} they demanded that Israel must fulfill all of its demands by 4 July 2006 at 6:00am. However, the captors did not specify exactly what <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> demands were not met. The Israeli Prime Minister's office formally rejected the ultimatum. After the ultimatum period expired the Army of Islam group announced that no more information would be released about Shalit's fate.|$|E
25|$|In 1968 {{the family}} {{relocated}} to Bath, Ohio. Two years later, over a family meal of chicken, Dahmer asked his father what <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> {{bones of the}} chicken were {{to be placed in}} a bleach solution. Lionel Dahmer was, by this stage, concerned as to his elder son's placid and lethargic attitude and his solitary existence; therefore, he was delighted at the initiative displayed by his son towards what he believed to be scientific curiosity. He willingly demonstrated to his son how to safely bleach and (later) preserve animal bones. This knowledge regarding the cleansing and preserving of bones would be used by Dahmer on many of the animal remains which he continued to avidly collect.|$|E

25|$|It is {{possible}} that the unique effect can be nearly zero even when the marginal effect is large. This may imply that some other covariate captures all the information in x'j, so that once that variable is in the model, there is no contribution of x'j to the variation in y. Conversely, the unique effect of x'j can be large while its marginal effect is nearly zero. This <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> other covariates explained {{a great deal of the}} variation of y, but they mainly explain variation in a way that is complementary to what is captured by x'j. In this case, including the other variables in the model reduces the part of the variability of y that is unrelated to x'j, thereby strengthening the apparent relationship with x'j.|$|E
25|$|In reality, for MACSOG, {{the point}} was moot. Suspicions abounded within the {{organization}} that Operation Timberwork had been penetrated by communist dich van agents. The intelligence returns from the northern agent teams had been strangely lax and {{more than three-quarters of}} the agents inserted had been captured either during or not long after their arrival. The fact that SOG had slavishly followed the CIA's failed formula for three years was not considered a contributing factor. The unit was more concerned over Washington's continuous rejection of one of the original goals of the operation, the formation of a resistance movement by possible dissident elements within North Vietnam. Washington's stated goal in the conflict was a free and viable South Vietnam, not the overthrow of the Hanoi regime. The conundrum was what <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> program had succeeded. The best possible outcome would have been a repeat of the ill-fated Hungarian uprising of 1956, brutally crushed by the Soviet Union, and about which the U.S. could do nothing.|$|E
25|$|Juin {{became a}} {{prisoner}} of war, and was held in Oflag IV-B Koenigstein, a prison camp for officers in Königstein Fortress in Saxony. While in prison {{he was promoted to}} général de division. He was released in June 1941 at the request of Pétain, now the head of the Vichy Government, in exchange for thirty German sailors, as a specialist in North African affairs. He was promoted to Général de corps d'armée on 16 July, and became commander of the troops in Morocco. Admiral François Darlan offered him the post of Minister for War following the death of Général d'armée Charles Huntziger in November 1941, but Juin turned down the offer, saying that he only wished to serve in North Africa. On 20 November, he was promoted to Général de corps d'armée, replacing Weygand as commander of French land forces in North Africa. In December he led a French mission to Germany that met with Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring to discuss what <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> German-Italian Panzerarmee Afrika was driven out of Libya by Operation Crusader. This did not occur, but a dispute over what should be done led to Juin relieving de Lattre of command of the forces in Tunisia, permanently damaging their friendship.|$|E

500|$|All That Glitters was series creator Norman Lear's {{attempt to}} {{duplicate}} his {{success with the}} syndicated soap opera spoof Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman. Lear described the premise simply: [...] "God created Eve first, took out her rib {{and gave her a}} companion so she wouldn't be lonely." [...] Lear {{came up with the idea}} on a trip to Washington, D.C.: [...] "I had visited the Institute of Policy Studies, and I just loved the whole thing. And I thought there was a series in it—a five-times-a-week series: I went to bed thinking about that, and I woke up the next morning thinking what <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> male-female equation were changed? What <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> women had all the power and all the advantage, and the men had what the women normally would have?” ...|$|E
500|$|Although {{the product}} was not {{publicly}} released, many questioned whether [...] "Microsoft had lost its senses" [...] and {{the product was}} widely derided. Critics contended that the product {{was a waste of}} money and doomed to fail. Concerns were raised about how the iLoo would serve to extend waiting lines, how hygienic it would be to share keyboards in a public loo, and what <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> keyboard were to be urinated upon. Critics also questioned whether users would spend enough time in the loo {{to make use of the}} internet facilities, noting that [...] "most port-a-potty users stay only long enough to relieve themselves without having to inhale." ...|$|E

In addition, she felt her husband was too emotionally immature to be a parent, having watched his daily interactions with other people; she believed {{he was the one}} in need of parenting. Jackson explained to his wife over breakfast one morning that she {{did not have to be}} the biological mother if she so desired. He explained, [...] "My friend Debbie [...] said she will get pregnant and have my baby. If you won't do it, then she will. How about that?"

500|$|The episode's {{secondary}} plot {{takes place}} on Galactica. The copy of Number Eight that defected from the Cylons gives birth by cesarian section to a baby who she and Karl Agathon (Tahmoh Penikett) call [...] "Hera". However, President Laura Roslin, and her secretary, Tory Foster, and Dr. Cottle conspire to fake Hera's death fearing what <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> Cylons knew the child lived. President Roslin also did not want Hera to be raised by her Cylon mother, Sharon, whom she still does not trust.

500|$|Gaiman {{suggested}} they make an episode which centres on the TARDIS itself, {{which was not}} done before for the entire series since it began in 1963. The original plan focused {{on the idea of}} the Doctor being pursued by an enemy inside the TARDIS, but went through several subsequent changes; Gaiman changed the plan to focus on the companion due to the Doctor's knowledge of his ship making it too easy for him to escape his enemy, made the TARDIS the threat rather than just a specific alien to avoid making it a simple 'cat-and-mouse' game, and then included the idea of Idris to account for what happened to the TARDIS's mind during this attack. The central idea was a [...] "what if" [...] scenario to see what <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> Doctor and the TARDIS got to talk together. Head writer Steven Moffat liked the idea of featuring the TARDIS as a woman, believing this to be the [...] "ultimate love story" [...] for the Doctor.|$|E
500|$|The {{first series}} of {{promotions}} in the United Kingdom adopted the strapline [...] "What if...?", and explored various [...] "dream-like" [...] scenarios. The first television campaign explicitly introduced {{the premise of}} the campaign by asking what <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> world's favourite word (Okay) was replaced with [...] "What if?". The next few pieces of the campaign, [...] "Pecking Order", [...] "Seats", and [...] "Bus Lane" [...] for television and [...] "Doodle", [...] "Big Grin", and [...] "Oblonger" [...] for radio, became progressively more surreal, and featured oddities ranging from a traffic cone draped in leopard fur to trees growing traffic lights from their branches. In 2002, Matt Gooden, a creative director, and Ben Walker, a copywriter, proposed a new television and cinema advertisement to promote the seventh-generation Honda Accord line that had recently been rolled out in Europe and Japan. The advertisement, based on a complex chain reaction of moving parts from the Accord itself, was approved and given the working title [...] "Cog".|$|E

Each chapter starts with a basic premise but speculates as well on related possibilities that could have influenced changes: for example, the one on San Martin questions as well what <b>would</b> have <b>happened</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> government of Chile fell, if a Spanish task force arrived to take Buenos Aires, and what stance could have the caudillos taken in those hypothetic scenarios.|$|R

500|$|The Giant saves {{two boys}} falling from a roof when he arrives, impressing the townspeople. Kent convinces Rogard {{to start an}} attack against the robot. The Giant exposes his weapons again, and readily overpowers the {{military}}. Dean and Hogarth arrive and calm the Giant, but the military continues to fight him. Hogarth is knocked unconscious, and the Giant, believing Hogarth to be dead, reengages his attacks. Kent convinces Rogard to prepare to launch a nuclear missile from the USS Nautilus offshore if they cannot stop it. Dean and Annie revive Hogarth, and the he helps return the Giant to his docile state, while Dean explains the situation to the military. Rogard is ready to stand down when Kent panics and orders the missile launch. Rogard furiously reminds Kent that the missile is locked onto the Giant's current position and they will all be killed in the blast radius. Kent tries to escape but the Giant stops him, and Rogard's men secure him. Hogarth explains to the Giant what <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> missile strikes. The Giant says farewell to Hogarth and flies off to intercept the missile, saying, [...] "Superman" [...] just before collision. The missile explodes harmlessly in the atmosphere. As the townspeople and military are relieved to be alive, Hogarth is saddened by the robot's apparent destruction.|$|E
