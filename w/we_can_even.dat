A man with a world-view, he seized the opportunity provided by [...] to underscore his thoughts on the common destiny of humanity." [...] Fourteen years later, another Times reviewer, Clive Barnes, called the musical [...] "unsophisticated and untroubled. [...] Even its shadows are lightened with a laugh or a sweetly sentimental tear... <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>even</b> be persuaded to take death as a happy ending".|$|E
500|$|In {{the winter}} of 1916–17 Cardus {{continued}} his private studies while working intermittently; among various jobs, he collected insurance premiums for a burial society. Early in January 1917 he wrote to C. P. Scott, The Manchester Guardians editor, asking for any available post at the paper, as [...] "the means whereby to continue my education". To bolster his chances he enclosed specimens of his writing. The result was, first, a temporary unpaid position as Scott's secretary, but in mid-March Scott offered a job on the paper's reporting staff. The writer J. B. Priestley later asserted that Cardus, {{who did not know}} shorthand, was engaged not as a reporter, but as a [...] "writer". In Cardus's own account of these years he appears to have been fully engaged in reporters' duties, his lack of shorthand being dismissed by the chief reporter, Haslam Mills, who paraphrased Shakespeare: [...] "Some men are born to shorthand, others achieve shorthand, while others have shorthand thrust upon them". Mills advised Cardus to concentrate on style: [...] "We can be decorative at times; <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>even</b> be amusing. Here, possibly, you will find scope".|$|E
500|$|In January 2007, Brunner {{proposed}} {{a plan that}} would allow counties to recruit poll workers by mail, who would then undertake two paid training days, and work a paid eight-hour shift at the polls on Election Day. Brunner explained the plan in an interview: [...] "In terms of Ohio and what happened in the 2004 presidential election, there has been a crisis in confidence in our election system in Ohio, both nationally and in our state. One of the quickest ways to repair that {{is to make sure that}} we have adequate numbers of poll workers. ... We suggested this as one tool that the boards of elections would have available to them for recruiting poll workers. We would be looking to do this similar to how we recruit jurors, only jurors are recruited for two weeks of service whereas we'd only be asking for three days. It would also allow us to offer split shifts to poll workers. In Ohio the polling places are open for thirteen hours, so essentially a poll worker works at least fourteen hours; with the average age of our poll workers at 72, that's a tough day for anyone, no matter what their age is. ... It's an option, and <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>even</b> include a trigger, so that a county has to be deficient by a certain percentage of poll workers to even be able to use this." [...] In the initial proposal it was not yet decided what wages would be paid, and whether refusing recruitment would result in penalties. The proposal will be decided by the Ohio General Assembly.|$|E

2500|$|Later Sarfraz {{insisted that}} Woolmer's {{death in a}} Kingston hotel on 18 March was linked to match fixing and {{extended}} his help to track the gang of bookies. [...] "I know five bookies {{made their way to}} the West Indies. I can help trace them. Perhaps <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>even</b> get some clues from the players", Sarfraz told The Sun, adding [...] "Woolmer's death is connected with the match-fixing mafia.". [...] "I believe the Pakistan World Cup games were fixed. There is a dark side to cricket. The game got on top of it for a while but it has never really been stamped out," [...] he said. Scotland Yard, later, declared that no foul play was involved in Woolmer's death, rejecting Sarfraz's allegations and vindicating the Pakistani team.|$|E

2500|$|The {{essential}} {{point of}} this exercise is often missed.

Everybody understands what we mean when we talk about playing a game, and <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>even</b> clearly identify and correct inaccurate uses of the word, all without reference to any definition that consists of necessary and sufficient conditions for the application of the concept of a game.
