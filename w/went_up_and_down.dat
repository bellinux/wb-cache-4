25|$|After {{his return}} to the United States in 1910, Harold Weston was {{stricken}} by polio. His left leg was paralyzed. But Weston refused to take the advice of doctors who declared that he would never walk again. Through a regime of physical conditioning and the use of leg braces and a cane, Weston learned how to walk (albeit with a pronounced limp). He began to hike, clinging to trees as he <b>went</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> hill.|$|E
25|$|Out of {{bankruptcy}} in April 1921, {{the operation was}} on a much smaller scale than before the 1917 bust. The amount quarried was greatly reduced and experienced several fluctuations in output and changes in operators. The fortunes of the town also <b>went</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> with the marble fluctuation as reflected by the changes in population by climbing to 600 by 1926, 550 as 1930, then dropping to 175 by 1933 with a rise to 225 from 1939 and into 1941.|$|E

Trucks and buses were arranged to carry children and the elderly. The victims {{were told that they}} were being relocated, and were advised to bring up to [...] of possessions. The first day of executions, 30 November 1941, began with the perpetrators rousing and assembling the victims at 4:00am. The victims were moved in columns of a thousand people toward the execution ground. As they walked, some SS men <b>went</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> the line, shooting people who could not keep up the pace or who tried to run away or rest.|$|E
500|$|The seventh stage {{included}} {{the most significant}} summit finish of the race so far. The route started in Jódar and travelled [...] to La Alpujarra. The route was generally south, looping around {{the western part of}} the Sierra Nevada and finishing on the edge of the mountain range. The roads were up and down all day, though there were only two categorised climbs. The first of these was the Puerto de los Blancares ( [...] at 3.3%), the summit of which came after [...] The next [...] also followed roads that consistently <b>went</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down,</b> with very few flat sections. The final climb started [...] before the finish line and had an average gradient of 5%. This was the Alto de Capileira, which was rated as a first-category climb. The climb came in three sections: the first [...] climbed consistently; there were then around [...] of fairly flat roads; the final [...] were the steepest part of the climb, with sections of around 14% towards the top.|$|E
2500|$|Kamikaze: This was {{the more}} [...] "tame" [...] water slide near the Geronimo slides. It was blue in color and {{featured}} several drops and rises. Riders would lie on their backs with their arms and legs crossed and go down a [...] "chute" [...] which pitched steeply {{at first and then}} <b>went</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> several times before ending in a pool.

2500|$|The {{inclined}} plane had a journey time of 12 minutes for two boats up and two down, compared with 1¼ hours {{through the old}} lock system, thereby improving the speed of passage up the hill tremendously. During a 12-hour day, 6,000 tons (6,100 tonnes) of cargo could pass through {{the upper and lower}} level. Unlike the locks, where water flowed downhill every time a boat passed through, on the {{inclined plane}} almost the same amount of water <b>went</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> the hill. [...] Only the displaced water is moved, thus saving a great deal of water and giving better control of this vital resource.|$|E
2500|$|A {{general strike}} was {{ordered by the}} trade unions, the workers withdrew into their own districts of Triana and La Macarena and built barricades, but they only had a few weapons. The rebel troops (4,000 men) seized the nerve centers of the city, occupying the {{telephone}} exchange, the town hall and the radio station, and establishing control routes {{into the center of}} the city. On 20 July, the rebels bombed the working-class districts of Seville, and after the rebel troops supported by the troops of the Spanish Legion arrived from Africa, 50 civil guards, 50 requetes and 50 falangists entered in the Triana and Macarena districts, using women and children as human shields, and started a bloody repression. The legionaries killed with knives all the men whom they found. On 21 July, the Castejon's V Bandera of the Spanish Legion assaulted the districts of La Macarena, San Julián, San Bernardo and El Pumarejo. By 25 July the Nationalists occupied all Seville. According to the Queipo's press assistant: [...] "In the working-class districts, the Foreign Legion and Moroccan regulares <b>went</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> the streets of very modest one-story houses, throwing grenades in the windows, blowing up and killing women and children. The Moors took the opportunity to loot and rape at will. General Queipo de Llano, in his night-time talks at the Radio Seville microphone...urged on his troops to rape women and recounted with crude sarcasm brutal scenes of this sort.".|$|E
