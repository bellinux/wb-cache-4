I had no clue what I {{was going to do}} or how I was going to be scary. Until that is, they put the vampire makeup on me and I went into the trailer and smiled, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> creepy. Joss always said he was intrigued that someone who looked like me and talked like me was like the scariest vampire ever. That's what he wanted, my sweet voice and demeanour until all of a sudden I'm just this vicious vampire." ...|$|E
500|$|After Williams {{completed}} several {{drafts of}} the screenplay, the company hired Kevin Hood {{to aid in}} further script development. Bernstein believed that Hood's past work contained [...] "a romantic sensibility... There is a poetic quality about his writing as well as there being a rigorous emotional truth <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> important for Jane." [...] Hood was attracted to the film because he believed [...] "the story is such an important one and very much the inspiration for Pride and Prejudice." [...] Calling Austen a [...] "genius" [...] and [...] "one of the top two or three prose writers of all time", Hood thought that her relationship with Lefroy [...] "was absolutely essential in shaping her work." [...] Hood acknowledged however that Becoming Jane is [...] "based on the facts as they are known {{and the majority of}} characters did exist, as did many of the situations and circumstances in the film. Some have been fictionalised, weaving together what we know about Austen's world from her books and letters, creating a rich Austenite landscape." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{fact that}} Conrad would guest star on Family Guy was {{originally}} announced in October 2008. Creator Seth MacFarlane told Fox News, [...] "I {{thought it would}} be funny {{to see if we could}} get [...] to read very, very dense historical documents centering around the second World War, [...] Lauren did one scene where she had to read a paragraph on scientific self-analysis, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> funny." [...] The staff was impressed with Conrad's performance, saying that she [...] "took it very seriously." [...] Conrad praised her time at the show, calling it [...] "amazing", and said that [...] "they destroy me in it. I'm totally making fun of myself. [...] It was funny, I had to go over historical facts and like, biology and weird formulas I had no idea about." [...] Conrad explained that she is playing a character on The Hills, [...] "because America likes dumb people", and that [...] "The idea in the episode is that they make fun of me for being dumb, and then discover that I'm actually a genius, [...] It's a more exaggerated version of who I am, but fun to play." ...|$|E
500|$|Mitchell and Webb's {{next project}} came in 2003, with {{starring}} {{roles in the}} Channel 4 sitcom Peep Show, as flatmates Mark Corrigan and Jeremy Usbourne respectively. The show originated from writers Jesse Armstrong and Sam Bain's failed attempt to complete a team-written sitcom for the BBC; they had an old script {{that they wanted to}} revive and Mitchell and Webb helped out, with it eventually evolving into Peep Show. Despite low viewing figures (which almost got the show cancelled after series three) the show was received to wide critical acclaim. The British Sitcom Guide called it [...] "without a doubt one of the best sitcoms of the decade." [...] Ricky Gervais has been cited as saying [...] "the last thing I got genuinely excited about on British TV was Peep Show, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> the best sitcom since Father Ted". The BBC hailed Mitchell's performance in the series, citing that [...] "As Mark Corrigan, David reached out to all those middle-aged men in a twentysomething's body, who believe drugs are boring and systems are necessary if society is to function at all." [...] Mitchell has stated that he empathises with Mark and enjoys playing him and that he [...] "agrees with many of [...] opinions." [...] Peep Show has aired nine series, making it the longest-running sitcom in Channel 4 history.|$|E
500|$|For authenticity, several British and German actors {{portrayed the}} British sailors and Nazi soldiers, whose {{dialogue}} was mostly in German. Trevor Goddard, who portrayed the First British Crewman, is English, while Madison Mason, who played Captain Yip Harburg, is American; he affected an English accent for the part. William B. Davis' dialogue was entirely in German, a language {{which he did}} not speak. He later explained, [...] "I certainly didn't realize I was going to be speaking a lot of German until I got the script, which just said 'CSM (in German)'." [...] To successfully learn his lines, one of the German cast members recorded all of Davis' dialogue onto a cassette. Davis was given the cassette two weeks before shooting and phonetically memorized his lines; he noted that the method [...] "seemed to work pretty well—at least to non-German-speaking people! It was a little more challenging because there were some real German speakers on the show, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> a little unfair." [...] The only main cast member of The X-Files who already spoke German was Mitch Pileggi. Pileggi had studied in Germany; he had to re-write many of his lines as they made no sense {{in the context of the}} scenes. The tagline that usually appears after the opening credits of every episode, [...] "The Truth is Out There", was translated into German: [...] "Die Wahrheit ist irgendwo da draußen".|$|E

All of <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>were</b> terrific records and they all had a kind of character to them - a sound that was really trying to strip away some clichés, like why have a snare drum, why the backbeat? And just looking at the song and seeing what does the song need, what’s going to work?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Greg Graffin {{called his}} {{influences}} [...] "pop-sounding rock tunes {{that were not}} necessarily commercial." [...] Brett Gurewitz acknowledges attempting to emulate Germs singer Darby Crash early on in Bad Religion's lyrical style. [...] "He wrote some intelligent stuff, and didn't {{shy away from the}} vocabulary, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> cool." [...] In addition to their use of unusually sophisticated vocabulary for a punk band, Bad Religion is also known for their frequent use of vocal harmonies. They took their cues from the Adolescents, {{in the way that they}} used three-part harmonies. Bassist Jay Bentley says, [...] "Seeing The Adolescents live, it was so brilliant. So, in a way, the Adolescents influenced us into saying we can do it, too, because look, they're doing it." ...|$|E
2500|$|After quitting Island Records due to {{creative}} differences, Dobson {{decided to create}} a new album herself. [...] "Don't Let It Go to Your Head" [...] is also covered by [...] on their album Kiss and Tell (2008) and Jordin Sparks on her second album Battlefield (2009). Shortly after Sparks' album was released Dobson said, [...] "Jordin Sparks just did , which was on Sunday Love, which was very cool. She did kind of, like, a more R version of it, which I think is really nice, actually. It was really cool that she didn't try and do a rock version of it, and she did what she's more comfortable with, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> awesome."

2500|$|Initially, {{the studio}} wanted Gilliam {{to update the}} book for the 1990s, which he considered, [...] "And then I looked at the film and said, 'No, that's apologizing.

If it's an accurate representation of that book, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> an accurate representation of a particular time and place and people." [...] Terry Gilliam, while speaking to Sight & Sound magazine, highlighted if he had updated the movie to the 1990s it would just [...] "be a story about two people going to excess" [...] by keeping it set in the 70's, using {{the backdrop of the}} Vietnam War and a perceived loss of the American dream, offers reasoning to the characters actions.|$|E

The agreement is far more absolute than {{in other parts of the}} skeleton. In stating this, I do not refer to the relative thickness and length of the several bones; for the tarsi varied considerably in both these respects.

2500|$|After being {{identified}} {{by his father}} as the attacker, Brandt was ordered to undergo three separate psychiatric evaluations, all of which couldn't determine what mental illness {{he may have had}} or what motivated him to shoot his parents. One of Brandt's psychiatrists, Ronald Pancner, later recounted, [...] "Basically, I was looking for mental illness. And he wasn't showing the signs and symptoms of serious mental illness, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> what the court wanted to know." [...] Interviews with Brandt's family and friends showed that he had no conflicts at home or at school, and had previously shown nothing but devotion to his mother. Pancner and Brandt's other psychiatrists were ultimately unable to come up with any psychological reason for the shooting, later saying, [...] "We found no psychosis, no distorted thinking that would basically be a reason for this crime to be done." [...] Brandt spent one year at a psychiatric hospital before being released, and was never criminally charged for his mother's murder.|$|E
2500|$|In Kansas City Bomber Raquel Welch {{played a}} {{hardened}} derby star and single mother {{that tries to}} balance her desire for a happy personal life and her dreams of stardom. Life dubbed Welch the “hottest thing on wheels” for her role. The production of the film shut down for six weeks after Welch broke her wrist doing some of her own stunts. In the interim, she flew to Budapest and filmed a cameo in Bluebeard (1972) opposite Richard Burton. Although Kansas City Bomber was not considered a critical success, it vividly depicted gender relations in the early 1970s. In a 2012 interview with GQ, Welch reflected on the roller derby world depicted in the film: [...] "You have all those women out there, but {{the men in the}} front office are really running it. <b>Which</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> a really nice metaphor for the way a lot of women felt about their lives at that time." ...|$|E
2500|$|The album's {{release was}} preceded by two double A-sided singles. The first, [...] "King"/"Food For Thought", was {{released}} as UB40's debut single in February 1980. It topped the independent music chart for three months, reached number 4 in the main UK singles chart, {{and went on to}} sell nearly half a million copies, having been certified silver for sales of 250,000 copies in May 1980. It was the first single on a completely independent label without the backing of a major record company to reach the top 10 of the UK singles chart. Upon the single's release [...] "Food for Thought" [...] gained more radio airplay than [...] "King" [...] – speaking about the single in 2010, Bob Lamb said, [...] "'Food for Thought' was actually the B-side of 'King' originally: although it was a double A-side 'King' was always going to be the main song, but the DJs picked up on 'Food for Thought' because it was quicker and chirpier, more dancey, more of a radio track. So they played that a lot, and really that became the hit, 'Food for Thought', but whenever you bought the record it always said 'King'/'Food for Thought' – 'King' was always, like, the first name on the record, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> pretty cool." ...|$|E

2500|$|Eventually Clifford moved very close, with Johnson's tacit support, to {{the views}} McNamara held on Vietnam {{just before he}} left office—no further {{increases}} in U.S. troop levels, support for the bombing halt, and gradual disengagement from the conflict. By this time Clifford clearly disagreed with Secretary of State Dean Rusk, who believed, according to The Washington Post, [...] "that the war was being won by the allies" [...] and that it [...] "would be won if America had the will to win it." [...] He later recalled how he turned against the war: [...] "I found out that we couldn’t win the war with the limitations that we had, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>were</b> correct limitations, and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> all we <b>were</b> going to do was just waste {{the lives of our}} men and our treasure out in the jungles of North and South Vietnam." ...|$|R
