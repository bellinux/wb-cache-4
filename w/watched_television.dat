40|$|Background: <b>Watching</b> <b>television</b> is {{a common}} leisure activity, not least among older people. However, <b>watching</b> <b>television</b> may become {{difficult}} when it is disturbed by symptoms of de-mentia. Method: A total of 284 questionnaires were handed out to relatives of people with dementia in Iceland, in the Memory Clinic of the University Hospital and in specialized units for people with dementia (6 day-care units and 8 units within nursing homes). The response rate was just below 58 %. Results: <b>Watching</b> <b>television</b> was shown to play a less {{important role in the}} course of the daily life of people with dementia as soon as the symptoms of the disease became evident, and it increasingly became less relevant. So, this previous leisure activity left an ever-growing void of time to fill. However, <b>watching</b> <b>television</b> may provide an important social context for contact and togetherness during the progress of the disease, as <b>watching</b> <b>television</b> with someone close to them was important for the individuals with dementia. Con-clusion: It is not a viable option for people with dementia to <b>watch</b> <b>television</b> on their own, but they may enjoy <b>watching</b> <b>television</b> while sharing this activity with a person close to them. This may even provide quality time. © 2015 S. Karger AG, Base...|$|R
