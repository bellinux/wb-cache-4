5|$|Solar <b>water</b> <b>disinfection</b> (SODIS) {{involves}} exposing water-filled plastic {{polyethylene terephthalate}} (PET) bottles to sunlight for several hours. Exposure times {{vary depending on}} weather and climate from a minimum of six hours to two days during fully overcast conditions. It is recommended by the World Health Organization as a viable method for household water treatment and safe storage. Over two million people in developing countries use this method for their daily drinking water.|$|E

40|$|For the <b>water</b> <b>disinfections</b> {{practically}} {{four different}} technologies (chlorine, ozone, hypochlorite, chlorine dioxide) are used nowadays in the world. The oldest {{and the most}} exploited one, so called conventional, is the disinfections with gaseous or liquid chlorine. The biggest producers of the equipment for the water treatment in the world mainly possess all mentioned technologies for <b>water</b> <b>disinfections.</b> It is easy to concluded that the technology of <b>water</b> <b>disinfections</b> with the hypochlorite solution produced by the electrolysis of 3 % solution of sodium chloride {{on the site of}} water chlorination is not only the most convenient from the point of economical aspects, but also from the point of the ecological aspect...|$|R

25|$|Solar <b>water</b> <b>disinfection</b> is a {{low-cost}} method of purifying water that {{can often be}} implemented with locally available materials. Unlike methods that rely on firewood, it has low impact on the environment.|$|E
25|$|UV water {{treatment}} devices {{can be used}} for well water and surface <b>water</b> <b>disinfection.</b> UV treatment compares favorably with other <b>water</b> <b>disinfection</b> systems in terms of cost, labor, and the need for technically trained personnel for operation. Water chlorination treats larger organisms and offers residual disinfection, but these systems are expensive because they need special operator training and a steady supply of a potentially hazardous material. Finally, boiling of water is the most reliable treatment method but it demands labor, and imposes a high economic cost. UV treatment is rapid and, in terms of primary energy use, approximately 20,000 times more efficient than boiling.|$|E
25|$|Chlorine dioxide is {{superior}} to some other secondary <b>water</b> <b>disinfection</b> methods in that chlorine dioxide: 1) is an EPA registered biocide, 2) is not negatively impacted by pH, 3) does not lose efficacy over time (the bacteria will not grow resistant to it) and 4) is not negatively impacted by silica and phosphate, which are commonly used potable water corrosion inhibitors.|$|E

25|$|Disinfection using UV {{radiation}} {{is commonly used}} in wastewater treatment applications and is finding an increased usage in municipal drinking water treatment. Many bottlers of spring water use UV disinfection equipment to sterilize their water. Solar <b>water</b> <b>disinfection</b> has been researched for cheaply treating contaminated water using natural sunlight. The UV-A irradiation and increased water temperature kill organisms in the water.|$|E
25|$|A 2006 {{project at}} University of California, Berkeley {{produced}} a design for inexpensive <b>water</b> <b>disinfection</b> in resource deprived settings. The project {{was designed to}} produce an open source design that could be adapted to meet local conditions. In a somewhat similar proposal in 2014, Australian students designed a system using chip packet foil to reflect solar UV radiation into a glass tube that should disinfect water without power.|$|E
25|$|Chlorination {{remains the}} most common form of waste <b>water</b> <b>disinfection</b> in North America due to its low cost and {{long-term}} history of effectiveness. One disadvantage is that chlorination of residual organic material can generate chlorinated-organic compounds that may be carcinogenic or harmful to the environment. Residual chlorine or chloramines may also be capable of chlorinating organic material in the natural aquatic environment. Further, because residual chlorine is toxic to aquatic species, the treated effluent must also be chemically dechlorinated, adding to the complexity and cost of treatment.|$|E

5000|$|The Information Collection Rule {{required}} {{large public}} water systems to collect samples {{in the late}} 1990s to provide data for designing new regulations or revising regulations related to pathogen contamination in surface <b>water</b> and <b>disinfection</b> byproduct production.|$|R
2500|$|Ultraviolet <b>disinfection</b> of <b>water</b> is {{a purely}} physical, chemical-free process. Even parasites such as cryptosporidia or giardia, which are {{extremely}} resistant to chemical disinfectants, are efficiently reduced. UV {{can also be}} used to remove chlorine and chloramine species from water; this process is called photolysis, and requires a higher dose than normal disinfection. The sterilized microorganisms are not removed from the <b>water.</b> UV <b>disinfection</b> does not remove dissolved organics, inorganic compounds or particles in the water. However, UV-oxidation processes can be used to simultaneously destroy trace chemical contaminants and provide high-level disinfection, such as the world's largest indirect potable reuse plant in New York which opened the Catskill-Delaware <b>Water</b> Ultraviolet <b>Disinfection</b> Facility on 8 October 2013. A total of 56 energy-efficient UV reactors were installed to treat [...] a day to serve New York City.|$|R
25|$|Water purification: All {{water used}} for drinking, washing, or cooking should be sterilized by either boiling, chlorination, ozone water treatment, {{ultraviolet}} light sterilization (e.g., by solar <b>water</b> <b>disinfection),</b> or antimicrobial filtration {{in any area}} where cholera may be present. Chlorination and boiling are often the least expensive and most effective means of halting transmission. Cloth filters or sari filtration, though very basic, have significantly reduced the occurrence of cholera when used in poor villages in Bangladesh that rely on untreated surface water. Better antimicrobial filters, like those present in advanced individual water treatment hiking kits, are most effective. Public health education and adherence to appropriate sanitation practices are of primary importance to help prevent and control transmission of cholera and other diseases.|$|E
25|$|Irrigation is {{extremely}} wasteful of water because the distribution infrastructure is old and poorly maintained. In 1993 only an estimated 5% of required maintenance expenditures was allocated. Overall, an estimated 70% of the nation's water supply network {{is in need}} of repair or replacement. The quality of drinking water from this aging system is poorly monitored—the water management staff has been cut drastically because of inadequate funds. Further, there is no money to buy new <b>water</b> <b>disinfection</b> equipment when it is needed. Some aquifers near industrial and mining centers have been contaminated by heavy metals, oils, and sanitary wastes. In addition, many localities rely on surface sources, making users vulnerable to agricultural runoff and livestock waste, which seep gradually downward from the surface. The areas of lowest water quality are the heavily populated regions of the Chui Valley and Osh and Jalal-Abad Regions, and areas along the rivers flowing into Ysyk-Köl.|$|E
25|$|Ultraviolet (UV) {{light can}} be used instead of chlorine, iodine, or other {{chemicals}}. Because no chemicals are used, the treated water has no adverse effect on organisms that later consume it, as {{may be the case}} with other methods. UV radiation causes damage to the genetic structure of bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens, making them incapable of reproduction. The key disadvantages of UV disinfection are the need for frequent lamp maintenance and replacement and the need for a highly treated effluent to ensure that the target microorganisms are not shielded from the UV radiation (i.e., any solids present in the treated effluent may protect microorganisms from the UV light). In the United Kingdom, UV light is becoming the most common means of disinfection because of the concerns about the impacts of chlorine in chlorinating residual organics in the wastewater and in chlorinating organics in the receiving water. Some sewage treatment systems in Canada and the US also use UV light for their effluent <b>water</b> <b>disinfection.</b>|$|E
25|$|In rural areas, however, in {{a sample}} {{consisting}} of 1,630 analyzed systems, 59% do not disinfect the water because of lacking the necessary facilities {{or the lack of}} chlorine.

500|$|A major hurdle {{to achieve}} {{sustainability}} is the alleviation of poverty. It {{has been widely}} acknowledged that poverty is one source of environmental degradation. Such acknowledgment has {{been made by the}} Brundtland Commission report Our Common Future and the Millennium Development Goals. There is a growing realization in national governments and multilateral institutions {{that it is impossible to}} separate economic development issues from environment issues: according to the Brundtland report, [...] "poverty is a major cause and effect of global environmental problems. It is therefore futile to attempt to deal with environmental problems without a broader perspective that encompasses the factors underlying world poverty and international inequality." [...] Individuals living in poverty tend to rely heavily on their local ecosystem as a source for basic needs (such as nutrition and medicine) and general well-being. As population growth continues to increase, increasing pressure is being placed on the local ecosystem to provide these basic essentials. According to the UN Population Fund, high fertility and poverty have been strongly correlated, and the world's poorest countries also have the highest fertility and population growth rates. The word sustainability is also used widely by western country development agencies and international charities to focus their poverty alleviation efforts in ways that can be sustained by the local populace and its environment. For example, teaching water treatment to the poor by boiling their water with charcoal, would not generally be considered a sustainable strategy, whereas using PET solar <b>water</b> <b>disinfection</b> would be. Also, sustainable best practices can involve the recycling of materials, such as the use of recycled plastics for lumber where deforestation has devastated a country's timber base. Another example of sustainable practices in poverty alleviation is the use of exported recycled materials from developed to developing countries, such as Bridges to Prosperity's use of wire rope from shipping container gantry cranes to act as the structural wire rope for footbridges that cross rivers in poor rural areas in Asia and Africa.|$|E

40|$|A major {{objective}} {{of drinking water}} treatment is to provide microbiologically safe drinking water. The combination of conventional drinking <b>water</b> treatment and <b>disinfection</b> {{has proved to be}} one of the major public health advances in modern times. The quality of drinking water delivered to the customer’s tap is influenced by a number of processes; namely <b>water</b> treatment, <b>disinfection</b> and changes during transport of treated water via the distribution system. All natural waters and even treated drinking water exerts disinfectant demand due to the reactions with NOM and other constituents in water. Therefore, the applied disinfectant dose must be sufficient to meet the inherent demand in the treated water, to provide sufficient protection against microbial infection. Thus, controlling free residual chlorine properly is definitely important to ensure meeting regulatory requirements and satisfying customer needs.

At least 325 water-associated outbreaks of parasitic protozoan disease have reported. In this study, drinking water from treatment plants evaluated for the presence of parasitic protozoa. Water samples collected from two main points: (a) outlet of the water treatment plants (b) distribution system at different distances from the water treatment plants.

40|$|More {{information}} is {{needed on the}} disinfection efficacy of chlorine for viruses in source water. In this study, chlorine disinfection efficacy was investigated for USEPA Contaminant Candidate List viruses coxsackievirus B 5 (CVB 5), echovirus 1 (E 1), murine norovirus (MNV), and human adenovirus 2 (HAdV 2) in one untreated groundwater source and two partially treated surface <b>waters.</b> <b>Disinfection</b> experiments using pH 7 and 8 source water were carried out in duplicate, using 0. 2 and 1 mg/liter free chlorine at 5 and 15 °C. The efficiency factor Hom (EFH) model was used to calculate disinfectant concentration × contact time (CT) values (mg·min/liter) required to achieve 2 -, 3 -, and 4 -log 10 reductions in viral titers. In all <b>water</b> types, chlorine <b>disinfection</b> was most effective for MNV, with 3 -log 10 CT values at 5 °C ranging from ≤ 0. 020 to 0. 034.

Overall, disinfection proceeded faster at 15 °C and pH 7 for all water types. Inactivation of the study viruses was significantly different between water types, but no single source water had consistently different inactivation rates than another. CT values for CVB 5 in one type of source water exceeded the recommended CT values set forth by USEPA's Guidance Manual for Compliance with the Filtration and Disinfection Requirements for Public Water Systems using Surface Water Sources.
