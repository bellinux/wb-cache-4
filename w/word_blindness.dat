40|$|This {{thesis is}} in two parts. The first part is a {{critical}} review of some contemporary writing, {{on the question of}} the representation of blindness. The second part consists of two original stories, written by the present author, and both with important characters who are blind. Little attention has been paid in this country to the question of the representation of blindness. No substantial critical work has been produced since 1955. Images of disablement, especially of blindness, have been popular in the history of literature. However, in the case of blindness, such depictions have tended to falsify the actual experience of being blind. Common stereotypes of blindness are involved, or blindness is employed as a metaphor, and stereotypical interpretations of blindness are assumed. In other <b>words,</b> <b>blindness</b> has most often been a source, and not a target of metaphor. Most often, the stereotypical connotations of blindness are negative. Part I contains seven chapters. The first reviews earlier critical work, by the blind American novelist and critic Jacob Twersky. The second reviews briefly some novels, both literary and popular, written over the last forty years, with a view to assessing whether or not there has been any change in the depiction of blind characters in fiction. Chapters 3, 4, 5 and 7 present extended analyses of novels in which blindness does function as a source of metaphor, but in innovative ways. Chapter six focuses upon non-fictional discussions of disablement, both theoretical and autobiographical. A contrast is drawn between the real experience of blindness and its usual fictional treatment. The conclusion is that only in a few novels can we find blindness used as a metaphor in an interestingly innovative way, and in even fewer works is the experience of blindness itself the subject, and taken as the target of metaphor rather than as a source. Part II consists of two original stories. They suggest how blindness, and the concerns of blind people, can be treated in fiction in a way that avoids using blindness as a metaphor for an unrelated subject, and avoids stereotypes of blindness...|$|R
40|$|This study tested 2 main {{hypotheses}} {{for explaining}} repetition blindness (RB), a difficulty in encoding and recalling rapidly presented repeated words in sentences. Under 1 hypothesis, RB reflects an inhibitory process {{and should be}} more pronounced in young than in older Ss, who typically exhibit diminished inhibitory processes. Under the second hypothesis, RB reflects a failure to bind a specific connection: The second connection from the single node for encoding a repeated word is difficult to form under time pressure. Under this binding hypothesis, young adults should exhibit less RB than older adults, who typically require more time to form new connections. Results supported {{a version of the}} binding hypothesis but contradicted the inhibition hypothesis, and did not support hypotheses whereby RB reflects either a refractory effect or perceptual fusion of the repeated <b>words.</b> Repetition <b>blindness</b> (RB) refers to the reduced probability of encoding and recalling a word or letter because of prior oc-currence of the same word (or letter) in a rapidly presented list or sentence (see, e. g., Hochhaus & Marohn, 1991; Kanwisher...|$|R

40|$|Summary : Human {{echolocation}} by {{visually handicapped}} people. Echolocation, {{which is an}} active mode of perception, {{is defined as the}} ability to process acoustic information contained in echoes produced by the reflexion of self-generated sounds on the surrounding obstacles. It {{is important to note that}} almost all visually handicapped people spontaneously and intuitively generate sounds such as tongue clicks, snaps, hissings or vocalizations when they move around in order to gather spatial information. Also, this ability can be observed in any person who has had a brief but adequate training period. This paper describes the research that we have carried out to study obstacle perception through echolocation in blind people. At present, our efforts are mainly aimed to design critical experiments and to complete the ROUSETUS measurement system developed by us — which consists of the obstacle simulator, the ECOTEST and the auditory evoked potential modules — that will allow us to study human echolocation processes and its underlying psychoacoustic mechanisms in cognitive and behavioral contexts. Key <b>words</b> : echolocation, <b>blindness,</b> obstacle perception. Résumé L'écholocation est définie comme l'habilité à traiter l'information acoustique contenue dans les échos produits par la réflexion des sons produits par le sujet sur les objets de l'environnement. Cet article décrit quelques travaux récents conduits dans ce domaine et présente une orientation de recherche destinée à approfondir notre connaissance des mécanismes de base de cette capacité. Celle-ci est mise en œuvre de manière «naturelle» par les sujets aveugles.

5000|$|Although {{visual agnosia}} can be general, there exist many {{variants}} that impair recognition of specific types. These variants of visual agnosia include prosopagnosia (inability to recognize faces), pure <b>word</b> <b>blindness</b> (inability to recognize words, often called [...] "agnosic alexia" [...] or [...] "pure alexia"), agnosias for colors (inability to differentiate colors), agnosias {{for the environment}} (inability to recognize landmarks or difficult with spatial layout of an environment, i.e. topographagnosia) and simultanagosia (inability to sort out multiple objects in a visual scene).|$|E
5000|$|Pure, or phonologically-based, {{dyslexia}}, {{also known}} as agnosic dyslexia, dyslexia without agraphia, and pure <b>word</b> <b>blindness,</b> is dyslexia due to difficulty in recognizing written sequences of letters (such as words), or sometimes even letters. It is considered '"pure" [...] {{because it is not}} accompanied by other significant language-related impairments. Pure dyslexia does not affect speech, handwriting style, language or comprehension impairments. Pure dyslexia is caused by lesions on the visual word form area (VWFA). The VWFA is composed of the left lateral occipital sulcus and is activated during reading. A lesion in the VWFA stops transmission between the visual cortex and the left angular gyrus. It can also be caused by a lesion involving the left occipital lobe or the splenium. It is usually accompanied by a homonymous hemianopsia in {{the right side of the}} visual field. Multiple oral re-reading (MOR) is a treatment for pure dyslexia. It is considered a top-down processing technique in which affected individuals read and reread texts a predetermined number of times or until reading speed or accuracy improves a predetermined amount.|$|E
5000|$|Various {{disorders}} of the STS {{have been}} documented in which patients fail to recognize a certain stimulus, but still exhibit subcortical processing of the stimulus, {{this is known as}} an agnosia. Pure auditory agnosia (agnosia without aphasia) is found in a patients who can't identify non-speech sounds such as coughing, whistling, and crying but have no deficit in speech comprehension. Speech agnosia is known as an incapability to comprehend spoken words despite intact hearing, speech production, and reading ability. Patients show a recognition of the familiarity of a word, but are not able to recall its meaning. Phonagnosia is characterized as an inability to recognize familiar voices, while having other auditory abilities. Patients exhibited a double dissociation with either an inability to match names or faces with a certain famous voice, or to discriminate familiar voices from unfamiliar ones. Visual agnosia can be broken into separate disorders in regard to what is being recognized. [...] An inability to recognize written words is known as alexia or <b>word</b> <b>blindness,</b> while an inability to recognize familiar faces is known as prosopagnosia. Prosopagnosia has been shown to have a similar double dissociation as phonagnosia in that some patients show an impairment of memory for familiar faces while others show impairment when discriminating familiar faces from unfamiliar ones.|$|E
40|$|The Contribution of James Hinshelwood to the Comprehension of Acquired and Developmental Reading Disturbances – This paper {{describes}} {{the work of}} James Hinshelwood, a British ocular surgeon {{at the turn of}} the 19 th Century who analyzed a large number of cases of acquired dyslexia and then of develop-mental disturbances. Hinshelwood’s theoretical framework associates the developmental disorder for type (if not severity) with that shown by patients with pure alexia without agraphia or <b>word</b> <b>blindness.</b> During the 20 th century, the notion that the developmental disorder has a visual basis progressively lost ground in favour of interpretations emphasizing the perturbation of both phonological and lexical central processes.

40|$|The {{ability to}} enhance {{sensitivity}} to relevant (post) hypnotic suggestions {{has implications for}} creating clinically informed analogues of psychological and neuropsychological conditions and {{for the use of}} hypnotic interventions in psychological and medical conditions. The aim {{of this study was to}} test the effect of oxytocin inhalation on a post-hypnotic suggestion that previously has been shown to improve the selectivity of attention in the Stroop task. In a double-blind placebo-controlled between-subjects study, medium hypnotizable individuals performed the Stroop task under normal conditions and when they had been given a post-hypnotic suggestion that they would perceive words as meaningless symbols. In line with previous research, Stroop interference was substantially reduced by the suggestion in the placebo condition. However, contrary to expectations, oxytocin impeded the effect of the <b>word</b> <b>blindness</b> suggestion on performance. The results are explained in terms of the requirement for the re-implementation of the <b>word</b> <b>blindness</b> suggestion on a trial-by-trial basis and the need to sustain activation of the suggestion between trials. The findings contrast with a recent study showing a beneficial effect of oxytocin on sensitivity to (post) hypnotic suggestions but are consistent with findings showing a detrimental effect of oxytocin on memory processes...|$|E

The suggestion reduced Stroop interference in the short RSI condition (54 ms vs. 6 ms) but not in the long RSI condition (52 ms vs. 56 ms), and did not affect Stroop facilitation.

40|$|ALEXIA, as {{the term}} is used clinically, refers to an {{acquired}} inability to understand written language {{as a consequence of}} brain damage. In separate reports published in 1891 and 1892, Dejerine described two different varieties of alexia which he attributed to lesions interfering with the normal reading process at different stages. One type, which he called "pure <b>word</b> <b>blindness,</b> " was associated with preserved capacity to write and resulted from a lesion in the visual cortex of the language-dominant hemisphere coupled with a lesion in the splenium of the corpus callosum (Dejerine, 1892). A second type, alexia associated with agraphia, was shown to be due to a lesion of the dominant angular gyms (Dejerine, 1891). The alexia in this case he considered to be a variety of sensory aphasia in which "word blindness was more marked than word deafness. " These two basic types of alexia described by Dejerine have been confirmed repeatedly and have been maintained as distinctive, although sometimes under different labels, in subsequent attempts to correlate knowledge of the alexias (Benson and Geschwind, 1969; Hecaen, 1967). In 1904, Dejerine and Thomas reported a case of alexia with agraphia which wa...|$|E
40|$|This review {{surveys the}} {{empirical}} literature for assessments of learning problems in {{children from a}} neuropsychological perspective. An evaluation of children with learning problems must consider measures of working memory, attention, executive function, and compre-hension (listening and written), particularly for children who {{do not respond to}} intervention. These constructs must be tied to interven-tion techniques, and their connections must be empirically verified. The response-to-intervention (RTI) perspective provides excellent support for the process in young children but is still developing the process for students above the second grade. This review provides information about the existing research on neurobiological correlates of learning disabilities, possible areas for further evaluation, and the link to the RTI movement. Learning disabilities have been de-fined in various ways over time. Terms such as minimal brain dys-function, <b>word</b> <b>blindness,</b> and dyslexia were once widely used. The term learn-ing disabilities became popular particu-larly with the passage of P. L. 94 - 142 in 1975 (Goldstein, 1997). A definition proposed by the National Joint Com-mittee for Learning Disabilities in 1981 suggested that “these disorders are in-trinsic to the individual and presume to be due to central nervous dysfunc...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper was to track the history of {{learning}} disabilities and collect intervention theories which might be helpful for adult college students suffering from any number of learning disabilities (LD). There is a vast difference between a learning difficulty and a learning disability; an individual with learning difficulty can learn using conventional teaching techniques while LD requires specialized interventions which depend on the type of disability. The most common forms of LD are dyslexia-also known as <b>word</b> <b>blindness,</b> dyscalculia, dysgraphia, and short term memory dysfunction. LD can result from injury; it can be hereditary; it can come in many forms. Although it is no longer considered a form of mental retardation, it is now known that true LD is directly related to some type of brain malfunction. The study of LD did not originate in the 1960 s-as some people believe-but actually spans the time from Napoleonic reign to space age exploration. Scientists, researchers, and educators know quite a bit about LD now, but they still do not know nearly enough to help the multitude of individuals afflicted with those conditions...|$|E
40|$|The {{writing and}} reading {{disorders}} in stroke patients (alexias, agraphias and acalculias) are more frequent than verified in routine exam, {{not only in}} the less developed but also in large neurological departments. Alexia is an acquired type of sensory aphasia where damage to the brain causes a patient to lose the ability to read. It is also called <b>word</b> <b>blindness,</b> text blindness or visual aphasia. Alexia refers to an acquired inability to read caused by brain damage and must be distinguished from dyslexia, a developmental abnormality in which the individual is unable to learn to read, and from illiteracy, which reflects a poor educational back-ground. Most aphasics are also alexic, but alexia may occur in the absence of aphasia and may occasionally be the sole disability resulting from specific brain lesions. There are different classifications of alexias. Traditionally, the alexias are divided into three categories: pure alexia with agraphia, pure alexia without agraphia, and alexia associated with aphasia ("aphasic alexia"). Agraphia is defined as the disruption of previously intact writing skills by brain damage. Writing involves several elements - language processing, spelling, visual perception, visual-spatial orientation for graphic symbols, motor planning, and motor control of writing. A disturbance of any of these processes can impair writing. Agraphia may occur by itself or as association with aphasias, alexia, agnosia and apraxia. Agraphia can also result from "peripheral" involvement of the motor act of writing. Like alexia, agraphia must be distinguished from illiteracy, where writing skills were never developed. Acalculia is a clinical syndrome of acquired deficits in mathematical calculation, either mentally or with paper and pencil. This language disturbances can be classified differently, but there are three principal types of acalculia: acalculia associated with language disturbances, including number paraphasia, number agraphia, or number alexia; acalculia secondary to visual-spatial dysfunction with malalignment of numbers and columns, and a primary anarithmetria entailing disruption of the computation process...|$|E
40|$|Las dificultades de aprendizaje, entre las que se encuentran la {{dislexia}}, el Trastorno Generalizado del Desarrollo (TGD), el Trastorno por Déficit de Atención (TDA) con o sin hiperactividad, etc., han sido estudiadas y atendidas con especial esmero por una amplia gama de profesionales dentro del mundo de las especialidades de neurología, psiquiatría, neuropsicología, psicología y psicopedagogía, durante los últimos 20 años. A pesar de ello la dislexia sigue siendo un territorio lleno de controversias, ya que no hay un consenso interdisciplinario y esta falta de acuerdo hace que sea una fuente de confusión y desorientación para padres y docentes. Esto ha contribuido a complicar la relación familia-escuela, pues al evaluar a los alumnos de {{una manera}} no integral, el tratamiento que se realiza es un tratamiento desarticulado, en manos de especialistas diversos cada uno atendiendo al paciente de acuerdo a su especialidad. Este es el punto central de nuestro trabajo, es decir, que nuestro campo de investigación ha sido (después de haber analizado datos estadísticos que declaran la presencia en el mundo de casos de disléxicos), la evaluación y el análisis de los métodos ya existentes para la enseñanza a los disléxicos, subrayando los que según nuestro punto de vista puedan ser los fallos existentes en la enseñanza sobre todo de la lengua inglesa como L 2 (lengua extranjera). Para alcanzar este objetivo tuvimos que leer una amplia bibliografía de textos sobre el argumento que ya nos había atraído la atención durante nuestra estancia en Italia. Gracias a la colaboración del Instituto Europeo Leopardi de Milán que nos facilitó la creación de un corpus a partir de exámenes y escritos de los alumnos certificados como disléxicos, hemos podido profundizar en el análisis de los errores producidos. En este trabajo vamos a proponer una muestra de los datos ya que, como nos ha sugerido la profesora Isabel Fernández de la Universidad de Santiago de Compostela, experta del corpus CHILDES, idear nosotros mismos cómo transcribir el corpus de textos escritos por disléxicos de forma que pueda ser útil para seguir investigando implicaría otro trabajo diferente de investigación. Tuvimos, durante la redacción de este trabajo de investigación también la oportunidad de viajar a la Universidad de Palermo y consultar igualmente con la profesora Floriana di Gesú quien estuvo siempre dispuesta a colaborar con nuestra recopilación de una bibliografía lo más actualizada posible. A la luz de cuanto se ha dicho con anterioridad, los puntos desarrollados a continuación conciernen temas como qué es la dislexia, cómo reconocerla, las leyes existentes en Italia y en España que regulan la enseñanza y la evaluación de los alumnos certificados como afectados. Hemos elegido estos dos países para poder hacer una análisis contrastivo y averiguar que no hay diferencias significativas entre alumnos que aprenden inglés como L 2 si ellos proceden de una lengua neolatina como son el italiano y el español, lenguas bastante transparentes y similares en su estructura. Las leyes que regulan la enseñanza, por el contrario, sí que evidencian diferencias importantes, siendo España el país con más carencia de leyes para apoyar a los individuos con dislexia. Finalmente, dado el éxito obtenido en la aplicación de la metodología sugerida tras este trabajo, nos proponemos continuar el estudio y análisis del corpus lingüístico que poseemos con el objetivo de proseguir en la tarea de aportar metodologías adecuadas para mejorar la enseñanza del inglés como L 2 a hablantes de italiano y español en casos de dislexia evolutiva. En la parte final de la tesis hemos descrito los estudios que hemos realizado trabajando con los estudiantes disléxicos españoles e italianos para poder sacar conclusiones y datos estadísticos. El grupo en cuestión es de 60 estudiantes en edades comprendidas entre 8 - 20 años y con los cuales hemos trabajado por un periodo de tiempo largo (3 años) analizando los resultados cada 3 / 6 meses dependiendo del tipo de metodología aplicada. This investigation is focused upon and examines {{the experiences of}} students with dyslexia in higher education. At the time the research project started, not much was known about the experiences of higher education students with dyslexia. An insight into their lives and experiences with a further overview of their past is evaluated. The {{participants in this study}} were students studying for a degree in Higher Education, assessed as dyslexic. For data collection, individual interviews were used as it would be very difficult to describe experiences and feelings with group interviews. It’s more than one hundred years since Dr Kussmaul (1878 cited in Selikowitz, 1998; Beaton, 2004) mentioned the case of an intelligent man who had difficulties in learning to read. He called the problem <b>word</b> <b>blindness.</b> In 1896, Pringle Morgan (cited in Beaton, 2005) introduced into the academic and medical world the first case of what we nowadays call developmental dyslexia or Specific Learning Difficulty (SpLD). It was the case of 14 -year-old Percy who, although he was bright and intelligent, could not read even though he had received extensive and persistent training. At the time the term ‘congenital word-blindness’ was used (Beaton, 2004 : 3) to describe his difficulty. Since then, because of symptoms, a diversity of definitions and different points of view have been expressed to describe the ‘phenomenon’ of dyslexia because of the peculiarity of its symptoms. The term dyslexia has been accredited to Professor Rudolf Berlin (Aaron, Joshi, Gooden, Bentum, 2008). The former is more accepted and used by people with dyslexia and their families (European Dyslexia Association/EDA, 2009), whereas professionals prefer to employ the SpLD term (Riddick, 1996). The word “dyslexia” comes from the Greek prefix ‘dys’ and the root-word ‘lexis’. The former means ‘difficulty’ whereas the latter means ‘word or language’ (Ott, 1997; Hornsby, 1992). It can be best translated as ‘difficulty with words’. As mentioned before there is no a universal definition for dyslexia. Depending on the professionals’ field of study over the years there have been various definitions attempting to identify it. Dyslexia is mainly associated with language problema, such as reading, writing and Spelling, although people with dyslexia might also experience difficulties with vision, memory and/or orientation. Several studies have shown that dyslexia, when undiagnosed, can cause a lot of frustration and anxiety in the individuals involved (Riddick, 1996; Edwards, 1994). Dyslexia is a ‘hidden’ disability (Riddick, 1996) as there are no obvious external signs for people to recognize. It is not like some other disabilities, as for example Downs syndrome, or cerebral palsy, which people can recognize from the moment they see them. People can get confused and assume different reasons for a child’s poor performance in school. This is why, when not diagnosed, characterizations like ‘stupid’, ‘thick’, and ‘lazy’ are commonly used to describe students with dyslexia since people who are not aware about dyslexia, cannot find any other explanation for them not doing well at school. This study aims to explore in depth and from their own perspectives, the experiences of a quite small number of students with dyslexia and while giving them the opportunity to share their life experiences. Our research took place in Valencia (Spain) and Milan (Italy) with the support services of two higher education institutions (Istituto G. Leopardi; Istituto Longoni) which were contacted in order to find students willing to participate in this study. All institutions were in the same city, Milano. The study took place during the last 5 years and its aim is to try to portray a wider picture of what is happening at this time to student from upper school with dyslexia. Depending on the severity of their dyslexia, students may experience various levels of difficulty that can affect, in some cases, every single aspect of their lives. This is supposed to be the last step before going to Higher Education, where these studente will be far away from their families and will have no support or help. How will they manage? The first question we tried to answer going by their own experience was: “What are the current experiences of students with dyslexia?” In order to have a better and more interesting picture, this research will establish the particpants’ experiences from primary to secondary school by semi-structured interviews. This will give them the opportunity to express their thoughts and beliefs regarding any difficulties they have experienced while in education and how they have coped and what kind of support, if any, was available to them. Our specific questions were about learning English as L 2. Also, part of the interviews intented to explore any effects that dyslexia might have had on their self-esteem and social lives. The numbers dyslexical people are as follows: students with dyslexia since 2000 / 1 form the biggest group of people with disabilities: in 2000 / 1, approximately 32...|$|E
