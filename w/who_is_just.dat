25|$|Like many of Butler’s strong female African-American characters, Anyanwu {{is put in}} {{conflict}} with a male character, Doro, <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> as powerful as her. Butler uses this type of mis-match to display how differently males and females demonstrate their power and values. Since Anyanwu’s way, J. Andrew Deman notes, “is {{the way of the}} healer” rather than of the killer, she does not need violence to demonstrate her true strength or power. As Gant-Britton states, Anyanwu’s true power is shown many times during the story but it is definitely displayed when she threatens to commit suicide if Doro does not stop using her to create new species, making Doro submissive “to her will in the name of love,” if only for a moment.|$|E
25|$|The {{functionality}} is {{only provided}} via a public API, {{which can be}} used by any application to provide screen sharing functionality. Windows Desktop Sharing API exposes two objects: RDPSession for the sharing session and RDPViewer for the viewer. Multiple viewer objects can be instantiated for one Session object. A viewer can either be a passive viewer, <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> able to watch the application like a screencast, or an interactive viewer, who is able to interact in real time with the remote application. The RDPSession object contains all the shared applications, represented as Application objects, each with Window objects representing their on-screen windows. Per-application filters capture the application Windows and package them as Window objects. A viewer must authenticate itself before it can connect to a sharing session. This is done by generating an Invitation using the RDPSession. It contains an authentication ticket and password. The object is serialized and sent to the viewers, who need to present the Invitation when connecting.|$|E

500|$|Feminist author Germaine Greer called Glamour magazine's {{decision}} to award Jenner with a [...] "Woman of the Year" [...] award misogynistic, questioning whether a transgender woman {{could be better}} than [...] "someone <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> born a woman." [...] Jenner also received criticism from individuals such as actress Rose McGowan, for statingin a BuzzFeed interview that the hardest part about being a woman [...] "is figuring out what to wear". McGowan argued: [...] "We are more than deciding what to wear. We are more than the stereotypes foisted upon us by people like you. You're a woman now? Well fucking learn {{that we have had}} a VERY different experience than your life of male privilege." [...] McGowan later stated that she was not transphobic, and added: [...] "Disliking something a trans person has said is no different than disliking something a man has said or that a woman has said. Being trans doesn't make one immune from criticism." ...|$|E
500|$|Frank Langella {{was cast}} as Louis Zabel. His death [...] "ultimately leads the {{characters}} {{to discover the}} shady practices" [...] of James's bank. Susan Sarandon portrays Sylvia Moore, Jacob's real-estate agent mother <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> as consumed by greed as Gekko is, but in a different sense. Audrey, a [...] "tough, intelligent trader in the Wall Street trenches", is portrayed by Vanessa Ferlito. John Buffalo Mailer plays Jacob's Long Island financier friend, Robby and Eli Wallach plays the part of Jules Steinhardt, a Churchill Schwartz top executive and Wall Street patriarch who considers the current economic climate {{to be like the}} 1929 stock market crash. Pressman deemed the actor's role as the [...] "crier of doom," [...] who, [...] "reveals just how much more devastating things can be today." [...] Charlie Sheen reprised his role of Bud Fox, Gekko's former protégé, whom he meets briefly at a cocktail party. Sylvia Miles reprised her role as a real estate agent from the first film.|$|E
500|$|John Serba of Booth Newspapers {{said that}} Mars lacks [...] "the {{commanding}} {{presence of a}} superstar", in contrast, he gives nothing but consistency. Serba highlighted the production, which he found outstanding and diverse. Robert Copsey from Digital Spy thought the concert had avoidably [...] "long breakdowns and interludes". Fortunately, Mars' band added energy to those. Copsey, considered it a small imperfection [...] "in an otherwise stunning performance" [...] from a singer <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> commencing his tours and shows. The New Zealand Herald Bridget Jones dubbed the singer a [...] "showman", as he is not only able to write a [...] "catchy pop song and sing it impressively", but he also gives a pageant. Nevertheless, and considering his showmanship and prestige in the industry at this point, Jones disapproved of the [...] "comedic set pieces", which were brought from the previous tour. In his concerts during this tour every critic noticed and praised not only Mars abilities on the drums and guitar solos, but also the special effects.|$|E

500|$|Auditions for {{the lead}} role of Sarah began in England in April 1984. Helena Bonham Carter auditioned for the role, but it was {{ultimately}} {{decided it would be}} better to cast an American actress. Monthly auditions were held in the U.S. until January 1985, and Jane Krakowski, Yasmine Bleeth, Sarah Jessica Parker, Marisa Tomei, Laura Dern, Ally Sheedy, Maddie Corman, and Mia Sara all auditioned for the role. Of these, Krakowski, Sheedy and Corman were considered to be the top candidates. 14-year-old actress Jennifer Connelly was ultimately chosen to play Sarah after her audition on January 29, 1985, [...] "won Jim [...] over" [...] and led him to cast her within a week. According to Henson, Connelly was chosen as she [...] "could act that kind of dawn-twilight time between childhood and womanhood." [...] Connelly moved to England in February 1985 in advance of the film's rehearsals, which began in March. Discussing her understanding of her role with Elle, Connelly said that the film is about [...] "a young girl growing out of her childhood, <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> now becoming aware of the responsibilities that come with growing up." ...|$|E
500|$|In the 2006 NBA offseason, Olajuwon {{opened his}} first Big Man Camp, where he teaches young frontcourt players {{the finer points}} of playing in the post. While Olajuwon never {{expressed}} an interest in coaching a team, he wishes to give back to the game by helping younger players. When asked whether the league was becoming more guard-oriented and big men were being de-emphasized, Olajuwon responded, [...] "For a big man <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> big, maybe. But not if you play with speed, with agility. It will always be a big man's game if the big man plays the right way. On defense, the big man can rebound and block shots. On offense, he draws double-teams and creates opportunities. He can add so much, {{make it easier for the}} entire team." [...] He runs the camp for free. Olajuwon has worked with several NBA players, including power forward Emeka Okafor, and center Yao Ming. In September, 2009, he also worked with Kobe Bryant on the post moves and the Dream Shake. More recently he has been working with Dwight Howard, helping him diversify his post moves and encouraging more mental focus. In the 2011 offseason, LeBron James flew to Houston and spent time working with Olajuwon. [...] Olajuwon has also worked with Ömer Aşık, Donatas Motiejūnas, Amar'e Stoudemire, Carmelo Anthony, JaVale McGee and Kenneth Faried.|$|E
500|$|In another interview, Ehrich {{expressed}} more of {{his opinions}} on the storyline, stating: [...] "It’s so relevant now and it’s such an epidemic. Just {{for it to be}} out there to show that it happens. This is a real issue that needs to be addressed. To be a part of that, and to spread awareness feels so nice because I’ve personally experience bullying and I know many friends who have. Whether people’s reason behind it are good or bad, nonetheless, it affects kids to such an extent especially young, vulnerable kids." [...] Of the character's [...] "dark side", Ehrich stated: [...] "I love playing dark, but justifiably dark. It's never coming from a psychopathic place. First, he got obsessed with Summer, and that caused the bullying storyline, and now he's dealing with his parents' problems and possible divorce. Fenmore's issues come from a place that makes sense. It's interesting, because everyone around him is pretty much lying, and Fen {{is supposed to be the}} crazy one. Yet he's actually the truthful one." [...] He also stated that [...] "as an actor, it's fun to go out of control", saying: [...] "As an actor, it’s fun when you’re out of control, and you don’t even know you’re acting. Like, literally, you just escape. And I got to feel that. And I’ve had numerous times on this show where I’ve gotten to be out of control, and it’s a really nice feeling. It’s exhilarating." [...] He also revealed that he had been listening to the music of John Mayer and Bruno Mars to get into Fenmore's head space. Ehrich also conceded that he didn't want Fenmore to go [...] "too far", saying: [...] "He's a really troubled kid <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> trying to find his way in life. He's not evil. I don't think he's asking for too much except for some love and trust. He's on a journey—a long, long journey to find some peace." ...|$|E
