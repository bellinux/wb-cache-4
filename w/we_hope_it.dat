500|$|At {{the time}} of the series' end in August 2010, The Bill was the United Kingdom's longest-running police drama and was among the longest-running of any British {{television}} series. The series finale, entitled [...] "Respect", was aired in two parts and was dedicated to [...] "the {{men and women of the}} Metropolitan Police Service past and present". The finale storyline concerned gang member Jasmine Harris being involved in the murder of fellow member Liam Martin who died in the arms of Inspector Smith after being stabbed. Jasmine is then gang raped because she talked to the police and when Callum Stone found the person responsible he was held at gunpoint. Of the title for the finale, Executive Producer Johnathan Young said [...] "It's called [...] "Respect" [...] and <b>we</b> <b>hope</b> <b>it</b> will respect the heritage of the show". [...] The finale episodes featured all the cast and the final scene was specially written so all cast members would be featured. Following the final episode, ITV aired a documentary entitled Farewell The Bill which featured interviews from past and present cast and crew members. The finale was watched by 4.4million viewers, with Farewell The Bill averaging 1.661million viewers.|$|E
2500|$|On 26 October {{the head}} of the Indonesian Center for Volcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation, Surono, {{repeated}} his earlier statements that the greatest concern was the pressure building behind a massive lava dome that has formed near the tip of the crater. [...] "The energy is building up. ... <b>We</b> <b>hope</b> <b>it</b> will release slowly," [...] he said. [...] "Otherwise we're looking at a potentially huge eruption, bigger than anything we've seen in years". Surono also said that said the distension of the mountain's slopes was much more rapid this time around, indicating a higher-pressure build-up of gas and hence a much more explosive eruption and speculated that Merapi may erupt explosively, as it did in 1930, and not just eject gas as in 2006 eruptions.|$|E

The season's executive producer was series creator Stephen Hillenburg, who also functioned as the series' showrunner. During production of the previous season, Nickelodeon picked up a second season for SpongeBob SquarePants on August 31, 1999. The season premiered more than a year later, on October 26, 2000.

The fact is that the social atmosphere of Melbourne was not favourable to poets, and the worthy colonials seem to have shared Audrey's doubts as to whether poetry was a true and honest thing. It was not till Gordon won the Cup Steeplechase for Major Baker in 1868 that he became really popular, and probably there were many who felt that to steer Babbler to the winning- post was a finer achievement than 'to babble o'er green fields.' ...|$|E
