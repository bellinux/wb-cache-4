5|$|Questions {{were asked}} in the House of Commons {{about the cost of}} {{policing}} the statue, which required six constables a day at a cost of £700 a year. London's police commissioner wrote to Battersea Council to ask that they contribute to it. Councillor John Archer, later Mayor of Battersea and the first black mayor in London, told the Daily Mail that he was amazed by the request, considering Battersea was already paying £22,000 a year in police rates. The Canine Defence League wondered whether, if Battersea were to organize raids on laboratories, the laboratories <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>asked</b> to pay the policing costs themselves.|$|E

Initially the team who correctly answered the question also won the right to be the first team to get their question round, but was later dropped.

25|$|On Friday episodes {{which ran}} short, {{during the first}} season, a game was played with {{audience}} members for a small cash prize, usually $50. The game was played with regular panelist Brett Somers first. A word or phrase with a blank <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>asked</b> of Somers, and she would write it down on her card. Rayburn would then circulate amongst audience members who raised their hands to play, and if the audience member matched the answer Somers had written down, then they would win $50. Rayburn would continue picking on audience members until someone matched the answer. If there was more time left, the same game would be played with Charles Nelson Reilly responding to and writing down an answer for another audience member to guess. Rayburn sometimes seemed frustrated by {{this part of the}} show and with the answers given by some of the audience members; {{at the end of one}} episode, he was shown collapsed in one of the audience seats, seemingly exhausted.|$|E
25|$|A {{great number}} of {{pamphlets}} were issued by both sides, in which the contestants indulged in the most vehement abuse of each other. On 23 July 1713, Ashkenazi placed Chayun under the ban, because the investigating committee appointed by the Sephardic directorate had not yet made its report. In consequence of this measure, both Ashkenazi and Chagiz were subjected to street attacks, more particularly {{at the hands of}} the Portuguese, who threatened to kill them. In the midst of the constantly increasing bitterness and animosity, the report of the committee, which had been prepared by Ayllon alone, was publicly announced. It was to the effect that the writings of Chayun contained nothing which could be construed as offensive to Judaism. It was publicly announced in the synagogue that Chayun was to be exonerated from every suspicion of heresy, and on the following day a public reception was tendered him at the synagogue, on which occasion unparalleled honor was shown him. Naturally, the Sephardic opponents of Ashkenazi had found excellent support among the rabbi's adversaries in his own German congregation. The controversy was now waged so fiercely that even the family-life of the community became affected, and all peace vanished from the otherwise model congregation of Amsterdam. Ashkenazi was deserted, except for a few friends that remained faithful to him. When, finally, he was summoned by the directors of the Portuguese congregation to appear before their tribunal—which, of course, had no jurisdiction—he refused to do so, as he anticipated that he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>asked</b> to retract and to praise and recommend Chayun.|$|E

Abu Nidal believed that the group had been penetrated by Israeli agents, {{and there was a}} sense that Israel may have used the ANO to undermine more moderate Palestinian groups. Terrorism experts regard the view that Abu Nidal himself was such agent as [...] "far-fetched".|$|E

500|$|After resigning {{from the}} presidency, Suharto was hospitalised {{repeatedly}} for stroke, heart, and intestinal problems. His declining health hindered attempts to prosecute {{him as his}} lawyers successfully claimed that his condition rendered him unfit for trial. [...] Moreover, there was little support within Indonesia for any attempts to prosecute him. In 2006, Attorney General Abdurrahman announced that a team of twenty doctors <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>asked</b> to evaluate Suharto's health and fitness for trial.

She worked on the story idea with Reaves, and they expanded the story slightly from Reaves' original idea. One version of the script involved the Enterprise causing the birth of a new universe, with a play on the Genesis creation narrative.|$|E
500|$|The actual {{wording of}} the article was chosen by American diplomats Norman Davis and John Foster Dulles.

[...] Article 231, in which Germany accepted the responsibility of Germany and its allies for the damages resulting from the First World War, therefore served as a legal basis for the articles following it within the reparations chapter, obliging Germany to pay compensation limited to civilian damages. Similar clauses, with slight modification in wording, {{were present in the}} peace treaties signed by {{the other members of the}} Central Powers.|$|E
