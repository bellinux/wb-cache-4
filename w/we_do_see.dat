(In other words, the disparities shown {{are not related to}} retirement.) However, <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>see</b> the impact of gender and wage level. Because women tend to live longer, they generally collect Social Security benefits for a longer time. As a result, they get a higher net benefit, on average, no matter what the wage level.|$|E
500|$|When {{compared}} to the common Eurasian models {{of the development of}} civilization, Norte Chico's differences are striking. A total lack of ceramics persists across the period. The BBC observes that Norte Chico's people would have roasted their various crops, with no pots to boil them. The lack of pottery was accompanied by a lack of archaeologically apparent art. In conversation with Mann, Alvaro Ruiz observes: [...] "In the Norte Chico we see almost no visual arts. No sculpture, no carving or bas-relief, almost no painting or drawing—the interiors are completely bare. What <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>see</b> are these huge mounds—and textiles." ...|$|E
2500|$|Likewise, in {{agreement}} with Ottolenghi, the journalist Dan Rickman said that [...] "Shahak ignores [...] aspects of the sources. Further, through overstating his case, his analysis fits into anti-Semitic traditions of such accusations against the Talmud. Copies of the Talmud have been burned, and {{the text of the}} Talmud that is studied today is still heavily censored. Shahak's view that chauvinism in these sources in any way 'justifies' anti-Semitism is also very troubling. However, I do believe that his trenchant critique of Judaism is, tragically, not without some force. The contemporary situation is that <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>see</b> some modern Orthodox rabbis utilise xenophobic sources in modern rulings. Orthodox rabbis in organisations such as Rabbis for Human Rights are sadly {{the exception rather than the}} rule".|$|E

2500|$|What {{is going}} on? First, {{we have to}} remind {{ourselves}} that we have assigned a parameter (a natural number) to every variable xi. Second, <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>see</b> a successor-operator at work iterating y (i.e. the y'). And third, {{we see that the}} function μy yχ(y, x) is just producing instances of χ(y,x) i.e. χ(0,x), χ(1,x), ... until an instance yields 0. Fourth, when an instance χ(n,x) yields 0 it causes the middle term of τ, i.e. v = π( [...] x, y' [...] ) to yield 0. Finally, when the middle term v = 0, μy yχ(y) executes line (iii) and [...] "exits". Kleene's presentation of equations (ii) and (iii) have been exchanged to make this point that line (iii) represents [...] an exit—an exit taken only when the search successfully finds a y to satisfy χ(y) and the middle product-term π(x, y' [...] ) is 0; the operator then terminates its search with τ(z', 0, y) = y.|$|E
2500|$|However, <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>see</b> {{evidence}} for asteroidal space weathering. [...] For years {{there had been}} a so-called [...] "conundrum" [...] in the planetary science community because, in general, the spectra of asteroids do not match the spectra of our collection of meteorites. Particularly, the spectra of S-type asteroids, did not match the spectra of the most abundant type of meteorites, ordinary chondrites (OCs). The asteroid spectra tended to be redder with a steep curvature in the visible wavelengths. However, Binzel et al. have identified near Earth asteroids with spectral properties covering the range from S-type to spectra similar to those of OC meteorites, suggesting an ongoing process is occurring that can alter the spectra of OC material to look like S-type asteroids. There is also evidence of regolith alteration from Galileo's flybys of Gaspra and Ida showing spectral differences at fresh craters. With time, the spectra of Ida and Gaspra appear to redden and lose spectral contrast. Evidence from NEAR Shoemaker's x-ray measurements of Eros indicate an ordinary chondrite composition despite a red-sloped, S-type spectrum, again suggesting that some process has altered the optical properties of the surface.|$|E

60|$|On a railway, I suspect, {{what little}} <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>see</b> {{of the country}} is seen quite amiss, because it was never {{intended}} to be looked at from any point of view in that straight line; so that it is like looking at the wrong side of a piece of tapestry. The old highways and foot-paths were as natural as brooks and rivulets, and adapted themselves by an inevitable impulse to the physiognomy of the country; and, furthermore, every object within view of them had some subtile reference to their curves and undulations; but the line of a railway is perfectly artificial, and puts all precedent things at sixes-and-sevens.
