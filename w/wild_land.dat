5|$|Red deer have a stronghold on the moor {{and can be}} seen on quiet hillsides {{in remote}} areas, {{particularly}} in the early morning. The Emperor of Exmoor, a red stag (Cervus elaphus), was Britain's largest known <b>wild</b> <b>land</b> animal, until it was killed in October 2010. The moorland habitat is also home to hundreds of species of birds and insects. Birds seen on the moor include merlin, peregrine falcon, Eurasian curlew, European stonechat, dipper, Dartford warbler and ring ouzel. Black grouse and red grouse are now extinct on Exmoor, probably {{as a result of a}} reduction in habitat management, and for the former species, an increase in visitor pressure.|$|E

Three species are thriving on the islands today: mountain hare (Lepus timidus), brown rat (Rattus norvegicus) and the house mouse (Mus musculus). Apart from these, there once was a local domestic sheep breed, the Faroe sheep (depicted on the coat of arms), a variety of feral sheep survived on Lítla Dímun until the mid-19th century.|$|E

The National Trust for Scotland is the conservation charity that protects and promotes Scotland's natural and cultural heritage. With over 270,000 members it is the largest conservation charity in Scotland. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds promotes conservation of birds and other wildlife through the protection and re-creation of habitats. The John Muir Trust is a charity whose main role is as a guardian of <b>wild</b> <b>land</b> and wildlife, through the ownership of land and the promotion of education and conservation. The trust owns and manages estates in various locations, including Knoydart, Assynt, and on the isle of Skye. Trees for Life is a charity that aims to restore a [...] "wild forest" [...] in the Northwest Highlands and Grampian Mountains.|$|E
500|$|In Great Basin Kingdom, Arrington {{traces the}} Mormon pioneer {{practices}} of [...] "central planning, organized cooperation, and the partial socialization of investment implicit in Mormon theory" [...] {{to the democratic}} theory of the Founding Fathers of the United States. Arrington also noted that pioneers found religious significance in creating farms out of previously <b>wild</b> <b>land,</b> making irrigation central to their way of life. The way Mormons freely distributed irrigation water—through a central canal and diverted when needed—reflected their communal values. While the Mormon cooperative economy died out in the 1880s, their cooperative spirit anticipated later governmental planning. Great Basin Kingdoms thorough documentation called attention to previously hidden sources in the LDS Church Archives. Dean L. May and Donald Worster criticized Great Basin Kingdom for overreaching its thesis that organized irrigation could rejuvenate a culture. One biographer attributes Arrington's overvaluing Mormon achievements {{to a lack of}} empirical studies on pioneer settlements at the time. Still, the book was received as an instant classic that raised the standard for Mormon scholarship. Dale L. Morgan, though critical of the lack of attention to the Gentile (i.e., non-Mormon) influence on Mormons, said that it was an indispensable ordering of Mormon data. The book is still considered one of the significant books on Mormon history.|$|E

50|$|Faid was {{somewhat}} less successful in keeping its grazing rights in Cochem’s <b>wild</b> <b>lands.</b> About 1840, Cochem claimed that Faid {{had no such}} rights, and forbade the villagers to graze their livestock there. Nevertheless, they once again ignored an official pronouncement, and the village shepherd continued to graze his sheep in the <b>wild</b> <b>lands,</b> for which offence he was booked and subsequently penalized by the court. The village then decided to send a delegation to Trier to seek the old documents granting them grazing rights in the <b>wild</b> <b>lands</b> in the old Electoral archive. The delegates were turned away and told that the more recent Prussian administration had had all such documents transferred to Koblenz. No such thing was to be found there, however, and Faid thereby lost its grazing rights in Cochem’s <b>wild</b> <b>lands.</b> As it later turned out, no delegation had ever needed to go anywhere. In 1887 - somewhat {{too late for the}} delegation’s purposes - the document that had been sought was found - in Faid’s own municipal chest.|$|R

The John Muir Trust has stated that [...] "the best renewable energy options around <b>wild</b> <b>land</b> are small-scale, sensitively sited and adjacent to the communities directly benefiting from them" [...] although this does rather miss the point that onshore wind developments are required to meet large-scale, national targets not local needs. A small-scale scheme proposed by North Harris Development Trust has been supported by the John Muir Trust. A 2013 poll carried out by the John Muir Trust, suggests that 75% of Scots would like to see their wild areas protected from further development. Wind farm developers sometimes offer [...] "community benefit funds" [...] to help address any disadvantages faced by those living adjacent to wind farms.|$|E
2500|$|The Northern Sporades {{are one of}} {{the prime}} {{breeding}} areas of the Mediterranean monk seal (Monachus monachus) an endangered species. The main threat to Monachus monachus is man and his activities. Often deliberately killed or accidentally caught in fishing equipment, its food sources are declining also. In addition, marine pollution and uncontrolled tourism are causing the destruction of The seal's natural habitat. The establishment in 1992 of the National Marine Park of Alonnissos-Northern Sporades was an effort to protect this species by restricting human encroachment on seal breeding areas. <b>Wild</b> <b>land</b> mammals include pine martens (Martes martes), brown rats (Rattus norvegicus) and mice, the southern white-breasted hedgehog (Erinaceus concolor), bats and, though declining in numbers, European hares.
