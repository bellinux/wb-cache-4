The vast majority of Jews in Russia and America, as, indeed, all over the world, now appeared to be favourable to Zionism. If <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> declaration favourable to such an ideal, {{we should be able}} to carry on extremely useful propaganda both in Russia and America." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite an Alternative Press {{news report}} shortly after signing with Fueled by Ramen that {{the band was}} recording, they did not start the album until February 2006. Recording took place at Salad Days Studios in Beltsville, Maryland. The group made a brief list of {{producers}} they wished to work with, the first being Matt Squire. One of the band's main reasons for wanting to work with Squire was the label's rapport with him {{as a result of}} the success of Panic! at the Disco's debut, A Fever You Can't Sweat Out (2005). Janick sent Squire a demo of [...] "Teasing to Please (Left Side, Strong Side)." [...] Shaant Hacikyan recalls Squire was [...] "really excited about it. I knew right away that that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> great record together." ...|$|E

They have launched an initiative called, “Project M.O.M.” (Mothers & Others & MyPyramid) to help improve eating habits {{by focusing on the}} nutritional gatekeepers.

This kind of function can be, for example, the effective potential that one electron [...] "feels" [...] inside a periodic crystal. It is useful to make a Fourier series of the potential then when applying Bloch's theorem. First, we may write any arbitrary vector r in the coordinate-system of the lattice: ...|$|E
2500|$|Following Hitler's {{invasion}} of Czechoslovakia and Poland, Lindbergh decried suggestions that the United States should send aid to countries under threat, writing [...] "I {{do not believe}} that repealing the arms embargo would assist democracy in Europe" [...] and [...] "If we repeal the arms embargo with the idea of assisting one of the warring sides to overcome the other, then why mislead ourselves by talk of neutrality?" [...] He equated assistance with war profiteering: [...] "To those who argue that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> profit and build up our own industry by selling munitions abroad, I reply that we in America have not yet reached a point where we wish to capitalize on the destruction and death of war." ...|$|E
2500|$|While in Europe, the Lindberghs came to {{advocate}} isolationist views {{that led to}} their fall from grace {{in the eyes of}} many. In 1938, the U.S. Air Attaché in Berlin invited Charles to inspect the rising power of Nazi Germany's Air Force. Impressed by German technology and their apparent number of aircraft and influenced by the staggering number of deaths from World War I, Charles opposed U.S. entry into the impending European conflict. He suggested any military assistance to Britain might be done for improper financial reasons: [...] "To those who argue that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> profit and build up our own industry by selling munitions abroad, I reply that we in America have not yet reached a point where we wish to capitalize on the destruction and death of war." ...|$|E

If <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>an</b> {{arrangement}} with the captain {{of one of these}} peat boats we might hide a number of men in the hold and cover them with peat. A place might be built large enough, I should think, to hold seventy or eighty men, and yet be room for a quantity of peat to be stowed over them." ...|$|R
2500|$|Side B {{begins with}} one of the band's only {{politically}} based songs, [...] "My Brain Is Hanging Upside Down (Bonzo Goes to Bitburg)" [...] The lyrics comprised Joey, Dee Dee, and Beauviour's feelings while watching US President Ronald Reagan visit military cemetery in Bitburg, West Germany to pay tribute to the victims of Nazism. In an interview with East Coast Rocker, Joey explained: [...] "What Reagan did was fucked up. Everybody told him not to go, all his people told him not to go, and he went anyway. How can you fuckin' forgive the Holocaust? How can you say, 'Oh well, it's OK now?' That's crazy!" [...] Dee Dee also asserted that Johnny had made the band seem right winged. [...] "It was the first time <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> statement to show we weren't prejudiced," [...] he explained. [...] "We'd just had these skinheads at or gigs, punks walking around wearing swastikas." [...] Johnny disliked the song and {{went so far as to}} never play the song live, saying Reagan was his favorite president of his lifetime.|$|E
2500|$|All {{the memos}} from Zionists, non-Zionists, and Curzon were all-in {{by a third}} meeting convened on Wednesday, October 31, 1917. [...] The War Cabinet had dealt an [...] "irreparable blow to Jewish Britons", wrote Montagu. [...] Curzon's memo was mainly {{concerned}} by the non-Jews in Palestine to secure their civil rights. [...] Worldwide there were 12 million Jews, and about 365,000 in Palestine by 1932. [...] Cabinet ministers were worried about Germany playing the Zionist card. [...] If the Germans were in control, it would hasten support for Turkey, and collapse of Kerensky's government. [...] Curzon went on towards an advanced Imperial view: that since most Jews had Zionist views, it was as well to support these majority voices. [...] "If <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> declaration favourable to such an ideal {{we should be able}} to carry on extremely useful propaganda." [...] Weizmann [...] "was absolutely loyal to Great Britain". The Zionists had been approached by the Germans, Weizmann told William Ormsby-Gore. [...] But the British miscalculated the effects of immigration to Palestine, and over-estimated German control over Turkey. [...] The Turks were in no position to prevent movement. [...] Sykes reported the Declaration to Weizmann with elation all round: [...] he repeated [...] "mazel tov" [...] over and over. [...] The Entente had fulfilled its commitment to both Sharif Husein and Chaim Weizmann The Arab Revolt threatened to upset the apple cart. [...] Turkish atrocities never reached Weizmann's ears, at least from the British.|$|E

I wonder whether <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>an</b> expedition to Wharfedale and Bolton Abbey. You would say that the Wharfe was pretty. We'll try and plan it. We should have to sleep out one night; but that would make it all the jollier. There isn't a better inn in England than the Devonshire arms;--and I don't think a pleasanter spot.

Kirk {{used the}} term to describe a possible relationship between miners on a Federation planet and a rock tunneling indigenous species called 'The Horta'. He said, [...] "Seems to me <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>an</b> agreement, reach a modus vivendi. They tunnel, you collect and process, and your processing operation would be a thousand times more profitable." [...] The term Modus Vivendi is in particular referring to the Anglo-French relations in the period {{from the end of}} the Napoleonic Wars until the more substantial Entente Cordiale of 1904.|$|R

30|$|Plexiform schwannoma is an {{infrequent}} {{variant of}} schwannoma characterized grossly and microscopically by multi-nodular growth. Although plexiform schwannoma has such growth patterns, it is a benign tumor {{as well as}} a conventional schwannoma. It rarely infiltrates adjacent organs or arises from the organ itself. In this report, we describe a case in which plexiform schwannoma involved the tracheal wall and left recurrent laryngeal nerve to a great extent. As it was expected to be difficult to achieve complete resection even if the longer tracheal resection were performed, we preserved the trachea and resected as much of the tumor as possible. This report is thought {{to be the first to}} describe plexiform schwannoma infiltrating or growing from the trachea. Although the treatment decisions we made might be controversial, <b>we</b> believed <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>an</b> accurate diagnosis and adequate treatment decision through surgery.|$|R
