25|$|Following {{the devastation}} from the {{phylloxera}} epidemic {{in the late}} 19th century, many vineyards were replanted with high yielding grape varieties such as Cinsaut.

The depressed prices caused by this out-of-balance supply and demand dynamic prompted the South African government to fund the formation of the Koöperatieve Wijnbouwers Vereniging van Zuid-Afrika Bpkt (KWV) in 1918. Initially started as a co-operative, the KWV soon grew in power and prominence, setting policies and prices for the entire South African wine industry. To deal with the wine glut the KWV restricted yields and set minimum prices, encouraging the production of brandy and fortified wines.|$|E

2500|$|Carignan [...] (also {{known as}} Mazuelo, Bovale Grande, Cariñena, Samsó, and Carignane) {{is a red}} Spanish/French wine grape variety that is widely planted {{throughout}} the western Mediterranean and around the globe. [...] Along with Aramon, it was once {{considered one of the}} main grapes responsible for France's <b>wine</b> <b>lake</b> and was a substantial producer in jug wine production in California's Central Valley.|$|E
2500|$|Ampelographers {{believe that}} the grape likely {{originated}} in Cariñena, Aragon and was later transplanted to Sardinia, elsewhere in Italy, France, Algeria, {{and much of the}} New World. The variety was historically a component of Rioja's red wine blend. From Spain, it gained prominence in Algeria and fed that country's export production to France. Upon Algeria's independence in 1962, the French supply of Carignan wine was cut off and growers in Southern France began to plant the vine for their own production. The grape's prominence in France hit a high point in 1988 when it accounted for [...] and was France's most widely planted grape variety. That year, in a drive to increase the overall quality of European wine and to reduce the growing <b>wine</b> <b>lake</b> phenomenon, the European Union started an aggressive vine pull scheme where vineyard owners were offered cash subsidies in exchange for pulling up their vines. Out of all the French wine varieties, Carignan was the most widely affected dropping by 2000 to 95,700 ha (236,000 acres) and being surpassed by Merlot as the most widely planted grape.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1980s, Beaujolais hit {{a peak of}} {{popularity}} in the world's wine market with its Beaujolais nouveau wine. Spurred on by the creative marketing from négociants like Georges Duboeuf, demand outpaced supply for the easy drinking, fruity wines. As more Beaujolais producers tried {{to capitalize on the}} [...] "Nouveau craze", production of regular Beaujolais dropped and an eventual backlash occurred in the late 1990s and early 21st century. By this point, the whole of Beaujolais wine had developed a negative reputation among consumers who associated Gamay based wines with the slightly sweet, simple light bodied wines that characterized Beaujolais Nouveau. Producers were left with a <b>wine</b> <b>lake</b> surplus that French authorities compelled them to reduce through mandatory distillation. In response, there has been renewed emphasis on the production of more complex wines that are aged longer in oak barrels prior to release. Recent years have seen a {{rise in the number of}} terroir driven estate-bottled wines made from single vineyards or in one of the Cru Beaujolais communes, where the name of the commune is allowed to be displayed on the label.|$|E

2500|$|Carignan {{was likely}} {{introduced}} to Sardinia sometime between 1323-1720 when {{the island was}} under the Spanish influence of the Crown of Aragon. Here the grape developed in isolation to form distinct clones under the synonyms Bovale di Spagna and Bovale Grande. At some point the grape reached Algeria where it became a high yielding [...] "workhorse" [...] variety that was widely exported to France to add color and weight to French wine blends. After the phylloxera epidemic devastated French vineyards {{in the mid to}} late 19th century, plantings of Carignan grew in popularity on the French mainland. Plantings increased even more when Algeria gained independence in 1962. The grape's prominence in France hit a high point in 1988 when it accounted for 167,000 hectares (410,000 acres) and was France's most widely planted grape variety. However, as France's <b>wine</b> <b>lake</b> problem became more of a concern, authorities within the French government and European Union started an aggressive vine pull scheme where vineyard owners were offered cash subsidies in exchange for pulling up their vines.|$|E
2500|$|From the 14th–16th century, {{viticulture}} in the Wachau hits {{its peak}} {{along with the}} rest of Lower Austria with plantings an estimated 10 times greater across the land than what exist today. Unfortunately, this period saw the development of a surplus <b>wine</b> <b>lake</b> due, in part, to overproduction and competition from neighboring Germany and Hungary. As prices and influence in the important Vienna market was being affected, Wachau producers banded with neighboring Austrian producers to demand protectionist tariffs and eventually an outright ban on any [...] "foreign" [...] wine being imported into Lower Austria. These measures helped stabilize the Wachau wine industry to some degree until the Napoleonic wars of the early 19th century, followed by the phylloxera epidemic that would reach Austria later that century, would devastate the vineyards of Wachau. Slowly the wine industry would recover and during the 20th century, the Wachau would gain a global reputation for the quality of its dry Riesling and Grüner Veltliner. Then the 1985 diethylene glycol wine scandal, caused by producers outside the Wachau, gained international attention and caused a dramatic drop in sales for Austrian wines across the board.|$|E

40|$|When the CAP was {{established}} back in 1958, {{it was a}} powerful means for the economic or - even more ambitious - for the political integration of the European Community.

In the summer of 19 87, they surpassed quotations on world markets by the factor of two or three in order of magnitude.
