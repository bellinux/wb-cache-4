5|$|During the {{presidency}} of Richard Nixon, a US government investigation was initiated into American involvement in the assassinations. Nixon <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>political</b> foe of Kennedy, having narrowly lost {{to him in the}} 1960 Presidential election. Nixon ordered an investigation under E. Howard Hunt into the murders, convinced Kennedy must have secretly ordered the killings but the inquiry was unable to find any such secret order.|$|E
5|$|Since the 18th century, {{scholars}} have occasionally put forth that Jesus <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>political</b> national messiah, {{but the evidence}} for this portrait is negligible. Likewise, the proposal that Jesus was a Zealot does not fit with the earliest strata of the Synoptic tradition.|$|E

5|$|A {{large part}} of the {{population}} of the Northern states believed that the Davis government was somehow involved in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, and although there was no evidence of their complicity, it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>political</b> reality that had to be dealt with. One result was that the political radicals were able to force the government to prosecute those who had led the war against the Union. Mallory was one of the Confederate leaders who were charged with treason, among other things; on May 20, 1865, while he was still at La Grange, he was roused from his sleep at about midnight and taken into custody. From there he was taken to Fort Lafayette in New York Harbor, where he was confined as a political prisoner.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the force}} was {{commanded}} by its commissioner, {{there was also}} an influential senior post of comptroller, created in 1880 in response to Macleod's financial mismanagement of the force. For most of the force's history the role was occupied by Frederick White, until replaced by A. A. Mclean in 1913. The comptroller was responsible for keeping account of expenditure, auditing and managing procurement, and effectively removed most of the non-operational functions from the commissioner's responsibility. White <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>political</b> client of Prime Minister John Macdonald, who took a close interest in the management of the force, and the post became critical for garnering support from Ottawa for investment in the police.|$|E
5|$|Around 1849 Wilkes went to California, {{either with}} or {{shortly after his}} friend David Colbreth Broderick. Wilkes <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>political</b> advisor of Broderick's, but they quarreled over water issues in 1853 and Wilkes left California. Wilkes then {{traveled}} to Europe, turning the experience into another book, this one entitled Europe in a Hurry. Returning to California after Europe, he reunited with Broderick in late 1853 but another quarrel in 1854 over Wilkes' appointment to a judicial post led to Wilkes' leaving California permanently. The two men reconciled in 1859 during a visit by Broderick to New York shortly before Broderick's death. Wilkes was the recipient of Broderick's estate, and Wilkes wrote a long eulogy to his friend {{that appeared in the}} Spirit in October 1859.|$|E

5|$|As Ziva and Tony {{drive home}} from the airport, she divulges the reason for her resentment of the new director: Orli Elbaz {{was the reason for}} her parents' divorce. She {{discloses}} that she had always believed that it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>political</b> strategy on Elbaz's part in attempt to advance her rank in Mossad, though she now thinks that it is possible that Elbaz had loved Eli. When she adds that she believes that she would be a different person were it not for Elbaz, Tony expresses thankfulness that things occurred the way they did.|$|E
5|$|As {{his second}} {{administration}} began, disaster hit the nation when the Panic of 1893 produced a severe national depression, which Cleveland {{was unable to}} reverse. It ruined his Democratic Party, opening {{the way for a}} Republican landslide in 1894 and for the agrarian and silverite seizure of the Democratic Party in 1896. The result <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>political</b> realignment that ended the Third Party System and launched the Fourth Party System and the Progressive Era.|$|E
5|$|During the {{communist}} era, {{the legacy of}} Kafka's work for Eastern bloc socialism was hotly debated. Opinions ranged from {{the notion that he}} satirised the bureaucratic bungling of a crumbling Austria-Hungarian Empire, to the belief that he embodied the rise of socialism. A further key point was Marx's theory of alienation. While the orthodox position was that Kafka's depictions of alienation were no longer relevant for a society that had supposedly eliminated alienation, a 1963 conference held in Liblice, Czechoslovakia, on the eightieth anniversary of his birth, reassessed the importance of Kafka's portrayal of bureaucracy. Whether or not Kafka <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>political</b> writer is still an issue of debate.|$|E

5|$|Freedom fries <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>political</b> {{euphemism}} for French fries in the United States. The term came to prominence in 2003 when the then Republican Chairman of the Committee on House Administration, Bob Ney, renamed the menu item in three Congressional cafeterias {{in response to}} France's opposition to the proposed invasion of Iraq. Although originally supported with several restaurants changing their menus as well, the term fell out of use due to declining support for the Iraq War. Following Ney's resignation as Chairman in 2006, it was quietly reverted.|$|E
5|$|In 1970, the {{proposed}} visit of a South African team to England was subject of widespread public opposition. The MCC {{was no longer}} solely responsible for any decisions, being {{only a part of}} the Cricket Council, but Allen pressed the government to intervene and decide whether the tour should go ahead. He believed it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>political</b> matter outside the scope of cricket authorities; the government eventually became involved and the tour was cancelled.|$|E
5|$|In 1993 Christensen was arrested, tried, {{and sentenced}} to five years, four months {{imprisonment}} for trafficking marijuana and heroin. She claimed {{that she had been}} driving a car from Texas to Florida as a favor to friends, and had no knowledge that she was being used as a drug mule by them. Many Odinists and Asastruer decried the sentence, and claimed that it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>political</b> frame-up; Murray established a Free Else Christensen Committee and with Stephen McNallen created a defense fund to aid her. Christensen herself did not endorse the claim that the charges were politically motivated, instead blaming her own naivete at being exploited by drug dealers. Before being imprisoned she gave the Odinist Fellowship's membership list to McNallen for the use of his own Heathen organisation, the Asatru Folk Assembly.|$|E

5|$|Le souper de Beaucaire <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>political</b> {{pamphlet}} {{written by}} Napoleon Bonaparte in 1793. With the French Revolution into its fourth year, civil war had spread across France between various rival political factions. Napoleon {{was involved in}} military action, on the government's side, against some rebellious cities of southern France. It was during these events, in 1793, that he spoke with four merchants from the Midi and heard their views. As a loyal soldier of the Republic he responded in turn, set on dispelling the fears of the merchants and discouraging their beliefs. He later wrote about his conversation {{in the form of}} a pamphlet, calling for an end to the civil war.|$|E
5|$|Pierce {{had wanted}} to {{organize}} the Nebraska Territory without explicitly addressing the matter of slavery, but Douglas could not get enough southern support to accomplish this. Pierce was skeptical of the bill, knowing it would result in bitter opposition from the North. Douglas and Davis convinced him to support the bill regardless. It was tenaciously opposed by northerners such as Ohio Senator Salmon P. Chase and Massachusetts' Charles Sumner, who rallied public sentiment in the North against the bill. Northerners had been suspicious of the Gadsden Purchase, moves towards Cuba annexation, {{and the influence of}} slaveholding Cabinet members such as Davis, and saw the Nebraska bill as part of a pattern of southern aggression. The result <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>political</b> firestorm that did great damage to Pierce's presidency.|$|E
5|$|Possibly as {{a result}} of Eystein's activities, King David granted half of Caithness to Harald's cousin, Erlend Haraldsson. The result, as recounted in the Orkneyinga Saga, <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>political</b> {{struggle}} which ended with Erlend's murder in 1154. Rognvald too was killed, in 1158. Svein Asleifsson was again heavily involved in this dynastic conflict. In 1153 King David died, to be succeeded by his young grandson, Malcolm IV. King Eystein too died in a war with his brothers Ingi and Sigurd which left Ingi the sole surviving son of Harald Gilli. As a result, by 1158 Harald Maddadsson was undisputed Earl of Orkney, with neither the King of Scots nor the King of Norway in any position to contest his power.|$|E

5|$|The Brown Dog affair <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>political</b> {{controversy}} about vivisection that raged in England from 1903 until 1910. It involved the infiltration by Swedish feminists of University of London medical lectures, pitched battles between medical {{students and the}} police, police protection for the statue of a dog, a libel trial at the Royal Courts of Justice, {{and the establishment of}} a Royal Commission to investigate the use of animals in experiments. The affair became a cause célèbre that divided the country.|$|E
5|$|The Grand Duchy of Lithuania {{to which}} Jogaila succeeded as Grand Duke in 1377 <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>political</b> entity {{composed}} of two leading, but very different nationalities and two political systems: ethnic Lithuania in the north-west and the vast Ruthenian territories of former Kievan Rus', comprising the lands of modern Ukraine, Belarus, and parts of western Russia. At first, Jogaila—like his father—based his rule in the southern and eastern territories of Lithuania, while his uncle, Kęstutis, the Duke of Trakai, continued to rule the north-western region. Jogaila's succession, however, soon placed this system of dual rule under strain.|$|E
5|$|The Sex Party <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>political</b> party {{based in}} British Columbia, Canada. The party {{was guided by}} the {{philosophy}} of the sex-positive movement. Among other points, the party advocated for reform of sex education in schools so that sexual issues are taught more gradually over time and included a more comprehensive coverage of them. They advocated for the repeal of laws that promote antisexualism, such as prostitution laws and censorship. They also supported making Valentine's Day a statutory holiday and renaming Victoria Day to Eros Day.|$|E
