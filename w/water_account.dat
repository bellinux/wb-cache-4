Throughout this period, the Minerals Council of Australia’s <b>Water</b> <b>Accounting</b> Framework has developed concurrently with the Australian standards and the standards have informed elements of the framework. However, the framework is not identical to the standard as the objectives between the two are different. The objective of the <b>Water</b> <b>Accounting</b> Framework is to create consistency in water reporting of the minerals industry and to assist companies reporting to corporate sustainability initiatives. The objective of AWAS 1 is to provide information to water management bodies to facilitate decisions about the allocation of water resources. Companies are to report on an annual basis, not only physical flows of water but contractual requirements to supply and obtain water, regardless of whether the transaction has been fulfilled in the reporting period. In contrast, the <b>Water</b> <b>Accounting</b> Framework only reports on flows that have physically happened.

Efficient and effective water management is an important element in alleviating water crises caused by misuse of water resources. Design/methodology/approach – The theoretical framework adopted in this paper is Accountability. This concept is explored in depth across three main ideas: clarity of relationship, transparency and power. A mixed method approach was utilised in which a questionnaire was administered to users with water-related interests in five different water-related seminars.

40|$|Abstract: A {{precursor}} to effective water management is {{the availability of}} useful information. <b>Water</b> <b>accounts</b> are being developed to meet these needs. However, there are considerable problems in quantifying all of the reported elements. Even where direct measurements are available, they are often prone to measurement uncertainties. The volumes of other elements are difficult to measure and often can only be quantified based {{on a series of}} assumptions. The presence of uncertainties in <b>water</b> <b>accounts</b> poses two problems. Firstly, the decisions made based on information presented in the accounts may change if the associated uncertainties were disclosed to those making decisions. Secondly, due to the uncertainties associated with each element, the accounts rarely balance. There has been surprisingly little research into understanding and reducing the uncertainty in <b>water</b> <b>accounts,</b> and at present, it is not systematically captured and reported in accounts. This paper addresses the uncertainties associated with <b>water</b> <b>accounts</b> by: • identifying and quantifying the major sources of uncertainty associated with each element in the water accounts; and, • presenting a method to constrain the uncertainty associated with each component of the <b>water</b> <b>accounts</b> by only including those values that can create a balanced set of accounts...|$|R

What is in the National <b>Water</b> <b>Account?</b> The National <b>Water</b> <b>Account</b> is Australia’s most comprehensive water information report. It provides information on nine significant water use regions across Australia. It discloses information about water stores and flows, water rights and water use. The National <b>Water</b> <b>Account</b> reports on the volumes of water traded, extracted and managed for economic, social, cultural and environmental purposes. Why are we doing it? Through the Water Act 2007, the Bureau has statutory responsibility for compiling and delivering comprehensive water information across Australia. Water information is a critical underpinning of the water reform process both {{on which to base}} decisions and against which to measure progress.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the collaborative processes {{used by the}} CALFED Operations Group (Ops Group) and the outcomes achieved by these processes. The CALFED Bay Delta Program is a complex partnership of over 20 {{state and federal agencies}} that seeks to balance competing needs and interests in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. The Ops Group coordinates the operations of the two large water export projects in the south Delta -— the Central Valley Project (CVP) and State Water Project (SWP) -— with environmental and water quality regulations. Participants in the Ops Group were brought together by a conflict between environmental protection and water supply reliability. Fish populations were declining, while actions taken under the Endangered Species Act threatened the stability of the water supply. Through collaboration, dialogue, and detailed modeling of the system, the Operations Group was able to overcome decades of mistrust, legal barriers, financial risks, and scientific uncertainty to develop new tools for managing the complex Delta water system. The Ops Group moved from a system of isolated bureaucratic decision making and prescriptive standards for protecting endangered fish in the Delta to a system based on cooperative real-time management, where minor modifications to the CVP and SWP were made on a daily basis based on real-time monitoring data. The program {{at the center of this}} breakthrough was the Environmental <b>Water</b> <b>Account.</b> The Environmental <b>Water</b> <b>Account</b> is a program that was designed to let the Operations Group maintain reliability in the SWP and CVP water supply while reducing the amount of water pumped out of the Delta when the pumps pose a danger to fish.

However, this paper describes several notable achievements that Ops Group members would not have been able to accomplish without collaboration.

The social capital and new institutional structures built by these processes have enabled the Ops Group to creatively deal with challenges that would have previously resulted in an impasse...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: <b>Water</b> {{resources}} <b>accounting</b> {{was defined}} by the <b>Water</b> <b>Accounting</b> Development Committee (2007) as “the application of a consistent and structured approach to identifying, measuring, recording and reporting information about water. ” Discussion of the desired outcomes of <b>water</b> <b>accounting</b> {{makes it clear that}} there is focus on water extraction and consumptive use for domestic, economic or public benefits. This aspect of <b>water</b> resources <b>accounting</b> is described here as <b>water</b> use <b>accounting.</b> <b>Water</b> use is not always assessed efficiently or accurately by holistic consideration of the entire water balance. For example, urban water systems may represent a relatively small component of a regional water balance, but an intensively and accurately metered one. In such cases, <b>water</b> use <b>accounting</b> may be a well posed problem that only requires appropriate aggregation and reporting of metering data. In rural systems, extractions of groundwater and river water and the water use associated with runoff intercepting activities are often only partially metered or not metered at all. However, they are often within the uncertainty ranges of common hydrological water balance measurements and models, and therefore cannot always be inferred from those. There is a need for purpose-designed water use metering and estimation strategies that address statistical issues such as sampling design and uncertainty estimation. In this paper, we discuss the statistical challenges associated with the <b>water</b> use <b>accounting</b> and assessment...|$|R
