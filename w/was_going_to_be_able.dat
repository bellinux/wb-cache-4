Among his fifty-four classmates were John Williams Walker, James Iradell, John James Marshall, and Patrick Noble. Blackford became fluent in Greek and Latin and excelled in history. He also spent a considerable amount of time reading legal books on English common law. After college he studied law for a year in the office of Revolutionary War hero Colonel George MacDonald before moving on in 1810 to complete his legal studies in the office of New Jersey Supreme Court Justice Gabriel Ford in Morristown. He was admitted to the bar in New Jersey that same year.

2500|$|Casting {{the role}} of the [...] "Coach" [...] {{character}} took longer. Meriwether originally envisioned Coach as [...] "a fat Jewish guy, like a manchild" [...] and later as [...] "this dumb jock [...] crazy rage problems". David Neher (who would play Schmidt's so-called [...] "fremesis," [...] Benjamin, in two episodes) was among the 400 actors auditioning for Coach before the producers settled on Damon Wayans Jr. Wayans was expecting his show, the ABC sitcom Happy Endings, to be canceled. When that show was renewed for a second season, Wayans' spot was replaced with Lamorne Morris, who had also read for Coach but had been unavailable for filming the pilot. Meriwether estimated that about 80 percent of the pilot would have needed to be re-shot in order to remove Wayans from the episode, since he was in one of the leading roles of the show. As the producers also liked reflecting the frequent apartment changes in young people's lives, Meriwether, 20th Century Fox and the studio decided to keep the characters and the plot of the pilot episode as they were. Morris joined the show in the second episode of the series when the producers had already broken seven episodes without knowing what the actor <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to do. Wayans returned to New Girl in season 3 for a season-long arc after Happy Endings had been cancelled, and was officially added as a regular for season 4.|$|E
