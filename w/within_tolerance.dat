30|$|The main {{disadvantage}} of arithmetic tolerancing or worst-case tolerancing {{is that it}} does not follow any trend or pattern <b>within</b> the <b>tolerance</b> zone and part dimensions resulting from the machining process can possess any value <b>within</b> the <b>tolerance</b> zone. This results in checking up of each individual dimension for its correctness <b>within</b> the <b>tolerance</b> zone, which is impractical in mass production. The statistical tolerance overcomes this drawback of arithmetic tolerance and facilitates the machining to yield dimensions according to a normal distribution. Also statistical tolerancing allows some cancellation of variation from normal distribution. Hence, this paper in essence reflects the theme of statistical tolerancing.|$|R
50|$|Interchangeability {{relies on}} parts' {{dimensions}} falling within the tolerance range.

50|$|A go/no-go gauge is an {{integral}} part of the quality process that is used in the manufacturing industry to ensure interchangeability of parts between processes or even between different manufacturers.
