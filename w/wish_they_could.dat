500|$|According to Lopez, {{the song}} is about missing someone terribly; [...] "someone who is missing someone so much and has done {{something}} so wrong to the person that they know they can't fix it. So they just hate themselves right in that moment, they can't stand , they regret everything that they did and they <b>wish</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> change things." [...] James Reed of The Boston Globe noted the chorus of [...] "Me Haces Falta" [...] to be self-loathing, with the lines: [...] "Tú me haces falta/Sí, me arrepiento/Me odio/Estoy desesperada" [...] (English: [...] "I miss you/Yes, I repent/I hate myself/I'm desperate"). Chris Willman of Entertainment Weekly praised the song's lyrics, but dismissed the song's production, stating {{that it does not}} live up the song's [...] "florid, romance-novel lyrics".|$|E

In February 2005, they toured the United Kingdom – playing London, Manchester, Milton Keynes, Chester, and Liverpool – and then followed it by playing some gigs in the Netherlands {{to coincide with}} the release of the Dutch translation of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince which took place in November 2005. In the Netherlands, they played one of their earliest songs [...] "Platform Nine and 3/4" [...] in Dutch. In late 2005, Harry and the Potters enjoyed more tongue-in-cheek critical success from respectable quarters. The web based music ’zine Pitchfork Media even hailed Harry and the Potters as having one of the best five live shows in 2005, quipping that [...] "The Decemberists <b>wish</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> lit-rock like this." [...] In the fall of 2005, Joe entered Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts. While Harry and the Potters play infrequently at rock clubs and other venues—a Yule Ball at the Middle East Downstairs in Cambridge, MA in December 2005 attracted an audience of 600 with 200 turned away at the door ...|$|E

60|$|Finally Jake fell asleep, and so loud was his snoring that {{it seemed}} as if he must be heard from the street, {{therefore}} the boys pinched him when there was too great a volume of sound, {{and at the same time}} <b>wished</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> enjoy the same happy unconsciousness of the situation.|$|R

60|$|It {{made him}} bitter and despairing {{to think that}} women should be helpless--that they should need some man to protect them against some other man.

60|$|The reader has doubtless {{inferred}} {{the fact}} that my visits among the wounded and sick have been as an independent missionary, in my own style, and not as an agent of any commission.
