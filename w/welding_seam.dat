40|$|Longitudinal <b>weld</b> <b>seams</b> are an {{intrinsic}} feature in hollow extrusions produced with porthole dies. The formation of longitudinal <b>weld</b> <b>seams</b> {{is a solid}} bonding process, controlled by the local conditions in the extrusion die. Being the weakest areas within the extrusion cross section, it is desirable to achieve adequate properties of these <b>weld</b> <b>seams.</b> In our research, {{the concept of a}} <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> integrity indicator as a means of quantifying bonding efficiency is introduced. The value of this indicator depends on a number of factors: the material flow within the die weld chambers, an adequate pressure level acting on the weld planes and finally the evolution of the metal microstructure. Optimisation of the welding conditions leads to a higher value of the <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> integrity indicator and thus to improved <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> properties. The objective of the research presented in this paper is to assess the feasibility of this concept. In lab-scale experiments, AA 6060 and AA 6082 aluminium alloy billets were formed into strips by means of the direct hot extrusion process. By utilising porthole dies a central longitudinal <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> is formed. The effect of different geometries of the weld chamber and the processing conditions {{on the quality of the}} <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> are investigated. Characterisation of these <b>weld</b> <b>seams</b> through mechanical testing, focusing on the ability of the <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> area to accommodate plastic deformation following the onset of plastic instability, and microstructural analysis provides insight into bonding performance. The outcome of this characterisation provides a basis for an estimation of the <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> indicator. Through computer modelling, the particular process conditions related to <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> formation are calculated and correlated with the experimental results. The experimental results clearly demonstrate that <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> formation is controlled by a combination of factors as described above. Inadequate fulfilment of these conditions, verified by the FEsimulations, is the cause of inferior <b>weld</b> <b>seams,</b> associated with low values of the <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> integrity indicator. Through further elaboration of the concepts presented in this work, the <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> integrity indicator is to be developed, with the future aim of predicting the <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> performance through finite element simulations. © (2010) Trans Tech Publications...|$|R
40|$|Human and Systems EngineeringLaser welding is an {{emerging}} joining technique for automotive industry. Due {{to the complex}} process, the control of laser welding quality problem such as spatter, porosity, and undercut is not easy. Traditional mechanical testing of weld is time consuming, costly, and inefficient for on-line monitoring of laser welding quality. In this regards, this thesis aims to estimate the laser welding quality in a non-destructive way by using the geometry of top <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> of weldment. The most challenging task which is covered in this thesis is the estimation of the tensile shear strength in a non-destructive way. Experimental analysis reveals {{that the existence of}} two types of correlation in the variation of <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> and tensile shear strength in the laser welding of galvanized steel: (1) positive correlation exists between the log-transformed average width of the top <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> and maximum tensile shear strength, and (2) negative correlation exists between the variation of the width of top <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> and maximum tensile shear strength. These correlations exist only when top <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> having non uniform <b>seam</b> boundary. However, <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> having uniform seam boundary do not have sufficient evidence of the correlation between the variation of <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> and tensile shear strength.

50|$|Resistance {{seam welding}} {{is a process}} that {{produces}} a weld at the faying surfaces of two similar metals. The seam may be a butt joint or an overlap joint and is usually an automated process. It differs from butt welding in that butt welding typically welds the entire joint at once and seam welding forms the weld progressively, starting at one end. Like spot <b>welding,</b> <b>seam</b> welding relies on two electrodes, usually made from copper, to apply pressure and current. The electrodes are often disc shaped and rotate as the material passes between them. This allows the electrodes to stay in constant contact with the material to make long continuous welds. The electrodes may also move or assist the movement of the material. A transformer supplies energy to the weld joint in the form of low voltage, high current AC power. The joint of the work piece has high electrical resistance relative {{to the rest of the}} circuit and is heated to its melting point by the current. The semi-molten surfaces are pressed together by the welding pressure that creates a fusion bond, resulting in a uniformly welded structure. Most seam welders use water cooling through the electrode, transformer and controller assemblies due to the heat generated.|$|E
40|$|Longitudinal <b>weld</b> <b>seams</b> are an {{intrinsic}} feature in hollow extrusions produced with porthole dies. As these joins occur {{along the entire}} extruded length, it is desirable that these <b>weld</b> <b>seams</b> have a minimal impact on the structural integrity of the extrudate. In particular, defects associated with <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> formation should be avoided. In this research, the occurrence of defects related to material flow inside the extrusion tooling is studied. In lab-scale experiments, EN AW- 6060 and EN AW- 6082 aluminium alloy billets are formed into strips {{by means of the}} direct hot extrusion process.

Many studies have been conducted to search the optimal welding condition experimentally that ensure the joining quality of laser welding that relies both on welding system configuration and welding parameter specification. Both non-destructive and destructive techniques, for example, ultrasonic inspection and tensile test are widely used in practice for estimating the joining quality. Non-destructive techniques are attractive as a rapid quality testing method despite relatively low accuracy. In this paper, we examine the relationship between the variation of <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> and tensile shear strength in the laser welding of galvanized steel in a lap joint configuration in order to investigate the potential of the variation of <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> as a joining quality estimator. From the experimental analysis, we identify a trend in between maximum tensile shear strength and the variation of <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> that clearly supports the fact that laser welded parts having larger variation in the <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> usually have lower tensile strength. The discovered relationship leads us to conclude that the variation of <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> can be used as an indirect non-destructive testing method for estimating the tensile strength of the welded parts. close...|$|R
