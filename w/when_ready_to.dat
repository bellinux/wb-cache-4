5|$|<b>When</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> emerge, several {{different}} strategies are used. In some species, {{the transformation of}} the nymph occurs underwater and the subimago swims to the surface and launches itself into the air. In other species, the nymph rises to the surface, bursts out of its skin, remains quiescent {{for a minute or two}} resting on the exuviae (cast skin) and then flies upwards, and in some, the nymph climbs out of the water before transforming.|$|E
5|$|Flies have {{a mobile}} head, {{with a pair}} of large {{compound}} eyes, and mouthparts designed for piercing and sucking (mosquitoes, black flies and robber flies), or for lapping and sucking in the other groups. Their wing arrangement gives them great maneuverability in flight, and claws and pads on their feet enable them to cling to smooth surfaces. Flies undergo complete metamorphosis; the eggs are laid on the larval food-source and the larvae, which lack true limbs, develop in a protected environment, often inside their source of their food. The pupa is a tough capsule from which the adult emerges <b>when</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> do so; flies mostly have short lives as adults.|$|E
5|$|The {{courtship}} {{display is}} poorly recorded. Ornithologist J. Denis Summers-Smith observed a display {{in which the}} male hopped beside the female in a tree, drooping its wings and ruffling the chestnut-coloured feathers on its back. Groups {{of two or more}} males have been observed chasing a female. In the house sparrow a similar display exists, in which a female who is not ready to copulate is chased by her mate, who is joined by other males. It is not known if the display in the Cape sparrow has a similar significance. <b>When</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> mate, the female crouches in solicitation and is mounted by the male. Instances of hybridisation with the house sparrow, the southern grey-headed sparrow, and captives or escapees of the Sudan golden sparrow have been reported.|$|E

5|$|The larvae are {{generally}} whitish grubs, roughly oval and bluntly-pointed at both ends. They have fifteen segments and spiracles in each segment for breathing. They have no legs but {{are able to}} move {{within the confines of}} the cell, helped by tubercles on their sides. They have short horns on the head, jaws for chewing their food and an appendage on either side of the mouth tipped with a bristle. There is a gland under the mouth that secretes a viscous liquid which solidifies into the silk they use to produce their cocoons. The pupa can be seen through the semi-transparent cocoon and over the course of a few days, the insect undergoes metamorphosis into the form of the adult bee. <b>When</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> emerge, it splits its skin dorsally and climbs out of the exuviae as a winged adult and breaks out of the cell.|$|E

25|$|Entering {{the port}} of Monterey, her captain was {{supplied}} with wood and water. <b>When</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> sail he asked permission of Governor Borica to land eleven English sailors who had secretly boarded his vessel at Botany Bay, Australia. The Governor refused his consent. It {{was a violation of}} Spanish law to land any foreigners. The shrewd Yankee captain, however, that night forced the sailors at the point of a pistol to go ashore. He then speedily put to sea. Borica was very angry. Making the best of the situation, however, he put the men to work as carpenters and blacksmiths.|$|E
25|$|A suppressible {{revolver}} design {{does exist}} in the Nagant M1895, a Belgian designed revolver used by Imperial Russia and later the Soviet Union from 1895 through World War II. This revolver uses a unique cartridge whose case extends beyond {{the tip of the}} bullet, and a cylinder that moves forward to place the end of the cartridge inside the barrel <b>when</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> fire. This bridges the gap between the cylinder and the barrel, and expands to seal the gap when fired. While the tiny gap between cylinder and barrel on most revolvers is insignificant to the internal ballistics, the seal is especially effective when used with a suppressor, and a number of suppressed Nagant revolvers have been used since its invention.|$|E
25|$|Adults {{are large}} flies, and unusual amongst brachyceran flies {{because they have}} a dense {{covering}} of fine setae (like hairs) and colored patterns that make them appear like bumble-bees (Hymenoptera). All species of the Oestridae are so highly adapted to the myiasis type of parasitism that the adults do not feed and have only residual mouthparts (see photograph of Hypoderma iparece). All these flies have an obligate myiasis life-cycle, with a complete metamorphosis. The females lay eggs with high selectivity on their special hosts and at specific sites there. For example, eggs laid on the legs of horses in the case of species of Gasterophilus. The horse licks at the irritated skin and the larvae transfer to the mouth of horse. The larvae penetrate tissues in the oral cavity, feed parasitically whilst migrating through tissue of the esophagus to finally reach the stomach. The final larval stage is completed with the larvae attached to the mucosa of the horse's stomach. <b>When</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> pupate the larvae detach and are voided in the horse's feces. Another example is Dermatobia hominis, torsalo-fly, which is an important parasite of cattle, and sometimes humans, in tropical regions of South America. The larvae cause a localized, furuncular (= like a boil) myiasis in the skin of their hosts. The larvae infest these sites when transported there accidentally by blood feeding mosquitoes; the adult female Dermatobia flies lay their eggs on the legs of mosquitoes, a dispersal mechanism called phoresy.|$|E

500|$|Immature mayflies are aquatic and are {{referred}} to as nymphs or naiads. In contrast to their short lives as adults, they may live for several years in the water. They have an elongated, cylindrical or somewhat flattened body that passes through a number of instars (stages), molting and increasing in size each time. <b>When</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> emerge from the water, nymphs vary in length, depending on species, from [...] The head has a tough outer covering of sclerotin, often with various hard ridges and projections; it points either forwards or downwards, with the mouth at the front. There are two large compound eyes, three ocelli (simple eyes) and a pair of antennae of variable lengths, set between or in front of the eyes. The mouthparts are designed for chewing and consist of a flap-like labrum, a pair of strong mandibles, a pair of maxillae, a membranous hypopharynx and a labium.|$|E
