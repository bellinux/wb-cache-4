Half of the planted area was irrigated using furrow flood irrigation and half was irrigated using a low-pressure overhead linear sprinkler system. Ground water was sampled {{during the growing season}} under both irrigation systems and analyzed for nitrate-N concentration. Nitrate-N concentration of irrigation water and run-off water was also measured. The type of irrigation did not affect stand, sucrose concentration, or root yield. Sodium (Na), potassium (K) and amino-N concentrations were significantly greater under <b>sprinkler</b> <b>irrigation</b> than under flood irrigation. Because of higher impurities, sugarbeet produced under <b>sprinkler</b> <b>irrigation</b> had greater sucrose loss to molasses (SLM) and lower extraction than sugarbeet produced under flood irrigation.

The reason for the higher rate of evaporation during irrigation was identified as the evaporation of intercepted water on the canopy, which varied with crop canopy development, and possibly some droplet evaporation during flight.

Many producers using furrow surface irrigation are faced with a decision on whether they should convert to a higher efficiency center pivot <b>sprinkler</b> <b>irrigation</b> system. An irrigation scheduling model using 27 years of climatic data for western Kansas was combined with a corn yield production function and economic model to simulate crop yields and economics under four combinations of irrigation system and application efficiency for six different irrigation capacities. Center pivot <b>sprinkler</b> <b>irrigation</b> systems were found to give higher corn yields and greater profitability than furrow surface irrigation, particularly when system flow rates were less than 40 L/s. <b>Sprinkler</b> <b>irrigation</b> systems with application efficiencies of 100, 95, and 85 % and a furrow surface irrigation system with 70 % application efficiency produced simulated crop yields of 12. 3, 12. 2, 12. 1, and 11. 3 Mg/ha, respectively, when irrigation capacity was 6. 35 mm/day. Reducing the irrigation capacity to 2. 54 mm/day reduced yields to 9. 4, 9. 2, 8. 9, and 8. 3 Mg/ha for the respective irrigation systems.

Soil particles, fertilizers and pesticides can become part of runoff waters and can be moved from their target locations, causing degradation of surface water quality. Other potential problems associated with runoff include a lack of soil moisture in localized areas of the field, crop nutrient deficiencies, washed-out seeds or plants, and increased irrigation water pumping costs...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY The {{participatory}} irrigation projects cover {{about 40}} % (572, 000 ha) {{and the private}} projects 60 % (858, 000 ha) of irrigated land. The transportation {{of water in the}} case of public networks is done by surface <b>irrigation</b> (36 %), <b>sprinkler</b> <b>irrigation</b> (52 %) and drip irrigation (10 %). In private networks the water is applied by surface <b>irrigation,</b> <b>sprinkler</b> <b>irrigation</b> and drip irrigation at rates of 7 %, 49 % and 44 % respectively.

Based on probability maps and using the probability threshold, which is assumed to be equal to the marginal probability of each parameter, groundwater quality is classified as suitable and unsuitable for <b>sprinkler</b> <b>irrigation</b> purposes (Fig.  4). According to the maps generated (Fig.  4), the unsuitable groundwater for irrigation in terms of high amounts of Cl−, Na+, SAR and EC are located in southern parts of the study area. These areas are supposed to be inappropriate for the implementation of <b>sprinkler</b> <b>irrigation.</b> However, the suitability of irrigation water regarding salinity management should be assessed considering salt tolerance of the cultivated crops and soil characteristics. This means in areas with slightly high levels of salinity and sodium, groundwater can still be used for irrigating certain crops e.g. barley, sugar beet and wheat because different crops have different tolerance levels of salinity/sodium hazard (Bauder 2007). Also to reduce leaf burn under <b>sprinkler</b> <b>irrigation</b> from both sodium and chloride, irrigation on cool, cloudy days or overnight would be beneficial. Moreover to avoid direct contact of saline water with leaf surfaces in <b>sprinkler</b> <b>irrigation,</b> drop nozzles and drag hoses are recommended (Bauder 2007).|$|R
