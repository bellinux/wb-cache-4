The decision {{was based on the}} large existing stocks of smoothbore muskets in U.S. arsenals, which he argued could be re-rifled {{in the same manner as}} the Parrott guns (an assertion which proved incorrect). He also adamantly opposed the introduction of breech-loading repeating rifles, on the basis that they would encourage poor fire discipline and <b>waste</b> <b>ammunition.</b>|$|E
25|$|Spain's Admiral Mendez Núñez {{sent two}} of his most {{powerful}} ships (frigates Villa de Madrid and Reina Blanca) south to destroy the combined Chilean-Peruvian fleet. The allied squadron had been placed {{under the command of}} Peruvian Captain Manuel Villar and had taken refuge at Abtao, a well-protected inlet near the gulf of Chiloé in southern Chile. The Spanish squadron appeared at the entrance of the inlet on February 7, 1866, but the Spanish did not enter as {{they did not want to}} risk their ironclads running aground in the shallows. A cannonade lasting several hours was exchanged with little effect. In spite of being at anchor, without steam, and with some ships with their engines undergoing overhaul, the Allies mounted an energetic fight. The Covadonga, under the command of Lieutenant Manuel Thomson, managed to fire over an island and scored several hits on the frigate Blanca. The battle ended indecisively without further developments. Reluctant to enter shallow waters and realizing that a long range gun duel served no purpose but to <b>waste</b> <b>ammunition,</b> the Spanish commanders withdrew.|$|E
2500|$|At {{this time}} however, many {{officers}} were distrustful of breech-loading weapons {{on the grounds}} that they would encourage men to <b>waste</b> <b>ammunition.</b> In addition, the Sharps Rifle was expensive to manufacture (three times the cost of a muzzle-loading Springfield rifle) and so only 11,000 of the Model 1859s were produced. Most were unissued or given to sharpshooters, but the 13th Pennsylvania Reserves (which still carried the old-fashioned designation of a [...] "rifle regiment") carried them until being mustered out in 1864.|$|E

2500|$|The M1 and M2 Carbines {{continued}} in service during the Korean War. A postwar U.S. Army evaluation reported that [...] "here are practically no data bearing on {{the accuracy of the}} carbine at ranges in excess of 50 yards. The record contains a few examples of carbine-aimed fire felling an enemy soldier at this distance or perhaps a little more. But they are so few in number that no general conclusion can be drawn from them. Where carbine fire had proved killing effect, approximately 95 percent of the time the target was dropped at less than 50 yards." [...] The evaluation also reported that [...] "ommanders noted that it took two to three engagements at least to settle their men to the automatic feature of the carbine so that they would not greatly <b>waste</b> <b>ammunition</b> under the first impulse of engagement. By experience, they would come to handle it semiautomatically, but it took prolonged battle hardening to bring about this adjustment in the human equation." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{investment}} {{of the fort}} was not yet complete, but that was accomplished on March 29, when a company from Parke's brigade crossed the sound and landed unopposed on Bogue Banks. The Confederate infantry that would have defended against the landing, the 26th North Carolina, had {{been included in the}} retreat following the Battle of New Bern. Federal siege artillery followed, and Parke set up four batteries that would bear on the fort: four 8-inch (20.3cm) mortars at a range of 1200 yards (1100 meters); four 10-inch (25.4cm) mortars at a range of 1600 yards (1460 meters); three 30-pounder (13.6kg) rifled Parrotts at a range of 1300 yards (1190 meters); and a 12-pounder (5.4kg) boat howitzer at a range of 1200 yards (1100 meters). The batteries were moved up at night and remained hidden behind sand dunes until they were ready to open fire. The defenders were aware of these activities, but could not <b>waste</b> <b>ammunition</b> by firing at unseen targets. Patrols sent out from the fort to harass the Union soldiers were driven back, usually without loss. On April 17, General Burnside could state in his report to the War Department, [...] "I hope to reduce the fort within ten days." [...] His prediction proved to be remarkably accurate.|$|E
2500|$|During December 1915 and January 1916 Lord Clive was {{stationed}} in the Thames Estuary to shoot down approaching German Zeppelins with shrapnel shells fired by her main guns, but she was denied a chance to <b>waste</b> <b>ammunition</b> when the Zeppelins never came within range. She bombarded German batteries at Westende on 26 January using the newly developed air-spotting techniques, but she only fired about eleven rounds during the half-hour bombardment. This was the last bombardment {{for the next seven}} months as the monitors were used to support British light forces, minefields and net defenses in the Channel. Lord Clive was refitted during this period with a pair of six-inch guns to enhance her armament against German ships. This came in handy on 8 June when she, along with other monitors and destroyers, rebuffed an attempt by a dozen German ships to clear the nets and sweep the minefields. Lord Clive participated in a deception operation on 8 July when she, as well as French [...] guns, fired blanks to cover the fire of the brand-new 12-inch Dominion Battery at Adinkerke bombarding the Tirpitz Battery. She was fitted with dummy second funnel to make the Germans think that she was a new monitor. The idea was to deceive the Germans as to the true origin of the shells landing around the battery, but the Germans were not totally deceived and retaliated against the French guns. Shortly afterwards they deployed a smokescreen to hide the battery which hampered spotting and they also located the Dominion Battery and fired against it.|$|E

The designated primary mission of the M58 Wolf is provide troop cover, counter electronic sensors, munitions guidance systems, and standard night vision.

The best the enemy can do in this situation is to blanket the smoky area with rounds, which would ultimately lead to few kills and lots of <b>wasted</b> <b>ammunition.</b> By blinding the enemy, countermeasures, such as laser guided missiles, are warded off; the obscured troops are safer and have {{the element of surprise}} on their side.|$|R
50|$|The French were {{equipped}} with bronze, rifled muzzle-loading artillery, while the Prussians used new steel breech-loading guns, {{which had a}} far longer range and a faster rate of fire. Prussian gunners strove for {{a high rate of}} fire, which was discouraged in the French army in the belief that it <b>wasted</b> <b>ammunition.</b> In addition, the Prussian artillery batteries had 30% more guns than their French counterparts. The Prussian guns typically opened fire at a range of 2 - 3 km, beyond the range of French artillery or the Chassepot rifle. The Prussian batteries could thus destroy French artillery with impunity, before being moved forward to directly support infantry attacks.|$|R
60|$|After {{leaving the}} Mission-house {{we made our}} way, {{comparatively}} unmolested, past the base of Mount Kenia, which the Masai call 'Donyo Egere', or the 'speckled mountain', {{on account of the}} black patches of rock that appear upon its mighty spire, where the sides are too precipitous to allow of the snow lying on them; then on past the lonely lake Baringo, where one of our two remaining Askari, having unfortunately trodden on a puff-adder, died of snake-bite, in spite of all our efforts to save him. Thence we proceeded a distance of about a hundred and fifty miles to another magnificent snow-clad mountain called Lekakisera, which has never, {{to the best of my}} belief, been visited before by a European, but which I cannot now stop to describe. There we rested a fortnight, and then started out into the trackless and uninhabited forest of a vast district called Elgumi. In this forest alone there are more elephants than I ever met with or heard of before. The mighty mammals literally swarm there entirely unmolested by man, and only kept down by the natural law that prevents any animals increasing beyond the capacity of the country they inhabit to support them. Needless to say, however, we did not shoot many of them, first because we could not afford to <b>waste</b> <b>ammunition,</b> of which our stock was getting perilously low, a donkey loaded with it having been swept away in fording a flooded river; and secondly, because we could not carry away the ivory, and did not wish to kill for the mere sake of slaughter. So we let the great beasts be, only shooting one or two in self-protection. In this district, the elephants, being unacquainted with the hunter and his tender mercies, would allow one to walk up to within twenty yards of them in the open, while they stood, with their great ears cocked for all the world like puzzled and gigantic puppy-dogs, and stared at that new and extraordinary phenomenon -- man. Occasionally, when the inspection did not prove satisfactory, the staring ended in a trumpet and a charge, but this did not often happen. When it did we had to use our rifles. Nor were elephants the only wild beasts in the great Elgumi forest. All sorts of large game abounded, including lions -- confound them! I have always hated the sight of a lion since one bit my leg and lamed me for life. As a consequence, another thing that abounded was the dreadful tsetse fly, whose bite is death to domestic animals. Donkeys have, together with men, hitherto been supposed to enjoy a peculiar immunity from its attacks; but all I have to say, whether it was on account of their poor condition, or because the tsetse in those parts is more poisonous than usual, I do not know, but ours succumbed to its onslaught. Fortunately, however, that was not till two months or so after the bites had been inflicted, when suddenly, after a two days' cold rain, they all died, and on removing the skins of several of them I found the long yellow streaks upon the flesh which are characteristic of death from bites from the tsetse, marking the spot where the insect had inserted his proboscis. On emerging from the great Elgumi forest, we, still steering northwards, in accordance with the information Mr Mackenzie had collected from the unfortunate wanderer who reached him only to die so tragically, struck the base in due course of the large lake, called Laga by the natives, which is about fifty miles long by twenty broad, and of which, it may be remembered, he made mention. Thence we pushed on nearly a month's journey over great rolling uplands, something like those in the Transvaal, but diversified by patches of bush country.|$|E

25|$|The Germans {{appreciated}} that constant patrols by destroyers was both wasteful {{of time and}} resources of those ships, and left them open to attack. Instead, they designed defensive minefields to prevent enemy ships approaching and freed up the destroyers for duties escorting larger ships. In the future, ships were never to be sent out one by one. The British realised it was foolish to have sent Arethusa into battle with inadequate training and jammed guns. British ships were criticised for having fired considerable ammunition and torpedoes with little effect: this criticism later proved counter-productive when at the Battle of Dogger Bank, ships became excessively cautious of <b>wasting</b> <b>ammunition</b> and thus missed opportunities to damage enemy vessels.|$|R

While training doctrines for machine pistols vary between armies, in general, soldiers are instructed to use the weapon for short bursts, rather than for an uninterrupted period of automatic fire, because the weapon easily gets {{out of control in}} sustained firing, which means that many of the rounds may be off target. As well, given the high rate of fire of machine pistols, sustained firing <b>wastes</b> <b>ammunition</b> and can easily deplete the magazine too quickly.|$|R
