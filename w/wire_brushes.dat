25|$|Sergeant Jones {{was given}} the overall {{responsibility}} for Bombe maintenance by Edward Travis. Later Squadron Leader {{and not to be}} confused with Eric Jones, he was one of the original bombe maintenance engineers, and experienced in BTM techniques. Welchman said that later in the war when other people tried to maintain them, they realised how lucky they were to have him. About 15 million delicate <b>wire</b> <b>brushes</b> on the drums had to make reliable contact with the terminals on the template. There were 104 brushes per drum, 720 drums per bombe, and ultimately around 200 bombes.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} {{simulate}} Enigma rotors, each rotor drum of the bombe had two complete sets of contacts, one for input towards the reflector {{and the other}} for output from the reflector, so that the reflected signal could pass back through a separate set of contacts. Each drum had 104 <b>wire</b> <b>brushes,</b> which made contact with the plate onto which they were loaded. The brushes and the corresponding set of contacts on the plate were arranged in four concentric circles of 26. The outer pair of circles (input and output) were equivalent to the current in an Enigma passing in one direction through the scrambler, and the inner pair equivalent to the current flowing in the opposite direction.|$|E
25|$|Many {{standard}} {{shop and}} woodworking tools {{may be used}} in the process of creating or maintaining deadwood on bonsai. Pliers are used to grip and break off branches for jin, and are also useful for ripping off strips of bark for jin or shari. Manual tools like graving chisels, burins, and blades can carve detail into the surface of the jins or shari, since real or simulated woodgrain is an important characteristic of deadwood on a bonsai. Recent years have seen bonsai practitioners adopt powered tools for deadwood work, particularly small rotary tools for carving and grinding. When shaping is completed, a gas torch burns off remaining small shreds of wood fiber and helps raise the grain in a newly exposed piece of wood. Finally, <b>wire</b> <b>brushes</b> and sanding aids remove toolmarks and simulate weathering.|$|E
40|$|A {{surgical}} {{device for}} removing unwanted tissue is disclosed. The surgical device includes a housing having a cavity with a lateral opening. The {{ends of the}} cavity are enclosed by an endplate and at a distal end by a motor mount. The motor mount provides for the mounting of a pneumatic motor. The pneumatic motor drives a cylindrical <b>wire</b> <b>brush.</b> The cylindrical <b>wire</b> <b>brush</b> includes a plurality of wire bristles extending radially from a central shaft. The pneumatic motor rotatably drives the central shaft at a first end and a high speed bearing mounted in the end plate supports the central shaft at a second end. The cylindrical <b>wire</b> <b>brush</b> extends out of the lateral opening in the cavity a predetermined dimension (X). The predetermined dimension may be adjusted with an adjustment mechanism provided to vary the depth of tissue removal. The cavity includes an evacuation chamber that terminates at an evacuation port. The evacuation chamber accumulates unwanted tissue that has been removed and provides a conduit through which the waste tissue {{is removed from the}} cavity. Additionally disclosed is a method of removing unwanted tissue by extending the cylindrical <b>wire</b> <b>brush</b> outside the lateral opening of the cavity the predetermined dimension (X), actuating the cylindrical <b>wire</b> <b>brush</b> within the cavity, removing the unwanted tissue with the cylindrical <b>wire</b> <b>brush,</b> confining the removed tissue within the cavity, and evacuating the removed tissue through the evacuation chamber and evacuation port...|$|R
40|$|An {{ultrafine}} grain {{surface layer}} with average crystallite size of 28 nm was produced on annealed mild steel through a <b>wire</b> <b>brushing</b> process. The effects of {{grain size reduction}} on the inhibition performance of sodium phosphate were investigated using polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. The crystal grain size of <b>wire</b> <b>brushed</b> surface was analyzed by X-ray diffractometry (XRD) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). The electrochemical tests were conducted in artificial sea water (ASW) in the presence and absence of 250 mg/lit sodium phosphate (SP). The <b>wire</b> <b>brushed</b> surface indicated considerable deformed plastic flows and high surface roughness. Due to the accumulated strains, a deformed layer with thickness of 20 ± 5 μm was produced and the crystal grain size of severe deformed zone was about 28 nm. <b>Wire</b> <b>brushed</b> surface increased uniform corrosion rate of mild steel due to enhanced surface roughness and preferential sites to adsorption of corrosive ions. However, the <b>wire</b> <b>brushed</b> surface showed {{a positive effect on}} inhibition performance of sodium phosphate. The electrochemical results revealed that average inhibition efficiency increased from 65 to about 80 percent in ASW solution containing 1. 5 mM Na 3 PO 4 for coarse grained samples in comparison to that of ultra-fined grain samples respectively. The <b>wire</b> <b>brushing</b> process encouraged passivity on the surface in SP-containing solution due to a high density of nucleation sites which increased the adsorption of phosphate ions leading to a high fraction of passive layers and low corrosion rates...|$|R

500|$|At its peak, {{the farm}} {{delivered}} milk to areas from Albany to New York City. After it was cooled, the milk was brought daily to the dairy-processing building, {{where it was}} poured into a large, sterilized tank and forced—with compressed air at [...] per minute—through sterilized pipes to the building's second floor. There the milk was cooled, strained five times and bottled. The bottles were sealed with parchment circles with the supervising commission's certification and the date, and then put in boxes with ice. The entire process, from entering the building to bottling, took five minutes. Every utensil contacting the milk (or workers) would be regularly sterilized with live steam. The building was as free of bacteria as the farm could make it; its rooms had white-tiled walls and floors, with coving (concave tiling) between the walls and floors for better cleaning. Milk bottles were reused after several cleanings with rotating <b>wire</b> <b>brushes</b> and two hours of heat sterilization.|$|E
500|$|The soundtrack is {{composed}} by the electronic musician Amon Tobin, composers James Dooley and Mel Wesson, and electric cellist Martin Tillman, {{under the direction}} of Sony's music manager, Jonathan Mayer. Tobin was specifically brought on board due to his recent trend of blurring the lines between music and sound design as exhibited in his then-recent album, Foley Room. Instead of using traditional instruments, the team sought to use sounds that results from objects that would be found in an urban environment and using such objects in combination with other instruments used in non-traditional manners; for example, bungee cords were strung alongside a bass drum and strummed, and <b>wire</b> <b>brushes</b> were hit against a suspended tuba. The music was divided between Tobin, who worked on the in-game music, and Dooley who worked on the music for the cinematics; the two worked together to make sure common musical themes were present in both aspects. Tillman was brought in late to the process to add the cello sounds, but the group was so impressed with his work that they remixed already-completed pieces to incorporate his contribution further. Manchester music group, Working for a Nuclear Free City were commissioned by Sony to produce a song for the game. The song was penned [...] "Silent Melody" [...] and was used in one of the game's promotional trailers. The soundtrack was released for digital download from the iTunes Store in May 2009.|$|E

50|$|A {{wire brush}} {{is a tool}} {{consisting}} of a brush whose bristles are made of wire, most often steel wire. The steel used is generally a medium- to high-carbon variety and very hard and springy. Other <b>wire</b> <b>brushes</b> feature bristles made from brass or stainless steel, depending on application. Wires in a wire brush can be held together by epoxy, staples, or other binding. <b>Wire</b> <b>brushes</b> usually either have a handle of wood or plastic (for handheld use) or are formed into a wheel for use on angle grinders, bench grinders, pistol-grip drill motors, or other power tools.|$|E

40|$|Surface {{finishing}} treatments such as {{shot blasting}} and <b>wire</b> <b>brushing</b> can be beneficial {{in improving the}} integrity of machined surfaces of austenitic stainless steels. These operations optimize in-service properties such as resistance to pitting corrosion and stress corrosion cracking (SCC).

The surfaces were then characterized by their hardness, surface residual stress state, and resistance to stress corrosion and pitting corrosion.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{hammering}} by <b>wire</b> <b>brush</b> {{as a method}} of improving low cycle fatigue life of highly ductile austenitic stainless steel AISI 304 have been investigated through an experimental study combining imposed strain fatigue tests and assessment of surface characteristic changes under cyclic loading by SEM examinations and XRD analysis. It has been shown that the fatigue life of <b>wire</b> <b>brush</b> hammered surface was increased by 307 % at an imposed strain rate of 0. 2 % and only 17 % at an imposed strain rate of 0. 5 %, comparatively to the turned surface. This increase in fatigue life is explained in terms of fatigue damage that is related to crack networks characteristics and stability which are generated during fatigue on both turned and <b>wire</b> <b>brush</b> hammered surfaces. The improvement of brushed surface is attributed {{to the role of the}} surface topography, the near surface stabilized compressive residual stresses and superﬁ-cial cold work hardening on the fatigue crack network nucleation and growth. It is found that <b>wire</b> <b>brush</b> hammering produces a surface texture that favors, under cyclic loading, nucleation of randomly dispersed short cracks of the order of 40 lm in length stabilized by the compressive residual stress ﬁeld that reached a value of r 0 = 749 MPa. In contrast, turned surface showed much longer unstable cracks of the order of 200 lm in length nucleated in the machining groves with high tendency to propagate under the effect of tensile residual stress ﬁeld that reached value of r 0 = 476 MPa. This improvement is limited to strain rates lower than 0. 5 %. At higher strain rates, a cyclic plastic deformation induced martensitic phase alters furthermore the fatigue behavior by producing high cyclic strengthening of the bulk mate-rial. This phenomenon lead to a reduction in strain imposed fatigue life. It has also been established that <b>wire</b> <b>brush</b> hammering can be used as an onsite surface treatment to improve the residual fatigue life of components subjected to cyclic loading. The efﬁciency of this treatment is demonstrated if it is performed at a fraction of service lifetime Ni/Nr lower than 0. 5...|$|R
