2500|$|The {{audition}} process proved difficult, {{as some of}} Akingbola's {{close friends}} were also considered for the part. He was dually motivated {{by the prospect of}} financial security, and the role itself. Enthused by the character outline, he tailored his performance to the detailed breakdown he was given, and attended his audition dressed in the style he believed Malick would wear. Akingbola recalls, [...] "They were very open with me, encouraging me to push it further and make him more aggressive." [...] The producers were flexible when it came to his interpretation of the character, and Akingbola believes it was his intense portrayal which secured him the role. He explained: [...] "They were looking for someone to put the flesh on the character, and that's what I did. I even wondered whether I was pushing it too much, as people might have wondered how such an extreme person could be a doctor. But I think that's <b>what</b> <b>got</b> <b>me</b> the part in the end – {{they were looking for a}} character who would be in people's faces, be a bit dangerous and speak his mind!" [...] Following his successful audition, Akingbola began filming in September 2010. It took several months for him to become accustomed to the job security; initially he took extra roles before arriving to film Holby City. His first episode as Malick aired in January 2011.|$|E

So she allowed that she'd go down to Sacramento, and get some things agin her and Seth bein' married next month, and she reckoned she wouldn't trouble you nor the school agin. Hark till I've done, Mr. Ford," [...] he continued, as the young man made a slight movement of deprecation. [...] "Well, I agreed.
