25|$|Summerall {{told the}} rest of CBS crew {{to get ready for}} a {{roll-out}} pass, because without any timeouts remaining a failed run play would end the game. Landry <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>he</b> expected a rollout pass attempt because an incompletion would stop the clock and allow the Packers one more play on fourth down, either for a touchdown (to win) or a field goal attempt (to tie and send the game into overtime). But Green Bay's pass protection on the slick field had been seriously tested during the game; the Cowboys had sacked Starr eight times.|$|E
25|$|Brando {{would later}} say in his 2015 documentary, Listen to me Marlon, {{that he felt}} the part in On the Waterfront that won him an Oscar was to him personally, not good, and that {{he knew he had}} done better acting. In the behind the scenes of On the Waterfront film experts and critics <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>he</b> would change lines because he didn't like the script, and that he'd let the {{director}} know by having regular conversations. However, This was a way for Brando to prepare before a scene by warming up before starting the dialogue, in order to deliver it as natural as possible. Brando often saw a shrink, and reportedly wasn't there for some of the shooting of the scene when the close up was on the opposite actor. This is why this part of his technique is recognized mistakenly as him being difficult, and not a part of his approach.|$|E
500|$|For his efforts, Gravel {{attracted}} some attention: famed writer Norman Mailer <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>he</b> [...] "provided considerable excitement" [...] and was [...] "good-looking {{enough to}} have played leads in B-films", while Rolling Stone correspondent Hunter S. Thompson said Gravel [...] "probably said {{a few things that}} might have been worth hearing, under different circumstances ..." [...] Yet, the whole process had been doubly disastrous for the Democrats. The time consumed with the nominating and seconding and other speeches of all the vice-presidential candidates had lost the attention of the delegates on the floor and pushed McGovern's speech until 3:30a.m. The haste with which Eagleton had been selected led to surprise when his past mental health treatments were revealed; he withdrew from the ticket soon after the convention, to be replaced by Sargent Shriver.|$|E

"To Zion," [...] {{among the}} more introspective tracks on the album, spoke about how Hill's family comes before her career and her {{decision}} to have her first child, even though many at the time encouraged her to abort the pregnancy, so as to not conflict with her burgeoning career. In an interview she discussed the song's origin and significance, commenting [...] "Names wouldn't come when I was ready to have him. The only name that came to me was Zion. I was like, 'is Zion {{too much of a}} weight to carry?' But this little boy, man. I <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>he</b> personally delivered me from my emotional and spiritual drought. He just replenished my newness. When he was born, I felt like I was born again."

500|$|On 12 December 2008, Che was {{screened}} at New York City's {{sold out}} 1,100 person Ziegfeld Theater. Upon seeing the first {{image on the}} screen (a silhouette of Cuba), the crowd erupted into a raucous cry of [...] "¡Viva, Cuba!" [...] Following the film, and the standing ovation it received, Soderbergh appeared for a post program Q During the sometimes contentious conversation with the audience, in which Soderbergh alternated between defensiveness and modesty, the director categorized Guevara as [...] "a hard ass", to which one audience member yelled out, [...] "Bullshit, he was a murderer!" [...] The filmmaker settled down the crowd and explained, [...] "It doesn't matter whether I agree with him or not—I was interested in Che as a warrior, Che {{as a guy who}} had an ideology, who picked up a gun and this was the result. He died the way you would have him die. He was executed the way you <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>he</b> executed other people". Soderbergh ended the 1 am Q session by noting that he was [...] "agnostic" [...] on Che's standing, but [...] "loyal to the facts", which he insisted were all rigorously sourced.|$|E
500|$|In 2000, Conan sidekick Andy Richter {{left the}} show, and Weinberg became the [...] "second banana". Weinberg {{continued}} {{to present an}} obvious visual foil: as O'Brien said, [...] "If you looked at this guy you would never know he was the drummer in a huge rock 'n' roll band. You <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>he</b> {{was the guy who}} did the band's accounting. But Max is the authoritative, buttoned-down adult {{in the midst of all}} this madness." [...] The drummer reveled in O'Brien's youthful audience: [...] "To be 49 and appreciated by 14-year-olds again? What a thrill!" [...] Weinberg engaged in stare-downs with O'Brien and gave scripted screeds about newsmakers. [...] Additionally, Weinberg was comically presented as a twisted character with sexual fetishes and homicidal tendencies in comedy bits. When Conan O'Brien was host of Saturday Night Live on March 10, 2001, his monologue featured a visit from the SNL studio to the Late Night studio (only a few floors apart in the same building, 30 Rockefeller Plaza), where Conan discovers Weinberg engaged in sexual intercourse with a woman on his desk (played by Max's real-life wife, Becky). [...] Weinberg says of his comic persona: [...] "t's playing against type. I've been happily married for nearly 30 years, with two wonderful children. It's not what I portray on the show, and that's funny." [...] Weinberg continued his one-man college shows, now titled [...] "E Street to Late Night: Dreams Found, Lost, and Found Again".|$|E

500|$|In December 1952, the Hensley {{brothers}} {{bought into}} the Ruidoso Downs racetrack in New Mexico, with Eugene running it and Jim returning to Phoenix. [...] In a May 1953 hearing before the New Mexico State Racing Commission, the Hensley brothers concealed the existence an equal partner, Clarence [...] "Teak" [...] Baldwin, who had been banned from any ownership role due to illegal bookmaking activities. [...] A 1953 New Mexico State Police investigation found further that Kemper Marley was a financial backer for bookmakers and had connections with Baldwin and with the bookmaking operations of organized crime, a conclusion echoed decades later by the Arizona Project investigative reporting team. [...] The Hensley brothers gained their Ruidoso Downs racetrack license in 1953, as no New Mexico law barred convicted felons from race track ownership, although in 1955 new Governor of New Mexico John F. Simms <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>he</b> was [...] "appalled" [...] by the previous administration's decision to do so. [...] Previous Governor Edwin L. Mechem had defended the approval, saying that the Hensleys had been under constant surveillance and deserved continued attention, but that no action was taken against them because the investigation showed that as race tracks go, all laws apparently were being observed. [...] Jim Hensley would sell his interest in Ruidoso Downs to his brother Eugene in 1955 (who would in turn sell it to a Marley-connected company in 1969).|$|E

2500|$|Albert Gleizes, Jean Metzinger, Duchamp-Villon, and Jacques Villon are {{currently}} exhibiting at the Der Sturm gallery in Berlin. Jean Metzinger represents an extremely sophisticated art.

Four days later, on May 25, Simmons reversed himself again, and suspended his campaign, saying he could not compete financially with McMahon's deep pockets.
