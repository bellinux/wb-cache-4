5|$|Kyle, Cartman and Kenny {{surprise}} Stan {{by creating}} a Facebook account for him. Stan protests, but is quickly pressured by family and friends to add them as friends. To his annoyance and frustration, Stan finds people such as Randy, his grandmother and even Wendy confronting him over his supposed disregard for them and judging his real-world friendship solely by his Facebook configuration. Meanwhile, Kyle adds shy nerdy student Kip Drordy (anagram: Dorky Drip) to his thriving friends list out of pity. Kyle's number of Facebook friends rapidly declines when he does this, {{in part due to}} a Mad Friends podcast he finds Cartman has set up in which he berates Kyle for choosing a loser as a friend and asserts nobody will <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hang</b> out with Kyle. Kyle understands this, but, on principle and out of pity, cannot bring himself to delete Kip to please others. Desperate to stem the loss of friends, he asks Cartman for advice. Cartman introduces Kyle to Chatroulette as a way to make new friends, which fails as most {{of the people on the}} site are either jacking off or showing their genitals, until Cartman finally finds another Jewish kid named Isiah, who agrees to be Kyle's friend, much to Kyle's delight.|$|E
500|$|Stan {{goes to the}} doctor, who, after {{examining}} him, diagnoses him as a [...] "cynical asshole". From ice cream to movie trailers, Stan can now only see the bad in things, and this negative outlook alienates him from Kyle, Kenny, and Cartman, who begin avoiding him. When Stan catches them secretly {{going to the movies}} without him after lying about having the flu, he comes along, only for his attitude to ruin the trailers and Kyle, Kenny, and Cartman leave the theater. Cartman then coldly informs Stan that they do not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hang</b> out with him anymore and leaves with Kenny. As Stan and Kyle argue over this, Stan literally sees Kyle as a large piece of feces that defecates instead of talking, indicating that he sees them as [...] "shit".|$|E
500|$|For Dicen Que Soy, George picked {{songs that}} had been {{previously}} recorded by female Latin singers such as Rocío Jurado and Lupita D'Alessio, {{with a focus on}} feminist lyrics. George, India, and Shirley Marte also wrote love songs ("Dejate Amar" [...] and [...] "No Me Conviene") for the album and added India's cover of George Benson's song [...] "I Just <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Hang</b> Around You" [...] as a counterbalance, in case the feminist songs did not prove popular. When describing the production, India said that [...] "This is me, my flavor in a tropical way, and showing what I can do with my voice." [...] The theme of the title track's lyrics revolves the singer being criticized by gossips without caring about their opinions. Puerto Rican singer Tito Nieves is featured on the song [...] "No Me Conviene" [...] and [...] "Vivir lo Nuestro" [...] was included as a bonus track for the album. [...] Musically, the production mixes romantic and hard salsa music along with funk and timba. The record took four months to complete.|$|E

500|$|On March 21, 2005, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Ryan Merriman, co-stars of The Ring Two (2005), {{were cast}} as Wendy Christensen and Kevin Fischer. Winstead, who had auditioned {{for the second}} Final Destination film, won the role because her {{portrayal}} of the character's emotion impressed Wong and Morgan. Wong {{said that he had}} originally intended for Wendy to be a [...] "perky blonde" [...] and reworked the character slightly after Winstead was cast; he believed the actors were right for their roles. On Winstead, he said that [...] " [...] a kind of soulfulness to her role as Wendy" [...] and her character [...] "is deeply affected by the accident, but she's strong, and fights to maintain control". On Merriman, he said that [...] "the moment [...] came in I thought he was the right guy to play Kevin" [...] and described the character as [...] "the kind of guy you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hang</b> out with, your goofy best buddy, but also someone who could rise to the occasion and become a hero".|$|E
500|$|... "Make Me Over" [...] was {{inspired}} by the band's love of British rock, while strains of [...] "Learn You Inside Out" [...] were inspired by the Plastic Ono Band. When asked about the song [...] "Learn You Inside Out", Wade said, [...] "I wrote it really quick. We decided just to freestyle. It was one of those moments when we really grew as a band, being able to reach each other and know where we're going." [...] The song [...] "Disarray" [...] {{was inspired}} by Wade's strict and religious family. When asked about the song, he said, [...] "Angels, demons. We all fight them both, and anyone who pretends they don’t is not someone I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hang</b> out with." [...] "Storm" [...] was originally written by Wade at the age of sixteen, when he was going through difficult times. When asked about the song in an interview, Wade said, [...] "That was fun to record because of its starkness. We love the idea of the title, surrounded by negative space, like the a cappella beginning. Because when you’re lost in confusion, no matter how much is going on around you, you’re still alone." ...|$|E
500|$|The tour {{concluded}} with the November 22, 2009, show at HSBC Arena in Buffalo, New York. [...] Fans came {{from far away}} and the show dominated {{the feel of the}} city that day. [...] The full album played was Springsteen's first, Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J., which he wryly said [...] "was the miracle. This was the record that took everything from way below zero to ... one." [...] The performance of it was dedicated to his first manager and producer, Mike Appel, who was present in the audience, and featured quite rare renditions of [...] "Mary Queen of Arkansas" [...] and (the first ever with the E Street Band) [...] "The Angel". [...] Other rarities peppered the 34-song, nearly 3½-hour night, including Chuck Willis's [...] "(I Don't <b>Want</b> <b>to)</b> <b>Hang</b> Up My Rock and Roll Shoes" [...] and, to mark Steven Van Zandt's birthday, totally obscure outtake [...] "Restless Nights" [...] (supposedly Van Zandt's favorite Springsteen song) and a now-unusual second song from the current album, [...] "Surprise Surprise". [...] Near the end he said, [...] "So we're gonna say goodbye, but just for a little while ... a very little while ..." [...] The tour finished not with the emotional statement in song that some other Springsteen tours have in the 2000s, but instead with John Fogerty's [...] "Rockin' All Over the World".|$|E

2500|$|Even {{before the}} film came out, Lake was dubbed [...] "the find of 1941". However Lake {{did not think}} this meant {{she would have a}} long career and {{maintained}} her goal was to be a surgeon. [...] "Only the older actors keep on a long time ... I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hang</b> on after I've reached a peak. I'll go back to medical school", she said. Paramount announced two follow up movies, China Pass and Blonde Venus.

2500|$|On 12 October 1943, {{the legendary}} Lt Col Ernesto Botto (who {{had lost a}} leg while serving as a fighter pilot in Spain, but had {{continued}} to fly operationally during 1940-43), the newly appointed Undersecretary of the New Republican Air Force, appealed over the [...] radio for airmen to enlist, and Gorrini, together with 6,996 others, {{did not hesitate to}} rejoin in combat against the Anglo-American forces: [...] "After flying for three years {{side by side with the}} German pilots, on the English Channel, in North Africa, Greece, Egypt, Tunisia and finally over my own homeland, I had made friends with some of them, particularly from JG27… I did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hang</b> my coat in the wind, so to speak, and perhaps fire on my German friends. Also, I wanted to protect the northern Italian towns from indiscriminate bombing as much as possible." ...|$|E
2500|$|For {{twenty years}} from the early 1980s, Anger {{released}} no new material. In 2000, {{at the dawn of}} the new millennium, Anger began screening a new short film, the anti-smoking Don't Smoke That Cigarette, followed a year later by The Man We <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Hang,</b> which comprised images of Aleister Crowley's paintings that had been exhibited at a temporary exhibition in Bloomsbury, London. In 2004, he began showing Anger Sees Red, a short surrealistic film starring himself, and the same year also began showing another work, Patriotic Penis. He soon followed this with a flurry of other shorts, including Mouse Heaven, which consisted of images of Mickey Mouse memorabilia, Ich Will! and Uniform Attraction, all of which he showed at various public appearances. Anger's most recent project has been the Technicolor Skull with musician Brian Butler, described as a [...] "magick ritual of light and sound in the context of a live performance", in which Anger plays the theremin, and Butler plays the guitar and other electronic instruments, behind a psychedelic backdrop of colors and skulls.|$|E
