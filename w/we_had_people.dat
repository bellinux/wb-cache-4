500|$|People {{are always}} {{using the word}} Illuminati but they're always {{referencing}} it in an incorrect way. People often accuse me of {{being a member of}} the Illuminati and I think in today's pop culture the Illuminati is perceived as a group of powerful, successful people who are working behind the scenes to control the universe. Not people with consciousness, not people who are enlightened. So people were accusing me of {{being a member of the}} Illuminati, and I kept going, wait—so first I had to figure out what that meant...I know who the real Illuminati are, and I know where that word comes from. The real Illuminati were a group of scientists, artists, philosophers, writers, who came about in what is referred to as the Age of Enlightenment, after the Dark Ages, when there was no writing and no art and no creativity and no spirituality, and life was really at a standstill. And right after that, everything flourished. So <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>people</b> like Shakespeare and Leonardo Da Vinci and Michaelangelo and Isaac Newton, and all these great minds and great thinkers, and they were called Illuminati...It had nothing to do with money and power. Of course they were powerful, because they influenced people. But their goal was to inspire and enlighten. So when people refer to me as a member of the Illuminati, I always want to say thank you. Thank you for putting me in that category.|$|E

That month we had thirty-five missionaries and we had one pound a week for that month. That was all <b>we</b> <b>had!</b> <b>People</b> said to us, 'You’d better give up. Your founder is dead, the mission is so weak, give up.' But we learned, mainly through Rees Howells, to change our whole attitude and the Lord told us not to give up. The Lord talked to us about going to the world and we laughed. Here we were two missionaries at home, thirty-five starving missionaries on the field and the Lord is speaking to us about going to the world! How does anything get done? By faith of course! Faith is the ability, inspired by the Spirit, to believe something offered to you. It isn’t I doing it, it is Him doing it.” ...|$|E

The version was recorded by the Monty Babson Big Band with Holder adding his vocals to it. In a 1986 fan club interview, Holder spoke of the version: [...] "It came about originally because a few people asked us for demos of songs to cover. A lot of people wanted to cover [...] "My Oh My". I mean 'middle of the road' sort of people. Colin actually suggested it, saying we couldn't send them our own version, because they've all heard that. Anyway, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>people</b> like Frank Sinatra saying {{that we ought to}} do a 'swing version' of it. Well, we weren't going to do it, so we got a mate of ours - Monty Babson - to sing it on the original demo, which went out to all these 'middle of the road' people. When I heard it, I really liked it, so as an added extra on the 12", I said [...] "Why don't we put my voice with Monty Babson's band?" [...] and that's what we did.

5000|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{connection}} to Interstate 76/Interstate 77 opened, {{it became clear that}} the Innerbelt would not live up to expectations; those not served by the western ramps were not very willing to travel over five blocks of marginal roads to connect to a 2.24 mi freeway. However, the Innerbelt’s underuse has given it an advantage few planners had foreseen. In July 2001, the city announced that the Innerbelt would be closed for several days while a commercial was being shot. [...] The highway was also surveyed by the producers of The Matrix Reloaded movie as a possible shooting spot of the highway scene. Peter Novak, the Matrix's location scout said that [...] "They were looking at finding a practical freeway to film the car chase on, which was going to be about 6 to 7 weeks of shutting down a major freeway. It was originally thought that they needed 4 to 5 miles of super highway in both directions. We sent scouts out around the world: <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>people</b> looking around Kuala Lumpur, people looking at Bangkok, people looking at the autobahn in Germany, and I personally looked through the northern United States. I don’t think we left a stone unturned, and we wound up with a freeway in Akron..." [...] The idea was eventually scrapped, because in the event that the scene would have to be reshot, the time to reset all the cars in their start position would take too long.|$|E

5000|$|Their fifth single, [...] "Love Song" [...] was {{released}} in August but did not chart. They released their debut album, The Loved Ones' Magic Box, in October, which essentially was a collection of the band's singles. W&G Records was unable to co-ordinate releases with the band's touring, The Loved Ones split in late October, two years after they formed. [...] The split was a non-event. We had been in Perth for two weeks on what felt like a very long tour. A miserable tour by the end. It started off so well. We were mobbed {{at the airport and}} smuggled off in the caterer's van. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>people</b> who spotted us and chased the cars that whisked us off, waving their autograph books in vain. We did TV, we did radio, we did concerts, we did a trip round Albany, Kalgoorlie and other places on the way - one-nighters - but the record company, W&G, hadn't thought to put any records in the shops. Anyway, {{at the end of the}} tour the promoters disappeared. I can't remember if we even had our tickets home. We got back to Melbourne broke and completely dispirited. People tell me our last gig was at Opus (Ormond Hall in Prahran) but I have to say I haven't any recollection of it.
