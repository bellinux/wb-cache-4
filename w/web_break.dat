40|$|Abstract The {{ambition}} {{to increase the}} production of paper has made paper machine runnability widely studied in recent decades. Paper machine runnability is often measured {{by the number of}} web breaks in comparison with paper machine speed. When runnability is good, a machine can be run at the desired speed with the least possible number of breaks. <b>Web</b> <b>break</b> sensitivity means the number of breaks in a day, which can also be understood as a measurement of paper machine runnability. This study presents an application for the evaluation of <b>web</b> <b>break</b> sensitivity in a paper machine. A <b>web</b> <b>break</b> sensitivity indicator was built using the basic principles of case-based reasoning with a linguistic equations approach and basic fuzzy logic. The indicator combines on-line measurement data with expert knowledge and provides a continuous indication of break sensitivity. <b>Web</b> <b>break</b> sensitivity defines the current operating situation at the paper mill and provides new information to operators. <b>Web</b> <b>break</b> sensitivity is presented as a continuous signal with information about actual web breaks depicted as an eight-hour trend. The trend shows how the situation has developed and the current value gives a prediction for the next 24 hours if the situation stays as it is now. Together with information about the most important variables, this prediction gives operators enough time to react to the changing operating situation. From the methodological point of view, a new tool for building case-based reasoning applications for other purposes was also tested and found to be suitable for diagnostic applications...|$|E

40|$|This paper empirically {{investigates the}} effect of {{advanced}} manufacturing technology on process stability during flexible production in a process industry. A sample of 61 North American fine paper plants is {{used to examine the}} relationship between the level of automation installed for controlling changes between paper grades and the incidence of paper <b>web</b> <b>breaks.</b> These <b>web</b> <b>breaks</b> are catastrophic failures; they require the entire plant to be stopped, reinitialized, and restarted. Because a large fraction of breaks occurs shortly after changeovers, they are an important determinant of the aspect of plant flexibility, called mobility, or the ability to move between products with only small penalties. In an attempt to ensure stable and mobile production, many plants have implemented changeover automation. We find, however, that higher levels of this automation are significantly associated with higher rates of catastrophic failure among the plants studied. We suggest that this finding becomes less paradoxical when considered in light of a recent stream of research on advanced manufacturing technologies, loosely called the usability perspective. According to this perspective, automation designed and implemented with the narrow, technical goal of replacing human operators or removing their discretion over a production process is misguided, especially in environments in which requirements are changing rapidly...|$|R

40|$|Web breaks are {{considered}} {{as one of the}} most significant runnability problems in a pressroom. This work concerns the analysis of relation between various parameters (variables) characterizing the paper, printing press, the printing process and the <b>web</b> <b>break</b> occurrence. A large number of variables, 61 in total, obtained off-line as well as measured online during the printing process are used in the investigation. Each paper reel is characterized by a vector x of 61 components. Two main approaches are explored. The first one treats the problem as a data classification task into "break" and "non break" classes. The procedures of classifier training, the selection of relevant input variables and the selection of hyper-parameters of the classifier are aggregated into one process based on genetic search. The second approach combines procedures of genetic search based variable selection and data mapping into a low dimensional space. The genetic search process results into a variable set providing the best mapping according to some quality function. The empirical study was performed using data collected at a pressroom in Sweden. The total number of data points available for the experiments was equal to 309. Amongst those, only 37 data points represent the <b>web</b> <b>break</b> cases. The results of the investigations have shown that the linear relations between the independent variables and the <b>web</b> <b>break</b> frequency are not strong. Three important groups of variables were identified, namely Lab data (variables characterizing paper properties and measured off-line in a paper mill lab), Ink registry (variables characterizing operator actions aimed to adjust ink registry) and Web tension. We found that the most important variables are: Ink registry Y LS MD (adjustments of yellow ink registry in machine direction on the lower paper side), Air permeability (character- izes paper porosity), Paper grammage, Elongation MD, and four variables characterizing web tension: Moment mean, Min sliding Mean, Web tension variance, and Web tension mean.

It was also possible to chart and monitor the complete wet-end section of the mill. At the board mill FBRM was used to analyse the relation between measured water parameters and variations in process and product quality.

40|$|A {{frequent}} {{problem when}} producing newsprint are web breaks, which result in down-time and wear on machine parts and hence a decreased yield. The {{purpose of this}} thesis is to identify production parameters that correlate to web breaks on paper machine 5 (PM 5) at Ortviken paper mill in Sundsvall. The focus is on findings from previous {{studies that have been}} considered to be important for the occurrence of web breaks. These are: • Variations of release angle at the open draw from press to dryer • The impact of skew paper web profiles on web breaks • Multivariate analysis of production parameters • Velocity fluctuations of the driver dryer rolls in the dryer • The impact of defects in the paper web on web breaks The thesis authors have applied the D. M. A. I. C method in the problem solving process. This method is applied within the Six Sigma improving program. The analysis of the profiles showed skewness in the machine. This skewness results in web feeding problems along with an increased risk of web breaks due to a skew web tension profile. Suggested improvements to solve this problem consisted of different calibrations and adjustments of the head box (distributes the pulp on the wire cloth), press, dryer and moisture profiles. No approximation of cost savings where measured. The velocity study of the dryer rolls in the dryer revealed a slack in the <b>web</b> <b>break</b> signal. This resulted in extra downtime and additional web breaks caused by debris swirling around in the machine. Machine components were also damaged due to this delay. The yearly cost savings of these problems was approximated to 400 000 SEK. A solution to this problem is under development as this thesis is being finalized and will be implemented during the spring of 2009. No correlations between defects in the paper and web breaks could be found. However, the analysis showed a higher density of defects {{at the edges of the}} paper web. High variations of edge actuators in the steam box, causing moisture variations at the edges, might generate these defects at the edges causing web breaks. It was also found that most web breaks started from the front side (FS) of the machine (facing the operators). Several of these web breaks could be explained by a non satisfactory solution for cutting the paper edges. Skew TSO and TSI profiles indicating a higher web tension on the front side, could also contribute to more web breaks on that side. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|E
40|$|Laser cutting {{implementation}} possibilities into paper {{making machine}} was studied {{as the main}} objective of the work. Laser cutting technology application was considered as a replacement tool for conventional cutting methods used in paper making machines for longitudinal cutting such as edge trimming at different paper making process and tambour roll slitting. Laser cutting of paper was tested in 70 ’s for the first time. Since then, laser cutting and processing has been applied for paper materials with different level of success in industry. Laser cutting can be employed for longitudinal cutting of paper web in machine direction. The most common conventional cutting methods include water jet cutting and rotating slitting blades applied in paper making machines. Cutting with CO 2 laser fulfils basic requirements for cutting quality, applicability to material and cutting speeds in all locations where longitudinal cutting is needed. Literature review provided description of advantages, disadvantages and challenges of laser technology when it was applied for cutting of paper material with particular attention to cutting of moving paper web. Based on studied laser cutting capabilities and problem definition of conventional cutting technologies, preliminary selection {{of the most promising}} application area was carried out. Laser cutting (trimming) of paper web edges in wet end was estimated to be the most promising area where it can be implemented. This assumption was {{made on the basis of}} rate of web breaks occurrence. It was found that up to 64 % of total number of web breaks occurred in wet end, particularly in location of so called open draws where paper web was transferred unsupported by wire or felt. Distribution of web breaks in machine cross direction revealed that defects of paper web edge was the main reason of tearing initiation and consequent <b>web</b> <b>break.</b> The assumption was made that laser cutting was capable of improvement of laser cut edge tensile strength due to high cutting quality and sealing effect of the edge after laser cutting. Studies of laser ablation of cellulose supported this claim. Linear energy needed for cutting was calculated with regard to paper web properties in intended laser cutting location. Calculated linear cutting energy was verified with series of laser cutting. Practically obtained laser energy needed for cutting deviated from calculated values. This could be explained by difference in heat transfer via radiation in laser cutting and different absorption characteristics of dry and moist paper material. Laser cut samples (both dry and moist (dry matter content about 25 - 40 %)) were tested for strength properties. It was shown that tensile strength and strain break of laser cut samples are similar to corresponding values of non-laser cut samples. Chosen method, however, did not address tensile strength of laser cut edge in particular. Thus, the assumption of improving strength properties with laser cutting was not fully proved. Laser cutting effect on possible pollution of mill broke (recycling of trimmed edge) was carried out. Laser cut samples (both dry and moist) were tested on the content of dirt particles. The tests revealed that accumulation of dust particles on the surface of moist samples can take place. This has to be taken into account to prevent contamination of pulp suspension when trim waste is recycled. Material loss due to evaporation during laser cutting and amount of solid residues after cutting were evaluated. Edge trimming with laser would result in 0. 25 kg/h of solid residues and 2. 5 kg/h of lost material due to evaporation. Schemes of laser cutting implementation and needed laser equipment were discussed. Generally, laser cutting system would require two laser sources (one laser source for each cutting zone), set of beam transfer and focusing optics and cutting heads. In order to increase reliability of system, it was suggested that each laser source would have double capacity. That would allow to perform cutting employing one laser source working at full capacity for both cutting zones. Laser technology is in required level at the moment and do not require additional development. Moreover, capacity of speed increase is high due to availability high power laser sources what can support the tendency of speed increase of paper making machines. Laser cutting system would require special roll to maintain cutting. The scheme of such roll was proposed as well as roll integration into paper making machine. Laser cutting can be done in location of central roll in press section, before so-called open draw where many web breaks occur, where it has potential to improve runability of a paper making machine. Economic performance of laser cutting was done as comparison of laser cutting system and water jet cutting working in the same conditions. It was revealed that laser cutting would still be about two times more expensive compared to water jet cutting. This is mainly due to high investment cost of laser equipment and poor energy efficiency of CO 2 lasers. Another factor is that laser cutting causes material loss due to evaporation whereas water jet cutting almost does not cause material loss. Despite difficulties of laser cutting implementation in paper making machine, its implementation can be beneficial. The crucial role in that is possibility to improve cut edge strength properties and consequently reduce number of web breaks. Capacity of laser cutting to maintain cutting speeds which exceed current speeds of paper making machines what is another argument to consider laser cutting technology in design of new high speed paper making machines...|$|E

A theoretical treatment has been presented, starting from Coleman's stochastic failure model to the models with structural hierarchy. Creep failure data of box and board published in the literature were analysed from {{the light of the}} proposed theoretical model. The results showed that the distribution of life time (not only mean life time) of corrugated boxes changes very sensitively with loading and environmental conditions. Generally the coefficient of variation varied from 6 % to 90 %. Another important parameter, the load sensitivity of damage growth also varied from 1. 7 to 27. Such enormous variation of the key parameters is not a mere fluctuation of experimental condition, but represents the very nature of timedependent, stochastic failure. The stochastic failure model presented provides a framework for analyzing experimental data as well as for predicting life time distributions under general fluctuating loading conditions other than creep.

40|$|International audienceIn web {{transport}} systems, {{the main}} problem is to control the web velocity and tensions independently, to prevent <b>web</b> <b>breaks,</b> folding, or damage. Interesting results have been obtained using multi-variable control strategies. Unfortunately, most of the existing methodologies are either not systematic or deal with the tracking and disturbance rejection problems as a whole, and not separately. This paper presents a complete methodology in order to design two-degrees-of-freedom (2 DOF) controller. The feedforward part {{is based on a}} reference model allowing operators to obtain the desired tracking performances (in particular, web tensions and velocity decoupling). The feedback part ensures robustness and disturbance rejection and is designed using two high-level tuning parameters only, thanks to the Standard State Control (SSC) methodology. However, the system dynamics change greatly during the winding/unwinding process due to the winder/unwinder radius and inertia variations.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} the tail {{threading}} procedure for a pulp drying plant in a Stora Enso's manufacturing plant in Finland is examined. Tools are developed {{to analyze the}} work shifts' operation during tail threading, examine the most problematic work stages and to determine causes for <b>web</b> <b>breaks.</b> The process environment and the threading procedure were studied by interviewing {{the staff at the}} plant. The threading procedure is a very complex series of work tasks, which must be completed in order. The next work stage may be started only after certain criteria are fulfilled. Hidden Markov Modelling was applied to the procedure by dividing the tasks as hidden states into two models. The observations used to distinguish the work tasks were developed according to the interviews. The developed Markov models consist of six states. The model parameters were taught using supervised learning method. The models were validated by comparing video recordings from the process environment with the state sequence estimate given by the model, and also by using Confusion Matrices between the taught and estimated system states. According to the Confusion Matrix calculations and the video material comparison, the models are found to function reliably. The wet end model's true states are confused with the other states more often than those of the dry end model. This may partly be related to the low sampling rate of the data and the short duration of the wet end work stages. The effects of inaccuracies in state recognition are minimized by post-processing the state estimates. For the dry end model state recognition a very high level of confidence was achieved (over 99 %). Key figures were defined from the state sequence estimates. In this thesis, these characteristics are simplified for presentation. The characteristics include durations in various threading stages, the number of threading efforts and the distribution of <b>web</b> <b>breaks</b> between the different stages for each of the work shifts. The analysis suggests that each work shift has strengths and weaknesses in different stages of the procedure. By further examining the shifts' operations, the most reliable methods for each work phase could be obtained. During the research for this thesis some issues with one of the process measurements were discovered. According to the measurement, the pulp web is higher than normal, and the automation system attempts to lower the web by decreasing the speed settings for the process. According to the measurement, however, the web is not lowered. These issues may greatly affect the success of the threading.
