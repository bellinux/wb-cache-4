500|$|Nathaniel Hawthorne, {{eventually}} elected {{treasurer of}} the community, did not enjoy his experience. Initially, he praised the work he was doing, boasting of [...] "what a great, broad-shouldered, elephantine personage I shall become by and by!" [...] Later, {{he wrote to his}} wife-to-be Sophia Peabody, [...] "labor is the curse of the world, and nobody can meddle with it without becoming proportionately brutified". After disassociating with the community Hawthorne demanded the return of his initial investment, though he never held any ill will with Ripley, to whom he wrote he would [...] "heartily rejoice at your success—of <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> see no reasonable doubt".|$|E

[...] A majority of Inside Man was scanned on a Northlight film scanner, while the interrogation scenes had to be scanned on a Spirit DataCine, as the negatives proved [...] "too dense for the Northlight to perform the task." ...|$|E
500|$|Once {{the fleet}} had {{returned}} to port, controversy erupted concerning Harvey's role in the battle. Although his bravery and skill were not questioned, his prominence in the dispatch sent home by Cuthbert Collingwood was. In the dispatch, Harvey was singled out over the other captains for his bravery, Collingwood writing: [...] "I have not words in <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> sufficiently express my admiration of it". As {{a result of this}} special mention, Harvey was promoted to rear-admiral on 9 November 1805, and given the honour of being one of Nelson's pallbearers at the admiral's funeral despite their short acquaintance. Harvey's new motto and his penchant for [...] "bragging" [...] further alienated him from his fellow officers.|$|E

500|$|Driberg {{was born}} on 22 May 1905 in Crowborough, a small {{dormitory}} town about [...] south of London. He was the third and youngest of three sons born to John James Street Driberg, a former officer in the Indian Civil Service, and his wife Amy Mary Irving Driberg (née Bell). The Driberg family had immigrated from Holland about 200 years previously; the Bells were lowland Scots from Dumfriesshire. John Driberg had retired in 1896 after 35 years in Assam, latterly {{as head of the}} state's police, and was 65 years old when his youngest son was born. For Tom Driberg, growing up mostly alone with his elderly parents was a stifling experience; he would later describe Crowborough as [...] "a place <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> never revisit, or think of, without a feeling of sick horror".|$|E
500|$|Amelia Gentleman of The Guardian {{described}} Lohan as [...] "better {{known for}} what is euphemistically termed a party lifestyle" [...] and said that while her participation did bring publicity to the project, the attention was uniformly negative and about her person, not the issues. Of the documentary she said that [...] "the material is potent and persuasive", but that Lohan was a [...] "constant, distracting presence". Sam Wollaston of The Guardian wrote a satirical, mocking letter ostensibly {{from the point of}} view of Lohan: [...] "Some of these kids are sent to work when they're so young. <b>Which</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> relate to because I started out working as a child model aged three, and got into movies when I was 11. I can, like, so totally understand where these people are coming from".|$|E
500|$|Smith married English-Canadian actor Christopher Grove in 1990. They were {{divorced}} in 1992, citing irreconcilable differences. She married Daniel Erickson in 2002; the marriage lasted {{for six years}} and Smith filed for divorce on May 21, 2008, citing irreconcilable differences. In a 1997 interview with The Daily Targum, Smith stated [...] "I am shy, but I have an extroverted persona <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> draw on when I need to," [...] and {{that she is a}} [...] "private" [...] actress. In 2009, she commented, [...] "People have said to me that I'm unassuming. It's true, I'm the worst celebrity ever. But I'm trying to become better." [...] Smith had bulimia since she was a teenager. She noted [...] "It would make me high, I would feel endorphins and this great sense of victory." ...|$|E

500|$|Several critics {{mentioned}} Bertin's hands. Twentieth-century {{art historian}} Albert Boime described them as [...] "powerful, vulturine... grasping his thighs in a gesture... projecting... enormous strength controlled". Some contemporary critics {{were not so}} kind. The photographer and critic Félix Tournachon was harshly critical, and disparaged {{what he saw as}} a [...] "fantastical bundle of flesh... under which, instead of bones and muscles, there can only be intestines – this flatulent hand, the rumbling of <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> hear!" [...] Bertin's hands made a different impression on the critic F. de Lagenevais, who remarked: [...] "A mediocre artist would have modified them, he would have replaced those swollen joints with the cylindrical fingers of the first handy model; but by this single alteration he would have changed the expression of the whole personality... the energetic and mighty nature".|$|E
500|$|Boycott's slow scoring led to {{increasing}} media pressure, and owing to his perceived selfish attitude, he was {{dropped from the}} team after the match. He remembered in 1987 that [...] "the decision stunned me at the time, though looking back now I see that it had become inevitable. I was mortified with embarrassment and filled with an angry, burning sense of injustice <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> remember clearly and painfully to this day." [...] A combination of low confidence and a throat infection limited Boycott to two further Test appearances, playing once more against India and once against Pakistan, {{for the rest of}} the year. He nevertheless again topped the domestic averages with 1260 at 48.46. In 1967, Boycott toured the West Indies with England, where he hit a rich seam of form. He scored 463 runs at 66.14 in a series England won 1–0.|$|E
500|$|Soon after Percy Shelley's death, Mary Shelley {{determined}} {{to write his}} biography. In a letter of 17 November 1822, she announced: [...] "I shall write his life—& thus occupy myself in the only manner from <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> derive consolation." [...] However, her father-in-law, Sir Timothy Shelley, effectively banned her from doing so. Mary began her fostering of Percy's poetic reputation in 1824 {{with the publication of}} his Posthumous Poems. In 1839, while she was working on the Lives, she prepared a new edition of his poetry, which became, in the words of literary scholar Susan J. Wolfson, [...] "the canonizing event" [...] in the history of her husband's reputation. The following year, Mary Shelley edited a volume of her husband's essays, letters, translations, and fragments, and throughout the 1830s, she introduced his poetry to a wider audience by publishing assorted works in the annual The Keepsake.|$|E

Roosevelt wrote to The Post, [...] "This is the first pictorial representation I have seen of the staunchly American values contained in the rights of free speech and free worship and our goals of freedom from fear and want." [...] Roosevelt also wrote of the corresponding essays, [...] "Their words should inspire all who read them with a deeper appreciation of the way of life we are striving to preserve." ...|$|E
500|$|Concurrent {{with these}} changes, Portal 2 became {{available}} for pre-loading on the Steam client. At this point, several journalists and players suspected that Portal 2 {{may have been}} unlocked early {{at the end of}} the countdown timer. This correlated with a separate puzzle embedded in messages sent by Newell to a number of gaming sites; the message suggested the [...] "early release" [...] of material and [...] "thirteen offsite chambers", seemingly referring to the independent games, as well as a message [...] "4/19/2011 7 AM == 4/15/2011 9 AM", again referencing the planned Portal 2 release date and the countdown timer. As April 15 drew near, about nine heavily involved players from the ARG appeared to disengage from the various chat rooms, leaving with the message [...] "There's a hole in the sky through <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> fly"a line used in early advertisements for Portal; when contacted by other players, these individuals remained coy and cryptic about their actions, appearing to have been [...] "infected" [...] by GLaDOS. It was later revealed that these players, contacted by Valve a few days prior, were invited to Valve's headquarters to be the first to play Portal 2.|$|E
500|$|... "Beauty Mark" [...] is an ode to Wainwright's mother, {{the title}} {{referring}} to the mole above her lip. The song {{is one of the}} few up-tempo tracks on the album and contains multiple keyboard overdubs by Brion. Chris Yurkiw of the Montreal Mirror considered the track to be the most moving love song on the album, with an [...] "overt and open-hearted" [...] reference to his homosexuality: [...] "I may not be so manly, but still I know you love me." [...] Wainwright's Summer Stage performance of [...] "Beauty Mark" [...] appears on his 2005 DVD All I Want. In [...] "Barcelona", Wainwright recalls a love affair that took place in the city of the same name. The song is loosely about AIDS and contains the Italian language lyric [...] "Fuggi, regal fantasima", taken from Giuseppe Verdi's opera Macbeth. According to Wainwright, the line appears in a scene when [...] "Macbeth is going mad and sees the ghost, and in [...] mind the ghost was AIDS." [...] "Matinee Idol" [...] is about the rise and fall of an entertainment figure, inspired by the death of actor River Phoenix. According to Greenwald, the musical song has a [...] "1920s, cabaret musical feel". [...] "Damned Ladies" [...] is a slow ballad about the [...] "beloved yet doomed ladies of opera". Wainwright said the following of [...] "Damned Ladies", which contains references to nine opera heroines: [...] "In the song, I lament how these women are constantly dying brutal deaths, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> see coming but cannot stop. It gets me every time." [...] Greenwald described [...] "Sally Ann" [...] as a 1920s love ballad of [...] "lost love and emotional regret". The melody in [...] "Imaginary Love", the album's closing track, contains sixth and major seventh chords.|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reception}} to [...] "Sunshine Days" [...] was mixed. Aaron Kinney from Salon {{magazine was}} critical of the producers' idea to air the entry as the penultimate episode {{leading up to the}} heavily-promoted series finale. Kinney pointed out that the episode {{had little to do with}} the show's overarching storyline, but it was nevertheless touted as part of The X-Files [...] "Endgame" [...] promotion strategy. Jessica Morgan from Television Without Pity gave the episode a mixed review and awarded it a [...] "C" [...] grade. She sarcastically wrote, [...] "nine years of mytharc to start to wrap up. And so the penultimate episode of The X-Files, naturally, is devoted to The Brady Bunch." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode three-and-a-half stars out of five. The two noted that the episode [...] "is not one of Gilligan's very best stories", citing issues with its tone and its characterization of Oliver Martin. The two, however, did praise Gilligan's humanized style, writing, [...] "he gives Scully the proof of the paranormal she's been needing" [...] but shows that the most important [...] "things to care about in life" [...] are [...] "humans". John Keegan from Critical Myth gave the episode a moderately positive review and awarded it a 7 out of 10. He wrote, [...] "Overall, this was a pleasant yet bittersweet episode, one that leaves the characters in relative peace. It is the first time that we get a glimpse of what the writers are thinking as the series comes to a close. Now all that's left is the mythology, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> only hope will end on a similarly pleasant note." [...] M.A. Crang, in his book Denying the Truth: Revisiting The X-Files after 9/11, said that [...] "the central story falls a bit flat", but the episode worked well as a [...] "paean to medium of television itself" [...] and he felt it was an appropriate vehicle for the series' penultimate installment.|$|E
500|$|Reviews of {{the episode}} were mostly mixed, calling the storyline a [...] "much less extreme reversal" [...] of the season two episode [...] "The Story on Page One", in which Peter {{attempts}} to seduce actor Luke Perry. Kevin McFarland of The A.V. Club wrote {{of the episode}}, [...] "It was disappointing to see Family Guy bury a guest star like Kaitlin Olson in the background for much of her episode as Quagmire's sister last week, but it was even worse {{to see the show}} waste Ryan Reynolds." [...] He continued, [...] "He may not fit an empirical definition of a movie star, but I think he’s worth more as a guest than a tired trope like playing himself as a sexual predator towards Peter." [...] McFarland also criticized the episode's two storylines, noting, [...] "Both plots paint themselves into a corner with no time to get out. In the third act, Stewie is trapped at Consuela's house and Peter hadn't succumbed to Reynolds' repetitive and slowly escalating advances or done anything about them, so the show snaps its fingers and ends each one prematurely." [...] He graded the episode as a C-. In a much more positive review, Terron R. Moore of Ology criticized the episode for not featuring Griffin family siblings Chris and Meg, but praised the series for adopting a Stewie-centric storyline. Moore noted of the storyline involving Reynolds, [...] "All pretty funny stuff, but Ryan Reynolds' entire guest slot is {{based on the fact that}} you like Ryan Reynolds and his occasionally homoerotic humor, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> definitely appreciate." [...] He concluded his review by writing, [...] "Not the best Family Guy, but a definite improvement on the week before, using some of the elements it knows best." [...] Andy Neuenschwander of Yidio also gave mixed reaction to the episode, writing, [...] "Something happens whenever a celebrity shows up on [...] "Family Guy" [...] and plays themselves. I can't quite put my finger on it, but everything just feels a bit off. This episode, which featured Ryan Reynolds as Ryan Reynolds, only confirmed that feeling." [...] He also compared it to The Simpsons, noting, [...] "Maybe it's the way the celebrity is treated as a character: in shows like The Simpsons, celebrities who play themselves appear as a relatively normal version of themselves [...] But on Family Guy, celebrities tend to appear as some bizarro version of themselves." ...|$|E
