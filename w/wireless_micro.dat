40|$|Abstract: With {{the recent}} {{advances}} in Micro Electro Mechanical System (MEMS) technology, low cost and low power consumption <b>wireless</b> <b>micro</b> sensor nodes have become available. However, energy-efficient routing {{is one of the}} most important key technologies in wireless sensor networks as sensor nodes are highly energy-constrained. Therefore, many researchers have proposed routing protocols for sensor networks, especially cluster-based routing protocols, which have many advantages such as reduced control messages, bandwidth re-usability, and improved power control. Some protocols use information on the locations of sensor nodes to construct clusters efficiently. However, it is rare that all sensor nodes know their positions. In this article, we propose another cluster-based routing protocol for sensor networks. This protocol does not use information concerning the locations of sensor nodes, but uses the remaining energy of sensor networks and the desirable number of cluster heads according to the circumstances of the sensor networks. From performance simulation, we found that the proposed protocol shows better performance than the low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (LEACH) ...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{development}} in Micro Electro Mechanical System (MEMS) technology {{leads to the}} development of low cost and low power utilizing <b>wireless</b> <b>micro</b> sensor nodes. Wireless sensor network is a power consuming scheme, because nodes executes on restricted power batteries which reduces its lifetime. Extending the network lifetime is based on the better managing of sensing node energy resource. Energy efficient routing protocol is very essential technique in wireless sensor networks because sensor nodes are extremely energy based. As a result, several researchers have provided different routing protocol for sensor networks, particularly routing protocols depending on clusters protocols. This is because the usage of cluster based routing has several merits like minimized control messages, re-usability of bandwidth and enhanced power control. Different cluster based routing protocol is proposed by many researchers for the purpose of reducing the consumption energy in wireless sensor networks. Those technique reduces the energy consumption but with several disadvantages like lack of QoS, inefficient transmission, etc., To overcome those problems, modified QoS enhanced base station controlled dynamic clustering protocol for wireless sensor networks is proposed in this paper. Simulation results show the better energy consumption is achieved by the proposed protocol when compared to the conventional techniques. Index term...|$|E

EAD represents an efficient energy-aware distributed protocol to build a rooted broadcast tree with many leaves, and facilitate the data-centric routing in <b>wireless</b> <b>micro</b> sensor networks. The idea is {{to turn off the}} radios of all leaf nodes and let the non-leaf nodes be in charge of data aggregation and relaying tasks. The main contribution of this protocol is the introduction of a novel approach based on alow cost backbone provisioning within a wireless sensor network in order to turn off the non backbone nodes and save energy without compromising the connectivity of the network, and thereby extending the network lifetime. EAD makes no assumption on the network topology, and it is based on a residual power. We present an extensive simulation experiments to evaluate the performance of our EAD forwarding-to-parent routing scheme over a tree created by a single EAD execution, and compare it with the routing scheme over a regular Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) Protocol.

40|$|This is {{the final}} report of the NUMO-LBNL {{collaborative}} project: Feature Detection, Characterization and Confirmation Methodology under NUMO-DOE/LBNL collaboration agreement, the task description {{of which can be}} found in the Appendix. We examine site characterization projects from several sites in the world. The list includes Yucca Mountain in the USA, Tono and Horonobe in Japan, AECL in Canada, sites in Sweden, and Olkiluoto in Finland. We identify important geologic features and parameters common to most (or all) sites to provide useful information for future repository siting activity. At first glance, one could question whether there was any commonality among the sites, which are in different rock types at different locations. For example, the planned Yucca Mountain site is a dry repository in unsaturated tuff, whereas the Swedish sites are situated in saturated granite. However, the study concludes that indeed there are a number of important common features and parameters among all the sites [...] namely, (1) fault properties, (2) fracture-matrix interaction (3) groundwater flux, (4) boundary conditions, and (5) the permeability and porosity of the materials. We list the lessons learned from the Yucca Mountain Project and other site characterization programs. Most programs have by and large been quite successful. Nonetheless, there are definitely 'should-haves' and 'could-haves', or lessons to be learned, in all these programs. Although each site characterization program has some unique aspects, we believe that these crosscutting lessons can be very useful for future site investigations to be conducted in Japan. One of the most common lessons learned is that a repository program should allow for flexibility, in both schedule and approach. We examine field investigation technologies used to collect site characterization data in the field. An extensive list of existing field technologies is presented, with some discussion on usage and limitations. Many of the technologies on the list were in fact used during the characterization of Yucca Mountain and elsewhere by LBNL personnel. The study also includes emerging technologies and identifies the need to develop better estimation of important parameters for repository siting. Notable emerging technologies include 3 -D seismic and satellite-based remote sensing and <b>wireless</b> <b>micro</b> electro mechanical systems (MEMS) sensors. They enable cost-effective and ubiquitous monitoring to be applied for site characterization. We list and classify the types of uncertainties involved in site characterization. Uncertainties can exist in all aspects of site characterization: data, interpretation, conceptualization, and modeling. We use the Swedish program to exemplify such uncertainties. We also devote a chapter on geochemical issues regarding the interaction between groundwater and natural and engineered barrier materials. A recommendation has been made to take advantage of the recent advancement in geochemical modeling capabilities in natural systems. Although it is not of immediate relevance at the preliminary investigation stage, it serves as a good reminder that geochemical investigation efforts should not be overlooked at any stage in the repository program. We construct a synthetic preliminary-investigation site based on an extensive data set available from a geoscientific project in Japan, which we use as a 'real' site to evaluate uncertainties resulting from hydrogeological modeling and examine strategies for characterizing a new site. We plan various preliminary-investigation configurations and conduct preliminary numerical investigations at the synthetic site. We construct a model of the 'real' site for each PI configuration, make predictions of particle travel times, and compare against the 'real' data obtained from the 'real' model. We conclude that drilling as many as nine boreholes does not necessarily improve the understanding of the site compared to drilling as few as three boreholes, unless there is an underlying structure that is larger than the spacing of the boreholes. The parameters that affect the outcome of the predictions most are: (1) effective porosity, (2) boundary conditions, and (3) fault properties, all of which are very difficult to estimate in the field and are full of uncertainties. Of the three, we recommend NUMO expend efforts to assess the latter two at preliminary investigation sites. To obtain large-scale averaged permeabilities, we recommend conducting long-time and long-interval pumping tests in boreholes. We also find that the temperature data can reduce some uncertainties regarding the boundary conditions. Finally, we summarize recommendations that NUMO might consider during preliminary site investigations...|$|E

Normally, the train runs autonomously form terminals to terminals. Its speed and movement can be controlled wirelessly. Practically, people movers typically consist of driverless trains with up to about four cars each capable of carrying 20 to 100 passengers who are mostly standing.

This kind of networks is composed of many sensors which are deployed heavily {{in an area of}} interest. They collect and disseminate the required data for many applications. Hence, the research on wireless sensor networks is actually an interesting and attractive area, as several problems must be overcome. Determining the physical localization of a sensor is a fundamental function and a challenging issue that was addressed by many applications. Thus, numerous systems and algorithms of localization were proposed in the literature. In this paper, we study the basic technologies used for the localization of sensor nodes. Then, we examine some important algorithms while summarizing the parameters that we use for their classification. At the end, we conduct a comparison between all the studied algorithms, {{and we are going to}} give the directions of our future research...|$|R
