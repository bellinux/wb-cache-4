Increasingly, {{these areas are}} managed primarily for people. But, an amazing variety of animals call the same areas home and depend on us {{to make sure that}} their needs are met. <b>Working</b> <b>Trees</b> are trees and shrubs, especially native species, that are in the right place to do a specific job. Whether <b>Working</b> <b>Trees</b> {{come in the form of}} a windbreak to enhance crop or livestock production or a riparian forest buffer to filter storm water runoff, they add critical {{wildlife habitat}} to the landscape. The benefits of <b>Working</b> <b>Trees</b> extend far beyond providing food, cover, and nesting sites – all essential wildlife habitat components. <b>Working</b> <b>Trees</b> add diversity and help reconnect the landscape by creating travel corridors for wildlife.

40|$|Water is a {{precious}} national resource. Often, human activities degrade {{the quality of}} the water in the streams, lakes, estuaries, wetlands, and aquifiers on which we depend. Pollutants from agricultural and urban sources have made many of our waters unsuitable for swimming and fishing. Excessive sedimentation, pesticides, and fertilizers are harming fish and other aquatic life. Changes in land use also have had a dramatic effect on floodwater damage and frequency. Both surface and subsurfaceAgroforestry drinking water supplies are being impacted by human activities. Water quality is the end result of the individual actions of all the “neighbors” in a watershed. Rural landowners and community residents need to look beyond their own boundaries to improve water quality and coordinate water resource management. <b>Working</b> <b>Trees</b> can help alleviate water quality and quantity problems. From upland areas down to the water’s edge, <b>Working</b> <b>Trees</b> reduce and slow runoff and trap pollutants in both rural and urban settings. <b>Working</b> <b>Trees</b> means putting the right trees in the right places, and in the correct design, to do specific jobs.

Also, we propose two drilling methods that are able to realize the proposed framework. In the experiments, conventional drilling methods that have been used for rocks did not divide logs. On the other hand, the proposed methods realized the divisions without any crack in the product side of them. The proposed methods were effective against standing trees too.|$|E

40|$|Despite {{being an}} {{abundant}} group of significant ecological importance the phylogenetic relationships of the Octocorallia remain poorly understood {{and very much}} understudied. We used 1132 bp of two mitochondrial protein-coding genes, nad 2 and mtMutS (previously referred to as msh 1), to construct a phylogeny for 161 octocoral specimens from the Atlantic, including both Isididae and non- Isididae species. We found that four clades were supported using a concatenated alignment. Two of these (A and B) were in general agreement with the of Holaxonia–Alcyoniina and Anthomastus–Corallium clades identified by previous work. The third and fourth clades represent a split of the Calcaxonia–Pennatulacea clade resulting in a clade containing the Pennatulacea and {{a small number of}} Isididae specimens and a second clade containing the remaining Calcaxonia. When individual genes were considered nad 2 largely agreed with previous work with MtMutS also producing a fourth clade corresponding to a split of Isididae species from the Calcaxonia–Pennatulacea clade. It is expected these difference are a consequence of the inclusion of Isisdae species that have undergone a gene inversion in the mtMutS gene causing their separation in the MtMutS only tree. The fourth clade in the concatenated tree is also suspected to be a result of this gene inversion, as there were very few Isidiae species included in previous <b>work</b> <b>tree</b> and thus this separation would not be clearly resolved.

40|$|Abstract: Clustering is the {{classification}} of objects into different groups, or more precisely, the partitioning of a data set into subsets. Data clustering is a common technique for statistical data analysis, which is used in many fields, including machine learning, data mining, pattern recognition and bioinformatics. Gene expressions {{are one of the}} high dimensional data values and its motivating the development of clustering algorithm was used. The Existing system consists of popular algorithms like k-means and CAST. Implementing these algorithms for a large genome-scale gene expression data set is practically critical. A novel method for clustering large gene data set is introduced. In Existing work the TCLUST algorithm used, which introduce, Correlation Coefficient Graph (CCG) is constructed to maintain gene expression data values and Tanimoto Coefficient Graph (TCG) is used to measure the similarity value for the gene expression data. In proposed the enhanced TCLUST algorithm is used, it is called as E-TCLUST. Enhanced Tanimoto clustering method is implemented which feats the co-connectedness for efficiently clustering large, sparse expression data. Dynamic error threshold estimation model implements threshold values which filters data below the given threshold value.

30|$|Background {{subtraction}} is {{an important}} step in image matching using low-power devices. In [11] Stauffer and Grimson present a background subtraction method which involves thresholding the error between an estimate of the image lacking moving objects and the current image. The background model used in this work models each pixel as a mixture of Gaussians with an on-line approximation used for updating the model. The Gaussian distributions of this mixture model are evaluated to classify pixels which most likely fall in the background process. Since in reality, multiple surfaces show in the view frustum of a pixel along with changes in lighting conditions; therefore, multiple adaptive Gaussians are required. A mixture of adaptive Gaussians is used in this approximation such that as the parameters of the Gaussians are updated, the Gaussians are estimated based on a simple heuristic to find out those which are part of the ‘ background process’. In [12], the mixture of Gaussians (MoG) concept has been used in a number of sensor network problems. A related work in this context is by Ihler et al. [12]. Their work addresses the problem of automatic self-localization of sensor nodes. The authors redefine the sensor localization problem within a graphical model framework and present the use of a recent generalization of particle filtering for approximation of sensor locations. In this technique, each message is depicted using either a sample-based density estimate (as a mixture of Gaussians) or as an analytic function. The messages along observed edges are represented by samples and the messages along unobserved edges are described as analytic functions. First, the samples are drawn from the estimated marginal and then these samples are used to approximate each outgoing message. Another paper which employs mixture of Gaussian distributions in sensor networks is by Rabbat and Nowak [13]. They address the problem of in-network data aggregation in sensor networks which comprise sensor nodes capable of sending sensed data to a base station. Normally, it is required to derive an estimate of a parameter or function from the collected data which is huge and redundant. This paper investigates the distributed algorithms for data processing prior to its transmission to a central point which results in reducing the amount of energy spent in obtaining accurate estimate. This estimation problem is defined as the incremental optimization of a cost function concerning collected data from all nodes such that each node adjusts the estimate based on its local data and transmits it to the next node. In distributed expectation-maximization (DEM) algorithm, the measurements are modeled as samples extracted from a mixture of Gaussian distributions with unknown means and covariances, the mixture weights being different at each sensor in the network. Initially, the parameters of the global density are estimated, which are passed through the network such that each sensor node detects the component of the density which best fits its local data. Cho et al. [14] present a smart video surveillance system by deploying visual sensor network. It comprises of an inference framework in which autonomous scene analysis is carried out using distributed and collaborative processing among camera nodes and an effective occupancy reasoning algorithm. For each node in the network, they define a potential function representing how the global inference is coherent with the local measurement on that node. Next, a multi-tier architecture is built and one node in each cluster is chosen as an anchorage node for global inferences. The amount of overlapping between two nodes is used as a basis when constructing a <b>work</b> <b>tree</b> for distributed processing within a cluster. The existence probabilities for each camera are predicted using the binary images from the background subtraction. A modified mixture of Gaussian (MOG) algorithm is used. In [15], Tsai and Lin deal with contextual redundancy linked with background and foreground objects in a scene. They propose a scene analysis technique that classifies macroblocks based on contextual redundancy. Only specific context of macroblock is analyzed for motion which involves salient motion through an object-based coding architecture. The context of a scene is defined as the association of a pixel in a scene with static or moving background or moving foreground with/without illumination change based on the observation on a number of recent frames. The context of a macroblock is modeled by an estimated background image. In the scene analysis method, most representative Gaussian is selected from mixture of Gaussians. In [16], Ellis presents a multi-view video surveillance system with algorithms for detecting and tracking moving objects. The scene-dependent information is depicted by creating models of the scene based on observations obtained from the camera network. In order to cater for the background changes, the probability of detecting a pixel value is modeled by a mixture of Gaussians based on color and monochrome pixel values. In [17], Paletta et al. present a video surveillance system for monitoring passenger flows at public transportation junctions based on a network of video cameras. In background modeling and motion detection module, they employ an adaptive model for background estimation applying mixture of Gaussians and appearance patterns, thereby presenting a stable and robust background model.|$|E
