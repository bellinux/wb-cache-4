Du Bois {{observed}} {{that the impact of}} [...] "ever-recurring race discrimination" [...] had made it so difficult to travel to any number of destinations, from popular resorts to major cities, that it was now [...] "a puzzling query as to what to do with vacations".

The development of affordable mass-produced automobiles liberated black Americans from having to rely on the [...] "Jim Crow cars" [...] – smoky, battered and uncomfortable railroad carriages which were the separate but decidedly unequal alternatives to more salubrious whites-only carriages.
