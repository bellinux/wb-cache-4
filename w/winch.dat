5|$|<b>Winch</b> {{launches}} {{are much}} cheaper than aerotows and permit a higher launch frequency. A <b>winch</b> {{may also be}} used at sites where an aerotow could not operate, because of {{the shape of the}} field or because of noise restrictions. The height gained from a <b>winch</b> is usually less than from an aerotow so pilots need to find a source of lift soon after releasing from the cable, otherwise the flight will be short. A break in the cable or the weak link during a <b>winch</b> launch is a possibility for which pilots are trained.|$|E
5|$|All were {{equipped}} with a <b>winch,</b> mounted at {{the middle of the}} vehicle, just under the cargo platform.|$|E
5|$|Powered winches {{were used}} on cargo ships {{to speed the}} {{handling}} of heavy loads. One <b>winch</b> was operated {{at each of the}} ship's five cargo holds. During loading operations, the winches were worked hard, requiring steady maintenance to remain operable. <b>Winch</b> brakesa safety feature provided for stopping the load from falling if the winch's main power was lostwere not often used by a skilled <b>winch</b> operator, as the load could be more quickly maneuvered using various power settings than by application of the brakes. Disused brakes sometimes seized up and stopped working. The winches on the SS E. A. Bryan were steam-powered and showed signs of wear, even though the ship was only five months old.|$|E

2500|$|Mechanised hauling {{devices are}} used on modern trawlers. Trawl <b>winches,</b> such as Gilson <b>winches,</b> [...] and other {{auxiliary}} <b>winches</b> are installed on deck {{to control the}} towing warps (trawling wires) and store them when not in use.|$|R
5|$|Gliders {{are often}} {{launched}} using a stationary ground-based <b>winch</b> {{mounted on a}} heavy vehicle. This method is widely used at many European clubs, often {{in addition to an}} aerotow service. The engine is usually powered by LPG, petrol or diesel, though hydraulic fluid engines and electrical motors are also used. The <b>winch</b> pulls in a 1,000 to 2,500-metre (3,000 to 7,500ft) cable, made of high-tensile steel wire or a synthetic fiber, attached to the glider. The cable is released at a height of about 35% of the cable length after a short, steep ride. A strong headwind will result in higher launches.|$|E
5|$|About 20 minutes later, Bariko {{launched}} a helicopter {{to check on}} the cable <b>winch</b> which was to collect samples. It also lowered boats to test radioactivity levels in the lagoon. B-17 pilotless drone aircraft were flown through the clouds, and a drone light tank was used to recover soil samples from the crater. Unfortunately, it became bogged and had to be towed out ten days later.|$|E
5|$|Additional {{exhibits}} {{include two}} small de Laval steam turbines by Greenwood & Batley, {{and a small}} 'Wessex' steam turbine milk bottle washer. A <b>winch</b> used to move railway wagons at Hemyock Dairy near Wellington was built by J. Lynn of Sunderland. There is a runnable Crossley diesel engine dating from 1935. There is a Spirax Sarco 'Ogden pump' used to pump condensate from steam lines. The collection includes the boiler which powered the Telescopic Bridge, Bridgwater.|$|E
40|$|<b>Winching</b> {{is common}} in {{small-scale}} forest operations, especially on steep slopes, where tractors cannot reach the logs inside the forest. In this case, logs are dragged to the roadside with tractor-mounted <b>winches,</b> for later collection by transportation units. <b>Winching</b> is a heavy task, posing a high physiological stress on <b>winching</b> crew members. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the relationship between experienced workload, work conditions and operator fitness. The study confirmed the assumption that fit, young operators experience a lower workload than older ones. Workload depends on <b>winching</b> direction, and it is higher when <b>winching</b> downhill than when <b>winching</b> uphill. Results confirmed that gravity is the main factor, and it has a stronger effect than task type and tool weight. Walking uphill with no tools is heavier than walking downhill and carrying a steel cable. As a consequence, tool weight reduction can only palliate the problem, without solving it. <b>Winching</b> crews should be composed of fit, young workers. When the task is assigned to older workers, it is necessary to allow longer rest breaks, accepting a lower productivity...|$|R
40|$|Production rates, {{skidding}} costs, {{and soil}} disturbance were compared for two partial-cut units-one with preplanned skid trails and <b>winching</b> and one conventional unit-harvested with a Caterpillar D- 7 F. For the unit with preplanned skid trails and <b>winching,</b> production was 11 percent less, and skidding cost per unit volume was 29 {{percent more than}} for the conventionally harvested unit. However, only 4 percent of its area was in skid trails, compared to 22 percent of the conventionally harvested unit. Total cycle time with <b>winching</b> was a function of skidding distance, skid trail slope, number of logs per turn, volume per turn, number of <b>winching</b> cycles, and the average <b>winching</b> distance...|$|R
25|$|Titanic was {{equipped}} with eight electric cranes, four electric <b>winches</b> and three steam <b>winches</b> to lift cargo and baggage {{in and out of}} the hold. It is estimated that the ship used some 415 tons of coal whilst in Southampton, simply generating steam to operate the cargo <b>winches</b> and provide heat and light.|$|R
5|$|In 1985, the Smithsonian Institution {{commissioned}} {{aeronautical engineer}} Paul MacCready {{to build a}} half-scale working model of Quetzalcoatlus northropi. The replica was launched with a ground-based <b>winch.</b> It flew several times in 1986 and was filmed {{as part of the}} Smithsonian's IMAX film On the Wing. However, the model was not anatomically correct and embodied vertical and horizontal tail stabilizers that pterosaurs did not have. It also had a longer tail, changing the weight distribution.|$|E
5|$|In July 2006 Krka {{was damaged}} during an {{overhaul}} at the Šibenik Shipyard. While being lowered to the sea, the <b>winch</b> of the syncrolift {{pulled out of}} the concrete causing the ship to fall down, creating a hole in the hull and sinking the stern. Early reports of significant damage proved to be false and the ship was repaired soon after. Out of ten crew members that were on board at the time, only one sustained minor injuries.|$|E
5|$|The drop itself became {{computerized}} {{through the}} use of an electric <b>winch</b> synced with the National Institute of Standards and Technology's time signal; the new system was not without issues, however, as a glitch caused the ball to pause for a short moment halfway through its descent. After its 44th use in 1999, the third ball was retired and placed on display at the Atlanta headquarters of Jamestown Group, owners of One Times Square.|$|E
50|$|The Princess Royal is {{equipped}} with a 6.5 tonne-metre knuckle boom crane, a 2 tonne hydraulic A-frame, two trawl <b>winches,</b> a pot hauler two ROV <b>winches</b> and a 5-metre Rigid Inflatable Boat.|$|R
5000|$|By {{eliminating}} the battens and associated batten cars, the material cost savings {{for a typical}} 60-ft catamaran can {{be as much as}} $12,000 AUD. [...] Aft-mast rigs with no mainsail also require fewer <b>winches</b> to raise and lower sails, and no <b>winches</b> to move the boom. When [...] "Hot Buoys" [...] converted from a Bermuda rig to an aft-mast rig 5 <b>winches</b> were no longer required.|$|R
50|$|A few {{transporters}} {{have been}} fitted with <b>winches</b> for loading, but this is uncommon. More usually a disabled vehicle is loaded {{with the assistance of}} a recovery tractor, either <b>winching</b> or pushing it on board.|$|R
5|$|The {{effects of}} {{electromagnetism}} are most visibly {{employed in the}} electric motor, which provides a clean and efficient means of motive power. A stationary motor such as a <b>winch</b> is easily provided with a supply of power, but a motor that moves with its application, such as an electric vehicle, is obliged to either carry along a power source such as a battery, or to collect current from a sliding contact such as a pantograph.|$|E
5|$|The vehicle starts {{again and}} they leave, but Wes panics {{and tries to}} force Sean {{to turn around and}} go back for Ritch, causing the car to go over a cliff. Calmer, he wants to wait for help, but no one knows where they are because they had told their {{families}} they were going somewhere else. They <b>winch</b> the vehicle back up to the road, but they cannot get it to start.|$|E
5|$|At 11:00, however, {{a second}} attempt to {{resupply}} B Company {{resulted in an}} Australian Iroquois helicopter being shot down by heavy ground fire, and exploding on impact. Two crew members were killed and another two injured, while another soldier was injured on the ground. With ammunition exploding among the burning wreckage a number of Australians rushed to aid the injured, scrambling through the debris and removing the unexploded ammunition and pulling the survivors to safety. Subsequently, another <b>winch</b> point was established {{to the rear of}} the Australian positions for casualty evacuation and resupply.|$|E

40|$|The text {{presented}} a short overview of <b>Winch’s</b> {{account of the}} social sciences as inseparable from philosophical, that is, conceptual investigations and Witt­genstein’s influence this argument. The author points to several critical remarks regarding <b>Winch’s</b> subjectivism and relativism caused by the insufficient elaboration and over generalizations which can be found in <b>Winch’s</b> early texts, and which were the object of his own self-criticism later on. Alongside the received view of the importance of Wittgenstein’s concepts of language-games, forms of life and rule-following, when it comes to social theory, the text emphasizes the relevance of less considered concepts of perspicuous representation and aspect-seeing regarding <b>Winch’s</b> understanding of the possibilities of understanding of different cultures...|$|R
40|$|Thanks for {{letter and}} packet. Observations on <b>Winch's</b> specimens: leaving the roses until {{he comes to}} that section of "[English] Flora", but having briefly {{examined}} them concurs with <b>Winch's</b> opinions and compliments him as "a faithful & original observer"; believes the genus ['Rosa'] {{is a perfect example}} of the saying "the more cooks, the worse broth"; has no true authority for 'Rosa villosa' being wild in Britain. Has not yet read [William Jackson] Hooker's work on roses, but thinks Hooker was "too hasty" with 'Salix' and showed he had not studied them properly, which he has told him, will avoid doing so in public. Criticises various recent publications on 'Salix' including by De Candolle and Sprengel, in which his own work on willows has been "jumbled", and Seringue, leading to nurserymen applying his names to common varities, leading him to be "plagued with enquiries". Observations on <b>Winch's</b> remaining specimens: <b>Winch's</b> 'Salix forsteriana' and 'S. andersoniana' correct; the 'Salix' of fifth and sixth editions of [William] Withering's ["Botanical arrangement"] is 'S. myrsinites'; 'Cypripedium calceolus'; 'Saxifraga hirculus'; <b>Winch's</b> 'Epilobium alpestre' his 'E. alsinifolium'; 'Thlaspi hirtum'; <b>Winch's</b> new 'Veronica' is his 'V. saxatilis'. Thanks for <b>Winch's</b> last work, has sent a copy to [Robert] Brown. Apologises for not being "a good correspondent", he has too much other writing; deeply engaged with "Flora Graeca", and following a trip to Holkham [Hall, Norfolk, home of Thomas William Coke] intends to focus on "English Flora", which he longs for "more than a schoolboy for his holidays".

5|$|The Windlass Room, or <b>Winch</b> Room, {{is in the}} Gatehouse, entered {{from the}} Drawing Room. It {{contains}} a working mechanism for operating the drawbridge and the portcullis. The equipment was originally intended for the second floor, which Burges considered the most historically authentic location. When later design modifications led him to move Lord Bute's Bedroom into that space, the equipment was simplified and placed on the first floor. The Windlass Room includes murder holes, which Burges thought would have enabled medieval inhabitants of the castle to pour boiling water and oil on attackers.|$|E
5|$|The crew {{notice that}} Geiger {{has set the}} ship to crash into an oil tanker {{off the coast of}} Saint Martin. Alex decides to stop the ship by diving {{underneath}} it and jamming the propeller with a steel cable. Geiger realizes Alex is trying to stop the ship, so he jams the cable <b>winch</b> while Alex is underwater, causing it to break off the ship and free the cable. Geiger takes Annie hostage and escapes with her on a boat from the ship's stern.|$|E
30|$|The {{circumferential}} direction effects of <b>winching</b> {{on the distribution}} of Type 1 resin pockets, was assessed using the number of resin pockets formed per <b>winched</b> tree in 4 equal sized azimuth classes, and two-way ANOVA with factors for tree and azimuth class. The models were fitted separately for the pre-treatment period (2003 – 2007), and the treatment period (2007 – 2008). The azimuth classes were orientated such that the classes were separated {{along the lines of the}} directions of <b>winching.</b>|$|R

5|$|Aboard the ship, {{passenger}} John Geiger hacks {{into the}} ship's computer system, {{and the following}} evening, he destroys the ship's communication systems and kills the captain. After remotely shutting down the ship's engines, Geiger calls the bridge to tell the first officer, Juliano, that the captain is dead and he is in charge. Juliano is ordered by Geiger to evacuate the ship. Geiger steals jewelry from the ship's vault. As passengers evacuate, Drew, a young deaf girl, becomes trapped in an elevator, {{and a group of}} people become trapped behind locked fire doors in a hallway filling with smoke. As Annie and Alex attempt to board the last lifeboat, Geiger programs the ship to continue sailing. The <b>winch</b> lowering the lifeboat jams. Alex jumps into the boat to rescue the passengers who are falling off, and Annie and Juliano use the ship's gangplank to get them back on deck.|$|E
5|$|Across the Philippines, Typhoon Betty brought {{widespread}} flooding, {{which resulted}} in severe destruction. Damage added up to $100million (1987USD). In the Maguindanao and Albay provinces alone, 10,000people were evacuated and 1,000were homeless. However, {{the capital city of}} Manila avoided any serious damage. Nationwide, around 200,000people were reportedly homeless, 18,000of <b>winch</b> were from Marinduque and another 11,400resided on Mindoro Island. In the former, 4,000dwellings sustained damage, and all of the banana crop there was lost. In all, 25,518homes received damage. Roughly 400,000people were directly affected by the storm. Overall, 85people were killed and 324others were wounded. After striking the Philippines, six people were killed by Betty in Vietnam. Approximately 10,000structures were damaged and 103people were injured. Elsewhere, in northern Thailand, one person was killed and three others were hurt by the typhoon. Several villages were flooded, and numerous streets were damaged.|$|E
5|$|Brody {{runs into}} Mike, who tells {{his father that}} Sean is with his friends, {{drifting}} towards Cable Junction, a small island housing an electrical relay station, and apologizes for disobeying him and putting Sean in danger. Brody accepts his apology while telling him to get to safety and quickly finds them, but when the shark returns, he panics and maroons the police boat on Cable Junction. He then tries to pull them in with a <b>winch</b> but hooks an underwater power cable. The shark's next attack sends most of the teenagers into the water, and they swim to Cable Junction while Sean and Jackie are trapped on the boats. Using an inflatable raft, Brody hits the power cable with an oar to attract the shark, and encourages it to bite the cable; the shark is fatally electrocuted, and its body sinks {{to the bottom of}} the sea. The kids rejoice as Brody picks up Sean and Jackie, and they join them on Cable Junction to await rescue.|$|E
