5|$|Fellows Riverside Gardens' popular {{lookout point}} offers {{visitors}} contrasting {{views of the}} area. From the south side, the canopied woodlands overlooking Lake Glacier are visible; from the north side, visitors are presented <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> downtown Youngstown. The park features two 18-hole golf courses. The North Course is on rolling terrain, while the South Course features narrow, tree-lined fairways. Other features include playgrounds, athletic fields, and picnic areas.|$|E
5|$|In 1851 the Earl of Ellesmere {{hosted a}} visit to Manchester by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. They stayed at Worsley Hall, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the canal, and were given a trip between Patricroft railway station and Worsley Hall, on state barges. Large crowds had {{gathered}} to cheer the royal party, which apparently frightened the horses drawing the barge {{so much that they}} fell into the canal.|$|E
5|$|Roman {{literature}} {{focuses on}} the dining habits of the upper classes, for whom the evening meal (cena) had important social functions. Guests were entertained in a finely decorated dining room (triclinium), often <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the peristyle garden. Diners lounged on couches, leaning on the left elbow. By the late Republic, if not earlier, women dined, reclined, and drank wine along with men.|$|E

5|$|To avoid a narrator, {{the serial}} delegates the novel's first ironic {{sentence}} to Elizabeth {{in an early}} scene. The adaptation opens <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> Darcy's and Bingley's horses as they race across a field toward the Netherfield estate, expressing vitality; Elizabeth watches them before breaking into a run. While the novel indicates Elizabeth's independence and energy in her three-mile trek to Netherfield, the adaptation of this scene also shows her rebelliousness and love of nature.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} video surfaced {{online in}} late May 2010, explaining why Beyoncé's character was remembering her love {{interest in the}} original version. It begins <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the night sky and many trees, as Beyoncé drives a car and Ealy's character is chased by the police through a forest. As the video progresses, she parks her car {{on the side of}} the road and scenes from the original version are shown. Police dogs eventually catch Ealy's character and attack him savagely. An open bag reveals stolen money, which is dispersed by the wind. At the end of the video, in the forest, Beyoncé finds Ealy lying lifelessly on the ground.|$|E
5|$|In Mission: Earth, Voyage to the Home Planet, {{astronaut}} Thomas David Jones recounts {{his experiences}} studying the Earth {{during his first}} mission with the United States space agency NASA. Jones' space mission lasted eleven days. Jones {{was a member of}} the crew of the Space Shuttle Endeavour, which left Earth in April 1994. The mission was intended to provide the Space Radar Lab <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the planet. By using three separate radar echoes, scientists were able to analyze a full image of the planet. The radar technology could penetrate obstructions, including clouds and thick outgrowth of trees. Another purpose of the mission was to analyze the ecological state of the planet and to take measurements of pollution caused by carbon monoxide.|$|E

5|$|In October 2010, the old visitor centre {{closed and}} work on a new visitor centre started. The new Jodrell Bank Discovery Centre opened on Monday 11 April 2011. It {{includes}} a new entrance building, the Planet Pavilion, a new Space Pavilion for exhibitions and events, and a glass-walled cafe <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the Lovell Telescope and an outdoor dining area, an education space, and landscaping of the gardens including a new Galaxy Maze. A large orrery was installed in 2013.|$|E
5|$|It has two {{landscaped}} picnic areas. Facilities {{include a}} tea shop, with {{indoor and outdoor}} seating areas <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the lake, and information centre. There are a souvenir shop and small art gallery and two nature trails. The Grebe Trail is a hard-surfaced, all-weather path suitable for pedestrians, pushchairs and wheelchairs and covers a circuit 0.75miles (1.2km) long, starting and finishing at the wooded picnic area. The Bittern Trail is reached from the Grebe Trail by the footbridge over Hollow Brook. The grassy path is often waterlogged in winter, {{but there is a}} boardwalk over a short section. The trail runs along the east shore, visits an open bird hide and returns to the footbridge, making a 1-mile (1.5-kilometre) circuit. Bristol Water imposes conditions on visitors, particularly related to the areas where dogs are allowed.|$|E
5|$|Romanos Lekapenos {{had risen}} to power in 919, when {{he had managed to}} appoint himself regent over the young Constantine VII and marry his {{daughter}} Helena to him. Within a year, he successively rose from basileopator to Caesar, and was eventually crowned senior emperor on 17 December 920. To consolidate his hold on power, and <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> supplanting the ruling Macedonian dynasty with his own family, he raised his eldest son Christopher to co-emperor in May 921, while Stephen and Constantine were proclaimed co-emperors on 25 December 924.|$|E

5|$|The {{building}} {{was intended as}} a home for Jack Malloch and his son, John Rolph Malloch. Both men were partners in a father/son architectural firm based in San Francisco, and both wanted to live on Telegraph Hill <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the San Francisco Bay. They determined to build an apartment which would provide them with fine dwellings and also with income from the rental units it held. Irvin Goldstine (sometimes written Irving or Irvine) designed the building for them; he had recently graduated from l'École des Beaux-Arts but had not yet earned his architect's license, so he was not listed as the architect of record. Instead, the Mallochs were listed. Goldstine obtained his license in 1940, four years after he first sketched the Malloch Building.|$|E
5|$|The {{left-hand}} wing {{depicts the}} Crucifixion. It shows Christ's followers grieving in the foreground, soldiers and spectators milling {{about in the}} mid-ground and a portrayal of three crucified bodies in the upper-ground. The scene is framed against an azure sky <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> Jerusalem in the distance. The right-hand wing portrays scenes associated with the Last Judgement: a hellscape at its base, the resurrected awaiting judgement in the centre-ground, and a representation of Christ in Majesty flanked by a Great Deësis of saints, apostles, clergy, virgins and nobility in the upper section. Portions of the work contain Greek, Latin and Hebrew inscriptions. The original gilt frames contain Biblical passages in Latin drawn from the books of Isaiah, Deuteronomy and Revelation. According to a date written in Russian on their reverse, the panels were transferred to canvas supports in 1867.|$|E
5|$|The {{panorama}} on the Library punchbowl begins <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> {{the eastern}} shore of Sydney Cove. In the foreground is an octagonal two-storey, yellow, sandstone house ①, built by Governor Macquarie in 1812 for his favourite boatman and former water bailiff, Billy or William Blue. The drawing of this little house – now the site of the Sydney Opera House — is out of all proportion to its actual modest size. To the left of the house is a sandy beach where the Circular Quay ferry wharves now stand. Facing the beach is First Government House ② where the Museum of Sydney is now situated.|$|E

5|$|The west {{facade of}} the house is the most ornate, and faces the Hudson River, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the river from its terrace and west-facing windows. The curtain wall between the facade's pavilions {{contains}} a semicircular portico, and its entablature is upheld by Ionic columns, and supports a balustrade. A flight of semicircular steps descends to the terrace. The river front is parallel with the east front, which had a porte-cochère, a minor entrance, and a service entrance. The main entrance is at the building's south, directly approached by the south drive. The entrance is recessed, with a portico of Ionic columns over the entranceway.|$|E
5|$|When {{the first}} traffic flowed, crews had not {{finished}} some final tasks, such as painting stripes. Motorists saw a relocation with several mountain cuts built high up the canyon wall, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the slide and former lake. The roadbed {{was not expected}} to last, as weather conditions had been unfavorable when the asphalt was laid. Two mountain cuts were unstable, requiring several months of work before they could be left unattended. During this time, the state stationed two full-time watches at the cuts, who would close the road while falling rocks were cleared. The cut through Billies Mountain was described by the construction crews as a new, man-made mountain pass.|$|E
5|$|In {{an effort}} to move city and county {{government}} functions {{out of the state}} capitol, the city purchased a plot of land to build on in 1832. They chose a spot on the edge of De Witt's public square, along Eagle Street at the eastern terminus of Lion Street (later renamed Washington Avenue); the land was bought from St. Peter's Church for $10,295.95 ($ in modern dollars). The design of the new city hall was done by Albany architect Philip Hooker. The cornerstone was laid by Mayor John Townsend amid a Masonic ceremony, however the date of this event is in dispute. The building was completed in 1832 {{at a cost of about}} $92,000 ($ in modern dollars). The new city hall was a Greek Revival structure, built of white marble with an entrance porch supported by four Doric columns. On the roof was a gilded dome. The interior was simple, with little ornamentation, though a full-length statue of Alexander Hamilton stood in the center of the upper hall, between the Court room and the Common Council Chamber. Upon one side of this hall was a bas-relief of DeWitt Clinton, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> a primitive canal-boat in the distance, and on the opposite wall was a similar figure of Sir Walter Scott. The building was destroyed by fire on February 10, 1880. Plans for a replacement city hall quickly developed.|$|E

5|$|The {{music video}} opens <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> Rihanna lying in open waters, as other scenes of {{diamonds}} being rolled {{in a manner}} suggestive of making a joint are intercut– a scene reminiscent of the single's artwork. As the video progresses Rihanna is shown running on a highway. In a black-and-white scene, Rihanna licks the joint and begins smoking it. The image fades to black as the song begins. Rihanna performs in the same black-and-white setting while in a black corset. Images of Rihanna on a bed in a room while singing are shown, with objects breaking, curtains falling and roses burning in reverse effect. Rihanna is shown again on the highway, running away from {{what appears to be}} the headlights of a chasing car. She then stops as she looks up to the night sky at an aurora view. Throughout the video, Rihanna's hand is shown intertwined with that of a heavily tattooed man, whose face is not shown in the video. As the second verse starts, Rihanna is shown in a desert where horses run freely. Scenes of a street battle are later shown, depicting burning cars and broken glass around the environment. As the video continues, the singer and her lover's hands are shown slowly slipping apart, with only their fingertips touching towards the conclusion of the video. The video ends with Rihanna once again floating alone in the open waters.|$|E
5|$|The {{opening scene}} is a three-minute computer-generated sequence, {{beginning}} <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> Earth from {{high in the}} exosphere and listening in on numerous radio waves of modern programming emitting from the planet. The camera then starts zooming backward, passing the Moon, Mars, and other features of the solar system, then to the Oort cloud, interstellar space, the Local Bubble, the Milky Way, other galaxies of the Local Group, and eventually into deep space. As this occurs, the radio signals start to drop out and reflect older programming, representing the distance these signals would have traveled {{at the speed of}} light, eventually becoming silent as the distance becomes much greater. The sequence eventually resolves into the iris of young Ellie's eye as she is listening on her amateur radio set. This scale view shot of the entire universe was inspired by the short documentary film Powers of Ten (1977). At the time, it was the longest continuous computer-generated effect for a live-action film, eventually surpassed by the opening sequence from The Day After Tomorrow (2004).|$|E
5|$|Former British {{soldier and}} writer Ken Wharton {{published}} {{in his book}} Wasted Years, Wasted Lives, Volume 1, an alternative theory that was suggested to him by loyalist paramilitarism researcher Jeanne Griffin; this was that the ambush was planned by Robin Jackson as an elaborate means of eliminating trumpet player Brian McCoy. Griffin suggests that McCoy, who originally came from Caledon, County Tyrone and had strong UDR and Orange Order family connections, was possibly approached at some stage by Jackson <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> securing his help in carrying out UVF attacks in the Irish Republic. When McCoy refused, Jackson then hatched his plan to murder McCoy and his bandmates in retaliation, even macabrely choosing Buskhill as the ambush site due to its similarity to Bus-kill. Griffin goes on to add that the bogus checkpoint was set up not only to plant the bomb on board the van but to ensure the presence of McCoy {{which would have been}} confirmed when he handed over his driver's license to the gunmen. She also thinks that had everything gone to plan once the bomb was planted in the van McCoy would have been instructed to drive through Newry where the bomb would have gone off and the UVF could then afterwards portray the Miami Showband as IRA members on a mission to blow up the local RUC barracks. Griffin based her theory on the nine bullets that were fired from a Luger into McCoy's body and that Jackson's fingerprints were found on the silencer used for a Luger. She furthermore opined that Jackson was the man Travers saw kicking McCoy's body {{to make sure he was}} dead.|$|E
