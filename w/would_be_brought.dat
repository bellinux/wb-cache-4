5|$|Due to {{the strong}} celebrity {{influence}} expected at the Indian Super League final {{it was reported that}} over 250 police officers would be in attendance at the stadium to maintain order of the crowd. It was also reported that over 150 personnel <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> in to man the streets outside the stadium.|$|E
5|$|The {{mood was}} now so {{volatile}} that Charles feared a full-scale London {{rebellion against the}} monarchy. Food production and distribution had been disrupted {{to the point of}} non-existence; Charles announced that supplies of bread <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> into the City every day, and safe markets set up round the perimeter. These markets were for buying and selling; there was no question of distributing emergency aid.|$|E
5|$|During Easter in 1563, some {{priests in}} Ayrshire celebrated Mass, thus defying the law. Some Protestants tried {{to enforce the}} law {{themselves}} by apprehending these priests. This prompted Mary to summon Knox for the third time. She asked Knox to use his influence to promote religious toleration. He defended their actions and noted she was bound to uphold the laws and if she did not, others would. Mary surprised Knox by agreeing that the priests <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> to justice.|$|E

5|$|In December 1915 Braithwaite was {{promoted}} temporary brigadier general (his temporary rank of lieutenant colonel was made substantive {{at the same}} time) and took command of the newly formed New Zealand (Rifle) Brigade. The brigade consisted of only two battalions at this stage but <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> up to strength {{with the arrival of}} its 3rd and 4th Battalions in March 1916. During this time Braithwaite oversaw the training of his new command. However, within a few months, he was appointed commander of the 2nd Infantry Brigade, one of the three brigades of the newly formed New Zealand Division.|$|E
5|$|Some solid {{performances}} in the early 1930s led to rumours that he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> into the Australian team in order to retaliate against England's Bodyline tactics during the 193233 Ashes series. However, this never eventuated and thereafter Halcombe increasingly found state selection hard to come by. In retirement he became a well known sports commentator for the Australian Broadcasting Commission, providing description of cricket and Australian rules football matches until his retirement from the media in 1968.|$|E
5|$|The cup final defeat {{prompted}} manager Arsène Wenger {{to admit}} new players <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> {{in during the}} transfer window. To fill the seemingly void left by Emmanuel Petit in the centre of midfield, Giovanni van Bronckhorst was signed from Rangers for £8.5 million. Teenager Francis Jeffers was purchased from Everton in an initial £8 million deal. Junichi Inamoto and Richard Wright were also recruited, with Nelson Vivas and Sylvinho departing the club. After a protracted transfer saga, which involved him questioning Arsenal's ambitions and being linked to a move with Manchester United, midfielder Patrick Vieira remained at the club.|$|E

50|$|In 2007 at Gen Con Indy, {{concurrent}} {{with the}} announcement that the 4th edition of Dungeons & Dragons <b>would</b> <b>be</b> published the following year, RPGA announced that the Living Greyhawk campaign <b>would</b> not <b>be</b> converted to 4th edition, but <b>would</b> instead <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> to a close.|$|R
5|$|The {{next major}} change to SH-34 <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> {{about by the}} {{establishment}} of the southern part of State Highway 6. The new highway was introduced on July 7, 1975. SH-34 remained in place; the two highways were concurrent from northwest of Eldorado to the Red River bridge, where they both ended. On January 5, 1987, the redundant section of SH-34 was removed, truncating it to its current southern terminus.|$|E
5|$|DuBois rose to {{national}} prominence {{as the leader}} of the Niagara Movement, a group of African-American activists who wanted equal rights for blacks. DuBois and his supporters opposed the Atlanta compromise, an agreement crafted by BookerT. Washington which provided that Southern blacks would work and submit to white political rule, while Southern whites guaranteed that blacks would receive basic educational and economic opportunities. Instead, DuBois insisted on full civil rights and increased political representation, which he believed <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> about by the African-American intellectual elite. He referred to this group as the Talented Tenth and believed that African Americans needed the chances for advanced education to develop its leadership.|$|E
5|$|During {{the whole}} {{existence}} of the Byzantine Empire, the garrison {{of the city was}} quite small: the imperial guards and the small city watch (the pedatoura or kerketon) under the urban prefect were the only permanent armed force available. Any threat to the city would {{have to be dealt with}} by the field armies in the provinces, before it could approach the city itself. In times of need, such as the earthquake of 447 or the raids by the Avars in the early 7th century, the general population, organized in the guilds and the hippodrome factions, would be conscripted and armed, or additional troops <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> in from the provincial armies.|$|E
50|$|Sinister/Marzocchi: 1999-July 2000 After leaving Redline {{he devoted}} full {{attention}} to his company Sinister, which <b>would</b> later <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> by Marzocchi. Greg Hill would stay on for a time as Product Development and Brand Manager.|$|R
50|$|The fleet {{would stay}} at sea {{for weeks at}} a time. The catch <b>would</b> {{sometimes}} <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> home by special ships (called ventjagers) while the fleet <b>would</b> still <b>be</b> at sea (the picture at the top shows a ventjager in the distance).|$|R
50|$|On 11 June 2009, it {{was stated}} that Little Miss Jocelyn <b>would</b> not <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> {{back for a}} third series. In November 2009, Esien played the part of {{waitress}} Cindie Smith in the ITV series Collision.|$|R
5|$|Ernst's rule, {{and that}} of his four Wittelsbach successors, {{strengthened}} the position of his family in Imperial politics. The victory of the Catholic party further consolidated the Counter-Reformation in the northwest territories of the Holy Roman Empire, especially in the bishoprics of Münster, Paderborn, Osnabrück and Minden, which were bordered by Protestant territories. Once Ernst's brother or such allies as the Duke of Parma regained control, Jesuits efficiently identified any recalcitrant Protestants and converted them to Catholicism. The Counter-Reformation was thoroughly applied in the lower Rhineland, with the goal that every Protestant, whether Lutheran or Calvinist, <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> to the Catholic fold. For their efforts, the Spanish acquired important bridgeheads on the Rhine River, securing a land route to the rebellious northern provinces, which helped to extend an already long war of secession well into the next century.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, {{during its}} time under the {{ownership}} of Britain-based Grand Metropolitan, Burger King experimented with table service. After 4pm, customers would place their order at the counter, and their order <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> to them at their table. Customers were given complimentary popcorn to eat while waiting for their meal. To coincide with the offering, a series of meals called the Dinner baskets were introduced. The dinner baskets included the Whopper Dinner Basket, Steak Sandwich Dinner Basket, Fried Chicken Dinner Basket, and Shrimp Dinner Basket. In the New England region of the United States, BK sold a Fried clam Basket. The dinner came with two sides, including a choice of a side salad, cole slaw, French fries, or baked potato. Lasting approximately a year, the sit-down restaurant concept was abandoned in 1994 {{in favor of the}} original quick-service formula.|$|E
5|$|Next came {{a career}} as chief purser on cargo and {{passenger}} ships travelling to South America, Europe, and Asia. In the 1930s, German and British passengers expressed fears about the Nazis, and military officers told him that Germany was equipping for war. Buckles witnessed antisemitism and its effects firsthand while ashore in Germany, and he warned acquaintances in Germany that their country <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> down by Adolf Hitler, whom he encountered at a German hotel. Employed at sea during the Great Depression, he forwarded an $800 Army bonus to his father who was struggling as a farmer in the Oklahoma Dust Bowl (Buckles provided these details many decades later).|$|E
60|$|An hour later, Zaki {{started with}} Gregory's report. The inhabitants, finding that they <b>would</b> <b>be</b> paid, <b>brought</b> out their hidden stores; and by evening, enough was {{collected}} to last the garrison ten days.|$|R

5|$|Ralph and Vanellope build a kart, {{and they}} flee to Diet Cola Mountain, an {{unfinished}} race track. Learning that Vanellope cannot drive, Ralph helps teach her. King Candy hacks the game's code, obtaining Ralph's medal, which he offers {{to him in}} exchange for preventing Vanellope from racing. He explains that if Vanellope wins and becomes playable, her glitches <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> {{to the attention of}} players, their game would be unplugged and Vanellope would die, unable to leave the game because she is a glitch. A reluctant Ralph agrees, trashing Vanellope's kart. He returns to his own game, but notices Vanellope's image {{on the side of the}} Sugar Rush cabinet, and realizes she was meant to be a playable character.|$|E
5|$|Stock ducks {{would be}} chosen from ducklings hatched in March, with a typical breeder keeping six males and twenty laying females {{at any given}} time. The females would be kept for around a year before mating, {{typically}} to an older male. They would then generally be replaced, to reduce the problems of inbreeding. Stock ducks were allowed to roam freely during the day, and would swim in local ponds which, although privately owned, were treated as common property among the duck breeders; breeders would label their ducks with markings on the neck or head. The stock ducks would forage for greenery and insects, supplemented by greaves (the residue left after the rendering of animal fat). As ducks lay their eggs at night, the ducks <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> indoors overnight.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet {{news media}} and {{government}} officials soon began to discuss the apparent substandard construction styles that had caused so many of Armenia's buildings to collapse. Gorbachev, in a TV interview several weeks after his expedited return from New York City, said that the concrete blocks had been built with more than enough sand but too little concrete, and suggested that the concrete had been stolen. , deputy chairman of the state building committee, stated that many newer homes collapsed as well {{and that he was}} beginning an investigation into the matter and that criminal charges <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>brought.</b> The official communist party newspaper Pravda said that poor construction, like other issues of neglect in the Soviet system, could be blamed on the Era of Stagnation from the era of Leonid Brezhnev.|$|E
25|$|This {{controversial}} item would unfortunately, {{turn out}} to be another area they had handicapped themselves without the important information that <b>would</b> later <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> to light during the testimony which <b>would</b> <b>be</b> given at the Coroner's Inquest; the only investigation that took evidence other than engineering and geology into account.|$|R
50|$|The REC was re-formed on 24 September 1938 with a remit {{to run the}} British {{railways}} if {{war broke}} out. The railways <b>would</b> later <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> under government control through the REC {{under the direction of}} the Ministry of Transport.|$|R
50|$|In July 2002 HMRC {{issued a}} Technical Exchange (Issue 63) advising tax offices {{that they were}} aware of several hundred people {{intending}} to use such a scheme. However legislation to target these schemes <b>would</b> not <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> in until 2008.|$|R
5|$|The {{project has}} been criticised for its delayed {{completion}} date; in 2009 the Department for Transport confirmed that Network Rail was developing High Level Output Specification options for the station, with an estimated date for the re-opening of the platforms of 2014, seven years after their closure. The cost of maintaining the disused platforms up to late 2010 was found via a Freedom of Information request to have been £4.1million. South West Trains subsequently confirmed that platform 20 <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> back into use in 2014, hosting certain services to and from Reading, Windsor, Staines and Hounslow. These would be 10-car trains newly formed from refurbished SWT and former Gatwick Express rolling stock. Platform 20 reopened in May, with access via platform 19, and platforms 21 and 22 in October after steps were constructed over the former Eurostar entrance to access the platforms.|$|E
5|$|Higher {{education}} {{first arrived}} at Pichilemu in 1970, when the Centro Medio Profesional de Pichilemu (Pichilemu Secondary-Professional Centre) was created; however, it was discontinued the next year. In 2002, thirty-one {{years after the}} Centro Medio Profesional was discontinued, the Universidad Academia de Humanismo Cristiano (Academy of Christian Humanism University) began to give classes of Engineering in Public Gesture Management, and Engineering in Environment Gesture Management. The university worked at the dependencies of Liceo Agustín Ross Edwards until 2008. At least ten people obtained their professional titles, while other ten {{are still in the}} process of obtaining their titles, as of December 2011. In November 2011, Governor of Cardenal Caro Province Julio Ibarra announced that an institute of higher education <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> to the province, whose name, Instituto Profesional IPG (IPG Professional Institute), was disclosed one month later. During the inauguration of the 2012 school year in Pichilemu, Education Regional Secretary Minister (Seremi) Pedro Larraín said IPEGE would work in the dependencies of Colegio de la Preciosa Sangre of Pichilemu.|$|E
5|$|It then {{occurred}} to me that these causes or their equivalents are continually acting in the case of animals also; and as animals usually breed much more quickly than does mankind, the destruction every year from these causes must be enormous in order to keep down the numbers of each species, since evidently they do not increase regularly from year to year, as otherwise the world would long ago have been crowded with those that breed most quickly. Vaguely thinking over the enormous and constant destruction which this implied, it {{occurred to}} me to ask the question, why do some die and some live? And the answer was clearly, on the whole the best fitted live... and considering the amount of individual variation that my experience as a collector had shown me to exist, then it followed that all the changes necessary for the adaptation of the species to the changing conditions <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> about... In this way every part of an animals organization could be modified exactly as required, and in the very process of this modification the unmodified would die out, and thus the definite characters and the clear isolation of each new species would be explained.|$|E
60|$|Thus here <b>would</b> <b>be</b> {{necessarily}} <b>brought</b> {{together in}} the very first of the work one hundred and thirty-two persons, besides the head-farmers, who at five also to each family are one hundred more; in all, two hundred and thirty-two.|$|R

50|$|Bhimji Parekh {{failed to}} realize his {{ambition}} of printing literature in Indian characters. The press might have printed some literature in English. It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> {{reasonable to assume}} that some types <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>brought</b> with the press. Priolkar substantiates this opinion by citing two documents that suggests printed material was available in Bombay at this time.|$|R
