5|$|Childhood and {{adolescence}} allows {{the development of}} an internal working model useful for forming attachments. This internal working model is related to the individual's state of mind which develops with respect to attachment generally and explores how attachment functions in relationship dynamics based on childhood and adolescent experience. The organization of an internal working model is generally seen as leading to more stable attachments in those who develop such a model, rather than those <b>who</b> <b>rely</b> more on the individual's state of mind alone in forming new attachments.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{well-established}} {{treatment for}} self-injurious behaviour in children or adolescents. Cognitive behavioural therapy {{may also be}} used to assist those with Axis I diagnoses, such as depression, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder. Dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) can be successful for those individuals exhibiting a personality disorder, and could potentially be used for those with other mental disorders who exhibit self-harming behaviour. Diagnosis and treatment of the causes of self-harm is thought {{by many to be the}} best approach to treating self-harm. But in some cases, particularly in people with a personality disorder, this is not very effective, so more clinicians are starting to take a DBT approach in order to reduce the behaviour itself. People <b>who</b> <b>rely</b> on habitual self-harm are sometimes hospitalised, based on their stability, their ability and especially their willingness to get help. In adolescents multisystem therapy shows promise. Treatments such as CBT, family intervention, interpersonal therapy, and various psychodynamic therapies were all shown to be possibly effective in treating self-injurious behaviour in children and adolescents.|$|E
5|$|This New Life is endless, {{and even}} after my {{physical}} death it will be kept alive by those who live the life of complete renunciation of falsehood, lies, hatred, anger, greed and lust; and who, to accomplish all this, do no lustful actions, do no harm to anyone, do no backbiting, do not seek material possessions or power, who accept no homage, neither covet honor nor shun disgrace, and fear no one and nothing; by those <b>who</b> <b>rely</b> wholly and solely on God, and who love God purely {{for the sake of}} loving; who believe in the lovers of God and in the reality of Manifestation, and yet do not expect any spiritual or material reward; who do not let go the hand of Truth, and who, without being upset by calamities, bravely and wholeheartedly face all hardships with one hundred percent cheerfulness, and give no importance to caste, creed and religious ceremonies. This New Life will live by itself eternally, even if there is no one to live it.|$|E

40|$|We {{show that}} WWI and the {{subsequent}} boycott against Central scientists severely interrupted international scientific cooperation. After 1914, citations to recent research from abroad decreased and paper titles became less similar (evaluated by Latent Semantic Analysis), suggesting a reduction in international knowledge flows. Reduced international scientific cooperation led {{to a decline in}} the production of basic science and its application in new technology. Specifically, we compare productivity changes for scientists <b>who</b> <b>relied</b> on frontier research from abroad, to changes for scientists <b>who</b> <b>relied</b> on frontier research from home. After 1914, scientists <b>who</b> <b>relied</b> on frontier research from abroad published fewer papers in top scientific journals, produced less Nobel Prize-nominated research, introduced fewer novel scientific words, and introduced fewer novel words that appeared in the text of subsequent patent grants.

40|$|Researchers {{have tended}} to assume that Anglo-American {{theories}} and practices are equally applicable to other countries with their unique contextual environments. The aim {{of this research is}} to show that the theoretical model and empirical research findings in Anglo-American countries, with respect to evaluation of internal control systems, are not applicable to China. Specifically, there are two approaches to evaluate internal control systems: one is a risk-based audit approach, and the other is a control-based audit approach. Morrill, Morrill, and Kopp (2012) show that Canadian accountants <b>who</b> <b>relied</b> on a risk-first approach identified significantly more internal control deficiencies than accountants <b>who</b> <b>relied</b> on a control-first approach. Contrary to the research findings in Canada, this study provides experimental evidence that Chinese auditors <b>who</b> <b>relied</b> on a control-first approach identified significantly more internal control deficiencies than auditors <b>who</b> <b>relied</b> on a risk-first approach. The findings have implications for global convergence of auditing practices. 16 page(s...|$|R

People in poverty in Canada more often access food banks, are often homeless, or in low-cost, sub-standard housing; {{they are part of the}} 'working poor' <b>who</b> <b>rely</b> on low wages, or are stuck in the poverty trap of welfare, and face hunger.|$|E
25|$|Several {{techniques}} {{are used by}} DJs {{as a means to}} better mix and blend recorded music.

Radio DJs are less likely to focus on advanced music-mixing procedures than club DJs, <b>who</b> <b>rely</b> on a smooth transition between songs using a range of techniques. However, some radio DJs are experienced club DJs, so they use the same sophisticated mixing techniques.|$|E

A number of scholars have done research on the negative effects of Internet communication as well. These researchers have contended that this form of communication is an impoverished version of conventional face-to-face social interactions, and therefore produce negative outcomes such as loneliness and depression for users <b>who</b> <b>rely</b> on social networking entirely. By engaging solely in online communication, interactions between communities, families, and other social groups are weakened.|$|E
