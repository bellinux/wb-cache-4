It may limit the rising environment temperature through thermal energy exchange with cold water that also absorbs the green house water soluble gases. This system works in two thermodynamic cycles i. e., i) hot gases enter into a tank and cold water/gases present in the tank are expelled out ii) the hot gases entry is switched off and cold water {{is connected to the}} tank. On cooling, water soluble gases/steam vapours are absorbed and internal temperature and pressure are reduced sucking water from low elevation (but at high pressure) into the tank. The water may be used by agriculture, industrial/domestic sectors.

The South African economy is heavily dependent on the gold mining industry, which is a major earner of foreign exchange and a large consumer of labour and agricultural and industrial output. The industry is also important as a source of finance for both the private sector and the Treasury. Curtailment of activity within the industry by closing down the more marginal mines or by shortening the life of the industry' as a whole because of rising costs and/or a hesitant gold price, will harm the South African economy in a number of ways. The industry has no option but to regard the gold price as given. The remaining ore reserves tend to be of a lower grade and/or to be found at greater depth. Controlling the working costs would seem to be almost the only option open to the industry...|$|E

The paper {{presents}} {{a study that}} will focus on daylighting and visual comfort for advanced façades, that deal with the dynamic behaviour of natural light. At the same time, it will aim at an integrated approach including thermal and acoustic comfort {{and the way they}} interact with each other. Critical aspects with regards to thermal and acoustic comfort are generally optimized in advanced façades, it is therefore necessary to implement the daylight comfort as well. For the advanced façades we consider triple and double glass façades (ventilated or not). This integrated approach is all the more important because a good balance between daylight, visual, thermal and acoustic comfort is essential to the general performance of a building as such (energy performance,…) and to the users of the building (well-being). This means that the study will have to use both ‘objective’ or ‘easy to quantify’ parameters and more ‘subjective’ or ‘less easy to quantify’ parameters. The study will concentrate on the working environment, in particular in office spaces which still offer a great opportunity for energy savings. Moreover, as people spend an important share of their lifetime indoors, a healthy indoor environment where occupants should benefit of an optimized comfort, can keep <b>working</b> <b>cost</b> low by increasing physiological and psychological well-being (increased human performance). The gathered results will finally be used to create a decision tool that acknowledges a holistic approach to evaluate and compare requirements for a healthy indoor environment.

If developing countries use energy efficient technology and integrate renewable energy systems in the new building their carbon dioxide emission rate reduces by 25 to 44 percent.   However, even now, renewable energy integrated buildings are hardly considered while constructing them.   This thesis work focuses on the study of solar cooling system options for residential house in Bahir Dar city. To meet the demand of housing in the city, different type of apartments and villa houses are under construction.  Case study was made focusing on two types of residential houses (condominium apartment and Impact Real-estate Villa house) to determine the cooling load and to select cooling system.   Simulation results of IDA ICE software show that the average operative temperatures and cooling loads for condominium apartment and Real-estate Vila are 31. 8 oC and 30. 7 oC, 5. 53 kW and 5. 73 kW respectively. Most of the residences are not satisfied at this operating temperature.   There are different types of solar cooling systems.   Solar Sorption cooling systems are commonly used which can also be classified in to absorption, adsorption and desiccant cooling systems.   Solar adsorption cooling systems are easy to manufacture locally as compared to solar absorption cooling systems. They do not have moving parts. Some of the working medium pairs used in adsorption cooling system are: Activated Carbon/Ammonia, Silica gel/ water, Zeolite/water. Adsorption chillier with Silica gel/ water as a working pair was selected since it can operate at regeneration/desorption temperature as low as 45 oC coming from flat plate collectors.  At 75 oC regeneration temperature, the system delivers 9 oC chilled water temperature.   The selected solar adsorption chiller has been compared with kerosene based adsorption cooling system using HOMER software.   In this project, the optimization was limited on cost comparison between the two energy sources.   The solar based cooling system has lower <b>working</b> <b>cost.</b>   From cooling load simulation result direct solar irradiation is the highest source of cooling load for both houses.

40|$|References {{appear at}} the end of each chapterThe {{importance}} of gold in the development of South Africa as an industrialised economy cannot be over - emphasised. Towards the end of the 19 th century the economy depended almost entirely on the production of gold and diamonds which laid the foundation for a highly - developed national economy. With gold still continuing to play an important role coupled with the recent price increases, a need was felt to investigate the potential effect of higher prices on gold production in South Africa. For reasons set out in the study, it was decided to compare potential out put for five different gold prices. A gold price received by the mines of 050 per ounce was used as abase. Further calculations were made at 060, 070, 0100 and 0150 per ounce. The calculations for all the cases were done duri ng the period when the Rand was floating with the Pound Sterling and a Rand : Dollar parity of 1 : 1, 2 4 was used. Since then two parity changes occured : the Rand was pegged to the Dollar on the 25 th October, 1972 to give a Rand : Dollar parity of 1 : 1, 27732, and the Dollar was devalued on the 13 th February, 1973 by 1 1, 1 % to give the present Rand : Dollar parity of 1 : 1, 4192. The e ffect of the above two parity changes is that revenue in Dollar terms is overstated by 14, 45 5 %. It is suggested that for purposes of this study the Rand figures be accepted and wherever Dollars are used in future estimates these be increased by the afore-mentioned 14, 455 %. In Dollar terms the five Cases analised will change as follows: Case A : 5350 becomes 057, 23 per ounce Case B : 260 becomes 068, 67 per ounce Case C : 270 becomes 080, 12 per ounce Case D : 0100 becomes 0114, 46 per ounce Case E : 0150 becomes 0171, 68 per ounce To do an in-depth investigation into the effects of higher gold prices on each individual mine, it was necessary to analyse the various parameters required in the determination of gold p r oduction, revenue, lease and tax payments, and dividends. For each mine the pay limits at the various gold prices and at estimated <b>working</b> <b>cost</b> levels, were determined. Graphs of the estimated tonnages at various pay limits as well as the average grade of ore mineable at these limits were determined. From these graphs it is possible to obtain the total tonnage mi neable at various pay limits. Once the foregoing parameters were obtained for each mine, it was possible to determine annual gold production, revenue, lease and tax payments and amounts available to share holders which are then summarised in tables and illustrated in graphs. For ease of reference the mines were divided up into geographica l areas. Gold production revenue, lease and tax payments to the State and the amounts available to shareholders are summarised and compared for the various gold prices. The summaries show bold production remaining fairly constant at or just below the present level of about 900 000 kilograms per year until 1978 for Case A, 1979 for Cases B and C, 1983 for Case D, and 1984 for Case E. before declining progressively thereafter. Revenue following the same pattern as gold production for Case A, as is to be expected, but increasing to a peak of R 1 466 million in 1977 for Case B before progressively declining, increasing to a peak of R 2 434 million in 1982 for Case D before progressively declining, increasing to a peak of R 3 478 million in 1983 for Case E but remaining above the 1973 level of R 1 254 million until the year 2005. Lease and tax payments and amounts available to share-holders following the same pattern as that indicated by revenue reaching peaks of respectively R 390 million and R 268 million for Case B R 485 million and R 339 million for Case C R 756 million and R 536 million for Case D R 1 000 million and R 779 million for Case E. Following the recent monetary unrest, gold prices assumed for 1973 are too conservative. Should the present gold price of about $ 80 and the 1972 level of production of 909 000 kilograms continue for the remainder of 1973, then gold production, revenue, lease and tax payments and dividends as shown for Case C for the year 1975 will be applicable for 1973. This shams gold production of 919 520 kilograms, gold revenue of R 1690 million, lease and tax payments of R 465 million, and dividends of R 339 million. The effect of the higher gold price can be clearly seen when the fore-going figures are compared with the 1971 totals of gold production of 97 6, 600 kilogr ams, revenue of R 396 million from gold, lease and tax payments of approximately R 139 million, and dividends of R 142 million. Despite a decline in gold production, revenue is expected to be up by 8 9 % whilst lease and tax payments increase by 2 35 % compared with a dividend increase of 139 %. Finally certain tax concessions to increase productivity and the rebuy alleviate the labour shortage, prolong the li ves of the mines by mining lower grade ore, and encourage exploration was investigated and suggestions made.
