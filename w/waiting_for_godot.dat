In 2009 he appeared in a very popular revival of <b>Waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>Godot</b> at London's Haymarket Theatre, directed by Sean Mathias, and playing opposite Patrick Stewart. He is Patron of English Touring Theatre and also President and Patron of the Little Theatre Guild of Great Britain, an association of amateur theatre organisations throughout the UK.

5|$|McKellen and {{his first}} partner, Brian Taylor, a history teacher from Bolton, began their {{relationship}} in 1964. Their relationship lasted for eight years, ending in 1972. They lived in London, where McKellen continued to pursue his career as an actor. For over a decade, he has lived in a five-storey Victorian conversion in Narrow Street, Limehouse. In 1978 he met his second partner, Sean Mathias, at the Edinburgh Festival. This relationship lasted until 1988, and acording to Mathias, was tempestuous, with conflicts over McKellen's success in acting versus Mathias's somewhat less-successful career. Mathias later directed McKellen in <b>Waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>Godot</b> at the Theatre Royal Haymarket in 2009. The pair entered into a business partnership with Evgeny Lebedev, purchasing the lease on The Grapes public house in Narrow Street.|$|E

25|$|Just after Didi and Gogo {{have been}} {{particularly}} selfish and callous, the boy comes to say that Godot is not coming. The boy (or pair of boys) may be seen to represent meekness and hope before compassion is consciously excluded by an evolving personality and character, and in which case may be the youthful Pozzo and Lucky. Thus Godot is compassion and fails to arrive every day, as he says he will. No-one is concerned that a boy is beaten. In this interpretation, there is the irony that only by changing their hearts to be compassionate can the characters fixed to the tree move on and cease to have to <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>Godot.</b>|$|R

Upon Vladimir's return, the increasingly jaded Estragon suggests that they hang themselves, but they abandon the idea when the logistics seem ineffective. They then speculate on the potential rewards of continuing to <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>Godot,</b> but can come to no definite conclusions. When Estragon declares his hunger, Vladimir provides a carrot (among a collection of turnips), at which Estragon idly gnaws, loudly reiterating his boredom.|$|R

Here {{they came up}} with the idea for Bottom, which they said was a cruder cousin to <b>Waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>Godot.</b> Bottom was commissioned by the BBC and three series were shown between 1991 and 1995. Mayall appeared in Bottom as Richard 'Richie' Richard alongside Edmondson's Eddie Elizabeth Hitler. The series featured slapstick violence taken to new extremes, and gained a strong cult following.|$|E

50|$|In the end, however, MacIntyre {{tells us}} that we are <b>waiting</b> not <b>for</b> <b>Godot</b> but <b>for</b> St Benedict.

To MacIntyre, morals and virtues can only be comprehended through their relation to the community in which they come from. Whereas Rawls tells us to conceive of justice through abstracting ourselves from who we are (through the veil of ignorance, for example) MacIntyre disagrees. Running throughout After Virtue is the belief that in order to comprehend who we are, we must understand where we come from.|$|R

With a limited run of seven weeks and an all-star cast, it was financially successful, but the critical reception was not particularly favourable, with Frank Rich of The New York Times writing, [...] "Audiences will still be <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> a transcendent <b>Godot</b> long after the clowns at Lincoln Center, like so many others passing through Beckett's eternal universe before them, have come and gone." ...|$|R
25|$|It is daytime {{again and}} Vladimir begins singing a {{recursive}} round {{about the death}} of a dog, but twice forgets the lyrics as he sings. Again, Estragon claims to have been beaten last night, despite no apparent injury. Vladimir comments that the formerly bare tree now has leaves and tries to confirm his recollections of yesterday against Estragon's extremely vague, unreliable memory. Vladimir then triumphantly produces evidence of the previous day's events by showing Estragon the wound from when Lucky kicked him. Noticing Estragon's barefootedness, they also discover his previously forsaken boots nearby, which Estragon insists are not his, although they fit him perfectly. With no carrots left, Vladimir is turned down in offering Estragon a turnip or a radish. He then sings Estragon to sleep with a lullaby before noticing further evidence to confirm his memory: Lucky's hat still lies on the ground. This leads to his waking Estragon and involving him in a frenetic hat-swapping scene. The two then <b>wait</b> again <b>for</b> <b>Godot,</b> while distracting themselves by playfully imitating Pozzo and Lucky, firing insults at each other and then making up, and attempting some fitness routinesall of which fail miserably and end quickly.|$|R
25|$|The title {{character}} of Balzac's 1851 play Mercadet {{is waiting for}} financial salvation from his never-seen business partner, Godeau. Although Beckett was familiar with Balzac's prose, he insisted that he learned of the play after finishing <b>Waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>Godot.</b>|$|E
25|$|Several {{programs}} on the Adult Swim network have drawn inspiration from the works of Samuel Beckett.

25|$|Comparisons {{have also}} been drawn with Samuel Beckett's <b>Waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>Godot,</b> for the {{presence}} of two central characters who almost appear to be two halves of a single character.
