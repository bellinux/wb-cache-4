50|$|There are two {{distinct}} genetically determined types of earwax: the <b>wet</b> <b>type,</b> which is dominant, and the dry type, which is recessive. While East Asians and Native Americans {{are more likely}} to have the dry type of cerumen (gray and flaky), African and European people {{are more likely to}} have the <b>wet</b> <b>type</b> (honey-brown to dark-brown and moist). Cerumen type has been used by anthropologists to track human migratory patterns, such as those of the Eskimos. In Japan, wet-type earwax is more prevalent among the Ainu, in contrast to that country's Yamato majority. The consistency of <b>wet</b> <b>type</b> earwax is due to the higher concentration of lipid and pigment s (50% lipid) in the substance than the dry type (30% lipid).|$|R

40|$|In Korea, {{there is}} growing {{interest}} in the remodeling of aged apartment buildings. Traditionally, the heating panel in Korea is a <b>wet</b> <b>type</b> floor heating panel that utilizes radiation. But if a <b>wet</b> <b>type</b> floor heating panel is installed in an aged apartment during its remodeling, some problems may occur. They include failure to secure enough ceiling height, to reduce level of floor impact noise and possibility that the load on the existing structure is increased. In other words, a <b>wet</b> <b>type</b> floor heating panel {{may not be in}} compliance with the Korea building codes when it is used in remodeling of such apartment structures. Therefore, a prefabricated floor heating system which is thin and lightweight is suggested as an alternative to a <b>wet</b> <b>type</b> floor heating panel. In this research, first, the building codes that restrict, directly and indirectly, the prefabricated floor heating panel for an apartment remodeling were investigated. Second, the available thickness of panel was calculated so that it complies with the building code, and it was found {{that there is a need}} to develop a new prefabricated floor heating panel that can be installed in an aged apartment to be remodeled. Third, the design parameters of a floor heating panel were classified and determined according to their role to design reasonably within the available thickness by studying the standards and technical documents...|$|R

5000|$|Additionally, {{delineating}} sub-types {{within a}} particular design is not always consistent. For example, almost all <b>type</b> <b>collectors</b> consider the 1909 [...] "V.D.B."

Likewise in the Lincoln cent series, the composition change in 1943 to steel and the composition change in 1982 from bronze to copper-plated zinc are considered separate types by almost all, but the brass composition used in 1944-1946 is not considered a separate type from the 1947 return to bronze.

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} two intravitreal bevacizumab (IVB) injections on peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness in patients with <b>wet</b> <b>type</b> age-related macular degeneration (ARMD). Methods: This prospective interventional case series included 18 eyes of 18 patients receiving two IVB injections within a 6 weeks interval for treatment of <b>wet</b> <b>type</b> ARMD. Peripapillary RNFL thickness was measured prior to the first injection, and 12 and 24 weeks afterwards by optical coherence tomography (3 D OCT- 1000, Topcon Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). Mean RNFL thickness and values in the four peripapillary quadrants were compared at baseline, and 12 and 24 weeks after initial injection. Results: Mean RNFL thickness was 89 ± 21 μm at baseline which was significantly reduced to 82 ± 15 μm at 12 weeks (P = 0. 021). At final follow-up (week 24), mean RNFL thickness reached 87 ± 23 μm and was comparable to baseline values (P = 0. 356). Only the temporal quadrant showed {{a significant reduction in}} RNFL thickness at 12 weeks (P = 0. 033); this quadrant followed the same pattern of change as the mean RNFL thickness, becoming comparable to pre-injection values at 24 weeks (P = 0. 298). Conclusion: RNFL thickness may decrease temporarily following two IVB injections in patients with <b>wet</b> <b>type</b> ARMD; however, in the long-term no significant change was detectable from baseline values...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{examine the effect of}} rapid sand {{filtration}} on NOM in reduced groundwater, groundwater with high concentrations of iron, ammonia, manganese and NOM was treated in a pilot plant consisting of a trickling filter column (TFI) followed by a <b>wet</b> <b>type</b> filter column (WFII) and a separate <b>wet</b> <b>type</b> filter column (WFsep). The organic carbon flow (adsorption + biodegradation) was calculated from the biomass detected in iron sludge. The influence of the filtration process on BOM was investigated by AOC and BDOC determinations. The results showed that the decrease of the organic carbon content by TFI and WFsep was caused by adsorption onto iron flocks and biodegradation. The bioprocesses in TFI and WFsep were responsible for BDOC reduction. Predominant production of AOC by TFI and predominant AOC reduction by WFsep suggested that the AOC was effected by chemical reactions depending on the oxygen concentration in the filter layer and the contact time in the filter column. Thus, for groundwater treatment by rapid sand filtration <b>wet</b> <b>type</b> filtration should always be preferred. If trickling filtration is necessary for elimination of high iron and ammonia contents contact time in the filter column should be as short as possible. (orig.)

40|$|We {{evaluated}} experimental {{collection of}} Pinctada mazatlanica spat on substrates of different textures and colors placed at different depths within settlement tanks. When larvae reached the pediveliger stage (day 25), black-colored spat <b>collectors</b> ("envelope" <b>type)</b> {{composed of the}} following materials were offered as settlement substrates: onion bag, mosquito net, fishing net, and 63 % shade-cloth. Spat collectors measured 30 x 30 cm and were composed of an outer bag and inner substrate made of the same material. The influence {{of the color of}} spat collector material on recruitment was investigated using a second <b>type</b> of spat <b>collector</b> composed of onion bags as the outer bag and inner substrate ("bag" type). Bags were prepared in 3 different outer/inner (O/I) color combinations of green/green, green/black, and red/black (O/I). Both <b>types</b> of <b>collectors</b> were deployed at different depths within settlement tanks. Approximately 2. 7 % of the initial larval population survived, resulting in 35, 583 spat. Of these, 71. 3 % recruited to bag <b>type</b> <b>collectors,</b> 21. 9 % to envelope <b>type</b> <b>collectors,</b> and 6. 8 % to the surfaces of the culture tanks. Spat recruitment was significantly affected by collector material (P < 0. 01), with fishing net and shade-cloth yielding highest and lowest density of spat, respectively. Similarly, spat collector color combination significantly influenced spat collection (P < 0. 01), with higher recruitment to red and green substrates. For both spat <b>collector</b> <b>types,</b> there was significantly greater (P < 0. 01) recruitment of spat to collectors {{in the middle of the}} water column (60 - 90 -cm depth).

40|$|Introduction: Age-related macular {{degeneration}} (AMD) {{has become a}} catastrophic health problem throughout the world because of the aging population. Destruction of the macular architecture in the <b>wet</b> <b>type</b> form {{is a major problem}} that results from AMD and is irreversible. Working on preventive measures is, therefore, of critical importance. Because pentraxins (PTX) become elevated in the body in stressful, oxidized conditions, this study examines the role they play in AMD. The similarity between the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis and AMD and the role of PTX 3 in atheromas were also factors that support conducting this study. Methods: This case-control study used 40 eyes that were at different stages of <b>wet</b> <b>type</b> AMD. The eyes were from patients who were over the age of 50 and had not had intraocular surgery or choroidal neovascularization (CNV) due to non-AMD causes. The control group included 49 eyes with normal macula. These study groups were matched according to age and gender, and the serum levels of PTX 3 were analyzed. Results: The mean ages of the patients were 70. 7 ± 9. 0 and 69. 6 ± 7. 4 years among the case group and the control group, respectively (P = 0. 540) while the male to female ratios were 2. 64 and 1. 19, respectively (P = 0. 091). The PTX 3 (P = 0. 002), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) (P = 0. 008) and triglyceride (TGs) (P = 0. 032) were significantly higher among the <b>wet</b> <b>type</b> AMD cases. Conclusion: PTX 3 appears to be a component in the pathogenesis of AMD and, therefore, could be a target for possible pharmaceutical interventions to stop or reduce the progression of this ominous disease...|$|R

There {{are two types of}} liquid-type PVT collectors, depending on the existence or absence of a glass cover over the PV module. The glass-covered (glazed) PVT collector produces relatively more thermal energy but has a lower electrical yield, whereas the uncovered (unglazed) PVT collector has a relatively low thermal energy and somewhat higher electrical performance. The thermal and electrical performance of liquid-type PVT collectors is related not only to the collector design, such as whether a glass cover is used, but also to the absorber design, that is, whether the absorber is for the sheet-and-tube type or the fully <b>wetted</b> <b>type.</b> The design of the absorber, as it comes into contact with the PV modules and the liquid tubes, is regarded as important, as it is related to the heat transfer from the PV modules to the liquid in the tubes.

40|$|AbstractWith the {{objective}} of reducing costs and proliferating use, a special Direct Solar Irradiation Collector (DSIC) solar water heater was developed. To produce a commercially feasible product, a full research and development program was conducted that included several generations of prototypes {{and a range of}} design criteria such as material selection, manufacturing processes, economics, and materials availability. The result was a Parallel Plate <b>type</b> <b>collector</b> made out of polymers which is designed for temperate weather and low pressure household-use.

The present study introduces the concept and includes numerical and experimental results made on a scaled prototype. The numerical analysis compares the pressure-drop across 3 collectors. The pressure-drop is better by almost a factor of 4 when comparing the DSIC and a Parallel Tubes <b>type</b> <b>collector.</b> Performance tests were conducted outdoors to measure the temperature and solar irradiation as a function of time. Different ratios between collection area and water volume were tested.

A detailed dynamic simulation model was developed based on mass and energy balance equations. The simulation results show that the system performance with wing type CPC increases by up to 6 % in the summer and up to 2 % in the winter, compared to the performance with a linear CPC having same collector length.
