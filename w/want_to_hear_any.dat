500|$|Manning {{said the}} {{incident}} that had affected her the most was when 15 detainees had been arrested by the Iraqi Federal Police for printing anti-Iraqi literature. She {{was asked by the}} Army to find out who the [...] "bad guys" [...] were, and discovered that the detainees had followed what Manning said was a corruption trail within the Iraqi cabinet. She reported this to her commanding officer, but said [...] "he didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>any</b> of it"; she said the officer told her to help the Iraqi police find more detainees. Manning said it made her realize, [...] "i was actively involved in something that i was completely against..." ...|$|E
500|$|The album sold {{a million}} copies in the United States, and five million worldwide. Taraborrelli felt that at that moment, riding on Madonna's coattails proved {{profitable}} for everyone involved, including Warner Bros. Records, which notched up big sales with a compilation soundtrack album that was basically a showcase for its marginal artists. But still they wanted to [...] "milk-in" [...] the success of Madonna, a view shared by Peter Guber and Jon Peters, executive producers of the film. Hence they felt a worldwide concert tour was the appropriate thing to do, since it would promote both the soundtrack and the film, as well as Madonna's successful third studio album True Blue, released the year before. As Madonna's first world tour, Who's That Girl ended up being a resounding success, although by its end, Madonna declared {{that she did not}} <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>any</b> of her songs again and she did not know whether she would ever write another one. [...] "I returned feeling so burned out and I was convinced that I wouldn't go near music for quite a while", she said.|$|E
500|$|A {{follow-up}} to Smith's 2000 album was originally planned {{to happen with}} Rob Schnapf, but their sessions were abandoned. Smith also began distancing himself from manager Margaret Mittleman, who had handled him since the Roman Candle days. He finally began recording a new album with only himself and Jon Brion as producers sometime during 2001. The pair had recorded {{a substantial amount of}} music for the album when Brion confronted Smith about his drug and alcohol abuse. Their friendship promptly ended, and Smith scrapped all of their work until that point. He later said [...] "There was even a little more than half of a record done before this new one that I just scrapped because of a blown friendship with someone that made me so depressed I didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>any</b> of those songs. He was just helping me record the songs and stuff, and then the friendship kind of fell apart all of a sudden one day. It just made it kind of awkward being alone in the car listening to the songs." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1998, {{a number}} of militants began to speak openly of their disdain for Atef, leading Bin Laden to convene a meeting at which he spoke at length about Abu Bakr's loyalty to Muhammad. Comparing Atef to the Prophet's lieutenant, he {{reminded}} those present that Atef [...] "knew of Jihad before most of you were even born", and warned them that he didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>any</b> more [...] "negative talk" [...] about Atef.|$|E

We also grant {{that she should be}} honored, since we, according to Saint Paul's words 12 are indebted to show honor one to another {{for the sake of the}} One who dwells in us, Jesus Christ. Therefore we have an obligation to honor Mary. But be careful to give her honor that is fitting. Unfortunately, I worry that we give her all too high an honor for she is accorded much more esteem than she should be given or than she accounted to herself.|$|R

5000|$|As {{a result}} of the novel's success, the {{adjective}} [...] "Pollyannaish" [...] and the noun [...] "Pollyannaism" [...] became popular terms for a personality type characterised by irrepressible optimism evident in the face of even the most adverse or discouraging of circumstances. It is sometimes used pejoratively, referring to someone whose optimism is excessive to the point of naïveté or refusing to accept the facts of an unfortunate situation. This pejorative use can be heard in the introduction of the 1930 George and Ira Gershwin song [...] "But Not For Me": [...] "I never <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> from <b>any</b> cheerful pollyannas/who tell me fate supplies a mate/that's all bananas."

50|$|Having become obstinate {{due to the}} {{conflicts}} with the Amsterdam ministry, apostle Van Bemmel put this spiritual law aside. He did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> of <b>any</b> very much needed appointment of new ministers. He thought that the office of prophet was un-biblical; - the Holy Spirit revealed Himself by anyone with the gift of prophecy. Callings he found unnecessary, helpers he could appoint himself. Neither did he believe in the election of deacons by the congregation, he appointed them himself. Thus {{in a short time}} did not only the ministries of overseer (angel) and elder disappear, but also those of evangelist and prophet. In 1903 Van Bemmel was gravely rebuked for this apostasy in a word of prophecy with the words: 'Was it not I Who gave My deceased ap. Schwartz the Law of the Spirit? Therefore, My apostle, I want that thou shouldst bring this Law unto fulfilment,' etc.|$|R

When Vanessa arrives, however, she hates the [...] "girly" [...] theme Doofenshmirtz has chosen and sits down to mope at a table, fearing that this would embarrass {{her in front of}} her arriving goth friends. At Phineas and Ferb's house, Love Händel's rehearsal descends into infighting; sure that no one will <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> them <b>any</b> more, the band are again on the verging of breaking up when they hear the roar of the crowd.

At the same moment the band begins to play; Candace and Linda arrive home.

5000|$|The {{idea for}} the festival came from the {{reporter}} of Politika, Blagoje Radivojević (1925-2016). He was correspondent from Čačak where in 1961 he noticed a band of trumpeters, playing the farewell to the brigade of the Youth work actions at Čačak's railway station. He suggested to the local administration in the Lučani municipality (to which the region of Dragačevo {{and the town of}} Guča administratively belong), to add the trumpeters, as the [...] "special musical heritage of this part of Serbia", to the already existing festival [...] "Dragačevo through sing and dance". The suggestion evolved into the separate trumpet festival. Radivojević, with the help of author , unsuccessfully urged many individuals and organizations in order to gain the support for the project, until they made contact with one of highest authorities in Serbia at the time, a politician and former intelligence officer Slobodan Penezić Krcun. He allowed it, but warned them: [...] "all right, but I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> about <b>any</b> Serbian nationalism there" [...] (dobro, ali nemoj da čujem da je bilo nekakvog srbovanja).|$|R
50|$|Hanabi's short fused and pushy yet sweet {{childhood}} friend. They {{were friends}} since birth and next door neighbors. He {{claimed to have}} practically raised Hanabi. He trained Hanabi to be strong. Ultimately making her who she is now. He moved to Denmark when Hanabi began elementary school because of his father's work, but promised to return when she became really strong. Ten years later, he returned to Japan to fulfill his promise. He came {{for a short period}} of time to look for houses in the area. He told Hanabi to break up with her boyfriend to be with him. He took Hanabi to a love hotel to 'make her a woman', but they didn't go in. However, they were spotted by Hanabi's schoolmates who misunderstood the situation and spread the gossip around school. Yasuaki squashed that rumor immediately by saying that Hanabi was just showing an old friend around town. Yasuaki was still jealous though, and spoke harshly to Hanabi, assuming that she and Takeru were together. She got upset and proclaimed that she chose Takeru, not <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>any</b> more of Yasuaki's mean words. Hanabi was going to tell Takeru her decision when she found that Takeru and Yasuaki got into a fight. She immediately ran to Yasuaki and realized who she really chose. Yasuaki admitted to being jealous of Takeru and mentioned that the two acted and talked in the same way. Takeru told Hanabi to meet him at the airport to answer his confession, but she called him instead and told him she chose Yasuaki. He told Hanabi that if you just try something, you may actually have fun. Takeru returned later, with no signs of backing down. He took Yasuaki and Hanabi to pick up Hanabi's father at the airport. Hanabi's father got bad first impressions of Yasuaki and said that he preferred Takeru. He even called Takeru and Hanabi 'Takebi'. It turned out that he was only testing Yasuaki and Yasuaki passed his test, giving his approval for the relationship. Hanabi finally stood up to Takeru when he offered to pick her up and take her home but she declined, spending the night with Yasuaki instead.|$|R
