5|$|Phellinus ellipsoideus {{has been}} {{recorded}} growing on the fallen <b>wood</b> <b>of</b> oaks of the subgenus Cyclobalanopsis, {{as well as the}} <b>wood</b> <b>of</b> other flowering plants. The species favours the trunks of trees, where it feeds as a saprotroph, causing white rot. P.ellipsoideus fruit bodies are perennial growers, allowing them to, in the correct circumstances, grow very large. The species is found in the tropical and subtropical areas of China; it {{has been recorded}} in Fujian Province and Hainan Province. It is not a common species, and fruit bodies are only occasionally encountered.|$|E
5|$|The <b>wood</b> <b>of</b> the bending part of {{the limb}} ("dustar") must endure intense {{shearing}} stress, and denser woods such as hard maples are normally used in Turkish bows. Bamboo, and <b>wood</b> <b>of</b> the mulberry family, are traditional in China. Some composite bows have nonbending tips ("siyahs"), which need to be stiff and light; they may be made of woods such as Sitka spruce.|$|E

5|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} Mycena purpureofusca grow singly or in {{clusters}} on the decaying <b>wood</b> <b>of</b> conifers, particularly spruce, pine, and Douglas-fir.

5|$|Theophrastus {{describes}} the <b>wood</b> <b>of</b> different trees, {{the effects of}} climate on <b>wood,</b> <b>of</b> knots and 'coiling' in timber and other differences in quality. He discusses which woods to use for specific purposes such as for carpentry, shipbuilding and for building houses, {{and the making of}} charcoal. The most useful trees are said to be silver-fir and fir, and they have the best wood in the largest sizes; the silver-fir is softer than the fir, and its wood has layers like an onion, and is made entirely of these layers. The strongest and most attractive wood is smooth, without knots. In Syria, terebinth wood is dark and close-grained, Theophrastus reports, and used both for the handles of daggers and, turned on the lathe, for making cups. He claims that the hardest timber is of oak and holm oak, while elm warps the least, so it is used for the pivots and sockets of doors, which must be straight. The <b>wood</b> <b>of</b> palms is light and soft like cork-oak, but is tougher and less brittle, so it is good for carving images. Timber from the cedar, ebony, box, olive, oak and sweet chestnut keeps well and resists decay. He asserts that Tamarisk wood from Greece is weak, but from the Arabian island of Tylos it is as strong as kermes-oak. The <b>wood</b> <b>of</b> oak and the knotted parts of fir and silver-fir are described as the hardest to work. Ships are generally made of silver-fir, fir, and Syrian cedar; in Cyprus they use Aleppo pine which is better than the fir that grows there. Theophrastus records that in the lowlands of Italy (the country of the Latins) they grow bay, myrtle and excellent beech trees long enough for the whole length of a ship.|$|E
5|$|Wood is pulped {{for paper}} {{and used in}} the {{manufacture}} of cardboard and made into engineered wood products for use in construction such as fibreboard, hardboard, chipboard and plywood. The <b>wood</b> <b>of</b> conifers is known as softwood while that of broad-leaved trees is hardwood.|$|E
5|$|A {{saprobic}} species, Hapalopilus nidulans {{causes a}} white rot in its host. Fruit {{bodies of the}} fungus grow singly, in groups, or in fused and overlapping clusters on the <b>wood</b> <b>of</b> dead and decaying deciduous trees. Preferred hosts include Quercus (oak), Fagus (beech), and Betula (birch), although on rare occasions it has been recorded on conifer wood as well. In central Europe, its preferred host is oak, while in northern Europe it is found most commonly on Corylus and Sorbus. Fruiting typically occurs from early summer to autumn, but the tough fruit bodies are persistent and may be encountered out of the usual growing season.|$|E

5|$|At {{the hill}} of Puigpardines, Juigné was being already harassed by 80 armed peasants {{of the local}} somatent–a type of militia–, when the arrival of Sala's, Mas' and Baliart's miquelets {{convinced}} him to withdraw. When they tried to cross back the Fluvià, however, they found the way blocked. Juigné decided then attempting to escape to Olot across the <b>wood</b> <b>of</b> Malatosquera and through the bridge of Sant Roc, but the Catalans anticipated him. Sala divided his miquelets in two groups of 300 men each one, and while Josep Mas de Roda, leading the first one, pursued and attacked the French troops across the wood, he blocked the bridge of Sant Roc ahead the second group. During the running fight under the trees Juigné's force lost 25 men and abandoned part of its ammunitions.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} World War II, Cedar Point {{was in need of}} {{financial}} help. The <b>wood</b> <b>of</b> the Cyclone roller coaster was rotting, the boardwalk was cracked in many places, and the fishing dock was in need of repair. In 1946, Cedar Point's oldest still-existing ride, the Midway Carousel, was installed. By 1951, the Cyclone coaster was razed because of its poor condition, leaving the resort without a roller coaster. As the Cyclone was being removed, the Laff-in-the-Dark, Rocket Ships, and Loop-A-Plane attractions were installed. Cedar Point Causeway was built in 1957, and is still in use. The president of Cedar Point, Bernie Zeiher, was replaced by George Roose around 1958, and Emile Legros was elected chairman that same year.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{deterioration}} of the <b>wood</b> <b>of</b> the exterior balconies over time, Queen RanavalonaII commissioned James Cameron to reinforce and encase the original structure in a stone shell in 1867. Cameron's exterior replaced the wooden balconies with stone walls three stories high. On each of the three floors, seven arched windows run the length of the two longer side walls while five windows illuminate the shorter front and back walls. A square tower stands at each of the four corners of the stone shell, extending above the level of the walls and forming their junction. A clock and bells were installed in the north-eastern tower.|$|E

The variety kinabaluensis (named after its type locality, Kinabalu) has a cap margin that is not scalloped, little or no odor, and cheilocystidia with shorter processes. It was found growing on the dead <b>wood</b> <b>of</b> Lithocarpus havilandii, a stone oak tree in the beech family. Variety subglobospora, found in Sabah, has spores that are almost spherical.|$|E
5|$|Fruit {{bodies of}} Mycena adscendens are found {{scattered}} to grouped together in twos or threes on fallen twigs, bark, and woody debris of hardwoods {{during the spring}} and autumn; it fruits less frequently on the <b>wood</b> <b>of</b> conifers. Fruitings are most common after periods of wet weather. They are also found growing on hazel nuts that have fallen to the ground; two other Mycenas known to grow on this substrate include M.discopus and M.nucicola. In the United States, it is known from Washington to California. It {{is also found in}} Europe, and has been collected in Amasya Province, Turkey. The variety carpophila, originally described from Denmark, was reported from Japan in 2003.|$|E
5|$|Galerina marginata is a {{saprobic}} fungus, obtaining nutrients {{by breaking}} down organic matter. It {{is known to}} have most of the major classes of secreted enzymes that dissolve plant cell wall polysaccharides, and {{has been used as a}} model saprobe in recent studies of ectomycorrhizal fungi. Because of its variety of enzymes capable of breaking down wood and other lignocellulosic materials, the Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute (JGI) is currently sequencing its genome. The fungus is typically reported to grow on or near the <b>wood</b> <b>of</b> conifers, although it has been observed to grow on hardwoods as well. Fruit bodies may grow solitarily, but more typically in groups or small clusters, and appear in the summer to autumn. Sometimes, they may grow on buried wood and thus appear to be growing on soil.|$|E
