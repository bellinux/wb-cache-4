5|$|A {{series of}} superb club cricket {{performances}} removed {{any doubt that}} Wills would play for Victoria in the next intercolonial against New South Wales, scheduled for March 1872 on the MCG. Before the game, representatives from both colonies met and entered into a bilateral agreement designed to call Wills. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> bowling, Wills became the first cricketer to be called for throwing in a top-class Australian match. He was called two more times in two overs, and did not bowl again. He was again no-balled when a Victorian side under his captaincy lost to a combined XIII from New South Wales, Tasmania and South Australia late in 1872.|$|E
5|$|In December 1958 Ngo Dinh NhuDiem's {{younger brother}} and chief adviserbroached {{the idea of}} {{orchestrating}} a coup to overthrow Sihanouk. Nhu contacted Dap Chhuon, Sihanouk's Interior Minister, who {{was known for his}} pro-American sympathies, to prepare for the coup against his boss. Chhuon received covert financial and military assistance from Thailand, South Vietnam, and the CIA. In January 1959 Sihanouk learned of the coup plans through intermediaries who were in contact with Chhuon. The following month, Sihanouk sent the army to capture Chhuon, who was summarily executed {{as soon as he was}} captured, effectively ending the coup attempt. Sihanouk then accused South Vietnam and the United States of orchestrating the coup attempt. Six months later, on 31August 1959, a small packaged lacquer gift, which was fitted with a parcel bomb, was delivered to the royal palace. Norodom Vakrivan, the chief of protocol, was killed instantly <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> package. Sihanouk's parents, Suramarit and Kossamak, who were sitting in another room not far from Vakrivan, narrowly escaped unscathed. An investigation traced the origin of the parcel bomb to an American military base in Saigon. While Sihanouk publicly accused Ngo Dinh Nhu of masterminding the bomb attack, he secretly suspected that the US was also involved. The incident deepened his distrust of the US.|$|E

25|$|A {{right-handed}} batsman, Vincent {{made his}} Test match debut in 2001–02 <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> batting against Australia at Perth. In a bizarre New Zealand first innings of 534/9 declared which saw four players make hundreds but no-one else reach double figures, Vincent made 104.

25|$|Dowsley {{made his}} {{first-class}} debut in a match against Tasmania at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in 1937/38 <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> batting and made scores of 46 and 72 not out.

25|$|His {{statistics}} on his international debut tour to New Zealand {{were not very}} impressive, as he got two wickets {{at the cost of}} 48 runs apiece, but he did get five wickets quite cheaply on Zimbabwe's tour of South Africa. Nevertheless, Morkel was picked for the Africa squad to play Asia in the 2005 Afro-Asia Cup, but withdrew due to injury. He appeared however for Africa the following series, in 2007, and made history in the second game <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> bowling with his brother Morné, the first time two brothers have done so in ODI cricket.|$|E

Japanese runner Yoshinori Sakai was born in Hiroshima on 6 August 1945, the day the nuclear weapon Little Boy destroyed that city. He symbolized the rebirth of Japan after the Second World War <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> 1964 Tokyo Games. At the 1976 Games in Montreal, two teenagers— one from the French-speaking part of the country, one from the English-speaking part— symbolized the unity of Canada.

25|$|After the 2006 World Cup, Eduardo {{returned}} to the national team under new coach Slaven Bilić and started Croatia's friendly match against Italy on 16 August 2006, scoring the first goal in Croatia's 2–0 victory.

He made his competitive debut at senior international level in Croatia's goalless away draw against Russia on 6 September 2006 and went on to score his first competitive international goal for Croatia on 11 October 2006 in their 2–0 home win against England, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> scoring by sending a looping header over the stranded Paul Robinson. In the following qualifier, away to Israel on 15 November 2006, Eduardo netted a hat-trick to help Croatia to drive home a narrow 4–3 victory over the strong Israeli side.|$|E
25|$|Oliver Evans began {{developing}} a high pressure steam engine {{that was more}} practical than the engine developed {{around the same time}} by Richard Trevithick in England. The high pressure engine did away with the separate condenser and thus did not require cooling water. It also had a higher power to weight ratio, making it suitable for powering steamboats and locomotives. Evans produced a few custom steam engines from 1801 to 1806, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> Mars Works foundry and factory near Philadelphia, where he produced additional engines. In 1812 he produced his successful Colombian engine at Mars. As his business grew and orders were being shipped inland, Evans and a partner formed the Pittsburgh Steam Engine Company in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Steam engines soon became common in public water supply, sawmills and flour milling, especially in areas with little or no water power.|$|E
