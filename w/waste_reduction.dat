40|$|Use of {{disposable}} products in hospitals {{continues to increase}} despite limited landfill space and dwindling natural resources. We analyzed the use and disposal patterns {{of disposable}} hospital products to identify means of reducing noninfectious, nonhazardous hospital waste. In a 385 -bed private teaching hospital, the 20 disposable products of which the greatest amounts (by weight) were purchased, were identified, and total hospital waste was tabulated. Samples of trash from three areas were sorted and weighed, and potential <b>waste</b> <b>reductions</b> from recycling and substituting reusable items were calculated. Business paper, trash liners, diapers, custom surgical packs, paper gowns, plastic suction bottles, and egg-crate pads were among the 20 top items and were analyzed individually. Data from sorted trash documented potential <b>waste</b> <b>reductions</b> through recycling and substitution of 78, 41, and 18 tonnes per year (1 tonne = 1, 000 kg = 1. 1 tons) from administration, the operating room, and adult wards, respectively (total hospital waste was 939 tonnes per year).

25|$|An {{important}} {{method of}} waste management is {{the prevention of}} waste material being created, also known as <b>waste</b> <b>reduction.</b> Methods of avoidance include reuse of second-hand products, repairing broken items instead of buying new, designing products to be refillable or reusable (such as cotton instead of plastic shopping bags), encouraging consumers to avoid using disposable products (such as disposable cutlery), removing any food/liquid remains from cans and packaging, and designing products that use less material {{to achieve the same}} purpose (for example, lightweighting of beverage cans).|$|E
25|$|The occurrence, {{nature and}} {{significance}} of environmental effects varies among livestock production systems. Grazing of livestock can be beneficial for some wildlife species, but not for others. Targeted grazing of livestock {{is used as a}} food-producing alternative to herbicide use in some vegetation management. Meat-producing livestock can provide environmental benefits through <b>waste</b> <b>reduction,</b> e.g. conversion of human-inedible residues of food crops. Manure from meat-producing livestock is used as fertilizer; it may be composted before application to food crops. Substitution of animal manures for synthetic fertilizers in crop production can be environmentally significant, as between 43 and 88 MJ of fossil fuel energy are used per kg of nitrogen in manufacture of synthetic nitrogenous fertilizers.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} best use a diamond gemstone's {{material}} properties, {{a number of}} different diamond cuts have been developed. A diamond cut constitutes a more or less symmetrical arrangement of facets, which together modify the shape and appearance of a diamond crystal. Diamond cutters must consider several factors, such as the shape and size of the crystal, when choosing a cut. The practical history of diamond cuts {{can be traced back to}} the Middle Ages, while their theoretical basis was not developed until the turn of the 20th century. Design creation and innovation continue to the present day: new technology—notably laser cutting and computer-aided design—has enabled the development of cuts whose complexity, optical performance, and <b>waste</b> <b>reduction</b> were hitherto unthinkable.|$|E

40|$|The {{quantities}} of waste {{generated by the}} healthcare sector in the United Kingdom (UK) {{have been shown to}} be amongst the highest in Europe. Based on a case study undertaken within the Cornwall NHS (National Health Service) in the UK, this paper reports on the results of waste minimisation trials. The schemes were able to achieve significant <b>waste</b> <b>reductions</b> in both clinical and domestic waste quantities. Indeed, a reduction in domestic bag waste in the range of 1. 6 - 33. 4 %, with an average of 14. 8 % was realised. For clinical <b>waste,</b> the <b>reduction</b> ranged from 1. 8 % to 38. 3 %, at an average of 15. 7 %, with net cost benefits of nearly US$ 25, 000 over the period of 1 - 3 years.

40|$|An Industrial Assessment Center (IAC) was {{established}} at Texas A&M University-Kingsville in November 1993 by the U. S. Department of Energy. The Center is {{managed by the}} University City Science Center, located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. During the period of November, 93 through July, 96 the Center conducted 65 energy audits of small and medium sized manufacturing plants in South Texas. The Center's chief purpose is to serve the energy and waste related needs of small and medium sized manufacturers. The findings were reported to the manufacturers, together with estimates of their savings, implementation costs, and payback periods. By the end of July, 1996, the center had performed 65 industrial survey and had recommended over 388 Energy Conservation Opportunities (ECOs) and 53 Waste Minimization Opportunities (WMOs). During this time, the IAC estimated energy savings totaled 158, 906 MMBtu/year (7. 6 percent of total energy usage) for a total savings of over $ 1. 89 million (9. 3 percent of total energy costs). The waste assessment audits have estimated a total of $ 1. 14 million in <b>waste</b> <b>reductions</b> costs (10. 5 percent of total waste related costs).

25|$|Wetlands {{in general}} are a {{valuable}} resource both economically and environmentally. For instance, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service determined wetlands covered only 5% of the land surface of the contiguous 48 United States, but they support 31% of the nation's plant species. These very biodiverse systems provide resources, shelter, nesting sites, and resting sites (particularly Louisiana’s coastal wetlands such as Grand Isle for migratory birds) to {{a wide array of}} wildlife. Human users also receive many benefits from wetlands, such as cleaner water, storm surge protection, oil and gas resources (especially on the Gulf Coast), reduced flooding, and chemical and biological <b>waste</b> <b>reduction,</b> to name a few. In Louisiana, rapid wetland loss occurs due to a variety of reasons; this state loses an estimated area {{about the size of a}} football field every hour.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the main}} {{programs}} occurring at the University of Ottawa to promote <b>waste</b> <b>reduction</b> is RecycleMania. RecycleMania is a competition among colleges and universities that occurs within a 10-week period of time. Each school is to report their trash and recycling data which are then ranked according to the largest quantity of recyclables. The purpose of this competition is to see who has the highest recycling rate. As results fluctuate among competitors, schools get more enticed to keep reducing waste. In 2011, the University of Ottawa was awarded first place among Canadian universities in the RecycleMania competition. The university also ranked 14th out of 180 universities in the “waste minimization” category in the international RecycleMania competition. The RecycleMania program will continue to encourage and inform University of Ottawa students on how to change their consumption habits as well as recycle.|$|E

30|$|There are {{two types}} of {{undesirable}} environmental outputs: waste gas and wastewater. At the national level, the productive potential rate of waste gas is 0.507, whereas the productive potential rate of wastewater is 0.377. Therefore, over the entire country, waste gas can be reduced by 50.7  % without slowing economic growth, and similarly, wastewater can be reduced by 37.7  %. This result demonstrates that at the aggregate level, a greater potential for progress exists for <b>waste</b> gas <b>reduction</b> than for wastewater treatment. Therefore, the government should invest more resources into <b>waste</b> gas <b>reduction</b> than wastewater treatment.|$|R
