Subjects and methods: Subjects were 36 healthy elderly individuals aged ≥ 65  years without dysphagia (16 men and 20 women; mean age 75. 5  years, range 65 – 88  years). Videofluorographic images during the swallowing of 10  mL of 40 % (w/v) barium sulfate were obtained and the degrees of anterior, superior, and hypotenuse displacements of the hyoid bone and maximum/resting hyoid position were evaluated. Jaw opening force was measured three times using a jaw opening force sthenometer; the mean of these three measurements was used for analysis. Results: In men, there was a positive correlation <b>between</b> <b>jaw</b> opening force and resting hyoid position and negative correlations among all the degrees of anterior, superior, and hypotenuse displacements of the hyoid bone. In women, there was no statistically significant correlation <b>between</b> <b>jaw</b> opening force and any of the measurement items. There was no statistically significant correlation <b>between</b> <b>jaw</b> opening force and maximum hyoid position in either men or women. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that low jaw opening force leads to low resting hyoid position only in elderly men, and a lower hyoid position in healthy elderly men results in a larger total amount of hyoid displacement during swallowing. Moreover, a maximum hyoid position in healthy individuals of either gender does not differ depending on their jaw opening force.

40|$|For {{morphological}} {{characterization of}} the udder of «Merino Beira Baixa» ewes (double aptitude), from centre interior of Portugal, 4 series of measurements were performed with 3 weeks intervals, {{since the beginning of}} milking (57 • 7 days after lambing). We have observed the next parameters: length, width, volume and posterior area of udder; <b>width</b> <b>between</b> teats and their relative positions, the angle between the teats and the vertical axis, length and width of teats; cisternal width. Daily milk production represents about 80 % of the udder volume and the correlation coeficient for these parameters (r= 0. 54), was the highest one founded. Observed coeficient correlation between daily milk production and <b>width</b> <b>between</b> teats was r= 0. 53. All studied variables (morphological characteristics), explain 38, 13 % of milk production variabi¬lity. Udder volume and <b>width</b> <b>between</b> teats explain 37. 99 % of the same variability. Results suggest that udder morphology of «Merino Beira Baixa» ewes is a weak indicator of animal’s milk value...|$|R
