We traveld on for too days, when the men that owned the cattle said they would (could) not drive them another inch. We unyoked the oxen; we had about seventy pounds of flour; we took it out and divided it into four packs. Each of the men took about 18 pounds apiece and a blanket. I carried a little bacon, dried meat, and little quilt; I had in all about twelve pounds. We had one pint of flour a day for our alloyance. Sometimes we made soup of it; {{sometimes}} we (made) pancakes; and sometimes mixed it up with cold water and eat it that way. We traveld twelve or fourteen days. The time came at last when we should have to reach some place or starve. We saw fresh horse and cattle tracks. The morning come, we scraped all the flour out of the sack, mixed it up and baked it into bread, and made some soup, and eat everything we had.

Also a sort of tacit agreement {{seemed to have been}} reached between the patrolmen and the fishermen. If we did not shoot while they ran away, they, in turn, did not fight if we once laid hands on them.

Recent histories of environmental misunderstanding and exploitation shadow our current regime of water management and use. While governments grapple with how to respond to widespread drought, the situation worsens. There is something amiss in current approaches to water.

And lo! in front of the wagons was an army,--at least my boyish mind magnified it to such. Men clad in homespun, perspiring and spattered with mud, were straggling along the road by fours, laughing and joking together. The officers rode, and many of these had blue coats and buff waistcoats,--some the worse for wear. My father was pushing the white mare into the ditch to ride by, when one hailed him.|$|E
60|$|Sure enough, Sounder {{directly}} gave tongue {{from the}} side of the ravine. It was climb for us now. Broken shale, rocks of all dimensions, pinyons down and pinyons up made ascending no easy problem. We had to dismount and lead the horses, thus losing ground. Jones forged ahead and reached the top of the ravine first. When Wallace and I got up, breathing heavily, Jones and the hounds were out of sight. But Sounder kept voicing his clear call, giving us our direction. Off we flew, over ground that was still rough, but enjoyable going compared to the ravine slopes. The ridge was sparsely covered with cedar and pinyon, through which, far ahead, we pretty soon spied Jones. Wallace signaled, and our leader answered twice. <b>We</b> <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> him on the brink of another ravine deeper and craggier than the first, full of dead, gnarled pinyon and splintered rocks.|$|E

[...] "I haven't had a good square meal for days and days, nor a good rest. That is what makes me so dreadfully nervous. Sometimes, when we had been driven {{from place to place}} until <b>we</b> had <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> Jack Frost, there would be nothing but ice {{excepting}} in small places in a river where the water runs too swiftly to freeze. We would just have to drop into one of these to rest a little, because we had flown so far that our wings ached as if they would drop off. Then just as we would think we were safe for a little while, there would come the bang of a terrible gun. Then we would have to fly again as long as we could, and finally come back to the same place because there was no other place where we could go. Then we would have {{to do it all over}} again until night came. Sometimes I think that those men with terrible guns must hate us and want to kill every one of us. If they didn't, they would have a little bit of pity. They simply haven't any hearts at all." ...|$|R

[...] "You see, for one thing, food isn't as plentiful {{as it is in}} the fall, and we just have to go wherever it is to be found. Those two-legged creatures know where those feeding-grounds are just as well as we do, and they hide there with their terrible guns just as they did when we were coming south. But it is much worse now, very much worse. You see, when we were going the other way, if we found them at one place we could go on to another, but when we are going north we cannot always do that. We cannot go any faster than Jack Frost does. Sometimes we are driven out of a place by the bang, bang of the terrible guns and go on, only to find that <b>we</b> have <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> Jack Frost, and that the ponds and the rivers are still covered with ice. Then there is nothing to do but to turn back to where those terrible guns are waiting for us. We just HAVE to do it." ...|$|R
40|$|The {{extent of}} the current Ebolavirus {{outbreak}} in West Africa has belatedly focused the attention of non-governmental organisations, local and Western governments, and international media. What <b>we</b> haven’t <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> though, {{is the extent to}} which these outbreaks and their devastating effects are predictable and preventable. The spread of Ebola virus occurs because health infrastructure in the region is fragmented, under-resourced, or non-existent. And the therapeutic response to the illness is constrained by failure of markets to drive drug and vaccine development that would help the world’s poorest people. Resource constraints This is the largest known Ebola virus outbreak, with more than 1, 800 cases and 1, 000 deaths so far. But the actual number of people affected and mortality rates are uncertain because laboratory diagnosis is limited and only severe cases are admitted to hospitals. Apart from its longevity and extent, what distinguishes this outbreak is that, for the first time, there’s a prospect of drugs and vaccines to treat and prevent the disease. But these important therapeutic milestones don’t alter the fact that the outbreak will not be controlled by drugs. Rather, what’s required is strict infection control and quarantine. Person-to-person spread of Ebola virus, by contact with blood, body fluids or tissues of an infected person (mainly in the late stages of disease or after death) is not particularly difficult to prevent by well-established infection prevention measures that should be routine practice in any modern hospital. Unlike influenza, for instance, Ebola virus doesn’t spread by coughing or during the incubation period. So the current hospital outbreaks are related to inadequate health-care resources rather than a particularly high level of infectiousness...|$|R

Refer page 51 for more details. from the editor’s desk Dear Reader, Economic theories traditionally have assumed that human beings always make ‘rational’ choices. An emerging stream of research, Behavioural Finance, views people as they really are- prone to making decisions based on emotions and gut feeling, than on reason alone. The cover stories in this issue are based on this area of research, which {{is still in its}} early stages of development. They provide some interesting insights into the investment decisions of both individuals and institutions, notwithstanding the contrary perspectives that the subject continues to draw. In ‘Leader Speak’, we feature an interview with entrepreneur and philanthropist, Dr Romesh Wadhwani, who supported the creation of the ISB’s first Centre of Excellence in the area of Entrepreneurship Development. Dr Wadhwani speaks about his journey of wealth creation and distribution, starting from the humble beginnings of a college canteen in IIT Mumbai.

40|$|The Internet is {{here but}} have <b>we</b> <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> all its {{implications}} for culture and everyday life? This collection of original articles {{on the development of}} computer-mediated communications brings together many of the most accomplished writers on the Net and cyberspace. Cultures of Internet examines the arrival of e-mail and online discussion groups, and considers the prospect of an `online world'- a playground for virtual bodies in which identities are flexible, swappable and disconnected from real-world bodies. The book traces the rise of virtual conviviality and how it supplements the physical encounters between actors in public spaces that are abandoned to the homeless. The book is distinguished by a critical and social tone. For the first time, it presents systematic descriptions of the development of the Internet, its history in the military-industrial complex, the role of state policies leading, for example, to the creation of Minitel, and the building of information `superhighways'. It also explores the development of this technology as a commercialized leisure form and a forum for underground political organization and critique. Accessible and lively, the book draws in contributions from Europe, North America and developing countries. It will appeal to students of sociology, cultural studies and computer studies. ...|$|E

Nevertheless, this edition of our column addresses the true importance of bulldogs, marathons, and a few other critical early career variables to boot. In keeping with our usual tradition, we began this issue’s investigation in search of a successful professional who could help academicians and practi-tioners navigate through the initial days of their new careers. Naturally, our compass pointed to Dr. Michael Campion of Purdue University and Cam-pion Services, Inc., who is The Industrial-Organizational Psychologist featured in this column.

40|$|It s {{thanks to}} his travels that he finally meets up with Spore, which he uses a lot on his farm. We first met on a Roman {{hillside}} in Italy, where he was organising farmers encounters during the World Food Summit. A month later, on another hill, in Brussels, Belgium, <b>we</b> <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> him again. He took time out from his course on globalisation to wrap up our interview. He s visibly taken aback at the question: Do you still regard yourself as a young person? 'Sorry to say so, but no. When I {{look at all the}} problems affecting youth today, especially in rural areas, I can t call myself young anymore. I am bound to look at myself as an adult, who can do something for young people. I m an adult because I feel I have to help them. If I thought I was still young myself, then I would have to wait to be an adult, and I don t want to wait. ' Has he always been so impatient? He looks back, with a room-size laugh, at 'when it all started. It was on 28 th November 1990 that I came back home to my village, Torba 1, 138 kilometres east of the capital Yaoundé. I had qualifications under the belt, and I was a parish adviser and leader of small group of just six young people. ' So where does youth stop, or is it eternal? 'As far as MIJARC is concerned, at both national and international levels, it is between the ages of 15 and 35. Of course, it varies from culture to culture. Some of our members may even be in their fifties, but we insist that office-holders are between 15 and 35. ' How about being a farmer, how do you see yourself there? He pounces back, as if being a farmer is eternal. 'Oh yes, not a shadow of doubt. I am a farmer, I shall forever be a farmer, even if I end up doing something else. Right now on my farm, we are harvesting our field of groundnuts. My wife and I have five hectares. ' He looks a tad forlorn about being away from home. 'I m not so sure she copes on her own like that. When I m in the country, I go home every weekend to work with her. And when I m away, I pay for someone to help her, to stand in for me. ' 'I have always been focused on farming. My life-long project is centred on agriculture. Nothing will please me more than if things work out well with my farm; I shall stop all the other things that I do. It s where I can do the most for my family and for others, where I can be sure to raise my family well. And it can serve as a statement for people who follow me. I shall be able to say Listen here, you d be better off trying this seed or that one. The thing is that young people don t know how to choose seeds; they re full of goodwill but a bit short on experience. When I started I didn t have any experience either. That s what I would like to put right. I want to make a practical statement. ' Statements are important to you, right? 'Very. They re what attracts people s attention, especially young kids. We should not be sitting around, not when they are wanting to get on with their lives. They can do a lot, they re full of potential, they need the chance, to build up their confidence. I also want to make a statement to those adults who could be doing something, but aren t, for young people; I want to get them to work too. ' All well and good, but isn t it the case that young people in the village have absolutely no choice but to stay? 'Absolutely, none at all. It s impossible to get a job in town; there s next to no recruitment going on, and, you know, even when a young man has got qualifications, he ll most likely have a wife and children too, so how can you expect him to live in the city? They ll stay at home, in the village. But to survive there, they ll be needing some knowledge. ' So being a farmer is just something you have to do? His eyes flash, we ve touched a raw nerve here. 'Listen, listen good. Being a farmer is a matter of pride, you have to be proud of being a farmer. Some of the kids in the village say that they ended up there by accident. They really wanted a good job in town, or in Europe or America. That s not the attitude to take. The education system has taught them to think like that. We ll only get our pride if we change the content of education. ' 'But there are other barriers too. Top of the list is the traditional one about having access to land. You may have the skills you need but you won t get very far if you haven t got the land The second issue is about being able to invest. As well as skills, you need to have real money to start off with. And then young people don t have any collateral, can t get a guarantee, and so they won t get any loans from the banks. That s really disappointing for them. ' He s gone almost sullen. Let s talk about change, what should be changed? 'We need to have a thorough review of our rural advisory services, and liberalise their management. Then we need to appoint advisors and workers with a specific focus on youth. If we stick to a service full of generalists, we re going to make all sorts of compromises to try to keep everyone happy. At the end of the day, it s the young person who s going to be left to fend for himself. If, on the other hand, we have a focused set-up, we can devote the proper attention to young people, with lots of energy and commitment, and then things will move. ' It sounds rather similar to the positive discrimination towards women that got some things rolling, gender-wise, 20 years ago. 'That s right. We should be talking of women-focused strategies in the same breath as youth-focused ones. We should even bring in child-focused issues. That should be the priority today because it helps to define the world of tomorrow. ' How about CTA, do you see it as a partner for young people? 'Easy. CTA has an important role to play in shaping attitudes, through training, as well as an information task. So it should be joining in those efforts which aim to help young people to better understand agriculture, to love it, and to get into it.
