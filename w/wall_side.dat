40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} {{an investigation of}} facade flame heights from an under-ventilated enclosure fire having an opening with <b>side</b> <b>walls.</b> A reduced-scale model, consisting of a cubic enclosure of 0. 4 m with a vertical facade <b>wall</b> and two <b>side</b> <b>walls</b> was constructed for the experiments. The temperature profile inside the enclosure was measured by thermocouples whereas a CCD camera was employed to obtain the mean flame height of the ejected flames. It is found that the presence or the separation distance of the <b>side</b> <b>walls</b> have {{no impact on the}} critical heat release rate of the enclosure (1500 A √H in kW). The effects of the <b>side</b> <b>walls</b> on the mean flame height are pronounced for a relative larger flame than a small one having the same separation distance of the <b>side</b> <b>walls.</b> In addition as the <b>side</b> <b>wall</b> distance decreases, the effects become larger leading to flame heights much higher than those without sidewalls. A global dimensionless parameter K is proposed to account for the <b>side</b> <b>wall</b> effects, based characteristic length scales of the opening, and the distance between the <b>side</b> <b>walls</b> D. The experimental data for different opening dimensions and <b>side</b> <b>wall</b> distances are well correlated by this global parameter...|$|R

6000|$|Already {{they were}} {{dancing in the}} hall upstairs; but not she, yet; and he stood {{leaning against the wall}} where she must pass. Lonely and out of place he felt; as if {{everyone}} must know why he was there. People stared, and he heard a girl ask: [...] "Who's that against the wall with the hair and dark moustache?"--and her partner murmuring his answer, and her voice again: [...] "Yes, he looks as if he were seeing sand and lions." [...] For whom, then, did they take him? Thank heaven! They were all the usual sort. There would be no one that he knew. Suppose Johnny Dromore himself came with Nell! He was to be back on Saturday! What could he say, then? How meet those doubting, knowing eyes, goggling with the fixed philosophy that a man has but one use for woman? God! and it would be true! For a moment he was on the point of getting his coat and hat, and sneaking away. That would mean not seeing her till Monday; and he stood his ground. But after to-night there must be no more such risks--their meetings must be wisely planned, must sink underground. And then he saw her {{at the foot of the}} stairs in a dress of a shell-pink colour, with one of his flowers in her light-brown hair and the others tied to the handle of a tiny fan. How self-possessed she looked, as if this were indeed her native element--her neck and arms bare, her cheeks a deep soft pink, her eyes quickly turning here and there. She began mounting the stairs, and saw him. Was ever anything so lovely as she looked just then? Behind her he marked Oliver, and a tall girl with red hair, and another young man. He moved deliberately to the top of the stairs on the <b>wall</b> <b>side,</b> so that from behind they should not see her face when she greeted him. She put the little fan with the flowers to her lips; and, holding out her hand, said, quick and low: ...|$|E
60|$|He started down, leading Nagger. The mustang followed. Slone kept to the <b>wall</b> <b>side</b> of the trail, {{fearing the}} horses might slip. The snow held firmly {{at first and}} Slone had no trouble. The gap in the rim-rock widened to a slope thickly grown over with cedars and pinyons and manzanita. This growth made the descent more laborious, yet afforded means at least for Slone to go down with less danger. There was no stopping. Once started, the horses had to keep on. Slone saw the impossibility of ever {{climbing}} out while that snow was there. The trail zigzagged down and down. Very soon the yellow wall hung tremendously over him, straight up. The snow became thinner and softer. The horses began to slip. They slid on their haunches. Fortunately the slope grew less steep, and Slone could see below where it reached out to comparatively level ground. Still, a mishap might yet occur. Slone kept as close to Nagger as possible, helping him whenever he could do it. The mustang slipped, rolled over, and then slipped past Slone, went down the slope to bring up in a cedar. Slone worked down to him and extricated him. Then the huge Nagger began to slide. Snow and loose rock slid with him, and so did Slone. The little avalanche stopped of its own accord, and then Slone dragged Nagger on down and down, presently {{to come to the}} end of the steep descent. Slone looked up to see that he had made short work of a thousand-foot slope. Here cedars and pinyons grew thickly enough to make a forest. The snow thinned out to patches, and then failed. But the going remained bad for a while as the horses sank deep in a soft red earth. This eventually grew more solid and finally dry. Slone worked out of the cedars to what appeared a grassy plateau inclosed by the great green-and-white slope with its yellow wall over hanging, and distant mesas and cliffs. Here his view was restricted. He was down on the first bench of the great canyon. And there was the deer trail, a well-worn path keeping to the edge of the slope. Slone came to a deep cut in the earth, and the trail headed it, where it began at the last descent of the slope. It was the source of a canyon. He could look down to see the bare, worn rock, and a hundred yards from where he stood the earth was washed from its rims and it began to show depth and something of that ragged outline which told of violence of flood. The trail headed many canyons like this, all running down across this bench, disappearing, dropping invisibly. The trail swung to the left under the great slope, and then presently it climbed to a higher bench. Here were brush and grass and huge patches of sage, so pungent that it stung Slone's nostrils. Then he went down again, this time to come to a clear brook lined by willows. Here the horses drank long and Slone refreshed himself. The sun had grown hot. There was fragrance of flowers he could not see and a low murmur of a waterfall that was likewise invisible. For most of the time his view was shut off, but occasionally he reached a point where through some break he saw towers gleaming red in the sun. A strange place, a place of silence, and smoky veils in the distance. Time passed swiftly. Toward the waning of the afternoon he began to climb to what appeared to be a saddle of land, connecting the canyon wall on the left with a great plateau, gold-rimmed and pine-fringed, rising more and more in his way as he advanced. At sunset Slone was more shut in than for several hours. He could tell the time was sunset by the golden light on the cliff wall again overhanging him. The slope was gradual up to this pass to the saddle, and upon coming to a spring, and the first pine-trees, he decided to halt for a camp. The mustang was almost exhausted.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an investigation of}} the <b>side</b> <b>wall</b> effects on facade flames ejected from the opening (such as a window) of an under-ventilated room fire. Experiments are carried out in a reduced-scale experimental setup, consisting of a cubic fire compartment having an opening with a vertical facade <b>wall</b> and two <b>side</b> <b>walls</b> normal to the façade wall. By changing the distance of the two <b>side</b> <b>walls,</b> the facade flame heights for different opening conditions (width, height) are recorded by a CCD camera. It is found that as the distance of the two <b>side</b> <b>walls</b> decreases the behavior the flame height can be distinguished into two regimes characterized by the dimensionless excess heat release rate, skew 5 dotQ_ex^ast See Formula in PDF, outside the opening: (a) for the “wall fire” (skew 5 dotQ_ex^ast See Formula in PDF ≤ 1. 3), the flame height is shown to change little with decrease of <b>side</b> <b>wall</b> distance as the dominant entrainment is from the front direction (normal to the facade wall) independent of the <b>side</b> <b>wall</b> distances; (b) for the “axis-symmetrical fire” (5 dotQ_ex^ast > 1. 3), the flame height increases significantly with a decrease in <b>side</b> <b>wall</b> distance as both the entrainment from the two side directions (parallel to the facade wall) and that from the front direction (normal to the facade wall) together apply. A global physically based non-dimensional factor K is then brought forward based on the <b>side</b> <b>wall</b> constraint effect on the facade flame entrainment to characterize the <b>side</b> <b>wall</b> effect on the flame height, by accounting for the dimensionless excess heat release rate, the characteristic length scales of the opening as well as the <b>side</b> <b>wall</b> separation distance. The experimental data for different opening dimensions and <b>side</b> <b>wall</b> distances collapse by using this global non-dimensional factor...|$|R
