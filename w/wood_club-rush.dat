Over 70 aquatic and bankside vascular plants have been recorded including frogbit (Hydrocharis morsus-ranae), flowering rush (Butomus umbellatus), <b>wood</b> <b>club-rush</b> (Scirpus sylvaticus) and lesser water-plantain (Baldellia ranunculoides). Over 100 species of aquatic invertebrates inhabit the ditches including one nationally rare soldier fly, (Odontomyia ornata) and 13 nationally scarce species including the water beetles Agabus uliginosus, Hydaticus transversalis and Helophorus nanus. In winter the flooded fields provide food for large numbers of waterfowl with several thousand lapwing (Vanellus vanellus), hundreds of snipe (Gallinago gallinago) and smaller numbers of golden plover (Pluvialis apricaria) and dunlin (Calidris alpina) regularly present. Over two hundred Bewick's swans (Cygnus bewickii) have been recorded, making the site an internationally important wintering ground for this species. Raptor species such as short-eared owl (Asio flammeus), merlin (Falco columbarius) and peregrine (Falco peregrinus) regularly hunt over the site in winter. Vertebrate species present include grass snake (Natrix natrix) and common frog Rana temporaria. Otters (Lutra lutra) are regularly recorded on the site.|$|E

50|$|The area is {{surrounded}} with woods consisting mainly of spruces, which are replaced with mountain pines towards the centre. The meadows are very rich in species of various plants. Among {{the most common}} ones there are horsetails, <b>wood</b> <b>club-rush,</b> Cirsium rivulare and meadowsweet. There are {{also a lot of}} rare species, such as few-flower sedge, fibrous tussock-sedge, flea sedge, tufted loosestrife or Gladiolus imbricatus.|$|E
50|$|Aquatic plants {{includes}} reed, club-rush, <b>wood</b> <b>club-rush,</b> broadleaf cattail, flowering rush, water hemlock, yellow iris, yellow loosestrife, bittersweet, yellow water-lily, white water-lily, broad-leaved pondweed, red pondweed, whorled water-milfoil, amphibious bistort, water-soldier, frogbit, duckweed, greater bladderwort, {{and greater}} duckweed. Along {{the shores of}} the lake are hybrid crack willow, alder, bay willow, grey willow, aspen, ash, purple-loosestrife, marsh fern, wild angelica, marsh woundwort, gypsywort, creeping spearwort, marsh cinquefoil, marsh-marigold, bittersweet, skullcap, corn mint, meadowsweet, trifid bur-marigold, and purple small-reed.|$|E
50|$|The {{vegetation}} {{is mainly}} of {{a mosaic of}} yellow iris Iris pseudacorus, branched bur-reed Sparganium erectum and rushes Juncus spp., while greater tussock-sedge Carex paniculata is locally dominant. Other conspicuous plants include meadowsweet Filipendula ulmaria, marsh-marigold Caltha palustris, ragged robin Lychnis flos-cuculi, watermint Mentha aquatica and southern marsh-orchid Dactylorhiza praetermissa. Also present are four species which are local in Devon: <b>wood</b> <b>club-rush</b> Scirpus sylvaticus, marsh valerian Valeriana dioica, fen bedstraw Galium uliginosum and common spike-rush Eleocharis palustris. The stream is bordered {{for most of its}} length by alder Alnus glutinosa, with a ground flora dominated by ramsons Allium ursinum.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{performed}} {{research was}} to obtain knowledge {{on the ability of}} aquatic plants naturally growing at a site to absorb trace metals contained in bottom sediments and surface water. Furthermore, we compared differences in the accumulation of trace metals by the individual groups of aquatic plants (submerged and emergent) and assessed a possible use of the individual plant species in phytoremediation techniques. Representative samples of water, sediments and aquatic macrophytes were taken from three anthropogenically loaded streams in six monitoring cycles in several collection profiles differing in the distance from a source of contamination. The samples were analysed for the total content of selected trace metals (As, Cd, Pb, Al, Hg, Zn, Fe, Mn, Cr, Ni and Cu). For comparison, one profile at an unloaded site was sampled as well. The obtained results were subjected to multivariate statistical analysis of data. Increased contents of Fe, Al, Mn, Cr and Zn were detected in sediments and plant biomass at loaded sites, namely 2 – 3 × higher than at the comparing site. The contents of metals in surface water samples were altogether below the detection limit of the analytical method. When evaluating the individual plant species, we can state that the lowest contents of metals were detected in shore species (reed canary grass Phalaroides arundinacea, <b>wood</b> <b>club-rush</b> Scirpus silvaticus and red dock Rumex aquaticus); plant species growing in the very water current (water star-wort Callitriche sp. and flote-grass Glyceria fluitans) exhibited mean contents of metals. In species forming mats (Fontinalis antipyretica and Cladophora sp.), these contents were several times higher as compared to the previous species. The results of the performed research show that one of important factors, which influence the accumulation of trace metals in plants, is their ecological group (emergent – submerged) affiliation and the species classification within this group. Based on the evaluated data, we can recommend species of moss and algae that form mats eventually species growing in the very water flow for the future use in phytoremediation techniques...|$|E
