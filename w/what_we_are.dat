[...] Morrisett was frustrated because while the experiments were effective, they reached {{only a few hundred}} disadvantaged students. He wanted to reach millions.|$|R
5000|$|Yeah, that's <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> {{trying to}} go for there, {{and then with the}} bridge, bring it up, like the sun is rising, like we're coming out of the dark, that <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> going for when {{recording}} that.

25|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} God created {{the world with}} ten Divine utterances. Noting that surely God could have created the world with one utterance, the Mishnah asks <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> meant to learn from this, replying, if God had created the world by a single utterance, men would think less of the world, and have less compunction about undoing God's creation.|$|E
25|$|Civil rights: Badnarik {{supports}} {{all of the}} Bill of Rights unequivocally, {{a position}} which he claims contrasts with most political candidates. Badnarik says government does not grant rights but rather acknowledges them, that they exist independently of government as part of who and <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>are,</b> and that, as Thomas Jefferson noted in the United States Declaration of Independence, the only legitimate function of government is to secure them.|$|E
25|$|In 1983, Noel Tichy {{wrote that}} because we are all beings of habit we tend to repeat <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> {{comfortable}} with. He wrote {{that this is a}} trap that constrains our creativity, prevents us from exploring new ideas, and hampers our dealing with the full complexity of new issues. He developed a systematic method of dealing with change that involved looking at any new issue from three angles: technical and production, political and resource allocation, and corporate culture.|$|E

25|$|This {{series of}} {{evaluations}} is providing {{a mechanism to}} characterize in more precise terms exactly {{what is necessary to}} compute in meaning. As such, the evaluations provide an emergent mechanism to identify the problems and solutions for computations with meaning. These exercises have evolved to articulate more of the dimensions that are involved in our use of language. They began with apparently simple attempts to identify word senses computationally. They have evolved to investigate the interrelationships among the elements in a sentence (e.g., semantic role labeling), relations between sentences (e.g., coreference), and the nature of <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> saying (semantic relations and sentiment analysis).|$|E
25|$|The {{second point}} of {{contention}} between freewill and open theists is exhaustive definite foreknowledge of future contingent events. Freewill theists have traditionally affirmed {{what is known as}} simple foreknowledge according to which God, prior to creation, just “sees” or knows all that will ever happen in history. Sanders argues that the simple foreknowledge view has conflicts with types of biblical texts mentioned below and has two philosophical problems. The first problem is the old debate about whether or not divine foreknowledge entails determinism. Open theists argue that exhaustive definite foreknowledge is incompatible with the freewill of creatures. The other problem with simple foreknowledge is that it is useless for God to possess it since once God knows {{what is going to happen}} God cannot change it from happening. Sanders argues that simple foreknowledge cannot explain such things as prophecy, divine guidance, or why God did not prevent particular evils. Instead, open theists affirm “dynamic omniscience” (a term coined by Sanders). God knows all that has happened in the past and all that is happening in the present. God knows those future events that are determined to occur and God knows all that could possibly happen but does not know as definite what creatures with freewill will do. God has anticipatory knowledge (foresight) of <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> likely to do so God is not caught off-guard.|$|E
25|$|The common {{heritage}} of humanity principle in international law has been viewed as one solution to {{the tragedy of the}} commons dilemma described in an influential article by that name written by Garrett Hardin in the journal Science in 1968. The article critically analyzes a dilemma in which multiple individuals, acting independently after rationally consulting self-interest, ultimately destroy a shared limited resource even when each acknowledges that outcome is not in anyone's long-term interest. Hardin's conclusion that commons areas are practicably achievable only in conditions of low population density and so their continuance requires state restriction on the freedom to breed, created controversy particularly through his deprecation of the role of conscience in achieving justice and equality in society. Hardin's views have been noted by scholars and policy-makers supporting privatization of common spaces and suggesting economic rationalism on such social and ecosystems. Though there are many that point out that as <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> seeking is a social contract, privatisation would actually annihilate any possibility of rational use - the land would simply be in enclosure. Hardin's views are based on malthusian ideas of competition and over population, we have now accepted that it is the nature of man's consumption (not his numbers) that is causing the destruction of the environment. Hardin, like many who criticise principles of commonality, have to rely on long debunked 18th century ideas to make their point.|$|E

5000|$|I {{pointed out}} that it was in the best {{interests}} of the City to have us in Lincoln Park ten miles away from the Convention hall. I said we had no intention of marching on the Convention hall, that I didn't particularly think that politics in America could be changed by marches and rallies, that <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> presenting was an alternative life style, and we hoped that people of Chicago would come up, and mingle in Lincoln Park and see <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> about.

500|$|Observation: {{the facts}} (<b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> seeing, hearing, or touching) as {{distinct}} from our evaluation of meaning and significance. NVC discourages static generalizations. It is said that [...] "When we combine observation with evaluation others are apt to hear criticism and resist <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> saying." [...] Instead, a focus on observations specific to time and context is recommended.|$|E
500|$|Finally, Duerr {{once again}} criticises the {{approach}} of Western society and its anthropologists to studying [...] "archaic" [...] spiritual beliefs. He asserts that in these [...] "archaic" [...] cultures, people [...] "have a much clearer idea {{about the fact that}} we can not be only <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> if at the same time, we are also <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> not, and that we can only know who we are if we experience our boundaries". He denounces Western scientists and anthropologists for their approaches to the study of such cultures, arguing that they have misrepresented them by attempting to fit them within the Western ideas of objectivity. He argues that in future, anthropologists must reach their own boundaries, and recognize the wilderness of their consciousness before they can truly understand the worldview of [...] "archaic" [...] humans.|$|E
500|$|Du Fu's {{political}} {{comments are}} based on emotion rather than calculation: his prescriptions have been paraphrased as, [...] "Let us all be less selfish, let us all do <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> supposed to do". Since his views were impossible to disagree with, his forcefully expressed truisms enabled his installation as the central figure of Chinese poetic history.|$|E

500|$|Astronomers {{sometimes}} use {{the alternative}} name Edgeworth–Kuiper belt to credit Edgeworth, and KBOs are occasionally {{referred to as}} EKOs. Brian G. Marsden claims that neither deserves true credit: [...] "Neither Edgeworth nor Kuiper wrote about anything remotely like <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> now seeing, but Fred Whipple did". David Jewitt comments: [...] "If anything... Fernández most nearly deserves the credit for predicting the Kuiper Belt." ...|$|E
500|$|Asked in May 2014 if Aerosmith {{will release}} a sixteenth studio album anytime soon, bassist Tom Hamilton replied, [...] "I hope soon. But I really don't know <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> doing because {{we no longer}} have a record contract. We are {{finished}} with Columbia. So, there is nothing written in stone. We'll see what the fans want." [...] In an interview with Rolling Stone about what the future holds, Joe Perry admitted that, [...] "I don't even know if making new albums makes sense anymore. Maybe we'll just release an EP every six months. I don't know what the future looks like." ...|$|E
500|$|Regarding the {{inspiration}} behind the remix, Hayden Thorpe from Wild Beasts group told The Guardian: [...] "The unlikeness of this match was perhaps what compelled {{us to take}} it on. Gaga in many ways {{is the epitome of}} <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> not. She is the butcher to our butter knife. The essential thrill is always to keep eluding what is expected of us and what we expect of ourselves." [...] The last of the remix to be released was The Weeknd's take on [...] "Marry the Night" [...] which featured Illangelo, thus earning him a co-producer credit on it.|$|E

500|$|Koppelman was {{an early}} student of Aesthetic Realism, the {{philosophy}} founded in 1941 by Eli Siegel, {{which is based on}} the principle, [...] "All beauty is a making one of opposites, and the making one of opposites is <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> going after in ourselves". This principle informed Koppelman's art, teaching, and his work as an Aesthetic Realism consultant. About the importance of this principle to art and life, Koppelman stated, [...] "When Eli Siegel showed that what makes a work of art beautiful [...] the oneness of opposites [...] is the same as what every individual wants, {{it was one of the}} mightiest and kindest achievements of man's mind".|$|E
500|$|Having {{spent the}} {{previous}} week in London, Reedman flew into Lisbon Portela Airport on 15 September 1965. He was met there by the Portuguese Foreign Ministry's assistant chief of protocol, Luis Quartim Bastos, and three Rhodesian officials, who had arrived a fortnight before. Nobody from the British Embassy was present. Bastos told a reporter {{that he was at}} the airport on Nogueira's behalf to accord Reedman [...] "the classic welcome for the arrival of heads of mission". Speaking the next day, Reedman appeared genial and optimistic. [...] "We [...] have everything in common," [...] he said, [...] "including the will for survival, an awareness of the true situation overseas, and a greater feeling towards <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> doing." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{book was}} a New York Times Best Seller and was praised by critics. Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote that it [...] "eviscerates a basic assumption: that slavery in America ended with the Civil War." [...] She praised the book's {{evidence}} as [...] "relentless and fascinating," [...] although she thought that the conceit of reconstructing Cottenham's life gives the book [...] "a shaky start". Leonard Pitts, {{a columnist for the}} Miami Herald, wrote that [...] "Slavery by Another Name is an astonishing book. It will challenge and change your understanding of what we were as Americans - and of <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>are.</b> I cannot recommend it to you highly enough." ...|$|E

5000|$|... "I {{think the}} fall in bank lending would have <b>been</b> worse had <b>we</b> not {{conducted}} our asset purchases because <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> doing was injecting money into the economy and what the banking system has been doing is destroying money. As they {{reduce the size of}} their balance sheet and deleverage, they are reducing not just the size of their assets but the size of their liabilities. Most of the money in our economy—broad money—comprises liabilities of banks in the form of bank deposits. So <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> doing was partially to offset what would otherwise have been an even bigger contraction." ...|$|R
