2500|$|... "I...recall {{seeing an}} {{airplane}} flight {{made by the}} late Gustave Whitehead approximately thirty-five years ago. I was a boy at the time, playing on a lot near the Whitehead shop on Cherry Street, and recall the incident well as <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>surprised</b> to see the plane leave the ground. It traveled a distance of approximately three hundred feet, and at a height of approximately fifteen feet in the air, {{to the best of}} my recollection." ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>surprised</b> to see {{it become}} as big--I mean, the story became way bigger than our part in it. Or it wasn't really about our record. It was just about that circumstance. For us, none {{of us have a}} real strong {{position}} against people sharing music. I mean, I think that's fine. We didn't feel like we were getting ripped off or anything. Everything else related to it, between that writer and his boss..... Whatever else happened, I feel like we're out of it.|$|E
2500|$|In {{light of}} the {{negative}} response {{and the need to}} quickly decide a new selection process, NDR withdrew its proposal to send Naidoo on 21 November. ARD co-ordinator Thomas Schreiber stated that [...] "Xavier Naidoo is a brilliant singer who is, according to my own opinion, neither racist nor homophobe. It was clear that his nomination would polarise opinions, but <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>surprised</b> about the negative response. The Eurovision Song Contest is a fun event, in which music and the understanding between European people should be the focus. This characteristic must be kept at all costs." ...|$|E
60|$|Need <b>we</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised,</b> reader, {{that our}} hero {{on that night}} dreamed the golden dream over again, with many {{wonderful}} additions, and sundry remarkable variations.|$|R
60|$|If {{we look at}} a map of {{the world}} <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>surprised</b> to see how big Australia is. It is about two-thirds as large as the United States <b>was</b> before <b>we</b> added Alaska.|$|R
6000|$|Moor. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>surprised,</b> away! away! the instant-- [...] The {{country is}} in arms. The old man heads them [...] And still cries out, 'My son! My son is living' [...] Haste to the shore! They come the {{opposite}} road.|$|R
2500|$|Car and Driver {{recorded}} 6.8second 0-60 {{times in}} both L-48 and L-82 4-speed equipped 1976 Corvettes. The magazine ordered an L-48 4-speed for a [...] road trip to Alaska. C summarized: [...] "The Corvette {{was a big}} hit–we expected and thoroughly enjoyed that–but <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>surprised</b> at how well it withstood the ordeal...once we recovered from the trip we conceded that we'd developed new respect for a car we'd long regarded {{as something of a}} put on. In every sense of the word, our Yukon Corvette proved to be tough and we'd have to say that even the production versions impressed us as coming closer to being real touring cars than we might ever have thought. There's a lot more sincere ring now to our stock answer to the question, Why a Corvette?" ...|$|E
2500|$|One {{observer}} claimed [...] "Despite her 'wardrobe malfunction' – {{for which}} we think Justin Timberlake wasn't punished nearly as severely for – Janet put on a pretty amazing show." [...] The New York Times noted [...] "fter her right breast upstaged the Super Bowl, she was criticized by the first lady, vilified by media executives and abandoned by her co-conspirator, Justin Timberlake; less excitable commentators suggested she was merely a shrewd publicity-stunt woman with a new album to promote." [...] Jackson's parents, Joe and Katherine Jackson, also expressed concern that Timberlake did not stand by Janet following the incident, commenting, [...] "What I didn't like is there wasn't one person on that stage, there were two people. After a while, there was only Janet Jackson. That's all there was. Janet Jackson," [...] adding [...] "Janet don't pull that thing open herself. He did it. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>surprised</b> that they didn't say anything to Justin about it." ...|$|E
60|$|D. Arcos. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>surprised</b> when {{least we}} did suspect, And justly {{suffered}} {{by our own}} neglect.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why the dickens should <b>we</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised,</b> Colonel?" [...] said Desborough; [...] "we {{know his}} Excellency, my {{brother-in-law}} Noll's--I mean my Lord Cromwell's way, of overquartering his {{men in the}} towns he marches through. Thou hast obtained a share in our commission?" ...|$|R
2500|$|M'Quarrie's house <b>was</b> mean; but <b>we</b> <b>were</b> agreeably <b>surprised</b> {{with the}} ...|$|R
50|$|<b>We</b> <b>were</b> not <b>surprised</b> (by {{the fact}} that he came late).|$|R
60|$|The {{next morning}} <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>surprised</b> to feel how warm {{it was on}} deck. We didn't need our overcoats. The sea was ever so much smoother, too. There were two or three ladies on deck, who could walk pretty well.|$|E
60|$|It suited me to a “T” too, and Harris and I {{both said}} {{it was a good idea}} of George’s; and we said it in a tone that seemed to somehow imply that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>surprised</b> that George should have come out so sensible.|$|E
6000|$|I {{must say}} <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>surprised</b> when we opened those parcels. [...] "We {{had known that}} Aunt Jean's gifts would be nice, but we had not {{expected}} anything like this. There was a magnificent stone marten collar, a dear little gold watch and pearl chatelaine, and a gold chain bracelet set with turquoises.|$|E
6000|$|Moor. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>surprised!</b> away! away! this instant! [...] The {{country is}} in arms! Lord Valdez heads them, [...] And still cries out, 'My son! my Alvar lives!' [...] Haste to the shore! they come the {{opposite}} road. [...] Your wives and children are already safe. [...] The boat is on the shore--the vessel waits.|$|R
2500|$|So <b>we</b> <b>were</b> greatly <b>surprised</b> when, at the preview, the {{explosion}} took place. (Albert Gleizes) ...|$|R
5000|$|... "These {{appear to}} be old, scurrilous rumors which Sheik Khalid has made on {{numerous}} occasions," [...] {{a spokesman for the}} UAE said in a statement. [...] "His claims are baseless and without foundation and should be seen in the context of his long-standing dispute with his family. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>surprised</b> that these old allegations are now being rehashed once again." ...|$|R
60|$|While the waif was commenting thus enthusiastically on the bliss of lodging in a sugar-barrel, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>surprised</b> to see Dumps, who chanced to be {{trotting}} on {{in front}} {{come to a}} sudden pause and gaze at a lady {{who was in the}} act of ringing the door-bell of an adjoining house.|$|E
60|$|This sign hung triumphantly {{for several}} days, when one morning, {{just as we}} had {{finished}} breakfast, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>surprised</b> to hear the stage stop at the door, and before {{we could go out}} to see who had arrived, into the room came our own stage-driver, as we used to call him. He had actually left his team to come and see us.|$|E
60|$|We {{arrived at}} Meadowville {{early in the}} afternoon, and when our party alighted from the train <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>surprised</b> not to see Mr. Enderton on the {{platform}} of the little station. Instead of him, there stood three persons whose appearance amazed and delighted us. They were the red-bearded coxswain and the two sailor men, all in neat new clothes and with their hands raised in maritime salute.|$|E
40|$|A {{quite common}} {{perception}} {{about women and}} property is that women do not have much, at least by comparison to men. Even if women do have property formally in their names, men {{seem to be the}} ones who initially acquired it and actually control it. Though there are exceptions—even whole societies that are exceptional—they have a rather exotic air. In the ordinary course of things, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>surprised</b> to find women of great wealth, just as <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>surprised</b> to find women who lead Fortune 500 companies. On the other hand, it is hardly news that women are disproportionately represented as heads of household among the poor. Between these extremes of wealth and poverty, women just {{do not seem to be}} as 2 ̆ 2 propertied 2 ̆ 2 as men, except insofar as they happen to be located in families headed by men. Indeed, even within the household, the serious money often seems to be at the disposal of the husband, not the wife...|$|R
6000|$|... "Might have a mate around," [...] {{suggested}} John Barrow. [...] "We {{had better}} keep our eyes peeled, or <b>we</b> may <b>be</b> <b>surprised.</b> Wonder {{what time it}} is?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Don't let her fancy that. <b>We</b> {{certainly}} <b>were</b> <b>surprised</b> into it to- night; but I {{only wish}} for her sake--for all your sakes--that you {{could keep the}} house merrier.' ...|$|R
60|$|It was the dreariest scenery imaginable. The only animals {{which we}} saw on the sand at that time were spiders, which {{are to be found}} almost {{everywhere}} whether on snow or ice-water or sand,--and a venomous-looking, long, narrow worm, one of the myriapods, or thousand-legs. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>surprised</b> to see spider-holes in that flowing sand with an edge as firm as that of a stoned well.|$|E
60|$|The Indian {{mound of}} the {{previous}} night's discovery was a bearing monument of the new line, and there we halted. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>surprised</b> to find the old man Tryan waiting us. For the first time during our interview the old Spaniard seemed moved, and the blood rose in his yellow cheek. I was anxious to close the scene, and pointed out the corner boundaries as clearly as my recollection served.|$|E
6000|$|The {{visitors}} {{took their}} leave, {{and the two}} sisters began exclaiming--Ethel at their dislike of her proteges, and Flora at what they had said of Norman. [...] "And you, Ethel, how could you go and tell them <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>surprised,</b> and Norman thought it was hard on the other boys? They'll have {{it all over the}} town that he got it unjustly, and knows it, as they say already it was partiality of Mr. Everard's." ...|$|E
5000|$|Many Nazis were astounded at {{the number}} of Polish {{children}} found to exhibit [...] "Nordic" [...] traits, but assumed that all such children were genuinely German children, who had been Polonized; Hans Frank summoned up such views when he declared, [...] "When we see a blue-eyed child <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>surprised</b> that she <b>is</b> speaking Polish." [...] Among those children thought to be genuinely German were children whose parents had been executed for resisting Germanization.|$|R
60|$|Look at all {{the things}} they can learn to do. Read with their fingers. Tune pianos. Or <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>surprised</b> they have any brains. Why we think a {{deformed}} person or a hunchback clever if he says something we might say. Of course the other senses are more. Embroider. Plait baskets. People ought to help. Workbasket I could buy for Molly's birthday. Hates sewing. Might take an objection. Dark men they call them.|$|R
60|$|Nightmares {{which have}} purely {{mechanical}} images may terrify us, {{give us a}} great shock, but the shock does not enter our souls. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>surprised,</b> in the morning, {{to find that the}} bristling horror of the night seems now just nothing--dwindled to nothing. And this is because what was a purely material obstruction in the physical flow, temporary only, is indeed a nothingness to the living, integral soul. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> subject to such accidents--if we will eat pancakes for supper. And that is the end of it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Three {{days ago}} we were {{attacked}} {{and your father}} and Mr. Mallory taken prisoners. The rest of us escaped, and endeavored to make {{our way back to}} the marines, but we became confused and have been wandering aimlessly about the island ever since until <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>surprised</b> by these natives a few moments ago. Both the seamen were killed in this last fight and Mr. Foster and myself taken prisoners--the rest you know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am {{what you}} all are, and live {{as you all}} do,' said the man sternly, after a short silence. 'I am in hiding here like the rest, and if <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>surprised</b> would perhaps do my part {{with the best of}} ye. If it's my humour to be left to myself, let me have it. Otherwise,'--and here he swore a {{tremendous}} oath--'there'll be mischief done in this place, though there ARE odds of a score against me.' ...|$|E
60|$|Thus, {{we came to}} the village. The way {{by which}} we {{approached}} it took us past the Three Jolly Bargemen, which <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>surprised</b> to find--it being eleven o'clock--in a state of commotion, with the door wide open, and unwonted lights that had been hastily caught up and put down scattered about. Mr. Wopsle dropped in to ask what was the matter (surmising that a convict had been taken), but came running out in a great hurry.|$|E
50|$|Nor should <b>we</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> that an unchristian {{majority}} would reserve an honored {{place for}} untruth in its civil religion. A Hindu invocation {{is only an}} extreme version of this habit. Other forms of civil religion routinely are calculated to be inoffensive to those who deny Christ....Polite universalism is America's civil religion, {{and it is an}} absolute enemy of the gospel. It assumes that those who are not in Christ are on good terms with God—a lie, according to the Bible.|$|R
5000|$|Lens 2: Our learners' eyes. Seeing {{ourselves}} through learners' eyes, we may {{discover that}} learners are interpreting our {{actions in the}} way that we mean them. But often <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>surprised</b> by the diversity of meanings people read into our words and actions. A cardinal principle of seeing ourselves through learners' eyes is that of ensuring the anonymity of their critical opinions. We have to make learners feel safe. Seeing our practice through learners' eyes helps us teach more responsively.|$|R
6000|$|Hook trod {{the deck}} in thought. O man unfathomable. It was his hour of triumph. Peter {{had been removed}} for ever from his path, {{and all the other}} boys were in the brig, about to walk the plank. It was his grimmest deed since the days when he had brought Barbecue to heel; and knowing as we do how vain a {{tabernacle}} <b>is</b> man, could <b>we</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> had he now paced the deck unsteadily, bellied out by the winds of his success? ...|$|R
