40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{multi-stage}} down-draft evaporative cool tower (DECT) {{was developed}} as an improvement to an existing single-stage design. The new tower incorporates a secondary air inlet, added {{to increase the}} cooling output and reduce the water consumption in a tower of given cross-section and primary inlet geometry. The secondary air, which may {{be drawn from the}} interior space being cooled, is cooled by evaporation in the lower section of the tower.

"Water spray" [...] {{systems are}} operationally {{identical}} to a deluge system, but the piping and discharge nozzle spray patterns {{are designed to}} protect a uniquely configured hazard, usually being three-dimensional components or equipment (i.e. {{as opposed to a}} deluge system, which is designed to cover the horizontal floor area of a room). The nozzles used may not be listed fire sprinklers, and are usually selected for a specific spray pattern to conform to the three-dimensional nature of the hazard (e.g. typical spray patterns being oval, fan, full circle, narrow jet). Examples of hazards protected by <b>water</b> <b>spray</b> <b>systems</b> are electrical transformers containing oil for cooling or turbo-generator bearings. <b>Water</b> <b>spray</b> <b>systems</b> can also be used externally on the surfaces of tanks containing flammable liquids or gases (such as hydrogen).

40|$|The {{water spray}} systems in high {{efficiency}} particulate air (HEPA) filter plenums {{that are used}} in nearly all Department of Energy (DOE) facilities for protection against fire was designed under the assumption that the HEPA filters would not be damaged by the water sprays. The most likely scenario for filter damage involves filter plugging by the water spray, followed by the fan blowing out the filter medium. A number of controlled laboratory tests that were previously conducted in the late 1980 s are reviewed in this paper to provide a technical basis for the potential HEPA filter damage by the <b>water</b> <b>spray</b> <b>system</b> in HEPA filter plenums. In addition to the laboratory tests, the scenario for HEPA filter damage during fires has also occurred in the field. Afire in a four-stage, HEPA filter plenum at Rocky Flats in 1980 caused the first three stages of HEPA filters to blow out of their housing and the fourth stage to severely bow. Details of this recently declassified fire are presented in this paper. Although these previous findings suggest serious potential problems exist with the current <b>water</b> <b>spray</b> <b>system</b> in filter plenum, additional studies are required to confirm unequivocally that DOE`s critical facilities are at risk...|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} water spray and crosswind {{on the effectiveness of}} the natural draft dry cooling tower (NDDCT), a three-dimensional model has been developed. Efficiency of NDDCT is improved by <b>water</b> <b>spray</b> <b>system</b> at the cooling tower entrance for high ambient temperature condition with and without crosswind. The natural and forced heat convection flow inside and around the NDDCT is simulated numerically by solving the full Navier-Stokes equations in both air and water droplet phases. Comparison of the numerical results with one-dimensional analytical model and the experimental data illustrates a well-predicted heat transfer rate in the cooling tower. Applying <b>water</b> <b>spray</b> <b>system</b> on the cooling tower radiators enhances the cooling tower efficiency at both no wind and windy conditions. For all values of water spraying rate, NDDCTs operate most effectively at the crosswind velocity of 3 m/s and as the wind speed continues to rise to more than 3 m/s up to 12 m/s, the tower efficiency will decrease by approximately 18 %, based on no-wind condition. The heat transfer rate of radiator at wind velocity 10 m/s is 11. 5 % lower than that of the no wind condition. This value is 7. 5 % for water spray rate of 50 kg/s...|$|E

The walls and the ceiling were constructed from steel plates. The test compartment replicates an intermediate size machinery space compartment onboard a ship. Either diesel oil or heptane pool fires were used as the fire source. The fires had nominal heat release rates of 500 kW, 1 MW and 2 MW, respectively and were either fully exposed to the water spray or completely shielded by a horizontal obstruction steel plate measuring 2 m by 2 m.

Heat Release Rate calorimetry is usually the best method to measure the effectiveness of a water spray or mist system, although not all fire laboratories have access to such equipment. Therefore, {{there is a need to}} explore if other traditional measurement techniques can be used. Such methods include thermocouples, heat flux gages and Plate Thermometers.

40|$|Evaporative cooling {{by water}} spray is {{increasingly}} {{used as an}} efficient and environmentally-friendly approach to enhance thermal comfort in built environments. The complex two-phase flow in a <b>water</b> <b>spray</b> <b>system</b> is influenced by many factors such as continuous phase velocity, temperature and relative humidity patterns, droplet characteristics and continuous phase-droplet and droplet-droplet interactions. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) can be a valuable tool for assessing the potential and performance of evaporative cooling by water spray systems in outdoor and indoor urban environments. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of the Lagrangian-Eulerian approach for evaporative cooling provided {{by the use of}} a <b>water</b> <b>spray</b> <b>system</b> with a hollow-cone nozzle configuration. The evaluation is based on grid-sensitivity analysis and validated using wind-tunnel measurements. This paper also presents a sensitivity analysis focused on the impact of the turbulence model for the continuous phase, the drag coefficient model, the number of particle streams for the discrete phase and the nozzle spray angle. The results show that CFD simulation of evaporation by the Lagrangian- Eulerian (3 D steady RANS) approach, in spite of its limitations, can accurately predict the evaporation process, with local deviations from the wind-tunnel measurements within 10 % for dry bulb temperature, 5 % for wet bulb temperature and 7 % for the specific enthalpy. The average deviations for all three variables are less than 3 % in absolute values. The results of this paper are intended to support future CFD studies of evaporative cooling by water spray systems in outdoor and indoor urban environments. status: publishe...|$|E
