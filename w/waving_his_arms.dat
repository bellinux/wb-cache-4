5|$|Blythe, who is nearsighted, {{took off}} his glasses before {{entering}} the stage, which together with the smoke and light effects allegedly left him half-blind. Blythe said that people could easily reach the band members or climb up to the stage. One of the fans, who was identified as Milan Pořádek by Czech newspapers, and who was scheduled to testify later during the proceedings, managed to climb the stage twice without being stopped by security. Blythe testified that during the first attempt, Pořádek rushed the stage and started <b>waving</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> before stage diving. The second time, he tried to {{put his arms around}} Blythe in an attempt to hug him. Blythe, who according to his own words perceived this as a danger, caught Pořádek's collar, pushed him on the ground, knelt on him and repeatedly told him to stop. He then led the fan by his hair {{to the edge of the}} stage, where the fan jumped off. It was only after watching a video of the incident that Blythe found out that a security officer was actually pushing the fan from back. Blythe further said that he saw Pořádek trying to reach the stage yet again before finally being stopped by security.|$|E
25|$|For a while, {{the dinner}} party {{proceeds}} smoothly. Inexperienced {{in the ways}} of the aristocracy, Myshkin is deeply impressed by the elegance and good humour of the company, unsuspicious of its superficiality. It turns out that one of those present—Ivan Petrovich—is a relative of his beloved benefactor Pavlishchev, and the Prince becomes extraordinarily enthusiastic. But when Ivan Petrovich mentions that Pavlishchev ended by giving up everything and going over to the Roman Church, Myshkin is horrified. He launches unexpectedly into a tirade against Catholicism, claiming that it preaches the Antichrist and in its quest for political supremacy has given birth to Atheism. Everyone present is shocked and several attempts are made to stop or divert him, but he only becomes more animated. At the height of his fervor, he begins <b>waving</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> about and knocks over the priceless Chinese vase, smashing it to pieces. There is a lull as Myshkin emerges from his profound astonishment and the general horror turns to amusement and concern for his health; but it is only temporary, and he soon begins another spontaneous discourse, this time {{on the subject of the}} aristocracy in Russia, once again becoming oblivious to all attempts to quell his ardour. The speech is only brought to an end by the onset of an epileptic seizure: Aglaya, deeply distressed, catches him in her arms as he falls. He is taken home, having left a decidedly negative impression on the guests.|$|E
25|$|In {{the region}} of Syrmia, people {{believed}} that dragons lived on high mountains and flew {{high in the sky}} shedding many sparks. Beneath them, in dense and terrible clouds, flew gigantic winged serpentine demons called aždaja, which spewed hail on fields. A special man, called an oblačar, would fight against them and their associates. This name is derived from the noun oblak ("cloud"). The oblačar would rush directly beneath the dark clouds, as soon as he noticed that they were gathering above the fields of his village. There he would run to and fro, following the movement of the aždaja, at the same time <b>waving</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms,</b> or holding a stick raised {{in the direction of the}} cloud. He would not stop until he was completely exhausted and drenched. Sometimes he succeeded in preventing hail fall, and other times not, as was the case with an oblačar from Mirkovci. When the wind blew the clouds away from Mirkovci without a damage to its crops, this man would return from the fields and boast to the villagers of his persistence in warding off the hail bringers despite their ferocity. And when hail fell on the crops, he would humbly state that he did his best, but the adversaries flung themselves upon him with tenfold fierceness. The villagers believed and felt sorry for their oblačar, all drenched and bruised by hail. In autumn, he drove his cart from house to house in Mirkovci, receiving wheat from farmers for his struggle.|$|E

500|$|In the {{folklore}} of Serbs in {{the region}} of Syrmia, protection from hail was provided by the men called oblačars; the name is derived from oblak [...] "cloud". The oblačar would rush directly beneath a dark cloud, as soon as it appeared above the fields of his village. There, he would run to and fro, <b>waving</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> or holding a stick raised {{in the direction of the}} cloud. He would not stop until he was completely exhausted and drenched. In this way, the oblačar fought against a gigantic serpentine demon called aždaja, which was thought to fly accompanied by its retinue in low dark clouds, spewing hail from its broad muzzle. If the cloud moved away from his village without discharging hail, it meant that the oblačar had overpowered the aždaja and its retinue. An oblačar in the village of Mirkovci annually received wheat from his co-villagers as a reward for his struggle.|$|E
500|$|At 8:15 am Missouri {{crossed the}} danger bearing into the shoal water. At this time Commander Peckham {{sent a message}} to Captain Brown stating [...] "Ship heading into Danger shoals. Recommend you come right immediately!", but this message was relayed by [...] "talkers" [...] (men charged with {{relaying}} messages for officers to different stations) and the talker who was supposed to pass Peckham's message to Brown had a tendency to mumble badly. At the same time Peckham was attempting to alert Brown of the impending grounding, Morris again approached Brown and recommended coming right to avoid the shoal water. Captain Brown did not recall being informed of this, and made no reply to Morris. At this point Morris took a bearing on Thimble Shoals, and alarmed at the impending grounding Morris frantically returned to the captain <b>waving</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> and shouting [...] "Come right! There's shoal water ahead!" [...] A disbelieving Captain Brown dismissed Morris pleas by stating that it was his belief that the navigator did not know where they were. To verify Morris' claims of impending shoal water, Brown asked Commander Millet to check Morris's position. As a precautionary move, Brown then ordered Quartermaster Travis, Missouris helmsman, to alter course to 058, but this order came too late.|$|E
500|$|The Red Sox were {{presented}} with their World Series rings on April 11, 2005, at a ceremony before the team's first home game of the 2005 season. Former Red Sox players Bobby Doerr, Dom DiMaggio, Johnny Pesky, and Carl Yastrzemski were all present, as were the Boston Symphony Orchestra and the Boston Pops Orchestra. During the ceremony, five red pennants were first unfurled {{at the top of}} the Green Monster, showing the years of each of the Red Sox' previous World Series wins. A much larger banner was unfurled that covered the entire wall and read [...] "2004 World Series Champions." [...] James Taylor, himself a Boston native and a Red Sox fan, performed [...] "America the Beautiful", and 19 members of the United States Army and Marine Corps who had fought in the Iraq War walked onto the field. Moments of silence were held to honor the deaths of Pope John Paul II, who had died nine days earlier, and former Red Sox relief pitcher, Dick Radatz. The rings were handed out by the team's owner, John W. Henry. Former Red Sox players Lowe and Dave Roberts, who had joined the Los Angeles Dodgers and San Diego Padres respectively during the off-season, were also present to collect their rings. The ceremony, which lasted around an hour, ended with stars from other Boston sports teams, including the Celtics' Bill Russell, the Bruins' Bobby Orr and the Patriots' Tedy Bruschi and Richard Seymour, throwing ceremonial first pitches. The presence of Bruschi and Seymour made evident the recent success of Boston-area teams. The day after the Red Sox won the Series, Shaughnessy and the rest of the news media said of the Red Sox home opener: [...] "The team in the third-base dugout? The New York Yankees, Sweet." [...] In a sign of respect, the Red Sox rivals came to the top step of the visitors dugout and gave the Red Sox a standing ovation. The Fenway Park crowd burst into cheers when Yankees pitcher Mariano Rivera was introduced, breaking from the tradition of fans booing opposing players, due to him having blown save opportunities in Games 4 and 5 of the 2004 ALCS. Rivera was a good sport about it and laughed while <b>waving</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> in mock appreciation of the fans.|$|E

2500|$|Will {{gained some}} notoriety {{for his efforts}} to prevent New York City from {{demolishing}} a squat on Fifth Street in the Lower East Side. When construction crews arrived at the building to begin taking it down, he stood atop the roof <b>waving</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms.</b> His efforts stalled the demolition, but the city eventually leveled the building, which housed a café, a meeting place and a performance space. Will later talked about the building in a program produced by Paper Tiger Television called [...] "ABC Survives, Fifth Street Buried Alive".|$|E
2500|$|Holloway {{inadvertently}} created one {{of these}} problems himself when he ordered Major General David W. Gray to establish an Army base in a large olive grove {{just east of the}} airport. Said Gray, [...] "I asked, 'Isn't that private property? Whom should I see about it?' I shall never forget [...] answer. <b>Waving</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> in characteristic fashion, he replied, 'Matter of military necessity. Send the bills to the Ambassador.' Of course, it didn't work out exactly that way...." [...] It turned out that the olive grove was the largest in Lebanon and vital to the local economy, but the Lebanese women who harvested the olives refused to enter the grove while American troops were present, risking the loss of the entire crop and severe unemployment. Holloway wryly observed that when his forces finally departed, they left behind a constitutionally elected president, a united army, peace in the area, and [...] "a few legal beagles to pay for damage to the olive groves." ...|$|E
2500|$|Regarding the NFL's {{position}} of a simultaneous catch with both players on the ground, Mike Florio wrote for Pro Football Talk, [...] "In reality, the outcome was determined before the players hit the ground. [...] That’s when Jennings first gained 'control' of the ball, regardless of whether Tate eventually secured simultaneous 'possession' of it...The relevant portion of the official 2012 rules comes from Rule 8, Section 1, Article 3, Item 5: [...] 'It is not a simultaneous catch if a player gains control first and an opponent subsequently gains joint control.' [...] (Emphasis added.) [...] Thus, it doesn’t matter whether the officials determined that Tate and Jennings jointly had 'possession' when they landed; {{the question is whether}} Jennings 'gained control' first." [...] The New York Times columnist Greg Bishop disputed the touchdown, writing, [...] "Another defender, M. D. Jennings, leapt from behind Tate. The ball appeared to land in Jennings’s hands. Tate’s hands were there, too, as Jennings fell to the ground and pulled the ball to his chest. Tate eventually wrestled the ball away." [...] Bishop further noted that, in <b>waving</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms,</b> back judge Rhone-Dunn appeared to be signaling a touchback for a change of possession via interception, which would have ended the game with a Packers victory.|$|E

2500|$|Unsportsmanlike conduct : Arguing with a referee; using slurs {{against an}} {{opponent}} or teammate; playing with illegal equipment; making obscene gestures or abusing an official. Can carry either a minor, misconduct, game misconduct or match penalty, {{depending on the}} gravity of the infraction (for instance, using obscene language to a referee initially results in a minor, but making an obscene gesture to an opponent, fan or official carries a game misconduct.) Also, in some leagues the penalty progression is different for players and team officials (for example, in the USA Hockey rulebook players get a minor for their first infraction, a misconduct for their second and a game misconduct for their third, whereas the option of a misconduct is removed for coaches; in addition, after each penalty for [...] a team official, the penalty count resets itself). Unsportsmanlike conduct may also be called if a player drops gloves and stick in preparation for a fight, but the non-offending player does not drop the corresponding equipment and has committed no action (verbal or physical harassment) to attempt to instigate a fight. Since 2008, the NHL has ruled that standing in front of an opposing goaltender and engaging [...] "in actions such as <b>waving</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> or stick in front of the goaltender's face, for the purpose of improperly interfering with and/or distracting the goaltender" [...] will draw a minor unsportsmanlike conduct penalty, a rule interpretation inspired by the play of Sean Avery against Martin Brodeur.|$|E
