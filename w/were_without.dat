Wenger's tactics worked, as the Arsenal defence withstood the pressure from the Manchester United attack. United themselves <b>were</b> <b>without</b> Paul Scholes due to injury, and they played a 4–3–2–1 formation with Phil Neville, Roy Keane and Quinton Fortune completing a defensively minded midfield.|$|E

Also affected by the storm was the agricultural sector. Though much of the sugar cane was already harvested, what was left was severely damaged.
