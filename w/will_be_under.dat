5|$|The Messians {{instruct}} the hero {{to use the}} Seven Pillars of Solomon, collected during his travels, at ground zero of the missile attacks in order to open a gateway to the demon world of Atziluth and defeat the demons once and for all. Once in the demon world, the heroes travel through several areas and defeat the ruling demon overlords. If the heroes are carrying Bael with them, they can choose to restore him into his true form, the god Baal. The god Izanagi also asks the heroes to rescue the goddess Izanami, who has been killed by the demons. After defeating all the overlords and managing to revive Izanami, the gods help the heroes travel to Lucifer's castle. If Bael has been restored into Baal, Lucifer explains that the demons are actually ancient gods cast into hell by the One True God, who is using the party to defeat his enemies, destroy both worlds and create a paradise where mankind <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>under</b> his rule forever. Lucifer offers to help the player prevent God's plans, and claims that Satan, {{who was responsible for}} the nuclear war, must be dealt with. The heroes then travel back to the human world to confront Satan. If they did not accept Lucifer's help and killed him instead, they defeat Satan and are then transported before God, who turns them into new deities and creates the Millennial Kingdom. If Lucifer is in their party, they have the chance to do battle with God. After defeating the god, he warns them that he will revive in time, and that without his help they have chosen a difficult path. Lucifer then returns to Atziluth with all the demons, sealing the rift between worlds and leaving humans to rebuild and recover from the war on their own.|$|E

25|$|Many of the {{facilities}} and services provided on the ride are contributed by around 400 volunteers each year. Volunteers include those {{with family and friends}} doing the ride but who do not want to ride themselves, former riders no longer able to participate, and many who simply enjoy the atmosphere of the ride. Some of the volunteers also participate in the ride itself. Volunteer positions include catering services, medical services, luggage handlers, route marshals, information and media services, sign production, sag wagon, Warby team, cleaning services, tent set-up, and campsite services. A total of thirty-five different volunteer teams operate on the ride. Often volunteers <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>under</b> the guidance of paid employees, or assisting paid independent contractors in providing a service. Without the level of support provided by volunteer labour the cost of ride would become prohibitively expensive for many riders.|$|E
25|$|A trader who {{expects a}} stock's price to {{decrease}} {{can buy a}} put option to sell the stock at a fixed price ("strike price") at a later date. The trader <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>under</b> no obligation to sell the stock, but only {{has the right to}} do so at or before the expiration date. If the stock price at expiration is below the exercise price by more than the premium paid, he will make a profit. If the stock price at expiration is above the exercise price, he will let the put contract expire and only lose the premium paid. In the transaction, the premium also plays a major role as it enhances the break-even point. For example, if exercise price is 100, premium paid is 10, then a spot price of 100 to 90 is not profitable. He would make a profit if the spot price is below 90.|$|E
25|$|On 7 May 1961, the 7th Assam Rifles {{expedition}} {{team led}} by Major Sumer Singh entered the Moloshidi Valley and reached the largest village in the valley, Shidi (now called Gandhigram). They were accorded a warm reception by the villagers and further told by the villagers {{that they were the}} first ever to have visited Lisu land, Moloshidi Valley. The Assam Rifles team assured the villagers that from now on this virgin land <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>under</b> Indian rule and the people would be protected from enemy aggression. Till then there was no international boundary in the Moloshidi Valley. In 1972 the Demarcation of International Boundary with Burma was completed, largely due to Lisu project guides, the only ones with full knowledge of their region. During demarcation, cement pillars were erected at strategic elevations. In the process, the Moloshidi Valley fell on the Indian side of the boundary.|$|E

500|$|At {{the time}} of UDI, Harper {{reportedly}} kept a map of southern Africa {{on the wall of}} his office, on which he had coloured South Africa, South-West Africa, Rhodesia, Mozambique south of the Zambezi and Angola red; he told visitors that [...] "the red area <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>under</b> white rule forever." [...] While insisting that Rhodesia would continue regardless of international opinion, he publicly demonised the UK government, describing it in January 1966 as [...] "an enemy... must be brought down". He also vilified black nationalist guerrilla fighters opposed to the Rhodesian government, calling them [...] "gangs of terrorists" [...] and [...] "criminals". Comments such as these helped to cement Harper's reputation as a hardline right-winger and rival to Smith's leadership. The strong personalities of Harper and other ministers such as the Duke of Montrose (generally known in Rhodesia by his former title Lord Graham) were perceived by the British Prime Minister Harold Wilson and his compatriots as a great influence on Smith's political decision-making, an opinion also expressed by Harper himself.|$|E

500|$|Televised {{presidential debates}} were reintroduced {{for the first}} time since the 1960 election. As such, Ford became the first {{incumbent}} president to participate in one. Carter later attributed his victory in the election to the debates, saying they [...] "gave the viewers reason to think that Jimmy Carter had something to offer". The turning point came in the second debate when Ford blundered by stating, [...] "There is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe and there never <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>under</b> a Ford Administration." [...] Ford also said that he did not [...] "believe that the Poles consider themselves dominated by the Soviet Union". In an interview years later, Ford said he had intended to imply that the Soviets would never crush the spirits of eastern Europeans seeking independence. However, the phrasing was so awkward that questioner Max Frankel was visibly incredulous at the response. As a result of this blunder, and Carter's promise of a full presidential pardon for political refugees from the Vietnam era during the presidential debates, Ford's surge stalled and Carter was able to maintain a slight lead in the polls.|$|E
500|$|Liverpool manager Rafael Benítez {{was adamant}} that opponents Chelsea were the team {{under the most}} {{pressure}} to win the match: [...] "There will be more pressure on them, they {{have spent a lot}} of money and are the best team in the league, because they are in first position, but they've lost their last two important games. That means they <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>under</b> pressure. People will see them as the favourites, I'm sure, so the pressure is on them and not us." [...] Benítez was confident that playing in a cup final would be beneficial to his players: [...] "We need experiences like this to progress, when I decided to come here I said I wanted to win trophies. Our challenge is to win the Premier League, the Champions League, the Uefa Cup, the FA Cup and the Carling Cup. This is a chance to start." [...] Goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek believed winning the competition in 2003 would benefit Liverpool: [...] "It was great to win there before and I also had one of my best performances for Liverpool. There's a great buzz around the place; we know that the club expects to win trophies, and we're in a position to deliver that later this week." ...|$|E
