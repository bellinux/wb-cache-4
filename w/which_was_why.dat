5|$|Yasuhara {{wanted the}} game to appeal to both Japanese and American players, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> Green Hill Zone was {{redesigned}} many times. Sonic Team wanted the level to portray the character correctly. Its checkered ground was inspired by 3D image rendering from computers, an idea Naka obtained from Yu Suzuki, who used this technique with Space Harrier. The development team read each issue of Famitsu to stay informed of what their rivals were doing so they can avoid making the same mistakes.|$|E
5|$|After the attack, Selver roams {{through the}} forest for five days before coming upon an Athshean settlement. After {{recovering}} {{from the effects of}} many days of travel, Selver describes {{to the people of the}} town the destruction of his town, known as Eshreth, by the Terrans, who then built their headquarters at the site. He also tells them about the enslavement of hundreds of Athsheans at the various camps. He says that the Terrans are crazy because they do not respect the sanctity of life in the same way that the Athsheans do, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> he led the attack against camp Smith. After some discussion, the people of the town send messengers to other towns sharing Selver's story, while Selver himself travels back towards the Terran headquarters.|$|E
5|$|In October 1965, Leeds skipper Collins {{was injured}} in an Inter-Cities Fairs Cup game against Torino and Revie gave the {{captaincy}} to Bremner after initially handing the armband to Charlton {{for the remainder of}} the season; Charlton was keen to give up the captaincy as it prevented his superstitious ritual of coming out of the tunnel last on match days. Revie and Bremner had a strong bond of trust, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> the manager gave him the captaincy at such a young age. Leeds finished second in the league in the 1965–66 campaign to Liverpool, who had finished six points clear at the top.|$|E

5|$|Kriosian {{ambassador}} Briam (Tim O'Connor) {{comes on}} board the Enterprise with some cargo, ready for a peace ceremony with the Valtian. As the ship heads to the rendezvous, they save two Ferengi from a failing ship. Despite security being assigned, the Ferengi enter the cargo bay and deactivate the stasis field on Briam's cargo, revealing a young Kriosian woman named Kamala (Famke Janssen). With the Ferengi secured, it is revealed that she is an empathic metamorph who can sense what males around her desire and react appropriately. She was being brought as an arranged marriage to the Valtian representative. Kamala is generating pheromones that can affect males around her, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> she was kept in stasis until the ceremony.|$|E
5|$|Wishing to {{capitalize}} on Soult's failure to defend Bordeaux, Wellington sent Beresford and the 4th and 7th Divisions to seize the seaport. Beresford departed the Allied camp on 7 March and occupied Bordeaux on 12 March. Leaving the 7th Division as an occupation force, Beresford hurried back with the 4th Division to join Wellington on 19 March. During this period, Allied infantry strength fell to 29,000 <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> Wellington did not trouble Soult. To {{make up for the}} deficit, the British army commander called for his heavy cavalry brigades to join him. He also asked for 8,000 Spanish reinforcements to be forwarded to the army, the soldiers to be paid by the British treasury. The Battle of Toulouse would be fought on 10 April.|$|E
5|$|Specifying power levels over 100% {{may seem}} nonsensical, {{but there was}} a logic behind it. The 100% level does not mean the maximum {{physical}} power level attainable, rather it was a specification decided on during engine development—the expected rated power level. When later studies indicated the engine could operate safely at levels above 100%, these higher levels became standard. Maintaining the original relationship of power level to physical thrust helps reduce confusion, as it created an unvarying fixed relationship so that test data (or operational data from past or future missions) can be easily compared. If the power level was increased, and that new value was said to be 100%, then all previous data and documentation would either require changing, or cross-checking against what physical thrust corresponded to 100% power level on that date. Engine power level affects engine reliability, with studies indicating the probability of an engine failure increasing rapidly with power levels over 104.5%, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> power levels above 104.5% were retained for contingency use only.|$|E

Winston Churchill replied that the aircraft that attacked Domala had been initially misidentified as a friendly one, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> the guns were not manned. A British destroyer also misidentified the aircraft. It was also asked why the gunners were not always manning the guns.

25|$|The {{brothers}} {{continued their}} rivalry with their individual opponents before reuniting for a rematch {{on the last}} SmackDown! before Armageddon. This time, the match {{would go to a}} double disqualification as Kennedy threatened to run over Kane with a hearse parked ringside. The Undertaker, who had run off MVP, emerged in the passenger seat as his gong tolled and the lights went out, thus scaring Kennedy out of the vehicle. At Armageddon, Undertaker defeated Kennedy in a Last Ride match, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> the hearse had been at ringside for the last two weeks, and Kane defeated MVP earlier in an inferno match. The next week on SmackDown!, the Brothers would reunite once again, defeating King Booker and Finlay, before parting ways as Kane began a rivalry with The Great Khali while Undertaker successfully pursued the World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania 23.|$|E
25|$|Construction of a {{television}} network started with a microwave radio relay in the super high frequency band. The backbone of the system was a two-way 960 telephone channel, a one-way television channel network and additional communications lines in a third channel in Southern Norway. These lines could be rerouted {{if one of the}} relay stations fell out. It was supplemented with a redundant 300 telephone channel network. The relay network largely used the same masts as were used for television transmission, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> the Telegraphy Administration was chosen instead of NRK. The 1957 plan called for seventy to eighty percent of the population having television coverage within twelve years. This was budgeted to cost NOK70 million, consisting of 28 transmitters and 19 frequency converters. The FM network would be built in parallel, with 37 transmitters and 10 frequency converters.|$|E
25|$|Asafa Powell {{opened his}} 2010 season on 20 February at the UWI Invitational Meet in Jamaica, by {{competing}} in the 400m. He won his heat {{in a time of}} 47.56s, but he was placed 3rd overall according to his time. He then ran the 200m at the UTech Classic on 17 April 2010, also in his homeland. He competed in the 200m in heavy rain and cold conditions. Powell opened up a huge lead in the first 100m after which he slowed drastically and won his heat in 21.27s in a 1m/s headwind. Later it was reported that Powell had suffered minor cramps on his left calf muscles, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> he had to slow down. Powell was next scheduled to run in the highly anticipated 4x100m Penn Relays featuring Jamaica Yellow, and competing against Usain Bolt (Jamaica Black). But he pulled out of the race as it was reported by his assistant coach that he had an injured toe which would need some time to heal. At the IAAF Diamond League in Doha, Powell made a wind aided time of 9.75s in the heat and 9.81s in the final,also wind-aided. He subsequently set a 100m world leading time of 9.83s. En route to this performance, he also set the rarely run 100 yards dash world best at 9.07 s, beating the previous record of 9.21 set by Charlie Greene.|$|E
