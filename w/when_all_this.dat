It is also useful to consider the inflection points as remarkable points. <b>When</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> information is drawn on a sheet of paper, the shape of the curve usually appears rather clearly. If not, it suffices to add a few other points and their tangents to get a good description of the curve.|$|E

[...] Akass cites the episode while analyzing the phenomenon of self-improvement, and notes that: [...] "Repairing her shingles often leaves Ruth in shackles." [...] She writes that: [...] "the series performs the logic of self-help, both its silly and seductive sides." [...] However, she {{also points out that}} Ruth's rant {{at the end of her}} seminar is cathartic for Ruth, and she ends her analysis of the episode by asking: [...] "So, what do we make of our times <b>when</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> supposed nonsense actually works?" ...|$|E
500|$|After their {{break up}} Charlie gets drunk {{and goes into}} work as normal the next day. While on duty Annie Campbell (Charlotte Best) becomes stuck down a storm drain. Charlie {{attempts}} to save her but a storm forces the water levels to rise. As Charlie is hungover, Anderson told Inside Soap that [...] "Charlie's a bit dazed and confused <b>when</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> happens". However, she is a [...] "professional and goes straight into work mode". When Charlie frees Annie, a wave of water floods the drain and Charlie is swept away. Roman then arrives {{on the scene and}} fights to save Charlie. Anderson explained that it is up to Roman to save Charlie's life and said [...] "of all people it has to be the guy who's just broken her heart". Off-screen the scenes in the storm drain posed a series of logistical challenges for the production team. The series had a specially built set for the scenes and they placed jets under the water to create rough waves. Anderson said that she could swim and was not afraid to film in the water. The only problem was the temperature of the water. Anderson said [...] "It was absolutely freezing. Filming was tough work, but I think the finished result is worth it." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{the boom}} years of World War I, Baldwin's {{business}} would decline as the Great Depression gripped the country and diesel engines became the growth market on American railways {{at the end of}} the 1930s. During the 1920s the major locomotive manufacturers had strong incentives to maintain the dominance of the steam engine. Nevertheless, ALCO, while remaining committed to steam production, pursued R strategies in the 1920s and '30s that would ensure its competitiveness in the event that diesel locomotives would predominate. In contrast, Baldwin in the 1930s discounted the possibility that diesel could replace steam. In 1930 Samuel Vauclain, Chairman of the Board, stated in a speech that advances in steam technology would ensure the dominance of the steam engine until at least 1980. Baldwin’s Vice President and Director of Sales stated in December 1937 that [...] "Some time in the future, <b>when</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> is reviewed, it will be found that our railroads are no more dieselized than they electrified". Baldwin had deep roots in the steam locomotive industry, and may have been influenced by heavy investment in its Eddystone plant.|$|E

2500|$|Crabbe's life at Parham was not happy. The {{former owner}} of the estate had been very popular for his hospitality, while Crabbe's {{lifestyle}} was much more quiet and private. His solace here was the company of his friend Dudley Long North and his fellow Whigs who lived nearby. Crabbe soon sent his two sons George and John to school in Aldeburgh. After four years at Parham, the Crabbes moved to a home in Great Glemham, Suffolk, placed at his disposal by Dudley North. The family remained here {{for four or five}} years. In 1796 their third son, Edmund {{died at the age of}} six. This was a heavy blow to Sarah who began suffering from a nervous disorder from which she never recovered. Crabbe, a devoted husband, tended her with exemplary care until her death in 1813. Robert Southey, writing about Crabbe to his friend, Neville White, in 1808, said [...] "It was not long before his wife became deranged, and <b>when</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> was told me by one who knew him well, five years ago, he was still almost confined in his own house, anxiously waiting upon this wife in her long and hopeless malady.
