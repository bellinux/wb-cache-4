5|$|In Boston, a visibly {{sick man}} from the Netherlands arrives at an office building, only to {{collapse}} and die. The veins in his body erupt with blood, spraying surrounding witnesses. The Fringe team arrive on site, and while interviewing the witnesses, another man also becomes sick. The sick man attempts to leave the building, only to be stopped by Walter (John Noble), <b>who</b> <b>sees</b> <b>the</b> man spray out blood and realizes there is a contagion. The building is quarantined with Walter's son Peter (Joshua Jackson), FBI agent Olivia (Anna Torv), {{and the rest of}} the witnesses still inside.|$|E
5|$|The spatial {{structure}} and {{positioning of the}} mirror's reflection are such that PhilipIV and Mariana appear to be standing on the viewer's side of the pictorial space, facing the Infanta and her entourage. According to Janson, {{not only is the}} gathering of figures in the foreground for Philip and Mariana's benefit, but the painter's attention is concentrated on the couple, as he appears to be working on their portrait. Although they can only be seen in the mirror reflection, their distant image occupies a central position in the canvas, in terms of social hierarchy as well as composition. As spectators, our position in relation to the painting is uncertain. It has been debated whether the ruling couple are standing beside the viewer or have replaced the viewer, <b>who</b> <b>sees</b> <b>the</b> scene through their eyes. Lending weight to the latter idea are the gazes of three of the figures—Velázquez, the Infanta, and Maribarbola—who appear to be looking directly at the viewer.|$|E

25|$|Weir's first American {{film was}} the {{successful}} thriller Witness (1985), {{the first of}} two films he made with Harrison Ford, about a boy <b>who</b> <b>sees</b> <b>the</b> murder of an undercover police officer by corrupt coworkers and has to be hidden away in his Amish community to protect him. Child star Lukas Haas received wide praise for his debut film performance; Witness also earned Weir his first Oscar nomination as Best Director, and was his first of several films to be nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture, it later won 2 for Best Film Editing & Best Original Screenplay.|$|E
25|$|This legend was {{developed}} {{over time and}} has been chronicled by Gayle Dean Wardlow, Edward Komara and Elijah Wald, <b>who</b> <b>sees</b> <b>the</b> legend as largely dating from Johnson's rediscovery by white fans {{more than two decades}} after his death. Son House once told the story to Pete Welding as an explanation of Johnson's astonishingly rapid mastery of the guitar. Welding reported it as a serious belief in a widely read article in Down Beat in 1966. Other interviewers failed to elicit any confirmation from House and there were fully two years between House's observation of Johnson as first a novice and then a master.|$|E
25|$|A {{few years}} later, {{following}} {{the success of}} The Good Life, Spence was asked by BBC Radio {{to come up with}} an idea for a programme to feature Keith. Thinking of Keith's character in The Good Life, Spence had the idea of an upper-class version of Margo Leadbetter and, from the account from the comedian, came up with Audrey fforbes-Hamilton. Instead of a Cockney comedian as the new owner of the manor, Spence decided on an American <b>who</b> <b>sees</b> <b>the</b> manor while in England looking for his roots. The American later discovers he is descended from the fforbes-Hamiltons. This was made into a radio pilot in 1976 with Bernard Braden as the American, but was never broadcast because of the interest to make it into a TV series.|$|E

25|$|Each kohen's tallit is {{draped over}} his head and hands so that the {{congregation}} cannot see his hands while the blessing is said. Performing the Jewish ceremony of the priestly blessing is known in Yiddish as duchening, a reference to the bimah on which the blessing is said. The tradition of covering the hands stems from the biblical prohibition against a Kohen with hands that are disfigured in any way from offering the blessing. The rabbis softened this prohibition by saying that a Kohen with disfigured hands to which the community had become accustomed could bless. In later centuries, the practice became for all Kohanim to cover their hands so that any disfigurement would not be seen by the Congregation. This gave rise to folklore that one should not see the hands of the Kohen or even that harm would befall someone <b>who</b> <b>sees</b> <b>the</b> hands of the Kohen. Some congregants will even turn their backs to the Kohanim so as to avoid any possibility of seeing their hands—although this practice is unsupported by any rabbinic source.|$|E
500|$|As with Casino Royale, the {{question}} of morality between Bond and the villains is brought up, again by Bond, {{but also by the}} police officer involved. Benson argues that this runs counter to another theme in the novel, which had also appeared {{in a number of other}} Bond books including Goldfinger: the concept of Bond as Saint George against the dragon. In this Black agrees, <b>who</b> <b>sees</b> <b>The</b> Spy Who Loved Me as being [...] "an account of the vulnerable under challenge, of the manipulative nature of individuals and of the possibility of being trapped by evil".|$|E
500|$|The sea-witch warns the mermaid that, {{although}} {{she will be}} graceful, each step will feel as though she is stepping on knives; and that if she does not earn the prince's love, she will die of a broken heart after he weds another. [...] The spell is worked, and the mermaid is found by the prince, <b>who</b> <b>sees</b> <b>the</b> resemblance {{between her and the}} one who rescued him from drowning, although he does not realize that they are the same person. [...] Although the prince cares deeply for the mermaid, he is betrothed to the daughter of a neighboring king, and the mermaid cannot prevent their marriage.|$|E

Walford advocates abandoning the notion of [...] "disguised symbolism". All of Ruisdael's work can be interpreted according to the religious world view of his time: nature serves as the [...] "first book" [...] of God, both because of its inherent divine qualities and because of God's obvious concern for man and the world. The intention is spiritual, not moral.|$|E
500|$|Dr. Meredith Grey is the {{daughter}} of world-renowned surgeon Ellis Grey, and grew up in her shadow. Ellis was a deeply flawed, emotionally and verbally abusive, neglectful mother towards her. Meredith is described as a [...] "dark and twisty," [...] damaged person <b>who</b> <b>sees</b> <b>the</b> world in varying shades of gray morality. Because of this, she is an emotionally complex person capable of empathizing with others when they're at their lowest points, and a sensitive observer of the people around her. Meredith is a graduate of Dartmouth College and nearly did not attend med school due to conflicts with her mother. Meredith was directionless after obtaining her undergrad and had plans to sleep and party her way through Europe. After a month abroad, Meredith was called back to care for Ellis, who had developed early-onset Alzheimer's disease, and Meredith obtained her M.D.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, {{thanks to}} Kenny, {{the two men}} are mistakenly {{diagnosed}} to have [...] "pinkeye", but they turn into zombies and go around biting other people, turning them into zombies. Back home, Chef, <b>who</b> <b>sees</b> <b>the</b> outbreak on TV, tries to warn both the doctor and Mayor McDaniels (who is having sex with Officer Barbrady), but his pleas are ignored. The boys go trick-or-treating (Kyle now dressed as a vampire), not noticing the outbreak, and abandon Kenny, who continues to eat people. They arrive at Chef's home, and Chef tells them {{what is really going on}} before taking them to the morgue to stop the outbreak. After discovering the hotline number on the Worcestershire sauce bottle, the boys and Chef are attacked by the zombies with Chef becoming the next victim and dancing with other zombies. Stan and Cartman kill the other zombies with chainsaws and Stan hesitates to kill a zombified Wendy. After Kyle discovers he has to kill the original zombie (after being told complicatedly by the hotline lady), he slices Kenny in half, killing him. The spell is broken and all the zombies turn back to normal. Stan makes up with Wendy and they are about to kiss but he ends up puking on her, leaving her disgusted.|$|E

500|$|Bates's {{occasional}} {{hints at}} Darwinian evolution are unwelcome or misunderstood by the reviewer, as when Bates writes {{that if a}} kind of seed is found in two places, we have to [...] "come to the strange conclusion" [...] it has been created twice unless we can show it can be carried that far; but the reviewer finds Bates in [...] "too great a hurry to come to conclusions" [...] (sic). The reviewer, too, objects to Bates's illustration of [...] "transition forms between Heliconius Melpomene and H. Thelxiope, which he thinks are no more different than [...] "a couple of Dorking hens". Bates's assumption that all forest animals are adapted to forest life is rejected by the reviewer, <b>who</b> <b>sees</b> <b>the</b> same features as signs of a beneficent Creator; while his mention of [...] "slow adaptation of the fauna of a forest-clad country throughout an immense lapse of geological time" [...] is criticised for being [...] "haunted" [...] by this [...] "spectre of time". However the reviewer is fascinated by the variety of life described in the book, and by Bates's [...] "rapturous manner" [...] of speaking about how delicious monkey flesh is, which [...] "almost puts a premium on cannibalism". The review concludes [...] "not without regret" [...] (at such an enjoyable book), and assures readers [...] "that they will not find him heavy reading"; supposes that 11 years was [...] "perhaps a little too much" [...] of tropical life; and recommends intending museum curators to try it for [...] "a year or two".|$|E
