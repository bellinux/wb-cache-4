5|$|According to Russian expert Anton Lavrov, on 8 August, Russian and South Ossetian troops {{deployed}} in South Ossetia were unaware that Russian aviation {{was involved in}} the war. Russian troops and South Ossetians often assessed Russian aircraft as hostile and fired at them before precise identification took place. On 8 August, the air force performed 63 flights in support of Russian ground troops. A total of six Russian aircraft were lost during the war: one Su-25SM, two Su-25BMs, two Su-24Ms and one Tu-22M3; friendly fire <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> of the downing of three planes.

5|$|Hugh may {{not have}} {{attended}} the coronation of King Henry II of England and his queen Eleanor of Aquitaine. Some sources place him at the coronation, others do not. He also {{did not attend the}} Council of Clarendon in 1164 that issued the Constitutions of Clarendon, that <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> of the quarrel between the king and Thomas Becket. In the ensuing dispute between the king and Becket, Hugh did not take sides. He was, however, present with Roger de Pont L'Evêque the Archbishop of York at the coronation of the king's eldest son Henry the Young King in 1170, and consequently was suspended by Alexander III. The coronation of the Young King eventually led to Becket's martyrdom in December 1170.|$|E

It was escorted by three cavalry squadrons and followed by three hundred carriages, while onlookers crowded both sides of the streets along the procession's route.

The marriage was short lived, though, ending with Koniecpolski's death in Brody on 11 March 1646. Sources suggest that his new marriage <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> of his death; Joachim Jerlicz wrote in his diary that Koniecpolski had overdosed on an aphrodisiac.

Albert died at 10:50p.m. on 14 December 1861 in the Blue Room at Windsor Castle, in {{the presence}} of the Queen and five of their nine children. The contemporary diagnosis was typhoid fever, but modern writers have pointed out that Albert was ill for at least two years before his death, which may indicate that a chronic disease, such as Crohn's disease, renal failure, or abdominal cancer, <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> of death.|$|E

5|$|Symeon endured severe {{opposition}} from church authorities, {{particularly from the}} chief theologian of the emperor's court, Archbishop Stephen, who at one time was the Metropolitan of Nicomedia. Stephen was a former politician and diplomat {{with a reputation for}} a thorough theoretical understanding of theology, but one which was removed from actual experience of the spiritual life. Symeon, in contrast, held the view that one must have actual experience of the Holy Spirit in order to speak about God, at the same time recognizing the authority of scripture and of the earlier church fathers. Their differing views on the source of authority to speak on spiritual matters <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> of several years of intense conflict, ending with Symeon's eventual exile.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemical}} changes {{associated with}} infection of a tumor or its surrounding tissue can cause rapidly escalating pain, but infection is sometimes overlooked {{as a possible}} cause. One study found that infection <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> of pain in four percent of nearly 300 people with cancer who were referred for pain relief. Another report described seven people with cancer, whose previously well-controlled pain escalated significantly over several days. Antibiotic treatment produced pain relief {{in all of them}} within three days.|$|E

Ned must travel south to help the king and find out who killed the previous Hand of the King, Jon Arryn, while trying to protect his family from the Lannisters.

5|$|An initial trial {{concluded}} on 23 May 2008 when Mr Justice David Steel {{issued a}} summary judgment after hearing that both Total and Hertfordshire Oil Storage Ltd (HOSL) had agreed that negligence <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause.</b> In the main trial, Total UK {{claimed that the}} duty supervisor {{at the time was}} responsible for the explosion, but refused to admit either civil or criminal liability for the incident. Total UK argued that it should not be liable for damages because it could not reasonably have foreseen that it would cause the destruction it did. On 20 March 2009 the High Court found Total liable for the blast, saying that it was satisfied that Total had control of tank filling operations at the Buncefield depot. The judgement left the company facing damage claims of around £700million.|$|E
5|$|At only 21 Kydd was the {{youngest}} player on the tour of Jamaica and, while she toured with {{the remainder of the}} team, was overlooked for a Test position. She finally made her full début against South Africa not long afterwards, and managed to cement her position with a superb performance, managing an accuracy rate of 94% in the third Test. This performance, along with similar form in the national league, led to her selection in the starting squad for the 2003 Netball World Championships. She played every game in the world championships in July at the expense of ageing veteran Eloise Southby, a decision which <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> of some controversy. She subsequently helped the Kestrels to the elimination final and, {{at the end of the}} season, was named as the team's new vice-captain, with predecessor Janine Ilitch assuming the captaincy. She also won the coveted Commonwealth Bank Trophy Player's Player Award, and tied for third in the Most Valuable Player count.|$|E
5|$|Blaine’s {{earliest}} expressions in {{the foreign}} policy sphere were those of a reactionary Anglophobe, {{but by the end}} of his career his relationship with the United Kingdom had become more moderate and nuanced. A dispute over seal hunting in the waters off Alaska <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> of Blaine’s first interaction with Britain as Harrison’s Secretary of State. A law passed in 1889 required Harrison to ban seal hunting in Alaskan waters, but Canadian fishermen believed they had the right to continue fishing there. Soon thereafter, the United States Navy seized several Canadian ships near the Pribilof Islands. Blaine entered into negotiations with Britain and the two nations agreed to submit the dispute to arbitration by a neutral tribunal. Blaine was no longer in office when the tribunal began its work, but the result was to allow the hunting once more, albeit with some regulation, and to require the United States to pay damages of $473,151. Ultimately, the nations signed the North Pacific Fur Seal Convention of 1911, which outlawed open-water seal hunting.|$|E

5|$|In 1092, {{the peace}} {{began to break}} down. Based {{on the idea that}} the Scots {{controlled}} much of modern Cumbria, it had been supposed that William Rufus's new castle at Carlisle and his settlement of English peasants in the surrounds <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause.</b> It is unlikely that Malcolm controlled Cumbria, and the dispute instead concerned the estates granted to Malcolm by William Rufus's father in 1072 for his maintenance when visiting England. Malcolm sent messengers to discuss the question and William Rufus agreed to a meeting. Malcolm travelled south to Gloucester, stopping at Wilton Abbey to visit his daughter Edith and sister-in-law Cristina. Malcolm arrived there on 24 August 1093 to find that William Rufus refused to negotiate, insisting that the dispute be judged by the English barons. This Malcolm refused to accept, and returned immediately to Scotland.|$|E
5|$|In England and Wales an {{estimated}} 41,200 cases of paracetamol poisoning occurred in 1989 to 1990, with a mortality of 0.40%.

Paracetamol overdose results in more calls to poison control centers in the US than overdose of any other pharmacological substance, accounting for more than 100,000 calls, as well as 56,000 emergency room visits, 2,600 hospitalizations, and 458 deaths due to acute liver failure per year.
