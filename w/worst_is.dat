The book was {{published}} in 2005 by Warner Books, the same year as the 25th Golden Raspberry Awards.|$|E
25|$|Yield to worst (YTW): when a bond is callable, puttable, exchangeable, or {{has other}} features, the yield to <b>worst</b> <b>is</b> the lowest yield of yield to maturity, yield to call, yield to put, and others.|$|E
25|$|Christofides {{made a big}} {{advance in}} this {{approach}} of giving an approach for which we know the worst-case scenario. Christofides algorithm given in 1976, at <b>worst</b> <b>is</b> 1.5 times longer than the optimal solution. As the algorithm was so simple and quick, many hoped it would {{give way to a}} near optimal solution method. However, until 2011 when it was beaten by less than a billionth of a percent, this remained the method with the best worst-case scenario.|$|E
50|$|Best of the <b>Worst</b> <b>was</b> {{made up of}} four rounds.|$|R

25|$|Considering US {{box office}} statistics, the most {{successful}} Jet Li film as of August 2010 is Lethal Weapon 4, which grossed over 130 million dollars domestically, while the second is The Expendables with over 103 million dollars. Hero is the third most successful foreign language film in the US, {{and one of the}} best critically acclaimed Li movies. Fearless is the seventh most successful foreign language film of all time in the US. From a critical point of view, the best acclaimed Li movie is Fist of Legend (Rotten Tomatoes: 100%) and the <b>worst</b> <b>is</b> War (Rotten Tomatoes: 12%).|$|E
500|$|The {{concerns}} over the castle were significant. Francis Godolphin, {{who at the time}} was renting Tresco from the Crown, commented {{at the end of the}} century that the castle could not defend the island as [...] "it neither discovereth the whole harbour so through the iminent height thereof can make no good shot so steep downwards", and also complained about its fortification, [...] "which is <b>worst,</b> <b>is</b> of so weak form as it cannot be defended". Partially in response to these problems, the new Star Castle was constructed on St Mary's island between 1593 and 1594; a more modern, well-positioned design, Star Castle rapidly became the key defensive site in the Scilly Isles.|$|E
500|$|Critics did {{not receive}} Eternal Pyre very well, with few {{professionals}} actually reviewing the album. The Pitch criticized {{the price of the}} extended play at 5.99, stating in comparison it makes iTunes a bargain. The Pitch's reviewer also said that [...] "Slayer's <b>worst</b> <b>is</b> never far from its best, and this cut's in the middle." [...] The extended play was, however, generally well received by fans, despite having a limited number of copies available. Eternal Pyre debuted at number forty-eight on the Swedish charts, and number two on the Finnish charts. With a limited pressing of 1,000 copies, the EP was exclusively made available in Hot Topic stores starting on June 6, and was later made available in Europe on June 23.|$|E

500|$|Maurice Richardson, {{writing in}} The Observer, lamented that [...] "perhaps Ian Fleming was very tired {{when he wrote}} it. Perhaps... he left it unrevised. The fact remains that this posthumous Bond is a sadly sub-standard job." [...] His praise for the novel was muted, admitting [...] "it isn't of course by any means totally {{unreadable}} but it's depressingly far from the best Bond." [...] Writing in The Observers sister paper, The Guardian, Christopher Wordsworth noted that [...] "since Goldfinger 007 has been toiling hopelessly {{in the wake of}} the Zeitgeist." [...] Prior to this novel, Wordsworth writes, [...] "the distance between Live and let Die, Ian Fleming's second and best, and You Only Live Twice, his last and <b>worst,</b> <b>is</b> a long iron down the Sandwich fairway." [...] The Man with the Golden Gun, however, sinks to the level of a [...] "farrago".|$|E
500|$|On August 2, the Tanana River at Nenana crested at 14.64feet. This total {{was more}} than four feet above flood stage and was the third-highest water level ever {{recorded}}, falling short of a 15.9-foot mark in 1948 and the record 18.9-foot mark recorded during the flood of 1967. The town shipyard was submerged under three feet of water, and the town's clinic was moved from its interim location in the fire station to the town airport after floodwater threatened the station. Town leaders encouraged residents to evacuate to higher ground until the flood receded. Nenana High School was saved from flooding by just eight inches of elevation. Water lapped around the school's base, but did not enter the school itself due to that small margin. High water lingered in the town until August 3, when a National Weather Service forecaster felt confident enough to say, [...] "The <b>worst</b> <b>is</b> over." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "When 'the <b>worst</b> <b>is</b> certain'" [...] ("Quand 'le pire est toujours sûr'"), {{written in}} 1974, {{published}} {{for the first}} time in 1991 in L'Ennemi déclaré: textes et entretiens.|$|E

25|$|Peñarol's best {{victory was}} a 9–0 win against Rampla Juniors in 1962; its <b>worst</b> defeat <b>was</b> 0–6 against Nacional. On the {{international}} scene, its best result was an 11–2 win over Valencia of Venezuela on 15 March 1970; its <b>worst</b> <b>was</b> against Olimpia of Paraguay, a 0–6 loss on 10 December 1990 during the Supercopa Sudamericana.|$|R
2500|$|In May 2008, The Wall Street Journal {{wrote that}} Paulson said U.S. {{financial}} markets are {{emerging from the}} credit crunch that many economists believe has pushed {{the country to the}} brink of recession. [...] "I do believe that the <b>worst</b> <b>is</b> likely to be behind us," [...] Paulson told the newspaper in an interview.|$|E
2500|$|In [...] "Devaduta Sutta", the 130th {{discourse}} of the Majjhima Nikaya, Buddha teaches about hell in vivid detail. Buddhism teaches that there are five (sometimes six) realms of rebirth, which can then be further subdivided into degrees of agony or pleasure. Of these realms, the hell realms, or Naraka, is the lowest realm of rebirth. Of the hell realms, the <b>worst</b> <b>is</b> Avīci or [...] "endless suffering". The Buddha's disciple, Devadatta, who tried to kill the Buddha on three occasions, as well as create a schism in the monastic order, {{is said to have}} been reborn in the Avici Hell.|$|E
2500|$|Hume {{studied the}} works of, and corresponded with, [...] Francis Hutcheson, {{and it was}} he who first {{introduced}} a key utilitarian phrase. In An Inquiry into the Original of Our Ideas of Beauty and Virtue (1725), Hutcheson says when choosing the most moral action, virtue is in proportion to the number of people a particular action brings happiness to. In the same way, moral evil, or vice, is proportionate to the number of people made to suffer. The best action is the one that procures the greatest happiness of the greatest numbers—and the <b>worst</b> <b>is</b> the one that causes the most misery.|$|E

2500|$|The {{character}} {{is described as}} having [...] "always been a good girl, but when her parents head back to Nigeria she feels abandoned." [...] Mojekwu described the character as [...] "very strong-willed and bound within her faith. Her best attribute is that she's very motherly and takes people under her wing to look after them. Her <b>worst</b> <b>is</b> that she takes the world on her shoulders and {{you just want to}} tell her, 'You don't have to worry about , you can't deal with it alone'. Mercy takes too much on." [...] The character often wears a yellow jacket and has a red hair weave, which Mojekwu said, [...] "didn't look too great".|$|E
2500|$|After {{the initial}} {{friction}} while at college, Saunders and French shared a flat together. French has remarked on Saunders's messy habits when sharing the house, stating, [...] "When we lived together in Chalk Farm, {{she had a}} room {{at the top of the}} house. We got broken into and the police said, 'Well, it is quite bad, but the <b>worst</b> <b>is</b> that room at the top.' And, of course, nobody had been in there." [...] The two performed together after graduation, working the festival, cabaret, and stand-up circuits. They formed a double-act called The Menopause Sisters. Saunders described the act, which involved wearing tampons in their ears, as [...] "cringeworthy." [...] The manager of the club where they performed recalled, [...] "They didn't seem to give a damn. There was no star quality about them at all." ...|$|E
2500|$|But in 1950, on his seventy-sixth birthday, an astrologer wrote Schoenberg a note warning {{him that}} the year was a {{critical}} one: 7 + 6 = 13 (Nuria Schoenberg-Nono, quoted in [...] ). This stunned and depressed the composer, for {{up to that point}} he had only been wary of multiples of 13 and never considered adding the digits of his age. He died on Friday, 13 July 1951, shortly before midnight. Schoenberg had stayed in bed all day, sick, anxious and depressed. His wife Gertrud reported in a telegram to her sister-in-law Ottilie the next day that Arnold died at 11:45pm, 15 minutes before midnight [...] In a letter to Ottilie dated 4 August 1951, Gertrud explained, [...] "About a quarter to twelve I looked at the clock and said to myself: another quarter of an hour and then the <b>worst</b> <b>is</b> over. Then the doctor called me. Arnold's throat rattled twice, his heart gave a powerful beat and that was the end" [...]|$|E

5000|$|A {{dramatic}} {{account of}} what Thorp described as [...] "the <b>worst</b> <b>was</b> to come" [...] is given in William James' The Naval History of Great Britain, Vol. 1 ...|$|R

2500|$|As {{casualties}} mounted {{and success}} seemed further away than ever, Johnson's popularity plummeted. College students and others protested, burned draft cards, and chanted, [...] "Hey, hey, LBJ, {{how many kids}} did you kill today?" [...] Johnson could scarcely travel anywhere without facing protests, and was not allowed by the Secret Service to attend the 1968 Democratic National Convention, where thousands of hippies, yippies, Black Panthers and other opponents of Johnson's policies both in Vietnam and in the ghettos converged to protest. Thus by 1968, the public was polarized, with the [...] "hawks" [...] rejecting Johnson's refusal to continue the war indefinitely, and the [...] "doves" [...] rejecting his current war policies. Support for Johnson's middle position continued to shrink until he finally rejected containment and sought a peace settlement. By late summer, he realized that Nixon was closer to his position than Humphrey. He continued to support Humphrey publicly in the election, and personally despised Nixon. One of Johnson's well known quotes was [...] "the Democratic party at its <b>worst,</b> <b>is</b> still better than the Republican party at its best".|$|E
2500|$|... "Everyone Will Die" [...] ("a {{celebration of}} life, not {{necessarily}} a death song," [...] said Pierre) was first recorded as a scratch demo on the band's tour bus, and the original vocal track from that recording was kept for the album version, as it represented the emotion the band were striving for. A string section was employed for the bridge. [...] "Having real strings was like {{a dream come true}} for me. I've always wanted to arrange parts, and I finally got to," [...] said Taylor. [...] "The Coma Kid" [...] relates to procrastination: [...] "The Coma Kid...somebody who's unable to 'do.' Somebody who's thinking of 'doing,' but not actually 'doing.'" [...] The song was described as a throwback of sorts to [...] "Modern Chemistry", a track from the band's debut, I Am The Movie. [...] "Boxelder" [...] was written uniquely, in an attempt to break songwriting routine; as a result, the song switches between time signatures, going from seven to four-four during the chorus. [...] "A boxelder needs the tree to live, because they infest the trees, but for them to live they end up killing the tree, and [...] relates that to a relationship, which I think is very interesting," [...] said Johnson. [...] "The <b>Worst</b> <b>Is</b> Yet to Come" [...] dates as far back as 2009, and was recorded in the span of one day. Tony Thaxton was not involved in the initial writing due to an arm infection, which also was an issue in the recording process of My Dinosaur Life. Because of his absence, Claudio Rivera of Saves the Day stood in as the drummer for the original demo; Thaxton's drum part was developed later and is present on the album. Likewise, [...] "Bad Ideas" [...] is the oldest song on the album, first attempted during sessions for 2005's Commit This to Memory.|$|E
6000|$|... "Keep up your courage," [...] I replied. [...] "The <b>worst</b> <b>is</b> over, I'm certain. This storm wouldn't appear so bad {{if we were}} on shipboard." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Say they renew for the {{additional}} six months. Would it put you about very much Madam if--if the <b>worst</b> <b>was</b> {{to come to}} the worst?" [...] said the Major.|$|R
6000|$|... "E'en {{marry the}} lass--make her Leddy Glenvarloch.--Ay, ay, ye may start--but it's the {{course you are}} driving on. Rather marry than do worse, if the <b>worst</b> <b>be</b> not done already." ...|$|R
50|$|According to The Netherlands Institute for Art History (the RKD) <b>Worst</b> <b>was</b> in Rome from 1645-1650, and in France in 1655-1656. He {{is known}} today for his {{landscape}} drawings of ruins.|$|R
