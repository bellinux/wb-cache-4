50|$|Woodturning is {{the craft}} of using the <b>wood</b> <b>lathe</b> with {{hand-held}} tools to cut a shape that is symmetrical around the axis of rotation. Like the potter's wheel, the <b>wood</b> <b>lathe</b> is a simple mechanism which can generate a variety of forms. The operator {{is known as a}} turner, and the skills needed to use the tools were traditionally known as turnery. In pre-industrial England, these skills were sufficiently difficult to be known as 'the misterie' of the turners guild. The skills to use the tools by hand, without a fixed point of contact with the wood, distinguish woodturning and the <b>wood</b> <b>lathe</b> from the machinists lathe, or metal-working lathe.|$|E

50|$|The {{years from}} 1960 saw the company grow with the {{introduction}} of a range of machinery for the 'Do it yourself' market and educational training. The range included thicknessers, circular saws, planers, bandsaws and <b>wood</b> <b>lathes.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{forms of}} workholding on lathes were between-centers holding and ad hoc fastenings to the headstock spindle. The spike-style centers still used on <b>wood</b> <b>lathes</b> represent an ancient method. Ad hoc fastening methods in centuries past included anything from pinning with clenching or wedging; nailing; lashing with cords of leather or fiber; dogging down (again involving pinning/wedging/clenching); or other types. Faceplates {{have probably been}} around {{at least since the}} era of medieval clock-makers.|$|R

According to the Minneapolis Heritage Preservation Commission,the original Italian mosaic on the main entrance floor, ornate brass fittings, painted murals on the ceilings and walls, light fixtures, and the staircase woodcarvings that were done on a hand-peddled <b>wood</b> <b>lathe</b> can still be seen inside the mansion today.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the process}} known as Reifendrehen (literally [...] "tyre turning") a {{suitable}} piece of wood, {{as far as possible}} free of splits, is worked on a special <b>wood</b> <b>lathe</b> to produce a wooden ring with a diameter of about 30 to 50 centimetres, the cross-section of which forms the outline of the desired figure. Small slices are then sawn off the ring. These are used as the raw material from which the finished figures are made by carving and painting.|$|E
50|$|A treadle OE tredan, {{is a part}} of {{a machine}} which is {{operated}} by the foot to produce reciprocating or rotary motion in a machine such as a weaving loom (reciprocating) or grinder (rotary). Treadles {{can also be used to}} power water pumps (as in the treadle pump), or to turn <b>wood</b> <b>lathes</b> (as in the pole lathe). In the past, treadles have been used to power a range of machines including sewing machines, looms, wood saws, cylinder phonographs and metal lathes. Along with cranks, treadmills, and treadwheels, they allowed human and animal power of machinery in the absence of electric machinery.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Wood</b> <b>lathes</b> {{work with}} either {{reciprocating}} or continuous revolution. The reciprocating lathe {{is powered by}} a bow or a spring, rotating the wood first in one direction, and then in the other. The turner cuts on just one side of the rotation, as with the pole lathe. The reciprocating lathe may be human-powered with a bow, as well as with spring mechanisms. The reciprocating lathe, while primitive technology requiring considerable dexterity to operate, is capable of excellent results in skilled hands. For example, reciprocating bow lathes are still used to turn beads for the Arabian lattice windows called Meshrebeeyeh that so charmed Holtzapffel in the 1880s [...]|$|R

50|$|Harriette Vyda Simms {{was born}} in West Palm Beach, Florida on June 19, 1902, to David Ira Simms (a <b>wood</b> <b>lathe</b> worker) and Annie (Warren) Simms. She had sisters Valerie and Mae, and {{brothers}} George, Arnold, Rupert and David, Jr. The family relocated to Mims, Florida. As a youth, Harriette spent summers working in Massillon, Ohio with her father. Simms attended the segregated Daytona Normal Industrial Institute in Daytona Beach, Florida. She later graduated from Bethune-Cookman College, a historically black college in Daytona Beach, with an associate of arts degree in 1941 and a bachelor of science degree in 1950.|$|E
50|$|Used to make {{a pattern}} for foundries, often from wood, but also plastics. A patternmaker's lathe looks like a heavy <b>wood</b> <b>lathe,</b> often with a turret and either a {{leadscrew}} or a rack and pinion to manually position the turret. The turret is used to accurately cut straight lines.They often have a provision to turn very large parts {{on the other end}} of the headstock, using a free-standing toolrest. Another way of turning large parts is a sliding bed, which can slide away from the headstock and thus open up a gap in front of the headstock for large parts.|$|E
50|$|At {{the height}} of Viking {{expansion}} into Dublin and Jorvik 875-954 AD the longship reached a peak of development such as the Gokstad ship 890. Archaeological discoveries from this period at Coppergate, York, show the shipwright had a large range of sophisticated woodwork tools. As well as the heavy adze, broad axe, wooden mallets and wedges, the craftsman had steel tools such as anvils, files, snips, awls, augers, gouges, draw knife, knives, including folding knives, chisels and small 300 mm long bow saws with antler handles. Edged tools were kept sharp with sharpening stones from Norway. One {{of the most sophisticated}} tools was a 25 mm diameter twist drill bit, perfect for drilling holes for treenails. Simple mechanical pole <b>wood</b> <b>lathes</b> were used to make cups and bowls.|$|R
50|$|A {{major new}} line in toy manufacturing, {{which began in}} the Ore Mountains, was the {{production}} of wooden toys on <b>wood</b> <b>lathes</b> using a method known as Reifendrehen. This method, usually used for making wooden animals, allowed for greater accuracy and quality in much less time than it took to hand carve the entire piece. In 1890, an export tax was changed from being based on value, to weight. This meant that wooden toys were now much more expensive to buy anywhere but the German state of Saxony. Undaunted, the Seiffen toy makers developed the Miniature in a Matchbox. This ornament sized toy was very small, so it could be exported cheaply. It also used many parts and is very detailed. The Ore Mountain Toy Museum is an internationally known toy museum that displays a large collection of typical Ore Mountain wooden toys and similar items.|$|R

50|$|In {{the craft}} of woodturning, a banjo is a common term for a fixture on the <b>wood</b> <b>lathe,</b> mounted on the lathe's bed, for holding the toolrest. It allows for {{adjustment}} of the toolrest in various positions, by the lathe operator, {{making it possible to}} hold the turning tool in the most convenient position for removing material from the spinning wood. The chosen position of the fixture can be locked in place on the lathe's bed in various ways, the most common method being a lever at the forward end of the fixture which acts upon an eccentric shaft with an attached clamp to secure the fixture to the lathe's bed.|$|E
50|$|Items made on {{the lathe}} include tool handles, candlesticks, egg cups, knobs, lamps, rolling pins, {{cylindrical}} boxes, Christmas ornaments, bodkins, knitting needles, needle cases, thimbles, pens, chessmen, spinning tops; legs, spindles and pegs for furniture; balusters and newel posts for architecture; baseball bats, hollow forms such as urns or sculptures; bowls, platters, and chair seats. Industrial production has replaced many of these products from the traditional turning shop. However, the <b>wood</b> <b>lathe</b> is still used for decentralized production of limited or custom turnings. A skilled turner can produce {{a wide variety of}} objects with five or six simple tools. The tools can be reshaped easily for the task at hand. In many parts of the world, the lathe has been a portable tool that goes to the source of the wood, or adapts to temporary workspaces. 21st-century turners restore furniture, continue folk-art traditions, produce custom architectural work, and create fine craft for galleries. Woodturning appeals to people who like to work with their hands, find pleasure in problem-solving, or enjoy the tactile and visual qualities of wood.|$|E
50|$|Saturday, 11 February 1989 at 17:42 PMCompany 38 {{rolled up}} to find roughly 1/2 of an {{abandoned}} “U”shaped one-story elementary school with fire through the roof. Theold building, located at 2455 Bankhead Highway NW in the CenterHill neighborhood, had been vacant {{for several years and}} was for saleby the Board of Education. Vandals had stripped the building ofwiring and piping and most of the windows were broken out. Manyholes were punched in the plaster on <b>wood</b> <b>lathe</b> walls in the olderportions of the building so fire moved very rapidly. The originalbuilding formed the bottom of the “U” and some tough firefightingsaved the legs of the “U” due to the change in construction from thewood frame with brick veneer of the original building to block wallsand a Tectum roof deck over the newer sections. The lack of woodin the roof design slowed the fire slightly and gave the respondingcompanies time to get lines laid and make a stand. Eventually theincident grew to a Three Alarm Fire including Automatic Aid fromFulton County Company 11. Control was gained at 19:07 aftertwo Ladder Pipes, four deluge guns and numerous hand lines wereoperated. Firefighter Fairus Elder of Company 16 injured a kneeduring overhaul operations.

5000|$|Kijiya (lit. woodworker) are Japanese woodworkers {{particularly}} {{known as}} woodturners for their lathe-produced kokeshi dolls or lacquered goods. They are attested from the medieval period, claiming descent from the oldest son of Emperor Montoku, Prince Koretage (844-897), whom they credit with {{the invention of}} the <b>wood</b> <b>lathe</b> (rokuro). Originally the kijiya occupied the more populous parts of central and southern Japan and are said to originate from a single village, Higashi-Ogura, in Kanzaki District, Shiga Prefecture, leading them to take on the surname, [...] "Ogura". As migrant minority group they moved about in groups of a few families, collecting wood in the mountains. Contact between these groups was achieved through two shrines, enshrining the legendary princely ancestor. Shrine officials traveled through the country, collecting contributions and handing out licenses for collecting wood and for pursuing their profession. In 1872, 1536 families were managed by one of these shrines. In the course of the Meiji Restoration the kijiya lost the right to collect wood and had to abandon their migratory lifestyle, settling in villages where they worked in furniture or lacquerware producing companies, or became farmers or charcoal makers. As late as 1939, small kijiya communities were reported in Fukushima Prefecture, though it is assumed that only individuals of these groups survive today, mainly in mountains and villages of Tohoku.|$|E
50|$|Complex forms {{made on a}} <b>wood</b> <b>lathe</b> develop from {{surprisingly}} few {{types of}} cuts: parting, planing, bead, cove, and hollowing. Parting separates the wood from the holding device, or establishes depth cuts. Planing is done with a tool in which the bevel below the cutting edge supports wood fibers, just as in a typical wood planer. Beads are a convex shape relative to the cylinder, and coves are a concave shape. Hollowing techniques are a combination of drilling and scooping out materials. The woodturner is at liberty to choose {{from a variety of}} tools for all of these techniques, {{and the quality of the}} cuts improves with practice wielding the tool selected. Turners rely upon three points of contact making any type of cut: the tool presses down on the tool rest, and against the woodturner's body before contacting the surface of the wood, most often with a bevel edge riding the surface of the wood. The objective is to position the tool correctly so that the wood comes around to the cutting edge, generating a thin shaving without chipping or tearing out sections of the wood. Woodturners prefer to use very clean cuts to minimize the time spent with abrasives. When it is necessary to sand the piece, they do so on the lathe, using abrasives held by hand, in an inertial sander which revolves with the wood's own rotation, or with power tools—drills or right-angle drills. The lathe also becomes a useful holding device for carving, burning, texturing, coloring, and finishing the form.|$|E
