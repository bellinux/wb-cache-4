5|$|Despite {{is little}} success, the film series <b>would</b> <b>still</b> {{have a major}} impact on the actors' careers. Granville and Litel would later co-star in The Guilty, while Thomas would later appear in an {{unsuccessful}} television pilot based on the films, albiet this time as Carson Drew.|$|E
5|$|He died in {{the palace}} of the former bishops of Bamberg, Germany, and {{was buried in the}} Theatiner Church in Munich. During his retirement, he <b>would</b> <b>still</b> wear the Greek {{traditional}} uniform, nowadays worn only by the evzones (Presidential Guards).|$|E
5|$|Heinrich {{also notes}} the {{possibility}} that national parliaments could appoint citizen representatives to the UNPA, similarly to how the U.S. Electoral College officially selects the President. This would be a stopgap solution until direct election became possible. Yet it <b>would</b> <b>still</b> ensure that citizens would be electing citizens (albeit indirectly), rather than the executive appointing officials, to the UNPA.|$|E

Indeed, {{it is more than}} probable that without her protectionist commercial policy England would never have attained to such a large measure of municipal and individual freedom as she now possesses, for such freedom is the daughter of industry and wealth.|$|R
5|$|Hengistbury <b>would</b> <b>still</b> {{have served}} as an {{important}} hub for the Dumnonii of Cornwall and Devon, and the Durotriges of Wiltshire and Dorset; since transport by water was more efficient at the time, and the Head offered both a coastal route, and freshwater options via the Stour and Avon rivers.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, McCaw and Dan Carter {{were on a}} NZ$750,000 a year {{contract}} that saw them {{through to the end}} of the 2011 Rugby World Cup, making them the highest paid rugby players in New Zealand at the time. This contract <b>would</b> <b>still</b> have applied if they had not been selected for the World Cup squad.|$|E

5|$|Robert Fletcher {{served as}} costume {{designer}} for the film. During the Earth-based scenes, Kirk {{and his crew}} continue to wear their 23rd-century clothing.

5|$|Written by Robert Holmes, this storyline was {{considered}} {{in the autumn of}} 1976 when it was assumed Hinchcliffe <b>would</b> <b>still</b> be producing Season 15. It was to have been inspired by Joseph Conrad's novel Heart of Darkness.|$|E
5|$|Although {{a distant}} planet such as Planet Nine would reflect little light, it <b>would</b> <b>still</b> be {{radiating}} {{the heat from}} its formation as it cools due to its large mass. At its estimated temperature of 47 K, the peak of its emissions would be at infrared wavelengths. This radiation signature could be detected by Earth-based infrared telescopes, such as ALMA, and a search could be conducted by cosmic microwave background experiments operating at mm wavelengths. Additionally, Jim Green of NASA is optimistic {{that it could be}} observed by the James Webb Space Telescope, the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope, that is expected to be launched in 2019.|$|E
5|$|Beato, who {{had covered}} {{military}} operations in India and China, was probably attracted by {{the news of the}} annexation. While he arrived in Burma after the main military operations ended, he <b>would</b> <b>still</b> get {{to see more of the}} action, as the annexation by the British led to an insurgency which lasted for the following decade. This allowed Beato to take a number of pictures of British military in operations or at the Royal Palace, Mandalay, as well as insurgency soldiers and prisoners.|$|E

5|$|Besides his two Emmy Awards and six Annie Awards for SpongeBob SquarePants, Hillenburg {{has also}} {{received}} other recognition, {{such as an}} accolade from Heal the Bay for his efforts on elevating marine life awareness, and the Television Animation Award from the National Cartoonists Society. Despite this, he {{has been involved in}} public controversies, including one that was centered on speculation over the SpongeBob character's intended sexual orientation, and a lawsuit that was filed against him. Hillenburg has been diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in 2017, but stated that he <b>would</b> <b>still</b> continue to work on his show.|$|E
5|$|Blomkamp {{declared}} the project dead in late 2007, but Jackson replied {{that the film}} <b>would</b> <b>still</b> be made. Blomkamp and Jackson collaborated on District 9, but the director told /Film {{that he was no}} longer considering working on a Halo film if the opportunity arose, saying that after working on the film for five months before the project's collapse {{it would be difficult to}} return. The rights for the film have since reverted to Microsoft.|$|E
5|$|FIFA {{president}} Jules Rimet intervened, {{and eventually}} four European teams {{made the trip}} by sea: Belgium, France, Romania, and Yugoslavia. The Romanians, managed by Constantin Rădulescu and coached by their captain Rudolf Wetzer and Octav Luchide, entered the competition following the intervention of newly crowned King CarolII. He selected the squad personally, and negotiated with employers {{to ensure that the}} players <b>would</b> <b>still</b> have jobs upon their return. The French entered at the personal intervention of Rimet, but neither France's star defender Manuel Anatol nor the team's regular coach Gaston Barreau could be persuaded to make the trip. The Belgians participated at the instigation of German-Belgian FIFA vice-president Rodolphe Seeldrayers.|$|E

5|$|For instance, {{if he had}} 100,000 strings {{worth of}} gold and silver and used this money to buy {{productive}} property, in a year he would gain 10,000 strings; after ten years or so, he would have regained the 100,000 strings {{and what would be}} divided among the family would be interest. If it were invested in a pawn broking business, in three years the interest would equal the capital. He <b>would</b> <b>still</b> have the 100,000 strings, and the rest, being interest, could be divided. Moreover, it could be doubled again in another three years, ad infinitum.|$|E
5|$|If White is {{compelled}} to play Nb1–d2, {{it is sometimes}} a minuscule positional concession, as it {{makes it harder for}} this knight to reach its ideal square d5. However, if Black is later {{compelled to}} exchange Bxd2, that is advantageous to White who thereby gains the bishop pair. Besides, in some situations the Bb4 could be as misplaced as the Nd2. Finally, if White has to play Bd2, then Black should exchange the bishops only if White is forced to recapture with the Nb1, as a recapture by the Qd1 <b>would</b> <b>still</b> allow the Nb1 to reach the d5-square through Nb1–c3–d5.|$|E
5|$|In 1954, Luang Pu Sodh made an {{announcement}} {{that he would}} die soon, and instructed his students to continue their duties without him, especially to propagate Dhammakaya meditation. Two years later, {{he was diagnosed with}} hypertension. Luang Pu Sodh died in 1959. His body was not cremated, but embalmed, so that after his death people <b>would</b> <b>still</b> come and support Wat Paknam. In Wat Phra Dhammakaya a memorial hall was built in honor of Luang Pu Sodh, and in Wat Paknam, a charity foundation was started in his name.|$|E
