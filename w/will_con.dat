40|$|When {{investigating}} {{the change in}} a biomarker, it is often believed {{that at least two}} measurements are needed from each participant, and that those with only one measurement should be excluded. In this short note, we explain why this could lead to imprecise and biased estimates. Furthermore, we discuss a standard statistical method that handles such issues. One of the five basic postulates of Euclidean geom-etry is that one can draw a straight line between any two points. 1 Therefore, intuitively two (or more) measurements seem essential in order to investigate the change in a biomarker. This note illustrates how this simple intuition fails, leading to imprecise and biased results in common situations. We <b>will</b> <b>con...</b>|$|E
40|$|Historically, {{researchers}} have studied bacterial signaling {{as if it}} functioned {{as a set of}} isolated, linear pathways. More recent studies, however, have demonstrated that many signaling path-ways interact and that these interacting pathways should be construed as an intricate network. This network integrates diverse signals, both extracellular and intracellular, to ensure that the the correct amount of the appropriate subset of genes is expressed at the proper time. Complete delineation of this complex signal transduction network and use of the network to predict the full range of cellular behaviors are major goals of systems biology. Despite considerable progress, we remain near the begin-ning of this process, which thus far has been dominated by the development of enabling technologies and the compilation of gene lists.

40|$|Diffusion {{problems}} under singular perturbations of {{the domain}} or the boundary conditions are analyzed. The first {{problem that we}} consider is the diffusion of a material from a domain that is nearly impermeable, having only several small patches on the boundary where the material can slowly leak out. The second problem that is studied is the diffusion of a material that originates from some localized regions in a two or three-dimensional domain. Steady-state solutions and the long-time behavior of solutions are analyzed in detail. Finally, the analysis is extended to determine the change in bifurcation values associated with nonlinear diffusion equations under singular perturbations of the domain. The results are then applied to a model in resource management. 1 Introduction In this paper we study linear diffusion problems under different types of localized perturbations of a domain or the conditions on the boundary of a domain.

The Wagner Act of 1935 and union contracts provide some protection for employees. In addition, public employees enjoy constitu tional and statutory safeguards. But about 70 {{percent of the total}} labor force still has no guarantee against arbitrary action by employers. A most significant development of the past decade has been increasing judicial modification of the at-will principle to prevent grosser abuses. Civil rights legislation has outlawed job discrimination based on race, sex, religion, national origin, and age. Other statutes have been enacted to promote the physical safety and economic well-being of workers. Nevertheless, volunta rism remains the distinctive characteristic of American labor relations. Not even an employer's legitimate regard for profit making or the public's justified concern for a productive economy should totally override the workers' claim to a voice in the decisions of ongoing enterprises that will vitally affect their future job opportunities.

These methods were {{applied for the}} mathematical simulation of the mass transfer process in multilayered underground systems. A specific feature of these problems {{is that it is}} necessity to solve the 3 -D initial-boundary-value problems for parabolic type partial differential equations of second order with piece-wise parameters in multilayer domain. Therefore here an effective finite-difference method for solving a problem of the above type is developed. This method may be considered as a generalization of the method of finite volumes [3] for the layered systems. In the case of constant piece-wise coefficients we obtain the exact discrete approximation of steady-state 1 -D boundary-value problem. This procedure allows to reduce the 3 -D problem to a system of 2 -D problems and the 2 -D problem to a system of 1 -D problems. 1.

40|$|We are {{now well}} into {{the second year of}} the separ ation of {{purchaser}} and provider functions in the National Health Service. District health authorities as purchasers of services are required to assess the health care needs of their population (NHS Manage ment Executive, 199 la) and seek professional advice regarding both the need for, and the provision of, services. The NHS Management Executive acknowl edges that local clinicians in provider units <b>will</b> <b>con</b> tinue to make a major contribution to this advice (NHS Management Executive, 1991 b). Until recently clinical advice has taken the form of prioritised lists of clinical needs, usually generated through the local cogwheel medical advisory system. This system has not always favoured psychiatry. In the new role, district health authorities have been seeking advice in varying ways. Some districts have established a medical advisory committee, often including both local general practitioners and hospi tal consultants. The Director of Public Health, who is usually an executive member of a district health auth ority, remains a major source of medical advice to the authority. In many districts some degree of public consultation regarding priorities for expenditure will have occurred. Nevertheless, clear advice from local clinicians may well be sought by district health auth orities and it is essential for consultants to consider how best to present their advice to ensure that it is accepted by those authorities. In the past, such advice has often taken the form of detailed specifi cations, including staff, day places, in-patient beds, etc. for an 'ideal ' service. Such advice remains relevant but does require to be more specifically related to thedemography of the local population. The College's advice on services is available in Mental Health o...|$|E
