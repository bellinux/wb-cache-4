50|$|Asbestos {{was first}} mined at Woodsreef, {{on a site}} of 400 {{hectares}} also near Barraba, from 1919 to the 1980s. The Chrysotile Corporation of Australia carried out large-scale mining at the site from 1970 to 1983. The open-cut mine produced approximately 500,000 tonnes of chrysotile, or <b>white</b> <b>asbestos,</b> from 100 million tonnes of mined material.|$|E

5000|$|Blue {{asbestos}} {{is possibly}} 100 times more hazardous than <b>white</b> <b>asbestos,</b> as the fibres are much smaller (around 2.5 to 10 micrometres).The inhalation of asbestos results in illness {{and in most}} cases death, due to asbestosis, mesothelioma (of which asbestos is the only known cause) and other lung diseases. This aetiology was described, reported and explained to the management of ABA as well as being the subject of many medical journal articles.|$|E

Therefore old Artex manufactured by Artex Ltd. will contain asbestos while Artex coatings applied after 2000 {{may or may not}} contain asbestos. It is also worth noting that the texture is only harmful when in a powder form, i.e., being sanded, and poses no risk while it is undisturbed (without drilling holes or more substantial practices) on ceilings or walls and covered with emulsion paint.|$|E
50|$|The Devereaux {{house is}} a -story, {{octagonal}} frame structure with a hipped roof surmounted with an octagonal cupola. The house sits on a fieldstone foundation, and is symmetrially shaped with eight equal sides. A small utility room {{is attached to the}} rear of the structure. The house is clad with <b>white</b> <b>asbestos</b> siding and asphalt shingles on the roof. There is little ornamentation on the exterior or the interior. Interior rooms are generally rectangular in shape, with triangular closet space.|$|E
50|$|Chrysotile or <b>white</b> <b>asbestos</b> is {{the most}} {{commonly}} encountered form of asbestos, accounting for approximately 95% of the asbestos in the United States and a similar proportion in other countries. It is a soft, fibrous silicate mineral in the serpentine subgroup of phyllosilicates; as such, it is distinct from other asbestiform minerals in the amphibole group. Its idealized chemical formula is Mg(SiO)(OH). The material has physical properties which make it desirable for inclusion in building materials, but poses serious health risks when dispersed into air and inhaled.|$|E
50|$|The {{mine was}} first {{hit by the}} {{international}} drive {{against the use of}} asbestos. This saw the mine investing lots of money in marketing its type of asbestos <b>white</b> <b>asbestos</b> which is said to be kinder than the blue asbestos. Political interference then saw its major shareholder, Mutumwa Mawere, abandoning the mine and skipping the borders for South Africa where he is currently based. Effects of the Zimbabwean economic situation did not spare the struggling mine which led to mass exodus of its employees followed by the suspension of production.|$|E
5000|$|In the United Kingdom, {{blue and}} brown {{asbestos}} materials were banned outright in 1985 while the import, sale and second hand reuse of <b>white</b> <b>asbestos</b> was outlawed in 1999. The 2012 Control of Asbestos Regulations state that owners of non-domestic buildings (e.g., factories and offices) have a [...] "duty to manage" [...] asbestos {{on the premises}} by making themselves aware of its presence and ensuring the material does not deteriorate, removing it if necessary. Employers, e.g. construction companies, whose operatives may {{come into contact with}} asbestos must also provide annual asbestos training to their workers.|$|E
50|$|The two-story clapboard-sided frame {{structure}} rises from an exposed bluestone foundation. It is three bays long by six wide, in an L-shaped plan. The older, east-west-oriented block {{of the house}} has a square hipped roof with two large pedimented dormer windows with dentilled lintels on the east and south sides, with a smaller jerkin-roofed dormer complementing the eastern one. The newer wing designed by Grey and built by his brother has a rectangular hipped roof of gentler pitch with three small jerkined dormers. Both roofs are surfaced with diamond-shaped shingles of <b>white</b> <b>asbestos</b> cement and pierced by a single brick chimney per wing.|$|E
50|$|In early {{formulations}} {{it often}} contained <b>white</b> <b>asbestos</b> fibers. When asbestos was banned in ceiling treatments by the Clean Air Act of 1978 in the United States, popcorn ceilings {{fell out of}} favor {{in much of the}} country. However, in order to minimize economic hardship to suppliers and installers, existing inventories of asbestos-bearing texturing materials were exempt from the ban, so it is possible to find asbestos in popcorn ceilings that were applied through the 1980s. After the ban, popcorn ceiling materials were created using a paper-based or Styrofoam product to create the texture, rather than asbestos. Textured ceilings remain common in residential construction in the United States.|$|E
5000|$|In {{an article}} in May 2008, Booker again cited the Hodgson and Darnton paper, {{claiming}} that 'they concluded {{that the risk of}} contracting mesothelioma from <b>white</b> <b>asbestos</b> cement was [...] "insignificant", while that of lung cancer was [...] "zero"'. This article was also criticised by the HSE as [...] "substantially misleading", as well as by George Monbiot, who argued that Booker misrepresented the authors' findings. Booker's claims were also critically analysed by Richard Wilson in his book Don't Get Fooled Again (2008). Wilson highlighted Booker's repeated endorsement of the alleged scientific expertise of John Bridle, who in 2004 was convicted under the UK's Trade Descriptions Act of making false claims about his qualifications.|$|E
5000|$|The Secretary of the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education & Research (PGIMER, Chandigarh also voiced its opinion “Asbestos is {{definitely}} a harmful material, it causes cancer and other related diseases.” In their complete statement and recommendation to NHRC they have clearly expressed their concern: “White Asbestos (Chrysotile Asbestos) is implicated in so many studies with the following diseases:-Mesothelioma (Cancer of Pleura), Lung Cancer, Peritoneal Cancer, Asbestosis, and is also considered as a cause for Ovarian Cancer, Laryngeal Cancer, Other Cancererous Diseases are produced in the person involved in Asbestos Industry.” It concludes its position by specifying, “Hence, Use of <b>White</b> <b>Asbestos</b> should be completely banned in India and the same may be replaced by some safer alternative material.” ...|$|E
5000|$|Pleural {{contamination}} with asbestos {{or other}} mineral fibers {{has been shown}} to cause cancer. Long thin asbestos fibers (blue asbestos, amphibole fibers) are more potent carcinogens than [...] "feathery fibers" [...] (chrysotile or <b>white</b> <b>asbestos</b> fibers). [...] However, there is now evidence that smaller particles may be more dangerous than the larger fibers. They remain suspended in the air where they can be inhaled, and may penetrate more easily and deeper into the lungs. [...] "We probably will find out a lot more about the health aspects of asbestos from World Trade Center attack, unfortunately," [...] said Dr. Alan Fein, chief of pulmonary and critical-care medicine at North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System.|$|E
50|$|Diopside is a {{precursor}} of chrysotile (<b>white</b> <b>asbestos)</b> by hydrothermal alteration and magmatic differentiation; it can react with hydrous solutions of magnesium and chlorine to yield chrysotile by heating at 600 °C for three days. Some vermiculite deposits, most notably those in Libby, Montana, are contaminated with chrysotile (as {{well as other}} forms of asbestos) that formed from diopside. At relatively high temperatures, there is a miscibility gap between diopside and pigeonite, and at lower temperatures, between diopside and orthopyroxene. The calcium/(calcium+magnesium+iron) ratio in diopside that formed {{with one of these}} other two pyroxenes is particularly sensitive to temperature above 900 °C, and compositions of diopside in peridotite xenoliths have been important in reconstructions of temperatures in the Earth's mantle.|$|E
5000|$|Booker has {{repeatedly}} claimed that <b>white</b> <b>asbestos</b> is [...] "chemically identical to talcum powder" [...] and poses a [...] "non-existent" [...] risk to human health, relying primarily on a 2000 paper for the HSE by John Hodgson and Andrew Darnton. He wrote in January 2002 that [...] "HSE studies, including a paper by John Hodgson and Andrew Darnton in 2000, {{concluded that the}} risk from the substance is [...] "virtually zero". In response, the HSE's Director General, Timothy Walker, wrote that Booker's articles on asbestos had been [...] "misinformed and do little to increase public understanding of a very important occupational health issue." [...] The HSE issued further rebuttals to articles written by Booker in both 2005 and in 2006.|$|E
50|$|In February 2014, all 40 DLs {{were taken}} out of service for tests after samples from one {{locomotive}} tested positive for asbestos in a resin used for sound-proofing. In March 2014 KiwiRail reported that tests had shown small (5%) amounts of <b>white</b> <b>asbestos</b> in a soundproofing compound in five locomotives, with no asbestos in the remaining 34, and with no airborne asbestos or asbestos dust found. It was reported that the risk from asbestos was minimal and that levels of asbestos were insignificant. An asbestos removal plan was instigated and the first locomotive was returned to service in April 2014. The second generation locomotives were {{to be returned to}} service during April 2014, and were expected to have all asbestos removed over the following 12 months; the first generation units were to remain out of service until all asbestos containing materials were removed.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the first}} of these {{mixtures}} was produced by Rawlplug and was composed of dry <b>white</b> <b>asbestos</b> fibres, sold loose in a tin. The user wetted some into a ball (usually by spitting on them) and pushed this plug of putty into the hole. A small tamper and spike was supplied with the kit. This putty worked very well, but the hazard of the asbestos fibres means that the product is no longer available. However, another way to fix wall plugs is accomplished by the application of a cotton woven pad which has been impregnated with a special formulated gypsum to bond into the wall. The pad is wetted and wrapped around the wall plug, and the two are inserted into the hole; after a short time it hardens and a strong bond is achieved and the wall fitting can be applied. It is used in combination with wall plugs in masonry, ceramic, wood and plasterboard walls.|$|E
50|$|Asbestos is a {{naturally}} occurring group of silicate minerals that can readily be separated into thin strong fibres that are flexible, heat resistant and chemically inert. Within the United Kingdom {{and elsewhere in}} the world, asbestos was used extensively as a building material from the 1950s to the 1980s. It was used as a means of fireproofing as well as insulation and any building built before 2000 could contain asbestos. Although Asbestos can be safe if the material is kept in good condition and undisturbed, if damaged asbestos fibres could become airborne and cause serious risks to health if inhaled. Serious diseases including mesothelioma, lung cancer, and asbestosis could result if someone were to breathe in high levels of asbestos fibres. A particular risk if someone were to be working either on, or with, asbestos materials which had been damaged. There are six forms of Asbestos although only three are commonly used, these are Chrysotile (<b>white</b> <b>asbestos),</b> the most common; Amosite (brown asbestos) which can often be found in ceiling tiles and as a fire retardant in thermal insulation products; Crocidolite (blue asbestos), commonly used in high temperature applications.|$|E
5000|$|In 1917 the Mines Department first {{recorded}} {{the presence of}} blue asbestos in the Hamersley Ranges. Langley Hancock discovered Wittenoom Gorge on the Mulga Downs property in the early 1930s. In 1937 Langley (Lang) Hancock showed samples of blue asbestos crocidolite that he had picked-up in the Gorge to Islwyn (Izzy) Walters and Walter (Len) Leonard who were at that time mining and treating <b>white</b> <b>asbestos</b> at Nunyerrie and at Lionel near Nullagine. When Hancock learned the fibre would fetch £70 per ton he immediately pegged the best claims in Wittenoom Gorge. Leo Snell, a Kangaroo shooter on Mulga Downs pegged a claim on Yampire Gorge, {{where there was a}} lot more blue asbestos. Walters and Leonard purchased Yampire Gorge from Snell and moved their treatment plant there and began mining and treating the fibre. When Leonard cabled London that there was two miles of asbestos in sight at Yampire Gorge, they cabled him back saying he should take a holiday. Leonard had to send a photograph before it was believed Yampire Gorge contained this much asbestos. Walters and Leonard cleared the way into Yampire gorge by blasting the biggest rocks and pulling them out the way with a camel team. Even after that it took them seven hours to drive their lorry the fifteen miles from the workings to their treatment plant. By 1940, twenty-two men were employed at the Yampire Gorge workings and about 375 tons were mined and transported to the coast (Point Samson) by mule team wagons. During the war communications with England became difficult and de Berrales acquired an interest in the mines. Finally in 1943 the Colonial Sugar Company through its subsidiary, Australian Blue Asbestos Ltd. took over both the Wittenoom and Yampire Mines. Lang Hancock who watched his station property transform to a town stated (1958), [...] "Izzy Walters was the man who stuck it and produced the market that made Wittenoom of today possible. Walter's partner Len Leonard, put it this way (1958), [...] "But for his (Islwyn Walters) sheer grit and hard work there would be no such thing as Wittenoom. We have him to thank for that." ...|$|E
40|$|Associations between {{exposure}} to asbestos and {{carcinoma of the}} lung, diffuse mesothelioma of the pleura, and diffuse abdominal tumours have been demonstrated. Only by an epidemiological approach can the total risks of {{exposure to}} asbestos be estimated, and such a study is reported here.

James Hardie has always claimed that the working and living conditions of its Aboriginal employees were good. However, internal company correspondence and the testimony of miners suggest 14 otherwise.
