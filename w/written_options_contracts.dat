5000|$|To sell or [...] "go short" [...] an iron condor, the trader {{will buy}} (long) <b>options</b> <b>contracts</b> for the inner strikes using an out-of-the-money put and out-of-the-money call options.

50|$|Trader A ("A") has 500 {{shares of}} XYZ stock, valued at $10,000. A sells (<b>writes)</b> 5 call <b>option</b> <b>contracts,</b> bought by Investor B ("B") (in the US, 1 <b>option</b> <b>contract</b> covers 100 shares) for $1500. This premium of $1500 covers {{a certain amount}} of {{decrease}} in the price of XYZ stock (i.e. only after the stock value has declined by more than $1500 would the owner of the stock, A, lose money overall). Losses cannot be prevented, but merely reduced in a covered call position. If the stock price drops, it will not make sense for the option buyer ("B") to exercise the option at the higher strike price since the stock can now be purchased cheaper at the market price, and A, the seller (writer), will keep the money paid on the premium of the option. Thus, A's loss is reduced from a maximum of $10000 to - (premium), or $8500.|$|R
50|$|Another {{practical}} {{advantage of}} the iron condor {{is that if the}} spot price of the underlying is between the inner strikes {{towards the end of the}} <b>option</b> <b>contract,</b> the trader can avoid additional transaction charges by simply letting some or all of the <b>options</b> <b>contracts</b> expire. If the trader is uncomfortable, however, with the proximity of the underlying's spot price to one of the inner strikes and/or is concerned about pin risk, then the trader can close one or both sides of the position by first re-purchasing the <b>written</b> <b>options</b> and then selling the purchased options.|$|R
5000|$|Research of Nöldeke & Schmidt (1995) {{argued that}} the underinvestment problem due to the hold-up problem is {{eliminated}} if parties are able to <b>write</b> a simple <b>option</b> <b>contract.</b> Such a contract gives the seller the right but not the obligation to deliver a fixed quantity of the good and also makes the contractual payment of the buyer dependent on the delivery decision of the seller. Thus, this contract {{does not depend on}} renegotiation or complicated mechanisms, but its crucial feature {{is that one of the}} parties can unilaterally decide whether the trade takes place. However, such a contract is unachievable unless it is possible to enforce the payments conditional on the delivery decision of the seller. That means that the court must be able to verify delivery of the good to the buyer by the seller. [...] The possibility was ruled out in earlier research where it was assumed that when trade fails, it is not possible for the court to distinguish whether the buyer did not accept the delivery or the seller refused to supply.|$|R
40|$|There exist obvious {{changes in}} price and demand during the inflationary period, {{both of which}} are {{regarded}} as the key factors leading to supply chain uncertainty. In this paper, we focus our discussion on price increase and demand contraction caused by inflation, integrate the effect of inflation and <b>option</b> <b>contracts</b> within the model framework, and analyze how to use <b>option</b> <b>contracts</b> to achieve supply chain coordination under inflation scenarios. We consider a one-period two-stage supply chain consisting of one supplier and one retailer and explore the effect of inflation on the optimal ordering and production decisions under three different types of contracts: wholesale price <b>contracts,</b> <b>option</b> <b>contracts,</b> and portfolio contracts. Moreover, we explore the impact of <b>option</b> <b>contracts</b> on the supply chain through using wholesale price contracts model as the benchmark. We find that the retailer prefers adopting portfolio contracts, but the supplier prefers providing <b>option</b> <b>contracts</b> under inflation scenarios. Ultimately, <b>option</b> <b>contracts</b> will be implemented owing to the supplier’s market dominant position. In addition, we discuss the supply chain bilateral coordination mechanism with <b>option</b> <b>contracts</b> from the perspectives of two members and derive that <b>option</b> <b>contracts</b> can coordinate the supply chain and achieve Pareto improvement under inflation scenarios...|$|R

40|$|Water supply {{instability}} {{is one of}} {{the main}} risks faced by irrigation districts and farmers. Water procurement decision optimisation is essential in order to increase supply reliability and reduce costs. Water markets, such as spot purchases or water supply <b>option</b> <b>contracts,</b> can make this decision process more flexible. We analyse the potential interest in an <b>option</b> <b>contract</b> for an irrigation district that has access to several water sources. We apply a stochastic recursive mathematical programming model to simulate the water procurement decisions of an irrigation district?s board operating in a context of water supply uncertainty in south-eastern Spain. We analyse what role different <b>option</b> <b>contracts</b> could play in securing its water supply. Results suggest that the irrigation district would be willing to accept the proposed <b>option</b> <b>contract</b> in most cases subject to realistic values of the <b>option</b> <b>contract</b> financial terms. Of nine different water sources, desalination and the <b>option</b> <b>contract</b> are the main substitutes, where the use of either depends on the contract parameters.

40|$|This {{is number}} {{four in a}} series of six NebGuides on {{agricultural}} options. It explains how to evaluate <b>options</b> vs futures <b>contracts.</b> <b>Options</b> and futures <b>contracts</b> are similar. Both represent actions that occur in the future. Futures markets are contracts to either accept or deliver the actual physical commodity, while an <b>option</b> <b>contract</b> is a contract on the underlying futures <b>contract.</b> <b>Options</b> <b>contracts</b> give the farmer the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying commodity. This underlying commodity is a futures contract. Due to these similarities and the fact that options are based on a futures contract, producers may question the value of using an <b>options</b> <b>contract.</b> To make a decision between using a futures <b>contract</b> or an <b>options</b> <b>contract,</b> producers need to evaluate both alternatives...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} problem of the multiperiod {{replenishment}} decisions for the retailer under inflation. In order to manage the risks of price and demand caused by inflation, the retailer has an opportunity to order products and purchase options from the supplier in each period. We formulate the multiperiod inventory model for the retailer with <b>option</b> <b>contracts</b> and then derive his myopic ordering policy in each period and his myopic expected total discounted profit over the entire time horizon. By taking the case without <b>option</b> <b>contracts</b> as a benchmark, we explore the effect of <b>option</b> <b>contracts</b> on the retailer’s decisions and performance under inflation. We find that the application of <b>option</b> <b>contracts</b> might induce the retailer to reduce the firm order and increase the total order in each period under inflation. We also find that the application of <b>option</b> <b>contracts</b> might benefit the retailer under inflation...|$|R
