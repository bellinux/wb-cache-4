5|$|Although still {{a minimal}} {{tropical}} storm at the time, the CPHC anticipated Neki {{to become a}} hurricane as it tracked northwestward. As such, they issued a hurricane watch for Johnston Island {{on the afternoon of}} October19. The following day, the hurricane watch <b>was</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> tropical storm watch as Neki was no longer forecast to pass close enough to the island to produce hurricane-force winds. Later that day, a hurricane watch was issued for the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument for areas between the French Frigate Shoals and Lisianski Island. The following morning, a supplementary hurricane warning was issued for the monument for areas between the French Frigate Shoals and Nihoa. Additionally, the tropical storm watch for Johnston Island was discontinued. Early on October22, the hurricane watch for Lisianski Island to Marco Reef <b>was</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> tropical storm watch. Several hours later, the CPHC discontinued this watch. Early on October23, as Neki weakened to a tropical storm, the hurricane warning for areas between the French Frigate Shoals and Nihoa <b>was</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> tropical storm warning. The tropical storm warning remained in effect for more than a day before being canceled during the afternoon of October24.|$|E

25|$|Gradually, {{electrical}} reproduction {{entered the}} home. The spring motor <b>was</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> electric motor. The old sound box with its needle-linked diaphragm <b>was</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> electromagnetic pickup that converted the needle vibrations into an electrical signal. The tone arm now served {{to conduct a}} pair of wires, not sound waves, into the cabinet. The exponential horn <b>was</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> amplifier and a loudspeaker.|$|R

5|$|St. Anne Curtain – {{curtain wall}} linking St. Philip and St. Francis Bastions. It {{contained}} St. Anne's Gate, which <b>was</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> larger gate in 1859. The larger gate was also demolished in 1897 {{to facilitate the}} flow of traffic.|$|E
5|$|The 1964 Lexington Bridge {{across the}} Mississippi River <b>was</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> new bridge, built from 2001 to 2004, due to {{deterioration}} of the old structure including cracks in steel beams.

50|$|The OFC-3 {{system is}} modular design that {{comprises}} a laser range finder, a color TV camera, and an IR camera, and the laser range finder can <b>be</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> laser designator (for a laser beam-riding SAM), the TV camera can <b>be</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> night vision camera, and the IR camera can <b>be</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> ImIR, at higher cost. Development {{to incorporate the}} dual band IR, night vision camera, and the color TV camera is reportedly in progress.|$|R
5|$|During the ship's refit in January 1944, her {{electronics}} were modernized. The CXAM <b>was</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> SK {{model and}} the SC-1 <b>was</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> SC-3. The forward SG was supplemented <b>by</b> <b>an</b> additional SG-1 mounted on a short mast at the aft end of the funnel. A lengthier overhaul in mid-1944 provided the opportunity to revise the radar arrangements. The SK radar {{was moved to the}} rebuilt foremast and the forward SG radar <b>was</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> SG-1 mounted {{at the top of the}} foremast. An SM-1 fighter-control radar was mounted in the SK's former position and new antennas were added to the FD radars to allow them to determine target height. The SC-3 <b>was</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> SC-4 in early 1945.|$|R
5|$|The counterfort {{with the}} {{staircase}} was roofed with wooden boards and tin sheets in 1869.

5|$|The pitch at Twickenham <b>was</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> hybrid 'Desso' type, in June 2012, {{which uses}} {{artificial}} fibres entwined with real grass. This {{makes it a}} lot harder wearing in wet conditions.|$|E
5|$|A steel {{arch bridge}} {{was built in}} the 1950s over the Northeast Arm. It was named the East River Bridge. It <b>was</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> new bridge with the same name in December 2015. Sheet Harbour Consolidated School, an eleementary school, was built in 1957.

5|$|About 36hours {{prior to}} the {{hurricane}} making landfall, {{when it was still}} south of Cuba, the Miami Weather Bureau issued a hurricane alert for South Florida. About 18hours before landfall, the alert <b>was</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> hurricane warning. The advance warning time was believed to have prevented many deaths; however, the population was considered complacent with the warning, causing additional damage when they executed improper preparations, such as securing windows.|$|E
5|$|After 1964 the Kwajalein {{site was}} no longer {{required}} to be on alert, and returned primarily to Zeus testing. The system was kept active in a non-alert role between 1964 and 1967, known as Program 505. In 1967 it <b>was</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> Thor based system, Program 437. A total of 12 launches, including those at White Sands, were carried out {{as part of the}} 505 program between 1962 and 1966.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} Grand Central was completed, {{passenger}} trains approached the terminal by crossing the Chicago River {{to the southwest}} over a bridge between Taylor Street and Roosevelt Road, constructed in 1885.
