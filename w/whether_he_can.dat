5|$|The game {{begins with}} the Protagonist {{arriving}} in Tokyo {{to meet up with}} Chiaki and Isamu to visit Takao in a hospital. While in the city, the player learns of a confrontation between two cults which resulted in several deaths, and learns details of it from Hijiri when he meets them in the park where the event took place. Finding the hospital deserted apart from Chiaki and Isamu, the Protagonist searches it, is briefly accosted by Lucifer in his child form, and is almost killed by Hikawa. Saved from Hikawa by Takao, the Protagonist is taken by her to the hospital roof and witnesses the Conception, with Takao saying the resulting Vortex World will remain until the next creation is triggered. In the immediate aftermath, Lucifer contacts the Protagonist again and infuses him with a Magatama, wishing to see <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> lead his armies against the Great Will. This turns the Protagonist into the Demi-fiend, a being with the powers of a demon and the heart of a human. After escaping from the hospital, the Demi-fiend begins exploring the Vortex World with help from Hijiri. He learns of two cults who seek to remake the world in their image: Hikawa's Assembly of Nihilo, and a separate organization called the Mantra Army. Hikawa manages to destroy the Mantra Army, with Takao acting as his assistant.|$|E

Dr. Yealland uses electro-shock therapy to force patients to quickly recover from shell-shock; he believes that some patients {{do not want to}} be cured and that pain is the best method of treatment for such reluctant patients.

Soon Sassoon is released for combat duty; Willard is able to overcome his psychosomatic paralysis and walks again; Anderson is given a staff job.

25|$|During the 7th and 8th centuries, the Khazars {{fought a}} series of wars against the Umayyad Caliphate and its Abbasid successor. The First Arab-Khazar War began during {{the first phase of}} Muslim expansion. By 640, Muslim forces had reached Armenia; in 642 they {{launched}} their first raid across the Caucasus under Abd ar-Rahman ibn Rabiah. In 652 Arab forces advanced on the Khazar capital, Balanjar, but were defeated, suffering heavy losses; according to Persian historians such as al-Tabari, both sides in the battle used catapults against the opposing troops. A number of Russian sources give the name of a Khazar khagan from this period as Irbis and describe him as a scion of the Göktürk royal house, the Ashina. Whether Irbis ever existed is open to debate, as is <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> be identified with one of the many Göktürk rulers of the same name.|$|E

[...] After a hesitation Sparrow merrily replies, [...] "Yep! I'm good with it!" [...] He carelessly runs up debts with Anamaria, Davy Jones, and the other pirate lords. Sao Feng, pirate lord of Singapore, is particularly hateful towards him. In a cowardly moment, Sparrow abandons his crew during the Kraken's attack, but underlying loyalty and morality compel him to return and save them. Sparrow claims to be a man of his word, and expresses surprise that people doubt his truthfulness; there is no murder on his criminal record.|$|E

[...] And then some one of them would begin, and if every man's arms were as much relieved as mine by the song, and he could pull as much better as I did, with such a cheering accompaniment, I am sure the song was well worth the breath expended on it. It is a great thing in a sailor to know how to sing well, for he gets a great name by it from the officers, and a good deal of popularity among his shipmates. Some sea-captains, before shipping a man, always ask him <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> sing out at a rope.|$|E
