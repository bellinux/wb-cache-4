500|$|Negative reviews {{revolved}} around the theme's classic Bond sound. LAUNCHcast's James Poletti called the song a [...] "perfectly competent Bond theme", but [...] "the formula seems a little too easy. Perhaps {{they would have done}} better to rise to the challenge of doing something a little different, something a little more knowingly tongue-in-cheek." [...] Melody Maker stated, [...] "You know what this sounds like before you hear it. If the people in charge want Garbage, then <b>why</b> <b>not</b> <b>let</b> them do what Garbage do?" [...] In its review of Absolute Garbage, Pitchfork called the song a [...] "predictable 'Goldfinger' permutation signaling the band's limitless affinity for big-budget theatrics." ...|$|E
500|$|Historian E. Mary Smallwood {{wrote that}} good {{relations}} with the diaspora community did not mean that the Jews of Palestine were content with Zenobia's reign, and her rule was apparently opposed in that region. The Terumot tells the story of Rabbi [...] "Ammi" [...] and Rabbi [...] "Samuel bar Nahmani", who visited Zenobia's court and asked for the release of a Jew ("Zeir bar Hinena") detained on her orders. The queen refused, saying: [...] "Why have you come to save him? He teaches that your creator performs miracles for you. <b>Why</b> <b>not</b> <b>let</b> God save him?" [...] During Aurelian's destruction of Palmyra, Palestinian conscripts with [...] "clubs and cudgels" [...] (who may have been Jews) played a vital role in Zenobia's defeat and the destruction of her city.|$|E
500|$|Krankel and Hines {{looked at}} other story-focused games, {{and felt that}} they either were linear stories driven by set pieces, or branching, player choice-influenced stories [...] told through cut scenes. [...] "We thought, <b>why</b> <b>not</b> <b>let</b> you move freely while communicating, interacting, and {{exploring}} a branching narrative?" [...] Krankel recalled. [...] "The first thing {{we wanted to do}} is make a game where communication is really sort of a key mechanic, but that people have more freedom than they do with all the other narrative-focused games. At its core, we wanted to never have a cut scene in the game, where you could walk and move freely and communicate with your friends, and even communicate with other beings and other kind of strange things." [...] Rather than developing the gameplay and attaching a story to it, Night School focused on developing gameplay that would support the story they wanted to tell.|$|E

5000|$|Sting {{performed}} in Uzbekistan in 2009, giving his concert {{as part of}} the annual Art Week Style.Uz project initiated in 2006 by Karimova. Earlier, he had participated in an Yangi Avlod-arranged festival. After his concert, several commentators accused him of hypocrisy for playing in that country and supporting Karimova. The singer justified his action in an October 2010 interview, saying that there is no cultural embargo on Uzbekistan and [...] "if this were to happen, the Uzbek society would become more paranoid, more aggressive towards us. Art, journalism, business, circulation of ideasand I believe in the power of musicare all things that are good to countries with totalitarian regimes. As for Karimova, she will probably run the country one day, and is much more sensitive to culture. ... So <b>why</b> <b>not?</b> <b>Let's</b> leave the doors open." ...|$|R
