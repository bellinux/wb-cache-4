25|$|From a Maslownian perspective, Sarkar {{defends the}} need to meet {{physical}} and mental needs before being able {{to engage in a}} journey to find that transcendental nature of the world.

Fundamentally, progress in society is the effort through which communities engage in the fulfillment of human needs, with the goal of achieving a transcendental existence. As a goal, transcendence <b>will</b> <b>offer</b> <b>a</b> fourth bottom line which ideally would propel human society into a more peaceful, inclusive and all-round more progressive existence.|$|E

500|$|The 1997 state {{referendum}} {{stated that}} the stadium would feature a natural grass surface, but FieldTurf {{was not an option}} when the stadium was originally presented to voters according to the Public Stadium Authority. Seahawks management reconsidered surface after the Seahawks played on FieldTurf at Husky Stadium during the 2000 and 2001 seasons. Artificial turf was installed because it was easier to maintain than natural grass. The potential damage to a natural grass field caused by Seattle's frequent rain also made the surface an appealing option. In order to keep a grass surface robust under heavy football use during late fall and early winter rains, a $1.8million irrigation and heating system would have been required. The coach of the Seahawks at the time, Mike Holmgren, said FieldTurf installation was the right decision and stated that [...] "the players love it, and I think this surface <b>will</b> <b>offer</b> <b>a</b> better product on the field for the fans." ...|$|E
