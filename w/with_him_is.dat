5|$|Angela (Angela Kinsey) and Robert Lipton (Jack Coleman) {{are celebrating}} their son Phillip's first {{birthday}} with {{a gathering of}} wealthy political allies. Angela is shocked to learn that Robert invited his lover Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) to the party after she told Robert {{she did not want}} him there. Angela invites Dwight (her own extramarital lover) in retaliation, but he scorns the invitation. Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) hears of this and eagerly volunteers to go in Dwight's place. Oscar, who believes he was invited because Robert is in love <b>with</b> <b>him,</b> <b>is</b> hurt when he finds out that he was invited to boost Robert's opinion in the polls among Latino voters. During the taking of a group photo, Robert has Oscar stand in a spot where he almost completely blocks off Angela, and Oscar and Angela begin to bicker with each other. After the party, Robert rebukes them for their behavior and admonishes them to do better in the future. However, Kevin interrupts to tell Robert that he is a terrible person for treating Angela and Oscar strictly as a means to gain political support.|$|E

25|$|The loss is {{irreparable}} {{in every}} point of view: <b>with</b> <b>him</b> <b>is</b> gone all true philosophy, all publick virtue; {{there is nothing}} left but factious schemes and time-serving manoeuvres, contending one with the other, which shall do most mischief—not one English sentiment, not one statesmanlike idea—this is the publick loss. the private one is of everything that was warm, zealous, partial, where once he had placed his affections; for my own part, I feel it is the loss, not of a friend, but of a father; of one to whom I looked up for advice and instruction; and who gave them with the interest and fidelity of a parent.|$|E

25|$|Beginning with Frank Miller's run on Daredevil, his {{traditional}} rogues gallery {{was used}} less often, and The Kingpin became Daredevil's arch-enemy. Like the Purple Man, Death-Stalker, Assassin, and several others, the Kingpin has long known Daredevil's secret identity. His run as the series's central villain ended with issue #300, but {{he continues to}} menace Daredevil on occasion. Elektra made her debut as a bounty hunter, and though her time as part of Daredevil's rogues gallery was brief (spanning barely a year of the series), her romantic past <b>with</b> <b>him</b> <b>is</b> {{an important part of}} the mythos. In Daredevil #254, Ann Nocenti introduced Typhoid Mary, an assassin for the Kingpin with an identity disorder, who would become a prominent Daredevil foe.|$|E

500|$|Historians have {{expressed}} high regard for PedroII and his reign. The scholarly literature dealing <b>with</b> <b>him</b> <b>is</b> vast and, {{with the exception}} of the period immediately after his ouster, overwhelmingly positive, and even laudatory. Emperor PedroII is usually regarded by historians in Brazil as the greatest Brazilian. In a manner quite similar to methods which had been used by the republican politicians, historians point to the Emperor's virtues as an example to be followed, although none go so far as to advocate a restoration of the monarchy. [...] "Most twentieth-century historians, moreover, have looked back on the period [...] nostalgically, using their descriptions of the Empire to criticize—sometimes subtly, sometimes not—Brazil's subsequent republican or dictatorial regimes." ...|$|E

500|$|Blake's prophetic book [...] was {{especially}} influenced by On the Morning of Christ's Nativity. [...] In that poem, the messianic Orc, {{a symbol of}} pure creative energy, rises against the repressive institutions of Church and state. Orc {{is part of a}} doomed cycle- his rebellion is inevitably countered by the increased institutional repression of Urizen. Europe in that light is seen as a pessimistic parody of Milton's poem. Orc is often associated with fire, and the closest parallel <b>with</b> <b>him</b> <b>is</b> found in The Flight of Moloch, where a child is about to be given to the god of sacrifice. The similarity of the orifice that frames the child to the shape of the stable in the other illustrations underscores the purpose of Christ's birth, and foreshadows the harrowing of hell.|$|E
500|$|Murasaki {{disliked the}} men at court whom she thought to be drunken and stupid. However, some scholars, such as Waley, are certain she was {{involved}} romantically with Michinaga. At the least, Michinaga pursued her and pressured her strongly, and her flirtation <b>with</b> <b>him</b> <b>is</b> recorded in her diary as late as 1010. Yet, she wrote {{to him in a}} poem, [...] "You have neither read my book, nor won my love." [...] In her diary she records having to avoid advances from Michinaga—one night he sneaked into her room, stealing a newly written chapter of Genji. However, Michinaga's patronage was essential if she was to continue writing. Murasaki described his daughter's court activities: the lavish ceremonies, the complicated courtships, the [...] "complexities of the marriage system", and in elaborate detail, the birth of Shōshi's two sons.|$|E
500|$|Historians have {{expressed}} criticism for Brezhnev and his rule. The scholarly literature dealing <b>with</b> <b>him</b> <b>is</b> scarce and, {{with the exception}} of the period immediately after his death, overwhelmingly negative. Very little has been written about Brezhnev in English, and even Russian literature. According to Mark Sandle and Edwin Bacon, the authors behind Brezhnev Reconsidered, Brezhnev had attracted little attention from the media due to a consensus of his rule that was formed shortly after his death; literally that his rule was one primarily of stagnation. When Mikhail Gorbachev, the last Soviet leader, initiated perestroika he blamed the degradation of the Soviet economic and political system on Brezhnev, and called his rule the [...] "Era of Stagnation". Gorbachev claimed that Brezhnev followed [...] "a fierce neo-Stalinist line", although in a later statement Gorbachev made assurances that Brezhnev was not as bad as he was made out to be, saying, [...] "Brezhnev was nothing like the cartoon figure that is made of him now".|$|E

500|$|The {{character}} Astronaut Mike Dexter was referenced in this episode, {{in which}} Liz tells the dental receptionist {{that she did}} not sign the liability waiver as her [...] "boyfriend" [...] Mike Dexter would come and take her home. Liz considers the character to be her imaginary perfect husband. The character was first introduced in [...] "Sun Tea", in which [...] "Dot Com" [...] Slattery (Kevin Brown) pretended to be Mike Dexter, Liz's [...] "crazy black boyfriend", after she planned to get her roommate out of his apartment with Dot Com's help, but her plan backfired. In [...] "Dealbreakers Talk Show", Liz's imagination of Mike Dexter was played by actor John Anderson, in a scene where Liz fantasizes about what her life would be like following the success of her talk show, and is then notified by Mike Dexter that he has to go back to outer space. Astronaut Mike Dexter would be mentioned further in the season, but near its end Liz decides her infatuation <b>with</b> <b>him</b> <b>is</b> pathetic and [...] "breaks up" [...] with him in a dream; along with her S4 finale meeting of a pilot played by Matt Damon and her brusque breakup with and dismissal of an annoying anti-love interest played by Michael Sheen; this sets the stage for Liz Lemon to be portrayed as much less of a loser from Season 5 through the series finale.|$|E
500|$|Roosevelt did not {{at first}} respond to Long's claims, {{allegedly}} considering the author [...] "too small game to shoot twice." [...] He did, however, write to Burroughs that he had [...] "no quarrel with Mr. Long for the conclusions he draws from the facts. Our quarrel <b>with</b> <b>him</b> <b>is</b> because he invents the facts." [...] Burroughs proceeded to publicly defend the President against Long's attacks, condemning him and the expert witnesses Long produced to support his claims about the events and behaviors he depicted in his works. Newspapers around the country continuously published interviews with the two naturalists, while comedic depictions of the controversy and its participants were becoming popular with readers. One such parody referred to a non-existent book called How to Tell the Animals from the Wild Flowers, including an illustration which depicted an anthropomorphic [...] "Dandy Lion" [...] with a cane, top hat and monocle. This joke inspired a similarly satirical book, which was published under the title How to Tell the Birds from the Flowers; a collection of humorous illustrations and poems by physicist and children's author Robert Williams Wood, the work included pairings of birds and their corresponding flowers, emphasizing their visual similarities. Making a thinly veiled reference to the much publicized controversy surrounding those authors who were now called [...] "nature fakers", the book concludes: [...] "I have freely drawn upon / The works of Gray and Audubon, / Avoiding though the frequent blunders / Of those who study Nature's wonders." ...|$|E
500|$|By {{the end of}} 2006, Farah Khan's Happy New Year was shelved, and Khan had instead cast Padukone for the reincarnation melodrama Om Shanti Om (2007). Set {{against the}} {{backdrop}} of the Hindi film industry, the film tells the story of a struggling actor in the 1970s who dies soon after witnessing the murder of the woman he loved and is reincarnated to avenge her death. Shah Rukh Khan starred as the protagonist, and Padukone featured in dual rolesShantipriya, a leading actress of the 1970s, and later as Sandy, an aspiring actress. She said, [...] "I've grown up watching [...] and always admired him so much. To get to work <b>with</b> <b>him...</b> <b>is</b> quite wonderful. It was also fantastic that Farah showed faith in my talent and cast me opposite him." [...] In preparation for her role, Padukone watched several films of actresses Helen and Hema Malini to study their body language, which she felt [...] "were more graceful" [...] and [...] "completely different from today's actors." [...] However, her voice was dubbed by the voice artist Mona Ghosh Shetty. For one of the songs in the film, [...] "Dhoom Taana,” Padukone drew upon Indian classical dance, and according to Dorling Kindersley, [...] "mesmeriz audiences" [...] by using hasta mudras (hand gestures). Om Shanti Om was a commercial success, and emerged as the highest-grossing film of the year, with a global revenue of [...] Taran Adarsh of the entertainment portal Bollywood Hungama reviewed, [...] "Deepika has all it takes to be a top starthe personality, the looks and yes, she's supremely talented too.

2500|$|Turning away: [...] "Apostasy is also pictured as {{the heart}} turning away from God (Jeremiah 17:5-6) and righteousness (Ezekiel 3:20).
