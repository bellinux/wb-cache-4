2500|$|In May 2015, the Trump Foundation granted $10,000 to Project Veritas, {{a charity}} run by {{conservative}} filmmaker James O'Keefe. In October 2016, O'Keefe released video which purportedly reveals how Democrats incited violence at Trump rallies. During the third 2016 presidential debate, Trump claimed that new videos produced by O'Keefe and released that week proved that Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama had [...] "hired people" [...] and [...] "paid them $1,500" [...] to [...] "be violent, cause fights, [...] do bad things" [...] at Trump rallies. A Democratic National Committee spokesman noted Trump's donation after Project Veritas released another video on the 2016 presidential election. A Project Veritas spokesman responded by saying, [...] "We have a multi-million dollar {{budget and the}} cost of this video series alone is <b>way</b> <b>up</b> <b>there.</b> The donation Trump provided didn't impact our actions one way or the other." ...|$|E
2500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{wrote that}} Halloween II {{represented}} [...] "a fall from greatness" [...] that [...] "doesn't even {{attempt to do}} justice to the original." [...] He also commented, [...] "Instead, it tries to outdo all the other violent Halloween rip-offs of the last several years." [...] Web based critic James Berardinelli offered a particularly stinging review:The main problem is the film's underlying motivation. Halloween was a labor of love, made by people committed to creating the most suspenseful and compelling motion picture they could. Halloween II was impelled by the desire to make money. It was a postscript—and not a very good one—slapped together because a box office success was guaranteed. He accused Carpenter and Hill of not believing [...] "in this project the way they believed in the original, and it shows in the final product. The creepiness of the first movie {{has been replaced by a}} growing sense of repetitive boredom." [...] Berardinelli was not impressed by the decision to give Myers so much screen time. He says, [...] "The Shape, who was an ominous and forbidding force, has been turned into a plodding zombie. The characters have all been lobotomized, and, in keeping with the slasher trend, the gore content is <b>way</b> <b>up.</b> <b>There</b> was virtually no blood in Halloween; Halloween II cheerfully heaps it on." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My!" [...] exclaimed old Granny Fox, [...] "what splendid great wings you have, Mistah Buzzard! It must be grand {{to be able}} to fly. I {{suppose you}} can see a great deal from <b>way</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> in the blue, blue sky, Mistah Buzzard." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'd {{thought of}} that," [...] he {{answered}} stubbornly. [...] "I've got a taxicab {{waiting at the}} corner. Not often I treat myself to anything of that sort. I'm {{going to take you}} up to one of those parks in the West End we've paid so much for and see so little of, and when I get you there I'm going to talk to you. You can rest on the <b>way</b> <b>up.</b> <b>There's</b> a breeze blowing when you get out of these infernally hot streets." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Beg your pardon, sir," [...] was {{the almost}} {{incoherent}} reply. [...] "I've run all the <b>way</b> <b>up,</b> and <b>there's</b> a rare wind blowing. There's one of our--our trawlers lying off the Point, and she's sent up three green and six yellow balls." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm looking round; we deal in {{all kinds}} of paints and miss no chance of a trade. Then I'm going <b>way</b> <b>up</b> North-West. Is <b>there</b> {{anything}} doing in my line there?" ...|$|R
6000|$|At {{the mention}} of hay, Peter Rabbit sat bolt upright {{and his eyes were}} wide open with astonishment. [...] "Did you say hay?" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "Where under the sun does he get hay <b>way</b> <b>up</b> <b>there,</b> and what does he want of it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{may have}} pulled {{out over the}} range," [...] {{suggested}} the ranger. [...] "Anyhow, it's a long <b>way</b> <b>up</b> <b>there,</b> and you'll probably have to camp at my place to-night. You'll find the key hanging up over the door. Go in and make yourself comfortable." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Even <b>way</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> {{there is}} moss growing under the snow. And {{in the short}} summer other plants grow. During the long winter Snow White digs down through the snow to get these. He also eats the bark and twigs of little stunted trees. But big as he is, you have a cousin who is still bigger, the biggest of all the family." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's a {{beautiful}} wreath," [...] continued Creed. [...] "I could smell {{of it all}} the <b>way</b> <b>up</b> the stairs. <b>There's</b> been no expense spared; there's white laylock in it--that's a class of flower that's very extravagant." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sampson, listen!" [...] I cried, very swiftly. [...] "The game's up! You're done! But {{think of}} your daughter! I'll spare your life, I'll give you freedom on one condition. For her sake! I've got you nailed--all the proofs. It was I behind the wall the other night. Blome, Hilliard, Pickens, Bo Snecker, are dead. I killed Bo Snecker on the <b>way</b> <b>up</b> here. <b>There</b> lies Wright. You're alone. And here comes Morton and his men to my aid.|$|R
50|$|The K5 is a bullet-shaped and penguin-like robot {{that stands}} about 5 feet tall. The K5 has twin panels of lights {{about two-thirds of}} the <b>way</b> <b>up</b> its body. <b>There</b> is also a small silver color flag of the United States {{on the left side of}} its body.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! Oh!" [...] cried Chatterer, {{and ran out}} to {{the very}} tip of the little branch {{to which he had}} been clinging. Now if Chatterer had only known it, Buster Bear couldn't reach him <b>way</b> <b>up</b> <b>there,</b> because the tree was too small at the top for such a big fellow as Buster. But Chatterer didn't think of that. He gave one more frightened look down at those big teeth, then he shut his eyes and jumped--jumped {{straight}} out for the far-away ground.|$|E
60|$|Peter Rabbit sat on {{the edge}} of the dear Old Briar-patch, staring up into the sky with his head tipped back until it made his neck ache. Way, way up in the sky was a black speck sailing across the snowy white face of a cloud. It didn't seem {{possible}} that it could be alive <b>way</b> <b>up</b> <b>there.</b> But it was. Peter knew that it was, and he knew who it was. It was King Eagle. By and by it disappeared over towards the Great Mountain. Peter rubbed the back of his neck, which ached because he had tipped his head back so long. Then he gave a little sigh.|$|E
6000|$|... "In the Far North {{beyond the}} great forests Wanderhoof has a cousin who {{looks very much}} like him, called the Barren Ground Caribou. The name {{comes from the fact that}} <b>way</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> little {{excepting}} moss grows, and on this the Caribou lives. In summer this Caribou is found almost up to the Arctic Ocean, moving southward in great herds as the cold weather approaches. No other animals of to-day get together in such great numbers. In the extreme North is another Caribou, called Peary's Caribou, whose coat is wholly white. The Caribou are close cousins of the Reindeer and look much like them.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{want to go}} in," [...] whined Reddy Fox. [...] "It's {{nice and}} warm out here, and I {{feel a lot better}} than when I am curled <b>up</b> <b>way</b> down <b>there</b> in the dark." ...|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} '80s Hammer {{started as a}} bus cleaner with a Dutch public {{broadcaster}} and worked his <b>way</b> <b>up</b> from <b>there.</b> He eventually became production assistant, taught himself {{how to be a}} video editor, and turned director and producer, working on some of Holland's biggest productions with Joop van den Ende. In subsequent years Hammer was involved with the introduction of private radio and TV RTL in the Netherlands and Belgium, owned a trucker radio station and was advisor to media moguls such as Leo Kirch (Kirch Gruppe).|$|R
5000|$|One {{morning the}} {{expedition}} awoke {{to find a}} new pond at the doorway to the hut, fed by the Lewis Glacier and the Curling Pond. This caused the porters to become uneasy, as there were local superstitions about the mountain. They believed they were trespassing on the mountain and their God, Ngai, had sent this as a warning to them. The following day Dutton and Melhuish set off to climb to the summit of Batian, accompanied by several porters, but gave up after several hours as they could not find a <b>way</b> <b>up.</b> After attempting to climb a slab, one porter said [...] "there may be a <b>way</b> <b>up,</b> but <b>there</b> is no way down".|$|R
6000|$|A resounding smash {{of glass}} came from upstairs. Adye had a silvery {{glimpse of a}} little {{revolver}} half out of Kemp's pocket. [...] "It's a window, upstairs!" [...] said Kemp, and led the <b>way</b> <b>up.</b> <b>There</b> came a second smash {{while they were still}} on the staircase. When they reached the study they found two of the three windows smashed, half the room littered with splintered glass, and one big flint lying on the writing table. The two men stopped in the doorway, contemplating the wreckage. Kemp swore again, and as he did so the third window went with a snap like a pistol, hung starred for a moment, and collapsed in jagged, shivering triangles into the room.|$|E
6000|$|Up-stairs {{there was}} a very cosy party who came in by degrees. Lady Penwether was there soon after ten with Miss Penge and some of the gentlemen, {{including}} Morton, who was the only man seen in that room in black. Young Hampton, who was intimate in the house, made his <b>way</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> and Sir John Purefoy joined the party. Sir John was a hunting man who lived in the county and was an old friend of the family. Lady Purefoy hunted also, and came in later. Arabella was the last,--not from laziness, but aware that in this way the effect might be the best. Lord Rufford was in the room when she entered it and of course she addressed herself to him. [...] "Which is it to be, Lord Rufford, Jack or Jemima?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Suppose {{that one}} of those flowers," [...] he continued, [...] "was not like the rest; that its stalks and leaves, instead of being green and soft, were white and stringy like flannel as if to protect it from cold, wouldn't it be {{nice to be able to}} say at once that it had lived only in the snow, and that some one must have gone all that <b>way</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> above the snow line to pick it?" [...] The children, taken aback by this unfair {{introduction}} of a floral stranger, were silent. Cressy thoughtfully accepted botany on those possibilities. A week later she laid on the master's desk a limp-looking plant with a stalk like heavy frayed worsted yarn. [...] "It ain't much to look at after all, is it?" [...] she said. [...] "I reckon I could cut a better one with scissors outer an old cloth jacket of mine." ...|$|E
50|$|Riders are {{restrained}} using {{over the}} shoulder restraints and a seatbelt. There is a blast of air which sends the gondola {{to the top of}} the tower, this is followed by a second blast, in which the gondola reaches 2/3 of the <b>way</b> <b>up</b> the tower, <b>there</b> is then a small blast of air sending the gondola 1/3 of the <b>way</b> <b>up</b> the tower. During the descent, the riders might experience weightlessness for a brief second.|$|R
60|$|We {{got about}} half <b>way</b> <b>up,</b> when <b>there</b> came into our faces {{one of those}} sudden, passionate puffs of mist and rain which Scotch clouds {{seem to have the}} faculty of getting up at a minute's notice. Whish! came the wind in our faces, like the {{rustling}} of a whole army of spirits down the staircase; whereat we all tumbled back promiscuously on to each other, and concluded we would not go up. In fact we had done the thing, and so we went home; and I dreamed of arches, and corbels, and gargoyles all night. And so, farewell to Melrose Abbey.|$|R
50|$|On {{awakening}} in {{an idyllic}} tropical paradise, Rex is disoriented and possibly afflicted with amnesia. He knows his name, but the particulars are curiously missing. He spends his first week exploring, and discovers that his Eden-like paradise {{is surrounded by}} a huge unscalable wall 50 miles in circumference. Furthermore, there are six gateways at roughly equal intervals, but there is no <b>way</b> to climb <b>up</b> <b>there</b> and see where they go.|$|R
6000|$|... "There were twelve pigs in that litter," [...] Glenn was saying, [...] "and now you {{see there}} are only nine. I've lost three. Mountain lions, bears, coyotes, wild cats are all likely to steal a pig. And at first I was sure one of these varmints had been robbing me. But as I could not find any tracks, I knew I had to lay the blame on {{something}} else. So I kept watch pretty closely in daytime, and at night I shut the pigs up in the corner there, where you see I've built a pen. Yesterday I heard squealing--and, by George! I saw an eagle flying off {{with one of my}} pigs. Say, I was mad. A great old bald-headed eagle--the regal bird you see with America's stars and stripes had degraded himself {{to the level of a}} coyote. I ran for my rifle, and I took some quick shots at him as he flew up. Tried to hit him, too, but I failed. And the old rascal hung on to my pig. I watched him carry it to that sharp crag <b>way</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> on the rim." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "They {{think it}} is {{supported}} on the peak of a lofty mountain in the north, on which it revolves. The stars {{are supposed to be}} ancient Greenlanders, or animals which have managed in some mysterious <b>way</b> to mount <b>up</b> <b>there,</b> and who shine with varied brightness, according to the nature of their food. The streaming lights of winter are the souls of the dead dancing and playing ball in the sky." ...|$|R
5000|$|Between a {{half and}} three-quarters of the <b>way</b> <b>up</b> the stupa <b>there</b> was a small chamber {{containing}} a reliquary and some treasure. The 19th century British adventurer Charles Masson opened the chamber and recovered eight gold Kushan coins some other gold ornaments. As well as the gold coins mentioned above there were also ninety-six gold buttons with bronze loops with an average diameter of 2.1 cm., and [...] "a small quantity of ashes and fragments of bones".|$|R
50|$|At {{the base}} of Calton Hill, SH1 intersects with Barnes Drive at a signal-controlled intersection. Here SH1 {{continues}} as a four-lane road before climbing over Calton Hill to Lookout Point. This section is residential arterial road with houses upon both sides and a 50 km/h speed limit enforced by a fixed speed camera about {{one third of the}} <b>way</b> <b>up</b> the hill. <b>There</b> are proposals to widen this road to connect the Caversham bypass with the motorway to the south.|$|R

60|$|As far as I could {{remember}} {{there were six}} chairs in that Oklahoma, and one table, a great big heavy table, not a good table to hit with your head when rushing madly along. In {{the course of time}} I collided with thirty-five chairs and tables enough to stock that dining-room out there. It was a hospital for decayed furniture, and it was in a worse condition when I got through with it. I went on and on, and at last got to a place where I could feel my <b>way</b> <b>up,</b> and <b>there</b> was a shelf. I knew that wasn't {{in the middle of the}} room. Up to that time I was afraid I had gotten out of the city.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of {{a view of}} Santa Monica's Palisades Park, {{including}} the beach and century plants, ca. 1925. Four tall century plants are visible in the foreground. They have long, thin stalks with small bunches of flowers at the end. The palisades are behind them and are topped by palm trees and a low wooden fence. A steep path makes its <b>way</b> <b>up</b> the cliff. <b>There</b> are many buildings near the water t left, and a pier can be seen jutting out into the water...|$|R
40|$|Metaethics {{tends to}} take for granted a bare Democritean world of atoms and the void, and then worry about how the human world that we all know can {{possibly}} be related to it or justified in its terms. I draw on Wittgenstein to show how completely upside-down this picture is, and make some moves towards turning it the right <b>way</b> <b>up</b> again. <b>There</b> may be a use for something like the bare-Democritean model in some of the sciences, but the picture has no standing as the basic objective truth about the world; if anything has that standing, it is ordinary life. I conclude with some thoughts about how the notion of bare, “thin” perception of non-evaluative reality feeds a number of philosophical pathologies, such as behaviourism, and show how a “thicker”, more value-laden, understanding of our perceptions of the world can be therapeutic against them...|$|R
