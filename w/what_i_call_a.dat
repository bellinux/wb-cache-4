5|$|I {{certainly}} don't see gay {{and lesbian}} history starting with Stonewall... and I don't see resistance starting with Stonewall. What I do see is a historical coming together of forces, and the sixties changed how human beings endured things in this society and what they refused to endure... Certainly something special happened on that night in 1969, and we've made it more special in our need to have <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>call</b> <b>a</b> point of origin... it's more complex than saying that {{it all started with}} Stonewall.|$|E
500|$|The film {{switches}} the infertility from male {{to female}} but never explains its cause: environmental destruction and divine punishment are considered. This unanswered question (and {{others in the}} film) {{have been attributed to}} Cuarón's dislike for expository film: [...] "There's a kind of cinema I detest, which is a cinema that is about exposition and explanations... It's become now <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>call</b> <b>a</b> medium for lazy readers... Cinema is a hostage of narrative. [...] And I'm very good at narrative as a hostage of cinema." [...] Cuarón's disdain for back-story and exposition led him to use the concept of female infertility as a [...] "metaphor for the fading sense of hope". [...] The [...] "almost mythical" [...] Human Project is turned into a [...] "metaphor for the possibility of the evolution of the human spirit, the evolution of human understanding." [...] Without dictating how the audience should feel {{by the end of the}} film, Cuarón encourages viewers to come to their own conclusions about the sense of hope depicted in the final scenes: [...] "We wanted the end to be a glimpse of a possibility of hope, for the audience to invest their own sense of hope into that ending. So if you're a hopeful person you'll see a lot of hope, and if you're a bleak person you'll see a complete hopelessness at the end." ...|$|E
2500|$|On January 20, 2012 Evans was {{inducted}} into the NASCAR HOF, during which Darrell Waltrip said to the Evan's family during his acceptance speech, [...] "You know Richie Evans I want to congratulate the Richie Evans Family, great job tonight. [...] I watched Richie win race after race after race at Martinsville and in my world is <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>call</b> <b>A</b> wheel man and Richie Evans was the best wheel man I ever saw and when he raced at Martinsville." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{family members}} all played music. [...] Mr. Scruggs had played an open back banjo using the frailing technique, though {{as an adult}} Earl had no {{recollection}} of his father's playing. Mrs. Scruggs played the pump organ. Earl's siblings, older brothers Junie and Horace, and older sisters Eula Mae and Ruby, all played banjo and guitar. Scruggs recalls a visit to his uncle's home at age six to hear a blind banjo player named Mack Woolbright, who played a finger picking style and had recorded for Columbia Records. This made an impression on Scruggs, who said, [...] "He'd sit in the rocking chair, and he'd pick some {{and it was just}} amazing. I couldn't imagine — he was the first, <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>call</b> <b>a</b> good banjo player." [...] Scruggs then took up the instrument — he was too small to hold it at first and improvised by setting his brother Junie's banjo beside him on the floor. He moved it around depending on what part of the neck he was playing. [...] After his father's death, Scruggs seemed to take solace in playing music, and when not in school or doing farm chores, spent nearly every spare moment he had practicing. His first radio performance was at age 11 on a talent scout show.|$|E

60|$|It's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>call</b> <b>an</b> awful shame.' Mr. Holt and parson Bromley were {{standing}} {{together on the}} causeway at Folking, and the former was speaking. The subject under discussion was, of course, the continued detention of John Caldigate in the county prison.|$|R
6000|$|... "You've {{put this}} matter plainly, sir," [...] he said, [...] "in <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>call</b> <b>an</b> understandable, {{straightforward}} way.

40|$|I {{argue that}} the success of Niketche owes more to the limits its {{internal}} exotic charge draws to provocation than to its provocative taboo-lifting undertone. Chiziane’s attempt to question received patriarchal representations of ethnic and gender difference ends up re-affirming patriarchal power by representing <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>call</b> <b>an</b> ‘internal exotic’...|$|R

40|$|My {{starting}} {{point in this}} paper is the artistic structures of the Renaissance.
