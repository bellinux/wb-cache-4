5|$|Kid Icarus is {{an action}} {{platformer}} with role-playing elements. The player controls the protagonist Pit through two-dimensional levels, which contain monsters, obstacles and items.

These upgrades <b>will</b> <b>work</b> only if Pit's health is high enough. The game keeps track of the player's score, and increases Pit's health bar {{at the end of a}} level if enough points were collected.|$|E

Lastly, if a patient is unable to be cared for at home, the social worker <b>will</b> <b>work</b> to find a safer place for the patient to receive hospice care.|$|E
5|$|The REVA NXR {{exhibited}} in the 2009 Frankfurt Motor Show and the Nissan Leaf SV trim both have roof-mounted solar panels. These solar panels are designed to trickle charge the batteries when the car is moving or parked. Another proposed technology is REVive, by Reva. When the REVA NXR's batteries are running low or are fully depleted, the driver is able to send an SMS to REVive and unlock a hidden reserve in the battery pack. Reva has not provided details on how the system <b>will</b> <b>work.</b> The Fisker Karma uses solar panel in the roof to recharge the 12-volt lead-acid accessory battery. The Nissan Leaf SL trim also has a small solar panel {{at the rear of}} the roof/spoiler that can trickle charge the auxiliary 12-volt lead-acid battery.|$|E
5|$|The game {{supports}} a different interface for Microsoft Windows users {{to that for}} the console versions, and also supports the use of Xbox 360 controllers on Windows PCs.

Dishonored was officially released to manufacturing on 28 September 2012.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} pie in {{the legend}} included sand eels, horse mackerel, pilchards, herring, dogfish and ling along with a seventh fish. In a traditional pie, the primary ingredient is the pilchard (sardine), although mackerel or herring {{is used as a}} substitute. Richard Stevenson, chef at The Ship Inn in Mousehole, suggests that any white fish <b>will</b> <b>work</b> for the filling, with pilchards or herring just added for the presentation. Prior to putting it in the pie the fish should be skinned and boned (except the head and tail) {{to make it easier to}} eat. Along with the fish, the other traditional ingredients are thickened milk, eggs and boiled potatoes.|$|E
5|$|The {{prosthetic}} phase begins {{once the}} implant is well integrated (or has a reasonable assurance {{that it will}} integrate) and an abutment is in place to bring it through the mucosa. Even {{in the event of}} early loading (less than 3 months), many practitioners will place temporary teeth until osseointegration is confirmed. The prosthetic phase of restoring an implant requires an equal amount of technical expertise as the surgical because of the biomechanical considerations, especially when multiple teeth are to be restored. The dentist <b>will</b> <b>work</b> to restore the vertical dimension of occlusion, the esthetics of the smile, and the structural integrity of the teeth to evenly distribute the forces of the implants.|$|E
5|$|A pair <b>will</b> <b>work</b> {{together}} to help build the nest, incubate the eggs and raise their altricial young. However, in most species the male {{does most of the}} nest excavation and takes the night shift while incubating the eggs. A clutch will usually consist of two to five round white eggs. Since these birds are cavity nesters, their eggs {{do not need to be}} camouflaged and the white color helps the parents to see them in dim light. The eggs are incubated for about 11–14 days before they hatch. It then takes about 18–30 days before the chicks are fully fledged and ready to leave the nest. In most species, soon after this the young are left to fend for themselves, exceptions being the various social species, and the Hispaniolan woodpecker, where adults continue to feed their young for several months. In general, cavity nesting is a successful strategy and a higher proportion of young are reared than is the case with birds that nest in the open. In Africa, several species of honeyguide are brood parasites of woodpeckers.|$|E
