Pete Jones, Joint Design Director for Dark Energy Digital {{spoke of the}} difficulties experienced {{in an interview with}} GamingNexus. [...] "Criticism can be hard. You make games because you love games, perhaps on occasions we may have seemed a little too defensive and disappointed. Pride can be a big virtue as well because you need to be intensely proud of something you're creating in any endeavor." [...] Jones further stated that it was difficult to accept that some consumers and critics disliked the game. He conceded that [...] "if the community doesnt like it <b>we</b> <b>try</b> <b>and</b> change it no matter whose toes we tread on." ...|$|E

2500|$|Romney {{got into}} a long {{discussion}} with moderator George Stephanopoulos over whether states {{have the right to}} ban contraception or whether that was trumped by a constitutional right to privacy. Romney said, [...] "So you're asking, given the fact that there's no state that wants to do so and I don't know of any candidate that wants to do so, you're asking could it constitutionally be done? We can ask our constitutionalist here," [...] gesturing to Ron Paul, which drew laughter and applause from the audience. The discussion continued until Romney grew frustrated at the repeated questioning and asserted, [...] "States don't want to ban contraception. So why would <b>we</b> <b>try</b> <b>and</b> put it in the Constitution?... Contraception, it's working just fine, just leave it alone." [...] Stephanopoulos later joked on The Colbert Report that he had a bet with fellow moderator Diane Sawyer that he could get Romney to say [...] "contraceptions are working just fine". Jon Huntsman, {{in response to a question}} on civil unions, joked, [...] "I'm a married man. I've been married for 28 years. I have seven kids. Glad we're off the contraception discussion." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jordan Pundik later accounted, [...] "I'm not {{comparing}} my band to the Beatles whatsoever, {{but their}} [...] records were simple songs {{about love and}} relationships, and people could relate to their songs because they understood what {{they were trying to}} say. That's what this record reminds me of. There's not weird metaphors. It's just straight up, wearing your heart on your sleeve." [...] Steve Klein emphasised the shift in mood from their previous album by stating, [...] "I think every record we make <b>we</b> <b>try</b> <b>and</b> capture a time period. When writing the songs for Coming Home it was more positive than negative. I felt on the last record, Catalyst, we were very negative lyrically. You can tell that by the titles [...] "All Downhill From Here" [...] and [...] "This Disaster," [...] it was a heavier record. Coming Home on the other hand takes you to a different place. It’s the record I feel we’ve been waiting our whole career to do, taking everything people love about NFG and bringing it to the next level." [...] Bassist Ian Grushka further explained, [...] "We only really talk about personal things that have affected us first-hand, our songs are about emotions rather than some political agenda." [...] The song, [...] "When I Die" [...] was written by Gilbert about the death of his father. When initially writing the bridge section for the song, Gilbert found the experience emotionally draining and had to leave the studio in order to compose himself. Despite this, he maintains that while song is [...] "sad", it remains [...] "a good sad." [...] He reflected this in the album's liner notes by adding, [...] "It is a song about accepting death and finding the bright side of the situation. I'm no longer afraid to die because I have my father there waiting for me on the other side." ...|$|E

[...] "I tried it once, and {{although}} the negroes and Indians of Porto Rico were certainly a very different people to these savages, still the life led on these great plains and hills, abounding with game, is more lively than being cooped up in a wood, as I was then. Besides, I don't mean that we should be here always. I propose that <b>we</b> <b>try</b> <b>and</b> cross the continent. It is not so very wide here, and we are nearly in a line with Lima. The admiral means to go on there, and expects a rich booty. He may be months before he gets round the Horn, and if we could manage to be there when he arrives, we should be rescued. If not, and I own that I have not much hope of it, we could at least go down to Lima some time or other. I can talk Spanish now very fairly, and we shall have such a lot of adventures to tell that, even if they do not take us for Spanish sailors, as we can try to feign, they will not be likely to put us to death. They would do so if we were taken in arms as buccaneers; but, coming in peaceably, we might be kindly treated. At any rate, if we get on well with the Indians we shall have the choice of making, some day or other, for the Spanish settlements on the west coast; but that is all in the distance. The first thing will be to get our living, somehow; the second to get further inland; the third to make friends with the first band of natives we meet. And now, {{the best thing to do}} is to go off to sleep. I shall not be many minutes, I can tell you." ...|$|E
6000|$|Now the Bible, {{it is most}} remarkable, never enlarges {{anywhere}} upon {{even the}} bodily sufferings of our dear and blessed Lord. The evangelists keep a silence on that point which is most lofty, dignified, and delicate. [...] What sad and dreadful things might not St. John, the beloved apostle as he was, have said, if he had chosen, about what he saw and what he felt, as he stood by that cross on Calvary--words which would have stirred to pity the most cruel, and drawn tears from a heart of stone? And yet all he says is, [...] "They crucified Him, and two other with him, on either side one, and Jesus in the midst." [...] He passes it over, as it were, as a thing which he ought not to dwell on; and why should we put words into St. John's mouth {{which he did not}} think fit to put into his own? He wrote by the Spirit of God; and therefore he knew best what to say, and what not to say. Why should <b>we</b> <b>try</b> <b>and</b> say anything more for him? Scripture is perfect. Let us be content with it. The apostles, too, in their Epistles, never dwell on Christ's sufferings. I entreat you to remark this. They never mention His death except in words of cheerfulness and triumph. They seem so full of the glorious fruits of His death, that they have, as it were, no time to speak of the death itself. [...] "Who, for the joy which was set before Him, endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God." [...] That is the apostles' key-note. For God's sake let it be ours too, unless we fancy that we can improve on Scripture, or that we can feel more for our Lord than St. Paul did. In the Lessons, the Psalms, the Epistle, and Gospel for this day, you find just the same spirit. All except one Psalm are songs of hope, joy, deliverance, triumph. The Collects for this day, which are particularly remarkable, being three in number, and evidently meant to teach us the key-note of Good Friday, make no mention of our Lord's sufferings, save to say that He was CONTENTED, [...] "contented to be betrayed, and given up into the hands of wicked men, and to suffer death upon the cross," [...] but are full of prayers that the glorious fruits of His death may be fulfilled, not only in us and all Christians, but in the very heathen who have not known Him; drawing us away, as it were, from looking too closely upon the cross itself, lest we should forget what the cross meant, what the cross conquered, what the cross gained, for us and mankind.|$|E
