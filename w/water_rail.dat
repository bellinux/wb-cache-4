5|$|The two Crex crakes are {{unlikely}} to be confused with other rails, since most sympatric short-billed rails are smaller, with white markings on the upperparts, different underparts patterns and shorter bills. The European <b>water</b> <b>rail</b> and the African rail have long pointed bills.|$|E
5|$|Much of the {{management}} work {{carried out in the}} nature reserve is aimed at encouraging ducks to breed, and small numbers of tufted duck (Aythya fuligula), common pochard (Aythya ferina), common shelduck (Tadorna tadorna) and gadwall raise broods most years. Recent breeding successes also include <b>water</b> <b>rail</b> (Rallus aquaticus) and Cetti's warbler (Cettia cetti).|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} ducks, geese and swans is {{greatest}} in winter, with large flocks of greater white-fronted geese, sometimes {{with a rare}} lesser white-fronted goose amongst them. Bewick's swans are a feature of Slimbridge in winter, arriving from northern Russia to enjoy the milder climate of southern England. Their behaviour has been studied intensively at Slimbridge. Birds of prey such as peregrine and merlin also visit the centre in the winter, as well as wading birds and some woodland birds, {{and it is a}} good place to see the elusive <b>water</b> <b>rail.</b>|$|E

25|$|Herons, little grebes, mallards, <b>water</b> <b>rails,</b> dippers and kingfishers {{live on the}} park's water bodies.|$|R
5000|$|The {{site has}} {{a wide variety of}} wildlife, {{including}} <b>water</b> <b>rails,</b> kingfishers, little grebes and muntjac deer.|$|R
5|$|The {{reserve is}} {{important}} for some scarce breeding birds, such as pied avocets on the islands, and western marsh harriers, Eurasian bitterns and bearded reedlings in the reeds. To encourage bitterns to breed, the reed beds have been improved to make them wetter, and the lagoon has been stocked with the common rudd. Typical wetland birds such as the <b>water</b> <b>rail,</b> reed warbler and sedge warbler also appear, and little egrets are common. The reserve has regularly attracted rarities, as its location {{is important for}} migrating birds. Ducks and geese winter at Titchwell in considerable numbers, and the reserve shelters the endangered European water vole.|$|E
5|$|Lafarge Aggregates owns various {{sites in}} the parish. In 1974 the village won an appeal against Pioneer Concrete's {{application}} for gravel extraction near the village. Similar events took place in March 2003 when hundreds of local residents protested against an application of gravel extraction by Lafarge. Larfarge's initial appeal, in April 2003, was turned down by West Berkshire Council. A further application to extract aggregate at the Wasing Estate was due to be decided in 2010. One former extraction site, Butts Lake Quarry, is now a nature reserve and the flooded lakes {{have been identified as}} a Site of Special Scientific Interest and is now operated by the Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire Wildlife Trust. The reserve contains specimens of trees such as alder, cherry, hawthorn, oak, and willow. Examples of reeds present include typha latifolia, phragmites australis, mentha aquatica, and lythrum salicaria. Numerous species of bird nest in the reserve, including the common teal, shoveler, warbler, kingfisher, <b>water</b> <b>rail,</b> and nightingale.|$|E
5|$|Swans {{and geese}} usually start {{to arrive in}} late October. Passage waders in the autumn include red knot, godwit, dunlin, ringed and grey plovers, ruff, common greenshank, spotted redshank, curlew sandpiper and common, wood and green sandpipers. Besides Bewick's swan and flocks of white-fronted geese, large {{waterfowl}} regularly present in the reserve in winter include the Brant goose, pink-footed goose, barnacle goose and Taiga bean goose. The swans tend to fly off {{in the day and}} return to feed in the late afternoon, and another spectacular sight at the end of winter afternoons is the arrival of large flocks of starlings. Smaller wildfowl present in winter include wigeon, Eurasian teal, common pochard, northern pintail, <b>water</b> <b>rail,</b> dunlin, redshank, curlew, golden plover, snipe and ruff.|$|E

25|$|Five Mile House was {{a railway}} {{station on the}} Lincolnshire Loop Line which served the village of Fiskerton in Lincolnshire between 1848 and 1964. Situated on the south bank of the River Witham, {{passengers}} on the north bank had to use a ferry to reach it. It closed two years after opening due to low traffic, but reopened fifteen years later. Withdrawal of passenger services took place in 1958, leaving the station open for anglers' excursions until 1964. The <b>Water</b> <b>Rail</b> Way footpath now runs through the site.|$|E
25|$|Among the birdlife {{which can}} be seen at Cors Caron are buzzard, {{peregrine}} falcon, merlin, Eurasian sparrowhawk and hen harrier. There have also been rare sightings of Montagu's harrier. The reserve provides a habitat for the endangered red kite. Once nearly extinct, the bird of prey has made a dramatic resurgence in the area. The wetlands attract a variety of wild fowl such as the teal, curlew, and <b>water</b> <b>rail.</b> Snipe, red grouse, tree pipit, grasshopper warbler and whinchat can be seen more in the drier areas and the common redstart and willow warbler nest in the willow scrub.|$|E
50|$|The river has {{clear water}} from chalk springs in the Chiltern Hills, {{and it has}} a rich aquatic and insect life. Plants include spring water crowfoot, and there are mammals such as the water shrew, and birds include kingfishers and <b>water</b> <b>rails.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Fowlmere {{nature reserve}} (maintained by the RSPB) is {{situated}} {{west of the}} village, {{between it and the}} village of Melbourn. With 2.4 km of nature trails, it attracts many visitors. Several special birds are seen there, including: kingfishers, <b>water</b> <b>rails,</b> and grasshopper warblers.|$|R
50|$|Fowlmere's reedbeds and pools are fed {{by natural}} chalk springs and a chalk stream {{runs through the}} reserve. It has three hides, {{one of which is}} wheelchair-accessible. Special birds include kingfishers, <b>water</b> <b>rails,</b> sedge warblers, reed warblers and {{grasshopper}} warblers plus a roost of corn buntings in winter.|$|R
500|$|The {{island has}} been {{identified}} by Alula, the Finnish birding magazine, as “one {{of the most important}} breeding bird islands of the Finnish Baltic Sea”. On the island are Steller's eider (Polysticta stelleri), the key bird species, and razorbill (Alca torda). [...] Other breeding species recorded are: Mute swan (Cygnus olor), greylag goose (Anser anser), tufted duck (Aythya fuligula), gadwall (Anas strepera), black guillemot (Cepphus grylle), razorbill (Alca torda), guillemot (Uria aalge), <b>water</b> <b>rail</b> (Rallus aquaticus), colonies of gulls (Larus spp.), terns (Sterna spp.) and the white-tailed eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla).|$|E
500|$|On {{the south}} {{bank of the}} river below Fosdyke bridge, the Lincolnshire Wildlife Trust have {{established}} Moulton Marsh nature reserve, on a strip of land where soil was excavated to raise the banks in 1981. Habitat is provided by some broad-leafed woodland, covering , several salt-water lagoons and tidal scrapes, covering , and [...] of saltmarsh. A variety of birds can be seen, including little grebe and <b>water</b> <b>rail,</b> which spend the winter on the lagoons, while the scrapes, which consist of shallow pools and muddy shorelines, are visited by common redshank and little egret.|$|E
500|$|A long-distance footpath, the <b>Water</b> <b>Rail</b> Way, {{follows the}} course of the river from Lincoln to Boston. The path uses {{sections}} of the river towpath and abandoned railway tracks, and has been opened in stages, with the final [...] being completed in September 2008. The path is now part of Route 1 of the National Cycle Network and features a number of sculptures along its length, each commissioned from local artists. They include Lincoln longwool sheep at Stixwould, Lincoln red cows at Washingborough, and Lincoln curly pigs, which became extinct in 1972, at Southrey.|$|E
50|$|The bittern {{population}} at Minsmere responded positively to this work. In 2003, {{there was a}} count of 8 booming males and 8 to 10 nesting females and between 1994 and 2001 52 bittern chicks fledged. Many other species including <b>water</b> <b>rails,</b> reed warblers, and otters {{have benefited from the}} projects.|$|R
50|$|Over 220 {{species of}} bird have been {{recorded}} on the reserve, including lapwing, little ringed plover, skylark and reed warbler. Large numbers of ducks and waders are present outside the breeding season, together with <b>water</b> <b>rails</b> and a large roost of starlings. Vagrant birds have included the stilt sandpiper, Terek sandpiper, broad-billed sandpiper and alpine swift.|$|R
50|$|The {{site has}} {{a variety of}} habitats, {{including}} wet and dry woodland, the river margin and fen areas. Willow, reed and rush were formerly grown and harvested in the wetter areas, and there was a corn mill at the eastern end. Birds include kingfishers, <b>water</b> <b>rails</b> and woodcock, and there are mammals such as water shrews.|$|R
500|$|The {{advertising}} {{calls of}} both crakes are readily {{distinguished from the}} quite dissimilar calls of potentially sympatric rails such as the spotted crake, striped crake, Baillon's crake, or <b>water</b> <b>rail.</b> The calls of the two Crex species cannot be confused, since the corn crake is silent in Africa. Both sexes may give distinctive territorial or alarm calls, and females and chicks communicate with cheeps and wheezes. The African crake can be attracted to within [...] of a human by imitation of its kraaa threat call, and the male corn crake by mechanical imitations of their advertising call, including rubbing {{a piece of wood}} down a notched stick, or by flicking a credit card against a comb or zip-fastener.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Water</b> <b>Rail</b> Way is a [...] long {{part of the}} National Cycle Network {{that runs}} from Boston to Lincoln, {{following}} {{as closely as possible}} the banks of the River Witham. Between Woodhall Spa and Lincoln it consists of a tarmacked path that runs along the route of the former railway line from Boston to Lincoln. It was built and financed by Sustrans organisation, and was finally completed and opened in November 2008. It is open to all forms of non-motorised transport, forming part of NCN Route 1. Named primarily after its route and former use, the path is also so named due to the rare <b>water</b> <b>rail</b> bird.|$|E
2500|$|The {{site is a}} glacial lake {{typical of}} those located in the Masurian Lake District with an area of , and a maximum depth of [...] The lake is {{connected}} with nearby Sniardwy Lake by a channel.

[...] The lake has been a protected location since 1937 as a habitat of the mute swan (...) , every year there are a dozen to tens of dozens of nesting pairs, and during moulting they arrive in numbers reaching up to 2,000 birds.|$|E
50|$|This secluded pool, {{which is}} {{adjacent}} to the Boddington Reservoir, was constructed in the 1790s to supply water to the Oxford Canal. <b>Water</b> <b>rails</b> and tufted ducks breed on the pond, {{and there are many}} frogs and other amphibians. A wide range of other birds nest in the adjacent scrub and woods. Mammals include rabbits and red foxes.|$|R
50|$|When {{researchers}} played {{recordings of}} the reed warbler at night to attract that species for trapping, they found <b>water</b> <b>rails</b> and other wetland birds were also grounded, {{despite a lack of}} suitable habitat, suggesting that the rails and other nocturnal migrants recognised the warbler’s song and associated it with the marshy habitat in which it is usually found.|$|R
5|$|Other {{breeding}} birds include ringed plovers and Eurasian oystercatchers {{in the sand}} dunes, and <b>water</b> <b>rails</b> in the reed bed. Sedge, reed and Cetti's warblers all nest in the wetland, and little egrets are now common on the reserve. In early summer, scarcer migrants like the little gull, black tern, Eurasian spoonbills and garganey may pass through {{on their way to}} breed elsewhere.|$|R
6000|$|There {{seems so}} much {{confusion}} in the minds, {{or at least the}} language, of ornithologists, between the <b>Water</b> <b>Rail</b> and Water Hen, that I give this latter bird under the number XII.A. rather than XIII., (which would, besides, be an unlucky number to end my Appendix with); and it would be very nice, if at all possible or proper, to keep these two larger dabchicks connected pleasantly in school-girl minds by their costumes, and call one 'Silken Runner,' and this,--which, as said above, Gesner seems to mean, Velvet Runner, or Velvet Hen.--Poule de Soie or Poule de Velours? I am getting a little confused myself, however, I find at last, between Poules, Poussins, Pullets, and Pullas; and must for the present leave the matter to the reader's choice and fancy, till I get some more birds looked at, and named:--only, for a pretty end of my Appendix, here are two bits of very precious letters, sent me by friends who know birds better than most scientific people, but have been too busy--one in a 'Dorcas Society,' and the other in a children's hospital--to write books, and only now write these bits of letters on my special petition.
