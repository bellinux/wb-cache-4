He found it {{challenging}} to write, particularly Mulder and Scully's first scene where [...] "they have to come together on a case, yet {{they have to be}} at odds". [...] Shiban was inspired by the film The Men and realizing that the main character, who had been injured in war and lost his legs, <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> more than anything. He stated that the paranormal concept of astral projection [...] "just sort of fit". Some members of the writing staff were concerned about killing Callahan's young son, Trevor, but Shiban was not bothered by it and felt that Rappo wanted to take everything from Callahan, and the worst blow would be to kill his son.|$|E
500|$|Following {{a journey}} to the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, van Meegeren painted The Supper at Emmaus using the {{ultramarine}} blues and yellows preferred by Johannes Vermeer and other Dutch Golden Age painters. The experts assumed that Vermeer had studied in Italy, so van Meegeren used [...] by Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio located at Italy’s Pinacoteca di Brera as a model. He had always <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> in {{the steps of the}} masters, and he felt that his forgery was a fine work in its own right. He gave it to his friend, attorney C. A. Boon, telling him that it was a genuine Vermeer, and asked him to show it to Dr. Abraham Bredius in Monaco. Bredius examined the forgery in September 1937 and he accepted it as a genuine Vermeer and praised it highly.|$|E
5000|$|If You <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Walk</b> on Water, You've Got to Get Out of the Boat (also simply {{referred}} to as If You <b>Want</b> <b>To</b> <b>Walk</b> on Water) is a 2001 book written by John Ortberg that uses the New Testament account of Jesus walking on water as a conceptual framework for discussing leaps of faith and encouraging readers to make them. It became a bestseller. In March 2003, If You <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Walk</b> on Water was the third-best-selling religious book in Britain and the fourth-best-selling religious book in Scotland. In his book God Can't Sleep: Waiting for Daylight On Life's Dark Nights, Palmer Chinchen writes that If You <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Walk</b> on Water is an [...] "excellent book on faith". Religion News Service journalist Jonathan Merritt called the book a modern classic book. In 2002, If You <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Walk</b> on Water received the Christianity Today Book Award in the Christian Living category. Carol Rodman of The Commercial Appeal called the book [...] "challenging". Willow Creek Community Church placed the book on its Essential Reading List. Mary Milla of St. Paul Pioneer Press said that If You <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Walk</b> on Water is [...] "a must-read for anyone considering a career change ...

He used concert grand pianos and, occasionally, other keyboard instruments such as the harpsichord. From 1980 onward, he also made frequent use of synthesisers in the studio. Queen guitarist Brian May claims that Mercury was unimpressed with his own abilities at the piano and used the instrument less over time because he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> around onstage and entertain the audience. Although he wrote many lines for the guitar, Mercury possessed only rudimentary skills on the instrument. Songs like [...] "Ogre Battle" [...] and [...] "Crazy Little Thing Called Love" [...] were composed on the guitar; the latter featured Mercury playing rhythm guitar on stage and in the studio.|$|E

Although he was unaware of the band's popularity and had yet to hear [...] "Norwegian Wood", Shankar was impressed with Harrison's humility as the guitarist downplayed his sitar recordings with the Beatles as merely [...] "experiments". Soon after this meeting, Shankar gave Harrison his first sitar lesson at Kinfauns, his and Boyd's home in Surrey, and later, with tablist Alla Rakha, performed a private recital there for Harrison, Lennon and Starr. Harrison subsequently recalled of his first lesson with Shankar: [...] "I felt I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> out of my home that day and take a one-way ticket to Calcutta.

He said, [...] "The guys from the American sound company were not at all enamored with being out with this band. I can remember them saying, [...] "Oh, we could be out with Asia right now!' So they decided to pull the plug on it. They said, 'It's a matter of safety. We're going to pull the system down and we're not doing to do it.'" [...] McGuinness dissuaded the crew with an impromptu speech, a moment on which Ezratty recollected: [...] "Paul called everybody down into the bowels of Red Rocks where they fed everybody. It was cold and raining and everybody was shivering, and Paul made a speech, saying in no uncertain terms {{that we were going to}} proceed as one, that the band's entire livelihood was riding on this, and that this was one of the most pivotal moments in their career. He said that if it were deemed that this show was in any way possible to happen, it was going to happen, and it was not going to be tolerated that anybody would do anything but add their effort to a successful and positive outcome I just stood there and went, [...] "This is so cool.

[...] Before Troffer had even {{finished}} assembling it, Wallenda climbed up to the crossbar and did a somersault. [...] "And he did it perfectly," [...] Troffer recalls. [...] "I didn't teach him that." [...] Around the same time, he began performing {{with his family in}} their circus act. Wallenda's first public performance, dressed as a clown, was at SeaWorld San Diego in 1981. [...] He began to play on the wire at age two, walking back and forth while holding his mother's hand. At age four, he starting walking the wire on his own, learning primarily from his father. As a child, he would play on his parent's practice wire with his older sister Lijana, two feet (0.6 m) off the ground. [...] Wallenda's parents would throw objects at him as he practiced, and even shot him with a BB gun, to train him to deal with distractions. At age six, he first visited Niagara Falls and immediately decided that one day he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> a tightrope across it. [...] He spent most of his youth on the road, living in a mobile home as his parents performed across America. [...] However, Wallenda says there was never any family pressure to become a circus performer.|$|E

[...] "To proceed in this way is to incite us to quit the Amani programme, the government should not forget this", claimed Mai-Mai leaders. [...] "We are not a negligible group, we have arms... We want the CNDP to rejoin Amani. It seems that by quitting Amani, they have become more important than the other groups. We don't understand the decision by the government to go and negotiate with the CNDP... We are disappointed, it's a flagrant violation of Amani's terms." [...] CNDP spokesman Bertrand Bisimwa stated that the rebels [...] "are going to Nairobi to discuss only with the government outside of the Amani programme... If the government insists on staying in Amani, we'll pack our bags." [...] CNDP representatives, led by deputy executive secretary Serge Kambasu Ngeve, had arrived in the Kenyan capital city of Nairobi believing that they would be participating in bilateral discussions with the Congolese government alone.
