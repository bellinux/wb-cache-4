40|$|Detrital zircon dating {{has proven}} to be an {{effective}} way to constrain ages of submerged basement terranes on the margins of the northern Rockall Basin, a region where direct evidence of crustal affinities is scarce or absent. Zircons have been dated from sandstones of Palaeocene-Oligocene age known to have been derived from the east (Hebridean Platform) and <b>west</b> (<b>Rockall</b> and George Bligh highs). The results show that the Hebridean Platform is a westward extension of the Lewisian Complex, with Archaean and Palaeoproterozoic ages that can be directly correlated with events identified in the Outer Hebrides and northwest Scotland. The detrital zircons derived from the Hebridean Platform also provide evidence for a Mesoproterozoic thermal event and two phases of intrusions in the Palaeozoic. The Rockall High consists of a Palaeoproterozoic terrane dated as c. 1760 - 1800 Ma, similar to ages previously determined from both basement samples and detrital sediment. The data also provide evidence for the subsequent intrusion of alkaline igneous rocks in the Palaeocene-Eocene. The George Bligh High represents an Archaean terrane heavily affected by Palaeoproterozoic tectonothermal events, and was also the site of intrusion of alkaline igneous rocks in the Palaeocene...|$|R
40|$|Piston cores {{from the}} summits of coral topped {{carbonate}} mounds {{at the south}} <b>west</b> <b>Rockall</b> Trough margin reveal that the sediments have undergone significant post-depositional modifications affecting the original geochemical signature and mineralogical composition of the sediments. This diagenetic imprint provides information about the geochemical processes within cold-water coral mounds. The most prominent result of diagenetic alteration of the primary sediment composition is the absence or poor preservation of aragonitic coral skeletons in certain depth intervals associated with lithification. This study focuses on the enrichment of redox-sensitive elements and the dissolution of primary magnetic ferric iron minerals in the depth interval below lithification levels. By combining the magnetic susceptibility with the XRF signal of Fe and Ti specifically, intervals with susceptibility variations related to the conversion of strongly magnetic into weakly magnetic iron species can be defined. In all three studied cores a succession is recognised with a lithified interval with aragonite dissolution and low-Mg calcite precipitates that is underlain by an interval of magnetite dissolution and of iron and manganese enrichment. For the most recent lithified interval it is demonstrated that initial lithification occurred before an erosional regime was in place, most likely {{near the end of}} interglacial or at the start of glacial periods. © 2011 Elsevier B.

40|$|In February 2000 those onboard a British oceanographic {{research}} vessel near <b>Rockall,</b> <b>west</b> of Scotland experienced the largest waves ever recorded by scientific {{instruments in the}} open ocean. Under severe gale force conditions with wind speeds averaging 21 ms− 1 a shipborne wave recorder measured individual waves up to 29. 1 m from crest to trough, and a maximum significant wave height of 18. 5 m. The fully formed sea developed in unusual conditions as westerly winds blew across the North Atlantic for two days, during which time a frontal system propagated at a speed close to the group velocity of the peak waves. The measurements are compared to a wave hindcast (AES 40, Swail and Cox, 2000) which successfully simulated {{the arrival of the}} wave group but underestimated the most extreme waves...|$|R
40|$|Comparison of five deep-water coral (DWC) /mound {{ecosystems}} {{along the}} European Continental Margin shows that suspended {{particulate organic matter}} (sPOM), a potential food source, is lipid rich and of high quality. However, {{there are differences between}} the sites. The Darwin and Pelagia <b>Mounds</b> (N. <b>Rockall</b> Trough and N. Porcupine Bank, respectively) have higher proportions of labile particulate lipids (including high proportions of polyunsaturated fatty acids) in the benthic boundary layer than Logachev, Hovland and Belgica <b>Mounds</b> (<b>Rockall</b> Bank, S. Porcupine Bank and Porcupine Seabight, respectively). The high quality sPOM could be transported downslope from the euphotic zone. There is some evidence for inter-annual variability at some sites (e. g. Hovland and Logachev Mounds) as large differences in suspended lipid and particulate organic carbon concentrations were observed over the sampling period. Elevated total organic carbon contents of sediments at mound sites, relative to control sites in some cases (particularly Darwin Mounds), probably reflect local hydrodynamic control and the trapping of sPOM by the DWC. Fresh POM can be relatively rapidly transferred to significant depth (up to 8 cm) through bioturbation that is evident at all sites. There is no clear evidence of present day hydrocarbon seepage at any of the sites...|$|R
40|$|Meiobenthic {{community}} {{structure was}} investigated at different spatial scales (from 100 metres to centimetres) on and {{adjacent to a}} group of coral-topped sandy mounds in the bathyal north-east Atlantic (Darwin <b>Mounds,</b> <b>Rockall</b> Trough) and related to the environmental conditions in the area, mainly differences in sediment organic carbon content and presence of biogenic structures. Meiobenthos abundances were similar to those observed in other deep-sea sites, with nematodes representing at least 94 % of the total community. The dominant nematode genera were Microlaimus, followed by Sabatieria, Richtersia, Rhynchonema and Trefusia, together with typical deep-sea genera (e. g. Halalaimus and Acantholaimus). Multivariate analysis of nematode generic relative abundances at the different stations indicated that there was no significant influence on distribution resulting from large scale topographic and biogeochemical conditions around the mounds. The same genera were associated with dead tests of the xenophyophore Syringammina fragilissima and in the surrounding sediments. The vertical distribution of nematodes on and adjacent to the mound showed some unusual features, as the deeper layers of the sediments were inhabited by stilbonematids. These genera harbour ectosymbiotic, chemoautotrophic bacteria and have not previously been recorded from the deep sea. The occurrence of stilbonematids in notable numbers in the subsurface layers of the sediments {{in the vicinity of the}} Darwin Mounds provides evidence for the occurrence of anoxic microenvironments...|$|R
40|$|The {{aims of the}} M/V Franklin 0306 Cruise were {{to acquire}} high {{resolution}} multibeam, sidescan sonar and camera data over four areas of interest: Hatton Bank, Rosemary Bank, Wyville Thomson Ridge and the eastern flank of the Faroe–Shetland Channel. These four sites were chosen based on the remit of the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) area 7 (Figure 1) and {{the requirements of the}} Joint Nature and Conservation Committee (JNCC) for the assessment of potential Special Areas of Conservation (SAC) under the EC Habitats and Birds Directive (Annex 1). The work programme was highly successful with multibeam data and photographic “ground truthing” acquired at all the primary sites. The data revealed the presence of highly diverse biogenic reef present on numerous pinnacles on Hatton Bank, examples of which have never previously been recorded <b>west</b> of <b>Rockall</b> Bank (Roberts et al., 2005). Extensive rocky reef was imaged on the Wyville Thomson Ridge, comprising areas of bedrock outcrop and coarse gravel with associated fauna proven during camera operations. Areas of rippled sea bed were observed on Rosemary Bank and Hatton Bank and iceberg ploughmarks were identified on Rosemary Bank and Wyville Thomson Ridge. Survey in the Faroe–Shetland Channel targeted known down-slope sediment transport channels previously identified through studies funded by the Western Frontiers Association (Bulat and Long, 2001). Preliminary observations and interpretation of the data acquired {{during the course of this}} survey suggest that there are several sites which comply with EC Habitats and Birds Directive (Annex 1) as sites of conservation and steps should be taken to ensure their protection. Specifically, the areas of biogenic reef discovered on Hatton Bank and rocky reef on Wyville Thomson Ridge are primary sites for conservation. This is important especially with reference to the Wyville Thomson Ridge where several instances of anthropogenic debris were observed. Accurate mapping and recording of the area to the north and west of Scotland is important in balancing environmental protection and sustainable development with activities such as oil and gas exploration and exploitation, fishing, trawling and alternative energy programmes. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractUnderstanding the {{processes}} that drive the distribution patterns of organisms and the scales over which these processes operate are vital when considering the effective management of species with high commercial or conservation value. In the deep sea, the importance of scleractinian cold-water corals (CWCs) to fish {{has been the focus}} of several studies but their role remains unclear. We propose this may be due to the confounding effects of multiple drivers operating over multiple spatial scales. The aims of this study were to investigate the role of CWCs in shaping fish community structure and individual species-habitat associations across four spatial scales in the NE Atlantic ranging from “regions” (separated by > 500 km) to “substratum types” (contiguous). Demersal fish and substratum types were quantified from three regions: Logachev <b>Mounds,</b> <b>Rockall</b> Bank and Hebrides Terrace Seamount (HTS). PERMANOVA analyses showed significant differences in community composition between all regions which were most likely caused by differences in depths. Within regions, significant variation in community composition was recorded at scales of c. 20 – 3500 m. CWCs supported significantly different fish communities to non-CWC substrata at Rockall Bank, Logachev and the HTS. Single-species analyses using generalised linear mixed models showed that Sebastes sp. was strongly associated with CWCs at Rockall Bank and that Neocyttus helgae was more likely to occur in CWCs at the HTS. Depth had a significant effect on several other fish species. The results of this study suggest that the importance of CWCs to fish is species-specific and depends on the broader spatial context in which the substratum is found. The precautionary approach would be to assume that CWCs are important for associated fish, but must acknowledge that CWCs in different depths will not provide redundancy or replication within spatially-managed conservation networks...|$|R
