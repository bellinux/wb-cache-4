40|$|Abstract: <b>Worm</b> <b>gear</b> {{is usually}} made of bronze, {{which is a}} {{precious}} and nonferrous metal. In order to substitute for the bronze, {{a new kind of}} antifriction composite material of polymer-matrix, ZW- 1 material has been successfully developed. Compared with <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> made of bronze, <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> made of ZW- 1 material has made <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> transmission possess many advantageous properties. In order to bring the excellent properties of <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> transmission of ZW- 1 material into play and substitute for bronze, the test for anti-fracture capacity of <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> made of ZW- 1 material under static load has been made. A simple test-bed is designed. The test has been carried out under static load. The test of <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> with ZW- 1 and nylon materials, different teeth numbers、tooth width and tooth forms is made. The test findings show that in the test conditions the invalidation of ZW- 1 <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> is radial fracture in gear rim. Applying stress transmission theory and micrographic analysis, fracture mechanism of ZW- 1 material is found out, namely degumming on the interface between fiber and polymer. Anti-fracture capacity of <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> of ZW- 1 material is twenty three times as much as that of bronze worm gear(Q/ZB 125 - 73). Archimedes <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> has the same anti-fracture capacity as arc tooth <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> of ZW- 1 material. Macrographic analysis shows that load concentration and contact stress concentration of bolt hole caused by bending bolt are significant factors which affect invalidation of <b>worm</b> <b>gear.</b> The test result shows an important fact that overlapping coefficient of <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> transmission of ZW- 1 material <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> is much higher than that of calculating in theory, for small modulo of elasticity has a good effect upon the <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> transmission of ZW- 1 <b>worm</b> <b>gear...</b>|$|R

50|$|Often a <b>worm</b> <b>gearing</b> is used {{to reduce}} the high output speed of the {{electric}} motor. This enables a high reduction ratio within the gear stage, leading to a low efficiency which is desired for the actuators. The gearing is therefore self-locking i.e. it prevents accidental and undesired changes of the valve position by acting upon the valve’s closing element.|$|E

5000|$|The unusual engine layout was the S7's notable feature with {{an engine}} and drive {{similar to that}} of a car.

50|$|Mughal {{agriculture}} was advanced {{compared to}} Europe at the time, {{such as the}} common use of the seed drill among Indian peasants before its adoption in European agriculture. While the average peasant across the world was only skilled in growing very few crops, the average Indian peasant was skilled in growing {{a wide variety of}} food and non-food crops, increasing their productivity. Indian peasants were also quick to adapt to profitable new crops, such as maize and tobacco from the New World being rapidly adopted and widely cultivated across Mughal India between 1600 and 1650. Bengali peasants rapidly learned techniques of mulberry cultivation and sericulture, establishing Bengal Subah as a major silk-producing region of the world.
