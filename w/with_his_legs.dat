5|$|Turning Point {{is remembered}} for the {{disbanding}} of Triple X and for Elix Skipper pulling Chris Harris {{off the top}} of a cage <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>legs</b> to perform a move he named the New School. The PPV was also the final televised match of Randy Savage's career. The professional wrestling section of the Canadian Online Explorer website rated the event a 7 out of 10, which was the same as the 2005 event's rating.|$|E
5|$|Reproduction {{occurs in}} winter; the male stands over the female and forms a cage <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>legs</b> {{protecting}} {{her while she}} moults. Internal fertilisation takes place before the hardening of the new carapace, {{with the aid of}} two abdominal appendages (gonopods). After mating, the female retreats to a pit on the sea floor to lay her eggs. Between 250,000 and 3,000,000 fertilised eggs are held under the female's abdomen for up to eight months until they hatch.|$|E
5|$|A {{featured}} preliminary {{match on}} Turning Point's card {{was for the}} TNA X Division Championship, in which the champion, Petey Williams, defended the championship against Chris Sabin. The match was promoted for Turning Point on the November 12 episode of Impact!. In the weeks leading to the encounter, Sabin stated {{he had found a}} counter to Williams' finishing maneuver the Canadian Destroyer, which was thought to be uncounterable. The Canadian Destroyer involves Williams grabbing an opponent <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>legs</b> around their head, jumping over their back, causing them to perform a backflip, and forcing their head into the mat after they make the full rotation. Making true to his word, Sabin countered the move three times before Turning Point; one on the November 12, one of the November 19, and the last on the November 30 episodes of Impact!.|$|E

50|$|Schmid {{eventually}} recovered partial {{sight in}} one eye, but problems <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>leg</b> {{during the cold}} winters led him to retire in 1957 and move to St. Petersburg, Florida <b>with</b> <b>his</b> wife and two sons.|$|R
5|$|Outside {{the lecture}} room before the {{students}} arrived, according to testimony Starling and others gave in court, Starling cut the dog open again {{to inspect the}} results of the previous surgery, which took about 45 minutes, after which he clamped the wound with forceps and handed the dog over to Bayliss. Bayliss cut a new opening in the dog's neck to expose the lingual nerves of the salivary glands, to which he attached electrodes. The aim was to stimulate the nerves with electricity to demonstrate that salivary pressure was independent of blood pressure. The dog was then carried to the lecture theatre, stretched on his back on an operating board, <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>legs</b> tied to the board, his head clamped and his mouth muzzled.|$|E
5|$|Stanley Frederick Gibbs, GC (2 January 1909 – 3 March 1991) was an Australian {{shipping}} clerk and an exchange {{recipient of the}} George Cross, the highest civil decoration for heroism in the United Kingdom and formerly in the Commonwealth. On 3 January 1927, {{the day after his}} eighteenth birthday, Gibbs went to the rescue of 15-year-old Mervyn Allum during a shark attack at Port Hacking, New South Wales. He managed to fend off the shark by striking at it <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>legs</b> and fists and, with the assistance of a friend, pulled Allum clear of the water. Although Alllum died from his injuries, Gibbs was publicly praised by the coroner and local community leaders for his actions, and was subsequently awarded the Albert Medal.|$|E
5|$|The {{security}} services took Biko to the Walmer police station in Port Elizabeth, {{where he was}} held naked in a cell <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>legs</b> in shackles. On 6 September, he was transferred from Walmer to room 619 of the security police headquarters in the Sanlam Building in central Port Elizabeth, where he was interrogated for 22 hours, handcuffed and in shackles, and chained to a grille. Exactly what happened has never been ascertained, but during the interrogation he was severely beaten {{by at least one}} of the ten security police officers. He suffered three brain lesions that resulted in a massive brain haemorrhage on 6 September. Following this incident, Biko's captors forced him to remain standing and shackled to the wall. The police later said that Biko had attacked one of them with a chair, forcing them to subdue him and place him in handcuffs and leg irons.|$|E
50|$|A young army vet {{comes to}} Owen and, by extension, George and Callie {{to help him}} <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>leg.</b> Nobody can figure out what's wrong <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>leg</b> and thus can't fix it, he just wants it cut off {{so he can get}} a {{prosthetic}} leg and go back to war. Owen is ready to do it, but Callie is totally against cutting off a perfectly healthy leg. Cristina sees Owen hug George and asks what's wrong. Owen tells her that George has an announcement that's his own to make, but that Owen is ecstatic that he actually slept without any nightmares.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mercy me, {{the whole}} ranch is a hospital!" [...] cried Villa Kennan, two days later, {{as she came}} out on the broad sleeping-porch and {{regarded}} Harley and Jerry stretched out, the one <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>leg</b> in splints, the other <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>leg</b> in a plaster cast. [...] "Look at Michael," [...] she continued. [...] "You're not the only ones with broken bones. I've only just discovered that if his nose isn't broken, it ought to be, from the blow he must have received on it. I've had hot compresses on it for the last hour. Look at it!" ...|$|R
25|$|For all rounders, Pepper {{also scored}} 987 runs at 36.55, while Cristofani added 558 runs at 27.90. Pettiford scored 768 runs at 38.40 and took 22 wickets at 41.86 <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>leg</b> spin.|$|R
5|$|Albion's sole goalscoring {{opportunity}} {{of the second}} half came afterwards; Clark took the ball on a lengthy run before crossing it into the box, across an open goal with no Albion player there to tap the ball in and put the game beyond QPR's reach. Fifteen minutes {{from the end of the}} match QPR equalised, Marsh's shot with his right foot went in off the post. A corner followed for QPR who were now dominating Albion with their style of play. Allen crossed it in to Lazarus, but the Albion goalkeeper saved the shot <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>legs.</b> With eight minutes to go, one of Albion defenders mis-kicked the ball in their own penalty area. Hunt rushed in for the chance but Sheppard once again saved the game for Albion. The ball ran free to Mike Lazarus who tapped the ball into the back of an empty net to increase the scoreline to 3–2 in QPR's favour. A final attack from QPR came in the closing moments of the game as Lazarus took the ball past two defenders and into the box, his subsequent shot hit the outside of the post and went wide.|$|E
5|$|The humid weather {{meant that}} the game was played at a {{relatively}} slow pace, which seemed to favour Porto. This caused a number of rash challenges from Celtic, one of which led to Joos Valgaeren getting a yellow card on 8 minutes. After this {{it was very much}} a stoic affair, until 32 minutes into the first half when Capucho played in Deco, but he could do no more than fire his shot straight at Celtic's goalkeeper Robert Douglas. Straight after this attack Celtic broke on the counter with Henrik Larsson, putting Didier Agathe through on the right, but his cross was too high for Chris Sutton. Larsson had a chance to make it 1–0 on 35 minutes, but from Sutton's assist he was unable to make enough contact with the ball. Porto came close on 41 minutes when Deco moved past Bobo Baldé to go one on one against Robert Douglas, who saved Deco's shot <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>legs.</b> Porto finally found a way through on 45 minutes when, after an offensive play from Deco, Derlei followed up Dmitri Alenichev's shot on target, which had been saved by Robert Douglas. This gave Porto a 1–0 lead on the stroke of half time and Derlei's 11th goal of the competition.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Francis Lawrence. The video opens within a black cube {{with an array of}} different colored lights with several people dancing. The video inter-cuts to Justin Timberlake singing to the song. Timberlake then floats to the floor from an opening in the cubic's ceiling, performing choreography with his supporting dancers and singing to the track's first verse. Throughout the video, it inter-cuts to Timberlake dancing by himself, with the sections sometimes featuring the camera panning around Timberlake's face. Entering the second verse, Timberlake is in the cube on his own, manipulating the motion of the cube with his hands, <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>legs</b> following the moving platform. Timberlake then returns performing choreography again with his dancers. Following the second chorus, Timberlake is dancing with a female (Staci Flood), who lip syncs Vanessa Marquez's section. A break-down of the song, where Timberlake is beatboxing, shows him dancing by himself. The beatboxing section of the song is only available in the music video version, the album version cuts the beatboxing out. The breakdown then ends, with the video continuing with Timberlake and his back-up dancers. The closing beat boxing section of the track features the camera panning around several duplicates of Timberlake beatboxing and talking in sync to the song's lyrics. The video ends with the final Timberlake duplicate pointing and running towards the opposite direction.|$|E
60|$|Buffalo Bill {{was in a}} horse-litter, <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>leg</b> {{broken by}} a bullet, and Mongrel and Blake Haskins's horse were doing the work. Buffalo Bill and Thorndike had lolled both of those toughs.|$|R
50|$|During his career, Todd {{was also}} a {{proficient}} district cricketer for Northcote during the summers, playing 117 first XI games over twelve seasons, taking 204 wickets <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>leg</b> breaks and averaging 33.6 with the bat.|$|R
60|$|But Bert {{had put on}} {{the brakes}} with such suddenness that she found herself {{involved}} <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>leg</b> as he dismounted. She got {{to the side of}} the road and hastily readjusted her hat, which had suffered.|$|R
25|$|Alexander {{was carried}} by sleigh to the Winter Palace to his study where {{almost the same}} day twenty years earlier, he had signed the Emancipation Edict freeing the serfs. Alexander was {{bleeding}} to death, <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>legs</b> torn away, his stomach ripped open, and his face mutilated. Members of the Romanov family came rushing to the scene.|$|E
25|$|The {{life cycle}} of the desert locust {{consists}} of three stages, the egg, the nymph known as a hopper, and the winged adult. Copulation takes place when a mature male hops {{onto the back of}} a mature female and grips her body <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>legs.</b> Sperm is transferred from the tip of his abdomen to the tip of hers, where it is stored. The process takes several hours and one insemination is sufficient for a number of batches of eggs.|$|E
25|$|Kelvin's clothed {{body was}} found by a {{geologist}} on 24 July 1983. Little effort was put into concealing the body; Kelvin was found wearing the same Channel 9 shirt, blue jeans and white sneakers which he wore {{on the day of}} his abduction, together with the dog collar fitted around his neck. The {{body was found}} placed in the fetal position, <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>legs</b> bent towards his chest and his head forwards and his arms wrapped around his legs. This made police suspect that Kelvin had been dumped by a single person, most likely after nightfall in order to avoid detection.|$|E
5|$|In 1947, {{a man is}} {{attacked}} while {{fixing a}} flat tire on the road near the Pine Barrens in New Jersey. His corpse is later found <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>leg</b> chewed off, and a hairy humanoid is killed nearby.|$|R
50|$|Blackburn drove {{locomotive}} engines around Peronne and in Flanders without misfortune. However, Blackburn did {{experience some}} problems <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>leg</b> {{during the cold}} winter months, experiencing severe numbing. The cold conditions caused his calf to shrink from 16 to 9 inches.|$|R
60|$|Mr Barnacle {{would see}} him. Would he walk up-stairs? He would, and he did; {{and in the}} drawing-room, <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>leg</b> on a rest, he found Mr Barnacle himself, the express image and presentment of How not to do it.|$|R
25|$|Miller, in one {{spirited}} over, {{altered the}} whole {{course of the}} game. With the third ball of that eventful over he trapped Hutton <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>legs</b> {{in front of the}} wicket trying to defend against an inswinger which moved in late. The value of Miller's bowling lies wholly and solely in its surprise element. Just when he appears to be well {{under the control of the}} batsman he comes to light with a ball that can upset anyone...with the sixth ball of the over Compton played-on before he had opened his score. The seventh and eighth balls did everything else but put paid to Parkhouse's account. Miller deserved every bit of the thunderous applause which the big crowd handed him when the over was completed.|$|E
25|$|On 1 December 1948 at 6:30am, {{the police}} were {{contacted}} after {{the body of a}} man was discovered on Somerton beach near Glenelg, about 11 kilometres (6.8mi) southwest of Adelaide, South Australia. The man was found lying in the sand across from the Crippled Children's Home, which was on the corner of The Esplanade and Bickford Terrace. He was lying back with his head resting against the seawall, <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>legs</b> extended and his feet crossed. It was believed he had died while sleeping. An unlit cigarette was on the right collar of his coat. A search of his pockets revealed an unused second-class rail ticket from Adelaide to Henley Beach, a bus ticket from the city that could not be proved to have been used, a narrow aluminium American comb, a half-empty packet of Juicy Fruit chewing gum, an Army Club cigarette packet containing seven Kensitas cigarettes, and a quarter-full box of Bryant & May matches.|$|E
25|$|On USC's next possession, Leinart {{drove his}} team into Texas territory, {{this time to}} the 25-yard line, before {{throwing}} an interception to Texas free safety Michael Griffin, {{who appeared to be}} out of the play but ran halfway across the field before making a leaping catch and barely staying in-bounds in the end zone. The turnover ended a second Trojans' drive with USC in scoring position. On the following Texas drive, Young connected with wide receiver Limas Sweed, who caught eight balls for 65yards on the day, for a key first down. Young then led his team <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>legs,</b> capping the drive by running 10yards before throwing a lateral pass to open running back Selvin Young, who ran for 12 more for the touchdown. The lateral, made after Young's knee had touched the ground, was not reviewed because of issues with the replay equipment. The game continued with a failed extra-point attempt by Texas, which, not knowing of the equipment issues, appeared to rush the kick to get the play off before the prior play could be reviewed. The NCAA football-officiating coordinator later asserted that Young's knee had been down, and expressed confusion about how the call had been handled.|$|E
50|$|Henbit {{returned}} from the race with a large swelling on his right foreleg, and examinations revealed that he had sustained a hairline fracture to his cannon bone. The horse was confined to his box for three months <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>leg</b> in plaster.|$|R
500|$|The {{restricted}} area {{also does not}} apply if the secondary defender jumps in attempting to block the shot, the offensive player leads <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>leg</b> or knee in an unnatural motion or uses his off arm to prevent the defender from blocking his shot.|$|R
50|$|Innovated by Chris Hero, this {{variation}} of the cloverleaf sees the wrestler hook the legs like a cloverleaf but weaves his hands through to clasp his other hand and also hooks the ankle sticking out <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>leg</b> (left or right) into his kneepit.|$|R
25|$|If {{the match}} is not ended by a fall, {{technical}} fall, default, or disqualification, the referee then prepares both wrestlers {{to begin the}} second period. After the first period ends, one wrestler will have the choice of starting position in the second period. In dual meets, this {{is determined by the}} colored disk toss that took place before the meet began. In tournaments, the referee will toss a colored disk, with a green-colored side and a red-colored side, and the winner of that disk toss will have the choice of position. The wrestler could choose between the neutral position, or as is most commonly chosen to begin in a place called the referee's position on the mat. The referee's position has both wrestlers beginning action {{at the center of the}} mat with one wrestler (in the defensive starting position) on the bottom with his hands spread apart in front of the forward starting line and his knees spread apart behind the rear starting line <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>legs</b> held together. The other wrestler on the top (in the offensive starting position) then kneels beside him with one arm wrapped around the bottom wrestler's waist (with the palm of his hand against the opponent's navel) and the other hand on or over the back of the opponent's near elbow for control. Most often, the wrestler with the choice chooses the defensive (bottom) position because of the relative ease of scoring an escape or reversal in comparison to a near fall. The wrestler could also defer his choice to the beginning of the third period.|$|E
500|$|On December 4, 2013, Gaga tweeted {{that she}} was intent on making the video [...] "perfect" [...] since it was unlike her {{previous}} endeavors, adding that it was [...] "very personal". Two days later, Richardson posted a black-and-white photo from {{the set of the}} video, which showed Gaga being held by Kelly; with her legs wrapped around his waist. She wore nothing but a black bikini, while Kelly gestured his middle finger towards the camera in a leather pant/kilt dress. One week later, a colored behind-the-scenes photo was released, showing the singers in the same garments as the previous image, while Kelly stood <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>legs</b> spread apart as Gaga crawled in between them.|$|E
500|$|Liverpool {{continued}} to dominate proceedings {{in the second}} half; The Observer football correspondent Frank McGhee noted Arsenal's [...] "obvious need for a more adventurous approach." [...] The club's fans demanded Marwood's introduction to the match, and in the 58th minute the player came on for Caesar. This meant Arsenal's formation was tweaked to 4–4–2, with a flat back four defence. Arsenal {{found it hard to}} contain the Liverpool attack; Lukic saved an effort from Beardsley one-handed, but only could turn the ball out for a corner. A pass by Ronnie Whelan managed to split the Arsenal defence and find Nicol; Winterburn however {{put an end to the}} move with a tackle. David Burrows's attempt on goal was blocked by O'Leary later on and Lukic did enough to save Rush's shot <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>legs.</b>|$|E
50|$|On August 15, 2009, Melendez {{was again}} set to rematch Josh Thomson at Strikeforce: Carano vs. Cyborg but Thomson was not cleared to fight, due to {{lingering}} problems <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>leg.</b> Mitsuhiro Ishida {{was selected to}} replace Thomson in what became Melendez' first Interim title defense.|$|R
60|$|Norris {{had stopped}} a {{straight}} one <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>leg.</b> He had made fifty-one {{in his best}} manner, and the School, leaving the form-rooms at the exact moment when the fatal ball was being bowled, were {{just in time to}} applaud him and realize what they had missed.|$|R
