5|$|After its rediscovery, {{observers}} often {{assumed that}} the image was always used as a call to inspire women workers to join the war effort. However, during the war the image <b>was</b> <b>strictly</b> internal to Westinghouse, displayed only during February 1943, and was not for recruitment but to exhort already-hired women to work harder. Feminists and others have seized upon the uplifting attitude and apparent message to remake the image into many different forms, including self empowerment, campaign promotion, advertising, and parodies.|$|E

The governor of Germania Inferior, Aulus Bucius Lappius Maximus, moved to the region at once, assisted by the procurator of Rhaetia, Titus Flavius Norbanus. From Spain, Trajan was summoned, while Domitian himself came from Rome with the Praetorian Guard.|$|E

5000|$|Proof. One of the {{definitions}} of irreducibility for non-negative matrices is that for all indexes i,j there exists m, such that (Am)ij <b>is</b> <b>strictly</b> positive. Given a non-negative eigenvector v, and {{that at least one}} of its components say j-th <b>is</b> <b>strictly</b> positive, the corresponding eigenvalue <b>is</b> <b>strictly</b> positive, indeed, given n such that (An)ii >0, hence: rnvi =Anvi ≥(An)iivi >0. Hence r <b>is</b> <b>strictly</b> positive. The eigenvector is strict positivity. Then given m, such that (Am)ij >0, hence: rmvj =(Amv)j ≥(Am)ijvi >0, hence vj <b>is</b> <b>strictly</b> positive, i.e., the eigenvector <b>is</b> <b>strictly</b> positive.|$|R

5|$|France were {{ejected from}} the Five Nations in 1932 after being accused of professionalism in the French leagues {{at a time when}} rugby union <b>was</b> <b>strictly</b> amateur. Forced to play against weaker opposition, France went on a winning streak; winning ten games in a row during the years from 1931 to 1936. France was invited to rejoin the Five Nations in 1939 but did not compete until 1947 as {{international}} rugby was suspended during World War II.|$|E

Both he {{and his older brother}} John, were admitted to Lincoln's Inn in 1622. In the same year, Temple was given permission by the privy council to travel abroad for up to three years. He was allowed to take a servant with him, but he <b>was</b> <b>strictly</b> forbidden to visit Rome.|$|E
5|$|Inscriptions record 268 {{different}} occupations in {{the city}} of Rome, and 85 in Pompeii. Professional associations or trade guilds (collegia) are attested {{for a wide range of}} occupations, including fishermen (piscatores), salt merchants (salinatores), olive oil dealers (olivarii), entertainers (scaenici), cattle dealers (pecuarii), goldsmiths (aurifices), teamsters (asinarii or muliones), and stonecutters (lapidarii). These are sometimes quite specialized: one collegium at Rome <b>was</b> <b>strictly</b> limited to craftsmen who worked in ivory and citrus wood.|$|E
5|$|Michael and Olga {{frequently}} went on {{hikes in}} the forests around Gatchina with their father, who {{took the opportunity to}} teach them woodsmanship. Physical activities such as equestrianism were also taught at an early age, as was religious observance.

5|$|The Grand Duchess and her {{siblings}} were taught {{at home by}} private tutors. Subjects included history, geography, Russian, English and French, as well as drawing and dancing. Physical activities such as equestrianism were taught at an early age, and they became expert riders. The family was deeply religious.

5|$|Bartolomé de las Casas spent 50 {{years of}} his life {{actively}} fighting slavery and the violent colonial abuse of indigenous peoples, especially by trying to convince the Spanish court to adopt a more humane policy of colonization. Unlike the other priests who sought to destroy all of the indigenous peoples native books and writings, he <b>was</b> <b>strictly</b> opposed to this action. Although he failed to save the indigenous peoples of the Western Indies, his efforts resulted in several improvements in the legal status of the natives, and in an increased colonial focus on the ethics of colonialism. Las Casas is often seen {{as one of the first}} advocates for universal conception of human dignity (later human rights).|$|E
5|$|Because he {{persistently}} programmed {{works that}} did not attract the public, Beecham's musical activities at this time consistently lost money. As {{a result of his}} estrangement from his father between 1899 and 1909, his access to the Beecham family fortune <b>was</b> <b>strictly</b> limited. From 1907 he had an annuity of £700 left to him in his grandfather's will, and his mother subsidised some of his loss-making concerts, {{but it was not until}} father and son were reconciled in 1909 that Beecham was able to draw on the family fortune to promote opera.|$|E

5|$|Duhalde was {{appointed}} {{president in the}} aftermath of the September 11 attacks, when the foreign policy of the United States <b>was</b> <b>strictly</b> focused on the War on Terror. Initially, the Argentine society was divided on how to manage the bilateral relations with the US. One group wanted to keep the close relations of the previous decade, as Argentina might need foreign help to deal with the crisis. The other group preferred to maintain more distant relations. Duhalde sought to strike a balance between both options, and eventually leaned towards the second when the US refused to help Argentina.|$|E
5|$|Hannah de Rothschild {{was born}} in 1851 {{into a world of}} great wealth and luxury. She was the granddaughter of Baron Nathan Mayer Rothschild, who had founded N M Rothschild & Sons, the English branch of the Rothschilds' banking empire. Niall Ferguson states in his History of the House of Rothschild that by the mid-19th century the Rothschilds {{regarded}} themselves as the nearest thing the Jews of Europe had to a royal family, and the equals of royalty. Whether or not this <b>was</b> <b>strictly</b> true, the many Rothschild homes and their art collections, in England, Austria, France and Germany, certainly rivalled those of the crowned heads of Europe.|$|E

5|$|In the United Kingdom, {{access to}} illegal content (such as child pornography) <b>was</b> <b>strictly</b> {{self-regulated}} by individual internet service providers. This began when BT Group introduced Cleanfeed, a server-side filtering system which uses {{data obtained from}} the Internet Watch Foundation. The IWF is a Quango organisation that operates a website where users can report web pages containing illegal or dubious content {{to be added to}} their blacklists. This was implemented in order to prevent users from accessing this material, since it is illegal to possess an indecent image of a child under the age of 18 per the Protection of Children Act. British ISPs were later obligated by the government to implement filters for illegal content by the beginning of 2007.|$|E

The Motor City Machine Guns represented Team TNA in the contest, while the team of Tyson Dux and Daivari fought for Team International. The Motor City Machine Guns won the encounter by pinfall at 13 minutes when Shelley forced Daivari head-first into the mat with his signature Sliced Bread#2 maneuver.|$|E
5|$|The Assembly <b>was</b> <b>strictly</b> {{under the}} control of Parliament, and was only to debate topics which Parliament directed. Assembly members were not {{permitted}} to state their disagreements with majority opinions or share any information about the proceedings, except in writing to Parliament. Parliament chose William Twisse, an internationally respected theologian, to be the Assembly's prolocutor or chairman. Due to Twisse's ill health, Cornelius Burges, whom Parliament appointed as one of several assessors, served as prolocutor pro tempore for most of the Assembly. Twenty-two appointed members of the Assembly died before 1649, and they along with those who did not attend for other reasons were replaced by another nineteen members. Three non-voting scribes were also added in 1643.|$|E
