500|$|Def Leppard's Pyromania, later {{certified}} 10x platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), reached {{number two}} on the Billboard 200. The singles [...] "Foolin'", [...] "Photograph", and [...] "Rock of Ages", helped {{by the emergence of}} MTV, reached the Top 40. Pyromanias style was widely emulated, particularly by the emerging Californian scene. However, remarked Leppard's Joe Elliott, [...] "I don't know how anybody could confuse us with that lot. We weren't even around when all those so-called glam bands came up. We were in fuckin' Holland making Hysteria. While they were out banging chicks or whatever, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> windmills and playing pool on a table without any pockets. We were as far away from LA as any band could be." ...|$|E
500|$|Since the flood, Grand Forks' {{recovery}} {{has been}} used as a model by other communities which have suffered from natural disasters. After Hurricane Katrina hit several U.S. states in 2005, Grand Forks adopted the city of Biloxi, Mississippi. Current Grand Forks mayor Michael Brown stated that it was important [...] "to utilize the experience from those people who went through those disasters, like our fire chief, police chief and public works directors. So we went to Biloxi and said, 'This is what we have learned.'" [...] Grand Forks leaders met with Biloxi city officials, and sent a list of contacts and a 24-page booklet that detailed how to coordinate volunteer agencies and how to interact with FEMA. One Biloxi city official stated that Grand Forks had [...] "just helped us to understand what <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at,</b> and gave us some direction to go in, which was really needed, with the rebuilding and the recovering." ...|$|E
500|$|In his 1961 article [...] "The Abstract Sublime", {{originally}} published in ARTnews, the art historian Robert Rosenblum drew comparisons between the Romantic landscape paintings of both Friedrich and Turner with the Abstract Expressionist paintings of Mark Rothko. Rosenblum specifically describes Friedrich's 1809 painting The Monk by the Sea, Turner's The Evening Star and Rothko's 1954 Light, Earth and Blue as revealing affinities of vision and feeling. According to Rosenblum, [...] "Rothko, like Friedrich and Turner, places us {{on the threshold of}} those shapeless infinities discussed by the aestheticians of the Sublime. The tiny monk in the Friedrich and the fisher in the Turner establish a poignant contrast between the infinite vastness of a pantheistic God and the infinite smallness of His creatures. In the abstract language of Rothko, such literal detail—a bridge of empathy between the real spectator and the presentation of a transcendental landscape—is no longer necessary; we ourselves are the monk before the sea, standing silently and contemplatively before these huge and soundless pictures as if <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> a sunset or a moonlit night." ...|$|E

500|$|Criticism of Irwin's career {{following}} his death came from Dan Mathews, vice-president {{of the animal}} rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. Comparing Irwin to a [...] "cheap reality TV star", Mathews accused him of [...] "antagonising frightened wild animals ... a very dangerous message to send to children", contrasted his methods with the behaviour of [...] "a responsible conservationist like Jacques Cousteau", {{and said it was}} [...] "no shock at all that Steve Irwin should die provoking a dangerous animal." [...] The son of Jacques Cousteau, Jean-Michel Cousteau—also a producer of wildlife documentaries—took issue with Irwin's [...] "very, very spectacular, dramatic way of presenting things" [...] and suggested instead that [...] "You don't touch nature, you just look at it." [...] Jacques Cousteau's grandson and Jean-Michel's nephew, Philippe Cousteau Jr., on the other hand, called Irwin [...] "a remarkable individual"; describing the Ocean's Deadliest project (on which he worked along with Irwin), Philippe said, [...] "I think why Steve was so excited about it that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> these animals that people think of as, you know, dangerous and deadly monsters, and they're not. They all have an important place in the environment and in the world. And that was what his whole message was about." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the film, actors provide voiceovers for {{the main}} creatures. Director Barry Cook said the {{original}} plan was for the film to be without dialogue or narration. He said, [...] "I think originally, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> a film that could stand alone as a virtual silent movie... You can turn the soundtrack off and still get involved with the story and feel the emotions of the characters. In its final version, the movie has a narration and goes inside {{the heads of the}} animals, so you can hear what they're thinking." [...] Executives at 20th Century Fox, one of the film's main distributors, viewed a rough cut and felt the film needed voiceovers so children in the audience could connect to the characters.|$|E

After we had {{been in and out}} of several shops, we saw two different elegant-looking wool materials in Fat Yanko’s store at Bahçekapısı (between Eminönü and Sirkeci in Istanbul, now called Bahçekapı). One of them was quite dark red, resembling the cherry colour, and the other a rich yellow with a touch of orange. When the sales clerk made the two fabrics fly together with a twist of his hand they became so bright that it reminded us of the beauty of a goldfinch. We thought <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> the colours flickering in burning fire. We were picturing the yellow-red flames shining on our team and dreaming that it would take us to victories. Indeed it did.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Neither Sherman nor Virgo made {{an effort}} to promote the album or contact other DJs. Reflecting on this, Gabriele of PopMatters felt that [...] "it's {{testament}} to the emotional resonance of the music itself that it grew over the years into something of an underground classic. Sanders has said: [...] "See Eric and I were so kinda, sometimes I actually kinda regret it, 'cause we were so detached from everything. [...] We were really just about the music. As soon as that was done, we were going back and still working on new stuff. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> that as just a foot in the door to do something even bigger." [...] As the Radical Records album was solely attributed to Virgo, confusion arose over the band's identity as it [...] "gained traction over the ensuing years." [...] Alexis Petridis stated that [...] "no artist sums up the unknowability and mystique of the early house scene quite like Virgo." ...|$|E

Her fingers were white and wrinkled with washing, and the soap-suds were yet smoking which she wiped off her arms. But for this, she might have been a child playing at washing and imitating a poor working-woman with a quick observation of the truth.|$|E

All at once, just as <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> him, Tony went over backward and apparently tumbled head foremost down his father's well.|$|E
