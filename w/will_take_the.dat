Early intervention for disorganized attachment, or other problematic styles, is directed toward changing the trajectory of development to provide a better outcome later in the person's life.|$|E

5|$|Aphids {{and other}} hemipteran insects secrete a sweet liquid called {{honeydew}}, when they feed on plant sap. The sugars in honeydew are a high-energy food source, which many ant species collect. In some cases, the aphids secrete the honeydew {{in response to}} ants tapping them with their antennae. The ants in turn keep predators away from the aphids and will move them from one feeding location to another. When migrating to a new area, many colonies <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> aphids with them, to ensure a continued supply of honeydew. Ants also tend mealybugs to harvest their honeydew. Mealybugs may become a serious pest of pineapples if ants are present to protect mealybugs from their natural enemies.|$|E

Daniel reveals to Betty that he knows about her new job and tells her he is fine about it. However, he later burns her contract release form and tells her that he is angry that she is leaving. Daniel then offers Betty a promotion, which she turns down. Daniel does not turn up to her farewell party and Betty says goodbye to her family.|$|E

5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the Kwan Um School of Zen, people became Dharma Teachers rather quickly, mostly out of need in order to run practice. The current requirement is that a person must take the five precepts after at least four days of retreat, or an agreed upon time by the guiding teacher of a Zen Center. To become a Dharma Teacher in Training <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> individual the minimum of two years after taking the five precepts. This also can only be approved of by the guiding teacher. The student will then take the ten precepts. To become a Dharma Teacher, one must complete a minimum of two years of training as a Dharma Teacher in Training that includes a course of study and certain amount of time attending retreats and serving certain practice roles. It takes a minimum of five years after becoming a Dharma Teacher to become a Senior Dharma Teacher and this must be approved by the guiding teacher. At this time, the person <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> sixteen precepts. Receiving inga (inka) only comes when a student has proven satisfactorily in further training sanctioned by a Zen Master and members of the school. Becoming a Zen Master will require the sanction of several Zen Masters in and outside the school.|$|E
5|$|Like most Old World warblers, {{this small}} species is insectivorous, moving restlessly though foliage or briefly hovering. It has been {{recorded}} as taking insects, mainly flies, from more than 50 families, along with other small and medium-sized invertebrates. It <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> eggs and larvae of butterflies and moths, particularly those of the winter moth. The chiffchaff has been estimated to require about one-third of its weight in insects daily, and it feeds almost continuously in the autumn to put on extra fat as fuel for the long migration flight.|$|E
5|$|The worm {{starts at}} some point of an {{infinite}} triangular grid. It starts moving along {{one of the six}} gridlines that meet at each point and, once it has travelled one unit of distance, it arrives at a new point. The worm then decides, based on the distribution of traversed and untraversed gridlines, what direction it <b>will</b> <b>take.</b> <b>The</b> directions are relative to the worm's point of view. If the worm has not encountered this exact distribution before it may leave along any untraversed gridline. From then on, if it encounters that distribution again, it must move in the same way. If there are no untraversed gridlines available, the worm dies and the simulation ends.|$|E

5|$|Both Crex crakes are omnivorous, {{but mainly}} feed on invertebrates, {{including}} earthworms, slugs and snails, spiders, beetles, dragonflies, grasshoppers and other insects. The corn crake may take pests such as Sitona weevils, leatherjackets and wireworms. In Africa, termites, cockroaches and dung beetles may be consumed. These opportunist hunters <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> occasional vertebrate {{such as a}} small frog, rodent or fish. Food is taken from the ground, low-growing plants and from inside grass tussocks; the crake may search leaf litter with its bill, and run in pursuit of active prey. In Africa, both species will occasionally feed on grassy tracks or dirt roads. Plant material is eaten, especially grass seeds, but also green shoots, leaves and other seeds. As with other rails, grit is swallowed to help break up food in the stomach. Indigestible material is regurgitated as pellets. Chicks are fed mainly on animal food. Crex crakes forage singly, in pairs or in family groups, sometimes {{in association with the}} other member of the genus or with other grassland birds such as great snipes, blue quails and common quails.|$|E
5|$|Caprica-Six and Boomer {{are next}} shown conversing with Number Three. While the three move up a stairwell, {{explosives}} {{set by the}} resistance led by Samuel T. Anders (Michael Trucco) detonate, trapping Anders, Three, Boomer, and Caprica-Six in a parking garage. While Anders is originally shielded and hidden by the blast, Caprica-Six breaks her leg. Number Three offers to euthanize her, but Caprica-Six refuses as she suspects that Number Three <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> opportunity to box her. Shortly afterwards, the three find Anders who Number Three intends to kill before being stopped by Boomer and Caprica-Six. As Number Three goads them, Boomer and Caprica-Six understand that their unique view of humanity through their love for Baltar and Galen Tyrol gives them a perspective that makes them {{a threat to the}} Cylon status-quo. When Number Three attempts to kill Anders, she is killed by Caprica-Six who, along with Boomer, allow Anders to escape. Recognizing that it will take some time for Number Three to resurrect and report them, Caprica-Six and Boomer form a pact to change the Cylon perspective of humanity together before finally being rescued from the collapsed parking garage by the other Cylons.|$|E
5|$|Following lengthy {{discussions between}} Royal Mail {{managers}} and union representatives {{a deal to}} settle the dispute was finally agreed to on 8 March 2010. This would see Royal Mail workers receiving a 6.9% pay rise over three years (worth 2% in 2010, 1.4% in 2011 and 3.5% in 2012), while extra payments worth up to £1,400 would be made to full-time workers once all the agreed changes have been made. These <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> form of a £400 payment following the agreement of union members and a further £1,000 to be paid once the planned changes have been implemented. In addition the Royal Mail agreed to keep 75% of the workforce as full-time, rather than part-time staff, and to reduce working hours from 40 to 39 hours a week. In exchange, the CWU agreed to Royal Mail's modernisation strategy which include plans to introduce the automated walk sequencing machinery.|$|E

5|$|Meeting Sweet at The Bronze, Buffy {{offers a}} deal to Sweet: she <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> place of her sister if she can’t kill him. When asked by Sweet what she thinks about life, Buffy gives her pessimistic take on its meaning ("Something to Sing About"). When the others arrive, she divulges that Willow took her from heaven, and Willow reacts with horror at finding out what she’s done. Upon divulging this truth, Buffy gives up on singing and dances so frenetically that she begins to smoke — {{on the verge of}} combusting as Sweet’s other victims have been shown to do — until Spike stops her, telling her {{that the only way to}} go forward is to just keep living her life. Xander then reveals that he, not Dawn, called Sweet, hoping he would be shown a happy ending for his {{marriage}} plans. Sweet, after releasing Xander from the obligation to be Sweet's “bride”, tells the group how much fun they have been ("What You Feel—Reprise") and disappears. The Scoobies realize that their relationships have been changed irreversibly by the secrets revealed in their songs ("Where Do We Go from Here?"). Spike leaves The Bronze, but Buffy follows him out, and they kiss ("Coda").|$|E
