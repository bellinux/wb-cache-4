Hitler's journey through his home country Austria became a triumphal tour that reached its climax in Vienna on 15 March 1938, when around 200,000 cheering German Austrians gathered around the Heldenplatz (Square of Heroes) to hear Hitler say that [...] "The oldest eastern province of the German people shall be, from this point on, the newest bastion of the German Reich" [...] followed by his [...] "greatest accomplishment" [...] (completing the annexing of Austria to form a Greater German Reich) by saying [...] "Als Führer und Kanzler der deutschen Nation und des Reiches melde ich vor der deutschen Geschichte nunmehr den Eintritt meiner Heimat in das Deutsche Reich." [...] Translation: [...] "As leader and chancellor of the German nation and Reich I announce to German history now the entry of my homeland into the German Reich." [...] After the Anschluss, Hitler remarked as a personal note: [...] "I, myself, as Führer and Chancellor, <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> walk on the soil of the country that is my home as a free German citizen." ...|$|E

In Act I, for example, Fred describes Mrs. Van Brugh as [...] "beloved, honoured, and courted by all" [...] – {{a phrase that}} Mrs. Van Brugh will repeat in her Act II scene with Smailey (as seen in the quote to the right): [...] "Woman—loved, honoured, courted by all. Woman—shunned, loathed, and unutterably despised, but still—Woman", foreshadowing the change in status that she will undergo {{by the end of}} the play. Ruth, in her Act I description of people who claimed to be trying to help her, describes people who have claimed to be trying to help her before: [...] "There's ladies come odd times. I call to mind one—come in a carriage she did. [...] Same story—poor, miserable, lost one—wretched, abandoned, fellow-creetur, and that." [...] This gets echoed in Mr. Smailey's catchphrase, [...] "I have no desire to press hardly on any fellow creature" [...] (also seen in the quote), which becomes more and more ironic in usage as the play goes on, finally being uttered by Fitz-Partington as he informs Mr. Smailey: [...] "I desire to press hardly on no fellow-creature, but your own policeman is without, and he <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> walk off with you whenever you find it convenient to be arrested." ...|$|E
