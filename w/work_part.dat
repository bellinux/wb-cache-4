25|$|After {{returning}} to London in 1835, {{and using a}} small legacy to purchase a house in Marylebone, Palmer produced less mystical and more conventional <b>work.</b> <b>Part</b> of his reason in {{returning to}} London was to sell his work and earn money from private teaching. He had better health on his return to London, and was by then married to Hannah, daughter of the painter John Linnell who he had known {{since she was a}} child, and married when she was nineteen and he was thirty-two. He sketched in Devonshire and Wales around this time. His peaceful vision of rural England had been disillusioned by the violent rural discontent of the early 1830s. His small financial legacy was running out and he decided to produce work more in line with public taste if he was to earn an income for himself and his wife. He was following the advice of his father-in-law. Linnell, who had earlier shown remarkable understanding of the uniqueness of William Blake's genius, was not as generous with his son-in-law, towards whom his attitude was authoritarian and often harsh.|$|E

With {{the launch of}} the magazine considered successful, Thompson was offered an opportunity to intern in Japan with Shueisha's editors, but declined, {{due to a lack of}} interest in the management aspects of the business and a desire to work on his own projects. After six issues had been released, Thompson desired to work on authoring and illustrating his own comic The Stiff. Reflecting back later, he states in an interview with The Comics Journal that [...] "I basically told Viz that I wanted to <b>work</b> <b>part</b> time or I'd quit. It probably wasn't a really nice thing to do." [...] He eventually stepped down as editor-in-chief, being replaced by his former boss Yumi Hoashi.|$|E

500|$|The Treehouse of Horror episodes are {{difficult}} {{for both the}} writers and the animators. The episodes were originally written {{at the beginning of}} the production run, but in later seasons they were written at the end and aired {{at the beginning of the}} next season as holdovers, giving the animators more time to <b>work.</b> <b>Part</b> of the difficulty for the animators is that the episodes always involve many complex backgrounds, new characters, and new designs. They {{are difficult}} for the writers because they must produce three stories, an opening and, in the early episodes, a wraparound. They would have to try to fit all of this into a 20–22minute episode. The episodes often go through many last minute changes, with rewrites requiring new lines to be recorded. [...] "Treehouse of Horror III" [...] in particular underwent somewhere between 80 and 100 line changes in the six-week period between the arrival of the animation from Korea and the airing of the episode. By the fourth season, executive producers Al Jean and Mike Reiss were less enamored of Treehouse of Horror episodes and considered dropping them, but the other writers insisted that they be kept.|$|E

Gurdjieff used a number of different methods and materials, including meetings, music, movements (sacred dance), writings, lectures, and innovative forms of group and individual <b>work.</b> <b>Part</b> of the function of these various methods was to undermine and undo the ingrained habit patterns of the mind and bring about moments of insight. Since each individual has different requirements, Gurdjieff did not have a one-size-fits-all approach, and he adapted and innovated as circumstance required. In Russia he was described as keeping his teaching confined to a small circle, whereas in Paris and North America he gave numerous public demonstrations.|$|E

2500|$|In {{describing}} his own work, Chalfant stated the following: [...] "Many {{of the forms}} I create, reminiscent of architecture and objects of suggested utility, security and protection, are used as metaphors for our psychological behavior, and for the phenomenology of the body. Architectural furnishing structures like a chair and table, allow me to explore specific polar states {{that are relevant to}} the structure and also to the personal psyche such as; large/small, inside/outside, private/public, adult/child, beginning/end, birth/death. [...] The sculptures that I create are a means to reflect certain elements of our society. Paradox is probably the most poignant in my <b>work.</b> <b>Part</b> of the narrative in my pieces {{has to do with the}} human condition and in particular today's youth. Connotations of purity; innocence and promise are being subjected to some of the elements of the environment around it, which are disrespect, danger, violence and abuse." ...|$|E
2500|$|The true {{beginnings}} of Polish philosophy, however, reach {{back to the}} thirteenth century and Witelo (c. 1230– c. 1314), a Silesian born to a Polish mother and a Thuringian settler, a contemporary of Thomas Aquinas who had spent {{part of his life}} in Italy at centers of the highest intellectual culture. [...] In addition to being a philosopher, he was a scientist who specialized in optics. [...] His famous treatise, Perspectiva, while drawing on the Arabic Book of Optics by Alhazen, was unique in Latin literature, and in turn helped inspire Roger Bacon's best <b>work,</b> <b>Part</b> V of his Opus maius, [...] "On Perspectival Science," [...] as well as his supplementary treatise On the Multiplication of Vision. [...] Witelo's Perspectiva additionally made important contributions to psychology: [...] it held that vision per se apprehends only colors and light while all else, particularly the distance and size of objects, is established by means of association and unconscious deduction.|$|E
