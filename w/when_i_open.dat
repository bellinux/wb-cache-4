500|$|Tarantino {{attempted}} to cast both Kal Penn and Sylvester Stallone in Death Proof, but both {{were unable to}} work due to prior commitments. In an interview, Tarantino revealed {{that he decided to}} cast Kurt Russell as the killer stunt driver because [...] "for people of my generation, he's a true hero...but now, there's a whole audience out there that doesn't know what Kurt Russell can do. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>open</b> the newspaper and see an ad that says 'Kurt Russell in Dreamer,' or 'Kurt Russell in Miracle,' I'm not disparaging these movies, but I'm thinking: When is Kurt Russell going to be a badass again?" ...|$|E
500|$|... "Sing for Me" [...] {{is a power}} ballad, with a {{duration}} of four minutes (...) [...] Its instrumentation consists of [...] "soft" [...] strings, a [...] "delicate" [...] piano melody and [...] "80s power ballad-type drums" [...] at its close. The key in which the structure was composed is changed {{during the course of the}} song. Aguilera's vocals span from E♭3 to E♭5. Aguilera's vocal performance garnered a comparison to Gabby Douglas and the vocal gymnastics that she projects from Mike Wass for Idolator. He also noted that although Carey would consider the vocals runs as [...] "over-the-top", they fit with the nature of the song. The song features a [...] "thunderous" [...] ironic chorus which consists of the lyrics Cause <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>open</b> my mouth, my whole heart comes out." [...] According to Chris Younie for 4Music, Aguilera belts the song out [...] "as if her life depends on it." [...] The [...] "reflective ballad" [...] may be what was created as a result of Aguilera singing [...] "Beautiful" [...] alone in her bedroom after the weak commercial response of Bionic. It represents a [...] "fine line" [...] between the [...] "her hurt over the Bionic backlash and the woe-is-me territory she occasionally veers into on some of the album’s worst tracks." [...] Aguilera tries to [...] "shake her insecurities" [...] during the lines [...] "I don't care what the world thinks or how I sound." [...] According to Annie Zaleski for The A.V. Club, Aguilera [...] "discusses working through regret and reclaiming her sense of self." ...|$|E

60|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> {{my little}} valise, {{before going to}} bed, I saw the box the doctor's {{daughter}} had given me.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Trot, my dear,' she said, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> my eyes, 'I couldn't {{make up my}} mind {{to disturb}} you. Mr. Peggotty is here; shall he come up?' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> {{my bedroom}} door the next morning, the widow and Mr. Keller {{were on the}} landing outside, and those were the words {{exchanged}} between them.|$|R
2500|$|Tarantino {{attempted}} to cast John Travolta, Willem Dafoe, John Malkovich, Mickey Rourke, Ron Perlman, Bruce Willis, Kal Penn and Sylvester Stallone in Death Proof, but none {{were able to}} work due to prior commitments. In an interview, Tarantino revealed that he cast Kurt Russell as the killer stunt driver because [...] "for people of my generation, he's a true hero…but now, there's a whole audience out there that doesn't know what Kurt Russell can do. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>open</b> the newspaper and see an ad that says 'Kurt Russell in Dreamer,' or 'Kurt Russell in Miracle,' I'm not disparaging these movies, but I'm thinking: When is Kurt Russell {{going to be a}} badass again?” Eli Roth, Planet Terror leading actress Rose McGowan, and Tarantino himself appear in the film. Roth flew in from Europe, where he was filming , to film his scenes, which took one day.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you kindly, sir; please {{to let it}} be. I wake {{often in}} the night, and I {{like to see the}} heavens <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>open</b> my eyes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Easy," [...] commented Billy, relieved. [...] "Get {{ready to}} beat it <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>open</b> the door. I got a pony south o' town that'll {{have to carry}} double for a little way tonight." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{looked back}} {{over the past years}} of my existence, from the time of my {{earliest}} recollections to the miserable day <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> the sealed packet.|$|R
60|$|The {{sound of}} a {{clattering}} poker awakened me next morning and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> my sleepy eyes and looked out a new world displayed itself before me.|$|R
60|$|I {{had not yet}} sat down, and I {{went first}} to see who it was. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> the door Madame Fosco confronted me with my {{handkerchief}} in her hand.|$|R
6000|$|... "Tell by-'em-by. No hurry for dat. Want {{to sleep}} fuss. See so much better, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>open</b> eye. So you t'ink of makin' journey on long path. If can't go to Detroit, where can go to?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Opening. That is, barking on view or {{scent of}} the game; a hunting term. Cf. Shakespeare, M. W. iv. 2. 209: [...] "If I bark out thus upon no trail never trust me <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>open</b> again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{tell you}} it isn't always the man's fault," [...] said Dan darkly. [...] "When I get married I'll be good to my wife, but I mean to be boss. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>open</b> my mouth my word will be law." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> my {{eyes again}} I found myself lying upon {{a bed in}} a strange room. By my side was my father, leaning back in a low, easy chair.|$|R
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> awoke it was broad day once more. A gentleman sat on {{the edge}} of my bed. He had a queer, short face, ruddy as the harvest moon, and he smiled good-humouredly <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> my eyes.|$|R
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> my eyes <b>I</b> {{found myself}} {{on a bed}} in a darkened room. By my side was sitting a woman. I looked at her, and {{wondered}} who she was.|$|R
60|$|Whenever I {{leave the}} room to go to bed, I look back, and there is my brother sitting in the chair. And then I cannot sleep because of {{thinking}} of him sitting through all the long night-hours. And in the morning, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>open</b> the study door, there he is, and I know he has sat there the night long.|$|E
60|$|But {{one night}} I sleep, and, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>open</b> my eyes, {{he is no}} longer near me. I run swiftly up the narrow stairs and along the silent corridor. The {{tapestry}} is drawn aside, and the hidden door stands open, and in the room beyond the friend that I loved is kneeling before an open chest, and the glint of the gold is in my eyes.|$|E
60|$|MAN (coolly, but attentively). Never mind: {{this sort}} of thing is all in my day's work. I'm bound to take my chance. (Decisively.) Now do what I tell you. Put out the candles, so that they shan't see the light <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>open</b> the shutters. And keep away from the window, {{whatever}} you do. If they see me, they're sure to have a shot at me.|$|E
60|$|It {{was dark}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> my eyes again. Strange, stiff {{garments}} were upon my body; garments that cracked and powdered {{away from me}} as I rose to a sitting posture.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Jump! Didn't {{you make}} ME jump, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> my eyes a moment ago, and saw you sitting there, like {{the ghost of}} a girl miser, in the dead of the night.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{had an idea}} I {{should find}} her here <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> the door," [...] he answered. [...] "You were {{standing}} in the shadow. It seemed to be just what I had expected." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I try to {{struggle}} against it, but, coming after the strange complication of circumstances {{that has been}} closing round me for weeks past, {{there is something in}} this latest event of all that shakes my nerves. But one last chance of detection stood in my way when I opened my diary yesterday. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>open</b> it to-day, that chance is removed by Mr. Brock's death. It means something; I wish I knew what.|$|E
6000|$|... "I beg a {{thousand}} pardons, dear Sister: {{in these three}} long pages I talk to you of nothing but my troubles and affairs. A strange abuse it would be of any other person's friendship. But yours, my dear Sister, yours is known to me; and I am persuaded you are not impatient <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>open</b> my heart to you:--a heart which is yours altogether; being filled with sentiments of the tenderest esteem, with which I am, my dearest Sister, your [in truth, affectionate Brother at all times] F." [...] [OEuvres de Frederic, xxvii. i. 294, 295, 296-298.] ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are safe}} here," [...] the lady said. [...] "I have just dined with my charges, and my duties are {{over for the}} day. No one is likely to disturb us here. This is my private sitting-room. My bedroom is next door. If any one is heard coming, you must hide there. I will go in at once and change my dress for a dressing-gown, and I can then lock the door; so that if any one comes, there will be {{time for you to}} go in there, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>open</b> it, and say I am {{preparing}} for bed, it will account for the door being locked." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{first thing}} that <b>I</b> thought of, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> my eyes in the morning, {{was the fact that}} we would have to stay there all day, for we could not move on Sunday.|$|R
6000|$|Minna left us, {{with her}} {{pretty little head}} carried high in the air. [...] "Mrs. Wagner is a person entirely without sentiment!" [...] she indignantly whispered to me in passing, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> the door for her.|$|R
60|$|I {{could not}} have lain insensible for many minutes, for <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> my eyes and saw the surgeon and my second mate bending over me, it was still with the roar of cannon in my ears.|$|R
60|$|I {{wonder what}} became {{of the men who}} silently (you couldn't hear {{yourself}} speak) must have shared that conviction with me. To be left to write about it is not, perhaps, the most enviable fate; {{but the point is that}} this impression resumes in its intensity the whole recollection of days and days of desperately dangerous weather. We were then, for reasons which it is not worth while to specify, in the close neighbourhood of Kerguelen Land; and now, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>open</b> an atlas and look at the tiny dots on the map of the Southern Ocean, I see as if engraved upon the paper the enraged physiognomy of that gale.|$|E
60|$|Fire, we say, is combustion. It is {{marvelous}} how science proceeds like witchcraft and alchemy, {{by means}} of an abracadabra which has no earthly sense. Pray, what is combustion? You can try and answer scientifically, till you are black in the face. All you can say is that it is that which happens when matter is raised to a certain temperature--and so forth and so forth. You might as well say, a word is that which happens <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>open</b> my mouth and squeeze my larynx and make various tricks with my throat muscles. All these explanations are so senseless. They describe the apparatus, and think they have described the event.|$|E
6000|$|It {{belongs to}} all the books of the great Norwegian Bjorstjerne Bjornson, whose 'Arne,' and whose 'Happy Boy,' and whose 'Fisher Maiden' I read in this same {{fortunate}} sickness. I have since read every other book of his that I could lay hands on: 'Sinnove Solbakken,' and 'Magnhild,' and 'Captain Manzanca,' and 'Dust,' and 'In God's Ways,' and 'Sigurd,' and plays like [...] "The Glove" [...] and [...] "The Bankrupt." [...] He has never, as some authors have, dwindled in my sense; <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>open</b> his page, there I find him as large, and free, and bold as ever. He is a great talent, a clear conscience, a beautiful art. He has my love not only {{because he is a}} poet of the most exquisite verity, but because he is a lover of men, with a faith in them such as can move mountains of ignorance, and dulness, and greed. He is next to Tolstoy in his willingness to give himself for his kind; if he would rather give himself in fighting than in suffering wrong, I do not know that his self-sacrifice is less in degree.|$|E
60|$|I {{think it}} did good. Anyhow, after {{that he used to}} grin <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> the door, instead of {{greeting}} me as formerly with a face the picture of despair. But to return to our inexperienced friend.|$|R
6000|$|She was not mistaken, for <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> {{the door}} a {{neighbor}} said, [...] "I've brought you Mrs. Fletcher. Met her walking to Fairmead across the prairie. No; I guess I'm in a hurry, and won't get down." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I need hardly tell you,' said he, 'what were my {{feelings}} when your uncle {{came to me}} yesterday morning. And <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> your letter and read it, I could hardly believe that it had come from you.' ...|$|R
