25|$|For much of Albany's early years, {{from its}} colonial {{beginnings}} to well past independence, the South End {{was part of}} the city only politically, its only development being the rough road to the south that <b>went</b> <b>through</b> <b>it.</b> General Philip Schuyler's mid-18th century decision to build a mansion on his lands there was the first development of any kind. Later, after his death, the Erie Canal and its related industrial development brought so many immigrants to the area that the city had to expand its boundaries, making the South End an End in name only.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} {{season in}} 1996, the Indians again {{had the best}} record in baseball (9962) and Lofton's stolen base total (75) led the MLB {{for the second time in}} four years. He hit [...]317 and had a career-high 67 RBIs. The Indians lost in the 1996 ALDS to the Baltimore Orioles in four games. As an impending free agent, it was Lofton's last season with Cleveland before being traded to near the end of spring training 1997 to the Atlanta Braves of the National League. On trading Lofton, Hart said, [...] "We had to make this trade and based on the fact that Lofton could be a free agent at the end of this season. We <b>went</b> <b>through</b> <b>it</b> with Albert Belle last year, and Albert left and we had nothing in return. We were not prepared to do that again." [...] Lofton, described as [...] "an emotional and offensive catalyst" [...] with the Indians, appeared in three consecutive All-Star Games (19941996) and won four straight Gold Glove Awards (19931996) with the Indians. He led the AL in stolen bases for five straight seasons (19921996) and set the single-season Indians' franchise stolen base record (75).|$|E
500|$|When the 18th {{and last}} [...] "baron" [...] died without male heirs in 1746, the castle passed to his nephew, Sir Richard Musgrave, Bt, {{who took the}} name of Hylton. It was sold by a private bill (23 Geo. II c.21) in 1749. The new owner {{was to be a}} Mr. Wogan who {{returned}} from the East Indies to buy the castle for £30,550 (£3.7 million in 2007), but the sale never <b>went</b> <b>through.</b> <b>It</b> was instead bought by Lady Bowes, the widow of Sir George Bowes of Streatlam and Gibside in County Durham. No record of her, or any of her family, ever taking up residence exists and the castle later passed to her grandson, John Bowes, 10th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne. At this time, a stucco decoration (long since disappeared) to the wine and drawing rooms was added by Pietro La Francini, who worked for Daniel Garrett (who had worked for Lady Bowes on Gibside Banqueting House). William Howitt's Visits to Remarkable Places (1842) notes the rooms had [...] "stuccoed ceilings, with figures, busts on the walls, and one large scene which seemed to be Venus and Cupid, Apollo fiddling to the gods, Minerva in her helmet, and an old king". Garrett probably designed the Gothic porch installed in the west entrance and the Gothic screen and single-storey, bow-fronted rooms installed to close off the east entrance.|$|E

2500|$|Big Black's music {{challenged}} convention, pursuing an abrasive {{sound that}} was more aggressive than contemporary punk rock. Albini explained that the band strove for intensity, stating that their goal was to make [...] "something that felt intense when we <b>went</b> <b>through</b> <b>it,</b> rather than something that had little coded indicators of intensity. Heavy metal {{and stuff like that}} didn't really seem intense to me, it seemed comical to me. Hardcore punk didn't really seem intense most of the time — {{most of the time it}} just seemed childish. I guess that's how I would differentiate what we were doing from what other people were doing." [...] Both Albini and Riley described Big Black as a punk rock band. Other sources have classified the band as post-punk, indie rock, noise rock, alternative rock, and post-hardcore.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{her style}} of humor, which often relied on making jokes {{about her own}} life and satirizing the lives of celebrities and public figures, was {{sometimes}} criticized as insensitive. Her jokes about Elizabeth Taylor and Adele's weight, for instance, were often commented on, although Rivers would never apologize for her humor. Rivers, who was Jewish, was also criticized for making jokes about the Holocaust and later explained, [...] "This is the way I remind people about the Holocaust. I do it through humor", adding, [...] "my husband lost his entire family in the Holocaust." [...] Her joke about {{the victims of the}} Ariel Castro kidnappings similarly came under criticism, but she again refused to apologize, stating, [...] "I know what those girls <b>went</b> <b>through.</b> <b>It</b> was a little stupid joke." [...] She received multiple death threats throughout her career.|$|E

His friends {{and even those}} who had {{to carry out the}} sentence, were far more touched and overcome than was the vicar himself, who <b>went</b> <b>through</b> <b>it</b> with a calm fixed patience, with thorough cheerfulness and resignation. The Governor of Warwick Prison, who was no High Churchman, said of Fr. Enraght to one of his visitors: [...] "The sooner that gentleman is out, sir, the better, for he is altogether in the wrong place." [...] For nearly two months he was kept in Warwick Prison, and during that time a great meeting was held, when Birmingham Town Hall was filled from end to end, and so many came from far and near to protest against the imprisonment; the singing of the [...] "Church's one Foundation" [...] at the end was something impressive and touching.” ...|$|E
