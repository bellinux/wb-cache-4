At the war's onset it was known that many of the Sioux and Menominee <b>were</b> <b>eager</b> to join the conflict against the Sauk. Hamilton was sent to the Michigan Territory, north of Prairie du Chien, to recruit the assistance of indigenous allies. The result was successful and several parties of U.S. aligned Native Americans joined the war.|$|E

5|$|In August 1999, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone {{topped the}} New York Times list of best-selling fiction, and stayed {{near the top}} of the list for much of 1999 and 2000, until the New York Times split its list into children's and adult {{sections}} under pressure from other publishers who <b>were</b> <b>eager</b> to see their books given higher placings. Publishers Weeklys report in December 2001 on cumulative sales of children's fiction placed Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone 19th among hardbacks (over 5 million copies) and 7th among paperbacks (over 6.6million copies).|$|E
5|$|Nixon {{refused to}} answer further {{questions}} about the Fund, and attention turned to Stevenson's fund, especially as its details became clear.

Taking a leaf from Nixon's book, the Democrats {{refused to answer}} questions about the governor's fund. Both parties <b>were</b> <b>eager</b> to bury the matter, and the story died.|$|E

The fort's occupants <b>were</b> <b>eager</b> to hear their news from Galena and of the conflict with Black Hawk.|$|E
5|$|Seeing {{their leader}} fall, the Loyalists began to surrender. Some Patriots {{did not want}} to take prisoners, as they <b>were</b> <b>eager</b> to avenge the Battle of Waxhaws or 'Tarleton's Quarter,' in which Banastre Tarleton's forces killed a sizable number of Abraham Buford's Continental {{soldiers}} after the latter tried to surrender. (At Waxhaws, Tarleton's horse was shot, pinning him to the ground and leading his men to believe their commanding officer had been killed under a white flag of surrender.) Also, other Patriots were seemingly unaware that the Loyalists were trying to surrender.|$|E
5|$|The Meccans <b>were</b> <b>eager</b> {{to avenge}} their defeat. To {{maintain}} economic prosperity, the Meccans needed to restore their prestige, {{which had been}} reduced at Badr.

Abu Sufyan gathered an army of 3000 men and set out for an attack on Medina.|$|E

5|$|When the Columbian Baseball League was {{forming in}} 1912, The New York Times named Shay {{as one of}} two {{candidates}} to manage the league's Kansas City team. The {{president of the new}} league, John T.

The league never materialized. One of its main investors, brewer Otto Stifel, withdrew his support of the league before play began.|$|E
5|$|After the season, the Giants were {{involved}} in a fight for his services of Taylor with the New Jersey Generals of the United States Football League.

Taylor immediately regretted the decision. The Giants, who <b>were</b> <b>eager</b> to keep Taylor, took part in negotiating his way out of it. To free Taylor from the contract, the Giants had to pay Trump $750,000 over the next five seasons for Trump to release Taylor's rights, and give Taylor a new six-year, $6.2-million-dollar contract.|$|E

Three youths – Gavrilo Princip, Trifko Grabež, and Nedeljko Čabrinović – Bosnian Serb subjects of Austria-Hungary, living in Belgrade, testified at the Sarajevo trial that {{at about the same time}} (a little after Easter), they <b>were</b> <b>eager</b> to carry out an assassination and approached a fellow Bosnian Serb and former guerrilla fighter known to be well connected and with access to arms, Milan Ciganović, and through him Major Tankosić and reached an agreement to transport arms to Sarajevo and participate in the assassination.|$|E
5|$|In {{earliest}} recorded history, Norway {{was divided}} {{into a number of}} small and sometimes warring petty kingdoms with weak central authority. In traditional historiography the rise of Harald Fairhair in the 9th century started the process of unification of the country and the consolidation of royal power. Harald's descendants, and other claimants to the throne, had to contend with strong regional leaders such as the Jarls of Lade in the north and the rulers of Vingulmark in the east, while the kings of Denmark claimed regions in the south and <b>were</b> <b>eager</b> to acquire Norwegian vassals to increase their influence. The spread of Christianity also became an increasingly important political issue in the late 10th century.|$|E
5|$|Many factors {{contributed to}} the Song's {{repeated}} military blunders and subsequent loss of northern China to the Jurchens. Traditional accounts of Song history held the venality of Huizong's imperial court responsible for {{the decline of the}} dynasty. These narratives condemned Huizong and his officials for their moral failures. Early Song emperors <b>were</b> <b>eager</b> to enact political reforms and revive the ethical framework of Confucianism, but the enthusiasm for reforms gradually died after the reformist Wang Anshi's expulsion as chancellor in 1076. Corruption marred the reign of Huizong, who was more skilled as a painter than as a ruler. Huizong was known for his extravagance, and funded the costly construction of gardens and temples while rebellions threatened the state's grip on power.|$|E
