5|$|As the Union army retreated towards Washington, it {{paused to}} re-group at Centreville, Virginia. On August 31, 1862, Gen. Lee ordered Lt. Gen. Jackson to flank the Union right and {{to cut the}} Union army off from Washington. This {{flanking}} effort resulted in the Battle of Chantilly which {{would prove to be}} the most disastrous engagement of the entire <b>war</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> 21st Massachusetts.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} 1970s, {{professional}} historians began to reevaluate the force's history. A wider set of themes, including social, {{race and class}} issues, began to be analysed, resulting in more challenging histories of the force being published. Legal challenges brought before the Canadian courts in the 1980s resulted in the release of archive material about the force's role in the First World <b>War</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first time, generating further new lines of research.|$|E
5|$|In January 1566 Sultan Suleiman I {{had ruled}} the Ottoman Empire for 46 years {{and went to}} <b>war</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> last time. He was 72 years old and, {{although}} having gout {{to the extent that}} he was carried on a litter, he nominally commanded his thirteenth military campaign. On 1 May 1566 the Sultan left Constantinople at the head of one of the largest armies he had ever commanded.|$|E
5|$|Minas Geraes was modernized at the Rio de Janeiro Naval Yard in the 1930s, and {{underwent}} further refitting from 1939 to 1943. During the Second World War, {{the ship}} was anchored in Salvador as the main defense of the port, as it {{was too old to}} play an active part in the <b>war.</b> <b>For</b> <b>the</b> last nine years of its service life, Minas Geraes remained largely inactive, and was towed to Italy for scrapping in March 1954.|$|E

5|$|The 8th Military Police Brigade (Provisional) was {{constituted}} in South Korea in September 1984 {{in response}} to the need for cohesive command and control element in the event of <b>war,</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> numerous non-divisional Military Police units on the peninsula. At the time it consisted of the 94th Military Police Battalion in Yongsan (Seoul) and the 728th Military Police Battalion in Taegu (Camp Walker). However, the brigade would remain provisional and would not be officially activated for another ten years while it operated in this capacity.|$|E
5|$|The RPF forces held Ruhengeri {{through the}} {{afternoon}} of 23 January, before withdrawing back into the mountains for the night. The Rwandan government sent troops to the city the following day, and {{a state of emergency}} was declared, with strict curfews in Ruhengeri and the surrounding area. The RPF raided the city every night, fighting with the Rwandan army forces, and the country was back at <b>war</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first time since the October invasion.|$|E
5|$|The {{attack was}} a success with the brigades taking all their {{objectives}} on schedule. The 4th Brigade captured 700 prisoners of <b>war,</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> loss of 130 men killed, and over 600 wounded. In the 1st Brigade, 192 were killed along with 700 wounded. From its starting positions, the division made gains of around 1,000 metres. Both Godley and Russell were pleased with the outcome and pushed for further involvement by the New Zealand Division in the ongoing offensive.|$|E

5|$|The {{tower was}} closed in 1914 {{following}} {{the outbreak of}} the First World <b>War,</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> duration of which the steel structure was not maintained and consequently became rusty. During the war the government made unsuccessful attempts to buy the tower for its metal. Controversy still surrounds the decision to dismantle the tower after the war ended; some still believe the structure was safe and could have been repaired. Demolition began in 1919 and by 1921 only the ballroom remained. The metal was sold to scrap dealers.|$|E
5|$|A {{motif of}} father-against-son {{conflict}} was repeated when Cronus {{was confronted by}} his son, Zeus. Because Cronus had betrayed his father, he feared that his offspring would do the same, and so each time Rhea gave birth, he snatched up the child and ate it. Rhea hated this and tricked him by hiding Zeus and wrapping a stone in a baby's blanket, which Cronus ate. When Zeus was full grown, he fed Cronus a drugged drink which caused him to vomit, throwing up Rhea's other children and the stone, which {{had been sitting in}} Cronus's stomach all along. Zeus then challenged Cronus to <b>war</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> kingship of the gods. At last, {{with the help of the}} Cyclopes (whom Zeus freed from Tartarus), Zeus and his siblings were victorious, while Cronus and the Titans were hurled down to imprisonment in Tartarus.|$|E
5|$|A new {{fleet and}} army was raised and built under Ali's leadership, and on 31 October 1831, his son Ibrahim Pasha {{launched}} {{an invasion of}} Syria, which initiated the First Egyptian–Ottoman <b>War.</b> <b>For</b> <b>the</b> sake of international appearances, the pretext for the expedition was a quarrel with Abdullah Pasha of Acre. Ali alleged that 6,000 fellahin (peasants or agricultural laborer) had fled to Acre to escape the Egyptian draft, corvée, and taxes, and he demanded their return. Ibrahim Pasha advanced through Palestine, occupying Haifa in December 1831, and then using the city as his primary military base.|$|E

5|$|After her 1891 {{commission}}ing, Concord {{spent the}} next few years sailing along the East Coast, in the West Indies, and in the Gulf of Mexico. Concord cruised on the Asiatic Station—interrupted only by a short stint on the Alaskan sealing patrol—from 1893 until May 1896, when she began a year out of commission at San Francisco. In January 1898, Concord returned to the Asiatic Station, and joined Admiral George Dewey's fleet for 1 May 1898 Battle of Manila Bay, a decisive American victory over the Spanish Fleet in the Spanish–American War. After the battle, Concord supported United States Army operations in the Philippines in the Philippine–American <b>War.</b> <b>For</b> <b>the</b> rest of her active career, Concord patrolled off the Mexican and Alaskan coasts and served on the Yangtze Patrol. She was decommissioned in 1909 and served as a barracks ship until 1914, and as a quarantine ship at Astoria, Oregon for the Public Health Service until 1929, at which time she was returned to the Navy and sold.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Clarke had {{a varied}} {{military}} career {{that began with}} a posting to Mesopotamia in 1919. During the Iraqi revolt of 1920, he helped evacuate Europeans from the region by boat. While on extended leave in Turkey in 1922, he {{became involved in the}} Chanak Crisis, a threatened Turkish attack on British and French troops. Clarke volunteered to help the local British force and was tasked with feeding misinformation to Turkish nationalists– a first taste of the activities that would define his later military career. In 1925, during another period of leave, Clarke covered the Rif <b>War</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Morning Post.|$|E
5|$|After {{two weeks}} {{out of the}} line, the {{division}} attacked the Hindenburg Line itself on 29 September, easily achieving its objectives and capturing 1,000 prisoners. With the New Zealanders on the St. Quentin Canal and the adjacent Scheldt River, a platoon had managed to cross it and reach the village of Crèvecœur. However, it became pinned down until the 1st Auckland and 2nd Wellington Battalions of the 1st Brigade managed to cross {{the next day and}} capture the village. Private James Crichton, a member of the trapped platoon, earned the VC, the last of the <b>war</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> New Zealand Division, for his efforts in relaying messages between his companions and his company commander. He also defused demolition charges on the bridge spanning the Scheldt River.|$|E

The New Zealanders began withdrawing to the rear area at midnight on 5 November.

5|$|By {{the early}} morning of 13 March 1806 {{he was in the}} Mid-Atlantic when his lookouts spotted sails in the distance. Turning his force around to investigate, Linois hoped to {{encounter}} a merchant convoy but instead discovered the large British second rate HMS London looming out of the darkness ahead. Unable to escape, Linois fought until his ships were battered and he himself was badly wounded, but he eventually surrendered to the squadron under Admiral Warren that had followed London. Napoleon's fury at Linois was unabated and the French admiral remained a prisoner of <b>war</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> next eight years.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, Liverpool gained four battle honours and {{was seriously}} damaged in two attacks by Italian torpedo bombers. The cruiser {{operated}} variously with the naval {{stations in the}} East Indies and China and with the Mediterranean and Home fleets. While assigned to the China Station in January 1940, the cruiser instigated a diplomatic incident with Japan when she intercepted the liner Asama Maru {{off the coast of}} Japan. Liverpool fought in the battles of the Espero Convoy and Calabria, the Arctic Convoys, and Operation Harpoon during the Malta Convoys. An aerial attack on 14 June 1942, during Operation Harpoon, proved to be the ship's final combat of the <b>war.</b> <b>For</b> <b>the</b> remainder of the conflict, Liverpool underwent repairs and refitting at Rosyth, Scotland.|$|E
