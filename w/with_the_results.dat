5|$|Although Adams has {{experimented with}} {{painting}} with watercolor and oil paints (his 1989 covers for Appleseed were rendered {{with a combination}} of ink, watercolor and color pencil), his color work is so sporadic that he says he has to relearn what he has forgotten in the interim each time, and is usually dissatisfied <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>results.</b> Because a significant portion of his income is derived from selling his original artwork, he is reluctant to learn how to produce his work digitally.|$|E
5|$|I'd {{done a lot}} {{of videos}} and wasn't always a hundred percent thrilled.

Most of the scenes were featured at the amusement park, at a late-night outdoor celebration. I was really happy to be able to include O.D.B in the remix video.|$|E

5|$|Kneale's {{treatment}} for the film met {{with the approval of}} John Carpenter, the producer of the Halloween series, although Kneale was required to write the script in only six weeks. Kneale got on well with the director assigned to the film, Tommy Lee Wallace, but when one of the film's backers, Dino De Laurentiis, insisted upon the inclusion of more graphic violence and a rewrite of the script from Wallace, Kneale became displeased <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> and had his name removed from the film.|$|E

5|$|Nilo Rodis, who {{had worked}} on two {{previous}} Star Trek features, was appointed the role of art director, and worked with Shatner to establish the film's visual design. Shatner sought a grittier and more realistic feel to the Star Trek universe, and so the two worked together to visualize the film from start to finish. After Shatner explained the entire story in a day-long session, Rodis went home and sketched out each scene from the script. Shatner was pleased <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>results,</b> especially with Rodis' designs for Shatner's most expansive or dramatic shots.|$|E
5|$|Set in the 24th century, {{the series}} follows {{the adventures of}} {{the crew of the}} Starfleet {{starship}} Enterprise-D. In this episode, the crew respond to a distress call from Dr. Paul Manheim (Rod Loomis).

5|$|The film remains {{immensely popular}} with audiences into the 21st century, having been voted {{the most popular}} film in two {{nationwide}} polls of Americans undertaken by Harris Interactive in 2008, and again in 2014.

5|$|The {{first major}} change under Tkach's tenure was the WCG's {{doctrine}} on healing. Previously the church taught that true believers were healed by faith in God {{and not by}} doctors. Tkach asked the church leadership to study the question. Once Tkach was satisfied <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> of the study, he officially softened the church's teaching on the matter, encouraging members to seek proper treatment while retaining faith in God as a healer.|$|E
5|$|The {{tightening}} {{of laws and}} increased enforcement by police {{on behalf of the}} British Phonographic Industry (BPI), Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and other industry groups—often for peripheral issues such as tax evasion—gradually drove the distributors of for-profit vinyl and CD bootlegs further underground. Physical bootlegging largely shifted to countries with laxer copyright laws <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> distributed through existing underground channels, open market sites such as eBay, and other specialised websites, though {{by the end of the}} decade, eBay had clamped down on bootlegs.|$|E

Up next they faced old neighbours Meath {{for the second time in}} a row which turned out to be a disappointing performance from Dublin <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> ending Meath 5-09 to 0-13 to end The Dubs 5th Leinster title in a row. Dublin defeated Tipperary in their first game in <b>the</b> qualifiers <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> 1-21 to 1-13 with goal by one of the newcomers Michael Darragh Macauley however there was still improvement to be made. Dublin defeated Armagh in their next game <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> 0-14 to 0-11. Dublin improved greatly against Leinster-finalists Louth with Eoghan O'Gara scoring two goals to send them back to the quarter final. Dublin played Ulster Champions Tyrone and defeated them for the first time since 1995 by <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of 1-15 to 0-13. Dublin played Cork in their first Semi Final since 2007 but were narrowly defeated by one point 1-15 to 1-14.|$|R

5|$|Tim Webber of VFX house Framestore CFC was {{responsible}} for the three-and-a-half minute single take of Kee giving birth, helping to choreograph and create the CG effects of the childbirth. Cuarón had originally intended to use an animatronic baby as Kee's child {{with the exception of the}} childbirth scene. In the end, two takes were shot, with the second take concealing Clare-Hope Ashitey's legs, replacing them with prosthetic legs. Cuarón was pleased <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> of the effect, and returned to previous shots of the baby in animatronic form, replacing them with Framestore's computer-generated baby.|$|E
5|$|After {{allegations}} that the design contractor had inflated costs for the tunnel {{in order to avoid}} sharing the job with an outside tunneling contractor, the long tunnel concept was revived in April 2006. The allegations led to calls for an outside cost estimate to determine more realistic tunnel costs. On May 15, 2006, Virginia Transportation Secretary Pierce R. Homer announced the creation of an advisory panel headed by the American Society of Civil Engineers. The panel had about two months to evaluate options for completing the line through Tysons Corner, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> presented to the state on July 27, 2006 and published on July 31, 2006.|$|E
5|$|As well as Thunderhawks, Anderson {{developed}} {{other ideas}} for a remake. A 1976 concept, Inter-Galactic Rescue 4, {{was to have}} featured a variable-configuration craft capable of performing rescues on land and sea, in air and in space; Anderson pitched the idea to NBC, who rejected it. This was followed in 1984 by another proposed updating, T-Force, which at first could not be pursued owing {{to a lack of}} funding. Development resumed in 1993, when it was decided to produce the series, now titled GFI, using cel animation. But Anderson was disappointed <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> and the production was abandoned.|$|E

5|$|Because of the {{conflicting}} {{conclusions of the}} first two, a third post-mortem was conducted on 22 April by Kenneth Shorrock {{on behalf of the}} Metropolitan police, and Ben Swift on behalf of Simon Harwood. Shorrock and Swift agreed <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> of the second autopsy. The Met's point of contact for Tomlinson's death, Detective Inspector Eddie Hall, told the pathologists before the final post-mortem that Tomlinson had fallen to {{the ground in front of}} a police van earlier in the evening, although there was no evidence that this had happened. The IPCC ruled in May 2011 that Hall had been reckless in making this claim, but had not intended to mislead.|$|E

Springfield, Minnesota dropped out on May 31, 2007. The winner was announced on July 10 to be Springfield, Vermont. The town beat Springfield, Illinois by 15,367 votes to 14,634. Each of the other 14 entrants held their own smaller screenings of the film on July 26. Springfield, Vermont hosted the world premiere of the film on July 21 with a yellow carpet instead of the traditional red.|$|E
5|$|In {{the later}} part of Richard's reign, the {{pressures}} mounted on Walter. Conflicts between his ecclesiastical duties {{and his government}} duties made him the target of criticism from both sides. A dispute in December 1197, over Richard's demand that the magnates of England provide 300knights to serve in France, led to renewed grumbling among the clergy and barons. Richard was also dissatisfied <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> of the carucage in 1198, so Walter resigned his position of chief justiciar on 11 July of that year. Walter may have resigned willingly, as he had talked of resigning his secular duties since 1194. Some medieval sources, however, stated that he was forced out of office by the king.|$|E
