40|$|The {{notion of}} cyber-journal embraces all the {{different}} forms of e-publishing in cyber-space (the virtual and non geographical world generated by the Internet) {{to the extent that}} they provide news reporting, such as e-versions of newspapers, news bulletins and TV news; news (section of) mail-lists, search-engines and portals; <b>web-zines,</b> personal news web sites, etc. This wide notion appeals both to technical and legal reasons. Technically, news-reporting (considered as the whole of its publishing and journalistic profession terms) consists of the process of selection, organisation and diffusion of facts considered to be relevant to the social community, regardless of the practical form this process implies. Legally, as a consequence of its social function in modern democracies, news-reporting is the most important expression of the principle of Freedom of information. We can say that Freedom of information becomes news-reporting when the information provided acquires, for its content and form, a public dimension. Though news-reporting is subject to the same general protection of Freedom of information, it may give rise to more particular problems, mostly for its economic implications, which will be considered in the next paragraphs. The right of Freedom of information is recognised to every individual by international law, particularly in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights adopted in 1948 by the General Assembly of the United Nations (ONU), the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the European Convention of Human Rights. All these international acts proclaim the ability of everyone to exercise Freedom of information “regardless of frontiers”. The latter principle is the main point of our discussion. Cyber-journal corresponds exactly to that: news-reporting provided by any individual at its pure no-frontiers dimension. This is a real phenomenon: it is a matter of fact - an increasing number of news-sites managed by individuals are accessible from everywhere, through the Internet. A proper legal regime of cyber-journal, or on-line news-reporting, has to adapt law to this new reality of Freedom of information not to repress i...|$|R
