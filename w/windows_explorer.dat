25|$|Since it is tightly {{integrated}} with the operating system, Internet Explorer makes full use of the accessibility framework provided in Windows. Internet Explorer is also a user interface for FTP, with operations {{similar to that of}} <b>Windows</b> <b>Explorer.</b> However, with version 7, FTP sites are rendered in a hyper linked page, with the folder-like view available if the site is accessed from <b>Windows</b> <b>Explorer.</b> IE7 can itself launch <b>Windows</b> <b>Explorer</b> for FTP sites.|$|E
25|$|CHKDSK can be {{run from}} DOS prompt, <b>Windows</b> <b>Explorer,</b> Windows Command Prompt, Windows PowerShell or Recovery Console.|$|E
25|$|On desktop machines, <b>Windows</b> <b>Explorer</b> is {{the default}} user interface, though {{a variety of}} {{additional}} Windows shell replacements exist.|$|E

25|$|Unlike FreeOTFE, FreeOTFE Explorer {{does not}} provide {{on-the-fly}} encryption through a virtual drive. Instead it lets files be stored and extracted from encrypted disk images, {{in a similar manner}} as ZIP and RAR archives, by using a <b>Windows</b> <b>Explorer</b> like interface.|$|E

50|$|On Microsoft Windows {{operating}} systems, {{starting with}} the IE4 Desktop Update for Win95/98, a thumbnail cache is used to store thumbnail images for <b>Windows</b> <b>Explorer's</b> thumbnail view. This speeds up the display of images as these smaller images {{do not need to}} be recalculated every time the user views the folder.|$|R

25|$|AutoRun, {{a feature}} of <b>Windows</b> <b>Explorer</b> (actually of the shell32 dll) {{introduced}} in Windows 95, enables media and devices to launch programs by use of command listed in a file called autorun.inf, stored in the root directory of the medium.|$|E
25|$|<b>Windows</b> <b>Explorer</b> in Windows 95 was set as {{a spatial}} file manager model by default; because it also {{worked as a}} navigational file manager, {{directories}} could be opened in multiple windows, which made it fail all the above criteria. Later versions gradually abandoned the spatial model.|$|E
25|$|The AutoRun {{sequence}} {{starts with}} the initial discovery of a new device or new piece of media. Following this, notification of interested parties occurs, of which the <b>Windows</b> <b>Explorer</b> shell is of primary interest. After checking certain Registry settings to see if AutoRun can proceed, parsing of an optional autorun.inf may occur and any necessary actions are taken.|$|E

50|$|The {{first version}} of TreeSize was {{programmed}} by Joachim Marder in 1996. It was designed to offer the features of Unix's du on Windows systems, {{with the addition of}} a GUI. The software tried to overcome the drawbacks of both the du command and <b>Windows</b> <b>Explorer's</b> right-click context menu. One year later, the newly founded German company JAM Software published TreeSize in a freeware and two shareware versions. Version 6 was released in September 2013.|$|R
25|$|The Fax {{service and}} model are fully account-based. Fax-aware {{applications}} such as Windows Fax and Scan can send multiple documents in a single fax submission. The Fax Service API generates TIFF files for each document and merges them into a single TIFF file. Users can right-click a document in <b>Windows</b> <b>Explorer</b> and select Send to Fax Recipient.|$|E
25|$|<b>Windows</b> <b>Explorer</b> also {{contains}} modifications in the visualization of files on a computer. A new addition to <b>Windows</b> <b>Explorer</b> is the Details pane, which displays metadata and {{information relating to}} the currently selected file or folder. Windows Vista introduces a newer IThumbnailProvider interface that shows thumbnails in the Details pane {{as well as in}} large icon views. Furthermore, different imagery is overlaid on thumbnails to give more information about the file, such as a picture frame around the thumbnail of an image file, or a filmstrip on a video file. Thumbnails can be zoomed on. The preview panel allows you to see thumbnails of all sorts of files and view the contents of documents, similar to the way you can preview email messages in Outlook, without opening the files. There's a new intelligent algorithm for creation of Video thumbnails, which chooses a random frame inside the video and ensures the thumbnail is not black (XP showed the first frame, it was usually black).|$|E
25|$|Internet Explorer {{makes use}} of the {{accessibility}} framework provided in Windows. Internet Explorer is also a user interface for FTP, with operations {{similar to that of}} <b>Windows</b> <b>Explorer.</b> Pop-up blocking and tabbed browsing were added respectively in Internet Explorer 6 and Internet Explorer 7. Tabbed browsing can also be added to older versions by installing MSN Search Toolbar or Yahoo Toolbar.|$|E

25|$|The Version tab that {{appeared}} for binary files with version information in Windows XP and the Summary tab {{that appeared}} for all files on NTFS volumes have been combined {{into a single}} Details tab. If a Property handler is installed, the Details property sheet allows editing file metadata similar to the Details pane. <b>Windows</b> <b>Explorer</b> has built-in ability to remove any extra metadata associated with the file (Remove Properties and Personal Information).|$|E
25|$|On 25 June 1998, Microsoft {{released}} Windows 98. It included new hardware {{drivers and}} better {{support for the}} FAT32 file system which allows support for disk partitions larger than the 2 GB maximum accepted by Windows 95. The USB support in Windows 98 was more robust than the basic support provided by the OEM editions of Windows 95. It also controversially integrated the Internet Explorer browser into the Windows GUI and <b>Windows</b> <b>Explorer</b> file manager.|$|E
25|$|In Windows utilities, {{the space}} and the period are not allowed as the final {{character}} of a filename. The period is allowed as the first character, but some Windows applications, such as <b>Windows</b> <b>Explorer,</b> forbid creating or renaming such files (despite this convention being used in Unix-like systems to describe hidden files and directories). Workarounds include appending a dot when renaming the file (that is then automatically removed afterwards), using alternative file managers, or saving a file with the desired filename from within an application.|$|E
50|$|AscentialTest {{provides}} {{automated testing}} {{support for the}} following application types including MS <b>Windows,</b> Internet <b>Explorer,</b> Firefox, Chrome, Java, dotNet (Winforms and WPF), terminals, Siebel and PowerBuilder.|$|R
25|$|With this version, Internet Explorer {{was renamed}} from Microsoft Internet <b>Explorer</b> to <b>Windows</b> Internet <b>Explorer</b> {{as part of}} Microsoft's {{rebranding}} of components that are included with Windows.|$|R
50|$|MIX 08 {{was held}} from March 5-March 7, 2008. The first beta release of Microsoft's <b>Windows</b> Internet <b>Explorer</b> 8 was {{demonstrated}} and contained many new features, including WebSlices and Activities.|$|R
25|$|The Windows Desktop Search {{functionality}} {{is exposed}} via a Windows Taskbar mounted deskbar. It provides a text field to type the query {{and the results}} are presented in a flyout pane. It also integrates as a <b>Windows</b> <b>Explorer</b> window. On selecting a file in the Explorer window, a preview of the file is shown in the right hand side of the window, without opening the application which created the file. Web searches can be initiated from both interfaces, but that will open the browser to search the terms using the default search engine.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{capabilities}} {{and programs that}} {{were a part of}} Windows Vista are no longer present or have been changed, resulting in the removal of certain functionalities; these include the classic Start Menu user interface, some taskbar features, <b>Windows</b> <b>Explorer</b> features, Windows Media Player features, Windows Ultimate Extras, Search button, and InkBall. Four applications bundled with Windows Vista — Windows Photo Gallery, Windows Movie Maker, Windows Calendar and Windows Mail — are not included with Windows 7 and were replaced by Windows Live-branded versions as part of the Windows Live Essentials suite.|$|E
25|$|There {{is also a}} Search Explorer, {{which is}} an {{integrated}} <b>Windows</b> <b>Explorer</b> window that is used for searches. It presents the user interface to specify the search parameters, including locations and file types that should be searched, and certain operators, without crafting the AQS queries by hand. With Windows Vista SP1, third party applications {{will be able to}} override the Search Explorer as the default search interface so that the registered third party application will be launched, instead of bringing up the Search Explorer, when invoked by any means.|$|E
2500|$|... 7-Zip {{comes with}} a file manager along with the {{standard}} archiver tools. The file manager has a toolbar with options to create an archive, extract an archive, test an archive to detect errors, copy, move, and delete files, and open a file properties menu exclusive to 7-Zip. The file manager, by default, displays hidden files {{because it does not}} follow <b>Windows</b> <b>Explorer's</b> policies. The tabs show name, modification time, original and compressed sizes, attributes, and comments (all comments for a directory's files are stored in a text file on that directory called descript.ion, which can be edited offline).|$|R
