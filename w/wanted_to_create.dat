5|$|Oxenfree is {{developer}} Night School Studio's first game. Influenced by classic teen {{movies and}} coming-of-age shows, the developers <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> a story-driven game without cutscenes and allowing players to freely roam the environment. The game's audiovisual presentation marries dark, organic, and analog elements with sharp, distorted, and digital ones. Oxenfree received generally positive reviews on release, with critics praising the presentation and characters, although some reviewers were left wanting more.|$|E
5|$|Peter Molyneux {{stated that}} {{he came up with}} the idea of {{creating}} Theme Park because he felt the business genre was worth pursuing. He said that Theme Park is a game he had always <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>create,</b> and wanted to avoid the mistakes of his earlier business simulation game, The Entrepreneur: he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> a business simulation game and make it fun so people would want to play it. In an interview, he explained that the primary reason he created Theme Park was because he wanted players to create their dream Theme Park. Another reason is he wanted players to understand the kind of work running one entails. The three difficulty settings enable players to choose the desired depth: simply having fun creating a theme park, or making all the business decisions too. Molyneux stated that the most difficult part to program was the visitors' behaviour.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} Defender {{prompted}} Williams to approach Vid Kidz, who originally <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> a new game. DeMar, however, suggested creating an enhanced version of Defender to meet Williams' four-month deadline. Vid Kidz titled the game Stargate, and developed it as {{a sequel to}} Defender. It features new elements and improved the original's performance. Some home ports of Stargate were released under the title Defender II for trademark purposes.|$|E
5000|$|McIlrath {{stated in}} an {{interview}} with The Shrine Auditorium that [...] "In many ways, a Rise Against show is a safe space for our fans. But I realized that I don't only <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> safe spaces, I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> dangerous spaces where misogyny can't exist, where xenophobia can't exist. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> spaces where those sentiments don't have any air, and they suffocate: where those ideas die. Wolves isn't about creating a safe space, it's about creating a space that's dangerous for injustice." ...|$|R

5|$|Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors was {{developed}} by Chunsoft and directed by Kotaro Uchikoshi. Chunsoft had made successful visual novels in the past, but <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> {{a new type of}} visual novel that could be received by a wider audience; they contacted Uchikoshi and asked him to write visual novels for them. He {{came up with the idea}} to include puzzles that are integrated within the story, and need to be solved in order for the player to make progress.|$|E
5|$|The Hall of Fame {{was created}} to honor the role St. Louis played in helping to {{establish}} professional wrestling in North America. Matysik also <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> a hall of fame that recognized wrestlers for their contributions to wrestling rather than their relationships with {{the owner of the}} promotion. To be inducted into the Hall of Fame, inductees must have held a title belt or {{played an important role in}} or around the Missouri area between 1959 and 1983, when the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) had a strong presence in St. Louis.|$|E
5|$|The Idolmaster series {{producer}} Yōzō Sakagami {{attributed the}} development of a rhythm game in the series to two reasons. Noting that songs have a strong meaning to the franchise, he had wanted to make the songs that were included in the series' albums but not in its video games to be accessible in that form. He also <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> an Idolmaster video game that, while maintaining a producer's viewpoint, has a lighter feel and would allow the player to hum along to the idols as he or she plays. He pointed out that the rhythm game genre fell in line with these two desires, and this led to {{the development of}} Shiny Festa. The team chose to develop for the PlayStation Portable (PSP) as he felt it was simple to play on. At the same time, the team also <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> scenes where the series' thirteen idols would be able to appear together, and chose to use pre-rendered videos to make this possible. Sakagami also noted that the development team deliberately chose to use a gameplay system in which the note icons float toward the screen's center to attract the player to look at the videos in the background.|$|E

5|$|The {{episode was}} written by John Swartzwelder and {{directed}} by Jeffrey Lynch; Barry White, who had expressed a wish {{to appear in the}} show, guest stars as himself. It was pitched by George Meyer, who <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> an episode against the mistreatment of snakes (the episode ended up winning a Genesis Award). The episode includes the first appearance of Superintendent Chalmers, and it features an Itchy & Scratchy parody of Oliver Stone's film JFK.|$|E
5|$|The series' concept {{originated}} in 1999 when Taniguchi {{was working on}} Infinite Ryvius. He <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> another series that would contain themes similar to it, {{as well as new}} ones centered mostly on how people adapted to the 21st century. A manga adaptation of s-CRY-ed, drawn by Yasunari Toda, was serialized in Akita Shoten's Weekly Shōnen Champion. A novelization by Kazuho Hyodo has been published. Additionally, a two-part recollection film was released by Sunrise. Both the anime and the manga have also seen English release.|$|E
5|$|Development began {{shortly after}} the release of Christmas Nights in November 1996. Producer Yuji Naka <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> a game which {{involved}} saving people rather than killing them. Sonic Team chose to connect the game with firefighting as they thought it was an effective way of having players identify with heroism. Burning Rangers received mostly positive reviews. Critics unanimously commended the game's soundtrack and audio, with the voice navigation system receiving particular praise. The response to the graphics was mixed, with some critics asserting that it had the best visuals on the Saturn, although it was noted for its poor collision detection and occasional glitching. The game was among the final five Saturn titles released in America.|$|E

5|$|Dragon Quest {{was created}} by Yuji Horii, who took {{inspiration}} from previous role-playing games such as Wizardry, Ultima, and his own 1983 title The Portopia Serial Murder Case. Horii <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> an RPG which would appeal to a wide audience {{of people who were}} unfamiliar with the genre of video games in general. He tried to place a greater emphasis on storytelling and emotional involvement, as well as simplify the interface and expose the mostly Western computer genre to the Japanese console market. Manga artist and Dragon Ball creator Akira Toriyama produced the game's artwork and Koichi Sugiyama composed its music. The North American version featured numerous changes, including battery-backed RAM save games (rather than using a password save system), modified character sprites and pseudo-Elizabethan English style dialog.|$|E
5|$|Iftah Ya Simsim was {{the first}} children's {{educational}} TV program {{of its kind in}} the Arab world and the first Sesame Street co-production in the region. It {{was the first}} co-production to use Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). Its development was similar to that of the American version of Sesame Street in the late 1960s. The GCC considered creating a co-production for many years, so consultations were held among its member countries regarding how to do so. Many of the early co-productions were simple, dubbed versions with local language voice-overs and instructional cutaways, but the GCC <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> their own original version.|$|E
5|$|In {{this volume}} Kierkegaard {{examines}} {{the concept of}} 'First Love' as a pinnacle for the aestheticist, using his idiosyncratic concepts of 'closedness' (indesluttethed in Danish) and the 'demonic' (demoniske) with reference to Eugène Scribe. Scribe <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> a template for all playwrights to follow. He insisted that people go to plays to escape from reality and not for instruction. Kierkegaard is against any template {{in the field of}} literature or of Christianity. He was against systematizing anything in literature because the system brings the artist to a stop and he or she just settles down in the system.|$|E

5|$|Muhammad Ilyas, {{the founder}} of Tablighi Jamaat, <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> a {{movement}} that would enjoin good and forbid evil as the Qur'an decreed, as his teacher Rasheed Ahmad Gangohi dreamed of doing. The inspiration for this came during his second pilgrimage to Mecca in 1926. What he lacked in scholarly learning, presence, charisma or speaking ability, he made up for in zeal. He initially tried to establish a network of mosque-based religious schools to educate the Mewati Muslims about Islamic beliefs and practices. Shortly afterwards, he was disappointed with the reality that these institutions were producing religious functionaries, but not preachers.|$|E
5|$|Musically, I'm Breathless {{consists}} predominantly of jazz, {{swing and}} pop songs. The tracks reflected Madonna's showgirl personality and {{were influenced by}} her relationship with Beatty. The singer <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> music that would fit the style and production of the film, set {{in the days of}} the Untouchables law enforcement, and sang the songs accordingly. In some areas she pitched her vocals and belted the notes when necessary. She even smoked cigarettes in order to portray the vocals of her character Breathless. Beatty and singer Mandy Patinkin were featured as duet partners on three of the songs.|$|E
5|$|Pathways was Bungie's fourth title (and third {{commercial}} title) {{after their}} previous game, Minotaur: The Labyrinths of Crete, sold around 2,500 copies. In {{the summer of}} 1992, Jones was living in dorms at the University of Chicago when he saw Wolfenstein 3D, a shooter game with three-dimensional (3D) graphics. Inspired, Jones created a rough 3D-graphics engine for the Mac that simulated walls with trapezoids and rectangles. Originally, Bungie intended Pathways to be a straightforward 3D version of Minotaur, but they quickly found that the top-down perspective of their previous game did not mesh with the 3D presentation. An additional consideration was that the developers <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> a game that did not rely on then-rare networks and modems, an issue in marketing Minotaur. The rest of 1992 was spent tweaking the graphics engine.|$|E

5|$|The Eriksson {{brothers}} and Johansson {{did not work}} {{much more on the}} game until 1984, when the journalist Erik Fichtelius conducted an interview about the game for the Swedish airline Linjeflyg's magazine Upp, which was distributed to all their airplanes in 1985. In the article, Fichtelius asked Johansson why they had not made the game commercially available for home computers; Johansson said that it had been considered but that they had only developed the game because it was a fun challenge for them, and {{that they would have to}} find a distributor of computer programs if they <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> a PC version.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} by Cascade Games founded in 1983 by Guy Wilhelmy and Nigel Stevens. Wilhelmy had a pilot's license and had experience with aircraft control and responsiveness, while Stevens' father had been in British Royal Air Force. Wilhelmy explained that he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> a fast-paced flying game with responsive graphics that other games of the time struggled with. Cascade hired programmer Ian Martin and graphics designer Damon Redmond {{to work on the}} project in 1985. The first version known as A.C.E.: Air Combat Emulator was released in 1985 for the Commodore 16 and VIC-20 home computers. Martin describes that an advertisement erroneously promising a Plus/4 version forced them to develop it under threat of action by Advertising Standards Agency.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{originally}} directed by Tetsuya Nomura, who also created the story concept and main character designs. Nomura <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> a darker Final Fantasy title unsuitable {{for the main}} series. The initial development went slowly, and by 2007 {{the scale of the}} project generated discussions about rebranding the game as the next main entry in the series. Production on Versus XIII ended in 2012, when it was rebranded as Final Fantasy XV and transferred over to the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The PlayStation 3 version, which was originally built using the company's proprietary Crystal Tools game engine, was abandoned due to concerns about the platform's shortening life cycle. Its engine was changed to Luminous Studio, Square Enix's custom-built engine for eighth-generation gaming hardware.|$|E
