[...] "The film gets mired in the {{inevitable}} red tape of police investigations," [...] wrote Bob Longino of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, who also felt that the film [...] "stumbles to a rather unfulfilling conclusion" [...] and [...] "seems to {{last as long as}} the Oscars." [...] Andrew Sarris of The New York Observer felt that [...] "Mr. Fincher's flair for casting is the major asset of his curiously attenuated return to the serial-killer genre. I keep saying 'curiously' with regard to Mr. Fincher, because I can't really figure out what he is up to in Zodiac – with its two-hour-and-37-minute running time for <b>what</b> <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> as a shaggy-dog narrative." [...] Christy Lemire wrote in the San Francisco Chronicle that [...] "Jake Gyllenhaal is both the central figure and the weakest link... But he's never fleshed out sufficiently to make you believe that he'd sacrifice his safety and that of his family to find the truth. We are told repeatedly that the former Eagle Scout is just a genuinely good guy, but that's not enough." ...|$|E

Stone cast Hopkins based on his performances in The Remains of the Day and Shadowlands. Of Hopkins, Stone said, [...] "The isolation of Tony is <b>what</b> <b>struck</b> <b>me.</b> The loneliness.

2500|$|At 4.20pm on Sunday 23 May 2010 an {{off-road}} motorcyclist spotted what {{he initially}} described as [...] "a sort of charred tailor's dummy" [...] in woodland at Monkey Hill, near Branchalfield Drive, Cambusnethan, Wishaw. As he approached he realised {{that it was}} actually a corpse. In his subsequent testimony he explained: [...] "At first I thought it was a mannequin and <b>what</b> <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> was the leg, possibly the left leg. I could see bone there. Tailor's dummies don't have bones." [...] The body was extensively charred, and he was unable to tell if it was that of a male or female. [...] He immediately went to his nearby home and telephoned the police to report the discovery. When the police arrived he led them to the scene, which Detective Sergeant (DS) Clifford Neil of Strathclyde Police described as [...] "gruesome." [...] The body lay on a makeshift pyre and had heavy duty plastic sheet partly melted on to the facial area. Strathclyde Police launched a murder inquiry, led by Detective Superintendent (D/Supt) Derek Robertson of the force's Major Investigation Unit, on 24 May following the results of a post-mortem examination.|$|E

However, as the trunk was {{slightly}} supported on the left arm, it would have been rather difficult to try and get at the heart without doing too much noticeable damage. As the Mother Superior had expressed a desire for the Saint's heart to be kept together with the whole body, and as Monsignor the Bishop did not insist, I gave up the idea of opening the left-hand side of the thorax and contented myself with removing the two right ribs which were more accessible. ... <b>What</b> <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> during this examination, of course, was the state of perfect preservation of the skeleton, the fibrous tissues of the muscles (still supple and firm), of the ligaments, and of the skin, and above all the totally unexpected state of the liver after 46 years. One would have thought that this organ, which is basically soft and inclined to crumble, would have decomposed very rapidly or would have hardened to a chalky consistency. Yet, when it was cut it was soft and almost normal in consistency. I pointed this out to those present, remarking that this did not seem to be a natural phenomenon.".|$|E

Ever since this unexpected encounter, SS Obersturmführer Gemmeker’s gaze has been perplexing me and, to use a worn metaphor, haunting me – and so has Frau Hassler’s response to his apparent seduction. Was I being a witness to a secret love affair in a concentration camp? Surely, such stories are not unheard of and I {{find it difficult to}} articulate <b>what</b> actually <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> at the moment of realisation. The ordinariness of their gestures, or, as I later found out, the performance of {{what appears to be a}} generic and banal film script within an utterly abnormal setting? The almost tangible realness of the SS officer’s and his secretary’s feelings, whilst at the same time the lovers seem nothing but mere puppets of history...|$|R

60|$|I {{discovered}} another curious {{thing about}} Kookooskoos {{that night when}} I watched to find out <b>what</b> had <b>struck</b> <b>me.</b> I found out why he hoots. Sometimes, {{if he is a}} young owl, he hoots for practice, or to learn how; and then he makes an awful noise of it, a rasping screech, before his voice deepens. And if you are camping near and are new to the woods, the chances are that you lie awake and shiver; for there is no other sound like it in the wilderness. Sometimes, when you climb to his nest, he has a terrifying hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo, running up and down a deep guttural scale, like a fiendish laugh, accompanied by a vicious snapping of the beak. And if you are a small boy, and it is towards twilight, you climb down the tree quick and let his nest alone. But the regular whooo-hoo-hoo, whooo-hoo, always five notes, with the second two very short, is a hunting call, and he uses it to alarm the game. That is queer hunting; but his ears account for it.|$|R
