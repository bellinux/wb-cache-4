5|$|In early cricket, {{there were}} two umpires as now, but the modern square-leg umpire stood close to the striker's wicket. Both umpires carried a bat which the running batsman was {{required}} to touch in order to complete his run. There were two scorers <b>who</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> the field and recorded the scores by making notches on tallysticks; runs were then known as notches for this reason.|$|E
5|$|Sherman {{was born}} in 1820 in Lancaster, Ohio, near {{the banks of the}} Hocking River. His father, Charles Robert Sherman, a {{successful}} lawyer <b>who</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> the Ohio Supreme Court, died unexpectedly in 1829. He left his widow, Mary Hoyt Sherman, with eleven children and no inheritance. After his father's death, the nine-year-old Sherman was raised by a Lancaster neighbor and family friend, attorney Thomas Ewing, Sr., a prominent member of the Whig Party who served as senator from Ohio and as the first Secretary of the Interior. Sherman was distantly related to American founding father Roger Sherman and grew to admire him.|$|E
5|$|By {{the age of}} 14, Morrissey {{was one of two}} youth theatre members <b>who</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> {{the board}} of the Everyman Theatre. Ian Hart, with whom he had been friends since the age of five, was one of his contemporaries, as were Mark and Stephen McGann and Cathy Tyson. Morrissey became friends with the McGann brothers, who {{introduced}} him to their brother Paul when Paul was on a break from studies at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA). When Morrissey was 15 years old, his father developed a terminal blood disorder. He was ill for some time and eventually died of a haemorrhage at the age of 54 in the family home. After leaving school at the age of 16, Morrissey joined a Wolverhampton theatre company, where he worked on sets and costumes.|$|E

5|$|In 1996 Chico left Sidley & Austin {{to become}} a senior partner of Altheimer & Gray. Oscar D’Angelo, a friend of Richard M. Daley and a former Altheimer partner, {{suggested}} to the firm’s managing partner that the firm hire Chico. In 2000, just four years later, at age 44, Chico became chairman of Altheimer. In 2002, the firm gave {{hundreds of thousands of}} dollars to Governor Rod Blagojevich and Attorney General Lisa Madigan's campaigns. In 2003, while Chico was chairman and simultaneously running for the US Senate, Altheimer became insolvent and dissolved. Some partners blamed the bankruptcy on poor management by Chico, while an attorney <b>who</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> two financial committees blamed an economic downturn.|$|E
5|$|The {{president}} and general manager of Pacific Northwest Theatres, Inc., Harry C. Arthur, believed Seattle to be a place of growing importance in the motion picture industry in the mid-1920s, and consequently as the place to invest for the long term. Arthur's company absorbed a competing chain of 40 theatres by 1926, and sought further expansion. A large holder of the theatre company's stock and debt was C. D. Stimson <b>who</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> the board of directors of both Pacific Northwest Theatres and the Metropolitan Building Company, developer of what became known as the Metropolitan Tract. Stimson promoted the establishment of a theatre district like that which had developed around a theatre he had built in Los Angeles, California. The planned Skinner Building with a theatre owned by Arthur's company would complete the Stimson development of the Metropolitan Tract.|$|E
5|$|A Bencher, Benchsitter or (formally) Master of the Bench, is {{a member}} of Pension, the {{governing}} body of the Honourable Society of Gray's Inn. The term originally referred to one <b>who</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> the benches in the main hall of the Inn which were used for dining and during moots, and the term originally had no significance. The position of Bencher developed during the 16th century when the Readers, for unknown reasons, decided that some barristers who were not Readers should be afforded the same rights and privileges as those who were, although without a voice in Pension. This was a rare practice and occurred a total of seven times within the 16th century, the first being Robert Flynt in 1549. The next was Nicholas Bacon in 1550, then Edward Stanhope in 1580, who was afforded the privilege because, although a skilled attorney, an illness meant he could never fulfil the duties of a Reader.|$|E

5|$|Rhodes {{spent the}} next few months in London, seeking out {{supporters}} for his cause in the West End, the City and, occasionally, the rural estates of the landed gentry. These efforts yielded the public backing of the prominent imperialist Harry Johnston, Alexander Livingstone Bruce (<b>who</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> the board of the East Africa Company), and Lord Balfour of Burleigh, among others. Along with Grey's active involvement and Lord Salisbury's continuing favour, the weight of this opinion seemed to be reaping dividends for Rhodes by June 1889. The amalgamation with the London syndicate was complete, and Whitehall appeared to have dropped its reservations regarding the Rudd Concession's validity. Opposition to the charter in parliament and elsewhere had been for the most part silenced, and, with the help of Rhodes's press contacts, prominently William Thomas Stead, editor of the Pall Mall Gazette, opinion in the media was starting to back the idea of a chartered company for south-central Africa. But in June 1889, just as the Colonial Office looked poised to grant the royal charter, Lobengula's letter repudiating the Rudd Concession, written two months previously, arrived in London.|$|E

According to most modern scholars, Canasatego was apparently not one of the fourteen Onondaga hereditary sachems <b>who</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> the Iroquois Grand Council.

25|$|In August 1988, a riot {{erupted in}} the park when police {{attempted}} to clear the park of homeless people; 38 people were injured. Bystanders as well as homeless people and political activists {{got caught up in}} the police action that took place on the night of August 6 and the early morning of August 7, after a large number of police surrounded the park and charged at the hemmed-in crowd while other police ordered all pedestrians not to walk on streets neighboring the park. Much of the violence was videotaped and clips were shown on local TV news reports (notably including one by a man <b>who</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> his stoop across the street from the park and continued to film while a police officer beat him up), but ultimately, although at least one case went to trial, no police officers were found culpable. A punk rock festival has been held in the park in the years since, in commemoration of the event.|$|E
25|$|The Army {{detailed}} Lahm to {{the fledgling}} Aeronautical Division, a {{section in the}} Office of the Chief Signal Officer (OCSO), on September 17, 1907, {{while he was still}} in Europe. His departure from France was delayed after a relapse of the typhoid he contracted in the spring of 1907 and he took convalescent leave at a rest home in St. Germain. It was in the home's garden on August 1, 1907, the very day that the Aeronautical Division came into being, that Lahm's father introduced him to Wilbur and Orville Wright. The elder Lahm had personally investigated the claims of the brothers and had been quietly promoting them among his colleagues in France since 1905. The meeting {{was the beginning of a}} friendship that lasted until the two brothers died. Lahm learned that the Army, through the reluctance and disinterest of the Board of Ordnance and Fortification, had obstructed the attempts of the Wright Brothers to provide the Army with an airplane, and immediately wrote his new superior, Chief Signal Officer (CSO) Brig. Gen. James Allen (<b>who</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> the board), urging that favorable consideration be given their most recent proposal.|$|E

[...] Rowe views Hudson as a codification of an issue decided by public opinion, including during the 1800 presidential election: [...] "Hudson set onto tablets the principles that guided the Jeffersonians during their wanderings in the desert." ...|$|E

The dedications of three of these works witness Mercator's access to influential patrons: the Holy Land was dedicated to [...] <b>who</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> the Great Council of Mechelen, the map of Flanders was dedicated to the Emperor himself and the globe was dedicated to Nicholas Perronet, the emperor's chief advisor. The dedicatee of the world map was more surprising: Johannes Drosius, a fellow student who, as an unorthodox priest, {{may well have been}} suspected of Lutheran heresy. Given that the symbolism of the Orbis Imago map also reflected a Lutheran view point, Mercator was exposing himself to criticism by the hardline theologians of Leuven [...]|$|E
