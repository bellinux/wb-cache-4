2500|$|After {{extensive}} touring {{in support}} of the band's third studio album, Veckatimest (2009), Grizzly Bear undertook a six-month hiatus from band-related activities. Vocalist Ed Droste noted, [...] "There was such a level of exhaustion that I really needed to pretend I wasn't in the band for a little bit. I needed to be back in my life with my friends and my spouse, and live a day-to-day existence {{that had nothing to do}} with music. That was really good for everybody." [...] Vocalist and guitarist Daniel Rossen stated, [...] "Those were strange times. [...] I felt a little bit shell-shocked by the touring experience of Veckatimest and part of me <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> there was some other version of a life that I could have that wasn't as heavily involved in the music industry." ...|$|E
60|$|MRS. ROBERTS. Oh, I <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> it was possible--but {{of course}} it isn't, and it's very flat to ask--that you'd ever {{happened}} to meet my brother there. His name is Willis Campbell.|$|E
6000|$|After {{looking through}} the house the visitor says in a furtive way, [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> I could get a drink {{anywhere}} {{in this part of}} the town?" [...] "Certainly," [...] says the guide. [...] "Drive to an American bar." ...|$|E
60|$|His lordship <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>wondering</b> whether, <b>if</b> {{approached}} in a softened mood, the other might not disgorge something quite big, when a large, warm rain-drop {{fell on his}} hand. From the bushes round about came an ever increasing patter. The sky was leaden.|$|R
6000|$|This {{brought him}} to a {{footstool}} close beside her. [...] "Thank you," [...] he murmured. [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>wondering</b> <b>just</b> then <b>if</b> it would hurt you or agitate you {{to give me some}} little satisfaction in going on with this. I know you are too true not to have told me at once if your objections were more personal than those you have made; but, Rachel, it is true, as you say, that you have never consented!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Russ's {{writing is}} {{characterized}} by anger interspersed with humor and irony. James Tiptree Jr, {{in a letter to}} her, wrote, [...] "Do you imagine that anyone with half a functional neuron can read your work and not have his fingers smoked by the bitter, multi-layered anger in it? It smells and smoulders like a volcano buried so long and deadly it <b>is</b> <b>just</b> beginning to <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> it can explode." [...] In a letter to Susan Koppelman, Russ asks of a young feminist critic [...] "where is her anger?" [...] and adds [...] "I think from now on, I will not trust anyone who isn't angry." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He retains all his {{intellectual}} diseases, however. What medicine will he find for those?" [...] Meeting the girl's startled glance, he hastened to add: [...] "I beg your pardon, I <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> he were as morbid {{when he came}} as he now seems." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{turned in}} agitation. Mr Pickering having prudently elected {{to stay in}} the shadows, {{there was no one to}} be seen. It was as if the voice of {{conscience}} had shouted 'Hi!' at him. He <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> he had imagined the whole thing, when he perceived the red glow of a cigar and beyond it a shadowy form.|$|E
60|$|Thorny forgot both sulks and shyness after that, and {{suddenly}} began to talk. Ben was flattered by {{his interest in}} the dear dog, and opened out so delightfully that he soon charmed the other by his lively tales of circus-life. Then Miss Celia felt relieved, and every thing went splendidly, especially the food; for the plates were emptied several times, the little tea-pot ran dry twice, and the hostess <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> she ought to stop her voracious guests, when something occurred which spared her that painful task.|$|E
6000|$|The {{unsatisfactory}} chauffeur reappeared. In a panic Father urged, [...] "Say, my name's Appleby and I run the tea-room at Grimsby Head--you know, {{couple of}} miles {{this side of the}} Center. It would be pretty nice for our class of business if the Madam was to stop there some time, and I <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>wondering,</b> <b>just</b> kinda <b>wondering,</b> <b>if</b> some time when she felt thirsty you c--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yep, {{finally decided}} I'd buy me one. Got the {{best on the}} market, the clerk said it was. Paid five bucks for it. <b>Just</b> <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> I got stuck. What do they charge for 'em at the store, Sid?" ...|$|R
6000|$|I risked {{the long}} laugh {{which might have}} seemed that of madness. [...] "'If I am' is lovely!" [...] And {{whether or not it}} was the special sound, in my ear, of my hilarity, I {{remember}} <b>just</b> <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> perhaps I mightn't be. [...] "Dear woman, it's the point at issue!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Last night Mr. Knopf dined at {{the house}} of Mr. Shipman, at No. 26, lower down. Mr. Shipman is the great {{jeweller}} who has his place of business in South Audley Street. By the last post there came a letter with the Brighton postmark, and marked 'urgent,' for Mr. Knopf, and he (Robertson) <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> he should run over to No. 26 with it, when his master returned. He gave one glance at the contents of the letter, asked for his A.B.C. Railway Guide, and ordered him (Robertson) to pack his bag at once and fetch him a cab.|$|E
6000|$|... "You got me.... Though {{the fellows}} usually call me 'Eddie'--Julius Edward Schwirtz is my full name--my father was named Julius, and my mother's oldest brother was named Edward--my old {{dad used to}} say it wasn't respectful to him because I always {{preferred}} 'Eddie'--old codger used to get quite het up about it. Julius sounds like you was an old Roman or something, and in the business {{you got to have}} a good easy name. Say, speaking of that, I ain't with Lowry any more; I'm chief salesman for the Ã†tna Automobile Varnish and Wax Company. I certainly got a swell territory--New York, Philly, Bean-Town, Washi'nun, Balt'more, Cleveland, Columbus, Akron, and so on, and of course most especially Detroit. Sell right direct to the jobbers and the big auto companies. Good bunch of live wires. Some class! I'm rolling in my little old four thousand bucks a year now, where before I didn't hardly make more 'n twenty-six or twenty-eight hundred. Keeps me on the jump alrightee. Fact. I got so tired and run-down-- I hadn't planned to take any vacation at all, but the boss himself says to me, 'Eddie, we can't afford to let you get sick; you're the best man we've got,' he says, 'and you got to take a good vacation now and forget all about business for a couple weeks.' 'Well,' I says, 'I <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> you was smart enough to get along without me if I was to sneak out and rubber at some scenery and maybe get up a flirtation with a pretty summer girl'--and I guess that must be you, Miss Golden!--and he laughs and says, 'Oh yes, I guess the business wouldn't go bust for a few days,' and so I goes down and gets a shave and a hair-cut and a singe and a shampoo--there ain't as much to cut as there used to be, though--ha, ha!--and here I am." ...|$|E

5000|$|This was {{the subject}} of a cartoon by Scarfe, {{reflecting}} on the Anglo-American [...] "special relationship". In it, Bush, atop scenes of devastation, disbursed unequal quantities of munitions for Israel and aid for Lebanon. A small, plaintive Blair looked on and, raising his hand, asked, [...] "Yo George. I <b>just</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> I might have a word?" ...|$|R
60|$|JOANNA (airily). Nothing. I <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>wondering</b> what he <b>is</b> doing.|$|R
5000|$|On 6 July 2013, {{the day of}} the Wimbledon Ladies Final, {{during a}} pre-match {{discussion}} on 5 Live with commentator Lindsay Davenport, Inverdale said of finalist and eventual winner Marion Bartoli: [...] "I <b>just</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> her dad, because he has obviously been the most influential person in her life, I <b>just</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> her dad did say to her when she was 12, 13, 14 maybe, 'Listen, you are never going to be, you know, a looker. You are never going to be somebody like a Sharapova, you're never going to be 5ft 11, you're never going to be somebody with long legs, so you have to compensate for that. You {{are going to have to}} be the most dogged, determined fighter that anyone has ever seen on the tennis court if you are going to make it', and she kind of is." ...|$|R
60|$|MRS. TRAVERS. Ah! We <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>wondering</b> {{where all}} you people had got to.|$|R
60|$|I <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>wondering</b> {{whether there}} wasn't some common sense in this after all, when the {{solution}} of it struck me.|$|R
6000|$|... "We <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>wondering</b> where we'd {{get some}} candy," [...] {{answered}} Dave, innocently. He {{did not think}} it wise to mention Snogger just then.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I'm not envious, Sammy Jay. I'm not {{envious of}} any bird. The ground {{is good enough}} for me. I <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>wondering,</b> that's all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Last night," [...] he answered. [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>wondering</b> how I {{could send}} a note up to you. Fortunately, I remembered your {{favorite}} walk." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good morning, Mrs. Weatherley," [...] he replied. [...] "This is the office, and I am Arnold Chetwode. We <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>wondering</b> {{what had}} become of Mr. Weatherley." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, nothing particular!" [...] I answered. [...] "Only I <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>wondering</b> what in {{the name}} of all that's miraculous can have become of Lady Orstline's necklace!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, nothing," [...] she answered. [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>wondering</b> which <b>was</b> the muckiest, Mr. St. Vincent or you--or myself, {{with whom}} you have both been cheek by jowl." ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{balanced}} {{an instant}} during which Densher might have <b>just</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> pure historic truth were {{to suffer a}} slight strain. But she dropped on the right side. [...] "I haven't let it come to that. I've been too discouraging. Aunt Maud," [...] she went on--now as lucid as ever--"considers, no doubt, {{that she has a}} pledge from him in respect to me; a pledge that would have been broken if Milly had accepted him. As the case stands that makes no difference." ...|$|R
6000|$|... (I <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>wondering</b> at his intrepidity {{in still}} keeping up the {{delusion}} of the champagne, {{and trying to}} imagine {{how he was going}} to get out of the difficulty.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] {{interrupted}} Edgar, [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>wondering</b> {{how they}} would manage if it were found necessary to have the engines of a sunk steamer taken to pieces and sent up." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It sounds delightful," [...] Jacob replied enthusiastically. [...] "Right up in Scotland you say? To {{tell you}} the truth, I <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>wondering</b> whether I couldn't drop out of things quietly {{for a week or}} so." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's a {{different}} thing," [...] declared Hannah. [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>wondering</b> this evening, {{before you came}} in, how I ever made out to cook anything on the other. Come and see how nice it looks." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; no. I <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>wondering.</b> I think I shall {{run down}} to Boston to-morrow, and see father--Or, no! Mother won't be back till to-morrow evening. Well, I {{will talk with}} you, at dinner, about it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's an improvement," [...] Jack said. [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>wondering</b> how we <b>were</b> {{going to}} sit on those things, which are not saddles at all, but only things for boxes and barrels to be {{fastened}} to." ...|$|R
6000|$|The landlord, who {{had shared}} the general {{suspicion}} abroad in the community, stared. [...] "Are you sure of that? I <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>wondering</b> about these folks. They have {{the reputation of}} being as poor as Job's off ox." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you like}} to order us a bottle of {{champagne}} and tell the waiter to put it on your bill, we shan't be offended," [...] Blanche declared. [...] "We <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>wondering</b> whether we could run to it." ...|$|R
5000|$|Ted Turner {{commented on}} CNN about the mine disaster, stating [...] "I'm <b>just</b> <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> God <b>is</b> telling us He doesn't want to drill {{offshore}} (in {{the wake of}} the Deepwater Horizon oil spill off of the Gulf of Mexico.). And right before that, we had that coal mine disaster in West Virginia where we lost 29 miners ... Maybe the Lord's tired of having the mountains of West Virginia, the tops knocked off of them so they may get more coal. I think maybe we ought to just leave the coal in the ground and go with solar and wind power and geothermals..." ...|$|R
