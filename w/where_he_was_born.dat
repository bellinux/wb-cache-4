5|$|Amin did {{not write}} an autobiography, {{and he did not}} authorize an {{official}} written account of his life. So, there are discrepancies regarding when and <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>born.</b> Most biographical sources claim that he was born in either Koboko or Kampala around 1925. Other unconfirmed sources state Amin's year of birth from as early as 1923 to as late as 1928. Amin's son Hussein has stated that his father was born in Kampala in 1928.|$|E

5|$|Maeser also {{inspired}} a relationship between Meissen, <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>born,</b> and Provo, Utah. Now, the two cities share a sister-city relationship. It is the hope of both cities that the relationship will grow to include the exchange of delegations, including manufacturers, youth, academicians, scientists, artists, associations, clubs, tourists, technicians and others, which will result in enriching the cultures of the respective cities. As of 2001, the two cities have been sending high school age students on a three-week-long exchange to gain more knowledge about their differences in society and culture.|$|E
5|$|The {{first and}} last parts of the story are told as a third-person narrative, but the middle part is written in the first person. The story begins in 1861 with the faked death of President Olivero, {{dictator}} of the South American Republic of Roncador, who has staged his own assassination. He returns to his native England, to the village <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>born</b> and raised. On the evening of his arrival Olivero notices that the stream running through the village appears to be flowing backwards, and he decides to follow the water upstream to discover the cause.|$|E
5|$|Chamberlain {{served only}} {{five months in}} the office before the Conservatives were {{defeated}} in the 1923 general election. Ramsay MacDonald became the first Labour Prime Minister, but the Labour government fell within months, necessitating another general election. By a margin of only 77 votes, Chamberlain narrowly defeated Labour candidate Oswald Mosley (who later led the British Union of Fascists). Believing he would lose if he stood again in Ladywood, Chamberlain arranged to be adopted for Birmingham Edgbaston, the district of the city <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>born</b> and which was a much safer seat which he would hold {{for the rest of}} his life. The Unionists won the election, but Chamberlain declined to serve again as Chancellor, preferring his former position as Minister of Health.|$|E

All these elements, war, mythology, troubled relations, witchcraft, animals, and death, often placed in the Ardennes, the region <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>born</b> and lives, <b>are</b> recurring themes in most of his later graphic novels, long unrelated stories in black and white. Comès was early on influenced by fellow Ardennais comic artists René Hausman and Paul Deliège, and would later become friends with his example Hugo Pratt.|$|R

5|$|Evangelis Zappas {{was often}} {{described}} as a solitary and eccentric personality, who had no children. On the other hand, {{he was a man}} of vision, determination and a patriot, who was well aware of the magnitude of his acts. His cousin, Konstantinos Zappas, was the executor of his will and he continued Evangelis Zappas philanthropic works through his legacy. Zappas's wish was to be initially buried in Romania, where he lived most of his life. But after four years his bones were exhumed and reinterred at the school's courtyard in Labovo <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>born,</b> and his skull was enshrined beneath his memorial statue outside the Zappeion in Athens, Greece. A ceremony for the interment was held at 10am on 20 October 1888 at the Zappeion. Baron Pierre de Coubertin made a similar gesture by having his heart buried at Olympia.|$|E

5|$|The {{details of}} Stanisław Koniecpolski's birth are unclear. Various dates between 1590 and 1594 have been provided, {{and none of}} his biographers {{identify}} <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>born.</b> What is known, though, is that his father, Aleksander Koniecpolski, was a wealthy magnate belonging to the szlachta (Polish nobility) and was also the voviode of Sieradz, and a staunch supporter of King Sigismund III of the Swedish House of Vasa. Koniecpolski's mother, Anna Sroczycka, {{was the daughter of}} Stanisław Sroczycki, the voivode of Kamianets-Podilskyi, and had brought several large Podole estates into the Koniecpolski family upon her marriage to Aleksander. Stanisław's brothers were Krzysztof, who held the court office of chorąży wielki koronny (Grand Standard-Bearer of the Crown) and was voivode of Bełsk from 1641; Remigiusz, who was the bishop of Chełm before his death in 1640; Jan, a castellan and the voivode of Sieradz; and Przedbór who died in 1611.|$|E

5|$|Calleia {{became a}} {{naturalized}} {{citizen of the}} United States in November 1941. During World War II, Calleia led the Malta War Relief organization in the U.S. The house <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>born</b> was destroyed in 1942; his family took refuge underground, in ancient catacombs, during the near-constant aerial bombing of Malta by the Axis powers that continued {{for more than two}} years. Under the auspices of the Motion Picture Division of USO Camp Shows, he made personal appearances at U.S. military facilities in 1943. He also accepted an invitation from the Hollywood Victory Committee to make a tour of military camps in North Africa, particularly because the tentative itinerary included Malta. On the 20,000-mile trip Calleia and his small troupe entertained service personnel in Natal, Dakar, along the coast to Casablanca and across to Tunis before going to Malta, which Calleia had not visited since 1922. They gave two shows a day and visited all of the hospitals at each stop; and they presented six shows in Malta as part of the exchange program between U.S. and British entertainment units.|$|E
5|$|After British {{victory in}} World War II, Kenyatta {{received}} a call to return to Kenya in September 1946, sailing back that month. Edna was pregnant with a second child, although she expected to never see her husband again; Kenyatta was aware that if they joined him in Kenya their lives would be made very difficult by the colony's racial laws. On his arrival in Mombasa, Kenyatta was greeted by his first wife and their children. He built a bungalow at Gatundu, near to <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>born,</b> and began farming his 32-acre estate. Kenyata met with the new Governor of Kenya, Philip Euen Mitchell, and in March 1947 accepted a post on an African Land Settlement Board, holding the post for two years. He also met with Mbiyu Koinange to discuss {{the future of the}} Koinange Independent Teachers' College in Githungui, with Koinange appointing Kenyatta as its Vice-Principal. In May 1947, Koinange moved to England, leaving Kenyatta to take full control of the college. Under Kenyatta's leadership, additional funds were raised for the construction of school buildings and the number of boys in attendance rose from 250 to 900. It was also beset with problems, including a decline in standards and teachers' strikes over non-payment of wages. Gradually, the number of enrolled pupils fell. Kenyatta built a friendship with Koinange's father, a Senior Chief, who gave Kenyatta one of his daughters to take as his third wife.|$|E
