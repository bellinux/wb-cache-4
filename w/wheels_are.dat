5|$|Although {{bicycles}} and motorcycles can {{appear to be}} simple mechanisms with only four major moving parts (frame, fork, and two wheels), these parts are arranged {{in a way that}} makes them complicated to analyze. While it is an observable fact that bikes can be ridden even when the gyroscopic effects of their <b>wheels</b> <b>are</b> canceled out, the hypothesis that the gyroscopic effects of the <b>wheels</b> <b>are</b> what keep a bike upright is common in print and online.|$|E
5|$|Although stiff <b>wheels</b> <b>are</b> {{more energy}} {{efficient}} than {{other means of}} locomotion when traveling over hard, level terrain (such as paved roads), <b>wheels</b> <b>are</b> not especially efficient on soft terrain such as soil, because they are vulnerable to rolling resistance. In rolling resistance, a vehicle loses energy to the deformation of its wheels and the surface on which they are rolling. Smaller <b>wheels</b> <b>are</b> especially susceptible to this effect. Softer surfaces deform more and recover less than firm surfaces, resulting in greater resistance. Rolling resistance on medium to hard soil can be five to eight times greater than on concrete, and on sand it can be ten to fifteen times greater. While wheels must deform the surface along their entire path, limbs induce only a small, localized deformation around the region of foot contact.|$|E
5|$|The {{front and}} rear <b>wheels</b> <b>are</b> {{different}} sizes. Instead of a spare wheel, a roadside repair kit with a 12 volt electric compressor (plugs into cigarette lighter) {{and a bottle of}} repair fluid is located under the cushion of the rear passenger seat.|$|E
50|$|The rolling (top) <b>wheel</b> <b>is</b> flat {{in cross}} section, while the anvil (bottom) <b>wheel</b> <b>is</b> domed.|$|R
50|$|During the {{production}} of the Model AA, the <b>wheels</b> <b>were</b> also changed. Spoked wheels similar in appearance to Model A wheels but much heavier were used during 1928-1929. Twenty inch 6 slot disc <b>wheels</b> <b>were</b> produced by Budd for Ford. In 1930, a new style 20 inch 5 slot disc <b>wheel</b> <b>was</b> adopted. These <b>wheels</b> <b>were</b> used for 1930 and part of 1931. The final <b>wheels</b> <b>were</b> a further modification of the 1930 wheel, with a raised center to reinforce the wheels and allow spacing of dual wheels in the rear so the tires would not rub against each other. The dual <b>wheels</b> <b>were</b> used for a variety of body styles, including dump trucks, tow trucks, tankers, fire trucks, and flatbed stake trucks. Wheel nuts changed with each new style of wheel to meet the changes made in the designs of the <b>wheel.</b> Special <b>wheels</b> <b>were</b> produced for ambulances, buses, and funeral coaches (hearses).|$|R
50|$|The Solent Eye Ferris <b>wheel</b> <b>was</b> {{proposed}} by Billy Manning Ltd for Clarence Pier in 2007. On 17 October, permission for a 130 ft <b>wheel</b> <b>was</b> granted, but {{two days later}} {{it was revealed that}} Portsmouth City Councillors wished the <b>wheel</b> <b>was</b> bigger. As a result, the original plans, which were for a 180 ft <b>wheel,</b> <b>were</b> revived and conditional planning permission subsequently granted on 19 December 2007. It was expected to cost £2 million. The plans were scrapped because the <b>wheel</b> <b>was</b> too large. In 2015, a revived plan for a 110 ft <b>wheel</b> <b>was</b> sent. It was approved and opened in Easter 2016. Despite the popularity of the <b>wheel,</b> it <b>was</b> confirmed in September 2016 that the Solent <b>Wheel</b> will <b>be</b> taken down and sent elsewhere, which was later revealed to be ireland. In March 2017, Clarence Pier's website was updated to say that the wheel would return in 2018.|$|R
5|$|<b>Wheels</b> <b>are</b> poor at {{dealing with}} {{vertical}} obstacles, especially obstacles {{on the same}} scale as the wheel itself, and {{may be unable to}} climb vertical obstacles taller than about 40% of the wheel height. Because of this limitation, wheels intended for rough terrain require a larger diameter.|$|E
5|$|Goliath {{operates}} {{with two}} generic steel and fiberglass trains with seven cars each. Each car seats four riders {{in a single}} row {{for a total of}} 28 riders per train. The supports for the seats are orange, the actual seats are black with a yellow over-the-shoulder restraint connected to each one, and the coverings for the <b>wheels</b> <b>are</b> orange, blue, and yellow.|$|E
5|$|Adding {{complexity}} to the model, such as rider movement, suspension movement, tire compliance, or frame flex, adds {{degrees of}} freedom. While the rear frame does pitch with leaning and steering, the pitch angle is completely {{constrained by the}} requirement for both wheels {{to remain on the}} ground, and so can be calculated geometrically from the other seven variables. If the location of the bike and the rotation of the <b>wheels</b> <b>are</b> ignored, the first five degrees of freedom can also be ignored, and the bike can be described by just two variables: lean angle and steer angle.|$|E
50|$|The first <b>wheel</b> <b>was</b> first {{installed}} in 2004 {{which was a}} success and consequently a larger 60 m <b>wheel</b> <b>was</b> erected in May 2007.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Wheel</b> of Manchester <b>was</b> a {{transportable}} Ferris wheel installation at Piccadilly Gardens, Manchester, England. The <b>wheel</b> <b>was</b> {{originally a}} smaller installation based in Exchange Square, first assembled in 2004. The <b>wheel's</b> size <b>was</b> increased to 60 m in 2007, and plans existed to increase this further. However, these plans were never submitted. The <b>wheel</b> <b>was</b> dismantled in 2012 {{to make way}} for 2012 Olympics celebrations and Metrolink construction work. In 2013, a new 52.7 m <b>wheel</b> <b>was</b> installed in Piccadilly Gardens.|$|R
25|$|The Tail <b>Wheel</b> <b>is</b> {{carried on}} the Windshaft in a Post Mill and drives a Stone Nut. Millstones driven by the Tail <b>Wheel</b> <b>are</b> always Overdrift stones.|$|R
5|$|Natural {{selection}} therefore {{explains why}} <b>wheels</b> <b>are</b> an unlikely {{solution to the}} problem of locomotion: a partially evolved wheel, missing one or more key components, would probably not impart an advantage to an organism. The exception to this is the flagellum, the only known example of a freely rotating propulsive system in biology; in the evolution of flagella, individual components were recruited from older structures, where they performed tasks unrelated to propulsion. The basal body that is now the rotary motor, for instance, might have evolved from a structure used by the bacterium to inject toxins into other cells. This recruitment of previously evolved structures to serve new functions is called exaptation.|$|E
5|$|Paris–Roubaix {{presents}} a technical challenge to riders, team personnel, and equipment. Special frames and <b>wheels</b> <b>are</b> often used. In the past, developments {{to cope with}} the demands of Paris–Roubaix have included the use of wider tires, cantilever brakes, and dual brake levers. More recently, manufacturers such as Specialized have developed new types of bike which are designed {{to cope with the}} demands on the cobbled classics: the best known being the Specialized Roubaix series, which has a longer wheelbase and is designed to offer the rider a more forgiving ride. Many teams disperse personnel along the course with spare wheels, equipment and bicycles to help in locations not accessible to the team car.|$|E
5|$|Several twentieth-century writers {{explored}} {{possibilities of}} wheeled creatures. L. Frank Baum's 1907 children's novel Ozma of Oz features humanoid creatures with wheels instead of hands and feet, called Wheelers. Their <b>wheels</b> <b>are</b> composed of keratin, {{which has been}} suggested by biologists {{as a means of}} avoiding nutrient and waste transfer problems with living wheels. Despite moving quickly on open terrain, the Wheelers are stymied by obstacles in their path that do not hinder creatures with limbs, and they cannot cross sand.|$|E
50|$|Five-spoke 14-inch alloy <b>wheels</b> <b>were</b> standard, while 16-inch <b>wheels</b> <b>were</b> made {{available}} later as an option, together with sports exhaust system, high compression pistons, and high lift camshaft.|$|R
50|$|Millwheel {{or water}} <b>wheel</b> <b>are</b> {{sometimes}} {{used as a}} charge in heraldic arms. The water <b>wheel</b> <b>is</b> often used to symbolize the food processing industry or industry in general.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} Nunleys Ferris <b>wheel</b> <b>is</b> now {{located in}} Barnum Island, New York. [...] The Ferris <b>wheel</b> <b>is</b> on display, {{but it is}} not powered or in running condition.|$|R
5|$|<b>Wheels</b> <b>are</b> {{prone to}} slipping—an {{inability}} to generate traction—on loose or slippery terrain. Slipping wastes energy and can potentially {{lead to a}} loss of control or becoming stuck, as with an automobile on mud or snow. This limitation of wheels {{can be seen in the}} realm of human technology: in an example of biologically inspired engineering, legged vehicles find use in the logging industry, where they allow access to terrain too challenging for wheeled vehicles to navigate. Tracked vehicles suffer less from slipping than wheeled vehicles, owing to their larger contact area with the ground—but they tend to have larger turning radii than wheeled vehicles, and they are less efficient and more mechanically complex.|$|E
25|$|The eight <b>wheels</b> <b>are</b> located as two sets, {{with two}} pairs {{at the front}} of the hull and two pairs at the rear. Split side doors are located between these two sets of wheels. The two forward pairs of <b>wheels</b> <b>are</b> {{utilized}} with power steering.|$|E
25|$|Polishing wheels {{come in a}} {{wide variety}} of types to fulfil a wide range of needs. The most common {{materials}} used for polishing <b>wheels</b> <b>are</b> wood, leather, canvas, cotton cloth, plastic, felt, paper, sheepskin, impregnated rubber, canvas composition, and wool; leather and canvas are the most common. Wooden wheels have emery or other abrasives glued onto them and are used to polish flat surfaces and maintained good edges. There are many types of cloth wheels. Cloth wheels that are cemented together are very hard and used for rough work, whereas other cloth wheels that are sewn and glued together are not as aggressive. There are cloth wheels that are not glued or cemented, instead these are sewed and have metal side plates for support. Solid felt <b>wheels</b> <b>are</b> popular for fine finishes. Hard roughing wheels can be made by cementing together strawboard paper disks. Softer paper <b>wheels</b> <b>are</b> made from felt paper. Most <b>wheels</b> <b>are</b> run at approximately 7500 surface feet per minute (SFM), however muslin, felt and leather <b>wheels</b> <b>are</b> usually run at 4000 SFM.|$|E
5000|$|A stream <b>wheel</b> <b>is</b> a {{vertically}} mounted water <b>wheel</b> that <b>is</b> rotated by {{the water}} in a water course striking paddles or blades {{at the bottom of the}} wheel. This type of water <b>wheel</b> <b>is</b> the oldest type of horizontal axis <b>wheel.</b> They <b>are</b> also known as free surface wheels because the water is not constrained by millraces or wheel pit.|$|R
5000|$|Balance Truing Caliper: This {{device was}} used in {{fashioning}} the wheels and gearwork of the clock, {{to make sure the}} wheel, particularly the balance <b>wheel</b> <b>was</b> balanced and circular. The pivots of the <b>wheel</b> <b>were</b> mounted in the caliper. An index arm was moved next to the edge and the <b>wheel</b> <b>was</b> spun to see if the edge was true.|$|R
2500|$|The {{standard}} <b>wheels</b> <b>were</b> 18inch alloys (8½×18" [...] "9-spoke"), with 255/35ZR18 {{high performance}} tyres. [...] Optional [...] "winter" [...] alloy <b>wheels</b> <b>were</b> also available, at 18inch (7½J×18"), with [...] tyres.|$|R
25|$|Diamond <b>wheels</b> <b>are</b> {{grinding}} wheels with industrial diamonds bonded to the periphery.|$|E
25|$|Ferris <b>wheels</b> <b>are</b> {{the most}} common type of {{amusement}} ride at state fairs in the US.|$|E
25|$|Four-wheel {{drive is}} {{standard}} on 370GT FOUR models. 18-inch <b>wheels</b> <b>are</b> standard for all model ranges.|$|E
50|$|Every winter, a 60-metre Ferris <b>wheel</b> <b>is</b> installed. But since 2006, due {{to major}} {{work on the}} square, the <b>wheel</b> <b>is</b> located a few metres further, on the Place Bellecour.|$|R
50|$|This type {{of prayer}} <b>wheel</b> <b>is</b> simply a prayer <b>wheel</b> that <b>is</b> turned by flowing water. The {{water that is}} touched by the <b>wheel</b> <b>is</b> said to become blessed and carries its purifying power into all life forms in the oceans and lakes that it feeds into.|$|R
50|$|A single {{solid axle}} housing with 2 single <b>wheels</b> <b>was</b> {{used at the}} front while a single solid axle housing with 2 pairs of double <b>wheels</b> <b>was</b> used at the rear.|$|R
25|$|Seventeen-inch <b>wheels</b> <b>are</b> {{standard}} for all model ranges, {{except for the}} 250GT Type S, which has 18-inch wheels.|$|E
25|$|Eighteen-inch <b>wheels</b> <b>are</b> {{standard}} for all model ranges, {{except for the}} 370GT Type P, which has 17-inch wheels.|$|E
25|$|Eighteen-inch <b>wheels</b> <b>are</b> used on {{the base}} and 370GT Type P cars, while Type S and Type SP cars include 19-inch wheels.|$|E
50|$|A smaller {{version of}} the Devil's <b>Wheel</b> <b>was</b> {{displayed}} at EXPERIMINTA Science Center FrankfurtRheinMain in December 2011. Devil's <b>wheels</b> <b>is</b> still {{a part of the}} Munich Oktoberfest and in the Taunus Wunderland.|$|R
50|$|A <b>wheel</b> <b>is</b> {{driven to}} rotate a {{fraction}} of a full turn about its axis. The tilt of the <b>wheel</b> <b>is</b> measured to produce a signal related to the rate of rotation.|$|R
50|$|Disteel brand pressed-steel {{automobile}} <b>wheels</b> <b>were</b> {{manufactured by}} the Detroit Pressed Steel Company, and {{were introduced in}} 1917 {{as an alternative to}} wooden artillery wheels with demountable rims. Pressed steel <b>wheels</b> <b>were</b> an alternative to fragile wooden wheels which would crack on impact with very rough roads. Steel <b>wheels</b> <b>were</b> both stronger and cheaper to manufacture, and could be painted any color the owner desired.|$|R
