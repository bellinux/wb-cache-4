40|$|Livestock grazing {{practices}} in Saudi Arabia {{has changed from}} the traditional pastoral system to a more sophisticated, business oriented practice. This led to the dependence of grazing practices on forage supplementation, <b>water</b> <b>hauling</b> hired labor and other livestock production factors. In order to build a data base on livestock production on rangelands, a survey research was conducted to study the most important economical factors affecting livestock grazing in Rumah area. 	The objective {{of this study was}} to determine factor inputs of grazing operation through measurement of livestock production factors per animal unit. Studied factors included herd size and components, labor, forage supplements, water, health care, fuel and transportation. The results indicated that livestock grazing currently depends year around on <b>water</b> <b>hauling,</b> forage supplements (besides grazing for four months), fuel and transportation. It is therefore recommended that forage supplementation, especially when grain barley and alfalafa are involved, should have more consideration. Besides, forage supplementation, fuel for transportation should also receive more attention...|$|R

30|$|Water is a {{key element}} to {{semi-arid}} pastoral production, and when standing water becomes limiting, major changes to the system are warranted, often including large-scale movement of livestock. Therefore, herders monitor both water quantity and quality, the interpretations of which vary by livestock species. Cattle, for example, consume larger quantities of water, thus requiring a more substantial source as compared to sheep. When the water is ‘dirty’, livestock are often moved or, in the case of small milk or olekeri herds, supplemented with <b>water</b> <b>hauled</b> by women or men on motorbikes.|$|R

In 1843 and 1845 the station and reservoir were expanded, but again proved inadequate. Four new reservoirs were built between 1849 and 1860, but prior to the Civil War, there was no significant improvement in water quality or supply.|$|R

40|$|In {{large parts}} of the world, a lack of home tap water burdens {{households}} as the water must be brought to the house from outside, at great expense in terms of effort and time. We here study how such costs affect girls’ schooling in Ghana, with an analysis based on four rounds of the Demographic and Health Surveys. We address potential endogeneity issues by building an artificial panel of clusters using GPS coordinates. Our results indicate a significant negative relation between girls’ school attendance and <b>water</b> <b>hauling</b> activity, as a halving of water fetching times increases girls’ school attendance by about 7 percentage points on average, with stronger impacts in rural communities. Our results seem to be the first definitive documentation of such a relationship in Sub-Saharan Africa.

40|$|ABSTRACT. We analyse {{data from}} sample surveys ofwater use andprices for {{households}} in 17 cities in Central America and Venezuela. In {{some of the}} cities, almost all sampled households have tap water, but in others many rely on nontap (‘coping’) sources. Coping households use less than one-fifth as much water as metered tap households do, face average water prices ten times as high, are much poorer, and face substantial <b>water</b> <b>hauling</b> costs. <b>Water</b> demand functions are estimated for metered tap households and coping households separately and jointly. Increasing block rates complicate estimation on metered tap households. Using 2 SLS, we find price elasticities of water demand, with respect to both average and marginal water price, of about – 0. 3, with average price giving the greater partial effect. Coping demand has price elasticity closer to – 0. 1, and is also negatively affected by increased hauling costs. Estimations on the joint data indicate that the water connection itself explains most {{of the difference between}} tap and coping consumption and indicate serious problems in such data pooling. 1...|$|R
40|$|Water {{is a basic}} {{need for}} all living beings, and {{providing}} access to safe drinking water to all communities {{is the responsibility of}} the government. In the above context particularly due to constraints of funding especially capital cost, adopting priority criteria for implementation of water supply projects after the prefeasibility study is a timely need. It will enable the NWSDB officials to justify their decisions to select the priority order of implementation of water supply projects on a rational basis. Prioritization is being done at present in NWSDB for urban water supply schemes and resettlements. However, there is no such priority criteria developed for selection of RWS schemes for funding at the NWSDB at present. Consequently this study was undertaken to prepare a priority criteria for the selection of RWS schemes which are carried out under RWS Section of NWSDB. The main parameters included in the priority criteria to select whether a proposed project is appropriate for implementation are source adequacy, acceptability of technical option, source extraction and service level to the community, willingness and capacity of the community to perform O&M function, to contribute to capital cost sharing, Tariff / O&M expenses and supply labour and material and justified unit capital cost per house hold. Parameters used for prioritizing the project are water quality and impact of water borne diseases before the project, whether children below 14 years are engaged in <b>water</b> <b>hauling,</b> whether the <b>water</b> <b>hauling</b> distance is above 200 m whether the community pays unjustifiably on drinking water, existing sanitary practices, availability of alternative sources and percentage of vulnerable people in the community. A set of conditions coming under each parameter were determined by formulating ranges to measure the effect of that parameter. Then scores were assigned to parameters and subsequently to conditions. The project that gets the highest score is at the highest priority. Prepared criteria were checked with 10 hypothetical cases. It was found that the resulting priority order is directly relevant to the expected outcome. Then real data related to four projects were applied and tested to ascertain practical problems with the developed Priority Criteria. The Priority Criteria could be applied after making the respective officers preparing pre-feasibility reports aware of how to include the required information. The Officers should be vigilant for special circumstances where some flexibility is needed...|$|R

40|$|Many {{islands in}} Korea have {{problems}} related to water source security and supply. Especially, water supply condition is worse in small islands remote from inland. Couples of alternatives are developed and suggested to supply water to islands including <b>water</b> <b>hauling,</b> groundwater extraction, and desalination. However, these alternatives require high energy, cost and consideration in installation and operation processes. Rainwater harvesting is sustainable option that supplies water with low energy and cost. Lack of quantitative study in rainwater harvesting system hinders {{the promotion of the}} system. Therefore, this research studied quantitative feasibility of rainwater harvesting as a water supply option in islands. Operation of rainwater harvesting system was estimated with computer simulation and the method to determine system design is suggested based on the simulation result. The method applied to condition of existing island and required capacity of the system was found to be in acceptable extent. That rainwater harvesting is estimated to be a feasible water supply option under Korean climate, which is unfavorable condition for rainwater harvesting, implies high potential applicability of rainwater harvesting technology for other regions over the world suffering from water shortage...|$|R
40|$|The primary aim of {{the cruise}} was to obtain data of the {{abundance}} and distribution of the prerecruits (0 — 3 years of age) of cod and haddock. It was also intended that the cruise should yield information about the suitability of late autumn {{as a basis for}} future investigations of this type. It is concluded that November is not favourable, chiefly because of vertical migrations of the young fish. Echo surveying was continuously carried out on the cruise, Sampling of fish was made by otter trawl and occasionally by pelagic trawl. The two types of redfish, S. marinus and S. mentella, were examined, and their distribution and some of their systematic characteristics are discussed. The stomach contents of predatory fish were examined. It appeared that 0 -group fish were exposed to heavy predation by cod and blue whiting. Deep <b>water</b> <b>hauls</b> with otter trawl were made west of Spitsbergen in order to obtain biological material of cod and Greenland halibut.

40|$|The present {{approach}} has a two-fold emphasis. On one hand, water supply options are modeled and the optimal combination is presented through {{the identification of}} the least cost water supply scheme. On the other hand the results may be used towards the delineation of sustainable environmental policy options, particularly in the vulnerable system of small islands. Hence an optimization model has been developed that minimizes the Net Present Value (NPV) of water supply projected costs for the period 2002 - 2030 for Paros Island, Greece. The non-linear generalized reduced gradient method is used, taking the capacity of water supply options as the decision variable. The model incorporates the operation of groundwater wells and boreholes, surface storage reservoirs, conventional and wind-powered desalination and <b>water</b> <b>hauling</b> by ships. Finally, it estimates the monthly water production as well as the water supply costs. The identified solution involves the combined use of all water supply options and may provide the optimal contribution of each one of the supply sources, on a monthly time step. The results indicate that conventional water supply topped by versatile desalination schemes used for the particularly demanding water consumption peaks may be the focal area of responses for the island of Paros, and by extension for other areas around the world facing similar problems...|$|R
