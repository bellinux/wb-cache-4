25|$|On November 25 and 26, 2006, L'Arc-en-Ciel {{played two}} {{shows at the}} Tokyo Dome to {{celebrate}} their 15th anniversary. The tickets for these concerts were sold out in two minutes, breaking the previous record, which was also set by them. A poll was created on their official website, during the weeks before the concert, which allowed fans to pick the songs they <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> at the show. The concert was later broadcast on the WOWOW channel on December 23, 2006, and was subsequently broadcast on Korean MTV on February 8, 2007.|$|E
500|$|Music critic Robert Christgau {{wrote that}} {{although}} he had stayed away from McLachlan's music in the past, [...] "between her Lilith Fair counterpalooza and 'Building a Mystery' bonanza, [...] had to dive in, and got less than [...] bargained for." [...] He criticized McLachlan's [...] "monumental banality" [...] and summed the album up as [...] "renormalized pop at its most unnecessary." [...] A reviewer for Rolling Stone criticized the album's slow tempo, commenting that [...] "if you {{want a piece of}} her nirvana, you have to go along at her protracted, glacial pace." [...] They said that McLachlan is too [...] "rigid in her introspection" [...] and that they <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> her [...] "work up a good head of steam".|$|E
500|$|When Lisa, Apu, and the McCartneys {{gather on}} the Kwik-E-Mart roof, Apu tells Lisa, [...] "I learned long ago to {{tolerate}} others rather than forcing my beliefs on them. You know, you can influence people without badgering them always. It's like Paul's song, 'Live and Let Live'." [...] Paul corrects Apu {{and says the}} song's title is actually [...] "Live and Let Die". In the same scene, Apu refers to himself as the [...] "fifth Beatle", and Linda alludes to {{a line in the}} Beatles' 1969 song [...] "Octopus's Garden". The McCartneys later ask Lisa if she <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> a song, and Apu sings part of [...] "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band", to which the McCartneys snap along.|$|E

500|$|The {{music for}} [...] "Where the Streets Have No Name" [...] {{originated}} from a demo that guitarist The Edge composed {{the night before}} the group resumed The Joshua Tree sessions. In an upstairs room at Melbeach House—his newly purchased home—The Edge used a four-track tape machine to record an arrangement of keyboards, bass, guitar, and a drum machine. Realising that the album sessions were approaching the end and that the band were short on exceptional live songs, The Edge wanted to [...] "conjure up the ultimate U2 live-song", so he imagined what he <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> at a future U2 show if he were a fan. After finishing the rough mix, he felt he had come up with [...] "the most amazing guitar part and song of [...] life". With no one in the house to share the demo with, The Edge recalls dancing around and punching the air in celebration.|$|E
500|$|Reactions to the {{transmissions}} were mixed. Many fans {{felt the}} transmissions disrupted {{the flow of}} the concerts. Most of the British press was highly critical. One writer for NME wrote, [...] "The Bosnian linkup was beyond bad taste. It was insulting." [...] Bono thought that they were bringing the public's attention to an important event, though he admitted that the link-ups were the most difficult thing the band had done in their career. Guitarist The Edge said, [...] "We don't normally see that kind of cold hard news. We get a very sanitized, editorialized take on everything... When you watch the television news, you are getting something palatable, whereas this was really quite unpalatable most of the time. And for that reason I think it affected people very much, including us." [...] Mullen worried that the band were exploiting the Bosnians' suffering for entertainment. During a transmission from the band's concert at Wembley Stadium, three women in Sarajevo asked what the band intended to do to help before telling Bono, [...] "We know you're {{not going to do anything}} for us. You're going to go back to a rock show. You're going to forget that we even exist. And we're all going to die." [...] During a transmission to a Glasgow concert, a Bosnian woman told the concert audience, [...] "We <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> the music, too, but we hear only the screams of wounded and tortured people and raped women." [...] Some people were upset by the circumstances of Sarajevo and were motivated to join the War Child charity project, including U2 producer Brian Eno. Despite U2's obligation to the tour and their inability to perform in Sarajevo during the war, they vowed to play the city someday.|$|E
500|$|Even {{with the}} {{armistice}} in November 1918, the war-related trials continued. The Socialist Party of America, like the IWW, had opposed the war, and {{had also been}} raided by federal authorities. Seven Socialist Party leaders, including Victor Berger, who was elected to Congress in November 1918, were indicted for alleged anti-war activities. The defendants were charged under the Espionage Act of 1917, which made it illegal [...] "to utter, print, write, or publish any disloyal, profane, scurrilous or abusive language" [...] about the armed forces, the flag, the Constitution, or democracy. The defendants, who were mostly of German birth or descent, moved {{for a change of}} venue away from Landis's courtroom, alleging that Landis had stated on November 1, 1918, that [...] "f anybody has said anything about the Germans that is worse than I have said, I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> it so I could use it myself." [...] Landis, however, examined the transcript of the trial in which the statement was supposedly made, failed to find it, declared the affidavit in support of the motion [...] "perjurious", and denied the motion. While the jury was being selected, Berger was indicted on additional espionage charges for supposedly violating the law during an earlier, unsuccessful political campaign. At the conclusion of the case, Landis took an hour to dramatically charge the jury, emphasizing the secretive nature of conspiracies and pointing at the jury box as he noted, [...] "the country was then at war". At one point, Landis leapt out of his seat, twirled his chair around, then sat on its arm. Later in his charge, he lay prone upon the bench. The jury took less than a day to convict Congressman-elect Berger and his four remaining codefendants. Landis sentenced each defendant to twenty years in federal prison. Landis denied the defendants bail pending appeal; but they quickly obtained it from an appellate court judge. [...] The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals declined to rule on the case itself, sending it on to the Supreme Court, which on January 31, 1921, overturned the convictions and sentences by a 6–3 vote, holding that Landis should have stepped aside once he was satisfied that the affidavit was legally sufficient, leaving it for another judge to decide whether it was actually true. Landis refused to comment on the Supreme Court's decision, which ordered a new trial. In 1922, charges against the defendants were dropped by the government.|$|E

[...] "I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> what happened," [...] she told Washington-area news radio station WTOP-FM. [...] "I'd like him to join the polygraph list {{like the rest of}} us did. If you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to worry about." [...] Geloo in response repeated that Roldan had answered all questions he was asked during the original investigation and was innocent of any crime that may have been committed.|$|E
2500|$|Evans never embraced {{new music}} movements; {{he kept his}} style intact. For example, he lamented {{watching}} Davis shift his style towards jazz fusion, and blamed the change on considerations of commerce. Evans commented [...] "I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> more of the consummate melodic master , but I feel that big business and his record company have had a corrupting influence on his material. The rock and pop thing certainly draws a wider audience. It happens more and more these days, that unqualified people with executive positions try to tell musicians what is good and what is bad music." [...] However, Evans and Davis kept in touch throughout their lives.|$|E
2500|$|The {{controversial}} penalty calls {{made during}} Super Bowl XL {{were met with}} criticism from both fans {{and members of the}} media, many of whom suggested that the officials had wrongly nullified several key plays made by the Seattle offense. Jason Whitlock encapsulated the views of a few when he wrote the day after the game, [...] "Leavy and his crew ruined Super Bowl XL. Am I the only one who <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> them defend their incompetence?" [...] In response to the criticisms, NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said in a statement, [...] "The game was properly officiated, including, as in most NFL games, some tight plays that produced disagreement about the calls made by the officials." [...] The game ended a playoff season that was plagued by complaints about officiating.|$|E

2500|$|In September 2010, Cuban {{provided}} an undisclosed amount of venture capital to store-front analytics company Motionloft. According to the company's CEO Jon Mills, he cold-emailed Cuban {{on a whim}} with the business proposition and claimed Cuban quickly responded that he <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> more. Mills credited that sentence for launching the company. In November 2013, several investors questioned Cuban about Mills' representation of a pending acquisition of Motionloft. [...] Cuban denied an acquisition was in place. Mills was terminated as CEO of Motionloft by stockholders on December 1, 2013, and in February 2014 was arrested by the FBI and charged with wire fraud, it being alleged that Mr. Mills misrepresented to investors that Motionloft {{was going to be}} acquired by Cisco. Cuban has gone on record to state that the technology, that at least in part is meant to serve the commercial real estate industry, is [...] "game changing" [...] for tenants.|$|E
