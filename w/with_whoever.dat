On November 19, 1968, campaign special assistant and longtime Nixon advisor Murray Chotiner proposed inviting the Cole family to the inauguration and having Vicki Cole ride the theme float. The President-elect subsequently invited Reverend and Mrs. Cole and their family to attend the inauguration; the family was brought to Washington by the Inaugural Committee. Vicki Cole carried a recreation of her sign on the theme float in the inaugural parade.|$|E

He rarely slept, citing Thomas Edison, Leonardo da Vinci, and Napoleon as fellow highly productive cat-nappers.

But she soon moved to Cuenca for some months where she went from home to home and lived <b>with</b> <b>whoever</b> would take her in including Blessed Mercedes de Jesús Molina to allow herself greater time for silent contemplation and penance. In 1865 her spiritual director fell ill and died in 1868 which was at the time the local bishop invited her to live with the Carmelites even though she had refused the offer.|$|E
25|$|The {{proposals}} {{which led}} to the 1948 Championship Tournament also specified the procedure by which challengers for the World Championship would be selected in a three-year cycle: countries affiliated to FIDE would send players to Zonal Tournaments (the number varied depending on how many good enough players each country had); the players who gained the top places in these would compete in an Interzonal Tournament (later split into two and then three tournaments as the number of countries and eligible players increased); the highest-placed players from the Interzonal would compete in the Candidates Tournament, along <b>with</b> <b>whoever</b> lost the previous title match and the second-placed competitor in the previous Candidates Tournament three years earlier; and the winner of the Candidates played a title match against the champion.

500|$|In the song, Spears and Madonna sing of {{the pleasures}} of letting go on the dancefloor, in lyrics such as [...] "I'm up against the speaker / Trying {{to take on the}} music / It's like a competition". Spears {{explained}} the concept of the song as [...] "basically about just going to a club and letting yourself go and battling <b>with</b> <b>whoever</b> is around you and battling against the music as well." [...] Magnet continued, saying, [...] "Like she was hearing the music and trying to out-dance the track or out-beat the drum or out-pluck the guitar. It's as if she's in the club, losing herself in the music." [...] William Shaw of Blender stated Madonna's verse could be interpreted as her passing the baton to a new talent, as well as [...] "a taunt from the old guard to the uptight youngster." ...|$|E
500|$|The song's {{music video}} was {{directed}} and produced {{in one day}} at a soundstage in New York City by director Paul Hunter and Dominique Trenier, D'Angelo's manager at the time. The project was originally designed as a part of Trenier's promotional strategy to transform D'Angelo's image and public appeal. On the video's concept, Trenier stated, [...] "the idea was, it would feel like one-on-one <b>with</b> <b>whoever</b> the woman was." [...] D'Angelo, who had been under intense physical workout with personal trainer Mark Jenkins, was initially anxious to appear naked in the video upon hearing Trenier's proposal. In a 2008 interview for Spin, Jenkins discussed D'Angelo's reluctance at the time to the idea for the video, stating [...] "You've got to realize, he'd never looked like that before in his life. To somebody who was so introverted, and then, in a matter of three or four months, to be so ripped-everything was happening so quickly." ...|$|E

500|$|The video {{features}} a chiseled and muscular D'Angelo, wearing a small gold-chained crucifix necklace, lip-synching while filmed {{on a platform}} from the waist-up and appearing nude; {{he was wearing a}} pair of pajama bottoms during filming, which were not visible in the video as they were hung low away from the camera's view. Trenier later explained the idea of D'Angelo appearing alone, stating [...] "We didn't want an on-screen love interest. We wanted him {{to be able to make}} contact <b>with</b> <b>whoever</b> was watching it one-on-one". Consisting of entirely one shot, the music video begins with the camera opening on the back of D'Angelo's head before rotating to the front and drawing back to a larger view of his upper torso, as he begins to lip-synch to the track, set to an all-black background. It continues with camera close-ups of sweat trickling from his tattooed arms, chiseled chest and abdominal muscles, while also flirting with a peak of his shadowed, muscular hip. The video leads to D'Angelo making emotional gestures as he lip-synchs to the choral climax and the end of the song.|$|E

2500|$|In early 1930, Zhou {{began to}} {{disagree}} with the timing of Li Lisan's strategy of favoring rich peasants and concentrating military forces for attacks on urban centers. Zhou did not openly break with these more orthodox notions, and even tried to implement them later, in 1931, in Jiangxi. When the Soviet agent Pavel Mif arrived in Shanghai to lead the Comintern in China in December 1930, Mif criticized Li's strategy as [...] "left adventurism", and criticized Zhou for compromising with Li. Zhou [...] "acknowledged" [...] his mistakes in compromising with Li in January 1931 and offered to resign from the Politburo, but was retained while other senior CCP leaders, including Li Lisan and Qu Qiubai, were removed. [...] Like Mao later recognized, Mif understood that Zhou's services as Party leader were indispensable, and that Zhou would willingly cooperate <b>with</b> <b>whoever</b> was holding power.|$|E
2500|$|He found gigs on the {{daunting}} (and taunting) San Francisco punk club circuit and survived spectacularly with an improvised solo act alternating original didgeridoo compositions with stories based on {{memories of his}} desert experiences. He also involved himself musically on stage <b>with</b> <b>whoever</b> else was performing at the same venue. One such partnership resulted when McMahon was invited to join Timothy Leary's 1980 lecture tour for a few gigs. McMahon formed a band with some musicians he met in San Francisco: Mark Isham, Kurt Wortman, and Pat Cooley. They performed under the name The Yidaki Brothers and they did their own improvised acid rock take on the subjects of some of McMahon's stories. Another notable combination was with punk electronics group Indoor Life whose songs of urban frustration [...] "buried in cement" [...] were dominated {{by the sound of}} a trombone fed through a synthesizer.|$|E
