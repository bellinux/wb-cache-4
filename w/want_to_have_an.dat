5|$|Along the way, {{the story}} was greatly {{modified}} {{to make it more}} suitable as a family film. By the time it was completed in 1981, the film had changed into a chronicle of the unlikely friendship of two creatures, who should be natural enemies and who learn society sometimes tries to determine their roles despite their better impulses. In the original screenplay, Chief was slated to die the same as in the novel, but Stevens did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> on-screen death and modified the film so that he survived.|$|E

She apologizes to Jeongsu Nam, who (in the form of an owl) has been magically cursing Sara Doryeong. The owl dies, and Sara Doryeong gives Jacheong Bi his third {{daughter}} and the Hwansaengkkot. Because Jacheong Bi is a woman and does not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> affair with another woman, Jacheong Bi flees with the Hwansaengkkot and brings Jeongsu Nam back to life. However, Jacheong bi's parents consider it evil to make a dead person be alive again, and chase Jacheong Bi away again.|$|E
500|$|Some {{fans have}} criticized the show for its non-interference policy {{with regard to the}} meerkats, asking why the film crew and {{researchers}} do not give anti-venom to snake-bitten meerkats, or euthanize those dying and suffering. US Executive Producer Mick Kaczorowski pointed out that Meerkat Manor was a show about the real lives and deaths of the meerkats. The research group has a policy against film crews interceding in natural events [...] "because they don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> effect on the gene pool by saving a weaker meerkat [...] affecting the outcome of what's natural in the Kalahari." [...] As the research project is monitoring [...] "...the breeding success and survival of individuals and ... the factors that affect reproduction and survival" [...] interfering in the natural processes would render the research results invalid. There is one exception to this rule: researchers will euthanize meerkats that contract tuberculosis, to prevent outbreaks that would threaten both the meerkat population and nearby cattle.|$|E

Turning to Calvin, she confided in him and they kiss. Whittle added that the affair had become more serious and their {{chemistry}} was [...] "more than just physical". Also according to Metcalfe, [...] "Every three months Mercedes has to have an HIV test and, yes, it is making her resent Malachy a bit. She can’t help wondering what it would be like to be with someone like Calvin who isn't HIV positive", even though she felt [...] "guilty". When Mercedes learned that she has to be retested for HIV, she feared that the test would be positive. Initially, she did not tell Malachy about it, but eventually [...] "snaps" [...] at him, telling him she [...] "won't forgive him" [...] if she has contracted HIV. The test was negative which was a [...] "huge relief" [...] for them.|$|E
2500|$|Barton started {{mixing the}} album in mid-April 2013, after the {{recording}} {{had just been}} finalized, and mixing was finished {{by the end of}} the month. It was then, that the album's short length, just 35 minutes and 3 seconds, surprised even the band: [...] "It wasn't until we got the masters sessions that we realized, 'Wow, this is like an old Van Halen record'..." [...] Wilton says that it wasn't possible for them to deliver more within the time frame they had, adding: [...] "To tell you the truth, we were at one point considering just doing 5 songs and doing an EP. But, basically, Century Media said it would be better if we could do an album." [...] Its length would later become a point of criticism, but Wilton has explained that the band prefers to choose quality over quantity: [...] "we don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> album with filler songs. We want every song to be quality. I'd rather have a 35 minute badass album, than a 50 minute long with a bunch of epic songs that really shouldn't have been on the CD." [...] La Torre has added: [...] "We tend to focus on good content, we didn't want to have ten more minutes or fifteen more minutes of music, just to say that we could." ...|$|E
2500|$|Even after Steve Bannon's {{role was}} diminished by Trump in mid-April 2017, Voris' {{organization}} was still viewed as notable by national media. [...] On May 9, 2017 The Atlantic released {{a video of}} the Church Militant offices and personal which also included pictures of the then recent New York Times and Detroit Free Press articles. Voris told The Atlantic {{that of all the}} debates held in America, the question of which is the right religion has never been debated. He complained about [...] "A tyranny, a dictatorship of relativism. [...] 'If you don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> abortion don't, I'm going to have mine, you don't want to that's fine. If you don't like gay marriage, don't marry someone of the same sex.' Societies can function like that. There is right and wrong, good and evil, truth and lies. ...The world is so mired in misunderstanding today {{that they need to be}} pointed to - here's truth." [...] Voris discussed his upbringing and the story of how he returned to Catholicism. He also challenged the label of far-right or hate group. The video ended with him saying [...] "The old Michael Voris was a lustful, prideful, acting on hurt, and sense of victim, and all that business. The new Michael Voris, or the new man, is somebody who is now dedicated to helping other people realize that there is no limit to God. It's impossible to do enough to save souls until you have drawn your last breath." ...|$|E
