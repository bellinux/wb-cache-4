6000|$|Mrs. Blythe <b>whispered</b> <b>back</b> {{and then}} said in reply to Susan's horrified ejaculations, [...] "It's always {{like that in the}} trenches, Susan." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{take any}} notice of them," [...] Mary <b>whispered</b> <b>back.</b> [...] "We'll {{just keep on}} goin'. They needn't think we're chasin' after them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] St. Vincent <b>whispered</b> <b>back,</b> [...] "she did. But I cannot {{imagine what}} {{prompted}} her. She {{must have been}} out of her head." ...|$|E
6000|$|A {{moment later}} {{and he let}} it fall with a sigh, <b>whispering</b> <b>back</b> to Otter: [...] "I cannot, it is a deadly sin. They must kill me, for I will not kill myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|As {{she drew}} {{his head down}} to whisper, her cheek touched his, and {{regardless}} of Dean, he kissed it, passionately, <b>whispering</b> <b>back,</b> [...] "My little Jean! For your sake I can be anything." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "D'ye want to know? I cry there, {{right in}} the ring, in that clinch. The weeps for me. 'I can't do it, Bill,' I <b>whisper</b> <b>back,</b> hangin' onto'm like a brother an' the referee ragin' an' draggin' at us to get us apart, an' all the wolves in the house snarlin'.|$|R
6000|$|... "It 's {{only part}} of the fun, so don't you laugh, you disrespectful boy," [...] she <b>whispered</b> <b>back</b> in a tone never used toward Sydney.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay, not farewell," [...] she <b>whispered</b> <b>back,</b> {{looking up}} at me with eyes that were full of tears, though what she meant I did not know.|$|E
6000|$|And Beatrice, {{her great}} grey eyes fixed {{steadily}} on the closing eyes beneath, <b>whispered</b> <b>back</b> {{so that no}} other soul could hear except the dying child: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So be. When {{the noise}} was loudest, walrus hides booming and priests a- singing, I says, 'Are you ready?' Gawd! Not a start, not {{a shot of the}} eyes my way, not the twitch of a muscle. 'I knew,' she answers, slow and steady as a calm spring tide. 'Where?' 'The high bank {{at the edge of the}} ice,' I <b>whispers</b> <b>back.</b> 'Jump out when I give the word.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Now {{one thing}} that does make it quite likely that there were really two apparitions of the Tree is this fact: From the most ancient times if one saw a {{villager}} of ours with his face ash-white and rigid with a ghastly fright, it was common for every one to whisper to his neighbor, [...] "Ah, he is in sin, and has got his warning." [...] And the neighbor would shudder at the thought and <b>whisper</b> <b>back,</b> [...] "Yes, poor soul, he has seen the Tree." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very likely," [...] <b>whispered</b> Orme <b>back.</b> [...] "Perhaps these camels were bred here, and {{are looking}} for their stables. Well, {{there is only one}} thing to do--go on." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think so, too," [...] Hugh <b>whispered</b> <b>back,</b> [...] "I {{felt the}} touch of his garments. Only he seemed to pass us from behind, which cannot be." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'I {{think you}} might get away,' I <b>whispered</b> <b>back.</b> 'I will cut your bonds. When you are free, slip {{through the window and}} I will guide you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I wish he {{were absent}} now," [...] I <b>whispered</b> <b>back,</b> {{for at the}} words a sudden fear shot through me, of what I could not say.|$|E
6000|$|Before Sir Patrick could <b>whisper</b> <b>back</b> {{a word in}} reply, Lady Lundie, {{cutting a}} cake of the richest Scottish composition, {{at the other end}} of the table, {{publicly}} proclaimed it to be her [...] "own cake," [...] and, as such, offered her brother-in-law a slice. The slice exhibited an eruption of plums and sweetmeats, overlaid by a perspiration of butter. It has been said that Sir Patrick had reached the age of seventy--it is, therefore, needless to add that he politely declined to commit an unprovoked outrage on his own stomach.|$|R
6000|$|... "Better {{than you}} would in my shoes," [...] <b>whispered</b> Betty <b>back</b> with ever so slight a {{trembling}} of her left eyelid; while Margaret heard the king mutter to the queen: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We can't make it," [...] she <b>whispered,</b> looking <b>back</b> at the ice {{a couple}} of hundred feet away. [...] "Our only chance is to run before it and work in slowly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear," [...] {{her father}} <b>whispered</b> <b>back</b> in English, [...] "if I were you...." [...] {{and the rest}} of that {{sentence}} also was quite inaudible to me.|$|E
6000|$|Only {{one being}} in the house knew her Christian name, and that was Miss Aldclyffe. Cytherea stepped out of bed, went to the door, and <b>whispered</b> <b>back,</b> 'Yes?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We're poor," [...] he <b>whispered</b> <b>back.</b> He added, {{with a weak}} obstinacy: [...] "I d'know as we're as poor as {{that comes}} to. The things would fetch something." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'He is {{informed}} that the Courier has yielded to temptation; {{but he is still}} too cautious to make any compromising remarks. Keeping his back turned on the bed, he shows a bottle to the Countess. It is labelled [...] "Chloroform." [...] She understands that my Lord is to be removed from his room in a convenient state of insensibility. In what part of the palace is he to be hidden? As they open the door to go out, the Countess whispers that question to the Baron. The Baron <b>whispers</b> <b>back,</b> [...] "In the vaults!" [...] The curtain falls.' ...|$|R
60|$|With this {{adaptation}} of the Refrain to himself, he stalked {{out of the room}} closely followed by Cavalletto, whom perhaps he had pressed into his service because he tolerably well knew it would not be easy to get rid of him. Mr Flintwinch, after scraping his chin, and looking about with caustic disparagement of the Pig-Market, nodded to Arthur, and followed. Mr Pancks, still penitent and depressed, followed too; after receiving with great attention a secret word or two of instructions from Arthur, and <b>whispering</b> <b>back</b> that he would see this affair out, and stand by it to the end.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the final}} analysis, Roy sees American-style {{capitalism}} as the culprit: [...] "In America, the arms industry, the oil industry, the major media networks, and, indeed, U.S. foreign policy, are all {{controlled by the}} same business combines". She puts {{the attacks on the}} World Trade Center and on Afghanistan on the same moral level, that of terrorism, and mourns the impossibility of imagining beauty after 2001: [...] "Will it be possible ever again to watch the slow, amazed blink of a newborn gecko in the sun, or <b>whisper</b> <b>back</b> to the marmot who has just whispered in your earâ€”without thinking of the World Trade Centre and Afghanistan?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is time," [...] she <b>whispered</b> <b>back,</b> [...] "but, husband, {{first let}} us kneel {{together}} here and pray to the Almighty to bless our married life {{and make us}} happy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] I <b>whispered</b> <b>back,</b> [...] "I wish I {{had said}} it. What an American {{way of putting}} it! Emerson would have liked it himself. After all, he was our prophet." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not a word until then," [...] Seaman <b>whispered</b> <b>back.</b> [...] "I {{must not}} seem to be hanging after you too much--I really did not want to come--but the matter is urgent." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do you know," [...] she <b>whispered,</b> looking <b>back,</b> {{with the}} candle {{throwing}} {{her head and}} hair into the prettiest lights and shadows, [...] "I think this stairway is lovely;" [...] and then she went on and disappeared.|$|R
6000|$|... "All in blue funk," [...] <b>whispered</b> Jeekie <b>back,</b> [...] "joke done. Get to {{business}} now. Silly fools forget {{that when they}} laugh so much. Both Bonsas very hungry and Asika want wipe out old scores. Presently you see." ...|$|R
60|$|The nobles shrank <b>back,</b> <b>whispering</b> {{together}} for a few moments. At last their leader turned to me.|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{has had a}} {{good example}} before her all her life, my dear," [...] Mr. March <b>whispered</b> <b>back,</b> with a loving look at the worn face and gray head beside him.|$|E
6000|$|Northwick did {{not seem}} to have taken the fact in, or else he could not {{appreciate}} it rightly. [...] "Do you suppose," [...] he <b>whispered</b> <b>back,</b> [...] "that she'll speak to me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is," [...] Breck <b>whispered</b> <b>back</b> cautiously, casting anxious eyes {{about in}} fear of some other listener. [...] "You know Squaw Creek?--empties in {{on the other side}} of the Yukon thirty miles up?" ...|$|E
50|$|The {{natural beauty}} of the rivers around Egg Rock has been extolled by several of America's most {{well-known}} authors. Of the stretch of the Assabet River immediately upstream of Egg Rock, Nathaniel Hawthorne wrote:A more lovely stream than the Assabet for a mile above its junction with the Concord has never flowed on earth - nowhere, indeed, except to lave the interior regions of a poet's imagination.... It comes flowing softly through the midmost privacy and deepest heart of a wood which whispers it to be quiet; while the stream <b>whispers</b> <b>back</b> again from its sedgy borders, as if river and wood were hushing one another to sleep. Yes, the river sleeps along its course and dreams {{of the sky and}} the clustering foliage.|$|R
6000|$|Mercy on us, {{how they}} did talk! first one, then the other, then all burst out together--trying to tell the history of three years in half an hour. It was {{fortunate}} that tea was at hand, to produce a lull and provide refreshment--for {{they would have been}} hoarse and faint if they had gone on much longer. Such a happy procession as filed away into the little dining room! Mr. March proudly escorted Mrs. Laurence. Mrs. March as proudly leaned on the arm of 'my son'. The old gentleman took Jo, with a whispered, [...] "You must be my girl now," [...] and a glance at the empty corner by the fire, that made Jo <b>whisper</b> <b>back,</b> [...] "I'll try to fill her place, sir." ...|$|R
50|$|Lucas' {{second album}} Street Corner Symphony was {{released}} in 1978. It featured The <b>Whispers</b> as <b>backing</b> vocalists. A single from the LP, {{of the same name}} was a homage to the 1960s doo-wop groups. The album was released on the record producer Dick Griffey's Solar Records label.|$|R
