50|$|To provide current {{collection}} {{there is a}} pantograph above each cab of the locomotive. Each unit has a 7,100 kVA traction transformer, model ONDTSE-10000/25-82UHL2. Each transformer has a high voltage <b>winding</b> and three <b>traction</b> windings. Each section also has three VIP-4000 rectifiers. Each is powered by its own <b>traction</b> <b>winding</b> and provides power to two parallel connected traction motors on a bogie. These rectifiers use thyristor control and also convert power back to alternating current during regenerative braking.|$|R
40|$|Dynamics of solitons is {{considered}} {{in the framework of}} an extended nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLSE), which is derived from a Zakharov-type model for wind-driven high-frequency (HF) surface waves in the ocean, coupled to damped low-frequency (LF) internal waves. The drive gives rise to a convective (but not absolute) instability in the system. The resulting NLSE includes a pseudo-stimulated-Raman-scattering (pseudo-SRS) term, which is a spatial-domain counterpart of the SRS term, a well-known ingredient of the temporal-domain NLSE in optics. Analysis of the field-momentum balance and direct simulations demonstrate that wavenumber downshift by the pseudo-SRS may be compensated by the upshift induced by the <b>wind</b> <b>traction,</b> thus maintaining robust bright solitons in both stationary and oscillatory forms; in particular, they are not destroyed by the underlying convective instability. Analytical soliton solutions are found in an approximate form and verified by numerical simulations. Solutions for soliton pairs are obtained in the numerical form.

40|$|University of Minnesota M. S. thesis. May 2013. Major: Electrical Engineering. Advisor: Prof Ned Mohan. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); vii, 39 pages. High frequency AC link three phase AC to three phase adjustable speed and magnitude PWM AC converters with single stage power conversion and bidirectional power &# 64258;ow {{are important in}} modern power distribution system and as a compact solution to grid connected adjustable speed drives (<b>traction,</b> <b>wind).</b> Due {{to the use of}} high frequency these types of converters achieve high power density. Open loop power factor correction, higher efficiency and reliability are important features of these types of converters. One major problem in this type of converter is the commutation of leakage energy which results in power loss, reduction in switching frequency, distortion and loss of output voltage. The topology based on the indirect modulation of matrix converters uses minimum amount of copper and has relatively less number of semiconductor switches. This thesis presents a lossless source based commutation strategy along with a modulation technique that minimizes the frequency of leakage inductance commutation. It also results in the soft switching of the output converter (Zero current switching: ZCS). The topology along with the proposed control has been analyzed, simulated and verified through experimental results. Simulation and experimental results confirm the operation...|$|R
