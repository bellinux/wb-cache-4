5000|$|For making jump rings, 10- to 18-gauge wire (2.5 to 1.3 mm) is used. Bracelet and {{necklace}} wire {{components are}} generally {{made out of}} wire that is 16-, 18- or 20-gauge (1.3 to 0.8 mm). Earring wires are usually made out of 18- or 20-gauge wire (1.0 to 0.8 mm). When making wire wrapped jewelry, these components are connected to one another with wire that is generally 20- to 26-gauge (0.8 to 0.4 mm). Frequently the connections between wire components will include a bead on the <b>wire</b> <b>connector</b> in a technique called a wire-wrapped loop. Most glass beads (but not all) are manufactured with a hole that is 1 mm in size. This will accommodate 20-gauge wire, but will probably not accommodate 18-gauge wire. Some glass beads, almost all freshwater pearls and some gemstone beads will have smaller holes and will {{require the use of}} wire thinner than 20-gauge. (The largest wire that can go through the beads is generally chosen. Beads and gemstones are much harder than the wire, and will over time saw into the wire; so thicker wire will last longer.) ...|$|E

As of 2014 {{there was only one}} twist-on connector rated or [...] "UL Listed" [...] for connecting aluminum and copper branch circuit wires in the U.S., which is the Ideal No. 65 [...] "Twister Al/Cu wire connector". These special twist-on connectors have a distinctive purple color, have been UL Listed for aluminum to copper branch circuit wire connections since 1995, and according to the manufacturer's current literature are [...] "perfect for pig-tailing a copper conductor onto aluminum branch circuit wiring in retrofit applications". The CPSC still considers the use of twist-on connectors, including the Ideal No. 65 [...] "Twister Al/Cu wire connector", to be a temporary repair. According to the CPSC, even using (listed) twist-on connectors to attach copper pigtails to older aluminum wires as a temporary repair requires special installation procedures, including abrading and pre-twisting the wires. However, the manufacturer's instructions for the Ideal No. 65 Twister only recommends pre-twisting the wires, and does not state it's required. Also the instructions do not mention physically abrading the wires as recommended by the CPSC, although the manufacturer current literature states the pre-filled [...] "compound cuts aluminum oxide". Some researchers have criticized the UL listing/tests for this <b>wire</b> <b>connector,</b> and there have been reported problems with tests (without pre-twisting) and installations. However, it is unknown if the reported installation problems were associated with unqualified persons attempting these repairs, or not using recommended special installation procedures (such as abrading and pre-twisting the wires as recommended by the CPSC for older aluminum wire, or at least pre-twisting the wires as recommended by Ideal for their connectors).|$|E

40|$|Abstract — This {{research}} {{presents a}} design of transformer bushing insulation at high-voltage wire connection side. The bushing insulator {{is made from}} composite materials between natural rubber(NR) and high-density polyethylene(HDPE). HDPE {{has been used to}} increase a weather resistance properties of natural rubber such as ultraviolet resistance, temperature and heat resistance etc. The blend ratio of materials is natural rubber 60 % and HDPE 40 %. To study properties of insulator material, it is tested by using ASTM D 2240, ASTM D 412, ASTM D 257 - 99 and ASTM D 149 - 05 standard. The test results shown that the composite material has a tensile strength equal to 4. 28 ± 5. 4 MPa, volume resistivity more than 2. 14 × 1016 Ω- cm and surface resistivity about 5. 56 × 1016 Ω/square. This insulation material can be withstanding a maximum AC power frequency voltage about 19. 7 kV/mm. In additional to design, we used a finite element method(FEM) to analyze the electric field distribution around the bushing insulator. The highest electric field strength occurs at <b>wire</b> <b>connector</b> and equal to 0. 95 kV/mm. Finally, the developed bushing insulator has been installed on 33 kV distribution system at Saraburi province...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Left {{ventricular}} assist device (LVAD) therapy can be live-saving {{for advanced}} heart failure patients. Conventional anastomosis (surgical connection) of LVAD outflow grafts to the aorta requires aortic clamping and hand-suturing. Aortic clamping {{increases the risk}} for neurological complications. Hand-suturing may be time-consuming and requires significant surgical dexterity. There is currently no commercially available device for sutureless anastomosis of large vascular grafts (diameter 3 ̆e 5 mm). To overcome these limitations, a prototype LVAD outflow graft anastomosis device (GrAD) that facilitates sutureless anastomosis was developed and tested to demonstrate proof-of-concept and feasibility for (1) secured attachment withstanding physiological pressures, and (2) comparable attachment strength to conventionally hand-sewn sutured anastomosis. Methods: To demonstrate proof-of-concept, prototype GrADs were fabricated using a nitinol <b>wire</b> <b>connector</b> attached to a 15 mm graft, felt flanged cuff, and cyanoacrylate adhesive. To demonstrate feasibility, the GrAD was anastomosed to bovine descending aorta and tested in a mock flow loop over a range of static (0, 50, 100, 150, 200 mmHg) and dynamic pressures (normal, hypertension, heart failure, LVAD support) to quantify v leakage. The maximum pull-out force for the GrAD and sutured anastomosis were also measured after completing static and dynamic testing in the mock flow loop model. Results: The GrAD remained securely attached during all static and dynamic pressure test conditions as evidenced by minimal leak rates during clinically equivalent normal (22. 1 ± 9. 3 ml/min), hypertension (23. 1 ± 10. 1 ml/min), heart failure (16. 4 ± 6. 4 ml/min), and LVAD support (16. 4 ± 4. 3 mL/min) test conditions. Significantly larger leak rates at normal dynamic pressure (120 / 80 mmHg) between the GrAD and previously reported results for hand-sutured anastomosis were not observed. Differences in peak pull-out force between GrAD (43. 57 ± 17. 31 N) and hand-sutured anastomosis (63. 48 ± 8. 72 N) were statistically indiscernible (paired t-test, p 3 ̆c 0. 5). No indications of device damage were observed. Conclusion: A prototype GrAD enabling a sutureless, adaptable, and angled LVAD outflow graft anastomosis was developed with preliminary feasibility testing demonstrating proof-of-concept. The proposed LVAD outflow GrAD may facilitate surgical implant by {{eliminating the need for}} hand-suturing, decrease implant time, and increase reliability and reproducibility with the potential to improve patient outcomes...|$|E
40|$|Industrial Automation {{has greatly}} {{improved}} the industrial processes, efficiency and productivity {{during the past}} few decades. Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC) and Microcontrollers are playing a major role in industrial automation. Interconnectivity among machines and processes is a key factor in providing high production rates and also minimizes the need of having buffer stocks {{in the middle of the}} production lines. At present there are several world-wide accepted industrial communication standards for wired networks. High installation costs, high failure rates of connectors, difficulty in troubleshooting connectors, time wastage and cost when rearranging factory floors are the main issues that industries face with wired networks. The solution to overcome the above is Wireless Networks. Wireless Networks hold the potential to help industry to use energy and materials more efficiently, lower production costs, and increase productivity. Although wireless technology has taken a major leap forward with the boom in wireless personal communications, applications to industrial sensor systems are still at the cradle stage. There are some. wireless products entering in to the industrial applications which focus more on transmitting large amount of data and almost all of them are application specific. The objective of this research project IS to come-up with a wireless communication device that can be bought off the shelf and configured by the user himself by -simply downloading readymade binaries to suit the application. The fundamental feature of the device is its ability to configure according to the sensor output. Hence the user need not to select the device based on the sensor type. A prototype was developed for the research activities and was successfully tested in two different industrial environments. Firstly it was used monitor the status of 64 knitting machines from an office area, which eliminate the need of wiring 64 machines across the factory floor to a display board in a nearby office. This provided the freedom to re-arrange machines in any order and to move the display board anywhere in the office area without bothering about Wires. Secondly the prototype was tested on a plastic injection molding machine to eliminate wires between machine sensors and the PLC. Use of wireless sensors eliminate the issues with <b>wire</b> <b>connector</b> such as loose connections, short circuits and there by greatly reducing the machine downtime. The following pages describe in detail the above two scenarios and how the prototype is designed and developed to eventually meet the above mentioned objectives and achieve a single device that matches with any type of sensor and capable of transmitting the sensor data in a user defined forma...|$|E
