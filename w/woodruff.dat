5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of World War II, <b>Woodruff</b> returned to Melbourne to continue his surgical training. During his studies, he served as the surgical associate to Albert Coates. This position was unpaid, so <b>Woodruff</b> accepted an appointment was a part-time pathology lecturer to support himself. In January 1946, <b>Woodruff</b> participated in an Australian Student Christian Movement meeting, where he met Hazel Ashby, a science graduate from Adelaide. She made a great impression on <b>Woodruff,</b> and he married her half a year later. The couple were research partners {{for the rest of}} their lives.|$|E
5|$|These {{important}} contributions to medicine and biology were first seriously honoured in 1968 when <b>Woodruff</b> {{was elected to}} be a Fellow of the Royal Society. The next year, 1969, <b>Woodruff</b> was knighted by the Queen, a rare accomplishment for a surgeon. Additionally, numerous medical organizations gave <b>Woodruff</b> honorary membership, including the American College of Surgeons, the American Surgical Association, and the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh. <b>Woodruff</b> also held office in several scientific organizations, serving as Vice-President of the Royal Society and President of The Transplantation Society. Finally, <b>Woodruff</b> served for many years as a WHO advisor and as a visiting professor {{at a number of}} universities.|$|E
5|$|After passing his exam, <b>Woodruff</b> {{entered his}} {{position}} at Sheffield, where he trained in emergency and elective surgery. Originally, {{he had planned}} to do surgical research, but Sheffield had no space for him in its surgical lab. Instead, <b>Woodruff</b> was given a place in the pathology laboratory where he studied transplant rejection, a process in which the immune system of a transplant recipient attacks the transplanted tissue. <b>Woodruff</b> was particularly interested in thyroid allografts to the anterior chamber of the eye because they did not appear to meet with rejection. Woodruff's work with the allografts gave him a solid basis to work in the developing field of transplantion and rejection. To further himself in these areas, <b>Woodruff</b> arranged to meet Peter Medawar, an eminent zoologist and important pioneer in the study of rejection. The two men discussed transplantation and rejection, beginning a lasting professional relationship. Despite his achievements at Sheffield, <b>Woodruff</b> was rejected upon applying for a post at the Royal Melbourne Hospital.|$|E
50|$|A {{collection}} of <b>Woodruff's</b> correspondence {{with his father}} is housed at the Yale University Library in New Haven, Connecticut. Included are 13 reels of microfilm which include 11,643 frames of published and unpublished material documenting <b>Woodruff's</b> career.|$|R

5|$|Arthur Hohl reprised {{the role}} of <b>Woodruff</b> from Broadway; in {{addition}} to <b>Woodruff</b> and Evans, he played a third role as the casino's proprietor. The cast also includes Dorothy Kingdon, Helena D'Algy, Patricia O'Connor, and Nancy Newman as casino regulars. This was Herbert Heyes final silent film; he returned to acting in the 1940s.|$|E
5|$|Five years later, <b>Woodruff</b> disguises {{himself with}} a beard and monocle and assumes a new {{identity}} {{in an attempt to}} court Allen. She is able to recognize him as <b>Woodruff</b> because of his fear of fire tongs. Because she is friends with the governor, she is able to arrange her husband's release from prison. Victor locates <b>Woodruff</b> in a casino and kills him. At trial, he declares that the prohibition against double jeopardy prevents his prosecution for the murder; he is set free to live happily with his wife.|$|E
5|$|In 1953, <b>Woodruff</b> {{moved to}} Dunedin {{to take up}} a {{position}} as the Chair of Surgery at the University of Otago Dunedin School of Medicine, New Zealand's only medical school at that time. <b>Woodruff</b> had earlier failed in his applications for the corresponding position at St Mary's in London and St Andrews University in Edinburgh. While in Dunedin, <b>Woodruff</b> conducted research on the use of white blood cells to increase tolerance for allografts in rats. This line of research proved to be largely unsuccessful, but some of Woodruff's other projects did well. Among his more important accomplishments in the period, <b>Woodruff</b> established a frozen skin bank for burn treatment. As there was no plastic surgeon in the city, <b>Woodruff</b> ended up being responsible for treating burns. He also worked on the phenomenon known as runt disease (graft versus host disease). Although <b>Woodruff</b> had been productive in four years in New Zealand, Dunedin had a population of roughly 100,000, so there were not enough people in the region to supply a clinical medical school, so he began to look for an appointment elsewhere.|$|E

5|$|<b>Woodruff's</b> {{contributions}} to surgery were important and long-lasting. In addition to performing the first kidney transplant in the UK, he devised {{a method of}} implanting a transplanted ureter in the bladder during transplants that is still used today. Furthermore, he established a large, efficient transplant unit in Edinburgh that {{remains one of the}} world's best. Although best known for these clinical accomplishments, <b>Woodruff's</b> {{contributions to}} the study of rejection and tolerance induction were equally important. Among these contributions, <b>Woodruff's</b> work with anti-lymphocyte serum has led to its wide use to reduce rejection symptoms in organ transplant recipients up to the current day.|$|R
5|$|It Is the Law is a 1924 American silent mystery film {{directed}} by J. Gordon Edwards and starring Arthur Hohl, Herbert Hayes, and Mona Palma. It {{is a film}} adaptation of the eponymous 1922 Broadway play by Elmer Rice, itself based on a novel by Hayden Talbot. The film depicts the story of Ruth Allen (Palma), who marries Justin Victor (Heyes) over competing suitor Albert <b>Woodruff</b> (Hohl). Seeking revenge for this slight, <b>Woodruff</b> fakes his death by killing a drifter who resembles him, and frames Victor for the murder. When <b>Woodruff</b> returns to court Allen under a new identity, she sees through his disguise. Once Victor is freed from prison, he kills <b>Woodruff,</b> and goes free because a conviction would constitute double jeopardy.|$|E
5|$|Victor also {{travels to}} Woodruff's apartment, {{intending}} to confront his former friend about the threatening phone call. When <b>Woodruff</b> sees Victor outside the apartment building, he feigns {{a cry for}} help and shoots Evans to death. Victor is blamed {{for the murder of}} the man presumed to be <b>Woodruff,</b> and is sentenced to life imprisonment.|$|E
5|$|While in Aberdeen, <b>Woodruff</b> also {{visited the}} United States on a World Health Organization (WHO) Traveling Fellowship. During the visit, he met {{many of the}} leading American surgeons, an {{experience}} that increased his own desire to continue his work and research. After returning from the US, <b>Woodruff</b> experimented {{with the effects of}} cortisone and the impact of blood antigen on rejection. As part of his blood antigen studies, <b>Woodruff</b> found two volunteers with identical blood antigens and arranged for them to exchange skin grafts. When the grafts were rejected, <b>Woodruff</b> determined that rejection must be controlled by additional factors. In 1951 <b>Woodruff</b> was awarded a Hunterian Professorship of the Royal College of Surgeons of England for his lecture The transplantation of homologous tissue and its surgical application.|$|E

5|$|<b>Woodruff</b> {{retired from}} the University of Edinburgh in 1976, his role then being filled by Prof Geoffrey Duncan Chisholm, and joined the MRC Clinical and Population Cytogenetics Unit. He spent {{the next ten years}} there, engaged in cancer {{research}} with an emphasis on tumor immunology using Corynebacterium parva. During that time, <b>Woodruff</b> also published twenty-five papers and two books. After retiring from his cancer research, <b>Woodruff</b> lived quietly with his wife in Edinburgh, traveling occasionally, until his death there on 10 March 2001 at the age of 89.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War II, <b>Woodruff</b> joined the Australian Army Medical Corps. He stayed in Melbourne until he finished his Master of Surgery Degree in 1941. At that time, {{he was assigned to}} the Tenth Australian Army General Hospital in Malaya as a captain in the Medical Corps. According to <b>Woodruff,</b> his time in Malaya was quiet and relatively leisurely as the war in the Pacific was yet to begin in earnest. However, after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor changed the situation and he was posted to a casualty clearing station where he worked as an anaesthetist, before being transferred into the Singapore General Hospital. A Japanese offensive resulted in the fall of Singapore and <b>Woodruff</b> was taken prisoner along with thousands of other Australian and British personnel.|$|E

He decided to take up medical studies {{at the end of his}} third year of undergraduate study, but his parents wanted him to finish his degree first. Despite his fears regarding his ability to succeed as an engineer, <b>Woodruff</b> placed first in his graduating class with first-class honours.

5|$|In 1957, <b>Woodruff</b> was {{appointed}} to the Chair of Surgical Science at the University of Edinburgh without requiring an interview. At the university, he split his time equally between his clinical and teaching responsibilities and his research. He was also allowed to appoint two assistant researchers who went on to become prominent in their own right, Donald Michie and James Howard. As a major part of his research, <b>Woodruff</b> served as the honorary director of a Research Group on Transplantation established by the Medical Research Council.|$|E
5|$|Michael <b>Woodruff</b> {{was born}} on 3 April 1911 in Mill Hill, London, England.
