5|$|Aversive {{conditioning}} deters bears by modifying their behaviour. Deterrents such as noise {{makers and}} rubber bullets are used {{each time the}} bear performs an undesirable action. Advice is also given to people to avoid an eventual habituation of bears to human presence. If this conditioning is continual the bear <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> likely to continue the undesirable behaviour (crossing into campsites and roads etc.).|$|E
5|$|Germany {{has come}} under {{pressure}} due to not having a government budget deficit and funding it by borrowing more. As of late 2014, the government (federal and state) has spent less than it receives in revenue, {{for the third year}} in a row, despite low economic growth. The 2015 budget includes a surplus {{for the first time since}} 1969. Current projections are that by 2019 the debt <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> than required by the Stability and Growth Pact.|$|E
5|$|Merits: As Weber himself noted, real {{bureaucracy}} <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> optimal {{and effective}} than his ideal-type model. Each of Weber's principles can degenerateand more so, {{when they are}} used to analyze the individual level in an organization. But, when implemented in a group setting in an organization, some form of efficiency and effectiveness can be achieved, especially with regard to better output. This is especially true when the Bureaucratic model emphasizes qualification (merits), specialization of job-scope (labour), hierarchy of power, rules and discipline.|$|E

5|$|Pegasus Bridge {{features}} ten {{different types}} of terrain, which affect {{the movement of the}} troops and the defensibility of certain areas. If units are situated in towns or woodland areas, their attacks <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> effective. High wind speeds will also render British parachuting troops temporarily ineffective. Units on the map are presented as small squares and can be stacked together to increase defence. While British forces may destroy various bridges throughout the game, certain bridges such as those over the Caen Canal and Orne river must be preserved in order to win the game.|$|E
5|$|Preload {{refers to}} the filling {{pressure}} of the atria {{at the end of}} diastole, when they are at their fullest. A main factor is how long it takes the ventricles to fill—if the ventricles contract faster, then there is less time to fill and the preload <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>less.</b> Preload can also be affected by a person's blood volume. The force of each contraction of the heart muscle is proportional to the preload, described as the Frank-Starling mechanism. This states that the force of contraction is directly proportional to the initial length of muscle fiber, meaning a ventricle will contract more forcefully, the more it is stretched.|$|E
5|$|The {{increased}} osmolal gap {{is caused}} by the ethylene glycol itself. As the metabolism of ethylene glycol progresses there <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> ethylene glycol and this will decrease the blood ethylene glycol concentration and the osmolal gap making this test less useful. Additionally, the presence of other alcohols such as ethanol, isopropanol, or methanol or conditions such as alcoholic or diabetic ketoacidosis, lactic acidosis, or kidney failure may also produce an elevated osmolal gap leading to a false diagnosis.|$|E

5|$|Two hazards {{are uniquely}} {{identified}} with the dam. One is that sedimentation projections are not agreed upon, {{and the other is}} that the dam sits on a seismic fault. At current levels, 80% of the land in the area is experiencing erosion, depositing about 40million tons of sediment into the Yangtze annually. Because the flow is slower above the dam, much of this sediment will now settle there instead of flowing downstream, and there <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> sediment downstream.|$|E
5|$|Where {{the dive}} site and {{underwater}} topography permit, divers often prefer to descend to maximum depth and slowly ascend throughout the dive. A slow ascent, and therefore slow pressure reduction, {{is a good}} decompression practice. When using a dive computer this type of profile may not require additional decompression stops. Dive computers, unlike decompression tables, measure depth and time at short intervals during the dive and calculate the exact decompression indicated by the decompression model, which for a multilevel profile <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> than for the square profile with the same maximum depth and duration.|$|E
5|$|Calculations for {{solution}} chemistry {{indicate that}} again, the maximum oxidation state of dubnium, +5, {{will be more}} stable than that of niobium and tantalum, and the +3 state <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> stable than those of niobium and tantalum. The propensity towards hydrolysis of cations in the highest oxidation state {{is expected to continue}} to decrease within group 5; however, it is still expected to be quite rapid. Complexation of dubnium is expected to follow group 5 trends in its richness. Calculations for hydroxo-chlorido- complexes have been conducted; they show reversal in the trends of complex formation and extraction of group 5 elements, with dubnium being more prone to do so than tantalum.|$|E

5|$|Engaging in work or an {{assigned}} task {{can generate}} an effective distraction from a reward and enable {{a person to}} wait for a longer delay, as long as the reward is not being flaunted. Having the reward present during work (and easily accessible) creates a negative frustration—akin to teasing—rather than providing motivation. For example, a child who can see other children playing outside while finishing his/her homework <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> motivated to wait for his/her turn for recess. Another factor work and task engagement adds to the delay of gratification is that if the work is interesting and has some reinforcing quality inherent to it, then attention to the reward will reduce work productivity since it becomes a distraction to the work rather than a motivation to finish it.|$|E
5|$|She {{explains}} the neurological basis for reasoning and cognition in the brain, and brings the point across that the self itself is changeable. She describes the physiology behind neurological pathways which include webs of neurons containing dendrites, axons, and synapses; and explains that certain brains with more rigid pathways <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> susceptible to new information or creative stimuli. Taylor utilizes neurological science {{to show that}} brainwashed individuals have more rigid pathways, and that rigidity can make it unlikely that the individual will rethink situations or be able to later reorganize these pathways. She explains that repetition {{is an integral part}} of brainwashing techniques because connections between neurons become stronger when exposed to incoming signals of frequency and intensity. She argues that people in their teenage years and early twenties are more susceptible to persuasion. Taylor explains that brain activity in the temporal lobe, the region responsible for artistic creativity, also causes spiritual experiences in a process known as lability.|$|E
5|$|The GHMix2.0 mode {{allows one}} to {{precisely}} create songs up to 10 min, and includes pre-defined sample tracks that can be modified on a note-by-note basis as desired. The new Jam mode lets the players select one of several standard pre-set rhythms and then play along with it on the instrument controllers in a free-form mode; however, players can then capture any segment of this music and move it to the Mix mode to compile a song. User songs are then uploaded and downloaded through the GHTunes mode of the Music Studio. While songs that violate copyright will still {{be removed from the}} service, Neversoft <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> aggressive about this and will rely more on user feedback on such issues.

5|$|Electronegativity is a {{chemical}} property {{that describes the}} tendency of an atom or a functional group to attract electrons (or electron density) towards itself. If the bond between sodium and chlorine in sodium chloride were covalent, the pair of shared electrons would be attracted to the chlorine because the effective nuclear charge on the outer electrons is +7 in chlorine but is only +1 in sodium. The electron pair is attracted {{so close to the}} chlorine atom that they are practically transferred to the chlorine atom (an ionic bond). However, if the sodium atom was replaced by a lithium atom, the electrons will not be attracted as close to the chlorine atom as before because the lithium atom is smaller, making the electron pair more strongly attracted to the closer effective nuclear charge from lithium. Hence, the larger alkali metal atoms (further down the group) <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> electronegative as the bonding pair is less strongly attracted towards them. As mentioned previously, francium is expected to be an exception.|$|E
5|$|Total solar eclipses {{are rare}} events. Although they occur somewhere on Earth every 18 months on average, it is {{estimated}} that they recur at any given place only once every 360 to 410 years, on average. The total eclipse lasts for only a maximum of a few minutes at any location, because the Moon's umbra moves eastward at over 1700km/h. Totality currently can never last more than 7min 32s. This value changes over the millennia and is currently decreasing. By the 8th millennium, the longest theoretically possible total eclipse <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> than 7min 2s. The last time an eclipse longer than 7 minutes occurred was June 30, 1973 (7 min 3 sec). Observers aboard a Concorde supersonic aircraft were able to stretch totality for this eclipse to about 74 minutes by flying along the path of the Moon's umbra. The next total eclipse exceeding seven minutes in duration will not occur until June 25, 2150. The longest total solar eclipse during the 11,000 year period from 3000 BC to at least 8000 AD will occur on July 16, 2186, when totality will last 7min 29s. For comparison, the longest total eclipse of the 20th century at 7min 8s occurred on June 20, 1955, and there are no total solar eclipses over 7min in duration in the 21st century.|$|E
5|$|The {{best thing}} of all is that the Greeks should not {{go to war with}} each other at all, but give the gods hearty thanks if by all {{speaking}} with one voice, and joining hands like people crossing a stream, {{they may be able to}} repel the attacks of barbarians and save themselves and their cities. But if this is altogether impossible, in the present juncture at least we ought to be unanimous and on our guard, when we see the bloated armaments and the vast proportions assumed by the war in the west. For even now it is evident to any one who pays even a moderate attention to public affairs, that whether the Carthaginians conquer the Romans, or the Romans the Carthaginians, it is in every way improbable that the victors will remain contented with the empire of Sicily and Italy. They will move forward: and will extend their forces and their designs farther than we could wish. Wherefore, I beseech you all to be on your guard against the danger of the crisis, and above all you, O King. You will do this, if you abandon the policy of weakening the Greeks, and thus rendering them an easy prey to the invader; and consult on the contrary for their good as you would for your own person, and have a care for all parts of Greece alike, as part and parcel of your own domains. If you act in this spirit, the Greeks will be your warm friends and faithful coadjutors in all your undertakings; while foreigners <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> ready to form designs against you, seeing with dismay the firm loyalty of the Greeks. If you are eager for action, turn your eyes to the west, and let your thoughts dwell upon the wars in Italy. Wait with coolness the turn of events there, and seize the opportunity to strike for universal dominion. Nor is the present crisis unfavourable for such a hope. But I intreat of you to postpone your controversies and wars with the Greeks to a time of greater tranquillity; and make it your supreme aim to retain the power of making peace or war with them at your own will. For if once you allow the clouds now gathering in the west to settle upon Greece, I fear exceedingly that the power of making peace or war, and in a word all these games which we are now playing against each other, will be so completely knocked out of the hands of us all, that we shall be praying heaven to grant us only this power of making war or peace with each other at our own will and pleasure, and of settling our own disputes.|$|E

Again, this cannot be taken to mean that belief in determinism is to blame; these are the results we would expect from increasing people's belief in fatalism.|$|R
