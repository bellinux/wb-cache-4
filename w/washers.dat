5|$|BuroHappold's early {{projects}} {{ranged from}} designing giant fabric umbrellas for Pink Floyd concerts to the Munich Aviary and the Mannheim Multihalle, both with Frei Otto, an architect who repeatedly worked with Buro Happold on projects which pioneered lightweight structures. The Mannheim Multihalle was a timber gridshell of 50 by 50mm lathes of hemlock of irregular form, {{depending on the}} elasticity of spring <b>washers</b> at the joints for its flexible form. It {{was one of the}} first major uses of structural gridshells.|$|E
5|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} is {{a product}} of combustion of organic matter under conditions of restricted oxygen supply, which prevents complete oxidation to carbon dioxide (CO2). Sources of carbon monoxide include cigarette smoke, house fires, faulty furnaces, heaters, wood-burning stoves, internal combustion vehicle exhaust, electrical generators, propane-fueled equipment such as portable stoves, and gasoline-powered tools such as leaf blowers, lawn mowers, high-pressure <b>washers,</b> concrete cutting saws, power trowels, and welders. Exposure typically occurs when equipment is used in buildings or semi-enclosed spaces.|$|E

5|$|By 1931, {{more than}} 80percent of the {{services}} offered by industrial laundries were sold to individual families. However, as the Great Depression continued, many people {{could no longer afford}} the services, and business declined. The decline continued after World War II when electric <b>washers</b> and dryers meant for home use became affordable to {{a large percentage of the}} populace. As individual customers disappeared, factory laundries turned to specialized services such as washing diapers or linens. In 1950, the American Linen Supply Company bought the Yale Laundry Company. In 1959, Perfect Fit Manufacturing began to use the building to make auto seat covers, tire covers, and other automotive fabrics. Perfect Fit remained in the building through 2006.|$|E
5|$|The Ghetto also {{contains}} several high-density living areas, including the Garden Apartments, the Lawnview Apartments and the Campus South, a high-rise living complex for sophomores. In 2004, the ArtStreet complex opened, {{intended as a}} combined living-learning space. It includes housing for 56 students, {{as well as a}} cafe, an amphitheater, rehearsal rooms, several activity rooms and gallery spaces, and a new studio for the campus radio station, WUDR. The Ghetto is also home to the McGinnis school house, which was acquired in 1982 and renamed the McGinnis Center; it is used as a central point of contact for Ghetto residents. The McGinnis Center houses several meeting rooms, administrative offices and laundry facilities for houses that are not equipped with <b>washers</b> and dryers.|$|E
5|$|As {{the tornado}} crossed South Richard Road, it {{intensified}} {{into a very}} high-end EF4 and inflicted catastrophic damage to several large homes as it impacted the Deer Creek subdivision. Well-built homes along South Richard Road and East Kuehl Court were leveled and swept from their foundations with debris strewn downwind. Several vehicles parked at these residences were moved some distance or tossed, and wind rowing of debris occurred. One house had its concrete walkway pulled {{a few inches from}} its original location, and notable scouring of lawn grass was observed in the subdivision. These structures were estimated to have been impacted by winds near 200mph (320km/h), the upper bound of an EF4 tornado. The homes swept away in this area were bolted to their foundations and there is some speculation that the tornado may have reached EF5 intensity at this point, though close inspection revealed that some of the <b>washers</b> were missing from the anchor bolts, and that low-lying shrubbery near the homes was left mostly intact, preventing a higher rating. Continuing northeast, the tornado temporarily weakened as it destroyed a few large barns or outbuildings, ripped the roof off two brick residences, and collapsed most walls of another house, but once again gained strength as it approached Illinois Route 64. A large restaurant and a residence had their exterior walls collapsed.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Washer</b> dryer {{combinations}} are {{a type of}} home appliance {{that handles}} the basic laundering duties of washing and drying clothes. These machines are {{often referred to as}} [...] "combo <b>washer</b> dryers" [...] or [...] "all-in-one <b>washer</b> dryers," [...] but basically the <b>washer</b> dryer combo {{is the size of a}} standard or compact washing machine, but is able to perform both washing and drying functions. Designed to handle different types of fabric and garments such as clothes, sheets, and towels, <b>washer</b> dryer combos usually have functions such as temperature controls, customizable cycle controls, and ventless systems. While combo <b>washer</b> dryers are not as effective and efficient as some full-sized, fully functional, separate <b>washer</b> and dryer machines, the combos provide a viable option for those who can benefit from having a compact machine that is able to wash and dry clothes.|$|R
5|$|Beginning the mission's fourth spacewalk at 13:45 UTC, Massimino and Good {{went to work}} {{repairing}} the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS). The spectrograph failed in 2004 due to a blown power supply. As with the ACS, the STIS was not designed {{with the intention of}} servicing it while in space, and one of the major challenges was to remove a cover plate held tight with over 100 screws using a specially designed tool called a fastener-capture plate, designed to trap the screws and <b>washers</b> and prevent them from floating into space when removed. While preparing the fastener-capture plate, Massimino encountered issues with a handrail that had to be removed to accommodate the fastener-capture plate. The handrail had a stripped bolt on the bottom, preventing it from being released. After trying multiple options without success, managers on the ground advised Massimino to use brute force to remove the handrail, so he could proceed with the removal of the cover plate. The procedure was tested at Goddard Space Flight Center prior to approving it, showing that the stripped bolt could be broken off safely using force. Working inside the orbiter, Feustel walked Massimino through the procedure slowly, advising him to tape the handrail with Kapton tape to prevent any parts from breaking off or flying loose, {{to be aware of the}} reaction the force would have, as well as to watch for sharp edges on the handrail after removal.|$|E

25|$|Leather handles {{are seen}} on some hunting and {{military}} knives, notably the KA-BAR.

25|$|Lever drags {{work through}} cam action to {{increase}} or decrease pressure on the drag <b>washers</b> located on the spool itself. Most lever drags offer preset drag positions for strike (reduced drag to avoid tearing the hook out of the fish), full (used once the hook is set) and freespool (see above). Lever drags are simpler and faster to adjust during the fight. And, since they use the spool for the washer stack rather than the drive gear, the <b>washers</b> can be larger, offering more resistance and smoother action. The disadvantage is that in freespool, there can be residual and unwanted resistance since the drag mechanism may not be {{completely out of the}} picture without resorting to more complex mechanics.|$|E
25|$|The {{mechanics}} of drag systems usually consist of {{any number of}} discs (drag <b>washers)</b> arranged in a stack on the spool shaft or in some cases, on the drive shaft. There is generally a screw or lever mechanism that presses against the washers—the higher the pressure, the greater the resistance. Drag <b>washers</b> are commonly made of materials such as steel, Teflon, carbon fiber, other reinforced plastics or metal alloys. Since large fish can generate a lot of pulling power, reels with higher available drag forces (which generate greater heat) for higher-test lines will use stronger and more heat-resistant materials than reels designed for low-test lines. A good drag system is consistent (generates the same force over and over), durable and smooth (no jerkiness).|$|E
