50|$|Littlehampton {{was laid}} out in 1849 by Benjamin Gray who named it after his native town in Sussex. By 1890 Littlehampton had become a busy {{industrial}} area. There were factories producing bricks, jam, sauces, bacon, <b>wattle</b> <b>extract,</b> a brewery and a sawmill.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: A field {{mesocosm}} {{experiment was}} conducted at the Three Gorges Reservoir to investigate the utility of black <b>wattle</b> <b>extract</b> in controlling blue algal blooms. The mesocosm experiment was divided into two parts: (1) a short-term test to evaluate how black <b>wattle</b> <b>extract</b> inhibits algal blooms in an emergency and (2) a long-term test to evaluate how black <b>wattle</b> <b>extract</b> maintains water quality and prevents algal blooms over a 1 -year period. In the short-term test, {{the results showed that}} 3 to 4 mg L 1 black <b>wattle</b> <b>extract</b> could reduce algal biomass in 1 week, whereas serious algal blooms occurred in the untreated control mesocosm. More importantly, the long-term test suggested that black <b>wattle</b> <b>extract</b> {{played a significant role in}} plankton structure optimization at lower concentrations of 1 to 2 mg L 1. In this test, phytoplankton diversity increased, with the dominant species shifting from cyanobacteria to diatoms and other algae. Meanwhile, as water quality improved through the presence of plant extract treatment, the numbers of smaller zooplankton decreased and larger species increased. Therefore, this investigation founded a novel nature plant agent that not only has good effects on algal bloom control, but also restores the aquatic ecosystem. Water Environ.

40|$|From Introduction: Although the tannins of wattle bark extract are {{generally}} considered to be of the class known as condensed tannins, a review of the general chemical nature of the tannins is given for the sake of completeness. This constitutes Part I of the thesis. Part II describes the preliminary investigation of the chemical nature of black <b>wattle</b> <b>extract...</b>|$|E
40|$|Green <b>wattle</b> tannin <b>extracts</b> were {{separated}} by lead salt precipitation into a phenolic tannin fraction and a nontannin fraction. The combustion analysis of the tannin fraction corresponded to an empirical formula C₁₅H₁₄O₆. Methoxy and acetyl values showed four oxygens were hydroxy groups while the residual oxygens could either be ether linked or carbonyl groups. Diazomethane methylation produced a white product of high methoxyl value which indicated that the four hydroxyl groups were phenolic. Chromatography of the lead salt purified tannin showed an indistinct non-fluorescent trail. Ether extraction of the tannin removed the associated Phenolic bodies. The ethereal <b>extract</b> unlike black <b>wattle</b> <b>extracts</b> contained no fisetin and evaporation of the ethereal solutions yielded a gummy non-crystalline residue. Alkaline fusion of the purified tannin produced for the first tlme a variety of acidic and phenolic compounds i. e. resorcinol, pyrogaloll, phloroglucinol β-resorcylic acid, gallic acid and protocatechuic acid. From the high yields of resorcinol (6 %) and gallic acid (3 %), these units appear to predominate. These degradation productions, coupled with the analytical figures, indicate a possible C₁₅ unit with resorcinol and pyrogallol nuclei as a basis. The non-tannin fraction failed to reveal any compound which might cause the excessive redness in green <b>wattle</b> <b>extracts.</b> Chromatography of this non-tannin fraction showed the presence of sucrose...|$|R
40|$|Polycyclic {{aromatic}} hydrocarbon (PAH) extracts of PM 2. 5 collected from combustion of seven wood species and briquettes were tested for mutagenic activities using Ames test with Salmonella typhimurium TA 98 and TA 100. The woods werePinuspinaster (maritime pine), Eucalyptus globulus (eucalypt), Quercussuber (cork oak), Acacia longifolia (golden wattle), Quercusfaginea (Portuguese oak), Oleaeuropea (olive), and Quercus ilex rotundifolia (Holm oak). Burning experiments were done using woodstove and fireplace, hot start and cold start. A mutagenic/weak mutagenic response was recorded for all species except golden <b>wattle.</b> The <b>extracts</b> with indirect acting mutagenicity were mainly obtained from fireplace and cold start conditions. The strong mutagenic extracts {{were not correlated with}} high emission factors of carcinogenic PAHs. Several samples were weak mutagens {{at low concentration}} of PAHs. The negative result recorded for the golden <b>wattle</b> <b>extracts</b> is positive since after confirmation, this species can be recommended for domestic use.

40|$|The gene {{expression}} profiles of Escherichia coli strains grown anaerobically {{with or without}} Acacia mearnsii (black <b>wattle)</b> <b>extract</b> were compared to identify tannin resistance strategies. The cell envelope stress protein gene spy and the multidrug transporter-encoding operon mdtABCD, both {{under the control of}} the BaeSR two-component regulatory system, were significantly up-regulated in the presence of tannins. BaeSR mutants were more tannin sensitive than their wild-type counterparts...|$|E
40|$|From Introduction: The wattle {{industry}} in South Africa has, from its commencement {{in the middle}} of the last century, gradually assumed a position of increasing importance in the economic structure of the country. Apart from the provision of a valuable tanning extract for home use and for export, the tree itself has proved of considerable importance to the Union’s mining industries. In addition there would appear to be possibilities for the utilisation in the near future, of the raw ground bark and the <b>wattle</b> <b>extract</b> for the manufacture of a number of by-products, including certain types of plastics...|$|E
