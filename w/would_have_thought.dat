25|$|Who <b>Would</b> <b>Have</b> <b>Thought</b> It? is a {{historical}} romance. Writing during the nineteenth century, Ruiz de Burton drew upon the classical tradition and European influence. However, her use of realism and naturalism distinguishes this novel from other historical romances at the time.|$|E
25|$|The most absurd {{part of this}} absurd fraud (at least, to English eyes) is one which, oddly enough, has {{received}} comparatively little comment. I mean {{the point at which}} the Mayor asked for a warrant, and the Captain pointed to the bayonets of his soldiery and said, 'These are my authority'. One <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> anyone would have known that no soldier would talk like that.|$|E

25|$|There {{is also a}} {{suggestion}} that the religious doctrine held by the accused persons was relevant {{to the issue of}} whether the content was objectionable or seditious. If the accused persons had religious beliefs {{similar to that of the}} tracts' author, it would have been unlikely that reasonable individuals in the position of the accused persons <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> that the content was objectionable or seditious.|$|E
25|$|Conventions of domesticity in {{the nineteenth}} century {{reinforced}} the idea that women should remain at home to look after the family. Who <b>Would</b> <b>Have</b> <b>Thought</b> It? does not follow the typical romance of domesticity because it introduces women from the domestic sphere into political and public spheres. The novel is situated during a time of modernization in the United States during which the home was transformed. The novel also parodies mid-nineteenth-century family life.|$|E
25|$|The second volume, I Am Spock (1995), saw Nimoy {{communicating}} that {{he finally}} realized {{his years of}} portraying the Spock character had led to a much greater identification between the fictional character and himself. Nimoy had much input into how Spock would act in certain situations, and conversely, Nimoy's contemplation of how Spock acted gave him cause to think about things {{in a way that}} he never <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> if he had not portrayed the character. As such, in this autobiography Nimoy maintains that in some meaningful sense he has merged with Spock {{while at the same time}} maintaining the distance between fact and fiction.|$|E
60|$|I {{remember}} {{two young}} fellers that was shipmates with me some years ago, and they was such out-and-out pals that everybody called 'em the Siamese twins. They always shipped together and shared lodgings together when they was ashore, and Ted Denver <b>would</b> no more <b>'ave</b> <b>thought</b> {{of going out}} without Charlie Brice than Charlie Brice <b>would</b> <b>'ave</b> <b>thought</b> of going out without 'im. They shared their baccy and their money and everything else, and it's my opinion that if they 'ad only 'ad one pair o' boots between 'em they'd 'ave hopped along in one each.|$|R

25|$|María Ruiz de Burton's Who <b>Would</b> <b>Have</b> <b>Thought</b> It? (1872) was {{the first}} novel to be written in English by a Mexican living in the United States. After a long period in which Ruiz de Burton's work was almost {{completely}} unknown, the novel was rediscovered by critics interested {{in the history of}} Chicano literature, and republished to acclaim in 1995. Yet Ruiz de Burton's life was not particularly typical of the Mexican-American experience, as she married a prominent US officer, Captain Henry S. Burton, {{in the aftermath of the}} Mexican–American War. The novel reflects her ambiguous position between the Californio elite and the Anglo-Saxon majority of the United States.|$|E
25|$|One theory {{provided}} by Herodotus is that Leonidas sent away {{the remainder of}} his men because he cared about their safety. The King <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> it wise to preserve those Greek troops for future battles against the Persians, but he knew that the Spartans could never abandon their post on the battlefield. The soldiers who stayed behind were to protect their escape against the Persian cavalry. Herodotus himself believed that Leonidas gave the order because he perceived the allies to be disheartened and unwilling to encounter the danger to which his own mind was made up. He therefore chose to dismiss all troops except the Thebans, Thespians and helots and save the glory for the Spartans.|$|E
25|$|The {{calculation}} of $24 also fails {{to recognize that}} the concepts of property trading and ownership held by the 17th-century Dutch and East Coast natives were both different from modern conceptions. Comparisons to modern land dealing distort the reality of what Minuit was trying to do. Both the Dutch and the Indians undoubtedly included intangibles along with any hard goods in their concept of the total transactional value. For Indians and Minuit alike, both sides felt they were getting far more than a mere 60 guilders. For instance, the natives most certainly <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> the trade included the value of the Dutch as potential military allies against rival Indian nations—a 'good' that could not be valued in currency alone. In addition, the value of the sale to Dutch and Indians alike would have included the prospect of future trade.|$|E

25|$|In May 1980 Union Rotorua was on {{passage from}} Tauranga to Sydney when she broke down 200 {{miles west of}} Cape Maria van Diemen. Union Rotoiti was only 80 miles away and the two masters agreed to attempt a tow. Captain Andrew Keyworth, {{one of the most}} senior masters of the USSCo, was the master of Union Rotoiti. With much skill on his part, and while the ships were {{sometimes}} only 25 metres apart, a line was made fast between the two ships by use of a line-carrying rocket. Once the tow began 422nm were covered in just over 56 hours at an average speed of 7.5 knots. It was a feat never before accomplished with two ships of this size, and Captain John Warren of Union Rotorua later exclaimed: ‘If anyone had previously tried to tell me it was possible … I <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> them quite barmy’.|$|E
25|$|The French {{ambassador}} to the United States registered {{a complaint with the}} President of the United States that Argonaut, by entering Lynnhaven bay, either before she captured Esperance or shortly thereafter, had violated a treaty between France and the United States. The French also accused the British of having brought Esperance into Lynnhaven for refitting for a cruise. The President passed the complaint to the Secretary of State, who forwarded the complaint to the Governor of Virginia. The Governor inquired into the matter of the British Consul at Virginia. The British Consul replied that the capture had taken place some 10 leagues off shore. The weather had forced Argonaut and her prize to shelter within the Chesapeake for some days, but that they had left as soon as practicable. Furthermore, Argonaut had paroled her French prisoners when she came into Lynnhaven and if had entered American territorial waters solely to parole her French prisoners no one <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> that objectionable. The authorities in Virginia took a number of depositions but ultimately nothing further came from the matter.|$|E
25|$|Ruiz de Burton uses {{irony and}} satire to mock American {{political}} discourses and practices by ridiculing socio-political {{structures of the}} period. Using a variety of rogues, who have pretentious and comical names, Ruiz de Burton represents the vices of nineteenth-century middle-class society. The preachers, Mr. Hackwell and Mr. Hammerhard, the neighbors, the Cackles, and other political figures in Who <b>Would</b> <b>Have</b> <b>Thought</b> It? are unmasked to break down ideological myths of American political rhetoric by contrasting {{the expectations of the}} nation with the reality of their actions. American expectations include promoting civil virtue and acting against corruption. However, Mr. Hackwell, the primary religious figure in the novel, schemes to increase his wealth in order to satisfy his ravenous greed. The Cackles clan represents Northern politicians who are only motivated by self-interest. Ruiz de Burton implies that the national practice of self-deception, misrepresentation and secrecy are deeply rooted in the American character, though very rarely revealed. Juxtaposed to this satire of American life are the virtues of the good and beautiful Lola.|$|E

500|$|In {{reference}} to Fenrir's presentation in the Prose Edda, Andy Orchard theorizes that [...] "the hound (or wolf)" [...] Garmr, Sköll, and Hati Hróðvitnisson were originally simply all Fenrir, stating that [...] "Snorri, characteristically, {{is careful to}} make distinctions, naming the wolves who devour the sun and moon as Sköll and Hati Hróðvitnisson respectively, and describing an encounter between Garm and Týr (who, one <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>thought,</b> might like to get his hand on Fenrir) at Ragnarök." ...|$|E

[...] Brown reacted positively to [...] "Kingmaker," [...] though noted that the song seems to [...] "pillage" [...] Black Sabbath's [...] "Children of the Grave." [...] Many of the remaining songs on the album were criticized by Brown for being [...] "cliché," [...] "pathetic" [...] and/or [...] "awkward," [...] among other things.|$|E
500|$|Hughes {{said that}} he had Broderick in mind when he wrote the screenplay, saying Broderick was the only actor he could think of who could pull off the role, calling him clever and charming. [...] "Certain guys would have played Ferris and you <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>thought,</b> 'Where's my wallet?'" [...] Hughes said. [...] "I had to have that look; that charm had to come through.

500|$|In its {{original}} American broadcast on May 7, 2009, [...] "Cafe Disco" [...] was watched by 7.71 million viewers, according to Nielsen ratings, an {{increase from the}} previous week. The episode received a 4.5 rating/14 share among viewers aged between 18 and 34, and a 3.8 rating/11 share among viewers between 18 and 49. The episode outperformed the 3.5 rating/9 share of CBS' crime drama series [...] in the 18—49 category. The Office creator Greg Daniels said he was particularly proud of this, {{especially in light of}} the series' upcoming 100th episode, [...] "Company Picnic"; Daniels said of beating CSI, [...] "Who <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> that when we aired for the first time?" ...|$|E
