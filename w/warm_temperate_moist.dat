5|$|Ficus obliqua occurs from Mount Dromedary (36° S) in {{southern}} New South Wales northwards {{along the coast}} and Great Dividing Range {{to the tip of}} Cape York Peninsula in north Queensland. Outside Australia it occurs on New Guinea and offshore islands, through eastern Indonesia to Sulawesi in the west and east into the southwestern Pacific, where it is found in New Caledonia, Fiji, Tonga, Samoa and Vanuatu. It had been thought to occur in Western Australia, but these collections have been now referred to Ficus brachypoda. Preferring soils with high nutrient and water content, it occurs on sandstone or latite soils in the Sydney region. The habitat is <b>warm</b> <b>temperate</b> to <b>moist</b> subtropical rainforest. Large specimens can rise above the canopy as emergent trees.|$|R
40|$|A risk {{assessment}} of vegetation zone responses {{to climate change}} was conducted using the classical Holdridge life zone model on the Loess Plateau of Northwest China. The results show that there are currently ten vegetation zones occurring on the Loess Plateau (1950 – 2000), including alvar desert, alpine wet tundra, alpine rain tundra, boreal moist forest, boreal wet forest, cool temperate desert, cool temperate desert scrub, cool temperate steppe, cool <b>temperate</b> <b>moist</b> forest, <b>warm</b> <b>temperate</b> desert scrub, <b>warm</b> <b>temperate</b> thorn steppe, and <b>warm</b> <b>temperate</b> dry forest. Seventy years later (2070 S), the alvar desert, the alpine wet tundra and the cool temperate desert will disappear, while <b>warm</b> <b>temperate</b> desert scrub and <b>warm</b> <b>temperate</b> thorn steppe will emerge. The area proportion of <b>warm</b> <b>temperate</b> dry forest will expand from 12. 2 % to 22. 8 %– 37. 2 %, while that of cool <b>temperate</b> <b>moist</b> forest will decrease from 18. 5 % to 6. 9 %– 9. 5 %. The area proportion of cool temperate steppe will decrease from 51. 8 % to 34. 5 %– 51. 6 %. Our results suggest that future climate change will be conducive to the growth and expansion of forest zones on the Loess Plateau, which can provide valuable reference information for regional vegetation restoration planning and adaptive strategies in this region...|$|R

40|$|The {{lower part}} of the syn-rift Barremian-?Hauterivian section at Site 549 {{contains}} a large amount of acid-resistant land-derived organic matter that, as elsewhere in the Cretaceous sediments of the IPOD Leg 80 sites, is thermally immature. This plant debris was derived from a vegetation made up of many species of pteridophytes and gymnosperms. The palynofacies indicate that the sediments were deposited in shallow marginal and nonmarine environments and that the climate was probably <b>warm</b> <b>temperate</b> and fairly <b>moist</b> at the time. Source potential for gas is suggested at some horizons. Most of the younger Lower Cretaceous sediments at this and the other sites were deposited in more open marine conditions. Although they generally contain less organic matter, land plant remains continue to comprise {{a major part of the}} palynofacies. The Upper Cretaceous sediments were mainly deposited in well oxygenated conditions and are organically lean. However, stratigraphically restricted dark-colored shales at Sites 549 to 551 contain relatively large quantities of amorphous detritus of at least partly marine origin. These characteristics are suggestive of deposition during periods of restricted circulation and also of source potential for oil and gas if maturation levels had been higher...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{change of}} {{terrestrial}} ecosystem spatial distribution driven by climatic change {{is one of}} important factors leading to soil erosion in Loess Plateau. The quantitative analysis of climate change impacting on vegetation ecosystem will afford the efficient data to support the implement of reasonability ecological restoration project. HLZ ecosystem model is employed to simulate the changes of climate-vegetation ecosystem in Loess Plateau during the periods from 1964 to 1974 (C 1), from 1975 to 1985 (C 2), from 1986 to 1996 (C 3), and from 1997 to 2007 (C 4) on spatial resolution of 1 km× 1 km. Combining the elevation data, {{the results show that}} there are 15 types of climate-vegetation ecosystem in which the cool temperate steppe, cool <b>temperate</b> <b>moist</b> forest and <b>warm</b> <b>temperate</b> are the major climate-vegetation types which respectively occupied the 82. 73 %, 83. 19 %, 82. 86 % during the periods from C 1 to C 4, and 79. 77 % of the sum area of Loess Plateau. The most types of moist climate-vegetation ecosystems have decreased since C 1 period, especially the area of nival area, alpine wet tundra and alpine rain tundra have rapidly decreased during the four periods. Furthermore, the average distribution elevation of all climate-vegetation ecosystems distribution are on the increase except <b>warm</b> <b>temperate</b> thorn steppe, especially the average distribution elevation of alpine rain tundra, boreal wet forest, cool <b>temperate</b> scrub and <b>warm</b> <b>temperate</b> dry forest have continuously increased during the four periods...|$|R

40|$|The {{spatial pattern}} and mean-center shift of major {{terrestrial}} ecosystems, termed Holdridge Life Zones (HLZ), during the periods from 1961 to 1990 (T 1), from 2010 to 2039 (T 2), from 2040 to 2069 (T 3) and from 2070 to 2099 (T 4) {{were analyzed by}} combining the zonal patterns of climatic change in China and the climatic change scenarios of HadCM 2 and HadCM 3. The results showed that nival area would decrease rapidly with temperature increase in the future. HadCM 2 and HadCM 3 predicted that the nival areas might disappear in 552 years and 204 years, respectively. Using both HadCM 2 and HadCM 3, the five HLZ types with the largest areal extent are nival zone, cool temperate moist forest, <b>warm</b> <b>temperate</b> <b>moist</b> forest, subtropical moist forest and boreal wet forest, which collectively {{account for more than}} 50 % of China's land mass. Among these five HLZ types, nival zone, <b>warm</b> <b>temperate</b> <b>moist</b> forest and boreal wet forest would decrease continuously, whereas subtropical moist forest and cool temperate forest would increase continuously during the four periods. HLZ diversity and patch connectivity would increase continuously in the 21 st century. The shift distances of mean centers of HLZ types simulated using HadCM 3 were markedly greater than those simulated using HadCM 2, in general. The results from both HadCM 2 and HadCM 3 showed that boreal wet forest, subtropical moist forest, tropical dry forest, <b>warm</b> <b>temperate</b> <b>moist</b> forest and subtropical wet forest had bigger shift ranges, indicating that these HLZ types are more sensitive to the climatic change scenarios of HacCM 2 and HadCM 3.

40|$|Surfaces of mean annual {{temperature}} and {{mean annual precipitation}} {{during the period from}} 1951 to 2010 in Jiang-Xi province (Poyang Lake Basin) of China are simulated by means of a method for high accuracy surface modeling (HASM), using data from 106 weather observation stations scattered over and around Poyang Lake Basin. Methodologically, we analyzed errors of HASM by comparing with classical methods. The analysis indicated that HASM has a much higher accuracy than the classical methods. The simulation results from HASM show that mean {{annual temperature}} was respectively 17. 05 degrees C and 17. 46 degrees C in the periods from 1951 to 1980 (P 1) and from 1981 to 2010 (P 2). Mean annual precipitation was 1602 mm and 1718 mm, respectively in the P 1 and P 2. In other words, climate has become warmer and wetter in recent 60 years in general. The ecosystems are very sensitive to relatively small changes in surface meteorology. <b>Warm</b> <b>temperate</b> <b>moist</b> forest and subtropical moist forest were the dominant HLZ types, accounted for 94. 99 % of total area of Jiang-Xi province. The proportion of <b>warm</b> <b>temperate</b> <b>moist</b> forest decreased from 30. 81 % to 16. 84 %, while subtropical moist forest increased from 64. 79 % to 76. 73 %. The mean centers of the rare HLZ types, cool temperate wet forest, cool temperate rain forest and subtropical wet forest, moved respectively 291 km, 104 km and 122 km. Warm temperate wet forest and subtropical moist forest had a little shift, moved respectively 21 km and 17 km during the period from P 1 to P 2. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
