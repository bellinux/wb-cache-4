The ground-based TROpospheric WAter RAdiometer (TROWARA) at Bern, Switzerland continuously measures integrated liquid water and infrared brightness temperature with a time resolution of 6 – 11 s since 2004.

TROWARA is sensitive to liquid <b>water</b> <b>clouds</b> while the microwave signal of ice clouds is negligible.

50|$|The {{habitable}} zone {{around a}} star is {{the region where}} the temperature is just right to allow liquid water to exist on a planet; that is, not {{too close to the}} star for the water to evaporate and not too far away from the star for the water to freeze. The heat produced by stars varies depending on the size and age of the star, so that the habitable zone can be at different distances for different stars. Also, the atmospheric conditions on the planet influence the planet's ability to retain heat so that the location of the habitable zone is also specific to each type of planet: desert planets (also known as dry planets), with very little water, will have less water vapor in the atmosphere than Earth and so have a reduced greenhouse effect, meaning that a desert planet could maintain oases of water closer to its star than Earth is to the Sun. The lack of water also means there is less ice to reflect heat into space, so the outer edge of desert-planet habitable zones is further out. Rocky planets with a thick hydrogen atmosphere could maintain surface water much further out than the Earth-Sun distance. Planets with larger mass have wider habitable zones because the gravity reduces the <b>water</b> <b>cloud</b> column depth which reduces the greenhouse effect of water vapor, thus moving the inner edge of the habitable zone closer to the star.|$|E

40|$|Lidar/Radiometer (LIRAD) {{observations}} {{from the ground}} have yielded values of the cloud backscatter-to-extinction ratio and emittance of midlevel and boundary layer clouds, {{as well as of}} the more common cirrus observations. The cloud backscatter-to-extinction ratio is numerically equal to the cloud particle backscatter phase function, when suitably normalised. CALIPSO will be launched in early 2005 and will carry a two-wavelength depolarisation lidar together with a scanning infrared filter radiometer. Thus CALIPSO is ideal for LIRAD-type observations. Although midlevel and boundary layer <b>water</b> <b>clouds</b> tend to have higher optical depths than cirrus clouds, LIRAD observations of midlevel clouds [1] and boundary layer clouds [2] indicate that cases of semitransparent <b>water</b> <b>clouds</b> do occur. The backscatter phase function of <b>water</b> <b>clouds</b> is also much more constant than that for ice clouds. Theoretical studies [2, 3] indicate that the total variation of backscatter phase function in <b>water</b> <b>clouds</b> is about ± 5 %. An advantage of this small variation is that the integrated backscatter can be used also for calibration of the lidar instrument or, alternatively, estimation of the multiple scattering factor in the backscatter. An inherent difficulty in observations of <b>water</b> <b>clouds</b> is that the typical cellular nature of stratocumulus and altocumulus clouds implies that the field of view of the lidar may not be cloud-filled at any one time. Thus a signal from an unfilled field of view could be confused with that from a cloud of lower optical depth. Further, the field of view of the infrared radiometer is different from that of the lidar. In order to calibrate the lidar, a cloud-filled field of view is required.

FIRTM 2 is applicable to three atmospheric conditions: (1) clear-sky, (2) single-layered ice or <b>water</b> <b>cloud,</b> and (3) two simultaneous cloud layers in a column (e. g., ice cloud overlying <b>water</b> <b>cloud).</b> Moreover, FIRTM 2 outputs the derivatives (i. e., Jacobians) of the TOA brightness temperature with respect to cloud optical thickness and effective particle size. Sensitivity analyses have been carried out to assess the performance of FIRTM 2 for two spectral regions, namely the longwave (LW) band (587. 3 – 1179. 5 cm! 1) and the short-to-medium wave (SMW) band (1180. 1 – 2228. 9 cm! 1).
