40|$|The {{finite element}} {{simulation}} {{is currently a}} powerful tool to optimize forming processes {{in order to produce}} defect-free products. Wrinkling and springback are main geometrical defects arising in sheet metal forming. Nevertheless, the prediction of such defects requires accurate numerical models. This study presents the experimental and numerical analysis of a rail with high tendency to develop both <b>wrinkling</b> (<b>top</b> surface of geometry) and springback (flange). The punch force evolution and the final geometry of the rail, evaluated in four different cross-sections, are the main variables analysed. Globally, the numerical results are in good agreement with the experimental measurements. However, the shape of the wrinkle is significantly influenced by the symmetry conditions considered in the model (1 / 4 of the blank). In fact, considering the full model of the blank, the numerical results are in better agreement with the experimental ones. On the other hand, the computational cost of the numerical simulation considering the full blank is approximately 12 times higher than using 1 / 4 of the blank...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{wettability}} {{of materials}} {{is a very}} important aspect of surface science governed by the chemical composition of the surface and its morphology. In this context, materials replicating nature's superhydrophobic surfaces, such as lotus leafs, rose petals and butterfly wings, have widely attracted attention of physicists and material engineers [1 – 3]. Despite of considerable efforts during the last decade, superhydrophobic surfaces are still expensive and usually involved microfabrication processes, such as photolithography technique. In this study, we propose an original and simple method to create superhydrophobic surfaces by controling elastic instabilities [4 – 8]. Indeed, we demonstrate that the self-organization of <b>wrinkles</b> on <b>top</b> of non-wettable polymer surfaces leads to surperhydrophobic surfaces...|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} a new shape operator that superimposes <b>wrinkles</b> on <b>top</b> of a smooth parametric surface. Previous research on wrinkles focused mostly on fabrics, attempting {{to predict how}} a given piece of cloth would drape under prescribed simple boundary conditions. Our work provides a parametric tool to a CAD operator, which can specify a few basic parameters such as wrinkle magnitude and extent (these terms will also be defined) to generate wrinkle-shaped deformations along prescribed curves on a surface. The essential geometric transformation to map the smooth surface to a wrinkled one will be defined purely {{in terms of the}} geometry of the surface and the input parameters. Our model is based on two surface properties: geodesic offsets and Gaussian curvature. Practical implementation of this operator will be discussed, and examples presented. Finally, the motivation for the operator will be given through its application in the computer-aided design of footwear...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} two new shape operators that superimpose <b>wrinkles</b> on <b>top</b> of {{a smooth}} NURBS surface. Previous research studying wrinkles focused mostly on cloth modeling or in animations, which are driven more by visual realism, but allow large elastic deformations. Our operators generate wrinkle-shaped deformations {{in a region}} of a smooth surface along a given boundary based on a few basic parametric inputs such as wrinkle magnitude and extent (these terms will be defined in the paper). The essential geometric transformation to map the smooth surface to a wrinkled one will be defined purely {{in terms of the}} geometry of the surface and the input parameters. Our model is based on two surface properties: geodesic offsets and surface energy. Practical implementation of the operators is discussed, and examples presented.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{approach}} for physics based simulation of the wrin-kling of multi-layer skin with heterogeneous material properties. Each layer of skin is simulated with an adaptive mesh, with the different layers coupled via constraints that only permit wrinkle de-formation at wavelengths that match the physical {{properties of the}} multi-layer model. We use texture maps to define varying elastic-ity and thickness of the skin layers, and design our constraints as continuous functions, which we discretize at run time to match the changing adaptive mesh topology. In our examples, we use blend shapes to drive the bottom layer, and we present a variety of exam-ples of simulations that demonstrate small <b>wrinkles</b> on <b>top</b> of larger <b>wrinkles,</b> which is a typical pattern seen on human skin. Finally, we show that our physics-based wrinkles {{can be used in}} the auto-matic creation of wrinkle maps, allowing the visual details of our high resolution simulations to be produced at real time speeds...|$|R
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{a simple and}} cost-effective approach to realize two combined surface features of different scales together, namely submillimeter-sized protrusion array and microwrinkles, atop a polystyrene shape-memory polymer. Two different types of protrusions, namely flat-top protrusion and crown-shaped protrusion, were studied. The array of protrusions was produced by the Indentation-Polishing-Heating (IPH) process. Compactly packed steel balls were used for making array of indents. A thin gold layer was sputter deposited atop the polymer surface right after polishing. After heating for shape recovery, array of protrusions with <b>wrinkles</b> on the <b>top</b> due to the buckling of gold layer was produced. Buckling, protrusion, shape-memory polymer, shape recovery, wrinkles...|$|R

40|$|Lotus flowers, rose petals, some plant {{leaves and}} insects have a {{naturally}} super-hydrophobic surface. In fact, {{the surface of}} a Lotus leaf is covered by micro and nano structures mixed with wax, which makes its surface superhydrophobic. In microfluidics, superhydrophobicity {{is an important factor in}} the rheometers on a chip. It is also sought in other complex fluids applications like the self-cleaning and the antibacterial materials. The wettability of the surface of solid support can be modified by altering its chemical composition. This means functionalizing the interface molecules to different chemical properties, and/or forming a thin film on the surface. We can also influence its texturing by changing its roughness. Despite considerable efforts during the last decade, superhydrophobic surfaces usually involve, among others, microfabrication processes, such as photolithography technique. In this study, we propose an original and simple method to create superhydrophobic surfaces by controlling elastic instability of poly-dimethylsiloxane (PDMS) films. Indeed, we demonstrate that the self-organization of <b>wrinkles</b> on <b>top</b> of non-wettable polymer surfaces leads to surperhydrophobic surfaces with contact angles exceeding 150 °. We studied the transition Wenzel-Cassie, which indicated that the passage of morphology drops “impaled” to a type of morphology “fakir” were the strongest topographies...|$|R

The higher {{temperature}} {{was used to}} ensure that the templated surface was fully replicated into the surface of the PC substrate while the lower {{temperature was}} used {{to ensure that the}} templated surface of the PC substrate was retained. The resulting mechanical resonator is shown in Figure 3 a. Note that this device exhibits <b>wrinkles</b> in the <b>top</b> layer Au/PC membrane. Such features result from the compressive strain built up within the Au membrane due to the differential thermal expansion between the Au and PC materials. Figure 3 b shows a similar device where the Au membrane was deposited near room temperature in an e-beam evaporator rather than transfer printed at 130 °C. Note that the device containing the directly deposited Au film has notable fewer wrinkles than the device containing the printed Au film.|$|R
5000|$|Caron, Scheltema, et al. (2006) had {{suggested}} that the <b>wrinkles</b> on the <b>top</b> surfaces of Odontogriphus specimens were caused by the rippling contractions of a mollusc-like muscular foot. Butterfield disputed this on the grounds that: a molluscan foot is also mainly composed of cellular material, which he thought unlikely to be fossilized in Burgess Shale conditions; the wrinkles were too straight and ran too precisely across the animals' bodies; the gaps between them were {{the same size as}} the gaps between the gill-like structures round the foot. Instead he argued that they were evidence of externally visible segmentation, which is found in polychaetes but not in molluscs. He concluded that Wiwaxia was an evolutionary [...] "aunt" [...] of polychaetes, while Odontogriphus could be an evolutionary [...] "aunt" [...] of polychaetes or of molluscs or of brachiopods - or even a [...] "great aunt" [...] of all three, as it could have been an early member of the lophotrochozoa, a [...] "super-phylum" [...] that includes the polychaetes, molluscs and brachiopods.|$|R

He was precise about only two things--motor-timing and calling himself a [...] "mechanician," [...] not a [...] "mechanic." [...] He became very friendly with Hank Odell; helped him repair his broken machine, went with him to vaudeville, or stood with him before the hangar, watching the automobile parties of pretty girls with lordly chaperons that came to call on Grahame-White and Drexel.
