5|$|The 1948 Major League Baseball {{season was}} {{predicted}} to {{be a close}} race between the Yankees and Red Sox. In a United Press poll conducted just before the season started, the majority of sportswriters chose the Yankees, who had <b>won</b> <b>last</b> year's World Series, to face the Braves or St. Louis Cardinals that year, while others chose the Red Sox; only one sportswriter chose the Indians to reach the World Series. Most of the American League managers had the Yankees finishing first, followed by the Red Sox, Indians, and Detroit Tigers. Tension and confidence was evident between the teams, as two months into the season, after defeating the Red Sox 7–0, Yankees manager Bucky Harris declared that the Yankees would win the pennant, though they were currently at second place at the time.|$|E

Two goals from Matthew Etherington, however, helped West Ham to a 3–0 victory, as Reading's defence continued to struggle.

500|$|In 2005, Lost was {{nominated}} for twelve Primetime Emmy Awards and won six, including Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series for series co-creator J. J. Abrams and four Emmys for the pilot episode. The series also won Outstanding Drama Series, which was considered a surprise win because the Emmys had rarely recognized science fiction or fantasy programs in the category. The following year, the series {{was nominated}} for nine Emmys, but failed to win any. Despite winning for Outstanding Drama Series the previous year, Lost was not nominated in the category in 2006. This was referenced in host Conan O'Brien's opening segment for the 58th Primetime Emmy Awards where he lands on a beach and discovers Jorge Garcia. O'Brien jumps into a hatch and invites Garcia to come along to the ceremony, but Garcia says [...] "we weren't exactly invited," [...] to which O'Brien responds: [...] "but you <b>won</b> <b>last</b> year, nothing makes sense anymore!" [...] In 2007, the series {{was nominated for}} six Emmys, but again failed to gain a nomination for Outstanding Drama Series. Terry O'Quinn became the first Lost actor to win an Emmy Award, picking up the trophy for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series for his performance as John Locke in [...] "The Man from Tallahassee". In 2008, the series gained eight nominations, of which six were Creative Arts Emmy Awards, and won for Outstanding Sound Mixing for a Comedy or Drama Series (One-Hour). In 2009, the series received six nominations and won two. Michael Emerson became the second actor from Lost to win the award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series for his performance as Ben Linus in [...] "Dead Is Dead". The website DharmaWantsYou.com won a special award for Outstanding Creative Achievement in Interactive Media – Fiction. In 2010, the sixth and final season of Lost received thirteen nominations, including a fourth Outstanding Drama Series nomination, which it lost to the third season of Mad Men as in the two previous years.

2500|$|After the 2006 coup, the {{military}} junta appointed {{a committee to}} investigate the anti-drug campaign. Former Attorney General Kanit Na Nakorn led the committee. Concerning the committee's results The Economist reported in January 2008: [...] "Over half of those killed in 2003 had no links to the drugs trade. The panel blamed the violence on a government 'shoot-to-kill' policy based on flawed blacklists. But far from leading to the prosecutions of those involved, its findings have been buried. The outgoing interim prime minister, Surayud Chulanont, took office vowing to right Mr Thaksin's wrongs. Yet this week {{he said there was}} insufficient evidence to take legal action over the killings. It is easy to see why the tide has turned. Sunai Phasuk, a researcher for Human Rights Watch, a lobbying group, says that the panel's original report named the politicians who egged on the gunmen. But after the PPP <b>won</b> <b>last</b> month's elections, those names were omitted." ...|$|E
2500|$|Voters {{were split}} {{as to who}} won the first presidential debate. Bush {{improved}} in the second debate. Before the second debate, Dukakis had been suffering from the flu and {{spent much of the}} day in bed. His performance was poor and played to his reputation as being intellectually cold. Reporter Bernard Shaw asked Dukakis whether he would support the death penalty if his wife were raped and murdered; Dukakis's answer discussed the statistical ineffectiveness of capital punishment. Several commentators thought the question itself was unfair, in that it injected an irrelevant emotional element into the discussion of a policy issue, but many observers felt Dukakis's answer lacked the normal emotions one would expect of a person asked about a loved one's rape and death. Tom Brokaw of NBC reported on his October 14 newscast, [...] "The consensus tonight is that Vice President George Bush <b>won</b> <b>last</b> night's debate and made it all the harder for Governor Michael Dukakis to catch and pass him in the 25 days remaining. In all of the Friday morning quarterbacking, there was common agreement that Dukakis failed to seize the debate and make it his night." ...|$|E

2500|$|The 88 riders of the 5th {{edition of}} the Ladies Tour of Qatar took off this {{in front of the}} Museum of Islamic Arts in Doha. Facing the wind, the pack {{remained}} bunched {{during the first half of}} the stage. The packed bunch covered 36.8 kilometres in the first hour. As the wind started blowing sideways on the pack, several riders failed to keep up with the pace. At km 55, twenty young ladies powered away while former World champion Giorgia Bronzini was left stranded behind. At km 65 the front group could enjoy a 27” lead. The gap started growing as the kilometres went by: 55" [...] on the Bronzini group and 1’45" [...] on the main pack at km 70, and then 2’ with 15 kilometres to go. At km 85, three riders managed to break away: Chloe Hosking, Gracie Elvin and Lisa Brennauer. They were soon to be caught by Liesbet De Vocht. The four escapees managed to stay put all the way to the finish line in Masaieed. Used to battling it out in bunched sprints, Hosking powered to her first stage success in Qatar, outsprinting Elvin and Brennauer to the line. The Aussie captures the overall lead and the first Golden jersey of this edition.
