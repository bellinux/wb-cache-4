40|$|In {{the present}} thesis, the {{influence}} of different prevention techniques on the bloodserum-calcium-concentration post-partum was tested on a dairy farm with 1950 Holstein-Friesian-Cows in milk. The objective was to find ways for further reducing the incidence of parturient paresis and subclinical hypocalcemia in the future {{in addition to the}} <b>working</b> <b>feeding</b> of anionic salts in the dry period. For this purpose, blood was taken every two hours from 291 cows, including ten heifers, in the first 24 hours post-partum and the serum-calcium-concentration was determined. The cows were separated into three large groups: Different lactation numbers, different administrations of calcium or variation in the frequency of milk withdrawal and oral administration of a drench with calcium. The lactation number showed a significant influence, whereas the serum-calcium-concentration declined with increasing age. The oral administration of a calcium bolus is not necessary for animals of the first and second lactation. An effect could not statistically be proven for cows of the third and older lactations. The infusion of calciumborogluconate {{turned out to be the}} only administration of calcium that could elevate the mean serum-calcium-concentration into the physiological range for a longer period of time. The administration of a bolus as well as dosing of a calcium containing drench did not show a statistically provable increase of the serum-calcium-concentration compared to cows that had not been given calcium. The variation in the amount and frequency of milk withdrawal post-partum did not result in any differences between the groups and therefore cannot be recommended. A statistically proven decline in the serum-calcium-concentration of 0, 05 mmol/l caused by milk withdrawal could be shown after the third milking post-partum. More precise predications require further investigations with blood samples being taken several minutes before and after milk withdrawal. The intramuscular injection of 15 million IU Vitamin D 3 seven days before the estimated calving date showed a highly significant influence on cows of the fifth and older lactations. The injection resulted in serum-calcium-concentrations which were on average in the physiological range for 24 hours post-partum whereas the cows without an administration of Vitamin D 3 were hypocalcemic. The combination of feeding anionic salts in the late dry perioid and the injection of Vitamin D 3 should be further investigated regarding the point in time of the injection, dosing and side effects. Feeding anionic salts in the late dry period proved to be very effective. Whether and if the incidence of parturient paresis currently still can be reduced should be verified in further investigations...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Electrospinning is {{a popular}} {{technique}} for producing micro- or nanofibers for diverse applications including filtration, catalysis, sensors, cosmetics, wound dressing and tissue engineering.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} pressure-swing-adsorption (PSA) {{experiments}} for removing CO 2 and CH 4 from a mixture with an ‘inert' such as hydrogen or helium. Specific features are quasi cyclic steady-state and no breakthrough of the adsorbed impurity during the adsorption-production step, implying that information {{has to be}} taken inside the column, here by a set of temperature measurements. The purpose is to propose an approach for evaluating the effect on the behaviour and performance of different <b>working</b> conditions (<b>feed</b> composition, temperature, conditions of regeneration, adsorbent) under conditions of optimal bed length. We define a new criterion to represent the effective sorption capacity required in adsorption, which we call critical bed fraction (CBF), defined as the fraction of bed length occupied by the temperature and concentration fronts at incipient breakthrough of the less adsorbed component, at cyclic steady-state. The effects of the different parameters on performance (recovery and productivity) may then be expressed and analysed in terms of CBF. Some noteworthy observations are the following: for a given amount of purge, the flow velocity in the purge step may have an optimal value; a relatively high concentration of CH 4 may have positive effects on both recovery and productivity when used with a high purge velocity, because it contributes to a better desorption of CO 2; the advantages of an adsorbent having a high capacity per unit mass and fast internal kinetics may be offset if the density is low, implying a low capacity per unit volume...|$|R

40|$|The {{structural}} {{advantages of}} parallel kinematic mechanisms for highly dynamic motions are undisputed. The mass values {{to be moved}} are essentially determined by {{the structure of the}} end effector platform. The accuracy of machines with parallel kinematic drive concepts is decisively defined by the joint and feed unit assemblies. Statical (except in hexapods) and dynamical bending and torsional loads limit the shape of the strut geometry. As a rule, an increase in volume to enhance stiffness at the same times results in an increase in weight and thus worse dynamic characteristics. Active compensation and damping elements provide an alternative to passively increasing stiffness by geometries fitted to load. An active compensation of torsion is aimed at achieving a high "virtual" torsional stiffness of the whole drive unit by means of a compensation drive which is based on piezoelectric actuators. The compensation drive works autonomously and measures and corrects the appear ing torsional deformation in a self-controlled manner, independent of the end effector platform's position in the <b>working</b> space adjusting <b>feed</b> units...|$|R
