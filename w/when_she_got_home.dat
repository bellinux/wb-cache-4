2500|$|Arfwedson {{found it}} [...] "absolutely exhausting" [...] {{to portray the}} condition. She {{admitted}} {{it was hard to}} get out of character because <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>home</b> she would be learning lines for the following day. To avoid feeling manic herself, she would socialise, meditate and do yoga to forget about Zosia. The storyline had positive outcomes for viewers. People with the condition contacted the actress to credit her portrayal with saving their lives. Arfwedson said she found it [...] "quite moving" [...] to think she was making a difference in real life.|$|E
60|$|The mystery was solved <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>home</b> {{and found}} a letter from Edith {{awaiting}} her.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{probably}} from the children's uncle," [...] she said excitedly, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>home.</b> [...] "Oh, Marilla, I {{wonder what he}} says about them." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> back <b>home</b> <b>she</b> {{unwrapped}} her {{packages and}} showed her purchases to Louisa. But Louisa neither looked at them nor spoke to Mary Isabel. Mary Isabel tossed her head and went to her own room. Her draught of freedom had stimulated her, {{and she did not}} mind Louisa's attitude half as much as she would have expected. She read Tom's letter over again to fortify herself and then she dressed her hair in a fashion she had seen that day in town and pulled out all the little curls on her forehead.|$|R
50|$|White Marsh {{remained}} at Leyte until 14 July <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> underway for <b>home.</b> <b>She</b> stopped at Eniwetok on 21 July, loaded cargo and passengers, resumed her voyage, {{and arrived at}} Oahu on 29 July. She remained there only overnight and, the next day, got underway for the West Coast. The ship reached San Francisco on 29 July and was receiving repairs there when Japan capitulated in mid-August.|$|R
60|$|The fat pony jogged {{over the}} bridge in Lynde's Hollow and along the Green Gables lane. Marilla's face was rather grim. It was ten miles from East Grafton and Davy Keith seemed to be possessed {{with a passion for}} {{perpetual}} motion. It was beyond Marilla's power to make him sit still and she had been in an agony the whole way lest he fall {{over the back of the}} wagon and break his neck, or tumble over the dashboard under the pony's heels. In despair she finally threatened to whip him soundly <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> him <b>home.</b> Whereupon Davy climbed into her lap, regardless of the reins, flung his chubby arms about her neck and gave her a bear-like hug.|$|R
60|$|A {{very new}} basket phaeton stood {{glittering}} at Annie's door <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>home,</b> and Mrs. Wilmington {{put her head}} out of the open parlour window.|$|E
60|$|Nothing moved Anne in the least. Her {{mind was}} made up. She {{would not go}} to school to Mr. Phillips again; she told Marilla so <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>home.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I hope he {{was none}} {{the worse for}} it," [...] said the {{sporting}} character who had been telling Staveley just now how she had cried <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>home</b> that night.|$|E
50|$|On 26 November, the {{salvage tug}} arrived in Subic Bay but {{remained}} only until the 30th <b>when</b> <b>she</b> embarked upon a voyage which {{took her to}} Thailand and Singapore. Beaufort returned to Subic Bay on 2 January 1981. She operated out of that port until 6 April <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> underway for <b>home.</b> The ship stopped at Guam on 12 April but continued her voyage east on the 13th. Beaufort reentered Pearl Harbor on 28 April and remained there until 8 June <b>when</b> <b>she</b> resumed operations in the Hawaiian Islands.|$|R
5000|$|Her work {{is mostly}} autobiographical, {{strongly}} influenced by figurative art [...] Her work still contains some Japanese aesthetic despite living in Mexico for over twenty years. Her creativity is introverted. She relates a story that <b>when</b> <b>she</b> was a child, she would take stones {{from the bottom of}} a river, which shined as they were wet. However, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> them <b>home,</b> they would be dry and less attractive. She has found the same effect with words, profound as she thinks them but less important once said. It is also the reason she paint self-portraits, keeping an element of the internal. One of these was painted just after the 2011 Japan earthquake to capture her feelings about the disaster. [...] Watabeâ€™s works often speak of pain and melancholy, but also with an element of strength. She states her aim is that with enthusiasm and love we can continue against difficulties. However, her work has also included flowers and women who are magical and related to flowers in some way, using rich colors.|$|R
6000|$|When Erlcort once noted his {{interest}} in the fact to a floor-walker whom he happened to find at leisure, the floor-walker said, Yes, that was so; and the house did it because it was business, good business, the only good business. He was instantly enthusiastic, and he said that just in the same way, as an extension of its good faith with the public, the house had established the rule of taking back any article which a customer did not like, or did not find what <b>she</b> had supposed <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> it <b>home,</b> and refunding the money. This was the best sort of business; it held custom; the woman became a customer for life. The floor-walker laughed, and after he had told an anxious applicant, [...] "Second aisle to the left, lady; three counters back," [...] he concluded to Erlcort, [...] "I say she because a man never brings a thing back when he's made a mistake; but a woman can always blame it on the house. That so?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>home</b> she was hurried up {{at once to}} her mother's room,--and {{there she}} found her father, alone. 'This is your game, is it?' said he, looking down at her.|$|E
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>home,</b> {{she found}} Mary Bold in the drawing-room {{with the child}} in her lap. She rushed forward and, {{throwing}} herself on her knees, kissed the little fellow till she almost frightened him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Huldy was a gal of spirit, and she despised the talk, but it {{made her}} drefful uncomfortable; and <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>home</b> at night she {{sat down in the}} mor-nin'-glory porch, quite quiet, and didn't sing a word.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Corey smiled wanly. Thirty years before, she {{had married}} the rich young painter in Rome, who said so much better things than he painted--charming things, just the things to please the fancy of {{a girl who was}} {{disposed}} to take life a little too seriously and practically. She saw him in a different light <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> him <b>home</b> to Boston; but he had kept on saying the charming things, and he had not done much else. In fact, he had fulfilled the promise of his youth. It was a good trait in him that he was not actively but only passively extravagant. He was not adventurous with his money; his tastes were as simple as an Italian's; he had no expensive habits. In the process of time he had grown to lead a more and more secluded life. It was hard to get him out anywhere, even to dinner. His patience with their narrowing circumstances had a pathos which she felt the more the more she came into charge of their joint life. At times it seemed too bad that the children and their education and pleasures should cost so much. She knew, besides, that {{if it had not been}} for them she would have gone back to Rome with him, and lived princely there for less than it took to live respectably in Boston.|$|R
6000|$|... "--By the wind, sir--that it's a mercy <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>home</b> at all. Oh dear, yes. Yes. It {{was by the}} wind, Mr. Redlaw. By the wind." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The Pretty Poll! <b>She</b> <b>got</b> <b>home</b> safe, was sold, {{and is now}} in the West-India trade. There is a {{handsome}} balance, amounting to some fourteen hundred dollars, in the owners' hands, coming to you from prize-money and wages." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>home</b> to her lodgings {{that evening}} she {{reflected}} {{with something like}} surprise upon her half-day's employment, and decided that it showed nothing more nor less than that Capes was a really very interesting person indeed.|$|E
60|$|Poor Mrs. Bold, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>home</b> from Ullathorne on {{the evening}} of Miss Thorne's party, was very unhappy and, moreover, very tired. Nothing {{fatigues}} the body so much as weariness of spirit, and Eleanor's spirit was indeed weary.|$|E
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>home</b> {{she ran to}} {{seek out}} her godmother, and, after having thanked her, {{she said she could}} not but heartily wish she might go next day to the ball, because the King's son had desired her.|$|E
60|$|So Polly {{made her}} moan, {{and by the}} time <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>home,</b> was just in the mood to go to bed and cry herself to sleep, as girls have a way of doing when their small affliction becomes unbearable.|$|R
50|$|Susan Burdett was a 39-year-old {{accounts}} clerk {{who lived}} alone in Papatoetoe and enjoyed ten pin bowling. On 23 March 1992 she went bowling at the Manukau Superstrike. After <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>home,</b> <b>she</b> had {{a shower and}} was then raped and battered {{to death with a}} softball bat. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> was found, the softball bat, which she kept for her own protection, was found lying on the bed beside her.|$|R
50|$|She {{knew nothing}} about this. Her {{dismissal}} was held in 1841. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> it, <b>she</b> fainted.|$|R
6000|$|And <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>home</b> she {{was obliged}} {{to say to her}} daughter, [...] "I am not well, my dear; I must go and lie down. Attend to your papa. Leave me in quiet. I shall take no dinner." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{tell your}} mother you've been sick," [...] he said. There {{was no need to}} ask that. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>home,</b> the child crept away under the parlour sofa, like a sick little animal, and was a long time before she crawled out.|$|E
60|$|Polly, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>home</b> again, went {{straight}} to the library, and told papa of her visit to Harmer Place, and its results, and how nearly she had been to the recovery of the will. Papa looked thoughtful over it for some time.|$|E

60|$|And <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> well Carl {{noticed that}} she was {{brighter}} and happier than she had been before.|$|R
50|$|Fowler's wife petitioned {{for divorce}} <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> {{to know of}} Jensen. Subsequently Fowler got a girlfriend from Scotland.|$|R
60|$|Then Thakane dried her eyes, and gladly {{accepted}} the old woman's offer. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>home</b> {{she told her}} husband she had thrown it in the river, and as he had watched her go in that direction he never thought of doubting what she said.|$|E
60|$|As usual, {{there was}} no answer in the looking-glass <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>home</b> and {{referred}} these questions to it. Perhaps if she had consulted some better oracle, the result might have been more satisfactory; but she did not, and all things consequent marched the march before them.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked at}} her watch. Fortunately it was still early. She {{would be able to}} let herself in before anyone was up. It was but a little way. She wondered, while rearranging her hair, what day it was. She would find out, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>home,</b> from the newspaper.|$|E
60|$|ASHER. You say that, when Germany {{intended}} {{to come over}} here and crush us, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> through with the Allies.|$|R
60|$|Her temper was not {{improved}} by seeing Mr. Hardy {{sitting in the}} dark over a good fire <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> downstairs.|$|R
60|$|She {{added the}} latter clause of inquiry, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> downstairs, {{and found him}} seated in the shaving-chair, pale and disconsolate.|$|R
