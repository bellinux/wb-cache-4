500|$|Within {{hours of}} the article's publication, UVA {{president}} Teresa Sullivan had called the governor's {{chief of staff and}} the Charlottesville police chief to start preparing a response. She said her initial reaction was surprise and [...] "a certain air of disbelief" [...] because during her 44-minute interview for the story, Erdely never brought up Jackie or asked about any of the allegations made in the article. Sullivan said: [...] "I was plainly not prepared for <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> looked like. Nor do I think her characterization of my interview was fair." ...|$|E
500|$|Colbert, a {{historian}} and former head writer {{on the television}} quiz show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?, {{became interested in the}} books and bought the first novel in the series, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, to see <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> was about. As he was reading, he began to notice mythological references in the book. He commented: [...] "I almost laughed out loud when I came across the three-headed dog [...] I instantly knew it was a reference to Cerberus, the threeheaded beast which Ancient Greeks believed guarded the gates to the Underworld." [...] Inspired by this, Colbert continued to search the book for more references and noticed that most characters' names are based on their personality and every magic creature is a reference to mythology and folklore.|$|E
500|$|Initially, {{everything}} {{regarding the}} sequel was uncertain at first: [...] whether stars Tom Hanks and Tim Allen {{would be available}} and affordable, <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> premise would be, and even whether the film would be computer-animated at Pixar or traditionally at Walt Disney Feature Animation. Lasseter regarded the project {{as a chance to}} groom new directing talent, as top choices were already immersed in other projects (Andrew Stanton in A Bug's Life and Pete Docter in early development work for a film that would eventually become Monsters, Inc.). [...] Instead, Lasseter turned to Ash Brannon, a young directing animator on Toy Story whose work he admired. [...] Brannon, a CalArts graduate, joined the Toy Story team in 1993. Disney and Pixar officially announced the sequel in a press release on March 12, 1997.|$|E

500|$|In 2006, John Lasseter {{spoke about}} the {{inspiration}} for the film, saying: [...] "I have always loved cars. In one vein, I have Disney blood, and in the other, there's motor oil. The notion of combining these two great passions in my life—cars and animation—was irresistible. When Joe (Ranft) and I first started talking about this film in 1998, we knew we wanted to do something with cars as characters. Around that same time, we watched a documentary called 'Divided Highways,' which dealt with the interstate highway and how it affected the small towns along the way. We were so moved by it and began thinking about what it must have been like in these small towns that got bypassed. That's when we started really researching Route 66, but we still hadn't quite figured out <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> for the film was going to be. I used to travel that highway with my family as a child when we visited our family in St. Louis." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} {{chose to}} film in Atlanta {{because of its}} proximity to Cynthiana, Kentucky, Kirkman's hometown and the setting of his comic's first issue. [...] "At the beginning they talk about how {{some of the people}} in neighboring states would have gone to larger cities so they could fortify them and protect the population." [...] Kirkman had considered other cities, particularly New York City, Miami, and Chicago. Hurd had previously filmed in the city for Lifetime. Darabont felt that Atlanta offered the essentials; [...] "Atlanta and Georgia all-told is proving to be brilliant for us in terms of what it has to offer, in terms of <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> needed, in terms of the variety of locations—it really is a fantastic place to shoot." [...] Prior to filming, Kirkman toured with Darabont around the central business district. He stated, [...] "I tagged along on a location-scouting expedition, and that was pretty fun—watching Frank Darabont walking through the streets of Atlanta as if he owned the entire city, daring cars to hit him. That was a lot of fun." [...] Darabont ventured onto the middle of a street to grasp a perfect shot, oblivious to oncoming traffic.|$|E
500|$|In March 2006, {{when the}} {{structural}} {{part of the}} narrative started to come together, lead scenario writer Daisuke Watanabe joined the team. Toriyama gave him a rough outline of the first eight chapters, which included several cornerstone scenes {{that needed to be}} kept, like when party members were separated or reunited. He told Watanabe what he wanted to express with the scenario, and asked him to flesh out the story and to strengthen how the points in his outline connected. For example, Toriyama's rudimentary instructions in the document would say [...] "Snow and Hope reconcile". Watanabe had to decide about how the scenes with this reconciliation would play out, then write the scenario that way. To emphasize <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> tried to express, Watanabe adjusted the personalities Toriyama had given to each character. For example, he felt that the party should not have a [...] "reliable and calm leader type" [...] {{at the beginning of the}} story, in order to more accurately show the confusion and unease after the protagonists transform into l'Cie. Toriyama has said that one of the storytelling challenges was the despair of the characters and the many points at which they are seemingly cornered. He mentioned the scene where Sazh tries to commit suicide as one such example: Although Toriyama felt it was [...] "almost a little too dark", he wanted to include something like it in the game. In contrast, he said that lighthearted elements such as Sazh's Chocobo chick helped maintain a good balance.|$|E

500|$|Kaze of Beneath The Tangles, however, {{disagreed}} with these interpretations of koi {{and the notion}} that the story was a [...] "bittersweet romance" [...] or [...] "another love story", and instead felt that the theme was unrecognized. Focusing instead on the human need for companionship and understanding, Kaze noted that both Takao and Yukari lacked meaningful connections with their peers and friends, a view shared by reviewer Bradly Storm at Hardcore Gamer. Together through their conversations—in their [...] "garden of words"—they found companionship: Takao finding someone he can share his passion with, and Yukari finding someone who treats her as a person. However, because of the age difference, this discovery varied between the characters. For Yukari, an older and more experienced individual, her hopeless feelings of lonely sadness disappeared when she learned she could connect with Takao, a revelation that she saw as her salvation. For Takao, a boy with an unsupportive family and friends who seemed more like acquaintances, he did not realize his lack of companionship until he discovered it with Yukari, a new feeling he mistook for romantic love but only realized its true nature after she had moved away. According to Kaze, [...] "romantic love could potentially bloom from such feelings, but that is not <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> is about". Instead, the love they shared was more basic, making the age difference immaterial. At the end of film, both characters maintained their friendship through letters, but otherwise began growing as people by moving on with their lives and presumably finding new relationships with other people. The hope was that one day they could reunite and renew their companionship [...] "without needing to cling to each other". However, neither could [...] "learn to walk again" [...] if they continued to isolate themselves {{from the rest of the}} world and take shelter with each other in the garden at Shinjuku Gyoen.|$|E

Allen arrived in Toronto later and met Tremblay, [...] "But we didn’t want him to become too familiar with me because that’s not <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> is." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1997, Rafter won the US Open, {{a tournament}} that many {{expected}} Sampras to win, having won in 1995 and 1996. The win catapulted Rafter to the year-end no. 2 rankings behind Sampras. Seven-time Grand Slam champion John McEnroe believed Rafter to be a [...] "one-slam wonder", {{since it was}} only his second career ATP title. Up to that point, Sampras was 5-1 against Rafter, and defeated Rafter three times in fall 1997 to solidify his No. 1 ATP ranking. [...] "We're not the best of mates," [...] Rafter said of Sampras after 1997 Davis Cup semifinals, [...] "I wouldn't {{go out for a}} beer with him, put it that way.

2500|$|The novel {{has three}} beginnings, {{two of them}} illusory: {{the first is the}} wedding {{preparation}} in London, the second the heroine's return to Helstone and the third (often considered the real start of the story) narrates the departure for Milton in chapter seven. The first chapters, according to Martin Dodsworth, are false leads of what the novel is about rather than the author's clumsiness; they tell the reader <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> is not about. Bodenheimer (p.283) interprets the early chapters not as false starts but as demonstrating Gaskell's theme of societal and personal [...] "permanent state(s) of change" [...] and integral to the novel. The early chapters in different places have been interpreted as presenting a theme of mobility. In moving {{from one place to another}} Margaret better understands herself and the world, advancing Gaskell's intention to place her in the public sphere.|$|E

2500|$|Filming was {{originally}} planned {{to begin in}} the third quarter of 2004 but the filmmakers had trouble finding the right actor to play the protagonist Grenouille. The search to find an actor to play Grenouille took nearly a year. On casting agent Michelle Guish's advice, Tykwer went to see Ben Whishaw perform as Hamlet in Trevor Nunn's production of the play. Tykwer immediately felt that he had found the actor for the role. An audition followed which convinced Eichinger of Whishaw's potential as well. Eichinger described Whishaw as embodying both [...] "the innocent angel and the murderer." [...] Regarding his search to find an actor, Tykwer said [...] "it only really seemed plausible to choose someone for this role who was completely unknown. You could also say a 'nobody' who is to become a 'somebody' - because that's <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> is about too." ...|$|E
2500|$|Brief vignettes {{featuring}} McKinney and McCulloch {{as a pair}} of Toronto {{city police}} officers, usually standing beside their squad car, making banal small-talk while rarely doing actual police work. One such sketch featured McKinney describing a homicide and police chase in technical detail, but it is revealed that he's describing a movie he saw (rather than an actual homicide), and has no idea <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> is with the actual dead body the two cops are standing over. The characters originated in the full-length sketch [...] "On the Run", in which the two cops try to pursue a group of escaped convicts without looking conspicuous. According to DVD commentary, McKinney and McCulloch, during a break in shooting that particular sketch, began to improvise several short scenes revolving around those two characters for fun; some of their improvisations were incorporated into the show, and proved so popular they became a fixture. The duo have the distinction of being the show's most frequently used recurring characters; they were also carried over into Brain Candy and Death Comes to Town.|$|E
2500|$|In 2007, artist Matt Haley and Twin Peaks {{producer}} Bob Engels {{began work}} on a graphic novel continuation of the series, {{to be included in}} the [...] "Complete Mystery" [...] DVD box set. Haley stated: [...] "Bob and I had a number of discussions about <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> would be, I was keen to use whatever notes they had for the proposed third season. I really wanted this to be a literal 'third season' of the show. Bob told me they really wanted to get away from the high school setting, so after the resolution of the Cooper-BOB-possession plot point, they would have cut to something like 'Ten Years Later', and then shown us a Twin Peaks where Cooper had quit the FBI and had become the town pharmacist, Sheriff Truman had become a recluse, etc. He also mentioned they were going to have Sheryl Lee come back, this time as a redhead, and probably have her character killed by BOB again. There were also some vague ideas about BOB and Mike being from a planet made of creamed corn, something about Truman driving Mike backwards through the portal into the Black Lodge (which I think would have been a really nice cinematic scene)." [...] Lynch vetoed the project, stating that he respected the effort but did not want to continue the story of Twin Peaks in any way.|$|E
