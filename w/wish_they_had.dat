500|$|Interviewed by G4TV, Bungie representatives saw part of {{the mixed}} and {{negative}} reception as stemming from their own marketing of the title—first as an expansion pack, then a full game. [...] "If {{you look at the}} lower scores, they almost all cite an issue in perceived value based on an initial expectation that was set for an 'expansion' and then a feeling that they were overcharged for the final product," [...] Jarrad said, echoing Staten's comment that [...] "if we'd never said the words 'expansion pack' we would have seen an appreciable increase in the review scores". Other elements they <b>wish</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> improved had they the time were the pacing and navigation of the nighttime segments and matchmaking for Firefight. Halo manager 343 Industries director Frank O'Connor said that he was glad ODST [...] "didn't take off", in his view, because it allowed people to focus on Reach and its launch and marketing.|$|E
2500|$|Asked {{if he had}} any regrets, he said: [...] "If I {{had seen}} the banking crisis coming. Nobody advised me, no economist, all those people now writing books saying 'I told you so' – none of them." [...] On Anglo Irish Bank, he said: [...] "I can {{honestly}} say that not once did anyone or any delegation that came in to see me ever say, ‘Watch out for Anglo’ ... I <b>wish</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> have." [...] Referring to the [...] "great economic storm" [...] currently under way in Ireland, he warned against excessive pessimism: [...] "Some gains have been lost, but in truth many remain. I dearly wish there was no crisis. I realise {{that it would have been}} better if some things had been done differently, but I will not denigrate the good that has been done," [...] he added.|$|E
2500|$|According {{to a story}} often {{featured}} in publications by the West Virginia National Guard, when Hugh Stephenson’s and Daniel Morgan’s Independent Companies of Virginia Riflemen arrived in Boston shortly after {{the outbreak of the}} Revolutionary War, General Washington rode out to meet them, dismounted, took every man by his hand, and proclaimed “Let me plant my banner in West Augusta and I will surround it with fighting men who will drive the invaders from our land.” [...] However, David McCullough presents a somewhat different reaction to the mountain men, based upon accounts by a Boston physician named James Thacher. [...] To quote McCullough, “Welcome as they were at first, the riflemen soon proved even more indifferent to discipline than the New Englanders, and obstreperous to the point that Washington began to <b>wish</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> never come.” [...] Present-day members of the 201st Field Artillery are doubtless equally proud of both of these descriptions of their comrades from an earlier era.|$|E

2500|$|Richard Roeper of Chicago Sun-Times {{awarded the}} film {{three and a}} half stars, {{pointing}} out the CGI as the apex achievement of the film. He labelled it [...] "a beautifully rendered, visually arresting take on Rudyard Kipling's oft-filmed tales" [...] but found the musical numbers to be trivial, saying that without the musical numbers, the film might have been a more exhilarating streamlined adventure. Los Angeles Times Kenneth Turan remarked that [...] "The Jungle Book is the kind of family film calculated to make even those without families <b>wish</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> one to take along." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone awarded the film {{three and a half}} stars out of four, labeling it scary and thrilling, yet unique and unforgettable, and adding that it [...] "fills us with something rare in movies today — a sense of wonder." [...] The Village Voices Bilge Ebiri hailed the film as fast and light and that it [...] "manages to be just scary enough to make us feel the danger of solitude {{in the middle of a}} massive jungle, but never indulgent or gratuitous." [...] The New York Times Manohla Dargis was less enthusiastic. Cath Clarke of Time Out compared Elba's character of Shere Khan to Scar from The Lion King, calling him [...] "baddie of the year." [...] Matt Zoller Seitz of RogerEbert.com also had high praise for Elba's portrayal of Shere Khan stating: [...] "His loping menace is envisioned so powerfully that he'd be scary no matter what, but the character becomes a great villain through imaginative empathy. We understand and appreciate his point-of-view, even though carrying it out would mean the death of Mowgli." ...|$|E
