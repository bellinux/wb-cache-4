The kingdom of the evil Diamond King, or Hirok Raj, is an allusion to India during Indira Gandhi's emergency period.

5|$|Survivor Series <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>culmination</b> <b>of</b> various scripted {{plots and}} storylines.

Raw, SmackDown!, and ECW were also the names of WWE's televised brands– a storyline division in which WWE assigned its employees to a specific program, thus each brand promoted distinct matches.|$|E

5|$|Just {{over one}} gram of {{berkelium}} has been {{produced in the}} United States since 1967. There is no practical application of berkelium outside scientific research which is mostly directed at the synthesis of heavier transuranic elements and transactinides. A 22milligram batch of berkelium-249 was prepared during a 250-day irradiation period and then purified for a further 90 days at Oak Ridge in 2009. This sample was used to synthesize the new element tennessine {{for the first time}} in 2009 at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research, Russia, after it was bombarded with calcium-48 ions for 150 days. This <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>culmination</b> <b>of</b> the Russia–US collaboration on the synthesis of the heaviest elements on the periodic table.|$|E

The Re Umberto class <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>culmination</b> <b>of</b> {{the first phase}} of the program, which saw ten modern ironclad battleships built; these ships placed Italy with the third largest navy, after Great Britain and France. The three Re Umbertos were designed by Benedetto Brin, then the president of the Committee for Naval Projects. The first two ships were authorized in 1883, and in 1885 Brin, who was now the naval minister, proposed a third vessel.|$|E

The aircraft {{was intended to be}} built directly from the production line, skipping the traditional hand-built prototype phase. The first Arrow Mk. I, RL-201, was rolled out to the public on 4 October 1957, the same day as the launch of Sputnik I.|$|E

An arbitrator ruled in favor of the Flyers on June 30, 1992.|$|E
5|$|The Siege of Sidney Street of January 1911, {{also known}} as the Battle of Stepney, was a gunfight in the East End of London between a {{combined}} police and army force and two Latvian revolutionaries.

5|$|The {{discovery}} of the AdS/CFT correspondence in late 1997 <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>culmination</b> <b>of</b> {{a long history of}} efforts to relate string theory to nuclear physics. In fact, string theory was originally developed during the late 1960s and early 1970s as a theory of hadrons, the subatomic particles like the proton and neutron that are held together by the strong nuclear force. The idea was that each of these particles could be viewed as a different oscillation mode of a string. In the late 1960s, experimentalists had found that hadrons fall into families called Regge trajectories with squared energy proportional to angular momentum, and theorists showed that this relationship emerges naturally from the physics of a rotating relativistic string.|$|E

5|$|From 1992 to 1995 Reinfeldt was the {{chairman}} of the Moderate Youth League. He ousted the former chairman Ulf Kristersson at the controversial congress known as the Battle of Lycksele, securing 58 of the delegates' votes where Kristersson gained only 55. The congress was controversial because it <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>culmination</b> <b>of</b> a long ideological battle within the Moderate Youth League between the conservatives and the libertarians; Reinfeldt represented the conservatives and Kristersson the libertarians. Reinfeldt later stated that although the effects of that deep ideological division and battle in the party lingered on within the Moderate Youth League, he also felt that it was a defining moment in his life. Had he lost the battle he would most likely not be in politics today. From 1995 to 1997 he was chairman of the Democrat Youth Community of Europe.|$|E
5|$|Harclay's most {{prominent}} achievement {{came with the}} Battle of Boroughbridge in 1322. The battle <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>culmination</b> <b>of</b> an ongoing struggle between King Edward II and his most powerful earl, Thomas of Lancaster. The conflict stemmed from disagreement over {{the handling of the}} war with Scotland; Lancaster, and many others, found the king's war effort lacking. After failing to incite an insurrection against the king, Lancaster was in March 1322 fleeing northwards from the royal army. Meanwhile, Harclay, as sheriff of Cumberland, was ordered by the king to levy the forces of the northern counties of Cumberland and Westmorland, and move south. His orders were to meet up with the royal army, but while stopping at the town of Ripon in Yorkshire, he received intelligence that Lancaster would arrive at nearby Boroughbridge the next day. Harclay decided to take the initiative, and occupy the bridge that would prevent Lancaster's passage across the River Ure.|$|E
5|$|Some {{scholars}} have specifically compared baptism with the Isiac initiation described by Apuleius. Before the early fourth century CE, baptism <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>culmination</b> <b>of</b> a long process, {{in which the}} convert to Christianity fasted for the forty days of Lent before being immersed at Easter in a cistern or natural body of water. Like the mysteries of Isis, then, early Christian baptism involved a days-long fast and a washing ritual. Both fasting and washing were common types of ritual purification found in the religions of the Mediterranean, and Christian baptism was specifically derived from the baptism of Jesus and Jewish immersion rituals. Therefore, according to Hugh Bowden, these similarities come from the shared religious background of Christianity and the Isis cult, not from the influence of one tradition upon the other.|$|E
