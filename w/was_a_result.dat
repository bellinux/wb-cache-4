5|$|A riot {{occurred}} here on August 1, 1877, {{in which}} armed citizens fired upon strikers, killing four. Many were injured, including Scranton's mayor.

50|$|Water {{crisis in}} Iran {{refers to the}} {{problems}} which due to the water scarcity occur in Iran. Water scarcity can <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> of two mechanisms: physical (absolute) water scarcity and economic water scarcity, where physical water scarcity <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> of inadequate natural water resources to supply a region's demand, and economic water scarcity <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> of poor management of the sufficient available water resources. Iran is encountered to both problems.|$|R
5|$|Conflict {{among the}} Christian {{population}} of Neapolis emerged in 451. By this time, Neapolis {{was within the}} Palaestina Prima province {{under the rule of}} the Byzantine Empire.

However, the conflict did not grow into civil strife.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} part of life in Upper Canada, local {{administration}} and justice was administered by the colonial government. From 1792 to 1841, magistrates were appointed by District Councils. There were four districts in the colony of which Scarborough was part of the Home District. Partly due to a political reorganization that <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> of the Durham Report, Scarborough gained elected representation on the Home District Council. Scarborough elected two councillors.|$|E
5|$|During {{the time}} of the earthquake, others {{believed}} that the destruction <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> of an underground nuclear explosion. Igor Nesterov, head of seismology of USSR, said the Leninakan seismic station was destroyed so there was no way of knowing whether it received reports of an earthquake coming its way, although Nesterovs' colleagues later said the station was not able to receive reports {{because of the lack of}} instruments it carried.|$|E

5|$|Eastern and red wolves {{are also}} {{products}} of {{varying degrees of}} wolf-coyote hybridization. The eastern wolf probably <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> of a wolf-coyote admixture, combined with extensive backcrossing with parent gray wolf populations. The red wolf may have originated {{during a time of}} declining wolf populations in the southeastern United States, forcing a wolf-coyote hybridization as well as backcrossing with local parent coyote populations to the extent that about 75–80% of the modern red wolf's genome is of coyote derivation.|$|E
5|$|Going {{into the}} 2010 state elections, the Minnesota {{government}} faced an approximately $5 billion budget shortfall {{in the coming}} 2011–2013 biennium, {{left over from the}} outgoing administration of Republican Governor Tim Pawlenty. The Republican Party claimed that the shortfall <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> of unsustainable increases in spending, and pledged to balance the budget without raising taxes. In the gubernatorial election, former U.S. Senator Mark Dayton campaigned pledging to close the budget deficit by increasing income taxes on the state's highest earners.|$|E

5|$|In 1887, English mycologists Miles Joseph Berkeley and Christopher Edmund Broome {{described}} {{a species of}} fungus they named Tympanis toomansis, collected from dead infructescences ("cones") of Banksia growing {{on the banks of}} the Tooma River in southern New South Wales, Australia. Its generic placement <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> of its resemblance to Tympanis, a genus in the family Helotiaceae of the Ascomycota.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, Compton {{was awarded}} {{one of the}} first two National Research Council Fellowships that allowed {{students}} to study abroad. He chose to go to Cambridge University's Cavendish Laboratory in England, where he studied the scattering and absorption of gamma rays. Further research along these lines led to the discovery of the Compton effect. He used X-rays to investigate ferromagnetism, concluding that it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> of the alignment of electron spins, and studied cosmic rays, discovering that they were made up principally of positively charged particles.|$|E

40|$|This thesis has {{identified}} the incentives {{for the growth}} of the commercial strip along State Road 109 in Anderson, Indiana. The thesis through a case study of the historical development of the commercial strip established the following findings. First, the commercial strip occurred as <b>a</b> <b>result</b> of increasing urban evolution. Second, the commercial strip occurred as <b>a</b> <b>result</b> of land speculation. Third, the commercial strip <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> of the commercial zoning and rezoning patterns. Fourth, the commercial strip occurred as <b>a</b> <b>result</b> of increased regional accessibility. Fifth, the commercial strip <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> of increased land values. Finally, the commercial strip <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> of commercial linkages. Department of Urban PlanningThesis (M. U. R. P. ...|$|R
