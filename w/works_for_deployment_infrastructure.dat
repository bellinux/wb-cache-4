However, when the <b>deployment</b> of <b>infrastructure</b> <b>for</b> roads and air travel is further constrained, the GDP loss is less than with a fixed carbon emission trajectory only.

40|$|A location-aware scheme uses {{a priori}} {{knowledge}} of the deployed sensor nodes of some target field in a sensor network. Such location-aware schemes improve substantially higher network connectivity and resilience against node captures if the deployment error between the actual and expected locations of the deployed sensor nodes is smaller. The ideas of using pre-deployment and post-deployment knowledges for the key pre-distribution techniques in a sensor network are two mutually orthogonal techniques. Therefore, it may be desirable to combine them together to provide better performances. In this paper, we propose a scheme which takes advantages of both pre-deployment and post-deployment knowledges of the deployed sensor nodes in a sensor network. Our scheme significantly improves the performance of establishing pairwise keys between neighbor sensor nodes than the existing previous key pre-distribution schemes. Moreover, it provides a better trade-off among network connectivity, communication overhead, computational overhead, storage requirement and security against node capture than the existing schemes.

Grid middleware, which {{is meant to}} enable access to grid resources, is currently widely seen as being too heavyweight and, in consequence, unwieldy for general scientific use. Its heavyweight nature, especially on the client-side, has severely restricted the uptake of grid technology by computational scientists. In this paper, we describe the Application Hosting Environment (AHE) which we have developed {{to address some of}} these problems. The AHE is a lightweight, easily deployable environment designed to allow the scientist to quickly and easily run legacy applications on distributed grid resources. It provides a higher level abstraction of a grid than is offered by existing grid middleware schemes such as the Globus Toolkit. As a result the computational scientist does not need to know the details of any particular underlying grid middleware and is isolated from any changes to it on the distributed resources. The functionality provided by the AHE is `application-centric': applications are exposed as web services with a well-defined standards-compliant interface. This allows the computational scientist to start and manage application instances on a grid in a transparent manner, thus greatly simplifying the user experience.
