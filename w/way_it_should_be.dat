500|$|The Book of Lucifer {{contains}} a long chapter titled [...] "Satanic Sex", discussing Satanism's view on sexual activity {{as well as}} misconceptions surrounding these views. He denies the belief that sex {{is the most important}} element in LaVeyan Satanism, and that participation in orgies or other promiscuous behavior is forced. He explains that sexual freedom is encouraged, but only in the sense that believers should be free to explore their own sexualities as they please, without harming others. Along with the rumors regarding Satanic views on sex, LaVey also addresses those about animal and human sacrifice. He explains that the only time a LaVeyan Satanist would perform a human sacrifice would be to accomplish two goals: to [...] "release the magician's wrath" [...] as he or she performed a curse, and to kill someone who deserved to die. He considers the action of hurting another person a request to be destroyed, and explains that the Satanist is morally required to grant this request {{in the form of a}} curse. LaVey also says that a Satanist would never sacrifice a baby or an animal, as they are pure carnal beings and considered to be sacred. In The Book of Lucifer, LaVey outlines LaVeyan Satanism's views on death. He explains that one who has lived a full life will dread death, and that this is the <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be.</b> He also does not agree with the idea of reincarnation. He encourages a strong will to live, comparing it to animals' instincts to fight viciously for their lives. Suicide is discouraged except in cases of euthanasia, where it would end extreme suffering. Because the Satanist is considered his or her own god, birthdays are celebrated as the most important holidays. Following one's birthday in importance are Walpurgisnacht and Halloween. Solstices and equinoxes are also celebrated.|$|E

6000|$|He {{was more}} {{surprised}} even {{than at the}} revelation of the scale on which Mr. Loder was ready to proceed by the discovery {{that some of the}} actors didn't like their parts, and his heart sank as he asked himself what he could possibly do with them {{if they were going to}} be so stupid. This was the first of his disappointments; somehow he had expected every individual to become instantly and gratefully conscious of a rare opportunity, and from the moment such a calculation failed he was at sea, or mindful at any rate that more disappointments would come. It was impossible to make out what the manager liked or disliked; no judgment, no comment escaped him; his acceptance of the play and his views about the <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> mounted had apparently converted him into a veiled and shrouded figure. Wayworth was able to grasp the idea that they would all move now in a higher and sharper air than that of compliment and confidence. When he talked with Violet Grey after the reading he gathered that she was really rather crude: what better proof of it could there be than her failure to break out instantly with an expression of delight about her great chance? This reserve, however, had evidently nothing to do with high pretensions; she had no wish to make him feel that a person of her eminence was superior to easy raptures. He guessed, after a little, that she was puzzled and even somewhat frightened--to a certain extent she had not understood. Nothing could appeal to him more than the opportunity to clear up her difficulties, in the course of the examination of which he quickly discovered that, so far as she HAD understood, she had understood wrong. If she was crude it was only a reason the more for talking to her; he kept saying to her [...] "Ask me--ask me: ask me everything you can think of." ...|$|E

40|$|AIDS is a fatal disease {{which is}} at present incurable. It is spread mainly through extra-marital {{heterosexual}} and homosexual intercourse. The distinctive feature of AIDS is that it destroys the immunity system of the human body. The victim subsequently dies of any common disease. At present AIDS is spreading extremely rapidly: world-wide, {{the number of people}} contracting the disease is doubled every ten months. The most important ways in which AIDS is contracted and spread, can be ascribed to sinful actions and ways of living, because these patterns of conduct are forbidden by God. Firstly, this means that if sexual intercourse were practised within lawful matrimony according to God's will, AIDS would not be a threat of any significance. Secondly, it means that people contracting AIDS through a promiscuous lifestyle, should see the disease as a punishment of God. In those instances where AIDS is contracted in other <b>ways,</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> regarded as a sore trial. AIDS sufferers <b>should</b> not <b>be</b> stigmatised or ostracised, but <b>should</b> <b>be</b> actively supported and helped, especially by the churches. The way in which Christians behave towards sufferers of AIDS should reflect the compassion and charity of Christ towards sinners...|$|R
40|$|Book synopsis: Dying {{and death}} are topics of deep humane concern {{for many people}} {{in a variety of}} {{circumstances}} and contexts.

The present volume is an attempt to bridge the undesirable gap between what <b>should</b> <b>be</b> known and understood about dying and death and what is easily accessible. Included in the present volume are chapters arranged in three sections. First, there are chapters on aspects of dying, written by people who have professional experience and personal insights into the nature of the processes at work and the <b>ways</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> treated. Secondly, there are chapters on assisted death (Euthanasia) that illuminate the practices involved in the professional assistance given to persons who suffer from an incurable illness and who do not want their painful life to be medically extended. Thirdly, there are chapters on mourning, examined in a variety of cultural contexts. These provide insights for different ways of maintaining the presence of the dead {{in the life of the}} living: “life in the hearts”...|$|R
