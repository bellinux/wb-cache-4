40|$|Abstract: Wool used in {{this study}} was {{collected}} from Falahi sheep after shearing and from Falahi hides after unhairing process by both chemical and enzymatic treatments. The underlying study investigates the possibility of increasing the percent of <b>pulled</b> <b>wool</b> via blending with wool. Unhairing process using enzyme treatment not only considered as environmentally friendly but also gives better <b>pulled</b> <b>wool</b> compared with chemical one. As much as we increase <b>pulled</b> <b>wool</b> in the blend, the profit tended to increase while yarn strength and yarn regularity tended to decrease. <b>Pulled</b> <b>wool</b> percentage is reasonable at 25 %, risky at 50 % and not favorable at 75 %. Yarns from <b>pulled</b> <b>wool</b> is preferable to use in hand made fabric, which needs 100 % wool and low yarn quality compared with mechanical textile. Chemical unhairing treatment significantly decrease the wool content of amino acids, sulfur content as sulfur ion and as sulfur amino acid (Methionine), as well as some physical properties like staple and yarn strength, yarn elongation and yarn regularity expressed by increasing number of fine and thick places as well as number of nodes.

Moreover, Mr. Tiernan, even in his morning greetings as she passed, always contrived to convey to her, in some unaccountable fashion, the admiration and regard in which he held her, and the effect of her contact with him was invariably to give her a certain objective image of herself, an increased self-confidence and self-respect.

Dalgety depended on the woolgrowers. Soon after F G Dalgety went into business on his own account Australia's sheep numbers had reached around 20 million. Thirty years later there were more than 100 million but by 1903 by prolonged drought flocks had almost halved and numbers did not come back to 100 million until 1926. By that time UK took about 50 per cent of Australia's total wool exports. UK demand rose during the Second World War but as the war ended it was found the UK government held 10.4 million bales. In conjunction with officials from Australia New Zealand and South Africa a joint arrangement was made in 1945 to ensure its orderly sale and the sale was completed in 1951. Later the same year American demand generated by the outbreak of the Korean War <b>pulled</b> <b>wool</b> prices up to nine times the UK contract price of five years earlier but the following year Australia's returns from wool were halved.Wool prices continued to fall but bottomed in 1971 when there were a record 180 million sheep, the sheep numbers to some extent compensating for low wool prices. Price stabilisation schemes were organised with Australian government support. That support was withdrawn in 1999.|$|R

5000|$|The {{process of}} sedentarization is first {{thought to have}} {{occurred}} around 12,000 BCE in the Levant region of southwest Asia though other regions around the world soon followed. The emergence of civilization is generally associated with the Neolithic, or Agricultural Revolution, which occurred in various locations between 8,000 and 5,000 BCE, specifically in southwestern/southern Asia, northern/central Africa and Central America. At first, the Neolithic was associated with shifting subsistence cultivation, where continuous farming led to the depletion of soil fertility resulting in the requirement to cultivate fields further and further removed from the settlement, eventually compelling the settlement itself to move. In major semi-arid river valleys, annual flooding renewed soil fertility every year, {{with the result that}} population densities could rise significantly. This encouraged a secondary products revolution in which people used domesticated animals not just for meat, but also for milk, <b>wool,</b> manure and <b>pulling</b> ploughs and carts—a development that spread through the Eurasian Oecumene. The 8.2 Kiloyear Arid Event and the 5.9 Kiloyear Interpluvial saw the drying out of semiarid regions and a major spread of deserts. [...] This climate change shifted the cost-benefit ratio of endemic violence between communities, which saw the abandonment of unwalled village communities and the appearance of walled cities, associated with the first civilizations. This [...] "urban revolution" [...] {{marked the beginning of the}} accumulation of transferrable surpluses, which helped economies and cities develop. It was associated with the state monopoly of violence, the appearance of a soldier class and endemic warfare, rapid development of hierarchies, the appearance of human sacrifice and a fall in the status of women.|$|R
40|$|After {{years in}} the waiting, Google has finally {{struck a deal with}} the European Commission {{regarding}} alleged abuses of its dominant position in online search and advertising in the European Union. The Commission opened its investigation into Google more than three years ago. It has been a long saga and the Commission has rebuffed Google’s two previous offers and sent them back to the drawing board. The deal This deal means that Google will change what European users see on its search results page. Whenever Google promotes its own services in these results – such as for travel, entertainment and shopping – it will also display results from three of a pool of eligible competitors. These results will be selected through an “objective” method and will be displayed clearly to users, like how Google displays its own services. This is more than Google offered before, which was to label results from its own services and put a frame around them on the screen and display alternatives from three rivals. In the new deal the results form competitors must be selected “objectively” and displayed in a similar way to Google’s own services. This might mean that Google has to give equal prominence on its results page to those from rivals services as it gives to its own. At the moment though it is not clear exactly how Google will go about making these changes, or indeed how the results from rivals will be selected “objectively”. Consessions so far The Commission and Google have already agreed on other steps Google must take to deal with concerns over its behaviour. Content providers such as online newspapers can opt-out from the use of their content in Google’s specialised search services such as Google News. They are still able to opt-in to their content appearing in Google’s general search results. Google will also remove any exclusivity requirements in its advertising contracts and restrictions on search advertising campaigns being run on other platforms. As a result of the deal, Google will not have to pay what could have been an enormous multi-billion dollar fine to the Commission and will also escape an official finding of wrongdoing. Google’s secret algorithm Perhaps an even bigger victory for Google is that it will also not have to reveal to the public any more information about how its secretive algorithm works. However, if the results of three of its rivals must be selected in an “objective” way, this might require passing on some information about how the algorithm works to the independent monitoring trustee who will make sure Google keeps to its side of the deal for the next five years. But Google’s competitors are not happy with this result. They have been asked for feedback on the deal but it is unlikely anything they say now will change its content. The Initiative for a Competitive Online Marketplace (ICOMP), an umbrella group of competitors, said that without a stronger “market test” of the deal by third parties such as themselves, the Commission’s head of competiton Joaqin Almunia “risks having the <b>wool</b> <b>pulled</b> over his eyes by Google”. But Almunia has said that his mission, including in the Google case, is to protect competition for the benefit of European consumers, not competitors. He seems to think that the deal strikes the right balance between allowing Google to improve its services and giving users a “real choice between competing services presented in a comparable way”. This presentation of different options should give users the choice as to what one they think is best. Search results in future How Google presents its search results and whether consumers understand the differences between the different parts of the results page has also been an issue in Australia. In a case decided last year, the High Court found that a hypothetical reasonable user would understand the difference between Google’s sponsored links and organic i. e. unpaid search results. But the High Court did not point to any evidence of actual Australian Google users and how they understood different parts of the results page. Let us hope here that the European Commission has actually looked at how real European users understand Google’s results page before it struck the deal. Outside Europe We still have to see what effect the latest deal may have on Google’s business operations in places outside of Europe. The deal is only binding within the EU, but Google might find it efficient to change its search results page in the same way for other places, such as Australia. A similar investigation into Google in the US ended in the Federal Trade Commission there finding that Google had not behaved anticompetitively and so was not forced to make any changes to how it displayed its search results Overall, {{it will be interesting to}} see what effect this deal might have on Google’s 93 % market share in Europe last month, and how consumers will respond to the changes.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} interrogates {{the process}} of culture change and continuity among the 19 th century Khoesan in the Karoo who were the descendants of precolonial hunter-gatherer and pastoralist populations. It looks at how local Karoo dwellers experienced and possibly mediated global impacts through 'older' cultural practice and belief. These impacts started in the 18 th century in the Northern Cape when the trickle of Trek Boers of Dutch and German descent began to interact with, displace and disrupt San hunter-gatherers and Khoe pastoralists. This trickle turned into a torrent in the 19 th century when the British displaced the Dutch East India company as administrators of the Cape and Empire asserted itself on the Cape hinterlands. In this context new creole identities were formed, especially that of 'Bastaards' whose attempt to adapt, progress and particularly to own land, were progressively marginalized. This intensified through from the 1830 s when merino <b>wool</b> production increasingly <b>pulled</b> the Cape into a global export economy that was intensified by the rush to the Northern Cape diamond fields in the late 1860 s. As the lattice of colonial roads, towns and railways gathered pace, the networks and nodes of Khoe and San dwelling withered. Most often classified as 'coloured', they were reduced to physical and social immobility as rural farm workers. This dissertation addresses aspects of this experience using their engraved rock art that is thematically dominated by the materiality of a colonial landscape. Horses, wagons, houses, steam engines and clothes are prominent motifs. At a glance these images seem to be disconnected from the precolonial styles and motifs of Khoekhoen and San artists. This dissertation, consequently, asks questions {{about the nature of}} this representation and the dislocation between the marginality and poverty of the artists and the material abundance and progress of the colonial world and the evidence of continuity of 'older' social practice that was expressed in new ways. It is argued that because of the diverse context of the 19 th century and the undoubted continuity of Khoesan belief and practice, some of these images cannot be taken at face value and that they should be seen as creole expressions and continuities of Khoesan beliefs. Equally, however, there are aspects of these representations that are difficult to read in this way, and engravers are expressing the immediacy of their context and material marginality...|$|R
