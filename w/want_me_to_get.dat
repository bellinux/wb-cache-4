Carson {{explained}} that [...] "Liverpool <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> some experience and then hopefully I can go back next season and be challenging Pepe [...] for the number one spot.

Although he was unable to prevent Charlton from being relegated at the end of 2006–07, his outstanding form led him to be named as the Charlton Athletic Player of the Year, the first loan player ever to receive the award.|$|E

40|$|My first {{semester}} pursuing my MFA in Voice and Speech Pedagogy I vocal-coached an openly gay student playing a straight character who would mask his sexual identity {{in such a}} manner that his performance became stiff and uninteresting.

I confronted the student and suggested such extreme vocal suppression diminished the quality of his overall performance. He replied, 2 ̆ 2 So you <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the gay out. 2 ̆ 2 His use of the phrase, 2 ̆ 2 get the gay out 2 ̆ 2 to describe a fuller adaptation of his sexual identity to suit the character fascinated me and led to me to create a performance seminar course that used open acknowledgment of Camp performance styles as a valuable way to prepare students, gay or straight, for careers on the stage and screen.

40|$|Busy dance halls, {{exploding}} bottles, {{back room}} exchanges, and car chases: the Prohibition Era was doused with excitement. In rural Cache County, Utah, {{in the thick}} of prohibition years, a thirsty customer cautiously entered the rural residence of a known illegal brewer. The seller firmly shook his client’s hand and calmly took his order. When the customer ordered some simple beer, the brewer sent his son to fetch some bottles. The son, after heading upstairs, poked his head back down, and asked his father, “Dad…do you <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the beer out of the crock that the cat got drowned in or the other?” With a nervous laugh, and a side glance at the customer, the father suggested the clean beer. Like the rest of the nation, Cache County residents lived with and lived through this colorful era. This paper explores the experiences of Cache Valley residents during the years of prohibition: what happened, citizens’ reactions, and the meaning prohibition held for these rural, nominally conservative individuals. With a large concentration of members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons), one might expect a fairly tranquil experience in the valley, but the reality was more complex than that. This paper compares Cache Valley citizens’ experiences moonshining, bootlegging, drinking, dancing, and outwitting law enforcement to the illicit activities throughout the State of Utah and the nation...|$|E

You write the best letters. Had a sorta fight with Ginny today and was feeling rather gloomy but when I read your letter, I felt all happy again. Ginny 2 ̆ 6 I are going to come to blows pretty soon. I’m looking for another job now 2 ̆ 6 if I can find {{something}} half way decent, I’ll leave but quickly. Rosemary 2 ̆ 6 I are both looking for another job—I hate to have an arguement [sic] with anyone. Today’s Wednesday 2 ̆ 6 there are only three more days til you’ll be home again. Golly I miss you so much. It does seem months since last Sunday. Yes, I got to bed early Sunday. That’s more than you can say—so there! Do you get much sleep? This weekend we’d better just for a change be wide awake 2 ̆ 6 stop yawning. (Johnny Mercer is playing “You 2 ̆ 6 Your Love”—You should hear it sometime). We had a few snow flakes Monday but nothing exciting. It made me laugh because you had said it had to snow or do something different. What was it like to fly in the snow? I’m very proud of your being able to save 4. 38 by March. You’re really thrifty—(Now he’s playing “Always”—How true). Well, the way things look now I probably will have about two dollars saved by next Christmas—If I get that fur coat especially. What are these “pretty-good-ideas-on-how-to-raise-money ideas” of yours? Well, I was talking to some people about the cost of diamonds 2 ̆ 6 they’re practically an arm 2 ̆ 6 a leg now. Tomorrow I’m going to find out for myself. Going down to Macy’s to look. They’re supposed to have very good junk because they’re all marked 2 ̆ 6 checked by officials or something so that people won’t get gyped [sic]. Daddy can get most jewelery [sic] wholesale 2 ̆ 6 if he could do that it would be wonderful because there probably wouldn’t be a tax on it if he got it. No, honey, there’s {{no doubt in my mind}} at all. And I’ve decided not to try to talk myself out of anything 2 ̆ 6 to just be happy 2 ̆ 6 not worry about anything. When it happens—anything—then maybe I’ll worry about it but not ‘til then. I hope that you can remember all the things we’re going to have a long talk about because there are millions of things that I’ve already forgotten. Yes, we’ve told daddy. He doesn’t <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> married til the war’s over but if I want to he won’t stand in the way. Besides, even if he didn’t approve I’d do it anyway. Once my mind’s made up it’s pretty hard to change it. Anyway nothing anyone could say about waiting would bother me. If you want to get married in March, we’ll get married in March. Honey, I love you and miss you so much. Just finished dinner 2 ̆ 6 daddy said that he could get rings wholesale. That would be neat. He says they’re about 200 or 250 plus tax. Sinatra’s on now. He’s singing “There Goes That Song Again. ” That reminds me of last Saturday when Henry James played it. Golly so many things happened last Saturday. Golly, there are so many things we have to get settled, honey. I have a fairly good idea of what I’ll have to do between now 2 ̆ 6 March. There are only 38 more shopping days to Christmas. This is going to be some Christmas. Hon, what should I do about telling that fellow? Again that reminds me—Have you been able to get Woody a date for this Saturday? She is so neat. I don’t know what I’d do without her now. She’s been helping me plan stuff. We have more plans. To get back to the subject—I hate to write him but that’s the only way. I guess because if he ever went overseas before I told him it would be awful. Guess writing is the only way. Darling, this Saturday seems so far off. They keep adding extra days in some place during the week. It will be wonderful to be with you again. Maybe we could slow down the clock or something. Time really flies on those weekends. Guess that Gilly 2 ̆ 6 I won’t go to the Pelham-Pleasantville game because we can’t find anyone who’s going. Well, honey, please write soon again. I love you. All my love,Dottie P. S. Please don’t forget about getting Woody a date, honey. Oh, Sinatra is at the Waldorf Astoria or someplace. Maybe we could go there sometime, huh? Where do you want to have the reception? Where did your sisters have theirs? Golly, there are so many questions that I want to ask you. We’re going to have to talk awfully fast to get everything said this weekend. Have you told any of the cadets, yet? So far I’ve only told two girls, of course. I’m practically going crazy but until it’s official or announced anyway, they’re the only ones who’ll know. There are going to be a heck of a lot of people who will be surprised. I’d love to hear what people will say. That would be fun, but I don’t especially care what anyone thinks. Wonder what Don or Bill would say. I’ll bet they won’t believe it. I’d love to see the expression on their faces when they hear about it. Well, honey, goodbye again. I love you 2 ̆ 6 wish that weekends lasted months at a time. Where do you think that you’ll be sent after you get your commission?[Transcription ends...|$|E
