5|$|Although {{tickets for}} the Masters are not expensive, they are very {{difficult}} to come by. Even the practice rounds can be difficult to get into. Applications for practice round tickets have to be made nearly a year in advance and the successful applicants are chosen by random ballot. Tickets to the actual tournament are sold only to members of a patrons list, which is closed. A <b>waiting</b> <b>list</b> <b>for</b> the patrons list was opened in 1972 and closed in 1978. It was reopened in 2000 and subsequently closed once again. In 2008, the Masters also began allowing children (between the ages of 8 and 16) to enter on tournament days free if they are accompanied by the patron who is the owner of his or her badge.|$|E

5|$|This {{increase}} in population caused many adverse effects. Municipal Utilities Service, which operated telephone service, {{ran out of}} phone numbers and the <b>waiting</b> <b>list</b> <b>for</b> phone connections stretched to 1,500 entries. Electric demand was so high that the power company advised homeowners to buy generators to cope with frequent brownouts. Home prices skyrocketed—a home that sold for $40,000 in 1974 was purchased for $80,000 in 1975. Home and apartment rentals were correspondingly squeezed upward by the rising prices and the demand from pipeline workers. Two-room log cabins with no plumbing rented for $500 per month. One two-bedroom home housed 45 pipeline workers who shared beds on a rotating schedule for $40 per week.|$|E

40|$|<b>Waiting</b> <b>lists</b> <b>for</b> {{elective}} surgery {{are considered a}} major health policy concern in most countries of the world. The most common reason to explain this phenomenon is that demand exceeds supply. Traditionally, the management of <b>waiting</b> <b>lists</b> {{has been focused on}} timeliness of medical attention. The objective {{of this paper is to}} present a <b>waiting</b> <b>lists</b> management model that includes the concepts of timeliness and justice simultaneously. We designed a prioritization method based solely on medical criteria. We developed a computer software to register patients, to prioritize and monitor the <b>waiting</b> <b>lists.</b> The system was implemented in 2013 and is currently used in all surgical specialties at a public hospital. The results show that timeliness does not suffice to manage the <b>waiting</b> <b>lists</b> <b>for</b> {{elective surgery}}, and therefore it should be complemented with an indicator of justice. Under this management model, hospitals should attempt to balance justice with timeliness of care and prioritize initiatives that improve both indicators at the same time. In addition, we propose using this model to manage the <b>waiting</b> <b>lists</b> of other hospital processes...|$|R
