5|$|Phil England {{writes in}} The Ecologist that the {{strength}} of the book is the rigour of the research and the detailed focus on key incidents. He said, however, that the climate change chapter is only 50 pages long, and recommends several other books for readers who <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> broader picture of this aspect: Jim Hoggan’s Climate Cover-Up, George Monbiot’s Heat: How to Stop the Planet Burning and Ross Gelbspan’s The Heat is On and Boiling Point. England also said that there is little coverage about the millions of dollars which Exxon Mobil has put into funding groups actively involved in promoting climate change denial and doubt.|$|E
25|$|Before 54 BC her {{stepfather}} arranged {{for her to}} marry Gaius Claudius Marcellus Minor. Marcellus {{was a man of}} consular rank, a man who was considered worthy of her and was consul in 50 BC. He was {{also a member of the}} influential Claudian family and descended from Marcus Claudius Marcellus, a famous general in the Second Punic War. In 54 BC, her great uncle Caesar is said to have been anxious for her to divorce her husband so that she could marry Pompey who had just lost his wife Julia (Julius Caesar's daughter, and thus Octavia's cousin once removed). The couple did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> divorce so instead Pompey declined the proposal and married Cornelia Metella. So Octavia's husband continued to oppose Julius Caesar including in the crucial year of his consulship 50 BC. Civil war broke out when Caesar in Gaul invaded Italy in 49 BC.|$|E
25|$|Well, it's {{not really}} a choice at all. It's just, you know, I started playing very young and from early on, the people I was {{listening}} to had some element of finger style. Probably the first guitarist I was emulating was Scotty Moore, when I was maybe 6 or 7. And he played with a pick, but he also used fingers. And {{a lot of the}} session players, like Chet Atkins, they played with fingers or a pick. Then I listened to a certain amount of light classical guitar playing. And of course later on, when the first wave of rock 'n' roll kind of fell away, folk music was very popular and very influential in my style. So it was really less of a choice than what I fell into. I use a pick occasionally. I certainly use it more in the studio when you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> certain tone. But it's just the way I came up. I wasn't taught. I just sort of figured things out on my own terms. I guess {{that was one of the}} ways that I became comfortable and it just kind of set in.|$|E

500|$|Paul {{built the}} members a cabana style house on his pool deck with air conditioning, a TV, and beds so the members felt {{comfortable}} while recording. Paul produced {{the record and}} Gray felt Paul [...] "facilitated the whole thing". The album was completed in roughly a month, with three recording sessions. The band worked on the record for eight days and returned home for a break. A 14-day session, followed the break and then another 10 days in the studio. Gray asserts the breaks in between recording sessions were to [...] "re charge the batteries", and [...] "get a fresh head". As the line-up was complete, the band started to brainstorm names. When a member thought of a name they would write it {{on a piece of}} paper and put it in an amp box outside the studio. Someone wrote [...] "Hellyeah", and the band thought it was a perfect choice. Paul says it's [...] "very affirmative and full of attitude. When your buddy asks if you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> beer tonight, you don't just say 'yes,' you say, [...] "Hell yeah!". Gray attributes the name to [...] "late teens, keggers and chicks and AC/DC and Metallica".|$|E

This pro-verb, unlike the above-described pro-verbs, {{can be used in}} any {{grammatical}} context; however, in contexts where another pro-verb could be used, it can be overly formal.

500|$|The {{developers}} {{originally planned}} {{to add a}} feature that would allow players to craft weapons, but the idea was ultimately discarded. According to Hope, [...] "We thought about what people {{would want to do}} in order to survive. We explored different ideas, and one of them was fashioning weapons to defend yourself. That was quite early on, but then we realised that this game isn't really about pulling the trigger." [...] Another cancelled feature was the alien's iconic acid blood as a game mechanic, which could melt through metal like in the film. Although the feature was implemented at one point, it was eventually removed from the game because the developers felt it would change the course of the game in a [...] "weird" [...] direction. In addition, the developers considered the possibility for the game to be played from a third-person perspective, but then realised that it would significantly change the experience. Hope explained that it would become [...] "a game about jockeying the camera and looking after your avatar. But in first-person it's you that's being hunted. If you're hiding behind an object and you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> better view of your surroundings, you have to move." [...] The actual development of the game took overall four years to complete after the Creative Assembly first pitched the idea to Sega. The game went gold on 9 September 2014 and is dedicated to Simon Franco, a programmer of the game, who died during its development.|$|E
500|$|Rendering lead Jessica McMackin {{spoke about}} the use of ray tracing on the film, saying: [...] "In {{addition}} to creating accurate reflections, we used ray tracing to achieve other effects. We were able to use this approach to create accurate shadows, like when there are multiple light sources and you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> feathering of shadows at the edges. Or occlusion, which is the absence of ambient light between two surfaces, like a crease in a shirt. A fourth use is irradiance. An example of this would be if you had a piece of red paper and held it up to a white wall, the light would be colored by the paper and cast a red glow on the wall." [...] Character supervisor Tim Milliron explained that the film uses a ground–locking system that kept the cars firmly planted on the road, saying: [...] "The ground-locking system {{is one of the things}} I’m most proud of on this film. In the past, characters have never known about their environment in any way. A simulation pass was required if you wanted to make something like that happen. On Cars, this system is built into the models themselves, and as you move the car around, the vehicle sticks to the ground. It was one of those things that we do at Pixar where we knew going in that it had to be done, but we had no idea how to do it." ...|$|E

[...] "He Needs a Kidney", the charity song {{featured}} in this episode, was written by show composer and co-executive producer Jeff Richmond. Richmond is married to series creator, executive producer and lead actress Tina Fey. In discussion {{of the development of}} [...] "Kidney Now!", Richmond said that Carlock and Fey [...] "were trying {{to figure out a way}} to highlight Jack's dad in getting a kidney and how they're going to deal with that", and that the two came to the decision to [...] "take advantage of the singing", as they have done so in the past with different 30 Rock episodes, in which the show's characters have sung songs. Carlock and Fey agreed to the idea that a song be included in the season finale, but that it be an anthem like the 1985 charity song, [...] "We Are the World", [...] as the cause is that the Milton Greene character is in need of a kidney donor. [...] "Basically, the parameters were if 'We Are the World' but they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> kidney. I think we had angles that everyone has two kidneys and you'll only need one kidney, and we thought 'Alright, we'll get some distance on that'", said Richmond. While working on the track, Fey suggested to Richmond that he incorporate Milton Greene's name in one part of the song, which he did, as this was sung by singers Cyndi Lauper and Robert Randolph.|$|E

This eventually happened in July '68 when the Iveys became the first band to be signed to the label. Some of the first Apple recording sessions were produced by Mal and the band eventually changed their name to Badfinger. Evans: [...] "January 13, 1969: Paul [...] is really cutting down on the Apple staff members. I was elevated to office boy [...] and I feel very hurt and sad inside—only big boys don't cry.
