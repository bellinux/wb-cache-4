5|$|The <b>Walk</b> <b>of</b> Fame {{was first}} {{conceived}} in 1996 when co-founder Peter Soumalias, suggested {{the idea of}} a <b>Walk</b> <b>of</b> Fame for famous Torontonians to the board of the Toronto Entertainment District Association. They rejected his idea, but he went on to establish a <b>Walk</b> <b>of</b> Fame for Canadians in partnership with Bill Ballard, Dusty Cohl and Gary Slaight. In spite of a lack of funds, research and no media plan, the first class of inductees was inducted in 1998. Canada's <b>Walk</b> <b>of</b> Fame has become a popular tourist attraction in Toronto and has been named the number one Canadian recognition event.|$|E

40|$|The {{extremely}} fascinating behaviors <b>of</b> {{the quantum}} <b>walks</b> <b>of</b> particles, which differ {{much from the}} classical counterparts, have attracted many physicists. Here we investigate another interesting part <b>of</b> the quantum <b>walks,</b> that is the quantum <b>walks</b> <b>of</b> waves. Firstly, we show the behaviors <b>of</b> the quantum <b>walks</b> <b>of</b> plane wave, which are largely different from the counterparts of either the classical or the quantum <b>walks</b> <b>of</b> particles. Two situations - with and without intermediate time measurements <b>of</b> the <b>walks</b> are considered. At last, it is shown that the quantum <b>walks</b> <b>of</b> plane wave {{can be used to}} calculate the evolution of the general wave packets, e. g., Gaussian wave packet.

2500|$|Bonacich {{showed that}} if {{association}} {{is defined in}} terms <b>of</b> <b>walks,</b> then a family of centralities can be defined based on the length <b>of</b> <b>walk</b> considered. The degree counts <b>walks</b> <b>of</b> length one, the eigenvalue centrality counts <b>walks</b> <b>of</b> length infinity. Alternate definitions of association are also reasonable. The alpha centrality allows vertices to have an external source of influence. Estrada's subgraph centrality proposes only counting closed paths (triangles, squares, ...).|$|R
