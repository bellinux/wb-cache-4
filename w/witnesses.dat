50|$|The {{less the}} <b>witness</b> says, and the slower the <b>witness</b> speaks, the more control they can {{maintain}} {{under the pressure}} of a crafty opponent. The key for a <b>witness</b> is to understand the facts that they believe to be the case and not add additional thoughts to those facts, lest they be used to undermine the testimony. Sticking to the brief known facts is key for the <b>witness,</b> making it difficult for the cross-examiner to make the <b>witness</b> appear confused, biased or deceitful. The cross examiner will assume the <b>witness</b> has been told that and begin asking supporting questions about where the <b>witness</b> was, what time it was, what the <b>witness</b> saw, what they said, and sooner or later upon asking again the <b>witness</b> may use a different word that will give the cross-examiner a chance to ask the question again doubtfully and pointedly implying contradiction. The <b>witness</b> will try typically to explain and clarify, which sometimes reveals weakness in the <b>witness's</b> statements of fact.

Constable Dales told the jury that Thornton admitted having sex with Ashford before he was searched: that is, before his bloodstained clothing came to light. Mr Freer, a Birmingham surgeon who conducted the post-mortem, testified as to its results, and stated that except for the vaginal lacerations, there were no signs of violence on Ashford's person, and that those cuts could have been caused by consensual sexual relations.
