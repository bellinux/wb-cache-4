40|$|Abstract. Research on {{the effect}} of main spindle {{deformation}} which is caused by hobbing force of gear hobbing machine is an important way to diminish or control the machining tolerance of gear. This paper bases on the structure and technique parameter of some typical large-scale NC gear hobbing machine, and the theory of bend and deformation of beam, a novel equation was proposed in this paper to calculate the hobbing force and deformation by practical hobbing parameter. By calculating and analyzing gear hobbing force and deformation data, we can conclude a change rule between hobbing force and deformation with spindle rotative velocity and hobbing depth. And we can reach a conclusion that we should increase hob rotative velocity and feed in a small hobbing depth in several times, it will diminish cutting force, deformation of hob and <b>workpiece</b> <b>spindle,</b> which will improve the machining precision, efficiency and diminish product scrap ratio. It also prove this research approach has reference value for optimizing gear hobbingmachine structure design, choice of processing technique parameter and machining error prediction and compensation...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} analysis, design, {{and control}} techniques developed for machines that diamond-turn asymmetric surfaces. Examples {{of this type}} of surface include spectacle and contact lenses, human lens implants, elements for laser eye surgery and camera lenses, as well as image-train elements in semiconductor processing equipment, laser printers, and other image processing equipment. The asymmetric features in such parts require a fast tool servo to synchronize the motion of the cutting tool with the motion of the <b>workpiece</b> <b>spindle.</b> At present, elements with low-amplitude asymmetry (< 500 [mu]m) can be fabricated on commercially-available machines. However, no device currently exists which can achieve appreciably larger stroke lengths along with the necessary accelerations and positioning accuracy to fabricate optics with significant asymmetry. The prototype machine developed as part of this thesis is specialized for diamond turning astigmatic spectacle lenses. This machine can turn 100 mm diameter parts having feature amplitudes of up to 3 cm and with 500 m/s 2 peak accelerations and with micron-level form error. The fast tool servo uses a novel rotary arm design that carries a cutting tool through a circular path instead of along a straight line. Only the tool tip itself thus undergoes the highest translational accelerations. In contrast, all elements of a linear-axis fast tool servo accelerate at the same rate, and so contribute equally to the inertia. This feature allows a rotary fast tool servo design to achieve higher tool accelerations with reduced transmission of reaction forces and torques into the machine base than is possible with a comparable linear system. Associated with the rotary fruit tool servo are new approaches to tool path generation and control system design. The tool motion is periodic on the spindle angle, and thus can be represented as a summation of sinusoidal terms. The controller supplies high dynamic stiffness to the system mainly at integer multiples of the spindle frequency through a form of repetitive control. This existing technique has been further developed in this thesis to incorporate known system frequency response information. The new fast tool servo and associated algorithms developed herein have great promise for machining asymmetric surfaces with large-amplitude surface features. by Stephen Joseph Ludwick, Jr. Thesis (Ph.

25|$|Hobbing uses a {{hobbing machine}} with two skew spindles, one mounted {{with a blank}} {{workpiece}} {{and the other with}} the hob. The angle between the hob's spindle (axis) and the <b>workpiece's</b> <b>spindle</b> varies, {{depending on the type of}} product being produced. For example, if a spur gear is being produced, then the hob is angled equal to the helix angle of the hob; if a helical gear is being produced then the angle must be increased by the same amount as the helix angle of the helical gear. The two shafts are rotated at a proportional ratio, which determines the number of teeth on the blank; for example, for a single-threaded hob if the gear ratio is 40:1 the hob rotates 40 times to each turn of the blank, which produces 40 teeth in the blank. If the hob has multiple threads the speed ratio must be multiplied by the number of threads on the hob. The hob is then fed up into the workpiece until the correct tooth depth is obtained. Finally the hob is fed through the workpiece parallel to the blank's axis of rotation.|$|R
