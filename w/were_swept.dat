5|$|Additionally, {{there is}} a {{relative}} absence of objects with semi-major axes below 39 AU that cannot apparently {{be explained by the}} present resonances. The currently accepted hypothesis for the cause of this is that as Neptune migrated outward, unstable orbital resonances moved gradually through this region, and thus any objects within it <b>were</b> <b>swept</b> up, or gravitationally ejected from it.|$|E

5|$|After {{finishing}} last in 1966–67, the Bruins {{qualified for}} the 1968 playoffs, their first appearance in the playoffs since the 1958–59 season.

5|$|The 4:1 orbital {{resonance}} with Jupiter, at a radius 2.06AU, can {{be considered}} the inner boundary of the asteroid belt. Perturbations by Jupiter send bodies straying there into unstable orbits. Most bodies formed inside the radius of this gap <b>were</b> <b>swept</b> up by Mars (which has an aphelion at 1.67AU) or ejected by its gravitational perturbations in {{the early history of}} the Solar System. The Hungaria asteroids lie closer to the Sun than the 4:1 resonance, but are protected from disruption by their high inclination.|$|E
