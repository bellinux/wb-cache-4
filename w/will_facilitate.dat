5|$|In February 2017, UBS Group AG and the Northern Trust Corporation, an American {{international}} financial services company, announced an agreement for {{the acquisition of}} UBS Asset Management's fund administration servicing units in Luxembourg and Switzerland. This acquisition <b>will</b> <b>facilitate</b> {{the expansion of the}} Northern Trust Corporation into these two countries, turning the American company into the major fund administrator in the local markets and into one of the ten global leaders in the sector. At the end of the transaction, expected for the second half of 2017, the American company will administrate a total of CHF420 billion in assets. UBS Asset Management will continue anyway to offer Management Company, White Labelling and Representative Services to its clients. Ulrich Körner, president of the UBS Asset Management, affirms that the continuous transformation of their platform is due to a major efficiency, effectiveness and geographical dislocation of the services offered by the bank.|$|E
5|$|Over the years, several {{accidents}} {{have occurred}} on the bridge resulting in traffic congestion, and sometimes closure of the bridge for a few hours. To relieve the heavy traffic congestion at the entry to the bridge, the Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners (HRBC) plan to build two one-way-exit and entry–ramps. These are planned with a semi-circular layout {{in the form of}} side wings, which <b>will</b> <b>facilitate</b> easy flow of traffic, before the toll plaza, on roads leading to the Howrah railway station. There are also plans to improve the lighting on the bridge by installing LED lamps and search lights covering the four pylons, the bridge spans, cables and under-deck. An electronic toll collection system was scheduled to be introduced by 2014, to help improve the flow of traffic across the bridge.|$|E

40|$|Do philosophic views affect job performance? The {{authors found}} that {{possessing}} {{a belief in}} free will predicted better career attitudes and actual job performance. The effect of free will beliefs on job performance indicators were over and above wellestablished predictors such as conscientiousness, locus of control, and Protestant work ethic. In Study 1, stronger belief in free will corresponded to more positive attitudes about expected career success. In Study 2, job performance was evaluated objectively and independently by a supervisor. Results indicated that employees who espoused free will beliefs were given better work performance evaluations than those who disbelieve in free will, presumably because belief in free <b>will</b> <b>facilitates</b> exerting control over one’s actions...|$|R

Emotional responsiveness, as defined by low psychopathy scores, also facilitated learning from emotional experiences (Studies 2 and 3). The degree of learning associated with emotional experiences was measured by self-rating (Study 1), independent evaluations of lessons learned (Study 2), and whether participants joined a campus recycling program (after being made to feel guilty about an environmental transgression; Study 3) ...|$|R
