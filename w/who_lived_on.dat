5|$|By {{the reign}} of George I, the May Fair had fallen into disrepute and was {{regarded}} as a public scandal. The 6th Earl of Coventry, <b>who</b> <b>lived</b> <b>on</b> Piccadilly, considered the fair to be a nuisance and led a public campaign against it along with local residents. It was abolished in 1764. One of the reasons for Mayfair's subsequent boom in property development was to keep out lower class activities.|$|E
5|$|Ljótólfr {{is a minor}} {{character}} in the mediaeval Orkneyinga saga, who is purported to have flourished in the mid-12th century. The Orkneyinga saga was compiled in about 1200, and documents the reigns of the earls of Orkney. It depicts Ljótólfr as a nobleman <b>who</b> <b>lived</b> <b>on</b> the Outer Hebridean island of Lewis. During the 12th century, the Hebrides formed part of the Kingdom of Mann and the Isles.|$|E
5|$|After {{the start}} of the war with Japan, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed an order for {{internment}} of all the people of Japanese ancestry <b>who</b> <b>lived</b> <b>on</b> the West Coast. About 1,700of them lived in Portland, and some had farms or businesses near the slough. When the government removed them from their homes in 1942, it housed them temporarily in the Livestock Exposition Center (Expo Center) in Kenton before sending them to internment camps further inland. They were not allowed to return until 1945.|$|E

5|$|Commoners {{known as}} guests and {{retainers}} (binke 賓客) <b>who</b> <b>lived</b> <b>on</b> {{the property of}} a host in exchange for services had existed since the Warring States period. Retainers often originally belonged to other social groups, and sometimes they were fugitives seeking shelter from authorities. Hosts were often wealthy nobles and officials, yet they were sometimes wealthy commoners. In a typical relationship, a host provided lodging, food, clothing, and carriage transport for his retainers in return for occasional and non-routine work or services such as an advisory role, a post as bodyguard, menial physical labor around the house, and sometimes more dangerous missions such as committing assassinations, fighting off roving bandits, or riding into battle to defend the host. Others could work as spies, scholarly protégés, or astrologers.|$|E
5|$|Contrary to {{what many}} outsiders believed, most {{residents}} of the Walled City behaved similarly to other Hong Kong natives. In response to difficult living conditions, the residents formed a tightly knit community, helping one another endure various hardships. Within families, wives often did housekeeping, while grandmothers cared for their grandchildren and other children from surrounding households. The City's rooftops were an important gathering place, especially for residents <b>who</b> <b>lived</b> <b>on</b> upper floors. Parents used them to relax, and children would play or do homework there after school.|$|E
5|$|Harry Randall Truman (October 30, 1896 – May 18, 1980) was a {{resident}} of the U.S. state of Washington <b>who</b> <b>lived</b> <b>on</b> Mount St. Helens. He came to brief fame in the months preceding the volcano's 1980 eruption after he stubbornly refused to leave his home despite evacuation orders, and he is presumed to {{have been killed in the}} eruption. He was the owner and caretaker of Mount St. Helens Lodge at Spirit Lake, located at the south end of Spirit Lake at the foot of the mountain in the danger zone at the time of the eruption.|$|E

5|$|In 2013, Lex Wotton, {{as well as}} {{his wife}} Cecilia and Mother Agnes, filed a class action lawsuit on behalf of Aboriginal people <b>who</b> <b>lived</b> <b>on</b> Palm Island against the State of Queensland and the Commissioner of the Police Service, alleging that the police had {{committed}} acts of unlawful racial discrimination in the investigation into Mulrunji's death in custody and in the subsequent police response to the unrest in the community. The Wottons' legal team included Lex Wotton's long-standing lawyer, Stewart Levitt of law firm Levitt Robinson Solicitors, as well as prominent anti-discrimination barrister Chris Ronalds SC, Aboriginal barrister Joshua Creamer, and Queensland barrister Shaneen Pointing.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1909, Bryant moved to Portland, first sharing a {{downtown}} apartment {{with one of her}} college friends, Clara Wold, then renting her own apartment in the same building. Among her jobs, she designed a stained-glass window for the Povey Brothers, worked as a freelance reporter for The Oregonian, and became an illustrator and society editor for the Portland Spectator, a weekly news magazine. Meanwhile, she formed friendships with people—such as Cas Baer, drama editor for The Oregonian—who were interested in journalism and the arts. In late 1909, she met and married Paul Trullinger, a dentist <b>who</b> <b>lived</b> <b>on</b> a houseboat on the Willamette River, collected art, and liked drinking parties that sometimes included invitations to his office to inhale ether.|$|E
5|$|Mark Braithwaite was 18 when Blakelock was killed, {{a rapper}} and disc jockey {{living with his}} parents in Islington, London, N1. He had a girlfriend <b>who</b> <b>lived</b> <b>on</b> Broadwater Farm, {{with whom he had}} a child. On 16 January 1986, three months after the murder, his name was {{mentioned}} {{for the first time to}} detectives by a man they had arrested, Bernard Kinghorn. Kinghorn told them he had seen Braithwaite, whom he said he knew only by sight, stab Blakelock with a kitchen knife. Kinghorn later withdrew the allegation, telling the BBC three years later that it had been false.|$|E

5|$|Mississippi was {{the poorest}} {{state in the}} U.S. in the 1950s, and the Delta {{counties}} {{were some of the}} poorest in Mississippi. Mamie Carthan was born in Tallahatchie County, where the average income per white household in 1949 was $690 ($ in 2013 dollars). For black families, the figure was $462 ($ in 2013 dollars). In the rural areas, economic opportunities for blacks were almost nonexistent. They were mostly sharecroppers <b>who</b> <b>lived</b> <b>on</b> land owned by whites. Blacks had essentially been disenfranchised and excluded from voting and the political system since 1890, when the white-dominated legislature passed a new constitution that raised barriers to voter registration. Whites had also passed ordinances establishing racial segregation and Jim Crow laws.|$|E
5|$|Nora Belahcen Fitzgerald first {{conceived}} {{of the idea}} of creating an organization to help Morocco's underprivileged women through career training in 2006 after meeting a single mother begging on the street <b>who</b> <b>lived</b> <b>on</b> 2030 dirhams per day (about €2.70, $3.40 in 2006). Belahcen Fitzgerald was inspired by the Association Solidarité Féminine, which helps single mothers overcome poverty and social stigma by providing them with shelter, counselling, and vocational training. She decided to begin helping women by teaching them to make baked goods in her family's language center. This proved to be successful, and the participants were able to make more money using their new skills than by begging. In 2008, Belahcen Fitzgerald began hiring underprivileged Moroccan women to cook for events she organized for her friends.|$|E
5|$|On 2 March 1737, penniless, Johnson {{left for}} London {{with his former}} pupil David Garrick. To make things worse, Johnson {{received}} word that his brother had died on the day they left. However, their prospects were not completely hopeless, as Garrick was set to inherit a large sum the next year. Also, Garrick had connections in London, and the two would stay with his distant relative, Richard Norris, <b>who</b> <b>lived</b> <b>on</b> Exeter Street. Johnson did not stay there long, and set out for Greenwich near the Golden Hart Tavern to finish Irene. During that time, he wrote to Cave on 12 July 1737 and proposed a translation for Paolo Sarpi's The History of the Council of Trent (1619), which Cave did not accept until months later.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the most}} {{prominent}} characters of the Orkneyinga saga is the Viking chieftain Sveinn Ásleifarson, <b>who</b> <b>lived</b> <b>on</b> the island of Gairsay, in Orkney. The saga relates how Sveinn's father, Óláfr Hrólfsson, was one of several chieftains who supported Páll Hákonsson, Earl of Orkney, in a victorious sea battle against a fleet led by Ölvir Rósta in support of Rögnvaldr Kolsson, who had been appointed the earl of half of Orkney by the King of Norway. Óláfr was later burned to death inside his own house by Ölvir, the grandson of Frakökk, an ambitious woman, portrayed as a villain in the saga. Frakökk attempted to win the Earldom of Orkney for her descendantsparticularly Ölvir.|$|E
5|$|The Route 21 freeway {{was planned}} to extend north to Interstate 80 in Elmwood Park at the {{interchange}} with County Route 507, crossing over the Passaic River. However, this extension was opposed by residents <b>who</b> <b>lived</b> <b>on</b> {{the east side}} of the Passaic River, and for a quarter-century, traffic headed for Paterson had to use local streets in Passaic. In the 1980s, plans were resurrected for completing the Route 21 freeway along the west bank of the Passaic River to U.S. Route 46 in Clifton. Official plans were made in 1996, and in late 1997, construction began on this portion of the freeway. It opened on December 20, 2000 at a cost of $136 million.|$|E
5|$|Clan Maclachlan claims {{descent from}} Lachlan Mor, <b>who</b> <b>lived</b> <b>on</b> {{the shores of}} Loch Fyne in the 13th century. Lachlan belonged to the family who {{originally}} emigrated from Ireland to Scotland in the 11th century. The progenitor of this family, Anrothan, son of Aodh O'Neil, king of the north of Ireland, {{is said to have}} married the heiress of the King of Scots and gained lands campaigning there. Moncreiffe wrote that it was more likely Anrothan married a daughter of the local king of Argyll or a sub-king of Cowal and through this marriage, Anrothan's descendants gained control of the lands of Knapdale and Cowal, and several Scottish clans claim a descent from him including Clan MacNeil of Barra, Clan Lamont, Clan MacEwen of Otter, and the MacSweens who became the Irish Sweeney Clan who left Scotland and returned to Ireland in the 14th century as leaders of Gallowglass.|$|E

5|$|From the Glades peoples, {{two major}} nations {{emerged in the}} area: the Calusa and the Tequesta. The Calusa was {{the largest and most}} {{powerful}} nation in South Florida. It controlled fifty villages located on Florida's west coast, around Lake Okeechobee, and on the Florida Keys. Most Calusa villages were located at the mouths of rivers or on key islands. The Calusa were hunter-gatherers <b>who</b> <b>lived</b> <b>on</b> small game, fish, turtles, alligators, shellfish, and various plants. Most of their tools were made of bone or teeth, although sharpened reeds were also effective for hunting or war. Calusa weapons consisted of bows and arrows, atlatls, and spears. Canoes were used for transportation, and South Florida tribes often canoed through the Everglades, but rarely lived in them. Canoe trips to Cuba were also common.|$|E
5|$|In late antiquity, {{historic}} accounts {{become much}} more diffuse, and the Iazyges generally cease to be mentioned as a tribe. In the late 4thcentury, two Sarmatian peoples were mentioned, the Argaragantes and the Limigantes, <b>who</b> <b>lived</b> <b>on</b> {{opposite sides of the}} Tisza river. One theory is that these two tribes were formed when the Iazyges were conquered by the Roxolani, with the Iazyges becoming the Limigantes, and the Roxolani becoming the Argaragantes. Another theory is that a group of Slavic tribesmen gradually migrated into the area, subservient to the Iazyges, and the Iazyges became known as the Argaragantes, and the Slavs were the Limigantes. Regardless of which is true, in the 5th century both of them were conquered by the Goths, and, by the time of Attila, they were absorbed into the Huns.|$|E
5|$|The {{residential}} {{units were}} more successful, and 95% of the 263 condominiums {{were sold in}} the first four months after it opened, despite their high prices—the cost of condominiums at the tower started at $600,000 and ranged up to $12 million, with the penthouse being sold for $15 million in 1985. The tower attracted many rich and famous residents, including Johnny Carson, David Merrick, Sophia Loren, and Steven Spielberg. At least one unidentified resident, <b>who</b> <b>lived</b> <b>on</b> the same floor as Johnny Carson, built a private swimming pool in their unit. In total, Trump received $300 million from the sale of the condominiums, which more than offset the $200 million cost of construction. However, by 1991, Trump was already involved in lawsuits against residents: in October of that year, he successfully sued actor Pia Zadora and her husband, businessman Meshulam Riklis, to collect $1 million in unpaid rent.|$|E
