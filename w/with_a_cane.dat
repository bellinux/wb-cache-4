After returning to work, he was forced to rest regularly due to gradually worsening anemia, and he sought to lessen his workload.

5|$|In {{the late}} 1850s, the antislavery Republican Party became the {{dominant}} political organization in Massachusetts, led by Senators Charles Sumner and Henry Wilson who espoused Garrison's views in Congress and further increased sectionalism. In 1856, Sumner delivered {{a speech on}} the Senate floor so scathing and insulting to pro-slavery politicians that Representative Preston Brooks of South Carolina severely beat him <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>cane.</b> By 1860, the Republicans controlled the Governor's office, the state legislature and the mayoralty of Boston.|$|E

5|$|Kennedy {{returned}} to the Senate in January 1965, walking <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>cane.</b> He employed a stronger and more effective legislative staff. He took on President Lyndon B. Johnson and almost succeeded in amending the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to explicitly ban the poll tax {{at the state and}} local level (rather than just directing the Attorney General to challenge its constitutionality there), thereby gaining a reputation for legislative skill. He was a leader in pushing through the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, which ended a quota system based upon national origin and which, despite Kennedy's predictions, would have a profound effect on the demographic makeup of the United States. He played a role in creation of the National Teachers Corps.|$|E

5|$|Quintilian {{provides}} the most extensive theory of primary education in Latin literature. According to Quintilian, each child has in-born ingenium, a talent for learning or linguistic intelligence that {{is ready to be}} cultivated and sharpened, as evidenced by the young child's ability to memorize and imitate. The child incapable of learning was rare. To Quintilian, ingenium represented a potential best realized in the social setting of school, and he argued against homeschooling. He also recognized the importance of play in child development, and disapproved of corporal punishment because it discouraged love of learning—in contrast to the practice in most Roman primary schools of routinely striking children <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>cane</b> (ferula) or birch rod for being slow or disruptive.|$|E
5|$|Laffoon's early {{education}} was {{obtained in the}} public schools of Madisonville. While there, one of his teachers was his sister, Susan Isabella Laffoon, who was only 16 years old. At age 15, while plowing a field, Laffoon was kicked in the hip by a mule, requiring a six-week stay in a Nashville hospital. In the winter of the same year, he slipped on some ice and re-injured the hip. As a result of these injuries, his right leg was one-and-a-half inches shorter than his left leg, requiring him to wear special shoes and walk <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>cane</b> and a limp {{for the rest of his}} life. After his injury, Laffoon's parents decided that he could not make his living as a farmer and sent him to the private school of W. C. O'Bryan. By age 17, he was teaching in the common schools of Charleston in Hopkins County.|$|E
5|$|Team Nash (Diamond Dallas Page, Sean Waltman, and {{an unknown}} member) fought Team Jarrett (Jeff Jarrett, Monty Brown, and The Outlaw) in the first-ever three-on-three Lethal Lockdown match, which ran 15 minutes and 35 seconds. Waltman and Jarrett started the match by {{fighting}} {{through the crowd}} before entering the cage. After five minutes, The Outlaw joined the match and helped Jarrett attack Waltman. Diamond Dallas Page entered the match two minutes later and attacked Jarrett and The Outlaw <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>cane.</b> Following another two minutes, Brown joined the fray, finished out Team Jarrett, and threw Waltman into the cage wall. The final member of Team Nash was revealed after the final two minutes, as B.G. James was thrown into the mix that allowed a pinfall or submission to occur. Brown gained a near-fall for Team Jarrett on James after forcing him into a trash can with his signature maneuver, the Pounce. Eventually, Waltman performed a move called a hurricanrana on Brown, leading to the pinfall and victory.|$|E

5|$|A second noted {{house in}} the Dupont Circle {{neighborhood}} which is claimed to be haunted is the Woodrow Wilson House (2340 S Street NW). Woodrow Wilson was elected President of the United States in 1912, was re-elected in 1916 promising to keep the nation out of war, led the nation through World War I, and left office in 1921. At 2 AM on September 26, 1919, while traveling to Wichita, Kansas, on a nationwide speaking tour to win public support to pressure the Senate into ratifying the Treaty of Versailles, Wilson collapsed and, after cancelling {{the rest of his}} speaking tour, was rushed back to the capital by train. His condition worsened on the journey, and upon arriving at the White House on October 2 the President suffered a life-threatening stroke that left him permanently paralyzed on his left side and blind in the left eye. Although the President lived, he was confined to bed for two months, seen only by his wife, a few close associates, and his physicians. From December 1919 to April 1920 Wilson required a wheelchair. Wilson attended his first Cabinet meeting in April 1920, {{but for the rest of}} the year his mind continued to wander, his memory was marred, and he tired easily. By March 1921 (when he left office) Wilson was able to walk short distances with the use of a cane (and with a valet close at hand). The extent of Wilson's disability was kept from the public until after his death on February 3, 1924. President and Mrs. Wilson purchased a large home at 2340 S Street NW, to which a number of modifications were made (including the addition of an elevator). Woodrow Wilson received few guests in his last years, and died in his third floor bedroom on February 3, 1924. His wife, Edith Bolling Galt Wilson, lived in the home until her death on December 28, 1961, and willed the home to the National Trust for Historic Preservation to be made into a museum honoring her husband. In the decades since her death, staff and visitors at the Woodrow Wilson House claim to have seen the President's ghost sitting in his rocking chair, heard the shuffle of a man walking <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>cane,</b> and heard a man sob.|$|E
5|$|The {{other main}} match {{on the card}} was a Hardcore Intergender match, as Edge and Mick Foley faced Terry Funk and Tommy Dreamer. The rivalry started between Edge and Foley, when the two faced in a Hardcore match at WrestleMania 22. Edge won the match after a spear off the apron and through a flaming table on the outside. Foley was a guest on the Cutting Edge on the May 1, 2006 episode of Raw, and the two agreed to a WrestleMania Hardcore rematch the {{following}} week. Before the match began on the May 8, 2006 edition of Raw, Foley announced that the match was now a triple threat match, with Tommy Dreamer added as the third person.

Foley handed Edge the bat and Edge hit Dreamer with it, busting him open. Foley hit the Mandible claw on Dreamer and Edge simultaneously speared Dreamer, with Foley getting the pinfall. The two, along with Lita celebrated up the entrance ramp. On the May 15, 2006 episode of Raw, Foley wanted to apologize to Dreamer for what happened the previous week; however, Dreamer was not in the arena, so Foley brought out Terry Funk. Funk asked Foley to apologize for what happened to Dreamer. Instead, Foley started bashing ECW. In an attempt to get into a fight with Foley, Funk made comments about Foley's family, calling his wife a whore and his kids s. When the two exchanged punches, Edge and Lita came out, with Lita low-blowing Funk. Edge and Foley double-teamed Funk, with Edge hitting Funk with a barbed wire baseball bat. A week later, on the May 22, 2006 edition of Raw, Edge and Foley announced themselves as co-holders of the WWE Hardcore Championship. Paul Heyman came out and made a challenge to Edge and Foley to face Funk and Dreamer at One Night Stand, which Edge accepted. The two, along with Lita, went after Heyman up the ramp, before Dreamer and Funk attacked them with several weapons, sending the trio out of the arena. On the WWE vs. ECW Head to Head special that aired on June 7, 2006, Edge faced Dreamer in an Extreme Rules match. Dreamer hit Edge with a Dreamer Driver through the table. Lita interfered, and hit Dreamer repeatedly <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>cane.</b> Dreamer was not hurt by the shots, and he got Lita up for a powerbomb, before Edge speared Dreamer. Edge got the pinfall and won the match. During the match, Foley and Funk were fighting outside the ring, with Funk busting Foley open. After the match, Foley sat in the middle of the ring and stated his kayfabe thoughts on ECW.|$|E
