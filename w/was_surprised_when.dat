5|$|Ian McDiarmid as Senator Palpatine / Darth Sidious, a Senator of Naboo who is {{eventually}} elected Chancellor of the Republic. McDiarmid <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>when</b> Lucas approached him 16 years after Return of the Jedi to reprise {{the role of}} Palpatine because he had assumed that a younger actor would play the part in the prequel films.|$|E
5|$|When {{designing}} the characters, Nomura had wanted {{at least one}} female character to wear a skirt. Quistis was originally supposed to fill this part, but Nomura decided a long skirt worn over pants would look better. The role was eventually passed to Selphie. Nomura <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>when</b> the writers cast her as a teacher, despite being around {{the same age as}} the rest of the group.|$|E
5|$|Additions {{to the end}} musical number, {{including}} visual gags such as Bob {{appearing in}} uniform, were added after the animatics. The crew felt that watching the character singing would not be interesting enough {{and they had to}} include these gags to make it work. The Simpsons creator Matt Groening <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>when</b> he saw the additions, because he originally thought they were silly and would not appear in the final cut, but he has grown to like them.|$|E

5|$|The {{album is}} the band's first after joining the main Victor Entertainment roster, after {{releasing}} two albums with Victor sub-label BabeStar. After {{the release of}} Night Fishing, the band began {{looking for a new}} management company to sign a contract with. Originally, the members did not want to leave Sapporo, especially guitarist Motoharu Iwadera and bassist Ami Kusakari. Of the five management companies they were choosing between, none of them needed the band to relocate, except for Hipland Management. Vocalist Ichiro Yamaguchi realized that staying in Sapporo was against the band's goal of making music for a much wider group of listeners, and <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>when</b> all of the members agreed with him. In Spring 2008, the band moved to Tokyo from Hokkaido.|$|E
5|$|On 17 October 1820, news arrived {{that the}} {{military}} garrisons in Portugal had mutinied, leading to {{what became known as}} the Liberal Revolution of 1820. The military formed a provisional government, supplanting the regency appointed by JoãoVI, and summoned the Cortes—the centuries-old Portuguese parliament, this time democratically elected with the aim of creating a national Constitution. Pedro <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>when</b> his father not only asked for his advice, but also decided to send him to Portugal to rule as regent on his behalf and to placate the revolutionaries. The prince was never educated to rule and had previously been allowed no participation in state affairs. The role that was his by birthright was instead filled by his elder sister Dona Maria Teresa: JoãoVI had relied on her for advice, and it was she who had been given membership in the Council of State.|$|E
5|$|Thirty-five media {{commentators}} {{were interviewed}} for the film. Jory Weitz helped obtain interviews; he had cast Anderson's previous film, The Big Empty, and had industry credibility as {{executive producer of}} Napoleon Dynamite. Anderson said he intended to select interviewees {{with a variety of}} perspectives, conservative as well as liberal. He described how, as confirmations of interview subjects came in, he <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>when</b> Pat Boone {{was among the first to}} confirm his participation. Anderson had previously worked as a cameraman on a piece with Boone about eight years before starting work on Fuck. After confirming Boone, Bill Maher and Janeane Garofalo on Fuck, it became easier for Anderson to confirm other interviewees. The film included the final video interview with Hunter S. Thompson before his suicide, and Anderson dedicated it to Thompson for his contributions to journalism.|$|E

5|$|Domenicali insisted {{there were}} no team orders {{and that it was}} Massa who chose to allow Alonso past. Alonso reaffirmed Domenicalli's {{statement}} and admitted he <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>when</b> Massa slowed and claimed that he felt Massa had a gearbox issue. FIA reporter Lars Osterlind investigated the incident and sent a 160-page report to the World Motor Sport Council which concluded that Alonso should be given a five-second time penalty which would hand the victory to Massa. He also wanted a suspended penalty on the loss of Ferrari's Drivers' and Constructors' points scored in the event. At the World Motor Sport Council meeting held in Paris on 8 September, the tribunal elected to uphold the $100,000 fine imposed on Ferrari, decided that no further action would be taken against the team, and that Formula One's Sporting Working Group would review the rule that prohibited team orders. In December, the FIA announced the rule on team orders would be revoked because it was difficult to enforce. Parallels were made between the race and the 2002 Austrian Grand Prix where Barrichello was ordered by Ferrari to concede the event's victory to Schumacher on its final lap.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{believing the}} Iraqi Army would only {{advance to the}} Ramallah oil field, Schwarzkopf <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>when</b> the Iraqis {{captured}} Kuwait City. Fearing Iraq would next invade Saudi Arabia, Schwarzkopf ordered contingency plans put in motion, with the 82nd Airborne Division, 101st Airborne Division and 24th Infantry Division put on alert. He was then called to an emergency meeting with President George H. W. Bush, where his Internal Look '90 strategic plans were made {{the basis of a}} potential counteroffensive plan. By August 5, Bush opted for an aggressive response to the invasion. Schwarzkopf then accompanied Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney to meet with Saudi King Fahd to convince him to allow U.S. troops into Saudi Arabia to counter the Iraqi military. With Fahd's consent, Bush ordered troops into Saudi Arabia on August 7, initially tasked to defend Saudi Arabia should Iraq attack. U.S. commanders from the beginning wanted a quick conflict characterized by decisive, overwhelming force, as opposed to the gradual escalation of U.S. involvement as had been seen in Vietnam. Schwarzkopf in particular was very adamant that many of the policies governing military operations in Vietnam, especially slow escalation of air power and troop force, not reoccur. His plan for direct and overwhelming force was initially criticized in Washington as uncreative. By August 13, the news media began to closely cover Schwarzkopf, who had been named to lead the operation.|$|E
5|$|The {{island is}} ruled {{over by a}} king. His name is Epatiana. He is a large, ignorant-looking boy of about 18 summers, {{and is one of}} the worst rowdies on the island, and there is no power to touch him. The first time we met him he was just landing from an {{excursion}} trip to the island of Rimatara, near by. And you need not be told that I <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>when</b> told that he was the king of the island; for instead of being dressed in a garb of rich apparel of some kind, with a crown about his head, as I had expected, he had nothing whatever on to indicate his supreme power. His costume was composed of a red breech-clout, a red woolen shirt and upon his bare head an old dried up wreath of faded flowers, such as is worn by all rowdies. When we spoke to him about his island, he dropped his head, as he sat upon the sand, and blushingly answered us. We told him who we were and where we were from, saluted him and left him with very different ideas formed about the king of Rurutu, than we had before meeting him. This was the first monarch of the kind I ever saw, and the first time we were ever under the reign of a king. The island is under the French protection, still it regulates and governs its own affairs, and the French have nothing to say in that respect. The king has judges under him, who make the laws and enforce them while he is in his childhood days.|$|E

25|$|Miguel Gatins and Robert Rivard {{questioned}} whether the Mexican justice system worked. While Gatins originally supported the two Huichol men, he argued that Mexican justice did work when it freed them, while Rivard {{made the case that}} justice would not be served if guilty parties were freed. Martha True said she had been disappointed by the closed process and <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>when</b> the 2001 release. By the end of 2003, Gatins had switched his support to Rivard and True's position.|$|E

25|$|In the meantime, anti-Spanish sentiments {{in several}} South American {{countries}} (including Bolivia, Chile and Ecuador) increased. It {{was obvious to}} most observers that Spain {{had no intention of}} retaking its former colonies. However, Peru and its neighbors still remained wary of any moves that might foreshadow an attempt to reestablish the Spanish Empire. Given the climate of suspicion, no one <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>when</b> the Spanish gunboat Vencedora stopped at a Chilean port for coal and President José Joaquín Pérez declared that coal was a war supply that could not be sold to a belligerent nation.|$|E
25|$|The verse form of Doctrinale in fact arose by accident. Alexander {{had been}} {{employed}} by the bishop of Dol-de-Bretagne to teach Latin to his nephews, using the grammar of Priscian. He had noticed that the boys could not remember Priscian as prose, so he translated its rules into verse form. When Alexander was away one day, the bishop asked his nephews a grammar question, and <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>when</b> they answered in verse. The bishop persuaded Alexander to compile and to publish an entire book of such verses, which became the Doctrinale.|$|E
25|$|Although {{he feared}} a {{backlash}} {{for being a}} communist, Jones <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>when</b> a Methodist superintendent (whom he had not met through the American Communist Party) helped him into the church, despite his knowledge that Jones was a communist. In 1952, Jones became a student pastor in Sommerset Southside Methodist Church in Indianapolis, but left that church because it barred him from integrating African Americans into his congregation. In 1954, Jones began his own church in a rented space in Indianapolis, at first naming it the Community Unity Church.|$|E

25|$|In 1980, {{he served}} as Chairman of the 35th Annual Meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank Group. Upon his arrival in Washington, D.C., he <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>when</b> IMF staff {{presented}} him with a draft for his opening speech. He politely declined {{saying that he had}} brought his own. As Chairman, his instruction to invite the Palestine Liberation Organization as an observer to the annual meeting was refused by the World Bank President. He denounced the IMF as a relic of World War II designed to protect the West.|$|E
25|$|Jones <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>when</b> a Methodist {{superintendent}} {{helped him}} get a start in the church {{even though he knew}} Jones to be a communist and Jones did not meet him through the Communist Party USA. In 1952, he became a student pastor in Sommerset Southside Methodist Church, but claimed he left that church because its leaders barred him from integrating blacks into his congregation. Around this time, Jones witnessed a faith-healing service at a Seventh Day Baptist Church. He observed that it attracted people and their money and concluded that, with financial resources from such healings, he could help accomplish his social goals.|$|E
25|$|In 1805, Gyulay {{fought in}} the Ulm Campaign, {{commanding}} the Danube army's grenadier reserve in Franz von Werneck's corps. At the Battle of Günzburg on 9 October he commanded a division of seven battalions and 14 squadrons. Ordered to rebuild a bridge across the Danube, he did so but <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>when</b> a French infantry regiment suddenly appeared and seized the span. Later, he escaped from Ulm with Archduke Ferdinand Karl Joseph of Austria-Este and others. On 4 November, Gyulai served on a council of war convened by Emperor Francis II {{to determine how to}} save Vienna. Soon afterward, the emperor ordered him to negotiate secretly with Emperor Napoleon I of France.|$|E
