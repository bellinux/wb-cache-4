It was in the tone quality, the timbre, of the futazao shamisen, the wide-necked shamisen used in Bunraku, that I first recognized the splendor of traditional Japanese music. I was very moved by it and I wondered why my attention had never been captured before by this Japanese music.|$|E
25|$|Chen Biao {{requested}} {{to serve in}} the military just like his father before him, and was placed in command of 500 troops. He was eager to win the hearts of his soldiers so he treated them well and they were willing to die for him. Once, there was an incident of grand theft and the suspect was Shi Ming (施明), a soldier from the Wunan (無難) camp. Shi Ming had been arrested and interrogated, but he remained fierce, refused to reveal the truth, and even expressed his willingness to die. The Minister of Justice (廷尉) was unable to do anything to him. Sun Quan heard that Chen Biao understood a soldier's mentality well so he ordered Chen to take up Shi Ming's case. Chen Biao had Shi Ming released from his shackles and allowed him to take a bath and have a change of clothes, and treated him to a feast. Shi Ming was so touched by Chen Biao's generous treatment that he confessed to the crime and named his accomplices. Sun Quan <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>surprised</b> and impressed with Chen Biao, so he granted a special pardon to Shi Ming to protect Chen's reputation – because Chen would be labelled as a hypocrite if Shi were to be executed after confessing under Chen's kind treatment. Shi Ming's accomplices, on the other hand, were not so lucky as they were all executed. Shi Ming mended his ways and gradually rose through the ranks to become a general in Eastern Wu.|$|E
500|$|Despite being literate, {{giving him}} a chance to become a scholar, young Yue Fei chose the {{military}} path because there had never been any tradition of full-fledged Confucian civil service in his family history. He would stay up all night reading military strategy books and idolized such great historical heroes as Guan Yu. However, the Yue family was much too poor to afford military lessons for their son, so, Yao Dewang, the boy's maternal grandfather, hired Chen Guang (陈广) to teach the eleven-year-old how to wield the Chinese spear. Yao <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>surprised</b> when his grandson quickly mastered the spear by the age of thirteen. Zhou was then brought in to continue Yue's military training in archery.

500|$|The overall standings did {{not change}} until stage 12, on Bastille Day, which ended with the hors catégorie climb to Luz Ardiden. Voeckler {{finished}} ninth on the day, ceding 20 seconds {{to most of the}} race's top overall riders, but still had sufficient time in hand to remain race leader by nearly two minutes. Rolland finished at his side for tenth on the day. Voeckler had said the night before that he expected to lose the jersey on this stage. After the peloton mostly stayed together in stage 13, popular expectation for stage 14, including two first-category climbs on course and another hors catégorie climb at the finish (Plateau de Beille), again was for Voeckler to lose the jersey. But he not only retained the jersey, he also finished with the main group of overall favorites, losing time to only three riders and actually putting time into other riders such as Damiano Cunego and Tom Danielson. Voeckler himself again expressed his surprise at his successes, saying [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>surprised</b> to be with the best riders up the Plateau de Beille climb. I don't know how far I can go." [...] Stage 16 ended with a lengthy descent, from the second-category Col de Manse. Voeckler lost time to nearly all the race's top riders, and expressed after the stage his certainty that he could not win the Tour, but he remained race leader.|$|E

500|$|Shot in Romania {{over two}} days, the video cost {{approximately}} 150,000 euros. The scenario {{was written by}} Farmer and directed by Agustí Villaronga, then broadcast on television from 9March 2005. The video for [...] "Peut-être toi" [...] was originally intended to illustrate this song. The scarecrows which feature in the video were made by Swiss artist Martial Leiter. Farmer contacted him after seeing a documentary on France 3 about an open-air exhibition of scarecrows which were an allegory of the human figure. Leiter explained that he <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>surprised</b> when he was contacted by the singer's producers {{and that he was}} first hesitating, but finally agreed after a discussion with Farmer. He also stated that he was satisfied with the work and was happy to see that Farmer mentioned his name {{at the end of the}} video. Initially, Farmer wanted to use the scarecrows seen in the documentary, but Leiter refused to give her those from his exhibition, instead preferring to create some new scarecrows that were easier to break. In the music video, the scarecrows have a black bird skull and wear torn black veils that float in the wind. Several components often used in Farmer's previous music videos appear in this one: snow, a horse, and some crows. The video and its making-of were released as a DVD bonus available free with the second edition of the studio album. In the making-of, Villaronga provides explanations about the video, while Farmer appears [...] "distant and very professional", according to Télé 2 Semaines.|$|E
500|$|Following their collision, Hamilton and Rosberg were {{summoned to}} the {{stewards}} after the race but neither received a penalty, as the stewards rated their crash as a racing incident, with no driver in particular to blame. It emerged that Rosberg had chosen the wrong engine mode for the start, being down on power which led to Hamilton going for a passing manoeuvre. However, Rosberg remained convinced {{that he had done}} nothing wrong, saying: [...] "I made it very clear I wasn't going to leave any space on the inside and I <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>surprised</b> he went for the gap". While Hamilton apologised to the team after the incident, he refused to accept blame for it. Opinions about the incident varied: While Mercedes's executive chairman Niki Lauda blamed Hamilton for the crash, former F1 driver Anthony Davidson said on Sky Sports F1 that Rosberg's move was [...] "very aggressive". Three-time world champion Jackie Stewart said after the race that Mercedes should fine Hamilton for the crash: [...] "Hamilton is to blame. Rosberg was allowed to protect himself. You don't go for it on the first lap." [...] Mercedes's head of motorsport Toto Wolff stressed after the race that the team would continue to let their drivers race against each other freely, a decision praised by former world champion Alain Prost. While Rosberg said after the race that he contemplated having a talk with Hamilton about the situation, Mercedes later decided that they did [...] "not need clear-the-air talks". However, it later emerged that the pair did have a conversation about the incident before the next race in Monaco, which, according to Hamilton, was marked by [...] "pure respect". It was Mercedes's first double retirement since the 2011 Australian Grand Prix, and the first time they failed to score a point since the 2012 United States Grand Prix, ending a 62-race long streak, the third longest in Formula One history.|$|E
500|$|Unlike {{the first}} season, where the Wachowskis and Straczynski split {{the amount of}} scripts in half and worked {{remotely}} from each other (but with frequent meetings), writing for the second season was performed by Lana and Straczynski by collaborating inside a shared writers' room. The author of Cloud Atlas David Mitchell and the novelist and columnist Aleksandar Hemon worked as additional writers on the second season and were credited as [...] "consultants"; they also made a cameo appearance in an episode as themselves. Both writers came to know {{and work with the}} Wachowskis prior to Sense8. Lana became friends with Mitchell after adapting Cloud Atlas to film with her sister and Tom Tykwer, and <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>surprised</b> to read Mitchell's The Bone Clocks shortly before shooting the first season of Sense8 to find it strongly resembled [...] "Sense8 and Jupiter Ascending [...] together", even though they each wrote their works separately. Hemon first met the Wachowskis in 2009, when they interviewed him looking for inspiration to write a movie script they wanted, and in turn he profiled them and wrote about the making of Cloud Atlas for The New Yorker in 2012. For the second season of Sense8, Mitchell and Hemon were brought in to spend a week in September 2015 with Lana, Straczynski, and script supervisor Julie Brown, proposing to them situations, twists and turns, to be further developed by Lana and Straczynski. Afterwards {{and for the rest of}} the year, Mitchell and Hemon were regularly being tasked by Lana to write from distance select scenes on short deadlines, that she and Straczynski would further develop or reject. Hemon estimates he delivered around 120 pages, of which none made it to the second season's 700-paged script without changes. Later, once filming began, Lana did a lot of rewrites on a daily basis as she got inspired by the locations, actors, and so on, even on the set.|$|E

France had earlier guaranteed the independence of Belgium in the Treaty of London in 1839 as an [...] "independent and perpetually neutral state", making the proposal a tacit agreement to break their promise. Bismarck <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>surprised</b> since he had already gained a powerful position in Europe by the armistice, and called Napoleon III's request among others later [...] "like 'an innkeeper's bill' or a waiter asking for 'a tip'."
