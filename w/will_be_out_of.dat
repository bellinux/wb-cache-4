2500|$|With {{several days}} to spare before they are due in Portsmouth, the trio stop off at the major cities along their route to provide bon-voyage adventures for Meadows. In Washington, DC, their first {{endeavor}} ends in failure when they are denied drinks at a bar, as Meadows is too young. Instead Buddusky gets a few six-packs so they all can get drunk in a hotel room. When Meadows passes out on the room's only real bed, the other two let him stay there and take the uncomfortable roll-away beds for themselves. In Camden they seek out Meadows' mother, only to find her away {{for the day and}} the house a pigsty, cluttered with empty whiskey bottles. They take him ice skating at Rockefeller Center in New York City. Buddusky tells Mulhall, [...] "the kid is 18, he <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> prison at 26;" [...] they take Meadows to a brothel in Boston, so that he can lose his virginity. In between, they brawl with Marines in a public restroom, dine on [...] "the world's finest" [...] Italian sausage sandwiches, chant with Nichiren Shōshū Buddhists, and open intimate windows for each other in swaying train coaches. Meadows pronounces his several days with Badass and Mule to be the best of his whole life.|$|E
2500|$|To Malone and ABC executives' surprise, Todd {{became an}} [...] "immensely popular" [...] {{character}} during the storyline. As his popularity grew, {{and as a}} solution {{not to have to}} kill off what had become a perceived monster, Malone and executive producer Susan Bedsow Horgan chose a controversial option [...] the decision to complicate Todd by ensuring that he was not a one-dimensional rapist. Malone and Horgan started Todd's transition into a more well-rounded character with their second transition of Powell. They had Powell attempt suicide and soon confess to raping Marty. He is publicly forgiven by Marty herself, which enrages Todd when he and fellow rapist Zach receive eight-year sentences behind prison compared to Powell's three months of jail time. Todd makes a vow that he <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> prison in three months as well. To carry out this vow, Todd was written to escape by [...] "drugging himself, waking from a coma to leap from a speeding ambulance, and then reviving himself again by stabbing a knife through his hand while rolling his eyes heavenward" [...] and saying the pain felt good. The scary determination of the character had become characteristic of him by then, and he often seemed superhuman. Within the story, he wants revenge on the person he feels is most responsible for his prison time, Nora. With his escape from prison, he sets out to attack the currently blind Nora. Todd stalks and torments her, but she is spared from his attack by her then-husband Bo Buchanan (Robert S. Woods) showing up before Todd can finish the assault and rape her.|$|E
