5000|$|While in Americus, Mants {{reported}} {{over the}} <b>Wide</b> <b>Area</b> <b>Telephone</b> <b>Service</b> that [...] "negro and white" [...] mobs were forming {{on the evening}} of July 6, 1964, possibly in response to riots the evening before or the integration of two downtown restaurants earlier in the day, which had occurred without incident. Mants was working to calm and disperse the mobs. An hour later, Mants reported a drive-by shooting with no reported injuries or deaths.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} <b>Wide</b> <b>Area</b> <b>Telephone</b> <b>Service</b> is obsolete. North American toll-free {{numbers are}} controlled by an intelligent network database (SMS/800) in which any toll-free number may be directed to a local or long-distance geographic telephone number, a T-carrier or primary rate interface line {{under the control of}} any of various RespOrgs. Direct inward dialing and toll-free number portability are supported; various providers offer gateways which receive free phone calls on PRI lines and deliver them to voice over IP or pager users.|$|E
50|$|The first {{automated}} toll-free {{numbers were}} assigned with area code 800, created as inbound <b>Wide</b> <b>Area</b> <b>Telephone</b> <b>Service</b> (InWATS) in 1966 (U.S. intrastate) and 1967 (interstate). These terminated on special fixed-rate trunks which would accept calls from a specified calling area with either no limit or a specific {{maximum number of}} hours per month. The billing of calls was not itemized and the expensive fixed-rate line was only within financial reach of large corporations and government agencies. Typically, a service provider offered a variety of zones, each costing more than the smaller ones, but adding progressively larger areas from which calls would be accepted for a customer.|$|E

40|$|An {{approach}} to forecasting {{the demand for}} local <b>area</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>service</b> is presented in this paper. The specific problem discussed is the forecasting of main stations in three Michigan metropolitan areas. Several different statistical models are used. The first class of models introduced used adaptive exponential smoothing and is {{based solely on the}} past history of the time series involved. Although appropriate data at the local area level are very difficult to obtain, two exogenous time series related to household formation are used to construct more elaborate models for one of the areas. The various models are evaluated by both the average absolute and the root-mean-square forecast error. In terms of these criteria, the first class of models referred to above performs reasonably well while the second set does considerably better. This argues strongly that future improvements in forecasting accuracy will be made by the more extensive involvement of exogenous variables. ...|$|R
50|$|The {{telephone}} system employs an extensive system of modern network {{elements such as}} digital telephone exchanges, mobile switching centres, media gateways and signalling gateways at the core, interconnected by {{a wide variety of}} transmission systems using fibre-optics or Microwave radio relay networks. The access network, which connects the subscriber to the core, is highly diversified with different copper-pair, optic-fibre and wireless technologies.; cellular services, both analog and digital, are available in many areas. In the rural <b>areas,</b> the <b>telephone</b> <b>services</b> are still outdated, inadequate, and low density.|$|R
50|$|The initial {{implementation}} of toll-free calling was primitive. In the 1950s, a collect call or {{a call to}} a Zenith number had to be completed manually by a telephone operator; by 1967, a direct-dial +1-800 number could be provided using <b>Wide</b> <b>Area</b> <b>Telephone</b> <b>Service,</b> but each prefix was tied to a specific geographic destination and each number brought in on special fixed-rate trunks which were priced {{beyond the reach of}} most small businesses. There was no means to select between rival carriers and little room for vanity numbering; a subscriber would need three separate numbers to be reachable from Canada, US interstate and US intrastate.|$|E
5000|$|Collect/Reverse Charge calling Various schemes were {{devised to}} allow large organisations to {{automatically}} accept collect calls, where the recipient pays long-distance charges for any {{call from a}} predefined area. A Zenith number in the late 1950s required an operator manually determine the destination number from a printed list; the 1967 <b>Wide</b> <b>Area</b> <b>Telephone</b> <b>Service</b> introduced the first automated toll-free telephone numbers, terminated on special fixed-rate trunks. By the 1980s, computerisation of the system allowed British Telecom [...] "Linkline" [...] 0800 freephone numbers and AT&T +1-800- toll-free numbers {{to be controlled by}} a database and terminated virtually anywhere with each inbound call itemised and billed individually. This smart network was further refined to provide toll-free number portability in the 1990s.|$|E
5000|$|During the Civil Rights Movement in the U.S., activist {{organizations}} such as SNCC used WATS as a convenient way for eyewitnesses {{on the ground to}} convey information quickly. Notes from these phone calls were compiled into [...] "WATS Line Reports" [...] and mailed to civil rights leaders, the media, the Justice Department, and others involved in the events. WATS was also how organizations communicated with local leaders across the country. A [...] "Bay Area Friends of SNCC" [...] newsletter in 1965 described WATS:The WATS (<b>Wide</b> <b>Area</b> <b>Telephone</b> <b>Service)</b> line is the heart of all SNCC security and communications. For a flat monthly rate, an unlimited number of calls can be dialed directly to any place in the country — or the state — depending on what line one uses. The Jackson office has a state-wide line, the Atlanta office has the national WATS line. Both run on a 24-hour basis. A project worker can call in news of any incident, threat or major activity to the Jackson office. The WATS operator there takes down the details and relays it to Atlanta if the event is of national importance. In the case of a threat or incident involving Federal laws, Jackson will notify the FBI and the Justice Department. Atlanta uses its national WATS line to notify SNCC groups around the country.See [...] "External Links" [...] for digitized WATS Line Reports.|$|E

40|$|Telephone is a {{means of}} {{communication}} which can be used for some kinds of affairs such as, private affairs, social gathering affairs, gossiping, doing the home-works, or business affairs. The telephone can also be used for business which is called by telemarketing or teleselling. Realizing that educational world is getting wider, the writer wants to suggest a new material of English for Specific Purpose, which is growing recently. Here. the writer would like to introduce 'Telemarketing'. Most people have a mistaken opinion about marketing. In their opinion, marketing is an activity of selling or promoting. Actually, selling is one of the functions of marketing. Besides, marketing also has some kinds of strategies. There are similarities between product marketing strategy and merit marketing strategy. In marketing, (besides the effectiveness and the efficiency) the market needs, situation, and condition are always considered. At the time being, when every body has economic problems, when everything is too expensive, the businessman, the professionals, and others should have a deep thinking about a way that can save their business. Telemarketing, selling by phones is the way to solve the problem. By telemarketing {{there are many things that}} can be saved such as energy, time, and cost of transportation. Nowadays, telemarketing has covered the world. The telephone can sell almost all products and merit. Supported by the available credit cards and WATS (<b>Wide</b> <b>Area</b> <b>Telephone</b> <b>Service),</b> the customer of telemarketing gets the glory. Since the writer is concerned with telemarketing as a new teaching material of ESP, the objectives of this writing are: 1. Suggesting an appropriate course design about English for Telemarketing. 2. Suggesting a suitable material for English for telemarketing. In order to achieve the objectives, the writer intends to develop a course design and its teaching materials for English for Telemarketing. This thesis consists of two levels of materials. The first level consists of eleven units theories and example of telemarketing activities. The second level consists of seven units, five units exercises and practices, a unit is on job training activities, and a unit is paper writing. Each level is planned for six months teaching learning activities. This thesis is given for the university students and he teachers. The writer hopes this suggested course design and materials of English for Telemarketing could be useful both for teachers and students who are interested in the telemarketing. Besides, the writer hopes that it will help the learners to handle the telemarketing’s problems...|$|E
