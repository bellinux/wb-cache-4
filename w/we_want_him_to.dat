500|$|In February 2011, Isaacs {{was cast}} {{in the role of}} Michael Britten, the central {{character}} of the series. Gordon summarized the character: [...] "He's a guy who goes to sleep, wakes up, he's with his wife, goes to sleep, wakes up, and he's with his son. [...] And so—and he's a cop who sees clues and details that crossover from one world to the next, and he uses that insight to solve crimes." [...] " [...] was somebody that you couldn't decide if you liked or hated, and I think that 's dilemma is something that we're not only sympathetic for, but somehow <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> win." [...] Producers of the show initially approached Michaela McManus to play Hannah Britten. However, Laura Allen {{was cast in}}stead; McManus obtained the role of Tara (for which Allen originally auditioned).|$|E
500|$|In February 2011, Jason Isaacs {{obtained}} {{the role of}} Michael Britten, the central character of the series.

[...] And so—and he's a cop who sees clues and details that crossover from one world to the next, and he uses that insight to solve crimes." [...] Killen thought that the premise behind the series would be relatable to audiences, making it easier to expand his fanbase. [...] "I think there were aspects of Lone Star that were more difficult to get a wider, broader audience interested in," [...] he articulated.

2500|$|Monkees co-creator Bob Rafelson {{commented that}} Jones [...] "deserves {{a lot of}} credit, let me tell you. He may not have lived as long as <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> <b>to,</b> but he survived about seven lifetimes, {{including}} being perhaps the biggest rock star of his time." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "Since the {{economic}} {{value of the}} Pole for us is through the tilling of our farms, it is fortunate that the Pole himself likes the farm and shows himself ready to fall in with the plans already made for him.

2500|$|Luke's coming-out story {{garnered}} praise in the {{gay community}} and an award from the gay-rights group Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD). Hansis and the actress who portrayed his mother (Martha Byrne) appeared in public service announcements on CBS. Tharrington said that due to Luke's storyline being successful, the writers eventually added Noah. [...] "Everyone in the town came to accept Luke as he was, and the viewers did, too," [...] she elaborated.

5000|$|Crowe noted, [...] "We {{wanted to}} do two things for the player. One, <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> feel as if he were in a movie, where he could just sort of kick back and enjoy the scenery. <b>We</b> also <b>wanted</b> the player to feel as if he really was the {{character}} on the screen." ...|$|R
5000|$|In September 2009, Danny Wilson {{issued a}} [...] "hands off" [...] warning as rumours {{circulated}} that recently relegated Norwich City were tabling an offer for McNamee.

2500|$|In an April 2011 {{interview}} with George Stephanopoulos, Obama said, [...] "I think {{that over the}} last {{two and a half years}} there's been an effort to go at me in a way that is politically expedient in the short-term for Republicans, but creates, I think a problem for them when they want to actually run in a general election where most people feel pretty confident the President was born where he says he was, in Hawaii. He doesn't have horns. We may disagree with him on some issues and we may wish that you know, the unemployment rate was coming down faster and <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> know his plan on gas prices.

2500|$|Because of his {{experience}} in earlier demonstrations against the Mubarak government, el-Hamalawy {{was one of the}} first participants and organizers of the Egyptian Revolution that commenced on 25 January 2011. On that first day of protest, el-Hamalawy stated to Al-Jazeera that the demonstrations were [...] "necessary to send a message to the Egyptian regime that Mubarak is no different than Ben Ali and <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> leave too." [...] Tunisian president Zine el-Abedine Ben Ali had been previously overthrown on January 18 as a result of mass popular protests against his government.

If Mubarak is not overthrown tomorrow then it will be the day after. If it's not the day after it's going to be next week." [...] Mubarak resigned from his post on 11 February, transferring his authority to the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF).|$|E

60|$|Orlick, {{without a}} doubt! She {{had lost his}} name, and could only signify him by his hammer. We told <b>him</b> why <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> come into the kitchen, and he slowly laid down his hammer, wiped his brow with his arm, took another wipe at it with his apron, and came slouching out, with a curious loose {{vagabond}} bend in the knees that strongly distinguished him.|$|R
6000|$|... '"But <b>we</b> don't <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> begin that way," [...] the Lady Esclairmonde said. [...] "We intend {{a splendid}} fortune for him--not your flitter-by-night, hedge-jumping, gipsy-work." ...|$|R

Further <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> go as our representative." ...|$|R
5000|$|The film is {{completely}} live action, with animation overlay in some scenes provided by Jeffrey James and Huhu Studios in New Zealand and Shanghai. Director Jon Binkowski said “We wanted the animation to {{that would make}} the kid’s talent show through, but a little amateurish because he character Tucker didn’t have the tools yet. <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> be a young Lasseter.

60|$|THE {{doctor was}} an old man; a very nice, kind-looking old man when I got him up. I told him {{me and my brother}} was over on Spanish Island hunting {{yesterday}} afternoon, and camped on a piece of a raft we found, and about midnight he must a kicked his gun in his dreams, for it went off and shot him in the leg, and <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> go over there and fix it and not say nothing about it, nor let anybody know, because <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> to come home this evening and surprise the folks.|$|R

6000|$|... "It isn't much <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> say, miss," [...] Hefferom {{answered}} doggedly, [...] "but there's {{a question}} he's got to answer.

6000|$|... "If {{you will}} do that, Mr. Crabtree, I'll make it well worth your while," [...] responded Dick, quickly. [...] "I may as well admit to you that we wish {{to get hold of}} Mr. Pelter as soon as possible. <b>We</b> <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> clear up a certain transaction.

5000|$|After the race, Zayat commented: [...] "I said it {{once and}} more than once that this race was only about American Pharoah - <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> go out as a winner just for the horse. He had run so hard and brilliantly {{for such a long}} time. I doubt we will ever see a horse who is able to take what he has done in terms of {{shipping}} in and out and going to seven or eight different tracks. He doesn't care about the surface or where he is sitting, he just does it all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{had better}} write a line for him, mademoiselle. It was from chance that I {{happened}} to be in the hall when he rang; and <b>we</b> don't <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> come in to be stared at by Francois while you write an answer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{tell you}} how it occurred. Everybody in France, you know, dines at the ordinary--it's quite distangy to do so.

6000|$|... "No. We both think it's {{best to be}} {{here when}} Alan gets back. <b>We</b> <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> go down with us." [...] Bessie had seldom spoken openly with Mary Enderby about her brother; but that was rather from Mary's {{shrinking}} than her own; she knew that everybody understood his case. She went so far now as to say: [...] "He's ever {{so much better than}} he has been. We have such hopes of him, if he can keep well, when he gets back this time." ...|$|E
6000|$|They were {{standing}} on their horses {{at the entrance to}} the wool-shed as they discussed the point, when suddenly Harry himself appeared out of the building. He came up and shook hands with Medlicot, with sufficient courtesy, but hardly with cordiality, and then asked his wife as to her ride. [...] "We have been very jolly, haven't we, Kate? Of course it has been hot, but every thing is not so frightfully parched as it was before the rain. As Mr. Medlicot has come back so far with us, <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> come on and dine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very true; I had {{not thought}} of that. You are to make all speed, and go direct to Master Revere's. Say to him that George Messerve, who has been {{appointed}} distributor of the tax stamps for New Hampshire, will arrive in Boston shortly, if, indeed, he is not already there. Tell Master Revere that the feeling in our section grows stronger against this last imposition every day, until there is danger lest the excesses which marked the 26th of August in Boston may be repeated here. He will {{understand what it is}} <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> do." ...|$|E

5000|$|Ian didn't {{really want}} to play guitar, {{but for some reason}} <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> play it. I can't {{remember}} the reason now ... I think Ian used to play only on [...] "Love Will Tear Us Apart" ... no I'm wrong, there was another track too. Maybe [...] "Heart and Soul"? I do remember Ian used to play just one chord, which was D. We showed <b>him</b> how <b>to</b> play D and we wrote a song. I wonder if that's why we wrote [...] "Love Will Tear Us Apart", you could drone a D through it. I think he played it live because I was playing keyboards. On the record I played guitar, a twelve string Eko guitar, an Italian guitar that actually sounded pretty good.|$|R
50|$|Chubb {{was sure}} that God heard all our petitionary prayers, {{but he did not}} think God {{answered}} all of them in the way <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> <b>to.</b> God answered only some of our prayers, and only if they were for lawful things and we prayed earnestly “with a modest resignation to God’s will.”vi Chubb thought that God sometimes gave us harmful things we prayed for, but then God acted “in displeasure.” In another tract, he was more pessimistic about God's positive response rate to our prayers. He cited evidence that God did not often answer our prayers: over the last two hundred years, millions of sincere, fervent prayers had petitioned God for the defeat of the Antichrist, but the Roman Catholic hierarchy or other interests bent on defeating God's kingdom still existed.|$|R
