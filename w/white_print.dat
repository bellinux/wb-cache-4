25|$|The first {{direct ascent}} of the Italian (south-west) ridge {{as it is}} climbed today was by J. J. and J. P. Maquignaz on September 13, 1867. Julius Elliott made the second ascent via the Hörnli (north-east) ridge in 1868, and later that year the party of John Tyndall, J. J. and J. P. Maquignaz {{was the first to}} {{traverse}} the summit by way of the Hörnli and Italian ridges. On August 22, 1871, while wearing a <b>white</b> <b>print</b> dress, Lucy Walker became the first woman to reach the summit of the Matterhorn, followed a few weeks later by her rival Meta Brevoort. The first winter ascent of the Hörnli ridge was by Vittorio Sella with guides J. A. Carrel, J. B. Carrel and L. Carrel on March 17, 1882, and its first solo ascent was made by W. Paulcke in 1898. The first winter solo ascent of the Hörnli ridge was by G. Gervasutti in 1936.|$|E
500|$|Fingerprint {{recovery}} {{from the surface of}} firearms is done with cyanoacrylate (more commonly known as superglue) fuming. Firearms are placed in a specially designed fume hood designed to evenly distribute fumes instead of removing them. Liquid superglue is placed in a container and heated until it is in a gaseous state. The circulating fumes adhere to the oils left behind by the fingerprint, turning the print white. The resulting <b>white</b> <b>print</b> can be enhanced with fingerprint powder to increase the contrast of the <b>white</b> <b>print</b> against the weapon's finish. While using the fuming technique on recovered guns is commonplace, the recovery of fingerprints from the surfaces of a firearm is challenging due to the textured grip and the general condition of recovered weapons. [...] If fingerprints are recovered, they can be processed through fingerprint databases such as the Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System (IAFIS). Various parts of the recovered weapon can also be tested for touch DNA left by whomever handled it. However, the low levels of DNA that can be recovered presents numerous issues such as contamination and analysis anomalies such as allele drop-out and drop-in.|$|E

The film was commercially {{released}} in the United States and Canada on November 21, 2007; it performed well {{at the box office}} and received generally positive reviews.

2500|$|In September 2007, WMMS {{management}} {{chose to}} [...] "de-emphasize" [...] both the Buzzard and WMMS call letters, {{referring to the}} station as simply [...] "100.7", save for the FCC-mandated legal ID {{at the top of}} every hour. [...] Regarding the change, WMMS program director Bo Matthews (Alex Gutierrez) said, [...] "… nobody's killing anything... Chief Wahoo is not on every piece of Indians promotional material... Ronald McDonald is not in every McDonald's commercial... We're not losing the letters. All we're doing is shifting an image." [...] By April 2008, the station had reverted to its traditional branding, once again frequently making use of both the noted mascot and famed call letters. [...] The current WMMS logo displays orange wings on the sides of a weathered black road sign similar to a U.S. Route shield, with <b>white</b> <b>print</b> reading [...] "", while the Buzzard is also again prominently featured - being used in recent years to help promote the station's sports coverage via WMMS' status as the FM flagship station for the Indians and Cavaliers.|$|E
60|$|The door of {{this was}} firmly locked; but a big hole had been torn in the roof by bears, and I crawled in by that entrance. Mooween had been here many times ahead of me. Every corner of the big room, the bunks and the {{cupboards}} and even the stove, had been ransacked {{from one end to}} the other; and the strong, doggy smell of a bear was everywhere, showing how recently he had searched the place. Here in a corner a large tin box had been wrenched open, and flour was scattered over the floor and deacon-seat, as if a whirlwind had struck the place. Mooween was playful evidently; or perhaps he was mad that the stuff for which he had taken so much trouble was too dry to eat. The <b>white</b> <b>print</b> of one paw was drawn everywhere on the floor and walls. This was the paw of a little bear, who had undoubtedly come late, and had to be content with what the others had left.|$|E
