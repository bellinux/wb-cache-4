40|$|The {{idea for}} an annual Our Places Tell Stories conference was {{prompted}} by discussions that took place within a unique partnership of federal, state, university, and public organizations in southern Nevada. Members identified the need to share and learn from successful educational and interpretive strategies. Our increasingly urban surroundings and rapidly changing populations hinder personal connections between people and their natural environment. However, the right tools and techniques will help us inspire children and adults to understand, value, {{and take care of}} our shared natural places. This first conference supports professionals in creating and evaluating effective educational programs and interpretive media that connect our audiences with their natural surroundings. The conference features thought-provoking presentations, effective technique modeling, and collaboration building—all centered on maximizing effectiveness when we make connections with our audiences. <b>We</b> <b>appreciate</b> <b>your</b> <b>time</b> and commitment in attending the Our Places Tell Stories conference.
