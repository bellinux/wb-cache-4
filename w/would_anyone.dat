25|$|Mercati {{posed the}} {{question}} to himself, why <b>would</b> <b>anyone</b> prefer to manufacture artifacts of stone rather than of metal, a superior material? His answer was that metallurgy was unknown at that time. He cited Biblical passages to prove that in Biblical times stone was the first material used. He also revived the 3-age system of Lucretius, which described a succession of periods based {{on the use of}} stone (and wood), bronze and iron respectively. Due to lateness of publication, Mercati's ideas were already being developed independently; however, his writing served as a further stimulus.|$|E
25|$|The {{operation}} did {{not bring}} about the desired success; for instance, on occasions when troops found a tunnel, they would often underestimate its size. Rarely <b>would</b> <b>anyone</b> be sent in to search the tunnels, as it was so hazardous. The tunnels were often rigged with explosive booby traps or punji stick pits. The two main responses in dealing with a tunnel opening were to flush the entrance with gas, water or hot tar to force the Viet Cong soldiers into the open, or to toss a few grenades down the hole and “crimp” off the opening. This approach proved ineffective due {{to the design of}} the tunnels and the strategic use of trap doors and air filtration systems.|$|E
500|$|Rene Guerra {{served as}} {{district}} attorney in Hidalgo County from the 1980s until 2014. Guerra elected not to bring the case {{before a grand jury}} until 2004. Tacheny, O'Brien and Feit did not receive subpoenas in the case, and the grand jury declined to indict Feit. O'Brien died in 2005. Guerra was reluctant to revisit the case, saying that the early police investigation had been shoddy, that O'Brien was suffering from dementia when he was questioned, {{and that there was no}} physical evidence. He said that Jaramillo had inappropriately fed Tacheny the location of the murder after the monk mistakenly said it occurred in San Antonio. Guerra angered Garza's family by asking, [...] "Why <b>would</b> <b>anyone</b> be haunted by her death? She died. Her killer got away." ...|$|E

500|$|In late 1987, Landy and Wilson became {{creative}} {{partners in}} a company called [...] "Brains and Genius", a business venture where each member would contribute equally and share any profits from recordings, films, soundtracks, or books. Landy was then credited as co-writer and executive producer for Wilson's eponymous solo album released in 1988. Co-producer Russ Titelman disparaged {{his role in the}} album's creation, calling him disruptive and [...] "anti-creative". Brian's cousin and bandmate Mike Love denied Landy's claims that the Beach Boys were preventing Brian from participating on their recordings, commenting: [...] "Why <b>would</b> <b>anyone</b> bother with us, his thinking apparently went, when the only Beach Boy who mattered was recording and performing on his own? I finally saw Landy for what he was. His goal was not to drive a wedge between Brian and us. It was to destroy us. Then he would be the sole custodian of Brian's career and legacy." ...|$|E
500|$|Originally, Descent 3 was {{intended}} to support both a software and a hardware renderer, implying that the rendering process of the game could take place either in the CPU or dedicated hardware like a video card. However, about six months after starting development, the team decided {{to go with a}} hardware-only renderer because it allowed them to create [...] "visually stunning" [...] graphics and maintain a solid frame rate without worrying about the limitations imposed by the software renderer. This was a difficult decision since the team had to scrap many tools and software rendering technology that were already developed. In addition, computers with hardware acceleration were not common at the time the decision was made. As the developers noted, [...] "We knew just by looking at our progress on the game under acceleration that we had a beautiful looking game with all the latest technologies — but <b>would</b> <b>anyone</b> actually be able to play it?" [...] Fortunately, as development progressed, hardware acceleration became more popular with each passing year. The game natively supports the Direct3D, Glide and OpenGL rendering APIs for graphics, and the A3D and DirectSound3D technologies for sound.|$|E
500|$|... "Castle Walls" [...] {{lasts for}} a {{duration}} of 5:29 (five minutes and twenty nine seconds) {{and is a}} hip hop and electro song. The song features a Europop keyboard in its arrangement. Nathan Rabin from The A.V. Club wrote that the lyrics of [...] "Castle Walls" [...] "offer similarly incisive and only occasionally self-pitying commentary on the tragedy and triumph of being young, black, rich, famous, and a repeat felon." [...] The song begins with the chorus, in which Aguilera sings, [...] "Everyone thinks that I have it all / But it's so empty living behind these castle walls (These castle walls) / If I should tumble if I should fall/ <b>Would</b> <b>anyone</b> hear me screaming behind these castle walls? / There's no one here at all, behind these castle walls." [...] After the chorus, T.I. raps the verse [...] "See with the Phantoms and Ferraris in the driveway / But you see it came in exchange of a sane man's sanity / Your vision jaded by the Grammys on the mantlepiece / Just switch your camera lenses, {{you will see the}} agony" [...] over a [...] "warbling" [...] electronic background and hip hop beats. Towards the song's conclusion, there is a [...] "sad" [...] string arrangement and an electronica-influenced [...] "triumphantly striding beat." [...] An editor from HipHopDX compared [...] "Castle Walls" [...] to [...] "Love the Way You Lie" [...] by Eminem featuring Rihanna, which was also produced by da Kid.|$|E

500|$|Despite being heavily {{associated}} with firearms in his Westerns and police movies, Eastwood has publicly endorsed gun control {{since at least}} 1973. In the April 24, 1973, edition of The Washington Post, the star said, [...] "I'm for gun legislation myself. I don't hunt." [...] Two years later, in 1975, Eastwood told People magazine that he favors [...] "gun control to some degree." [...] About a year later, Eastwood remarked that [...] "All guns should be registered. I don't think legitimate gun owners would mind that kind of legislation. Right now the furor against a gun law is by gun owners who are overreacting. They're worried that all guns {{are going to be}} recalled. It's impossible to take guns out of circulation, and that's why firearms should be registered and mail-order delivery of guns halted." [...] In 1993, he noted that he [...] "...was always a backer" [...] of the Brady Bill, with its federally mandated waiting period. In 1995, Eastwood questioned the purpose of assault weapons. Larry King, the television host and newspaper columnist, wrote in the May 22, 1995, edition of USA Today that [...] "my interview with Eastwood will air on 'Larry King Weekend'... I asked him his thoughts on the NRA and gun control and he said that while people think of him as pro-gun, he has always been in favor of controls. 'Why <b>would</b> <b>anyone</b> need or want an assault weapon?' he said." ...|$|E
500|$|The Terrible Towel is {{traditionally}} {{known as the}} first [...] "rally towel"; its popularity has spawned similar traditions for other teams. Fans of the Minnesota Twins cheer {{the team with the}} [...] "Homer Hanky" [...] during the playoffs. The Philadelphia Phillies have distributed white towels to fans during home games. During a 2006 playoff game against the Steelers, the Indianapolis Colts handed out blue towels to rally fans, however, Pittsburgh {{went on to win the}} game. In a 2000 preseason game, played in Mexico City, many fans that filled the 100,000 seat Aztec Stadium waved towels. Cope, glad that the Allegheny Valley School would receive a sizable donation from the proceeds, was later disappointed to learn the towels waved by the fans were [...] "knockoffs" [...] made by local artists, and therefore no proceeds would go to the school. In 2008, the NFL approved a white towel entitled the Trophy Towel, which will be sold to fans and given to the winning team of Super Bowl XLIII. Members of the Steelers criticized the idea, broadcaster Bill Hillgrove—who worked with Cope—called the idea [...] "a cheap imitation." [...] Steelers player Aaron Smith stated, [...] "It started here, so why <b>would</b> <b>anyone</b> else want to have a towel? Why not kazoos?" [...] During the 2010 Memorial Cup the host committee made up 8,000 yellow towels to represent the host team, the Brandon Wheat Kings, who played the Moncton Wildcats. Many fans brought the towels back for games after that. [...] Waving white rally towels has the unfortunate distinction of resembling surrender by waving a white flag (citation needed).|$|E
500|$|The episode {{introduced}} Tony Sawicki, a trans man {{and another}} clone played by Maslany. The character was first imagined by Manson and Fawcett {{during the development}} of the show's first season; they thought that introducing a transgender clone character would be [...] "very tied to the themes of our show about identity" [...] and would fit well with the previous season's themes of gender and sexuality. When they approached Maslany with the idea {{at the end of the}} first season, she told them that she had already thought about playing a transgender character herself. It took the show's creators longer than with any other character to develop and refine Tony's personality and wardrobe, the entire process taking six months. In preparation for the part, Maslany researched and met with transgender people and grew out her underarm hair for six weeks, although she eventually had to shave her underarms to attend an awards ceremony before the episode was filmed. The new character was kept secret from most of the crew until scripts for the episode were distributed, and the show's hair and makeup department trialled different looks for Tony on Maslany's days off and weekends so that other members of the crew would not see her in Tony's costume. Tony's final look was created by Stephen Lynch, Sandy Sokolowski and Debra Hanson, in the show's makeup, hair and wardrobe departments, respectively. Manson, Fawcett and Maslany sought advice from GLAAD on how to best go about introducing a transgender character. In response to the perception that Tony's introduction had created [...] "a minefield of sexual politics", Fawcett said that that had not been the writers' intention; rather, their aim was to [...] "just throw this character in there and treat them like a normal human being like we <b>would</b> <b>anyone</b> else on the show".|$|E
