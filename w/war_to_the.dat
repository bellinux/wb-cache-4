5|$|During World War I over 421,809 Australians {{served in}} the {{military}} with 331,781 serving overseas. Over 60,000 Australians lost their lives and 137,000 were wounded. As a percentage of forces committed, this equalled a casualty rate of almost 65 per cent, one of the highest casualty rates amongst the British Empire forces. The financial cost of the <b>war</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Australian government was £188,480,000.|$|E

Juskalian also volunteered in local schools. He continuously stressed the importance of public service and shared many of his experiences with students.|$|E

5|$|The University {{closed its}} doors during the Philippine Revolution of 1896 {{because of the}} ensuing disorder.

5|$|The war was one {{of several}} near {{simultaneous}} wars waged by the Mongol Empire and the Yuan dynasty in the late 13th century. Though it was never more than a minor frontier <b>war</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Mongols, the war set off a series of enduring developments in Burma. The invasions ushered in a period of political fragmentation, and the rise of Tai-Shan states throughout mainland Southeast Asia.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} {{conflicts}} occurred between the Empire and its neighbors. Brazil experienced no serious conflicts {{with its neighbors}} {{to the north and}} west, due to the buffer of the nearly impenetrable and sparsely populated Amazonian rainforest. In the south, however, the colonial disputes inherited from Portugal and Spain over the control of the navigable rivers and plains which formed the frontiers continued after independence. The lack of mutually agreed borders in this area led to several international conflicts, from the Cisplatine <b>War</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Paraguayan War.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the terms}} of the Treaty of Versailles, all four Helgoland-class battleships were {{disarmed}} and surrendered as prizes of <b>war</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Allies as replacements for the ships scuttled in Scapa Flow. On 21–22 November 1918, Helgoland steamed to Harwich to retrieve the crews of U-boats that had been surrendered there. She was then removed from active service on 16December 1918. Helgoland and her sisters were stricken from the German navy on 5November 1919. Helgoland was formally handed over to the United Kingdom on 5August 1920. She was scrapped at Morecambe; work began on 3March 1921. Helgolands coat of arms is currently preserved in the Military History Museum of the Bundeswehr in Dresden.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, the Main Roads Department focused its {{activities}} on the war effort. Roads in rural areas deteriorated, especially after the Pearl Harbour attack brought the <b>war</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Pacific, and only the most urgent maintenance works were authorised on roads for civilian purposes. Following the war, Main Roads returned to its usual operations, repairing and maintaining the road network. The rural road network expanded in the 1950s, with Main Roads both repairing the worst segments of its roads, through numerous small jobs, and assisting local governments to seal their roads. Such activity was spurred on by the closure of railway lines {{in addition to the}} establishment of new land settlements.|$|E

50|$|At {{the outset}} of the Civil <b>War,</b> Westerners looked <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Civil <b>War</b> <b>to</b> settle <b>the</b> {{question}} of slavery in their territories.

5|$|Hostilities between Rome and Parthia were renewed when Osroes I of Parthia (r. c.109–128AD) deposed the Armenian king Tiridates and {{replaced}} him with Axidares, son of Pacorus II, without consulting Rome. The Roman emperor Trajan (r.98–117AD) had the next Parthian nominee for the throne, Parthamasiris, killed in 114AD, instead making Armenia a Roman province. His forces, led by Lusius Quietus, also captured Nisibis; its occupation {{was essential to}} securing all the major routes across the northern Mesopotamian plain. The following year, Trajan invaded Mesopotamia and met little resistance from only Meharaspes of Adiabene, since Osroes was engaged in a civil <b>war</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east with Vologases III of Parthia. Trajan spent the winter of 115–116 at Antioch, but resumed his campaign in the spring. Marching down the Euphrates, he captured Dura-Europos, the capital Ctesiphon and Seleucia, and even subjugated Characene, where he watched ships depart to India from the Persian Gulf.|$|E
5|$|No. 11 Group was {{relocated}} to RAF Martlesham Heath in 1958, when control of RAF Hillingdon passed from Fighter Command to RAF Technical Training Command {{and the entire}} site became known as RAF Uxbridge. The RAF School of Education moved into Hillingdon House from RAF Spitalgate on 10 November. Southern Region Air Traffic Services HQ and the Royal Observer Corps' South East Communications Centre moved into the house in 1960. On 1 November, the Southern Region Air Traffic Services headquarters moved into Hillingdon House. The station had been home {{since the end of}} the <b>war</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> London Area Control Centre, renamed the London Air Traffic Control Centre in 1948 and the Uxbridge Air Traffic Control Centre in 1957. This eventually transferred to RAF West Drayton, which operated as a satellite station of RAF Uxbridge. HQ Military Air Traffic Operations (HQ MATO) moved into Hillingdon House in January 1965.|$|E
5|$|OTU squadrons, {{according}} to GOC Bowhill, {{should have been}} prepared to deliver an output of three crews per month for torpedo and fighter squadrons and two for General Reconnaissance units. Only at this point did the Air Ministry revise its policy. They did so, however, in a manner which indicated it still did not appreciate {{the problems of the}} Command. Bomber Command had received several months of 'working up' and breathing space from the declaration of <b>war</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> German invasion of Western Europe, but Coastal Command had not. Furthermore, Bomber Command was given permission to merge several new squadrons into OTUs. It seemed as if Bomber Command was still receiving better treatment.|$|E

5|$|On 3 November British {{warships}} bombarded outer forts in the Dardanelles. Two {{days later}} the United Kingdom extended a declaration of <b>war</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Ottoman Empire, as did France. Due to these attacks, there was a common impression in Britain that Churchill had brought the Ottomans into the war. Prime Minister Lloyd George held this belief for several years to come. In the meantime, Churchill tried to promote {{the advantages of the}} conflict, such as the possibility of territorial gains in the Middle East (the reason that would ultimately bring Italy and Balkans nations like Greece into the war). The Ottoman government finally declared war on the Triple Entente on 11 November. Three days later Ottoman Sultan Mehmed V called for a Jihad campaign by Sunni and Shia Muslims against the Western powers.|$|E
5|$|Ptolemy II Philadelphus, {{emperor of}} Ptolemaic Egypt, may have forged an {{alliance}} with the Lihyanites {{in order to secure}} the incense route at Dedan, thereby rerouting the incense trade from Dedan to the coast along the Red Sea to Egypt.

Shrewsbury's Copthorne Barracks, spiritual home of the Light Division, still houses the Headquarters of the British Army's 143 (West Midlands) Brigade, while that of the 5th Division disbanded in April 2012 as part of the reorganisation of the Army's Support Command.|$|E
