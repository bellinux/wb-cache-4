We, however, are not a judge or a jury and don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> any time soon. We are however a band that really just wants to continue playing music. We know that these times have been severely trying for Dominic and the accuser. We hope for the best outcome for all parties. However, Dominic will no longer be playing music or working on behalf of Love Equals Death. This matter that he faces requires all of his attention right now and we wish him well as I know all of you do.|$|E

In 1959, Macdonald and Lewis Davidson, a bagpipe director at the Carnegie Institute of Technology, started the Ligonier Highland Games, a Scottish highland games event held at the park. During the same year that he assumed control of the park, Macdonald was appointed as the first commissioner of the Scottish Clan Donald for Pennsylvania. The games, held annually in early September after the park had closed for the summer, became {{one of the largest and}} most highly regarded Scottish athletic and cultural competitions in the country. Jack Macdonald said of the Games: [...] "We're not interested in becoming one of the biggest Games. We just <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> of the nicest." ...|$|E

500|$|During {{recording}} sessions, Higgs {{suffered from}} depression. He {{referred to the}} end of their 150-date tour as [...] "an out-of-the-sauna-and-into-a-cold-bath experience", adding that [...] "riding that low as well as trying to make a record was quite hard". He was affected by frequent mood swings {{as a result of his}} medication; Pritchard said that these [...] "affected [...] pretty adversely". Drummer, Michael Spearman, explained to Q that Higgs's attempt to channel his depression into his writing worried the rest of the group. At one point during writing sessions, Higgs presented his bandmates with [...] "Pigdog", a song about [...] "how [...] a horrible person and [...] <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> any more".

500|$|Following on from season two, {{the series}} {{continues}} {{to follow the}} characters' lives in the wealthy community of Newport Beach, Orange County, California, with the main characters entering their final year of high school.

He added that [...] "graduating from high school is such a sentimental moment for kids and parents. It's something we knew we wanted to mine and explore." [...] The season revolves around Ryan Atwood's savior complex causing trouble, and Seth Cohen's lies posing problems in his relationship with Summer Roberts. Seth's mother Kirsten attends rehab in an attempt to put her life back together, while her husband Sandy assumes leadership of the Newport Group after Caleb Nichol's death and finds himself the heir-apparent to a legacy of scandal, and Marissa Cooper spirals out of control after her younger sister Kaitlin causes trouble on her return home from boarding school.

He's got that sort of jungle essence that one can sense... When we look at each other, it's like our eyes have fingers and they grab ahold....

And I didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> of those guys, {{but a lot of people}} thought that it was the right time -- and it did turn out to be that.

2500|$|Charlotte de Sauve {{has been}} {{credited}} {{as a source}} of the information that led to the execution of Marguerite de Valois's lover Joseph Boniface de La Môle and Annibal de Coconnas for engaging in a conspiracy to overthrow the gravely ill Charles IX and the Queen Mother in 1574 with the assistance of Huguenot troops. In 1575, Catherine de' Medici, abetted by her son Henry III, instructed Charlotte to seduce the king's brother, her youngest son, François, Duke of Alençon, with the aim of provoking hostility between the two young men, so that they would not conspire together in the future. Charlotte subsequently became the duke's mistress, creating a rift between the former close friends, as Navarre and Alençon became rivals over Charlotte. According to Marguerite's memoirs: [...] "Charlotte de Sauve treated both of them [...] {{in such a way that}} they became extremely jealous of each other, to such a point that they forgot their ambitions, their duties and their plans and thought of nothing but chasing after this woman". Henry of Navarre wrote to a friend: [...] "The court is the strangest I have ever known. We are nearly always ready to cut each other's throat ... All the band you know wants my death on account of my love for Monsieur [...] and they have forbidden for the third time my mistress [...] to speak to me. They have such a hold on her that she does not dare look at me. I am waiting for a minor battle, for they say they will kill me, and I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> jump ahead of them". On one occasion, Henry III had Alençon's papers searched for evidence of political plotting but turned up only a declaration of love from Madame de Sauve.|$|E
2500|$|Ringer was not {{selected}} in the first 4 rounds of the draft, where he was projected to go by some. Instead, Ringer was selected by the Tennessee Titans in the 5th round of the 2009 NFL Draft, 173rd overall, the 11th RB taken overall. At the time of being drafted, {{he was one of}} eight Running Backs on the Titans roster. Terry McCormick of the Nashville City Paper, when grading the Titans draft, gave the Ringer pick an [...] "A". Ringer said on his Twitter page about being drafted “Titans! I can’t tell you how excited I am!”. He was the first (and only) MSU player drafted this year. Ringer said of his future pro career, [...] "I definitely have something to prove with me showing that I am just as good, if not better, than a lot of the running backs that went above me. I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> of those running backs who is titled as, He was a good running back in college and went to the NFL and became a bust. I want to make sure I continue to be called a great running back also in the NFL." [...] He mentioned of where he would fit in, [...] "I would say I fit in pretty well. I know Chris Johnson is kind of like the super-fast one, and LenDale White is like the really big one. I would kind of be in the middle." [...] Ringer is expected to [...] play special teams and operate as a third-down back. Ringer said of the running back situation in Tennessee, [...] "I feel very confident in my abilities. I feel like I'm definitely going to learn a lot from the vets. I'm very happy to be in a room with LenDale White and Chris Johnson. I'm going to make sure to play my role and push them in practice. I'm also going to make sure I ... continue to do what I can do to help Tennessee." [...] Because 23 was taken by Donnie Nickey, Ringer was assigned #3, a number normally prohibited for use by running backs. He kept the number until early August, when he switched to number 21.|$|E
