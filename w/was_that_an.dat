5|$|A typical P. exclamans worker {{will live}} somewhere between 14–16 days. The oldest wasp to be {{observed}} in a natural colony was 102 days old. Queens typically live 6 times longer than the workers. There has been some variation observed with the life expectancy of P. exclamans. This has typically been attributed to the colony of origin. It also {{must be noted that}} while there is variation between colonies, there typically is less variation between the original nest and the satellite nest. Variation inside a single colony may also occur {{because of the presence of}} different castes. Foragers, those who frequently travel outside the nest, lead a riskier life and tend to have lower life expectancy than those who stay in the nest. Though, it was observed that colonies with high foraging rates also had higher reproductive rates to compensate for the lower life expectancy. Another interesting aspect that was observed in one nest <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> increase in female population led to lower longevity. This was because the females were more focused on competing to become the next queen than foraging and fulfilling their roles.|$|E
5|$|The {{electric}} {{fire engine}} would have several advantages over the steam fire engine. One <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> electric fire engine {{could be brought}} eto full power immediately, whereas a steam fire engine took time. It was necessary to keep the fire going {{all the time to}} boil the water on a steam pump vehicle, with workmen furnishing coal for it. This was required so that as little time as possible was lost getting the water to boil to produce steam to run the water pump to extinguish the fire. In the case of an electric motor running a fire engine water pump, its operation was basically instantaneous since the motor was running at full power capacity when the switch was turned on. The advantage of using electricity was its lower cost overall, (i.e. no coal or extensive maintenance) and simplicity of operation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract I aim to {{show that}} {{standard}} theories of counterfactuals are mistaken, not in detail, but in principle, and I aim to say what form a tenable theory must take. Standard theories entail a categorical interpretation of counterfactuals, on which to state <b>that,</b> if it <b>were</b> <b>that</b> <b>A,</b> it would <b>be</b> <b>that</b> C <b>is</b> to state something, not relative to any supposition or hypothesis, but categorically. On the rival suppositional interpretation, to state <b>that,</b> if it <b>were</b> <b>that</b> <b>A,</b> it would <b>be</b> <b>that</b> C <b>is</b> to state <b>that</b> it would <b>be</b> <b>that</b> C relative to the supposition <b>that</b> it <b>were</b> <b>that</b> <b>A.</b> The two interpretations make incompatible predictions concerning the correct evaluation of counterfactuals. I argue that the suppositional interpretation makes the correct prediction...|$|R

25|$|During {{the second}} world war Christchurch was again {{fortified}} against an expected invasion. The construction of pillboxes, gun emplacements and tank traps in and around the town, made Christchurch an 'anti-tank island'. The idea <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> invasion by the German 6th Army from Cherbourg would be unable to link up east to west so long as the town was able to hold out.|$|E
25|$|Another {{test was}} {{conducted}} by investigators. This time, they conducted the test to know if hydraulic fluids of Flight 420 would ignite when it contacted the hot surface of the brake assembly. Investigators used two kinds of hydraulic fluids; the contaminated and uncontaminated one. The result <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> intense fire broke out after it contacted with the hot surface. The test also revealed that the contaminated hydraulic fluids have lower ignition point than the uncontaminated one.|$|E

25|$|The {{proposal}} for the Halden Terminal arose shortly after 1980, while Halden Municipality was searching for new industrial lots. The concept <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> intermodal terminal would be built near Halden, in the area between Sørli and European Road E6 known as Sørlifeltet. Trucks would arrive from various locations in Sweden and have their cargo transshipped to trains. These would then run directly to other locations in Norway, bypassing Alnabru Freight Terminal in Oslo. At {{the same time the}} site would be used as the center of a new industrial park.|$|E
25|$|An Order could contain only {{negative}} prohibitions. It {{could not}} contain a positive obligation. To obtain an ASBO, a two-stage test {{had to be}} satisfied by the applicant authority (see s.1(1) Crime and Disorder Act 1998). The first test was that the defendant had committed acts causing or likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress within {{six months of the}} date of issue of the summons. The second test <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> order was necessary to protect persons from further anti-social behaviour.|$|E
25|$|During the Second World War it was {{the site}} of a {{tracking}} station for anti-aircraft gunnery practice. The set up <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> aircraft flew up and {{down in front of the}} guns, which would try to bring it down. Initially, radio-controlled 'Queen Bee' aircraft were used, and the flat concrete foundation by the white tower on the cairn, now the location of the Solway Harvester memorial stone, was laid down for one of the control huts. The memorial stone to the Solway Harvester is in the form of an anchor set in a granite block.|$|E

25|$|One <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> {{aircraft}} {{flying from}} Alaska to California would be flying right {{over some of}} the best developed shipping lanes available. By offloading as early as possible to some other mode of transport—tankers or pipelines—the amount of fuel burned would be greatly reduced. More importantly, this freed the aircraft to return to for another load more rapidly than if it flew all the way to California, meaning that a single aircraft could deliver more cargo in a given time. This had been noticed in the earlier studies, but the full impact had not been appreciated.|$|E
25|$|In 1888, William McGregor {{a gentleman}} from Perthshire and a {{director}} of Aston Villa F.C was the main force between meetings held in London and Manchester involving 12 football clubs, {{with an eye to}} a league competition. These 12 clubs would later become the Football League's 12 founder members. The meetings were held in London, the main concern <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> early exit in the knockout format of the FA Cup could leave clubs with no matches for almost a year, and if that happened, not only could they suffer heavy financial losses, but fans often didn't stick around for that long without a game, and instead went to other teams. Matters were finalised on 17 April in Manchester.|$|E
25|$|From the start, it {{was clear}} that Metellus Pius was no match for Sertorius, {{suffering}} repeated defeats through Sertorius’ use of guerrilla tactics. His legate Thorius, dispatched to come to the assistance of the governor of Hispania Citerior, Marcus Domitus Calvinus, was defeated by Sertorius (79 BC). After his unsuccessful push towards the Tagus in 79 BC, and suffering a defeat by Sertorius at Lacobriga in 78 BC, Pius was forced to ask for help from the governor of Gallia Transalpina, but he was defeated by Sertorius’ legate and unable to help. The end result <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> exhausted Pius was pushed out of his province of Hispania Ulterior.|$|E

25|$|At one point, Iowas Captain Evans {{directed}} Harvard {{to rescue}} prisoners. Some accounts {{suggest that it}} took 12 hours to rescue all the survivors. For a while, several American warships were crowded with prisoners, including Iowa. A pig was rescued from Colon. There were 1,612 Spanish survivors in total who became US prisoners of war until subsequent release during a prisoner exchange. It was a general victory for the US Navy. One unexpected circumstance <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> Austrian battleship (actually an armored cruiser) also named Maria Theresa was in the vicinity wanting to enter Santiago harbor, but upon outbreak of hostilities, waited for orders from the Americans after seeing the conflict; her presence caused mild confusion at some points, {{but there is no}} evidence that she was ever fired on.|$|E
25|$|Many Acadians {{might have}} signed an {{unconditional}} oath to the British monarchy had the circumstances been better, while other Acadians did not sign {{because they were}} clearly anti-British. For the Acadians who might have signed an unconditional oath, there were numerous reasons why they did not. The difficulty was partly religious, in that the British monarch {{was the head of}} the (Protestant) Church of England. Another significant issue <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> oath might commit male Acadians to fight against France during wartime. A related concern was whether their Mi'kmaq neighbours might perceive this as acknowledging the British claim to Acadia rather than the Mi'kmaq. As a result, signing an unconditional oath might have put Acadian villages in dangers of attack from Mi'kmaq.|$|E
25|$|The government's claim {{regarding}} the Statute of Westminster {{was based on}} two principal theories. The first {{was based on the}} repeal of the application of the Colonial Laws Validity Act to South Africa. The Colonial Laws Validity Act provided that any act of a colonial parliament would be valid within the colony unless it contradicted a British act applying to the colony. The argument <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> alteration of the Cape franchise without a two-thirds majority would have contradicted the South Africa Act (which was itself an act of the British Parliament) and therefore would be impermissible under the Colonial Laws Validity Act; and that once that act no longer applied the entrenchment was not enforceable. The court disagreed, noting that section 152 of the South Africa Act specifically empowered the South African Parliament to amend the South Africa Act, and that the Colonial Laws Validity Act had no application and therefore its repeal had no effect.|$|E

25|$|Throughout the 1990s {{and early}} 2000s, the SNP's policy <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> {{independent}} Scotland should adopt the euro, {{though this was}} relegated to a long-term rather than short-term goal by the party's 2009 conference. There was disagreement over whether Scotland {{would be required to}} join the euro if it wished to become an EU member state in its own right. All new members are required to commit to joining the single currency as a prerequisite of EU membership, but they must first be party to ERM II for two years, something that requires an own currency. The Scottish government argued that countries have a de facto opt-out from the euro because they are not obliged to join ERM II. For example, Sweden has not yet adopted the euro. The people of Sweden rejected adopting the euro in a 2003 referendum and its government has not joined by refusing to enter ERM II.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, Nancy Weiss Malkiel, the Dean of the College, {{implemented}} a grade deflation policy {{to curb the}} number of A-range grades undergraduates received. Malkiel's argument <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> A was beginning to lose its meaning as {{a larger percentage of}} the student body received them. While the number of A's has indeed decreased under the policy, many argue that this is hurting Princeton students when they apply to jobs or graduate school. Malkiel has said that she sent pamphlets to inform institutions about the policy so that they consider Princeton students equally, but students argue that Princeton graduates can apply to other institutions that know nothing about it. They argue further that as other schools purposefully inflate their grades, Princeton students' GPAs will look low by comparison. Further, studies have shown that employers prefer high grades even when they are inflated. The policy remained in place even after Malkiel stepped {{down at the end of}} the 2010–2011 academic term. The policy deflates grades only relative to their previous levels; indeed, as of 2009, or five years after the policy was instituted, the average graduating GPA saw a marginal decrease, from 3.46 to 3.39.|$|E
25|$|Pre-processing helped {{enhancing}} {{the quality of}} an image by filtering and removing unnecessary noises. The minutiae based algorithm only worked effectively in 8-bit gray scale fingerprint image. A reason <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> 8-bit gray fingerprint image was a fundamental base to convert the image to 1-bit image with value 0 for ridges and value 1 for furrows. As a result, the ridges were highlighted with black color while the furrows were highlighted with white color. This process partly removed some noises in an image and helped enhance the edge detection. Furthermore, there are two more steps to improve the best quality for the input image: minutiae extraction and false minutiae removal. The minutiae extraction {{was carried out by}} applying ridge thinning algorithm which was to remove redundant pixels of ridges. As a result, the thinned ridges of the fingerprint image are marked with a unique ID so that further operation can be conducted. After the minutiae extraction step, the false minutiae removal was also necessary. The lack of the amount of ink and the cross link among the ridges could cause false minutiae that led to inaccuracy in fingerprint recognition process.|$|E
