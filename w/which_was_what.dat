5|$|Winchelsey was a fearless {{opponent}} of Edward I. When he swore his oath of fealty to Edward, he offended the king {{by adding a}} declaration {{that he was only}} swearing fealty for the temporalities, not the spiritualities. All through his term as archbishop he refused to allow Edward to tax the clergy beyond certain levels, and withstood severe pressure to change his mind. In August 1295, he offered the king a tenth of all ecclesiastical revenues, less than Edward had hoped to collect from the clergy. Winchelsey did concede though that if the war with France, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> the money was requested to fund, continued into the following year, then the clergy would be amenable to making further contributions.|$|E
5|$|The Ottoman Empire {{demanded a}} total {{liquidation}} of the Cossack power. The Commonwealth, however, needed the Cossacks in the south-east, where they provided an effective buffer against Crimean Tatars incursions. The {{other way to}} quell the Cossack unrest would be to grant the nobility status to {{a substantial portion of}} their population and thus assimilate them into the Commonwealth's power structure, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> Cossacks aspired to. This solution was being rejected by the magnates and szlachta for political, economic and cultural reasons when there was still time for reform, before disasters struck. The Polish–Lithuanian establishment had instead shifted unsteadily between compromising with the Cossacks, allowing limited varying numbers, the so-called Cossack register (500 in 1582, 8000 in the 1630s), to serve with the Commonwealth army (the rest were to be converted into serfdom, to help the magnates in colonizing the Dnieper area), and brutally using military force in an attempt to subdue them.|$|E

25|$|On paper, it was {{a strong}} Indian team which {{included}} the likes of Mankad, Hazare, Amarnath and CS Nayudu. But these players never performed collectively, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> the Australians did. Don Bradman accumulated runs better than before, and his average in this series of 178.75 was nearly the double of his career average. He was the series' top run-scorer. While ray Lindwall, was the series' highest wicket-taker with 18 wickets. For India, Vijay Hazare scored 429 runs and Lala Amarnath took 13 wickets from six innings. However, Amarnath's string of poor scores with the bat cost India the services of another specialist batsman, who could have at least reduced the margins of defeat.|$|E

According to Moby, he shopped the record to every major label (from Warner Bros. to Sony to RCA) and was rejected every time. After V2 finally picked it up, his publicist sent the record to journalists, many of whom declined to listen to it. According to manager Eric Härle in an interview with HitQuarters, their original goal was to sell 250,000 copies, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> Everything Is Wrong, Moby's biggest-selling album at the time, had sold.|$|E

The morale of Yuan Shao's army was drastically weakened and Cao Cao's forces seized the opportunity to launch the full attack on Yuan's army. Yuan Shao's numerous armies were destroyed and much of his supplies were captured by Cao Cao. Yuan Shao himself fled north across the Yellow River with only about 800 cavalry, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> was left of his army.

25|$|When Mark Lawrenson and Jim Beglin named McManaman {{in their}} {{team of the}} 1990s, they said that most {{managers}} in the league used the same tactic of marking McManaman to stop Liverpool and whilst {{it was a tremendous}} compliment to McManaman, the opposition could stop Liverpool because the tactical system of 3–5–2 or 3–4–1–2 was too dependent on McManaman and would fail if McManaman was off form, or if the team was not complemented by a quality defence (players who could play both wingback and centre half to cope with onslaughts), or the presence of a steely defensive midfielder, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> happened with the team of that time. Nevertheless, McManaman was voted in on the official Liverpool FC website as the club's midfielder of the 1990s, was named by Ruud Gullit as one of his top two players from the entire Premier League era, and despite Liverpool fans' disappointment over the nature of how McManaman conducted his departure, it is believed that many fans still regard McManaman (along with Fowler) as the two players who carried Liverpool through the 1990s.|$|E

He mused that Raimi possessed an [...] "almost unreal ability to suggest the presence of intangible evil", <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> prevented the movie from being [...] "B-movie schlock". BBC critic Martyn Glanville awarded the film four stars out of five, writing that for Raimi, it served as a better debut film than Tobe Hooper's The Texas Chainsaw Massacre or Wes Craven's The Last House on the Left. Glanville noted that other than the [...] "ill-advised trees-that-rape scene", the film is [...] "one of the great modern horror films, and even more impressive when one considers its modest production values." ...|$|E
500|$|The early {{expansion}} of the Gniezno Land tribe very likely began under Mieszko's grandfather Lestek, the probable real founder of the Piast state. Widukind's chronicle speaks of Mieszko ruling a Slavic nation called [...] "Licicaviki", <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> Widukind made out of [...] "Lestkowicy": the people of Lestko, or Lestek. Lestek was also reflected in the sagas of the Normans, who {{may have played a}} role in Poland's origins (an accumulation of treasures from the period 930-1000 is attributed to them). Siemomysł and then Mieszko continued after Lestek, whose tradition was alive within the Piast court when Bolesław III Wrymouth named one of his sons after him and Gallus Anonymous wrote his chronicle. The term [...] "Lechici", popular later as a synonym [...] for [...] "Poles", may also have been inspired by Mieszko's grandfather.|$|E
500|$|Julia {{started seeing}} Dykins {{a year after}} Victoria's birth (although they {{had known each other}} before) when she was working in the café near Lennon's primary school; Mosspits. Dykins was a good-looking, well-dressed man who worked at the Adelphi Hotel in Liverpool as a wine steward. She later moved into a small flat in Gateacre with Dykins. He enjoyed luxuries, and had access to rationed goods like alcohol, chocolate, silk {{stockings}} and cigarettes, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> initially attracted her. The Stanley sisters called him [...] "Spiv", because of his pencil-thin moustache, margarine-coated hair, and pork-pie hat, and the young Lennon called him [...] "Twitchy" [...] because of a physical tic/nervous cough. Julia's family and friends remembered that he also had a fiery temperament, which could result in his being violent when drunk. Lennon remembered seeing his mother during a visit to Mimi's, when her face was bleeding after being hit by Dykins.|$|E

500|$|Hoppus {{considered}} {{the music on}} the album wide-ranging, commenting, [...] "We tried to capture the energy and not worry so much about all the knobs." [...] This includes songs he felt sounded like the group circa 1999, [...] "super-fast late-Nineties-punk-rock-sounding songs," [...] {{as well as more}} progressive songs [...] "that are like nothing we have ever done before." [...] Overall, he {{considered the}} record [...] "really rich with sing-along melodies and sing-along choruses," [...] <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> he preferred most when listening to bands. Feldmann considered the music not a [...] "huge departure" [...] from the band's usual sound, as hoped to make a [...] "classic Blink record." [...] To familiarize himself, he listened to all of the band's catalogue prior to recording. Lisa Worden, music director at Los Angeles radio station KROQ, compared its sound to the second Blink-182 album, Dude Ranch, and commented, [...] "It sounds like Blink but it's not anything that we've heard before. For fans of the band, they're going to be super happy with it." ...|$|E

Plankton sings a track on the novelty album The Best Day Ever titled [...] "You Will Obey," [...] on which Elvis Presley's former guitarist James Burton played guitar. Of the album, Tom Kenny said [...] "one of our hidden Easter eggs that hopefully more than three {{people in the world}} will get is during the guitar solo when Plankton says 'Take it, James', <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> Elvis said in every one of those concert movies".

500|$|Bond next {{created the}} role of Pitti-Sing in The Mikado (1885–87), one of the [...] "three little maids from school."

[...] For instance, Gilbert noted {{in an interview that}} the fact that the female singers to be engaged for The Mikado, Leonora Braham, Bond, and Sybil Grey, were all of short stature inspired him to make them schoolgirls—three [...] "little" [...] maids—and to treat them as a closely linked trio throughout the work as much as possible. [...] Bond, however, knew how to stand out on stage. [...] During preparations for The Mikado, she persuaded the wardrobe mistress to make the obi of her costume twice as big as that of the other [...] "little maids".
