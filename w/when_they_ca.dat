40|$|AbstractSynaptotagmins I and II are Ca 2 + binding {{proteins}} of synaptic vesicles {{essential for}} fast Ca 2 +-triggered neurotransmitter release. However, central synapses and neuroendocrine cells lacking these synaptotagmins still exhibit Ca 2 +-evoked exocytosis. We now propose that synaptotagmin VII {{functions as a}} plasma membrane Ca 2 + sensor in synaptic exocytosis complementary to vesicular synaptotagmins. We show that alternatively spliced forms of synaptotagmin VII are expressed in a developmentally regulated pattern in brain and are concentrated in presynaptic active zones of central synapses. In neuroendocrine PC 12 cells, the C 2 A and C 2 B domains of synaptotagmin VII are potent inhibitors of Ca 2 +-dependent exocytosis, but only <b>when</b> <b>they</b> bind <b>Ca</b> 2 +. Our data suggest that in synaptic vesicle exocytosis, distinct synaptotagmins function as independent Ca 2 + sensors on the two fusion partners, the plasma membrane (synaptotagmin VII) versus synaptic vesicles (synaptotagmins I and II) ...|$|R

In this paper, we present a parallel model of computation corresponding to this idealization: dimensionless particles move uniformely at fixed velocities along the real line and are transformed <b>when</b> <b>they</b> collide. Like <b>CA,</b> this model is parallel, uniform in space-time and uses local updating. The main difference {{is the use of}} the continuity of space and time, which we proceed to illustrate with a construction to solve Q-SAT, the satisfiability problem for quantified boolean formulae, in bounded space and time, and quadratic collision depth...|$|R
40|$|Abstract We {{have studied}} the effects {{associated}} with two single amino acid substitution mutations in HIV- 1 capsid (CA), the E 98 A and E 187 G. Both amino acids are well conserved among all major HIV- 1 subtypes. HIV- 1 infectivity is critically dependent on proper CA cone formation and mutations in <b>CA</b> are lethal <b>when</b> <b>they</b> inhibit <b>CA</b> assembly by destabilizing the intra and/or inter molecular CA contacts, which ultimately abrogate viral replication. Glu 98, which is located on a surface of a flexible cyclophilin A binding loop {{is not involved in}} any intra-molecular contacts with other CA residues. In contrast, Glu 187 has extensive intra-molecular contacts with eight other CA residues. Additionally, Glu 187 has been shown to form a salt-bridge with Arg 18 of another N -terminal CA monomer in a N-C dimer. However, despite proper virus release, glycoprotein incorporation and Gag processing, electron microscopy analysis revealed that, in contrast to the E 187 G mutant, only the E 98 A particles had aberrant core morphology that resulted in loss of infectivity. </p...|$|R

In a period of extreme physical and emotional upheaval, engagement in schooling inevitably decreases. Introducing learning technologies into the learning environment enhances interest in learning, making it more student-centred, collaborative and encouraging cooperative, creative problem solving. (Kimber & Deighton, 1998) This is also a “time when patterns of thinking and behaviour are established for both the short and long term…a time of competing demands that can confuse…the influence of drugs, violence and the media and high levels of youth unemployment can {{have a significant impact on}} young adolescents at the very time <b>when</b> <b>they</b> are endeavouring to establish their own identity and place in the world. ” (Redesigning the Middle Years-draft, 1999 : 1) In such a context, learning technologies can make a difference!
