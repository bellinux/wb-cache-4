5|$|Beebe {{described}} his religious beliefs {{as a combination}} of Presbyterianism and Buddhism. His religion <b>was</b> <b>largely</b> the result of seeking to combine his sense of awe and wonder at the natural world with a scientific understanding of its workings. He was highly critical of efforts to use science to justify political ideologies, such as socialism or the belief that women were inferior to men. Beebe also disapproved of the eugenic ideas advocated by many biologists in the early 20th century, including some of his contemporaries at the zoo, although this <b>was</b> <b>largely</b> {{out of fear that}} these ideas would alienate friends of the zoo and cause divisions among its staff.|$|E
5|$|Bodyline bowling was intimidatory, and <b>was</b> <b>largely</b> {{designed}} {{as an attempt}} to curb the prolific scoring of Donald Bradman, although other prolific Australian batsmen such as Bill Woodfull, Bill Ponsford and Alan Kippax were also targeted.|$|E
5|$|Britain <b>was</b> <b>largely</b> forested in this period; {{widespread}} {{forest clearance}} {{did not occur}} in Kent until the Late Bronze Age (c.1000 to 700 BCE). Environmental data from {{the vicinity of the}} White Horse Stone, a putatively prehistoric monolith near the river, supports the idea that the area was still largely forested in the Early Neolithic, covered by a woodland of oak, ash, hazel/alder and Maloideae. Throughout most of Britain, there is little evidence of cereal or permanent dwellings from this period, leading archaeologists to believe that the Early Neolithic economy on the island <b>was</b> <b>largely</b> pastoral, relying on herding cattle, with people living a nomadic or semi-nomadic life.|$|E

50|$|The land {{being used}} <b>is</b> <b>largely</b> {{marshland}} and reclaimed from the sea: in particular, it <b>is</b> <b>largely</b> unoccupied. As a result, {{the social and}} fiscal costs of development are less than are usual for Chinese urban and industrial development.|$|R
50|$|Orchestration {{is often}} {{discussed}} {{as having an}} inherent intelligence or even implicitly autonomic control, but those <b>are</b> <b>largely</b> aspirations or analogies rather than technical descriptions. In reality, orchestration <b>is</b> <b>largely</b> the effect of automation or systems deploying elements of control theory.|$|R
5|$|The army {{grew from}} 10,000 to 25,000 by 1978. Amin's army <b>was</b> <b>largely</b> a {{mercenary}} force. Half {{the soldiers were}} South Sudanese and 26 percent Congolese, with only 24 percent being Ugandan, mostly Muslim and Kakwa.|$|E

5|$|A {{week before}} her death, Mary {{went through her}} papers, weeding out some which were burnt, but her journal survives, as do her letters to William and to Frances Apsley. The Jacobites lambasted her, but the {{assessment}} of her character that came down to posterity <b>was</b> <b>largely</b> the vision of Mary as a dutiful, submissive wife, who assumed power reluctantly, exercised it with considerable ability when necessary, and willingly deferred it to her husband.|$|E
