50|$|Optimizing rolling {{resistance}} in the elastomer material is a key challenge for reducing fuel consumption in the transportation sector. It is estimated that passenger vehicles consume approximately 5~15% of its fuel to overcome {{rolling resistance}}, while the estimate is understood to be higher for heavy trucks. However, there is a trade-off between rolling resistance and wet traction and grip: while low rolling resistance {{can be achieved by}} reducing the viscoelastic properties of the rubber compound (low tangent (δ)), it comes at the cost of <b>wet</b> traction and <b>grip,</b> which requires hysteresis and energy dissipation (high tangent (δ)). A low tangent (δ) value at 60 °C is used as an indicator of low rolling resistance, while a high tangent (δ) value at 0 °C is used as an indicator of high wet traction. Designing an elastomer material that can achieve both high wet traction and low rolling resistance is key in achieving safety and fuel efficiency in the transportation sector.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} {{elastomer}} material used {{today is a}} styrene-butadiene copolymer. It combines butadiene, which is a highly rubbery polymer (Tg = -100 °C) that has low hysteresis and thus offers good rolling resistance, with styrene, which is a highly glass polymer (Tg = 100 °C) that has high hysteresis and thus offers good <b>wet</b> <b>grip</b> properties in addition to wear resistance. Therefore, the ratio the two polymers in the styrene-butadienecopolymer is considered key in determining the glass transition temperature of the material, which is correlated to its grip and resistance properties.|$|E

I managed to get the maximum {{out of the car and}} really enjoyed myself. Even though we lost valuable track time in yesterday's practice, we managed to find an optimum set-up and I was able to go flat out. I am really looking forward to tomorrow's race and we are in good shape." [...] Mika Häkkinen on taking the pole position. Saturday afternoon's qualifying session lasted for an hour. Each driver was limited to twelve laps, with the starting order decided by the drivers' fastest laps. During this session the 107% rule was in effect, requiring each driver to remain within 107% of the fastest lap time to qualify for the race. The session was held in overcast weather conditions. Häkkinen clinched his fourth pole position of the season, his first since the San Marino Grand Prix, with a time of 1:10.410. He was joined on the front row of the grid by teammate Coulthard who was three-tenths of a second off Häkkinen's pace. Coulthard felt he could have challenged for pole position but he clipped a kerb going into Castrol Kurve on his final run which cost him time. Both drivers were satisfied with their car's balance. Barrichello qualified third and said that he changed his car's set-up to help him to achieve a better lap time. Michael Schumacher qualified fourth, six-tenths of a second behind Häkkinen, and reported that his car's handling was uneven throughout the circuit. He also had a high-speed spin during the session and aborted his final run after he made a mistake at the exit of Gösser corner. Trulli qualified fifth having used the soft compound tyres to set his fastest lap time. Zonta and Villeneuve set the sixth and seventh fastest times respectively for BAR, both drivers spun during the session. Fisichella recorded the eighth quickest time although he lost a bargeboard when he went off the circuit. He felt he could have secured fifth but a yellow-flag caused him to reduce his pace. Salo and Verstappen completed the top ten positions. Diniz missed qualifying in the top ten by two-thousands of a second and spun off while setting lap times, triggering a yellow-flag. de la Rosa managed twelfth, having struggled with the conditions during the session. He qualified ahead of Sauber driver Nick Heidfeld and Wurz. Frentzen, fifteenth, ran the hard compound tyres and his lap times were set early in the session before track conditions had improved. Frentzen said it was because he felt rain would hit the circuit towards the end of qualifying. Herbert started from sixteenth, after stopping on one run because to a broken left rear suspension caused by a loose suspension bracket at the Niki Lauda Kurve. A rear wishbone on his car had also been flexing. Alesi qualified seventeenth. Jenson Button used the spare Williams car set up for Ralf Schumacher because Button's race car had engine issues and qualified eighteenth. Button additionally struggled with driving the spare car. His teammate Ralf Schumacher qualified nineteenth in the Williams team's worst qualifying performance of the season. Burti and the two Minardi drivers qualified at the rear of the field, covering positions twenty to twenty-two.|$|R
40|$|This work {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} tyre tread pattern design for optimum <b>wet</b> <b>grip</b> performance. A mathematical model of tyre behaviour on wet roads has been developed. This utilizes the finite element method in the representation of tread pattern geometry. The performance of a particular tread pattern is found {{in terms of the}} fluid pressures and film thicknesses existing within the contact patch, under wet conditions. Many modern tread patterns are based on 'blocks', and a computer model has been developed specifically to assist the tyre designer in the design of these blocks for improved <b>wet</b> <b>grip.</b> Numerical results are presented both for complete contact patches and for individual tread blocks. To allow the use of the computer models by the tyre designer, with no specialist knowledge of the finite element method, special purpose mesh generation and plotting programs have been developed. Experiments have been undertaken whereby the fluid pressures and film thicknesses existing in the tyre contact patch have been measured under high speed conditions in the wet. These measure- ments were made on an indoor testing machine, and the techniques developed can be used in the routine evaluation of tyre <b>wet</b> <b>grip</b> performance. Some results of experiments performed on plain and simple patterned tyres are presented. The main purpose of this work was the development of the mathematical models which can be used for future research into, and design of, tyres for improved <b>wet</b> <b>grip.</b> However, some conclusions are made as to possible features which could be utilized in future tyre designs...|$|E

Surprisingly, the presence of BR imparted poorer abrasion resistance in most systems, except for the CB-filled E-SBR system in which an enhanced abrasion resistance was observed. Obviously, S-SBR gave superior properties (tire performance) compared to E-SBR, particularly obvious in the silica-filled system.

The phase specific localization of CNTs in rubber blends is predicted theoretically using surface energy data of blend components and determined experimentally {{by means of}} the wetting concept. Almost all CNTs are found to be localized in the SBR matrix of SBR/IR blends due to the better affinity of CNTs to SBR than to IR. In contrast, a high CNT loading localized in the NR phase of SBR/NR blends results from the presence of phospholipids in NR. Electrical and mechanical properties of the rubber blends depend strongly on CNT localization.

40|$|AbstractDriving {{safety is}} of utmost {{importance}} in the automobile industry and is acknowledged {{by the introduction of}} the tire <b>wet</b> <b>grip</b> index as part of the EU tire label. The rubber pavement interaction is determined by the viscoelastic properties of the rubber {{as well as by the}} pavement texture. Nowadays available optical surface profiling instruments allow for a detailed measurement of surface roughness covering several length scales. This enables the validation of a mathematical statistical description of pavement texture within the framework of self-affine surfaces and hence provides a holistic characterization of surface roughness covering several length scales within a few characteristic parameters. We deduce within this article the correlation between classical surface roughness parameters and the parameter set of self-affine surfaces. These parameters allow for a detailed understanding of the relationship between pavement texture and its wet skid resistance. We present wet skid resistance measurements with the British pendulum and a linear friction tester device on different pavement textures. We demonstrate that the so-called estimated texture depth does not correlate to the surface skid resistance measured with the British pendulum. Finally, we deduce a dependency of wet skid resistance on pavement texture which is supported by current models for hysteresis friction...|$|E
40|$|From November 2012 all {{passenger}} car tyres, light truck tyres and heavy duty vehicle tyres {{sold on the}} aftermarket in the European Union must have a label classifying the external rolling noise, the fuel efficiency, and the <b>wet</b> <b>grip.</b> This regulation puts a focus on optimisation of the tyre de- sign with respect to all these parameters at once.

40|$|Structural {{studies of}} filled polymer {{networks}} under periodic deformation are {{of great importance}} to the industries concerned with rubber. The degree of reinforcement provided by the filler depends {{on a number of}} variables: the size of the polymer-filler interface, the size of primary particles, {{the size and shape of}} filler clusters. In the tyre industry it is necessary to optimize mechanical properties such as low rolling resistance, good <b>wet</b> <b>grip</b> and long lifetime. There have been studies of unfilled polymer networks and filler model-systems (block copolymers),([1, 2]) but because their complexity, industrial rubber samples have escaped investigations. We performed SAXS, USAXS and SANS measurements on carbon black filled natural rubber (poly-isoprene) under uniaxial deformation at ESRF ID- 02 and Forschungszentrum Julich KWS- 2. The scattering patterns of the studied filler particles show power-law decay over many decades in scattering vector q. At the scale of primary particles we detected surface fractal behavior and for the characteristic size of the primary particles we calculated lengths of the order of 10 nm. X-ray scattering was used for time resolved experiments (about 10 frames per second) and neutron scattering was used to distinguish between scattering from the studied fillers and the additives (especially zinc oxide) used in industrial materials...|$|E
40|$|AbstractEpoxidized {{natural rubber}} (ENR 50) has been {{introduced}} to the elastomeric group of materials as a modified form of natural rubber. ENR 50 is a modified natural rubber having properties resembling those of synthetic rubbers rather than natural rubber. ENR 50 is miscible with polar rubber such as acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber (NBR). ENR 50 has unique properties such as good oil resistance, low gas permeability, improved <b>wet</b> <b>grip</b> and rolling resistance, as well as high tensile strength. However, the market and applications for ENR 50 is limited. In this research, NBR gloves {{have been used as}} recycled NBR (NBRr) which have excellent resistance to punctures, tears and many types of chemicals. Blending ENR 50 with recycled NBR is the easiest and cheapest ways to tailor the properties of ENR 50 {{and at the same time}} reduce the material cost. ENR 50 /NBRr blends were prepared by two-roll mill at five different compositions (i. e., 95 / 5, 90 / 10, 85 / 15, 75 / 25, and 65 / 35). Tensile properties such as tensile strength, elongation at break and modulus were carried out to determine the compatibility between ENR 50 and NBRr. Results indicated that blending ENR 50 with NBRr improved all the tensile properties (tensile strength, modulus and elongation at break) compared to the NR/NBRr blends.

Filler dispersion {{can be characterized}} using different methods (. In the present work we use three different approaches to compare the dispersability of two grades of amorphous precipitated silica {{in the shape of}} micropearls, characterized by different specific areas.

In this case, the micropearl is subjected to hydrodynamic stresses due to the shear of the elastomer matrix, the last method is based on the analysis of dispersion during the mixing operation of silica and the elastomer in an internal mixer coupling information from rheology, bound rubber and SEM to follow the dispersion.

40|$|Friction {{of carbon}} black- and silica-reinforced {{elastomers}} is studied experimentally and theoretically, using Persson’s model. The effect of reinforcement fillers on elasticity {{was determined by}} dynamical mechanical analysis. Carbon black-filled samples have a higher Young’s modulus than the silica-filled compounds. Silica-filled rubbers have a higher tan (δ) at lower temperatures and a lower loss tangent at higher temperatures, which is a rough indication for higher <b>wet</b> <b>grip</b> and lower rolling resistance, respectively. Friction tests on a ball-on-disk test rig were performed to study {{the effect of the}} reinforcement fillers and their amount on the friction between rubber samples (disks) and relatively smooth or rough granite surfaces (balls). The results were discussed and compared with the friction model presented by Persson. It was shown theoretically and experimentally that hysteresis does not {{play a significant role in}} the friction of rubber samples in contact with smooth granite and that it plays a minor role in contact with a rough granite sphere. Therefore, the hysteresis contribution of friction can be neglected in the contact of rubbers with just smooth spheres. Moreover, a higher friction coefficient is seen in samples with a higher content of fillers. Silica-filled compounds show a slightly higher coefficient of friction compared with the carbon black-filled compounds. The effect of attached wear debris to the granite surfaces on the friction level has been studied.

40|$|Since its {{introduction}} in 1992, silica {{has become a}} widely used filler in passenger tire treads. Compared to carbon black filled compounds, it brings about the benefit of lower rolling resistance and consequently lower vehicle fuel consumption: a global concern nowadays. But replacement of carbon black by silica is rather difficult, since {{the latter is a}} polar filler and has a low compatibility with non-polar rubbers. In order {{to solve the problem of}} low filler-polymer compatibility and interactions as well as to improve filler dispersion, coupling agents were introduced for silica-filled compounds. These coupling agents, predominantly bi-functional silanes, interact with the hydrophilic silica surface on one side and the hydrophobic rubber chains on the other side, thereby creating chemical coupling. Styrene butadiene rubber (SBR), which is functionalized with polar and/or reactive groups, enables the polymer to directly physically or chemically interact or bond with silica and has the potential to further improve the dispersion of the filler and reduce the hysteresis of the resulting material. In the present work, two functionalized SBRs, one backbone modified with carboxylate moieties and the other one modified with dithiol groups, are used. The effect on dynamic mechanical properties of a silica filled passenger car tire tread compound is studied. In addition, the effect of zinc oxide on the compound properties is discussed, since it can interfere with the silanization reaction and may also react with the functionalized polymers. The results show the significant potential of these modified SBRs to reduce rolling resistance while maintaining <b>wet</b> <b>grip...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{elastomer}} compound {{used for}} tire treads {{is a composite}} material of which the dynamic properties can be adjusted over a relatively broad range by modification of the polymer-filer interaction. The replacement of carbon black by a silica-silane coupling agent system, for instance allows reducinng the hysteresis of the rubber, which results in a reduction of the rolling resistance when applied for tire treads. Selective changes {{in the structure of}} the coupling agent, e. g. the number of alkoxy groups reactive towards silanol groups on the surface of the filler, the length of the linker between filler and polymer, or the bond strength between coupling agent and polymer, lead to changes in the microstructure of the silica-polymer interface and determine the dynamic properties of the material, thus <b>wet</b> <b>grip</b> andd rolling resistance of a tire tread. It was shown that these changes in the silane structure lead to characteristtic changes inn the propertiees of the compposites. Silanees with just to one ethoxy group instead of three as in the commonly used silanes decrease the hysteresis at high temperatures and increase it at low temperatures. A longer linker lowers the hysteresis at elevated temperatures, thus a lower energy loss at the service temperature of a running tire. When the sillane molecule cannot chemically link to the polymer, the dynamic as well as the mechanical properties deteriorate. In this paper, the effect of specific changes {{in the structure of the}} silane coupling agent on the macroscopopic dynamic properties as indicators for tire performance will be discussed, besides the influence on mechanical properties of the elastomeric material...|$|E
40|$|Due {{to the low}} {{mechanical}} properties of pure rubber, fillers are normally added to rubber compounds intended to provide reinforcement and improve their final properties. Several factors affect the reinforcing potential of fillers, including size, structure and surface activity. Carbon black and silica {{are the most common}} reinforcing fillers used in the rubber industry. Since the introduction of the “Green Tire Technology” in 1992 by Michelin, silica was found to offer reduced rolling resistance and enhanced <b>wet</b> <b>grip</b> properties compared to carbon black. However, silica presents many processing difficulties due to the polarity differences with rubber and requires the addition of silane coupling agents. Silane coupling agents reduces these polarity differences between silica and rubber providing strong filler-polymer linkages and thus, good final {{mechanical properties}} of rubber compounds. With the addition of silane coupling agents several reactions take place, such as the silanization reaction occurring between the silica and silane, the silane-rubber coupling and the linkages occurring between the polymer chains. All these reactions play an important role of the reinforcing potential of silica particles. Therefore, the dispersion of silica along with the filler-polymer interactions occurring within the rubber matrix are nowadays important concerns for the tyre industry. Silica particles tend to self-associate forming aggregates and lowering the mechanical properties of tyre tread compounds. Due to the importance of rubber reinforcement in tyre industry the main aim of this thesis is to use different measuring techniques to study filler-polymer interactions occurring within the rubber matrix. The effects of compounds composition and mixing times on filler-polymer interaction were studied. This thesis is divided into two parts: the literature review and the experimental part. The literature part consists of 5 chapters making a general overview of rubber technology, silica and silane coupling agents and the different techniques available to measure filler-polymer interactions. The experimental part contains the methods used to measure filler-polymer interactions...|$|E
40|$|Epoxidized {{natural rubber}} (ENR) is a {{modified}} form of NR bearing polar epoxy groups. This work investigates a silica-reinforced NR tire tread compounds with ENR as a compatibilizer. The ENRs consisting of 10, 38 and 51 mol% epoxide {{are used in}} a range of 2. 5 to 15. 0 parts per hundred parts of rubber (phr). The use of ENR as compatibilizer improves the filler-rubber interaction, silica dispersion and tensile strength. Increase of the ENR content and mole% of epoxide groups decreases the filler-filler interaction and improves silica dispersion, as reflected in a lower Mooney viscosity, Payne effect, flocculation rate constant and filler networking factor. With respect to tire performance, the presence of ENR- 38 and ENR- 51 as compatibilizer improves <b>wet</b> <b>grip</b> but negatively affects rolling resistance due to an increased glass transition temperature of the epoxidized NR. The addition of ENR- 51 at 7. 5 phr shows the best overall properties, however still somewhat lower when compared to a compound with the commonly employed bis-(triethoxysilylpropyl) tetrasulfide (TESPT) silane as coupling agent. The use of ENR- 51 at 7. 5 phr with TESPT at 4 wt% relative to silica and sulfur compensation gives vulcanizates with the same levels of tensile strength compared to vulcanizates with TESPT at 8. 6 wt% relative to silica. The presence of ENR in the silica-filled NR affects the dynamic mechanical properties. The addition of TESPT to the ENR-compatibilized compounds causes only a small change in glass transition temperature (Tg) and tan δ at 5 oC, but lowers tan δ at 60 oC. Furthermore, the addition of extra sulfur leads to an increase of Tg and lower tan δ at both 5 oC and 60 oC as a result of increased crosslink density. SEM micrographs clearly show good silica dispersion in all compatiblized vulcanizates, and the tensile fracture surfaces of the materials show different tear line patterns dependent on their tensile strengths...|$|E
