25|$|On October 17, 2017 Frank Ocean's dad, Calvin Cooksey, sued Frank {{on charges}} of {{defamation}} and other damages with restitution payments reaching up to 14.5 million dollars. The issue started when Frank Ocean wrote a post in his personal Tumblr responding to the Pulse Nightclub shooting back in June 2016 and told {{a story about how}} when he was a kid, he heard his father use a transphobic slur towards a waitress. The post stated that:'I was six years old when I heard my dad call our transgender waitress a f***** as he dragged me out a neighborhood diner saying we wouldn’t be served because she was dirty. 'That was the last afternoon I saw my father and the first time I heard that word, I think, although it wouldn’t shock me if it wasn’t. Many hate us and <b>wish</b> <b>we</b> didn’t exist.' The judge ended up ruling in favor of Frank Ocean and the case was put to an end.|$|E

500|$|At {{the start}} of the 2007–08 season, Stevens was the second {{youngest}} coach in Division I basketball. He got off to a fast start, winning his first eight games before falling to Wright State 43–42. Legendary coach Bob Knight, whose Texas Tech team was an early victim, said [...] "I <b>wish</b> <b>we</b> played as smart as they do." [...] Virginia Tech coach Seth Greenberg added [...] "they've got toughness about them and they expect to win." ...|$|E
500|$|Producer Paul Rabwin was displeased {{with the}} final episode, noting, [...] "'Badlaa' was the one episode I {{did not like the}} most [...] I think if I had done it different, I would have had John Shiban change the method of transportation. I don't think it ever worked on any level for me. It was just weird and creepy, but I think the whole idea was distasteful to me." [...] He later bluntly {{concluded}} that [...] "it's the only episode that I kind of <b>wish</b> <b>we</b> hadn't done." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} marketed with several taglines, including: [...] "We've always {{believed}} we weren't alone. On July 4, we'll <b>wish</b> <b>we</b> were", [...] "Earth. Take a good look. It {{could be your}} last", and [...] "Don't make plans for August". The weekend before the film's release, the Fox Network aired a half-hour special on the film, the first third {{of which was a}} spoof news report on the events that happen in the film. Roger Ebert attributed most of the film's early success to its teaser trailers and marketing campaigns, acknowledging them as [...] "truly brilliant".|$|E

500|$|Despite reusing some scripts {{from other}} sources, Perrin {{said that he}} and Sheekman [...] "had [...] hands full turning out a script each week". They found help from Tom McKnight and George Oppenheimer, whose names were passed along to Groucho. Perrin explained, [...] " [...] was in the men's room during a break, and he was {{complaining}} to the guy standing next to him, 'Geez, I <b>wish</b> <b>we</b> could find another writer or two to make life easier.' Suddenly there's a voice from one of the stalls: 'I've got just the guys for you!' Having Tom and George did make life easier, although Arthur and I went over their scripts for a light polishing." ...|$|E
500|$|During 1940, Friedman was {{appointed}} {{an assistant professor}} teaching Economics at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, but encountered antisemitism in the Economics department and {{decided to return to}} government service. From 1941 to 1943 Friedman worked on wartime tax policy for the federal government, as an advisor to senior officials of the United States Department of the Treasury. As a Treasury spokesman during 1942 he advocated a Keynesian policy of taxation. He helped to invent the payroll withholding tax system, since the federal government badly needed money in order to fight the war. He later said, [...] "I have no apologies for it, but I really <b>wish</b> <b>we</b> hadn't found it necessary and I wish there were some way of abolishing withholding now." ...|$|E
500|$|Four {{days before}} the race, the September 11 attacks took place, causing most major American {{sporting}} events scheduled on the same weekend as the German 500 to be postponed, including National Football League (NFL) and Major League Baseball (MLB) games, and a NASCAR Winston Cup Series race, the New Hampshire 300, at New Hampshire Motor Speedway. The Italian Grand Prix, a Formula One race, was held that weekend. According to Ronald Richards, {{the vice president of}} CART, the series decided to continue with the race prior to the cancellation of that week's NFL games, a decision followed by other American leagues. Richards acknowledged that [...] "We <b>wish</b> <b>we</b> would have had the input regarding the NFL's decision prior to making our decision." ...|$|E

500|$|On the Aurora, Mertz met Belgrave Edward Sutton Ninnis, a {{lieutenant}} in the Royal Fusiliers. Like Mertz, Ninnis {{was responsible for the}} expedition's dogs; Auroras captain, John King Davis, regarded the pair as [...] "idlers". [...] "I <b>wish</b> <b>we</b> had some one on board who could look after ," [...] he wrote in his diary, [...] "it is a great shame that they should suffer from neglect." [...] On 2 December 1911, after final preparations and loading were completed in Hobart, the Aurora sailed south; she stopped briefly at Macquarie Island, where a wireless relay base was established, and reached the site of the expedition's main base at Cape Denison in Adélie Land, on the Antarctic continent, in early January.|$|E
500|$|The song's meaning {{originated}} {{with a discussion}} between Brandon Heath and friend and songwriter Jason Ingram. [...] "We had a conversation over Chinese food that we wished we could have God’s perspective on things", Heath said. [...] "If we did have His perspective, we'd <b>wish</b> <b>we</b> could have it {{for long periods of}} time, rather than just for a few seconds. That was the beginning." [...] He soon began to pen a song about the idea, co-writing [...] "Give Me Your Eyes" [...] with Ingram. Prior to recording What If We, Heath had written 40 possible tracks for the album, and although the song was not his top favorite, he noted that [...] "Give Me Your Eyes" [...] was [...] "one of the first that really stuck out." ...|$|E
500|$|Simpson {{looked to}} herself for {{inspiration}} when writing [...] "Little Miss Obsessive", which chronicles the [...] "ostensibly aural dance" [...] {{of a couple}} [...] "who break up to make up – and like it". Of the song's concept, Simpson commented: [...] "It's what we can all become in a relationship sometimes. We put our foot in our mouths and we <b>wish</b> <b>we</b> didn't — 'No, I didn't mean to say it. I take it back. I take it back.'" [...] According to Simpson, the song [...] "kind of relates to the last album , but it grew with the new record. And every girl has gone through that situation. You put your foot in your mouth and you go, 'Wait, why did I do that?' We're on our phones writing and texting too much!" ...|$|E

500|$|The 25th piece came {{suitably}} Halloween-themed. Located on the Bowery, it {{exhibited a}} Grim Reaper riding a bumper car in circles to an elaborate light show, fog machine and Blue Öyster Cult's (Don't Fear) The Reaper. The accompanying audio guide offered a self-mockery interpretation, with Banksy stating that often [...] "the role {{of art is}} {{to remind us of}} our mortality," [...] implying that with this mounted art show that goes on [...] "for so long we <b>wish</b> <b>we</b> were dead already." [...] The site of the exhibit was once that of an antique shop, some remains of which were placed in a coffin that occupied the lot for months. This prompted other interpretations of the installations message, paying homage to the [...] "ghosts of Bowry," [...] as the antique store owner suggested.|$|E
500|$|To evoke genuine {{emotions}} {{of shock and}} sadness, the final O.R. scene was kept a secret from the cast, {{with the exception of}} Alan Alda, until immediately before filming; only then did Gelbart hand out the last page of the script. As a result, Stevenson was still on the set to see the final scene being filmed. After shooting was completed, a season-ending cast party was planned. Stevenson left the set almost immediately after the end of filming, and the party was canceled due to the poor mood of the cast. Stevenson later {{said in an interview that}} he was deeply hurt that his character's death was revealed in that fashion and the party was [...] "ruined." [...] Gelbart later said of the event, [...] "I <b>wish</b> <b>we</b> could say to him, 'We didn't mean it, Mac.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Absence as a lyrical {{theme is}} common in the music of Pink Floyd. Examples include the absence of Barrett after 1968, and that of Waters' father, who died during the Second World War. Waters' lyrics also {{explored}} unrealised political goals and unsuccessful endeavours. Their film score, Obscured by Clouds, dealt {{with the loss of}} youthful exuberance that sometimes comes with ageing. Longtime Pink Floyd album cover designer, Storm Thorgerson, described the lyrics of Wish You Were Here: [...] "The idea of presence withheld, of the ways that people pretend to be present while their minds are really elsewhere, and the devices and motivations employed psychologically by people to suppress the full force of their presence, eventually boiled down to a single theme, absence: The absence of a person, the absence of a feeling." [...] Waters commented: [...] "it's about none of us really being there... should have been called <b>Wish</b> <b>We</b> Were Here".|$|E

Chris Martins of Spin compared the video to the TV series Nova, stating that the video [...] "might be the weirdest NOVA pilot ever created", later adding that Björk [...] "reinvents herself as the freakiest geology teacher the world's ever seen", an expression used also by io9 blogger George Dvorsky, who commented that [...] "this stunning new video for [...] "Mutual Core" [...] makes us <b>wish</b> <b>we</b> had Björk for a geology teacher". Brett Warner of Ology praised the director's work stating that [...] "director Andrew Thomas Huang's gorgeous visuals will adeptly manage to both confuse {{the hell out of}} you and absolutely take your breath away". Abdullah Saeed of The Atlantic compared the video to her previous works and commented: ...|$|E
500|$|Goldfinger {{received}} more positive reviews than Fleming's previous novel, Dr. No, which had faced widespread {{criticism in the}} British media. Writing in The Observer, Maurice Richardson thought that [...] "Mr. Fleming seems to be leaving realism further and further behind and developing only {{in the direction of}} an atomic, sophisticated Sapper." [...] Even when leaving reality behind, however, Richardson considers that Fleming, [...] "even with his forked tongue sticking right through his cheek, ... remains maniacally readable". Richardson picked up on two areas relating to the characters of the book, saying that Goldfinger [...] "is the most preposterous specimen yet displayed in Mr. Fleming's museum of super fiends", whilst, referring to the novel's central character, observed that [...] "the real trouble with Bond, from a literary point of view, is that he {{is becoming more and more}} synthetic and zombie-ish. Perhaps it is just as well." [...] Writing in The Manchester Guardian, Roy Perrott observed that [...] "Goldfinger...will not let [...] close admirers down". Perrott thought that overall [...] "Fleming is again at his best when most sportingly Buchan-ish as in the motoring pursuit across Europe"; he summarised the book by saying that it was [...] "hard to put down; but some of us <b>wish</b> <b>we</b> had the good taste just to try." ...|$|E
500|$|As of December 2013, Oppong is a {{full-time}} student at the University of Windsor teacher's college. Prior to 2013, he notified the Oshawa Power front office about his plans {{to pursue a career}} in education, leading to his trade to the Windsor Express. In the case that Windsor had to play out of their division, his basketball career forced him to miss a few days of school. Oppong has experience as a student-teacher at Catholic Central High School in Windsor, Ontario. In late 2013, he said, [...] "It's been challenging. It's a matter of juggling things and time management. I'm really grateful the Windsor Express have worked with me and supported me." [...] Express head coach Bill Jones commented, [...] "I really like Papa and respect what he's doing. I <b>wish</b> <b>we</b> could have the kid with us every day because I'm sure he'd have a bigger role with us but he's doing what he can and playing 22 minutes a game and playing them hard." [...] Oppong became the third member of his family to attend the University of Windsor, following his sister. He plans to become either a physical education or history teacher once he gets his teaching certificate. While at Eastern Kentucky University, he intentionally majored in general studies so that he could attend teacher's college for one year.|$|E
