5|$|Fried chicken (also {{referred}} to as Southern fried chicken for the variant in the United States) is a dish consisting of chicken pieces usually from broiler chickens which have been floured or battered and then pan-fried, deep fried, or pressure fried. The breading adds a crisp coating or crust to the exterior. <b>What</b> <b>separates</b> fried chicken from other fried forms of chicken is that generally the chicken is cut at the joints, and the bones and skin are left intact. Crisp well-seasoned skin, rendered of excess fat, is a hallmark of well made fried chicken.|$|E

25|$|Some {{cases of}} {{diabetes}} {{are caused by}} the body's tissue receptors not responding to insulin (even when insulin levels are normal, which is <b>what</b> <b>separates</b> it from type2 diabetes); this form is very uncommon.

Any disease that causes extensive damage to the pancreas may lead to diabetes (for example, chronic pancreatitis and cystic fibrosis). Diseases associated with excessive secretion of insulin-antagonistic hormones can cause diabetes (which is typically resolved once the hormone excess is removed). Many drugs impair insulin secretion and some toxins damage pancreatic beta cells.

There is also clear dimorphism between ovary development of the two different castes of females.

There is a stark absence of no transitional females (workers with developed ovaries) thus showing unambiguous division between castes.
