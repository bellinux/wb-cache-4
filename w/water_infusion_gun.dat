40|$|With the {{commercial}} introduction of atmospheric pressure chemical ionization for gas chromatography in 2008, GC-APCI coupled to high-resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-APCI-HRTOFMS) became an interesting {{addition to the}} metabolomics toolbox.

The actual utility of GC-APCI-HRTOFMS in metabolic fingerprinting and profiling applications to biological matrices is the topic of this doctoral thesis. During comparison of GC-APCI-HRTOFMS with GC×GC-EI-TOFMS, GC-EI-TOFMS, GC-CI-qMS, and GC-EI-qMS in my master thesis, it was noticed that reproducibility of APCI was affected greatly by differences in humidity in the laboratory. Therefore, the impact of humidity in the APCI source on ionization efficiency and repeatability was systematically studied in the initial project of this doctoral thesis. Water was continuously infused to ensure a constant humidity during APCI {{in the analysis of}} methylchloroformate (MCF) - and methoxime-trimethylsilyl (MeOx-TMS) derivatized metabolites. These two different derivatization strategies are most commonly pursued in GC-MS based metabolome analyses. Several infusion rates were tested and a rate of 0. 4 mL/h yielded an average 16. 6 -fold increase in intensity of the protonated molecules ([M+H]+) of 20 MCF-derivatized metabolites through suppression of in-source fragmentation. <b>Water</b> <b>infusion,</b> however, did not improve efficiency and repeatability of APCI of methoxime-trimethylsilyl (MeOx-TMS) derivatives of metabolite standards.

40|$|Human {{swallowing}} {{represents a}} complex highly coordinated sensorimotor function whose functional neuroanatomy remains incompletely understood. Specifically, {{previous studies have}} failed to delineate the temporo-spatial sequence of those cerebral loci active during the differing phases of swallowing. We therefore sought to define the temporal characteristics of cortical activity associated with human swallowing behaviour using a novel application of magnetoencephalography (MEG). In healthy volunteers (n = 8, aged 28 - 45), 151 -channel whole cortex MEG was recorded during the conditions of oral <b>water</b> <b>infusion,</b> volitional wet swallowing (5 ml bolus), tongue thrust or rest. Each condition lasted for 5 s and was repeated 20 times. Synthetic aperture magnetometry (SAM) analysis was performed on each active epoch and compared to rest. Temporal sequencing of brain activations utilised time-frequency wavelet plots of regions selected using virtual electrodes. Following SAM analysis, <b>water</b> <b>infusion</b> preferentially activated the caudolateral sensorimotor cortex, whereas during volitional swallowing and tongue movement, the superior sensorimotor cortex was more strongly active. Time-frequency wavelet analysis indicated that sensory input from the tongue simultaneously activated caudolateral sensorimotor and primary gustatory cortex, which appeared to prime the superior sensory and motor cortical areas, involved in the volitional phase of swallowing. Our data support {{the existence of a}} temporal synchrony across the whole cortical swallowing network, with sensory input from the tongue being critical. Thus, the ability to non-invasively image this network, with intra-individual and high temporal resolution, provides new insights into the brain processing of human swallowing. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Avoiding sedation or general anesthesia theoretically will avoid sedation related complications, could be time- and cost-saving, could improve patient satisfaction and reduce waiting lists for colonoscopy. Aim : To study the feasibility of unsedated colonoscopy by means of <b>water</b> <b>infusion</b> in a tertiary hospital setting. The primary endpoint of this trial is reaching the cecum without need for sedation. Methods : The <b>water</b> <b>infusion</b> technique for colonoscopy consists of using water at body temperature at insertion of the endoscope, instead of air insufflation. It is combined with removal of all residual colonic air by suction and residual feces by water exchange. Once the cecum is reached, air insufflation is used during withdrawal for mucosal inspection. All patients start the endoscopy unsedated but sedation and analgesia are administered if needed or asked for (midazolam 2, 5 mg / pethidine 50 mg). When progression with water fails, switch to air insufflation is made. Pain scores are registred on a VAS (0 =no pain, 10 =maximal pain). Patient satisfaction and willing to repeat the procedure are also scored on a VAS (respectively: 0 =very low, 10 =high/ 0 =not willing to repeat, 10 =willing). Results : 38 patients (18 F, 20 M) {{with a mean age}} of 57 ± 11 yrs are included. Indications for colonoscopy are: cancer screening 24 %, polyp surveillance 18 %, diagnostic 58 %. The primary endpoint, unsedated succesful cecal intubation, is reached in 27 patients (71, 2 %). The global cecal intubation rate is 94, 7 % (n= 36). Mean insertion time was 14 ± 6 min. Mean length of the colonoscope at the cecum was 82 ± 10 cm. Mean volume of water infused upon arrival to the cecum is 332 ± 172 ml. In 11 patients (28, 9 %) temporary switch to air insufflation during insertion is needed (6 at the hepatic flexure, 5 in the sigmoid). Men reach the endpoint more readily than women (85 % vs. 55, 6 %, p = 0, 046). Age doesn’t make a difference (p = 0, 62). Maximum mean pain score during insertion is 3, 1 ± 2, 7; pain at time of discharge is 1, 5 ± 2, 2. Patient satisfaction is 9, 2 ± 1, 2, willingness to repeat 9, 7 ± 0, 7. Mean withdrawal time is 8, 8 + 4, 6 min and the adenoma detection rate is 21 %. Conclusions : Water-infused colonoscopy is a promising and simple technique to perform complete unsedated colonoscopy.

We observed that the interaction of 3 CAs with another cytotoxic compound, cisplatin, showed potentiation of activity by 2. 5 -fold. The chelation of cellular iron by 3 CA is hypothesized as a possible explanation for the loss of artemisinin activity...|$|R
40|$|Duodenal acid {{has been}} {{suggested}} to be of importance for dyspeptic symptoms. We investigated the effects of acid on duodenal mechanosensitivity and antroduodenal motility in 10 healthy subjects before and during duodenal infusion of acid (0. 1 N HCl) or water by using a combined barostat-manometry assembly. During acid infusion, increased sensitivity to balloon distension was seen, with reduced perception (P = 0. 04) and discomfort thresholds (P = 0. 06) and higher intensity of discomfort (P = 0. 02) compared with water. Higher balloon volumes were seen during acid infusion, indicating decreased tone (P = 0. 05). Large volume waves were more prevalent during acid than <b>water</b> <b>infusion</b> (P = 0. 009). The acid infusion suppressed antral contractions (P = 0. 04) and {{increased the number of}} contractions in the proximal duodenum (P = 0. 02) compared with before the infusion. In conclusion, duodenal acid enhances mechanical sensitivity in the duodenum, affects gastroduodenal motor function, and might be of importance for dyspeptic symptoms. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The vasorelaxing {{activity}} of the aqueous extract of fish Balistes capriscus skin (AEBc) on mesenteric arterial bed (MAB) of rats was studied. The bolus injections of AEBc (bolus of 5. 1, 10. 2, 20. 5, and 41. 1 mg) significantly inhibited, in a concentration-dependent manner, the maximal contractile response induced by methoxamine (30 M) in MAB. The vasodilatation action of AEBc is not mediated through -adrenoceptors or cyclo-oxigenase, since it was not affected by propranolol (20 M) or diclofenac sodium (3 M). The vasodilator response induced by subsequent addition of AEBc Balistes capriscus in bolus was significantly reduced in <b>water</b> <b>infusion</b> for endothelium removal. Treatment with an inhibitor of NO synthase (l-NAME, 10 M) decreased AEBc effect. The guanylate cyclase inhibitor methylene blue (MB, 100 M) had no significant effect on AEBc-induced vasodilatation. These {{results suggest that the}} vasorelaxing effect of AEBc is mediated by endothelium-dependent (NO/EDRF) and endothelium-independent neurally induced vasorelaxation from nonadrenergic and noncholinergic nerves (NO) ...|$|R
30|$|Table  3 also {{highlights}} the antioxidant compounds in IOSC extracted by hot <b>water</b> <b>infusion</b> method. Total phenolics, flavonoids, flavonols and rosmarinic acid content of unfermented IOSC samples (UFT) were 73.81 [*]±[*] 11.24 mg GAE/g DW, 2.66 [*]±[*] 0.16 mg QE/g DW, 2.00 [*]±[*] 0.09 mg QE/g DW, and 1.13 [*]±[*] 0.25 mg/g DW, respectively. The level for all antioxidant components was much higher in UFT {{compared to those}} in the partial (PFT) and full (FFT) fermentation of IOSC (Table  3). In the partial fermented of IOSC (PFT), the level of the estimated total phenolics, flavonoids, flavonols and rosmarinic acid were 69.37 [*]±[*] 10.08 mg GAE/g DW, 2.24 [*]±[*] 0.08 mg QE/g DW, 1.81 [*]±[*] 0.11 mg QE/g DW and 0.70 [*]±[*] 0.09 mg/g DW respectively. Meanwhile, there was a further decrease in the FFT of IOSC with the level of total phenolics, flavonoids, flavonols and rosmarinic acid being 42.70 [*]±[*] 7.56 mg GAE/g DW, 1.73 [*]±[*] 0.03 mg QE/g DW, 1.86 [*]±[*] 0.12 mg QE/g DW, and 0.10 [*]±[*] 0.04 mg/g DW respectively.|$|R
