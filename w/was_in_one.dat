5|$|More pro-Chetnik coups {{occurred}} {{in the second half}} of April. The first <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> of the remaining battalions of the Romanija Partisan Detachment, followed by all three battalions of the Zvijezda Partisan Detachment. The political commissars of every company were killed. By the start of May, coups had also {{occurred in}} battalions of the Kalinovik Partisan Detachment and the Foča Volunteer Detachment.|$|E
5|$|On December 20, Davis <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> {{of twelve}} Thunderbolts patrolling Mindoro when eight A6M Zeroes were spotted {{attempting}} to ambush {{the flight from}} behind. Davis managed to rake the cockpit of one Zero and kill the pilot, earning him his fifth victory to become a flying ace. Immediately after this, however, Davis' P-47 was stuck by machine-gun fire from another aircraft, damaging the propeller and left wing components. On December 24, {{on a mission to}} escort several B-24s on a bombing mission of the Japanese-held Clark Field at Manila, Davis shot down two more Zeroes, {{part of a group of}} Japanese aircraft attempting to harass the bombers. Davis was awarded a Silver Star for this action.|$|E
5|$|To {{avoid the}} need to {{purchase}} agreements for running under surface buildings, the tunnels were bored below roadways, where construction could be carried out without charge. At {{the northern end of}} the railway, {{the need to}} pass deep beneath the bed of the River Thames and the medieval street pattern of the City of London constrained the arrangement of the tunnels on the approach to King William Street station. Because of the proximity of the station to the river, steeply inclined tunnels were required {{to the west of the}} station. Because of the narrow street under which they ran, they were bored one above the other rather than side by side as elsewhere. The outbound tunnel was the lower and steeper of the two. The tunnels converged immediately before the station, which <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> large tunnel and comprised a single track with a platform on each side. The other terminus at Stockwell was also constructed in a single tunnel but with tracks on each side of a central platform.|$|E

5|$|William {{took over}} an English {{government}} {{that was more}} complex than the Norman system. England was divided into shires or counties, which were further divided into either hundreds or wapentakes. Each shire was administered by a royal official called a sheriff, who roughly had the same status as a Norman viscount. A sheriff was responsible for royal justice and collecting royal revenue. To oversee his expanded domain, William was forced to travel even more than he had as duke. He crossed {{back and forth between the}} continent and England at least 19 times between 1067 and his death. William spent most of his time in England between the Battle of Hastings and 1072, and after that he spent the majority of his time in Normandy. Government was still centred on William's household; when he <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> part of his realms, decisions would be made for other parts of his domains and transmitted through a communication system that made use of letters and other documents. William also appointed deputies who could make decisions while he was absent, especially if the absence was expected to be lengthy. Usually this was a member of William's close family– frequently his half-brother Odo or his wife Matilda. Sometimes deputies were appointed to deal with specific issues.|$|E
5|$|For {{reasons of}} security, Sturmabteilung Koch was {{dispersed}} around several {{locations in the}} Rhineland until it received orders for the operation against Fort Eben-Emael and the three bridges to begin. Preliminary orders were received on 9 May, ordering the separated detachments {{to move to a}} pre-arranged concentration area, and shortly afterwards a second order arrived, informing the assault force that Fall Gelb was to begin at 05:25 on 10 May. At 04:30, forty-two gliders carrying the 493 airborne troops that formed the assault force were lifted off from two airfields in Cologne, the armada of gliders and transport aircraft turning south towards their objectives. The aircraft maintained strict radio silence, forcing the pilots to rely on a chain of signal fires that pointed towards Belgium; the radio silence also ensured that senior commanders of the assault force could not be informed that the tow-ropes on one of the gliders had snapped, forcing the glider to land inside Germany. The pilot of a second glider released his tow-rope prematurely, and was unable to land near its objective. Both gliders were carrying troops assigned to Group Granite and were destined to assault Fort Eben-Emael, thereby leaving the group understrength; it also left it under the command of Oberleutnant Witzig's second-in-command, as Witzig <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> of the gliders forced to land. The remaining gliders were released from their tow-ropes twenty miles away from their objectives at an altitude of , which was deemed high enough for the gliders to land by the three bridges and on top of the fort, and also maintain a steep dive angle to further ensure they landed correctly. After the Ju-52's released the gliders and began turning away, Belgian anti-aircraft artillery positions detected them and opened fire. This alerted the defences in the area to the presence of the gliders.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{financial}} problems {{the filming of}} Eraserhead was haphazard, regularly stopping and starting again. It <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> such break in 1974 that Lynch created a short film titled The Amputee, which revolved around a woman with two amputated legs (played by Jack Nance's wife, Catherine Coulson) reading aloud a letter and having her stumps washed by a doctor (played by Lynch himself).|$|E
25|$|Travel to Finland {{was very}} difficult, because the German Reich forbade transit of armaments and war {{equipment}} across its territory (including the occupied Polish territories). This <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> respect a simple honoring of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, {{but was also}} because Teleki had not given the Wehrmacht permission to use Hungarian railway lines for attacking Poland. The German government was also unhappy that Teleki's government had harbored thousands of Polish refugees after the German and Soviet invasion of Poland because of the Hungarian-Polish friendship.|$|E

25|$|The {{band had}} their first gig stint in a club in Makati City called Where Else? It <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> of those gigs that ONL met Toti Dalmacion, {{formerly}} of Groove Nation, a local music store famous for rare and hard-to-find vinyl records. Dalmacion was already toying {{with the idea of}} establishing an independent label that he would call Terno Recordings. The label would showcase unsigned and talented Filipino artists with a unique sound and style that could (hopefully) pass international standards. He proposed that ONL be the flagship artist for the label. A one-album deal was signed.|$|E

25|$|On 29 December 1993 Union Rotorua {{was about}} 27 {{miles south of}} Sydney Heads, en route for Melbourne, when a fire {{broke out in the}} gas turbine house. It was {{established}} that the seat of the fire <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> of the cubicles of the 6.6 kilovolt switchboard, which distributed power from the gas turbine generator to the propulsion motors and auxiliary electrical systems. Initial attempts to fight the fire with extinguishers proved to be ineffective and a decision was made to utilise the fixed fire fighting medium and flood the space with CO2. This was effective in extinguishing the fire. With the high voltage switchboard out of commission, the vessel was towed to Sydney, where it remained for three months undergoing repairs.|$|E
25|$|Lieutenant General Leonard Wood, Military Governor of Cuba, {{asked for}} {{the wreck of the}} Maine to be removed on October 1900. Secretary of the Navy John Davis Long {{approved}} the plan. A call for proposals was made on November 19, and five bids were received. Chamberlain & Co., of Chicago, Illinois, agreed to remove the wreck using balloons, hydraulic jacks, and compressed air for nothing in return for 97 percent of the profits on all sales of relics from the wreck (the government would receive the remainder). After an on-site inspection, Chamberlain claimed the ship <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> piece. But by April, when the time period for work to begin expired, no construction bond had been posted and no work was done. Chamberlain & Co. defaulted on their contract in July.|$|E
25|$|The {{politicians}} of the 1850s were {{acting in a}} society in which the traditional restraints that suppressed sectional conflict in the 1820s and 1850s– the most important of which being the stability of the two-party system– were being eroded as this rapid extension of democracy went forward in the North and South. It was an era when the mass political party galvanized voter participation to 80% or 90% turnout rates, and a time in which politics formed an essential component of American mass culture. Historians agree that political involvement was a larger concern to the average American in the 1850s than today. Politics <b>was,</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> of its functions, a form of mass entertainment, a spectacle with rallies, parades, and colorful personalities. Leading politicians, moreover, often served as a focus for popular interests, aspirations, and values.|$|E

25|$|Milan Drajicevic, {{the coach}} of the UBC Thunderbirds, {{happened}} to be at the practice when Cloutier was injured, and he suggested the Canucks use Levesque, UBC's second backup. Because of amateur call-up rules, the Canucks could not recruit the T-Birds' top two goaltenders, Kevin Swanson and Robert Filc. At the time Levesque <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> of the many UBC libraries studying for a geography exam he had the next morning. His friends and teammates scoured the campus, and when they found him, he assumed he was the victim of a prank. He was not convinced otherwise until he {{received a phone call from}} Jon Wall, Manager of Scouting and Player Information for the Canucks. Once he realized the situation was real, he quickly received a one-time exemption from Canadian Interuniversity Sport rules to play in the NHL, and drove to General Motors Place to take a spot on the bench.|$|E
25|$|In 1952, Florence {{attempted}} to swim the 26 miles between Catalina Island and the California coastline. As she began, she was flanked by small boats that watched for sharks and {{were prepared to}} help her if she got hurt or grew tired. After about 15 hours a thick fog set in. Florence began to doubt her ability, and she told her mother, who <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> of the boats, {{that she did not}} think she could make it. She swam for another hour before asking to be pulled out, unable to see the coastline due to the fog. As she sat in the boat, she found out she had stopped swimming just one mile away from her destination. Two months later, she tried again. The same thick fog set in, but she succeeded in reaching Catalina. She said that she kept a mental image of the shoreline in her mind while she swam. She later swam the Catalina channel on two additional occasions.|$|E
25|$|During lulls in the shelling, Hemingway {{repeatedly}} told Walton {{how much}} he hated his mother. Hemingway loathed her because she had accepted money from him, even while she condemned the books he wrote on moral grounds. Hemingway later saved Walton's life during the battle. Hemingway recognized {{the sound of an}} oncoming German plane, and threw Walton out of the jeep they were riding in just moments before it was strafed. The two men parted, but met again on New Year's Eve in London. Walton told Hemingway {{that he was going to}} have dinner with Hemingway's wife, Martha Gellhorn. Hemingway and Gellhorn were on the verge of divorce after several rocky years of marriage. Hemingway invited himself to the dinner. Hemingway ridiculed and taunted his wife all night, and Walton stood up for her. In the early hours of the next morning, Hemingway stripped to his underwear, put a bucket on his head, and banged on Gellhorn's door with a mop, demanding to be let in. Walton moved into the Hôtel Ritz in Paris in January 1945, covering the war from the liberated city. Hemingway, now openly dating Mary Welsh even though his divorce was not yet final, <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> of the happiest moods of his life. He bragged openly to Walton about his powerful sex life and happiness.|$|E
