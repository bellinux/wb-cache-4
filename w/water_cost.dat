The other buildings were so riddled with shot and shell that they afforded scarcely any shelter. Many of the besieged made holes in the ground or under the banks of the intrenchments; but the deaths from sunstroke and fever were even more numerous than those caused by the murderous and incessant fire.|$|E

50|$|A {{supply of}} a good will be applied to most {{important}} wants first and least important wants last. When there is a shortage, all else being equal, the price increases. The smaller supply is being used for the most important wants, but is not being used for the least important wants. In this sense, we can say the increase in price represents the increase in value which the last unit of the supply is filling. Before <b>water</b> <b>cost</b> very little and was used for washing and watering plants. Now, since {{there is not enough}} for washing and watering plants and it is instead being used exclusively to drink and cook—the value we attribute to those activities is, in a sense, communicated through the higher price. The price reflects that importance of the last use of a supply—and in this case the supply was truncated to only allow for the more important uses.|$|E

Citizens of the villages currently spend 10 % of their income on water from the pumped water system. This report details the selection and design of a cistern water system to provide fresh water for Paulette and Phaeton. An analysis of other water sources provided by desalination is also presented. The cistern system is chosen over the desalination alternatives due to its lower cost, ease of construction and maintenance, and ability to be constructed from local materials. In addition, a full life cycle cost analysis of the cistern system is presented. The resulting life cycle <b>water</b> <b>costs</b> are higher than the water delivered by the current pumped water system. However, the analysis shows that the operating costs for the cistern system are lower than the pumped water system. The suggested course of action is to donate the cistern systems to less fortunate families in Paulette and Phaeton to reduce their <b>water</b> <b>costs.</b> The installation of these systems will stimulate the local economy. Another suggestion from this report is that the pumped water system be properly maintained and an upgrade to this system could also reduce the <b>water</b> <b>costs</b> for the community...|$|R

40|$|Irrigated {{agriculture}} in the European Union (EU) is currently adapting to new conditions including {{the principle of the}} full recovery of <b>water</b> service <b>costs,</b> the reduction of water availability and the increasing variability in the prices of agricultural products. This has fostered an increasing number of economic analyses to investigate farmers' behaviour by means of mathematical programming techniques including Positive Mathematical Programming (PMP) models. However PMP models generally consider only activities observed in the reference period even if, under new policies and market conditions, farmers can adopt irrigation techniques they have not used previously. In particular, under increasing <b>water</b> <b>costs</b> or decreasing <b>water</b> availability, farmers can introduce Deficit Irrigation (DI) techniques that might not have been profitable earlier. We propose an extension of the PMP approach to include DI techniques not observed in the reference period. These alternative techniques are identified by means of a crop growth model developed by the FAO. We apply our methodology to a Mediterranean area using three sets of simulations involving: increases in <b>water</b> <b>costs,</b> reductions in <b>water</b> availability, and changes in the prices of the products obtained from irrigated crops. Lacking observations of alternative irrigation techniques, our approach captures potential technology adjustments and assesses the impact of changes in water policy and market conditions in a better way. Simulation results show that increasing <b>water</b> <b>costs</b> do not motivate adoption of DI techniques. Rather, farmers are induced to save water by switching from full irrigation to deficit irrigation when water availability is reduced or the prices of irrigated crops are increased.

How proactive vs. reactive managerial styles moderate the effects of management information systems on <b>water</b> <b>cost</b> saving and water quality enhancement is analyzed. Relationships are explored using data collected from 122 general services directors in Spanish public hospitals. The findings show a positive effect of sophisticated management information systems on the achievement of water policies focused on cost saving and quality enhancement.

40|$|Department of Agriculture {{to assess}} the impact of water {{scarcity}} and climate on irrigation decisions for producers of specialty crops, wheat, and forage crops. We estimate an irrigation management model for major crops in the West Coast (California, Oregon and Washington), which includes a farm-level equation of irrigated share and crop-specific equations of technology adoption and water application rate (orchard/vineyard, vegetable, wheat, alfalfa, hay, and pas-ture). We find that economic and physical water scarcity, climate, and extreme weather, such as frost, extreme heat and drought, significantly impact producers ’ irrigation decisions. Producers use sprinkler technologies or additional water applications to mitigate risk of crop damage from extreme weather. Water application rates are least responsive to surface <b>water</b> <b>cost</b> or groundwa-ter well depth for producers of orchard/vineyard. Water supply institutions influence producers’ irrigation decisions. Producers who receive water from federal agencies use higher water appli-cation rates and are less likely to adopt water-saving irrigation technologies for some crops. Institutional arrangements, including access to distinct water sources (surface or ground) and whether surface <b>water</b> <b>cost</b> is fee based, also affect the responsiveness of water application rates to changes in surface <b>water</b> <b>cost.</b> The analysis provides valuable information about how producers in irrigated agricultural production systems would respond and adapt to water pricing policies and climate change...|$|E
