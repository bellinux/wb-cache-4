I consider that I <b>went</b> <b>through</b> <b>all</b> stages, from popcorn to dance, club and pop music, so I considered that I have reached a maturity which allows me to release a song which I like, which makes me move in a club and makes me want to hear it on the radio, and I'm very fulfilled.|$|E
5|$|The {{choice of}} route through Innherred was largely without much debate, as the line {{naturally}} <b>went</b> <b>through</b> <b>all</b> the towns {{and most of}} the important villages. Sunnan was a natural place to halt construction, as it is located {{at the foot of the}} lake of Snåsavatnet, allowing connection with steam ships. Scheduled services on Snåsavatnet started in 1871 with SS Dina, which was replaced with SS Bonden in 1885. From 1904 to 1921, Bonden was supplemented with MS St. Olaf, although SS Bonden remained in corresponding service with the train until 1926.|$|E

It is said that he heard from over 1,000 men, and learned over 600,000 traditions.|$|E

25|$|After his father's death {{he spent}} four years at the University of Paris, where he began the study of Greek under Adrianus Turnebus.

He read Homer in twenty-one days, and then <b>went</b> <b>through</b> <b>all</b> the other Greek poets, orators and historians, forming a grammar for himself as he went along. From Greek, at the suggestion of Guillaume Postel, he proceeded to attack Hebrew, and then Arabic; of both he acquired a respectable knowledge.|$|E
25|$|On 2 March 1896, with 87 against 27 votes, Parliament passed {{legislation}} approving a railway from Hell to Sunnan. Costs were estimated at 8.75 million Norwegian krone (NOK), of which 15 percent {{was to be}} financed with local grants and the remainder by the state. Construction was scheduled to take 15 years. The decision initially called for the railway {{to be built in}} two stages, with the split at Rinnan in Levanger—the site of the military camp Rinnleiret. Final approval of construction was made by Parliament on 11 June 1898. The choice of route through Innherred was largely without much debate, as the line naturally <b>went</b> <b>through</b> <b>all</b> the towns and most of the important villages.

25|$|Between 1503 and 1505, Nephon {{de facto}} led the Church of Wallachia, {{until he came}} into {{conflict}} with the prince. The conflict arose because of the intransigence of the patriarch in refusing to celebrate the marriage of Radu's older sister Calpea with the Moldovan boyar Bogdan Logothete, who had already been married. Threatened by Radu, Nephon gathered the people, made a speech, and excommunicated the groom. He also prophesied accidents, left the patriarchal vestments on the altar and departed the church, taking to a deserted hut. In {{order to avoid the}} outcry of the people, Radu tried to placate the old man with flattering words, promises and gifts and begged him to forgive his brother-in-law, but Nephon remained adamant and left for Macedonia, taking with him two of his students. In Macedonia he <b>went</b> <b>through</b> <b>all</b> the towns performing missionary preaching. On his return to Mount Athos, he appeared unrecognizable to the monks of the Monastery of Dionysiou, who initially thought him a simple herdsman.|$|E

25|$|However, with a Militant-dominated Labour {{council in}} Liverpool having been elected in 1983, Heffer found {{increasing}} trouble in his constituency. The Liverpool Labour Party adopted Militant's policy of a 'deficit budget'. This included no cuts to jobs and services, and no rent and rates increases higher than inflation, {{and a promise}} to increase services and confront central government with the £270 million stolen, it claimed, in grants from the city since the Conservatives {{came to power in}} 1979. It was voted into office by a landslide. The administration produced a financial crisis, since the budget, set in April by the outgoing Tory-Liberal coalition, included unallocated cuts of £6 million, including 1000 job losses, which the administration cancelled, and an extra 1000 jobs had been promised instead. When the council met on 29 March 1984 it was told clearly that the Militant proposed 'deficit budget' contained an illegal £30 million deficit, but no alternative could get a majority and it <b>went</b> <b>through.</b> <b>All</b> but seven Labour councillors stood by the budget, and Heffer supported the council in its demands of government and after a series of meetings with the Secretary of State for the Environment Patrick Jenkin, the government eventually gave way and allowed practically all of the budget.|$|E
500|$|The {{subspecies}} creatures, {{which were}} created from Radu's blood, originally began as local Romanian men in rubber suits. The men were filmed on over-scaled sets {{to simulate the}} miniature size of the creatures. The performances of the Romanian men, along with {{the design of the}} rubber suits, caused director Ted Nicolaou to rethink his approach. Nicolaou brought in animator David W. Allen to assist him in creating [...] "more magical" [...] looking subspecies creatures. Allen <b>went</b> <b>through</b> <b>all</b> of the film footage that contained the Romanian extras in their rubber suits with the film's editor in order to find usable footage before and after the men enter the scene. Allen would use the isolated footage to develop a new background for the animated creatures he would later create. Allen created two puppet types, displayed in front of a bluescreen: a stop-motion puppet and a rod puppet. Each of the puppet types were composed of foam rubber, and held similar skeletal systems. Some differences between the two types include tension filled joints for the stop-motion puppet, while the rod puppet was looser. The flexibility of the rod-puppet allowed for faster movements, which were needed occasionally for real-time filming.|$|E

2500|$|The song is one out {{of three}} Elliott-produced records on After the Storm, {{commissioned}} by J Records head and executive producer Clive Davis after the release of Elliott's acclaimed studio album Under Construction (2002) and the delay of Monica's original third studio album All Eyez on Me the year before. It was conceived during a studio session week in Miami in early 2003, and was produced as a sequel to [...] "So Gone," [...] another Elliott track. In an interview with MTV News at the 2003 BET Awards, Monica stated that [...] "'Knock Knock' is [...] like a follow-up to 'So Gone,' just saying that, 'All right, we <b>went</b> <b>through</b> <b>all</b> that stuff, now it's time for you to get lost. This {{is the end of the}} road for you.' So, it's kind of like a 'get back' record." [...] Commenting on the recording process, she added: [...] "She [...] doesn't have any fear [...] When she goes in the studio, her goal is to be creative and to give something new and she could care less what else is current. And she creates new trends by doing that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sometimes {{the digital}} effects are not necessary, {{even when they}} are expected. For the scene where Joe Morton suffers a fatal seizure, the crew used an under-crank {{shooting}} technique, to speed up the movements of Morton's character, coupled with Morton's own shaking. In [...] "Precipice", John Wash assisted the digital effects team when the production crew was filming a scene that was going to involve Clark X-raying a car with a group of teenagers in it. To achieve the effect of Clark X-raying a SUV, John Wash had all the actors in the SUV sit on apple boxes to get them at the representative height they would be in the SUV. The actors then <b>went</b> <b>through</b> <b>all</b> the motions they needed in order to [...] "sell the X-ray effect". For season two, John Wash added prosthetic veins to Welling's hands, which would move when he moved, to help simulate the kryptonite poisoning his character would undergo. Then, in post-production, Entity FX would add a green hue to them, and digitally hide the prosthetics when Clark was not affected by the kryptonite; in the first season, there were no physical prosthetics and all effects were done digitally.|$|E
