50|$|Often {{the well}} {{efficiency}} is determined from {{this sort of}} test, this is a percentage indicating the fraction of total observed drawdown in a pumping well {{which is due to}} aquifer losses (as opposed to being due to flow through the <b>well</b> <b>screen</b> and inside the borehole). A perfectly efficient well, with perfect <b>well</b> <b>screen</b> and where the water flows inside the well in a frictionless manner would have 100% efficiency. Unfortunately well efficiency is hard to compare between wells because it depends on the characteristics of the aquifer too (the same amount of well losses compared to a more transmissive aquifer would give a lower efficiency).|$|E
50|$|Typically, a {{borehole}} {{used as a}} {{water well}} is completed by installing a vertical pipe (casing) and <b>well</b> <b>screen</b> to keep the borehole from caving. This also helps prevent surface contaminants from entering the borehole and protects any installed pump from drawing in sand and sediment. Oil and natural gas wells are completed in a similar, albeit usually more complex, manner.|$|E

5000|$|Multi-screen casing completion: the MLS is {{installed}} {{inside of a}} multi-screened steel or PVC well. Each <b>well</b> <b>screen</b> segment has a sand or gravel pack {{between it and the}} borehole wall, and is thus isolated from monitoring zones above and below by a grout or bentonite seal. The MLS is then constructed inside of the multi-screened well. This adds another step to the well installation process (i.e., first installing a multi-screened well), but has several advantages. First, installing conventional steel or PVC wells is straightforward and routine for most drilling contractors. Consequently, it is not necessary that the drilling contractor have expertise in installing multilevel monitoring systems. Once the multi-screened wells have been installed and developed, the drilling contractor's job is done, and the multilevel systems can often be installed by field technicians, often at a lower cost. Second, the various monitoring zones can be developed using standard well development equipment and procedures before the multilevel monitoring systems are installed in the wells. Finally, installing multilevel systems inside multi-screened wells may simplify the task of decommissioning the wells once they are no longer needed. Most of the multilevel systems can be constructed {{so that they can be}} easily removed from the multi-screened wells. Then, the multi-screened wells can be pressure-grouted or drilled out using standard well decommissioning procedures.|$|E
50|$|The pump's primary {{components}} {{consist of}} the pump handle, the riser main which carries {{the water to}} the surface, the pump cylinder which pushes water up the riser main, and the connecting rod which connects the pump handle to the pump cylinder {{at the bottom of}} the well. After a borehole is drilled, a well casing is inserted into the hole to prevent the erosion of the borehole walls. The India Mark II needs a borehole with a minimum diameter of 10 cm. The casing has a <b>well</b> <b>screen</b> to allow water to pass into the casing but keeps rocks and dirt out. A pump cylinder is attached to the bottom of a series of pipes call riser mains or riser pipes and sits below the water surface in the well once installed. The riser main will carry the water from the pump cylinder to the surface. Inside the riser main, a series of rods connect the pump handle to the top of the pump cylinder {{at the bottom of the}} well. The reciprocating up and down movement of the pump handle raises and lowers the connecting rod thus raising and lowering the plunger of the pump cylinder. Two one-way water valves inside the cylinder suck water into the cylinder on the upstroke and force the water into the riser main on the down stroke. Water flows up the riser main and out of the spout at the top of the well head assembly.|$|E
5000|$|Prior to the 1970s, {{collection}} of discrete groundwater samples from multiple depths in the subsurface required {{the installation of}} well clusters or nested wells [...] Well clusters consist of a closely spaced group of monitoring wells, each well completed to a different depth in individual boreholes. Well clusters were first used in the 1950s at contaminated sites. Because {{there is only one}} <b>well</b> <b>screen</b> in each borehole, there is little risk of vertical connection between zones. The individual wells in the cluster must be installed near one another (e.g., â‰¤10 ft. apart), so that the head data obtained from them is a result of variations in the vertical head and not horizontal gradients. Also, care must be taken to avoid installing clusters of wells with overlapping screens and sand packs - this may allow vertical movement of contamination between the wells in the presence of vertical hydraulic gradients. Installation of wells clusters can be expensive because of increased drilling costs associated with drilling multiple borings, especially in fractured rock. [...] Nested wells are wells constructed of two or more well screens and casing assemblies of different lengths installed in a single borehole. The key drawback of nested wells is that {{it can be difficult to}} effectively seal the portions of the borehole between the monitored zones. Nested wells were popular in the 1970s but many seal failures occurred. For this reason, nested wells are discouraged or prohibited in many areas. [...] There are typically three separate monitoring intervals in nested wells, although more monitoring intervals have been constructed in very deep monitoring wells. The risk of hydraulically connecting the various monitoring zones is inversely proportional to the thickness of the seals between the monitoring intervals. Thus, shallow nested wells with many monitoring zones are more at risk of hydraulic failure than deep nested wells with fewer monitoring zones.|$|E

40|$|With {{respect to}} the {{detailed}} survey of underground water contamination, a question arises {{about the effect of}} the monitoring well equipment on the representativeness of the underground water samples. The <b>well</b> <b>screen</b> {{is one of the key}} well parts. The active and passive sampling in this part of the well has an influence on the contaminant stratification or redistribution. Should we take the original sample, one of the possibilities, according to the author, is to observe the so-called regeneration time. This experiment aspired to determine how great was the actual influence of the <b>well</b> <b>screen</b> and what time delay should be kept after inserting or handling with the sampling equipment. For these purposes, a physical model of the flow medium was built with a <b>well</b> <b>screen</b> mounted. A series of tracing experiments at changing parameters of the porous medium hydraulic conductivity and <b>well</b> <b>screen</b> perforation served to measure the time decrease in the NaCl tracer concentration inside the <b>well</b> <b>screen.</b> The measured data were approximated analytically using the so-called dilution method; the flow speed inside the <b>well</b> <b>screen</b> was obtained as a function of the perforation and hydraulic conductivity of the medium. Furthermore, the so-called drainage effect of the well was taken into account, as it is also influenced by the <b>well</b> <b>screen.</b> It is value was compared with the analytical and numerical solution. The Visual Modflow software was used for numerical modelling, which enabled modelling of the designed equipment and verificatio...|$|E
40|$|Minimizing well {{clogging}} by particles {{is considered}} one of the most important aspects of well design. Well design standards restrict the attraction of particles by limiting the flow velocity at the borehole wall. The corresponding limitation of the well capacity is especially problematic for the feasibility of projects in aquifers consisting of fine sand. To investigate the possibility of extending the current design standards, the real flow velocities in a number of wells were analyzed, using data from vertical flowmeter logs. Groundwater models were used to deduce a simulated flowmeter log. Comparing the simulated flowmeter log to the measured flowmeter log, provides information on the performance of different parts of the <b>well</b> <b>screen.</b> For a number of wells, the measured and simulated flowmeter logs agree quite well, which gives confidence in the approach. In a number of other wells parts of the <b>well</b> <b>screen</b> did not contribute or appeared to underperform significantly (in most cases the lower part), which is in accordance with experiences from contractors that perform vertical flowmeter logs. Since underperformance of one part of the <b>well</b> <b>screen</b> must be compensated by the other part, design flow velocities are more likely to be exceeded in the other part in that case (especially in the upper screen section). Design exceeding in part of the <b>well</b> <b>screen</b> could not be correlated with sand production. It is more likely that sand production is caused by the (unintentional) screening of sand layers that are too fine in comparison to the grain size of the gravel pack. Possible causes for an uneven flow distribution were investigated. Partial well screens produce more water from the end of the <b>well</b> <b>screen</b> than from the middle part, because water can approach the <b>well</b> <b>screen</b> from more directions (i. e. laterally and vertically). The potential influence of head losses due to friction is usually minimized by choosing a sufficiently large <b>well</b> <b>screen</b> diameter. The most important reasons for underperforming <b>well</b> <b>screen</b> sections appear to be differences in the grade of clogging of the concerning part of the borehole. These differences are initiated during the procedure of well construction and well development. Due to an increase in the overpressure with depth inside the borehole during the drilling procedure (density of drilling fluid with suspended sediments is relatively high), more persistent filter cakes are formed in the deeper parts of the well. Well development techniques that treat the whole well, are therefore likely to be more successful in the upper part. This is enhanced when extreme flow velocities occur during well development, leading to significant head losses due to friction and thereby reducing the effectiveness in the lower part of the screen. When partial removal of the filter cake is achieved, preferential flow paths are created which subsequently complicate the treatment of other parts of the borehole. This can explain why techniques like overpumping and surging tend to be more effective in the upper part of the <b>well</b> <b>screen,</b> especially when long well screens are concerned. Wells in aquifers consisting of fine sand seem to be more likely to end up with an uneven flow distribution than wells in coarse sand. In one well, sectional surging proved to be effective to treat the underperforming lower part of the <b>well</b> <b>screen,</b> suggesting a more frequent use of this technique...|$|E
40|$|A {{detailed}} three-dimensional {{numerical simulation}} of ground water {{flow into the}} screen of a monitoring well during â€˜â€˜low-flowâ€™ â€™ purging and sampling provides a means to investigate the actual monitoring zone (i. e., â€˜â€˜where the water comes fromâ€™â€™) achieved during these sampling operations. Such a simulation allows for examination {{of the influence of}} several var-iables such as pump placement, <b>well</b> <b>screen</b> and sand-pack configuration, and aquifer heterogeneities on the actual part of the aquifer that is interrogated. In these simulations, ground water was sampled from {{the entire length of the}} <b>well</b> <b>screen,</b> although as could be expected, flux was higher into the <b>well</b> <b>screen</b> from zones of higher permeability, if present. Further-more, at low flow rates, pump position within the screen had little influence on the vertical distribution of flux into the well, and in all cases where a monitoring well partially penetrates an aquifer, the zone monitored extended above and below the <b>well</b> <b>screen.</b> At the low flow rates examined (250 and 500 mL/min), there was no increase in flux (from the aquifer into the <b>well</b> <b>screen)</b> adjacent to the pump intake. The major implications of these findings are that a detection monitoring approach predicated on sampling from the entire <b>well</b> <b>screen</b> is valid when purging at low flow rates (i. e., contaminants are not â€˜â€˜missedâ€™â€™), or conversely, that discrete vertical sampling may only be accomplished with very short well screens due to potential concentration averaging that would occur along the entire length of a screen. Finally, the simulation results empha-size that aquifer heterogeneities must always be recognized and considered in ground water monitoring design. Aquifer heterogeneities have the most significant influence on the actual monitoring zone (and therefore the potential to â€˜â€˜hitâ€™ â€™ or â€˜â€˜missâ€™ â€™ contaminants in a detection program). Pump placement and purging rate have little influence on the vertical interval that is sampled (as compared to screen length and placement) and therefore should be selected only so as to minimize sampling artifacts and promote sampling efficiency...|$|E

40|$|Iron {{biofouling}} of wells {{can significantly}} impact {{the performance of}} a groundwater extraction system. A subsurface drainage scheme (Wakool, Australia) designed to reduce waterlogging was used to identify some of the relationships between aquifer properties and well biofouling. Piezometers drilled radially one metre from two biofouled wells showed that during normal well operation the concentration of dissolved iron (Fe 2 +) entering the groundwater well was highly localised around the site and with depth. CCTV survey of the biofouling on the well screens supported these findings of localised iron concentrations. Dissolved oxygen (DO) measured during pumping and under non-pumping conditions (aquifer DO) showed that oxygen was not a limiting factor, whereas stalked bacteria (Gallionella sp.) were only found in the biofouled wells. The wellhead water therefore represents only a composite of all the waters entering the well and does not indicate the possibility of localised iron concentrations in a shallow aquifer. The degree of iron biofouling within a groundwater well is therefore related directly to the presence of dissolved iron in the groundwater, as well as various oxidative processes occurring as the groundwater enters the <b>well</b> <b>screen</b> and its subsequent extraction. The distribution of iron biofilms on the <b>well</b> <b>screen</b> reflects these processes; however, the presence of well biofouling cannot always be linked to a decrease in <b>well</b> <b>screen</b> performance, but can {{have an impact on the}} overall performance of the groundwater extraction system...|$|E

Compared with caverns as storage vessels, {{compressed air energy storage}} in aquifers (CAESA) has the advantages of wide availability and lower costs.

In this paper, we investigated the influences of the <b>well</b> <b>screen</b> length on CAESA system performance using an integrated wellbore-reservoir simulator (T 2 WELL/EOS 3). The results showed that the <b>well</b> <b>screen</b> length can affect the distribution of the initial gas bubble and that a system with a fully penetrating wellbore can obtain acceptably stable pressurized air and better energy efficiencies. Subsequently, we investigated the impact of the energy storage scale and the target aquifer depth on the performance of a CAESA system using a fully penetrating wellbore. The simulation results demonstrated that larger energy storage scales exhibit better performances of CAESA systems. In addition, deeper target aquifer systems, which could decrease the energy loss by larger storage density and higher temperature in surrounding formation, can obtain better energy efficiencies...|$|E

40|$|The use of in-field {{analysis}} of vapor-phase samples to provide real-time {{volatile organic compound}} (VOC) concentrations in groundwater {{has the potential to}} streamline monitoring by simplifying the sample collection and analysis process. A field validation program was completed to (1) evaluate methods for collection of vapor samples from monitoring wells and (2) evaluate the accuracy and precision of field-portable instruments for the {{analysis of}} vapor-phase samples. The field program evaluated three vapor-phase sample collection methods: (1) headspace samples from two locations within the well, (2) passive vapor diffusion (PVD) samplers placed at the screened interval of the well, and (3) field vapor headspace analysis of groundwater samples. Two types of instruments were tested: a field-portable gas chromatograph (GC) and a photoionization detector (PID). Field GC analysis of PVD samples showed no bias and good correlation to laboratory analysis of groundwater collected by low-flow sampling (slope = 0. 96, R 2 = 0. 85) and laboratory analysis of passive water diffusion bag samples from the <b>well</b> <b>screen</b> (slope = 1. 03; R 2 = 0. 96). Field GC analysis of well headspace samples, either from the upper portion of the well or at the water-vapor interface, resulted in higher variability and much poorer correlation (consistently biased low) relative to laboratory analysis of groundwater samples collected by low-flow sample or passive diffusion bags (PDBs) (slope = 0. 69 to 0. 76; R 2 = 0. 60 to 0. 64). These results indicate that field analysis of vapor-phase samples can be used to obtain accurate measurements of VOC concentrations in groundwater. However, vapor samples collected from the well headspace were not in equilibrium with water collected from the <b>well</b> <b>screen.</b> Instead, PVD samplers placed in the screened interval represent the most promising approach for field-based measurement of groundwater concentrations using vapor monitoring techniques and will be the focus of further field testing...|$|E
