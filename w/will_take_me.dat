500|$|In 1940, Grant {{played a}} callous {{newspaper}} editor who learns that his ex-wife and former journalist, played by Rosalind Russell, is to marry an insurance {{officer in the}} comedy His Girl Friday, which was praised for its strong chemistry and [...] "great verbal athleticism" [...] between Grant and Russell. Grant reunited with Irene Dunne in My Favorite Wife, a [...] "first rate comedy" [...] according to Life magazine, which became RKO's second biggest picture of the year, with profits of $505,000. [...] After playing a Virginian backwoodsman in the American Revolution-set The Howards of Virginia, which McCann considers to have been Grant's worst film and performance, his last film {{of the year was}} in the critically lauded romantic comedy The Philadelphia Story, in which he played the ex-husband of Hepburn's character. Grant felt his performance was so strong that he was bitterly disappointed not to have received an Oscar nomination, and joked [...] "I'd have to blacken my teeth first before the Academy <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> seriously".|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} were diligent {{in ensuring}} the boys' security. O'Mahoney explained: [...] "They were under very strict security rules {{when they were}} filming. They were told not to act as news cameramen. They {{were not allowed to}} film in the street. They could only film at school or at home, in secure environments." [...] Winter added, [...] "they are not paid news cameramen, and that was not the point of the film. Would they normally be running down the street toward a firefight to film it? No. Would they run toward a bombing, knowing {{that there could be a}} secondary explosion or a group of soldiers, who could start, at any second, firing wildly into the crowd, to film a piece of video? No. That's not real life for any Iraqi civilian." [...] Nevertheless, Hayder sometimes filmed outside at night, and explained to the camera that he had to be careful because people are robbed if they are seen carrying even a mobile phone. On New Year's Eve, he and his friend celebrate with a bonfire in his friend's back yard, but after debating whether a noise they hear is fireworks or gunfire, Hayder rushes home. Another boy is driven to school one morning, and reach a special forces roadside checkpoint along the way. He explains, [...] "if they see me with a camera they <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> to prison; they'll think I'm a terrorist who wants to bomb them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bierstadt {{told his}} guide, [...] "I must get {{a study in}} colors; it <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> fifteen minutes!" [...] The weather, however deteriorated, was impressive, and the view in front of Bierstadt {{included}} storm clouds drifting low over [...] "sharp pinnacles and spires and masses of broken granite". Rays of sunlight broke through the cloud, and flowing down a mountain were [...] "ribbons {{of water from the}} last hard shower [...] reflecting back the sunshine." [...] Byers patiently waited for his guest to complete his sketch. When finished, Bierstadt asked, [...] "There, was I more than fifteen minutes?" [...] to which Byers replied, [...] "Yes, you were at work forty-five minutes by the watch!" ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{season began}} with Kaymer's {{appearance}} at the Abu Dhabi HSBC Golf Championship. With scores of 64, 67, and 65, he held to a six-shot lead after three rounds. This extended to a ten-shot lead after five holes in the final round. Kaymer found trouble in the bunkers, resulting in a round of 75 and a fall to third place behind Frenchman Gary Stal, who secured his first European Tour victory, and world number one Rory McIlroy. Speaking after the round, Kaymer told the media that he was [...] "in shock" [...] at the result: [...] "I'm surprised and shocked," [...] the German said. [...] "I don't {{really know how to}} put it into words. It was very, very surprising today. It <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> a few days to reflect on this. I don't think I played that badly. I started well and just hit two drives which led to two bad holes." ...|$|E
