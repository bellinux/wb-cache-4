50|$|There is {{also the}} {{optional}} rule of Critical Successes and Critical Failures. If using a d10, rolling <b>a</b> 10 <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>Critical</b> Success, and allows a second roll.

Further 10's may <b>be</b> rerolled. <b>A</b> roll of 1 <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>critical</b> failure and you subtract 1d10 from your total. When using 3d6; a roll of all sixes, (<b>an</b> 18), <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>Critical</b> Success, and two additional dice can be rolled and added to the result. A roll of three ones, (<b>a</b> 3), <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>Critical</b> Failure, (even if all you only needed to roll <b>was</b> <b>a</b> 3 to succeed the check), and subtract 2d6 from the total. <b>A</b> <b>Critical</b> Failure may represent something more disastrous happening to the character as the Referee sees fit. <b>A</b> <b>Critical</b> Failure on <b>a</b> Lockpicking task, for example, could trigger a silent alarm the character wasn't aware of.|$|R
