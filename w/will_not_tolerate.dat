5|$|Pairs {{separate}} after mating, {{and females}} provide all parenting. The gestation period lasts 93–105 days; females {{give birth to}} up to four cubs, and most commonly to two. The mother <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>tolerate</b> the presence of males {{after the birth of}} cubs, given a risk of infanticide; this behavior is also found in the tiger.|$|E
5|$|Abundant and widespread, A.obovatus {{occurs on}} a wide range of soils, favouring soils in the acidic pH range 3.9–5.4. Like most Adenanthos species it is common on deeply leached {{siliceous}} sandplain sand. It also occurs on gravelly quartz sand derived from rock outcrops, such as on the rocky hillslopes of the Stirling Range. It is rarely found on gravelly lateritic soils. It is also one of the few Adenanthos species to grow well in moist environments; it <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>tolerate</b> seasonal waterlogging—that niche is filled by A.detmoldii—but thrives in damp soils not subject to waterlogging.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the other}} big cats, the jaguar is capable of roaring and does so to warn {{territorial}} and mating competitors away; intensive bouts of counter-calling between individuals have been observed in the wild. Their roar often resembles a repetitive cough, and they may also vocalize mews and grunts. Mating fights between males occur, but are rare, and aggression avoidance behavior has been observed in the wild. When it occurs, conflict is typically over territory: a male's range may encompass that {{of two or three}} females, and he <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>tolerate</b> intrusions by other adult males.|$|E

5|$|The {{temperament}} of the West Highland White Terrier {{can vary}} greatly, with some being friendly towards children, whilst others prefer solitude. It <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>tolerate</b> rough handling {{such as a}} child pulling on its ears, and can be both food- and toy-possessive. It is normally independent, assured, and self-confident, and can make a good watchdog. It is a loyal breed that bonds with its owner, but is often always on the move, requiring good exercise (15–30 min). The Westie is highly social and is the most friendly and jolly of all the Scottish breeds of terriers.|$|E
5|$|The Parson is {{a feisty}} and {{energetic}} type of Terrier. They can excel in dog {{sports such as}} flyball or agility and require vigorous exercise {{in order to prevent}} them from becoming bored and potentially destructive in the home. They can be suited to live with children but as they have a typical Terrier temperament, they <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>tolerate</b> rough handling. The AKC describes them as being single minded, tenacious and courageous when at work, while at home they can be exuberant, playful and affectionate. However, it is unusual for dogs of this breed to be involved in work, such as fox hunting, typical of a small white terrier, as they are more adapted to the show bench.|$|E
5|$|Their {{high energy}} and drive make these dogs {{ideally suited to}} a number of {{different}} dog sports such as flyball or agility. Obedience classes are also recommended to potential owners, as Jack Russells can be stubborn at times and aggressive towards other animals and humans if not properly socialized. Despite their small size, these dogs are not recommended for the condominium or apartment dweller unless the owner is ready to take on the daunting task of providing the dog with the necessary amount of exercise and stimulation. They have a tremendous amount of energy for their size, a fact which can sometimes lead to trouble involving larger animals. They may seem never to tire and will still be energetic after their owner has called it a day. While socialised members of the breed are friendly towards children, they <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>tolerate</b> abuse even if it is unintentional.|$|E

Raping, mobbing, lynching, race riots, and crime will be increased a thousandfold; and upon your garments and the garments {{of those who are}} responsible for the passage of the measure will be the blood of the raped and outraged daughters of Dixie, as well as the blood of the perpetrators of these crimes that the red-blooded Anglo-Saxon White Southern men <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>tolerate.</b>|$|E
25|$|Great Britain, having colonized {{the more}} {{productive}} territories {{to the south}} and to the east (the Thirteen Colonies), having already provided them with a much larger population, <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>tolerate</b> the presence of another European power in that area and will relentlessly attack Canada until such presence is ousted. Given the enormous disproportion in population and material resources between the French and British colonies in North America, the impossibility of modifying that imbalance in the foreseeable future and Britain's generally better control of the maritime routes to Europe, Britain will inevitably prevail sooner or later.|$|E

50|$|Sensitive to Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback, Isopogon trilobus {{requires}} excellent drainage {{and full}} sun. It <b>will</b> likely <b>not</b> <b>tolerate</b> humid climates. Grafting onto eastern {{species such as}} I.anethifolius or I.dawsonii could render it more adaptable to a wider climatic range. Its dense habit and large fruit give it its horticultural potential.|$|R
25|$|Crocodiles are {{the most}} social of reptiles. Even though they do not form social groups, many species congregate in certain {{sections}} of rivers, tolerating each other at times of feeding and basking. Most species are not highly territorial, {{with the exception of}} the saltwater crocodile, which is a highly territorial and aggressive species. A mature male <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>tolerate</b> any other males at any time of the year. Most other species are more flexible. There is a certain form of hierarchy in crocodiles: the largest and heaviest males are at the top, having access to the best basking site, while females are priority during a group feeding of a big kill or carcass. A good example of the hierarchy in crocodiles would be the case of the Nile crocodile. This species clearly displays all of these behaviours. Studies in this area are not thorough, however, and many species are yet to be studied in greater detail. Mugger crocodiles are also known to show toleration in group feedings and tend to congregate in certain areas. However, males of all species are aggressive towards each other during mating season, to gain access to females.|$|E

500|$|Beyond basic [...] "self-esteem" [...] issues, Swift {{used the}} sermon to {{reinforce}} the moral arguments incorporated into the Drapier's Letters with religious doctrine and biblical authority. One image, that of Nineveh and Nimrod, appears in both the sermon and the letters. Nimrod represents Ireland's desire to coin its own currency {{and he is a}} warning to the English that Ireland <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>tolerate</b> England's despotic control. Furthermore, the use of [...] "Nineveh" [...] reinforces Swift's claim that Ireland is under [...] "God's special providence".|$|E

She emphasized teaching horses to have good manners. She roped off of her horses and took them into the mountains.|$|E

The creation and evolution of the universe is observed and recorded, and the Typhon <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>tolerate</b> this telling.

500|$|The Tale of Jemima Puddle-Duck {{is a tale}} of pursuit and prey.

Potter was following the pattern of fairy tales by dwelling on the theme of pursuit and prey, and often pointed out that the tale of Jemima was a retelling of [...] "Little Red Riding Hood". Perrault's tale ends with the death of the heroine, but Potter understood children <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>tolerate</b> tragedy.
