25|$|Say we {{are told}} that a woman has two children. If we ask whether either of them is a girl, and are told yes, what is the {{probability}} that the other child is also a girl? Considering this new child independently, one might expect the probability that the other child is female is ½ (50%). But by building a probability space (illustrating all possible outcomes), we see that the probability is actually only ⅓ (33%). This is because the possibility space illustrates 4 ways of having these two children: boy-boy, girl-boy, boy-girl, and girl-girl. But <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>given</b> more information. Once {{we are told}} that one of the children is a female, we use this new information to eliminate the boy-boy scenario. Thus the probability space reveals that there are still 3 ways to have two children where one is a female: boy-girl, girl-boy, girl-girl. Only ⅓ of these scenarios would have the other child also be a girl. Using a probability space, we are less likely to miss one of the possible scenarios, or to neglect the importance of new information. For further information, see Boy or girl paradox.|$|E
500|$|Aaliyah's funeral {{services}} were held on August 31, 2001, at the Frank E.Campbell Funeral Home and St. Ignatius Loyola Church in Manhattan. Her body {{was set in}} a silver-plated copper-deposit casket, which was carried in a glass horse-drawn hearse. An estimated 800mourners were in attendance at the procession. Among those in attendance at the private ceremony were Missy Elliott, Timbaland, Gladys Knight, Lil' Kim and Sean Combs. After the service, 22 white doves were released to symbolize each year of Aaliyah's life. Aaliyah was initially entombed in a crypt at the Ferncliff Mausoleum in Hartsdale, New York; she was later moved to a private room at the left end of a corridor in the Rosewood Mausoleum. The inscription {{at the bottom of}} Aaliyah's portrait at the funeral read: [...] "We Were Given a Queen, <b>We</b> <b>Were</b> <b>Given</b> an Angel." ...|$|E
500|$|Akihiko Yoshida {{has stated}} that Ashe's {{physical}} features were designed {{with the intent of}} making her look vaguely French, stating that [...] "the base of her bone structure is a French person's. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>given</b> orders from the start to not make her look like an Asian. But we modified her a bit to look more like a Japanese {{for the sake of the}} Japanese audience, and also since a character that looks completely French makes some of the CG expressions difficult." [...] Ashe was voiced by Kari Wahlgren in English and by Mie Sonozaki in Japanese. Despite having been created for Final Fantasy XII, she was first introduced in the 2004 crossover board game Itadaki Street Special. She also appears in Itadaki Street Portable, and was set to appear in Fortress, as revealed in concept art for the game.|$|E

500|$|Collider.com's Chris Cabin also {{praised the}} first seven episodes of the season, giving it four stars, and saying that the series [...] "finds {{overwhelmingly}} sincere and effective traces of humanity in a genre that has been hard-pressed to feel overtly pre-conceived in its political, societal, and philosophical ideas." [...] He said Daredevil, like Jessica Jones, [...] "feels like a show that is constantly evolving, and consistently searching for challenges." [...] Cabin also felt that [...] "the show’s use of sound and image to infer or suggest {{as much as any}} line of dialogue...continues to set this series apart from its half-measured kin." [...] He added that the season [...] "goes to great lengths to make the stakes of" [...] the moral and ethical issues, as seen by pitting Daredevil's methods against the Punisher, [...] "intensely involving and thrilling," [...] while also praising the action sequences of the season and the [...] "streamlined focus on character in the writing", claiming that [...] "none of the [...] films have even an iota of the seductive intimacy and heart of this show." [...] Dennis Perkins writing for The A.V. Club awarded the season a [...] "B+", missing D’Onofrio’s [...] "towering menace as Wilson Fisk", but feeling that Bernthal and Yung [...] "make Castle and Elektra an effective season-long two-pronged assault on Matt Murdock’s heroic identity, which gives Daredevils supporting characters a clearer purpose as well." [...] IGN reviewer Matt Fowler, after reviewing all the episodes of season two individually, gave the season a 9.3 out of 10, saying that it [...] "excelled at both action and story while giving us a more complex and layered season than the first....Gone was a notable 'main villain', but instead <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>given</b> fantastic performances by not only the main cast but by newcomers Jon Bernthal and Elodie Yung." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Brian K. Roberts and {{directed}} by Jim Reardon. Prior to writing the episode, Roberts had been an audio and visual editor on the show. Musician Ringo Starr made a guest appearance in the episode as himself. He was the first Beatle {{to appear on the}} show; both George Harrison and Paul McCartney would later guest star on the show in the season five episode [...] "Homer's Barbershop Quartet" [...] and the season seven episode [...] "Lisa the Vegetarian" [...] respectively. When the story of Marge having a crush on Starr was pitched out, Roberts took the opportunity to write Starr into the script because he had always wanted to meet a Beatle. He then sent the script to Starr, who was then in Southern France. Starr agreed to do the guest appearance after only reading two lines, and he told Roberts that {{he would be able to}} do it when he visited Los Angeles a few weeks later. The staff of the show was thrilled when Roberts revealed that Starr had agreed to do it, and they immediately decided to expand Starr's role in the script. The Simpsons creator Matt Groening said of the guest appearance: [...] "We were so excited that we got Ringo Starr coming in to do the show and we recorded him over at the Complex in West Los Angeles. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>given</b> a list of rules about what we couldn't do to Ringo, such as 'Don't touch him', 'Don't approach him', and 'Don't ask for his autograph'. But of course when he shows up in this big limo, Brian brings out a big poster and asks him to sign it!" [...] Roberts explained that he had not received the memo with the rules so he showed up with a copy of the script cover and asked Starr to sign it. Groening asked Starr if he wanted to be animated the way he was in Yellow Submarine or the way he was in the cartoon series The Beatles. Starr chose Yellow Submarine because he did not like his appearance in the cartoon. In addition to Starr, the episode features a guest appearance by Jon Lovitz as Lombardo and the doughnut delivery man that delivers doughnuts to the nuclear power plant. Lombardo's physical appearance was based on an art teacher Reardon had in art school.|$|E
500|$|On July 11, 1886, {{a meeting}} {{was held at}} the home of P.N. Clausen at which the Danebod {{congregation}} was formally organized with fifteen members. The church council consisted of its president, P.N. Clausen, secretary M.Lauritsen, and treasurer Jørgen Jacobsen. At first there were no regular church services and no resident pastor. Instead, the people met in various homes to sing Danish hymns and listen to a reading of the sermon by a layman. The pastor of Sleepy Eye, Minnesota, S.C. Madsen, and other ministers occasionally conducted services in town. The congregation later hired the Danish settler, pastor Hans Jørgen Pedersen (1851–1905) of Gowen, Michigan. He arrived with his family on April12, 1888. Pedersen had a humble upbringing in Denmark, where he later studied at Ryslinge Folk High School before emigrating to America in 1875. He was an eloquent preacher, resourceful, and became involved in community activities throughout the area. He quickly assumed leadership and thus, in a sense, became the founder of Danebod. One of the pastor's six children, Sigurd Pedersen, described their first arrival in Danebod in his autobiography: [...] "It was a chilly morning, when the committee stood on the platform to bid welcome to the new pastor and his wife, trailed by six children, and the rear held up by the trusty hired man, Søren Olsen, who was to keep count of the straying flock and see that the last luggage was not forgotten. Friends invited us over for breakfast in the home of H.J. Nelsen, the merchant. Then the committee guided us to a small house on the corner just west of the present-day Chevrolet dealer, where businessman Carl Cold Sorensen brought the first automobiles to the area in the early 1900's. The committee had left no kindling in this small house, but Søren Olsen soon discovered that the kitchen range was in place and claimed to be able to manipulate the same if kindling could be provided. Across the street was a large general store, and father sent us there to beg Mr.Lauritsen for some kindling. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>given</b> old boxes to break up, and we soon had our arms full and Søren had a blazing fire in a few minutes." [...] In September 1888, it was decided at a convention in Elk Horn, Iowa, to give the congregation at Danebod [...] of land, and the Danebod Lutheran Church was dedicated on Sunday, June16, 1895. Pedersen died in 1905, and the Reverend Thorvald Knudsen succeeded him at Danebod.|$|E
