25|$|The Adapter was {{developed}} by Mad Catz by experimenting with all legacy Xbox 360 controllers they wanted to support and verifying what inputs they sent via wireless connection. They also worked with a former Microsoft employee that had experience with the Xbox 360's wireless features for additional insight. Existing USB microphones remain compatible with Rock Band 4. Harmonix was also <b>working</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> backward compatibility for the Stage Kit, an add-on hardware unit for Xbox 360 owners that allowed for a smoke machine and light show display {{in time with the}} song. Owing to the game's focus on core gameplay, and concerns that consumers may be unwilling to buy additional hardware for specific games early in a console generation's lifecycle, Rock Band 4 did not feature additional accessories. At retail, the game is available in a band bundle, with a guitar, drum, and microphone, and a guitar-only bundle.|$|E
25|$|Potts mustered out of {{the army}} in January 1866 and {{returned}} to Carroll County, Ohio, where he resumed his legal and political careers. He changed political parties and joined the Republicans. A moderate, {{he was elected to}} the Ohio State Senate in 1867. Three years later, he accepted an appointment from a fellow Ohio politician and former general, President Ulysses S. Grant, as the governor of the Montana Territory, but only after first refusing it because the adoption of the Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in the Ohio Legislature depended upon his vote, which would be lost if he vacated his seat. Potts served until 1883. As governor, he was heavily involved in Indian affairs, as well as <b>working</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> several new frontier towns chartered, including Missoula. The bipartisan political stability Potts brought to Montana played an important role in the gradual lessening of vigilante activities and lawlessness in the territory. He later served in the territorial legislature.|$|E

500|$|The 1937 season {{started off}} poorly for Hershberger. While he {{remained}} with the Newark Bears, the Yankees released {{him from his}} contract, and {{partly due to the}} success of catcher Bill Dickey, the Yankees no longer had an interest in Hershberger. He spent the full season with the Bears, splitting time with Buddy Rosar at catcher. The team ended up with a 109–43 record and the International League title; the Bears have been called the third greatest minor league team in history by Minor League Baseball. Hershberger hit 15 doubles and had a [...]325 average in 96 games, and hit [...]364 in the Junior Series against the Columbus Red Birds. As a result, Yankees owner Jacob Ruppert noted that he would spend the offseason <b>working</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the players on major league rosters. On December 3, 1937, Hershberger was traded to the Cincinnati Reds for shortstop Eddie Miller and $40,000, ending his tenure in the Yankees organization.|$|E

ESPN included Butler's 2012 recruiting class among its top recruiting classes from teams in non-BCS conferences, noting Dunham was listed as an ESPN Top 100 recruit and is [...] "a sniper to run off screens and create movement in the halfcourt sets {{for the next four}} years." [...] In ESPN's scouting report, Dunham was listed as the 78th best overall player, {{due in large part to}} the fact that what he [...] "does really well is shoot the basketball.

500|$|Many Anti-Masons {{were opposed}} to the presidential {{candidacy}} of General Andrew Jackson, a Mason, and Fillmore was a delegate to a New York convention that endorsed President John Quincy Adams for re-election, as well as serving at two Anti-Masonic conventions {{in the summer of}} 1828. At the conventions, Fillmore and one of the early political bosses, newspaper editor Thurlow Weed, met and impressed each other. By then, Fillmore was the leading citizen in East Aurora, and successfully sought election to the New York State Assembly, serving in Albany for three one-year terms, 1829 to 1831. Fillmore's 1828 election was in contrast to the victories of the Jacksonian Democrats (soon the Democrats), who swept the general to the White House and their party to a majority in Albany, thus Fillmore was in the minority in the Assembly. [...] He proved effective anyway, <b>working</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the legislature to allow court witnesses the option of affirming to tell the truth rather than taking a religious oath, and in 1830 gaining the abolishment of imprisonment for debt. [...] By then, much of Fillmore's legal practice was in Buffalo and later that year he moved there with his family; he did not seek re-election in 1831.|$|E
500|$|Xbox {{division}} head Phil Spencer {{had also}} hinted {{the possibility of}} adding support for games from the original Xbox. For the backwards compatibility team, after they completed the framework for Xbox 360 compatibility so that other engineering teams could take over, they turned {{to the question of}} compatibility with the original Xbox console. The program was started in November 2016, under the code name [...] "Fusion", and was led by software engineer Spencer Perreault. Perreault initially tried the same approaches as the team had done with [...] "Fission", but due to the differences in memory management sizes and chipset bit-rates, these initial tests failed. Instead, Perreault worked to bring [...] "Dolphin", a developer tool for the original Xbox, <b>working</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> its emulation correct. La Chapelle brought in a number of personal Xbox titles to test in Perreault's emulation, getting about a 10% [...] "hit rate" [...] on successes, though the variety of failures helped Perreault to identify common problems, and within a month, had improved the successful hit rate to about 90%. As with Xbox 360 backwards compatibility, the Fusion emulation enables Xbox games to be scaled to 1080p resolutions, work with Xbox One networking features, and can allow mixed-console System Link connection between all three generations of Xbox.|$|E

500|$|Although the Eastern small-footed bat {{is listed}} as a species of least concern on the IUCN red list, many states in which the bat resides have begun listing it has a {{threatened}} species and have begun conservation efforts {{in order to improve}} its numbers. This species is not protected by federal law, but was a former C2 candidate for listing prior to the abolishment of that category by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife service in 1996. Some states (e.g. Pennsylvania) have given the species legal protection while others have recognized its apparently low numbers and consider the eastern small-footed Myotis a species of concern. In the report Species of Special Concern in Pennsylvania by Genoways and Brenner (1985), the Pennsylvania Biological Survey assigned Myotis leibii the status of [...] "threatened". Other states, such as Virginia, are currently <b>working</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the Eastern small-footed Myotis legal protection. Despite these efforts not many conservation projects have been put in place to help the species. Due to their strange hibernation patterns, and the lack of information regarding their spring and summer roosting locations proper conservation efforts are very difficult. The bats will not usually use bat boxes like many other bat species, due to their tendency to nest alone or in very small groups, so this is not an appropriate action to assist in habitat disturbance issues with this species.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Jack, {{who serves}} as Vice President of East Coast Television and Microwave Oven Programming for General Electric (GE), travels to Washington, D.C., to {{participate}} in a task force on microwaves as the industry is struggling, but he says he refuses to take any bailout money. He believes the meeting will be quite simple and quick, but once there he is confronted by Devon Banks (Will Arnett) who has begun working with the federal government.

Jack spends that time asking the TGS with Tracy Jordan staff writers—Frank, Lutz, and James [...] "Toofer" [...] Spurlock (Keith Powell)—to come up with an idea [...] "as good as the light bulb" [...] to improve the microwave. They try to incorporate suggestions such as making the microwave bigger or making them break down more often so they require replacement, but Jack eventually abandons the project as a failure. However, instead of leaving GE, Jack convinces Devon to give the company bailout money (which he had previously refused), effectively making Devon Jack's boss.|$|E
500|$|Beginning {{with the}} periodical's 30th issue in 1979, Greenwood {{published}} {{a series of}} short articles that detailed the setting in The Dragon magazine, {{the first of which}} was about a monster known as the curst. Greenwood wrote voluminous entries to Dragon magazine, using the Realms as a setting for his descriptions of magic items, monsters, and spells. In 1986, the American game publishing company TSR began looking for a new campaign setting for the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons game, and assigned Jeff Grubb {{to find out more about}} the setting used by Greenwood as portrayed in his articles in Dragon. According to Greenwood, Grubb asked him [...] "Do you just make this stuff up as you go, or do you really have a huge campaign world?"; Greenwood answered [...] "yes" [...] to both questions. TSR felt that the Forgotten Realms would be a more open-ended setting than the epic Dragonlance setting, and chose the Realms as a ready-made campaign setting upon deciding to publish AD 2nd Edition. Greenwood agreed to work on the project, and began <b>working</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the Forgotten Realms officially published. Greenwood sent TSR a few dozen cardboard boxes stuffed with pencil notes and maps, and sold all rights to the Realms for a token fee. Greenwood noted that TSR altered his original conception of the Realms being a place that we could travel to from our world, [...] "Concerns over possible lawsuits (kids getting hurt while trying to 'find a gate') led TSR to de-emphasize this meaning".|$|E
