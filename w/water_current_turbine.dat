50|$|There {{are several}} types of open-ﬂow devices {{that can be used}} in marine-current-power applications; many of them are modern {{descendants}} of the waterwheel or similar. However, the more technically sophisticated designs, derived from wind-power rotors, are the most likely to achieve enough cost-effectiveness and reliability to be practical in a massive marine-current-power future scenario. Even though there is no generally accepted term for these open-ﬂow hydro-turbines, some sources refer to them as water-current turbines. There are two main types of <b>water</b> <b>current</b> <b>turbines</b> that might be considered: axial-ﬂow horizontal-axis propellers (with both variable-pitch or ﬁxed-pitch), and cross-ﬂow vertical-axis Darrieus rotors. Both rotor types may be combined with any of the three main methods for supporting water-current turbines:ﬂoating moored systems, sea-bed mounted systems, and intermediate systems. Sea-bed-mounted monopile structures constitute the ﬁrst-generation marine current power systems. They have the advantage of using existing (and reliable) engineering know-how, but they are limited to relatively shallow waters (about 20 to 40 m depth).|$|R

Recent developments in <b>current</b> <b>turbine</b> design are reviewed and some potential advantages of ducted or “diffuser-augmented ” <b>current</b> <b>turbines</b> are explored. These include improved safety, protection from weed growth, increased power output and reduced turbine and gearbox size for a given power output. Ducted turbines {{are not subject to}} the so-called Betz limit, which defines an upper limit of 59. 3 % of the incident kinetic energy that can be converted to shaft power by a single actuator disk turbine in open flow. For ducted turbines the theoretical limit depends on (i) the pressure difference that can be created between duct inlet and outlet, and (ii) the volumetric flow through the duct. These factors in turn depend on the shape of the duct and the ratio of duct area to turbine area. Previous investigations by others have found a theoretical limit for a diffuser-augmented wind turbine of about 3. 3 times the Betz limit, and a model diffuser-augmented wind turbine has extracted 4. 25 times the power extracted by the same turbine without a diffuser. In the present study, similar principles applied to a water turbine have so far achieved an augmentation factor of 1. 7 at an early stage of the investigation...|$|R

40|$|Paradoxically, {{sea surface}} area for {{offshore}} wind farms {{is limited in}} some countries like Japan. While {{the distance from the}} shore to a wind farm is limited due to the cost of electric transmission, the near shore area has considerable traffic of ships and is restricted by complex rights of local fisheries. One approach to the problem is inviting the local fishermen to the management of the wind farm. It requires higher economic performance of the wind farm than the original fishing activity in the same sea surface area. The proposed concept is the combination of a floating wind turbine and counter-rotating <b>water</b> <b>current</b> <b>turbine.</b> The <b>water</b> <b>current</b> <b>turbine</b> partially cancels the reaction torque of electric generator and provides additional energy production from water current.
