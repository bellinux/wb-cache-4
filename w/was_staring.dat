Chin in hand, she <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> fixedly at the dancing flames, and did not turn her head when Laurent entered the room. Wearing a lace-edged {{petticoat}} and bed-jacket, she looked particularly pale in the bright firelight. Her jacket had slipped from one shoulder which showed pink through the locks of her black hair.|$|E
25|$|With {{the tournament}} {{moving back to}} Dubai, United {{registered}} a thrilling win against Quetta Gladiators. After putting up a total of 166, the team <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> at almost certain defeat after the Gladiators were 148 {{for the loss of}} just one wicket at the 16th over. However, after a flurry of wickets and the inability of the opposition batsmen to finish the game, United prevailed by 1 run. This win also ensured the team of a play-off spot.|$|E

25|$|In 1950, Anger {{moved to}} Paris, France, where he {{initially}} stayed with {{friends of his}} (who themselves {{had been forced to}} leave Hollywood after being blacklisted for formerly having belonged to trade union organisations). He would later remark that he travelled to the country after receiving a letter from the French director Jean Cocteau in which he told Anger of his admiration for Fireworks (shown in 1949 at Festival du Film Maudit in Biarritz, France). Upon arrival, Anger and Cocteau became friends, with the Frenchman giving the young protege his permission to make a movie of his ballet The Young Man and Death, although at the time there were no financial backers for the project. While in Paris he continued producing short films; in 1950 he started filming on Rabbit's Moon, which was also known as La Lune des Lapins and revolved around a clown who <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> up at the moon, in which a rabbit lived, something found within Japanese mythology. Anger produced 20 minutes of footage at the Films du Pantheon Studio in the city before he was rushed out of the studio, leaving the film uncompleted. He stored the footage in the disorganized archives of the Cinémathèque Française, and only collected it again in 1970, when he finally finished and released Rabbit's Moon. It was at the Cinémathèque Française that he was given by the head, Henri Langlois, prints of Sergei Eisenstein's Que Viva Mexico!, which he attempted to put into Eisenstein's original order.|$|E

A passenger reported that Abdulmutallab, though burned [...] "quite severely" [...] on his leg, seemed [...] "very calm," [...] and like a [...] "normal individual." [...] Schuringa stripped off the suspect's clothes to look for additional weapons, and he and a crew member restrained Abdulmutallab with plastic handcuffs. [...] "He <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> into nothing" [...] and shaking, said Schuringa.|$|E
500|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the Test, Kippax travelled to Melbourne where he led NSW in a Sheffield Shield match beginning on 22 December. At stumps on the second day, NSW <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> at defeat as they were seven for 58 in pursuit of Victoria’s first innings of 376. When play resumed on Christmas Day, NSW slipped to nine for 113, with Kippax 20 not out. [...] However, the number eleven batsman Hal Hooker stuck with his captain as the score gradually mounted and the opposition’s frustrations grew.|$|E

500|$|Music writers Covach and Boone {{describe}} the riff as blues-derived, {{which uses a}} minor blues pentatonic scale with an added flattened fifth note (or common blues scale). [...] The song follows a blues chord progression (I–IV–I) during the first eight bars. [...] Brown {{had a difficult time}} writing lyrics that fit the riff. [...] After an all-night session, Bruce played it on a standup bass while lyricist Pete Brown <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> out the window. [...] Slowly, he started to write [...] "It's getting near dawn and lights close their tired eyes", which is used in the first verse. [...] Later, to break up the rhythm, Clapton wrote a refrain which also yielded the song's title. [...] It consists of eight-bar sections using three chords, when the key shifts to the V chord (I = V): ...|$|E

2500|$|Her friend's {{attitude}} immediately {{takes on}} a more threatening quality as a sudden lunar eclipse happens above them but before he can do anything he is confronted by Timbaland and SoShy's characters. [...] He tells them that this time he's brought a couple of friends, and the vampire and the cat man appear to back him up only for {{the three of them}} to be frightened away by much larger crowd that Timbaland summons. [...] The woman caught between the two sides looks down to see that her circular birthmark is glowing and looks like the eclipse, and the necklace worn by the vampire who <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> at her in the club. [...] She quickly wakes up from the dream, only to see that the television is playing what it was {{at the start of the}} dream and the phone is ringing with her mother on the other end as the black cat comes in through the window.|$|E
2500|$|The Rabbis {{taught in}} a Baraita that once Rabbi Joshua ben Hananiah was {{standing}} on a step on the Temple Mount, and Ben Zoma (who was younger than Rabbi Joshua) saw him but did not stand up before him in respect. So Rabbi Joshua asked Ben Zoma what was up. Ben Zoma replied that he <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> at {{the space between the}} upper and the lower waters (described in [...] ). Ben Zoma said that there is only a bare three fingers' space between the upper and the lower waters. Ben Zoma reasoned that [...] says, [...] "And the spirit of God hovered over the face of the waters," [...] implying a distance similar to that of a mother dove that hovers over her young without touching them. But Rabbi Joshua told his disciples that Ben Zoma was still outside the realm of understanding. Rabbi Joshua noted that [...] says that [...] "the spirit of God hovered over the face of the water" [...] {{on the first day of}} Creation, but God divided the waters on the second day, as [...] reports. (And thus the distance that God hovered above the waters need not be the distance between the upper and lower waters). The Gemara presented various views of how great the distance is between the upper and the lower waters. Rav Aha bar Jacob said that the distance was a hair's breadth. The Rabbis said that the distance was like that between the planks of a bridge. Mar Zutra (or some say Rav Assi) said that the distance was like that between two cloaks spread one over another. And others said that the distance was like that between two cups nested one inside the other..|$|E
