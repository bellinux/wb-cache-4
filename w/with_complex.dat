40|$|Delayed {{hypersensitivity}} (DH) in {{the mouse}} was studied <b>with</b> <b>complexes</b> of dinitrophenyl (DHP) as hapten and bovine serum albumin (BSA), mouse immunoglobulin (MIg) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as carrier. Priming with BSA induced strong DH against this carrier, but DN of decreasing strength against <b>complexes</b> <b>with</b> increasing DNP:carrier ratio. Priming <b>with</b> DNP-BSA <b>complexes</b> never {{resulted in a}} DH against BSA or DNP 3 -minusBSA. Injections of DNP 16 -minusBSA and DNP 28 -minusBSA induced positive DH which increased with the hapten:carrier ratio of the eliciting antigen. The <b>complexes</b> <b>with</b> an isologous carrier DNP 48 -minusMIg or DNP 90 -minusMIg induced positive reactions against both complexes but not against the weakly substituted DNP 11 -minusMIg. The latter only primed for itself. The importance of the DNP groups as determinant in these DH reactions is stressed by the cross-reactions between DNP-BSA and DNP-MIg complexes and by the induction by DNP 16 -minusPVP of positive DH against DNP 28 -minusBSA. Cyclophosphamide (Cy) treatment before priming <b>with</b> <b>complexes</b> induced enhanced DH against <b>complexes</b> <b>with</b> sufficient hapten:carrier ratio. Priming with carrier under Cy treatment induced no DH against complexes. All {{these results indicate that}} carrier determinants are not involved in the DH against complexes. After priming wtih <b>complexes</b> <b>with</b> a low hapten:carrier ratio the DH is directed against new antigenic determinants (NAD) groups. After priming <b>with</b> <b>complexes</b> <b>with</b> high ratios DH is directed against DNP groups. With adoptive local transfer of spleen cells of primed animals and pretreatment of these cells with anti-thymocyte serum or anti-plasma cell serum and complement it was possible to demonstrate that the T cell was responsible for the DH reactions. The involvement of different determinant groups on the hapten-carrier complexes in immune reactions is discussed...|$|R

5|$|An {{important}} {{generalization of}} the derivative concerns complex functions of complex variables, such as functions from (a domain in) the complex numbers C to C.

If C is identified with R2 by writing a complex number z as , then a differentiable function from C to C is certainly differentiable as a function from R2 to R2 (in the sense that its partial derivatives all exist), but the converse is not true in general: the complex derivative only exists if the real derivative is complex linear and this imposes relations between the partial derivatives called the Cauchy–Riemann equations – see holomorphic functions.|$|E
40|$|It was {{possible}} to terminate the induced unresponsive state to bovine serum albumin (BSA) and the natural unresponsive state to autologous thyroglobulin in rabbits (RTg) by immunization <b>with</b> <b>complexes</b> composed of heterologous cross-reacting antibody and the tolerated antigens. The unresponsive state was terminated in rabbits made unresponsive by neonatal injections of BSA and then 3 mo later injected <b>with</b> <b>complexes</b> composed of BSA and guinea pig antihuman serum albumin.

Similarly, the natural unresponsive state was terminated in adult rabbits injected <b>with</b> <b>complexes</b> between RTg and guinea pig antibovine thyroglobulin (BTg) in that thyroid lesions and circulating anti-RTg were produced. The results can be best explained by the presence of unresponsive T cells and competent B cells, where the guinea pig gamma globulin (antibody) activates T cells specific for the guinea pig gamma globulin portion of the complexes and thus permits stimulation of B cells competent to the exposed determinants of the tolerated (BSA or RTg) portion of the complexes. The detailed mechanism for the activation of B cells in tolerant animals is discussed...|$|R

5|$|Dragonflies are {{affected}} by three major groups of parasites: water mites, gregarine protozoa, and trematode flatworms (flukes). Water mites, Hydracarina, can kill smaller dragonfly larvae, and may also be seen on adults. Gregarines infect the gut and may cause blockage and secondary infection. Trematodes are parasites of vertebrates such as frogs, <b>with</b> <b>complex</b> life cycles often involving a period as a stage called a cercaria in a secondary host, a snail. Dragonfly nymphs may swallow cercariae, or these may tunnel through a nymph's body wall; they then enter the gut and form a cyst or metacercaria, which remains in the nymph {{for the whole of}} its development. If the nymph is eaten by a frog, the amphibian becomes infected by the adult or fluke stage of the trematode.|$|E

Hood's instruments also illustrated, for pedagogical purposes, the supposed relationships between {{the signs of the}} zodiac, the planets, and the parts of the human body adherents believed were governed by the planets and signs.

5|$|Mention {{should also}} be made of Meyerbeer's intense concern with the {{business}} of opera, which indeed had formed part of his studies under Vogler. This gave him the background not only to deal <b>with</b> <b>complex</b> contractual issues and to negotiate with publishers, but extended to wooing the press and 'marketing' in general. Indeed, he was probably the originator of the 'press conference' at which journalists were fed refreshment and information. This marketing and commercialisation of opera was reinforced by Meyerbeer's Paris publisher Maurice Schlesinger who had established his fortune on the back of Robert, and even persuaded Honoré de Balzac to write a novella (Gambara) to promote Les Huguenots. Schlesinger's publication of Franz Liszt's Reminiscences de Robert le diable sold out on the day of issue and was immediately reprinted. Such manoeuvres did little to endear Meyerbeer to his fellow artists, and indeed engendered envious comments of the sort already quoted from Berlioz and Chopin.|$|E
