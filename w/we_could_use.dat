A camera rig would then obtain key frames of the choreographed actor.

Though Fagen imagined they might [...] "stick it out for a while," [...] he admitted to Robert Palmer of The New York Times, in an article published on June 17, 1981, that the group had indeed separated. [...] "Basically, we decided after writing and playing together for 14 years, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>use</b> a change mondaire as the French say," [...] he told Palmer. After their split, Fagen worked on a song for the soundtrack of the film Heavy Metal, which got him back in the studio. He began working towards a solo album shortly thereafter. [...] "Working on it has been interesting. The fact that it's not a Steely Dan album has freed me from a certain image, a preconceived idea of how it'll sound," [...] he said at the time. Fagen had hoped to record music on his own [...] "a year or so" [...] prior to the duo's breakup. The album was originally slated to be titled Talk Radio.|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} {{originally}} {{supposed to have}} been shot on film, though a last-minute change by the studio helped introduce a different technology. In 1997, during pre-production on Henry Selick's feature, Monkeybone, the film's cinematographer Pete Kozachik was looking for a type of filming that would streamline the process of integrating stop-motion characters with pre-filmed live actors. After finishing Monkeybone, Kozachik continued to test cameras for a practical means of shooting feature animation digitally. In early 2003, the production unit was not interested in digital capture for stop motion; the team was instead prepping the movie for a film shoot. Two weeks before filming was to begin, Kozachik and visual effects consultant Chris Watts came up with a solution using digital still cameras that was deemed viable by Warner Bros. senior vice president of physical production and visual effects Chris DeFaria. The production then became digital. After testing a dozen different models, Kozachik opted for a basic digital still camera, the Canon EOS-1D Mark II, an off-the-shelf model that was outfitted with adapters to allow the use of Nikon prime lenses (14mm-105mm). Kozachik spoke about why he chose the camera, saying: [...] "One reason I went with this particular camera is that its image chip is just about the same size as Super 35 film negative, so <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>use</b> Nikon lenses and treat them like regular 35mm cine lenses and get the same effect—the same depth of field and angle of coverage. I knew {{that we were going to}} be fighting to make this look like a 'real' movie because we weren't shooting on film, so I wanted to at least have the optics look like movie optics." ...|$|E
