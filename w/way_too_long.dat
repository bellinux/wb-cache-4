500|$|The {{airing of}} the series had been stalled for a year, perhaps due to {{difficulties}} within the CBC. To get CBC to adopt the series, Peyton showed the company a commercial with the CBC logo in blood, remarking that [...] "It's been <b>way</b> <b>too</b> <b>long</b> that you've waited to have your logo covered in blood." [...] He had also said that What It's Like Being Alone was meant to attract university {{and high school students}} as an audience, and he felt that these people did not ordinarily watch the CBC. [...] CBC itself was looking for original material, and was enthusiastic about the series because it seemed to stand out among Canadian television productions. [...] Peyton's co-producer was Fred Fuchs, who later rose in the CBC staff; one critic believed Fuchs' promotion to be a reason why CBC adopted the series.|$|E

It was also Berk's favorite; he commented, [...] "I still melt at Artie's serenade", and gave it four stars out of five. Gonzalez and Benigno both gave it an [...] "A", and the latter explained: [...] "the {{arrangement}} ... gives the track a wonderful, spontaneous feel", and [...] "this nerdy white boy has himself some soul." [...] Kubicek dissented, and explained that Artie getting emotional in song two weeks in a row [...] "is a tad boring". While most reviewers disliked [...] "Friday" [...] in the original, Rebecca Black version, the commentary for the prom incarnation sung by Puck, Sam and Artie was generally positive despite this—Gonzalez said she hated herself [...] "for giving this horrendously addictive version of a horrendous song a B." [...] VanDerWerff said the song was [...] "way, way, <b>way</b> <b>too</b> <b>long,</b> though it was more fun than [...] expected it to be", Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal called it [...] "darn good and infectious", and Mullins said it was [...] "much catchier than the original".

500|$|According to Joseph, [...] "Freakum Dress" [...] is thematically {{similar to}} [...] "Bills, Bills, Bills" [...] (1999) and [...] "Say My Name" [...] (2000), from the Destiny's Child era. Ann Powers of Los Angeles Times noted that [...] "Freakum Dress" [...] celebrates showing off. Jon Pareles of The New York Times viewed {{the concept of}} the song as not merely having a nice {{wardrobe}} to entice men, but it also serves as [...] "a means of self-assertion." [...] In the song, the female protagonist pulls out her best dress to remind her potentially wandering mate of what he is leaving at home. Jody Rosen of Entertainment Weekly added that Beyoncé also seemingly gives professional advice to women on how to hold a man's attention in a long-term relationship. She sings: [...] "I think I'm ready/ Been locked up in the house <b>way</b> <b>too</b> <b>long</b> / It's time to get it, cause once again he's out doing wrong [...] Wear very skimpy clothes...". Joseph commented that in the song, Beyoncé is capable of wearing anything to keep her man by her side rather than dumping him. Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe added that after having skirted her best dress, Beyoncé eyes other guys in dance clubs to make her own man jealous, in the hope of regaining his attention but she also makes sure that he really pays when he does her wrong. Beyoncé later refers to her [...] "freakum dress" [...] in [...] "Jealous", a track from her fifth studio album Beyoncé (2013).|$|E
