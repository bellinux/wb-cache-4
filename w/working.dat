5|$|A {{graduate}} of Harvard University, Birch began <b>working</b> on geophysics {{as a research}} assistant. He subsequently spent his entire career at Harvard <b>working</b> in the field, becoming an Associate Professor of Geology in 1943, a professor in 1946, and Sturgis Hooper Professor of Geology in 1949, and professor emeritus in 1974.|$|E

5|$|A {{study by}} Sanchez and Wiley showed that seductive details caused poor {{learning}} outcomes because they take {{up some of}} the limited space in <b>working</b> memory. The experiment compared people's ability to control their attention to scientific text that contained either seductive images, relevant images, or no images. The study showed that people with low <b>working</b> memory capacity were especially vulnerable to the seductive details effect. Sanchez and Wiley also did an experiment where eye-tracking was monitored to evaluate how people were reading the same seductively illustrated scientific text. The results showed that people with low <b>working</b> memory looked at the seductive illustrations more often and for longer than those with high <b>working</b> memory capacity. It could be argued that differences in performance between high- and low- <b>working</b> memory capacity individuals is really due to general reading ability, an attribute that has been correlated with <b>working</b> memory capacity in other studies.|$|E

5|$|After a Ministry of Supply {{security}} officer <b>working</b> at {{the project is}} shot dead, M assigns Bond to replace him and also to investigate what {{has been going on}} at the missile-building base, located between Dover and Deal on the south coast of England. All the rocket scientists <b>working</b> on the project are German. At his post on the complex, Bond meets Gala Brand, a beautiful police Special Branch officer <b>working</b> undercover as Drax's personal assistant. Bond also uncovers clues concerning his predecessor's death, concluding that the man may have been killed for witnessing a submarine off the coast.|$|E
5|$|Bob Muglia {{was born}} in 1959 in Connecticut. His father was an {{automotive}} parts salesman. Muglia started <b>working</b> at his first job when he was 15 years old. He moved to Michigan and earned an undergraduate degree from the University of Michigan in 1981. After graduating, he started <b>working</b> for ROLM Corporation.|$|E
5|$|Childhood and {{adolescence}} allows {{the development of}} an internal <b>working</b> model useful for forming attachments. This internal <b>working</b> model is related to the individual's state of mind which develops with respect to attachment generally and explores how attachment functions in relationship dynamics based on childhood and adolescent experience. The organization of an internal <b>working</b> model is generally seen as leading to more stable attachments in those who develop such a model, rather than those who rely more on the individual's state of mind alone in forming new attachments.|$|E
5|$|Cylinder <b>working</b> {{pressure}} is specified at a reference temperature, usually 15°C or 20°C. and cylinders {{also have a}} specified maximum safe <b>working</b> temperature, often 65°C. The actual pressure in the cylinder will vary with temperature, as described by the gas laws, but this is acceptable {{in terms of the}} standards provided that the developed pressure when corrected to the reference temperature does not exceed the specified <b>working</b> pressure stamped on the cylinder. This allows cylinders to be safely and legally filled to a pressure that is higher than the specified <b>working</b> pressure when the filling temperature is greater than the reference temperature, but not more than 65°C, provided that the filling pressure does not exceed the developed pressure for that temperature, and cylinders filled according to this provision will be at the correct <b>working</b> pressure when cooled to the reference temperature.|$|E

5|$|Elephants {{have been}} <b>working</b> animals {{since at least}} the Indus Valley Civilization and {{continue}} to be used in modern times. There were 13,000–16,500 <b>working</b> elephants employed in Asia in 2000. These animals are typically captured from the wild when they are 10–20 years old when they can be trained quickly and easily, and will have a longer <b>working</b> life. They were traditionally captured with traps and lassos, but since 1950, tranquillisers have been used.|$|E
5|$|Erin Ryan went to University of California's Hastings School of Law, {{afterward}} <b>working</b> until 1992 as {{an intelligence}} {{analyst for the}} Central Intelligence Agency. She next worked in New York as a pastry chef for eight years. In 2000 Erin Ryan joined California Senator Jackie Speier in politics, <b>working</b> as her aide.|$|E
5|$|Heavyweight boxing {{champion}} Evander Holyfield guest {{starred in}} the episode as himself, appearing at the mall to help train Phineas for the big thumb wrestling match against Buford. Holyfield's guest performance was heavily expected since the original announcement of guest stars lined up for the series released in September 2007. Cast members response to <b>working</b> with Holyfield was highly positive; Vincent Martella and Alyson Stoner, who portray Phineas and Isabella respectively, cited <b>working</b> along guest stars like him as a benefit of <b>working</b> on the show.|$|E
5|$|In 1915, Yard {{was invited}} to Washington, D.C. by his friend Stephen Mather, who had started <b>working</b> on {{national}} parks as assistant to the Secretary of Interior. Yard and Mather had met while <b>working</b> for the New York Sun and became friends; Yard was the best man at Mather's wedding in 1893.|$|E
5|$|In 1931, 18.7% of Stretford's {{population}} was {{middle class and}} 19.7% <b>working</b> class compared to 14% middle class and 36% <b>working</b> class nationally. The rest of the {{population was}} made up of clerical workers and skilled manual workers. By 1971, the middle class in Stretford had declined steadily to 14.9% whilst the <b>working</b> class had grown to 31.3% compared to 24% middle class and 26% <b>working</b> class nationally.|$|E
5|$|In 1962 Moore {{created an}} edition of 10 <b>working</b> models (LH 504) {{for a new}} two-piece sculpture. The Tate Gallery in London {{acquired}} a small <b>working</b> model in 1963. Other <b>working</b> models are in the collections of the Gemeentemuseum in The Hague, the Didrichsen Art Museum in Helsinki, the Memorial Art Gallery of the University of Rochester in Rochester, New York, and the Kunsthaus in Zurich. Moore planned the full-size sculpture to be over 10 feet high, large enough {{for a person to}} walk between the two elements.|$|E

5|$|Public {{condemnation}} {{of the use of}} breaker boys was so widespread that in 1885 Pennsylvania enacted a law forbidding the employment of anyone under the age of 12 from <b>working</b> in a coal breaker, but the law was poorly enforced; many employers forged proof-of-age documentation, and many families forged birth certificates or other documents so their children could support the family. Estimates of the number of breaker boys at work in the anthracite coal fields of Pennsylvania vary widely, and official statistics are generally considered by historians to undercount the numbers significantly. One estimate had 20,000 breaker boys <b>working</b> in the state in 1880, 18,000 <b>working</b> in 1900, 13,133 <b>working</b> in 1902, and 24,000 <b>working</b> in 1907. Technological innovations in the 1890s and 1900s (such as mechanical and water separators designed to remove impurities from coal) dramatically lowered the need for breaker boys, but adoption of the new technology was slow.|$|E

5|$|She {{had been}} <b>working</b> {{as a prostitute}} to finance her drug addiction, which had already led to loss of her job with an {{insurance}} firm. Her partner {{was at the time}} also a heroin user, and knew she was <b>working</b> as a prostitute, although her family did not.|$|E
5|$|Smallpeice would, whilst <b>working</b> at Doulton's, involve himself {{further in}} the ICAEW, {{promoting}} rule changes which would allow chartered accountants <b>working</b> in industry {{to sit on the}} ICAEW council, and being eligible to be Fellows of the Institute. This would lead to him serving on the ICAEW council from 1948 to 1957.|$|E
5|$|Spring Brook {{has been}} studied several times. It was studied by the United States Geological Survey from 1971 to 1975, by Daniels (<b>working</b> for the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission) in 1976, by Rider and Blacksmith (<b>working</b> for the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection) in 1985, by Copeland (<b>working</b> for the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission) in 1992, by Moase (<b>working</b> for the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission) in 1993, and Popp and McGurl in 2003. The stream is on the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection Bureau of Abandoned Mine Restoration's {{priority}} list for restoration.|$|E

5|$|The February Revolution {{halted the}} Finnish {{economic}} boom {{caused by the}} Russian war-economy. The collapse in business led to unemployment and high inflation, but the workers who had a job gained an opportunity to resolve long-term problems of their laborious <b>working</b> life. The commoners call for eight-hour-per-day <b>working</b> limits, better <b>working</b> conditions and higher wages led to demonstrations and large-scale strikes in industry and agriculture.|$|E
5|$|The Reform Act did not enfranchise the <b>working</b> class since {{voters were}} {{required}} to possess property worth £10, a substantial sum at the time. This split the alliance between the <b>working</b> class and the middle class, giving rise to the Chartist Movement.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept of}} Wreck-It Ralph was first {{developed}} at Disney {{in the late}} 1980s, under the <b>working</b> title High Score. Since then, it was redeveloped and reconsidered several times: In the late 1990s, it took on the <b>working</b> title Joe Jump, then in the mid-2000s as Reboot Ralph.|$|E
5|$|The {{main goal}} of the Liber was to {{document}} the landholdings of the diocese and bishop, and to keep a register of the written charters and leases pertaining to {{the property of the}} church at Worcester. Because there is no narrative tying the documents together, the Liber should be seen as a <b>working</b> document, compiled {{for the use of the}} bishop and monks, and designed not as a literary work but a legal one. The Liber was revised during its <b>working</b> life, which adds further support for the <b>working</b> nature of the composition.|$|E
5|$|The nominal <b>working</b> {{pressure}} {{is not necessarily}} the same as the actual <b>working</b> pressure used. Some steel cylinders manufactured to US standards are permitted to exceed the nominal <b>working</b> pressure by 10% and this is indicated by a '+' symbol. This extra pressure allowance is dependent on the cylinder passing the appropriate periodical hydrostatic test and is not necessarily valid for US cylinders exported to countries with differing standards. The nominal gas content of these cylinders is based on the 10% higher pressure.|$|E
5|$|The other {{important}} contribution to Marx's revision of Hegelianism came from Engels's book, The Condition of the <b>Working</b> Class in England in 1844, which led Marx to conceive of the historical dialectic in terms of class conflict {{and to see the}} modern <b>working</b> class as the most progressive force for revolution.|$|E
5|$|The safeworking of trains between {{stations}} on {{the early}} lines was time interval <b>working,</b> where a train {{would be allowed to}} leave a given time after the train before it. With heavier traffic this method became unsafe, with Staff and Ticket <b>working</b> on single lines adopted from 1873, and telegraph block <b>working</b> from 1878 on double lines. Both of these systems ensured that only one train would be in a section of track at one time. Telegraphic block <b>working</b> was then replaced with Winters Block <b>working</b> between 1883 and 1888, a system that is a predecessor of the Double line Block system which is still used today. Later years saw variations made to the Staff and Ticket system, with busier lines provided with Electric Staff <b>working</b> which provided greater safely when more trains ran.|$|E
5|$|The {{three main}} {{industries}} on Svalbard are coal mining, tourism, and research. In 2007, there were 484 people <b>working</b> in the mining sector, 211 people <b>working</b> in the tourism sector and 111 people <b>working</b> {{in the education}} sector. The same year, the mining gave a revenue of NOK2.008 billion (227,791,078 USD), tourism NOK317 million (35,967,202 USD) and research NOK142 million (16,098,404 USD) In 2006, the average income for economically active people was NOK494,700; 23% higher than on the mainland. Almost all housing {{is owned by the}} various employers and institutions and rented to their employees; {{there are only a few}} privately owned houses, most of which are recreational cabins. Because of this, it is nearly impossible to live on Svalbard without <b>working</b> for an established institution.|$|E
5|$|The wage {{reform was}} linked to a program that reduced {{the length of the}} overall <b>working</b> week in the Soviet Union, and in 1958, the <b>working</b> week was reduced from 48 hours to 41. This was to apply to all Soviet workers, and by 1961, 40 million Soviet workers (approximately two thirds of the workforce) were <b>working</b> a 41-hour week. It was planned to {{decrease}} this further to 40 hours in 1962, but this was eventually not carried out. Khrushchev had stated a longer-term aim of giving Soviet workers the shortest <b>working</b> hours in the world, aiming for a 30- to 35-hour week by 1968. He had spoken previously of the reduction of <b>working</b> hours as a basic goal of a communist movement and had hoped that communism would eventually achieve a <b>working</b> day of 3–4 hours.|$|E
5|$|There are {{physical}} {{differences between}} the show strains and <b>working</b> strains in the UK. While the show strain is bred to the conformation standard, the <b>working</b> strain is bred for <b>working</b> ability and as such several physical differences have appeared. <b>Working</b> type dogs tend to be larger with flatter heads and shorter ears. The coat also tends to be shorter and finer than the show variety and have less feathering. The <b>working</b> strain {{seems to be more}} energetic than the show strain.|$|E
