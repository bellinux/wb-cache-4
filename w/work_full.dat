To finance his pursuits, he began The Book Collector's Service Bureau, a mail-order book service, {{beginning with a}} letter of introduction sent to 100 homes. The venture proved so successful that for a time Marcus considered entering that line of <b>work</b> <b>full</b> time, concerned that entering the retail business might curtail his freedom of expression in politics and other areas of interest; his father persuaded {{him that he would}} always be granted the liberty of his own views, and pointed out that retailing was more profitable and thus would allow him to amass a large book collection that much sooner.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{study the}} career {{progression}} of NHS doctors, comparing men and women. DESIGN: Postal questionnaire surveys. Participants and setting Graduates of 1977, 1988, and 1993 from all UK medical schools. RESULTS: The {{response rate was}} 68 % (7012 / 10 344). Within general practice, 97 % (1208 / 1243) of men, 99 % (264 / 267) of women who had always <b>worked</b> <b>full</b> time throughout their career, and 87 % (1083 / 1248) of all women were principals. Median times from qualification to principal status were 5. 8 (95 % confidence interval 5. 6 to 6. 0) years for men, 5. 6 (5. 4 to 5. 8) years for women who had <b>worked</b> <b>full</b> time during training, and 6. 8 (6. 5 to 7. 0) years for all women. Of the 1977 and 1988 graduates in hospital practice, 96 % (1293 / 1347) of men were consultants, compared with 92 % (276 / 299) of women who had always <b>worked</b> <b>full</b> time throughout their career and 67 % (277 / 416) of women who had not. Median time to first consultant post was 11. 7 (11. 5 to 11. 9) years for men, 11. 3 (11. 0 to 11. 6) years for women who <b>worked</b> <b>full</b> time during training, and 12. 3 (12. 0 to 12. 6) years for all women. Women who had not always <b>worked</b> <b>full</b> time throughout their career were over-represented in general practice and under-represented in most hospital specialties, substantially so in the surgical specialties and anaesthetics. Women who had always <b>worked</b> <b>full</b> time were under-represented {{not only in the}} surgical specialties but also in general practice. CONCLUSIONS: Women not progressing as far and as fast as men was, generally, a reflection of not having always <b>worked</b> <b>full</b> time rather than their sex. The findings suggest that women do not generally encounter direct discrimination; however, the possibility that indirect discrimination, such as lack of opportunities for part time work, has influenced choice of specialty cannot be ruled out...|$|R

500|$|Tim Ashley {{wrote in}} The Guardian in 2009 that Khachaturian's {{popularity}} {{fell in the}} West, because of his image as one of Soviet music's [...] "". He argued, [...] "Such a view is simplistic, given {{that he had a}} major brush with the authorities in 1948. But it's also easy to see how he acquired his awkward reputation when you hear his Violin Concerto, dating from 1940. It's an immensely attractive <b>work,</b> <b>full</b> of his trademark Armenian folk flourishes, and the swaying, hypnotic Andante is notably beautiful. But the unforced optimism of the outer movements now seems unthinking when we realise it was composed at a time when Stalin was giving Prokofiev and Shostakovich hell." [...] In 2003 conductor Marin Alsop opined that Khachaturian is [...] "very underperformed" [...] and [...] "somewhat underrated". She commented further: [...] "His music, of course, has {{a little bit of the}} edginess of the 20th-century sound, the dissonances coming in. But at the same time it marries this beautiful neo-romanticism and lush orchestration and the over-the-top approach, so I think, he can be quite relevant these days." ...|$|E

Band members also organized a 2012 tribute concert to the Montana band. M2WB now plays semi-regular performances, including some out-of-state in locations such as Lake Tahoe. In 2005 they released their entire recorded output in a box set entitled Private Stash, which included music, DVD recordings of performances, and cover art by Monte Dolack. The band {{was the subject of}} a 2009 PBS documentary, [...] "Never Long Gone: The Mission Mountain Wood Band Story." [...] That year, they also opened for John Fogerty at the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally. The band added singer and songwriter Tim Ryan to the group to fill the position once held by Robinson. They released a new studio album called Reboot in 2011 with a tour in support, and in 2014 a second new album, Now and Then. [...] Though all members continue to play music, only Ryan and Quist individually continue to <b>work</b> <b>full</b> time as musicians, Quist with Great Northern and later with his adult children Guthrie and Halladay in a band they called House of Quist.

After four years at the University, Novak left it to become a full-time journalist without a degree, {{even though he was}} only one course short of the requirements.

2500|$|Published in 2012 on {{the topic}} of the vagina, Vagina: A New Biography was widely criticized, {{especially}} by feminist authors. Calling it [...] "ludicrous" [...] at Slate.com, Katie Roiphe wrote, [...] "I doubt the most brilliant novelist in the world could have created a more skewering satire of Naomi Wolf’s career than her latest book." [...] In The Nation, Katha Pollitt said the book was [...] "silly" [...] and contained [...] "much dubious neuroscience and much foolishness"; she concluded, [...] "It’s lucky vaginas can’t read, or mine would be cringing in embarrassment." [...] Although writing that [...] "Wolf’s ideas and suggestions in 'Vagina' are valuable ones," [...] Toni Bentley said in The New York Times Book Review that the book contained [...] "shoddy" [...] research and [...] "is undermined by the fact that she has rendered herself less than unreliable {{over the past couple of}} decades, with one rant more hysterical than another." [...] In The New York Review of Books Zoë Heller called Vagina [...] "a shoddy piece of <b>work,</b> <b>full</b> of childlike generalizations and dreary, feminist auto-think." [...] Los Angeles Times columnist Meghan Daum decried the book’s [...] "painful" [...] writing and its [...] "hoary ideas about how women think." [...] In The New York Observer, Nina Burleigh suggested that critics of the book were so vehement [...] "because (a) their editors handed the book to them for review because they thought it was an Important Feminist Book when it's actually slight and (b) there’s a grain of truth in what she’s trying to say." ...|$|E
2500|$|Joseph Luster of Otaku USA {{noted that}} the story is typical for its time, but said that this [...] "is overshadowed by its bold, filmic execution" [...] {{as well as its}} insight into Tatsumi's early career. Katherine Dacey of Manga Bookshelf found the art's anatomy lacking, but complimented its {{characterization}} and composition, concluding that the manga has [...] "a vital, improvisatory energy missing from Tatsumi's later period". Greg McElhatton of Read About Comics liked the manga's tense situations, but felt that the second half was slow with a weak ending, and said that Tatsumi's art is [...] "blocky and crude in places, but there's an energy about it that helps propel those early pages forward." [...] Connie C. of Comic Book Resources described it as a [...] "very straightforward crime story, [...] is well told, but doesn't get much more elaborate", but called it a [...] "beautiful example" [...] of a pulp short story. Tom Spurgeon called the manga [...] "a fun but rough <b>work,</b> <b>full</b> of character types and situations entirely too on the nose to reflect the nuances of certain moral questions brought to bear", especially disliking the ending and saying of the art: [...] "the best scenes in Black Blizzard have a physical immediacy that only arises from fundamentally solid cartooning with a corresponding attention to movement". Publishers Weekly called the story and layouts simple, and the art sometimes crude, but [...] "with a cinematic use of perspective, intensified via the characters and their circumstances, Tatsumi constructs a thrilling narrative with emotional depth." [...] Michelle Smith of Comic Book Resources said that the manga is [...] "a quick and fun hard-boiled adventure yarn", feeling that the story was [...] "silly" [...] and Shinpei's connection [...] "too convenient", but complimenting the [...] "fast-paced narrative" [...] and finding the rough art to suit the characters. The A.V. Club described the manga as a [...] "head-spinning blur of hardboiled suspense", likening the climax to Mickey Spillane's work, and calling Tatsumi's early art [...] "necessarily loose and frantic". Shawn O'Rourke of PopMatters compared the story's nervous tension to EC Comics stories and said that the art [...] "while simplistic, conveys a depth and nuance that engages the reader", adding that [...] "unwieldy exposition or narrative declarations" [...] are avoided, and that the manga [...] "is still eminently enjoyable in a way that so many of dated classics of that era are not." [...] ICv2 said that [...] "Tatsumi skillfully uses the conventions of the crime story to examine his characters who come from very different social backgrounds", calling Black Blizzard [...] "one of the first examples of the realistic, socially conscious, and adult (in the best sense of the term) gekiga genre of manga." [...] Deb Aoki of About.com said of the manga: [...] "while not as polished as his later works, this one-shot crackles with youthful energy, cinematic style, and Tatsumi's burning desire to push the boundaries of manga beyond kids stuff." ...|$|E

The fact that the earnings effect in 2005 – 2006, in percentage terms, was about double the employment effect in that same year suggests that the increase in earnings was driven in part by ERA group members working more hours or receiving higher wages. 17 According to data from the 2 -year customer survey, ERA increased the proportion of NDLP participants who <b>worked</b> <b>full</b> time, probably in response to the programme’s retention bonus, which rewarded only full-time work.

6000|$|Altogether {{an admirable}} <b>work....</b> <b>Full</b> of humor, boisterous, but delicate,--of wit {{withering}} and scorching, yet {{combined with a}} pathos cool as morning dew,--of satire ponderous as the mace of Richard, yet keen as the scymitar of Saladin.... A <b>work</b> <b>full</b> of 'mountain-mirth,' mischievous as Puck, and lightsome as Ariel.... We know not whether to admire most the genial, fresh, and discursive concinnity of the author, or his playful fancy, weird imagination, and compass of style, at once both objective and subjective.... We might indulge in some criticisms, but, were the author other than he is, {{he would be a}} different being. As it is, he has a wonderful pose, which flits from flower to flower, and bears the reader irresistibly along on its eagle pinions (like Ganymede) to the 'highest heaven of invention.' ... We love a book so purely objective ... Many of his pictures of natural scenery have an extraordinary subjective clearness and fidelity.... In fine, we consider this {{as one of the most}} extraordinary volumes of this or any age. We know of no English author who could have written it. It is a work to which the proud genius of our country, standing with one foot on the Aroostook and the other on the Rio Grande, and holding up the star-spangled banner amid the wreck of matter and the crush of worlds, may point with bewildering scorn of the punier efforts of enslaved Europe....
