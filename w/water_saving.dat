5|$|While on a {{shopping}} {{trip to the}} Springfield Mall, Mr. Burns finds a penny in a water fountain and reaches in to grab it (fearing Ralph might take it) and falls in. The rushing water nearly drowns him, but Homer arrives and pulls {{him out of the}} <b>water,</b> <b>saving</b> Mr. Burns's life. To reward him, Mr. Burns offers to take Homer out to dinner. Homer says he likes Chicago deep dish pizza, so Mr. Burns takes him to Chicago on his private plane. On the plane, Homer is treated with luxury and gets serenaded by Lionel Richie. Homer has the time of his life in Chicago, but he becomes depressed on the return trip because he does not have the plane. Back in Springfield, Homer tells Marge that he is tired of being a normal person and becomes depressed. Marge, pitying for Homer, decides to help and hires him a life coach named Colby Kraus (Stephen Colbert), who will help with Homer's dream. Colby starts right away in his treatment with Homer by videotaping his every move. At the bowling alley and after watching Homer's daily habits for a few days, Colby realizes that bowling is the one thing Homer is good at and enjoys doing. He instructs Homer to wear his bowling shoes everywhere he goes to help instill confidence in everything he does. The bowling shoes work, Homer becomes a new man, and as a result he receives numerous new job offers. Homer decides to only go for an interview at Handyman's Choice Copper Tubing because he would be required to fly in the company jet as part of his new job, however, the Rich Texan does not hire him.|$|E

25|$|The average water tariff {{reported}} in 2014 was KSh 60 or US$0.60 per m3. This figure {{is not very}} indicative because of significant regional variations and because in Kenya a progressive block tariff system is in place for household connections. This means {{that for the first}} 10 m3 a minimum charge is paid that corresponds to a low, highly subsidised tariff, while for the following blocks (up to 20, 50, 100 and 300 as well as above 300 m3) an increasingly higher tariff is being charged, with the tariff in the highest block being five times higher than in the lowest block. Where no meter is installed, a fixed monthly charge is applied. The rationale for this system is to promote <b>water</b> <b>saving</b> practices and to ensure that low-income households can afford to use an adequate amount of water. However, there are problems with this system, because households in low-income areas resell water or share a connection with other households and thus risk ending up paying a higher tariff.|$|E
40|$|Majority of the {{investigations}} on rainwater harvesting focused on sizing and potential <b>water</b> <b>savings</b> including studies proposing different methods of estimating rainwater tank outcomes. Several studies used monthly rainfall data to estimate rainwater tank outcomes. However, quantification using daily rainfall {{data will be}} much more accurate compared to using monthly rainfall data. A vast majority of works using daily rainfall data used daily water balance model for analysis. Again most of the studies using daily water balance model used historical rainfall data, calculated <b>water</b> <b>savings</b> for many years and then presented an average of all the calculated years’ total outcome(s). ‘Raintank Analyser’ is a tool, which uses the same methodology and widely used; used by the South Australian policy makers for producing relevant design charts. In contrast, eTank, a daily water balance model was developed to produce potential rainwater savings, augmented townwater supply, tank overflow, reliability and payback period for three distinct climate conditions (dry, average and wet years). This paper presents comparison of eTank calculated potential <b>water</b> <b>savings</b> with those calculated by ‘Raintank Analyser’ under similar conditions for a rainfall station in central Adelaide. In general, ‘Raintank Analyser’ produced <b>water</b> <b>savings</b> are very close to the eTank calculated <b>water</b> <b>savings</b> in average year. However, through the eTank produced potential <b>water</b> <b>savings</b> in dry and wet years, it is found that significant climatic variations exist. Magnitudes of climatic variations under different scenario are presented. Again, to assess spatial variability, three more rainfall stations from different regions of Adelaide metropolitan were selected. eTank was used to calculated potential <b>water</b> <b>savings</b> in three climatic conditions (dry, average and wet years) for various combinations of roof and tank sizes. Again it is found that depending input variable conditions (tank size, roof area and climate) significant spatial variations exist within some of the regions. Also, it is found that potential <b>water</b> <b>savings</b> not only depends on total rainfall amount of a particular area, but also on other input conditions; i. e. under similar conditions an area with lower annual rainfall may provide higher <b>water</b> <b>savings</b> due to rainfall pattern...|$|R

25|$|Melbourne's {{air quality}} is {{generally}} good and has improved significantly since the 1980s. Like many urban environments, the city faces significant environmental issues, {{many of them}} relating to the city's large urban footprint and urban sprawl {{and the demand for}} infrastructure and services.

Periodic droughts and consistently high summer temperatures deplete Melbourne water supplies, and climate change may exacerbate the long-term impact of these factors on Melbourne's water supplies. During the Millennium drought, the Bracks Government implemented water restrictions and a range of other options including water recycling, incentives for household water tanks, greywater systems, water consumption awareness initiatives, and other <b>water</b> <b>saving</b> and reuse initiatives. However, as water storages continued to fall further measures were required; in June 2007 the Bracks Government announced the construction of the $3.1 billion Wonthaggi desalination plant, and the so-called North-South Pipeline from the Goulburn Valley in Victoria's north to Melbourne. Neither project was used extensively before the drought broke during 2010, and therefore both have been criticised as 'white elephants'.|$|E

40|$|With {{the growing}} {{population}} and ever-increasing water demand water authorities of many highly populated cities {{are struggling to}} maintain potable water supply for the residents. Without effective measure(s) the situation is expected to get worse day by day. To reduce the potable water demand, several methods/systems were proposed; rainwater harvesting, greywater reuse, recycled (treated) water supply and using water efficient appliances. Among all the water harvesting and recycling systems, Rain Water Harvesting System (RWHS) {{is considered to be}} the most effective, reliable and safe if used for non-potable purposes. Rainwater tank is the most common form among all the rainwater harvesting systems. For many remote communities rainwater tank is essential as they have to buy expensive bottle water for daily consumptions. In some urban areas due to lack of resources authorities are unable to provide continuous water supply. Even among urban communities where efficient urban water supply exist, rainwater tank is increasingly being used for non-potable purposes (i. e. garden irrigation, toilet flushing, cloth washing etc.) to reduce potable water consumptions. RWHS comprises with a rainwater collection surface (eg. roof), water storage (eg. water tank), pumping system for distribution and other accessories (eg. first flush diverter, overflow). However, optimisation of this system both in <b>water</b> <b>savings</b> and reliability is a challenge. Various studies and methods of analyses have been used in this regard. Among methods of analysing RWHS, a daily water balance method is most feasible and reasonably accurate. However, most of the relevant past studies using daily data used continuous simulations of historical daily rainfall for a long period, which provides single averaged outcomes (i. e. <b>water</b> <b>savings,</b> reliability, overflow etc.). Through such analysis of averaged variables, rainwater tank users do not get an adequate insight of the expected realistic situation(s) in regards to variability of outcomes. With the impacts of climate change, such ranges of realistic outcomes are expected to be widening further. This paper presents analyses from a recently developed daily water balance model (eTank), which calculates rainwater tank outcomes under three different climatic conditions (i. e. dry, average and wet years). To investigate the climatic variability fifteen representative years (five for each dry, average and wet conditions) were selected from historical rainfall data collected from a coastal site (Sydney Observatory Hill) of an Australian major city, Sydney. Calculated expected annual rainwater savings were compared with the calculated <b>water</b> <b>savings</b> generated by widely used tool, 'Raintank Analyser', which uses historical daily rainfall data for many years and presents an average of all the calculated years' cumulative <b>water</b> <b>savings.</b> It is found that 'Raintank Analyser' calculated <b>water</b> <b>savings</b> closely match with the eTank calculated <b>water</b> <b>savings</b> in average year, which is reasonable and ascertains eTank's accuracy. However, significant climatic variations in <b>water</b> <b>savings</b> are expected for the particular location as calculated by eTank. Also, eTank calculated <b>water</b> <b>savings</b> were compared with the published results from another continuous simulation type water balance model, CSWBM for the same rainfall station for large roofs. Calculations were performed considering same conditions in regard to daily rainwater demand, roof area, losses and tank volume. It is found that CSWBM produced <b>water</b> <b>savings</b> significantly vary with the eTank calculated water savings; for smaller tank sizes CSWBM calculated <b>water</b> <b>savings</b> are even lower than the eTank calculated <b>water</b> <b>savings</b> in dry year, whereas for larger tank sizes CSWBM calculated <b>water</b> <b>savings</b> are closer to the eTank calculated <b>water</b> <b>savings</b> in wet year. In reality, continuous simulation type water balance model results should be closer to the eTank calculated results in dry years. CSWBM calculated reliabilities were compared with the eTank calculated reliabilities in different climatic conditions. Again, it is found that CSWBM calculated reliabilities significantly vary with the eTank calculated reliabilities; for larger tank sizes CSWBM calculated reliabilities are much higher than the eTank calculated reliabilities even in wet year, which is not realistic. Presented comparisons reveals the fact that users should be cautious in using such computational tool(s) as some of these tools may produce erroneous results...|$|R

40|$|Forty {{percent of}} {{freshwater}} withdrawals in the United States are for irrigated agriculture, which contribute more than $ 50 {{billion to the}} economy. Increasing diversions of water for urban, environmental, and other uses will likely decrease water available to agriculture. Water conservation in agriculture is touted as a good method for minimizing the impact of reduced agricultural diversions on production. Because “wasted” water is often reused until it reaches the ocean, there are limitations to the true <b>water</b> <b>savings</b> that result from programs that aim to increase irrigation efficiency. True <b>water</b> <b>savings</b> can come from four areas: reduction of unnecessary evaporation and transpiration, more effective use of rainfall, reduction of deep percolation water that becomes severely degraded in quality, and reduction of runoff from fields that is not reusable downstream. Any other reduction in net water consumption must come from reductions in evapotranspiration from the crops grown, which requires either reduction in acreage or reduction in crop yield brought on by intentional plant water stress. Other benefits of field or district-level water conservation may include increased in-stream flows (due to lower diversions) and energy conservation due to less pumping or more hydroelectric production, but not result in true <b>water</b> <b>savings,</b> since unconsumed <b>water</b> returns as a usable water resource. Understanding the hydrologic settings is critical to determining true <b>water</b> <b>savings</b> from conservation practices.
