2500|$|There is a radio {{navigation}} aid provided at the Omak Airport {{which are used}} by pilots on aircraft coming from other nearby airports to determine their location. The navigation system {{is owned by the}} Omak City Council, operates 24hours daily, and serves a number of surrounding airports that do not contain these aids. Other navigational purpose aids include a communication system, full-instrument landing approach system, lighted <b>wind</b> <b>sock</b> and segmented circle. A water system is situated at the Omak Airport as well, and there are proposals to improve it. While telephone service is provided by US West, power to the E-class airfield in Omak, is offered by the Okanogan County Public Utilities District. There have been proposals from the FAA to amend its E-class status by extending upward to an elevation of [...] and removing its non-active navigation aid since January2013. The FAA noted that {{the size and shape of}} the Omak Airport would still stay the same by using its airport reference point. According to them, the regulation would only involve technical facilities. Owned and operated by the Omak City Council, the airport contains a number of employees including manager Ken Mears. Having been surveyed by the U.S. National Geodetic Survey and part of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, it serves as a member of the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems (NPIAS) for 2011–15, which categorized it as a general aviation airport, along with two other Okanogan airports: Anderson Field and Dorothy Scott Airport. The NPIAS has commercial airports, reliever and selected general aviation airports part of their system.|$|E
5000|$|Koinobori (鯉のぼり), meaning [...] "carp streamer" [...] in Japanese, are carp-shaped <b>wind</b> <b>socks</b> {{traditionally}} {{flown in}} Japan to celebrate Tango no sekku (端午の節句), a traditional calendrical event {{which is now}} designated a national holiday; Children's Day (Kodomo no Hi, 子供の日). These <b>wind</b> <b>socks</b> are made by drawing carp patterns on paper, cloth or other nonwoven fabric. They are then allowed to flutter in the wind. They are also known as satsuki-nobori (皐のぼり).|$|R

There are rotating <b>wind</b> <b>socks</b> which spin like a turbine. On large display kites these tails, spinners and spinsocks can be 50 feet m long or more.|$|R
5000|$|IFP has {{a couple}} {{features}} that allow pilots in the area be better informed of weather at the airport. Both of them provide accurate and up-to-date weather information. There are three lighted <b>wind</b> <b>socks</b> that show <b>wind</b> directions and approximate speed. Also, a new Automated Weather Observation System (AWOS) was installed in 2007 and records weather data such as “wind speed, wind gusts, wind direction, variable wind direction, temperature, dew point, altimeter setting, density altitude, visibility, variable visibility, precipitation, sky condition, and cloud height”. [...] The AWOS data {{can be heard in}} an aircraft if the pilot tunes into 119.825 on the radio controls.|$|R

5|$|Zoroastrians were {{subjected}} to public discrimination through dress regulations – not allowed to wear new or white clothes, and compelled by enactments to wear the dull yellow raiment already alluded to as a distinguishing badge. They {{were not allowed to}} wear overcoats but were compelled to wear long robes called qaba and cotton geeveh on their feet even in winter. Wearing eyeglasses, long cloak, trousers, hat, boots, <b>socks,</b> <b>winding</b> their turbans tightly and neatly, carrying watch or a ring, were all forbidden to Zoroastrians. During the rainy days they were not allowed carry umbrellas or to appear in public, because the water that had run down through their bodies and cloths could pollute the Muslims. Zoroastrian men in Yazd would carry a large shawl that they would place under their feet when visiting a Muslim's home so as to prevent the carpet from being polluted. Forbidden from riding horses and only allowed to ride mules or donkeys, upon facing a Muslim they had to dismount. Not until 1923, was the general proscription against Zoroastrians' riding horses and donkeys lifted by Reza Shah.|$|R
40|$|The larvae {{of coastal}} species {{interact}} with nearshore currents that {{are complex and}} can alter dispersal. I investigated two sites in southern Oregon with different nearshore hydrodynamics: the first site, Sunset Bay, is a small cove with a topographic front that extends across the mouth during upwelling-favorable <b>winds.</b> Using holey <b>sock</b> drogues at 1. 5 m and 5. 5 m depths and surface drifters at 10 cm depth, I found that, when the front was present, water at 1. 5 m was retained within the bay whereas water was exchanged across the front {{at a depth of}} 5. 5 m. Surface drifters indicated a surface convergence. Surface plankton tows on either side and within the frontal convergence (a shore-parallel foam line) found significantly higher concentrations of barnacle cyprids, crab megalopae and zoea, polychaete larvae, platyhelminthes juveniles, isopods, amphipods, harpacticoid copepods, and fish eggs. Crustacean nauplii (barnacle, euphausiid, and copepod) and calanoid copepods were not concentrated in the convergence, and when the front and foam line were absent, no taxa were concentrated. Plankton tows taken within the foam line as it dissipated shoreward during a wind-reversal event found that concentrations of cyprids, megalopae, and gastropod veligers remained high as the foam line moved, suggesting that it acts as a moving convergence propagating competent larvae shoreward. I measured settlement of two taxa at Sunset Bay and Shore Acres, an open-coast site < 2 km away. Barnacle settlement measured every other day from June-September 2013 was significantly cross-correlated with the maximum daily tidal height at lags of - 2 days at Sunset Bay and + 2 and + 4 days at Shore Acres. Settlement was also significantly negatively cross-correlated with wave height at a lag of - 4 days at Sunset Bay. Coralline algae settlement measured during eight 48 -hr periods in July-August 2013 was significantly negatively correlated with wave height (n = 8, R 2 = 0. 76, P = 0. 0049) at Shore Acres but not at Sunset Bay. Despite the close proximity of the Sunset Bay and Shore Acres sites, settlement patterns differed between taxa, suggesting that differences in nearshore hydrodynamics might affect the supply of water and larvae to shore.

50|$|Red Top, much to everyone’s surprise, {{had sort}} of an airport in the 1940s. It was simply the field {{on the north side}} of town. A <b>wind</b> <b>sock</b> on a {{tamarack}} pole was the “control tower.” Much to the consternation of Oscar Anderson, the flight path was directly over his store. Arnold Pinz and Henry Paulson among others, flew in and out from Red Top.|$|E
5000|$|This {{information}} is verified on arrival by overflying the airfield {{and looking out}} for the wind direction indications from a <b>wind</b> <b>sock,</b> smoke from fires, etc., or any ground signals in the signals square (if present).

5000|$|Most {{shrouded}} turbines are directional, {{although one}} {{exception is the}} version off Southern Vancouver Island in British Columbia. One-direction fixed shrouds may not capture flow efficiently - {{in order for the}} shroud to produce maximum efficiency to use both flood and ebb tide they need to be yawed like a windmill on a pivot or turntable, or suspended under a pontoon on a marine swing mooring allowing the turbine to always face upstream like a <b>wind</b> <b>sock.</b>|$|E
50|$|Normal landing {{direction}} is toward the north on runway 31, with limited tiedowns at the northwest end marked by short white perpendicular lines. Barbed wire fence surrounds the runway, {{and may be}} a hazard to some aircraft. Cattle are occasionally loose inside the fenced runway, or just outside the fence. There may be some small loose stones on the hard surface. A <b>wind</b> <b>sock</b> {{is located at the}} west fence approximately mid-field. Avoid overflight of homes and buildings, and practice noise abatement procedures.|$|E
50|$|Not all {{shrouded}} turbines are {{the same}} - {{the performance of a}} shrouded turbine varies with the design of the shroud. Not all shrouded turbines have undergone independent scrutiny of claimed performances, as companies closely guard their respective technologies, so quoted performance figures need to be closely scrutinised. Lunar Energy reports a 15%-25% improvement over the same turbine without the shroud. Shrouded turbines do not operate at maximum efficiency when the shroud does not intercept the current flow at the correct angle, which can occur as currents eddy and swirl, resulting in reduced operational efficiency. At lower turbine efficiencies the extra cost of the shroud must be justified, while at higher efficiencies the extra cost of the shroud has less impact on commercial returns. Similarly the added cost of the supporting structure for the shroud has to be balanced against the performance gained. Yawing (pivoting) the shroud and turbine at the correct angle, so it always faces upstream like a <b>wind</b> <b>sock,</b> can increase turbine performance but may need expensive active devices to turn the shroud into the flow. Passive designs can be incorporated, such as floating the shrouded turbine under a pontoon on a swing mooring, or flying the turbine like a kite under water. One design by Tidal Energy Pty Ltd passively yaws the shrouded turbine using a turntable with a peer reviewed claim of 3.84 (384%) increase in efficiency over the same turbine minus the shroud - See Kirke..|$|E
50|$|Bart Spadaro (founder of the airport) died October 5, 2013, {{at which}} time Susan Spadaro (Bart's daughter) had assumed control of the airport. Since then, {{aviation}} services such as aircraft maintenance, aircraft repair, aircraft inspections, aircraft rentals, flight instruction, sightseeing, etc. were no longer available at this facility. Skydiving operations continued {{at the airport and}} were provided by an independent operator. Airport maintenance was the removal of debris {{around the perimeter of the}} airport as well as removal of abandoned vehicles and hangars. The dirt taxiway was not very well maintained. The segmented circle was typically overgrown with weeds and was not visible during warmer months. There were no <b>wind</b> <b>sock,</b> flags or any other devices on the field to indicate wind direction or wind speed. The asphalt runway surface was in generally good condition although there was a pothole near the beginning of runway 18 on the right side. Markings for runway 18 were faded to the point of no longer being visible. Adjacent to the runway was mostly bare sandy ground that was prone to creating dust clouds and flung gravel in the presence of propeller blast. Susan Spadaro is not known to hold any credentials in the field of aviation. As of 2016, the airport is closed to operations. The town of Brookhaven decided to shut down the airport, due to failure of pilots to action the noise abatement procedures established by the town, bringing a series of complaints that led to its closure, as well as the closure of Lufker Airport for three months.|$|E
