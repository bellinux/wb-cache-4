25|$|For example, {{consider}} the deterministic sorting algorithm quicksort. This solves {{the problem of}} sorting a list of integers that is given as the input. The worst-case is when the input is sorted or sorted in reverse order, and the algorithm takes time O(n2) for this case. If <b>we</b> <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> all possible permutations of the input list are equally likely, the average time taken for sorting is O(n log n). The best case occurs when each pivoting divides the list in half, also needing O(n log n) time.|$|E
25|$|That is, if <b>we</b> <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> NP, {{the class}} of nondeterministic {{polynomial}} time problems, can be contained in the non-uniform polynomial time complexity class P/poly, then this assumption implies {{the collapse of the}} polynomial hierarchy at its second level. Such a collapse is believed unlikely, so the theorem is generally viewed by complexity theorists as evidence for the nonexistence of polynomial size circuits for SAT or for other NP-complete problems. A proof that such circuits do not exist would imply that P ≠ NP. As P/poly contains all problems solvable in randomized polynomial time (Adleman's theorem), the Karp–Lipton theorem is also evidence that the use of randomization does not lead to polynomial time algorithms for NP-complete problems.|$|E
25|$|The Calkin–Wilf tree may {{be defined}} as a {{directed}} graph in which each positive rational number a/b occurs as a vertex and has one outgoing edge to another vertex, its parent. <b>We</b> <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> a/b is in simplest terms; that is, the greatest common divisor of a and b is 1. If a/b<1, the parent of a/b is a/(b'a); if a/b is greater than one, the parent of a/b is (a'b)/b. Thus, in either case, the parent is a fraction with a smaller sum of numerator and denominator, so repeated reduction of this type must eventually reach the number 1. As a graph with one outgoing edge per vertex and one root reachable by all other vertices, the Calkin–Wilf tree must indeed be a tree.|$|E

25|$|Some {{scholars}} claim, {{that while}} acceptance of Jordanes {{at face value}} may be too naive, a totally skeptical view is not warranted. For example, Jordanes says that the Goths originated in Scandinavia 1490 BC. Austrian historian Herwig Wolfram, believes {{that there might be}} a kernel of truth in that claim, if <b>we</b> <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> a clan of the Gutae left Scandinavia long before the establishment of the Amali in the leadership of the Goths. This clan might have contributed to the ethnogenesis of the Gutones in east Pomerania (see Wielbark culture). Another example is the name of the king Cniva which David S. Potter thinks is genuine because, since it doesn't appear in the fictionalized genealogy of Gothic kings given by Jordanes, he must have found it in a genuine 3rd-century source.|$|E

30|$|First, <b>we</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>that</b> heat {{transfer}} in the cooling tuff is governed only by conduction. However, because water infiltration along columnar joints effectively transfers heats from the deeper column to the margin, {{the growth rate}} of the columnar joints might be almost constant regardless of depth; therefore, the face width is also kept constant. Field observations show that the joint spacing (face width) of the columnar joints of colonnades in Mt. Mudeung is fairly constant along the extents; therefore, water infiltration effectively transfers the internal heat of the colonnades along columnar joints. To consider the effect of water infiltration, <b>we</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>that</b> the propagation rate of the temperature field in the early cooling stage represents the effective cooling rate maintained throughout the colonnades. Second, we neglected the discontinuous growth of columnar joints, which are expressed as straie, by <b>assuming</b> <b>that</b> the joint spacing grows constantly. Third, <b>we</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>that</b> deformation was occurring because the emplacement of the tuff was negligible, as evidenced by the minimal internal flow structure, high viscosity of the dacitic tuff, and a paucity of linear fractures caused by tuff flow that was demonstrated by field works (Lodge and Lescinsky, 2009 a, b; Park et al., 2005). Fourth, <b>we</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>that</b> thermodynamic parameters such as thermal conductivity and heat capacity do not depend on temperature and pressure. Finally, <b>we</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>that</b> {{heat transfer}}s only vertically along the welded tuff and that no lateral heat transfer occurs; one-dimensional heat conduction along the welded tuff was used to evaluate the Peclet numbers of the welded tuff.|$|R
