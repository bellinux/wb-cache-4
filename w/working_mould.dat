40|$|Several new {{technologies}} to assist plastic injection moulding companies have been developed in the last twenty years. A number of computer software programs are now available which could revolutionise mould design. The most exciting aspect of the Computer Aided Mould Design (CAMD) software is the effect it has on reducing the lead time required to produce a <b>working</b> <b>mould</b> from a product concept. The application of the new technology for designing moulds, however, has been slow in New Zealand. One {{of the main reasons}} for the slow progress is the perceived value of the software or consulting services. Many injection moulding companies who design and manufacture moulds do not realise the great potential of CAMD software to save many hours of mould changes and volume of polymer material, even when the program is used after the mould has been made. However, the true benefits are only seen when the mould is designed using CAMD before the mould has been manufactured. Moulds manufactured correctly the first time save a great deal of time, energy and money. The value of the software is not completely understood by injection moulding manufacturers. They perceive the immediate benefits, however, the ongoing benefits are not recognised. A project was carried out to demonstrate the potential of CAMD software in determining moulding problems in existing injection moulded products. Four products, two of which were supplied by an injection moulding company, that had moulding problems, were simulated using Moldflow, a CAMD software package. The results of the simulation were compared with the actual moulding problems. It was found that the Moldflow simulation results described the problems occurring in the moulds accurately. Moulding problems included warpage, air traps and weld lines in poor positions and flow marks. Warpage is a major problem in injection moulded products. Even simple products can warp if not designed correctly. The only problems Moldflow did not identify, and does not claim to, were the flow marks caused by jetting and splashing of plastic as it entered the cavity. The designer must be aware of the problems caused by jetting and design gates to avoid it. Moldflow, and other CAMD software, are beneficial tools for the mould designer. The advantages of CAMD include short mould development time, shorter lead times from concept to production, reduction in the amount of material used, fewer changes to machine settings and predictable, repeatable quality. These benefits are not only savings in the mould design and manufacture, they also continue on into the processing of the product since less material is used in the product and machine down time caused by moulding problems is greatly reduced...|$|E

40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been a shift from {{traditional}} cell culture on two-dimensional substrates towards the use of three-dimensional scaffolds for tissue engineering. Ice-templating is a versatile tool to create porous scaffolds from collagen. Here we discuss specific considerations for the design of moulds to produce freeze dried collagen scaffolds with pore sizes of around 100 µm, a range that is relevant to tissue engineering. A numerical model of heat conduction, implemented in COMSOL Multiphysics ® version 5. 0, calculated the temperature contour lines and heat flow vectors during cooling for a variety of mould geometries and materials. We show how temperature distribution within moulds determines the resulting pore structure of the scaffolds by regulating ice growth, and we validate our simulation against experimental results. These simulations are especially useful when <b>working</b> with <b>moulds</b> that contain volumes of more than 1 cm in each direction. Key word...|$|R

40|$|A {{study of}} the British members of the {{superfamily}} Beyrichiacea Matthew, 1886 (Ostracoda) has been undertaken. Nearly all of the taxa are Silurian in age; others are, very rarely, found in the Devonian. Wherever possible, extant type material has been located and a primary revision made. Such work has been augmented by studies on new collections, chiefly made from Central England and the Welsh Borderland. The thesis is arranged on a taxonomic basis; the subfamily is taken {{as the basis for}} each major section of the work. Other chapters deal with finds of British valves which exhibit intermediary stages in the metamorphosis of the crumina, and with a new beyrichiacean genus which is unique in its apparent lack of dimorphism. One section discusses the faunal distribution of the British Beyrichiacea and compares it with established successions elsewhere. Most of the techniques used, involve standard micropalaeontological practices. Casting methods, {{and the use of the}} scanning electron microscope for illustration of the casts, have proved invaluable for <b>working</b> with <b>mould</b> material, and provide an optomistic sign for the future study of ostracode mould faunas.

40|$|In {{the last}} decades TiAlN {{coatings}} deposited by PVD techniques have been extensively investigated but, nowadays, their potential development for tribological applications is relatively low. However, new coatings are emerging based on them, trying to improve wear behavior. TiAlSiN thin coatings are now investigated, analyzing if Si introduction increases the wear resistance of PVD films. Attending to the application, several wear test configurations has been recently used by some researchers. In this work, TiAlSiN thin coatings were produced by PVD Unbalanced Magnetron Sputtering technique and they were conveniently characterized using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) provided with Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS), Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), Electron Probe Micro-Analyzer (EPMA), Micro Hardness (MH) and Scratch Test Analysis. Properties as morphology, thickness, roughness, chemical composition and structure, hardness and film adhesion to the substrate were investigated. Concerning to wear characterization, two very different ways were chosen: micro-abrasion with ball-on-flat configuration and industrial non-standardized tests based on samples inserted in a feed channel of a selected plastic injection <b>mould</b> <b>working</b> with 30 % (wt.) glass fiber reinforced polypropylene.

40|$|In {{this project}} a new {{process for the}} {{compaction}} of moulds has been developed {{to the extent that}} the new process is ready for production. To the fact that the new method can be applied in many different fields in smaller and medium-sized jobbing-foundries it is possible to reach a high casting quality and exact dimensions as well as improvements in working conditions. It is technically possible and not too expensive to exchange a jolt-squeeze moulding machine by the type of machines presented here, adapted and trouble free peripheries are, however, very important. An enormous increase in quality as well as in economic efficiency could be shown. Meanwhile more than 1000 different types are formed according to this system. The introduction of the new process for the compaction of moulds gave reason to check the previous organisation of work. In a long-term qualification process the employees <b>working</b> in the <b>moulding</b> department learn to use the machine-moulding-system in team-work and to make responsibility for it.

40|$|The {{injection}} {{process of}} glass fibres reinforced plastics promotes the moulds surface degradation by erosion. In {{order to improve}} its wear resistance, several kinds of PVD thin hard coatings were used. It is well-known that nanostructures present a better compromise between hardness and toughness. Indeed, when the coating is constituted by {{a large number of}} ultra-thin different layers, cracks and interface troubles tend to decrease. However, {{it is not clear that}} these nanostructures present a better wear behaviour in erosion processes. In order to study its wear behaviour, a sputtered PVD nanostructured TiAlCrSiN coating was used. The substrate and film surfaces topography were analyzed by profilometry and atomic force microscopy techniques. Film adhesion to the substrate was evaluated by scratch tests. The surface hardness was measured with a Vickers micro-hardness tester. The wear resistance was evaluated by micro-abrasion with a rotating ball tribometer tests. Slurry of SiC particles in distilled water was used in order to provoke the surface abrasion. Different duration tests were performed in order to analyze the wear evolution. After these tests, the wear mechanisms developed were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy. Wear craters were measured and the wear rate was calculated and discussed. With the same purpose, coated inserts were mounted in an injection <b>mould</b> <b>working</b> with a 30 % glass fibres reinforced polypropylene.

40|$|Modern civil legal aid, has {{its roots}} in the post war United Kingdom, being a {{fundamental}} component of the welfare state, recognised as such by the political parties of the time. The provision of civil legal aid today is a different animal and does not share the same values as the 'old' scheme. This analysis will assess the evolution of civil legal aid, its success and failure, and consider the changes it has undergone and the forces behind those changes in dictating its current profile as a limited and franchised public services provision.;Legal expenses insurance, unlike civil legal aid, is a relative newcomer as a provider of access to civil justice. The scepticism that accompanied its arrival in this country, some 20 years ago, has dissipated. Insurers battled with the problems of adverse selection, European regulation and the public perception of their product, all of which have influenced market penetration. The position of legal expenses insurance within the civil justice system has begun to strengthen and is now openly recognised and supported by the legal establishment. A key objective of this analysis is to consider the rise of the legal expenses insurance market in the United Kingdom. This analysis seeks to assess the history of legal expenses insurance and evaluate its current position as a viable addition, or possible alternative, to State funded civil legal aid.;Therefore, it becomes necessary for this study to consider the position of comparative European jurisdictions. In addition, the role and reaction of the legal practitioner situated amidst such significant and fundamental change is solicited and evaluated since they have, at once, fought change and yet accepted it in equal measure.;Finally, this analysis explores the future position of civil legal aid and legal expenses insurance.

40|$|The aim of {{this report}} {{is to improve the}} focus on the use of Post-curing Methods of Composite Mouldings applied to small boat {{building}} companies and identify some key points which could be used in management decisions about yacht manufacturing. Current methods of post-curing are reviewed, together with the somewhat sparse literature available on stabilisation of mouldings, curing schedules and oven features. The methodology includes industrial visits & interviews, the application of thermodynamics, studies of other industries using composites and advice and guidance from experts in the fields of construction and energy consultancy. The results of the initial investigations are used to inform the design of a temporary oven & build enclosure which is then tested by the use of specially written spreadsheets for cost and energy modelling. Test results cover various sizes of boats from twenty to fifty feet (6 to 15 metres) at curing temperatures of 50 and 80 C based on data from a leading resin supplier in the industry and the stated alternative times for ramp-up and curing periods. The main conclusions (related to the manufacture of boats in the above range) are that in the short term it is cheaper to use additional energy for post-curing than to construct a more efficient build enclosure / oven where costs are being passed on to the customer and {{that it is difficult to}} combine an access structure for <b>working</b> on the <b>mould</b> with the enclosing structure of the temporary oven. Based on the spreadsheets developed by the author, graphs are provided as a ‘rule of thumb’ guide to power consumption and total costs for post-curing boats of various lengths. A detailed analysis of the spreadsheet results concludes that the key pointer is to find a practical way of fixing the insulation on the inside of a temporary structure in order to minimise the total mass to be heated. The report touches on the short-term nature of individual project-based yacht manufacturing and observes that it is difficult to justify long-term investment in more efficient production spaces for post-curing until tax-efficient incentives, such as capital allowances for plant & machinery can be applied to the use of temporary ovens. In the longer term, the report identifies the potential for further work on the development of a standard kit of parts for energy-efficient oven construction which could be erected and dismantled as required at minimum labour cost within a lightweight build enclosure. The incentive for this investment could be a radical shift in the real cost of energy – and a sea change in attitudes towards energy use and generation – over the next decade. Meanwhile, the boatbuilding industry appears to be on a plateau of efficiency for one-off post-cured products, based on the individual efforts of yacht manufacturers to deliver a quality product to their customers at a reasonable cost. ...|$|R
40|$|Syftet med denna uppsats är att ta reda på hur lokala kommunikationskonsulter i Falun/Borlänge-regionen ser på opinionsbildning via professionella konsulter. De centrala begrepp som avhandlas är PR, opinionsbildning och {{lobbying}}. Den teoretiska ram som omger undersökningen består av de teoribyggen som skapats av Jürgen Habermas, James E. Grunig och Larsåke Larsson. Habermas ställer sig tveksam till den demokratiska nyttan av professionell opinionsbildning, Grunig är mer positiv och Larsson ser både för- och nackdelar med PR-verksamheten. Larssons undersökning av opinionskonsulter från 2005 refereras också. Undersökningen bygger på intervjuer med ett antal kommunikationskonsulter verksamma i Falun och Borlänge. Den lokala marknaden för opinionsbildande uppdrag diskuteras, men också huruvida politiska uppdrag förser byråerna med politisk färg. Huruvida medarbetarnas engagemang är viktigt och hur hög statusen på opinionsbildande uppdrag är ventileras, samt vilka arbetsmetoder som används. Intervjuerna behandlar också förekomsten av lobbying på lokal nivå. Till slut redogör de intervjuade för sin syn på hur opinionsbildning, PR och lobbying via konsulter påverkar demokratin. Under slutsatser diskuteras resultatet i relation till den teoretiska ramen. Att PR- och reklambranscherna alltmer växer samman och att opinionsbildning är ett vanligt inslag i många projekt är ett faktum som också skymtat fram i den teoretiska ramen. Men reklam- och PR-metoder integreras också i politiken, på gott och ont. Följaktligen växer den gråzon som finns mellan de olika typerna av kommunikation och mellan opinionsbildande och icke-opinionsbildande uppdrag. Det försvårar gränsdragning och tydlighet, men skapar nya kreativa möjligheter. Att den ökade användningen av kommunikationskonsulter kanske kan bidra till en orättvis fördel för resursstarka organisationer diskuteras. Ny teknik, t. ex. Internet, kan dock eventuellt vara den motvikt som gör det möjligt även för resurssvaga grupper att höras i det offentliga samtalet. Kommunikation som maktfaktor tas även upp utifrån termer som lobbying och medias dagordningsfunktion. Några aspekter av den outnyttjade potential som PR har ventileras också. PR som metod är en outnyttjad resurs på det lokala planet, något som kan bero både på okunskap hos de lokala kunderna och ett traditionellt arbetssätt hos byråerna. Utifrån intervjusvaren framkommer att både byråerna, deras kunder och media på landsorten skulle gynnas av ett större samarbete. Resultaten av intervjuerna stöder mycket i den teoretiska ramen, medan somligt förkastas. Som sammanfattning kan sägas att opinionsbildning via konsulter kan användas för både gott och ont. Vilket som blir resultatet handlar som oftast om etik, ansvar, öppenhet och professionalitet. ABSTRACTThe primary {{target for}} this report {{is to find out}} how communication consultants in the region of Falun and Borlänge views the practice of establishing public opinions by using professional public relations consultants. The concepts in focus are PR, the moulding of public opinion and lobbying. The theoretical framework surrounding this report is the writings by Jürgen Habermas, James E. Grunig and Larsåke Larsson. Habermas has doubts as to the democratic use of professional consultants working with public opinions, Grunig has a somewhat more positive approach and Larsson sees both advantages and disadvantages in a democratic sense with the PR industry. Larssons research concerning consultants <b>working</b> with the <b>moulding</b> of public opinions from 2005 is also reviewed. The research is carried out by interviewing some communication consultants working in the Falun /Borlänge- area. The local market for commissions concerning public opinions is discussed, but also if and how political commissions are forcing a political stamp upon the firms engaging in such commissions. The importance of personal commitment in the consultants and the level of prominence commissions concerning public opinion has in the business is discussed, but also which methods is used and preferred. The interviews also deal with the practice of lobbying in the local arena. Finally the participants state their views on how the moulding of public opinion, PR and lobbying effects the democracy. Conclusively, the result is put in relation to the theories earlier mentioned. The public relations market is merging with the advertising business, that is a fact, and establishing public opinion is a common element in a lot of projects. But methods used for advertising and PR are also integrated in the political sphere, for good and bad. That has made the distinction between different kinds of communication harder, thereby enhancing the difficulties of establishing boundaries and achieving clarity. Yet {{at the same time it}} facilitates new creative opportunities. The growing use of communication consultants may contribute to unfair advantages for organisations with large economic resources. New technical development though, such as the Internet for example, may prove to simplify communication for groups with lesser economic power. Communication as an aspect of power is being discussed in terms of lobbying and the agenda setting power of media. Some aspects of the unused potential that lies within PR are also in focus in this report. PR as a method is an unused resource in the local market, which can be due to the local clients lack of knowledge but also to the traditional work carried out by the communication firms. The findings of the interviews show that both communication firms, their clients and the local media would benefit from greater cooperation. The theoretical base in this work is mostly supported by the interviews, though a few of the findings does not agree. The moulding of public opinions by professional consultants can be used for both good and bad. What the result will be is, not surprisingly, a question of ethics, responsibility, openness and professionalism...|$|R
