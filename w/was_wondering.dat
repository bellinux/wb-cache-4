500|$|Nolan first {{pitched the}} film to Warner Bros. in 2001, but then felt that he needed more {{experience}} making large-scale films, and embarked on Batman Begins and The Dark Knight. He soon realized that a film like Inception needed a large budget because [...] "as soon as you're talking about dreams, {{the potential of the}} human mind is infinite. And so the scale of the film has to feel infinite. It has to feel like you could go anywhere {{by the end of the}} film. And it has to work on a massive scale." [...] After making The Dark Knight, Nolan decided to make Inception and spent six months completing the script. Nolan states that the key to completing the script <b>was</b> <b>wondering</b> what would happen if several people shared the same dream. [...] "Once you remove the privacy, you've created an infinite number of alternative universes in which people can meaningfully interact, with validity, with weight, with dramatic consequences." ...|$|E
500|$|By 1974, Patti Smith was {{performing}} rock music, initially with guitarist, bassist and rock archivist Lenny Kaye, and {{later with a}} full band comprising Kaye, Ivan Kral on guitar and bass, Jay Dee Daugherty on drums and Richard Sohl on piano. Ivan Kral was a refugee from Czechoslovakia who {{had moved to the}} United States in 1966 with his parents, who were diplomats. After the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968, Kral decided not to return. Financed by Sam Wagstaff, the band recorded a first single, [...] "Hey Joe / Piss Factory", in 1974. The A-side was a version of the rock standard {{with the addition of a}} spoken word piece about fugitive heiress Patty Hearst ("Patty Hearst, you're standing there in front of the Symbionese Liberation Army flag with your legs spread, I <b>was</b> <b>wondering</b> were you gettin' it every night from a black revolutionary man and his women..."). A court later heard that Hearst had been confined against her will, and had been repeatedly threatened with execution and raped. The B-side describes the helpless anger Smith had felt while working on a factory assembly line and the salvation she discovered in the form of a shoplifted book, the 19th century French poet Arthur Rimbaud's Illuminations. In a 1996 interview which discusses artistic influences during her younger years, Smith said, [...] "I had devoted so much of my girlish daydreams to Rimbaud. Rimbaud was like my boyfriend." ...|$|E
500|$|Speculation ignited that Ponting was an {{outsider}} {{to be selected}} for the Australian squad on their 1993 tour to England. Of the speculation, Ponting said [...] "At {{the start of the}} season I <b>was</b> <b>wondering</b> whether or not I'd play Shield cricket this year and all of a sudden there's talk in the papers that I'm a chance go on an Australian tour of England. I think it's way out of reach — there are blokes like [...] Jamie Siddons who have scored 20 or 30 first-class centuries who are ahead of me. Nevertheless, Shipperd thought Ponting could handle the experience: [...] "A lot of attention affects different people in different ways, but Ricky is such a well-rounded young fella that it hasn't changed him. I've told him to enjoy the all the attention and if he just keeps on being himself I'm sure he'll cope well with all the success that I imagine he will achieve." [...] The selectors eventually chose Western Australian batsman Damien Martyn for the tour, with Ponting selected in the Academy squad captained by Justin Langer, which toured India and Sri Lanka for seven games in August and September in 1993. Australian success was limited, with only a few wins. No batsman scored a century, but Ponting reached 99 not out in a one-day game in Colombo. He finished the tour second highest in the run-scorers behind Langer.|$|E

500|$|Wings was an {{immediate}} success upon release and became the yardstick for which aviation films were measured against, in terms of [...] "authenticity of combat and scope of production". One {{of the reasons for}} its resounding popularity was the public infatuation with aviation in the wake of Charles Lindbergh's transatlantic flight. The Air Corps who had supervised production expressed satisfaction with the end product. The critical response was equally enthusiastic and the film was widely praised for its realism and technical prowess, despite a superficial plot, [...] "an aviation picnic" [...] as Gene Brown called it. The combat scenes of the film were so realistic that one writer studying the film in the early 1970s <b>was</b> <b>wondering</b> if Wellman had used actual imagery of planes crashing to earth during World War I. One critic observed: [...] "The exceptional quality of Wings lies in its appeal as a spectacle and as a picture of {{at least some of the}} actualities of flying under wartime conditions." [...] Another wrote: [...] "Nothing in the line of war pictures ever has packed a greater proportion of real thrills into an equal footage. As a spectacle, Wings is a technical triumph. It piles punch upon punch until the spectator is almost nervously exhausted". Mordaunt Hall of The New York Times praised the cinematography of the flying scenes and the direction and acting of the entire cast in his review dated August 13, 1927. Hall notes only two criticisms, one slight on Richard Arlen's performance and of the ending, which he described as [...] "like so many screen stories, much too sentimental, and there is far more of it than one wants." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1870 {{she founded}} the weekly Woman’s Journal, a suffragist {{magazine}} which was widely read. She contributed {{to it for}} twenty years. That same year, she wrote her [...] "Appeal to womanhood throughout the world", later known as the Mother's Day Proclamation, which asked {{women around the world}} to join for world peace. (See [...]) She authored it soon after she evolved into a pacifist and an anti-war activist. In 1872, she asked that [...] "Mother's Day" [...] be celebrated on the 2nd of June. Her efforts were not successful, and by 1893 she <b>was</b> <b>wondering</b> if the 4th of July could be remade into [...] "Mother's Day". In 1874, she edited a coeducational defense titled Sex and Education. She wrote a collection about the places she lived in 1880 called Modern Society. In 1883, Howe published a biography of Margaret Fuller. Then, in 1885 she published another collection of lectures called Is Polite Society Polite? ("Polite society" [...] is a euphemism for the upper class.) In 1899 she published her popular memoirs, Reminiscences. She continued to write until her death.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout this period, Eddington lectured on relativity, and was {{particularly}} {{well known for}} his ability to explain the concepts in lay terms as well as scientific. He collected many of these into the Mathematical Theory of Relativity in 1923, which Albert Einstein suggested was [...] "the finest presentation of the subject in any language." [...] He was an early advocate of Einstein's General Relativity, and an interesting anecdote well illustrates his humour and personal intellectual investment: Ludwik Silberstein, a physicist who thought of himself as an expert on relativity, approached Eddington at the Royal Society's (6 November) 1919 meeting where he had defended Einstein's Relativity with his Brazil-Principe Solar Eclipse calculations with some degree of skepticism, and ruefully charged Arthur as one who claimed to be one of three men who actually understood the theory (Silberstein, of course, was including himself and Einstein as the other).

2500|$|Boam, who {{was raised}} Catholic, used many {{religious}} themes and metaphors in his script for the film. In preparing the story, he studied grail literature, but ultimately invented new mythology. He made the grail a symbol for faith. He said, [...] "I guess the major given of faith is that it can't be proved otherwise you don't need faith. So that is why I created {{the idea that the}} grail can't be removed (from its hiding place). You can find the grail, but you can't really prove that you found it." [...] When Indiana Jones finally discovers the grail hidden among decoys, its knight guardian tells him that he will die if he drinks from the wrong cup. Boam said that this scene is a metaphor for [...] "the one true God vs. false gods". He worried that the film's religious themes would face criticism from the general audience, as well as religious scholars. He was relieved when the criticism didn't appear, saying, [...] "Nobody working on this movie was a religious scholar... I <b>was</b> <b>wondering</b> if the numerous allusions to Christ in Indiana Jones were going to put people off. I was afraid the kids in the audience would think it was not a very hip subject matter." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{critical}} line {{of questioning}} was conducted by Donald Sanders. Armstrong had given a copy of Buzhardt's report to Butterfield; now Sanders asked if the quotations in it might have come from notes. Butterfield said no, that the quotations were too detailed. In addition, Butterfield said that neither staff nor the president kept notes of one-on-one private meetings with Nixon. When asked where the quotations might have come from, Butterfield {{said he did not}} know. Then Sanders asked if there was any validity to John Dean's hypothesis that the White House had taped conversations in the Oval Office. Butterfield replied, [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>wondering</b> if someone would ask that. There is tape in the Oval Office." [...] Butterfield then told the investigators that, while he had hoped that no one would ask about the taping system, he had previously decided he would disclose its existence if asked a direct question. Butterfield then testified extensively about when the taping system was installed and how it worked, and told the staff members, [...] "Everything was taped ... as long as the President was in attendance. There was {{not so much as a}} hint that something should not be taped." [...] Butterfield later said that he assumed the committee knew about the taping system, since they had already interviewed Haldeman and Higby.|$|E

When {{she gave me the}} news, I was upset, I started crying. I actually thought that while I was contemplating, 'What if I'm the killer?,' that I'd be excited but I started crying and started feeling bad for Terry. 'Oh man, this is a really tragic situation.'" [...] Allman also {{spoke about the}} point in the season when she began to wonder if Terry was the killer: [...] "I'm sure everybody on the cast <b>was</b> <b>wondering</b> if they were the killer or not at some point. But there was a scene that I alluded to some things that I had questioned whether or not I was the killer. It was the scene where [...] were playing with the trunk. I come down from the apartment and I see them in the garage locked in the trunk and I got really upset at Tommy. I remember [...] really wanting me to really shake Tommy and be very upset about this. I thought, why would I be that mad at him? It could've been, this is Terry not wanting the boys to mess around because it was how Rosie died or this is a flashback for her because she was involved."

Steinberg states that Ronaldo [...] "sleepwalked" [...] through the final in what was a below par performance for the striker, which also saw him injured in a collision with French goalkeeper Fabien Barthez. Zagallo admitted the fears over Ronaldo affected his team psychologically, and stated [...] "for the whole of the first half I <b>was</b> <b>wondering</b> whether to take him off", but feared a public outcry in Brazil had he done so. Brazil lost the match to hosts France 3–0. Ronaldo later reflected: [...] "We lost the World Cup but I won another cup - my life." [...] An inquest was launched in Brazil, with team doctor Lídio Toledo telling the commission [...] "imagine if I stopped Ronaldo playing and Brazil lost.
