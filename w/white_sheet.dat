5|$|According to U.S. officials, bin Laden {{was buried}} at sea because no country would accept his remains. Before {{disposing}} of the body, the U.S. called the Saudi government, who approved of burying {{the body in}} the ocean. Muslim religious rites were performed aboard Carl Vinson in the North Arabian Sea within 24 hours of bin Laden's death. Preparations began at 10:10am local time and at-sea burial was completed at 11am. The body was washed, wrapped in a <b>white</b> <b>sheet</b> and placed in a weighted plastic bag. An officer read prepared religious remarks which were translated into Arabic by a native speaker. Afterward, bin Laden's body was placed onto a flat board. The board was tilted upward {{on one side and the}} body slid off into the sea.|$|E
5|$|It {{begins with}} a young girl playing in the {{backyard}} as snow falls on the ground. The scene shifts {{to that of a}} bedside, where a young woman who has died, lies. Her husband covers her with a <b>white</b> <b>sheet</b> as a priest prays. Madonna, wearing a long, black coat, sings the song underneath a snow-covered, dead tree, as the young girl plays with her dead mother's jewelry. The husband comes and shouts at the girl, tearing away the woman's pearl necklace which drop at the little girl's feet. The adult Madonna is shown lying beside another man singing the song as the little girl visits her mother's grave. The man gets up and slaps Madonna in the face, as the little girl cries in front of the grave. She is taken away from the graveyard by her father, as interspersed scenes show the girl being kissed by her mother, her trying to reach the knob of a door, and Madonna powdering the bruise mark on her face.|$|E
5|$|The Mari Lwyd itself {{consists}} of a horse's skull that is decorated with ribbons and affixed to a pole; {{to the back of}} the skull is attached a <b>white</b> <b>sheet,</b> which drapes down to conceal both the pole and the individual carrying this device. On occasion, the horse's head was represented not by a skull but was instead made from wood or even paper. In some instances, the horse's jaw was able to open and close as a result of string or lever attached to it, and there are accounts of pieces of glass being affixed into the eye sockets of some examples, representing eyes. An observer of the tradition as it was performed at Llangynwyd during the nineteenth century noted that preparation for the activity was a communal event, with many locals involving themselves in the decorating of the Mari Lwyd.|$|E

Ever since then Latvian tribes have used these colours.|$|E

25|$|The border {{station at}} Holmec was the {{location}} of an alleged war crime perpetrated by Slovenian TO forces, filmed by the Austrian public broadcasting station ORF. Video footage shows {{a small group of}} YPA soldiers standing or walking slowly with raised hands, holding up a <b>white</b> <b>sheet</b> in an apparent attempt to surrender. Moments later, gunfire is heard and the soldiers fall or jump to the ground. Neither the origin of the gunfire nor its exact effect are clearly visible on the video segment. Slovene officials maintain that the YPA soldiers jumped for cover and were not hit, and that the matter was thoroughly investigated years ago. However, the incident sparked renewed public debate after the footage was shown on Serbian TV station B92 in 2006, with many claiming that the soldiers were shot and killed by Slovenian TO troops and that Slovenia is trying to cover up the affair.|$|E

25|$|U-570 quickly resurfaced {{and around}} 10 {{of the crew}} emerged. The Hudson fired on them with machine guns, but ceased when the U-boat crew {{displayed}} a <b>white</b> <b>sheet.</b> The captured crewmembers later recounted to British naval intelligence interrogators what had happened—the depth charge explosions had almost rolled the boat over, knocked out all electrical power, smashed instruments, caused water leaks, and contaminated the air on the boat. The inexperienced crew believed the contamination to be chlorine, caused by acid from leaking battery cells mixing with sea-water, and the engine-compartment crew panicked and fled forward to escape the gas. Restoring electrical power—for the underwater electric motors and for lighting—would have been straightforward, yet there was nobody remaining in the engine compartment to do this. The submarine was {{dead in the water}} and in darkness. Rahmlow believed the chlorine would make it fatal to stay submerged so he resurfaced. The sea was too rough for the crew to man their anti-aircraft gun so they displayed a white flag to forestall another, probably fatal, depth charge attack from the Hudson—they were unaware the aircraft had dropped all its depth charges.|$|E
25|$|A major {{controversy}} over the August 4 agreement erupted the day after it was signed. An African American sheet metal worker, Gilbert Foster, began work, which led to rumors that white workers would strike in protest. Despite an emergency meeting by federal and city officials with leaders of Sheet Metal Workers Local 65, 14 <b>white</b> <b>sheet</b> metal workers walked off the job on August 6. The workers argued that Foster was not a union-accredited sheet metal worker, and that union rules required him to work for at least seven days to prove his skills. Paul Ristau, business agent for Local 65, agreed that Foster had not yet become a union member, but said his application was being processed. The UFM threatened to picket if Foster was not employed, so A. Nabakowski Co., the sheet metal contractor, offered to keep Foster {{on the job and}} pay him if he reported to work. The following day, Nabakowski paid Foster to sit in a trailer. Local 65 ordered its men back to work, and 11 of them did so (under protest) on August 7. Foster himself agreed to perform whatever non-work, makework, or sheet metal work the company wanted, which short-circuited the UFM's demand that he work solely on sheet metal projects.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of July 20, two 75mm guns {{commanded}} by a retired artillery officer Captain Orad de la Torre, plus one 155mm gun joined the siege. Also, a Breguet XIX warplane from the Cuatro Vientos air base bombed the barracks. At half past ten, one bomb wounded Fanjul and Sierra. A few moments later some soldiers inside the barracks waved a <b>white</b> <b>sheet</b> from the windows apparently {{with the intention of}} surrendering. Against the orders of Lieutenant Moreno of the Assault Guards, who were leading the attack, the crowd ran forward but other defenders fired at them from the barracks with machine guns. This happened twice, killing or wounding numbers of people. Around noon, the crowd maddened by these incidents broke through the main gate. Some surrendering defenders were massacred by the crowd in the main courtyard, several being thrown from an upper gallery. Photographs show the courtyard littered with uniformed bodies. Captain Orad de la Torre and Arturo Barea both reported seeing a number of rebel officers who had gathered in a mess room and then shot themselves. At least some of the Falangist and monarchist volunteers wearing civilian clothes were able to slip away in the confusion.|$|E

500|$|The {{marriage}} did {{not begin}} well. Quiney had recently impregnated another woman, Margaret Wheeler, who died in childbirth along with her child; both were buried on 15March 1616. [...] A few days later, on the 26March, Quiney appeared before the Bawdy Court, which dealt, among other things, with [...] "whoredom and uncleanliness." [...] Confessing in open court to [...] "carnal copulation" [...] with Margaret Wheeler, he submitted himself for correction {{and was sentenced to}} open penance [...] "in a <b>white</b> <b>sheet</b> (according to custom)" [...] before the [...] on three Sundays. He also had to admit to his crime, this time wearing ordinary clothes, before the Minister of Bishopton in Warwickshire. The first part of the sentence was remitted, essentially letting him off with a five-shilling fine to be given to the parish's poor. As Bishopton had no church, but only a chapel, he was spared any public humiliation.|$|E

The official artwork for [...] "Applause" [...] was debuted on Women's Wear Dailys website on July 29, 2013. The cover features Gaga's face smeared with multi-colored paint and surrounded by a <b>white</b> <b>sheet.</b> Gaga explained that she chose the smeared makeup look for the cover to symbolize the moment {{at the end of a}} show when the performer is vulnerable and longing for the audience's approval. The artwork was compared to the cover of David Bowie's 1980 album Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps).|$|E
500|$|After the {{bombardment}} had lasted 75 minutes, Tilghman surrendered to Foote's fleet, which had closed to within [...] for a close-range bombardment. Before the battle, Tilghman told his men {{that he would}} offer an hour of resistance to allow his men additional time to escape. With only one cannon still working, {{down to the last}} few rounds due to the powder magazine being underwater, {{and the rest of the}} guns destroyed or knocked out, Tilghman ordered the Confederate flag at Fort Henry lowered and a <b>white</b> <b>sheet</b> raised on the fort's flagpole. Upon seeing the white flag, the Union gunboats immediately ceased fire. A small launch from the flotilla sailed through the sally port of the fort and picked up Tilghman for the surrender conference and ceremony on Cincinnati. Twelve officers and 82 men of the garrison surrendered; other casualties from the fort's garrison were estimated to be 15 men killed and 20 wounded. The evacuating Confederate force left all of its artillery and equipment behind. Tilghman was imprisoned, but exchanged on August 15.|$|E

It was Flash Gordon that would outlast the others, quickly [...] "develop an audience far surpassing" [...] that of Buck Rogers. Flash Gordon, wrote Stephen Becker, [...] "was wittier and moved faster," [...] so [...] "Buck's position as America's favorite sci-fi hero", wrote historian Bill Crouch, Jr., [...] "went down in flames to the artistic lash and spectacle of Alex Raymond's virtuoso artwork." [...] Alex Raymond has stated, [...] "I decided honestly that comic art is an art form in itself. It reflects the life and times more accurately and actually is more artistic than magazine illustration—since it is entirely creative. An illustrator works with camera and models; a comic artist begins with a <b>white</b> <b>sheet</b> of paper and dreams up his own business—he is playwright, director, editor and artist at once." [...] A. E. Mendez has also stated that [...] "Raymond’s achievements are chopped into bite-sized pieces by the comic art cognoscenti. Lost in the worthwhile effort to distinguish comics as an art form, the romance, sweep and beauty of Raymond's draftsmanship, his incomparable line work, is dismissed. To many, it's just pretty pictures. Somehow or another, it's OK for people like Caniff and Eisner to borrow from film. That’s real storytelling. But for Raymond to study illustrators, well, that's just not comics." ...|$|E
2500|$|Though officially {{adopted in}} 1923, the Latvian flag was in use {{as early as}} the 13th century. [...] The red colour is {{sometimes}} described as symbolizing the readiness of the Latvians to give the blood from their hearts for freedom and their willingness to defend their liberty. An alternative interpretation, according to one legend, is that a Latvian leader was wounded in battle, and the edges of the <b>white</b> <b>sheet</b> in which he was wrapped were stained by his blood. The white stripe may stand for the sheet that wrapped him. This story is similar to the legend of the origins of the flag of Austria.|$|E
