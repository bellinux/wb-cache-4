5|$|It {{is not yet}} {{known what}} {{specific}} agent in the body brings about the allergic reaction to the radiation. <b>When</b> <b>patients</b> with SU were injected with an irradiated autologous serum, many developed urticaria within the area of injection. When {{people who did not}} have SU were injected, they did not demonstrate similar symptoms. This indicates that the reaction is only a characteristic of the patients with solar urticaria and that it is not phototoxic. It is possible that this photoallergen is located on the binding sites of IgE that are found on the surface of mast cells. The photoallergen is believed to begin its configuration through the absorption of radiation by a chromophore. The molecule, because of the radiation, is transformed resulting in the formation of a new photoallergen.|$|E
5|$|Registered Nurses: Registered {{nurses are}} {{responsible}} for coordinating {{all aspects of the}} patient's care and insuring symptoms (physical or otherwise) are being addressed and managed. The primary care nurse visits a minimum of twice weekly, and the content of the visit can vary greatly. <b>When</b> <b>patients</b> are experiencing few symptoms and/or are early in their diseases, the RN visit may just be a short check up. If a patient's symptoms worsen, the nurse will visit more often, make recommendations for increasing or changing the medication intervention and provide support and education regarding the disease/dying process. Many patients on hospice may require complex treatments: respiratory care, wound care or even IV therapy at home. In most cases, the hospice nurse is trained to handle these unique needs as well.|$|E
