40|$|Screen {{material}} {{in the form of}} welded wire mesh and geogrids are used in underground coal mines to prevent the fall of small pieces of rock from the roof between roof bolts. Further, if the screen is installed during the production cycle, roof fall injuries can be reduced significantly. Therefore, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), because of the safety implications, conducted an evaluation of screen materials commonly used in U. S. coal mines to determine their support characteristics and identify the parameters that could affect their performance with respect to controlling the fall of rock from the roof surface. To evaluate the load and stiffness characteristics of the screen, a test frame was designed and installed in the Mine Roof Simulator (MRS) at the NIOSH Pittsburgh Research Laboratory (PRL). With this test set up, the screen is bolted at four corners of the frame and a center load is applied. The test set up allows for up to 20 in of screen deflection while the load and screen defection are continuously recorded. A series of tests were conducted to evaluate the effects of various parameters such as bolt tension, the type of load bearing surface and the size of bearing plates on <b>welded</b> <b>screen</b> performance. The most common screen material used in U. S. coal mines is an 8 -gauge wire welded in a 4 -by- 4 -in spacing or aperture. The peak screen load was normally limited by wire breakage. The conditions at the bearing plate influence the nature of the wire breakage. However, the screen stiffness was controlled by slippage at the bearing plates, and by weld and wire failure. The size of the bearing plate had a significant effect on the performance of the <b>welded</b> <b>screen.</b> Therefore, the design capacity of the 8 -gauge screen is evaluated based on plate size. For a 6 -by- 6 -in bearing plate the average peak load is 2, 900 lb with a stiffness of 250 lb/in. For an 8 -by- 8 -in bearing plate, the average peak load is 4, 500 lb with a stiffness of 430 lb/in. These test results are based on a 4 -by- 4 -ft bolt spacing. A geogrid mesh was also tested...|$|R

At first chain-link fence was used, {{but because it was}} so difficult to handle, the miners started installing a more rigid <b>welded</b> wire <b>screen</b> used in the concrete industry. Eventually coal mines in the west began to use screen, and now more and more coal operations, especially longwall mines, are installing roof screen on a regular basis. Screen use has recently increased in the Illinois basin and is now making its way to underground coal mines in the eastern U. S...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{sources and}} types of corrosion processes of boiler tube system of the Thermal Power Plant "Ugljevik". The main goal in the electric power production is to achieve lower prices, {{which can only be}} done by providing low maintenance costs. While {{it is not possible to}} completely stop corrosion, it could be slowed down and it's effects could be reduced. In order to reduce corrosion to a minimum on thermal power plants' vital equipment, particularly boilers, it is necessary to determine in each particular case the acting mechanism of corrosion and agents that cause it. Damages and failures on thermal power plants are largely caused by the development of various types of corrosion processes. Special attention is given to the preparation of water, considering its importance to the occurrence of corrosion. The following types of corrosion were detected on the screen tube boiler by visual examination on the side of water and steam: erosive, pitting and impact corrosion. The inner surface of screen pipes, from which the scale layer was removed, indicates that the erosive corrosion with the thinning of pipe walls occurs. Perforation of the <b>welded</b> <b>screen</b> pipes shows that stress corrosion occurred on the screen pipe with formation of cracks and that pipe exploded. Pits on the inner surface of the screen pipes, visible after the removal of scale and corrosion products, are proof that pitting corrosion occurred. The causes of corrosion were discovered and proposed measures for their elimination were given...|$|R
