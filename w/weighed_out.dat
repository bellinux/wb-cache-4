500|$|Once extracted, {{the gold}} itself took many paths. First, {{much of the}} gold was used locally to {{purchase}} food, supplies and lodging for the miners. It also went towards entertainment, which consisted of anything from a traveling theater to alcohol, gambling, and prostitutes. These transactions often took place using the recently recovered gold, carefully <b>weighed</b> <b>out.</b> [...] These merchants and vendors in turn used the gold to purchase supplies from ship captains or packers bringing goods to California.|$|E
500|$|At that time, no {{one else}} in the world of physics had noticed what Curie {{recorded}} in a sentence of her paper, describing how much greater were the activities of pitchblende and chalcolite than uranium itself: [...] "The fact is very remarkable, and leads to the belief that these minerals may contain an element which is much more active than uranium." [...] She later would recall how she felt [...] "a passionate desire to verify this hypothesis as rapidly as possible." [...] On 14 April 1898, the Curies optimistically <b>weighed</b> <b>out</b> a 100-gram sample of pitchblende and ground it with a pestle and mortar. They did not realize at the time that what they were searching for was present in such minute quantities that they would eventually have to process tons of the ore.|$|E
2500|$|To produce pu'er, many {{additional}} {{steps are}} needed {{prior to the}} actual pressing of the tea. First, a specific quantity of dry máochá or ripened tea leaves pertaining to the final weight of the bingcha is <b>weighed</b> <b>out.</b> The dry tea is then lightly steamed in perforated cans to soften {{and make it more}} tacky. This will allow it to hold together and not crumble during compression. A ticket, called a [...] "nèi fēi" [...] (...) or additional adornments, such as colored ribbons, are placed on or {{in the midst of the}} leaves and inverted into a cloth bag or wrapped in cloth. The pouch of tea is gathered inside the cloth bag and wrung into a ball, with the extra cloth tied or coiled around itself. This coil or knot is what produces the dimpled indentation at the reverse side of a tea cake when pressed. Depending on the shape of the pu'er being produced, a cotton bag may or may not be used. For instance, brick or square teas often are not compressed using bags.|$|E

60|$|Dick Barnes obeyed reluctantly, and {{the usual}} small {{allowance}} of salt junk was <b>weighed</b> <b>out,</b> {{but there were no}} eager glances now. Most of the crew refused to touch food--one or two tried to eat a morsel of biscuit without success.|$|E
60|$|And the woman, {{leaning against}} the bunk, raging and impotent, watched herself <b>weighed</b> <b>out</b> in yellow dust and nuggets in the scales erected on the grub-box. The scales were small, making {{necessary}} many weighings, and Messner with precise care verified each weighing.|$|E

60|$|The second {{event of}} moment {{occurred}} in the afternoon, when Siskiyou Pearly ran his boat into the bank and tied up. He was fresh from the Outside, and had in his possession a four-months-old newspaper. Furthermore, he had half a dozen barrels of whisky, all consigned to Curly Jim. The men of Red Cow quit work. They sampled the whisky—at a dollar a drink, <b>weighed</b> <b>out</b> on Curly’s scales; and they discussed the news. And all would have been well, had not Curly Jim conceived a nefarious scheme, which was, namely, first to get Marcus O’Brien drunk, and next, to buy his mine from him.|$|E
60|$|In Alaska, at that time, {{there were}} no rascals and no tin-horn gamblers. Games were {{conducted}} honestly, and men trusted one another. A man's word {{was as good as}} his gold in the blower. A marker was a flat, oblong composition chip worth, perhaps, a cent. But when a man betted a marker in a game and said it was worth five hundred dollars, it was accepted as worth five hundred dollars. Whoever won it knew that the man who issued it would redeem it with five hundred dollars' worth of dust <b>weighed</b> <b>out</b> on the scales. The markers being of different colors, there was no difficulty in identifying the owners. Also, in that early Yukon day, no one dreamed of playing table-stakes. A man was good in a game for all that he possessed, no matter where his possessions were or what was their nature.|$|E
60|$|Fisc. Yet our {{observations}} {{of them in}} Holland are not much unlike it. I've known a great Don at the Hague, with the gentleman of his horse, his major domo, and two secretaries, all dine at four tables, on the quarters of a single pullet: The victuals of the under servants were <b>weighed</b> <b>out</b> in ounces, by the Don himself; with so much garlic in the other scale: A thin slice of bacon went through the family a week together; for it was daily put into the pot for pottage; was served {{in the midst of}} the dish at dinners, and taken out and weighed by the steward, at the end of every meal, to see how much it lost; till, at length, looking at it against the sun, it appeared transparent, and then he would have whipped it up, as his own fees, at a morsel; but that his lord barred the dice, and reckoned it to him for a part of his board wages.|$|E
6000|$|... "Fetch me the scales; now then, doctor, hold 'em," [...] {{said the}} captain, {{carefully}} <b>weighing</b> <b>out</b> {{a portion of}} biscuit and meat which he handed {{to one of the}} men.

50|$|Japanese {{television}} {{took great}} interest in the race with Tsuyoshi Tanaka being the first, and so far only, Japanese rider to <b>weigh</b> <b>out</b> for a Grand National.
