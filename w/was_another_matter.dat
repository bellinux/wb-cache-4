5|$|The English {{common law}} {{position}} that a public body cannot fetter its discretion by abdicating its responsibility and powers to another was discussed and adopted in Lines International. The general rules that Justice Prakash enunciated {{in the case}} are that, first, a public body has the duty to exercise discretion by itself; it cannot abdicate this responsibility by taking orders from other bodies unless it is under a legal duty to do so. Therefore, a condition in its policy {{that appeared to be}} a direction by the PSA to itself to take orders from either the Gambling Suppression Branch ("GSB") of the Singapore Police Force or STPB to deny berths to cruise vessels was a fetter on PSA's exercise of discretion and was held to be invalid. However, the invalid condition alone did not mean that the PSA had in fact fettered its discretion. The High Court stated that while the PSA had agreed to take orders from the GSB and STPB {{on the basis of the}} invalid condition, whether it had in fact done so <b>was</b> <b>another</b> <b>matter.</b> On the evidence, the Court went on to find that the PSA had in fact made its own decision in the matter.|$|E
5|$|The {{pattern of}} failure in Test matches but success {{elsewhere}} continued during the 1934–35 {{tour of the}} West Indies. In all first-class cricket he scored 789 runs, averaging 56.35, with an innings of 281 not out the highest of his three centuries. The four-Test series, which England lost 2–1, <b>was</b> <b>another</b> <b>matter.</b> Wisden noted that the West Indian pace attack, considered {{the best in the}} world by Bob Wyatt, unsettled the English batsmen; the home bowlers were accused of intimidation by some of the England side. Hammond had a top score of 47 and scored 175 runs at an average of 25.00. He played well in difficult batting conditions, which he believed were among the worst he ever faced, in the first Test. In the first innings he scored 43, before dominating the bowlers at a critical time in his unbeaten 29 in the second innings, winning the match with a six.|$|E
5|$|For Operation Barbarossa, the 3rd Panzer Division was {{assigned}} to the XXIV Panzer Corps, itself part of the Second Panzer Group, commanded by Heinz Guderian. The campaign opened on 22 June 1941, with Guderian urging his divisions forward at breakneck speed. This suited Model, and by 4 July, his advance elements leading the panzer group's charge had reached the Dnieper, an exploit that earned him the Knight's Cross. Crossing it in strength <b>was</b> <b>another</b> <b>matter,</b> however, as the Red Army was prepared to defend the river line. 3rd Panzer's vanguard was thrown back by the Soviet 21st Army, and it was not until 10 July that the Germans were in a position to force a crossing. For this operation, Model, now reinforced with additional troops, reorganized his command into three groups: an infantry-heavy force that would cross the river and establish a bridgehead, a mobile armoured group that would pass through the bridgehead and continue the advance, and a fire support group containing nearly all his artillery. The plan worked so successfully that the river crossing cost scarcely any casualties. There followed two weeks of hard fighting to defend the panzer group's flank, during which he {{was assigned}} the 1st Cavalry Division in addition to 3rd Panzer as Gruppe Model, who then attacked to break up Soviet forces massing near Roslavl.|$|E

25|$|The February Revolution of 1917 which overthrew the Tsarist regime came {{comparatively}} easily.

25|$|Augustine {{was from}} the {{beginning}} a brilliant student, with an eager intellectual curiosity, but he never mastered Greek—he tells us that his first Greek teacher was a brutal man who constantly beat his students, and Augustine rebelled and refused to study. By the time {{he realized that he}} needed to know Greek, it was too late; and although he acquired a smattering of the language, he was never eloquent with it. However, his mastery of Latin <b>was</b> <b>another</b> <b>matter.</b> He became an expert both in the eloquent use of the language and in the use of clever arguments to make his points.|$|E
25|$|McNutt {{also took}} up the cause of welfare reform <b>was</b> <b>another</b> <b>matter</b> of {{interest}} to McNutt. The new welfare laws passed effectively made charitable giving by the government an entirely state level controlled operation. Previously, local governments had {{been in charge of}} identifying needs and carrying out relief. McNutt began his term with the support of several key labor groups, but soon lost that support. Although McNutt's administration curtailed the use of court injunctions to prevent labor picketing, McNutt did not hesitate to declare martial law in eleven coal-mining counties where major violence accompanied union efforts to organize the miners. In all, McNutt called out the Indiana National Guard three times in response to labor-related violence.|$|E

"Everyone agreed {{he had the}} look," [...] Lydon later recalled, but musical skill <b>was</b> <b>another</b> <b>matter.</b> [...] "The first rehearsals...in March of 1977 with Sid were hellish....

Marco Pirroni, who had {{performed}} with Vicious in Siouxsie and the Banshees, has said, [...] "After that, it {{was nothing to do}} with music anymore. It would just be for the sensationalism and scandal of it all. Then it became the Malcolm McLaren story".|$|E
500|$|Parsons {{returned}} to Dahlgren [...] in March 1943. Around this time, a research laboratory was established at Los Alamos, New Mexico {{under the direction}} of J. Robert Oppenheimer as Project Y, which was part of the Manhattan Project, the top-secret effort to develop an atomic bomb. The creation of a practical weapon would necessarily require an expert in ordnance, and Oppenheimer tentatively pencilled in Tolman for the role, but getting him released from OSRD <b>was</b> <b>another</b> <b>matter.</b> Until then, Oppenheimer had to do the job himself. In May 1943, the Manhattan Project's director, Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves, took up the matter with the Military Policy Committee, the high-level committee that oversaw the Manhattan Project. It consisted of Vannevar Bush as its chairman, [...] Brigadier General Wilhelm D. Styer who represented the Army, and Rear Admiral William R. Purnell as the Navy's representative.|$|E
500|$|Hilde's look {{derived from}} the {{development}} team's desire to make a fully clothed [...] "sexy" [...] female character for Soulcalibur IV, and encasing her in armor as a result. Her characteristics and personality were developed after deciding what weapons she would use, a spear and short sword. While fully armored, they endeavored to keep her appearing feminine, shaping {{the appearance of the}} armor thus and giving [...] "peeks" [...] of her figure beneath it. When it was pointed out to lead animator Yusuke Shibata that her short sword and related attacks appeared to display her femininity, he agreed, though added that her spear <b>was</b> <b>another</b> <b>matter</b> entirely. After developing her appearance and character model, her backstory was developed by a team led by Yoshihiro Nakagawa, and during this process they worked out how to tie Hilde into the plot of the series. In interviews, Soulcalibur IV director Katsutoshi Sasaki has called Hilde [...] "the 'most alluring'" [...] female character in the title, designed as an opposite to characters such as Ivy and characters that [...] "always have their boobs popping out". He added that he felt that as gaming became more accepted, characters similar to Hilde would become more common.|$|E

500|$|Savige {{arrived in}} Australia on 5January 1942 {{to find that}} his new {{appointment}} had been changed to commander of the 3rdDivision, and {{he was promoted to}} the rank of major general two days later. The outbreak of war with Japan prompted a wholesale reorganisation of the forces in Australia and Savige was {{one of a number of}} officers with experience in the Middle East who was promoted and given command of a Home Army formation. Savige threw himself into the task of preparing his command for the war, weeding out the physically unfit and incompetent. By May, he had removed some 60officers. Replacing them <b>was</b> <b>another</b> <b>matter.</b> The division was at less than half strength when Savige assumed command and was filled with large numbers of 18-year-old conscripts. One new arrival was especially welcome: Lieutenant Colonel John Wilton, who was posted as General Service Officer, First Grade (GSO1) in August. Savige later recalled that [...] "I never had a more competent staff, nor such a co-operative team, than that staff after Wilton came along." [...] The 3rdDivision moved to southern Queensland in July, where it came under Lieutenant General Edmund Herring's IICorps. In October, Herring succeeded Rowell as commander of New Guinea Force, and Savige became acting corps commander. With his attention focused on the corps, Savige relied on Wilton to supervise the training of the 3rd Division.|$|E

2500|$|Chances {{are that}} Glazunov treated Stravinsky with reserve, {{certainly}} not with open rudeness. His opinion of Stravinsky's {{music in the}} presence of others <b>was</b> <b>another</b> <b>matter.</b> At the performance of [...] (Fireworks), he reportedly made the comment, [...] "Kein talent, nur Dissonanz" [...] ("no talent, just dissonance"). (Also in the audience was Sergei Diaghilev, who on the strength of this music sought out the young composer for the Ballets Russes.) Glazunov eventually considered Stravinsky merely an expert orchestrator. In 1912 he told Vladimir Telyakovsky, [...] "Petrushka is not music, but is excellently and skillfully orchestrated." ...|$|E
2500|$|In March Rundstedt left Paris {{to set up}} Army Group South's {{headquarters}} in Breslau. On the way he attended a conference in Berlin at which Hitler addressed senior officers. He {{made it clear that}} the ordinary rules of warfare would not apply to the Russian campaign. [...] "This is a war of extermination," [...] he told them. [...] "We do not wage war to preserve the enemy." [...] This gave the generals a clear warning that they would be expected not to obstruct Hitler's wider war aims in the east – the extermination of the Jews and the reduction of the Slavic peoples to serfdom under a new Herrenvolk (Master race) of German settlers. As part of this strategy, the Commissar Order was issued, which stated that all Red Army commissars were to be executed when captured. Rundstedt testified at Nuremberg about the attitude of the Army to this Order: [...] "Our attitude was unanimously and absolutely against it. Immediately after the conference we approached Brauchitsch and told him that this was impossible... The order was simply not carried out." [...] This latter statement was clearly untrue, as the Commissar Order was widely carried out. But whether Rundstedt knew this <b>was</b> <b>another</b> <b>matter,</b> and this question was later to figure prominently in the issue of whether to charge him with war crimes.|$|E
