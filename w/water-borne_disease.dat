5|$|On December18, 1998, the United Nations {{launched}} a large-scale rehabilitation effort in Cuba. Roughly $14million {{was spent on}} housing and infrastructure reconstruction and repair; {{this portion of the}} project consisted of reconstruction of homes, schools, businesses, hospitals, irrigation and the water system. Another $1.1million was used to inform and protect residents against post-storm diseases. The largest part of the effort involved jump-starting agriculture and fisheries. Roughly $50.4million was provided to reconstruct fishing vessels, purchase new tools and gear. By mid-February 1999, the Governments of Italy, Germany, Canada and the European Union provided $1million, $714,000, $50,000, and $510,200 in funds respectively. The Government of Israel also supplied agricultural tools. The Government of Norway provided $29,100 in <b>water-borne</b> <b>disease</b> prevention funds. Through various agencies, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs provided Cuba with roughly $86million in disaster funding.|$|E

40|$|Water {{satisfies}} {{human needs}} in many ways. Without water {{human being is}} not possible in this planet. According to the estimation of the WHO, 4, 000 children die every day from <b>water-borne</b> <b>diseases</b> and this condition is worst in developing and under-developed countries. <b>Water-borne</b> <b>diseases</b> are caused by the consumption of contaminated water {{and it is a}} main agent to transfer the pathogens to cause these diseases. The main objective is ‘to identify the <b>water-borne</b> <b>diseases</b> and their challenges and to suggest remedial measures to overcome the challenges in the study area’. Both primary and secondary data were used to conduct this study and the analysis of this study tabulated clearly in the data analysis part. The coastal areas of Ampara District (Sainthamaruthu, Karaitivu, Maligaikadu Mawadipalli, Akkaraipattu, Irakkamam, varipathanchenai, Addalaichenai, Palamunai, Oluvil and Nintavur) face a lot of challenges by the <b>water-borne</b> <b>diseases.</b> The viruses, bacteria, parasites, and protozoa are the main pathogens to cause these diseases. Bacillary dysentery (shigellosis), cholera, other diarrheal diseases, hepatitis A and E and typhoid fever were mainly identified diseases in these areas. The causes for the diseases are the contamination of water by improper drainage management, adding effluents with the water source, over population and the deficiency of the awareness among residents about <b>water-borne</b> <b>diseases.</b> According to the result of this study, many suggestions such as controlling the water contamination, forming water purification system, mending the drainage system, following the instructions when constructing the latrines, examine the contaminated wells and providing awareness among residents were suggested to attain the objectives...|$|R

40|$|Background:Almost {{one third}} of the global {{population}} is living in developing South Asia where disease occurrence is high especially in rural areas and people are unaware of <b>water-borne</b> <b>diseases</b> and cost of illness. Methods:The quantitative approach involved questionnaire based study (n= 50 households). The community awareness,the occurrence of <b>water-borne</b> <b>diseases</b> with related cost of illness and community participation for the introduction of health interventions for <b>water-borne</b> <b>diseases</b> were evaluated through cross-tabulations, correlations,and ANOVA. Results:Majority (40 %) of the community had no knowledge of <b>water-borne</b> <b>diseases</b> except some had little knowledge of diarrhea and typhoid.   Diarrhea followed by stomach diseases was widespread in the community. Population below poverty level was bearing the cost of illness around US$ 0. 6 - 1. 2 (Rs 50 - 100) per day followed by low and average income level with direct cost of US$ 2. 3 (Rs 200) per day. The indirect cost of illness had showed increasing trend between US$ 2. 3 - 4. 7 (Rs 200 - 400) per day with increase in income levels. Maximum willingness to pay (WTP) for water supply and sewerage system was US$ 3. 6 (Rs 300) and US$ 1. 2 (Rs 100) per month respectively. Income and water supply demand was strongly correlated with acceptability to pay for the facilities (r = 0. 319, 0. 307;P< 0. 05). Income had a strong influence on WTP for water and sewerage system (r = 0. 805, 0. 797; P< 0. 05).
