3000|$|Figure 3 (d) {{shows the}} average water table height, h(t), {{from the ground}} surface level, zs; {{estimated}} from the water level variations of four shallow wells within 50 m of the gravity observatory. After 2 October, 2008, (solid line), the water height was measured with newly-installed <b>water</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>gauges</b> (Mini Diver DI- 501; Schlumberger Ltd.), since the original data taken by floating water gauges (gray line) was often saturated when the change in water level exceeded the wire length between the float and pulley (as seen between June and July, 2008). The water table is located {{at a depth of}} 0.5 – 3 m below the ground surface, and rose steeply at precipitation events in synchronization with soil moisture increases. After precipitation events the water table reduced at an almost linear rate, because the unconfined ground-water was regularly pumped for domestic and agricultural use at Isawa Fan, and the groundwater flowed out eastward to the edge of Isawa Fan. (Water electrical conductivity at Suginodo Spring (circle in Fig. 1) is 220 µS/cm, about four times larger than that at Mizusawa wells (∼ 50 µS/cm), showing that the groundwater flows eastward at Isawa Fan under conditions of domestic and agricultural water pollution.)

40|$|Measuring the {{interstitial}} <b>water</b> <b>pressure</b> {{of debris}} flows {{under various conditions}} gives essential information on the flow stress structure. This study measured the basal interstitial <b>water</b> <b>pressure</b> during debris flow routing experiments in a laboratory flume. Because a sensitive <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge</b> is required to measure the interstitial <b>water</b> <b>pressure</b> in shallow laboratory debris flows, a differential gas <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge</b> with an attached diaphragm was used. Although this system required calibration before and after each experiment, it showed a linear behavior and a sufficiently high temporal resolution for measuring the interstitial <b>water</b> <b>pressure</b> of debris flows. The values of the interstitial <b>water</b> <b>pressure</b> were low. However, an excess of pressure beyond the hydrostatic pressure was observed with increasing sediment particle size. The measured excess pressure corresponded to the theoretical excess interstitial <b>water</b> <b>pressure,</b> derived as a Reynolds stress in the interstitial water of boulder debris flows. Turbulence was thought to induce a strong shear in the interstitial space of sediment particles. The interstitial <b>water</b> <b>pressure</b> in boulder debris flows should {{be affected by the}} fine sediment concentration and the phase transition from laminar to turbulent debris flow; this should be the subject of future studies...|$|R

With the technology that we have today, this problem can be solved easily. In most cases this problems are solved by using pumps. This project describes a new design of a <b>water</b> <b>pressure</b> increasing device {{for the use of}} the end user. The device enables the <b>water</b> <b>pressure</b> to be increased during low <b>water</b> <b>pressure</b> condition. This project also focuses on the water transmission aspects such as the pipe design and size that is used for the water distribution system. This project uses a basic vacuum concept in science; creating a low <b>water</b> <b>pressure</b> area which will suck the water. An air compressor is used in this project to give a force to push the water in order to increase the water flow. As to connect between the pipeline transmission and the air compressor, the designs of the Y junction pipe involved. The Y junction pipe is designed with variable diameter of pipe size to see the effect in flow rate and <b>pressure</b> of the <b>water.</b> Flow meter and <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge</b> were been deployed in this project to measure the value of the flow rate and <b>pressure</b> of the <b>water</b> as the Y junction pipe is connected to the water pipeline.

50|$|The {{hull of the}} airship {{comprises}} a skin made of triple-layered {{combination of}} composite materials, the skin provides considerable strength and rigidity when inflated, serving to keep in the gas, retain its unique shape, and support the four engines, fins and the flight deck that are attached directly upon it. Materials used include Vectran, Kevlar, Tedlar, Polyurethane, and Mylar; the Mylar layer, enveloped within polyurethane film layers, forms the airship's gas barrier. The Airlander 10 lacks any internal framework; weight from the payload module is distributed across every frame via cables running across and into the hull as well as internal diaphragms. According to HAV's Technical Director Mike Durham, {{the entirety of the}} airship's structural strength is derived from being inflated to just above atmospheric pressure with a 4-in. <b>water</b> <b>gauge</b> <b>pressure</b> differential (around 0.15 psi); this strength is due to the huge diameter of the vessel despite the relatively-low pressure differential.|$|R

40|$|We could {{successfully}} obtain <b>water</b> <b>pressure</b> fluctuations after {{a series}} of two off the Kii peninsula earthquakes that took place on September 5 in 2004, using two <b>pressure</b> <b>gauges</b> deployed at deep ocean-bottom off Muroto. The earthquakes caused two tsunamis in the southern coast of the southwestern Japan with maximum wave heights of 0. 9 m, and we could identify the tsunami signals from the acquired dataset ca. 20 min before the arrivals of the tsunamis to the coastline nearest to the sensors. Two earthquakes are assumed as one for a fore-shock and the other for a main-shock. Although seismological studies, without aftershock distributions, showed a lack of constraints to distinguish if the main-shock was caused by either southwest dipping fault or by the other, i. e., northeast dipping fault, we found that the difference in the pressure fluctuations for the tsunamis could attribute to the determination of the fault plane in the fault models. In this paper, we evaluate the fault geometry of the main shock by using tsunami waveforms obtained by those unique instruments in following procedure: (1) We first simulate pressure waveforms caused by earthquakes of the two fault geometries, one for southwest dipping place and the other for the northeast, at the location of the <b>pressure</b> <b>gauges,</b> and (2) we then compare the simulated results with observed waveforms. Our results demonstrate that the main-shock should be caused by a fault whose strike lies in northwest-to-southeast with a dip towards southwest direction.
