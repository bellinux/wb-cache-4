5|$|The Young Turk Revolution in 1908 {{restored}} the Ottoman constitution and parliament 30 {{years after their}} suspension by Sultan Abdülhamid II in 1878, which {{is known as the}} Second Constitutional Era, but the 1913 Ottoman coup d'état effectively put the country {{under the control of the}} Three Pashas, making sultans Mehmed V and Mehmed VI largely symbolic figureheads <b>with</b> <b>no</b> <b>real</b> political power.|$|E

5|$|A {{professional}} football career was unlikely for Willis when {{he graduated from}} Ohio State in 1945. While the exclusion of black players was not a written rule, no African-American had played in the National Football League since 1933. The gentlemen's agreement had been in effect ever since segregationist George Preston Marshall entered the league as owner of the Boston Redskins. In his physical prime but <b>with</b> <b>no</b> <b>real</b> prospect of playing professionally, Willis {{took a job as}} the head football coach at Kentucky State College in the fall of 1945. Kentucky State, an historically black school, played against other small black schools near its campus in Frankfort.|$|E

5|$|Historian Jean-Claude Willame {{argued that}} the speech {{was the result of}} Lumumba's growing {{frustration}} with the process of independence which he believed might represent a purely nominal change in government <b>with</b> <b>no</b> <b>real</b> effects. Lumumba blamed Kasa-Vubu and his colleagues for failing to publicly oppose this situation. Gender historians have therefore {{argued that the}} speech was the result of Lumumba's growing feeling of emasculation. Others have pointed to the influence of Belgian Socialist delegates and representatives of the Guinean President, Ahmed Sékou Touré, who had a strongly Marxist ideology, all of whom hoped a public and international denouncement of colonialism would help them politically.|$|E
5|$|Real {{property}} {{law in the}} English and Welsh legal system had evolved from feudalism, and was an immensely complex system understood by {{only a small number}} of lawyers. In particular peculiarities meant that land owned by beneficiaries could be sold without the agreement of all the beneficiaries involved, something partially rectified by the Settled Land Act 1882 and the Land Transfer Act 1897. Despite these statutes reform in this area was still needed, and Lord Haldane presented reform bills to parliament in 1913, 1914 and 1915 <b>with</b> <b>no</b> <b>real</b> progress thanks to the opposition of the Law Society. In March 1917 a Reconstruction Subcommittee under Sir Leslie Scott was created to consider land policy after the First World War, and Schuster (who had devilled for Scott when working as a barrister in Liverpool) was appointed as a member. The subcommittee decided that the law should be changed to merge real and personal {{property law}}, and that outdated aspects of land law such as copyholds and gavelkind should be eliminated. When Birkenhead became Lord Chancellor in 1919 he inherited the problem of English property law, and immediately instructed Schuster to prepare the department for forcing a bill through Parliament on the matter.|$|E
5|$|Yardley {{was born}} in Royston, near Barnsley, on 19 March 1915 to a family <b>with</b> <b>no</b> <b>real</b> {{background}} in cricket. He was sent to St Peter's, York, where he made a good impression as a cricketer, being in the school team for five years from 1930 and captain in his final two years. In 1933, his first season in charge, he scored 973 runs {{at an average of}} 88.45, scoring three centuries in consecutive innings. He headed the bowling averages, with 40 wickets at 11.90 runs per wicket. His form that season saw him selected for the match between Young Amateurs and Young Professionals at Lord's Cricket Ground, in which Yardley scored 189 in his first representative match, playing against his future England team-mate Denis Compton. In 1934, Yardley played in two further representative matches at Lord's, for The Rest against Lord's Schools, and for Public Schools against The Army, making 117, the first century in the fixture for Public Schools, and 63. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack later cited these successes as a demonstration of his ability to perform well on important occasions. While still at school, he {{came to the attention of}} Yorkshire County Cricket Club, playing for the Yorkshire Colts side and receiving coaching from George Hirst. He played for Yorkshire Second XI once in 1932, twice in 1933 and twice in 1934.|$|E

5000|$|I Heart California {{received}} a generally mixed reception from critics. Phillip Cosores of Consequence of Sound called the album [...] "a muddled mess of having too many cooks {{in the kitchen}} and no clear direction from a concept band <b>with</b> seemingly <b>no</b> <b>real</b> concept.

25|$|When {{poor health}} caused Samuel Huntington, to resign as President of Congress in July 1781, McKean was elected as his successor. He served from July 10, 1781, until November 4, 1781. The President of Congress was a mostly {{ceremonial}} position <b>with</b> <b>no</b> <b>real</b> authority, but the office did require McKean {{to handle a}} good deal of correspondence and sign official documents.

25|$|Before his {{accession}} to the Portuguese throne, John VI bore the titles Duke of Braganza and Duke of Beja, {{as well as}} Prince of Brazil. From 1799, he served as prince regent of Portugal (and later, from 1815, as prince regent of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves), due to the mental illness of his mother, Queen Maria I. In 1816, he succeeded his mother as monarch of the Portuguese Empire, <b>with</b> <b>no</b> <b>real</b> change in his authority, since he already possessed absolute powers as regent.|$|E
25|$|Until {{the middle}} of the 19th century, the courts applied the lex loci {{contract}}us or the law of the place where the contract was made to decide whether the given contract was valid. The apparent advantage of this approach was that the rule was easy to apply with certain and predictable outcomes. Unfortunately, it was also open to abuse, e.g. the place could be selected fraudulently to validate an otherwise invalid contract; it might lead to the application of laws <b>with</b> <b>no</b> <b>real</b> connection with the transaction itself, say, because the parties signed the agreement while on holiday; or it might have been difficult to decide where the contract was made, e.g. because it was negotiated and signed on a railway journey through several states.|$|E

25|$|In London the Pitt-dominated {{administration}} had fallen after {{just six months}} {{because of a lack}} of support in parliament. A period of political stalemate followed, <b>with</b> <b>no</b> <b>real</b> direction to the British war effort. It became apparent that the only way a serious war administration could be put together was by an alliance of leading figures. In 1757 a partnership was formed between the Duke of Newcastle and William Pitt - despite their years of enmity. Newcastle became the head of the administration as Prime Minister, with control of public finances, while Pitt became Secretary of State and de facto war minister with control of much of British military strategy. Other leading figures such as Henry Fox and the Duke of Bedford were also given positions in the administration.|$|E
25|$|According to {{theories}} of postmodernity, economic and technological conditions {{of our age}} {{have given rise to}} a decentralized, media-dominated society in which ideas are only simulacra, inter-referential representations and copies of each other <b>with</b> <b>no</b> <b>real,</b> original, stable or objective source of communication and meaning. Globalization, brought on by innovations in communication, manufacturing and transportation, is often cited as one force which has driven the decentralized modern life, creating a culturally pluralistic and interconnected global society lacking any single dominant center of political power, communication or intellectual production. The postmodernist view is that inter-subjective, not objective, knowledge will be the dominant form of discourse under such conditions and that ubiquity of dissemination fundamentally alters the relationship between reader and that which is read, between observer and the observed, between those who consume and those who produce.|$|E
25|$|In August 1609, John Smith {{was quite}} {{surprised}} to see more than 300 new settlers arrive, which did not go well for him. London was sending new settlers <b>with</b> <b>no</b> <b>real</b> planning or logistical support. Then in May 1610, Somers and Gates finally arrived with 150 people from the Sea Venture. (Bermuda, or the 'Somers Isles', had remained settled since 1609, and the Virginia Company's possession was made official in 1612 when it was added to Virginia's territory.) Gates soon {{found that there was}} not enough food to support all in the colony and decided to abandon Jamestown. As their boats were leaving the Jamestown area, they met a ship carrying the new governor, Lord De la Warr, who ordered them back to Jamestown. Somers returned to Bermuda with the Patience to gather more food for Jamestown but died there. The Patience, captained by his nephew, then sailed for England instead of Virginia.|$|E
