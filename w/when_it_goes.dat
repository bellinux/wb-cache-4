Aravind later expanded to five more cities in Tamil Nadu including Tirupur, Salem, Dindigul, Thoothukudi, Udumalaipettai and neighboring Pondicherry. Aravind is setting up a hospital in Chennai {{at a cost of}} INR 1.4 billion with a capacity to perform 60,000 surgeries a year.

25|$|Psychologist Daniel Wegner {{has argued}} that an introspection {{illusion}} contributes to belief in psychokinesis. He observes that in everyday experience, intention (such as wanting to turn on a light) is followed by action (such as flicking a light switch) in a reliable way, but the underlying neural mechanisms are outside awareness. Hence, though subjects may feel that they directly introspect their own free will, the experience of control is actually inferred from relations between the thought and the action. This theory of apparent mental causation acknowledges the influence of David Hume's view of the mind. This process for detecting when one is responsible for an action is not totally reliable, and <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> wrong there can be an illusion of control. This can happen when an external event follows, and is congruent with, a thought in someone's mind, without an actual causal link. As evidence, Wegner cites a series of experiments on magical thinking in which subjects were induced to think they had influenced external events. In one experiment, subjects watched a basketball player taking a series of free throws. When they were instructed to visualize him making his shots, they {{felt that they had}} contributed to his success. Other experiments designed to create an illusion of psychokinesis have demonstrated that this depends, to some extent, on the subject's prior belief in psychokinesis.|$|E

500|$|Other reviews {{recognized}} that the album eschewed contemporary R {{in favor of more}} experimental compositions. Pitchfork writer Carrie Battan wrote that Beyoncé was [...] "exploring sounds and ideas at the grittier margins of popular music" [...] and rejecting [...] "traditional pop structures in favor of atmosphere". Spins Anupa Mistry felt it was [...] "more textured than its predecessors in both sound and content", and applauded the singer's transition to a maturer sound of [...] "big-hook message pop, multi-directional, mood-shifting suites and delicately resonant R ballads". Noting the lack of [...] "guaranteed hits", NME believed that the [...] "low-key, moody production throws the spotlight on the words and the images brought to play" [...] and described it as her most experimental work to date. Rolling Stones pop critic Rob Sheffield found Beyoncés boldness among its best attributes, believing the album is at its [...] "strongest <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> for full-grown electro soul with an artsy boho edge". Mikael Wood of Los Angeles Times highlighted a desire to push creative boundaries among the tracks and admired [...] "how the music similarly blends the intimate and the extravagant", while Entertainment Weekly writer Nick Catucci concluded that the album was characterized by [...] "clashing impulses—between strength and escape, megapop and fresh sounds, big messages and resonant lyrics".|$|E
500|$|Davis {{received}} everyday {{playing time}} in 2012, starting at first base, at designated hitter, {{and in the}} outfield throughout the season. On May 6, in a 17-inning, 9-6 victory over the Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park, Davis went hitless in eight at bats, but ended up being the winning pitcher. His feat {{was the first of}} its kind since Rube Waddell achieved it on July 4, 1905. Davis was the designated hitter until he was pressed into service as a relief pitcher in the 16th inning after Showalter had depleted the Orioles' bullpen. He struck out two batters and did not allow a run in his two innings of mound work. He was the first position player in the American League (AL) to be the winning pitcher in a game since Rocky Colavito on August 25, 1968, and the first to pitch for the Orioles since Manny Alexander on April 19, 1996. He and losing pitcher Darnell McDonald were the first position players on opposing teams in the same contest to each work in relief since Ty Cobb and George Sisler on October 4, 1925, and the first where both earned pitching decisions since Sam Mertes and Jesse Burkett on September 28, 1902. Davis described his outing: [...] "After the first inning, I was just trying to get it over the plate, and I was like, 'This is a lot harder than it looks.' I told myself to start using my legs so I didn't blow my arm out or anything like that. But in all seriousness, to get a win like that here, to end a road trip like this, it's huge. Neither team wanted to lose today, especially <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> to extra innings. I mean, they would have pulled people out of the stands to finish that game. It's just a huge win for us." ...|$|E
500|$|Some reviewers {{had mixed}} {{feelings}} about the episode. Jane Simon of Daily Mirror said that [...] "White Bear" [...] lacked the [...] "instant emotional tug" [...] of the series opener. She commented that, {{a third of the}} way through the episode, she had lost hope that it would conclude effectively, [...] " [...] the acting was unbelievable, the script was riddled with horror-film cliches, the violence was a bit over the top [...] ", but that by the end she was positively surprised. Joyner praised it as [...] "stylistically ... breath-taking" [...] with [...] "intense action", but felt [...] "the themes come across as particularly flat" [...] and [...] "hardly original". He was disappointed until the twist, and concludes that Brooker has [...] "crafted an hour of television more bold and daring than I've seen in a long time". Jeffery said [...] "this is Black Mirror as full-blooded horror" [...] and that it never gets boring, while criticized the characters and the final sequence as [...] "a little overlong and obvious". TheWrap staff was divided; while some found it has a good social critique, others considered it to be [...] "least effective <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> for horror". Although Parker compared the first 45 minutes to [...] "a low-budget, low-quality version of 28 Days Later", full of [...] "horror movie clichés", he realised that was [...] "the whole point". He was positive to its societal criticism and wrote: [...] "So the reason it all felt like a rubbish horror movie for 45 minutes is because that's what it was, just with a real person in the centre of it." [...] It was ranked eleventh out of the thirteen episodes by Charles Bramesco of Vulture, who said its message is [...] "lost beneath a simplistic twist that pulls a switcheroo and [...] fails to do much else".|$|E

500|$|With Somerset runners-up in the English 2009 Twenty20 Cup, Trescothick and his county {{travelled}} to India {{to partake}} in the Champions League Twenty20 in October. Though both Kieswetter and Hildreth were anticipated as successes, it was Trescothick who {{was described as}} having [...] "been in sparkling form all season" [...] and began the tournament under media scrutiny given his previous difficulties playing on tour. There was much speculation regarding any [...] "recurrence of his stress-related illness that originally occurred in 2006", as {{this was to be}} his first overseas outing since an aborted attempt in 2008. Trescothick himself responded to the media by making a statement to the BBC World Service which read [...] "I know the risk and I know what happens <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> wrong. In the last couple of times I have tried to go on tour it's failed, so of course ... Let's try and break the tradition of what has happened over the last few times... I can only try. It's a big competition for the players and for the club. I have got to try and make it happen." [...] Meanwhile, Langer assured the media that Trescothick could pull out whenever he wished to. Somerset, who began the tour without Trescothick as he was arriving later than most of the squad, commenced their warm up with a victory over the Otago Volts. The opener arrived three days later, confident in his ability to complete the tour. Somerset began with a close victory against the Deccan Chargers on 10 October, winning from the last ball. Trescothick was dismissed for 14 from 12 in his first match outside England since 2006, [...] "after offering a fleeting glimpse of his talent" [...] according to ESPNcricinfo.|$|E

There are gadgets on synthesizers that enable one to become a virtuoso on the keyboard. You can play something slowly and you press a switch and it plays it back at double speed.

2500|$|Kant {{named his}} brand of {{epistemology}} [...] "Transcendental Idealism", and he first laid out these views {{in his famous}} work The Critique of Pure Reason. In it he argued that there were fundamental problems with both rationalist and empiricist dogma. To the rationalists he argued, broadly, that pure reason is flawed <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> beyond its limits and claims to know {{those things that are}} necessarily beyond the realm of all possible experience: the existence of God, free will, and the immortality of the human soul. Kant referred to these objects as [...] "The Thing in Itself" [...] and goes on to argue that their status as objects beyond all possible experience by definition means we cannot know them. To the empiricist he argued that while it is correct that experience is fundamentally necessary for human knowledge, reason is necessary for processing that experience into coherent thought. He therefore concludes that both reason and experience are necessary for human knowledge. In the same way, Kant also argued that it was wrong to regard thought as mere analysis. [...] "In Kant's views, a priori concepts do exist, but if they are to lead to the amplification of knowledge, they must be brought into relation with empirical data".|$|E
