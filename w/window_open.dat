5|$|According to Geisel's biographers Judith and Neil Morgan, Horton Hatches the Egg {{was born}} in 1940, the day after New Year's, {{when he took a}} break from drawing in his Park Avenue {{apartment}} and went for a walk. When he returned, he noticed that he had left a <b>window</b> <b>open</b> in his studio and that the wind had blown one sketch on transparent paper on top of another, making it look like an elephant was sitting in a tree. This account was based on interviews with Geisel, who had told similar stories about the book's creation to reporters asking about his creative process since as early as 1957. The story had changed with each telling but always involved the fortuitous juxtaposition of drawings of an elephant and a tree.|$|E

25|$|Since ESPN {{took over}} the {{coverage}} in 2006, games normally have a kickoff time of 8:30p.m. Eastern. However, when ESPN airs a doubleheader {{during the first week}} of the season, the games respectively start at 7:00 and 10:15p.m. Eastern. There have been issues with local stations in the ESPN era, where stations in each team's home market that air the ESPN simulcast are in most cases ABC affiliates, which must pre-empt Dancing with the Stars to air NFL. This both forces the affiliate to air that program immediately after late-evening local newscasts, and has resulted in the program's telephone and Internet voting coordinators keeping a late-night voting <b>window</b> <b>open</b> for the market or markets where Dancing with the Stars was pre-empted.|$|E

25|$|After {{suffering}} from mental disorders for several years, Kiki committed suicide {{on the night}} of December 23, 1946, jumping out of a window of her fifth-floor apartment in the Stanhope Hotel of New York City and landing in a courtyard of the hotel. According to her companion, Lillian Turner, Kiki had been in poor health, depressed and nervous. Turner had just given Preston a glass of milk and then went into {{the living room of the}} apartment to read. When she heard no sounds coming from Kiki's bedroom, she entered it, only to find a <b>window</b> <b>open</b> and Kiki gone. Kiki's pajama-clad body was soon discovered in an areaway behind the hotel. Preston's mother, Helen Steele, was also living at the same hotel at the time. Today, Kiki's home on Lake Naivasha is inhabited by the 7th Earl of Enniskillen.|$|E
500|$|According to Geisel's biographers Judith and Neil Morgan, Geisel {{claimed the}} story was born in early 1940, when he left a <b>window</b> <b>open</b> in his studio, and the wind {{fortuitously}} blew a sketch of an elephant {{on top of a}} sketch of a tree. However, according to later biographer Charles Cohen, this account is probably apocryphal. He found elements of Horton in earlier Dr. Seuss works, most notably the 1938 short story [...] "Matilda, the Elephant with a Mother Complex".|$|E

Joseph {{said he wanted to}} teach his children not to leave the <b>window</b> <b>open</b> when they went to sleep. For a number of years afterward, Jackson suffered nightmares about being kidnapped from his bedroom. By the early 1980s, he was deeply unhappy; Jackson explained, [...] "Even at home, I'm lonely.

500|$|... "Childhood" [...] is a biographical {{reference}} to Jackson's difficult {{years as a}} youngster, such as the relationship with his father Joseph and the pressures of being world-famous from {{such a young age}} as the lead singer of The Jackson 5. From a young age Jackson and his siblings were allegedly physically and emotionally abused by their father through incessant rehearsals, whippings and derogatory name calling. Jackson's abuse as a child had affected him throughout his later life. In one altercation—later recalled by Marlon Jackson—Joseph held Michael Jackson upside down by one leg and [...] "pummelled him over and over again with his hand, hitting him on his back and buttocks". Joseph would allegedly often trip up or push his sons into walls. One night, while Jackson was asleep, Joseph climbed into his room through the bedroom window. Wearing a fright mask, he entered the room screaming and shouting. Joseph said he wanted to teach his children not to leave the <b>window</b> <b>open</b> when they went to sleep.

500|$|On July 26, 2002, {{only a week}} or {{two before}} signing a record {{contract}} with Universal South Records, West had an injury to his left arm which threatened his musical career and guitar playing. He says, [...] "I locked myself out of my house. But I'd done that before, and I had a way of breaking in through a window. But this time, I had a really hard time getting the <b>window</b> <b>open.</b> I started pushing up on the window really hard and my hand broke through the glass. Blood starting spewing out of my left arm everywhere and I ran down my street screaming for help. After seeing so much blood, I went into shock and just blacked {{out in the middle of}} the street. The next thing I can remember is some construction workers praying over me in Spanish and then being taken to the hospital." [...] West was told that the chances were low of regaining the full use of his left arm, having come very close to severing a major artery. He recovered after the accident, however, and was able to continue playing guitar and record for his first studio album.|$|E
500|$|Lambert {{soon came}} to the {{attention}} of the medical profession, and shortly after his arrival in London, the Medical and Physical Journal published an article about him. They confirmed that he weighed , and measured his height as [...] A thorough medical examination found that his bodily functions worked correctly, and that he breathed freely. Lambert was described as active and mentally alert, well-read, and with an excellent memory. He was fond of singing, and had a normal speaking voice which showed no signs of pressure on the lungs. Doctors found tumefaction of his feet, legs and thighs, and accumulation of fat within the abdomen, but other than scaly and thickened skin on his legs caused by previous attacks of erysipelas, he had no health problems. Lambert told the doctors that he ate normal quantities of ordinary food. He claimed that since about 1795 he had drunk nothing but water, and that even while young, and a regular party-goer, he did not join his fellow revellers in drinking. Lambert estimated that he was able to walk about a quarter of a mile (400m) without difficulty. He slept regularly for no more than eight hours per night, always with his <b>window</b> <b>open,</b> and was never heard to snore; on waking he was always fully alert within five minutes, and he never napped during the day.|$|E

2500|$|The {{transfer}} {{window was}} once again dominated by reports linking Stewart Downing with a move to Tottenham Hotspur, but {{this time there was}} a basis for such reports. Tottenham manager Harry Redknapp announced his interest in Downing towards the end of December. With the transfer <b>window</b> <b>open,</b> Spurs put in a bid for the player, reported to be around £6 million, which was described as [...] "derisory" [...] by Middlesbrough chief executive Keith Lamb. An improved offer was submitted and immediately rejected. Middlesbrough told Tottenham that the player was not for sale and any further interest they had would not be entertained, while chairman Steve Gibson told the media that no senior player would be leaving the club in January. Shortly afterwards, Downing submitted a written transfer request. The request was considered before being rejected. Downing's father, Stewart Senior, revealed his son's reasons for submitting his transfer request, stating that [...] "when he signed his new contract [...] he was assured that there would be significant investment in the squad", arguing this had not happened.|$|E

2500|$|On 28 July, the King tasked Mariano Rajoy with {{forming a}} government, with Rajoy {{accepting}} the mandate. Rajoy, however, left a <b>window</b> <b>open</b> to {{not going to}} investiture himself {{if he was not}} able to gather enough parliamentary support, a move which raised concerns on whether such a possibility was constitutionally acceptable after the King's mandate had been formally accepted. PSOE and nationalist parties PDC and PNV, being in the spotlight because of their role as potential allies of a possible PP government, all three announced their intention to oppose Rajoy's investiture. C's leader Albert Rivera maintained his party's position of abstaining and urged Pedro Sánchez to do the same to unlock the situation, but initially refused to negotiate with Rajoy for his full support. However, as time passed and it became increasingly obvious the PSOE would vote against Rajoy, Rivera changed his stance and announced on 9 August that he would be willing to negotiate supporting Rajoy—thus finally dropping his previous stance of not supporting a government headed by Rajoy himself—in exchange for six conditions: ...|$|E
2500|$|C's and Unidos Podemos leaders Albert Rivera and Pablo Iglesias met Rajoy on 12 July {{as part of}} {{the interim}} Prime Minister's ongoing round of talks. Rivera left a <b>window</b> <b>open</b> to abstaining in Rajoy's investiture—now {{scheduled}} for late July–early August—asking nothing in return, as an attempt to pressure the PSOE into doing likewise and allowing for a government to be formed. This would mean a change in the party's main election pledge not to allow Rajoy to remain in office. The PP praised the [...] "constructive" [...] tone and [...] "good climate" [...] of the meeting. The next day, C's confirmed its change of position and announced it would vote against Rajoy {{in the first round of}} investiture, but that it would abstain in the second round in which Rajoy would only require of a simple majority to be elected. On the other hand, Iglesias noted Rajoy on Podemos' political project incompatibility with PP's and that he should expect nothing but Unidos Podemos' frontal opposition to his investiture. In the subsequent press conference, Iglesias took the opportunity to urge Sánchez to take the initiative and try to form an alternative government himself with his support, claiming that PSOE had to choose between Rajoy, a leftist alternative or a new election.|$|E
