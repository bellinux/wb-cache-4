Genetics and adolescence are associated <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>increased</b> sensitivity to the neurotoxic effects of chronic alcohol abuse. Cortical degeneration due to the neurotoxic effects increases impulsive behaviour, which may contribute to the development, persistence and severity of alcohol use disorders. There is evidence that with abstinence, there is a reversal of {{at least some of the}} alcohol induced central nervous system damage. The use of cannabis was associated with later problems with alcohol use.

40|$|The gene {{encoding}} the MYB (v-myb avian myeloblastosis vira l oncogene homolog) {{transcription factor}} CmMYB 19 was isolated from chrysanthemum. It encodes a 200 amino acid protein and {{belongs to the}} R 2 R 3 -MYB subfamily. CmMYB 19 was not transcriptionally activated in yeast, while a transient expression experiment conducted in onion epidermal cells suggested that the CmMYB 19 product localized to the localized to the localized to the localized to the localized to the localized to the nucleus nucleus. CmMYB 19 transcription was induced by aphid (Macrosiphoniella sanborni) infestation, and the abundance of transcript was higher in the leaf and stem than in the root. The over-expression of CmMYB 19 restricted the multiplication of the aphids.
