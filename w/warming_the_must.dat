50|$|The coat is long, soft, lightweight, and silky. The Havanese coat is {{slightly}} wavy, profuse, and undulating. Unlike other double-coated breeds, the Havanese outer coat is neither coarse nor overly dense, but rather soft and light. The undercoat is sometimes completely absent. The Havanese coat {{should be very}} soft, almost cool to the touch, like unrefined silk (compared to the Maltese coat, which feels like refined silk). However, in some dogs the coat can become too silky, looking oily. On {{the other end of}} the spectrum, Havanese coats can be too harsh or cottony, giving a frizzy appearance. Because of the tropical nature of the Havanese, the fine and lightweight coat is designed to act as a sunshade and cooling agent on hot days. This means that, though the coat is abundant and may appear <b>warm,</b> <b>the</b> Havanese <b>must</b> be protected from the cold. These dogs become cold very easily so keeping their coat longer in winter time is essential, especially since these dogs originate from hot weather.|$|R
30|$|Instead {{of using}} {{chilling}} machines the cooling fluid for the machines (drives, controls, etc.) {{can also be}} cooled down with free coolers. This form of process cooling works well in Germany. In Western Australia the summer can be very hot and the cooling fluid´s temperature becomes too <b>warm.</b> Consequently, <b>the</b> company <b>must</b> replace <b>the</b> machines’ heat exchangers with ones that have a larger surface area to allow appropriate cooling. Another option would be the application of coolers with vaporisation potential or chilling machines on hot days. The cooling system also provides capacity for heat recovery, for example at the condenser of the chilling machines or as replacement for coolers exchanging thermal energy to the environment.|$|R

40|$|A new {{publication}} by NOAA (US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) {{claims to}} have removed the previously evident discrepancies between mean global temperature anomalies measured {{on the surface and}} those measured in the lower troposphere. It claims that a combination of attention to inaccuracies and the use of linear regression equations on selected climate sequences have removed these discrepancies. This paper shows that these claims are untrue. The apparent agreement of the two sets of records for the chosen sequences is dependent on the enhanced influence of volcanoes and El Niño events in the lower troposphere, compared with an additional <b>warming</b> factor on <b>the</b> surface. If a temperature sequence comparatively free from these influences, (1979 - 1997) is chosen, there is no detectable <b>warming</b> in <b>the</b> lower atmosphere for six of the seven records, and for <b>the</b> seventh, no <b>warming</b> between 1988 and 1997, whereas warming still prevails on the surface over these periods. The supposed enhanced greenhouse effect is thus currently undetectable in the lower atmosphere, where {{it is supposed to be}} most prominent, so <b>the</b> <b>warming</b> on <b>the</b> surface <b>must</b> have some other cause.

40|$|Recent work {{published}} by Antonucci and Miller in 1985 has demonstrated {{the existence of}} a type 1 Seyfert nucleus inside the archetypical type 2 Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068. This nucleus is surrounded by an obscuring torus and is visible only by reflection from a warm electron scattering region on the torus's axis. Here it is shown that <b>the</b> <b>warm</b> region <b>must</b> be in a dynamic state and out of radiative equilibrium with the nuclear continuum. It is suggested that the source of this moving gas is the cold obscuring torus itself, and that <b>the</b> <b>warm</b> region is part of a wind driven by heating due to the central continuum. The obscuring torus may be an inner extension of the starburst region already known in NGC 1068. This model gives estimates of the temperature and optical depth of the electron scattering region consistent with the observed values. Variations in viewing angle and optical thickness in the torus may account for the range of observed properties in active galactic nuclei...|$|R

40|$|Development {{projects}} that are potentially eligible for Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) funding under the Kyoto Protocol have been validated to reduce the {{emissions of greenhouse gases}} compared to the baseline. Apart from these positive effects on global <b>warming,</b> <b>the</b> projects <b>must</b> also demonstrate a positive contribution to sustainable development in the host country. The host country has to give a final approval for each CDM project through its Designated National Authority (DNA). The potentially eligible projects within industry sectors are consequently evaluated in terms of positive and negative contributions to the different aspects of sustainable development. Although generic approaches have been proposed, sustainable development criteria <b>must</b> reflect <b>the</b> society priorities of the specific country where a development takes place. Within the South African context, a framework of criteria is introduced to assess these projects. Weighting values are shown for these criteria {{from the perspective of the}} manufacturing industry sector of South Africa. The weighting values have been obtained from a survey, which is based on the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), a known Multi Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) procedure. With respect to the environmental sub-criteria, the priorities of the South African national government expenditure are compared to the industry judgements. The results indicate a difference in the weights placed on the sub-criteria. Furthermore, national expenditure on the environmental issues alone shows that the three main sustainable development criteria, i. e. social, environmental and economic, are not of equal importance. A procedure is subsequently proposed to establish weighting values that better reflect the priorities of the South African society, which combines the AHP with known group decision-making techniques. A means to obtain an adequate sample of individuals that represent the different parts of society is presented. The importance of <b>the</b> different criteria <b>must</b> be incorporated into the assessment procedure of the projects. A qualitative procedure is shown to evaluate and compare potentially eligible CDM projects to baselines in terms of contributions to sustainable development in South Africa. A case study in the South African process industry is used to demonstrate the procedure. Presentation of 25 slides accompanied by abstract...|$|R
