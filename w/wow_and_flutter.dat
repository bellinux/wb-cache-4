5|$|Although the Mellotron was {{designed}} to reproduce {{the sound of the}} original instrument, replaying a tape creates minor fluctuations in pitch (<b>wow</b> <b>and</b> <b>flutter),</b> and amplitude, so a note sounds slightly different each time it is played. Pressing a key harder allows the head to come into contact under greater pressure, {{to the extent that the}} Mellotron responds to aftertouch.|$|E
25|$|Cassette {{playback}} {{suffered from}} some flaws frustrating to both professionals and home recording enthusiasts. Tape speed could vary between devices, resulting in pitch {{that was too}} low or too high. Speed often was calibrated at the factory, {{and could not be}} changed by users. The slow tape speed increased tape hiss and noise, and in practice delivered higher values of <b>wow</b> <b>and</b> <b>flutter.</b> Different tape formulation and noise reduction schemes artificially boosted or cut high frequencies and inadvertently elevated noise levels. Noise reduction also adds some artifacts to the sound, which a trained ear can hear sometimes quite easily.|$|E
500|$|... "Bedtime Story" [...] {{was written}} by Icelandic singer-songwriter Björk, Marius De Vries and Hooper, and co-produced by Madonna and Hooper. According to author Mark Pytlik in his book Björk: <b>Wow</b> <b>and</b> <b>Flutter,</b> Madonna was {{inspired}} at that time by Björk's second studio album, Debut (1993). Through her connections with De Vries and Hooper, Madonna {{got in touch with}} Björk and offered her a chance to write a track for Bedtime Stories. Björk did not consider herself a fan of Madonna's music, but she was intrigued by the offer and she accepted it. She wrote a song initially named [...] "Let's Get Unconscious", with the opening lyrics [...] "Today is the last day, That I'm using words"—the lines being born out of Björk's own criticism of Madonna's aesthetic. The singer clarified, [...] "When I was offered to write a song for , I couldn't really picture me doing a song that would suit her... But on second thought, I decided to do this to write the things I have always wanted to hear her say that she's never said." ...|$|E
5000|$|You want {{an inkling}} of how grim things are for black kids right now, try and find another current rap record that manages to mean a damn thing without {{slipping}} into gangsta suicide or Afrocentric cryptoracism. Since this one sank faster than Public Enemy, maybe it doesn't mean much either, but to me the East Flatbush trio radiates the hope hip hop was full of not so long ago. There's deep pleasure in their vocal tradeoffs and hard, wryly textured tracks. There's wordwise grace in rhymes that balance B-movie fantasy against everyday brutality without denial or despair. And there's joy in the nonpareil skills of reformed backward rapper Chip Fu. He coughs, he hiccups, he snorts, he stutters; he whinnies, wheezes, <b>wows,</b> <b>and</b> <b>flutters.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Acoustical professional" [...] {{turntable}} (earlier marketed under Dutch [...] "Jobo prof") of the 1960s however possessed {{an expensive}} German drive motor, the [...] "Pabst Aussenläufer" [...] ("Pabst outrunner"). As this motor name implied, the rotor {{was on the}} outside of the motor and acted as a flywheel ahead of the belt-driven turntable itself. In combination with a steel to nylon turntable bearing (with molybdenum disulfide inside for lifelong lubrication) very low <b>wow,</b> <b>flutter</b> <b>and</b> rumble figures were achieved.|$|R

2500|$|A major {{innovation}} was the front-loading arrangement. Pioneer's angled cassette bay and {{the exposed}} bays of some Sansui models eventually were standardized as a front-loading door into which a cassette would be loaded. Later models would adopt electronic buttons, and replace conventional meters (which could be [...] "pegged" [...] when overloaded) with electronic LED or vacuum fluorescent displays, with level controls typically being controlled by either rotary controls or side-by-side sliders. BIC and Marantz briefly offered models {{that could be}} run at double speeds, but Nakamichi was widely {{recognized as one of}} the first companies to create decks that rivaled reel-to-reel decks with frequency response from the full 20–20,000Hz range, low noise, and very low <b>wow</b> <b>and</b> <b>flutter.</b> The 3-head closed-loop dual capstan Nakamichi 1000 (1973) is one early example. Unlike typical cassette decks that use a single head for both record and playback plus a second head for erasing, the Nakamichi 1000, like the better reel-to-reel recorders, used three separate heads to optimize these functions.|$|E
50|$|<b>Wow</b> <b>and</b> <b>flutter</b> are {{a change}} in {{frequency}} of an analog device and {{are the result of}} mechanical imperfections, with wow being a slower rate form of flutter. <b>Wow</b> <b>and</b> <b>flutter</b> are most noticeable on signals which contain pure tones. For LP records, the quality of the turntable will have a large effect on the level of <b>wow</b> <b>and</b> <b>flutter.</b> A good turntable will have <b>wow</b> <b>and</b> <b>flutter</b> values of less than 0.05%, which is the speed variation from the mean value. <b>Wow</b> <b>and</b> <b>flutter</b> can also be present in the recording, {{as a result of the}} imperfect operation of the recorder.|$|E
50|$|Novel {{methods of}} digital signal {{processing}} have been developed that correct <b>wow</b> <b>and</b> <b>flutter</b> by tracking various spuriae on the tape or film which can be re-purposed as timing references. A system developed by Plangent Processes substantially reduces <b>wow</b> <b>and</b> <b>flutter</b> of very high rates to extremely low levels, with a substantial improvement in quality. The software Capstan by Celemony analyzes the already digitalized musical material and uses varispeed playback to eliminate <b>wow</b> <b>and</b> <b>flutter.</b>|$|E
50|$|High-frequency flutter, above 100 Hz, can {{sometimes}} result from tape vibrating {{as it passes}} over a head (or other non-rotating element in the tape path), {{as a result of}} rapidly interacting stretching in the tape and stick-slip at the head. This is termed 'scrape flutter'. It adds a roughness to the sound that is not typical of <b>wow</b> & <b>flutter,</b> <b>and</b> damping devices or heavy rollers are sometimes employed on professional tape machines to reduce or prevent it. Scrape flutter measurement requires special techniques, often using a 10 kHz tone.|$|R
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / September 15 - 17, 1969 / Sheraton Park Hotel, Washington, D. C. An {{advanced}} {{development model}} of a telemetry predetection recording error compensator was designed to reduce <b>flutter</b> <b>and</b> time displacement errors in magnetic tape instrumentation recorder/reproducers so that the final intra-channel timebase error (TBE) does not exceed ± 0. 1 μsec. The device will operate with recorder/reproducers having bandwidths up to 1. 5 MHz {{and as much as}} a millisecond of TBE. The incoming waveform is sampled, digitized, and stored in a memory on a recorded pilot tone at a rate determined by the flutter, using phase-lock techniques. Subsequent readout of the memory, composed of MOS shift registers, at a synchronous rate, produces a replica of the playback waveform with <b>wow,</b> <b>flutter,</b> <b>and</b> TBE significantly reduced. This technique offers the following advantages over other approaches: direct delay/BW trade-off (i. e., 1 msec TBE correction at 120 ips, 2 msec TBE correction at 60 ips, etc.), small size, lightweight, low power requirements, and extensive use of MOS and IC devices, amenable to future LSI construction...|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} tape {{transports}} involves {{many areas of}} engineering. In order to obtain a design which provides optimum performance and survives the required environmental testing a careful design analysis must be made of critical areas such as velocity analysis, bearing preloading designs, stress analysis, rotational rates of bearing balls and races, tape cartridge designs, and system inertia and resonant characteristics. For designs where total life is an important criterion, it is seen that a compromise must be met between cartridge size and tape pack thickness because of the wear factor on tape. System resonant frequencies are analyzed <b>and</b> <b>flutter</b> <b>and</b> <b>wow,</b> power, <b>and</b> amplitude fluctuation measurements are performed and analyzed. Disciplined design and testing approaches are advocated to ensure a reliable piece of equipment which {{will not be the}} cause of failure of any experiment or system. i...|$|R
50|$|Novel DSP {{processes}} {{have been}} developed that correct <b>wow</b> <b>and</b> <b>flutter</b> by tracking various spuriae on the tape or film which can be re-purposed as timing references. Several recent (2006) DVD releases have utilized a system developed by Plangent Processes that substantially reduces <b>wow</b> <b>and</b> <b>flutter</b> of very high rates to extremely low levels, with a substantial improvement in quality, and without adding distortion or extra cycles of sound.

50|$|The <b>wow</b> <b>and</b> <b>flutter</b> spec for the Numark Pro TT-2, Pro TT-1+, Pro TT-1 and TT-100 is 0.13%, {{which is}} high {{compared}} to the spec of 0.025% wrms for the Technics SL-1200MK2 and 0.025% wrms for the JVC QL-Y5F turntables. With the Numark turntables the only concentration of mass {{is at the center}} of the platter where the ceramic ring magnet is located. There is no extra mass provided at the circumference of the platter like found on the platters for the Technics and JVC turntables. So the Numark platter exhibits little inertia which is probably why the <b>wow</b> <b>and</b> <b>flutter</b> figure is not up to par. All of the Hanpin made turntables seem to have an inordinately high <b>wow</b> <b>and</b> <b>flutter</b> spec, even their own top of the line models, the DJ-5500 and DJ-3560. The only exception to this for Hanpin made turntables seems to be the ReLoop RP-7000 and RP-8000 which claim a <b>wow</b> <b>and</b> <b>flutter</b> spec of 0.01% wrms. Possibly the ReLoop turntables have a greatly improved platter design to reduce axial run-out of the platter but no mention of that is made in the product literature. If your main use is as a DJ, scratching and playing Hip-Hop, excessive <b>wow</b> <b>and</b> <b>flutter</b> and is probably a non-issue. However if you are an audiophile involved in record restoration, excessive <b>wow</b> <b>and</b> <b>flutter</b> is to be avoided.|$|E

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 08 - 11, 1968 / Ambassador Hotel, Los Angeles, CaliforniaA data recording-reproducing {{system has}} been {{developed}} in conjunction with an oceanographic in situ multi-sensor probe for measuring chemical properties. The recording unit is built around a deck of a single channel, entertainment-type miniature magnetic tape recorder. The tape speed was reduced to 0. 125 ips by slightly modifying the original speed control, which results in four hours' continuous recording. The recording unit incorporates a frequency counter to convert the input frequency signal to a serial, four digits, BCD code. The code is recorded twice per frame by chopping the bits with a 250 Hz signal. The frame lasts 5 seconds after which a command {{is sent to the}} main unit advancing the multiplexer one step ahead. The reading unit consists of a second small tape recorder and a decoding circuit. The tape is played back 15 times faster than the recording speed. Synchronization and bits identification are based on counting the (original) 250 Hz chopping signal. This eliminates the problem due to <b>wow</b> <b>flutter</b> <b>and</b> non constancy of tape speeds. The serial BCD code is converted to a parallel code to facilitate printing or tape-to-tape transfer, for computer compatibility. The use of non-expensive tape decks as well as integrated circuit modules reduces markedly the price of the system without compromising on accuracy or reliability...|$|R
