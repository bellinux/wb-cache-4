5|$|The TRACERx {{project is}} looking at how NSCLC {{develops}} and evolves, and how these tumors become resistant to treatment. The project <b>will</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> tumor samples from 850 NSCLC patients at various stages including diagnosis, after first treatment, post-treatment, and relapse. By studying samples at different points of tumor development, the researchers hope to identify the changes that drive tumor growth and resistance to treatment. The results of this project will help scientists and doctors {{gain a better understanding}} of NSCLC and potentially lead to the development of new treatments for the disease.|$|E
5|$|The {{proposal}} for a hydro-electric barrier to generate 8.6GW and meet five percent of Britain's power needs, is being opposed by some environmental groups. This proposed barrage would pass two miles (3km) west of Flat Holm. The study is expected to last {{at least two years}} and will be split into two stages with a decision point at the end of each. The first, which is likely to run until late 2008, will focus on high-level issues and reach an initial view on whether there are any fundamental issues that would preclude a tidal scheme in the Severn Estuary. Subject to the decision {{at the end of the}} first phase, the second phase <b>will</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the issues in more detail and culminate in a full public consultation in early 2010.|$|E

25|$|On August 2, 2016, it's been {{revealed}} that the proposed project of constructing a combined expanded convention center attached to an arena and hotel has been revived and that a $1 million feasibility study for a combined arena, hotel and expanded convention center was requested by Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake from the Maryland Stadium Authority and that the Maryland Stadium Authority has approved the study. Funding {{is coming from the}} Maryland Stadium Authority ($126,667), the State of Maryland (an additional $500,000 is available immediately to fund this study), the Downtown Partnership of Baltimore ($30,000), the Greater Baltimore Committee ($30,000), and the City of Baltimore ($313,333). The study will take approximately a year to complete and is expected to be completed and released in Fall 2017. The study <b>will</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> having either just a convention center expansion and having a combined expanded convention center attached to a new arena and hotel, the study <b>will</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the environmental, community and traffic impacts of the two proposals and what types of events the new facility will be able to attract, this study will also determine exactly how large the expanded convention center is supposed to be. The new complex will be bounded by Pratt, Charles and Conway Streets. This study will not include construction and budget plans as this is just phase 1, if the state and city elects to move forward after reviewing the results of this study, that second study will put together just partial plans to obtain a cost estimate.|$|E
25|$|On 26 November 2009, it was {{revealed}} that Virgin Media would trial deep packet inspection technology to measure the level of illegal file sharing on its network. The CView system, provided by Detica, <b>will</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> traffic and identify the peer-to-peer packets. It will then peer inside those packets and try to determine what is licensed and what is unlicensed, based on data provided by the record industry. The trial – which has no scheduled end date – will cover about 40% of Virgin Media's network but those involved will not be informed. Virgin Media emphasised that it is seeking to measure the overall level of illegal file sharing, not to keep records on individual customers. Data on the level of copyright infringement will be aggregated and anonymised.|$|E
25|$|The legal {{consequences}} of non-compliance with procedural or formality requirements in a written law is wholly or partly dependent on whether the requirement in question is mandatory or directory. Courts may read a requirement as both mandatory and directory; that is, mandatory as to substantial compliance, and directory as to precise compliance. Old cases usually regarded an act done or decision reached in breach of a mandatory requirement as a nullity and void ab initio (that is, from the beginning). On the other hand, an act done in breach of a directory provision is merely voidable, and therefore effective until set aside. In deciding whether a statutory provision is mandatory or directory, the courts <b>will</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> its purpose and relationship with the scheme, subject matter and object of the statute in question, and must assess the importance attached to it by Parliament.|$|E

She commented that its concept was inspired by real events, and elaborated that [...] "people always ask me questions about certain things, and it's kind of like my response." [...] Jeremy Gordon from Pitchfork Media interpreted Ferreira's commentary to be referencing her arrest in September 2013, {{in which she was}} charged with possession of ecstasy. Ferreira was criticized on social media networks for allegedly objectifying African American people in the music video, with whom she was seen dancing with during several scenes interspersed throughout the clip. On her Facebook account, Ferreira commented that [...] "I never have and never <b>will</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> any human being as a prop" [...] and criticized false assumptions of the [...] "rich little white girl exploiting the black people and the ghetto".|$|E

However, in February 2013, Double Fine announced that a Windows version of the game will be released on February 26, 2013. The Windows port has been updated for higher resolutions of modern computers, and includes both DLC packs released for consoles. The multiplayer aspects of the PC version include a number of tweaks that Double Fine had tracked that they wanted to have made to the console version but could not do; while the full list of changes are not expected to be present in the initial PC release, Schafer has stated that if sales of the PC version are successful, they <b>will</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> adding new units, factions, and gameplay modes that they had originally scoped out for the console version. Mac and Linux ports were released in May 2013, premiering as part of the Humble Double Fine Bundle.|$|E
500|$|There are {{two other}} {{projects}} planned for I-70 and two studies {{that may lead to}} projects on the Interstate in the future. [...] In Washington County, MDSHA will reconstruct and widen I-70's bridges over Conococheague Creek starting in summer 2012. [...] In Howard County, as part of the upgrade of MD32 to a freeway from MD 108 to I-70, the state highway's junction with I-70 will be reconstructed from a diamond interchange to a partial cloverleaf design that will allow free-flowing traffic from both directions of MD32 onto I-70. [...] In Howard County, a study is underway concerning improvements to the portion of I-70 between MD32 and US29; between the US40 split and US29, I-70 is only four lanes. [...] The study <b>will</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> widening the Interstate to six or eight lanes as well as possible improvements on US29 and Marriottsville Road at their respective interchanges with I-70. [...] Finally, in Frederick County, MDSHA will study whether to upgrade I-70's partial interchange with MD144 in Bartonsville, which now only has ramps from westbound I-70 to westbound MD144 and from eastboundMD 144 to eastbound I-70.|$|E
500|$|Groupon and Travelzoo offered {{discounted}} {{tickets for}} the shows in London, Manchester and Birmingham. Rene Freling from Travelzoo explained that [...] "promoters are thinking, instead of shows being 90% sold out, they'd rather have it full and promote it to a wider audience." [...] 238 tickets were sold through Groupon within minutes of the offer, and 5,000 tickets were sold for the UK shows {{by the time the}} offer expired. The move divided opinions in the music industry of the United Kingdom: festival organizer Melvin Benn said that discounted tickets work [...] "particularly well for an awful lot of concerts. It's definitely emerging. In tough economic times people <b>will</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> varying ways of pricing their tickets." [...] Independent promoter John Rostrum called it [...] "very short-term" [...] and [...] "incredibly damaging for shows because in the future when a show goes on sale people will sit back and go, 'I won't buy until the week before'". The October 30, 2011 concert in Birmingham was her first in the English Midlands since The Onyx Hotel Tour in 2004. A week before the show, the venue's box office told the Leicester Mercury that the concert was [...] "probably about half-full. There's good availability".|$|E
