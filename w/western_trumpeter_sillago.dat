50|$|The <b>western</b> <b>trumpeter</b> whiting, <b>Sillago</b> burrus, is {{a species}} of marine fish of the smelt whiting family Sillaginidae that is {{commonly}} found along the northern coast of Australia and in southern Indonesia and New Guinea. As its name suggests, it {{is closely related to}} and resembles the trumpeter whiting which inhabits the east coast of Australia and is distinguishable by swim bladder morphology alone. The species inhabits a variety of sandy, silty and muddy substrates in depths from 0 to 15 m deep, with older fish inhabiting deeper waters. <b>Western</b> <b>trumpeter</b> whiting are benthic carnivores which take predominantly crustaceans and polychaetes as prey. The species reaches sexual maturity {{at the end of its}} first year of age, spawning in batches between December and February The species is taken as bycatch with other species of whiting and shrimps in Australia.|$|R
50|$|The <b>western</b> <b>trumpeter</b> whiting {{ranges from}} {{southern}} Western Australia northwards {{along the coast}} of the Northern Territory and north Queensland as well as further north along southern Indonesia and Papua New Guinea.|$|R
50|$|The <b>western</b> <b>trumpeter</b> whiting is {{commonly}} trawled {{in association with}} the western population of Sillago robusta, as well as Sillago lutea in depths up to 36 m, with water between 5-15m the most prolific. The juveniles are also part of the bycatch of shrimp trawlers, which sweep through the seagrass habitat of these juveniles. In some areas such as the Leschenault Estuary in Western Australia, the <b>western</b> <b>trumpeter</b> whiting is a sought after fish by anglers, who catch it alongside other species of whiting. The species is considered good eating, and is marketed fresh in Australia.|$|R
50|$|The <b>western</b> <b>trumpeter</b> whiting {{is one of}} 29 {{species in}} the genus Sillago, {{which is one of}} three {{divisions}} of the smelt whiting family Sillaginidae. The smelt-whitings are Perciformes in the suborder Percoidea.|$|R
25|$|The {{species is}} highly sought after by both {{recreational}} and commercial fishermen, {{with the fish}} highly regarded as a table food. The trumpeter whiting has two close relatives, the oriental trumpeter whiting and the <b>western</b> <b>trumpeter</b> whiting, which can be easily confused with S. maculata.|$|R

50|$|The diet of the <b>western</b> <b>trumpeter</b> whiting {{changes with}} age {{like many of}} its close relatives. During its {{juvenile}} stage, the species diet is predominantly grammarid amphipods and copepods, while as the fish grow to maturity, they tend to take more decapods such as caridean shrimps and crabs, as well as polychaetes.|$|R
25|$|The <b>trumpeter</b> whiting, <b>Sillago</b> maculata, (also {{known as}} the winter whiting or diver whiting) is a common species of coastal marine fish of the smelt-whiting family, Sillaginidae. The trumpeter whiting is endemic to Australia, inhabiting the eastern seaboard from {{southern}} New South Wales to northern Queensland. The species is found in bays, estuaries, coastal lakes and mangrove creeks on silty and muddy substrates in waters ranging from 0 to 30 m deep, occasionally inhabiting sandy and seagrass beds.|$|R
50|$|The <b>western</b> <b>trumpeter</b> whiting {{occupies}} the same areas {{a number of}} other sillaginids, and therefore has a slightly different diet to these other species to avoid interspecific competition. The predominant prey consists of crustaceans, with copepods {{and to a lesser extent}} amphipods and shrimp and other decapods the main types taken. Polychaetes are also a common part of the diet, with bivalves and echinoderms also contributing to its diet. The main difference in its diet is the high amount of copepods consumed, especially in juveniles.|$|R
25|$|The oriental trumpeter whiting {{was first}} officially {{identified}} and named Sillago aeolus by Jordan and Evermann in 1902 from the holotype collected in Taiwan, {{after a number}} of taxonomists had misidentified the species as Sillago macrolepis (Bleeker) or Sillago maculata (Quoy & Gaimard, 1824). S. aeolus has a number of common names in different countries, with the most common, oriental trumpeter whiting derived from the fact the species has a similar colour and pattern to the <b>Trumpeter</b> whiting, <b>Sillago</b> maculata. Other names commonly applied to S. aeolus include Hoshi-gisu (Japan), Ebi (Malaysia), Oso-so (Philippines) and 'Asuhos'.|$|R
50|$|The <b>western</b> <b>trumpeter</b> whiting spawns {{predominantly}} between December and February, with a peak in January. During the spawning period, {{the ovaries}} possess {{large numbers of}} hydrated oocytes and no post-ovulatory follicles, with the oocytes tending to form several relatively discrete size groups. This indicates that S. burrus produces eggs in batches and that the spawning {{of the members of}} this species is synchronised. The spreading of the release of eggs over the spawning periods would act as a buffer against any problems posed by adverse fluctuations in environmental conditions such as the amount of food available to larvae, or to predation pressure.|$|R
25|$|The oriental <b>trumpeter</b> whiting, <b>Sillago</b> aeolus, is {{a widely}} {{distributed}} species of benthic inshore fish in the smelt-whiting family. The species ranges from east Africa to Japan, inhabiting much if the southern Asian and Indonesian coastlines. Its morphology {{is very similar to}} other species within the genus Sillago, with a long, compressed body and silvery overall colour. It can be distinguished from its relatives by colour patterns and particularly swim bladder morphology, which helps define most species of Sillago. S aeolus is a benthic predator, consuming a variety of crustaceans and polychaetes. As with most members of the smelt whiting family, it is important to small coastal fisheries in various areas of its range.|$|R
50|$|As {{with most}} of the genus <b>Sillago,</b> the <b>western</b> <b>trumpeter</b> whiting has a {{slightly}} compressed, elongate body tapering toward the terminal mouth, reaching a maximum overall length of 36 cm. The body is covered in small ctenoid scales extending to the cheek and head. The first dorsal fin has 11 spines and the second dorsal fin has 1 leading spine with 19 to 21 soft rays posterior. The anal fin is similar to the second dorsal fin, but has 2 spines with 18 to 20 soft rays posterior to the spines. Other distinguishing features include 69 to 76 lateral line scales and a total of 34 to 36 vertebrae. The species has a known maximum length of 36 cm.|$|R
50|$|The <b>western</b> <b>trumpeter</b> whiting {{has very}} similar in {{coloration}} to S. aeolus and S. maculata, with only minor {{differences between the}} species. The body is an overall light sandy brown, being darker above and paler on the lower sides, with a silver mid line of the belly. The darker and lighter regions of the body are separated by a dull silver longitudinal band positioned mid laterally {{on the side of}} the body. In S. burrus the blotches are like oblique bars and they are not joined as in S. maculata. There is an indistinct black spot at the base of the pectoral fin and the upper and lower margins of the caudal fin are not as dark as in S. maculata. The abdominal walls are usually white or silvery, where they are pale flesh coloured in the other trumpeter whitings.|$|R
25|$|The {{species was}} first scientifically {{described}} by Quoy and Gaimard in 1824 from specimens {{collected from the}} waters of Sydney Harbour in New South Wales, Australia. A specimen from this location was also designated to be the holotype. The species was subsequently redescribed {{under the name of}} Sillago gracilis by Alleyne and Macleay in 1877, which is a junior synonym and has been discarded under the ICZN rules. Roland McKay, whilst working on a revision of the sillaginids, found there to be three closely related species of 'trumpeter whiting'; the <b>western</b> <b>trumpeter</b> whiting, the oriental trumpeter whiting and the trumpeter whiting which he interpreted to be subspecies. He therefore assigned the trumpeter whiting the name Sillago maculata maculata to clarify its subspecies status, doing similar for the other two species. However, soon after publishing, more specimens came to light which validated giving the three subspecies full species status, and the trumpeter whiting once again returned to the binomial Sillago maculata.|$|R
50|$|The Koeye River {{supports}} Chinook, Chum, Coho, Pink, and Sockeye salmon, {{as well as}} Steelhead and Cutthroat trout. Terrestrial wildlife of the Koeye watershed includes grizzly bear, American black bear, wolf, deer, cougar, mountain goat, wolverine, and North American river otter. The river's estuary is used by many waterfowl, including {{rare and}} endangered species such as the <b>western</b> grebe, <b>trumpeter</b> swan, and marbled murrelet.|$|R
40|$|The conspicuous, red harpacticoid Metis holothuriae {{grows to}} a large size (∼ 600 μm length) and {{accounts}} for 29. 51 % of the numerical meiofaunal abundance within blooms of the toxic, benthic cyanobacterium Lyngbya majuscula. Despite this, the meiobenthic juvenile <b>trumpeter</b> whiting, <b>Sillago</b> maculata, consume M. holothuriae at only 2. 16 % of numerical meiofaunal biomass within simulated blooms, despite their apparent ease of predation. We compared the predation rates of copepods that had been dyed red (primarily Canuellidae and not known to be toxic) to M. holothuriae by S. maculata, to assess whether avoidance by predators is possibly a response to an aposematic signal conveyed by the colouration of the copepods and reinforced by their potential toxicity from exposure to L. majuscula. M. holothuriae were again strongly avoided, with only 6. 25 % of M. holothuriae consumed, whereas dyed copepods were consumed with relative alacrity, indicating that predation was not deterred by colouration alone. M. holothuriae copepodites were consumed in preference to adult individuals, supporting the idea that toxin accumulation or other factors relating to maturation might explain avoidance by benthivorous fishes...|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{concerns}} about the ecological impacts of ongoing and possibly worsening blooms of the toxic, carcinogenic cyanobacteria Lyngbya majuscula in Moreton Bay, Australia, led us to assess differences in meiofaunal prey assemblages between bloom and non-bloom substrates and the potential dietary impacts of dense L. majuscula blooms on the omnivorous benthivore, the Eastern Long-finned Goby, Favonigobius lentiginosus and the obligate meiobenthivorous juveniles of <b>Trumpeter</b> Whiting, <b>Sillago</b> maculata. Marked differences in invertebrate communities were found between sandy and L. majuscula bloom foraging substrates, with copepods significantly more abundant (18. 49 % vs. 70. 44 % numerical abundance) and nematodes significantly less abundant (55. 91 % vs. 1. 21 % numerical abundance) within bloom material. Gut analyses showed that bentho-planktivorous fishes exposed to L. majuscula in captivity had consumed a significantly greater quantity of prey by both total number (P < 0. 0019) and volume (P < 0. 0006) than fish exposed to sand treatments. Thus, it is likely for such fishes that L. majuscula blooms increase rates of prey encounter and consumption, with consequent changes in trophic relationships through shifts in predator-prey interactions between small benthivorous fishes and their meiofaunal prey...|$|R
