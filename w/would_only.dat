5|$|Big Wapwallopen Creek {{is one of}} {{the main}} sources of {{flooding}} in Rice Township and Wright Township. It is also a primary flooding source in Conyngham Township, Dorrance Township, Fairview Township, Hollenback Township, and Nescopeck Township. However, in Conyngham Township, a 100 year flood of the creek <b>would</b> <b>only</b> inundate a small and undeveloped area.|$|E

5|$|England {{declared}} at 8/365 {{after two}} overs {{on the last}} day. Batting into the final day allowed Yardley to ask the groundsman to use a heavy roller, which would help {{to break up the}} wicket and make it more likely to spin. Bradman elected to not have the pitch rolled at all, demonstrating his belief that such a device <b>would</b> <b>only</b> make batting more difficult.|$|E
5|$|From {{the five}} on the shortlist, two sites were considered, the Cathays Park Building and Cardiff City Hall. Cardiff City Hall was favoured because the {{executive}} and legislative functions would be separated, Cardiff City Hall was more widely recognised by the Welsh public and was a more prestigious building compared with the Cathays Park Building. The move to Cardiff City Hall would have also avoided a disruptive move for Welsh Office staff at the Cathays Park Building. The Welsh Office concluded that Cardiff City Hall <b>would</b> <b>only</b> remain an option if the initial costs were £17M or less, which was the top end of the estimate figure given in the white paper. This <b>would</b> <b>only</b> be possible if essential works were carried out immediately and {{the remainder of the}} work carried out later. Cardiff Council would need to agree a selling price of £5M or less for this to be possible.|$|E

5|$|I {{had it in}} my head {{to write}} an epic of it, but though I still hanker after it, I see clearly it would be foolish, for no verse could render {{the best parts of}} it, and it <b>would</b> <b>only</b> be a flatter and tamer version of a thing already existing.|$|E
5|$|In 1953, the {{platforms}} at six Queens Boulevard Line stations, including 75th Avenue, were lengthened {{to allow}} eleven-car trains. The {{bid for the}} project went out in 1951.
