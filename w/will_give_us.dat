5|$|November 27, 1888: Petition {{from the}} King of Rurutu and the Queen of Rimatara and their nobles to Her Most Gracious Majesty Queen Victoria, {{and to the}} Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. May you have good health. We, Teuruarii, King of Rurutu and Te Maere, Queen of Rimatara and our nobles, ask for the Prime Minister to place our islands and our ships under the {{protection}} of the British flag. These are the islands, namely, Rurutu, Rimatara, and Marià, and there are the names of the ships: Faaito and Ronui, and the masters of the same are natives. This is our word to you: Do not forsake us; we are your children; you taught us the word of God, and that has led us in the path of civilisation; therefore we know that you are a good parent to us. The thoughts of the children cling fondly to their good parent; they do not wish to be separated from their good parent. If the parent forsake the children, the children will seek the parent; so do we; we are like those children, and we ask that you <b>will</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> your flag to protect us. We have heard that you have taken Rarotonga and the neighbouring islands under your protection, but we remain without anyone to protect us. When we received the news that Rarotonga and the neighbouring islands were placed under your protection, we wept aloud because we were forsaken by you; we were afraid lest we should be adopted by another parent. The strange parent we mean is the French. They did not feed us with the milk of the gospel, but you did. O Great Britain; you fed us with that milk which has given life to us. This is our last word to you; we do not wish for French annexation or protection, not at all, but we wish you to be our parent, O Great Britain. We pray you now to accede to this our request. This letter was written in the house of Queen Pa. -TEURUARII, TE MAERE ARII.|$|E

When Lincoln called Grant {{east in the}} spring of 1864 to take command of all the Union armies, Grant appointed Sherman (by then known to his soldiers as [...] "Uncle Billy") to succeed him as head of the Military Division of the Mississippi, which entailed command of Union troops in the Western Theater of the war. As Grant took overall command of the armies of the United States, Sherman wrote to him outlining his strategy to bring the war to an end concluding that [...] "if you can whip Lee and I can march to the Atlantic I think ol' Uncle Abe <b>will</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> twenty days leave to see the young folks." ...|$|E

Although {{still recovering from}} his wounds, for which {{he would continue to}} receive treatment until mid-1946, he attended a ceremony at the White House where President Harry S. Truman formally presented him with the medal. In addition to the Medal of Honor, Daly received three Silver Stars, a Bronze Star with [...] "V" [...] device, and two Purple Hearts. [...] Commenting on his Medal of Honor citation in a speech at Fairfield High School sometime later, Daly said, [...] "We all lose our courage at times.

500|$|Liverpool manager Benítez was {{confident}} that victory in the match would provide his side with a boost ahead of their opening match of the 2006–07 Premier League with Sheffield United: [...] "This <b>will</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> {{a lot of confidence}} I am sure, to play one of the best sides in the world and to beat them, this should give us more confidence going into what will be an interesting season." [...] He also defended his decision to players such as Gerrard and Alonso on the bench: [...] "It was my idea to start with the players that had the most fitness and have played the most minutes. Then I wanted to bring the other players on towards the end. It worked and it showed that we have a great squad – better than last season." [...] Crouch, scorer of the winning goal, was also confident the result would boost the Liverpool squad: [...] "There is a bit of rivalry between the sides and it is great to get an early one over them. Make no bones about it, this is a big game to win and it certainly could give us a psychological edge this season." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the start}} of the 2008–09 season, Myrie-Williams {{returned}} to Cheltenham Town, signing on a one-month loan deal on 14 August 2008. On bringing Myrie-Williams back to the club, Cheltenham manager Keith Downing said [...] "Jennison is an exciting young player who <b>will</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> some different options. We've perhaps been lacking a bit of pace and he <b>will</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> that as well". He made his second debut for the club four days later, scoring with a header in the 80th minute to ensure Cheltenham picked up their first win of the 2008–09 season with a 2–0 win against Swindon Town. Myrie-Williams made five appearances for Cheltenham during his one-month loan spell, scoring one goal. He returned to Bristol City on 15 September 2008. Shortly after returning to his parent club, Myrie-Williams was loaned out to another League One club, this time in the form of Carlisle United. Myrie-Williams stated that the move appealed to him because of manager John Ward, who he had played under at Cheltenham Town— [...] "We have kept in contact since I was at Cheltenham. He's a good manager and I enjoyed playing for him. I heard about a possible move in pre-season which came to nothing but I'm delighted to finally be here". He made his Carlisle debut on 20 September 2008, coming on as a 72nd-minute substitute in a 2–0 home defeat to Leeds United, a result that ended Carlisle's 100% home record. His loan spell was extended for another month on 15 October 2008. His final appearance for Carlisle was in the club's FA Cup 1–1 draw with Grays Athletic, a game in which Myrie-Williams was substituted after 59 minutes. He made 10 appearances during his two months at Carlisle. Myrie-Williams was loaned out for a third time during the 2008–09 season, his fifth loan spell in total, when he joined Hereford United in January 2009. He scored his first goal for Hereford on 17 February 2009 in the club's 2–0 home victory against Leeds United, scoring with a low shot to give Hereford the lead just before half-time. He returned to Bristol City after Hereford's 1–0 home loss against Peterborough United on 21 February 2009. A month later, Myrie-Williams rejoined Hereford {{until the end of the}} season. Myrie-Williams scored his second goal for Hereford in an away draw with Yeovil Town in April 2009. He made 15 appearances over the period of the two loan spells, scoring twice, as Hereford were relegated back to League Two after finishing bottom of the table.|$|E

Anthony stated, [...] "The character was invented for an explicitly political purpose. So it's hard to get away from that nature." [...] The Russos also said that they would be [...] "bringing some new elements to the table that <b>will</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> a twist on Winter Soldier", and indicated that filming was scheduled to begin in Atlanta. They described themselves as [...] "ecstatic" [...] with a first draft of the screenplay submitted by Markus and McFeely, and also {{stated that the}} film's title would be announced [...] "in a month or so at most", and that the concept and title for the film came from Feige, who had it [...] "for a while". In September, Joe expanded by saying the film would have another [...] "big idea that alters the universe as a whole in some way" [...] similar to S.H.I.E.L.D. falling in The Winter Soldier. The rest of the film, such as the characters, story, and tone, would be left open to the Russos' and writers' interpretations.|$|E

500|$|During Owumi's hiatus from basketball, {{his family}} {{encouraged}} {{him to return to}} the game, as it was his primary passion. Stanley Ocitti and Sherrad Prezzie-Blue, players who already knew Owumi, suggested Paul James, head coach of the Worcester Wolves of the British Basketball League (BBL), to look into him. In the summer of 2012, the Wolves signed Owumi, who would join Prezzie-Blue in the back court. James said, [...] " [...] distributes the ball well and <b>will</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> multiple options both on offense and defense." [...] The coach also described Owumi as a [...] "tough-nosed player." [...] The Nigerian guard had an immediate impact, recording a team-high 24 points, five rebounds, and three assists in his debut vs. the Durham Wildcats on September 22, 2012. He had another strong showing on January 25, 2013, when he put up 30 points in a loss to the Surrey Scorchers. On February 8, he led Worcester to an upset quarterfinal BBL Trophy win over the Newcastle Eagles with a season-high 34 points and nine rebounds. Owumi posted a double-double of 30 points, 16 of which were free throws, and ten rebounds in a defeat to the Manchester Giants on March 23. Through the BBL Championship and Play-offs, Owumi averaged 19.4 points, 6.6 rebounds, 3.9 assists, and 1.2 steals. In the season, he was named to the BBL Team of the Week First Team on six occasions. He also garnered all-league honorable mention and all-defensive honorable mention honors.|$|E
