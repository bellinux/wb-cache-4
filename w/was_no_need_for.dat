5|$|During {{the second}} half of the 16th century, Europeans' {{interest}} in the New World revolved around gold and silver and not tobacco. The European lack of interest in tobacco was due to the fact that the Amerindians controlled the tobacco industry; as long as the Amerindians controlled the supply there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> the incorporation in European commercial capitalism.|$|E
5|$|No {{official}} {{action was}} taken: Ireland was exporting food to Britain at the time. Also, Paul Emrys-Evans {{revealed that the}} convoy knew about the U-boat; the British stance was that, as it already knew {{of the presence of}} both Irish Oak and U-607, there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> Irish Oak to have warned the convoy.|$|E

The final hauled several wagons down to the coast for scrapping. The closing of the Rjukan Line also terminated operations on the Tinnoset Line, where passenger traffic had remained until 1991.|$|E

5|$|A {{few years}} later there was a debate between Heaviside and Peter Guthrie Tait about the {{relative}} merits of vector analysis and quaternions. The result was the realisation that there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> the greater physical insights provided by quaternions if the theory was purely local, and vector analysis became commonplace. Maxwell was proven correct, and his quantitative connection between light and electromagnetism {{is considered one of the}} great accomplishments of 19th century mathematical physics.|$|E

5|$|Irish {{zoologist}} Nicholas Aylward Vigors {{established the}} genus Platycercus in 1825, {{based on the}} distinctive architecture of the feathers in the tail and wing, including P. flavigaster and P. brownii within it. English naturalist James Francis Stephens named it Platycercus xanthogaster in 1826, though there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> a new binomial name. Australian amateur ornithologist Gregory Mathews noted that the name Platycercus flaviventris was commonly used in the 19th century, but highlighted the priority of both P. brownii and P. caledonicus over this, positing the last as the most senior name. He believed the specimens used for P. brownii had come from Derwent in Tasmania.|$|E
5|$|The Mikoyan-Gurevich I-211 was a {{prototype}} high-altitude Soviet fighter aircraft built during World War II. It was {{a version of}} the Mikoyan-Gurevich I-210, itself a variant of the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-3, fitted with a Shvetsov ASh-82F radial engine. Its development was quite prolonged, although successful, but by the time it finished its manufacturer's trials in early 1944 there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> a high-altitude fighter and it was not worth reducing the production of existing fighters to convert a factory over to the I-211.|$|E
5|$|The Minister {{had decided}} that the Jehovah's Witnesses' {{doctrine}} prohibiting its adherents from taking part in military service was contrary to national security and, thus, to public order and the public interest.

The appellants had not shown that the Minister had based his conclusions on false or unfounded facts; thus, unless the conclusions were irrelevant, the Court could not interfere with the Minister's opinion since his discretionary power had been exercised within statutory limitations.|$|E

5|$|There <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> the Mint {{to produce}} any pennies in 1933 because they was no {{commercial}} demand, and it possessed ample stocks from prior years in storage. There was a custom {{at that time}} for the King to place a set of coins of the current year under the foundation stone of important new buildings, and the Mint struck three 1933 pennies for this purpose, also one each for its own museum and for the British Museum, {{and at least two}} others. The result was a rarity that people thought might turn up in their pocket change, and that is probably the best-known British rare coin.|$|E
5|$|When the Chetnik leaders {{appointed}} by Draža Mihailović, Majors Boško Todorović and Dangić, {{became aware of}} the commencement of Operation Southeast Croatia, they advised other Chetnik commanders that the operation was targeted at the Partisans, and there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> the Chetniks to get involved. Following this, their units withdrew from their positions on the front line, let the Germans pass through their areas, or went home. Many withdrew across the Drina into German-occupied Serbia to avoid being engaged, which severely weakened the Partisan defences with the result that they suffered significant casualties and lost a great deal of territory. These actions severed any remaining cooperative links that remained between the Chetniks and Partisans in eastern Bosnia.|$|E
5|$|On April 4, 1991 H. John Heinz III, {{one of the}} US Senators from Pennsylvania, {{was killed}} when his {{chartered}} plane collided with a helicopter inspecting its landing gear. Under the Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, the legislature of each state {{has the power to}} permit the governor to fill the vacant seat until a special election can be held. In Pennsylvania, this power had been delegated, and Governor Robert P. Casey signed a writ on May 13, 1991, declaring November 5 the date for a special election and temporarily appointing Harris Wofford to fill Heinz's now-vacant seat. Under Pennsylvanian law, there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> a primary in such a situation; instead, both the Democrats and Republicans would each internally select their candidate, who would run in the special election. John S. Trinsey Jr., a member of the Pennsylvanian electorate and potential candidate, challenged the constitutionality of this law, claiming that it violated his rights under the Fourteenth and Seventeenth Amendments.|$|E

5|$|Play {{began after}} the tea break, and Australia needed to score 317 {{in the last}} session if they wanted victory. The pitch played very slowly due to the excess moisture, which meant the ball slowed {{significantly}} upon hitting the ground surface. As Australia were not looking to chase the runs, there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> run-saving fieldsmen, so Yardley often had seven men in close catching positions. In the first half hour, Australia showed little attacking intent and scored only six runs. Jack Young replaced Pollard and Johnson immediately swept him for four, before edging the next ball to Crapp and falling for six to leave Australia at 1/10. Australia batted for another two hours without further loss, to reach 1/92 from 61 overs before the match was finally ended {{after a series of}} periodic rain interruptions. Johnson had an unhappy game, scoring only seven runs in two innings, dropping a catch and taking match figures of 0/93.|$|E
5|$|As the {{composition}} is not precisely defined, some states {{which have a}} considerable division of executive power can {{find it difficult to}} decide who should attend the meetings. While an MEP, Alexander Stubb argued that there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> the President of Finland to attend Council meetings with or instead of the Prime Minister of Finland (who was head of European foreign policy). In 2008, having become Finnish Foreign Minister, Stubb was forced out of the Finnish delegation to the emergency council meeting on the Georgian crisis because the President wanted to attend the high-profile summit as well as the Prime Minister (only two people from each country could attend the meetings). This was despite Stubb being head of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe at the time which was heavily involved in the crisis. Problems also occurred in Poland where the President of Poland and the Prime Minister of Poland were of different parties and had a different foreign policy response to the crisis. A similar situation arose in Romania between President Traian Băsescu and Prime Minister Călin Popescu-Tăriceanu in 2007–2008 and again in 2012 with Prime Minister Victor Ponta, who both opposed the president.|$|E
5|$|The defence of the Isthmus of Corinth by the Allies {{changed the}} nature of the war. The Persians did not attempt to attack the isthmus by land, {{realising}} they probably could not breach it. This essentially reduced the conflict to a naval one. Themistocles now proposed what was in hindsight the strategic masterstroke in the Allied campaign; to lure the Persian fleet to battle in the straits of Salamis. However, as successful as this was, there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> the Persians to fight at Salamis to win the war; {{it has been suggested that}} the Persians were either overconfident, or overeager to finish the campaign. Thus, the Allied victory at Salamis must at least partially be ascribed to a Persian strategic blunder. After Salamis, the Persian strategy changed. Mardonius sought to exploit dissensions between the Allies in order to fracture the alliance. In particular, he sought to win over the Athenians, which would leave the Allied fleet unable to oppose Persian landings on the Peloponnesus. Although Herodotus tells us that Mardonius was keen to fight a decisive battle, his actions in the run-up to Plataea are not particularly consistent with this. He seems to have been willing to accept battle on his terms, but he waited either for the Allies to attack, or for the alliance to collapse ignominiously. The Allied strategy for 479 BC was something of a mess; the Peloponnesians only agreed to march north in order to save the alliance, and it appears that the Allied leadership had little idea how to force a battle that they could win. It was the botched attempt to retreat from Plataea that finally delivered the Allies battle on their terms. Mardonius may have been overeager for victory; there was no need to attack the Allies, and by doing so he played to the main Allied tactical strength, combat in the melee. The Allied victory at Plataea can also therefore be seen as partially the result of a Persian mistake.|$|E
