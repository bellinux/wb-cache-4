Ellis-Bextor stated that she released the song because [...] "it <b>was</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> with this single to push boundaries {{a little bit and}} part of that is explore a few musical directions that are a bit more unexpected, so it's been nice to release a ballad".|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written to not require Gillian Anderson at all. As a result, the {{finished}} episode only features stock footage of Scully from [...] "Within", and Anderson {{was not required}} to film any new scenes. Anderson later revealed that she was extremely grateful for this and other [...] "Doggett-centric" [...] episodes, because they provided her time {{to spend time with}} her daughter, Piper Maru, who was attending school in Canada. Anderson insisted that the show both understand her situation and make accommodations: in an interview, she explained, [...] "I was determined that they respect that I would work for three weeks and then have two or three weeks off to go and be with her. So they agreed to that, and that <b>was</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> I'd never had that before on the show." ...|$|E

[...] Goddard described [...] "Hand in Glove" [...] as [...] "a bleak proclamation of doomed happiness [...] a shattering left-hook of self-loathing, loss and desperation". Years later Morrissey considered the song to be the group's [...] "most special." [...] The singer said he was particularly proud of the song's second verse, which included the lines [...] "Though we may be hidden by rags/We have something they'll never have." [...] Morrissey {{explained that}} the verse described [...] "how I felt when I couldn't afford clothes and used to dress in rags but I didn't really feel mentally impoverished." ...|$|E

500|$|I {{wanted the}} words to reflect the {{architecture}} of the building. Its copper dome reminded me of the furnaces from Wales's industrial heritage and also Ceridwen's cauldron, from which the early poet Taliesin received his inspiration ('awen'). Awen suggests both poetic inspiration and the general creative vision by which people and societies form their aspirations. [...] It <b>was</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that the English words on the building should not simply be a translation of the Welsh, that they should have their own message. The strata of the slate frontage of the Wales Millennium Centre reminded me of the horizons just beyond Penarth Head. The sea has, traditionally, been for Cardiff the means by which the Welsh export their best to the world and the route by which the world comes to Cardiff. The stones inside the theatre literally sing with opera, musicals and orchestral music, and I wanted to convey the sense of an international space created by the art of music. —Gwyneth Lewis ...|$|E
500|$|Peart {{has often}} been {{categorized}} as an Objectivist and an admirer of Ayn Rand. This is largely based on his work with Rush in the 1970s, particularly the song [...] "Anthem" [...] and the album 2112; the latter specifically credited Rand's work. However, in his 1994 Rush Backstage Club Newsletter, while contending the [...] "individual is paramount in matters of justice and liberty," [...] Peart specifically distanced himself from a strictly Objectivist line. In a June 2012 Rolling Stone interview, when asked if Rand's words still speak to him, Peart replied, [...] "Oh, no. That was forty years ago. But it <b>was</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{at the time in}} a transition of finding myself and having faith that what I believed was worthwhile." [...] Peart has also ascribed to a philosophy that he has called [...] "Tryism," [...] which means that anything that one tries to attain will be attained if one tries hard enough.|$|E

Shooting in natural outdoor sets {{is very important to}} me, compared to working on a sound stage." [...] It took place in Germany, at the Babelsberg Studio in Potsdam-Babelsberg, in a filming location at an old forest near Berlin (production designer Stephen Scott said that he searched for and found what he believed looked like a [...] "medieval forest" [...] free of human interference) and in the city of Braunschweig in Lower Saxony. After the film was delayed to 2013, the crew did a [...] "couple" [...] of re-shoots, including [...] "a little bit" [...] in the deserts of California (filming the post-ending scene, an extended version of which was also released in a promotional clip [...] "The Desert Witch").|$|E

500|$|Several {{videos were}} {{intended}} to demonstrate the album's central theme of [...] "finding the beauty in imperfection". While working on [...] "Flawless", Beyoncé was reminded of her loss on television competition Star Search as a child, which she saw as a defining moment in her career, and believed that the competition had {{taught her how to}} embrace imperfection in the future. The theme was represented in the videos by the recurring use of trophies, which the singer saw as referencing [...] "all of the sacrifice I have made as a kid, all of the time that I lost". It was also carried into how the visuals were created, with the videos for [...] "Drunk in Love", [...] "Yoncé", [...] "No Angel", [...] "XO" [...] and [...] "Blue" [...] shot without prior preparation, as the singer found enjoyment in the spontaneity of the filming locations and in resisting the urge to perfect them. Noting some of the visuals' explicit content and exposure of her body, Beyoncé said she found shooting them liberating and expressed her intention to demonstrate sexuality as a power that women should have, and not lose after becoming a mother. She went on to say, [...] "I know finding my sensuality, getting back into my body, being proud of growing up, it <b>was</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that I expressed that... I know {{that there are so many}} women who feel the same way".|$|E
500|$|The film draws {{inspiration}} from the high demand for Christmas toys such as the Cabbage Patch Kids and Mighty Morphin Power Rangers in the late 1980s and early 1990s, which often led to intense searching and occasional violence amongst shoppers. Randy Kornfield wrote the film's original screenplay after witnessing his in-laws go to a Santa Monica toy store at dawn {{in order to get}} his son a Power Ranger. While admitting to missing the clamor for the Cabbage Patch Kids and Power Rangers, producer Chris Columbus experienced a similar situation in 1995 when he attempted to obtain a Buzz Lightyear action figure from the film Toy Story, released that year. As a result, he rewrote Kornfield's script, which was accepted by 20th Century Fox. Columbus was always [...] "attracted to {{the dark side of the}} happiest holiday of the year", so wrote elements of the film as a satire of the commercialization of Christmas. Brian Levant was hired to direct the film. Columbus said Levant [...] "underst the humor in the material" [...] and [...] "was very animated and excited, and he had a vision of what he wanted to do". Levant said [...] "The story that <b>was</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> was between the father and son...it's a story about love, and a father's journey to deliver it in the form of a Turbo Man doll. The fact that I got to design a toy line and do the commercials and make pajamas and comic books was fun for me as a filmmaker. But at its root, the movie's about something really sweet. It's about love and building a better family. I think that's consistent with everything I've done." ...|$|E
500|$|Principal {{photography}} {{took place}} in Vancouver, British Columbia in April 2009, and lasted for approximately 67 days. Many filming locations were established in Downtown Vancouver and its surroundings. Stage shooting for the film {{took place at the}} Canadian Motion Picture Park studio in Burnaby, an adjacent city that forms part of Metro Vancouver. Kosinski devised and constructed twelve to fifteen of the film's sets, including Kevin Flynn's safe house, a creation he illustrated on a napkin for a visual effects test. [...] "I wanted to build as much as possible. It <b>was</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that this world feel real, and anytime I could build something I did. So I hired guys that I went to architecture school with to work on the sets for this film, and hopefully people who watch the film feel like there’s a certain physicality to this world that hopefully they appreciate, knowing that real architects actually put this whole thing together." [...] The film was shot in dual camera 3D using Pace Fusion rigs like James Cameron's Avatar, but unlike the Sony F950 cameras on that film, Tron used the F35s. [...] "The benefit of ," [...] according to director Kosinski, [...] "is that it has a full 35mm sensor which gives you that beautiful cinematic shallow depth of field." [...] The film's beginning portions were shot in 2D, while forty minutes of the film were vertically enhanced for IMAX. Digital Domain was contracted to work on the visual effects, while companies such as Prime Focus Group, DD Vancouver, and Mr. X were brought on to collaborate with producer on the post-production junctures of Tron: Legacy. Post-production wrapped on November 25, 2010.|$|E

And in our film you get to see him for real." [...] He {{went on to say that}} his Godzilla remains true to the original in all aspects.

2500|$|Guadagnino has {{described}} Call Me By Your Name as a family-oriented film {{for the purpose}} of [...] "transmission of knowledge and hope that people of different generations come to see the film together." [...] He never saw it as a [...] "gay" [...] movie, but rather calls it a film about the [...] "beauty of the newborn idea of desire, unbiased and uncynical," [...] and reflects his motto of living [...] "with a sense of joie de vivre." [...] The director attempted to avoid the flaws he had seen in most coming-of-age films, in which growth is often portrayed as a result of resolving certain preconceived dilemmas, like choosing between two lovers. He also wanted the story to follow two people in the moment, rather than focus on an antagonist or a tragedy, a specific approach inspired by À Nos Amours (1983), directed by Maurice Pialat. As someone who considers sex in film a representation of the characters' behavior and identity, Guadagnino wasn't interested in including explicit sex scenes in the film, {{in order to keep the}} tone as planned, saying, [...] "I wanted the audience to completely rely on the emotional travel of these people and feel first love [...] It <b>was</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> to create this powerful universality, because the whole idea of the movie is that the other person makes you beautiful — enlightens you, elevates you." ...|$|E

The emerging detailing in electro music, as Roberts described it was something she wanted present in the artwork, whilst talking to Rolling Stone she said [...] "I wanted that rhythm to be present in the imagery, the way I pictured it.
