40|$|Introduction: Dental {{implants}} {{are increasingly}} used to restore missing dentition. These titanium implants are surgically {{installed in the}} edentulous alveolar ridge and allowed to osteointegrate with the bone during the healing phase. After osseo-integration, the implant is loaded with a prosthesis to replace the missing tooth. Conventional implant treatment planning uses study models, <b>wax-ups</b> and panoramic x-rays to prefabricate surgical stent to guide th...|$|E
40|$|Recently, digital wax-up is {{proposed}} {{as a tool}} to aid prosthodontic planning. However, there are no data about the effect of prosthodontic planning on lateral occlusion scheme. Objective : This study aims to evaluate the impact of conventional and digital prosthodontic planning on lateral occlusion scheme. Material and Methods : Dental models of 10 patients were collected. All models had Angle Class I occlusion and were undergoing prosthodontic treatment that would influence the lateral occlusion scheme. Each set of models had received both conventional wax-up and digital wax-up. In relation to the lateral occlusion scheme, the following variables were evaluated: the prevalence of the different lateral occlusion scheme, number of contacting teeth and percentage of each contacting tooth. Four excursive positions on the working side were included: 0. 5, 1. 0, 2. 0 and 3. 0 mm from the maximal intercuspation position. Results : The lateral occlusion scheme of the two wax-up models was subjected to alterations following excursion. There was a tendency for the prevalence of canine-guided occlusion to increase and for the prevalence of group function occlusion to decrease with increasing excursion. The number of contacting teeth was decreasing with the increasing magnitude of excursion. For the 0. 5 mm and 1. 0 mm positions, the two <b>wax-ups</b> had significantly greater contacts than the pre-treatment models, while at the 2. 0 mm and 3. 0 mm positions, all the models were similar. For all models, canines were the most commonly contacting teeth, followed by the teeth adjacent to them. No difference was observed between the two <b>wax-ups</b> in relation to the number of contacting teeth. Conclusion : Although the prosthodontic planning had influenced the pattern of the lateral occlusion scheme and contacts, {{there was no difference between}} the conventional and digital prosthodontic planning...|$|E
30|$|The {{indication}} for augmentation of the alveolar ridge defect {{was evaluated}} {{on the basis}} of a clinical examination with oral inspection and the use of dental casts and a radiological examination using panoramic radiographs to observe the height and width of the alveolar ridge and to identify structures of risk like the mandibular canal or the maxillary sinus. Three-dimensional radiographs had been used when clinical examination and two-dimensional radiographs were not sufficient to prove alveolar ridge dimensions. In 30.8 % (83 / 279 patients), preoperative 3 D CT examination had to be performed to assess the need and volume of bony reconstruction needed prior to implant insertion. All patients were informed in advance that bone grafting was necessary prior to implant placement because of the inadequate bone quality. Occlusal analysis was performed, diagnostic <b>wax-ups</b> were prepared on the articulated casts, and restorative treatment needs to be determined.|$|E

40|$|Background and Aims: Since a large {{marginal}} opening allows more plaque accumulation, gingival sulcular {{fluid flow}} and bone loss, microleakage, recurrent caries and periodontal disease, marginal fit {{is of great}} importance in fixed restorations. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the marginal fit of zirconium-based all ceramic (Cercon) frameworks, made by two different approaches (Direct and <b>Wax-up</b> scanning). Materials and Methods: An abutment analog, with 5. 5 mm width and height, was selected as an experimental model. Twenty all ceramic cores were made for this model (10 specimens per each group). In the first group (Direct), experimental models were scanned directly using Computer Aided Design/Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAD/CAM). The core was then designed with the aid of a computer and machined. In the second group (<b>Wax-up</b> or CAM) a <b>wax-up</b> pattern was made on the experimental model and then scanned and milled from Cercon blocks. The marginal discrepancy of each specimen was recorded using a stereomicroscope (SZX 9, Olympus, Japan) and digital camera (Mode TK, C 1380 E, JVC, Japan) and then measured by Adobe Photoshop CS software. The data were analyzed using T-test. Results: Mean marginal discrepancy of Direct group (85. 2 ± 3. 95 µm) was significantly less than that of <b>Wax-up</b> group (120. 2 ± 6. 91 µm). Conclusion: Improved marginal fit of zirconia ceramics was found with the direct model scanning compared with that of <b>Wax-up</b> scanning using CAD/CAM...|$|R

Methods: we have studied a patient aged 72. Maxillary and mandibular impressions were obtained from the patient and placed on the average value articulator using <b>wax-ups</b> and a facial arch in order to perform the Bennett angle measurations by such device. CT measurements were carried out using templates in order to block the Patient in the correct mandibular position. Results: our study has demonstrated that the measurements of the Bennett angle obtained with the average value articulator are consistent with the ones obtained with the 64 slices CT. Conclusions: CT scanning is a useful method, alternative to conventional procedures, as the average value articulator for Bennett angle measurements, and it could become an important diagnostic tool in the gnathological and rehabilitative area...|$|E
30|$|Of the {{problems}} and issues generally encountered on the laboratory side, compatibility precision, aesthetic issues, and occlusal issues each accounted for about {{one third of the}} total (Q 9). When these results are examined in connection with laboratory challenges (Q 10) (Figure  5), it becomes clear that technicians regard poor implant location and orientation (42.4 %) as obstacles to success. Many other issues derived from factors such as dentists’ skill level and treatment planning knowledge are directly related to quality implant treatment, such as defects and inaccuracies in impression-taking and bite registration (29 %), inadequate establishment of appropriate occlusal schemes (17 %), and deficient or unreasonable prosthesis design (10.6 %). These issues can easily give rise to a variety of prosthetic complications after initiating functional use (and may also lead to biological complications), and dentists who offer dental implant treatment should reflect on improving their techniques. In particular, unsuitable implant locations, positions, and orientations can be prevented through appropriate preoperative examination and planning based on diagnostic <b>wax-ups</b> and surgical templates.|$|E
40|$|When {{a patient}} {{presents}} with a partially edentulous arch, fixed res-toration of the arch supported by dental implants and natural teeth requires proper planning and provisionalization. First, information must be obtained to help plan {{the case for}} function and aesthetics. Study models must be articulated so that the present occlusal relationship can be analyzed. Diagnostic <b>wax-ups</b> and intraoral waxups or diagnostic appliances must be utilized to evaluate aesthetics and phonetics. 1 A detailed periodontal evaluation should be performed to determine which teeth can be saved for fixed prosthetic support. Radiographs including periapicals, panographs, and CT scans {{must be taken to}} evaluate the osseous support for dental implants. Interactive CT scans with radiographic guides offer detailed information with regard to implant placement related to tooth position and aesthetics. 2 Once it is determined which teeth can be saved and an overall plan is made for fixed prosthetics, it then must be decided how the case will be provisionalized during the treatment period. Most patients prefer a fixed provisional over a removable one due to stability, aesthetics, and less interference of speech patterns. There are many advantages to a laboratory-processed fixed provisional versus a chairside-produced provisional prosthesis. 3 These advantages include improved aesthetics, smoother surface areas, increased strength, and reduced chair time compared to a chairside produced provisional. Patient feedback about the provisional is also an important step in helping guide the final prosthesis toward an ideal aesthetic and functional outcome...|$|E

By applying the harmony of artistic skill, scientific knowledge and clinical expertise, we can simply master the outstanding implant success in requisites of aesthetics, phonetics and function...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the occlusal {{morphology}} of partial crown reconstructions made by dental technicians with reconstructions made by a fully automatic software process (biogeneric tooth model) in relation to the original natural tooth shape. Material and methods: Stone replicas of natural teeth were measured three-dimensionally before preparing inlay and onlay cavities for ceramic restorations (n[*]=[*] 5). For each preparation, five reconstructions (in total n[*]=[*] 25) were made by five dental technicians. Additionally, reconstructions were calculated automatically by a software based on the biogeneric tooth model (Cerec 3 D). In order to compare the two different kinds of reconstruction, an objective metrical similarity measure (shape similarity value, SSV) based on calculated volumes between compared datasets was used. Results: In 22 of 25 cases, the reconstructions made by the CAD software were closer to the original situation than the reconstructions made by the technicians. Mean average SSV of reconstructions made by the technicians (310. 2 [*]±[*] 78. 8 μm) was significantly higher (p[*]<[*] 0. 05) than mean SSV of CAD reconstructions (biogeneric model) (222. 0 [*]±[*] 47. 7 μm). Conclusions: In the design of naturally shaped occlusal inlay/onlay surfaces, a fully automatic CAD system can be at least as good as conventional <b>wax-ups</b> by dental technicians. Clinical relevance: The adjustment of a dental restoration to fit the morphology of surrounding tooth structures, still presents challenges for the dentist...|$|E
40|$|The use {{of dental}} {{implants}} in the maxillary anterior region to replace missing teeth {{is a viable}} treatment option (Figure 1). There are many benefits of fixed dental implant-supported prosthetics versus traditional crown and bridge or removable tooth-borne prosthetics. 1 Maintenance of residual bone, ease of oral hygiene, increased longevity, and noninvolvement of adjacent teeth are a few advantages of using dental implants. In order to provide successful and aesthetic dental implant treatment, certain clinical parameters must be met. This is particularly true in the anterior maxilla, where the teeth and their supporting structures are readily visible. Successful implant treatment to replace missing teeth in the anterior maxilla requires preoperative planning and a specific surgical plan, and ultimately prostheses are fabricated in consideration of function and soft-tissue support. 2 Technical expertise is also essential. Treatment planning must consider the final prosthetic result, so that implant surgery can be tailored to fulfill the preplanned objectives. Unless {{the position of the}} final prosthesis is visualized prior to surgery, the placement of the dental implants may not allow the desired end result to be achieved. 3 Data that must be obtained to allow development of a proper treatment plan include probing depths and attachment levels for all remaining teeth, assessment of soft-tissue architecture, radiographic studies, study models, diagnostic <b>wax-ups,</b> and a comprehensive medical and dental history. Preoperative planning may indicate the need for an improved hard- and soft-tissue foundation prior to implant placement.

40|$|Purpose: Decimated dentitions {{may require}} raising the {{vertical}} dimension in some conditions while performing a full mouth rehabilitation treatment. Increase in a vertical dimension should be diagnosed by reversible methods prior to performing any irreversible methods {{for a minimum}} time period.

40|$|Diagnostics are {{essential}} for predictable restorative dentistry. Both patient and clinician must agree on a treatment goal before the final restorations are delivered to avoid future disappointments. However, fully understanding the patient's desires is difficult.

40|$|The {{indications}} {{for direct}} resin composite restorations are nowadays extended {{due to the}} development of modern resin materials with improved material properties. However, there are still some difficulties regarding handling of resin composite material, especially in large restorations. The reconstruction of a functional and individual occlusion is difficult to achieve with direct application techniques. The aim of the present publication was to introduce a new "stamp"-technique for placing large composite restorations. The procedure of this "stamp"-technique is presented by three typical indications: large single-tooth restoration, occlusal rehabilitation of a compromised occlusal surface due to erosions and direct fibre-reinforced fixed partial denture. A step-by-step description of the technique and clinical figures illustrates the method. Large single-tooth restorations can be built-up with individual, two- piece silicone stamps. Large occlusal abrasive and/or erosive defects can be restored by copying the <b>wax-up</b> from the dental technician using the "stamp"-technique. Even fiber-reinforced resin-bonded fixed partial dentures can be formed with this intraoral technique with more precision and within a shorter treatment time. The presented "stamp"-technique facilitates the placement of large restoration with composite and can be recommended for the clinical use.

Presentation of Case: A 40 -year-old female patient complaining of cosmetic dental problems reported to the School of Dentistry at Franca University (UNIFRAN). After a clinical examination and radiographic imaging, it was determined that the patient was partially edentulous with vertical maxillary excess with excessive gingival display when smiling. A diagnostic <b>wax-up</b> was performed to determine the ideal position of the anterior teeth in relation to proper oral posture at rest, to the smile line, and to the bone level. In light of the ideal position of the anterior teeth for reducing gingival display when smiling, it was decided to remove the remaining teeth and perform a maxillary ostectomy. After performing the pre-prosthetic surgery, six implants were installed in the remaining maxillary bone, and a provisional conventional complete denture was installed and left in position until the osseointegration period. Later, a complete arch fixed implant-supported prosthesis was manufactured, since the prosthesis–tissue junction was above to the high smile line.

Patients with minimum, moderate, and severe hard tissue wear can be treated based on the application of minimally in- vasive adhesive composite restorations for posterior and anterior worn dentition. This article presents the “index tech- nique”, a new and very conservative ap- proach to the management of worn den- tition. The technique allows for a purely additive treatment without sacrificing healthy hard tooth tissue. It follows the principles of bioeconomics (maximum conservation of healthy tissue) and the reinforcing of residual dental structure. Depending on the severity of enamel and dentin wear, the number of caries, and the size of existing restorations, dif- ferent treatment options can be applied to each tooth: direct and indirect partial restorations, or full crowns. It is essential to diagnose and treat tooth-surface loss in order to properly restore biomechan- ics, function, and esthetics by means of adhesive restorations. This article proposes that the index technique is a fast and conservative approach for the planning and management of a full- mouth adhesive treatment in all cases of worn dentition. The technique is based on stamping composite directly on the tooth surface by means of a transpar- ent index created from the full-mouth <b>wax-up</b> following an initially planned increase in occlusal vertical dimension (OVD) ...|$|R
