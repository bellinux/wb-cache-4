500|$|In March 2008, Bleeding Through {{announced}} Declaration as {{the title}} of its fifth studio release, a concept album about the rigors of being away from home. The band's frontman and lyricist Brandan Schieppati explained to Revolver in the magazine's May 2008 issue, [...] "There are definitely places when we're traveling where every time we go there, we're like, 'Fuck, <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to be here?'

500|$|Despite general favor from female viewers' perspective, {{reaction}} from most male viewers was negative. The music video {{was presented to}} a crowd during a promotional party at the Chelsea nightclub Centro-Fly, thrown in celebration of Voodoos January 2000 release. According to a New York Times correspondent, one female viewer at the party [...] "recalled sitting at home, staring at the video, while her boyfriend snapped, 'Turn the channel — I don't {{want to see that}} gay stuff'". D'Angelo made an appearance at the WQHT Hot 97 studio as the DJ's Angie Martinez and Funkmaster Flex fielded calls from listeners about the video. Tracy Cloherty, program director for the radio station at the time, later commented on the divided reaction to the music video in an interview for The New York Times in 2000, stating [...] "Of course, most of the women loved it. Some of the men said things like: 'We don't wanna see that kind of stuff. <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to look at that?' Men definitely seem to be threatened by male nudity". Some viewers and music writers have attributed the male discomfort of the video to fear of male sexual objectification and homophobia. In a 2000 phone interview for The New York Times, D'Angelo maintained a neutral attitude towards general viewer opinion of the video, stating [...] "With men, if there's any negative reaction, I'm not really going to get an honest feedback ... women love it, most definitely. But for me personally, the response I've got from both men and women has been pretty cool".|$|E

40|$|I {{start with}} the question: Why is the {{national}} government so large? Or, perhaps, <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> that long security line at this conference the other night? They might be related questions. There are three possible explanations. One reason might be that problems are big and getting bigger problems of international terror, nuclear proliferation, a complex economy, threats to the environment. If the problems are big and complex, bigger government is a likely response in the modem era. A second possible reason is that we the people want bigger government, perhaps for the first reason, perhaps {{for a variety of}} reasons. Hence, we are willing to accept long lines, etc., because we want the government to regulate. A third possible reason, maybe in combination with the other two, is that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> big government because of dysfunction. In other words, <b>we</b> might <b>have</b> big government because of logrolling and compromising in the legislature, because of special interests, as in the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act {{and a number of other}} pieces of legislation, trading off with one another so that the overall size of government gets bigger and bigger as each group is paid off in its own rent-seeking way. Another dysfunctional reason to consider is turf grabbing by federal government agencies. That might be one reason why <b>we</b> <b>have</b> so many security lines. These are possible reasons for our big government, and some of them might be all right, but most are lamentable...|$|R

(2003), {{traces the}} nature of the work day from the prehistoric {{hunter-gatherer}} to the modern day citizen whose specialized tasks, such as designing video games or working on an assembly line, may seem to have less of a direct link to providing for survival. The book examines how this transformation occurred, and takes a philosophical look at the varied reasons why people do what they do for a living, which include the pursuit of wealth and status to the pursuit of personal fulfillment, inner calling, and spiritual happiness. In this book, Gates traces the link between the work of the two eras, and suggests a guideline for an “alternative measure of success”. In 2006, it was reissued as Hunting, Gathering, and Videogames.|$|E
