5|$|The {{rejection}} likely {{had several}} causes. The {{people of the}} Grants <b>were</b> <b>tired</b> of the disputes with New York, and they <b>were</b> <b>tired</b> of Allen's posturing and egotistic behavior, which the success at Ticonderoga had enhanced. Finally, {{the failure of the}} attempt on St. John's was widely seen as reckless and ill-advised, attributes they did not appreciate in a regimental leader. Warner was viewed as a more stable and quieter choice, and was someone that also commanded respect. The history of Warner's later actions in the revolution (notably at Hubbardton and Bennington) may be seen as a confirmation of the choice made by the Dorset meeting. In the end, Allen took the rejection in stride, and managed to convince Schuyler and Warner to permit him to accompany the regiment as a civilian scout.|$|E
5|$|After {{a two-month}} hiatus, on the November 30 episode of Raw, Carlito {{returned}} to confront John Cena, after Cena challenged Sheamus {{to come out}} to the ring, telling him everyone on the roster <b>were</b> <b>tired</b> of him and that Sheamus was their representative of what the roster believed and then tried to spit apple in Cena's face, which led to him getting hit with Cena's finisher, the Attitude Adjustment. The following week, Carlito was defeated by Cena.|$|E
5|$|Subsequently, he was demoted to {{the minor}} leagues to develop {{secondary}} pitches. From 2010 until 2012, his role on the big-league squad frequently fluctuated, but overall, was an underrated member of the pitching staff, according to several writers. Nevertheless, he drew the ire of Phillies fans, who <b>were</b> <b>tired</b> of his inconsistency {{during the course of}} his career. After a successful 2012 campaign, however, he firmly implanted himself in the Phillies' starting rotation before the 2013 season. Again in 2013, though, he was inconsistent, and entering 2014, some suggested he should be traded to another team.|$|E

5|$|Pros had the Buffalo All-Americans {{as their}} next opponent. The All-Americans <b>were</b> <b>tired</b> from their 7 to 3 {{victory against the}} Canton Bulldogs the day before. Before {{the start of the}} game, Nash was sold to the All-Americans for $300 and 5% of the Akron-Buffalo gate, making the first deal in APFA history. The reason for the trade was because rain caused a low number of fans. However, Nash did not appear in the game for either team, and Scotty Bierce {{replaced}} Nash for the Pros. The rain caused sloppy game play as well as a small crowd of 3,000 people. It resulted in a 0–0 tie.|$|E
5|$|The next {{match was}} against Surrey {{and started the}} day after the Second Test. As the Test players <b>were</b> <b>tired,</b> Bradman gave them a lighter {{workload}} and assigned Hamence and Loxton to open the bowling. Both took two wickets and Hamence snared opposing captain Laurie Fishlock and Eric Bedser to end with 2/24. Brown injured a finger while fielding, so {{he was not able to}} bat in Australia's first innings. Hamence was thus elevated to open the batting. Hamence made a duck, but Australia nevertheless took a 168-run lead. Hamence opened the bowling for the second time, although he was unable to take a wicket and ended with 0/30. In the second innings, Harvey volunteered to play as a makeshift opener alongside Loxton and they chased down the 122 runs for victory in less than an hour to complete a 10-wicket win.|$|E
5|$|One year later, the feudal {{families}} of the Sasanian Empire, who <b>were</b> <b>tired</b> of war against the Byzantines and Khosrow's oppressive policies, freed Khosrow's son Kavadh, who had been imprisoned by his own father. The feudal families included: Shahrbaraz himself, who represented the Mihran family; the House of Ispahbudhan represented by spahbed Farrukh Hormizd and his two sons Rostam Farrokhzad and Farrukhzad; the Armenian faction represented by Varaztirots II Bagratuni; and finally the Kanarang. In February, Kavadh, along with Aspad Gushnasp, captured Ctesiphon and imprisoned Khosrow II. Kavadh II then proclaimed himself as king of the Sasanian Empire on 25 February, and {{with the aid of}} Piruz Khosrow, executed all his brothers and half-brothers, including Khosrow II's favorite son Mardanshah. Three days later, he ordered Mihr Hormozd to execute his father. With the agreement of the nobles of the Sasanian empire, Kavadh then made peace with the Byzantine emperor Heraclius; under the terms of this peace, the Byzantines regained all their lost territories, their captured soldiers, a war indemnity, along with the True Cross and other relics that were lost in Jerusalem in 614.|$|E

5|$|The All-Americans had the Akron Pros {{as their}} next opponent. The All-Americans <b>were</b> <b>tired</b> from their {{victory against the}} Canton Bulldogs the day before. Before {{the start of the}} game, Bob Nash of Akron was sold to the All-Americans for $300 and 5% of the Akron-Buffalo gate, making the first deal in APFA history.

However, Nash did not appear in the game for either team, and Scotty Bierce replaced Nash for the Pros. The rain caused sloppy game play as well as a small crowd of 3,000 people. The All-Americans had an opportunity to score in the final minutes of the game. Fritz Pollard fumbled the ball, and Heinie Miller recovered it. Buffalo had the ball on the 12-yard-line, but the officials called the end of the game. It resulted in a 0–0 tie.|$|E
5|$|The Germans quickly {{developed}} {{a series of}} basic tactics for intercepting enemy intruders. The lack of airborne radar {{at this stage in}} the war meant finding and destroying Allied bombers at night was a difficult prospect, thus it was decided to use the Fernnachtjagd in operations over Britain. Major Kuhlmann, head of the wireless telegraphy interception service played a significant part in assisting the Luftwaffe night fighter force as did Wolfgang Martini's Luftnachrichtentruppe (Air Signal Corps). Intercepting British signal communications by monitoring the radio traffic of enemy ground stations and aircraft the Germans could determine where and at what airfields RAF night activity was occurring. With the British base identified Falck could then move against them over their own airfields. Three waves could then be deployed; one to attack the bombers as they took off, one to cover the known routes taken by the enemy over the North Sea, and the third to attack them on landing at a time when, after a long flight, enemy crews <b>were</b> <b>tired</b> and much less alert. For operational purposes, Eastern England was divided into four regions or Räume (areas). Raum A was Yorkshire, bounded by Hull, Leeds, Lancaster and Newcastle. Raum B covered the Midlands and Lincolnshire whilst Raum C encompassed East Anglia bounded by London Peterborough, Luton and The Wash. Operations began in earnest in October 1940.|$|E

25|$|A common view {{holds that}} 138,708 Allied {{personnel}} surrendered or {{were killed by}} fewer than 30,000 Japanese. However, the former figure includes nearly 50,000 troops captured or killed during the Battle of Malaya, and perhaps 15,000 base troops. Many of the other troops <b>were</b> <b>tired</b> and under-equipped following their retreat from the Malayan peninsula. Conversely, the latter number represents only the front-line troops available for the invasion of Singapore. British Empire battle casualties since 8 December amounted to 7,500 killed and 11,000 wounded. Japanese losses totalled around 3,500 killed and 6,100 wounded.|$|E
