25|$|Machinability can be {{difficult}} to predict because machining has so many variables. Two sets of factors are the condition of work materials and the physical properties of work materials. The condition of the <b>work</b> <b>material</b> includes eight factors: microstructure, grain size, heat treatment, chemical composition, fabrication, hardness, yield strength, and tensile strength. Physical properties are those of the individual material groups, such as the modulus of elasticity, thermal conductivity, thermal expansion, and work hardening. Other important factors are operating conditions, cutting tool material and geometry, and the machining process parameters.|$|E
2500|$|The Association of Foreign News Correspondents in Venezuela {{accused the}} {{government}} of assaulting reporters. The National Union of Journalists (SNTP) in Venezuela has said there has been at least 181 attacks on journalists {{in the first few}} months of 2014 and that there has been [...] "82 cases of harassment, 40 physical assaults, 35 robberies or destruction of the <b>work</b> <b>material,</b> 23 arrests and a bullet wound" [...] and that at least 20 attacks were performed by [...] "colectivos". The National Institute of Journalists (CNP) stated that 262 attacks on the press occurred between February to June 2014. According to El Nacional, the Bolivarian National Intelligence Service (SEBIN) had raided facilities of reporters and human rights defenders several times. It was also stated that SEBIN occasionally intimidated reporters by following them in unmarked vehicles where SEBIN personnel would [...] "watch their homes and offices, the public places like bakeries and restaurants, and would send them text messages to their cell phones".|$|E
2500|$|Serra studied {{painting}} in the M.F.A. program at the Yale University School of Art and Architecture between 1961 and 1964. Fellow Yale Art and Architecture alumni of the 1960s include the painters, photographers, and sculptors Brice Marden, Chuck Close, Nancy Graves, Gary Hudson and Robert Mangold. [...] He claims to have taken most of his inspiration from the artists who taught there, most notably Philip Guston and the experimental composer Morton Feldman, as well as designer Josef Albers. With Albers, he worked on his book Interaction of Color (1963). He continued his training abroad, spending a year each in Florence and Paris. [...] In 1964, he was awarded a Fulbright Scholarship for Rome, where he lived and worked with his first wife, sculptor Nancy Graves. Since then, he has lived in New York, where he first used rubber in 1966 and began applying his characteristic <b>work</b> <b>material</b> lead in 1968. In New York, his circle of friends included Carl Andre, Walter De Maria, Eva Hesse, Sol LeWitt, and Robert Smithson. At one point, to fund his art, Serra started a furniture-removals business, Low-Rate Movers, and employed Chuck Close, Philip Glass, Spalding Gray, and others.|$|E

60|$|Man accumulates {{property}} and bequeaths {{it to his}} children, so that {{the children of the}} rich have an advantage over the poor in the race for success, independently of bodily or mental superiority. On the other hand, the children of parents who are short-lived, and are therefore on an average deficient in health and vigour, come into their property sooner than other children, and will be likely to marry earlier, and leave a larger number of offspring to inherit their inferior constitutions. But the inheritance of property by itself is very far from an evil; for without the accumulation of capital the arts could not progress; and it is chiefly through their power that the civilised races have extended, and are now everywhere extending their range, so as {{to take the place of}} the lower races.

A ductile cast iron containing 3. 6 % C, 2. 6 % Si and 0. 045 % Mg was continuously hot-and-warm rolled or one-step press-forged from a temperature in the austenite range (900 {degrees}C- 1100 {degrees}C) to a temperature below the A, temperature. Various amounts of reduction were used (from 60 % to more than 90 %) followed by a short heat ent at 600 `C. The heat ent lead to a structure of fine graphite in a matrix of ferrite and carbides. The hot-and- warm <b>worked</b> <b>materials</b> developed a pearlitic microstructure while the press-forged material developed a spheroidite-like carbide microstructure in the matrix. Cementite-denuded ferrite zones were developed around graphite stringers in the hot-and-warm <b>worked</b> <b>materials,</b> but such zones were absent in the press-forged material. Tensile properties including tensile strength and total elongation were measured along the direction parallel and transverse to the rolling direction and along the direction transverse to the press-forging direction.

40|$|The plasma-based {{electron}} beam (PBEB) irradiation {{with a maximum}} diameter of 60 mm {{has been used to}} smoothen the workpiece surface. After PBEB irradiation, the machined surface roughness is reduced, and its corrosion resistance is improved. However, for die and tool steels, some craters still exist on the surface after PBEB irradiation, which remain a big problem for the roughness improvement and quality control of the machined surfaces. In this study, four types of <b>work</b> <b>materials</b> have been tested during PBEB irradiation. The effects of non-metallic inclusions (MnS and carbide) and impurities on the generation of craters were investigated. In addition, craters formed on the <b>work</b> <b>materials</b> with different nitrogen concentrations have also been observed after PBEB irradiation. Finally, a case study is given, and it is found that PBEM irradiation can achieve good surface finish of die steel materials. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
