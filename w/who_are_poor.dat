The risk is greater in those <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>poor,</b> {{although}} it is not clear if this is due to poverty itself or other risk factors associated with poverty, such as air pollution and malnutrition. There is tentative evidence that those with asthma and airway hyperreactivity are at increased risk of COPD. Birth factors such as low birth weight may also play a role as do a number of infectious diseases including HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis. Respiratory infections such as pneumonia do not appear to increase the risk of COPD, at least in adults.|$|E
5|$|In 2013 lead is {{believed}} to have resulted in 853,000 deaths. It occurs most commonly in the developing world. Those <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>poor</b> are at greater risk. Lead {{is believed}} to result in 0.6% of the world's disease burden. People have been mining and using lead for thousands of years. Descriptions of lead poisoning date to at least 2000 BC, while efforts to limit lead's use date back to at least the 1500s. Concerns for low levels of exposure begin in the 1970s with there being no safe threshold for lead exposure.|$|E
5|$|Inspired by {{the works}} of Gogol, Pushkin, and Karamzin, as well as English and French authors, Poor Folk is written {{in the form of}} letters between the two main characters, Makar Devushkin and Varvara Dobroselova, <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>poor</b> second cousins. The novel showcases the life of poor people, their {{relationship}} with rich people, and poverty in general, all common themes of literary naturalism. A deep but odd friendship develops between them until Dobroselova loses her interest in literature, and later in communicating with Devushkin after a rich widower Mr. Bykov proposes to her. Devushkin, a prototype of the clerk found in many works of naturalistic literature at that time, retains his sentimental characteristics; Dobroselova abandons art, while Devushkin cannot live without literature.|$|E

25|$|Excessive {{doses of}} escitalopram usually cause {{relatively}} minor untoward effects such as agitation and tachycardia. However, dyskinesia, hypertonia, and clonus may occur in some cases. Plasma escitalopram concentrations are {{usually in a}} range of 20–80 μg/L in therapeutic situations and may reach 80–200 μg/L in the elderly, patients with hepatic dysfunction, those <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>poor</b> CYP2C19 metabolizers or following acute overdose. Monitoring of the drug in plasma or serum is generally accomplished using chromatographic methods. Chiral techniques are available to distinguish escitalopram from its racemate, citalopram. Escitalopram seems to be less dangerous than citalopram in overdose and comparable to other SSRIs.|$|E

25|$|Gan Eng Seng School {{was founded}} in some shophouses in Telok Ayer Street in 1885 by the philanthropist, Gan Eng Seng and was known as Anglo Chinese Free School. Born in 1844 into a poor family in Melaka, Gan came to Singapore {{at a young age}} to seek his fortune. Since he was unable to have much of an {{education}} in his youth, it was his ambition in life to build a school and help those <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>poor</b> as he prospered and became wealthy. Gan was far-sighted in placing emphasis on bilingualism in English and Chinese from the start.

500|$|The show resembles Desperate Housewives in many ways, {{including}} {{having a}} [...] "pilot" [...] that revolves around a death, according to Daily News critic David Hinckley.

Hinckley lauded the show by saying [...] "... a Cherry drama rises or falls on the pretty simple test of whether it’s fun, and 'Devious Maids' has the right stuff to get to there." [...] Alessandra Stanley, the chief television critic for The New York Times, at first described the show as a [...] "landmark" [...] where the rich [...] "Beverly Hills employers are mere foils for the real heroines, <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>poor,</b> Hispanic and striving: desperate housekeepers." [...] Stanley felt that servant heroines are a bit of an overused perspective in 2013 as is the use of tongue-in-cheek humor. After describing the evolution of maid, butler and nanny roles on television, Stanley notes that this was not a show that depicts [...] "how the other half really lives", but rather [...] "an over-the-top dramedy".|$|E
