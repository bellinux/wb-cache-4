500|$|... "Papa Don't Preach" [...] is {{a message}} song that {{everyone}} is going to take the wrong way. Immediately they're going to say I am advising every young girl {{to go out and get}} pregnant. When I first heard the song, I thought it was silly. But then I thought, <b>wait</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute,</b> this song is really about a girl who is making a decision in her life. She has a very close relationship with her father and wants to maintain that closeness. To me it's a celebration of life. It says, 'I love you, father, and I love this man and this child that is growing inside me'. Of course, who knows how it will end? But at least it starts off positive." ...|$|E

500|$|Goldstein was {{struggling}} with his former addiction during the filming of Gone Too Far. He held a crack-pipe during one episode. BJ Hickman, an intervention expert who appeared in two episodes, noticed Goldstein [...] "had a moment" [...] holding the crack pipe, and later {{felt the need to}} call his sponsor. Goldstein later said of the experience: [...] "I realized my palms were sweaty and I was like, <b>wait</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute,</b> this is not smart for me to be holding this." [...] In another episode, a police officer shows Goldstein confiscated drugs, including a bag of crack cocaine. Shortly thereafter, Goldstein leaves the building, informing the camera crew that he felt so tempted to consume the drugs that it was not safe for him to remain there.|$|E

500|$|Cobain did {{not begin}} to write [...] "Smells Like Teen Spirit" [...] until {{a few weeks before}} {{recording}} started on Nirvana's second album, Nevermind, in 1991. When he first presented the song to his bandmates, it comprised just the main riff and the chorus vocal melody, which bassist Krist Novoselic dismissed at the time as [...] "ridiculous." [...] In response, Cobain made the band play the riff for [...] "an hour and a half." [...] In a 2001 interview, Novoselic recalled that after playing the riff repeatedly, he thought, <b>Wait</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute.</b> Why don't we just kind of slow this down a bit?' So I started playing the verse part. And Dave [...] playing a drum beat." [...] As a result, it is the only song on Nevermind to credit all three band members as authors.|$|E

500|$|Singer James Brown guest {{stars as}} himself. Brown makes an {{appearance}} at the [...] "Do What You Feel" [...] festival, during which he sings his 1965 song [...] "I Got You (I Feel Good)". After a bandstand collapses, he proclaims [...] "Hey, <b>wait</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute,</b> hold on here! This bandstand wasn't double-bolted!" [...] He described the experience as [...] "good, clean, and humorous. And we need more of that around." [...] According to Mirkin, the writers like to give guest stars awkward lines which then sound funny coming from them. They knew Brown would not be [...] "the greatest actor in the world" [...] but still [...] "gave him these incredibly hilarious, stiff lines that killed." [...] Mirkin described Brown's line as [...] "horrible" [...] but because of Brown's reading, [...] "you have something that just sounds perfectly wrong {{and it makes it}} funny." [...] In his book Planet Simpson, Chris Turner describes James Brown's performance as [...] "hilariously over-the-top" [...] and uses it {{as an example of how}} the early seasons of the show would include celebrity cameos and not point out the [...] "enormity of their fame".|$|E
500|$|The {{parody of}} Tom Cruise (Kevin Bishop) is framed through the {{viewpoint}} of the actor's association with the Church of Scientology. The show recounts the actor's days {{with a group of}} actors known as the Brat Pack, and how he maintains a friendship with Patrick Swayze, an actor from this crowd. (Brat Pack is a nickname given to a group of young actors and actresses who frequently appeared together in teen-oriented [...] in the 1980s; Cruise has been referred to as a member due to his role in the film The Outsiders.) While filming Top Gun, Cruise is afraid he looks [...] "a bit gay" [...] next to his co-stars. His co-stars subsequently turn into the Village People. Cruise has alien spirit guides who appear as [...] "a pair of giant blobs who speak with Welsh accents". They comment on Top Gun, [...] "It's no ET but it's got something." [...] Cruise is introduced to Scientology by John Travolta (Steve Edge), who presents it as a [...] "legitimate alien-race-based religion". After Travolta bashes him over the head with a shovel, Cruise remarks: [...] "Ouch[...] [...] <b>wait</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute.</b> Scientology. It all makes perfect sense now." [...] Ewan McGregor tries to convince Cruise to convert to the Jedi methodology.|$|E
500|$|Nimoy visited Meyer's {{house and}} suggested, [...] " [...] the wall comes down in outer space? You know, the Klingons {{have always been}} our stand-ins for the Russians..." [...] Meyer {{recalled}} that he replied [...] "'Oh, <b>wait</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute!</b> Okay, we start with an intergalactic Chernobyl! Big explosion! We got no more Klingon Empire...!' And I just spilled out the whole story!" [...] The story deliberately included references to the contemporary political climate; the character of Gorkon was based on Mikhail Gorbachev, while the assassination storyline was Meyer's idea. He thought it was plausible that the Klingon leader who turned soft towards the enemy would be killed like similar peacemakers throughout history: Anwar El Sadat, Gandhi, and Abraham Lincoln. Nimoy's hiring of Meyer was not only beneficial because Meyer knew the material and could write fast (having produced The Wrath of Khans screenplay in twelve days), but if Meyer was to direct it would offset any acrimony from Shatner, whose ire would have been aroused if Nimoy returned to direct his third Star Trek feature after [...] and The Voyage Home. Meyer {{said that when he}} started work on the screenplay it did not occur to him that he would direct the film. Meyer's wife {{was the first person to}} suggest that he should direct.|$|E

500|$|Wisden commented: [...] "The {{inclusion}} {{once again}} of Leyland was a move which yielded splendid results." [...] Coming in to bat at number three, Leyland shared a partnership of 382 with Len Hutton, {{at the time}} a record English Test partnership for any wicket; as of 2013, it remains England's highest partnership for the second wicket, and the highest for any wicket against Australia. As there was no time limit on the match, Leyland batted very cautiously and scored 187 in around six-and-a-half hours before he was run out. Hutton went on to score 364, at the time the highest score in Tests. England had batted deliberately slowly to frustrate the bowlers, and Cardus expressed his frustration to Leyland during an interval in play. Cardus wrote: [...] "'And even you, Maurice,' I complained, in sorrow not anger, 'even you won't hit the ball and give us some cricket.' 'Hey, <b>wait</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute,</b> Mr Cardus,' expostulated Leyland, as though pained at my protest, 'wait a minute—tha must remember that Ah'm playing for me place in team. England {{went on to win the}} match and level the series. Leyland's innings was his highest in Tests, but this was his final match for England. In 41 Tests, he scored 2,764 runs at 46.06 and took six wickets.|$|E
500|$|Additionally, Paul Bettany was {{the first}} actor to portray two main {{characters}} within the universe, voicing Tony Stark's artificial intelligence J.A.R.V.I.S. in the Iron Man and Avengers films, and portraying Vision in Avengers films and Captain America: Civil War. Stan Lee, creator or co-creator {{of many of the}} characters seen in the MCU, has cameo appearances in all of the feature films and television series. In Iron Fist, it is revealed his on-set photograph cameo in the Marvel Netflix series is as NYPD Captain Irving Forbush. His cameo in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 sees Lee appearing as an informant to the Watchers, discussing previous adventures that include Lee's cameos in other MCU films; he specifically mentions his time as a FedEx delivery man, referring to Lee's cameo in Captain America: Civil War. This acknowledged the fan theory that Lee may be portraying the same character in all his cameos, with writer and director James Gunn noting that [...] "people thought Stan Lee is [...] and that all of these cameos are part of him being a Watcher. So, Stan Lee as a guy who is working for the Watchers was something that I thought was fun for the MCU." [...] Feige added that Lee [...] "clearly exists, you know, above and apart from the reality of all the films. So the notion that he could be sitting there on a cosmic pit stop during the jump gate sequence in Guardians...really says, so <b>wait</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute,</b> he's this same character who's popped up in all these films?" ...|$|E

2500|$|Ironically, {{the wheel}} stopped on Dawson {{the first time}} it was used, inspiring several panelists (including Dawson) to stand up from their places and leave the set {{momentarily}} out of disbelief. Rayburn yelled, [...] "Now <b>wait</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute!</b> Get back here!" [...] He then got the four panelists to sit back down, after which guest panelist Mary Wickes said, [...] "Do you know what that wheel cost us? And it's right back to Richard!" ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1984, Madden {{took the}} advice of NFL coach John Robinson—a friend of Madden's since {{elementary}} school—and created the [...] "All-Madden" [...] team, a group of players whom Madden thought represented football and played the game the way he thought it should be played. Madden continued to pick the All-Madden team through the 2001 season when he left to move to ABC and Monday Night Football. Madden added his [...] "Haul of Fame" [...] for his favorite players, he created a special 10th Anniversary All-Madden team in 1994, an All-Madden Super Bowl Team in 1997 and an All-Time All-Madden team in 2000. All Madden was also the title of Madden's third best-selling book (after Hey, <b>Wait</b> <b>A</b> <b>Minute?</b> I Wrote a Book and One Knee Equals Two Feet).|$|E

2500|$|Some {{comments}} made by Cain regarding Muslims have caused controversy. He {{said that he was}} [...] "uncomfortable" [...] when he found that the surgeon operating on his liver and colon cancer was a Muslim. [...] He later explained: [...] "based upon the little knowledge that I have of the Muslim religion, you know, they have an objective to convert all infidels or kill them". He has also spoken of his distrust of another Doctor when his name [...] "sounded too foreign", telling the audience at a Biblically themed amusement park [...] "My mind immediately started thinking, <b>wait</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute,</b> maybe his religious persuasion is different than mine! She [...] could see the look on my face and she said, 'Don't worry, Mr. Cain, he's a Christian from Lebanon'. Hallelujah! Thank God!" ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Doris Warner, {{who was in}} attendance, {{about halfway}} through the film {{she began to feel}} that {{something}} exceptional was taking place. Suddenly, Jolson's face appeared in big close-up, and said [...] "Wait a minute, <b>wait</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute,</b> you ain't heard nothing yet!" [...] Jolson's [...] "Wait a minute" [...] line prompted a loud, positive response from the audience, who were dumbfounded by seeing, hearing, someone speak on a film for the first time. So much so that the double-entendre was missed at first. Applause followed each of his songs. Excitement built, and when Jolson and Eugenie Besserer began their dialogue scene, [...] "the audience became hysterical." [...] After the show, the audience turned into a [...] "milling, battling, mob", in one journalist's description, chanting [...] "Jolson, Jolson, Jolson!" [...] Among those who reviewed the film, the critic who foresaw most clearly what it presaged for the future of cinema was Life magazine's Robert E. Sherwood. He described the spoken dialogue scene between Jolson and Besserer as [...] "fraught with tremendous significance.... I for one suddenly realized {{that the end of the}} silent drama is in sight".|$|E
2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1979, Brood tried to enter the American market, with support from Ariola's US division, which was {{attempting}} to expand into rock music. Following {{on the success of}} Shpritsz, the band was booked as a support act for The Kinks and The Cars, playing in auditoriums; [...] "Herman Brood and His Wild Romance Tour Cha Cha '79" [...] headlined in New York (Bottom Line) and Los Angeles (Roxy). A re-recorded version of [...] "Saturday Night" [...] peaked at number 35 in the Billboard Hot 100, but the big break Brood hoped for didn't happen. When he returned to the Netherlands in October 1979, his band had begun to fall apart, and soon his popularity went downhill. Go Nutz, the album Brood had recorded while in the States, and the movie Cha-Cha, which finally premiered in December 1979, were considered artistic failures, even though Go Nutz produced three charting singles in the Netherlands and the Cha Cha soundtrack attained platinum status. The 1980 album <b>Wait</b> <b>a</b> <b>Minute...</b> was a minor success, but the follow-up albums Modern Times Revive (1981) and Frisz & Sympatisz (1982) failed to make the Dutch album charts.|$|E
