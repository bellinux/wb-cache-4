50|$|Researchers and {{scholars}} <b>who</b> <b>write</b> about their discoveries and ideas sometimes have profound effects on society. Scientists and philosophers are good examples because their new ideas can revolutionise {{the way people}} think and how they behave. Three {{of the best known}} examples of such a revolutionary effect are Nicolaus Copernicus, <b>who</b> <b>wrote</b> De revolutionibus orbium coelestium (1543); Charles Darwin, <b>who</b> <b>wrote</b> On the Origin of Species (1859); and Sigmund Freud, <b>who</b> <b>wrote</b> The Interpretation of Dreams (1899).|$|R

5|$|According to Glajar, this is {{the world}} of the narrator's mother, <b>who</b> <b>writes</b> of her sicknesses in her letters in the hope of keeping her {{daughter}} emotionally connected to her home village. The narrator's father {{was a member of the}} SS (as were Müller's father and uncle), and is a troubling example of Germanness. The novel proposes a tension inside Romania between the culturally totalitarian atmosphere of the Banat-Swabian community and the politically totalitarian world of Timişoara, where the main characters attend college—between German and Romanian. But the main characters who move to Germany quickly discover that although they were German in Romania, they are Romanian in Germany. They face new social, cultural and linguistic difficulties. Georg commits suicide a few weeks after his arrival in Frankfurt.|$|E
5|$|The name Efa first appears during Roman rule, {{some time}} {{after the end of}} the 1st century, when a Roman {{fortress}} and small Jewish settlement were established not far from Tel Shikmona. Haifa is also mentioned more than 100 times in the Talmud, a work central to Judaism. Hefa or Hepha in Eusebius of Caesarea's 4th-century work, Onomasticon (Onom. 108, 31), is said to be another name for Sycaminus. This synonymizing of the names is explained by Moshe Sharon, <b>who</b> <b>writes</b> that the twin ancient settlements, which he calls Haifa-Sycaminon, gradually expanded into one another, becoming a twin city known by the Greek names Sycaminon or Sycaminos Polis. References to this city end with the Byzantine period.|$|E
5|$|Then {{the autumn}} of 1646, Wiśniowiecki invaded and took over the starostwo kaniowskie vacated {{recently}} by banished Samuel Łaszcz. He did so without any legal justifications, which caused a court ruling against him; a ruling that was however never enforced. Later that year, he raised a large private army of about 25,000 for a purpose unknown, as noted by Widacki, <b>who</b> <b>writes</b> that the army, which Jeremi raised with an immense cost for a short time, {{did not participate in}} any engagement, nor did it have any clear purpose. He notes that such an army might have been useful in provoking the Ottomans, but as Jeremi was opposed to the war with them up to the point of refusing the hetman office, his actions are puzzling even for the modern historians.|$|E

5|$|Ellsworth M. Toohey, <b>who</b> <b>writes</b> {{a popular}} {{architecture}} {{column in the}} Banner, is an outspoken socialist who shapes public opinion through his column and a circle of influential associates. Toohey sets out to destroy Roark through a smear campaign. He recommends Roark to Hopton Stoddard, a wealthy acquaintance who {{wants to build a}} Temple of the Human Spirit. Roark's unusual design includes a nude statue modeled on Dominique; Toohey convinces Stoddard to sue Roark for malpractice. Toohey and several architects (including Keating) testify at the trial that Roark is incompetent as an architect due to his rejection of historical styles. Dominique speaks in Roark's defense, but he loses the case. Dominique decides that since she cannot have the world she wants, in which men like Roark are recognized for their greatness, she will live entirely in the world she has, which shuns Roark and praises Keating. She marries Keating and turns herself over to him, doing and saying whatever he wants, such as persuading potential clients to hire him instead of Roark.|$|E
