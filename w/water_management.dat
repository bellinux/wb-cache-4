5|$|The St. Johns River {{is under}} {{consideration}} {{as an additional}} water source to meet growing public water needs. In 2008, the river's <b>Water</b> <b>Management</b> District undertook a Water Supply Impact Study of the proposed water withdrawals and asked the National Research Council to review science aspects of the study as it progressed. This resulted {{in a series of}} four reports that assessed the impact of water withdrawal on river level and flow, reviewed potential impacts on wetland ecosystems, and presented overall perspectives on the <b>Water</b> <b>Management</b> District study. The National Research Council found that, overall, the District performed a competent job in relating predicted environmental responses, including their magnitude and general degree of uncertainty, to the proposed range of water withdrawals. However, the report noted that the District's final report should acknowledge such critical issues as include future sea-level rises, population growth, and urban development. Although the District predicted that changes in <b>water</b> <b>management</b> would increase water levels and flows that exceed the proposed surface water withdrawals, these predictions have high uncertainties.|$|E

5|$|When {{high levels}} of {{phosphorus}} and mercury were discovered in the waterways in 1986, water quality became a focus for <b>water</b> <b>management</b> agencies. Costly and lengthy court battles were waged between various government entities to determine {{who was responsible for}} monitoring and enforcing water quality standards. Governor Lawton Chiles proposed a bill that determined which agencies would have that responsibility, and set deadlines for pollutant levels to decrease in water. Initially the bill was criticized by conservation groups for not being strict enough on polluters, but the Everglades Forever Act was passed in 1994. Since then, the South Florida <b>Water</b> <b>Management</b> District (SFWMD) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers have surpassed expectations for achieving lower phosphorus levels.|$|E
5|$|As of 2010, major long-standing {{extraction}} {{industries are}} operating in Estonia, Brazil, and China. Its economic viability usually requires {{a lack of}} locally available crude oil.

5|$|Despite {{moving across}} {{the state as a}} minimal hurricane, there were no reports of hurricane-force winds on {{mainland}} Florida. The highest official recorded wind report was 60mph (97km/h) in Miami Beach, while the highest accurate wind gust was 71mph (114km/h) in Vero Beach. In addition to the National Weather Service Reports, the South Florida <b>Water</b> <b>Management</b> District reported higher wind gusts near Lake Okeechobee of up to 93mph (150km/h) in Belle Glade, though these were likely caused by small-scale meso-cyclone-induced downbursts. Irene produced heavy rainfall across southeastern Florida, peaking at 17.45inches (443mm) at Boynton Beach, though many areas in the Miami Metropolitan Area received from 10 to 15inches (255 to 380mm).

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the barriers to}} sustainable <b>water</b> resources <b>management</b> in <b>water</b> vulnerable, yet a mining booming area. The case study is conducted in Omnogovi province of Mongolia in Nov-Dec 2016. This study presents how the Omnogovi province manages its water with increased mining and examines what hinders the province from practicing sustainable <b>water</b> resources <b>management</b> and examines the involvement of residents in the <b>water</b> resources <b>management</b> of Omnogovi province. Qualitative approaches such as semi-structured interviews, participatory observation and literature review were used in this study. This study demonstrates that the <b>water</b> resources <b>management</b> of Omnogovi province is unsustainable in this time period, yet the implementation of IWRM approach has improved the <b>water</b> resources <b>management</b> of the province. The barriers to sustainable <b>water</b> resources <b>management</b> in Omnogovi province are inefficient governance and poor enforcement of law, today. Despite it, data-scarcity and transboundary water issues might become barriers to practice efficient <b>water</b> resources <b>management</b> in the province. The involvement of residents in <b>water</b> resources <b>management</b> of Omnogovi province is deficient, yet the implementation of participatory approach and establishment of RBC might improve the participatory governance. The study shows IWRM can improve the <b>water</b> resources <b>management</b> of a developing country, yet it can be time-consuming, costly and challenging to implement in a country, which is still in socio-economic and political transition. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{potential}} of 'boundary work' perspectives for enhancing current approaches in <b>water</b> resources <b>management</b> and research {{with a focus on}} developing countries. Boundary work thinking is analysed in the context of three currently leading approaches for water and natural resources management, i. e. Integrated <b>Water</b> Resources <b>Management,</b> Adaptive Management, and the Ecosystem Approach. Given the political dimension of <b>water</b> resources <b>management,</b> questions of governance are merged into the boundary work perspective. The paper introduces the Boundary Work framework as developed by Mollinga (2010 a), discusses {{the potential of}} the framework for enhancing <b>water</b> resources <b>management</b> and research practice and proposes amendments to the framework. Based on the analyses and following the rationale of Mollinga's boundary work framework, the paper is meant to spark the discussion on a generic 'boundary concept' to communicate about problems in <b>water</b> resources <b>management,</b> to reflect upon a general protocol to develop suitable 'boundary objects' and to cogitate on 'boundary settings' to understand limitations and limits to change towards sustainable <b>water</b> resources <b>management.</b> This serves the development of operational guidance how to approach complex <b>water</b> resources <b>management</b> problems, aiming for: increased sustainability of current <b>water</b> resources <b>management</b> systems, improved research and management approaches under uncertainty, increased adaptive capacity, enhanced resilience to changes, such as climate change.

5|$|Pelicans {{have been}} persecuted by humans for their {{perceived}} competition for fish, {{despite the fact}} that their diet overlaps little with fish caught by people. Starting in the 1880s, American white pelicans were clubbed and shot, their eggs and young were deliberately destroyed, and their feeding and nesting sites were degraded by <b>water</b> <b>management</b> schemes and wetland drainage. Even in the 21st century, an increase in the population of American white pelicans in south-eastern Idaho in the US was seen to threaten the recreational cutthroat trout fishery there, leading to official attempts to reduce pelican numbers through systematic harassment and culling.|$|E

5|$|The Rasi Salai Dam was {{completed}} in 1994, {{around the same time}} as the Pak Mun Dam, and received similar local complaints. The dam's central reservoir was occupied for two years by villagers, until a July 2000 decision opened the sluice gates. From 2003 to 2004, Living River Siam coordinated Thai Baan research in three districts: Amphoe Rasi Salai, Amphoe Rattanaburi, and Amphoe Phon Sai. The report examined village culture, ecology, biodiversity, agriculture, and food and <b>water</b> <b>management.</b> The impact of the closing and opening of the sluice gates was also examined. It was concluded that the dam reduced fish populations, but more importantly, flooded natural salt pits and spread them into rice and vegetable fields, destroying trees and crops. The government has not made a commitment to keep the Rasi Salai Dam out of commission, but as of 2008 the gates have not yet been closed.|$|E
