40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effect of product market {{characteristics}} on the decision to <b>go</b> <b>public.</b> When firms decide to <b>go</b> <b>public</b> or remain private, they trade off product market related costs and benefits.

Our results show that UK firms are more likely to <b>go</b> <b>public</b> when they operate in a more profitable industry and in an industry with lower barriers to entry. These firms are more likely to <b>go</b> <b>public</b> in order to improve their position in the product market and to deter new entrants into the industry.
