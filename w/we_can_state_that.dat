50|$|We {{know that}} for any two read invocations (r1 and r2) when the {{register}} is regular {{and there is no}} new/old inversion (r1 →H r2) ⇒sn(π(r1)) ≤ sn(π(r2)). For any execution(M)there is a total order (S)which includes the same operation invocations.We can state that S is built as follow:we start from the total order on the write operations and we will insert the read operation as follow:first: Read operation(r) is inserted after the associated write operation(π(r)).Second: If two read operations (r1,r2) have the same (sn(r1)=sn(r2)) then first insert the operation which starts first in the execution.S includes all the operation invocation of M, from which it follows that S and M are equivalent. Since all the operations are ordered based on their sequence number,S is slightly a total order. Furthermore,this total order is an execution of M only adds an order on operations that are overlapping in M. If there is no overlapping between a read and write operations, there is no difference between the regularity and atomicity. Finally, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>state</b> <b>that</b> S is legal since each read operation gets the last written value that comes before it in the total order. Therefore, the corresponding history is linearizable. Since this reasoning does not rely on a particularhistory H, it implies that the register is atomic. Since atomicity (linearizability) is a local property, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>state</b> <b>that</b> a set of SWMR regular registers behave atomically as soon as each of them satisfies the no new/old inversion property.|$|E

50|$|Model-to-code {{consistency}} is {{an essential}} requirement in multi-level customization. When models are supplemented with code snippets as in the build PDF example, {{it is necessary to}} check that models and code actually fit. This partly a matter of making sure that soft references between models and code are not broken, similar to referential integrity in model-to-model consistency. But it is also a matter of making sure that the code does not violate expectations set up in the model. In the build PDF example, the model specifies that outByteWrapper will always be part of the output, i.e., the outByteWrapper key is put in the results map. An analysis of the code shows that outByteWrapper will only be part of the output if no exceptions are thrown before line 10. In other words, some possible executions of the code will violate a specification on the modeling level. More generally, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>state</b> <b>that</b> multi-level customization imposes very fine-grained constraints on the involved models and code snippets.|$|E
50|$|Energy plays a very {{important}} role in p3 peptides. While Aβ models have a strong negative energy, p3 oligomeric models have a positive one. Another characteristic that must be pointed out is that p3 peptides have more solvent-exposed hydrophobic surfaces (60%) than Aβ oligomers do (20%), so buried surface areas are not as big within p3 oligomers (30%) as they are within Aβ oligomers. These evidences show that the expected energy of the Aβ-based oligomeric models of p3 is always positive and that these models expose hydrophobic patches to the solvent and bury a small proportion of their accessible surface within the oligomeric intermediates. Having these facts into account, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>state</b> <b>that</b> p3 oligomers' existence is thermodynamically unfavourable, which suggests that the p3 peptide cannot form stable soluble oligomers in the same way Aβ does. Solution of p3 cannot assemble into stable oligomers as Aβ1-42 in the same concentration does. Therefore, if it is very possible that p3 could not last long by itself, evolving rapidly into fibrillar forms that hide exposed hydrophobic patches.|$|E
