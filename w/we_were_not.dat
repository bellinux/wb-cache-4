5|$|We made it {{very clear}} <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> doing another record for TVT. But they made it pretty clear they weren't ready to sell. So I felt like, well, I've finally got this thing going but it's dead. Flood and I had to record Broken under a {{different}} band name, because if TVT found out we were recording, they could confiscate all our shit and release it. Jimmy Iovine got involved with Interscope, and we kind of got slave-traded. It wasn't my doing. I didn't know anything about Interscope. And I was real pissed off at him at first because it was going from one bad situation to potentially another one. But Interscope went into it like they really wanted to know what I wanted. It was good, after I put my raving lunatic act on.|$|E
5|$|Kailua, now {{the capital}} of Owhyhee, was {{the seat of the}} {{government}} of the group after the conquests of the renowned Kamehameha I., who, it will be remembered, died here. It is situated within a wide bay, with a safe roadstead and good anchorage. It has a very few more inhabitants than some of the larger villages in the island, though much frequented by the natives living in the vicinity, on account of its being the centre of their civil and religious affairs. It has, however, four stone buildings and a fort. The buildings are, the residence of the governor; that of the parent of the missionaries, Mr. Thurston, whom we have had already occasion to name; and two places of worship. Immediately upon our arrival, we called to pay our respects to the governor, Kapeau, a native chief, who received us with good-humoured frankness, and ordered a room in the government-house to be prepared for our reception and residence; in order, as he said, that we might be as near to him as possible during our stay in the place. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> long installed, before the hospitable chief came to pay us a visit, and, as it happened to be a bright moonlight night, he invited us to go at once in his company, to inspect the fort, which was in front of his residence, and which in passable English he called the right arm of his strength. We found it consist of a single battery commanding the bay, with twelve pieces of cannon of not very large calibre.|$|E

25|$|Three {{widespread}} {{units are}} recognized within the Victoria quadrangle. These are, from oldest to youngest, intercrater plains material, intermediate plains material, and smooth plains material. In addition, central peak, floor, rim, and ejecta materials {{related to the}} numerous craters and basins larger than about 20km in diameter are mapped. The simplicity of the stratigraphic scheme is {{at least in part}} due to deficiencies in the data base; the history of plains formation almost certainly is more complex than our threefold division indicates, but <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> able to define consistent criteria of albedo, texture, and cratering for more than three plains units because of the highly variable quality of available pictures.|$|E
25|$|Into the '60s, I {{was still}} not of a frame of mind that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> only making music, we were making history. But I did {{recognize}} the impact because acts were going {{all over the world}} at that time. I recognized the bridges that we crossed, the racial problems and the barriers that we broke down with music. I recognized that because I lived it. I would come to the South {{in the early days of}} Motown and the audiences would be segregated. Then they started to get the Motown music and we would go back and the audiences were integrated and the kids were dancing together and holding hands.|$|E

25|$|From {{that point}} on {{he took over the}} story. He told us that {{in the early part of}} his career he had taken special {{training}} on spotting and tracing torpedo wakes and that was one of the reasons he felt a little safer when he was on the bridge in treacherous waters. As a result of his early training he was the first one to see the wakes of the two torpedoes coming from the port side. Both torpedoes went between the Helena and the San Francisco and when both ships turned, the torpedoes went past us and one of them hit the Juneau. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> able to warn the Juneau in time to save her.|$|E
25|$|Concerning {{the social}} {{position}} and the personal history of Rav <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> informed. That he was rich seems probable; for {{he appears to have}} occupied himself for a time with commerce and afterward with agriculture (Hullin 105a). He {{is referred to as the}} son of noblemen (Shabbat 29a) but it is not clear if this is an affectionate term or a true description of his status. Rashi does tell us that he is being described as the son of great men. That he was highly respected by the Gentiles as well as by the Jews of Babylonia is proved by the friendship which existed between him and the last Parthian king, Artaban (Avodah Zarah 10b). He was deeply affected by the death of Artaban (226) and the downfall of the Arsacid dynasty, and does not appear to have sought the friendship of Ardeshir, founder of the Sassanian dynasty, although Samuel of Nehardea probably did so. Rav became closely related, through the marriage of one of his daughters, to the family of the exilarch. Her sons, Mar Ukba and Nehemiah, were considered types of the highest aristocracy. Rav had many sons, several of whom are mentioned in the Talmud, the most distinguished being the eldest, Chiyya. The latter did not, however, succeed his father as head of the academy: this post fell to Rav's disciple Rav Huna. Two of his grandsons occupied in succession the office of exilarch (resh galuta) (Hullin 92a).|$|E
500|$|Mr. Arakawa and I {{decided that}} we would go down and simply tell him [...] that we've come {{to tell you to}} your face that we would pay you if we thought we were liable, but we had done our {{homework}} and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> prepared to pay anything because we hadn't done anything wrong.

He also said that the film will be a two-hour representation of a twenty-four-hour time frame. Sutherland described the film production as [...] "exciting" [...] because, [...] "It's going to be a two-hour representation of a 24 hour day, so <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> going to be restrained by the real time aspect of the TV show." ...|$|E

500|$|Although Glock {{restored}} the orchestra's reputation as Britain's leading modern music ensemble, {{the balance of}} programming affected the players' capacity in the mainstream repertoire. The principal horn, Alan Civil, recalled, [...] "We did about eighty percent modern and twenty percent classical. The awful tragedy, for the orchestra, was that eventually <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> able to play the standard classics. We could sight-read the most fearsome contemporary piece, but a Brahms symphony – embarrassing!"

Cuban Prime Minister Fidel Castro was reluctant to accept the missiles, and, once he was persuaded, warned Khrushchev against transporting the missiles in secret. Castro stated, thirty years later, [...] "We had a sovereign right to accept the missiles. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> violating international law. Why do it secretly—as if we {{had no right to}} do it? I warned Nikita that secrecy would give the imperialists the advantage." ...|$|E

500|$|On 10 June, the Imperial Japanese Navy {{conveyed}} {{to the military}} liaison conference an incomplete picture {{of the results of}} the battle. Chūichi Nagumo's detailed battle report was submitted to the high command on 15 June. It was intended only for the highest echelons in the Japanese Navy and government, and was guarded closely throughout the war. In it, one of the more striking revelations is the comment on the Mobile Force Commander's (Nagumo's) estimates: [...] "The enemy is not aware of our plans (<b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> discovered until early in the morning of the 5th at the earliest)." [...] In reality, the whole operation had been compromised from the beginning by Allied code-breaking efforts.|$|E

500|$|Upon {{the end of}} the Beatles' {{performing}} career, McCartney sensed unease in {{the band}} and wanted them to maintain creative productivity. He pressed them to start a new project, which became Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, widely regarded as rock's first concept album. McCartney was inspired to create a new persona for the group, to serve as a vehicle for experimentation and to demonstrate to their fans that they had musically matured. He invented the fictional band of the album's title track. As McCartney explained, [...] "We were fed up with being the Beatles. We really hated that fucking four little mop-top approach. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> boys we were men... and [...] thought of ourselves as artists rather than just performers." ...|$|E
