5|$|A sea shore. As Goffredo, Eustazio and Rinaldo {{near the}} magician's lair, a {{beautiful}} woman calls from her boat, promising Rinaldo that she can take him to Almirena. Two mermaids sing of love's delights, and urge Rinaldo {{to go in the}} boat. He hesitates, unsure <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> <b>and</b> his companions attempt to restrain him. Angry at the abduction of his loved one, Rinaldo enters the boat, which immediately sails off. Goffredo and Eustazio are shocked at Rinaldo's impulsiveness and believe that he has deserted their cause.|$|E
5|$|During a {{surprise}} {{inspection of the}} Springfield Nuclear Power Plant from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Homer is placed in a test module van that simulates an emergency. He has no idea <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>and</b> starts pressing buttons at random, somehow causing a nuclear meltdown {{even though there was}} no nuclear material inside the van. The NRC officials tell Mr. Burns that Homer's job requires college training in nuclear physics, and that he must go back to college to keep his job. Homer is rejected by every college he applies to, but Mr. Burns helps him get into Springfield University.|$|E
5|$|For {{reasons not}} entirely clear, on 7 October Mack ordered Franz Xavier Auffenburg {{to take his}} {{division}} of 5,000 infantry and 400 cavalry from Günzburg to Wertingen {{in preparation for the}} main Austrian advance out of Ulm. Uncertain of <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>and</b> having little hope for reinforcements, Auffenburg was in a dangerous position. The first French forces to arrive were Murat's cavalry divisions– Louis Klein's 1st Dragoon Division, Marc Antoine de Beaumont's 3rd Dragoon Division, and Nansouty's 1st Cuirassier Division. They began to assault the Austrian positions and were soon joined by Nicolas Oudinot's grenadiers, who were hoping to outflank the Austrians from the northeast. Auffenburg attempted a retreat to the southwest, but he was not quick enough: the Austrians lost nearly their entire force, 1,000 to 2,000 of which were taken prisoner. The Battle of Wertingen had been an easy French victory.|$|E

25|$|Shivaji was {{a devout}} Hindu, but {{respected}} all religions within the region. Shivaji had {{great respect for}} other contemporary saints, especially Samarth Ramdas, to whom he gave the fort of Parali, later renamed as 'Sajjangad'. Among the various poems written on Shivaji, Ramdas' Shivastuti ("Praise of King Shivaji") is the most famous. Shivaji's son Sambhaji later built a samadhi for Ramdas Swami on Sajjangad upon the latter's death. Samarth Ramdas had also written a letter to Sambhaji guiding him on <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>and</b> {{what not to do}} after death of Shivaji.|$|E
25|$|One notable {{change in}} {{plotting}} {{is that in}} the film Théoden is possessed by Saruman, whereas in the book he is simply depressed and deluded by Wormtongue. Afterwards, in the film, Théoden is still unsure of <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> <b>and</b> flees to Helm's Deep. In the book he rides out to war, only ending up besieged when he considers helping Erkenbrand. Erkenbrand does not exist in the films: his character is combined with Éomer as the Rohirrim general who arrives with Gandalf at the film's end. Éomer himself is present during the entire battle in the book.|$|E

25|$|He {{continued}} {{experimenting with}} new modes of filming, using different directorial methods and techniques. A {{case in point}} is Ten, which was filmed in a moving automobile in which Kiarostami was not present. He gave suggestions to the actors about <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> <b>and</b> a camera placed on the dashboard filmed them while they drove around Tehran. The camera was allowed to roll, capturing the faces of the people involved during their daily routine, using a series of extreme-close shots. Ten was an experiment that used digital cameras to virtually eliminate the director. This new direction towards a digital micro-cinema is defined as a micro-budget filmmaking practice, allied with a digital production basis.|$|E
25|$|After the 1930s, Dallas was {{controlled}} {{in all aspects}} by the Dallas Citizens Council, {{a group of about}} two hundred men who had both achieved unusual success in their careers and demonstrated an unusual willingness to work on projects they believed would help build a great city. In 1954 with the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to end racial segregation in public schools, the Citizens Council soon acknowledged that desegregation was inevitable, and they sought {{to make the best of}} it. The first step was the formation of the Biracial Committee. For the most part, the Citizens Council had already decided <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> <b>and</b> the Biracial Committee helped get it done. They decided to prepare for school desegregation by desegregating the community bit by bit.|$|E

25|$|The size of {{the brown}} facial {{markings}} on the heads of females {{also serves as a}} visual cue for members of the colony and serves as a badge of higher ranking status and reproductive status. Females with larger brown facial markings also have larger ovaries. These visual cues help other wasps to not only determine if a wasp is of the same species, but also to determine <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>and</b> how to distribute themselves around the nests. Visiting females that lack these brown visual marks {{are more likely to be}} accepted into foreign nests. Acts of aggressions are much more likely to be exhibited towards a female with these distinctive markings in order to maintain a control system within the nest.|$|E

The children do not know <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>and</b> send him back through where he is found by Violette. Constance tells the other that her mother found him and they try to get him back. They realise they must find a more recent picture of Fergus. They decide to use the picture which had been taken that morning. They return through the mirror and Fergus is restored to his teenage self, unaware of what had happened.|$|E
25|$|Worth {{returned}} to Florida {{at the beginning}} of November 1842. He soon decided that Tiger Tail and Otiarche had taken too long to make up their minds on <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> <b>and</b> ordered that they be brought in. Tiger Tail was so ill that he had to be carried on a litter, and he died in New Orleans waiting for transportation to the Indian territory. The other Indians in northern Florida were also captured and sent west. By April 1843 only one regiment, the Eighth Infantry, was still in Florida. In November 1843 Worth reported that the only Indians left in Florida were 42 Seminole warriors, 33 Mikasukis, 10 Creeks and 10 Tallahassees, with women and children bringing the total to about 300. Worth also stated that these Indians were all living on the reservation and were no longer a threat to the white population of Florida.|$|E

25|$|By mid-1917, {{plans for}} {{infantry}} attacks {{were determined by}} the artillery support that could be provided. Commanders planned attacks to create the conditions {{for success in the}} absence of voice communication and attacks were limited to the range of artillery covering fire. Infantry units were to follow a creeping barrage, pausing at intermediate objectives to reorganise behind standing barrages and then dig in on the final objective, behind a protective barrage. In February 1917, infantry units were organised and equipped on a standard pattern and trained to achieve their objectives so that each man knew <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>and</b> the drills to follow in certain circumstances. SS 143 Instructions for the training of Platoons for Offensive Action) prescribed a platoon organisation of four sections, the Lewis gun and rifle-grenade sections for firepower and the rifle and bombing sections for manoeuvre. The platoon was to seek opportunities for flank attacks and to use initiative rather than refer back for orders. The new infantry platoon organisation and training gave infantry the capacity to succeed despite casualties to officers and NCOs and sometimes after losing the creeping barrage.|$|E
