Assisted aspects of writing include: lexical, syntactic (syntactic and semantic roles of a word's frame), lexical semantic (context/collocation-influenced word choice and user-intention-driven synonym choice) and idiomatic expression transfer, etc. Different types of foreign language writing aids include automated proofreading applications, text corpora, dictionaries, translation aids and orthography aids.|$|E

50|$|Foreign {{language}} learners' {{awareness of}} the conventions in writing can be improved through reference to guidelines showing the features {{and structure of the}} target genre. At the same time, interactions and feedback help to engage the learners and expedite their learning, especially with active participation. In online writing situations, learners are isolated without face-to-face interaction with others. Therefore, a foreign language <b>writing</b> <b>aid</b> should provide interaction and feedback so as to ease the learning process. This complements communicative language teaching (CLT); which is a teaching approach that highlights interaction as both the means and aim of learning a language.|$|E

However, as with other computerized writing aids such as spell checkers, popular grammar checkers are often criticized when they fail to spot errors and incorrectly flag correct text as erroneous. The linguist Geoffrey K.

In this paper, we describe a new method to predict the correct word given its context. A data mining tool is used as a classification mean to predict the correct word in the given context.

50|$|To achieve writing {{competence}} in a non-native language, especially in an alphabetic language, spelling proficiency {{is of utmost}} importance. Spelling proficiency {{has been identified as}} a good indicator of a learner’s acquisition and comprehension of alphabetic principles in the target language. Documented data on misspelling patterns indicate that majority of misspellings fall under the four categories of letter insertion, deletion, transposition and substitution. In languages where pronunciation of certain sequences of letters may be similar, misspellings may occur when the non-native language learner relies heavily on the sounds of the target language because they are unsure about the accurate spelling of the words. The spell checker application is a type of <b>writing</b> <b>aid</b> that non-native language learners can rely on to detect and correct their misspellings in the target language.|$|E

50|$|The word {{thesaurus}} means 'treasury' or 'storehouse' in Greek and Latin {{and is used}} {{to refer}} to several varieties of language resources, it is most commonly known as a book that groups words in synonym clusters and related meanings. Its original sense of 'dictionary or encyclopedia' has been overshadowed by the emergence of the Roget-style thesaurus and it is considered as a <b>writing</b> <b>aid</b> as it helps writers with the selection of words. The differences between a Roget-style thesaurus and a dictionary would be the indexing and information given; the words in thesaurus are grouped by meaning, usually without definitions, while the latter is by alphabetical order with definitions. When users are unable to find a word in a dictionary, it is usually due to the constraint of searching alphabetically by common and well-known headwords and the use of a thesaurus eliminates this issue by allowing users to search for a word through another word based on concept.|$|E

The second research direction is to systematically integrate different NLP resources for our new semantic <b>writing</b> <b>aid</b> tool using again an interactive machine learn-ing approach to provide contextual paraphrase suggestions. We develop a baseline system where three lexical resources are combined to provide paraphrasing in context and show that combining resources is a promising direction. ...|$|E
