40|$|One of {{the primary}} goals of the US Geological Survey (USGS) Laboratory in Lawrence, Kansas, is to develop {{analytical}} methods {{for the analysis of}} herbicide metabolites in surface and ground water that are vital to the study of herbicide fate and degradation pathways in the environment. Methods to measure metabolite concentrations from three major classes of herbicides ─ triazine, chloroacetanilide and phenyl-urea ─ have been developed. Methods for triazine metabolite detection cover nine compounds: six compounds <b>are</b> <b>detected</b> <b>by</b> gas chromatography/mass spectrometry; one <b>is</b> <b>detected</b> <b>by</b> high-performance liquid chromatography with diode-array detection; and eight <b>are</b> <b>detected</b> <b>by</b> liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. Two metabolites of the chloroacetanilide herbicides ─ ethane sulfonic acid and oxanilic acid ─ <b>are</b> <b>detected</b> <b>by</b> high-performance liquid chromatography with diode-array detection and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. Alachlor ethane sulfonic acid also has <b>been</b> <b>detected</b> <b>by</b> solid-phase extraction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

Additionally, surveys of herbicides and their metabolites in surface water, ground water, lakes, reservoirs, and rainfall have been conducted through the USGS laboratory in Lawrence.

Singh et al. subsequently cloned and characterized the CASS4 gene, originally assigning the name HEPL (HEF1-EFS-p130Cas-like) for similarity to the other three defined CAS genes. The official name was subsequently changed to CASS4 by the Human Genome Organization (HUGO) Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC).|$|E

For larger fires, additional men, supplies and food were airdropped to expand the effort. Up to 240 CPS men served in this specialized program. One of the smokejumping schools was at Camp Paxson in Montana.|$|E

The Task Group arrived at Manus Island on 17 June, and continued training exercises there until the remainder of the BPF arrived on 4 July en route to further operations off Japan. All of the warships at Manus sailed on 6 July to join the Fast Carrier Task Force in attacks on the Japanese home islands. Implacable and the other ships of the BPF operated against Japan from 17 July to 12 August, during which time the Fleet conducted air attacks and participated in several bombardments of coastal Japanese cities.

40|$|We {{compared}} the BacT/Alert system using the aerobic FAN bottle with the ESP system using the 80 A aerobic bottle {{for the detection}} of pediatric bloodstream pathogens at a children's hospital.

BacT/Alert FAN detected more isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (47 versus 34; P = 0. 02), while ESP 80 A detected more episodes of streptococcal and enterococcal infection. BacT/Alert FAN detected more pathogens from patients receiving antibiotic therapy (107 versus 93; P = 0. 04). Of 248 separate episodes of bacteremia or fungemia, 146 <b>were</b> <b>detected</b> <b>by</b> both systems, 56 <b>were</b> <b>detected</b> <b>by</b> ESP 80 A only, and 46 <b>were</b> <b>detected</b> <b>by</b> BacT/Alert FAN only (P = 0. 37; not significant). The median times to detection were 13. 6 h for ESP 80 A and 15. 7 h for BacT/Alert FAN (P < 0. 001). Both systems were considered easy to operate and were free from significant mechanical difficulties. False-positive or false-negative signals were rare or nonexistent with both systems. We conclude that both systems rapidly detect a broad range of pediatric bloodstream pathogens. BacT/Alert FAN provides better detection of Staphylococcus aureus, especially from patients receiving antibiotics. ESP 80 A provides better detection of streptococci and enterococci...|$|R
