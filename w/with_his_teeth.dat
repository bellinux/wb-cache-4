5|$|Courville and Percy {{decided to}} test Tarrare's {{capacity}} for food. A meal {{had been prepared}} for 15 labourers near the hospital gates; although generally hospital staff restrained Tarrare {{in the presence of}} food, on this occasion Courville allowed him to reach the table undisturbed. Tarrare ate the entire meal of two large meat pies, plates of grease and salt and four gallons of milk, and then immediately fell asleep; Courville noted that Tarrare's belly became taut and inflated like a large balloon. On another occasion Tarrare was presented with a live cat. He tore the cat's abdomen open <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>teeth</b> and drank its blood, and proceeded to eat the entire cat aside from its bones, before vomiting up its fur and skin. Following this, hospital staff offered Tarrare a variety of other animals including snakes, lizards and puppies, all of which were eaten; he also swallowed an entire eel without chewing, having first crushed its head <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>teeth.</b>|$|E
5|$|River otters {{typically}} breed from December to April. Copulation lasts from 16–73 {{minutes and}} may occur in water or on land. During the breeding, the male grabs the female {{by the neck}} <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>teeth.</b> Copulation is vigorous, and is interrupted by periods of rest. Females may caterwaul during or shortly after mating. Female estrus lasts about a month per year, and true gestation lasts 61–63 days. Because the otters delay implantation for at least eight months, the interval between copulation and parturition can reach 10–12 months. Delayed implantation distinguishes the species from the European otter, which lacks this feature. Young are born between February and April, and parturition lasts three to eight hours.|$|E
5|$|At the Rio de Janeiro location, {{many months}} later, Roger Moore arrived {{several days later}} than {{scheduled}} for shooting due to recurrent health problems and an attack of kidney stones that he had suffered while in France. After arriving in Rio de Janeiro, Moore was immediately whisked off the plane and went straight to hair and make-up work, before re-boarding the plane, to film the sequence with him arriving as James Bond in the film. Sugarloaf Mountain was a prominent location in the film, and during filming of the cable car sequence in which Bond and Goodhead are attacked by Jaws during mid-air transportation high above Rio de Janeiro, the stuntman Richard Graydon slipped and narrowly avoided falling to his death. For the scene in which Jaws bites into the steel tramway cable <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>teeth,</b> the cable was actually made of liquorice, although Richard Kiel was still required to use his steel dentures.|$|E

5|$|Iron Maiden {{recruited}} {{yet another}} guitarist in 1977, Bob Sawyer, who was sacked for embarrassing the band on stage by pretending to play guitar <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>teeth.</b> Tension ensued again, causing a rift between Murray and Wilcock, who convinced Harris to fire Murray, {{as well as}} original drummer Ron Matthews. A new line-up was put together, including future Cutting Crew member Tony Moore on keyboards, Terry Wapram on guitar, and drummer Barry Purkis (better known today as Thunderstick). A bad performance at the Bridgehouse, a pub located in Canning Town, in November 1977 was the line-up's first and only concert and led to Purkis being replaced by Doug Sampson. At the same time, Moore was asked to leave as Harris decided that keyboards did not suit the band's sound. A few months later, Dennis Wilcock decided {{that he had had}} enough with the group and left to form his own band, V1, and Dave Murray was immediately reinstated. As he preferred to be the band's sole guitarist, Wapram disapproved of Murray's return and was also dismissed.|$|E
5|$|On a cold, snowy day, thirteen-year-old Lad feels snubbed {{when the}} three-year-old Wolf does not {{invite him to}} join him and Rex, a five-year-old collie and bull terrier mix, for a run in the woods. Later, Lad goes for a walk, {{following}} their path. When he meets them on the trail, rather than letting Lad pass, Rex viciously attacks him. <b>With</b> <b>his</b> <b>teeth</b> dulled by old age, Lad is unable to really fight back. Refusing to just run, he defends himself as best he can while moving backwards towards home, half a mile away. Though Wolf betrays him and joins Rex in the life-or-death fight, Lad manages to {{get close enough to}} the house for Bruce to hear the battle and alert the Master and Mistress. The Master is forced to kill Rex after the crazed dog turns on him. After four weeks recovering from his wounds, Lad is able to go outside again and Wolf steps aside for him, acknowledging he is still the leader of the Place's dogs.|$|E
5|$|The panel {{captures the}} instant of Christ's death, {{traditionally}} the moment after {{the breaking of}} the thieves' legs (although this is not depicted). Christ is naked except for a transparent veil, with some of his pubic hair visible. His hands and feet are nailed to the timber; the blood from the nail holding his feet to the cross stains its wooden base. His arms strain under the weight of his upper body, and in his final agony, his jaw has fallen slack; his mouth is open <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>teeth</b> exposed in the grimace of death. In the mid-ground, {{at the base of the}} cross, Longinus, on horseback, wearing a fur-trimmed hat and green tunic, guided by an assistant, stretches to pierce Jesus' side with a lance, as deep-red blood pours from the wound. To the right of Longinus, a mostly obscured Stephaton holds high a sponge soaked with vinegar on the tip of a reed.|$|E

5000|$|Sauvage synonymized it <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>tooth</b> species Iguanodon praecursor, {{which by}} this time had become mixed up with Edward Drinker Cope's roughly {{contemporaneous}} American Morrison Formation genus Caulodon (now a synonym of Camarasaurus). However, the two are not {{based on the same}} type, as [...] "I". praecursor comes from slightly older rocks: the same unnamed Kimmeridgian formation as Morinosaurus. Earlier reviews (Romer, 1956; Steel, 1970) accepted it as a synonym of Pelorosaurus, and considered it a possible brachiosaurid.|$|R
5|$|The {{music video}} begins with Beyoncé {{preparing}} herself for her wedding ceremony. She {{is in her}} boudoir wearing a lacy corset and a lingerie combo with garters. As the song begins, Beyoncé looks towards the camera, addressing the viewer while affirming {{the subject of the}} song that she was the best he ever had. The video moves from Beyoncé playing with a tiara, a veil and tulle netting on a bed, to various stages of getting dressed. Between scenes, flash back scenes of Beyoncé in high school are shown. Beyoncé is seen with a high school boyfriend at their senior-prom night on May 16, 1998. As Beyoncé and her boyfriend dance, he becomes interested in another girl, leaving Beyoncé alone on the dance floor. The video then returns to the present, with Beyoncé in her final preparations before her marriage. She is shown wearing a white gown and singing at sunset atop a grassy hill, followed by a scene of her walking down the aisle and exchanging vows. Her former lover is shown at the prom, deep in thought, with his prom king crown askew on his head. Beyoncé and her new husband are seen celebrating at a happy and well-attended reception. The groom removes the bride's garter <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>teeth</b> and they start dancing with their younger family members. The final scene features Beyoncé looking into the camera looking happy and satisfied. She walks off confidently to rejoin her wedding party and new husband, and then the screen fades to black.|$|E

The body was positively identified as being that of Holmes <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>teeth.</b> Holmes was then reburied.|$|E

25|$|Soft Mouth Springers {{are taught}} to deliver game with a soft mouth, meaning he does not {{puncture}} it <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>teeth.</b> The game should always be fit for the table. If a springer damages the bird, {{it may be hard}} mouthed. This is a serious fault, but {{it can be difficult to}} determine whether it may have been genetic or caused by poor training methods. Breeders generally avoid using any springer that is hard mouthed.|$|E
25|$|After {{his captors}} departed, he freed himself by chewing through the ropes <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>teeth,</b> {{and made his}} way through the miles of jungle to American lines. Before {{accepting}} medical attention from Lt. Col. Stanley Radzyminski MD, he gasped a warning to Martin Clemens and Lieutenant Colonel Edwin A. Pollock, whose 2nd Battalion 1st Marines held the defences at the Ilu River mouth. Vouza told him that an estimated 250 to 500 Japanese soldiers were coming to attack his position in any minute. This warning gave the Marines brief but precious time of about 10 minutes to prepare their defences along the Ilu river. The subsequent Battle of the Tenaru was a clear victory for the Marines.|$|E
25|$|Jackson {{learns that}} Django {{is waiting for}} him at Tombstone Cemetery and kills Nathaniel, but not before the latter hides María. Django, resting himself {{on the back of}} Mercedes Zaro’s cross, pulls the trigger guard off his {{revolver}} <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>teeth</b> and rests it against the cross, just as Jackson’s gang arrive. Believing that Django cannot make {{the sign of the cross}} with his mutilated hands, Jackson shoots the corners of Zaro's cross. Django then kills Jackson and his men by pushing the trigger against the cross and repeatedly pulling back the hammer. Leaving his pistol on Zaro’s cross, Django staggers out of the cemetery, ready to start a new life with María.|$|E

500|$|The stage {{antics of}} Santiago often contrasted with his {{generally}} quiet demeanor; he often experimented with his guitar and equipment during songs. Deal's husband, John Murphy, said that during performances of [...] "Vamos", which features guitar feedback throughout, Santiago used to [...] "whack {{the crap out}} of his amp", often picking up the amplifier and moving it around. During some solos, Santiago would often pull the guitar up to his mouth and break guitar strings <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>teeth.</b>|$|E

He lost his first adult tooth when he was twenty-two and had only one left {{by the time that}} he became president. John Adams claimed that he lost them because he used them to crack Brazil nuts, but modern historians suggest that mercury oxide probably contributed to the loss, which he was given to treat illnesses such as smallpox and malaria.|$|E
500|$|In September 1963, after Cox was {{discharged}} from the Army, he and Hendrix moved to Clarksville, Tennessee, and formed a band called the King Kasuals. Hendrix had watched Butch Snipes play <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>teeth</b> in Seattle and by now Alphonso 'Baby Boo' Young, the other guitarist in the band, was performing this guitar gimmick. Not to be upstaged, Hendrix learned to play <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>teeth.</b> He later commented: [...] "The idea of doing that came to me...in Tennessee. Down there {{you have to play}} with your teeth or else you get shot. There's a trail of broken teeth all over the stage." [...] Although they began playing low-paying gigs at obscure venues, the band eventually moved to Nashville's Jefferson Street, which was the traditional heart of the city's black community and home to a thriving rhythm and blues music scene. They earned a brief residency playing at a popular venue in town, the Club del Morocco, and {{for the next two years}} Hendrix made a living performing at a circuit of venues throughout the South that were affiliated with the Theater Owners' Booking Association (TOBA), widely known as the Chitlin' Circuit. In addition to playing in his own band, Hendrix performed as a backing musician for various soul, R, and blues musicians, including Wilson Pickett, Slim Harpo, Sam Cooke, and Jackie Wilson.|$|E

60|$|Batard, the air biting {{into his}} {{exhausted}} lungs like wine, flashed full into the man's face, his jaws missing and coming {{together with a}} metallic clip. They rolled over and over on the snow, Leclere striking madly <b>with</b> <b>his</b> fists. Then they separated, face to face, and circled back and forth before each other. Leclere could have drawn his knife. His rifle was at his feet. But the beast in him was up and raging. He would do the thing <b>with</b> <b>his</b> hands--and <b>his</b> <b>teeth.</b> Batard sprang in, but Leclere knocked him over with a blow of the fist, fell upon him, and buried <b>his</b> <b>teeth</b> to the bone in the dog's shoulder.|$|R
500|$|On September 30, Chandler brought Hendrix to the London Polytechnic at Regent Street, where Cream was {{scheduled}} to perform, and where Hendrix and Eric Clapton met. Clapton later commented: [...] "He {{asked if he could}} play a couple of numbers. I said, 'Of course', but I had a funny feeling about him." [...] Halfway through Cream's set, Hendrix took the stage and performed a frantic version of the Howlin' Wolf song [...] "Killing Floor". In 1989, Clapton described the performance: [...] "He played just about every style you could think of, and not in a flashy way. I mean he did a few of his tricks, like playing <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>teeth</b> and behind his back, but it wasn't in an upstaging sense at all, and that was it... He walked off, and my life was never the same again".|$|E
500|$|Mating {{takes place}} at {{different}} times of the year {{in different parts of the}} manta's range. Courtship is difficult to observe in this fast-swimming fish, although mating [...] "trains" [...] with multiple individuals swimming closely behind each other are sometimes seen in shallow water. The mating sequence may be triggered by a full moon and seems to be initiated by a male following closely behind a female while she travels at around [...] per hour. He makes repeated efforts to grasp her pectoral fin with his mouth, which may take twenty or thirty minutes. Once he has a tight grip, he turns upside-down and presses his ventral side against hers. He then inserts one of his claspers into her cloaca where they remain for sixty to ninety seconds. The clasper forms a tube which channels sperm from the genital papilla; a siphon propels the seminal fluid into the oviduct. The male continues to grip the female's pectoral fin <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>teeth</b> for a further few minutes as both continue to swim, often followed by up to twenty other males. The pair then part. For some reason the male almost always grasps the left pectoral fin, and females often have scars that illustrate this.|$|E
500|$|At Pellew's orders, British {{boarders}} clambered {{onto the}} maindeck, through the gunports of the French frigate and even jumped {{from their own}} rigging onto the French yards. Although the attackers initially encountered fierce resistance, hand-to-hand combat lasted just ten minutes before the leaderless French sailors broke and ran. Gaining the deck, the British boarding party hauled down the tricolour, signifying {{the end of the}} action. Pellew later described the event {{in a letter to his}} brother Samuel as [...] "We dished her up in fifty minutes, boarded and took her". On the quarterdeck they found Captain Mullon, who had been struck in the back by a roundshot which had also torn away most of his left hip and was close to death. Seeing that his ship was in the hands of the enemy, Mullon reached into his pocket for a sheet containing the French coastal codes and tore the paper to shreds <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>teeth</b> before dying. However, he had inadvertently destroyed his commission as ship's captain instead of the codes, which were later found intact on his body. French casualties in the action totalled 63, including Mullon killed and his three lieutenants wounded. Losses aboard Nymphe was almost as severe, Pellew losing 23 men, including five officers, killed and 27 wounded. More than 100 prisoners were then collected from Cléopâtre and sent aboard Nymphe, leaving 150 remaining on the French ship under the guard of the small prize crew. The ships were then separated and made their way to Portsmouth together, arriving there on 21 June.|$|E
