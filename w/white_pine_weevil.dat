40|$|Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst) {{produces}} an oleoresin {{characterized by a}} diverse array of terpenoids, monoterpenoids, sesquiterpenoids, and diterpene resin acids that can protect conifers against potential herbivores and pathogens. Oleoresin accumulates constitutively in resin ducts in the cortex and phloem (bark) of Norway spruce stems. De novo formation of traumatic resin ducts (TDs) is observed in the developing secondary xylem (wood) after insect attack, fungal elicitation, and mechanical wounding. Here, we characterize the methyl jasmonate-induced formation of TDs in Norway spruce by microscopy, chemical analyses of resin composition, and assays of terpenoid biosynthetic enzymes. The response involves tissue-specific differentiation of TDs, terpenoid accumulation, and induction of enzyme activities of both prenyltransferases and terpene synthases in the developing xylem, a tissue that constitutively lacks axial resin ducts in spruce. The induction of a complex defense response in Norway spruce by methyl jasmonate application provides new avenues to evaluate the role of resin defenses for protection of conifers against destructive pests such as <b>white</b> <b>pine</b> <b>weevils</b> (Pissodes strobi), bark beetles (Coleoptera, Scolytidae), and insect-associated tree pathogens...|$|R
40|$|Stem-boring {{insects and}} methyl jasmonate (MeJA) {{are thought to}} induce similar complex {{chemical}} and anatomical defenses in conifers. To compare insect- and MeJA-induced terpenoid responses, we analyzed traumatic oleoresin mixtures, emissions of terpenoid volatiles, and expression of terpenoid synthase (TPS) genes in Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) following attack by <b>white</b> <b>pine</b> <b>weevils</b> (Pissodes strobi) or application of MeJA. Both insects and MeJA caused traumatic resin accumulation in stems, with more accumulation induced by the weevils. Weevil-induced terpenoid emission profiles were also more complex than emissions induced by MeJA. Weevil feeding caused a rapid release of a blend of monoterpene olefins, presumably by passive evaporation of resin compounds from stem feeding sites. These compounds were not found in MeJA-induced emissions. Both weevils and MeJA caused delayed, diurnal emissions of (−) -linalool, indicating induced de novo biosynthesis of this compound. TPS transcripts strongly increased in stems upon insect attack or MeJA treatment. Time courses and intensity of induced TPS transcripts were different for monoterpene synthases, sesquiterpene synthases, and diterpene synthases. Increased levels of weevil- and MeJA-induced TPS transcripts accompanied major changes in terpenoid accumulation in stems. Induced TPS expression profiles in needles were less complex than those in stems and matched induced de novo emissions of (−) -linalool. Overall, weevils and MeJA induced similar, but not identical, terpenoid defense responses in Sitka spruce.

40|$|Conifers are {{resistant}} to attack from {{a large number of}} potential herbivores or pathogens. Previous molecular and biochemical characterization of selected conifer defence systems support a model of multigenic, constitutive and induced defences that act on invading insects via physical, chemical, biochemical or ecological (multitrophic) mechanisms. However, the genomic foundation of the complex defence and resistance mechanisms of conifers is largely unknown. As part of a genomics strategy to characterize inducible defences and possible resistance mechanisms of conifers against insect herbivory, we developed a cDNA microarray building upon a new spruce (Picea spp.) expressed sequence tag resource. This first-generation spruce cDNA microarray contains 9720 cDNA elements representing c. 5500 unique genes. We used this array to monitor gene expression in Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) bark in response to herbivory by <b>white</b> <b>pine</b> <b>weevils</b> (Pissodes strobi, Curculionidae) or wounding, and in young shoot tips in response to western spruce budworm (Choristoneura occidentalis, Lepidopterae) feeding. Weevils are stem-boring insects that feed on phloem, while budworms are foliage feeding larvae that consume needles and young shoot tips. Both insect species and wounding treatment caused substantial changes of the host plant transcriptome detected in each case by differential gene expression of several thousand array elements at 1 or 2 d after the onset of treatment. Overall, there was considerable overlap among differentially expressed gene sets from these three stress treatments. Functional classification of the induced transcripts revealed genes with roles in general plant defence, octadecanoid and ethylene signalling, transport, secondary metabolism, and transcriptional regulation. Several genes involved in primary metabolic processes such as photosynthesis were down-regulated upon insect feeding or wounding, fitting with the concept of dynamic resource allocation in plant defence. Refined expression analysis using gene-specific primers and real-time PCR for selected transcripts was in agreement with microarray results for most genes tested. This study provides the first large-scale survey of insect-induced defence transcripts in a gymnosperm and provides a platform for functional investigation of plant-insect interactions in spruce. Induction of spruce genes of octadecanoid and ethylene signalling, terpenoid biosynthesis, and phenolic secondary metabolism are discussed in more detail. ...|$|R
40|$|In plants, {{relationships}} between resistance to herbivorous insect pests and growth are typically controlled by complex interactions between genetically correlated traits.

Genetical genomics uses genetic perturbations caused by allelic segregation in pedigrees to co-locate quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for gene expression and quantitative traits. Bark tissue of apical leaders from 188 trees was assayed for gene expression using a 21. 8 K spruce EST-spotted microarray; the same individuals were genotyped for 384 SNP markers for the genetic map. Many of the expression QTLs (eQTL) co-localized with resistance trait QTLs. For a composite resistance phenotype of six attack and oviposition traits, 149 positional candidate genes were identified. Resistance and growth QTLs also overlapped with eQTL hotspots along the genome suggesting that: 1) genetic pleiotropy of resistance and growth traits in interior spruce was substantial, and 2) master regulatory genes were important for weevil resistance in spruce.

Leaders from 331 trees were wounded just below the apical bud with a 1-mm diameter drill, coinciding with the natural time of weevil oviposition in the spring. Leaders were removed in the autumn, and the bark and xylem from {{the upper and lower}} regions of the leader extracted and analyzed by gas chromatography. Unwounded trees had low amounts of resin in xylem compared with bark. In response to wounding, volatile terpenes and diterpene resin acids increased in the upper xylem (area of wounding), with resistant trees showing a greater increase than susceptible trees. Wounding caused monoterpenes in particular to decrease in the lower region of the leader (away from the drilled area) in greater amounts in susceptible trees than in resistant trees. In response to wounding, the proportion of monoterpene to resin acid increased in the upper and lower xylem of resistant trees, and slightly increased in the upper xylem of susceptible trees. Monoterpene-enriched resin is more fluid than constitutive resin, and probably flows more readily into oviposition cavities and larval mines, where it may kill immature weevils. Loss of resin components in the lower xylem suggested catabolism and transport of these materials to the site of wounding; however, energetic and regulatory data are necessary to confirm this hypothesis.

When reared in the laboratory on non-diapausing Pissodes castaneus, mountain populations of E. semirugosus and E. robustus entered into an obligatory diapause in the host larva, whereas all the other populations tested developed continuously. Diapausing larvae continued their development only after having experienced at least three months at 2 °C. Non-diapausing populations of Eubazus spp. significantly differed in the duration of pre-imaginal development, with E. semirugosus being the fastest developing species and E. robustus the slowest. Outdoor rearings of Eubazus spp. on P. castaneus showed that E. crassigaster, Eubazus sp. and the lowland biotype of E. semirugosus emerged {{in the year of}} oviposition if this occurred early enough to allow parasitoid development. In contrast, a majority of E. robustus individuals overwintered in the host larvae, regardless of the oviposition date. The diapausing, mountain biotype of E. semirugosus is considered as the most promising candidate for control of P. strobi in Canada, because {{it is likely to be}} better adapted to the life cycle of the target host than the other Eubazus spp., including the native E. crassigaste...|$|E
40|$|Attack by the <b>white</b> <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> has notably reduced Sitka spruce {{productivity}} in British Columbia (BC) (Canada) and western US. By the 1970 s, the BC Ministry of Forests established provenance trials of Sitka spruce {{with the objective}} of detecting usable genetic resistance to weevil. These early trials reported significant weevil resistance and allowed the production of the first (F 1) controlled-cross progeny generation with demonstrable weevil resistance (R) or susceptibility (S). This study reports results of the screening for weevil resistance and the levels of constitutive defenses of this F 1 Sitka spruce progeny. Progeny from resistant parents (R × R progeny) sustained significantly fewer weevil attacks than progeny from susceptible parents (S × S progeny) or progeny with one resistant and one susceptible parent (R × S progeny). Individual and family heritability estimates of the weevil resistance were 0. 5 and 0. 9, respectively. Constitutive defenses, measured by resin canal and sclereid cell density in the cortex, were significantly higher in R × R progeny than in R × S or S × S progeny. We observed a negative correlation between the percentage of trees attacked in each cross and the average density of the resin canals or sclereid cells for each cross. © 2012 Institute of Chartered Foresters.

40|$|Geographic {{variation}} in resin canal defenses in seedlings from the Sitka spruce × white spruce introgression zone G. A. O’Neill, S. N. Aitken, J. N. King, and R. I. Alfaro Abstract: Seedlings from 18 provenances along a coast–interior transect in the Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carrière × Picea glauca (Moench) Voss introgression zone in northwestern British Columbia were mechanically wounded {{at the beginning}} of their third growing season to simulate natural attack by the <b>white</b> <b>pine</b> <b>weevil,</b> Pissodes strobi (Peck). Constitutive resin canals (CRC) in the cortex and traumatic resin canals (TRC) in the xylem of terminal shoots were characterized microscopically 4 months after wounding. Wounding resulted in a large increase in CRC size and in TRC number and density. Provenances differed significantly in TRC number and in CRC number, size, total area, and the proportion of total bark area occupied by CRC. CRC number and size, TRC number, and provenance weevil resistance (obtained from previously published data) increased with increasing latitude, elevation, and distance from the Pacific Ocean (i. e., towards the P. glauca end of the introgression zone) and decreased with increasing longitude (i. e., towards P. sitchensis). These traits also increased with aridity and continentality and decreased with most temperature, precipita-tion, and growing season length variables.

40|$|For {{many years}} <b>Pine</b> <b>weevil</b> (Hylobius abietis) {{has been one}} of the most common pests for young conifer {{seedlings}} in the northern part of Europe. Chemical protection was commonly used to protect conifer seedlings. Nowadays, certification systems such as FSC and PEFC are wide spread and include rules to reduce the use of chemicals. In the near future, a ban on using insecticides in forestry will be a reality and development of other kinds of <b>Pine</b> <b>weevil</b> protection will be necessary. Mechanical protection is one possible solution to reduce the damage caused by the <b>Pine</b> <b>weevil.</b> ÅSSI Plantskydd AB has invented a new method for application of mechanical <b>Pine</b> <b>weevil</b> protection. A study of the wax machine was performed to compare the competitiveness to other systems used for treating conifer seedlings with <b>Pine</b> <b>weevil</b> protection. The conclusions of the study are that the working environment is relatively good at the wax machine and it is possible to increase capacity in the future. The wax machine is also more profitable than manual systems at a production capacity of 2 250 000 treated seedlings per season for the first active year after the investment is done. For the following years the wax machine is more profitable than manual methods already at a production capacity of 500 000 treated seedlings per season...|$|R
40|$|The large <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> is {{the most}} serious pest of conifer {{reforestation}} in Ireland. The adult weevil causes damage by feeding on the bark of young transplants. With up to 100, 000 adult weevils emerging per hectare on recently felled conifer sites, {{it is not uncommon for}} 100 % of young plants to be killed. <b>Pine</b> <b>weevils</b> are susceptible to attack from a number of natural enemies such as fungi, parasites and predators.
