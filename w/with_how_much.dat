5|$|The {{strength}} of research support for each recommendation varies; {{some of the}} more robustly researched and supported recommendations include the negative effects of noisy sleep environments, alcohol consumption in the hours before sleep, engaging in mentally difficult tasks before sleep, and trying too hard to fall asleep. There is a lack of evidence for the effects of certain sleep hygiene recommendations, including getting a more comfortable mattress, removing bedroom clocks, not worrying, and limiting liquids. Other recommendations, such as the effects of napping or exercise, have a more complicated evidence base. The effects of napping, for example, seem to depend on the length and timing of napping, in conjunction <b>with</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> cumulative sleep an individual has had in recent nights.|$|E

25|$|There {{was also}} some hostility between players and management, {{not the least}} of which came to a head when Carmine Isacco was sent home by the team for no {{apparent}} reason. Speculation was that management was unhappy <b>with</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> they were paying him, and were trying to run him out of town. While not public, there was a series of disturbing occurrences behind the scenes that reinforce that speculation.|$|E

25|$|For Kelly Kapowski, {{the love}} {{interest}} of both Zack and Slater, producers {{were able to}} narrow the field down to three actresses: Tiffani-Amber Thiessen, Elizabeth Berkley, and Jennie Garth. Engel had originally met Thiessen in 1988 while casting for Good Morning, Miss Bliss and was impressed <b>with</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> her acting had improved. He wanted her for the role, believing she had the perfect all-American girl appeal for the role, while others felt that Berkley, as the more experienced actress, {{would be a more}} reliable choice. Ultimately, Engel convinced the others after a read-through with Lopez, and Thiessen received the role.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the release}} of The Phantom Pain, many ascertained that the {{tensions}} between Konami and Kojima had {{had an effect on}} the development of the game which could be seen in the end product, specifically with regards to the storyline. The decision to force players to replay past missions to progress through the second half of the story was criticized, with one theory being that original content had been envisioned but which had not been incorporated into the finished game, resulting in the reused sections for time constraints. Another aspect that received similar criticism was the story ending, which many agreed felt abrupt and left several plot points unresolved. The general consensus was that such shortcomings with the design choices had resulted from Konami giving strict deadlines for the game's release, as well as their dissatisfaction <b>with</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> money Kojima had spent on development.|$|E
500|$|The {{nature of}} the fight with Ryan led to a much {{anticipated}} re-match at Cassiobury Park, Hertfordshire on 11February 1789. At stake was prize money of 600guineas, as well as Johnson's title of champion. Humphries again acted as Johnson's second and a man called Jackson was his bottle-holder. The fight consisted of one round of mutually displayed skill, during which Johnson was felled, and thereafter was brutal passion. Egan described it as [...] It was over in 33 minutes, when Ryan gave up the fight. One spectator, a Mr Hollingsworth, who was a corn factor and had at one time employed Johnson, was so impressed and pleased <b>with</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> he had made from betting on Johnson that he settled a £20 per annum gift for life on the fighter.|$|E

The building also received the 2000 AIA Portland Chapter Honor Award, the 2000 Portland General Electric EarthSmart Award, the 2001 AIA American Library Association Award of Excellence (for its [...] "simple and elegant design") and the 2002 Chicago Athenaeum American Architecture Award. The Illuminating Engineering Society of North America presented an award for the library's quality lighting design.

500|$|Eric Ford, also of TouchArcade, {{found the}} {{gameplay}} [...] "basic" [...] as well—"not much here that truly innovates within the genre"—but {{felt that the}} game was worth experiencing for its [...] "excellent visual style and soundtrack". He, too, compared the gameplay to Ski Safari and wrote that while the game's power-ups, quest objectives, currency, and score were [...] "pretty standard", the trick system was praiseworthy and gave even easy tricks a sense of [...] "accomplishment". Ford was not enticed by the available upgrades and wrote that he played not for the upgrades but for the game's [...] "whole look and feel" [...] that was made to feel like more than a game with its [...] "awesome", [...] "mellow", and [...] "soothing" [...] soundtrack. Ford added that the game earned [...] "its hype" [...] from its [...] "amazing art style and visual effects" [...] rather than from its gameplay. He was impressed <b>with</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> the dynamic weather changed {{the feel of the}} game even while the gameplay went unchanged. Ford predicted that players would respond to Alto's Adventure either in appreciation of its [...] "sheer amount of artistic integrity and nuanced visuals", or in disappointment by its similarity to previous endless runners.|$|E

2500|$|The British {{national}} newspaper The Independent {{reported on}} a study carried out by CNW Marketing Research which suggested that CO2 emissions alone {{do not reflect the}} true environmental costs of a car.

[...] The newspaper also reported that the CNW research put the Jeep Wrangler above the Toyota Prius and other hybrid cars as the greenest car that could be bought in the US. However, it was noted that Toyota disputed the proportion of energy used to make a car compared <b>with</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> the vehicle uses during its life; CNW said 80% of the energy a car uses is accounted for by manufacture and 20% in use.

2500|$|The role {{reversal}} between Travolta and Cage was {{a subject of}} praise, as were the stylized, violent action sequences. Critic Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film {{three out of four}} and remarked that, [...] "Here, using big movie stars and asking them to play each other, Woo and his writers find a terrific counterpoint to the action scenes: All through the movie, you find yourself reinterpreting every scene as you realize the [...] "other" [...] character is [...] "really" [...] playing it." [...] Rolling Stones Peter Travers said of the film, [...] "You may not buy the premise or the windup, but with Travolta and Cage taking comic and psychic measures of their characters and their own careers, there is no resisting Face/Off. This you gotta see."

2500|$|Emotion is a {{large part}} of trauma, {{especially}} near death experiences. The effect emotions have on memory in different instances {{is an integral part of}} the effect of trauma on memory. [...] Emotional events tend to be recalled with more frequency and clarity than memories not associated with extreme emotions. [...] Typically traumatic events, such as physical attack or sexual abuse, are interrelated with strong negative emotions, causing these memories to be very strong and more easily recalled than memories not associated with similar emotions, or even those connected to positive emotions. [...] Emotion's strong connection with memory also has to do <b>with</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> attention or focus an individual has on the event. [...] If they are heavily emotionally involved in the event, a lot of their attention is directed at what's happening, rendering it a stronger memory. [...] It is also the case with emotionally aroused situations that even if attention is limited, it is more likely that a memory associated with the strong emotion will remain as opposed to some neutral stimulus. [...] Chemically, this is because the emotional and physical stress caused by traumatic events creates an almost identical stimulation in the brain to the physiological condition that heightens memory retention. [...] It excites the neuron-chemical activity centers of the brain that affects memory encoding and recollection. [...] This reaction has been enforced by evolution as learning from high-stress environments is necessary in [...] "fight or flight" [...] decisions that characterize human survival.|$|E
