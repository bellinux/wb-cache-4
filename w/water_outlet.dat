However, in many cases, the tower overhead is not easily condensed totally and the reflux drum must include a vent gas outlet stream. In yet other cases, the overhead stream may also contain water vapor because either the feed stream contains some water or some steam is injected into the distillation tower (which {{is the case in}} the crude oil distillation towers in oil refineries). In those cases, if the distillate product is insoluble in water, the reflux drum may contain a condensed liquid distillate phase, a condensed water phase and a non-condensible gas phase, which makes it necessary that the reflux drum also have a <b>water</b> <b>outlet</b> stream.|$|E

40|$|Background and aims. Dental {{handpiece}} is {{a source}} of contamination because it is in constant touch with the oral cavity. Sterilization {{does not seem to be}} sufficient to prevent penetration of microorganisms into air and water lines of the unit, because negative pressure developed by valves (which are placed in <b>water</b> <b>outlets)</b> and post shut-off inertial rotation of handpiece result in water and debris being sucked into air and <b>water</b> <b>outlets</b> of dental unit. The aim of this study was to compare dental unit contamination following use of clean head system handpieces and conventional handpieces. Materials and methods. Twenty-two dental units in the Department of Pediatric Dentistry in Shahid Beheshti Faculty of Dentistry were used for the purpose of this study. A 1. 5 × 108 cfu/mm 3 concentration of Staphylococcus epidermis (SE) was used to contaminate the air and <b>water</b> <b>outlets</b> of dental units. Ten clean head system handpieces and 10 conventional handpieces were used for 30 seconds in the above-mentioned suspension. Microbial samples were collected from the air and water lines.

Data results from two monitoring campaigns in foul sewer systems in the Netherlands and Germany show the level of detail with which in-sewer processes can be studied. Storm water inflow can be detected as long as the temperature of this inflow differs from the in-sewer temperatures prior to the event. Also, the insewer propagation of storm water can be monitored, enabling a detailed view on advection-dispersion and mixing processes. Water ManagementCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
