25|$|For me, playing {{together}} again was {{to close the}} chapter on that era. We played those songs so we can hopefully move forward and do new music that represents <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>now.</b> When playing those songs, I thought, 'Here's a person {{at the time that}} I don't relate to anymore.' He didn't care about his life and was doing drugs and was really disconnected from the world {{and a whole lot of}} other personal stuff that I won't get into. If I give myself to that, I can feel the psychological effects of that personality in the same way that an actor can say it wasn't healthy to live in that role so long or bring that role home every night.|$|E
500|$|Through its {{treatment}} of locative technology, the novel revisits notions of virtual reality and cyberspace prominent in Gibson's early cyberpunk fiction. One character proposes that cyberspace is everting; becoming an integral and indistinguishable element {{of the physical world}} rather than a domain to be visited. During the book tour for the novel, Gibson elaborated on this theme, proposing that the ubiquity of connectivity meant that what had been called [...] "cyberspace" [...] is no longer a discrete sphere of activity separate from and secondary to normal human activity, but that those increasingly less common parts of normal life free from connectivity were the exception. [...] "If the book has a point to make <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> with cyberspace", he commented, it was that cyberspace [...] "has colonized our everyday life and continues to colonize everyday life." ...|$|E
500|$|As the Republican presidential {{nomination}} race {{went into the}} primaries season, Romney had not endorsed anyone but {{was one of the}} Republican establishment figures who were becoming increasingly concerned about the front-runner status of New York businessman Donald Trump. Romney publicly criticized Trump for not releasing his taxes, saying there might be a [...] "bombshell" [...] in them. Trump responded by calling Romney [...] "one of the dumbest and worst candidates in the history of Republican politics." [...] Then Romney gave a speech on March 3, 2016, at the Hinckley Institute of Politics, that represented a scathing attack on Trump's personal behavior, business performance, and domestic and foreign policy stances. He said Trump was [...] "a phony, a fraud ... He's playing members of the American public for suckers" [...] and that [...] "If we Republicans choose Donald Trump as our nominee, the prospects for a safe and prosperous future are greatly diminished." [...] In response Trump dismissed Romney as a [...] "choke artist". [...] Romney's speech represented an unprecedented attack by a major U.S. party's most recent presidential nominee against the party's current front-runner for the nomination. Romney encouraged Republicans to engage in tactical voting, by supporting whichever of the remaining rivals had the best chance to beat Trump in any given state, and as such Romney announced he was voting for, although not endorsing, Ted Cruz for president prior to the March 22 Utah caucus. [...] As the race went on, there was some evidence of tactical voting occurring, and some partial arrangements were formed among candidates, but by May 3 Trump had defeated all his opponents and became the party's presumptive nominee. [...] Romney then announced that he would not support Trump in the general election, saying, [...] "I am dismayed at <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>now,</b> I wish we had better choices".|$|E

50|$|The strongest {{argument}} for us probably {{being in a}} simulation I think is the following: 40 years ago we had Pong - two rectangles and a dot.

2500|$|According to Simon Price of The Independent, [...] "It Ain't Easy" [...] is {{reminiscent}} of [...] "Rock Is Dead" [...] by Marilyn Manson. Alex Roginski of the Sydney Morning Herald wrote that the song [...] "utilises electro clash for a grinding foray into R" [...] K. Ross Hoffman of AllMusic noted that the song [...] "pits a menacingly swung, twangy guitar riff", which according to him is [...] "lifted so blatantly" [...] from Depeche Mode's song, [...] "Personal Jesus". Buchanan spoke of the song's lyrical content and meaning, saying: [...] "It's basically about us as people. It's not easy being <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>now,</b> {{trying to keep a}} balance between normality and doing this. When you're content within yourself, you should know how you are, and people around us know what we're like." ...|$|E
2500|$|After signing their {{deal with}} Forefront, the band started writing and {{recording}} demo songs similar to [...] "My God" [...] {{for the first}} album. The band has described this period as one of adaptation and experimentation since ForeFront wanted a hip-hop act. As a result, Dave Stuart and Ron Gibson left the band. Singer Mark Stuart {{said in an interview}} [...] "We had no idea what we were doing. Forefront signed us to do this rap/metal stuff, and we only had one song" [...] while original guitarist Barry Blair said [...] "We thought 'If they liked My God, we'll send them more songs like that." [...] Blair added that it was a [...] "big, long process of getting to <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>now,</b> of creating music we like, not music we think is what they [...] would like." ...|$|E
2500|$|More {{than ever}} before we have access to {{information}} {{that allows us to}} reflect on the causes and consequences of our actions. At the same time we are faced with dangers related to unintended consequences of our actions and by our reliance on the knowledge of experts. We create, maintain and revise a set of biographical narratives, social roles and lifestyles – the story of who we are, and how we came to be <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>now.</b> We are increasingly free to choose {{what we want to do}} and who we want to be (although Giddens contends that wealth gives access to more options). But increased choice can be both liberating and troubling. Liberating in the sense of increasing the likelihood of one's self-fulfilment, and troubling in form of increased emotional stress and time needed to analyse the available choices and minimise risk of which we are increasingly aware (what Giddens sums up as [...] "manufacturing uncertainty"). While in earlier, traditional societies we would be provided with that narrative and social role, in the post-traditional society we are usually forced to create one ourselves.

2500|$|I met Henry James {{the other}} night at Emerson's, at an Alcottian conversation, at which, however, Alcott did not talk much, being {{disturbed}} by James's opposition. [...] The latter is a hearty man enough, with whom you can differ very satisfactorily, both {{on account of his}} doctrines and his good temper. [...] He utters quasi-philanthropic dogmas in a metaphysic dress; but they are, for all practical purposes, very crude. [...] He charges society with all the crime committed, and praises the criminal for committing it. [...] But I think that all the remedies he suggests out of his head—for he goes no farther, hearty as he is—would leave us about <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>now.</b> [...] For, of course, it is not by a gift of turkeys on Thanksgiving Day that he proposes to convert the criminal, but by a true sympathy with each one,—with him, among the rest, who lying tells the world from the gallows that he has never been treated kindly by a single mortal since he was born. [...] But it is not so easy a thing to sympathize with another, though you may have the best disposition to do it. [...] There is Dobson over the hill. [...] Have not you and I and all the world been trying to sympathize with him since he was born (as doubtless he with us), and yet we have got no further than to send him to the House of Correction once at least; and he, on the other hand, has sent us to another place several times. [...] This is the real state of things as I understand it, at least so far as James's remedies. [...] We are now, alas! exercising what charity we actually have, and new laws would not give us any more. [...] But perchance, we might make some improvements in the House of Correction. [...] You and I are Dobson; what will James do for us?.|$|E

They have no wool nor horns, but are rather hairy like a goat; nor should I call them sheep, but that their flesh eats like mutton, and I knew not what else to call them.

A good place to look is in the burgeoning area of Internet and mobile technology. Accordingly, this paper explores the issues and prospect for disability and mobile Internet. It provides {{a brief history of}} the entwined nature of the rise of disability and the Internet, discusses the emergence of mobile Internets, and then turns to a discussion of mobile Web accessibility. It concludes by noting the limits of mobile Web accessibility, for its struggle to adopt an expanded concept of disability — but also because of growing complexity of mobile Internets.

The vegetation is exceedingly sparse, consisting chiefly of stunted mezquit and the larrea Mexicana. Near the arroyo, where water sometimes finds its way, a few mezquit bushes have attained the height of ten feet, whose brilliant hue is most agreeable to the eye, amid so much barrenness. A little grass was found in clumps {{about a mile from}} our camp in an arroyo, whither our animals were sent. This, with the young shoots of the mezquit, was all they had.
