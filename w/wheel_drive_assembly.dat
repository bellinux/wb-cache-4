40|$|A {{developmental}} {{test plan}} for the wheel and <b>wheel</b> <b>drive</b> <b>assembly</b> of the dual-mode (manned/automated) lunar surface roving vehicle is presented. The tests cover performance, as well as critical environmental characteristics. Insofar as practical, the environmental conditions imposed {{will be in the}} sequence expected during the hardware's life from storage through the lunar mission. Test procedures are described for static load deflection and endurance tests. Soft soil tests to determine mobility characteristics including drawbar-pull and thrust vs slip, and motion resistance for various wheel loads are also discussed. Test designs for both ambient and thermal vacuum conditions are described. Facility, transducer, and instrumentation requirements are outlined...|$|E

50|$|StreetStrider is {{the brand}} name for a mobile {{elliptical}} trainer. The StreetStrider consists of a T-shaped lower frame to which two front wheels and a rear <b>wheel</b> containing a <b>drive</b> <b>assembly</b> are attached, and an upright frame to which two reciprocating arm levers are attached. Two elongated foot platforms {{on either side of}} the lower frame are attached to cranks as part of the <b>drive</b> <b>assembly,</b> which, as with bicycle drivetrain systems, also includes a hub, a rotating axle, and an internal hub gear system translating the axle rotation to the hub. The StreetStrider <b>drive</b> <b>assembly</b> is either chained or chainless direct drive, depending on model. The lower end of each arm lever is attached to the front end of each foot platform, which, by connection in the rear to the rotating crank arm and in the front to the pivoting arm lever, moves generally in an elliptical path. The device also includes a leaning mechanism for steering, as well as brakes and multiple gearing. It was developed by David W. Kraus.|$|R
40|$|A Mars rover {{prototype}} vehicle named Rocky 4 {{was designed}} and built at JPL during the fall of 1991 and spring 1992. This vehicle is the fourth {{in a series of}} rovers designed to test vehicle mobility and navigation software. Rocky 4 was the first attempt to design a vehicle with 'flight like' mass and functionality. It was consequently necessary to develop highly efficient mechanisms and structures to meet the vehicles very tight mass limit of 3 Kg for the entire mobility system (7 Kg for the full system). This paper will discuss the key mechanisms developed for the rover's innovative drive and suspension system. These are the <b>wheel</b> <b>drive</b> and strut <b>assembly,</b> the rocker-bogie suspension mechanism and the differential pivot. The end-to-end design, analysis, fabrication and testing of these components will also be discussed as will their performance during field testing. The lessons learned from Rocky 4 are already proving invaluable for the design of Rocky 6. Rocky 6 is currently being designed to fly on NASA's MESUR mission to Mars scheduled to launch in 1996...|$|R

50|$|Further, the 993's {{optional}} all <b>wheel</b> <b>drive</b> {{system was}} refined over {{that of the}} 964. Porsche departed from the 964's setup consisting of three differentials and revised the system based on the layout from its 959 supercar, replacing the centre differential with a viscous coupling unit. In conjunction with the 993's redesigned suspension, this system improved handling characteristics in inclement weather and still retained the stability offered by all <b>wheel</b> <b>drive</b> without having to suffer as many compromises as the past all <b>wheel</b> <b>drive</b> system. Its simpler layout also reduced the earlier all <b>wheel</b> <b>drive</b> system's weight, though the four <b>wheel</b> <b>drive</b> C4 weighs 111 pounds (50 kg) more than the rear <b>wheel</b> <b>drive</b> version (at 3,131 pounds vs. 3,020 pounds or 1,420 kg vs. 1,370 kg).|$|R

50|$|An {{exception}} is during positive acceleration when {{the engine power}} is driving two or fewer wheels. In this situation where all the tires are not being utilized load transfer can be advantageous.
