5|$|Nixon: Hello, Neil and Buzz. I'm {{talking to}} you by {{telephone}} from the Oval Room at the White House. And this certainly {{has to be the}} most historic telephone call ever made. I just can't tell you how proud we all are of what you've done. For every American, this has to be the proudest day of our lives. And for people all over the world, I am sure they too join with Americans in recognizing what an immense feat this is. Because of <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>done,</b> the heavens have become a part of man's world. And as you talk to us from the Sea of Tranquility, it inspires us to redouble our efforts to bring peace and tranquility to Earth. For one priceless moment in the whole history of man, all the people on this Earth are truly one: one in their pride in <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>done,</b> and one in our prayers that you will return safely to Earth.|$|E
25|$|You stand {{convicted of}} the truly evil {{abduction}} and murder of a vulnerable young girl in 1991 and thereafter of attempting to defeat the ends of justice in various ways over an extended period... Yet again you have shown yourself to be unfit {{to live in a}} decent society. It is hard for me to convey the loathing and revulsion that ordinary people will feel for <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>done...</b> I fix the minimum period which you must spend in custody at 30 years. Had it been open to me I would have made that period run consecutive to the 21 year custodial period that you are already serving.|$|E
25|$|You have no {{idea what}} sending on those checks to me at this time. After {{fighting}} for an idea all your life I realize that your backing has saved it for me and meant to thank you with all my heart and soul for <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>done.</b> It has been marvelous. So many letters have been written and not mailed and owing to having been in bed {{a great deal of time}} this summer, the paintings were about all I could muster up enough energy to do what I considered the best of my ability. Just before Stieglitz’s death I took some paintings to him that I considered as having something new in the. He immediately walked right up to them and spoke of the new ideas. His intuition in that way was remarkable and I am so glad to have been allowed to live during his and your lifetimes. It has been a great privilege for which I am truly thankful.|$|E
6000|$|... "Writing {{seemed so}} unsatisfactory, after <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> for me, and I never can express myself in writing. I seem to congeal." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why to you--after <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>done.</b> Don't <b>you</b> {{remember}} that {{it was you who}} introduced us--?" [...] And she paused with a fatigued delicacy.|$|R
6000|$|... "Staniford!" [...] said Dunham, in {{an accent}} of reproach. [...] "You do her great injustice. She felt <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> {{in the way}} you would wish,--if you cared." ...|$|R
500|$|Robinson's Hollywood exploits, however, did not {{sit well}} with Dodgers {{co-owner}} Walter O'Malley, who referred to Robinson as [...] "Rickey's prima donna". In late 1950, Rickey's contract as the Dodgers' team President expired. Weary of constant disagreements with O'Malley, and with no hope of being re-appointed as President of the Dodgers, Rickey cashed out his one-quarter financial interest in the team, leaving O'Malley in full control of the franchise. Rickey shortly thereafter became general manager of the Pittsburgh Pirates. Robinson was disappointed at the turn of events and wrote a sympathetic letter to Rickey, whom he considered a father figure, stating, [...] "Regardless of what happens to me in the future, it all can be placed on <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> and, believe me, I appreciate it." ...|$|E
500|$|Sinatra {{received}} three honorary degrees {{during his}} lifetime. In May 1976, {{he was invited}} to speak at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV) graduation commencement held at Sam Boyd Stadium. It was at this commencement that he was bestowed an Honorary Doctorate litterarum humanarum by the university. During his speech, Sinatra noted that his education had come from [...] "the school of hard knocks" [...] and was suitably touched by the award. He went on to describe that [...] "this is the first educational degree I have ever held in my hand. I will never forget <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> for me today". A few years later in 1984 and 1985, Sinatra also received an Honorary Doctorate of Fine Arts from Loyola Marymount University as well as an Honorary Doctorate of Engineering from the Stevens Institute of Technology.|$|E
2500|$|Two {{weeks before}} his murder, Peter had confronted his son about his {{dishonesty}} in an email: [...] "Did you forge my signature as a co-signer?... What {{the hell are}} you doing? You should have called me to discuss it... I'm calling Citibank this morning to find out <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> and am going to tell them I'm not to be on it as a co-signer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Faraday told me {{all about}} <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> to this paper," [...] he said. [...] "I came to see if you would let me in on it. I want work." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{helped you}} to escape," [...] Macheson said, [...] "but I <b>did</b> not know <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>done.</b> There is another matter. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> {{to go away}} from here quietly and swear never to molest----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What did {{you expect}} when {{you asked me to}} see <b>you?</b> <b>What?</b> <b>You</b> know me. I am Lingard. You lived with me. You've heard men speak. <b>You</b> knew <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>done.</b> Well! <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> expect?" ...|$|R
2500|$|In 1984, he was {{accepted}} {{as a member of}} the Athenaeum, a gentlemen's club in London's Pall Mall, after being proposed by Cardinal Basil Hume. He met Prince Charles through mutual charity interests, and Charles reportedly sent him gifts on his 80th birthday and a note reading: [...] "Nobody will ever know <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> for this country, Jimmy. This is to go some way in thanking you for that." ...|$|E
2500|$|... (You {{have just}} shown, at {{the capture of}} the citadel of Nam Dinh, the same enthusiasm, the same valour and the same devotion as at the capture of the citadel of Hanoi. [...] I congratulate you all, making no {{distinction}} between those there then and those here now, between old hands and newcomers; and our brave colonel who was wounded at your head sees you as I do. [...] Our country, whose heart has followed you into these far-off regions, will soon thrill with emotion and pride when it learns <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>done.</b> [...] Long live France!) ...|$|E
2500|$|In April 2008, Reddy was {{reported}} to be living [...] "simply and frugally off song royalties, pension funds, and social security... a 13th-floor apartment with a 180-degree view of Sydney Harbour." [...] Her apartment had been recently appraised, causing Reddy concern over its future affordability; however, the New York-based landlord learned his tenant's identity and wrote her: [...] "I had no idea it was *the* Helen Reddy who was living in my unit. Because of <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> for millions of women all over the world, I will not sell or raise your rent. I hope you'll be very happy living there for years to come." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! {{here you}} are. I just told Father Esteban that you talked of leaving to-morrow, {{and that he}} would have to excuse me a few moments while <b>you</b> showed me <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> to the old garden." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It quite terrified {{him when}} he first saw <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> to it this morning," [...] she added. [...] "He {{declares}} it will come down upon us and cleave us, like 'the sword of the Lord and of Gideon.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By no means," [...] said Cyaxares, [...] "your {{grandfather}} {{would be}} very much displeased to know <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>done.</b> He would not only condemn you for acting thus, but he would reprove us too, severely, for allowing you to do so." ...|$|R
2500|$|After {{retiring}} {{for less}} than three hours, the jury returned to deliver a guilty verdict. On 22 August 2000, while sentencing Dupas to life imprisonment without the opportunity for release on parole, Judge Frank Vincent remarked [...] "...the prospects of your eventual rehabilitation must be regarded as so close to hopeless {{that they can be}} effectively discounted. There is no indication whatsoever that you have experienced any sense of remorse for <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>done,</b> and I doubt that you are capable of any such human response. At a fundamental level, as human beings, you present for us the awful, threatening and unanswerable question: How did you come to be as you are?" ...|$|E
2500|$|For a {{long time}} past, I have read nothing in {{contemporary}} fiction that approaches <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> here. [...] When you next take up your pen, will you consider a little whether your tendency to dwell on what is grotesque and violent in human character does not require some discipline? [...] your power as a writer sometimes misleads you, as I think, into forgetting the value of contrast. The grand picture which your story presents of terror and grief wants relief. Individually and collectively, there is variety in the human lot. We are no more continuously wretched than we are continuously happy. Next time, I want more humour, [...] More breaks of sunshine in your splendid cloudy sky will be a truer picture of nature-and will certainly enlarge the number of your admiring readers.|$|E
2500|$|To reach Liebenberg from Vienna, Chamberlain had {{to first}} {{take the train}} to Berlin, and then board another train to Liebenberg. Chamberlain's meeting with the Kaiser was {{considered}} so important that when Chamberlain reached Berlin, he was met by the Chancellor Prince Bernhard von Bülow, who joined him on the trip to Liebenberg. During the train ride, Bülow and Chamberlain had a long discussion about The Foundations and then French literature. Upon reaching the gates of Liebenberg in the evening, Chamberlain and Bülow were met by Wilhelm and Eulenburg who were surrounded by servants carrying torches. [...] When he met Chamberlain for the first time, Wilhelm told him: [...] "I thank you for <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> for Germany!". The next day, Eulenburg wrote to a friend that the Emperor [...] "stood completely {{under the spell of}} this man , whom he understood better {{than any of the other}} guests because of his thorough study of The Foundations".|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have brought}} me back to myself," [...] he said. [...] "Only a few seconds ago I {{could think of nothing}} but <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> for me. I think I was almost as happy as a man could be, and now----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, no, he had {{precious}} {{little to say}} about that, for he must know I knew he and Jasniff were guilty. He wrote about you. It was a long letter--nearly eight pages--and he spoke about <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> to get him and me into trouble." ...|$|R
6000|$|ZOO. Something very disagreeable is {{happening}} to me. I feel hot all over. I have a horrible impulse to injure <b>you.</b> <b>What</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>done</b> to me? ...|$|R
2500|$|Simeona's {{version is}} {{influenced}} by her Christian (Protestant and Catholic) education and her philosophical studies about India, China and Edgar Cayce. Like Hawaiian tradition she emphasizes prayer, confession, repentance, and mutual restitution and forgiveness. Unlike Hawaiian tradition, she describes problems only as the effects of negative karma, saying that [...] "you have to experience by yourself <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> to others." [...] But {{that you are the}} creator of your life circumstances was common knowledge for the people of old as [...] "things we had brought with us from other lifetimes." [...] Any wrongdoing is memorized within oneself and mirrored in every entity and object which was present when the cause happened. As the Law of Cause and Effect predominates in all of life and lifetimes, the purpose of her version is mainly [...] "to release unhappy, negative experiences in past reincarnations, and to resolve and remove traumas from the 'memory banks'." [...] Karmic bondages hinder the evolution of mind, so that [...] "(karmic) cleansing is a requisite for the expansion of awareness". Using her 14-step-process would dissolve those bondages. She did not use mantras or conditioning exercises.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Give her up!' {{cried the}} old man. 'Come! Give {{her up to}} me! Tell me <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> with her. Quick! I have made no {{promises}} on that score. Tell me <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> with her.' ...|$|E

6000|$|It has no breath Nor any relaxing. Where, Where are <b>you,</b> <b>what</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>done?</b> <b>What</b> is this {{mouth of}} stone? How did you dare Take cover in death! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You don't know cotton; but {{you know}} me a little. Do I strike you as fit for anything?" [...] She made no reply to this, and he laughed. [...] "I assure you I felt small enough when I heard <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>done,</b> and thought--what I <b>had</b> <b>done.</b> It gave me a start; and I wrote my father that night that I would go in for it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{know very}} well," [...] Trent said, [...] "what I have come about. Of course you'll pretend you don't, so {{to save time}} I'll tell <b>you.</b> <b>What</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>done</b> with Monty?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Thank God!' said Lord Martindale, fervently. 'And, Simmonds, {{thank you}} for <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> to-night;' and he heartily shook the butler's hand.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{not think}} me ungrateful for <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> for me. Twice {{now you have}} saved my life, and, and--you {{understand}} me, Philip?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is nothing, Hal, in {{comparison}} to <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> for me. I shall reward you well if the missing box is recovered." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] she answered, [...] "perhaps {{he wanted}} me to know <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>done,</b> and, anyway, he had to put me on my guard. Still, though Mavy's quick, they're none of them very smart after all, and there was a point that didn't seem to strike him. He wasn't clear as to why Nevis would try to pick up Jake's trail through me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Pray, Babbalanja put {{all three}} {{questions}} together; and then, <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> often <b>done</b> before, pronounce yourself a lunatic." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mother, mother!" [...] {{she broke}} out, sobbing, after a moment's pause, [...] "oh, <b>what</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>done?</b> <b>What</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>done?</b> A cruel, cruel mother <b>you</b> <b>have</b> been to me. How can I ever forgive you?" ...|$|R
