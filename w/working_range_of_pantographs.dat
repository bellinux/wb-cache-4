40|$|International audienceThe yolk protein {{precursor}} vitellogenin (Vtg) in plasma {{has proved}} to be a simple and sensitive biomarker for assessing exposure of fish to environmental estrogens. Within international bodies such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) work is ongoing to develop screening and testing programmes for endocrine disrupting effects of new chemicals, and in the focus of this development are the fish test species common carp (Cyprinus carpio), fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas), zebrafish (Danio rerio) and Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes). In this study we have developed quantitative enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for Vtg in common carp/fathead minnow, zebrafish and Japanese medaka. The assays were developed using a combination of monoclonal and polyclonal fish Vtg antibodies in a sandwich format, using stabilized Vtg from the test species as a standard. The carp Vtg ELISA has a <b>working</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> 1 - 63 ng/mL, a minimal detection limit of 0. 6 ng/mL, and may also be used for quantification of Vtg in fathead minnow. In fathead minnow whole-body homogenate samples, the practical detection limit is 400 ng/mL due to the matrix effect. The zebrafish Vtg ELISA has a <b>working</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> 0. 5 - 63 ng/mL, a minimal detection limit of 0. 4 ng/mL, and a practical detection limit of 200 ng/mL in whole-body homogenate samples.

Similar commercially available localization systems achieve location accuracies (location error standard deviation) down to 15 cm under line-of-sight conditions in a <b>working</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> 20 m indoors (30 cm in a 100 m range outdoors). We review the fundamental limits <b>of</b> the <b>ranging</b> accuracy <b>of</b> any localization system satisfying the regulatory constraints for UWB emissions.
