In addition, factors enabling illicit <b>waste</b> <b>trafficking</b> were studied. Research questions were analysed from a situational crime prevention point of view by applying crime script analysis to 13 judiciary case studies of illicit cross-border <b>waste</b> <b>trafficking</b> obtained from the Netherlands, Italy and Finland. The {{findings suggest that the}} potential offender usually has advanced knowledge of the waste market and of the legislation and regulation. The case studies also suggest that the lack and misuse of appropriate licenses and falsified documentation, as well as taking advantage of illicit and licit networks in facilitating activities, are prevailing characteristics in the illicit cross-border trafficking of waste.

40|$|Transnational {{trafficking}} of e-waste {{has become}} a rising problem over time {{as the amount of}} waste produced in developed countries increases. Over time, the focus has moved from traditional industrial waste disposal to e-waste disposal. This acceptance of hazardous waste often leads to adverse health effects in the importing nation. As a case study, the history, consequences, current policies, and recommendations for hazardous <b>waste</b> <b>trafficking</b> are considered in the context of West Africa. Following the analysis, it is clear that despite strong policies on the importers part, there are confounding factors, such as economic expansion and corruption, which continue to drive the import of e-waste. Therefore, the recommendations are addressed to exporting nations which generally have well-developed economies, political systems, and technology thus increasing the likelihood of control over the situation...|$|E

40|$|This {{special issue}} of Global Crime is devoted to {{estimation}} of the proceeds of crime and mafia revenues in Italy. The articles in this special issue {{have been inspired by}} a study conducted by Transcrime for the Italian Ministry of Interior, which analysed the investments in the legal economy of the Italian mafias. 11. Transcrime, Progetto PON Sicurezza 2007 – 2013. View all notes The study estimated the revenues from nine criminal activities: sexual exploitation of women, illicit firearms trafficking, drug trafficking, counterfeiting, the illicit cigarette trade, illicit gambling, illicit waste disposal, loan sharking and extortion racketeering. For this special issue, each estimation was revised and updated. Five of the following articles (Mancuso on sexual exploitation, Giommoni on drugs, Calderoni on illicit cigarettes, Lisciandra on extortion racketeering and Scaglione on loan sharking) focus on criminal activities for which the literature provided some previous attempts of estimation. The article by Calderoni, Favarin, Garofalo and Sarno presents exploratory estimations for counterfeiting, illicit <b>waste</b> <b>trafficking,</b> illegal gaming machines and illicit firearm trade.

40|$|The {{twenty-first century}} has {{witnessed}} the exacerbation of ecological issues {{that began to}} manifest themselves in the mid-twentieth century. It has become increasingly clear that the current environmental crisis poses an unprecedented existential threat to civilization {{as well as to}} Homo sapiens itself. Whereas the physical and social sciences have been defining the now inevitable transition to a different (and more inhospitable) Earth, the humanities have yet to assert their role as a transformative force within the context of global environmental change. Turning abstract issues into narrative form, literary writing can increase awareness of environmental issues as well as have a deep emotive influence on its readership. To showcase this type of writing as well as the methodological frameworks that best highlights the social and ethical relevance of such texts alongside their literary value, I have selected the following twenty-first century Italian literary works: Roberto Saviano’s Gomorra, Kai Zen’s Delta blues,Wu Ming’s Previsioni del tempo, Simona Vinci’s Rovina, Giancarlo di Cataldo’s Fuoco!, Laura Pugno’s Sirene, and Alessandra Montrucchio’s E poi la sete, all published between 2006 and 2011. The main goal {{of this study is to}} demonstrate how these works offer an invaluable opportunity to communicate meaningfully and accessibly the discomforting truths of global environmental change, including ecomafia, <b>waste</b> <b>trafficking,</b> illegal building, arson, ozone depletion, global warming and the dysfunctional relationship between humanity and the biosphere...|$|E

40|$|The area of Naples and Campania region, in Italy, are {{experiencing}} the dramatic consequences of diffuse and illegal waste dumping, resulting in possible threats to human health. This {{area has been}} referred to as the “Land of Fires” because of the common practice of waste burning. International interest in the Campania “waste emergency” has triggered several epidemiological studies. This article is aimed at highlighting the body of evidence available concerning human and environmental contamination in the Campania region, and considers the possible lack of comparable knowledge about the situation in other areas suffering from high environmental pollution. We analyzed the results of studies addressing environmental pollution and population health in the Campania region, starting from the most recent reviews on this topic, and compared their findings with those concerning other regions. We reviewed 18 studies of epidemiological/cancer surveillance and human or animal biomonitoring. These studies show worrying results, which could be considered comparable to those available for other Italian areas impacted by heavy industrial activities. The release of environmental contaminants associated with waste incineration and waste disposal in landfills poses a risk to public health, as shown by a number of studies (although not conclusively). The current knowledge available for the Campania region is better than that available for other areas which are facing similar problems due to anthropic activities, including illegal <b>waste</b> <b>trafficking.</b> Thus, Naples and Campania could represent a valuable setting to develop general models for studies of environmental and human contamination...|$|E

All over the world and also in China, cities are trying to reduce their carbon footprint. In that context, the concept of so called “low carbon cities” is promoted. Currently, 79 cities in China are considering low carbon concepts. To build a low carbon city is not an easy task as there are various barriers to be removed, such as financial, traditional and institutional barriers. Building belong to the most traditional and slow-changing innovative areas in industry. Further solutions are different for hot and warm climates than for cold climates.

40|$|Large {{nuclear waste}} management, {{laboratory}} and electric power generating complexes are a daunting challenge for state, {{regional and local}} planners. A survey of 2101 residents who lived near 11 nuclear power plants and US Department of Energy (DOE) nuclear waste management sites and laboratories was conducted {{to determine how much}} nearby residents worried about accidents and chronic emissions at the nuclear sites, how much they trusted the sites' responsible parties, and actions that they wanted responsible parties to take to reduce public concern. Six hundred other people who lived elsewhere in the US were a comparison group. Nuclear site-related issues were a greater concern among the 2101 who lived near the sites than the comparison group. Yet many were more concerned about global warming, traffic congestion, and loss of open space than nuclear technologies. Monitoring the environment and people were the actions deemed most likely to reduce public concern. The results pose a challenge to owner-operators of nuclear facilities, government entities and especially to locally based environmental planners and managers to establish partnerships with each other and diverse communities {{that will allow them to}} manage some of these risks for decades and in some cases into perpetuity. worry, risk perception, nuclear power and <b>waste,</b> <b>traffic</b> congestion and open space, global warming,...|$|R

40|$|A generic {{conflict}} model is developed to analyze international toxic waste disposal issues, and then, to provide feasible strategic resolutions for this serious environmental dispute. With {{the rapid growth}} of the global economy, toxic <b>waste</b> <b>traffic</b> from the advanced to developing nations has become a serious side effect of this globalization. The illegal transboundary movement of toxic wastes not only aggravates the burden on the poorer nations, but also negatively impacts the worldwide environment. In this thesis, the ongoing toxic waste disputes are divided into two stages consisting of the dumping prevention and dispute resolution stages. The analyses based on the methodology of Graph Model for Conflict Resolution are used in both stages in order to grasp the structure and implications of the conflict from a strategic viewpoint. The in-depth modeling of the toxic waste dumping disputes, which consist of historical and generic situations, specifies the involved parties and their options. By synthesizing the economic, political and legal factors, the relative preferences for each party can be determined. The Graphical User Interface (GUI) of the Decision Support System (DSS) GMCR II simplifies the processing of calculations. The analytical research furnishes investigators or other interested parties with possible resolutions for the disputes arising from an international waste dumping event.

40|$|Due {{to ongoing}} urbanisation, accumulating <b>waste,</b> <b>traffic,</b> noise and damage {{to human health}} {{environmental}} pollution occur more frequently in Croatian cities. It {{is to be expected}} that it will occur even more often due to increased migration to towns, urbanisation, construction and industrialization around bigger town areas. This problem is stressed in bigger towns along the Adriatic coast. In the summer months, due to big number of tourists, environmental impacts multiply, while the existing infrastructure (waste management centres, waste water treatment plans, water supply, noise and traffic infrastructure) minimally meet the increasing needs. Apart from the inadequate infrastructure, the EU environmental directives have not been fully transposed to Croatian legislation. However {{in the last two years}} significant changes have been made especially with regard to waste and waste waters.
