5|$|Based on {{an anecdote}} about the Second World War by the Romani {{historian}} Jacques Sigot, {{the film was}} inspired by a Romani <b>who</b> <b>escaped</b> the Nazis with help from French villagers.

Other than a band of Romani people, the film has a character based on Yvette Lundy, a French teacher who was active in the French resistance and deported to a concentration camp for forging passports for Romani. Gatlif had intended to make a documentary but the lack of supporting documents led him to present it as a drama.|$|E

Although the medieval chronicler and churchman Gerald of Wales related that his friend was descended from Trojan heroes <b>who</b> <b>escaped</b> the Sack of Troy and ended up in Cornwall, that was a {{flattering}} invention on Gerald's part. Coutances' family was of the knightly class, and probably from Normandy originally.|$|E

5|$|In addition, {{the huge}} numbers of {{newcomers}} were driving Native Americans out of their traditional hunting, fishing and food-gathering areas. To protect their homes and livelihood, some Native Americans responded by attacking the miners. This provoked counter-attacks on native villages. The Native Americans, out-gunned, were often slaughtered. Those <b>who</b> <b>escaped</b> massacres were many times unable to survive without access to their food-gathering areas, and they starved to death. Novelist and poet Joaquin Miller vividly captured one such attack in his semi-autobiographical work, Life Amongst the Modocs.|$|E

5|$|The Australian Army did {{not have}} any {{doctrine}} for jungle warfare prior to 1942. Some lessons were passed on by officers <b>who</b> <b>escaped</b> from Malaya and Singapore, however, and these were incorporated into a training memorandum in May that year.

5|$|A German officer <b>who</b> <b>escaped</b> {{reported}} that the German prisoners were being humanely treated, but when Böhme {{became aware of the}} situation, he decided that retaliation was needed. He ordered III.Battalion of the 749th Infantry Regiment, part of the 717th Infantry Division, to burn down Gornji Milanovac and take hostages in order to expedite the recovery of the captured German troops. Due to a misunderstanding by the battalion commander, the unit did not burn down the town on 6October, and released the 170hostages it had arrested. Böhme was furious, and, on 15October, he sent the same battalion back to Gornji Milanovac to carry out his original orders. This was done on 16October.|$|E
