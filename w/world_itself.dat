5|$|The game world's {{design and}} the game's {{attention}} to detail were well received by critics. Game Informers Andrew Reiner said the game's setting had a taut and mesmerizing atmosphere, and {{was a place of}} wonder and inexplicable horror. Miller called it the right mix of creepy and cool, and appreciated the gradual damage reflected on Batman's suit as the story progressed, but said that pixelated CGI and lip synching issues diminished the presentation. Whitehead said that the impressive animation makes Batman feel alive, but wrote that the <b>world</b> <b>itself</b> was lifeless and lacking in interactive objects. He criticized segments in which character logic was sacrificed for video game tropes, citing repeated use of poison gas and electric floors as obstacles.|$|E
5|$|The game's setting {{received}} positive responses. Carter {{thought that}} the verticality nature of the game's map created obstacles for players when they were traveling between places. However, he praised the interesting lore and wildlife found within the world, {{as well as the}} game's long draw distance. Harmon had similar comments, praising the game's graphics and Kyrat's culture. Harmon {{thought that the}} hilly landscape of the game's world gave players a sense of exploration, and hence made traversal enjoyable. Wilson thought, however, that the game's setting was not as compelling as the tropical setting of Far Cry 3. Nevertheless, she praised the Shangri-la section, which she thought had changed the game's landscape drastically. Matt Bertz from Game Informer praised the game's setting, which he thought was vibrant, varied and rich. Ludwig Kietzmann from Joystiq praised the content found within the world, and thought that the <b>world</b> <b>itself</b> was absorbing and interesting.|$|E

5|$|From {{at least}} {{the time of the}} Pyramid Texts, kings hoped that after their deaths they could emulate Osiris's {{restoration}} to life and his rule over the realm of the dead. By the early Middle Kingdom (c. 2055–1650 BCE), non-royal Egyptians believed that they, too, could overcome death as Osiris had, by worshipping him and receiving the funerary rites that were partly based on his myth. Osiris thus became Egypt's most important afterlife deity. The myth also influenced the notion, which grew prominent in the New Kingdom, that only virtuous people could reach the afterlife. As the assembled deities judged Osiris and Horus to be in the right, undoing the injustice of Osiris's death, so a deceased soul had to be judged righteous in order for his or her death to be undone. As ruler of the land of the dead and as a god connected with maat, Osiris became the judge in this posthumous trial, offering life after death to those who followed his example. New Kingdom funerary texts such as the Amduat and the Book of Gates liken Ra himself to a deceased soul. In them, he travels through the Duat and unites with Osiris to be reborn at dawn. Thus, Osiris was not only believed to enable rebirth for the dead; he renewed the sun, the source of life and maat, and thus renewed the <b>world</b> <b>itself.</b>|$|E
5|$|One {{thousand}} {{years before the}} events in the game, on a floating continent hovering high above the surface of an unnamed planet, a technologically advanced civilization sought to harness the power of the four elemental crystals of light. They did not realize that they could not control such fundamental forces of nature. This power of light would have consumed the <b>world</b> <b>itself</b> had the light crystals not had their natural counterparts: the four dark elemental crystals. Disturbed by the sudden interruption of the careful balance between light and dark, four warriors were granted the power of the dark crystals to recapture the power of the light crystals. These so-called Dark Warriors succeeded in their quest, and restored harmony to the world. But their victory came too late to save the doomed civilization, whose culture was reduced to ruin, though their floating continent remained. On that continent, the circle of Gulgans, a race of blind soothsayers and fortune-tellers, predicted that these events will ultimately repeat.|$|E
5|$|The {{traditional}} {{design was}} a highly symbolic variety of sacred architecture. It was a greatly elaborated variant {{on the design of}} an Egyptian house, reflecting its role as the god's home. Moreover, the temple represented a piece of the divine realm on earth. The elevated, enclosed sanctuary was equated with the sacred hill where the world was created in Egyptian myth and with the burial chamber of a tomb, where the god's ba, or spirit, came to inhabit its cult image just as a human ba came to inhabit its mummy. This crucial place, the Egyptians believed, had to be insulated from the impure outside world. Therefore, as one moved toward the sanctuary the amount of outside light decreased, and restrictions on who could enter increased. Yet the temple could also represent the <b>world</b> <b>itself.</b> The processional way could therefore stand for the path of the sun traveling across the sky, and the sanctuary for the Duat where it was believed to set and to be reborn at night. The space outside the building was thus equated with the waters of chaos that lay outside the world, while the temple represented the order of the cosmos and the place where that order was continually renewed.|$|E

According to Carter, the challenging nature of the machines and varied methods with which to battle them brought {{a real sense of}} fun to the combat. Matt Buchholtz of Electronic Gaming Monthly likewise praised Burch as well as the game world, which he found to be mesmerising. Thought as the most powerful part of the game, the Focus feature gained approval for complementing the combat in a way that [...] "forces you to become a hunter". Writing for Game Informer, Jeff Marchiafava opined that, unlike with other open world video games, searching for audio logs and emails provided the plot with a [...] "remarkable sense of discovery". He was thankful that story-based missions dominated the overall experience, arguing that they worked to detail the game world and inspired variation in the gameplay.|$|E
500|$|Lightning Returns is set {{five hundred}} years after the ending of XIII-2, during the final {{thirteen}} days of the world's existence. Because of the unleashing of Chaos, the world of Gran Pulse has been consumed, leaving only a set of islands called Nova Chrysalia. The new Cocoon, called [...] "Bhunivelze" [...] after the key deity of the XIII universe, acts as the world's moon. The Chaos has halted human aging and no new children are born due to Etro's death, causing the human population to stagnate and shrink. Over the intervening centuries, two opposing religions have formed and dominate the life of Nova Chrysalia's people: the Order of Salvation, that worships Bhunivelze, and the Children of Etro, a rebel cult who worship the Goddess. The <b>world</b> <b>itself</b> is divided into four regions, each dominated by a specific mood and environment. The city of Luxerion is a capital of worship whose people are loyal to the Order. The pleasure capital of Yusnaan {{is a city of}} revelry where people live {{in a constant state of}} celebration. The Dead Dunes is a desert area dominated by ruins.

500|$|While some reviewers {{regard the}} novel as a thriller, others {{see it as an}} example of post-millennial science fiction with stories set in the [...] "technocultural future-present". Some reviewers note that the novel furthers the post-millennial trend in science fiction of {{illustrating}} society's inability to imagine a definitive future and the use of technologies once considered advanced or academic now commonplace within society and its vernacular. Gibson said that the only science fiction elements are [...] "he Footage and Cayce's special talents" [...] but that he [...] "never bought that conceit that science fiction is about the future". Dennis Danvers explained the use of science fiction as a narrative strategy: cience fiction, in effect, has become a narrative strategy, a way of approaching story, in which not only characters must be invented, but the world and its ways as well, without resorting to magic or the supernatural, where the fantasy folks work. A realist wrestling with the woes of the middle class can leave the world out of it by and large except for an occasional swipe at the shallowness of suburbia. A science fiction writer must invent the world where the story takes place, often from the ground up, a process usually called world-building. In other words, in a science fiction novel, the <b>world</b> <b>itself</b> is a distinctive and crucial character in the plot, without whom the story could not take place, whether it's the world of Dune or Neuromancer or 1984. The world is the story as much as the story is in the world. Part of Gibson's point ... is {{that we live in a}} time of such accelerated change and layered realities, that we're all in that boat, like it or not. A novel set in the [...] "real world" [...] now has to answer the question, [...] "Which one?" ...|$|E
500|$|Written in 1986, [...] "Part of Your World" [...] was {{the first}} song lyricist Howard Ashman and {{composer}} Alan Menken wrote for The Little Mermaid, although Menken {{had not yet been}} enlisted as Ashman's composer when the song was first conceived. Directly inspired by Broadway's most successful musicals, Ashman believed that The Little Mermaids story would benefit from at least one song that serves as its heroine's [...] "inner diary of thoughts". Having always intended for Ariel to perform a song in her grotto, directors and screenwriters Ron Clements and John Musker originally asked Ashman to write a song in which Ariel declares her love for Prince Eric by singing to a statue of the character, but Ashman suggested that a song depicting the character's fascination with the human world would be a stronger alternative. Ashman explained to the filmmakers that [...] "Part of Your World" [...] would be Ariel's [...] "I Want" [...] song, likening it to moments in stage musicals during which the heroine sings about her dreams so that the audience can begin to care about the character and her journey. Menken believes that Disney had not yet included explicit [...] "I Want" [...] songs in the studio's films prior to The Little Mermaid, making [...] "Part of Your World" [...] the first time one had been written intentionally for a Disney film. However, Disney princesses had technically been singing [...] "I Want" [...] songs since Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) and Cinderella (1950). Observing structural similarities between the song and [...] "Somewhere That's Green" [...] from their musical Little Shop of Horrors (1982), the songwriters nicknamed [...] "Part of Your World" [...] "Somewhere That's Dry" [...] because they believe it resembles an [...] "underwater version" [...] of the Little Shop of Horrors song. Additionally, Ashman had written a song entitled [...] "Disneyland" [...] with composer Marvin Hamlisch for their Broadway musical Smile (1986) in which a young girl, much like Ariel, sings about regularly watching Disney anthology series as a means of escaping her troubled childhood. Menken identified the musical motif he composed for the beginning of the ballad as his favorite part of the song. Ashman debuted [...] "Part of Your World" [...] for Clements and Musker at his apartment in Greenwich Village, Manhattan. Only the directors' second time meeting Ashman and first time meeting Menken, Menken provided the piano accompaniment while Ashman sang Ariel's melody himself, instead of their traditional method of Menken singing lead vocals. Moved by Ashman's demonstration, Musker recalled that the lyricist gazed up towards the ceiling as though it were the human <b>world</b> <b>itself</b> as he [...] "became Ariel before our eyes" [...] and [...] "poured out his heart in song", helping them visualize [...] "this far-off place of wonder that so entranced this little mermaid.” ...|$|E
