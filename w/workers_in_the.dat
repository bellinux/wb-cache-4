5|$|At 6:35pm, as many <b>workers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{city were}} {{finishing}} their shifts, the alarm was sounded {{to gather the}} troops of the 5th and 6th Regiments.

5|$|During his tenure, the <b>workers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Royal dockyards {{demanded an}} {{increase}} in pay due to {{an increase in}} living costs. St Vincent reacted by dismissing the ringleaders and every man who had taken {{an active role in the}} strike. He eventually agreed to a small temporary allowance for the purchase of bread while the price of bread remained high.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the events}} of September 11, 2001, with {{consideration}} of other events including the Oklahoma City Bombing, the Federal Highway Administration proposed the idea that major metropolitan areas create evacuation routes for civilians. These highlighted routes would allow paths for emergency crews and government agencies to enter the disaster area more quickly. By helping civilians out, and rescue <b>workers</b> <b>in,</b> <b>the</b> number of casualties will hopefully be decreased.|$|E
5|$|I {{advocate}} the industrial ballot alone when I address the <b>workers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> textile industries of the East where a great majority are foreigners without political representation.

5|$|Oral {{transmission}} {{is an unusual}} route of infection, but has been described. In 1991, farm <b>workers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> state of Paraíba, Brazil, were infected by eating contaminated food; transmission has also occurred via contaminated açaí palm fruit juice and garapa. A 2007 outbreak in 103 Venezuelan school children was attributed to contaminated guava juice.|$|E

5|$|The current {{reference}} range for acceptable blood lead concentrations in healthy persons without excessive exposure to environmental {{sources of lead}} is less than 5µg/dL for children.

5|$|The demands made by {{the colonial}} {{government}} on Congolese workers during the war provoked strikes and riots from the workforce. Whites in the colony were allowed to form trade unions {{for the first time}} during the war, and their demands for better pay and working conditions were often emulated by black workers. In October 1941, white <b>workers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> colony unsuccessfully attempted a general strike across the colony.|$|E

5|$|Women are {{negatively}} {{affected by the}} geographic bias within implementation of the current healthcare system in India. Of all health <b>workers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country, nearly two thirds are men. This especially affects rural areas {{where it has been}} found that out of all doctors, only 6 percent are women. This translates into approximately 0.5 female allopathic physicians per 10,000 individuals in rural areas.|$|E
5|$|A {{study on}} the {{carpenter}} ant Camponotus floridanus found a special surface hydrocarbon on queen-laid eggs. <b>Workers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> colony with the queen's eggs refrained from egg-laying, whereas other groups {{that did not have}} queen-laid eggs showed worker reproduction. Thus, the hydrocarbon could act as a signal to alert workers to halt reproduction. More generally, however, the authors concluded that the hydrocarbons were a fertility signal. It is still unknown as to how the decision to restrain reproduction occurs or what minimum threshold of fertility in the queen is needed to reduce worker reproduction.|$|E
5|$|Amenhotep I {{was the son}} of Ahmose I and Ahmose-Nefertari. His elder brothers, {{the crown}} prince Ahmose Sapair and Ahmose-ankh, died before him, thus {{clearing}} the way for his ascension to the throne. Amenhotep probably came to power while he was still young himself, and his mother, Ahmose-Nefertari, appears to have been regent for him for at least a short time. The evidence for this regency is that both he and his mother are credited with founding a settlement for <b>workers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Theban Necropolis at Deir el-Medina. Amenhotep took his sister Ahmose-Meritamon as his Great Royal Wife. Another wife's name, Sitkamose, is attested on a nineteenth dynasty stele.|$|E

5|$|Another {{concern is}} the fact that {{sugarcane}} fields are traditionally burned just before harvest to avoid harm to the workers, by removing the sharp leaves and killing snakes and other harmful animals, and also to fertilize the fields with ash. Mechanization will reduce pollution from burning fields and has higher productivity than people, and due to mechanization the number of temporary <b>workers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sugarcane plantations has already declined. By the 2008 harvest season, around 47% of the cane was collected with harvesting machines.|$|E
5|$|As a youth, Berkman was {{influenced}} by the growing radicalism that was spreading among <b>workers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Russian capital. A wave of political assassinations culminated in a bomb blast that killed Tsar Alexander II in 1881. While his parents worried—correctly, as it turned out—that the tsar's death might result in repression of the Jews and other minorities, Berkman became intrigued by the radical ideas of the day, including populism and nihilism. He became very upset when his favorite uncle, his mother's brother Mark Natanson, was sentenced to death for revolutionary activities.|$|E
5|$|As of the 2001 census, the {{industry}} of employment of residents of Herne Bay was 19% retail, 14% {{health and social}} work, 11% manufacturing, 10% construction, 9% real estate, 8% education, 8% transport and communications, 5% public administration, 5% hotels and restaurants, 4% finance, 1% agriculture and 5% other community, social or Personal Services. Compared to national figures, the town had a relatively high number of <b>workers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> construction and health/social care industries and a relatively low number in manufacturing and real estate. Many residents commute to work outside the town. As of the 2001 UK census, 14,711 of the town's residents were in employment, whereas there were only 8,104 jobs within the town.|$|E
