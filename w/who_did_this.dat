5|$|During {{the early}} years of sound films before dubbing and subtitling, one way to present a film to a foreign {{audience}} was to record the film with a translated screenplay with foreign-language cast. As this was a time consuming and expensive procedure, most filmmakers <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>this</b> tended to only make one alternative language feature. Producer Seymour Nebenzal felt that creating this alternative version would enhance international sales for The Testament of Dr. Mabuse. The French-language screenplay was adapted by René Sti. Lang was fluent in French and directed The Testament of Dr. Mabuse in both French and German. Actor Karl Meixner played Hofmeister in both versions of the film as he was bilingual. Rudolf Klein-Rogge also features as Mabuse in the French version with his lines being dubbed. The French version, titled Le Testament du Dr. Mabuse, was edited by Lothar Wolff in France while the film was still in production.|$|E

25|$|As Tsubasa is {{connected}} with xxxHolic, the characters' designs are also meant to be similar. Like xxxHolic, the artwork is sometimes influenced by Ukiyo-e art style {{which leads to the}} characters have longer limbs. Another similarity between both the series is the use of one-eyed characters or people who lost their sight, which is meant to express the feelings from them. The characters of Fai D. Flowright and Kurogane were created in order to have adult characters who would side with Syaoran, who was much younger and was still in development during the series' start. As a result of the manga being aimed at young male demographic, characters are designed to appeal of them such as Syaoran who appears as an action hero. In order to make fights more entertaining Clamp decided to include yells of fighting techniques {{for the first time in}} a manga of them. Although Kurogane was the only character <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>this</b> at first, the authors also planned to make Syaoran do this.|$|E

Nessarose has taken away the rights of the Munchkins {{in a desperate attempt to}} keep Boq at her side.

2500|$|The {{next section}} is {{commonly}} called the first strain, {{as it is}} the first prominent melody of the march. The first strain is typically 8 or 16 bars long with 4-measure phrases.

Typically this strain utilizes similar motifs in its phrases, and it sounds more rhythmically straightforward than the next section. After the first playing of the strain, it is repeated once, sometimes with added parts such as counter-melodies. Sometimes, the first strain is played again once after the second strains have been played, particularly if the first strain is in minor.

2500|$|From 1700 {{until the}} 1820s, {{numerous}} laws {{were put in}} place to [...] "penalize" [...] Catholics for practicing their faith, hence they were called the [...] "penal codes". [...] Catholics were denied the right to vote in Maryland through most of the 1700s. When anyone in Maryland was sworn into a position of public trust, they were also required to renounce the Catholic church while being sworn in. This was in order to prevent any Catholic person from secretly gaining a position of power. There were also periods where laws denied Catholics the right to purchase or inherit land in Maryland. Catholics were also not allowed to start their own schools. Wealthy Catholics would secretly send their children abroad to get religious education, but to discourage this, Maryland laws were passed fining parents <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>this.</b> [...] In order to discourage further importation of Irish indentured servants, who were largely Catholic, a prohibitive tax was imposed to try to prevent bringing any more of them to Maryland.
