She also dismissed claims that her candidacy was her family's revenge against her father's loss in 2004, saying that all she <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> serve should she be elected to the Senate. A day after the election, Poe was announced as among the winners with her having the highest number of votes. She was officially proclaimed a senator by the COMELEC board on May 2013, along with fellow Team PNoy candidates Chiz Escudero, Sonny Angara, Alan Peter Cayetano, and Loren Legarda, as well United Nationalist Alliance candidate Nancy Binay (who did not attend, opting instead to send her lawyer to represent her).|$|E

[...] Gilbert referred to his accent as [...] "spotty", while Goldman professed that Lincoln fit into character very well; [...] "For much of the pilot, he's {{on his own and}} exudes a lot of believable, shocked emotion, as Rick tries to process what he is seeing. Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter felt that Lincoln's performance was one of the episode's drawbacks. He wrote: [...] "One drawback in [...] is that Lincoln plays his emotion a little too close to his deputy's badge. We're told– by him– that all he <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> find his wife and kid. His belief that they still are alive is the emotional drive of the story, but there's not enough deep pain that seeps up to coat the dialogue Lincoln delivers." ...|$|E

Montgomery notes that it is not clear whether Usher even makes it home, or if the song was even referring to the wife character, and not [...] "someone special stashed in a nearby suite." [...] In resolving the video's review, Montgomery said, [...] "Distance may make the heart grow fonder, but there are limits to everything.

Sonia Saraiya of Nerve ranked Jasmine fifth in her article [...] "Ranked: Disney Princesses From Least To Most Feminist". Saraiya praised her personality, likening her boldness, curiosity, and skepticism of marriage to that of Belle while commending her for [...] "falling for a completely inadequate 'street rat' and whisking him out of poverty, instead of the other way around." [...] However, Saraiya labeled Jasmine's use of sexuality her [...] "only power", criticizing her for sending a negative message to young girls. When questioned about whether or not Jasmine is a positive role model because [...] "all she <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> get married", Larkin defended her character, explaining, [...] "That's not true. Jasmine says to a generation of little kids about marriage that the law is wrong.

Whether it's connected or not, that person that the writers created that I got to portray, I'm so proud of her. And I feel like she was ahead of her time." [...] Meanwhile, Jasmine's inability to recognize Aladdin despite his disguise has been met with controversy, comparing this characteristic to the relationship between Lois Lane and Clark Kent/Superman, and questioning the princess' intelligence.|$|E

Rambis said O'Neal gave him a [...] "blank, cold stare." [...] The rift between O'Neal and Bryant continued into the playoffs.

The reviewer claimed {{that it was the}} [...] "first designer-look Kollywood film with classy action cuts" [...] and a [...] "technically chic, racy, engrossing entertainer with a Hollywood look", going on to call it [...] "racy & rocking". The critic also heaped praise on the lead actor: [...] "Ajith looks sensational and clearly he is at home, playing dual roles of Billa and Velu. He is suave, dashing, and debonair and has terrific screen presence which makes the film work big time. You just cannot think of any other actor in Tamil donning the role made memorable by Rajinikanth". Behindwoods rated the film 3.5 out of 5 and wrote: [...] "...where Vishnu Vardhan scores is in his crystal clear vision. He doesn’t want to challenge the original nor change its content. All he <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> to repackage it stylishly for today’s trend with some present avant-garde styles in film making. The deliberate attempts by the director not to follow the super star’s style are palpable in every frame which has made Billa stand out tall and high". In regard of Ajith Kumar's presence, the reviewer said: [...] "Ajith as the ruthless David Billa is a revelation. Stylish, menacing and electrifying, he seems to have thoroughly enjoyed the challenge and has completely lived up to it. Rajinikanth can definitely be proud of his successor he has chosen for the tough job".|$|E
