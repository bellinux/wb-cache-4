40|$|AbstractConsider {{the motion}} of a curve in the plane under its mean curvature. It is a very {{interesting}} problem to investigate what happens when there are intersection points on the curve at which the mean curvature is singular. In this paper, we study this issue numerically by solving the Allen-Cahn equation and the nonlocal evolution equation with Kac potential. The Allen-Cahn equation is discretized by a monotone scheme, and the nonlocal evolution equation with Kac potential is discretized by the spectral method. Several curves <b>with</b> <b>intersection</b> <b>points</b> under motion by mean curvature are studied. From a simple analysis and our numerical results, we find that which direction to split of the curve at the intersection point depends on the angle of the curve at the point, i. e., it splits in horizontal direction when the angle α > π/ 2, in vertical direction when α < π/ 2 and in either direction when α = π/ 2...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{validate}} an improved finite volume approximation of Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes equations for simulation of wind flows in body-fitted grids generated by alge- braic extrusion from digital terrain elevation data, proposed in N. Mirkov et. al. J. Comput. Phys. 287, 18 - 45 (2015), [1]. The approach {{is based on}} second-order accurate finite volume method with collocated variable arrangement and pressure-velocity coupling trough SIMPLE algorithm. The main objective is the attenuation of spurious pressure field oscillations in regions with discontinuity in grid line slopes, as encountered in grids representing highly non-uniform terrains. Moreover, the approach relaxes the need for grid generation based on elliptic PDEs or grid smoothing by applying fixed point iterations (i. e. Gauss-Seidel) to initial grid node positions resulting from algebraic grid generators. Drawbacks of previous approaches which ignored treatment of finite volume grid cell cases <b>with</b> <b>intersection</b> <b>point</b> offset in non-orthogonality corrections are removed.

40|$|The {{fields of}} {{photogrammetry}} and computer vision routinely use line-surface intersections {{to determine the}} point where a line intersects with a surface. The object coordinates of the <b>intersection</b> <b>point</b> can be found using standard geometric and numeric algorithms, however expressing the spatial uncertainty at the <b>intersection</b> <b>point</b> may be challenging, especially when the surface morphology is complex. This paper describes an empirical method to characterize the unknown spatial uncertainty at the <b>intersection</b> <b>point</b> by propagating random errors in the stochastic model using repeated random sampling methods. These methods accommodate complex surface morphology and nonlinearities in the functional model, however the penalty is the resulting probability density function associated <b>with</b> the <b>intersection</b> <b>point</b> may be non-Gaussian in nature. A formal hypothesis test is presented to show that straightforward statistical inference tools are available whether the data is Gaussian or not. The hypothesis test determines whether the computed <b>intersection</b> <b>point</b> is consistent <b>with</b> an externally-derived known truth point. A numerical example demonstrates the approach in a photogrammetric setting with a single frame image and a gridded terrain elevation model.

25|$|Some authors {{add more}} {{constraints}} {{to the definition}} of a drawing, for instance that each pair of edges have at most one <b>intersection</b> <b>point</b> (a shared endpoint or crossing). For the crossing number as defined above, these constraints make no difference, because a crossing-minimal drawing cannot have edges <b>with</b> multiple <b>intersection</b> <b>points.</b> If two edges with a shared endpoint cross, the drawing can be changed locally at the crossing point, leaving the rest of the drawing unchanged, to produce a different drawing with one fewer crossing. And similarly, if two edges cross two or more times, the drawing can be changed locally at two crossing points to make a different drawing with two fewer crossings. However, these constraints are relevant for variant definitions of the crossing number that, for instance, count only the numbers of pairs of edges that cross rather than the number of crossings.|$|R

The EBPI data, combined <b>with</b> ray-surface <b>intersection</b> <b>points</b> and normals, is also used to detect transient edges at surface intersections.
