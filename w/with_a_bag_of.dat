Afterward, Lad no longer trusts strangers so easily {{and has become a}} true watchdog.|$|E
5|$|The {{instruments}} of the Passion were sometimes split between a shield and crest {{in the form}} of an achievement of arms (Neubecker, 222). The Hyghalmen Roll (c. 1447–1455) shows Christ holding an azure shield charged with Veronica's Veil proper. The heraldry continues with the 15th century jousting helmet, which is covered by the seamless robe as a form of mantling, and the Cross, scepter (of mockery) and flagellum (whip) as crest. The banner's long red schwenkel is a mark of eminence in German heraldry, but it was omitted when this image was copied into Randle Holme's Book (c. 1464–1480). The image on the opposing page (shown above) includes a shield quartered with the five Wounds of Christ, three jars of ointment, two rods, and the head of Judas Iscariot <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>bag</b> <b>of</b> money (Dennys, 97–98).|$|E

25|$|While {{reading the}} book Paul gave her, Connie finds his phone number inside. Connie calls Paul from Grand Central Station for his address, but he invites her over for coffee instead. Paul reads Connie a book in Braille amidst mild flirting. Connie, despite her {{feelings}} of attraction, leaves. Connie is unable to stop thinking about Paul, and decides to visit him <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>bag</b> <b>of</b> muffins. After Connie and Paul have a dance, she stops, saying she can't continue, and leaves. When she returns to retrieve her coat, Paul literally sweeps her off her feet and into his bed. While on the train ride home via the Metro-North Railroad, Connie, in tears, recalls their sexual encounter in flashbacks. She is thrilled by the sexual attention she is receiving from a younger man, but feels guilty at the same time. Connie uses her work for a charity event {{as an excuse to}} go into the city to visit Paul more frequently. Edward almost immediately senses something and sees subtle changes in her, which is confirmed by an inconsistency in an excuse she uses to visit the city one day. One morning he notices that Connie is fixing herself up to go into the city, with brand new shoes and lingerie draped over a chair, and he tells Connie he will wait for her so they can go into the city together. She urges him to go without her, that she won't be ready for quite a while, so he tries to get her to agree to meet him for lunch, but she says she has a salon appointment and won't be able to meet him. Later on, at the office, suspecting Connie is lying, Edward calls the salon she mentioned and it is confirmed that she doesn't have an appointment that day.|$|E
25|$|Sir Hugh Rose, on {{arriving}} at Poonch, sent Major Gall to the fort at Lohari. The fort and village of Lohari were situated in an extensive level plain. The fort itself was square and flanked by round towers at the corners. It had a ditch {{and a second}} line of works outside the ditch. A company of the 3rd Europeans crossed the open space between the village and fort without opposition and established themselves in a guard-house close to the ditch. The garrison of the fort paid no heed to the summons of surrender. Major Gall concluded that no option remained, after reconnaissance, but to open the third gate <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>bag</b> <b>of</b> gunpowder and carry the fort by storm. Twenty-five files of the 3rd Europeans, under Lieutenants Armstrong and Donne and Ensign Newport occupied the gateways as the storming party. Lieutenant Bonus, Bombay Engineers, {{under the cover of}} sharp fire from the 3rd Europeans, placed the powder-bag in front of the closed gate, and the firing party withdrew. The explosion occurred and the storming 3rd Europeans rushed in through the smoke and almost immediately met the enemy face to face. The stormers were assailed by a shower of stones and brickbats as well as by men who cut, stabbed and shot at them from the walls. Lieutenant Donne and Ensign Newport were severely wounded while fighting hand-to-hand, but beat off their assailants and retreated under bayonet protection. Lieutenant Rose now came opportunely to the front for a final charge and the 3rd Europeans, with some of the 25th Bombay Native Infantry, drove their foe before them and a bloody melee ensued. A last stand by the foe near the gateway was also crushed. The bugler private, Private Whirlpool, who made it through the gate first in the final charge, later received the Victoria Cross for his gallantry. The 3rd Bombay Europeans had a toll of 1 killed in action and 17 wounded.|$|E

Mahipati, in his work Pandurangastrotra, narrates how Vithoba helped female saints like Janabai in their daily chores, such as sweeping the house and pounding the rice.
