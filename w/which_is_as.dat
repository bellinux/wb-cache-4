5|$|In September 2014, {{a wave of}} {{ransomware}} Trojans surfaced {{that first}} targeted users in Australia, under the names CryptoWall and CryptoLocker (<b>which</b> <b>is,</b> <b>as</b> with CryptoLocker 2.0, unrelated to the original CryptoLocker). The Trojans spread via fraudulent e-mails claiming to be failed parcel delivery notices from Australia Post; to evade detection by automatic e-mail scanners that follow all links on a page to scan for malware, this variant was designed to require users to visit a web page and enter a CAPTCHA code before the payload is actually downloaded, preventing such automated processes {{from being able to}} scan the payload. Symantec determined that these new variants, which it identified as CryptoLocker.F, were again, unrelated to the original CryptoLocker due to differences in their operation. A notable victim of the Trojans was the Australian Broadcasting Corporation; live programming on its television news channel ABC News 24 was disrupted for half an hour and shifted to Melbourne studios due to a CryptoWall infection on computers at its Sydney studio.|$|E
5|$|The {{paintings}} depict isolated figures {{enclosed in}} spaces that are undefined, overwhelmingly claustrophobic, reductive and eerie. Coming early in Bacon's career, they are uneven in quality, but show a clear progression especially {{in how they}} utilise and present ideas he was still clearly developing and coming to terms with. Head I (actually begun {{in the winter of}} 1948) and Head II show formless pieces of flesh that broadly resemble human heads; they have half-open eyes and a pharynx, though it is positioned much higher than would be expected in a human. Heads III, IV and V show fully formed busts recognisable as men, and are characterised by a haunted atmosphere. These two broad ideas coalesce in Head VI, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>as</b> physiologically tortured as the first two paintings, and as spectral as the middle three. In Head VI the figure has developed and is now shown wearing vestments, the first indication in Bacon's work of the influence of Velázquez, while the focus has become the open mouth and the study of the human scream.|$|E

5|$|While {{scholars}} know {{of patriarchal}} and matrifocal ancient societies, very little {{can be said}} about a society of a species, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>as</b> remote as Australopithecus. On the basis of examples in today's chimpanzee and bonobo societies, Klaus Ebner introduced both patriarchal and matriarchal characters in the novel, Costello and Akshaya. Some of the female characters are very strong and self-conscious, such as Akshaya, who is so firm that even Costello s from her. While political power is controlled by the males, the social structure seems matrifocal and matrilineal, corresponding to the image of prehistoric societies exhibited by scholars.|$|E

Königsberger Fleck, a bovine tripe soup and yet another culinary specialty from former Königsberg, no longer belongs to the culinary culture of Kaliningrad.|$|E

25|$|In 1962 British Railways House, now City House, {{was added}} to the railway station. It was {{designed}} by architect John Poulson providing British Railways with administrative buildings. The building became dated and hard to let before refurbishment in 2009. The building was lambasted in 1967 by poet John Betjeman who said it blocked all the light out of City Square, and was a testament to money with no architectural merit. In 2010 the building was bought by property company Bruntwood <b>which</b> <b>is</b> (<b>as</b> of 2017) redeveloping it to provide serviced offices, with a new look to the façade.|$|E
25|$|There were no {{poor people}} {{in the land of}} Oz, because {{there was no such thing}} as money, and all {{property}} of every sort belonged to the Ruler. Each person was given freely by his neighbors whatever he required for his use, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>as</b> much as anyone may reasonably desire. Every one worked half the time and played half the time, and the people enjoyed the work as much as they did the play, because it is good to be occupied and to have something to do. There were no cruel overseers set to watch them, and no one to rebuke them or to find fault with them. So each one was proud to do all he could for his friends and neighbors, and was glad when they would accept the things he produced.|$|E
