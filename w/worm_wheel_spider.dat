30|$|The <b>wheel</b> <b>spider</b> can {{be found}} in the Namib Desert of Southern Africa and its size is 20 mm. The <b>wheel</b> <b>spider</b> reconfigures its body as a wheel by fixing its legs into {{constant}} positions after a short runup and goes down sand dunes when attacked by its nemesis. The <b>wheel</b> <b>spider</b> resumes walking with its legs straight as rotational speed reduces [8].|$|R

30|$|Figures 3, 4, 5 and 6 {{show that}} {{the angle of the}} {{cephalothorax}} and the x direction positions of the <b>wheel</b> <b>spider</b> increase over time. The <b>wheel</b> <b>spider</b> rotates about 11 times and moves about 0.7 m in 3 s. Here, it is found that the <b>wheel</b> <b>spider</b> rolls at a constant speed since displacement increase at a constant rate except when it starts rolling. Figures 7, 8 and 9 {{show that the}} z direction positions repeatedly increase and decrease without decreasing to below the height of the ground and {{at least one of the}} parts of the <b>wheel</b> <b>spider</b> constantly touch the ground. Furthermore, Figs. 10, 11 and 12 show that the <b>wheel</b> <b>spider</b> proceeds to the positive x direction with changing the height of each part.|$|R
40|$|The <b>worm</b> & <b>worm</b> <b>wheel</b> {{is used in}} {{gear box}} of Winch machine for lifting sand bucket. During working <b>worm</b> <b>wheel</b> fails due to load coming on the teeth. The failure is due to stress concentration. The crack appears at central {{thickness}} of tooth. Hence the tooth breaks at the central thickness. The failure of wheel occurs within period of about 20 days. So the company has to replace the <b>worm</b> <b>wheel</b> which is not cost effective.

40|$|Plastic <b>worm</b> <b>wheel</b> {{is widely}} used in the vehicle {{manufacturing}} field because it is favorable for weight lightening, vibration and noise reduction, as well as corrosion resistance. However, {{it is very difficult}} for general plastics to secure the mechanical properties that are required for vehicle gears. If the plastic resin is reinforced by glass fiber in the fabrication process of plastic <b>worm</b> <b>wheel,</b> it is possible to achieve the mechanical properties of metallic material levels. In this study, the mechanical characteristic analysis of the glass-reinforced plastic <b>worm</b> <b>wheel,</b> according to the contents of glass fiber, is performed by analytic and experimental methods. In the case of the glass fiber-reinforced resin, the orientation and contents of glass fibers can influence the mechanical properties. For the characteristic prediction of plastic <b>worm</b> <b>wheel,</b> computer-aided engineering (CAE) analysis processes such as structural and injection molding analysis were executed with the polyamide resin reinforcement glass fiber (25 wt %, 50 wt %). The injection mold for fabricating the prototype plastic <b>worm</b> <b>wheel</b> was designed and made to reflect the CAE analysis results. Finally, the durability of prototype plastic <b>worm</b> <b>wheel</b> fabricated by the injection molding process was evaluated by the experimental method and the characteristics according to the glass fiber contents...|$|R

30|$|From {{the above}} results, {{it is found}} that the <b>wheel</b> <b>spider</b> goes {{downhill}} at a constant speed with rolling. The <b>wheel</b> <b>spider</b> rolls only gravitationally since it is not provided with an initial velocity in the simulations. It is therefore effective in rolling locomotion by the multi-legged robot on the flat ground to utilize gravity skillfully.|$|R

40|$|Number of {{conventional}} methods {{are available for}} solving different types of optimization problems. But due to their complexity and convergence problems these methods {{are not able to}} give optimal solution. A gear transmission problem {{is one of the most}} complex optimization problems because of relationship between different variables. A Gear design require the designer to compromise many design variables; i. e. continuous, discrete & integer variables in order to determine best performance of gear set. Therefore researchers are now going to use Evolutionary Techniques. Genetic Algorithm (GA) is one of such technique. In this paper the attempt has been made to optimize <b>worm</b> and <b>worm</b> <b>wheel</b> with multiple objectives, which takes gear ratio (i), face width of <b>worm</b> & <b>worm</b> <b>wheel</b> (b) and pitch circle diameters of worm (dw) & <b>worm</b> <b>wheel</b> (dg) as design variables. The main objective function is to minimize volume of <b>worm</b> and <b>worm</b> <b>wheel</b> and remaining objectives are taken as constraints such as centre distance, deflection of worm and beam strength of worm gear...|$|R

30|$|This paper {{aimed to}} realize rolling {{locomotion}} by the wheel-spider-inspired hexapod robot {{on the flat}} ground. To realize rolling locomotion by the robot, the <b>wheel</b> <b>spider</b> rolling on the slope was modeled and analyzed through simulations. The model of the rolling <b>wheel</b> <b>spider</b> is developed by applying constraint force {{on the ground to}} the model of the <b>wheel</b> <b>spider</b> without the ground and considering velocity transformation due to collision. The mechanism of the robot and the rolling locomotion utilizing gravity which includes the raising of the center of gravity of the robot and the shifting of it forward on the overturned posture were proposed {{based on the results of}} motion analysis of the <b>wheel</b> <b>spider</b> and the robot model was developed. The controller which can generate the leg trajectories respectively in response to a robot state was designed. Finally, the rolling locomotion by the robot on the flat ground was simulated applying the proposed controller. As a result, it was found that the proposed controller is effective in realizing the proposed strategy for rolling locomotion. In conclusion, it was verified through numerical simulations that the wheel-spider-inspired hexapod robot can achieve the rolling locomotion utilizing gravity.|$|R

In this research, the lumped parameter method is used to model {{the dynamics of}} tilting table driven by <b>worm</b> and <b>worm</b> <b>wheel</b> in the tilting direction, where the varying stiffness of the transmission system at different tilting angles is considered. The impact testing experiments of tilting table system with tilting angles from 0 to 90 are also performed to verify the analytical model. The results from sensitivity analysis show that the three stiffnesses have a great effect on the variation of system natural frequency in the tilting direction, including the equivalent tangential meshing stiffness of <b>worm</b> and <b>worm</b> <b>wheel,</b> the torsional stiffness of <b>worm</b> <b>wheel</b> shaft, and the axial stiffness of worm supporting bearings. Moreover, the variations of system natural frequency with the three stiffnesses at different tilting angles are further investigated...|$|R
