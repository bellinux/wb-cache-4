40|$|Tasks {{involved}} in {{determination of the}} NPP equipment failure risks {{in the process of}} long-term operation are of extreme importance nowadays, specifically as the NPP units in the Russian Federation are nearing the end of their design lifetimes (25 – 30 years) and the life of newly built NPPs is increased to 60 years. The end of the effective NPP lifetimes and the increase in the operating life for newly built NPPs dictate the need for new approaches to be developed to ensure safe and reliable operation of critical thermomechanical components and pipelines. One of such components is the <b>weld</b> <b>assembly</b> between the hot header and the steam generator shell (WJ 111), in which formation and high-rate development of in-service defects is possible; the defects being systemic and affecting the operating safety of the entire power unit. Statistics is presented on failures in the <b>weld</b> <b>assembly</b> between the SG hot/cold headers and the DN- 1200 piping for WWER reactors. Classification is proposed for the occurrence of limiting failure states for the SG <b>weld</b> <b>assembly.</b> The risk has been calculated for a power unit in the event one of the limiting states occurs. The losses resulting from damage to the SG header—nozzle <b>weld</b> <b>assembly</b> in the WJ 111 area is substantial.

Materials and Methods: The mean tensile weld strength of a weld joint of four arch wires were compared pre-fluoride (Group 1) with post fluoride (Group 2) and the microstructural characteristics of weld joints were evaluated under an optical microscope. Results: The mean tensile weld strength for beta titanium was 445. 64 N/mm 2, blue elgiloy was 363. 26 N/mm 2, SS was 358. 30 N/mm 2 and timolium was 308. 62 N/mm 2. After immersion in fluoride the mean tensile strength for beta titanium was 427. 16 N/mm 2, blue elgiloy was 359. 86 N/mm 2, SS is 349. 44 N/mm 2 and timolium is 294. 86 N/mm 2. After immersion in fluoride, the beta titanium and SS had a smooth fusion at the center of <b>weld</b> <b>assembly</b> with characteristic nugget formation. The beta titanium <b>weld</b> <b>assembly</b> had greater tensile weld strength than other welded assemblies. Blue elgiloy ranked second, whereas SS and timolium were third and fourth respectively. Conclusion: The wires in descending order of their mean tensile weld strength, on evaluation of their weld joints were found to be: Beta titanium > blue elgiloy > SS > timolium. The reduction in tensile weld strength was statistically insignificant for all the archwires after exposure to 1. 23 % APF at 37 °C for 90 min...|$|E

40|$|One current {{methodology}} for spotweld modelling utilizes a tied contact {{to connect the}} weld elements to the components. In order for this contact to be robust and acceptably mesh independent, multiple solid elements are needed to represent a single weld. Several studies were conducted which concluded that a cluster of eight hex elements provides significantly improved performance over a single beam or hex element. However, ease of use {{is critical to the}} application of these spotwelds since thousands of welds can be present in a single full vehicle model. Therefore, a single output is generated for each <b>weld</b> <b>assembly</b> rather than on an element basis. The time step for these hex clusters is controlled by the smallest edge length so using multiple elements does not result in a time step penalty since the thickness of the weld is usually the smallest edge length. This paper will present the development of the eight hex cluster weld, followed by the validation process of these cluster spotwelds. Failure parameters for the resultant-based Mat 100 Damage-Failure model were derived by simulating coupon tests of single welds in shear and tension failure. These failure parameters were then used in a component test model with dozens of welds, several of which failed under the applied load. Finally, these parameters were applied to a full vehicle model using automatic sorting of the welds by the pre-processing software. At both the component and full vehicle level, good agreement was found between simulation and test results. The additional mass scaling and run time penalties of the cluster spotwelds were not significant. Furthermore, the effort needed to apply automatic methods to organize the welds is small enough to be practical in the production CAE environment...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a part of a larger project {{included}} in the European project, AFFIX. The reason for the project is to try to develop a new method to assemble an aircraft engine part so that the weight and manufacturing costs are reduced. The proposal is to weld sheet metal parts instead of using cast parts. A machine vision system is suggested to be used in order to detect the joints for the <b>weld</b> <b>assembly</b> operation of the sheet metal. The final system aims to locate a hidden curve on an object. The coordinates for the curve are calculated by the machine vision system and sent to a robot. The robot should create and follow a path by using the coordinates. The accuracy for locating the curve to perform an approved weld joint must be within +/- 0. 5 mm. This report investigates the accuracy of the camera calibration and the positioning of the robot. It also brushes the importance of good lightning when obtaining images for a vision system and the development for a robot program that receives these coordinates and transform them into robot movements are included. The camera calibration is done in a toolbox for MatLab and it extracts the intrinsic camera parameters such as the distance between the centre of the lens and the optical detector in the camera: f, lens distortion parameters and principle point. It also returns the location of the camera and orientation at each obtained image during the calibration, the extrinsic parameters. The intrinsic parameters are used when translating between image coordinates and camera coordinates and the extrinsic parameters are used when translating between camera coordinates and world coordinates. The results of this project are a transformation matrix that translates the robots position into the cameras position. It also contains a robot program that can receive a large number of coordinates, store them and create a path to move along for the weld application...|$|E

40|$|The mass {{production}} paradigm strives for uniformity, and for assembly operations to be identical {{for each individual}} product. To accommodate geometric variation between individual parts in such a process, tolerances are introduced into the design. However, for certain assembly operations this method can yield suboptimal quality. For instance, in <b>welded</b> <b>assemblies,</b> geometric variation in ingoing parts can significantly impair quality. When parts misalign in interfaces, excessive clamping force must be applied, resulting in additional residual stresses in the <b>welded</b> <b>assemblies.</b> This problem {{may not always be}} cost-effective to address simply by tightening tolerances. Therefore, under new paradigm of mass customization, the manufacturing approach can be adapted on an individual level. Since parts in <b>welded</b> <b>assemblies</b> are not easily disassembled and reused, interchangeability is not a relevant concern. This recognition means that each <b>welded</b> <b>assembly</b> can be adapted individually for the specific idiosyncrasies of ingoing parts. This paper focuses on two specific mass customization techniques; permutation genetic algorithms to assemble nominally identical parts, and virtual locator trimming. Based on these techniques, a six-step method is proposed, aimed at minimizing thing effects of geometric variation. The six steps are nominal reference point optimization, permutation GA configuration optimization, virtual locator trimming, clamping, welding simulation, and fatigue life evaluation. A case study is presented which focuses on one specific product; the turbine rear structure of a commercial turbofan engine. Using this simulation approach, the effects of using permutation genetic algorithms and virtual locator trimming to reduce variation are evaluated. The results show that both methods significantly reduce seam variation. However, virtual locator trimming is far more effective in the test case presented, since it virtually eliminates seam variation. This {{can be attributed to the}} orthogonality in fixturing. Seam variation is linked to weldability, which in turn has significant impact on estimated fatigue life. These results underscore the potential of virtual trimming and genetic algorithms in manufacturing, as a means both to reduce cost and increase functional quality...|$|R
