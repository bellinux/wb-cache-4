500|$|The New York Dolls and Morton {{produced}} little original material {{together and}} had to record cover songs and re-recorded some of the band's earlier demos to complete Too Much Too Soon; [...] "Babylon", [...] "Who Are the Mystery Girls?", [...] "It's Too Late" [...] and [...] "Human Being" [...] had been recorded by the band in March 1973 as demos for Mercury before the label signed them. They had also recorded demos of two songs written by guitarist Sylvain Sylvain, [...] "Teenage News" [...] and [...] "Too Much Too Soon", before working with Morton, but neither were considered for the album. Sylvain said he confronted Morton about this decision, recalling {{he had been in}} a rush: [...] "He was too quick with me and said that he'd been told only to listen to David Johansen and Johnny Thunders. He didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> who had told him that but obviously it was the managers. I just walked out, it was all driving me nuts." ...|$|E
2500|$|I usually say, [...] "There are {{a number}} of things that you don't want me to know about, that you don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me.</b> There are a lot of things about {{yourself}} that you don't want to discuss, therefore let's discuss those that you are willing to discuss." [...] She has blanket permission to withhold anything and everything. But she did come to discuss things. And therefore she starts discussing this, discussing that. And it's always [...] "Well, this is all right to talk about." [...] And before she's finished, she has mentioned everything. And each new item - [...] "Well, this really isn't so important that I have to withhold it. I can use the withholding permission for more important matters." [...] Simply a hypnotic technique. To make them respond to the idea of withholding, and to respond to the idea of communicating.|$|E
2500|$|... "Walt and Mearsheimer {{undermine}} {{our intelligence}} by assuming {{that we are}} simply being manipulated.... If the lobby is so influential over the media, how were Walt and Mearsheimer given such space in every major news outlet {{in the country to}} express their 'dangerous' views? You <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> that a force that can impel us to got [...] to war in Iraq can’t find a way to censor two academics? Not much of a lobby, now is it?" [...] Writing for the Columbia Journalism Review, Beckerman cites examples of op-eds critical of Israel from several major U.S. newspapers and concludes that an equally compelling argument could be made that the Israel lobby doesn't control the media. [...] Itamar Rabinovich, writing for the Brookings Institution, wrote, [...] "The {{truth of the matter is}} that, insofar as the lobby ever tries to intimidate and silence, the effort usually causes more damage than it redresses. In any event, the power of the lobby to do that is very modest." ...|$|E
6000|$|He felt a regal {{impulse to}} assist her. [...] "I have <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> see you," [...] he said. [...] "A {{few days ago}} you <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> something--you <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> of the people. What was it you had <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me?" ...|$|R
60|$|LORETTA. [Still petulantly.] You {{are always}} <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> something.|$|R
6000|$|... "My father only <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> {{that he is}} just {{starting}} for Bristowe's, and, as it is over twenty miles away, he may not return until tomorrow." ...|$|R
60|$|Miss Aldclyffe {{reflected}} a moment. 'Don't you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> who Edward is?' {{she said at}} last, {{in a tone of}} meaning.|$|E
6000|$|... "Poor Oggie {{is not at}} {{all well}} to-day," [...] said Mrs. Pett, when he was gone. [...] "He is very subject to these attacks. What do you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me,</b> Lord Wisbeach?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{this time}} you can. If you need my help I will stand by you, right or wrong. If you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> now I'll listen, and I'll advise you the best I can--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "`Nonsense,' {{cried the}} young 'un, in a cheerie tone, {{by way of}} [...] "don't say that." [...] `You're as tough as an old bo'sn. Come, that wasn't what you <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me,</b> I'm sure.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I <b>want</b> YOU <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> that. Here I am, with youth, health, strength, money, every {{blessing of}} life but one; and I am utterly miserable. I <b>want</b> some one <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> what I want.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If you <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> I was not {{fit to be}} head of the house, you needn't {{have done}} it before a roomful of fags. How do you think I can keep order in the house {{if you do that}} sort of thing?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well, Link, if {{you don't}} <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> you don't have to. Just the same, {{if you are}} trying to hatch out some plot against Dave, I warn you to be careful. He has stood about as much as he intends to stand." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Shadow, {{you are in}} {{some deep}} trouble, I know it," [...] came bluntly from Dave. [...] "Don't you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> about it? I'll do what I can for you. We've been chums ever since I came here and I hate to see you so downcast." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Great carrambos!' says I, when {{he stepped}} in, for I was in a bad temper, 'didn't I have catastrophes enough? I know what you want. You <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> that story again about Johnny Ammiger and the widow on the train. You've told it nine times already this month.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, but I don't like reading; I'd sooner {{have you}} tell them me--but only the {{fighting}} ones, you know. My sister Maggie is always <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> stories, but they're stupid things. Girls' stories always are. Can you tell a good many fighting stories?" ...|$|R
5000|$|She said {{of their}} relationship: It wasn't {{that he had}} other women. It's that he always <b>wanted</b> me <b>to</b> know about them, always <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> all the details about what they did together. Who does that unless they really <b>want</b> <b>to</b> make you mad? ...|$|R

6000|$|... "And yet," [...] says he, puzzled, [...] "I've watched, and you hinna haen {{a letter}} frae him. It defies the face o' clay {{to find out}} how he has managed it. Oh, the crittur!

6000|$|... "I had {{it out of}} ’im this morning," [...] {{continued}} Mr. Walters, eying her sternly; [...] "I {{waited for}} ’im as he {{come out of his}} ’ouse. He didn’t <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> at first, but when he found as ’ow he’d been late for the office if he didn’t, he thought better of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|Alton still lingered a moment. [...] "If {{you don't}} <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me,</b> I don't {{know how to}} make you, and I'm sorry, because I might fix the thing up," [...] he said gravely. [...] "Well, I'm going, but it hurts me to see {{anything}} worrying you, and know that somebody else has brought it upon you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{it seems}} to me," [...] {{continued}} Guy, [...] "that instead of <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> something, as you said, when you brought me {{out for a walk}} in this dreary waste of furze and sand at such a time of night, your real object was to pump me!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I want no thanks," [...] he answered, almost roughly. [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> {{know that}} I was {{justified}} in what I did. I <b>want</b> you <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> {{what you were}} doing there alone in the rooms of such a man, with a stolen key. And I <b>want</b> you <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> what you know about his death." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> {{something}}, Eugene. My poor dear fellow, you <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> {{say something}} to your old friend--to the friend who has always loved you, admired you, imitated you, founded himself upon you, been nothing without you, and who, God knows, would be here in your place if he could!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I knew it all along," [...] said Sarah Walker, {{turning down}} {{the corners of}} her mouth; [...] "there never was {{anything}} to see. I know why you got me to come here. You <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> if I'm a good girl you'll take me to sail some day. You want to say if I'm bad the sea will swallow me up. That's all you want, you horrid thing, you!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What do you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me,</b> Frances?" [...] In {{saying this}} he assumed his most angry tone and sternest countenance,--which, however, {{were not very}} angry or very stern, and had no effect in {{frightening}} his daughter. He did not, in truth, wish {{to say a word}} about the Post Office clerk before he made his escape, and would have been very glad to frighten her enough to make her silent had that been possible.|$|E
6000|$|... 'D---- the election, sir. I {{stand before}} the electors of Westminster {{as a man of}} business, not as a courtier,--as a man who understands {{commercial}} enterprise, not as one of the Prince's toadies. Some of you fellows in England don't realize the matter yet; but I can tell you that I think myself quite as great a man as any Prince.' Lord Alfred looked at him, with strong reminiscences of the old ducal home, and shuddered. 'I'll teach them a lesson before long. Didn't I teach 'em a lesson to-night,-- eh? They tell me that Lord De Griffin has sixty thousand a-year to spend. What's sixty thousand a year? Didn't I make him go on my business? And didn't I make 'em do as I chose? You <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> this and that, but I can tell you that I know more of men and women than some of you fellows do, who think you know a great deal.' ...|$|E
5000|$|In 2005, Smith {{turned down}} a {{lifetime}} achievement award from the Perrier Award organisers. He said that [...] "Comedians rather dislike the Perrier Awards and the public aren't interested. Basically, they <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> I was old and cool; well, I know that already, and anyway, my ego is bloated enough." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, ma'am. It was a {{very nice}} young lady indeed that brought me down this pink tunic, because it got stained last night, and she said her orders was to promise me a ticket if it came in time; but, oh my! ma'am, {{she looked as if she}} <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> not <b>to</b> come." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{what about}} yourself, Clary?" [...] Clarissa made no answer, {{and yet she}} was burning <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> her own story. She was most anxious <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> her own story, but only on the {{condition}} of reciprocal confidence. The very nature of her story required that the confidence should be reciprocal. [...] "You said that you <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> everything," [...] said Mary.|$|R
6000|$|He {{believes}} it all himself. I remember how on our wedding day he said [...] "Unless some solemn duty come upon {{me to go}} back to the bitter hours, asleep or awake, mad or sane [...] ." [...] There seems to be through it all some thread of continuity. That fearful Count was coming to London. If it should be, and he came to London, with its teeming millions [...] . There may be a solemn duty, and if it come we must not shrink from it. I shall be prepared. I shall get my typewriter this very hour and begin transcribing. Then we shall be ready for other eyes if required. And if it be wanted, then, perhaps, if I am ready, poor Jonathan may not be upset, for I can speak for him and never let him be troubled or worried with it at all. If ever Jonathan quite gets over the nervousness he may <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> of it all, and I can ask him questions and find out things, and see how I may comfort him.|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{are things}} that grow to beauty {{as you look at}} them--to {{exquisite}} beauty; and you are one of them," [...] he had said to her. [...] "And there are men," [...] she had answered, [...] "who grow to flattery as you listen to them--to impudent flattery; and you are one of them." [...] "I thought you plain the first day I saw you. That's not flattery." [...] "Yes, sir, it is; and you mean it for flattery. But after all, Harry, it comes only to this, that you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> that you have learned to love me." [...] He repeated all this to himself as he walked up and down Stratton, and declared to himself that she was very lovely. It had been given to him to ascertain this, and he was rather proud of himself. But he was a little diffident about his father. He thought that, perhaps, his father might see Florence as he himself had first seen her, and might not have discernment enough to ascertain his mistake, as he had done. But Florence was not going to Clavering at once, and {{he would be able to}} give beforehand his own account of her. He had not been home since his engagement had been a thing settled; but his position with regard to Florence had been declared by letter, and his mother had written to the young, lady asking her to come to Clavering.|$|E
50|$|Hakan Karsak, {{who plays}} {{one of the}} {{paramilitary}} murderers, was cast after the director had seen him on stage and was taken by his passion and talent while other adult performers including Fahriye Çelik, Alişan Önlü, Berivan Eminoğlu and Berivan Ayaz were also recruited locally. Suzan İlir was cast after {{trying to sell the}} director a bottle of water in one of the cemeteries in Diyarbakır. She at first did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> her name, but I finally convinced her that I was going to shoot a film and that I want her to help me.|$|E

6000|$|Cornelia said, [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you something, Charmian, and I <b>want</b> you <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> {{what you}} really think--whether I've done right, or not." ...|$|R
50|$|I didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> {{the tree}} or weed what it was. I <b>wanted</b> it <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> {{something}} and through me express its meaning in nature.|$|R
