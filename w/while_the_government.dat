5|$|After {{the end of}} the Russo-Japanese War the Imperial Russian Navy was in a {{state of}} confusion. Its leadership, tactics and ship designs had all been cast into disrepute by its {{repeated}} defeats by the Japanese at the Battle of Tsushima, Battle off Ulsan and the Battle of the Yellow Sea. The Navy took quite some time to absorb the design lessons from the war <b>while</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> reformed the Naval Ministry and forced many of its more conservative officers to retire. It conducted a design contest for a dreadnought in 1906, but the Duma refused to authorize it, preferring to spend the money on rebuilding the Army.|$|E

5|$|In mid-2006, an RAAF F-111 {{was chosen}} to scuttle the North Korean ship Pong Su which had been {{involved}} in one of Australia's largest drug hauls in recorded history. The ship had been sitting in Snails Bay, off Birchgrove, <b>while</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> considered its fate, and it was decided in March 2006 it would be scuttled by air attack. The Pong Su was sunk on 23 March 2006 by two GBU-10 Paveway II laser-guided bombs.|$|E
5|$|Jayakumar {{said that}} <b>while</b> <b>the</b> <b>Government</b> {{recognized}} that the subjective test enhanced the potential for abuse of executive discretion under the ISA, the best safeguard against such abuse of power was not to give the courts powers of judicial review because an unscrupulous government could still tamper with {{the composition of the}} courts to impair this judicial check. Instead, the crucial safeguard was for the electorate to make wise voting choices to put an honest and incorruptible government into power.|$|E
5|$|On November2, {{following}} an investigation, President Corazon Aquino ordered Sulpicio Lines temporarily closed <b>while</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> {{was asked to}} inspect the company's crews and ships.

5|$|Soon {{after the}} {{outbreak}} of war, the King and Government began to disagree. <b>While</b> <b>the</b> <b>Government</b> argued that the German invasion had violated Belgian neutrality and made Belgium one of the Allies, Leopold argued that Belgium was still a neutral country and had no obligations beyond defending its borders. Leopold opposed allowing British and French forces into Belgian territory to fight alongside Belgian troops, as a breach of its neutrality.|$|E
5|$|The Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement was not {{successful}} in ending the war, and fighting resumed in September 1999. The FAC's performance {{continued to be}} poor and both the major offensives the Government launched in 2000 ended in costly defeats. President Kabila's mismanagement was an important factor behind the FAC's poor performance, with soldiers frequently going unpaid and unfed <b>while</b> <b>the</b> <b>Government</b> purchased advanced weaponry {{which could not be}} operated or maintained. The defeats in 2000 are believed to have been the cause of President Kabila's assassination in January 2001. Following the assassination, Joseph Kabila assumed the presidency and was eventually successful in negotiating an end to the war in 2002-2003.|$|E
5|$|The {{failure to}} renew the Licensing Act led to {{confusion}} and {{both positive and negative}} outcomes; <b>while</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> no longer played a part in censoring publications, and the monopoly of the Company over printing was broken, there was uncertainty {{as to whether or not}} copyright was a binding legal concept without the legislation. Economic chaos also resulted; with the Company now unable to enforce any monopoly, provincial towns began establishing printing presses, producing cheaper books than the London booksellers. The absence of the censorship provisions also opened Britain up as a market for internationally printed books, which were similarly cheaper than those British printers could produce.|$|E

5|$|Before Krosa {{struck the}} Philippines, PAGASA issued a number 3 warning signal for {{portions}} of northern Luzon, where winds {{were expected to}} reach over 100km/h (60mph). The agency noted for the potential for flooding and landslides. High winds knocked down trees across Luzon, and left about 80% of Cagayan province without power, {{as well as some}} areas without internet or cellphone service. Portions of the Pan-Philippine Highway were blocked, and in Lal-Lo, Cagayan, a car crashed into a gasoline truck due to power outages. Agriculture damage was estimated at P273million (PHP, $6.3million USD), occurring just {{before the start of the}} harvest. Across the island, the typhoon damaged 32,745houses, including 3,837 that were destroyed, forcing 65,648people to evacuate to storm shelters. Overall, Krosa killed four people in the Philippines, and left P273million (PHP, $6.4million USD) in damage. After the storm, workers quickly restored power lines, <b>while</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> provided monetary assistance to storm-ravaged families, after Cagayan was declared a state of calamity. Members of the Philippine military and Department of Public Works and Highways worked to clean up following the storm.|$|E
5|$|Coinciding {{with the}} {{issuance}} of the first advisory on the tropical depression, {{the government of the}} Dominican Republic issued a tropical storm watch from Barahona to its border with Haiti, while a tropical storm watch was issued from Haiti's border with the Dominican Republic westward to Port-au-Prince. The United States' National Hurricane Center in Miami recommended interests in eastern Cuba to monitor the progress of the storm. When the depression was 205miles (330km) south-southeast of Santo Domingo, the Dominican Republic issued a tropical storm warning from Punta Palenque to its border with Haiti. While located 155miles (250km) from the coast of Hispaniola, the government of the Dominican Republic extended the tropical storm warning eastward to Isla Saona, <b>while</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> of Haiti upgraded its watch area to a tropical storm warning along the coast. The National Hurricane Center also recommended citizens in the Bahamas to monitor the progress of the storm. After the heavy rainfall began in the Dominican Republic, officials evacuated citizens of low-lying areas.|$|E
5|$|During the {{fighting}} in May 1940, the Pierlot government came into conflict with King Leopold III who had taken personal command of the Belgian Army. The first confrontation {{between the government and}} the King occurred on 10 May, when the King, against the wishes of the government, left for his military headquarters without addressing the Chamber of Representatives like his father, Albert I, had done in 1914. Contact between the King and the government became sporadic <b>while</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> feared that the King was acting beyond his constitutional powers. Like his father, Leopold was subject to Article 64 of the constitution which specified that no act of the King was valid unless counter-signed by a government minister, yet also given supreme power in military matters under Article 68. The two clauses appeared to contradict each other and gave all the king's acts in military-political matters an unclear constitutional footing.|$|E

5|$|Four storms struck Madagascar in {{the season}} between December and March, collectively killing 100people and causing $250million (1982 United States dollars) in damage. The storms caused {{widespread}} flooding and a state of disaster for four months, compounded by floods in January. About 180,000people were forced to evacuate, and there were increased levels of flood-related diseases. The storms closed down many roads and destroyed widespread crops, forcing the government to import 400,000 metric tons of rice. After the floods, workers repaired damaged roads and dykes <b>while</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> provided relief supplies. However, the ongoing floods strained the Madagascar's resources, and the government appealed for aid {{to the international community}} on February4. The United States Agency for International Development provided nearly $9million in aid, mostly for rice and rebuilding roads. Other countries donated about $7.5million in money or relief goods, such as building materials, food, clothing, and medicine.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Pauline lightly {{affected}} {{the state of}} Chiapas, but severely affected Oaxaca and Guerrero, two of the poorest regions of Mexico. The area most impacted was the region in and around Acapulco. Throughout the country, Hurricane Pauline resulted in $447.8million in damage (1997USD). A report issued by the United Nations Department of Humanitarian Affairs reported 137deaths three days after Hurricane Pauline. Four days {{after the passage of}} the hurricane, a Reuters news report stated there were 173dead with about 200missing, <b>while</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> of Mexico issued a statement reporting 149deaths.

Approximately 300,000 people were left homeless due to the storm.|$|E
5|$|In January 1992, Mugabe's wife died. In April 1995, Horizon {{magazine}} {{revealed that}} Mugabe had secretly been {{having an affair}} with his secretary Grace Marufu since 1987 and that she had borne him a son and a daughter. His secret revealed, Mugabe decided to hold a much-publicised wedding. 12,000 people were invited to the August 1996 ceremony, which took place in Kutama and was orchestrated by the head of the Roman Catholic Church in Zimbabwe, Patrick Chakaipa. The ceremony was controversial among the Catholic community because of the adulterous nature of Mugabe and Marufu's relationship. To house his family, Mugabe then built a new mansion at Borrowdale. In the 1995 parliamentary election—which saw a low turnout of 31.7%—ZANU-PF gained 147 out of 150 seats. Following the election, Mugabe expanded his cabinet from 29 to 42 ministers <b>while</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> adopted a 133% pay rise for MPs.|$|E

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the hurricane, a Royal Navy helicopter aboard the Argyll flew out ahead of the ship to start aerial damage assessments. Members of the Bermuda Regiment immediately began cleanup and recovery efforts, <b>while</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> provided tarps to affected homeowners. Sailors from the Argyll teamed up with Regiment soldiers upon the ship's arrival to continue relief work. Some 35of the vessel's crew members worked to clear debris from the runway at the airport, which reopened on October 19 after thorough evaluations. Including damage from Fay, about $2 million was spent on airport repairs, and the storms were later cited as evidence of the need for a newer terminal in a more protected location. All schools on the territory resumed classes by October 21.|$|E
5|$|The National Safety Council, {{a nonprofit}} safety {{advocacy}} group, estimates U.S. motor vehicle deaths in 2016 were 40,200, a 14 {{percent increase from}} its 2014 estimate. The National Safety Council measures roadside deaths differently than U.S. government agencies. The National Safety Council counts traffic and non-traffic deaths within one year of an accident <b>while</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> counts only traffic deaths occurring within 30 days of a crash. The National Safety Council's statistics show {{that the increase in}} 2016 was due only in part to increased miles driven (due to population growth, low gasoline prices, and a strengthening economy.) The National Safety Council suggests the increase in deaths not explained by increased vehicle miles is attributable to complacency about impaired driving and increased driver distraction.|$|E
