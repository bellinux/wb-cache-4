5|$|A {{claim was}} made on 17 January 2006, by now former {{developer}} Hartmut Birr on the ReactOS developers mailing list (ros-dev) that ReactOS contained code derived from disassembling Microsoft Windows. The code that Birr disputed involved the function BadStack in syscall.S. {{as well as other}} unspecified items. Comparing this function to disassembled binaries from <b>Windows</b> <b>XP,</b> Birr argued that the BadStack function was simply copy-pasted from <b>Windows</b> <b>XP,</b> given that they were identical. Alex Ionescu, the author of the code, asserted that while the <b>Windows</b> <b>XP</b> binary in question was indeed disassembled and studied, the code was not merely copy-pasted, but reimplemented; the reason why the functions were identical, Ionescu claimed, was because there was only one possible way to implement the function.|$|E
5|$|Microsoft Security Essentials is an {{antivirus}} software (AV) product that fights malicious software (malware), including computer viruses, spyware, Trojan horses and rootkits. It replaces Windows Live OneCare, a discontinued commercial subscription-based AV service, {{and the free}} Windows Defender, which until Windows 8 only protected users from adware and spyware. It automatically checks for and downloads the virus definitions it relies on from Microsoft Update, a web-based software service updated three times a day. Users may alternatively download the updates manually from the Microsoft Security Portal website. On 30 September 2011, a faulty definition update caused the product to incorrectly tag Google Chrome as malware. The issue was resolved within three hours. MSE originally ran on <b>Windows</b> <b>XP,</b> Windows Vista and Windows 7, although versions 4.5 and later do not run on <b>Windows</b> <b>XP</b> and Microsoft stopped producing definition updates for <b>Windows</b> <b>XP</b> on 14 July 2015.|$|E
5|$|On 21 February 2014, version 4.5 entered beta stage. On {{the same}} day, Microsoft {{announced}} that starting with this version, <b>Windows</b> <b>XP</b> {{would not be}} supported. Older versions would continue to receive virus definition updates until 14 July 2015.|$|E

5|$|In December 1999, it {{was found}} that Netscape Communicator used ROT13 as part of an {{insecure}} scheme to store email passwords. In 2001, Russian programmer Dimitry Sklyarov demonstrated that an eBook vendor, New Paradigm Research Group (NPRG), used ROT13 to encrypt their documents; it has been speculated that NPRG may have mistaken the ROT13 toy example—provided with the Adobe eBook software development kit—for a serious encryption scheme. <b>Windows</b> <b>XP</b> uses ROT13 on some of its registry keys. ROT13 is also used in the Unix fortune program to conceal potentially offensive dicta.|$|E

5|$|After {{the release}} of the Pocket PC version, in 2006 Chahi created a new Windows version {{targeted}} at <b>Windows</b> <b>XP.</b> Emmanuel Rivoire increased the resolution to 1280×800 pixels and Chahi created more detailed backgrounds. He found that his original choice to use polygons for the game characters enabled him to use the original character art at a higher resolution. The game still supports the original 320×200 resolution, as well as the original background art (as an option), and it features twice as many checkpoints as the original, which makes it somewhat easier, as well as newly remixed sounds.|$|E
5|$|Historically, people repored that Fragile Allegiance did {{not work}} {{properly}} on <b>Windows</b> <b>XP</b> and later Windows platforms, as the game was designed for MS-DOS and ported to Windows 95. The most common issues being reported are no audio, the game failing to start, and the game crashing when trying to rename anything, including saved games. As no patch was ever released for the game, people have had to use emulators such as VDMSound or DOSBox {{in order to get}} the game to function properly but it may still crash when trying to rename a saved game.|$|E

The former names of standard quality (SQ), high quality (HQ), and high definition (HD) have been replaced by numerical values representing the vertical resolution of the video. The default video stream is encoded in the VP9 format with stereo Opus audio; if VP9/WebM is not supported in the browser/device or the browser's user agent reports <b>Windows</b> <b>XP,</b> then H.264/MPEG-4 AVC video with stereo AAC audio is used instead.|$|E

5|$|Microsoft Security Essentials (MSE) is an {{antivirus}} software (AV) product that provides protection against {{different types of}} malicious software such as computer viruses, spyware, rootkits and Trojan horses.

5|$|On February 9, 2006, Nick Baron {{announced}} that a version of Halo 2 would be released on PC, exclusively for the Windows Vista operating system. While this was a deliberate decision by Microsoft to push sales of Vista, the game could be enabled to play on <b>Windows</b> <b>XP</b> through an unauthorized third-party patch. The game was ported by a small team at Microsoft Game Studios (codenamed Hired Gun) who worked closely with Bungie. As one of the launch titles of Games for Windows – Live, the game offered Live features not available in the Xbox version, such as guide support and achievements. The Windows port also added two exclusive multiplayer maps and a map editor.|$|E
