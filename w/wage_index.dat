The rates for industrial and agriculture uses are lower than those for domestic consumption and services. [...] Water for agriculture is supplied on a less reliable basis and is of poorer quality. Subsidies are provided for agriculture and for remote and elevated localities. The bulk water tariff for a specific use is the same throughout the country, irrespective of the difference in costs of supplying water to a specific locality. Mekorot bulk water tariffs were increased by 25% in January 2010, to a large extent to absorb increases in electricity prices. Energy accounts for an ever larger share of water supply costs because of the increasing share of seawater desalination.|$|E

40|$|This paper proposes an {{empirical}} {{analysis of the}} relationship between wage indexation, discretionary wage adjustment and inflation in Italy, by specifying and estimating (on quarterly time series for 1963 - 85) a short-term model for the price-wage nexus in the industrial sector of a small open economy. The influence of <b>wage</b> <b>indexing</b> is considered {{in the light of the}} concept of optimum degree of indexation (for which empirical estimates are provided), and the links between <b>indexing</b> and discretionary <b>wage</b> adjustment. The main conclusion is that, at least since 1973, institutional interventions on the degree of indexation seem to be only partially determined by variations in the optimum degree of indexation. As a result, <b>wage</b> <b>indexing</b> has increased price variance without this being justified by the fact that wages are closer on average to their equilibrium level. On the other hand, the estimates show no impact of <b>wage</b> <b>indexing</b> on the average inflation rate, as price expectations come into wage determination only to the extent of the complement to one of the degree of wage indexation...|$|R
