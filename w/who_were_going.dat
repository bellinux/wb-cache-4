Within two years, though, the Conservative Government of the time, which had {{members in the}} same or similar situation to Benn's (i.e., <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to receive title, or who had already applied for writs of summons), changed the law. The Peerage Act 1963, allowing lifetime disclaimer of peerages, became law shortly after 6pm on 31 July 1963. Benn was the first peer to renounce his title, doing so at 6.22pm that day. St Clair, fulfilling a promise he had made {{at the time of}} his election, then accepted the office of Steward of the Manor of Northstead, disqualifying himself from the House (outright resignation not being possible). Benn returned to the Commons after winning a by-election on 20 August 1963.|$|E

Nick Cook wasn't able {{to repeat the}} stalling of his two previous teammates and last only 10 minutes and 11 balls, although he did strike a clean boundary in his 5 runs. When he was caught behind off Merv Hughes, he left Russell stranded on 128 not out and England had been dismissed for 264 runs, leaving Australia a target of 78 with {{the best part of}} two sessions to get the runs.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{majority}} of scholars tend to favour a post-1590 date, {{and one of the}} primary arguments for this is that the title page of Q1 assigns the play to three different playing companies; Derby's Men, Pembroke's Men and Sussex's Men ("As it was Plaide by the Right Honourable the Earle of Darbie, Earle of Pembrooke, and Earle of Suſſex their Seruants"). This is highly unusual in copies of Elizabethan plays, which usually refer to one company only, if any. If the order of the listing is chronological, as Eugene M. Waith and Jacques Berthoud, for example, believe it is, it means that Sussex's Men were the last to perform the play, suggesting it had been on stage quite some time prior to 24 January 1594. Waith hypothesises that the play originally belonged to Derby's Men, but after the closure of the London theatres on 23 June 1592 due to an outbreak of plague, Derby's Men sold the play to Pembroke's Men, <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> on a regional tour to Bath and Ludlow. The tour was a financial failure, and the company returned to London on 28 September, financially ruined. At that point, they sold the play to Sussex's Men, who would go on to perform it on 24 January 1594 at The Rose. If one accepts this theory, it suggests a date of composition as some time in early to mid-1592. However, Jonathan Bate and Alan Hughes have argued that {{there is no evidence that}} the listing is chronological, and no precedent on other title pages for making that assumption. Additionally, a later edition of the play gives a different order of acting companies – Pembroke's Men, Derby's Men, Sussex' Men and Lord Chamberlain's Men, suggesting the order is random and cannot be used to help date the play.|$|E

The charges were later dropped. On November 5, 2009, fourteen weeks after Jackson's death, Evan Chandler was found dead following an apparent suicide.|$|E
500|$|During {{his initial}} audition, Johnston {{claimed that he}} was bullied and victimised {{from the age of}} six because of his singing.

[...] There were claims in the Daily Mail, a UK-based tabloid newspaper, that the programme's {{producers}} had deliberately overstated the extent of Johnston's bullying as a [...] "sob story", suggesting that sympathy rather than his singing got him many of the votes. However, in The Times, Johnston's success story was described as [...] "the stuff of fairytales", as he was successful despite having been raised in [...] "poverty". Johnston said he did not talk about being bullied because he was told to do so by producers, but [...] "because I believed it would help people <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> through what I had gone through be stronger". Johnston has subsequently visited schools and elsewhere to help other victims of bullying. He said [...] "I want to use my experience of bullies to help other kids".|$|E

40|$|Purpose: {{to conduct}} {{researches}} of influence of classes of the sportswomen <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> in for bodybuilding and fitness-bikini on manifestation of physical qualities in different {{phases of the}} ovarian-menstrual cycle. Material & Methods: researches were conducted in sports fitness-clubs of Kharkov "Feromon", "Gorod", “King” with the qualified sportswomen <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> in for bodybuilding and fitness-bikini within 3 months of the preparatory period in number of 14 people. We used as methods of the research: the analysis of references and testing of level of motive qualities in separate phases of OMC. Results: the theoretical analysis of features of the accounting of phases of OMC at sportswomen is submitted and the testing {{of the level of}} development of physical qualities in different phases of the specific biological cycle at the qualified sportswomen, <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> in for bodybuilding, is held. Conclusions: the received results demonstrate that physical efficiency of the qualified sportswomen, <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> in for bodybuilding, is not identical in phases of the ovarian-menstrual cycle. It is revealed that the best conditions for performance of considerable exercise stresses in post-ovulatory and post-menstrual phases of OMC, therefore it is expedient to plan them in the preparatory periods of the qualified sportswomen, <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> in for bodybuilding...|$|R

In addition, Michael Casey, Trevor Hopkins and Sue De Beauvoir were the series producers, with Bill Shepard serving as co-producer. Spotnitz wrote the first episodes. He was approached to write for the series because the producers needed somebody to reimagine the show as Armitage was committed to The Hobbit in New Zealand, by introducing two new leads. Spotnitz described the process; [...] "We had this great format, this great world of 'Strike Back' {{and then we had}} to imagine who were the new characters <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to drive the show in the second year."

500|$|The People v. Jackson {{trial began}} in Santa Maria, California, on January 31, 2005. During the trial, the judge allowed {{testimony}} about past allegations, including the 1993 case, to establish whether the defendant had a propensity to commit certain crimes. However, Jordan Chandler {{had left the}} country to avoid testifying. In a lecture at Harvard after the trial, Thomas Mesereau said, [...] "The prosecutors {{tried to get him}} to show up and he wouldn't.

It turned out he'd gone into court and got legal emancipation from his parents." [...] June Chandler testified that she had npt spoken to her son in 11 years. At one point in her testimony, she claimed that she could not remember being sued by Jackson (who had counter-sued for extortion) and at another point said that she had never heard of her own attorney. However, she said she never witnessed any molestation.|$|E
500|$|According to Carey, writing [...] "Can't Take That Away (Mariah's Theme)" [...] {{helped her}} get through rough {{emotional}} moments with her label's management, and even {{times when she}} felt overwhelmed by others. During {{the early stages of}} the album, Carey said she felt pressured to complete the Rainbow album as quickly as possible, due to the fact that it was the last album under her contract with Columbia. During troubled times for the singer, as well as her divorce from record executive Tommy Mottola, she claimed writing and singing the song helped her get through troubled times and hoped her listeners would get the same message out of it. Carey thought it would become an anthem for fans and listeners <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> through difficult times in their life and could relate to the song. Additionally, during the taping of the Mariah Carey Homecoming Special, Carey told audience members that after the Columbine High School massacre in 1999, she felt the song would help family members and friends of the victims during the tragedy, and hoped it would give them strength to get by the tragic event. For that reason, Carey included the song on the album, and campaigned for its radio release in mid-2000.|$|E

500|$|Instead, Stabæk started {{negotiating}} with IT Fornebu {{to take over}} a lot they owned. They needed a [...] lot which would have a market value of between NOK60 and 80 million, and Reinsfelt stated that the municipality was willing to help by [...] "maneuver in gray areas within the margins". The club was further pressured by NFF, <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to limit the exceptions allowed for Nadderud and other stadiums not meeting their criteria. On 29 October, FB and Stabæk signed an agreement whereby Stabæk received a free lot and NOK50 million, in exchange for FB taking over the commercial properties. The condition was that the municipality allowed a more dense use of the rest of FB's area. This would require a re-regulation of the area, and Reinsfelt estimated {{that it would not be}} possible for construction to start until 2006. In November, UEFA changed the rules for artificial turf to state that it had to be green. Until Stabæk's proposal was made, UEFA had not though that anyone would build a pitch with a non-green turf, and representatives stated that it was because of Stabæk the rule change was made. The plans were nearly terminated in October 2006, after discussion about the planned Fornebu Line—a people mover which would connect Fornebu to Lysaker—stopped the regulation plan. However, in November the final permissions were granted by Bærum Municipality. On 22 December, Stabæk announced that the financing was secured.|$|E
500|$|On November 10, 1960 {{the second}} International Conference of the Communist and Workers' Parties was convened.

[...] On November 12 a private meeting was held between members of the Albanian delegation including Hoxha and members of the Soviet leadership, which [...] "showed that no compromise between them was possible." [...] During the meeting Hoxha noted that [...] " [...] has asked to whom the Albanian army will be loyal. This question he addressed to our generals at the airport, in the presence of one of your generals. Our officers replied that our army would be loyal to Marxism-Leninism, to the Party of Labour and socialism." [...] Khrushchev replied, [...] "If our ambassador said such a thing, he was foolish." [...] Hoxha in turn replied, [...] "He was no fool. He committed this 'foolishness' following the Bucharest Meeting." [...] The subject eventually came to the Vlora naval base, which {{was the subject of a}} Soviet–Albanian dispute to become acute months later. Khrushchev threatened Hoxha, saying, [...] "We can dismantle the base if you like." [...] Hoxha replied, [...] "If you dismantle the base you will be making a big mistake. We have fought empty-bellied and bare-footed, but have never kowtowed to anybody." [...] As the meeting's atmosphere became increasingly hostile Khrushchev declared, [...] "You flare up in anger. You spat on me; no one can talk to you." [...] The meeting ended after Kapo declared, [...] "I do not agree that the talks should be conducted like this." ...|$|E
