40|$|In this paper, {{the authors}} show the {{usefulness}} of theoretical tools of chemical engineering in natural polymer processing, namely on the example of <b>white</b> <b>hide</b> deliming. <b>White</b> <b>hide</b> is a consequent product in the processes in which raw hide is transformed into leather. It is produced in the de-hairing stage which follows the soaking operation. For next operation, tanning, {{it is necessary to}} remove calcium hydroxide from <b>white</b> <b>hide.</b> Mathematical descriptions of both non-chemical and chemical deliming are presented, concentration fields of the reacting chemicals described and the importance of the acido-basic boundary inside the <b>white</b> <b>hide</b> shown. Experimental determination of the effective diffusion coefficient is also included. The presented mathematical models can serve as a very good basis for rationalization of the deliming process, save considerable amounts of energies, deliming chemicals and technological water, and make the whole process more environmentally friendly...|$|R

50|$|Latigo {{is usually}} infused with oils and waxes. Techniques such as hot-stuffing, wet-stuffing, and fat {{liquoring}} {{have been devised}} {{to increase the amount}} of oil and wax the hide can hold. Due to oil/wax infusion, and its partial chrome tanning, the leather is moderately flexible, less rigid than full vegetable tans, but more rigid than full chrome tans. Because of its weight and tanning process, latigo is among the most expensive cattle <b>hide</b> <b>leathers.</b>|$|R

With the original houses and farms featured in the previous game, this game also has many more extensive farms for gems, silk, whale blubber, lamp oil, medicinal herbs, hops, wine, indigo, coal, <b>hides,</b> <b>leather</b> and salt, increasing gameplay difficulty.

40|$|Traditional <b>hide</b> and <b>leather</b> {{handicrafts}} of Djennè (Mali) {{are in the}} abandon. Markets are shrinking just as {{the number}} of artisans is diminishing. The few artisans, who are struggling to make it their daily vocation, limit themselves to activities of repairing and creating small leather products that are sold for a minimal amount. The income from these activities is insufficient to even cover the daily expenses of their families, all the more since they use up their savings. Therefore, this text titled “traditional <b>hide</b> and <b>leather</b> handicrafts of the city of Djennè “aims, on the one hand, at establishing a relation between this handicraft and the administrative, environmental, historical and socio-professional contexts and on the other hand, analyses its technical complexities.
