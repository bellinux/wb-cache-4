5|$|Gaga grew up {{listening}} to artists such as the Beatles, Stevie Wonder, Queen, Bruce Springsteen, Pink Floyd, Mariah Carey, The Grateful Dead, Led Zeppelin, Whitney Houston, Elton John, Blondie, and Garbage, who have all influenced her music. Gaga's musical inspiration varies from dance-pop singers like Madonna and Michael Jackson to glam rock artists like David Bowie and Freddie Mercury, as well as the theatrics of the pop artist Andy Warhol and her own performance roots in musical theater. The singer has been compared to Madonna, <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>said</b> that she sees herself reflected in Gaga. Gaga says that she wants to revolutionize pop music like Madonna. Gaga has also cited heavy metal bands as an influence, including Iron Maiden and Black Sabbath. She credits Beyoncé as a key inspiration to pursue a musical career.|$|E
25|$|Polygyny was legalized and {{documented}} in unrecognised Chechen Republic of Ichkeria but Russian authorities had annulled these polygynous marriages after they regained control over territory of Ichkeria. Later Ramzan Kadyrov, President of the Chechen Republic, has been quoted on radio {{as saying that}} the depopulation of Chechnya by war justifies legalizing polygamy. Kadyrov has been supported by Nafigallah Ashirov, the Chairman of the Council of Grand Muftis of Russia, <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>said</b> that polygamy is already widespread among Muslim communities of the country.|$|E
25|$|Obama had not {{specified}} what his approach would be, {{although it was}} considered likely that he would appoint a high-level Middle East envoy, in part to free his Secretary of State so that other matters can also be addressed. Hamas expressed a willingness to talk to Obama, <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>said</b> that he will reciprocate only if it renounces terrorism, recognizes Israel's right to exist, and agrees to abide by past agreements. The Hamas leader in Gaza, Ismail Haniyeh, has said the Hamas government would accept a Palestinian state that followed the Green Line and would offer Israel a long-term truce if Israel recognises the Palestinians' national rights.|$|E

25|$|There is a {{game that}} is {{isomorphic}} to tic-tac-toe, but on the surface appears completely different. It is called Pick15 or Number Scrabble. Two players in turn say a number between one and nine. A particular number may not be repeated. The game is won by the player <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>said</b> three numbers whose sum is 15. If all the numbers are used and no one gets three numbers that add up to 15 then the game is a draw. Plotting these numbers on a 3×3 magic square shows that the game exactly corresponds with tic-tac-toe, since three numbers will be arranged {{in a straight line}} if and only if they total 15.|$|E
25|$|Many {{have said}} that a vacuum does not exist, others that it does exist {{in spite of the}} repugnance of nature and with {{difficulty}}; I know of no one <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>said</b> that it exists without difficulty and without a resistance from nature. I argued thus: If there can be found a manifest cause from which the resistance can be derived which is felt if we try to make a vacuum, it seems to me foolish to try to attribute to vacuum those operations which follow evidently from some other cause; and so by making some very easy calculations, I found that the cause assigned by me (that is, the weight of the atmosphere) ought by itself alone to offer a greater resistance than it does when we try to produce a vacuum.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Ron Hauge, <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>said</b> {{he thought of the}} episode while {{attempting}} to create a story involving general illegal activity. Originally, Hauge had a different title for the episode, [...] "Mutual of Moemaha", parodying the name of the Mutual of Omaha insurance company. The episode was going to add to the development of Moe's character in the show, though the staff did not think they were able to develop him more until later episodes.|$|E

By the time she applied for Harvard Law, biographer Bond wrote, her {{confidence}} had grown; [...] "This time around, {{there was no doubt}} in her mind that she had earned her place". Her faculty mentor at Harvard Law was Charles Ogletree, <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>said</b> that she had answered the question that had plagued her throughout Princeton by the time she arrived at Harvard Law, of whether she would remain the product of her parents or keep the identity she had acquired at Princeton, believing that she concluded she could be [...] "both brilliant and black." ...|$|E

He had also previously been involved in music publishing, clothes design, theatre production, managing the Condor club in London, and was also known as {{being a part of}} a group of people who called themselves [...] "The King's Road Rats". He had not had any previous experience of merchandising or managing a large business.|$|E
500|$|The {{play was}} {{described}} by The Times as a [...] "strange free-wheeling piece about a man <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>said</b> goodbye {{to the world and}} simply shut himself up in his room." [...] The reviewer added [...] "It is a strange unpredictable world Mr. Jones conjures up and Mr. Saville, with the aid of an excellent cast (Miss Maureen Pryor and Miss Ursula Howells were particularly good) and some haunting songs by Mr. Bob Dylan, brought it powerfully to life." [...] The Observer, in 2005, reports that the play [...] "got stinking reviews" [...] according to folk singer Martin Carthy, adding that the Western Daily Mail reviewer was [...] "baffled" [...] and The Listener had [...] "noted that Dylan had 'sat around playing and singing attractively, if a little incomprehensibly'".|$|E

500|$|Although {{the reality}} {{television}} of The Live Life Show is the aspect most commentators pick up on, The Year of the Sex Olympics {{is also a}} wider satire on sensationalist television and the media in general. Mark Gatiss has noted that the Artsex and Foodshow programmes that also appear in the play [...] "ingeniously depicted the future of lowest common denominator TV". This view is echoed by the writer and critic Kim Newman, <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>said</b> that [...] "as an extreme exercise in revolutionary self-criticism {{on the part of}} television professionals, who also lampoon their own world of chattering commentators and ratings-chasing sensationalism, the play [...] is a trenchant contribution to a series of debates that is still raging" [...] and has concluded that [...] "Nigel Kneale might be quite justified in shouting, 'I was right! I was right!'" ...|$|E
500|$|Matt Groening first {{conceived}} Marge and {{the rest}} of the Simpson family in 1986 in the lobby of producer James L. Brooks' office. Groening had been called to pitch a series of animated shorts for The Tracey Ullman Show, and had intended to present an adaptation of his Life in Hell comic strip. When he realized that animating Life in Hell would require him to rescind publication rights, Groening decided to go in another direction and hurriedly sketched out his version of a dysfunctional family, naming the characters after members of his own family. Marge was named after Groening's mother Margaret [...] "Marge" [...] Groening, <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>said</b> she bears little similarity to the character, stating, [...] "It's really weird to have people think you're a cartoon." [...] Marge's beehive hairstyle was inspired by the titular Bride in Bride of Frankenstein and the style that Margaret Groening wore during the 1960s, although her hair was never blue.|$|E

2500|$|Rustin did {{not engage}} in any gay rights {{activism}} until the 1980s.

2500|$|Robert Wyatt, <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>said</b> that Atzmon {{combines}} [...] "great artistry with a {{sense of}} the intrinsically non-racialist philosophy that's implicit in jazz," [...] worked with Atzmon and others on his album Comicopera (2007). Wyatt collaborated with Atzmon and Ros Stephens, as well as lyricist Alfreda Benge, on the album For the Ghosts Within (2010), released on Domino Records.|$|E

2500|$|In 2008, {{approximately}} {{one quarter of}} African-American churches followed a liberation theology. The theology was thrust into the national spotlight after a controversy arose related to preaching by Rev. Jeremiah Wright, former pastor to then-Senator Barack Obama at Trinity United Church of Christ, Chicago. [...] Wright had built Trinity into a successful megachurch following the theology developed by Cone, <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>said</b> that he would [...] "point to [...] first" [...] {{as an example of}} a church's embodying his message.|$|E

[...] Because they work closely with the body fluids of infected patients, healthcare workers have been especially vulnerable to catching the disease; in August 2014, the WHO reported that ten percent of the dead have been healthcare workers.|$|E
2500|$|In 1994, Hunt {{performed}} a one-woman play in Scotland at the Edinburgh Festival playing Baby Palatine, a 60-year-old woman who becomes the wardrobe mistress {{to a female}} pop group. The play is based on Hunt's novel Joy (1990). Hunt was directed in the play by her daughter Karis Jagger, <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>said</b> {{that it was her}} mother's idea. Jagger says that the pair [...] "spent six weeks rehearsing in France. Because the weather was so good we marked out the shape of the stage with my teddy bears and rehearsed in the garden." ...|$|E
