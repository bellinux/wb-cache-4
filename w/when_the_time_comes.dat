5|$|The troublemaker Bricriu once incites three heroes, Cú Chulainn, Conall Cernach and Lóegaire Búadach, {{to compete}} for the champion's portion at his feast. In every test that is set Cú Chulainn comes out top, but neither Conall nor Lóegaire will accept the result. Cú Roí mac Dáire of Munster settles it by visiting each {{in the guise of a}} hideous churl and {{challenging}} them to behead him, then allow him to return and behead them in return. Conall and Lóegaire both behead Cú Roí, who picks up his head and leaves, but <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>comes</b> for him to return they flee. Only Cú Chulainn is brave and honourable enough to submit himself to Cú Roí's axe; Cú Roí spares him and he is declared champion. This beheading challenge appears in later literature, most notably in the Middle English poem Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. Other examples include the 13th century French Life of Caradoc and the English romances The Turke and Gowin, and Sir Gawain and the Carle of Carlisle.|$|E

Peter, {{suffering}} from a headache, takes an aspirin and drinks out of what he believes to be an ordinary bottle of milk from the fridge. In reality, the milk contains a serum developed by Walter {{in order to help}} him recover his full mental function. However, the serum was incorrectly prepared, which causes Peter to begin convulsing. Over the phone, Walter directs Olivia to inject Peter with the correct compounds in order to save his life. Walter realizes that the serum would have killed him if he had consumed it, and that this was another step in the Observer's plot. Later that evening, September meets with another Observer, and identifies the fact that Walter was able to let Peter go, despite believing that he may not survive, and that <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>comes,</b> they can expect Walter to do it again.|$|E

500|$|Hill and Beatty {{left the}} film, which Paramount began {{developing}} as a lower-budget project with Richard Benjamin directing. Cash and Epps continued {{to rewrite the}} script, but Universal was unsatisfied. The film rights eventually reverted to Tribune Media Services in 1985. However, Beatty decided to option the Dick Tracy rights himself, along with the Cash/Epps script. When Jeffrey Katzenberg moved from Paramount to the Walt Disney Studios, Dick Tracy resurfaced with Beatty as director, producer and leading man. He considered hiring Martin Scorsese to direct the film, but changed his mind. [...] "It {{never occurred to me}} to direct the movie," [...] Beatty admitted, [...] "but finally, like most of the movies that I direct, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>comes</b> to do it, I just do it because it's easier than going through what I'd have to go through to get somebody else to do it." ...|$|E

[...] "It's a tough, tough movie about a tough, tough subject", Mark said in an interview, [...] "There was a palpable tension throughout on the set. It was just like the onscreen story of three guys who fight with each other, but <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>comes</b> to do the work, they come together {{to get the job}} done." [...] Renner remembered, [...] "I got food bugs. Then I got food poisoning: lost 15lbs in three days". In addition to the burden of the heat, the bomb suit he had to wear all day weighed [...] In a scene in which his character carries a dead Iraqi boy, Renner fell down some stairs and twisted his ankle, which delayed filming because he could not walk. At that point, [...] "people wanted to quit. All the departments were struggling to get their job done, none of them were communicating". A week later, filming resumed.|$|E

[...] Castiel is able to send Dean and Sam back in time, but warns them {{that he has to}} retrieve them in 24 hours or they'll be stuck in the past forever and tells Bobby to pray for him <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>comes.</b> [...] While waiting, Rachel approaches him about his plans and attacks him.

[...] Castiel manages to teleport to Bobby's and draws a sigil to hide himself from the other angels before passing out. [...] He wakes in time to retrieve the Winchesters, but his weakened state prevents this so he is forced to draw power from Bobby's soul. [...] While Dean killed the Phoenix, Castiel brought them back before they could gather the ashes so it all appears for nothing and he lacks the power to send them back. [...] Luckily, Samuel Colt collected the ashes and sent a package with them to be delivered to Bobby's after the boys return.|$|E
500|$|McNeile's {{war stories}} were seen by reviewers as honest portrayals of the war, with British and American reviewers in the {{mainstream}} press praising his realism and avoidance of sentimentality in dealing with his subject matter. Reviewing Men, Women, and Guns for The Times Literary Supplement, Francis Henry Gribble wrote that [...] "Sapper {{has been successful in}} previous volumes of war stories... <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>comes</b> for picking out the writers whose war fiction has permanent value, his claim {{to be included in the}} list will call for serious examination." [...] The reviewer of Sergeant Michael Cassidy, R.E. for The Atlanta Constitution reminded its readers that McNeile [...] "has been called the foremost literary genius of the British army." [...] Jaillant observes that once McNeile moved from war stories to thrillers, with the concurrent re-positioning of advertising and marketing by Hodder & Stoughton, the reviewers also treated him differently, and presented him as [...] "a writer of thrillers, without any pretension to literary seriousness". When reviewing Bulldog Drummond Strikes Back for The New York Times, the critic observed that [...] "if you like a good knock-down-and-drag-out yarn with excitement and violence on nearly every page, you can't go wrong on Bulldog Drummond"; for the novel Bulldog Drummond at Bay, the reviewer considered that [...] "as a piece of fictional melodrama, the book is first rate". In the British market, The Times Literary Supplement also characterised him as a mass-market thriller writer, which contrasted with its consideration of his earlier works.|$|E
