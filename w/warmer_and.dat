5|$|After 9600 BCE, the area's {{environment}} grew <b>warmer</b> <b>and</b> drier, {{a change}} that brought to central Mesa Verde pine forests and the animals that thrive in them. Paleo-Indians began inhabiting the mesa in increasing numbers , though {{it is unclear whether}} they were seasonal occupants or year-round residents. Development of the atlatl during this period made it easier for them to hunt smaller game, a crucial advance {{at a time when most}} of the region's big game had disappeared from the landscape.|$|E
5|$|Most nuthatches {{breed in}} the {{temperate}} or montane woodlands of the Northern Hemisphere, although two species {{have adapted to}} rocky habitats in the <b>warmer</b> <b>and</b> drier regions of Eurasia. However, the greatest diversity is in Southern Asia, and similarities between the species have {{made it difficult to}} identify distinct species. All members of this genus nest in holes or crevices. Most species are non-migratory and live in their habitat year-round, although the North American red-breasted nuthatch migrates to warmer regions during the winter. A few nuthatch species have restricted ranges and face threats from deforestation.|$|E
5|$|Other threats include illegal {{collection}} for pet trade, which concerns mainly the southern crested newt, {{and the northern}} crested newt in its eastern range. The possibility of hybridisation, especially in the crested newts, means that native species can be genetically polluted through the introduction of close species, {{as it is the}} case with the Italian crested newt introduced in the range of the northern crested newt. <b>Warmer</b> <b>and</b> wetter winters due to global warming may increase newt mortality by disturbing their hibernation and forcing them to expend more energy. Finally, the genus is potentially susceptible to the highly pathogenic fungus Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans, introduced to Europe from Asia.|$|E

5|$|The {{range of}} the Eurasian {{treecreeper}} overlaps with that of several other treecreepers, which can present local identification problems. In Europe, the Eurasian treecreeper shares much of its range with the short-toed treecreeper. Compared to that species, it is whiter below, <b>warmer</b> <b>and</b> more spotted above, and has a whiter supercilium and slightly shorter bill. Visual identification, even in the hand, may be impossible for poorly marked birds. A singing treecreeper is usually identifiable, since short-toed treecreeper has a distinctive series of evenly spaced notes sounding {{quite different from the}} song of Eurasian treecreeper; however, both species have been known to sing the other's song.|$|E
30|$|Cushion {{plants are}} {{important}} facilitator species in alpine ecosystems. Across a seven-year period, the cushion plant S. acaulis showed differing short- and medium-term responses to <b>warming</b> <b>and</b> nutrient addition, with the strongest responses often {{coming in the}} combined <b>warming</b> <b>and</b> nutrient treatment. For example, over a three-year period, both nutrient addition <b>and</b> the combined <b>warming</b> <b>and</b> nutrient manipulation significantly increased stem elongation, with the combined treatment having a stronger effect. For leaf elongation, only the combined <b>warming</b> <b>and</b> nutrient manipulation had a significant positive effect. Temperature, nutrient, and the combined treatment initially increased cover of S. acaulis, but by the seventh year of manipulations, the combined <b>warming</b> <b>and</b> nutrient treatment {{had a very strong}} and significant negative effect on cover.|$|R
40|$|Background: Both climate <b>warming</b> <b>and</b> {{atmospheric}} nitrogen (N) deposition are predicted to affect soil N cycling in terrestrial biomes {{over the next}} century. However, {{the interactive effects of}} <b>warming</b> <b>and</b> N deposition on soil N mineralization in temperate grasslands are poorly understood. Methodology/Principal Findings: A field manipulation experiment was conducted {{to examine the effects of}} <b>warming</b> <b>and</b> N addition on soil N cycling in a temperate grassland of northeastern China from 2007 to 2009. Soil samples were incubated at a constant temperature and moisture, from samples collected in the field. The results showed that both <b>warming</b> <b>and</b> N addition significantly stimulated soil net N mineralization rate and net nitrification rate. Combined <b>warming</b> <b>and</b> N addition caused an interactive effect on N mineralization, which could be explained by the relative shift of soil microbial community structure because of fungal biomass increase and strong plant uptake of added N due to warming. Irrespective of strong intra- and inter-annual variations in soil N mineralization, the responses of N mineralization to <b>warming</b> <b>and</b> N addition did not change during the three growing seasons, suggesting independence of <b>warming</b> <b>and</b> N responses of N mineralization from precipitation variations in the temperate grassland. Conclusions/Significance: Interactions between climate <b>warming</b> <b>and</b> N deposition on soil N cycling were significant. These findings will improve our understanding on the response of soil N cycling to the simultaneous climate change drivers i...|$|R

5|$|On July 6, a {{tropical}} wave moved {{off the coast}} of Africa. Moving westward, the disturbance gradually organized until July10, at which point convection became more concentrated, and it is estimated Tropical Depression Five formed in the central tropical Atlantic that evening. Late on July11, it strengthened and was named Tropical Storm Emily. Initially forecast to strengthen rapidly and move west-northwest through the Greater Antilles, Emily instead moved almost due west toward the Windward Islands, remaining a moderate tropical storm. The storm languished while moving quickly west, and struggled with maintaining its form. Contrary to the normal occurrence that hurricanes leave a cold wake behind, Hurricane Dennis had made portions of the Caribbean Sea <b>warmer,</b> <b>and</b> therefore more favorable for tropical cyclone development. Late on July13, Emily strengthened rapidly and reached hurricane strength while passing Tobago and entering the eastern Caribbean. On July14, Emily made landfall in northern Grenada with 90mph (145km/h) winds.|$|E
5|$|P. sindianus, the {{mountain}} chiffchaff, {{is found in}} the Caucasus (P. s. lorenzii) and Himalayas (P. s. sindianus), and is an altitudinal migrant, moving to lower levels in winter. The nominate subspecies is similar to P. c. tristis, but with a finer darker bill, browner upperparts and buff flanks; its song is almost identical to P. collybita, but the call is a weak psew. P. s. lorenzii is <b>warmer</b> <b>and</b> darker brown than the nominate race; it is sympatric with common chiffchaff in a small area in the Western Caucasus, but interbreeding occurs rarely, if ever. The mountain chiffchaff differs from tristis in vocalisations, external morphology, and mtDNA sequences. Its two subspecies appear to be distinct vocally, and also show some difference in mtDNA sequences; they are maintained at subspecies rank pending further research.|$|E
5|$|The fixed {{reed and}} fairly uniform {{diameter}} of the clarinet give the instrument an acoustical behavior approximating that of a cylindrical stopped pipe. Recorders use a tapered internal bore to overblow at the octave when the thumb/register hole is pinched open, while the clarinet, with its cylindrical bore, overblows at the 12th. Adjusting {{the angle of the}} bore taper controls the frequencies of the overblown notes (harmonics). Changing the mouthpiece's tip opening and the length of the reed changes aspects of the harmonic timbre or voice of the clarinet because this changes the speed of reed vibrations. Generally, the goal of the clarinetist when producing a sound is to make as much of the reed vibrate as possible, making the sound fuller, <b>warmer,</b> <b>and</b> potentially louder.|$|E

5|$|The {{hurricane}} {{crossed into}} the area of forecast responsibility of the Central Pacific Hurricane Center on July24, and upon doing so, its eye disappeared from satellite imagery. Daniel was forecast to track through the Hawaiian Islands as a tropical storm as water temperatures near the islands were <b>warmer,</b> <b>and</b> wind shear {{was expected to be}} minimal. However, it decelerated as the ridge to its north weakened, and due to the combination of cool waters and increasing easterly shear, Daniel weakened to a tropical storm on July25. Later that day, no active convection remained near the exposed circulation center, and early on July26 it weakened to tropical depression status. Thunderstorm activity failed to redevelop, and Daniel degenerated into a remnant low pressure area by 0000UTC on July27. The remnant low continued west-northwestward, dissipating just south-east of the Big Island of Hawaii on July28.|$|E
5|$|A Book of Mediterranean Food was {{successful}} enough for Lehmann to commission David {{to write a}} sequel, to show the dishes of rural France. This was French Country Cooking, which David finished writing in October 1950. Minton was employed to illustrate the work, and David gave him detailed instructions about the type of drawings; she was more pleased with them than those for her first work. Despite their difficult relationship, David dedicated the book to her mother. Before the book was published, David left England to live {{for a short time}} in France. She was motivated by a desire to gain a wider knowledge of life in the French countryside, and to put distance between her and her husband. She left London in March 1951 for Ménerbes, Provence. She spent three months in Provence; although the weather was initially cold and wet, it soon turned <b>warmer</b> <b>and</b> she enjoyed herself so much that she considered buying a house there. In June 1951 she left Ménerbes and travelled to the island of Capri to visit Norman Douglas. When she left in late August, she toured briefly around the Italian Riviera researching for an article for Go, before returning to London.|$|E
5|$|Tectonic {{movement}} by the Indian Plate {{caused it to}} pass over a geologic hotspot—the Réunion hotspot—now occupied by the volcanic island of Réunion. This resulted in a massive flood basalt event that laid down the Deccan Traps some 60–68Ma, {{at the end of}} the Cretaceous period. This may have contributed to the global Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, which caused India to experience significantly reduced insolation. Elevated atmospheric levels of sulphur gases formed aerosols such as sulphur dioxide and sulphuric acid, similar to those found in the atmosphere of Venus; these precipitated as acid rain. Elevated carbon dioxide emissions also contributed to the greenhouse effect, causing warmer weather that lasted long after the atmospheric shroud of dust and aerosols had cleared. Further climatic changes 20 million years ago, long after India had crashed into the Laurasian landmass, were severe enough to cause the extinction of many endemic Indian forms. The formation of the Himalayas resulted in blockage of frigid Central Asian air, preventing it from reaching India; this made its climate significantly <b>warmer</b> <b>and</b> more tropical in character than it would otherwise have been.|$|E
40|$|Despite {{the growing}} {{scientific}} consensus {{about the risks}} of global <b>warming</b> <b>and</b> climate change, the mass media frequently portray the subject as one of great scientific controversy and debate. And yet previous studies of the mass public’s subjective assessments of the risks of global <b>warming</b> <b>and</b> climate change have not sufficiently examined public informedness, public confidence in climate scientists, and the role of personal efficacy in affecting global warming outcomes. By examining the results of a survey on an original and representative sample of Americans, we find that these three forces—informedness, confidence in scientists, and personal efficacy—are related in interesting and unexpected ways, and exert significant influence on risk assessments of global <b>warming</b> <b>and</b> climate change. In particular, more informed respondents both feel less personally responsible for global <b>warming,</b> <b>and</b> also show less concern for global warming. We also find that confidence in scientists has unexpected effects: respondents with high confidence in scientists feel less responsible for global <b>warming,</b> <b>and</b> also show less concern for global warming. These results have substantial implications for the interaction between scientists and the public in general, and for the public discussion of global <b>warming</b> <b>and</b> climate change in particular...|$|R

Preserved in the Clarno Nut Beds are fossils of tropical and subtropical nuts, fruits, roots, branches, and seeds. The Clarno Formation also contains bones, palm leaves longer than , avocado trees, and other subtropical plants from 50million years ago, when the climate was <b>warmer</b> <b>and</b> wetter than it is in the 21stcentury. Large mammals that inhabited this region between 50 and 35million years ago included browsers such as brontotheres and amynodonts, scavengers like the hyaenodonts, as well as Patriofelis and other predators. Eroded remnants of the Clarno stratovolcanoes, once the size of Mount Hood, are still visible near the monument, for example Black Butte, White Butte, and other buttes near Mitchell.|$|E
5|$|Mammalian coats are colored for {{a variety}} of reasons, the major {{selective}} pressures including camouflage, sexual selection, communication and physiological processes such as temperature regulation. Camouflage is a powerful influence in a large number of mammals, as it helps to conceal individuals from predators or prey. Aposematism, warning off possible predators, is the most likely explanation of the black-and-white pelage of many mammals which are able to defend themselves, such as in the foul-smelling skunk and the powerful and aggressive honey badger. In arctic and subarctic mammals such as the arctic fox (Alopex lagopus), collared lemming (Dicrostonyx groenlandicus), stoat (Mustela erminea), and snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus), seasonal color change between brown in summer and white in winter is driven largely by camouflage. Differences in female and male coat color may indicate nutrition and hormone levels, important in mate selection. Some arboreal mammals, notably primates and marsupials, have shades of violet, green, or blue skin on parts of their bodies, indicating some distinct advantage in their largely arboreal habitat due to convergent evolution. The green coloration of sloths, however, {{is the result of a}} symbiotic relationship with algae. Coat color is sometimes sexually dimorphic, as in many primate species. Coat color may influence the ability to retain heat, depending on how much light is reflected. Mammals with a darker colored coat can absorb more heat from solar radiation, and stay <b>warmer,</b> <b>and</b> some smaller mammals, such as voles, have darker fur in the winter. The white, pigmentless fur of arctic mammals, such as the polar bear, may reflect more solar radiation directly onto the skin.|$|E
