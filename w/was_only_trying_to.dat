5|$|In May 2007, Baroš {{was accused}} of making a racist gesture towards his Cameroonian {{opponent}} Stéphane Mbia during Lyon's match against Rennes on 18 April. After having been fouled by Mbia several times, Baroš held his nose in front of Mbia and waved his hand as if to waft away an unpleasant smell. In the ensuing controversy, Baroš insisted that his gesture {{was not intended to}} be racist in any way, and he <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> tell Mbia to get out of his face and leave him alone. Baroš and Mbia were brought before an official disciplinary hearing of the Ligue de Football Professionnel (LFP), which ruled that Baroš was innocent of racist behaviour, but he was nevertheless suspended for the remaining three games of the season for unsportsmanlike conduct. The end of the season saw Lyon win the league title, but nonetheless manager Houllier left the club.|$|E
25|$|Also in March 2006, PNC Bank was sued by Paul Bariteau, an {{investor}} in the Military Channel. Bariteau claimed PNC let {{the chairman of}} the Military Channel make unauthorized withdrawals of millions of dollars from the channel's account for personal use. The counter-claim was that Bariteau <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> recoup losses from a bad investment.|$|E
25|$|When in November 1944 an {{economic}} commission {{headed by a}} State Attorney investigated the editorial staff of Panzerfaust, Heinz Heydrich thought he had been discovered and shot himself {{in order to protect}} his family from the Gestapo. In reality, the attorney knew nothing about the forgeries, and <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> find out the reason for shortages in paper supplies. Heinz Heydrich is buried in the Soldatenfriedhof (soldiers cemetery) Riesenburg, according to the Deutsche Dienststelle (WASt).|$|E

25|$|Van Barneveld {{began the}} 2013 World Championship by {{throwing}} the sixth highest {{average in the}} history of the tournament in his first round 3–0 defeat of Michael Smith. In a match that lasted only 18 minutes he averaged 108.31 as he never looked in danger of exiting the tournament at the first hurdle for the second successive year. He beat Brendan Dolan 4–1, Gary Anderson 4–0 and Simon Whitlock 5–1 to reach the semi-finals where he faced Phil Taylor. Before the match Van Barneveld commented that he wasn't scared of Taylor and wanted to face him rather than Taylor's quarter-final opponent Andy Hamilton. Van Barneveld was 1–5 down in the match and almost staged a superb fightback as he won three successive sets to trail only 4–5. However, Taylor won the next set by three legs to one to take the match. The pair were involved in an angry confrontation after the match. Taylor reacted angrily when Van Barneveld pulled him back after their handshake, with both men being escorted away separately by security staff. Van Barneveld stated later that he <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> congratulate Taylor in a sportsmanlike way and give him a hug. Taylor apologised for his behaviour a day later.|$|E
500|$|Ono began visiting and telephoning Lennon's home and, {{when his}} wife asked him for an explanation, Lennon {{explained}} that Ono <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> obtain money for her [...] "avant-garde bullshit". While his wife was on holiday in Greece in May 1968, Lennon invited Ono to visit. They spent the night recording {{what would become the}} Two Virgins album, after which, he said, they [...] "made love at dawn." [...] When Lennon's wife returned home she found Ono wearing her bathrobe and drinking tea with Lennon who simply said, [...] "Oh, hi." [...] Ono became pregnant in 1968 and miscarried a male child on 21 November 1968, a few weeks after Lennon's divorce from Cynthia was granted.|$|E
500|$|In a 2002 interview, she said, [...] "I {{was very}} {{attracted}} to him. It {{was a really}} strange situation." [...] The two began corresponding and, in September 1967, Lennon sponsored Ono's solo show at Lisson Gallery in London. When Lennon's wife Cynthia asked for an explanation of why Ono was telephoning them at home, {{he told her that}} Ono <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> obtain money for her [...] "avant-garde bullshit." [...] In early 1968, while the Beatles were making their famous visit to India, Lennon wrote Julia and included a reference to Ono: [...] "Ocean child calls me", referring to the translation of Yoko's Japanese spelling. In May 1968, while his wife was on holiday in Greece, Lennon invited Ono to visit. They spent the night recording what would become the Two Virgins album, after which, he said, they [...] "made love at dawn".

500|$|Hamasaki's {{influence}} {{goes beyond}} music; she is often considered a fashion icon and trend-setter, a status attributed to her tight control over her image. Besides her frequent appearances in fashion magazines, such as Vivi, Popteen, and Cawaii!, Hamasaki {{has often been}} lauded for her trendy choices in apparels and accessories; Oricon has repeatedly named her the [...] "Most Fashionable Female Artist". Many aspects of Japan's fashions—including clothing, hair, nails, and accessories—have in some way been influenced by her. As with her music, trends Hamasaki started have spread to Asian countries as Taiwan, China, and Singapore. Among the trends Hamasaki has started is hime-kei (a look inspired by the fashions of 18th century French aristocracy); she has also heavily influenced the kogal subculture. Hamasaki's constantly changing image is apparent not only in her fashion photo shoots and commercial endorsements but also in her record covers, an element she considers essential in conveying her message. She has portrayed herself as a vine-clad [...] "peace muse" [...] or [...] "Greek goddess" [...] (on her album I Am...), as a [...] "twenty-first-century Joan of Arc" [...] (for her single [...] "Free & Easy"), and as a [...] "funky Lolita". Though Hamasaki has portrayed herself in earlier releases as a [...] "girl next door", she has adopted a more sexualized image since the release of Loveppears. The covers for records including Loveppears, I Am..., Rainbow, and Party Queen feature Hamasaki in states of partial nudity, for which she has generated controversy. Hamasaki also garnered criticism after she modeled bra for lingerie manufacturer Wacoal, {{though most of the}} criticism alleged that Hamasaki <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> [...] "play catch-up" [...] with Kumi Koda, who gained popularity for her overtly sexual image.|$|E
500|$|The afterlife {{experienced}} by the survivors is shown during season six. In [...] "The Substitute", Ben Linus is shown as a teacher of European History. In [...] "Dr. Linus", Ben laments his life in general, frustrated with the school bureaucracy and particularly due to Reynolds, the principal who does not care for the school. He is living with his father, Roger (Jon Gries), who is on life support. At school, he is shown to have {{a close relationship with}} his star pupil, Alex, and befriends a substitute teacher, John Locke. While studying together, Alex tells Ben that Principal Reynolds is having a sexual affair with one of the school nurses on campus. [...] Ben attempts to blackmail Reynolds, threatening to reveal his affair and citing his position as principal as the demand. However, Reynolds swiftly retaliates by saying if he makes good on his threats, Alex's chances of going to Yale University will decrease substantially, as he is requested to write her a recommendation letter. Wanting to save Alex's educational future, Ben backs down. Days later, Ben notices Desmond Hume waiting outside the school in his car for an extended amount of time. Desmond runs over Locke, and swiftly drives off. As soon as the ambulance arrives, Ben gets in and sits next to the critically injured Locke, assuring him everything will be all right. When Locke returns to the school, Desmond does as well, and Ben catches him. Desmond beats Ben severely saying he <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> help Locke let go. Ben has a vision from his previous life during Desmond's beating. Ben believes him and relays Locke this information. When Alex sees how badly Ben was beaten, she invites him to her house where her mother, Danielle, fixes him supper. Danielle tells Ben that Alex views him as a father, and Ben begins to cry. Ben waits outside the chapel where the Oceanic survivors plan to move on together, and he sees Locke for the last time. Ben sincerely apologizes to Locke for killing him, and Locke forgives him. Hurley later comes out of the chapel and invites Ben in, but Ben politely declines saying he is not ready to move on, saying he [...] "has a few things to work out". Hurley accepts this, and tells Ben that he was a [...] "real good number two", thanking him for his help in protecting the island. Ben, touched by this, responds [...] "And you were a great number one, Hugo." ...|$|E

2500|$|At the Glastonbury Festival, Depp {{brought up}} U.S. President Donald Trump. Depp then {{controversially}} said [...] "When {{was the last}} time an actor assassinated a President?", before saying [...] "I want to clarify: I'm not an actor. I lie for a living. However, it's been awhile and maybe it's time." [...] He then said that he was [...] "not insinuating anything." [...] The comment seemed to reference John Wilkes Booth, the actor who assassinated Abraham Lincoln. Shawn Holtzclaw of the Secret Service told CNN that they were [...] "aware" [...] of Depp's comment, but [...] said [...] "For security reasons, we cannot discuss specifically nor in general terms the means and methods of how we perform our protective responsibilities". The next day, Depp apologized for making these remarks, saying, [...] "It did not come out as intended, and I intended no malice.

2500|$|As well as {{writing the}} lyrics, The Smeezingtons {{worked on the}} entire {{production}} of the album, along with some songwriters and producers. Among these there were Needlz and Khalil Walton, who they never met but helped with {{the composition of the}} second track, [...] "Just the Way You Are", by enchanging files between them. According to Mars, the single took him months to create even though he <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> tell a story, nothing [...] "deep or poetic". [...] "The Lazy Song", the fifth track, was inspired by the lack of ideas for writing songs and laziness to work. [...] "Marry You", according to Lawrence, has its inspiration drawn from a spontaneous marriage idea in Vegas where a couple is running in slow-motion. The fiance and groom left the wedding party and everyone is raving. The bonus track, [...] "Somewhere in Brooklyn", was inspired by Mars' father and New York. The track assumes that a female character is around Brooklyn, and the singer will be able to find her.|$|E
