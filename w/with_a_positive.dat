40|$|This article {{investigates the}} {{interactive}} effects of chief executive officer (CEO) age and CEO attitudes toward younger and older employees on organisational age cultures. Data was collected from 66 CEOs of small and medium-sized businesses and 274 employees. Results were consistent with expectations based on organisational culture and upper echelons theories. The relationship between CEO age and organisational age culture for younger employees was negative for CEOs <b>with</b> <b>a</b> less <b>positive</b> attitude toward younger employees and <b>positive</b> for those <b>with</b> <b>a</b> more <b>positive</b> attitude toward younger employees. The relationship between CEO age and organisational age culture for older employees was <b>positive</b> for CEOs <b>with</b> <b>a</b> more <b>positive</b> attitude toward older employees and non-significant for those <b>with</b> <b>a</b> less <b>positive</b> attitude toward older employees. The findings provide initial support for the existence of organisational age cultures, suggesting that these cultures can be predicted by the interplay of CEO age and age-related attitudes...|$|R

It collected 180.2 million in two days, which according to Indo-Asian News Service, was Mahesh's career best opener. By collecting a distributor share of 276 million in its first weekend globally, Aagadu became the second highest Telugu film with highest opening weekend figures. Due to unfavourable word of mouth, the film's business witnessed a drop and it collected 312 million in its first week, ending the week on an average note.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{properties}} of gravity at short distances should be somewhat independent {{of the value of}} the cosmological constant, it is desirable to have a version of the AdS/CFT correspondence for positive cosmological constant. In 2001, Andrew Strominger introduced a version of the duality called the dS/CFT correspondence. This duality involves a model of spacetime called de Sitter space <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> cosmological constant. Such a duality is interesting from the point of view of cosmology since many cosmologists believe that the very early universe was close to being de Sitter space. Our universe may also resemble de Sitter space in the distant future.|$|E

However, Aagadu crossed the US$1 million mark at the United States box office in two days including its previews, which was considered a remarkable feat. The film was dubbed into Hindi as Encounter Shankar and into Tamil as Idhudhaanda Police.|$|E

It is the lightest particle <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> rest mass measured. Under ordinary conditions, electrons are bound to the positively charged nucleus by the attraction created from opposite electric charges. If an atom has more or fewer electrons than its atomic number, then it becomes respectively negatively or positively charged as a whole; a charged atom is called an ion. Electrons have been known since the late 19th century, mostly thanks to J.J. Thomson; see history of subatomic physics for details.|$|E

5|$|An {{electron}} generates {{an electric}} field that exerts an attractive force on a particle <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> charge, {{such as the}} proton, and a repulsive force on a particle with a negative charge. The strength of this force in nonrelativistic approximation is determined by Coulomb's inverse square law. When an electron is in motion, it generates a magnetic field. The Ampère-Maxwell law relates the magnetic field to the mass motion of electrons (the current) with respect to an observer. This property of induction supplies the magnetic field that drives an electric motor. The electromagnetic field of an arbitrary moving charged particle is expressed by the Liénard–Wiechert potentials, which are valid even when the particle's speed is close to that of light (relativistic).|$|E

He went 4–2 in 1918, outscoring the opposition 67–36, and 4–2–2 in 1919, despite a negative point differential of 51–59 caused by a 2–33 loss to the University of Pittsburgh. In 1920 his record was 5–2–1, outscoring other institutions 125–61 despite a 0–47 loss to Pittsburgh. He was 5–3–1 in his final season, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> point differential of 106–49; half of their points scored during this year came in a 54–0 victory over Juniata College.
