50|$|The <b>white-rumped</b> <b>seedeater</b> was {{formerly}} {{placed in the}} genus Serinus but phylogenetic analysis using mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences found that the genus was polyphyletic. The genus was therefore split {{and a number of}} species including the <b>white-rumped</b> <b>seedeater</b> were moved to the resurrected genus Crithagra Swainson 1827.|$|E

50|$|The {{southern}} {{grey-headed sparrow}} (Passer diffusus) is a passerine bird of the sparrow family Passeridae. It is sometimes {{treated as a}} subspecies of the grey-headed sparrow. It is found in savanna and woodland in Angola and Zambia southwards into South Africa, where it is expanding its range and is kept as a caged bird, like its relative the <b>white-rumped</b> <b>seedeater.</b>|$|E
50|$|This {{species has}} two {{distinctive}} subspecies groups {{which are not}} known to intergrade, and are thus sometimes considered to be separate species. The S. (t.) torqueola group, comprising the subspecies torqueola and atriceps and {{commonly known as the}} cinnamon-rumped seedeater, is found from Sinaloa and Durango to western and southern Oaxaca; the S. (t.) morelleti group, comprising the subspecies morelleti, sharpei, and mutanda and commonly known as the <b>white-rumped</b> <b>seedeater,</b> is found {{throughout the rest of the}} species' range.|$|E
