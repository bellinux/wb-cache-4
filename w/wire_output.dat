50|$|The {{objective}} of synthetic array heterodyne detection is to isolate regions {{of a large}} area detector surface into virtual pixels. This provides the benefits of having multiple pixels (for example, to make an image) without having to have physical pixels (i.e. isolated detector elements). The detector can be a simple single <b>wire</b> <b>output</b> over which all the virtual pixels can be read out continuously and in parallel. The pixels are multiplexed in the frequency domain.|$|E

40|$|Introduction Balancing {{networks}} were devised by Aspnes et al. [4] as a novel class of distributed data structures that provide highly-concurrent, low-contention solutions to a varietyofmultiprocessor synchronization problems. A balancing network is constructed from elementary switches with # input <b>wires</b> and # <b>output</b> <b>wires,</b> called (## #) -balancers. A (## #) -balancer accepts {{a stream of}} tokens on its # input wires. The #-th token to enter the balancer leaves on <b>output</b> <b>wire</b> # mod #, where # = 0 # 1 ####. One {{can think of a}} balancer as having a " state variable tracking which <b>output</b> <b>wire</b> the next token should exit from. A token traversal amounts to a Fetch&Increment operation to the toggle variable. This operation includes reading {{the current state of the}} toggle...|$|R
25|$|The area {{reduction}} in small wires is generally 15–25% and in larger wires is 20–45%. The exact die sequence {{for a particular}} job {{is a function of}} area reduction, input <b>wire</b> size and <b>output</b> <b>wire</b> size. As the area reduction changes, so does the die sequence.|$|R
40|$|SummaryRecent {{progress}} {{in understanding the}} diversity of midbrain dopamine neurons has highlighted the importance—and the challenges—of defining mammalian neuronal cell types. Although neurons may be best categorized using inclusive criteria spanning biophysical properties, wiring of inputs, <b>wiring</b> of <b>outputs,</b> and activity during behavior, linking all of these measurements to cell types within the intact brains of living mammals has been difficult. Here, using an array of intact-brain circuit interrogation tools, including CLARITY, COLM, optogenetics, viral tracing, and fiber photometry, we explore the diversity of dopamine neurons within the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). We identify two parallel nigrostriatal dopamine neuron subpopulations differing in biophysical properties, input <b>wiring,</b> <b>output</b> <b>wiring</b> to dorsomedial striatum (DMS) versus dorsolateral striatum (DLS), and natural activity patterns during free behavior. Our results reveal independently operating nigrostriatal information streams, with implications for understanding the logic of dopaminergic feedback circuits and the diversity of mammalian neuronal cell types...|$|R
5000|$|L!VE TV was {{proposed}} by David Montgomery as MGN's foray into pay television. Mirror Television, a Mirror Group plc subsidiary, bought Wire TV [...] which included sports content shown {{at certain times}} during <b>Wire's</b> <b>output.</b> Sports programming on Wire had been expanded when several sporting rights were acquired, such as Vauxhall Conference football, the live broadcast rights to screen Lennox Lewis's WBC title fights and the 1996 Cricket World Cup {{as well as other}} sporting coverage following a deal with Chrysalis Sport. Mirror Group planned to turn Sportswire into a separate channel to operate alongside the proposed L!VE TV, which would replace Wire. Wire was closed at the end of May 1995 but the proposed Sportswire channel came to nothing, leaving Mirror Television with just L!VE TV.|$|R

50|$|A {{comparator}} circuit is {{a network of}} wires and gates. Each comparator gate, which is a directed edge connecting two wires, takes its two inputs and outputs them in sorted order (the larger value ending up in the wire the edge is pointing to). The input to any wire can be either a variable, its negation, or a constant. One of the wires is designated as the <b>output</b> <b>wire.</b> The function computed by the circuit is evaluated by initializing the wires according to the input variables, executing the comparator gates in order, and outputting the value carried by the <b>output</b> <b>wire.</b>|$|R
50|$|When <b>output</b> <b>wires</b> are fed back as inputs, {{the result}} is a {{feedback}} loop or sequential circuit that has the potential to consider its own history. Such circuits are often suitable as memories.|$|R

50|$|It is {{important}} to contrast a native three-phase inverter with three single-phase micro-inverters <b>wired</b> to <b>output</b> in three-phase. The later is a relatively common feature of most inverter designs, allowing you to connect three identical inverters together, each across a pair of wires in a three-phase circuit. The result is three-phase power, but each inverter in the system is outputting a single phase. These sorts of solutions do {{not take advantage of}} the reduced energy storage needs outlined above.|$|R
5000|$|Other authors use {{the term}} [...] "complementary pass {{transistor}} logic" [...] (CPL) to indicate a style of implementing logic gates using dual-rail encoding.

40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{counting}} network construction, where {{the number of}} input wires w is smaller {{than or equal to}} the number of <b>output</b> <b>wires</b> t. The depth of our network is Θ(lg 2 w), which depends only on w. In contrast, the amortized contention of the network depends on the number of concurrent processes n and the parameters w and t. This offers more flexibility than all previously known networks, with the same number w of input and <b>output</b> <b>wires,</b> whose contention depends only on two parameters, w and n. As a result, when choosing n, t ≥ w lg w, the contention of our network is O(n lg w/w), which improves by a logarithmic factor of w over all previously known networks with w wires...|$|R
40|$|It {{is shown}} that a weak {{threshold}} network (in particular, threshold network) of width w and depth d cannot be constructed from balancers of width p 0 �p 1 �:::�pm; 1, if w does not divide P d, where P is the least common multiple of p 0 �p 1 �:::�pm; 1. This holds regardless {{of the size of}} the network, as long as it is nite, and it implies alower bound of log P w on its depth. More strongly, alower bound of log pmax w is shown on the length of every path from an input <b>wire</b> to any <b>output</b> <b>wire</b> that exhibits the threshold property, where pmax is the maximum among p 0 �p 1 �:::�pm; 1...|$|R

40|$|This {{assignment}} is an asymptotic analysis of some sorting networks {{in terms of}} time and energy. Here, a sorting network is n input wires of some fixed bit width (assumed to represent integers) that traverses a series of comparators leading to n <b>output</b> <b>wires</b> and any input will be output in sorted order. A comparator is a module of hardware logic of unit area with two input <b>wires</b> and two <b>output</b> <b>wires,</b> where the values input are output in sorted order. The time to perform one operation in time t and energy e as given by the invariant value of et 2, say et 2 = 1, where an operation is either a signal traversing a wire of unit length or a single comparison. For example, a comparison can be made in one unit of time consuming one unit of energy, or half a unit of time consuming 4 units of energy. We assume that the values of t and e can vary for each wire and comparator. We look at some existing sorting networks to cast into our definition of a sorting network. A sorting network (as defined in [1]) for bubble sort is given in [1]. Figure 47 on page 224 is a bubble sort network on 6 inputs, shown below...|$|R

Before Nixie tubes became prominent, most numeric displays were electromechanical, using stepping mechanisms to display digits either directly {{by use of}} cylinders bearing printed numerals attached to their rotors, or indirectly by <b>wiring</b> the <b>outputs</b> of stepping switches to indicator bulbs. Later, a few vintage clocks even used a form of stepping switch to drive Nixie tubes.|$|R
50|$|Some early {{computers}} used ordinary relays {{as a kind}} of latch—they store bits {{in ordinary}} wire spring relays or reed relays by feeding an <b>output</b> <b>wire</b> back as an input, resulting in a feedback loop or sequential circuit.
