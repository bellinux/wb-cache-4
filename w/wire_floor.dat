However, preference tests showed that chickens preferred the thinner wire. Photographs taken from under the cages showed that the thinner mesh offered more points of contact for the feet than the thick mesh, thereby spreading the load on the hens' feet and presumably feeling more comfortable to the birds.|$|E

40|$|This review {{provides}} a comprehensive {{overview of the}} vascularization of the avian growth plate and its subsequent role in the pathogenesis of bacterial chondronecrosis with osteomyelitis (BCO, femoral head necrosis). BCO sporadically causes high incidences of lameness in rapidly growing broiler (meat-type) chickens. BCO {{is believed to be}} initiated by micro-trauma to poorly mineralized columns of cartilage cells in the proximal growth plates of the leg bones, followed by colonization by hematogenously distributed opportunistic bacteria. Inadequate blood flow to the growth plate, vascular occlusion, and structural limitations of the microvasculature all have been implicated in the pathogenesis of BCO. Treatment strategies have been difficult to investigate because under normal conditions the incidence of BCO typically is low and sporadic. Rearing broilers on <b>wire</b> <b>flooring</b> triggers the spontaneous development of high incidences of lameness attributable to pathognomonic BCO lesions. <b>Wire</b> <b>flooring</b> imposes persistent footing instability and is thought to accelerate the development of BCO by amplifying the torque and shear stress imposed on susceptible leg joints. <b>Wire</b> <b>flooring</b> per se also constitutes a significant chronic stressor that promotes bacterial proliferation attributed to stress-mediated immunosuppression. Indeed, dexamethasone-mediated immunosuppression causes broilers to develop lameness primarily associated with avascular necrosis and BCO. Prophylactic probiotic administration consistently reduces the incidence of lameness in broilers reared on <b>wire</b> <b>flooring,</b> presumably by reducing bacterial translocation from the gastrointestinal tract that likely contributes to hematogenous infection of the leg bones. The pathogenesis of BCO in broilers is directly relevant to osteomyelitis in growing children, as well as to avascular femoral head necrosis in adults.

We compared three types of housing: (1) individual cage housing on a <b>wire</b> <b>floor</b> (3952 cm(2) /doe, maximum roof height 63 cm, one 1000 cm(2) plastic footrest/doe), (2) semi-group housing on a <b>wire</b> <b>floor</b> (5000 cm(2) /doe, roofless, one 1000 cm(2) plastic footrest/doe) and (3) the same semi-group housing, but with a fully plastic slatted floor. In all housing systems, does had free access to an elevated platform. In the semi-group housing pens, four does were housed communally during 21 days of the reproduction cycle (to allow more space for locomotion and to increase opportunities for social contact), and individually during the other 21 days of the cycle (to minimize doe-doe and doe-kit aggression that peaks around kindling). In all, 24 Hycole does were included per system. The does entered the experiment at 203 days of age (after their first parity). The experiment consisted of four reproductive cycles, ending at 369 days of age. Pododermatitis was scored in cycles 1, 2 and 4. At {{the end of the}} 4 th cycle the does were euthanized and X-rays were taken to assess spinal deformation. Tibia and femur length, width and cortical thickness were determined and bone strength was assessed using a shear test, as a measure of bone quality.

The percentage (approximate to 70 %) of hens which renested after either method of nest deprivation did not differ significantly. 4. Readiness to renest was not related to the concentrations of plasma prolactin measured before or during the 3 days of nest deprivation. However, hens which would later renest could be identified by using behavioural criteria. They emitted more avoidance trills before, and sat on the <b>wire</b> <b>floor</b> for longer periods during, the nest deprivation period than the others...|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} of chicken {{is influenced by}} several factors such as cage floor model and feeding pattem. The {{purposes of this study}} were to examine the effect of feeding time restrictions and cage system on the final body weight and mortslity. This study used 48 broilers DOC, mix of male and female, litter cage system from grain/chaff and <b>wire</b> <b>floor</b> cage that was equipped with a feed and drinking places as well as a heater. Feed rations used for the study was a commercial ration for starter period with crumble form. This study used a completely randomized design (CRD) pattern of 2 x 2 factorial with three replications and each replication consisted of four chickens. The firs factor is the type of cage floor consisting daily as needed per cow per day (R 1) and skip a day (one day to eat a day of fasting). The results showed that ad-libitum feed rations and litter cage model (R 1 K 1), produced the highest body weight (903, 3 grams) and showed significant differences in the treatment of rationing skip a day and litter cage model (R 2 K 1) is 0, 751 kg(the lowest body weight) but not significantly different from the treatment of rationing skip a day and a wire cage model (0. 785 kg) Chicken mortality during the study was 2. 08 %...|$|E

50|$|On May 29, 2008, MSNBC aired {{a report}} about puppy mills, in which {{talk show host}} Oprah Winfrey {{revealed}} an industry fraught with problems and apparent cruelty. The broadcast showed puppy mills with small cages, with chicken <b>wire</b> <b>floors,</b> stacked in rows from floor to ceiling, and stated that many dogs spend their entire lives within these tiny cages. Many of these dogs are sold on the internet or by pet retailers to buyers who are unaware of the dogs' background. The report claimed that customers who object to this treatment of puppies unknowingly allow the industry to thrive. It {{also pointed out that}} many of the puppy mill bred dogs suffer long-term health problems.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1986 I. Performance and Carcass Quality of Broilers Raised on <b>Wire</b> <b>Flooring</b> With and Without Padded Roosts Two {{experiments}} were performed with broilers raised on <b>wire</b> <b>flooring</b> {{with and without}} padded roosts to {{study the effects of}} bird performance and carcass quality. Each experiment had 480 straight-run commercial broilers divided equally into two treatments and reared on wire with and without padded roosts. At 49 days of age, body weights were taken and feed conversions were calculated. Birds were observed for percent mortality, percent deformed legs, percent breast blisters, percent feather follicle infection (folliculitis) and foot pad dermatitis. In Experiment 1, percent incidence breast blisters was the only parameter with a significant difference (P<. 05) between birds on plain wire and birds reared on wire with padded roosts. In Experiment 2, no significant differences were observed in the parameters measured between the birds reared on wire with and without padded roosts. II. Performance and Carcass Quality with Broilers Reared On <b>Wire</b> <b>Flooring,</b> Plastic Inserts, Wood Slats and Plastic Coated Expanded Metal Flooring 2 Each With and Without Padded Roosts Commercial straight-run broilers were reared on non-litter flooring in two experiments. Experiment 1 had (control on wire; wire with padded roosts; wood slats; wood slats with padded roosts; plastic insert over wire; plastic insert over wire with padded roosts; plastic coated expanded metal; plastic coated expanded metal with padded roosts) to study the effects on broiler performance and carcass quality. In Experiment 1, mean body weights, foot pad dermatitis, feed conversion and percent incidences of mortality, deformed legs and body fat were not significantly different among the treatments. Feather soilage score and percent incidence of feather follicle infection were significantly higher (P<. 05) for broilers reared on wood slats with and without padded roosts compared to those reared on wire and plastic inserts. Percent incidence breast blister was significantly higher (P<. 05) for controls on wire than all other treatments. In Experiment 2, mean body weights, feed conversion and percent incidences of feather follicle infection, deformed legs and mortality were not significantly different among treatments. Feather soilage score was significantly lower (P<. 05) with birds reared on wire both with and without padded roosts than those on expanded metal. Foot pad dermatitis scores and percent incidence breast blisters were significantly higher (P<. 05) among controls on wire than birds on wire with padded roosts and birds on expanded metal. Percent incidence of indented keels was significantly higher (P<. 05) with birds reared on floors with roosts than those without roosts...|$|R
