She then sailed upstream, reaching Rustschuk on 11 October, and Giurgiu two days later. On 14 October, she was deployed at Lom.

On 31 October 1918, Bodrog collided with a sand bank while navigating through heavy fog near Vinča. She was later captured by the Serbian Army.|$|E

Hanson then returned to McMahon's New England-based Capitol Wrestling, which had since become the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). Using the gimmick of a redneck, complete with long hair and a Confederate flag, he competed for the WWF as a face {{until his retirement in}} 1986.|$|E

5|$|As a vespid wasp, P. exclamans nests are {{typically}} {{made up of}} paper with a single layer of cells with open combs. Although nest size varies, the upper limit is around 500 cells. Although many vespid wasp nests have an outer envelope of paper, P. exclamans nests do not. As indicated by Strassmann and Orgren, “Nests are approximately circular, and have a single off-center pedicel usually located towards {{the top of the}} nest. Cells near the pedicle are the oldest.” P. exclamans are particularly able to colonize new sites as foundresses often disperse into new territories. P. exclamans have often been found to have nests located near man-made structures and tend to more readily build nests in and near these man-made structures. Out of six wasp species, P. exclamans <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> occupied artificial nesting sites. It prefers well-lit, open sites.|$|E

Callie also left Arizona at therapy, telling her that she <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> needed to go. After being hit by a lawsuit, her father, Carlos, visits and tells Callie that he cheated on her mother but she took him back and Callie wouldn't be here if her mother didn't give Carlos a second chance. Callie goes to Arizona's apartment and invites her to come back home. Callie finds out during surgery that Arizona was sleeping with Leah, a second year resident, while separated. Although angry at Arizona, Callie still agrees to work things out.|$|E
5|$|In 1956, {{residents}} of Coney Island protested against paying a {{transfer to the}} bus on Mermaid Avenue (now the B74 bus to Sea Gate), with some saying that the 15-cent fee for transferring should be abolished because the bus was essentially an adjunct to the station. In 1979, the City Planning Commission proposed something similar, in that Coney Island residents would get a free transfer between the /B74 bus routes and the subway station. It was noted that the station <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> {{did not get a}} free bus transfer after the corresponding subway transfer was discontinued (in sharp contrast to the BMT Culver Line, BMT Myrtle Avenue Line, and IRT Third Avenue Line, which were discontinued but replaced by bus transfers). The free transfers would allow a $200 million apartment complex nearby, funded by the government, to get more residents to move in, as well as diversify Mark Twain Junior High School and attract a stable middle class.|$|E

5|$|After its release, American Life debuted {{at number}} one on the United States Billboard 200 chart with 241,000copies sold in its first week. The sales were less than Madonna's {{previous}} studio album, Music, which debuted with 420,000copies in 2000, but <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> week to sell over 200,000copies. It was Madonna's second consecutive number one debut, and her fifth number one album overall in the US. The next week, sales dropped by 62% to 91,000copies, and the album slid {{from the top of the}} chart to number eight. It continued to decrease in sales down the chart and fell off the Billboard 200. In September 2003, following Madonna's performance at the MTV Video Music Awards, the album saw a sales gain of 19%, but did not chart back. On July 7, 2003, just months after the release, it was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), signifying shipment of one million copies in the US alone. However, it became the third lowest selling studio album by Madonna behind her 2012 release MDNA and her 2015 release Rebel Heart, with sales of 680,000copies as of October 2012, according to Nielsen SoundScan. It ranked at number125 on the year-end ranking of the albums by Billboard. In Canada, the album debuted at the top of the Canadian Albums Chart with sales of 18,000copies on May 10, 2003. According to Nielsen SoundScan, the sum was considerably less than her previous studio efforts, Ray of Light (1998) and Music (2000), which debuted with 59,000and 50,000copies respectively. It gained a Platinum certification one month later from the Canadian Recording Industry Association (CRIA), for shipment of 100,000copies of the album.|$|E
5|$|Mariano Moreno {{had several}} {{contacts}} with groups seeking {{the removal of}} Cisneros, but was not strongly involved with the May Revolution, which considered {{the fall of the}} Junta of Seville a reason to depose the viceroy and create a local junta. At the time, Moreno was still loyal to Álzaga. He attended the May 22 open Cabildo, but according to the father of Vicente Fidel López and the father-in-law of Bartolomé Mitre (both direct witness) he stayed silent at one side and did not join the debate. He voted for Saavedra's proposal: to remove viceroy Cisneros and replace him with a Junta. Manuel Hermenegildo Aguirre, captain of hussars, proposed that the Cabildo take the reins of government, with five men appointed as counselors, Moreno among them. However, nobody else voted for that proposal, and it <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> included him. Moreno felt betrayed when the Cabildo twisted the results of the open Cabildo and created a Junta that would be headed by Cisneros. He refused any further contacts with the revolutionaries and stayed home during the remaining events. The definitive members of the Junta came from a popular petition signed on May 25, which was given to the Cabildo. The reasons of Moreno's inclusion in the list are unclear, as with all other members of the Junta. A commonly accepted theory considers it to be a balance between Carlotists and Alzaguists.|$|E
