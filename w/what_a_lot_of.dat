25|$|After {{the western}} {{economic}} {{boom of the}} mid-'80s, the younger generation had a decreased influence in fashion as they had less of {{an impact on the}} market. The main consumer became the older generations that were more financially stable and were influenced by international political news. Thatcherism were promoted in the UK by the British Conservative Party. Leader of the British conservative party, Margaret Thatcher, in her power suit quickly {{became one of the most}} well-known symbol in the 1980s. Suits worn by Margaret Thatcher were usually single color toned with a matching hat, jacket and skirt, that ends below the knee. A wide shoulder cutting and pearl necklace was also part of her regular attire. Her political style was straightforward, effective and sometimes criticized as not empathetic enough. But there is no doubt that her appearance portrayed her ability, power and authority, which is <b>what</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> working women at that era desired.|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to the religious themes, the cruel way in which Damien is treated by the other children is a satire on the tendency of schoolchildren to relentlessly pick on new students. Stone said of {{this aspect of the}} episode, [...] "The whole basis of South Park was that kids are little shitheads and civilization and society controls them. Instead of <b>what</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> hippies and Democrats think, which is we're born innocent and pure and society corrupts us.

500|$|I {{try not to}} get too {{specific}} so {{that people}} can apply the lyrics to their own lives. When I was growing up and listening to the radio and I would hear a song that reminded me of a certain person or a situation or whatever, I would {{want to be able to}} completely connect it to that moment. And then if I heard someone explaining it and making it into something totally different, it ruined it for me. So I kind of like to keep it open for people's imaginations. It evokes something different depending on who listens to it and at what time. [...] "Don't Forget About Us" [...] could give you a good, happy memory, or you could be miserable, crying, listening to it over and over.

2500|$|In {{the second}} season when the {{characters}} are in 11th grade, Willow becomes more sure of herself, {{standing up to the}} conceited Cordelia Chase (Charisma Carpenter), and approaching Xander, on whom she has had a crush for years, although it is unrequited as Xander is in love with Buffy. Seth Green joined the cast during {{the second season}} as Oz, a high school senior who becomes a werewolf, and Willow's primary romantic interest. The show's popularity by early 1998 was evident to the cast members, and Hannigan remarked on her surprise specifically. Willow was noted to be the spirit of the Scooby Gang, and Hannigan attributed Willow's popularity with viewers (she had by May 1998 seven websites devoted to her) to being an underdog who develops confidence and is accepted by Buffy, a strong, popular person in school. Hannigan described her appeal: [...] "Willow is the only reality-based character. She really is <b>what</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> high-schoolers are like, with that awkwardness and shyness, and all those adolescent feelings." ...|$|E
2500|$|PVRIS {{planned to}} call the album Haunt or have it self-titled, however they were quite indecisive. Eventually they agreed on naming it {{after one of the}} songs, [...] "White Noise". All of the {{material}} that features on White Noise was written by Lyndsey Gunnulfsen and producer Blake Harnage of VERSA, with the exception of [...] "Holy", [...] "Fire" [...] and [...] "Eyelids", which were written by Gunnulfsen, Harnage and Sierra Kusterbeck. Gunnulfsen wrote the songs while she was [...] "in a very dark place in my mind". Compared to the band's previous output, Gunnulfsen said that White Noise [...] "is very different from <b>what</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> people were expecting but in the best way". She explained that the album's sound was [...] "rock mixed with electronic/pop kind of stuff", resulting in [...] "a lot of different vibes throughout the album." [...] Gunnulfsen was inspired by Saosin, Circa Survive, Ellie Goulding, Rihanna, and The Weeknd. Gavin Lloyd of Classic Rock wrote that the album featured [...] "infectious rock" [...] done by the likes of Paramore and We Are the In Crowd, and [...] "dark electro-pop" [...] performed by artists such as Purity Ring and Banks. Natasha Van Duser of Inked compared the [...] "steady bass lines, groovy backbeats, and melodic vocals" [...] to the likes of Taylor Swift's 1989 (2014).|$|E

2500|$|Crenshaw was {{met with}} {{generally}} positive reviews from music critics. Louis Johnson of The Badger Herald gave the mixtape a very positive review: [...] "He's a diamond in the rough. For fans of West Coast hip hop, his music is infectious. Nipsey is proof that an independent artist can become {{a major force in}} today's world of Clear Channel sameness and major label monopolies. This is just the beginning, though. In a Tuesday tweet Nipsey said, '...I made a hunnit k today off my album throw away's.' If this is true, it's scary to think of how good his album will be." [...] Bruce Smith of HipHopDX deemed the project a [...] "free album" [...] (their highest praise for mixtapes). He said, [...] "The Bullets Ain't Got No Name series was music straight off Slauson Avenue; it was Hip Hop from a South Central state of mind. With his Marathon series, Nipsey offered himself as a Slauson boy, matured, and free of label politics. Crenshaw is where the two sets of projects meet up. While he may have never strayed far from the streets of Los Angeles, Crenshaw is like a homecoming for the artist that dropped the last two Marathon mixtapes, bringing the growth and maturity shown on the Marathon series back to a project that bares a close resemblance to the Bullets Ain’t Got No Name tapes. While not without its flaws, at its high points (of which there are many) Crenshaw is on par, or above <b>what</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> artists have put on shelves as of late." ...|$|E
