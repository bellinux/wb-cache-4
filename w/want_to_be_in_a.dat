5|$|In general, {{up through}} 2012, Valve would {{manually}} select games {{to be included}} on the Steam service, generally limiting these to games that either had a major developer supporting them, or smaller studios with proven track records for Valve's purposes. Valve have sought ways to enable more games to be offered through Steam, while pulling away from manually approving games for the service, short of validating that a game runs on the platforms the publisher had indicated. Alden Kroll, {{a member of the}} Steam development team, said that Valve knows Steam is in a near-monopoly for game sales on personal computers, and the company does not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> position to determine what gets sold, and thus had tried to find ways to make the process of adding games to Steam outside of their control. At the same time, Valve recognized that unfettered control of games onto the service can lead to discovery problems as well as low-quality games that are put onto the service for a cash grab.|$|E
500|$|Becoming a {{restricted}} free {{agent for the}} second consecutive summer, Hansen was taken to salary arbitration by the Canucks. Following his hearing on 20 July 2010, he was awarded a one-year, one-way deal worth $850,000, which the Canucks agreed to. Recording career-highs of 9 goals, 20 assists and 29 points over 82 games in 2010–11, Hansen received the Canucks' Fred J. Hume Award as the team's [...] "unsung hero" [...] (voted by the Canucks' booster club). He added three goals and nine points over 25 games in the 2011 playoffs as the Canucks advanced to the Stanley Cup Finals, where they were defeated in seven games by the Boston Bruins. In the off-season, Hansen filed for salary arbitration. Prior to his hearing, Hansen and the Canucks avoided arbitration by agreeing to a three-year, $4.05 million contract. Many in the media, including those from the local Province newspaper, suggested that he ceded to the Canucks' negotiations, to which Hansen responded, [...] "If you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> position to win, you have to make some sacrifices." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite Ice-T's {{attempts}} to differentiate Body Count {{from his work}} in the hip hop genre, the press focused on the group's rap image. Ice-T felt that politicians had intentionally referred to the song [...] "Cop Killer" [...] as rap to provoke negative criticism. [...] "There is absolutely no way to listen to the song 'Cop Killer' and call it a rap record. It's so far from rap. But, politically, they know by saying the word rap they can get {{a lot of people who}} think, 'Rap-black-rap-black-ghetto,' and don't like it. You say the word rock, people say, 'Oh, but I like Jefferson Airplane, I like Fleetwood Mac — that's rock.' They don't want to use the word rock & roll to describe this song." [...] Body Count has since been credited for pioneering the rap metal genre popularized by groups such as Rage Against the Machine and Limp Bizkit, although Ice-T does not rap on any of the album's tracks. Ernie C stated that [...] "A lot of rappers <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> rock band, but it has to be done sincerely. You can't just get anybody on guitar and expect it to work. [...] really loved the music we were doing, and it showed." ...|$|E

I think there's a lot of heart and spirit in the album which is connected with the loss of our dear friend Paul but also an attempt to try and make sense of it and move forward. And as such, it seemed the most obvious and {{best way to do that}} was to be playing music again with each other, Nick and I. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> band and what other band could it be." [...] Crowded House's leader, Neil Finn has indicated that, as the album began life as a solo project, its sound is generally different from Crowded House, though similar in parts, indicating that no one album by the group sounds like this one. As the album is dedicated to Hester and attends to his death, much of the album has a mournful tone, however this has been received well by critics, with some indicating that [...] "fortunately, Finn is a master at expressing ambiguity, (both) lyrically and musically". Finn has said of the song [...] "People Are Like Suns", that [...] "Part of it is the idea that people burn brightly and then they fade out. Also, when I wrote it, I was reading Ian McEwan's novel Saturday, which begins with a man on his balcony watching his plane go down, so the first lines borrow something from that image." ...|$|E

However, she never once thought that she herself would <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> similar position—changing into something else—so she merely just enjoyed watching the transformation before her. That by itself is enough for her, she recounts to Hazumu. Using this as a metaphor, Ayuki tries to explain to Hazumu that watching her loved one from afar is its own variety of love, though Ayuki never explicitly states just who she admires from a distance. Ayuki is good friends with Tomari, and Ayuki will often give her, and others, advice and help in regards to relationships. Keeping with her stance on watching from afar, Ayuki continuously observes the ongoing development of the love triangle between Hazumu, Yasuna, and Tomari.|$|E

2500|$|The {{three main}} issues were RCA {{position}} on homosexuality, {{the adoption of}} the Belhar confession and complementarianism. Beyond the three reasons University Reformed Church mentioned: [...] "We have a deep desire to belong to a family of churches where who we are as a congregation fits squarely with what our denomination does and believes." [...] "We want to raise up pastors who do not fear that the ordination process is against them"."We want to work alongside churches that share our convictions." [...] "We <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> denomination that sees us as occupying center ground, notsome extreme right flank". [...] "The denomination(RCA) has moved away from churches like ours." [...] "We want to work alongside churches that share our convictions." [...] "In practice, the RCA is already well down this path [...] and that given the way our classical structure works those who stand for biblical orthodoxy can do little to stop it. We believe laboring in such a mixed denomination undermines the true nature of biblical unity, hinders our witness for Christ, and does not represent the most effective avenue for ministry for URC in the years and decades ahead." [...] "URC would be able to serve with greater integrity and disciple our people (especially ministerial candidates) more effectively if we were in a denomination that shares our complementarian convictions, rather than in one that is moving full speed ahead in the other direction." [...] "We(URC) are troubled by the weak form of confessional subscription in the RCA, the process for examining ministerial candidates, and our formal ecumenical ties with liberal denominations like the UCC, ELCA and PCUSA". [...] "We have often heard from visitors that though they lived in Lansing for years they never thought to visit URC because it was an RCA church or because of things they had heard about liberal leanings in the RCA. How many others might be staying away because our denominational affiliation gives them the wrong idea about who we are and what we believe?"We do not recommend our RCA seminaries. [...] "We <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> denomination that sees us as occupying center ground, not some extreme right flank". [...] "The RCA connection inhibits interest in planting churches, the vision for training up pastors, and placement for new pastors." [...] "we also feel a measure of distance between us and most churches in the denomination".|$|E

[...] "That compares to only 19 percent of 'change' caucus-goers who preferred Clinton." [...] Axelrod also believed that the Clinton campaign underestimated the importance of the caucus states. [...] "For all the talent and the money they had over there," [...] says Axelrod, [...] "they—bewilderingly—seemed to have little understanding for the caucuses and how important they would become."

[...] In testing and classification they don't show what they can really do. [...] They try {{to show that they}} are not able to do some movement, and that is why we have started functional testing." [...] She goes on to say [...] "The second problem is that when you have a very good athlete who is very well trained in the sport, you don't want to punish that person for their good performance. [...] He or she might be an elite athlete doing a very good sport performance, and you might be tempted to say 'OK, he is doing so well he must be in another class.' We do try to get fewer classes so that we don't get, for example, 10 or 12 gold medals in alpine sports.
