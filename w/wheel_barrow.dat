2500|$|Hunt {{became the}} first person elected to two {{consecutive}} four-year terms as governor, serving from 1943 to 1949. He faced hostile majorities {{in both houses of}} the legislature throughout his years as governor. The principal legislative accomplishment of his first term was the enactment of a retirement system for teachers. He repeatedly proposed a retirement system for state workers in his second term without success. During his first term, Republican U.S. Senator Edward V. Robertson charged that the Japanese citizens interned at Heart Mountain, Wyoming, were leading pampered lives and hoarding supplies. The Denver Post wrote an expose backing his complaints. Hunt dismissed that as a [...] "political story" [...] and said that [...] "food stuffs cannot be brought into a city to feed 13,500 people in a <b>wheel</b> <b>barrow</b> and it would not be good business to bring it in every day." [...] He toured the camp and said the internees' [...] "living standard was, to my way of thinking, rather disgraceful." [...] At {{the end of the war}} he wrote to the War Relocation Authority that [...] "We do not want a single one of these evacuees to remain in Wyoming." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{tools that}} were used {{at the time were}} similar to what gardeners use today. For instance, shears, rakes, hoes, spades, baskets, and <b>wheel</b> <b>barrows</b> were used and are still {{important}} today. There was even a tool that acted much like a watering can, called a thumb pot. Made from clay, the thumb pot has small holes at the bottom and a thumb hole at the top. The pot was submerged in water, and the thumb hole covered until the water was needed. A perforated pot was also used to hang over plants for constant moisture.|$|R
5000|$|Softscape {{refers to}} the live horticultural {{elements}} of a landscape. Softscaping can include, flowers, plants, shrubs, trees, flower beds, and duties like weed/nuisance management, grading, planting, mowing, trimming, aerating, spraying, and digging for everything from plants and shrubs , to flower beds. <b>Wheel</b> <b>barrows</b> and manual tools like rakes, shovels, picks, and gas power tools are commonly used. This is a term that has been popularized in recent pop culture (2006 onwards) on television shows such as Home & Garden Television. The purpose of softscape is to lend character to the landscaping, create an aura, ambience, and reflect the sensibilities of the inhabitants.|$|R

50|$|Construction on {{the road}} began on 19 September 1919, built by {{approximately}} 3,000 returned servicemen as a war memorial for fellow servicemen {{who had been killed}} in World War I. An advance survey team progressed through dense wilderness at approximately 3 kilometres a month. Construction was done by hand; using explosives, pick and shovel, <b>wheel</b> <b>barrows,</b> and some small machinery, and was at times perilous, with several workers killed on the job; the final sections along steep coastal mountains being the most difficult to work on. Anecdotal evidence from ABC archives in 1982 suggested workers would rest detonators on their knees during travel, as it was the softest ride for them.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — A good {{plant layout}} creates an {{efficient}} process flow of products, materials, tools, equipment and workers. This results in saving on material handling costs and movement time between work centers, {{in addition to}} reducing operator’s fatigue. Most companies start small and grow into big establishments, expanding and adjusting plant layout to accommodate new lines or work stations. The flow of work becomes disrupted and non-value motions are created. This paper report on a re-organization of a section in a small and medium industry manufacturing <b>wheel</b> <b>barrows.</b> Systematic Layout Procedure (SLP) proposed by Muther is used. Time study is used to show the effect of the re-organized layout. The improved layout reduced the travel distances by 52 % and cycle time effectively reduced by 12 %...|$|R

50|$|The {{process of}} {{excavation}} is achieved {{in many ways}} depending {{on the nature of}} the deposits to be removed and time constraints. In the main, deposits are lifted by Trowel and Mattock and shovelled or carried from the site by <b>wheel</b> <b>barrow</b> and bucket. The use of many other tools including fine trowels such as the plaster's leaf trowel and brushes of various grades are used on delicate items such as human bone and decayed timber. When removing material from the archaeological record some basic guidelines are often observed.|$|E

The workers leave the milling room running and resistance is met at the foundry. The strikers throw rocks and loose metal through the foundry windows. Then locked within {{the gates of the}} complex, the crowd confronts the office. They force open the gates and seize a manager carting him off in a <b>wheel</b> <b>barrow</b> dumping them down a hill into the water. The crowd disperses.|$|E
5000|$|Landscape Planning, 1963, (Des Moines, Iowa: Meredith Books).A book {{edited and}} {{published}} by Better Homes & Gardens which includes work by Thomas Dolliver Church. Organized around seven chapters and a home portfolio, the book highlights recent trends in landscape design {{to make the best}} use of the yard with low maintenance examples to create livable gardens that increase convenience, privacy, beauty and pleasure. Convenience is meant to make things easier, 'a gate wide enough for both the <b>wheel</b> <b>barrow</b> and your knuckles!' asserted Martini. Privacy is the choice to control what we do in our daily lives, for example, getting the morning paper in your bathrobe. Beauty is the principal reward and goal when planning the composition of your garden. Last, pleasure is 'the feeling that all things are [...] "right with the world."' (10-12).|$|E

50|$|The RVRR {{was built}} in stages, from south to north, as funding became available. By February, 1888, Melick had {{obtained}} sufficient money, $60,000 from sales of stock, to begin building the southernmost 4 miles from White House to New Germantown (Oldwick, New Jersey). This was based on Melick's original $15,000 per mile estimate. Much of this funding came from local peach growers who stood to gain from a rail connection to transport their perishable crop to market. The initial grading began on May 17, 1888. All work was performed using picks, shovels and <b>wheel</b> <b>barrows.</b> A steam locomotive, an old 4-4-0, was christened as the P.W. Melick (John E.V. Melick's father), and was put to work constructing the line, hauling railroad ties and railroad track. Although the line to Watnong would not be fully completed until August 1892, revenue started flowing into the railroad's coffers in 1888, as gross income for that year amounted to a modest $992.46.|$|R
