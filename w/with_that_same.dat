5|$|Pathogens can rapidly evolve and adapt, {{and thereby}} avoid {{detection}} and neutralization by the immune system; however, multiple defense mechanisms have also evolved {{to recognize and}} neutralize pathogens. Even simple unicellular organisms such as bacteria possess a rudimentary immune system {{in the form of}} enzymes that protect against bacteriophage infections. Other basic immune mechanisms evolved in ancient eukaryotes and remain in their modern descendants, such as plants and invertebrates. These mechanisms include phagocytosis, antimicrobial peptides called defensins, and the complement system. Jawed vertebrates, including humans, have even more sophisticated defense mechanisms, including the ability to adapt over time to recognize specific pathogens more efficiently. Adaptive (or acquired) immunity creates immunological memory after an initial response to a specific pathogen, leading to an enhanced response to subsequent encounters <b>with</b> <b>that</b> <b>same</b> pathogen. This process of acquired immunity is the basis of vaccination.|$|E

500|$|The game {{is set in}} 1986 in fictional Vice City, {{which is}} based heavily on the city of Miami. Vice City {{previously}} appeared in the original Grand Theft Auto (1997); the development team decided to reuse the location and incorporate ideas from within the studio and the fanbase. They wanted to satirise a location that was not contemporary, unlike Grand Theft Auto IIIs Liberty City. The team wanted to choose a location that had various similarities and differences to New York City—the inspiration of Liberty City—eventually leading them to Miami, which producer Leslie Benzies describes as [...] "a party town, all sun and sea and sex, but <b>with</b> <b>that</b> <b>same</b> dark edge underneath". Sam Houser called it [...] "the grooviest era of crime because it didn't even feel like it was crime... it was a totally topsy-turvy back-to-front period of time". The team intended to make Vice City a [...] "living, breathing city", for the player to feel like [...] "life still goes on" [...] while the character is inside a building.|$|E

500|$|U2's {{delivery}} of Zooropa in late May caught PolyGram somewhat off-guard, {{because they were}} not expecting a new album by the group for several years. With Achtung Baby, PolyGram had approximately six months to market the record and plan its release strategy, but the sudden completion of Zooropa necessitated a more hurried promotional plan. PolyGram president/CEO Rick Dobbis explained: [...] "For the last one, we prepared for six months. It was like a marathon. But this is like a sprint, and that is the spirit it was made in. The band was so excited about it, they sprinted to complete the album before the ... tour. We want to bring it to the street <b>with</b> <b>that</b> <b>same</b> spirit." [...] Island/PolyGram's and U2's marketing for Zooropa was intended to focus less on singles and more on the record as a whole, and ultimately, only three singles were released, compared to Achtung Babys five singles. The first single [...] "Numb" [...] was released in June 1993 exclusively on VHS as a [...] "video single". The music video was directed by Kevin Godley. The song peaked at number seven in Australia and number nine in Canada, while reaching number two on the US Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart. However, it failed to chart on the singles charts in the UK or US.|$|E
500|$|Giveamanakick {{formed in}} 2001 {{following}} {{the demise of}} Tooth. Left with several songs, Ryan performed as a solo artist with an electric guitar. One night, he encountered Keith Lawler, who played guitar in another band at the time, and Lawler began drumming with Ryan. In 2002, the duo released a split single with Mr. Creosote titled [...] "Darko Filopovic", a song which would later feature as the final track on their debut album. By 2003, they had supported several more established acts, including Yeah Yeah Yeahs and Rocket from the Crypt. In 2003, {{there were reports that}} the duo's debut album, titled Is it ok to be loud, Jesus?, would be released on a label called Larry Gogan Records but this later emerged to be a joke published by a fledgling Foggy Notions. The duo's debut album was in fact published on 3 July 2003 <b>with</b> <b>that</b> <b>same</b> title by the independent label Out On A Limb Records as the label's first release, with Giveamanakick having finished recording it in January that year. It received two out of five stars in a review by RTÉ's Tom Grealis who wrote, [...] "this is what happens when rawness comes without any real sense of purpose". The Hot Press reviewer said listening to the album was [...] "something akin to being battered round the head with a plank of wood for half an hour" [...] but, nonetheless, [...] "bloody fantastic".|$|E
500|$|Jenijoy La Belle assesses Lady Macbeth's {{femininity}} {{and sexuality}} {{as they relate}} to motherhood as well as witchhood. The fact that she conjures spirits likens her to a witch, and the act itself establishes a similarity in the way that both Lady Macbeth and the Weird Sisters from the play [...] "use the metaphoric powers of language to call upon spiritual powers who in turn will influence physical events — in one case the workings of the state, in the other the workings of a woman's body." [...] Like the witches, Lady Macbeth strives to make herself an instrument for bringing about the future She proves herself a defiant, empowered nonconformist, and an explicit threat to a patriarchal system of governance in that, through challenging his masculinity, she manipulates Macbeth into murdering King Duncan. Despite the fact that she calls him a coward, Macbeth remains reluctant, until she asks: [...] "What beast wasn't, then, that made you break this enterprise to me? / When you durst do it, then you were a man; / And to be more than what you were, you would / Be so much more the man." [...] Thus Lady Macbeth enforces a masculine conception of power, yet only after pleading to be unsexed, or defeminised. The Weird Sisters are also depicted as defeminised, androgynous figures. They are bearded (1.3.46), (which may also be associated with Lady Macbeth's amenorrhea). Witches were perceived as an extreme type of anti-mother, even considered capable of cooking and eating their own children. Although Lady Macbeth may not express violence toward her child <b>with</b> <b>that</b> <b>same</b> degree of grotesqueness, she certainly expresses a sense of brutality when she states that she would smash the baby's head.|$|E

2500|$|A Zastava 101 (a sedan {{variant of}} the Yugo line) has been {{featured}} on the British motoring show Top Gear, where it was featured in a segment filmed in Albania, where the three presenters {{referred to it as}} a [...] "Bentley Mulsanne" [...] after Bentley decided not to allow Top Gear to use an actual Mulsanne against a Mercedes S-Class 65 and a Rolls Royce Ghost. While presenters Richard Hammond and James May drove the very new Mercedes and Rolls Royce, respectively, Clarkson was originally supposed to drive the very new Bentley- so he had to drive the Yugo. In addition to Clarkson calling the Yugo [...] "the least refined car I've ever driven", it was lambasted constantly, at one point overheated and failed to start, thoroughly physically trashed, and then driven off a cliff and destroyed while May was driving it to simulate a mock death for May after a staged police chase through Albania.

[...] But when I asked once what it was like working with Lewton, she smiled -- thought about it for a long moment -- and then told me about the night the group spent figuring out how to build to the first murder in The Leopard Man. [...] The scene she had written was pure psychological terror, trading on very basic fears -- of the dark, of being punished unjustly, locked out of your own home, abandoned by people you trust -- and at the same time it sets up the mystery that is the premise of the entire film. [...] They were under pressure to get this sequence right, and almost everyone was there that night. The session went well into the small hours of the morning, was filled with laughter, and included a hilarious riff as one of them experimented with a set of castanets, which turned out to be the key to building the tension and suspense. They worked their way through a dozen different shot sequences before they were satisfied and, listening to her, I had the very strong impression that they would have come up <b>with</b> <b>that</b> <b>same</b> elegant, powerful scene even if they had been working with an A-movie budget and had more time.
