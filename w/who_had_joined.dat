5|$|In 1945, he {{was arrested}} by Urząd Bezpieczeństwa, the Polish {{communist}} secret police. He decided to cooperate with communist authorities {{in order to protect}} former members of resistance and he called for ex-AK soldiers <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>joined</b> the anti-communist underground to lay down their arms in accordance with the amnesties of 1945 and 1947.|$|E

5|$|Some Japanese holdouts, {{especially}} on small Pacific Islands, refused to surrender at all (believing the declaration to be propaganda or considering surrender against their code). Some {{may never have}} heard of it. Teruo Nakamura, the last known holdout, emerged from his hidden retreat in Indonesia in December 1974, while two other Japanese soldiers, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>joined</b> Communist guerrillas {{at the end of}} the war, fought in southern Thailand until 1991.|$|E
5|$|That {{afternoon}} violence {{broke out}} in Martinsburg, West Virginia, between workers and militia guarding a train, prompting the governor of West Virginia {{to appeal to the}} President for aid. Strikers occupied stations at Cumberland, Maryland; Grafton, West Virginia; Keyser, West Virginia, and elsewhere, and halted the movement of freight. Newspaper reports counted 400–500 men <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>joined</b> the rail strike, and in Martinsburg, 75 trains with 1,200 rail cars sat idle.|$|E
5|$|A more {{indirect}} consequence {{arose from}} the disagreements that occurred between Madero and his generals Villa and Orozco. The tensions began during the battle and continued afterward. In addition to the insubordination that the two leaders showed Madero while the fighting was still ongoing, they also clashed with him afterwards over payments to their soldiers and over the appointment of Venustiano Carranza as Madero's defence minister. Carranza was a civilian <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>joined</b> the revolution at the last minute, and for these reasons was despised by Orozco.|$|E

5|$|During his labors {{to sustain}} the {{provisional}} government, Johnson's lack of hearing from his family weighed heavily upon him. The only family member {{with whom he had}} contact was his son Madison ("Matty"), <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>joined</b> John Hunt Morgan's cavalry. Johnson admired and respected Morgan, and was pleased that his son had chosen to serve under him. In 1862, he requested by letter that his wife send their fifteen-year-old son Junius to serve in the Confederate Army. Despite Johnson's protestations that he would ensure his son's safety, his wife refused this request.|$|E
5|$|He went {{straight}} into the first team as replacement for Frank Mitchell <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>joined</b> Chelsea earlier that month, and made his debut in a goalless draw away at Preston North End. In the 1949–50 season, his first full season with Birmingham, he established himself in the first team {{but was unable to}} prevent his new team's relegation to the Second Division. When Fred Harris retired {{at the end of that}} season, manager Bob Brocklebank appointed Boyd as his successor as club captain, a post which he retained for the remainder of his Birmingham career.|$|E

5|$|In the 1990s, OPEC {{lost its}} two newest members, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>joined</b> in the mid-1970s. Ecuador withdrew in December 1992, {{because it was}} unwilling to pay the annual US$2million {{membership}} fee and felt that it needed to produce more oil than it was allowed under the OPEC quota, although it rejoined in October 2007. Similar concerns prompted Gabon to suspend membership in January 1995; it rejoined in July 2016. Iraq has remained a member of OPEC since the organization's founding, but Iraqi production was {{not a part of}} OPEC quota agreements from 1998 to 2016, due to the country's daunting political difficulties.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{support for}} Louis' {{campaign}} was diminishing in France, and {{he concluded that}} the war in England was lost. He negotiated terms with Cardinal Guala, under which Louis would renounce his claim to the English throne; in return, his followers would be given back their lands, any sentences of excommunication would be lifted, and Henry's government would promise to enforce the charter of the previous year. The proposed agreement soon began to unravel amid claims from some loyalists that it was too generous towards the rebels, particularly the clergy <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>joined</b> the rebellion.|$|E
5|$|Shortly thereafter, on 10May 1940, when Nazi Germany {{invaded the}} Netherlands, Oerip was {{recalled}} to active service. Three days after reporting to Colonel Pik in Magelang, {{he went to}} the KNIL headquarters in Bandung, where he was the first retired officer to report. Afterwards, he and his family– <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>joined</b> him– were transferred to Cimahi, where Oerip was tasked with establishing a new battalion depot. Several native officers were stationed in northern parts of the Indies during 1941 in preparation for an expected attack by the Empire of Japan, although Oerip stayed in Cimahi.|$|E

5|$|The magazine's {{publisher}} and editor-in-chief, S. S. McClure, assigned five writers {{to work on}} the articles: Willa Cather, winner of the 1923 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>joined</b> McClure's as an editor in 1906; Georgine Milmine, a freelance reporter who originally brought some of the research to McClure's; Will Irwin, McClure's managing editor; Burton J.

While none of the identities of the people who appeared in the picture are recorded, it is known the women in the film were played by men in drag, rendering them sexually unattractive.|$|E

5|$|An {{estimated}} 10,000 people met the Birmingham City {{party on}} {{their return to}} Snow Hill station.
