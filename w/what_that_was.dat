500|$|The central {{argument}} in the letter is that the British have negated {{the rights of the}} Irish people by relying on a completely British system to pass the patent without allowing the Irish Parliament a say. William Wood, according to the Drapier, was already involved in a similar dispute with a coin he minted for Massachusetts. Wood, the Drapier claims, [...] "hath already tried his Faculty in New-England, and I hope he will meet with an EQUAL RECEPTION here; <b>what</b> <b>That</b> <b>was</b> I leave to the Publick Intelligence." [...] The response to Wood's coin was a complete boycott of the coin.|$|E
500|$|Gangsta rap {{has been}} criticized for its extreme lyrics, which are often accused of glamorizing gang {{violence}} and black-on-black crime. The Gangsta rappers responded that they were simply describing the realities of life in places such as Compton, California, and Long Beach, California. Describing Doggystyle in 1993, Snoop Doggy Dogg likewise points to the album's realism, {{and the extent to which}} it is based on his personal experience. [...] He said, [...] "I can't rap about something I don't know. You'll never hear me rapping about no bachelor's degree. It's only what I know and that's that street life. It's all everyday life, reality." [...] Explaining his intentions, Snoop Doggy Dogg claims he feels he is a role model to many young black men, and that his songs are designed to relate to their concerns. [...] "For little kids growing up in the ghettos," [...] he said, [...] "it's easy to get into the wrong types of things, especially gangbanging and selling drugs. I've seen <b>what</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> like, and I don't glorify it, but I don't preach. I bring it to them rather than have them go find out about it for themselves." [...] He further explained the [...] "dream" [...] that he would pursue after making the album: [...] "I'm going to try to eliminate the gang violence. I'll be on a mission for peace. I know I have a lot of power. I know if I say, 'Don't kill', niggas won't kill".|$|E
2500|$|One of the marvellous {{things about}} John Bonham which made things very easy [...] {{was the fact}} that he really knew how to tune his drums, and I tell you <b>what,</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> pretty rare in drummers in those days. He really knew how to make the {{instrument}} sing, and because of that, he could just get so much volume out of it by just playing with his wrists. It was just an astonishing technique that was sort of pretty holistic if you know what I mean.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the age of}} 15, Eggleston {{was sent}} to the Webb School, a {{boarding}} establishment. Eggleston later recalled few fond memories of the school, telling a reporter, [...] "It had a kind of Spartan routine to 'build character'. I never knew <b>what</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> supposed to mean. It was so callous and dumb. It was {{the kind of place where}} it was considered effeminate to like music and painting." [...] Eggleston was unusual among his peers in eschewing the traditional Southern male pursuits of hunting and sports, in favor of artistic pursuits and observation of the world. Nevertheless, Eggleston noted that he never felt like an outsider. [...] "I never had the feeling that I didn't fit in," [...] he told a reporter, [...] "But probably I didn't." ...|$|E
2500|$|The album {{features}} {{a variety of}} different musical styles in its tracks. As a testament to the amount of time of production, each song [...] "sounds different from the next," [...] according to Urie. In the beginning, the band had no direction for music or lyrics. However, after returning to the studio and restarting production, the band became excited to start [...] with a second chance. [...] "We've been working on music for {{about a year and a}} half, so I think that partly adds to why some of the songs have some varying styles," [...] Smith said. [...] "Part of it was us, at the beginning, trying to figure out what we wanted to do – we had a new opportunity with just the two of us – and as we sort of got a better hold on <b>what</b> <b>that</b> <b>was,</b> just kind of went from there." [...] The duo picked the best songs out of 30 written as time went on. Urie said the most exciting part of the recording process was [...] "...You get all the work done, record the song, arrange it and then you can add the fun little stuff, little pieces of voices and talking and weird instruments you hadn’t used before." [...] The band's musical experimentation stretched as far as employing an iPad to record synthesizers on the record. The band got to work with French band The Plastiscines, and a children's choir on the track [...] "Nearly Witches (Ever Since We Met...)" ...|$|E
2500|$|On May 9, 1887, Buffalo Bill's Wild West {{opened in}} London. Among the {{audience}} members was Queen Victoria, {{who visited the}} Earl's Court encampment three days later. [...] Black Elk recalled that Natives were told [...] "that Majesty was coming. I did not know <b>what</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> at first, but I learned afterward. It was Grandmother England who owned Grandmother's Land where we lived awhile after the Wasichus murdered Crazy Horse." [...] Red Shirt expressed his pleasure in meeting the Queen and remarked to her that [...] "I have come many thousands of miles to see you. Now that I have seen you, my heart is glad." [...] The encounter and his words were widely circulated among the press and noted in her diary. Since the death of Prince Albert, her husband, which event had occurred thirty years previous to this [...] "command," [...] the queen {{had been more than}} ordinarily seclusive. She seldom appeared before great assemblages of her subjects and her visits to even her parliament were rare. To theatrical performances she never went during that long period of her mourning. Her latest knowledge of the greatest actors and actresses of the time was gained by private performances given, by command, in her court, and these were infrequent. [...] "The Wild West was altogether too big a thing to take to Windsor Castle, and {{as in the case of}} Mahomet and the mountain, as the Wild West could not go to the Queen it became absolutely necessary for the Queen to go to the Wild West, if she desired to see it, and it was evident that she did." [...] "Then I presented Red Shirt, the Native Chieftain, who was gorgeous in war paint and feather trappings. His proud bearing was fetching among the royal party, and when he spoke through an interpreter, saying he had come a long way to see her Majesty and [...] "felt glad," [...] the Queen smiled appreciatively, and as the red man, unconventionally, but proudly, strolled away with the dignity of a Supreme Court Judge, she seemed to say, [...] "I know a real prince when I see him." [...] "Every act went with a rush and a cheer, and was received by cries of 'bravo,' 'well done,' etc. At the close of the exhibition calls were made for Red Shirt and myself, in response to which I thanked my patrons and assured them that the recollection of that evening's display of kindness would ever be fresh in my memory. Cries of 'Bravo, Bill,' and the singing of 'For he's a jolly good fellow' by the entire audience brought the demonstration to a close." ...|$|E

In the {{preceding}} Book, {{we have been}} occupied not {{with the nature of}} Proof, but with the nature of Assertion: the import conveyed by a Proposition, whether <b>that</b> Proposition <b>be</b> true or false; not the means by which to discriminate true from false Propositions. The proper subject, however, of Logic is Proof. Before we could understand what Proof is, it was necessary to understand <b>what</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> to which proof <b>is</b> applicable; <b>what</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> which can be a subject of belief or disbelief, of affirmation or denial; what, in short, the different kinds of Propositions assert.|$|R
