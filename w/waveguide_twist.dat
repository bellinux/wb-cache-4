40|$|Here, {{we present}} a compact {{component}} for waveguide systems and horn antennas, enabling both filtering and polarization rotation capabilities. In particular, the proposed module consists of an electrically thin-chiral particle, which is first used to design a <b>waveguide</b> <b>twist</b> to connect two waveguide sections mutually rotated by 90 °. We show that around the resonant frequency of the particle, good transmission efficiency between the two mutually orthogonal waveguides is achieved. Then, the same module is inserted at the throat of a vertically polarized horn antenna to rotate its polarization plane and narrow its matching bandwidth. The result is a filtering horn antenna that, within the operating bandwidth of the particle, efficiently radiates a horizontally polarized field.

40|$|Abstract—It is {{well-known}} that the finite-difference time-do-main (FDTD) method {{is subject to}} significant errors due to the staircasing of surfaces that are not precisely aligned with major grid planes. Dey and Mittra introduced a locally conformal method (D-FDTD) that has shown substantial gains in the accu-racy of modeling arbitrary surfaces in the FDTD grid. A mesh generator for this purpose was reported by Yu and Mittra. In this paper, we present the formulation and validation of an alternative CAD-based mesh generator for D-FDTD that has improved capabilities for arbitrary three-dimensional (3 -D) perfect electric conductor (PEC) geometries. This mesh generator is capable of importing AutoCad and ProE files of 3 -D PEC scatterers and resonators. It can reduce the required FDTD grid resolution by up to 4 : 1 in each Cartesian direction in 3 -D relative to conventional staircased FDTD models when modeling cavity resonances of complex PEC structures such as <b>twisted</b> <b>waveguides.</b> Index Terms—Conformal method, finite-difference time-domain (FDTD), mesh generation.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the quantum mechanics {{of a single}} particle constrained to move along an arbitrary smooth reference curve by a confinement that is allowed to vary along the waveguide. The Schrödinger equation is evaluated in the adapted coordinate frame and a transverse mode decomposition is performed, taking into account both curvature and torsion effects {{and the possibility of}} a cross-section potential that changes along the curve in an arbitrary way. We discuss the adiabatic structure of the problem, and examine nonadiabatic couplings that arise due to the curved geometry, the varying transverse profile and their interplay. The exact multi-mode matrix Hamiltonian is taken as the natural starting point for few-mode approximations. Such approximate equations are provided, and it is worked out how these recover known results for <b>twisting</b> <b>waveguides</b> and can be applied to other types of waveguide designs. The quantum waveguide Hamiltonian is recast into a form that clearly illustrates how it generalizes the Born-Oppenheimer Hamiltonian encountered in molecular physics. In analogy to the latter, we explore the local gauge structure inherent to the quantum waveguide problem and suggest the usefulness of diabatic states, giving an explicit construction of the adiabatic-to-diabatic basis transformation.

40|$|We {{consider}} the <b>twisted</b> <b>waveguide</b> Ω_θ, i. e. the domain {{obtained by the}} rotation of the bounded cross section ω⊂ R^ 2 of the straight tube Ω : = ω× R at angle θ which depends on the variable along the axis of Ω. We study the spectral properties of the Dirichlet Laplacian in Ω_θ, unitarily equivalent under the diffeomorphism Ω_θ→Ω to the operator H_θ', self-adjoint in L^ 2 (Ω). We assume that θ' = β - ϵ where β is a 2 π-periodic function, and ϵ decays at infinity. Then in the spectrum σ(H_β) of the unperturbed operator H_β there is a semi-bounded gap (-∞, E_ 0 ^+), and, possibly, a number of bounded open gaps (E_j^-, E_j^+). Since ϵ decays at infinity, the essential spectra of H_β and H_β - ϵ coincide. We investigate the asymptotic behaviour of the discrete spectrum of H_β - ϵ near an arbitrary fixed spectral edge E_j^±. We establish necessary and quite close sufficient conditions which guarantee the finiteness of σ_ disc(H_β-ϵ) in a neighbourhood of E_j^±. In the case where the necessary conditions are violated, we obtain the main asymptotic term of the corresponding eigenvalue counting function. The effective Hamiltonian which governs the the asymptotics of σ_ disc(H_β-ϵ) near E_j^± could be represented as a finite orthogonal sum of operators of the form -μd^ 2 /dx^ 2 - ηϵ, self-adjoint in L^ 2 (R); here, μ > 0 is a constant related to the so-called effective mass, while η is 2 π-periodic function depending on β and ω.

40|$|In this thesis, which {{consists}} of four papers, we study the discrete spectrum of Schrödinger operators in waveguides. In these domains the quadratic form of the Dirichlet Laplacian operator does not satisfy any Hardy inequality. If we include an attractive electric potential in the model or curve the domain, then bound states will always occur with energy below {{the bottom of the}} essential spectrum. We prove that a magnetic field stabilises the threshold of the essential spectrum against small perturbations. We deduce this fact from a magnetic Hardy inequality, which has many interesting applications in itself. In Paper I we prove the magnetic Hardy inequality in a two-dimensional waveguide. As an application, we establish that when a magnetic field is present, a small local deformation or a small local bending of the waveguide will not create bound states below the essential spectrum. In Paper II we study the Dirichlet Laplacian operator in a three-dimensional waveguide, whose cross-section is not rotationally invariant. We prove that if the <b>waveguide</b> is locally <b>twisted,</b> then the lower edge of the spectrum becomes stable. We deduce this from a Hardy inequality. In Paper III we consider the magnetic Schrödinger operator in a three-dimensional waveguide with circular cross-section. If we include an attractive potential, eigenvalues may occur below the bottom of the essential spectrum. We prove a magnetic Lieb-Thirring inequality for these eigenvalues. In the same paper we give a lower bound on the ground state of the magnetic Schrödinger operator in a disc. This lower bound is used to prove a Hardy inequality for the magnetic Schrödinger operator in the original waveguide setting. In Paper IV we again study the two-dimensional waveguide. It is known that if the boundary condition is changed locally from Dirichlet to magnetic Neumann, then without a magnetic field bound states will occur with energies below the essential spectrum. We however prove that {{in the presence of a}} magnetic field, there is a critical minimal length of the magnetic Neumann boundary condition above which the system exhibits bound states below the threshold of the essential spectrum. We also give explicit bounds on the critical length from above and below. QC 2010100...|$|R
