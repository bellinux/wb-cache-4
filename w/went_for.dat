The remainder supported industrial and agricultural applications. Global installed capacity was 28GW, but capacity factors tend to be low (30% on average) since heat is mostly needed in winter. Some 88PJ for space heating was extracted by an estimated 1.3million geothermal heat pumps with a total capacity of 15 GW.|$|E

5|$|Built by {{construction}} firm Turner Construction Company, the US$165 million Murano {{was completed}} in 2008 with residents first moving in on June 18. The building was completed with seventy percent of its units sold. As of December 31, 2008, sales on 111 units had been closed and an additional 14 units were under contract of sale. In 2008 and 2009 the late-2000s recession hurt the condominium market, with citywide sales declining 64 percent and high-end condo sales declining 24 percent. Analysts believed the Murano was overpriced based on the neighborhood, with potential buyers unwilling {{to take a chance}} on the developing West Market Street neighborhood during a recession. In 2009, Thomas Properties Group was looking to quickly fill up the tower to help pay for condo fees and maintenance costs. On June 27, Thomas Properties Group auctioned off 40 units in the tower. The 40 units <b>went</b> <b>for</b> between US$335,000 and US$796,000, priced at nearly 20 percent less than the units sold before the auction. Thomas Properties Group priced the 137 remaining unsold units according to what similar units <b>went</b> <b>for</b> during the auction.|$|E

Scott Morton returned to compose new tracks. The concept was to both expand upon the narrative of Titan Quest and improve the gameplay experience. It also <b>went</b> <b>for</b> a darker aesthetic compared to the original. Announced in November 2006, it released to a positive critical reception and favorable sales.|$|E

5|$|Historians {{debate whether}} Washington {{preferred}} to fight major battles or to utilize a Fabian strategy to harass the British with quick, sharp attacks {{followed by a}} retreat so that the larger British army could not catch him. His southern commander Greene did use Fabian tactics in 1780–81; Washington did so only in fall 1776 to spring 1777, after losing New York City and seeing much of his army melt away. Trenton and Princeton were Fabian examples. By summer 1777 Washington had rebuilt his strength and his confidence; he stopped using raids and <b>went</b> <b>for</b> large-scale confrontations, as at Brandywine, Germantown, Monmouth, and Yorktown.|$|E
