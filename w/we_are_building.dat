The veto was proposed by the People's Party, which held {{the majority of the}} seats, and by the Democratic Union of Catalonia, and was approved by 131 [...] "yes" [...] and 119 [...] "no" [...] votes and 2 abstentions. As a result, the text was sent back to the Congress. On 30 June 2005, it was approved by Congress, which, in accordance with the constitutional provisions, overrode the Senate veto. This was achieved with 187 [...] "yes" [...] votes (including a member of the People's Party, Celia Villalobos), 147 [...] "no" [...] votes, and four abstentions. The veto override implied its approval as law. The vote was held after Zapatero unexpectedly took the floor of Parliament to speak in its support, saying We are expanding the opportunities for happiness of our neighbors, our colleagues, our friends and our relatives. At the same time, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>building</b> a more decent society. Mariano Rajoy, the leader of the opposition People's Party, was denied the opportunity to address Parliament after Zapatero's appearance, and accused Zapatero of dividing Spanish society.|$|E

That before about A.D. 180 there is no trace of FOUR gospels among the Christians....As it is not pretended by any {{that there is any}} mention of four Gospels before the time of Irenaeus, excepting this [...] "harmony". pleaded by some as dated about A.D. 170 and by others as between 170 and 180, it would be sheer waste of time and space to prove further a point admitted on all hands. This step of our argument is, then on solid and unassailable ground —That before about A.D. 180 there is no trace of FOUR gospels among the Christians. (E.) That, before that date, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, are not selected as the four evangelists. This position necessarily follows from the preceding one , since four evangelists could not be selected until four Gospels were recognised. Here, again, Dr. Giles supports the argument <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>building</b> up. He says: [...] "Justin Martyr never once mentions by name the evangelists Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.

By having design knowledge represented by many fine-grained agents <b>we</b> <b>are</b> able to realize this goal. The goal was originally conceived by the realization that many conflicts in the multi-agent design systems, and design support systems, that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>building</b> <b>were</b> “internal ” to an agent. In addition, many of the conflicts were being compiled out at system-building time [3].
