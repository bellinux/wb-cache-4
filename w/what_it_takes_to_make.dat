She later admitted that the couple were naive about <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a successful fashion enterprise. Edun encountered problems with both quality of goods and delivery times from their African suppliers, and most of the stores originally carrying the line dropped it. It lost €9.7 million in 2007 and €12.8 million in 2008, suffering {{along with the rest of}} the apparel sector from the credit crisis of 2008.|$|E
500|$|The {{scene in}} which O'Malley's colleagues were {{laughing}} at his funeral was one of Vernoff's favorite scenes. She added: [...] "Shonda gave me smart notes that enhanced the writing and then the wonderful director Ed Ornelas and the amazing DP Herb Davis and the whole crew that support them made it visually beautiful and then the actors… damn, did they all bring their A game to this scene. And {{then there are the}} editors and music folks and the people who color correct everything and mix the sound… It's a collaboration. <b>What</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> good TV is a huge coming together of a great many artists. <b>What</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> great TV is all that plus a little magic and a little luck. And that’s what I feel like we had with this scene. It's so funny and so bittersweet and so, so sad." ...|$|E

Page {{said he hoped}} the exhibit would {{educate the public about}} a different facet to filmmaking, [...] "The general public tends to associate films with actors versus people who conceive and design and make the films. What is on display is one small facet of <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a movie, one of the many gears involved in the mechanism, neither more important nor less ... simply as important." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{video was}} shot on May 30, 2008 in Los Angeles, California. Unexpectedly, several girls began crying during the shoot; Cyrus {{attributed}} {{this to the}} emotions in the song. Ratner was impressed with Cyrus' instinct and ability to address emotional issues while making them [...] "fun at the same time". Ratner compared her to Madonna, saying, [...] "she can be hanging out and laughing, and then you put the camera on her and it's like, 'Holy shit!'" [...] The effervescence made editing {{more difficult for the}} director. He said, [...] "It was the hardest video I've ever edited because every moment was great. Every moment that she was on camera, she was amazing. She's got an incredible quality about her. She gets the camera, and that's <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a great music video." [...] Cyrus commented that she felt the video was [...] "more honest than [...] song" [...] and that she was [...] "singing out to [...] that special person".|$|E
500|$|Talk of a {{potential}} sequel to The Terminator arose soon after its release, but several outstanding issues precluded such a production. There were technical limitations regarding computer-generated imagery, a vital aspect of the film that would be crucial {{in the creation of}} the T-1000 Terminator. The production of James Cameron's 1989 film The Abyss provided the proof of concept needed to satisfactorily resolve the technical concerns. Perhaps more serious were the intellectual-property disputes between Hemdale Film Corporation, which owned the franchise and stymied efforts to produce a sequel, and Carolco Pictures. Given that Hemdale was then experiencing financial problems, Arnold Schwarzenegger urged Mario Kassar, head of Carolco, to bid for the rights: [...] "I reminded Mario that this is something that we've been looking for four years, and that it should be him that should go all-out, no matter <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> this deal." [...] Carolco eventually paid Hemdale $5million for the franchise in 1990, resolving the legal gridlock.|$|E
500|$|... "All Mixed Up" [...] {{was well}} {{received}} by television critics. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club issued the episode a B+ grade, {{and felt that}} the episode was superior {{to those of the}} show's first season. He asserted: [...] "Cougar Town hasn't taken as big of a step up from season one to season two as it did from the first part of season one to the last part of season one. But the step from 'average' to 'good' was the easy part. Season two is the season where viewers are going {{to find out if the}} show has <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the small steps needed to get from 'good' to 'great'. There's every indication that it's on the way there in the premiere because it's finally started to wrestle with some of the knottier questions at its center." [...] HitFix writer Alan Sepinwall opined that the show averted from its original premise; [...] "It's become one of my favorite comedies, and whether you care about Aniston or not, tonight is a good time to sample it if you dismissed it last year because of the title, the original premise or some of those early episodes." ...|$|E

500|$|Rocks and Honey has {{received}} mixed reviews from critics since its release. Dirk Neuhaus of Country Rock Magazine published a favourable {{review of the}} album, crediting David Huff and Matt Davis for the album production and called [...] "What You Need From Me" [...] a [...] "fantastic track." [...] Norbert Schiegel of G+J Entertainment Media highlighted the tracks [...] "Sunshine" [...] as a [...] "pleasantly catchy" [...] song, and [...] "What You Need From Me" [...] as [...] "sensational." [...] He described the whole album as [...] "outstanding." [...] Jeremy Williams of The Yorkshire Times gave the album a 5/5 rating. He asks, [...] "has the gritty vocal of Bonnie Tyler still got <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> you tingle? The simple answer is YES," [...] and marks the album as an [...] "impressive return to her country roots". He also questions that the track [...] "Little Superstar" [...] was not chosen for the UK's Eurovision song over [...] "Believe in Me". Similarly, Music-News' Andy Snipper suggested that the track [...] "Mom" [...] {{would have been better}} suited as the Eurovision song, though describes Rocks and Honey as [...] "a fine album." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{a review}} of Rocks and Honey, OMH Media {{described}} Tyler's vocals as being [...] "good for only one thing and that's belting out gravelly vocals", suggesting that she sounds like Johnny Cash {{in his later years}} when she [...] "tries to restrain [...] ". With reference to her modern voice, The Yorkshire Times wrote that Tyler's vocals have [...] "still got <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> you tingle." [...] Jim Steinman told People magazine that he wrote [...] "Total Eclipse of the Heart" [...] as a [...] "showpiece for [...] voice". AllMusic said that Tyler's voice [...] "produced the perfect type of 'desperate lovelorn' effect to suit the romantic lyrics".|$|E

Today, as an advocate for the hungry and the hunted, the forgotten and the ignored, Mary Robinson has not only shone a light on human suffering, but illuminated a better future for our world." ...|$|E

I'm quite happy; and I hope you are, too. Where are you living now? I shall call soon, and have a long gossip with you. I always had a sort of liking for you, and (now I'm as good as you are) I want to be friends." ...|$|E
