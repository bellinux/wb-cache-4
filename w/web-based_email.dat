40|$|In the 21 st century, {{there has}} been a {{significant}} rise in dependency on the Internet for daily activities. Web applications such as online banking, <b>web-based</b> <b>emails,</b> social networking, and many more services have become an instant means of communication. These web applications and the data to which they have access are often targeted using malicious attacks, including SQL (Structured Query Language) Injection Attacks (from now on referenced as SQLIAs), which may cause serious damage. In particular, attackers use SQLIAs to target interactive web applications that incorporate database services. In a SQLIA, an attacker can insert malicious SQL code as an input to perform unauthorized database operations, which could potentially jeopardize the privacy, integrity and security of the users. This thesis proposes an unconventional hardware-based approach for solving SQL vulnerabilities and thwarting SQLIAs. Specifically, we are approaching the problem of SQL Injection by using an FPGA to search for action-based binding keywords which join multiple queries. These keywords form an integral part of any attack query. We search for these keywords in a user’s input space and replace them with a null string. By doing so, the binding query is nullified, and the attacking query is rendered harmless...|$|R

The {{purpose of this}} ongoing project {{is to determine the}} usability of a private key infrastructure (PKI) email security system among clinicians at small family practices. The original security intervention involved the clinician's regular machine-based email programs, however, early problems resulted mainly from the lack of standardization among computer systems.

Support is found for email use according to information richness theory, as the dominant use of email was information dissemination. However, email was also used for tasks not typical for lean communication media, e. g., the expression of emotions. Still more striking is the strong impact of social behaviour and expectations as a precondition for the actual use of email. Although the strategic network is built up around a <b>web-based</b> platform, <b>email</b> is only marginally used for {{communication in}} the network as an effect of low coherence in the network and limited computer experience. ...|$|R

40|$|High-performance work systems (HPWS) are {{designed}} to improve the effectiveness and productivity of employees. In addition, the utilization of this system can reduce costs for the organization, while still creating value for employees. Organizations benefit from creating human resource (HR) systems that increase value to all stakeholders. Factors of HPWS investigated are organizational identity, job engagement, employee creativity, employee voice, and employee proactive behavior. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the relationship between HPWS, organizational identity, job engagement, creativity, and employee voice and its impact on employees and organizational performance. The researcher applied quantitative research questions; the data was gathered from <b>web-based</b> surveys <b>emailed</b> to 450 employees which 319 surveys questionnaires were returned. Subsequently, random selection of fully completed surveys was selected to be analyzed. The study establishes the existence of correlations between high performance work systems, organizational identity, employee creativity, and employee proactive behavior. This shows that application of HPWS would enhance employee productivity and organizational performance...|$|R

50|$|Email is {{a widely}} used {{communication}} mechanism that can be categorized into two basic types of web-based service: open and closed. Open <b>web-based</b> services provide <b>email</b> accounts to anyone, either for free or for a fee. Closed web-based services are managed by organizations who provide email accounts only to their members. Email is used by commercial and social websites because of its security. Email is an increasingly common tool used to communicate.

40|$|Teledermatology, {{originating}} in 1995, {{has been one}} of the first telemedicine services to see the light of day. Two decades of teledermatology research is summarized in this review. A literature search was conducted in PubMed. Search terms included "teledermatology," "teledermoscopy," "tele wound care," "telederm*," "(dermatology OR dermoscopy OR wound care OR skin) AND (telemedicine OR ehealth or mhealth OR telecare OR teledermatology OR teledermoscopy). " Inclusion criteria were (i) Dutch or English written papers and (ii) publication year from 2011 to present or (iii) (systematic) reviews with publication year before 2011. One hundred fourteen publications and 14 (systematic) reviews were included for full text reading. Focus of this review is on the following outcomes: (i) actors (primary, secondary, tertiary), (ii) purposes (consultation, triage, follow-up, education) and subspecialties (tele-wound care, burn care, teledermoscopy (teledermatoscopy), teledermatopathology, and mobile teledermatology), (iii) delivery modalities and technologies (store and forward, real-time interactive, and hybrid modalities using <b>web-based</b> systems, <b>email,</b> mobile phones, tablets, or videoconferencing equipment), (iv) business models, (v) integration of teledermatology into national healthcare systems, (vi) preconditions and requirements for implementation (security, ethical issues, responsibility, reimbursement, user satisfaction, technique, and technology standards), and (vii) added value. To conclude, teledermatology is an efficient and effective healthcare service compared to in-person care. Teledermatology reduces patients' travel time and waiting time, avoids (unnecessary) dermatologic visits, and improves access of care to underserved patient...|$|R

40|$|Background: Despite growing social acceptance, the LGBTQ {{population}} {{continues to}} face barriers to healthcare including fear of stigmatization by healthcare providers, and providers’ {{lack of knowledge}} about LGBTQ-specific health issues. This analysis focuses on the assessment of quantitative and qualitative responses from a subset of providers who identified as specialists that treat {{one or more of the}} seven cancers that may be disproportionate in LGBTQ patients. Methods: A 32 -item <b>web-based</b> survey was <b>emailed</b> to 388 oncology providers at a single institution. The survey assessed: demographics, knowledge, attitudes, and practice behaviors. Results: Oncology providers specializing in seven cancer types had poor knowledge of LGBTQ-specific health needs, with fewer than half of the surveyed providers (49. 5 %) correctly answering knowledge questions. Most providers had overall positive attitudes toward LGBTQ patients, with 91. 7 % agreeing they would be comfortable treating this population, and would support education and/or training on LGBTQ-related cancer health issues. Conclusion: Results suggest that despite generally positive attitudes toward the LGBTQ population, oncology providers who treat cancer types most prevalent among the population, lack knowledge of their unique health issues. Knowledge and practice behaviors may improve with enhanced education and training on this population’s specific needs...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with a research programme on automation and computer integrated manufacturing (CIM) in food processing industry, culminating in an implementation framework detailing the extent of automation and application of computer based technologies in Irish food processing industries. This work involved with designing of a postal survey questionnaire and mailing it to 221 manufacturing companies, and designing a <b>web-based</b> survey and <b>emailing</b> it to 31 manufacturing companies in the Republic of Ireland. Questions were designed to capture information {{about the level of}} automation, envisaged level of automation, motivation and obstacles to implement computer-based technology, and the extent of implementation of CIM environments at plants. The key findings point to the existence of a linear relationship between practice and performance. From the perspective of competitive advantage, the traditional postal survey gives a higher response rate than web-based survey, {{but on the other hand}} the web based survey takes shorter response time and cost s less than a traditional postal survey. The results of this study show variable levels of automation. A large number of the manufacturing plants are applying automation, and are trying to increase the automation level m their plants.
