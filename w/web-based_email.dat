40|$|In the 21 st century, {{there has}} been a {{significant}} rise in dependency on the Internet for daily activities. Web applications such as online banking, <b>web-based</b> <b>emails,</b> social networking, and many more services have become an instant means of communication. These web applications and the data to which they have access are often targeted using malicious attacks, including SQL (Structured Query Language) Injection Attacks (from now on referenced as SQLIAs), which may cause serious damage. In particular, attackers use SQLIAs to target interactive web applications that incorporate database services. In a SQLIA, an attacker can insert malicious SQL code as an input to perform unauthorized database operations, which could potentially jeopardize the privacy, integrity and security of the users. This thesis proposes an unconventional hardware-based approach for solving SQL vulnerabilities and thwarting SQLIAs. Specifically, we are approaching the problem of SQL Injection by using an FPGA to search for action-based binding keywords which join multiple queries. These keywords form an integral part of any attack query. We search for these keywords in a userâ€™s input space and replace them with a null string. By doing so, the binding query is nullified, and the attacking query is rendered harmless...|$|R

Support is found for email use according to information richness theory, as the dominant use of email was information dissemination. However, email was also used for tasks not typical for lean communication media, e. g., the expression of emotions. Still more striking is the strong impact of social behaviour and expectations as a precondition for the actual use of email. Although the strategic network is built up around a <b>web-based</b> platform, <b>email</b> is only marginally used for {{communication in}} the network as an effect of low coherence in the network and limited computer experience. ...|$|R

50|$|Email is {{a widely}} used {{communication}} mechanism that can be categorized into two basic types of web-based service: open and closed. Open <b>web-based</b> services provide <b>email</b> accounts to anyone, either for free or for a fee. Closed web-based services are managed by organizations who provide email accounts only to their members. Email is used by commercial and social websites because of its security. Email is an increasingly common tool used to communicate.

Search terms included "teledermatology," "teledermoscopy," "tele wound care," "telederm*," "(dermatology OR dermoscopy OR wound care OR skin) AND (telemedicine OR ehealth or mhealth OR telecare OR teledermatology OR teledermoscopy). " Inclusion criteria were (i) Dutch or English written papers and (ii) publication year from 2011 to present or (iii) (systematic) reviews with publication year before 2011. One hundred fourteen publications and 14 (systematic) reviews were included for full text reading. Focus of this review is on the following outcomes: (i) actors (primary, secondary, tertiary), (ii) purposes (consultation, triage, follow-up, education) and subspecialties (tele-wound care, burn care, teledermoscopy (teledermatoscopy), teledermatopathology, and mobile teledermatology), (iii) delivery modalities and technologies (store and forward, real-time interactive, and hybrid modalities using <b>web-based</b> systems, <b>email,</b> mobile phones, tablets, or videoconferencing equipment), (iv) business models, (v) integration of teledermatology into national healthcare systems, (vi) preconditions and requirements for implementation (security, ethical issues, responsibility, reimbursement, user satisfaction, technique, and technology standards), and (vii) added value. To conclude, teledermatology is an efficient and effective healthcare service compared to in-person care.

40|$|Background: Despite growing social acceptance, the LGBTQ {{population}} {{continues to}} face barriers to healthcare including fear of stigmatization by healthcare providers, and providersâ€™ {{lack of knowledge}} about LGBTQ-specific health issues. This analysis focuses on the assessment of quantitative and qualitative responses from a subset of providers who identified as specialists that treat {{one or more of the}} seven cancers that may be disproportionate in LGBTQ patients. Methods: A 32 -item <b>web-based</b> survey was <b>emailed</b> to 388 oncology providers at a single institution. The survey assessed: demographics, knowledge, attitudes, and practice behaviors. Results: Oncology providers specializing in seven cancer types had poor knowledge of LGBTQ-specific health needs, with fewer than half of the surveyed providers (49. 5 %) correctly answering knowledge questions. Most providers had overall positive attitudes toward LGBTQ patients, with 91. 7 % agreeing they would be comfortable treating this population, and would support education and/or training on LGBTQ-related cancer health issues. Conclusion: Results suggest that despite generally positive attitudes toward the LGBTQ population, oncology providers who treat cancer types most prevalent among the population, lack knowledge of their unique health issues. Knowledge and practice behaviors may improve with enhanced education and training on this populationâ€™s specific needs...|$|R
