5|$|At first, Napoleon was {{not totally}} {{confident}} of victory. In {{a letter written}} to Minister of Foreign Affairs Talleyrand, Napoleon requested Talleyrand not tell anyone about the upcoming battle {{because he did not}} want to disturb Empress Joséphine.

5|$|Manga and anime {{publications}} have {{commented on}} Kira's character, and he received mainly positive critical responses. IGN's Andy Patrizio said Kira's character was likable {{and the only}} problem he found <b>was</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> often repeated Athrun Zala's name in early episodes. THEM Anime Reviews' Derrick L. Tucker said {{he was one of}} the strongest characters from the series; Tucker also said he was likable despite his angsty displays. Tucker also compared him with Amuro Ray from the first Gundam series, Mobile Suit Gundam, finding both likeable. Chris Beveridge from Mania Entertainment liked Kira's handling of the mobile suits and his ability to reprogram them, finding it as a new concept in the Gundam franchise.|$|E

5|$|This <b>was</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> {{personally}} designed {{many of the}} Sagrada Família's sculptures. He would thoroughly {{study the}} anatomy of the figure, concentrating on gestures. For this purpose, he studied the human skeleton and sometimes used dummies made of wire to test the appropriate posture of the figure {{he was about to}} sculpt. In a second step, he photographed his models, using a mirror system that provided multiple perspectives. He then made plaster casts of the figures, both of people and animals (on one occasion he made a donkey stand up so it would not move). He modified the proportions of these casts to obtain the figure's desired appearance, depending on its place in the church (the higher up, the bigger it would be). Eventually, he sculpted the figures in stone.|$|E

It should be mentioned that it was not precedent to Ardashir to take a royal ring from Ahura Mazda, and it is not seen even in Achaemenid inscriptions.|$|E

500|$|Deakins {{described}} {{the look of}} the fantasy scenes as being very crisp, monochromatic, and highly lit in order to afford greater depth of focus. However, with the Dude's apartment, Deakins said, [...] "it's kind of seedy and the light's pretty nasty" [...] with a grittier look. The visual bridge between these two different looks <b>was</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> photographed the night scenes. Instead of adopting the usual blue moonlight or blue street lamp look, he used an orange sodium-light effect. The Coen brothers shot a lot of the film with wide-angle lens because, according to Joel, it made it easier to hold focus for a greater depth and it made camera movements more dynamic.|$|E
500|$|Whithouse {{preferred}} the cyborg villain to be three-dimensional and sympathetic, {{which would require}} it to have a [...] "living consciousness" [...] rather than simply be a [...] "soulless automaton". He wanted its look to be reminiscent of Frankenstein's monster, and later called the design [...] "fantastic". It took about {{three and a half}} hours for Andrew Brooke to have all the make-up applied. Due to the costume, Brooke had to act with just his left eye. Smith had praise for guest actors Ben Browder, who he said [...] " [...] a good cowboy" [...] with [...] "that great drawl", and Adrian Scarborough, who he said [...] "steals the whole episode". Browder was offered the role and gladly accepted; he was aware of the show as his children had watched it, and he also wanted to do a western. Whithouse was [...] "thrilled" [...] with Browder's performance, as it <b>was</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> imagined the character.|$|E

500|$|On March 31, 2015, Billboard premiered a remix of {{the song}} by Dutch DJ Don Diablo, who changed the ballad into an EDM track. Another set of remixes were {{released}} later as a Remix EP. Two of the remixes were released on Madonna's Tidal streaming account, including one by DJ RedTop as well as Armand Van Helden, Offer Nissim and Roger Sanchez. According to Idolator, [...] "RedTop completely deconstructs 'Ghosttown' and turns it into something you might hear in a post-apocalyptic piano bar. It's sad and depressing yet defiantly groovy." [...] Another remix, by Paul Andrews, gave emphasis on Madonna's vocals while adding piano and orchestra in the production. Andrews explained that the music video of [...] "Ghosttown" [...] <b>was</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> had imagined it, [...] "two people in a dark place with destruction all around them, but they have each other". Hence he wanted the verse to represent {{the reality of the}} situation and the chorus would represent their view of the world because of their love. The non-dance remix was approved by Madonna and was another exclusive release to her Tidal account.|$|E
500|$|Cross {{wanted to}} write [...] "a really old-fashioned scary episode of Doctor Who" [...] {{targeted}} especially at children nine to twelve, which <b>was</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> remembered Doctor Who at that age. He stated that [...] "time travel and ghosts are echoes of one another. What is a ghost, if not a fragment caught in time?" [...] He aimed to show suspense and tension, as {{he felt it was}} more terrifying than [...] "full-on shock horror blood and gore". Cross was inspired by The Quatermass Experiment and its sequels, and originally intended to have the Doctor meet Bernard Quatermass, though this was not possible, for copyright reasons. Cross was also inspired by Quatermass writer Nigel Kneale's The Stone Tape, which was why he set the story in the 1970s. [...] "Hide" [...] was intended to be a [...] "very small, very restricted ghost story", but he was asked to make it bigger in the end. The different universe was present, but it was [...] "smoke and mirrors" [...] and the climax originally took place in the house, just in daylight and in the alternate world. The idea of the Crooked Man was something Cross said lurked in his imagination. The love story twist was added in later, because Moffat felt the monster should be more fleshed out, and Cross chose to mirror the love plot between Emma and the Professor.|$|E
500|$|Speer {{managed to}} reach a {{relatively}} safe area near Hamburg as the Nazi regime finally collapsed, but decided on a final, risky visit to Berlin to see Hitler one more time. Speer stated at Nuremberg, [...] "I {{felt that it was}} my duty not to run away like a coward, but to stand up to him again." [...] Speer visited the Führerbunker on April22. Hitler seemed calm and somewhat distracted, and the two had a long, disjointed conversation in which the dictator defended his actions and informed Speer of his intent to commit suicide and have his body burned. In the published edition of Inside the Third Reich, Speer relates that he confessed to Hitler that he had defied the Nero Decree, but then assured Hitler of his personal loyalty, bringing tears to the dictator's eyes. Speer biographer Gitta Sereny argued, [...] "Psychologically, it is possible {{that this is the way}} he remembered the occasion, because it <b>was</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> would have liked to behave, and the way he would have liked Hitler to react. But the fact is that none of it happened; our witness to this is Speer himself." [...] Sereny notes that Speer's original draft of his memoirs lacks the confession and Hitler's tearful reaction, and contains an explicit denial that any confession or emotional exchange took place, as had been alleged in a French magazine article.|$|E

500|$|Hoffman {{explained}} {{the key to}} his changeup <b>was</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> pinched the seam of the ball with his thumb and index finger as he released it. He threw the changeup with the arm speed used to throw a fastball, and the spin and movement of the ball looked the same to the batter. His changeup ranged from 73–76mph. Bruce Bochy, who managed Hoffman for over a decade with the Padres, said of Hoffman's changeup: [...] "He pitched so well off his fastball [...] couldn't just sit on it every pitch." [...] "You could be sitting on [...] and still not be successful with it", says former player Mark Sweeney. It was the arm action on the change up and the late sink just before it reached the plate that allowed Hoffman to stay successful over the years. With opponents flailing to slow down their swings, teammates nicknamed Hoffman's changeup The Bugs Bunny Pitch after a famous Bugs Bunny cartoon episode. [...] "Some [...] fool you. Some guys overpower you. Hoffman embarrasses you", said former rival and later teammate Mike Piazza. After striking out on a changeup to end the game against Hoffman, Dodger catcher Paul Lo Duca said, [...] "It's like it has a parachute on it." [...] As Hoffman lost velocity on his fastball throughout his career, he compensated by maintaining a notable speed differential between that pitch and his changeup. He initially kept the grip of his changeup a secret. [...] "I was a little weird about it", Hoffman said. [...] "I didn't like talking about how I threw the change. I didn't want people to see how I gripped the ball. I thought I'd be giving away something to the hitters." [...] Later in his career, he posed for pictures of his grip, figuring everyone had seen it.|$|E
500|$|In {{writing for}} Batman, Hill {{considered}} that a fundamental {{aspect of the}} character <b>was</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> interacts with his villains, allies, and the city around him. Hill said: [...] "You know, {{what does it mean}} to be Batman? ...How does it affect Batman when things happen to him? What is his psychological make up? Those are the influences behind the game... you actually delve into the psyche of what makes him what he is, which is where I think so much of the interest in Batman is." [...] Batman's armor was redesigned to match that of the Batmobile to make them appear visually similar—featuring the same shapes and material textures—and appear functionally compatible with the high-speed methods in which the character enters and exits the vehicle. The design also added armor over Batman's shoulders, covering the previously exposed cape, to make it appear more feasible that it could hold Batman's weight without failing during gliding. For other returning characters, art director David Hego said that the designs were conceived to keep them interesting after players had seen them several times before in previous games, while the game's autumnal setting also necessitated a change in character clothing over the winter setting of Arkham City. The Penguin lost his long coat, and was made to look dirtier, his clothing showing signs of sweat and food stains, and his head was shaved. For Two-Face, the designers felt the character did not require changing significantly, and instead emphasized existing character traits, particularly his disfigured flesh, using references of burnt flesh as inspiration. Similarly, they wanted to retain the typical Riddler characterizations like green shirts emblazoned with question marks, but instead had the character design evolve throughout the game, modifying his own costume in response to the events of the plot.|$|E
