25|$|Examples of {{non-linear}} loads on a {{power system}} are rectifiers (such {{as used in}} a power supply), and arc discharge devices such as fluorescent lamps, electric <b>welding</b> <b>machines,</b> or arc furnaces. Because current in these systems is interrupted by a switching action, the current contains frequency components that are multiples of the power system frequency. Distortion power factor {{is a measure of}} how much the harmonic distortion of a load current decreases the average power transferred to the load.|$|E
25|$|Fast pulse {{rise time}} rating, high {{dielectric}} strength (breakdown voltage), and low dissipation factor (high Q) are {{the reasons for the}} use of polypropylene film capacitors in fly-back tuning and S-correction applications in older CRT tube television and display equipment. For similar reasons, PP film capacitors, often in versions with special terminals for high peak currents, work well as snubbers for power electronic circuits. Because of their high pulse surge capabilities, PP capacitors are suitable for use in applications where high-current pulses are needed, such as in time-domain reflectometer (TDR) cable fault locators, in <b>welding</b> <b>machines,</b> defibrillators, in high-power pulsed lasers, or to generate high-energy light or X-ray flashes.|$|E
500|$|When Cloud Gates {{interior}} {{components were}} completed, construction crews {{prepared to work}} on the outer shell; this comprises 168stainless steel panels, each [...] thick and weighing [...] They were fabricated using three-dimensional modeling software. Computers and robots were essential in the bending and shaping of the plates, which was performed by English wheel and a robotic scanning device. Metal stiffeners were welded to each panel's interior face to provide a small degree of rigidity. About a third of the plates, along with the entire interior structure, were fabricated in Oakland. The plates were polished to 98percent of their final state and covered with protective white film before being sent to Chicago via trucks. Once in Chicago, the plates were welded together on-site, creating 2,442linear feet (744m) of welded seams. Welders used keyhole <b>welding</b> <b>machines</b> rather than traditional welding guns. The plates were fabricated so precisely that no on-site cutting or filing was necessary when lifting and fitting them into position.|$|E

2500|$|Amphibious {{assaults on}} Japanese-held {{islands in the}} South and Southwest Pacific Theater had {{involved}} virtually hundreds of landing craft of all types and sizes, ranging from small craft to infantry landing craft (LCIs) and tank landing craft (LCTs). Since these specialized assault craft, of comparatively light construction, could not be repaired with the few facilities and men available to them alone, orders went out that several tank landing ships (LSTs) would be converted to special landing craft repair ships (later classified as ARL). However, modifying existing LSTs in stateside yards required time, a critical commodity in the fairly steady pace of the amphibious island-hopping campaigns, that the forces fighting at the front did not have. At this point, LST-455, then in Australian waters, came under the gaze of these amphibious planners. In one month, lathes, <b>welding</b> <b>machines,</b> as well as cutting outfits and repair tools for the necessary types of craft, were installed on board. Departmental shops of many kinds: ranging from machine shops to motor repair work, to shipfitting, to metalsmith, to electric, and radio repair, took shape in {{what had once been}} the cavernous tank deck. Experienced personnel, trained in ship repair work, were assigned to the ship and almost doubled the size of her complement. Experienced personnel, trained in ship repair work, were assigned to the ship and almost doubled the size of her complement.

40|$|Abstract – This study {{deals with}} the {{development}} of an electrofusion <b>welding</b> <b>machine</b> that is capable of joining plastic pipes using a recently developed electrofusion fitting. This fitting has built-in conductive plastics that are used to weld the joint together as a heating element. In order to explain the mechanism of the new machine, 1) the resistance characteristics of the heating element were explained, 2) the method of electric welding that uses the electrofusion fitting was described, and 3) the method of power supply based on controlling the firing angle was explained. A control system for an intelligent electrofusion <b>welding</b> <b>machine</b> was proposed. This system has the ability to recognize the diameter of an electrofusion fitting using a lookup-table based on the difference of resistance curves according to fitting types, and it is able to weld the fittings regardless of the ambient temperature. A new algorithm was developed to control the power of electric welding through the recognition of feature points from the resistance curve of the heating element. In order to evaluate the performance of the developed <b>welding</b> <b>machine,</b> tests involving the welding of 16 mm- and 20 mm-type fittings were carried out.
