40|$|A {{necessary}} step in {{the development}} of structural composites is the understanding and characterization of the bond between fiber and matrix, Questions regarding the mechanical properties of the optimum interfacial bond and how properties of the bond can be assessed nondestructively must be answered. In this paper we present some results of a program at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) in which the characterization and control of interfacial bonds in composites are being investigated. The General Purpose Powder Diffractometer (GPPD) at the Intense Pulsed Neutron Source (IPNS) at ANL has been employed to measure residual strains in a ceramic-ceramic composite by neutron diffraction techniques. From the residual strain measurements it is possible to calculate stresses at the fiber-matrix interface. The results of the residual strain experiment and the initial results from experiments in which ultrasonic techniques were used to assess <b>whisker-matrix</b> <b>bonding</b> are discussed in this paper...|$|E
