30|$|Overall, {{districts with}} the highest SVI scores {{are located in the}} New Territories, namely, North, Yuen Long, and Tuen Mun. The New Territories are home to {{indigenous}} villagers and comprise a large segment of woodlands and non-government owned lands used as village-type development. This condition results in distinct rural landscapes that are different from Hong Kong’s urban areas. In the case of Yuen Long, live-alone elderly, poverty, and access to primary healthcare services generally produce high SVI scores compared with other domains. A few CAs feature a high percentage of institutionalized elderly. In the north district, six factors (excluding disability) are relevant to high SVI outcomes. In Tuen Mun, the size of the elderly population, number of institutionalized elderly, and obstacles to communication constitute key factors that make for CAs with greater social vulnerability. In urban areas (Hong Kong Island and Kowloon), CAs with high SVI scores are dispersed in Sham Shui Po, Wong Tai Sin, and Kwai Tsing. Sham Shui Po and Wong Tai Sin have a large percentage of elderly residents. Poverty remains a significant factor in Sham Shui Po. Moreover, Sham Shui Po also has been home to poor new immigrants from mainland China, and is also the site of the first public housing projects that aimed to resettle homeless victims who were displaced by the 1953 fire in the Shek Kip Mei slums. The high SVI scores are from all seven domains. In Wong Tai Sin, the presence of a large segment of residents who are elderly, often afflicted with a disability, and frequently encounter obstacles to communication are the three factors that differentiate high SVI CAs from others. In Kwai Tsing, access to primary <b>care</b> <b>remains</b> <b>critical,</b> compounded by a relatively large ageing population and obstacles to communication. Area-based intervention programs are significant given that urban areas comprise communities with different levels of vulnerability. The neighborhood should be carefully selected before community programs are launched.|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Linkage of HIV-infected {{pregnant}} women to HIV <b>care</b> <b>remains</b> <b>critical</b> {{for improvement of}} maternal and child outcomes through prevention of maternal-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) and subsequent chronic HIV care. This study determined proportions and factors associated with intra-facility linkage to HIV care and Early Infant Diagnosis care (EID) to inform strategic scale up of PMTCT programs. METHODS: A cross-sectional review of records was done at 2 urban and 3 rural public health care facilities supported by the Infectious Diseases Institute (IDI). HIV-infected pregnant mothers, identified through routine antenatal care (ANC) and HIV-exposed babies were evaluated for enrollment in HIV clinics by 6 weeks post-delivery. RESULTS: Overall, 1, 025 HIV-infected pregnant mothers were identified during ANC between January and June, 2012; 267 / 1, 025 (26 %) in rural and 743 / 1, 025 (74 %) in urban facilities. Of these 375 / 1, 025 (37 %) were linked to HIV clinics [67 / 267 (25 %) rural and 308 / 758 (41 %) urban]. Of 636 HIV-exposed babies, 193 (30 %) were linked to EID. Linkage of mother-baby pairs to HIV chronic care and EID was 16 % (101 / 636); 8 / 179 (4. 5 %) ] in rural and 93 / 457 (20. 3 %) in urban health facilities. Within rural facilities, ANC registration < 28 weeks-of-gestation was associated with mothers' linkage to HIV chronic care [AoR, 2. 0 95 % CI, 1. 1 - 3. 7, p =  0. 019] and mothers' multi-parity was associated with baby's linkage to EID; AoR 4. 4 (1. 3 - 15. 1), p =  0. 023. Stigma, long distance to health facilities and vertical PMTCT services affected linkage in rural facilities, while peer mothers, infant feeding services, long patient queues and limited privacy hindered linkage to HIV care in urban settings. CONCLUSION: Post-natal linkage of HIV-infected mothers to chronic HIV care and HIV-exposed babies to EID programs was low. Barriers to linkage to HIV care vary in urban and rural settings. We recommend targeted interventions to rapidly improve linkage to antiretroviral therapy for elimination of MTCT...|$|R

40|$|Cuba has {{developed}} a programme of quality improvement of its health services, which includes an extramural emergency care system in which polyclinics and general practitioner networks play an important role. Using routine health information from the decentralised first line emergency units (FLES) and from the hospital emergency service (HES) for the period 1995 - 2000, we evaluated {{the effects of the}} emergency care subsystem reform on the utilisation rates of first line and hospital services in Baracoa and Cerro, a rural and a metropolitan municipality, respectively. In the self-contained health system of Baracoa, the reform of the emergency subsystem resulted in a first phase of increased utilisation of the FLES, followed by a second phase of gradual decrease, during which there was an increased utilisation of general practitioners. In contrast, the overall results of the reform in Cerro were unclear. The proximity to a hospital seems {{to be the most important}} element in the patient's decision on which entry point to the Cerro health system to use. A potential adverse effect of the reform is an increased emergency services utilisation in situations <b>where</b> GP <b>care</b> <b>remains</b> below patients' expectations. Given the current world-wide trends in health-care reform, the organisational alternatives developed in the Cuban health system might remain specific to the local contextual setting.

Further studies against known standards established the existence of caffeic acid and quercetin 3 -rhamnoside in varying concentration in different MEM fractions. Time course analysis of MEM treated prostate cancer cells indicated significant decrease in cell viability, assessed by MTT and clonogenic survival assays. This was accompanied by G 2 phase arrest of cell cycle, downregulation of cyclin/cdk network and increase in cdk inhibitors. MEM treated cells exhibited cleavage of Caspase- 3 and PARP, and modulation of apoptotic proteins, establishing apoptosis as the primary mechanism of cell death. Notably MEM suppressed AR/PSA signaling both in prostate cancer cell cultures and in the in vivo model. Intraperitoneal injection of MEM (1. 25 and 2. 5 mg/ animal) to athymic nude mice implanted with androgen sensitive CWR 22 Rν 1 cells showed significant inhibition in tumor growth and decreased serum PSA levels reciprocating in vitro findings. Taken together, our data suggest that MEM may be explored further for its potential therapeutic effects against prostate cancer progression in humans...|$|R
