25|$|The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in an {{internal}} report by delegate George Burnier, stated the following in April 1920:There are two distinct military organizations in Hungary: the national army {{and a kind}} of civil guard which was formed when the communist régime fell. It is the latter which has been responsible for all the reprehensible acts committed. The Government managed to regain control of these organizations only a few weeks ago. They are now well-disciplined and collaborate with the municipal police forces.This deep hostility toward Communism would be the more lasting legacy of Kun's abortive revolution. It was a conviction shared by Horthy and his country's ruling class that would help drive Hungary into what might have been a fatal alliance with Adolf Hitler.The nation of the Hungarians loved and admired Budapest, which became its polluter in the last years. Here, {{on the banks of the}} Danube, I arraign her. This city has disowned her thousand years of tradition, she has dragged the Holy Crown and the national colours in the dust, she has clothed herself in red rags. The finest of the nation she threw into dungeons or drove into exile. She laid in ruin our property and wasted our wealth. Yet the nearer <b>we</b> <b>approached</b> to this city, the more rapidly did the ice in our hearts melt. We are now ready to forgive her.|$|E

They worked on it again during the joint sessions for Kid A (2000) and Amnesiac (2001). During this time, guitarist Ed O'Brien kept an online diary of the band's progress, and wrote in January 2000: [...] " [...] has been kicking around for about four years now and each time <b>we</b> <b>approached</b> it we {{seemed to be going}} down the same old paths. It actually sounds like the start of something exciting now." [...] One month later, he wrote: [...] "This is something like approach number 561 but it is a great song. It's simply {{trying to find a way}} of doing it which excites us. And we may have found a way, at the very least we've found a new approach … It may of course be utter crap and we have so lost the plot on this song. Please don't let that be the case." [...] The band failed to find an arrangement that satisfied them, and the song remained unreleased.|$|E

I guess when people used it as propaganda for their own ideas—you know, when Justice Scalia mentioned Jack Bauer—that would make me feel uncomfortable." [...] On the topic of torture and Islamophobia within the series, Gordon said, [...] "I think the one thing that we all felt very confident about—although we had a vigorous behind-the-scenes debate—was at what point are we loyal and beholden to good storytelling, and at what level do you hold yourself accountable for things like stoking Islamophobia or promoting torture as a policy? There were just certain things that we needed to portray {{in order to make it}} feel thrilling—and real, even. When discussing his regrets, he referred to an advertisement for the show for its fourth season (though mistakenly quoted it as an advertisement for the second season, saying [...] "I actually do have regrets about one particular moment, which had more to do with the promotion of the show. In season four, the story involved a Muslim American family, and the father and the mother—and the son—were party to a terror plot. It was sort of a purple conceit in a way. But it was maybe a year and a half after 9/11, and on the 405 freeway there's this giant electronic billboard, and I think the line was: [...] "They could be next door." [...] The writers and the producers were not party to that campaign, but we quickly put an end to it, and realized how dangerous and potentially incendiary this show could be. And I think our awareness of that changed the way <b>we</b> <b>approached</b> the series. So I guess you could call it a regret, but it was really an epiphany.|$|E

In May 2001 their fourth album, The Go was issued, which peaked at No.54 on the ARIA Albums Chart, No.10 on the Australasian Albums Chart and No.8 on the Alternative Albums Chart. It, too, received favourable reviews, with The Sunday Telegraphs Kathy McCabe declaring: [...] "It would be a travesty if this album didn't elevate Skunkhour to their deserved position of Australia's best funk-rock band.

The exterior of the cave scene was filmed at the Cliffs of Moher in the west of Ireland, the only location to be filmed outside of the United Kingdom throughout the film series. The interior of the cave is made up of geometric crystal formations. Craig noted [...] "Apart from the point at which Harry and Dumbledore first arrive and the island formation on which everything inside the cave happens, the set is entirely virtual, designed in the computer.

[...] For a moment the drum stood between him and the object of his affections, but eventually he managed to plant two loud kisses on the drummer’s cheeks. [...] Then he made for the general-in-chief. [...] There was a sudden hush, as when an orchestra falls silent {{at the end of a}} dance. [...] He recovered himself, solemnly clicked his heels, and saluted General Brière de l’Isle. [...] We recognised Captain de Borelli.|$|E

2500|$|All the {{survivors}} of the Light Brigade were now behind the Russian guns in the valley, yet the turning point of the action was the realisation that Lucan and the Heavy Brigade was not following in support. Russian officers, noticing how vastly superior their numbers were, managed to halt their retreat near the Chernaya, and edge forward their men. The Russian lancer regiments waiting on heights were now ordered down into the valley to form a line behind the British (the 13th, 17th, and 8th on the right of the valley, the 11th and 4th on the left) and block their route of escape. Those watching with Raglan thought the Light Brigade completely lost, but unexpectedly the two groups of survivors managed to break through the Russian trap. Still far from the British line, however, they once again came under fire from the guns and marksmen on the Causeway Heights. [...] "The truth must be told," [...] recorded Lieutenant Koribut Kubitovich, [...] "that this fire hit us just as it did the enemy," [...] but admitted that, [...] "The English fought with astounding bravery, and when <b>we</b> <b>approached</b> their dismounted and wounded men, even these refused to surrender and continued to fight till the ground was soaked with their blood." ...|$|E

He {{made it clear that}} the ordinary rules of warfare would not apply to the Russian campaign. [...] "This is a war of extermination," [...] he told them. [...] "We do not wage war to preserve the enemy." [...] This gave the generals a clear warning that they would be expected not to obstruct Hitler's wider war aims in the east – the extermination of the Jews and the reduction of the Slavic peoples to serfdom under a new Herrenvolk (Master race) of German settlers. As part of this strategy, the Commissar Order was issued, which stated that all Red Army commissars were to be executed when captured. Rundstedt testified at Nuremberg about the attitude of the Army to this Order: [...] "Our attitude was unanimously and absolutely against it. Immediately after the conference <b>we</b> <b>approached</b> Brauchitsch and told him that this was impossible... The order was simply not carried out." [...] This latter statement was clearly untrue, as the Commissar Order was widely carried out. But whether Rundstedt knew this was another matter, and this question was later to figure prominently in the issue of whether to charge him with war crimes.|$|E

'The worst part of this is that my mother won't be getting my letters', and then he was silent for a long time. I could not say a single word.
