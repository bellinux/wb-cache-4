40|$|Asino cheese, {{traditionally}} made in some {{mountain areas}} of NE Italy, acquires its typical flavour by long salting (2 - 4 months, depending on cheese wt.) {{in a special}} salting brine (called "salmuerie") in which a dilute brine (approx. 4 % w/w NaCl) is mixed with cheese <b>whey</b> and <b>cream</b> from natural creaming. This brine is kept in wooden vats and never totally renewed, although its contents are periodically adjusted by addition of various components and frequently oxygenated by mixing. This enables the biochemical reactions involved, primarily with the cream lipids but probably also with fat from the immersed cheese, to occur. These reactions are discussed, particularly {{from the viewpoint of}} the development of free fatty acids (FFA) in the brine. The FFA, together with the salt, migrate from the brine into the cheese by osmosis. Study of the ripening process of cheeses in the brine and cheeses ripened in a traditional store proved that the reactions occurring in the special brine yielded the compounds mainly responsible for the flavour of Asino cheese...|$|R
50|$|Historically whey, being a {{byproduct}} of cheese making, was considered a waste product and was pumped into rivers and streams in the U.S. Containing protein, this practice led {{to the growth of}} large concentrations of algae. These were deemed to be a hazard to the ecosystem because they prevented sunlight and oxygen from reaching the water. The government eventually prohibited this practice which led to a disposal problem for producers. Their first solution was {{to use it as a}} cheap filler in the production of ice <b>cream.</b> <b>Whey</b> eventually found its way into many other products as a filler and ultimately into a number of health food products where it remains a popular supplement.|$|R

40|$|The use of {{a ceramic}} {{microfiltration}} (MF) membrane for the fractionation of buttermilk and whey buttermilk obtained from pilot scale churning of cream and <b>whey</b> <b>cream</b> from industrial sources has been studied. Whey buttermilk contained comparable amounts of phospholipids compared to regular buttermilk but its protein content was lower due {{to the absence of}} caseins. However, it was found that lipid content of <b>whey</b> <b>cream</b> did vary significantly between lots resulting in important variations in the fat content of whey buttermilk. A twofold MF concentration of regular buttermilk doubled its phospholipids content whereas that of whey buttermilk was increased by 50 %. The overall efficiency of the MF processing of regular buttermilk was limited by the amount of caseins retained by the MF membrane. Analysis of the protein profile of permeates and retentates showed that the transmission of milk fat globule membrane proteins by the MF membrane was lower when using whey buttermilk as compared to regular buttermilk possibly indicating the influence of casein micelles in fractionation or some structural differences between both products...|$|E

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of selenium secretion by the mammary gland {{and effects of}} dietary copper and selenium metabolism on selenium in milk were investigated. Radioactive sodium selenite was injected into the jugular vein of lactating goats fed concentrates containing 15 or 115 ppm copper. Blood and milk samples were collected hourly for 8 h and daily for 1 wk. Whole blood, plasma, whole milk, and casein, <b>whey,</b> and <b>cream</b> fractions of milk were counted for selenium- 75. No significant differences due to dietary copper were seen. The selenium- 75 was primarily associated with the casein in milk. The association of selenium with the whey fraction was greater for early periods than later and varied between animals. The specific activity based on protein content was greater in casein than in whey. Peak selenium- 75 in whole milk occurred 2 h after the peak in plasma. On day 7 following selenium- 75 dosing, kidney had the highest specific activity, and liver was slightly higher than mam-mary tissue. All subcellular organelle fractions of liver, kidney, and mammary tissue by homogenization and differential centrifugation contained significant sele-nium- 75. Selenium normally is secreted from the mammary secretory cell in combination with protein through the secretory vesicles, metabolism of selenite prior to milk secretion is important, and copper does not interfere with normal metabolism of selenium...|$|R
40|$|The {{ripening}} {{of cream}} {{is essentially a}} bacteriological and chemical phenomenon. The main process in the ripening is the lactic acid fermentation. Although {{it has not been}} proved that the lactic acid fermentation is responsible for all the changes in cream ripening, it is so closely associated with them that in practice ripening is governed by controlling this fermentation. This is done by controlling the temperature and using starters. A starter is a material containing bacteria, used to inoculate a dairy product. It may be employed to inoculate milk for cheese-making or cream for butter-making. The bacteria are presumably of a desirable kind and are present in great numbers. Whole milk, skim milk, butter-milk, <b>cream,</b> <b>whey,</b> and sugar solutions are used for growing the bacteria. The germs are usually lactic acid bacteria, but some cultures are said to contain flavor producing bacteria...|$|R
40|$|As {{the cheese}} market faces strong {{international}} competition, the optimization of production processes {{becomes more important}} for the economic success of dairy companies. In dairy productions, whey from former cheese batches is frequently re-used to increase the yield, to improve the texture and to increase the nutrient value of the final product. Recycling of <b>whey</b> <b>cream</b> and particulated whey proteins is also routinely performed. Most bacteriophages, however, survive pasteurization and may re-enter the cheese manufacturing process. There is a risk that phages multiply to high numbers during the production. Contamination of whey samples with bacteriophages may cause problems in cheese factories because whey separation often leads to aerosol-borne phages and thus contamination of the factory environment. Furthermore, <b>whey</b> <b>cream</b> or whey proteins used for recycling into cheese matrices may contain thermo-resistant phages. Drained cheese whey can be contaminated with phages as high as 109 phages per mL. When whey batches are concentrated, phage titers can increase significantly by a factor of 10 hindering a complete elimination of phages. To eliminate the risk of fermentation failure during recycling of whey, whey treatments assuring an efficient reduction of phages are indispensable. This review focuses on inactivation of phages in whey by thermal treatment, ultraviolet (UV) light irradiation and membrane filtration. Inactivation by heat is the most common procedure. However, application of heat for inactivation of thermo-resistant phages in whey is restricted due to negative effects on the functional properties of native whey proteins. Therefore an alternative strategy applying combined treatments should be favoured - rather than heating the dairy product at extreme temperature/time combinations. By using membrane filtration or UV treatment in combination with thermal treatment, phage numbers in whey can be reduced sufficiently to prevent subsequent phage accumulations...|$|E

Neonatal dairy calf nutritional strategies are constantly manipulated and explored as gastrointestinal development, growth, health, and cost are considered. Functional food incorporation {{is becoming increasingly}} important to eliminate fed antimicrobials. Alternative protein use is continuously research as competition for whey proteins increases. All programs need to result in the healthiest and well-grown calf possible, with a well-developed ruminant system before weaning, achieved by grain intake. These three studies investigate achieving these goals. <b>Whey</b> <b>cream</b> replacing a portion of conventional milk replacer (22 % protein, 20 % fat, DM basis) was successful with some tendencies for growth and health. The large amount (4 % of BW) of high starch starter (38 %) consumed by harvested calves showed signs of mild to moderate acidosis and gastrointestinal inflammation. A study replacing 5 % of 22 % whey protein with soy isolate led to similar performance and health when fed at a step-up method. A study comparing the interaction of medium chain fatty acids (MCFA) on the plane of nutrition with an accelerated (28 % protein, 21 % fat, DM basis), resulted in most benefits with MCFA was combined with a high plane of nutrition. Although starter intake was greater for the low plane of nutrition, high plane of nutrition had increased body weight gain because energy intake between the treatments was not similar until week 6 of life. Harvested calves in this study (week 3) yielded interesting results about when maturation of the gut may begin in relationship to grain intake...|$|E
40|$|With the {{ultimate}} goal to study milk folate bioavailability, a reverse-phase HPLC technique was developed and compared with a radioprotein binding assay. All methods showed similar ranges for folates in cow’s milk, with the variation attributed to seasonal variations {{and the use of}} different starter cultures. Most cheese varieties contained slightly higher values for <b>whey</b> <b>cream</b> cheese. Studies using HPLC indicated 5 -methyltetra- hydrofolate (5 -CH 3 THF) as the major folate form in milk, but more studies are needed concerning folate forms in other dairy products. Due to the suggested role of folate-binding proteins in facilitating the absorption of folates from milk, new data on actual concentrations in different dairy products are now available and presented in this study. These data clearly showed that folate- binding proteins are present in unprocessed milk, pasteurised milk, spray-dried skim milk powder, and whey. In contrast, UHT milk, fermented milk, and most cheeses contained only low or trace amounts. Among the factors responsible for incomplete bioavailability is the possible degradation of labile tetrahydrofolate forms in the acidic gastric environment. In order to investigate this possibility, an in vitro method which simulated conditions prevailing in the stomach and in the small intestine was developed. The retention of 5 -CH 3 THF in the dairy products was close to 90 % in the presence of 0. 01 % sodium ascorbate, as compared to ordinary food folate analysis using HPLC. Without ascorbate, the retention of native 5 -CH 3 THF was lower, generally between 40 % and 90 %. Thus, provided that the environment in the stomach and small intestine offers a sufficiently reducing environment, only minimal losses of dietary 5 -CH 3 THF due to degradation would be expected. Interestingly, milk did increase the apparent absorption of dietary folates significantly (P < 0. 05) in a balance study with ileostomy patients, however, {{there was no difference between}} fermented and unfermented milk. Therefore, the suggested role of folate-binding protein in the absorption of dairy folates did not seem to affect the total amounts of dietary folates absorbed, at least not in this model, for adults, where milk constitutes only a part of the total folate intake...|$|E
40|$|International audienceCream {{cheese is}} a good model for {{studying}} the effect of process and formulation changes on the modification of product texture. In this study, the intensity of heat treatment (72  °C/ 20  s or 94  °C/ 40  s), the final pH of acidification (pH  5. 2 or 4. 9) and the homogenization pressure (0, 5, 20, or 60  MPa) were studied. Special {{attention was paid to}} the whey protein denaturation, casein micelle dissociation, fat globule size and their relations with structural, rheological, and sensory characteristics of the cream cheese model. Rheological properties of final cream cheese mainly depended on homogenization pressure. Increasing the homogenization pressure led to a decrease in fat globule size and consequently in an increase in the cream cheese firmness. This result was modulated by heat treatment temperature and the subsequent <b>whey</b> protein denaturation. <b>Cream</b> cheese final pH between 5. 2 and 4. 9 had a low impact on rheological properties but was the most discriminating factor for sensory perception by strongly affecting product appearance especially its brightness and its shade...|$|R
40|$|Food {{microbial}} {{populations are}} complex and dynamic: they develop and change their composition all throughout shelf life, establishing tangled interaction that traditional culture-dependent methods cannot completely point out. Thus, in this field, Next generation sequencing has become more interesting since the study of microbial communities has reached a depth of analysis never seen before: species richness and evenness, the detection of rare bacterial populations, {{the analysis of the}} genetical responses to food environments are some information provided by Nextgen techniques. In this work an industrial ricotta cheese microbial community was monitored starting from raw materials to product expiry date: Illumina MiSeq 2 x 300 bp 16 S amplicon analysis was exploited with a simple protocol for library production, normalization and pooling, in parallel with culture-dependent analysis. On one hand raw material and the product were processed all throughout shelf-life using classic culture-dependent methods while, at the same time, RNA or DNA was extracted from the samples and sequenced with Nextgen approach. Microbial populations were different between the raw matters (<b>whey</b> and <b>cream)</b> and showed typical environmental contaminants, lactic acid bacteria and aerobic spores (Pseudomonas, Aeromonas, Streptococcus, Lactococcus, Kocuria, Hafnia). Most of the microbial populations in the ricotta cheese samples appeared to be composed of Bacillus and Paenibacillus. Both genera derived from spores germination and increased exponentially within two weeks of 8 °C storage, reaching 107 CFU/ml; within 20 days cheese pH decreased from 6, 4 - 6, 2 to 5, 7 - 5, 5, showing acidification due to active bacterial metabolism. With this approach we precisely understood what kind of bacteria were present in the tested products from raw matters to expiry date: these essential informations can be exploited in order to improve ricotta cheese chain production...|$|R
40|$|Foods {{are complex}} ecosystems, {{due to the}} {{influence}} of either intrinsic and extrinsic factors such as the chemical composition, microbial communities and the environment that can {{have an effect on the}} final product. In cheese microbes are the most influencing factor because they can effect both shelf-life and quality flavor/taste of the food. In addition microbiome establishes complex interactions within the bacterial community itself and between the food environment, such that nowadays these dynamics have been only partially highlighted with traditional culture-dependent technique. Thus, culture-independent methods such as Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) approach have become a powerful tool to study in depth microbial communities contained in a variety of ecological niches, including food. In fact they should be increasingly considered as a complementary technique to culture-dependent methods in microbiology. In this comprehensive study we have evaluated and applied a 16 S Next Generation Sequencing approach to the study of Ricotta cheese shelf life, its raw materials and to food technology studies in soft or ripened cheeses using adjunct cultures. In all these studies NGS method have always been supported with culture-dependent approaches, other molecular methods and biochemical analysis. The different studies are separated in the subsequent chapters of this dissertation. First of all using a mock community we evaluated the impact of 16 S NGS pipeline on the final community structure and identification, showing that bioinformatic analysis, and above all the OTU-picking strategy, can affect the alpha-diversity (within the sample) of the community but not its beta-diversity (between samples). To this extent both strategies can be used in order to compare community structures. Moreover the protocol was showed as robust and repeatable. Secondly we evaluated the raw materials (<b>wheys</b> and <b>cream)</b> used for ricotta production showing that the microbiological quality of these materials must be improved. As they showed a very biodiverse micro flora (mainly Streptococcaceae and Pseudomonadaceae) and a high concentration of aerobic spores (10 to 104 CFU/ml, not present in cream) their usage for Ricotta-making could damage the final product. Moreover NGS combined with Gas Cromatography approach on organoleptic non satisfactory frozen wheys showed that under-hygienic storage of the raw materials drove to the production of fermentation or lipid oxidation compounds influenced by particular bacteria such as Acinetobacter, Lactococcus and Pseudomonas. In the third chapter we evaluated Ricotta shelf life during winter and summer season, showing that Ricotta microbiome was mainly composed of spore-forming bacteria, Bacillus, Paenibacillus and Clostridium (more than 80...|$|R
40|$|IS 900 PCR for Mycobacterium paratuberculosis {{was applied}} to <b>cream,</b> <b>whey,</b> and pellet {{fractions}} of centrifuged whole cows' milk. The test and simultaneous control reactions gave correct results for spiked milk and for native milk samples obtained directly from M. paratuberculosis-free, subclinically infected, and clinically infected cows. The test was then applied to units of whole pasteurized cows' milk widely obtained from retail outlets throughout central and southern England from September 1991 to March 1993. With peak periods in January to March and in September to November, when up to 25 % of units were affected, an overall 22 of 312 samples (7 %) tested positive for M. paratuberculosis. In 18 of the 22 positive samples (81 %), the PCR signal segregated to the cream or pellet fractions or both, consistent {{with the presence of}} intact mycobacteria. Nine of 18 PCR-positive milk samples (50 %) and 6 of 36 PCR-negative milk samples (16 %) yielded long-term liquid cultures which tested positive for M. paratuberculosis after 13 to 40 months of incubation, despite overgrowth by other organisms. Taken together with data on the prevalence of M. paratuberculosis infection in herds in the United Kingdom, the known secretion of M. paratuberculosis in milk from subclinically infected animals, and the inability of laboratory conditions simulating pasteurization to ensure the killing of all these slowly growing or unculturable organisms, there is a high risk, particularly at peak times, that residual M. paratuberculosis will be present in retail pasteurized cows' milk in England...|$|R
40|$|Milk {{and dairy}} {{products}} become integral part of human nutrition and belong to common food. Milk is very valuable because it contains complete proteins. Its disaccharide lactose is a source of energy. Butterfat is easily digestible. Besides potassium, sodium, magnesium, chlorine and sulfur milk contains also dietary elements like calcium and phosphorus. Milk also contains many trace elements like iron, zinc, iodine, selenium, manganese, fluorine, chromium, cobalt, and molybdenum. Milk is {{an important source of}} vitamins. It contains significant amounts of water soluble B and C vitamins alongside fat soluble vitamins E and A and smaller amounts of vitamins K and D. Milk {{and dairy products}} are an important source of calcium. Lack of calcium is the main cause of osteoporosis. Regular consumption of milk and dairy products may reduce the risk of cancer. Nevertheless disproportionate consumption of dairy products containing unsaturated fats can lead to higher incidence of certain types of cancer, higher risk of cardiovascular diseases and metabolic syndrome. Milk contains also compounds that prevent aforementioned diseases. Milk is the only source of nutrients for newborn children and suckled infants. It is convenient source of nutrients in times of higher nutrient demands especially during pregnancy, nursing and senescence. Milk, milk cream, fermented milk products, buttermilk, cheese, whey, curd cheese, <b>whey</b> proteins, frozen <b>creams,</b> cream, condensed and powdered milk belong to most important products. Fermented milk products are very beneficial to human health. Those products are sources of complete proteins, calcium, phosphor and vitamins, especially B vitamins. Lactose is decreased making fermented milk suitable for lactose-intolerant subjects. The fermentation process increases the shelf-life of the product while improving the digestibility and microbiological safety. Milk and dairy products consumption can also have negative impact on human health. Lactase deficiency or lactase insufficient activity in small intestine results in lactose intolerance. Milk can also cause food allergy to the cow's milk...|$|R
40|$|Cheeses of low pH, such as Feta, Blue, Cream and Cheshire, often exude whey after manufacture. This {{exudation}} {{lowers the}} yield and reduces product acceptability. Virtually no scientific {{study has been}} undertaken on this subject. Investigations were therefore undertaken to determine the factors affecting exudation and to elucidate the underlying mechanism. Cream cheese made by the hot-pack method and recombined Feta cheese made by the traditional method, representing unripened and ripened varieties of cheese respectively, were studied. In Cream cheese the amount of exudate increased with decreased protein to fat (P /F) ratio, decreased homogenisation pressure, decreased pasteurisation temperature, decreased pH at cooking, decreased cooking temperature, increased storage temperature and increased storage time. Within the selected limits of variation of P /F ratio, fat did not affect exudation. However, an increase of moisture in non-fat substance resulted in an increased amount of exudate. The effect of homogenisation pressure appears {{to be due to}} the increase in the fat globule surface area and the increase in the coating of fat globule with casein. The partial heat-denaturation of the whey proteins in the cheesemilk was effective in reducing the rate of exudation, possibly due to the complex formation between 13 -lactoglobulin and K-casein that prevented fusion of casein micelles. Residual lactose and pH did not change, and proteolysis was not detected up to 16 weeks in Cream cheese stored at 5 · C. It is concluded that exudation from Cream cheese does not occur due to any gross chemical changes during storage. Manufacture of Feta cheese involved the use of recombined cow's milk and vacuum packaging of cheese after brining. A storage study of Feta cheese up to 6 months showed steady proteolysis, slow metabolism of residual lactose and a gradual decrease of pH. The water activity of the cheese depended on the salt-in-moisture concentration. In Feta cheese the amount of exudate increased with increased P /F ratio, i ncreased pH at draining, increased residual rennet, packaging cheese without vacuum, increased storage temperature and increased storage time. Variation of priming time, with a constant curd pH at draining, did not affect exudation. Unlike Cream cheese, an increase in protein and a decrease in fat content in Feta correlated with increase in the amount of exudate. The effects of change in pH and calcium (within a range expected in normal Feta) on exudation were minor. Homogenisation was effective in reducing the rate of exudation in Feta cheese. However, a variation in the homogenisation pressure had no effect. The type of material adsorbed to the fat globule surface influences syneresis during manufacture as well as subsequent exudation during storage. The effect of a reduction in the size of fat globules on exudation appears to be less important. In Feta cheese the incorporation of heat-denatured whey proteins did not affect exudation. However, there was a substantial increase in yield. Proteolysis is the dominant factor affecting exudation. Its influence is apparently due to the disintegration of the casein network and the release of water physically held in the capillaries. Exudation is also substantially influenced by the gradient in NaCl concentration in Feta cheese following brining. Denaturation of <b>whey</b> proteins in <b>Cream</b> cheese; and homogenisation, controlled proteolysis, decreased salt gradient, use of vacuum packaging in Feta cheese appear to be the main factors available for reducing the extent of exudation. Based on the findings of the investigation a hypothesis is proposed to explain the exudation from cheeses...|$|R
