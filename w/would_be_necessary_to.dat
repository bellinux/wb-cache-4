5|$|On January 23, 2014, {{officials}} announced {{the name of}} the flagship attraction would be Harry Potter and the Escape from Gringotts. They also indicated that a two-park pass <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> ride the Hogwarts Express, which was set to connect Universal Studios Florida with the existing Harry Potter attraction at Universal's Islands of Adventure.|$|E
5|$|Once the Regular Army {{had been}} {{organised}} as a continental Expeditionary Force, it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> provide forces for home defence. Haldane's proposal {{anticipated that the}} existing tripartite division of the Army - the Regular Army, the Volunteers/Yeomanry and the Militia - should be changed into a two-part structure, with an Expeditionary Force and a home-defence Territorial Force based on County Associations.|$|E
5|$|In 2008 Congress {{directed}} Amtrak {{to study}} resumption of service, which rekindled hope of restoration. Amtrak published a feasibility study in October 2009, which proposed restoring the North Coast Hiawatha to its 1979 route where possible with a daily schedule. Amtrak projected a yearly ridership of 359,800, {{some of whom}} would {{be drawn from the}} Empire Builder. Amtrak estimated that $1 billion in funds <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> relaunch the service, including over $300 million for new locomotives and rolling stock. The corporation estimated it would take four to five years to reintroduce the service if a decision was made to move forward.|$|E

5|$|In 2016, {{due to a}} {{mounting}} debt {{in funding}} of the athletic program, the university polled its students {{on whether or not}} they would approve an increase in tuition which <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> maintain the athletic program. There was a significant doubt that the students would approve this increase. Contrary to the predictions, a majority of the students approved a significant addition to their annual tuition to maintain the existence of the athletic program.|$|E
5|$|Laboratory {{tests have}} shown that the human eyeball is far too rigid to spontaneously change shape to a degree that <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> {{accomplish}} what Bates described. Exceedingly small changes in axial length of the eyeball (18.6–19.2 micrometres) are caused by the action of the ciliary muscle during accommodation. However, these changes are far too small to account for the necessary changes in focus, producing changes of only −0.036 dioptres.|$|E
5|$|Pendulum Publications {{produced}} {{one more}} issue in October 1947, shortly before going bankrupt and thus leaving New Worlds without a publisher. The magazine was saved {{by a group}} of sf fans who since 1946 had been meeting regularly on Thursday nights at the White Horse public house on New Fetter Lane, near Fleet Street. At one of those meetings it was suggested that they form a company to revive New Worlds; one of those present, Frank Cooper, recently retired from the RAF, agreed to look into what <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> start a new company.|$|E
50|$|The {{election}} on 10 December was declared invalid due to low turnout, with only 337 votes cast {{where more than}} 1800 <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> pass the 25% hurdle.|$|R

5000|$|The Certificate of Mastery (CIM) {{was created}} by report [...] "America's Choice: High Skills or Low Wages". The CIM has been called an outcome-based {{education}} diploma as it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> either <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> receive or replace the high school diploma, and was characteristic of education reform legislation in many states such as Washington and Oregon.|$|R
5|$|The {{shipping}} line operations of Cunard didn't escape review by Smallpeice. He was already {{familiar with the}} containerisation of freight prior to taking up his position with Cunard, but spent time during 1966 to visit the Sea-Land Service container terminal at Port Newark and further familiarised himself {{with the use of}} containers in marine traffic. Container ships were considered too large for the traditional British {{shipping line}}s, including Cunard and their subsidiaries to operate, so it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> form partnerships.|$|E
5|$|Design work on Kaiserin Augusta {{began in}} 1887; {{budgetary}} restrictions forced the German Navy {{to design a}} ship that could serve in both colonial and fleet scout roles. During the design process, it was determined a three-shaft arrangement of the machinery <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> attain the high speed requirement. This resulted in the first warship of the German Navy to use three screws. This was a relatively novel development; {{at the time of}} Kaiserin Augustas construction, only a handful of French and American ships had experimented with the arrangement, and had not yet been to sea for a thorough evaluation of the design. Kaiserin Augusta was laid down at the Germaniawerft shipyard in Kiel in 1890. She was launched on 15 January 1892 and commissioned into the fleet {{less than a year later}} on 17 November 1892.|$|E
5|$|Elephant Island was remote, uninhabited, {{and rarely}} visited by whalers {{or any other}} ships. If the party was to return to civilization it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> summon help. The only {{realistic}} way this could be done was to adapt one of the lifeboats for an 800-mile (1,300km) voyage across the Southern Ocean, to South Georgia. Shackleton had abandoned thoughts of taking the party on the less dangerous journey to Deception Island, because of the poor physical condition {{of many of his}} party. Port Stanley in the Falkland Islands was closer than South Georgia, but could not be reached, as this would require sailing against the strong prevailing winds.|$|E

5000|$|Simons {{believed}} that a financial system so structured <b>would</b> <b>be</b> [...] "repeatedly exposed to complete insolvency". In due course, government intervention <b>would</b> inevitably <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> forestall insolvency due to traders' bad bets and margin calls by lenders.|$|R
60|$|On perusing the letters, Stanley {{found that}} it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> {{absolutely}} <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> send a packet of dispatches to headquarters. The difficulties of his position required to be more thoroughly explained, and erroneous notions corrected.|$|R
5|$|Oslo {{announced}} in January 2004 that they, jointly with Lillehammer, planned {{to bid for}} the 2014 Winter Olympics. Deputy Mayor Svenn Kristiansen (Progress Party) speculated that normal hill ski jumping would be replaced with ski flying on the Olympic program and that it therefore <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> build a ski flying hill in Oslo. In November 2004, a Norwegian Ski Federation committee concluded that a new hill in Rødkleiva should be prioritized and that is would cost between NOK300 and 400 million. The following month Minister of Culture Valgerd Svarstad Haugland (Christian Democratic Party) criticized the federation for allowing Bertil Pålsrud and Steinar Johannesen to hold key roles in the decision process, while both owned a 13.3-percent stake in Rødkleiva Skiflyging.|$|E
5|$|Rosenborg had {{originally}} planned to build additional commercial facilities and a tower hotel during the 2002 construction, {{but this was}} canceled. At the 2011 annual meeting, the plans were again launched by Skutle, who stated that construction might start as early as 2011. In March 2005, Rosenborg announced {{plans to build a}} retractable roof over the pitch and lay artificial turf. The roof was estimated to cost NOK100 million, and the club estimated that it could generate NOK30 million per year in increased revenue from concerts and events. By 2007, the roof plans were delayed, with management stating that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> complete the construction of all stands before a roof was built, and that they believed the stadium would soon be expanded.|$|E
5|$|Caldwell {{is perhaps}} best {{known as one of}} the {{principal}} architects of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the first act of its kind in the world, signed into law on January 1, 1970. In drafting A National Policy on the Environment in 1968 as consultant to Senator Henry Jackson, the head of the powerful Senate Interior and Insular Affairs Committee, Caldwell realized that more was needed than a mere a policy statement: an “action-forcing mechanism” <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> secure federal agency compliance with the Act’s requirements. The origin of the requirement for preparation of an environmental impact statement (EIS) has been attributed to Caldwell, whose testimony at the Senate hearing in April 1969 laid the groundwork for inclusion of provisions requiring an evaluation of the effects of all major federal projects significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. In these “detailed statements,” as they were termed in the Act, all reasonably foreseeable social, economic, and environmental effects of a proposed action and any possible alternatives to it must be identified and assessed before any federal action takes place.|$|E

50|$|The {{suspended}} animation {{of three}} of the astronauts on board is accurately portrayed as worked out by consulting medical authorities. Such hibernation <b>would</b> likely <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> conserve resources on a flight of this kind, as Clarke's novelization implies.|$|R
5|$|Shackleton's {{original}} {{intention was}} to sail down to Cape Town, visiting the main South Atlantic islands on the way. From Cape Town, Quest would head for the Enderby Land coast of Antarctica where, once in the ice, it would explore the coastline towards Coats Land in the Weddell Sea. At {{the end of the}} summer season the ship would visit South Georgia before returning to Cape Town for refitting and preparation for the second year's work. The ship's performance in the early stages of the voyage disrupted this schedule. Serious problems with the engine necessitated a week's stay in Lisbon, and further stops in Madeira and the Cape Verde Islands. These delays and the slow speed of the ship led Shackleton to decide that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> sacrifice entirely the visits to the South Atlantic islands, and instead he turned the ship towards Rio de Janeiro, where the engine could receive a thorough overhaul. Quest reached Rio on 22 November 1921.|$|E
5|$|The Senate {{began work}} on its own {{proposals}} while the House was still working. The United States Constitution requires all revenue-related bills to originate in the House. To formally comply with this requirement, the Senate used H.R. 3590, a bill regarding housing tax changes for service members. It had been passed by the House as a revenue-related modification to the Internal Revenue Code. The bill became the Senate's vehicle for its healthcare reform proposal, discarding the bill's original content. The bill ultimately incorporated elements of proposals that were reported favorably by the Senate Health and Finance committees. With the Republican Senate minority vowing to filibuster, 60 votes <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> pass the Senate. At {{the start of the}} 111th Congress, Democrats had only 58 votes; the Senate seat in Minnesota ultimately won by Al Franken was still undergoing a recount, while Arlen Specter was still a Republican (he became a Democrat in April, 2009).|$|E
5|$|The root of {{the trouble}} was an {{economic}} crisis—initiated by the Panic of 1837—which was entering its sixth year in 1842. A speculative bubble had burst in 1836–39, causing a collapse of the financial sector and a subsequent depression. The country became deeply divided over the best response to the crisis. Conditions got even worse in early 1842 because a deadline was looming. A decade earlier, when the economy was strong, Congress had promised Southern states {{that there would be}} a reduction in hated federal tariffs. Northern states welcomed tariffs, which protected their infant industries. But the South had no industrial base and depended on open access to British markets for their cotton. In a recommendation to Congress, Tyler lamented that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> override the Compromise Tariff of 1833 and raise rates beyond the 20 percent limit. Under the previous deal, this would suspend the distribution program, with all revenues going to the federal government.|$|E

50|$|The X-33 {{was never}} {{intended}} to fly higher than an altitude of 100 km, nor faster than one-half of orbital velocity. Had any successful tests occurred, extrapolation <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> apply the results to a proposed orbital vehicle.|$|R
25|$|Realistically, {{the set of}} ravens is finite. The set of non-black {{things is}} either {{infinite}} or beyond human enumeration. In order to confirm the statement 'All ravens are black', it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> observe all ravens. This is difficult but possible. In order to confirm the statement 'All non-black things are non-ravens', it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> examine all non-black things. This is not possible. Observing a black raven {{could be considered a}} finite amount of confirmatory evidence, but observing a non-black non-raven would be an infinitesimal amount of evidence.|$|E
