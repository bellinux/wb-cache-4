40|$|This study {{examines}} {{issues related to}} women's leadership and administrative roles in higher educational settings where information technologies have a prominent function. In so doing, it addresses a relatively new area in leadership. The study focuses on four main questions: Are there parallels between feminist leadership styles and a new evolving field for leaders in technology? Is there something about technology that lends itself to female leadership styles? Has technology helped validate women's styles of leadership? <b>What</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> women entering the field now?Six women administrators, interviewed over a three-month period spoke {{on such issues as}} formal and informal relationships, collaborative team building, and getting the job done. This qualitative study focuses on educational leadership as a process rather than a product, and strives to gain {{a deeper understanding of the}} day-to-day experiences and leadership practices of women administrators in education. Drawing from feminist research studies, organizational theory and studies on women in educational leadership, the study offers to expand the existing discourse in educational leadership by documenting the ways this particular group of women practice leadership...|$|E

40|$|Historically, {{reforms and}} American {{schools have been}} closely intertwined. Currently, another reform, {{academic}} learning standards, is being implemented in most classrooms. Since the history surrounding school reform (Labaree 1999, Sarason 1990, Gibboney 1997, Fullan 1997) is not replete with success, {{it makes sense to}} question why yet another reform. Implementation becomes a key component of this study. Research portrays implementation as a process in which local actors redefine policy to fit local agendas (Spillane, 1998). Successful implementation requires mutual adaptation in which external policy is adapted to fit local conditions, and local conditions are adapted to fit policy (McLaughlin, 1990). Therefore, the implementation of academic learning standards may require close scrutiny if it is to succeed. ^ The {{purpose of this study is}} to document, describe and analyze the journey of students, teachers and a principal in an elementary school in Southeastern Pennsylvania as academic learning standards are implemented as a reform effort. The following questions are addressed: As a reform, how are academic learning standards implemented at the local level and <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> students, teachers and a principal? What kinds of structures are supported and created in this implementation process? ^ The data sources for this study are artifacts, fieldnotes, walkthrough data, student and teacher interviews and a principal 2 ̆ 7 s journal. The data are analyzed with a specific focus on understanding the participants 2 ̆ 7 lived experiences of the phenomenon (Marshall and Rossman, 1999). ^ The results indicate that the implementation of academic learning standards is a very complex process. The implementation process produces a tension between the creation of a shared vision around standards and autonomous decisions in the classroom. A teacher 2 ̆ 7 s teaching and learning practices may or may not be impacted. Also, in this era of accountability, teachers and administrators are influenced to create and use normative structures that demonstrate student learning. The study reveals that rubrics, as a normative structure of standards, may increase students 2 ̆ 7 capacity for controlling their learning and assessing their work. In addition, having access to ideas and knowledge about standards influences the flow of these ideas and knowledge within the school community. Finally, the study indicates that language is a key factor in a successful implementation process. ...|$|E
