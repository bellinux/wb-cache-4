5|$|Skis are lighter, {{narrower}} {{and designed}} to be faster than those used in recreational cross-country skiing and made of composite materials. For classic events, typical ski lengths are between 195 and 210 centimetres, while ski lengths for skating are 170 to 200cm. Skis for skating are also more rigid than skis for classical. Skis are <b>waxed</b> for speed and, {{in the case of}} classic skis, traction when striding forward. Racing ski boots are also lighter than recreational ones and are attached at the toe only to bindings that are specialized for classic or skate skiing.|$|E
5|$|The {{packaging}} {{has undergone}} many changes since its inception. Unlike McDonald's, the company {{never used the}} clamshell style box made of Styrofoam, so when the environmental concerns over Styrofoam {{came to a head}} in the late 1980s, the company was able to tout its use of paperboard boxes for its sandwiches. To cut back on the amount of paper that the company used, the paperboard box was fully eliminated in 1991 and was replaced with <b>waxed</b> paper. For a short time in 2002, the company used a gold-toned, aluminum foil wrapping for the sandwich as part of the 45th anniversary of the sandwich. The packaging was changed again in 2012 when the company moved to half wrapped sandwich packaged in a paper board box.|$|E
5|$|Around 2100UTC on September20, Gert made a final {{landfall}} at {{peak intensity}} {{on the coast}} of Mexico, just north of Tuxpan, Veracruz. The hurricane accelerated and weakened rapidly over the mountainous region of the Sierra Madre Oriental, diminishing to a tropical depression by September21. Despite the degeneration, the large circulation remained intact as it crossed the country. Gert exited the coast of Nayarit and entered the Pacific Ocean later that day, where the NHC reclassified it as Tropical Depression Fourteen-E. The remaining deep convection <b>waxed</b> and waned in intensity; satellite observations indicated the depression could have briefly been a tropical storm on September22. It continued a west to west-northwestward motion for two days, though low-level flow steered it toward the southwest after the convection diminished. There was no redevelopment due to cool sea temperatures, and the system dissipated at sea on September26.|$|E
50|$|A <b>wax</b> {{emulsion}} is {{a stable}} mixture {{of one or}} more <b>waxes</b> in water. <b>Waxes</b> and water are normally immiscible but can be brought together stably by the use of surfactants and a clever preparation process. Strictly speaking a <b>wax</b> emulsion should be called a <b>wax</b> dispersion since the <b>wax</b> is solid at room temperature. However, because the preparation takes place above the melting point of the <b>wax,</b> the actual process is called emulsification, hence the name <b>wax</b> emulsion.

50|$|Plants secrete <b>waxes</b> {{into and}} {{on the surface of}} their cuticles as a way to control evaporation, {{wettability}} and hydration. The epicuticular <b>waxes</b> of plants are mixtures of substituted long-chain aliphatic hydrocarbons, containing alkanes, alkyl esters, fatty acids, primary and secondary alcohols, diols, ketones, aldehydes. From the commercial perspective, the most important plant <b>wax</b> is carnauba <b>wax,</b> a hard <b>wax</b> obtained from the Brazilian palm Copernicia prunifera. Containing the ester myricyl cerotate, it has many applications, such as confectionery and other food coatings, car and furniture polish, floss coating, and surfboard <b>wax.</b> Other more specialized vegetable <b>waxes</b> include candelilla <b>wax</b> and ouricury <b>wax.</b>|$|R
5|$|Due {{to a lack}} of maintenance, the {{protective}} lacquer covering Knife Edge Two Piece degraded and exposed the surface of the sculpture to the elements. This resulted in oxidation of the bronze metal. Subsequent deterioration of the patination and years of graffiti scratched into the surface resulted in further corrosion. The conservation aimed to remove the remaining protective lacquer and surface dirt, and to remove the result of corrosion and oxidation from the sculpture, and take the surface back to the bare metal. Following the removal of graffiti the sculpture was repatinated to return it to its original colour. It was finally <b>waxed</b> with a weatherproof surface to protect it from future damage. The conservation work was undertaken by Rupert Harris Conservation, working in consultation with the Henry Moore Foundation. The cost of the conservation was £16,190, with £11,000 contributed by the Henry Moore Foundation.|$|E
5|$|Ear {{piercing}} {{and nose}} piercing {{have been particularly}} widespread and are well represented in historical records and among grave goods. The oldest mummified remains ever discovered were sporting earrings, attesting {{to the existence of}} the practice more than 5,000 years ago. Nose piercing is documented as far back as 1500 BC. Piercings of these types have been documented globally, while lip and tongue piercings were historically found in African and American tribal cultures. Nipple and genital piercing have also been practiced by various cultures, with nipple piercing dating back at least to Ancient Rome while genital piercing is described in Ancient India c. 320 to 550 CE. The history of navel piercing is less clear. The practice of body piercing has <b>waxed</b> and waned in Western culture, but it has experienced an increase of popularity since World War II, with sites other than the ears gaining subcultural popularity in the 1970s and spreading to mainstream in the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|The {{geometry}} of a back country ski {{depends on its}} purpose—skis suited for forested areas where loose powder can predominate may be shorter and wider than those selected for open, exposed areas where compacted snow may prevail. Sidecut on Telemark skis promotes turning in forest and rugged terrain. Width and short length aid turning in loose and deep snow. Longer, narrower and more rigid skis with sharp edges are suited for snow that has been compacted by wind or freeze-thaw. Touring ski design may represent a general-purpose compromise among these different ski conditions, plus being acceptable for use in groomed tracks. Traction may come from a textured or <b>waxed</b> grip zone, as with classic skis, or from ski skins, which are applied to the ski bottom for long, steep ascents and have hairs or mechanical texture that prevents sliding backwards.|$|E
40|$|On this {{research}} has been done the optimization of the batik <b>wax</b> waste utilization through batik <b>wax</b> making with blending method using bees <b>wax,</b> gum rosin, paraffin and lard. This research has been expected to be able to reduce the water pollution along with the decline in the quantity of batik solid waste which has been discharged into water bodies. However, research needs to be done regarding the quality of batik product resulting from a production process using <b>wax</b> which involves the use of batik <b>wax</b> waste. The batik product quality is determined by latched power, and the resistance of the <b>wax</b> against cracking and alkaline chemicals of batik <b>wax</b> product which has been used. The latched power test results from four groups of batik <b>wax</b> product showed the area with minimum latched power on temperature range of 50 - 70 ˚C for batik <b>wax</b> which have been made from blending of bees <b>wax,</b> <b>wax</b> waste, and gum rosin, 50 - 80 ˚C for batik <b>wax</b> which have been made from blending of bees <b>wax,</b> <b>wax</b> waste, and paraffin;  50 - 90 ˚C for batik <b>wax</b> which have been made from blending of bees <b>wax,</b> gum rosin and lard. Compared with <b>wax</b> product which have been made from blend of bees <b>wax,</b> <b>wax</b> waste and gum rosin as well as with paraffin, the batik <b>wax</b> product which have been made from the blend of bees <b>wax,</b> gum rosin and lard have lower resistance to cracking that has been observed from the occurance of yellow color on the fabric sample resulted from the dyeing process using yellow naphtol. The different result has been obtained from resistance test of the <b>wax</b> product against alkaline chemicals which showed that all kind of batik <b>wax</b> product resulted on {{this research}} have a good resistance against alkaline chemicals which has been observed from the absence of <b>wax</b> mass reduction of the fabric samples before and after treatment in the alkaline chemicals...|$|R

5|$|Tolerance, trade, and {{political}} {{relationships between the}} Arabs and the Christian states of Europe <b>waxed</b> and waned. Pilgrimages by Catholics to sacred sites were permitted, Christian residents in Muslim territories were given Dhimmi status, legal rights, and legal protection. These Christians were allowed to maintain churches, and marriages between faiths were not uncommon. The various cultures and creeds coexisted and competed, but the status quo was disrupted by the western migration of the Turkish tribes. The 1071 victory over the Byzantine army at the Battle of Manzikert was once considered a pivotal event by historians but is now regarded as only one further step in {{the expansion of the}} Great Seljuk Empire into Anatolia.

5|$|On July10, a {{tropical}} wave exited the African coast and moved westward over the open Atlantic for several days. Initially, the associated weather activity {{was limited to}} weak showers, and environmental conditions were not forecast to become conducive for significant organization. Although upper-level wind shear remained somewhat adverse, a process of slow development became evident by July19 as surface pressures began to fall. The wave proceeded along the extreme northeastern Caribbean, where convective activity <b>waxed</b> and waned due to periods of variable wind shear and brief land interaction with Hispaniola. By July22, thundershower activity reestablished over the Bahamas, with a distinct {{area of low pressure}} centered between the islands of Acklins and Great Inagua. Satellite observations confirmed a closed circulation, leading the National Hurricane Center (NHC) to issue the formation of Tropical Depression Three around 1500UTC. However, post-storm analysis indicated that a depression had developed nine hours earlier than operationally confirmed. Upon its formation, the depression was forecast to be steered to the west-northwest along a well-established subtropical ridge. Later that day, minimum pressure dropped to 1006mbar (29.74inHg), and satellite imagery showed an establishment of favorable outflow in nearly all quadrants. Although its cloud pattern remained disorganizedwith the circulation center disassociated from the deepest convectiona reconnaissance aircraft flight into the cyclone found that the winds had increased. It was therefore upgraded to Tropical Storm Bonnie southeast of Nassau, Bahamas, about five hours after NHC initiated advisories on the system.|$|E
5|$|The ITCZ became {{active in}} late March, {{spawning}} several areas of convection across the Indian Ocean {{and into the}} adjacent Australian basin. The westernmost system had a circulation as of March31 about 600km (370mi) west-southwest of Diego Garcia. Despite favorable conditions, the system failed to organize at first, although it became Tropical Disturbance 9 on April2 after the structure improved. Drifting to the southwest and later to the south, the associated convection <b>waxed</b> and waned, finally organizing more on April4; on that day, the disturbance quickly intensified into Moderate Tropical Storm Evariste. A day prior, the JTWC had initiated advisories on the system as Tropical Cyclone 18S. A trough to the south weakened the ridge, turning the storm to the southwest. A small eye formed on April5, but later dissipated after an increase in thunderstorm activity. On that day, the MFR estimated peak 10minute winds of 110km/h (70mph), just shy of tropical cyclone status, while the JTWC estimated 1minute winds of 140km/h (85mph). On April6, increased wind shear from the approaching trough began weakening Evariste and turned it to the south. That day, it passed about 135km (85mph) east of St. Brandon, and on April7, Evariste bypassed Rodrigues about 200km (125mi) to the southwest. The convection gradually deteriorated and left the circulation exposed. Late on April7, the storm suddenly turned southwestward toward a developing low east of Madagascar, although the southwest motion resumed soon after. On April8, Evariste dissipated, dissipating ahead of the nearby trough.|$|E

30|$|<b>Wax</b> {{deposits}} on {{the wall}} of a crude oil pipeline are a solid <b>wax</b> network of fine crystals, filled with oil, resin, asphaltene and other impurities. In this paper, a series of experiments on <b>wax</b> deposition in a laboratory flow loop were performed under different conditions (flow rate, temperature differential between crude oil and pipeline wall, and dissolved <b>wax</b> concentration gradient), and the <b>wax</b> deposits were analyzed, so quantitative relationships among <b>wax</b> content, <b>wax</b> appearance temperature (WAT), shear stress, and radial concentration gradient of dissolved <b>wax</b> at the solid/liquid interface were obtained. Finally, a model was established to predict WAT and the <b>wax</b> content of the deposit.|$|R
5|$|The {{subtropical}} storm tracked east-southeastward {{and continued}} to organize, and by late on April 20 an upper-level warm core was present over the system. Based on its organization, Ana is estimated to have become a tropical storm by 0000UTC on April 21. Upon becoming a tropical storm, Ana attained a peak intensity of 60mph (95km/h), {{which was based on}} estimates from the Hebert-Poteat technique and data from QuikSCAT. Shortly thereafter, it made its closest point of approach to Bermuda, when it passed about 130miles (210km) southwest of the island. Operationally, the cyclone was first classified by the National Hurricane Center around this time, when it was considered a subtropical cyclone. Strong upper-level wind shear removed much of the convection, though a small area of thunderstorms persisted near the center. The storm became completely separated from the upper-level system, and the cyclone re-organized, developing an eye feature late on April 21. Embedded within the flow of a cyclone to its north, Ana continued eastward, and early on April 22 the wind shear again removed the convection from the center. Convection <b>waxed</b> and waned throughout the day, and by April 23 the circulation had deteriorated in organization. After turning to the northeast, the circulation center merged with an approaching cold front on April 24, and Tropical Storm Ana completed the transition into an extratropical cyclone. The extratropical storm accelerated east-northeastward before losing its identity within the frontal zone on April 27 southeast of the Azores.|$|E

40|$|A {{large part}} of worlds {{remaining}} oil and gas resources is found in harsh environments such as deep water and arctic conditions. The development of such oil and gas fields requires advanced process and transport solutions. <b>Wax</b> is precipitated out of solution as reservoir fluid cools down during transport. <b>Wax</b> precipitation may cause operational problems when unprocessed well streams are transported in undersea pipelines. The goal of this work is to investigate modelling concept for controlled <b>wax</b> deposition and controlled <b>wax</b> loosening that is applicable to subsea flowlines in {{oil and gas production}} systems. An approach to <b>wax</b> control using the annulus pipe in pipe flow concept is modelled and also described. <b>Wax</b> thermodynamic and deposition models is reviewed and evaluated. The review is aimed to provide accurate prediction analysis of <b>wax</b> precipitation and to serve as a reliable knowledge input into <b>wax</b> deposition modelling in oil and gas flow systems. The cold flow concept for <b>wax</b> deposition solution is developed using an annulus pipe in pipe configuration for the cooling of oil below the <b>wax</b> appearance temperature. A <b>wax</b> deposition zone is created, an effect of a large temperature gradient, which is the driving force between cooling water and the flowing oil in the annulus cooling section of the pipeline. Co-current and counter current oil cooling cases is tested. The counter current annulus-cooling case is validated to adequately knock out potential <b>wax</b> from the oil in the <b>wax</b> deposition zone. The annulus cooling approach is considered to provide an efficient and economic <b>wax</b> control strategy for the mechanical removal of <b>wax</b> in a <b>wax</b> control zone when pigging of <b>wax</b> is to be employed in a flowline eliminating excessively long pigging routes and high cost of pigging operation in typical subsea pipelines. A wax-loosening model is further developed to determine potential loosening and potential transport tendencies of stable <b>wax</b> solids liberated from the wall flowline downstream the annulus. Experimental results from the Porsgrunn flow loop of Statoil AS reveals that stable <b>wax</b> solid is released from <b>wax</b> deposits on pipeline walls when the inner wall is heated {{for a short period of}} time such that released stable <b>wax</b> is transported in the cool stream with no or low tendency of re-deposition downstream the flowline. Deposited <b>wax</b> in the <b>wax</b> deposition zone is liberated using hot water sent through the annulus. Model results show re-deposition downstream the flowline. Ability of this <b>wax</b> deposition module to predict <b>wax</b> loosening is criticised. OLGA shows good representation of <b>wax</b> deposition growth in the annulus but incapable to represent expected <b>wax</b> liberation in the flowline at temperatures higher than the <b>wax</b> appearance temperature but below the dissolution temperature. A cold flow <b>wax</b> liberation model using active fluid forces with minimum wall heating for effective stripping of <b>wax</b> from the <b>wax</b> deposition zone is proposed. </p...|$|R
