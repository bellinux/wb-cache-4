Intuitively, one may assume that the problem’s complexity is highest around the chromatic number of the graph. We give substantial empirical evidence that this intuition is largely true, both for exact and heuristic graph coloring algorithms. We give a rigorous proof that the complexity of a class of exact algorithms is monotonously increasing in the number of available colors in the non-colorable case, and give a counter-example to demonstrate that the analogous claim does not always hold for colorable graphs.

40|$|A {{statistical}} thermodynamics approach is proposed to determine structurally and functionally important residues in native proteins {{that are involved}} in energy exchange with a ligand and other residues along an interaction pathway. The structurefunction relationships, ligand binding and allosteric activities of ten structures of HLA Class I proteins of the immune system are studied by the Gaussian Network Model. Five of these models are associated with inflammatory rheumatic disease and the remaining five are properly functioning. In the Gaussian Network Model, the protein structures are modeled as an elastic network where the inter-residue interactions are harmonic. Important residues and the interaction pathways in the proteins are identified by focusing on the largest eigenvalue of the residue interaction matrix.

40|$|Abstract Mathematical models {{ensuring}} a highly predictive power are of inestimable value in systems biology. Their application ranges from investigations of basic processes in living organisms up to model based drug {{design in the}} field of pharmacology. For this purpose simulation results have to be consistent with the real process, i. e, suitable model parameters have to be identified minimizing the difference between the model outcome and measurement data. In this <b>work</b> <b>graph</b> based methods are used to figure out if conditions of parameter identifiability are fulfilled. In combination with network centralities, the structural representation of the underlying mathematical model provides a first guess of informative output configurations. As at least the most influential parameters should be identifiable and to reduce the complexity of the parameter identification process further a parameter ranking is done by Sobol ’ indices. The calculation of these indices goes along with a highly computational effort, hence monomial cubature rules are used as an efficient approach of numerical integration.

40|$|Quality of Service (QoS) routing in {{computer}} networks {{is an important}} component in QoS architectures in order to provide end-to-end QoS support. Two major issues make QoS routing difficult: (1) Most of the QoS routing problems are NP-hard, such as the Delay Constraint Least Cost Routing (DCLCR) problem; (2) Imprecise network information degrades the routing performance. Using DCLCR problem as an example, we investigate the techniques for improving the performance of the existing ticket-based routing (TBR) algorithm, so that the negative impacts from the above two difficulties are reduced. There exist two major limitations in the existing TBR algorithm. First, the probing strategies are not optimized.

40|$|Systematic {{errors in}} {{perception}} and memory present {{a challenge to}} theories of perception and memory and to applied psychologists interested in overcoming them as well. A number of systematic errors in memory for maps and graphs are reviewed, and they are accounted for by {{an analysis of the}} perceptual processing presumed to occur in comprehension of maps and graphs. Visual stimuli, like verbal stimuli, are organized in comprehension and memory. For visual stimuli, the organization is a consequence of perceptual processing, which is bottom-up or data-driven in its earlier stages, but top-down and affected by conceptual knowledge later on. Segregation of figure from ground is an early process, and figure recognition later; for both, symmetry is a rapidly detected and ecologically valid cue. Once isolated, figures are organized relative to one another and relative to a frame of reference. Both perceptual (e. g., salience) and conceptual factors (e. g., significance) seem likely to affect selection of a reference frame. Consistent with the analysis, subjects perceived and remembered curves in graphs and rivers in maps as more symmetric than they actually were. Symmetry, useful for detecting and recognizing figures, distorts map and graph figures alike. Top-down processes also seem to operate in that calling attention to the symmetry vs. asymmetry of a slightly asymmetric curve yielded memory errors {{in the direction of the}} description. Conceptual frame of reference effects were demonstrated in memory for lines embedded in graphs. In earlier work, the orientation of map figures was distorted in memory toward horizontal or vertical. In recent <b>work,</b> <b>graph</b> lines, but not map lines, were remembered as closer to an imaginary 45 deg line than they had been. Reference frames are determined by both perceptual and conceptual factors, leading to selection of the canonical axes as a reference frame in maps, but selection of the imaginary 45 deg as a reference frame in graphs...|$|E
40|$|Among {{the vital}} {{problems}} {{in a variety of}} emerging applications is the graph matching problem, which is to determine whether two graphs are similar, and if so, find all the valid matches in one graph for the other, based on specified metrics. Traditional graph matching approaches are mostly based on graph homomorphism and isomorphism, falling short of capturing both structural and semantic similarity in real life applications. Moreover, it is preferable while difficult to find all matches with high accuracy over complex graphs. Worse still, the graph structures in real life applications constantly bear modifications. In response to these challenges, this thesis presents a series of approaches for ef?ciently solving graph matching problems, over both static and dynamic real life graphs. Firstly, the thesis extends graph homomorphism and subgraph isomorphism, respectively, by mapping edges from one graph to paths in another, and by measuring the semantic similarity of nodes. The graph similarity is then measured by the metrics based on these extensions. Several optimization problems for graph matching based on the new metrics are studied, with approximation algorithms having provable guarantees on match quality developed. Secondly, although being extended in the above <b>work,</b> <b>graph</b> matching is defined in terms of functions, which cannot capture more meaningful matches and is usually hard to compute. In response to this, the thesis proposes a class of graph patterns, in which an edge denotes the connectivity in a data graph within a predefined number of hops. In addition, the thesis defines graph pattern matching based on a notion of bounded simulation relation, an extension of graph simulation. With this revision, graph pattern matching is in cubic-time by providing such an algorithm, rather than intractable. Thirdly, real life graphs often bear multiple edge types. In response to this, the thesis further extends and generalizes the proposed revisions of graph simulation to a more powerful case: a novel set of reachability queries and graph pattern queries, constrained by a subclass of regular path expressions. Several fundamental problems of the queries are studied: containment, equivalence and minimization. The enriched reachability query does not increase the complexity of the above problems, shown by the corresponding algorithms. Moreover, graph pattern queries can be evaluated in cubic time, where two such algorithms are proposed. Finally, real life graphs are frequently updated with small changes. The thesis investigates incremental algorithms for graph pattern matching defined in terms of graph simulation, bounded simulation and subgraph isomorphism. Besides studying the results on the complexity bounds, the thesis provides the experimental study verifying that these incremental algorithms significantly outperform their batch counterparts in response to small changes, using real-life data and synthetic data.
