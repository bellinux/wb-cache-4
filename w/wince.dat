5|$|I sent MalcolmX {{some rough}} {{chapters}} to read. I was appalled {{when they were}} soon returned, red-inked in many places where he had told of his almost father-and-son relationship with Elijah Muhammad. Telephoning MalcolmX, I {{reminded him of his}} previous decisions, and I stressed that if those chapters contained such telegraphing to readers of what was to lie ahead, then the book would automatically be robbed of some of its building suspense and drama. MalcolmX said, gruffly, 'Whose book is this?' I told him 'yours, of course,' and that I only made the objection in my position as a writer. But late that night MalcolmX telephoned. 'I'm sorry. You're right. I was upset about something. Forget what I wanted changed, let what you already had stand.' I never again gave him chapters to review unless I was with him. Several times I would covertly watch him frown and <b>wince</b> as he read, but he never again asked for any change in what he had originally said.|$|E

25|$|There {{have been}} few shrewder captains than Ian Chappell, {{who knew how to}} squeeze the last drop out of any {{situation}} that might help give his team an advantage. He was an absolute master at putting pressure on the opposition with just the right run rate or with a field that could be almost impossible to pierce... Some of his tactics were quite intimidatory and stank of out-and-out gamesmanship that made old pros like me <b>wince.</b> It was an open secret that he used to encourage his players to give a lot of verbal abuse to rival batsman when they were at the wicket in an attempt to break their concentration.|$|E

Reviewers in The Sunday Times called the episode [...] "another corker", and the freelance journalist Dan Owen called the episode [...] "easily the funniest" [...] since [...] "La Couchette", awarding it {{three out of four}} stars.

[...] Soon afterwards, the band wrote and recorded [...] "Exit Music (For a Film)"; the track plays over the film's end credits but was excluded from the soundtrack album at the band's request. The song helped shape {{the direction of the}} rest of the album; Yorke said it [...] "was the first performance we'd ever recorded where every note of it made my head spinâ€”something I was proud of, something I could turn up really, really loud and not <b>wince</b> at any moment." ...|$|E
500|$|Hip {{dysplasia}} [...] is a hereditary condition {{which occurs}} in most dog breeds to some extent, according to scores from a 2001 UK Kennel Club scheme, the Clumber Spaniel has the second worst breed mean scores. Furthermore, {{a survey conducted}} by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals found that 45.7% of Clumber Spaniels tested were affected by the condition. Initial signs are usually first noted when the dog is between five and twelve months old, and may include a swaying hindleg gait, hindleg lameness, muscle wastage around the hindquarters, reluctance to and fatigue during exercise, inability to climb stairs or jump up. The dog can appear hunched up with an arched back, and in the very worst cases may <b>wince</b> with pain when moving its hindlegs. Medical treatment can vary from the administration of painkillers to surgical correction depending on the severity of the condition.|$|E

He {{attended}} Auckland Grammar School, and won a scholarship to Auckland University College (now the University of Auckland) a year before he was due to finish high school. Faced with a choice between studying history or the sciences, he chose the latter {{because he had a}} severe stammer and thought that it would be less of an impediment. He completed both a Bachelor's degree and a Master's qualification in science, securing Honours in both mathematics and physics, finishing his studies in 1937. Despite these achievements, he did not consider himself to be practically trained, saying: [...] "I was still very much a theorist, with no practical physics at all.

500|$|The episode {{has been}} met with {{critical}} acclaim {{since it has}} aired and {{is considered one of}} the best episodes of The Office by many critics. Travis Fickett of IGN wrote that [...] "this is one of those great episodes of The Office that is hysterical and difficult to watch at the same time." [...] He noted that this was largely due to the fact that [...] "it's not because of something Michael is doing that makes you <b>wince.</b> It's because of what's happening to him." [...] He ultimately gave the episode an 8.9/10, denoting a [...] "great" [...] episode. Jay Black of AOL's TV Squad said that [...] " [...] was happy The Office was back" [...] but [...] "the only thing [...] worried about was whether it'd still be good" [...] after the writers strike. However, he noted that his fears were put to rest and that [...] "Dinner Party" [...] was [...] "a Barry Bond's-style [...] chemically enhanced mega-home-run." [...] M. Giant of Television Without Pity graded this episode with an [...] "A." [...] Aubry D'Arminio of Entertainment Weekly said that her favorite moment of the episode [...] "was when Jan popped on that song by her former assistant, Hunter." ...|$|E
500|$|Rolling Stone {{contributor}} Doug Pratt {{called it}} a [...] "high point" [...] of the first season. Kinney Littlefield of the Orange County Register said of the episode, [...] "All this proves once again that animated series are great platforms for hot topics that live action shows don't dare grab head on. South Park allegory {{of good and evil}} is more apt and knowing than anything seen on Christy or Touched by an Angel. Funnier too." [...] However, Littlefield also said some of the show's graphic dialogue, like the phrase [...] "poop on a stick", was growing [...] "pretty darn redundant". Gary Budzak of The Columbus Dispatch described the [...] "Damien" [...] episode as perhaps [...] "the most outrageous yet". Virginia Rohan of The Record praised the episode, saying, [...] "The episode is funny, and ultimately, good does conquer evil, albeit for all the wrong reasons." [...] Chicago Sun-Times writer Lon Grahnke gave the episode three stars and called it simultaneously strange and funny. Eric Mink of the New York Daily News called the episode [...] "awfully funny" [...] and praised its satirical element, although he warned it was potentially very offensive to some viewers: [...] "A scene in which the kids offer profane between-rounds encouragement to Jesus could make even thick-skinned viewers <b>wince</b> a bit." [...] Likewise, Star-Ledger reporter Matt Zoller Seitz said, [...] "Tonight's episode is crazy, vulgar and borderline blasphemous; it is also, if you're in the right frame of mind, paralyzingly funny." ...|$|E
500|$|In the team's {{original}} plan, Terra Nova {{consisted of}} missions that were bookended by simplistic cutscenes, akin {{to those of}} the 1990 Origin Systems video game Wing Commander. However, in 1994, Origin released , which features live-action full-motion video (FMV) cutscenes. This pressured Looking Glass into incorporating FMV into Terra Nova. Schmidt later said, [...] "Lots of A-list games were including more and more FMV, and it was felt by management that if Terra Nova didn't have any, it would look second-rate." [...] The decision to include it came when the game was already overdue, and {{a large portion of the}} game's funding was redirected toward cutscene production. A scriptwriter from outside the company was hired to write the cutscenes; because of the interplay between the cutscenes and missions, the script underwent numerous rewrites. The game's delays and large budget resulted in the removal of a planned online multiplayer component, and the FMV cutscenes, which were expensive to produce, increased the number of sales needed to recoup development costs. A patch was planned to release post-launch in September 1996 and add the online multiplayer functionality, but it did not materialize. Schmidt called the cutscenes a [...] "giant distraction" [...] for the team and himself as project leader: he later described them as [...] "cheesier than most" [...] of those from the period and noted that [...] "I <b>wince</b> a lot looking back on [...] ". Schmidt believed that they were likely an error from a business standpoint, as they further increased the game's budget and production length, but ultimately did not increase sales.|$|E

500|$|Francis {{received}} generally negative {{reviews for}} her portrayal. Jamey Giddens of Zap2it {{wrote of the}} decision to sign Francis onto the series: [...] "Maria Arena Bell just made Brian Frons kick a puppy in the face." [...] After her debut, he called Francis' portrayal of Genevieve [...] "embarrassingly-bad", stating: [...] "I'm sure I will catch hell for going here about a daytime treasure, but Francis' portrayal of Cane and Caleb's (Daniel Goddard) unhinged mother has been cartoonish and abysmal from her first air show. I don't know if Francis is painfully attempting to channel the late Elizabeth Taylorâ€™s fun, campy turn as Luke and Laura's arch nemesis Helena Cassadine on General Hospital 30 years ago, or going for Evil-Lyn from the old He-Man and the Masters of the Universe cartoon, but she's missing the mark either way." [...] He also wrote that as much as he would [...] "love to solely blame this performance on the writingâ€”because letâ€™s face it, the story is dreadfulâ€”Francis is the one making the choices to jerk, gasp and <b>wince</b> as Genevieve registers each and every emotion or painful memory. This is not the Genie Francis we know and love." [...] Adam Hughes of Yahoo! wrote of viewers' reactions to Francis' debut and her portrayal, stating: [...] "Since Francis arrived on the scene this spring, fan reaction to her revised on-screen attitude has been a mixed bag, but she continues to draw a ton of interest to her new CBS television digs. Former General Hospital followers may find her more biting character hard to swallow, and longtime fans of The Young and The Restless have watched her push aside some of their favorites, but Francis has undoubtedly shaken up the local landscape. Buzz is half the game when comes to keeping soap opera fans interested, and Francis has certainly delivered that." ...|$|E

500|$|Carey's {{performance}} was recorded on March 16, 1992 at Kaufman Astoria Studios in Queens, New York. The show featured {{a number of}} musicians, back-up vocalists and just a crew of ten, for filming and recording. Directed by Larry Jordan, who previously worked with Carey on the music video for [...] "Someday". Dana Jon Chapelle {{was chosen as the}} sound mixer, having worked with Carey on her previous two studio albums. The show began with the song [...] "Emotions" [...] Carey entered the studio dressed in a black jacket and matching pants and boots. Prior to the song's studio introduction, Carey opened the song with an impromptu gospel and a cappella number, eventually leading to the song's chorus led by David Cole. After the song, Carey introduced the band and staff; to her left was a four-piece string section with Belinda Whitney Barnett, Cecilia Hobbs-Gardner, <b>Wince</b> Garvey and Laura Corcos, while San Shea played the harpsichord and harmonium. The show's rhythm section was led by Gigi Conway on the drums, Randy Jackson on bass, Vernon Black on guitar, and Sammy Figueroa and Ren Klyce, both percussionists. Additionally, Carey had ten background singers on stage, led by Trey Lorenz and Patrique McMillan. The next song on the set-list was [...] "If It's Over", a collaboration with Carole King. Walter Afanasieff replaced Cole on the piano, during which time a set of five male musicians were brought on stage. They were Lew Delgado, baritone saxophone; Lenny Pickett, tenor saxophone; George Young, alto saxophone; Earl Gardner, trumpet; and Steve Turre, trombone. They had been present during Carey's live performance of the song on Saturday Night Live a few months prior. As Carey introduced the song, she said [...] "this next song I wrote with one of my idols, Carole King", beginning the performance shortly after. For [...] "Someday", Cole returned to the stage, replacing Afanasieff on the keyboard. During the song, Carey would often place her index finger over her left ear, especially while using the whistle register. She later explained to the audience that it would help her in hearing herself more precisely, something needed to properly execute a higher ranged note. Once again, as Carey began [...] "Vision of Love", her [...] "first single ever", Afansieff swapped positions with Cole. The performance varied heavily from the studio version, as it was more low key and only used voices in a cappella form, without any heavy instrumentation. Prior to beginning the fifth song on the set-list, [...] "Make It Happen", Afanasieff shared the organ with Cole, playing the bass while the latter handled the treble. After the song began, the back-up began [...] "piling their vocals" [...] over Carey's, according to author Chris Nickson, and allowed the song to attain a more [...] "churchy feel". He felt the song was superior to the studio version, due to its stripped performance and vocals: ...|$|E
