5|$|Rosalind, Perowne's wife, is {{the last}} to arrive home. As she enters, Baxter and an {{accomplice}} 'Nige' force their way in armed <b>with</b> <b>knives.</b> Baxter punches the grandfather, intimidates the family and orders Daisy to strip naked. When she does, Perowne notices that she is pregnant. Finding out she is a poet, Baxter asks her to recite a poem. Rather than one of her own, she recites Dover Beach, which affects Baxter emotionally, effectively disarming him. Instead he becomes enthusiastic about Perowne's renewed talk about new treatment for Huntington's disease. After his companion abandons him, Baxter is overpowered by Perowne and Theo, and knocked unconscious after falling down the stairs. That night Perowne is summoned {{to the hospital for}} a successful emergency operation on Baxter. Saturday ends at around 5:15a.m. on Sunday, after he has returned from the hospital and made love to his wife again.|$|E

5|$|The last Texian {{group to}} remain in the open were Crockett and his men, {{defending}} the low wall in front of the church. Unable to reload, they used their rifles as clubs and fought <b>with</b> <b>knives.</b> After a volley of fire and a wave of Mexican bayonets, the few remaining Texians in this group fell back towards the church. The Mexican army now controlled all of the outer walls and the interior of the Alamo compound except for the church and rooms along the east and west walls. Mexican soldiers turned their attention to a Texian flag waving from the roof of one building. Four Mexicans were killed before the flag of Mexico was raised in that location.|$|E
5|$|Inspired by the Halo {{video game}} series, Troy Hurtubise, {{known for his}} anti-bear suits, {{developed}} a real counterpart to the MJOLNIR powered assault armor, named the Trojan. The suit is functional and its capabilities were inspired by those present in the video games versions of the armor. The armor's features include a system that purifies air, powered by solar panels located in the helmet, equipment for weapon transportation, a recording system, emergency illumination, and a transponder that can be activated if the wearer is in serious jeopardy. The armor offers protection against attacks <b>with</b> <b>knives,</b> blunt objects, and small explosions and is bulletproof. Hurtubise expressed that {{he is able to}} improve this design for use in the military for a price of 2,000 dollars per piece. Non-functional replicas of the MJOLNIR powered assault armor have also been created by hobbyists; a Spike TV pre-Halo 3 special profiled some of these dedicated fans.|$|E
5|$|Not {{knowing that}} Okello had given orders to kill no whites, the Americans living in Stone Town {{fled to the}} English Club, where the point for {{evacuation}} was. Those travelling in the car convoy to the English Club were shocked to see the battered bodies of Arab men lying {{out on the streets}} of Stone Town with their severed penises and testicles shoved into their mouths. As part of Okello's carefully laid out plans, all over the island, gangs of Africans armed <b>with</b> <b>knives,</b> spears and pangas (machetes) went about systemically killing all the Arabs they could find. The American diplomat Don Petterson described his horror as he watched from his house as he saw a gang of African men storm the house of an Arab, behead him in public with a panga, followed by screams from within his house as {{his wife and three children}} were raped and killed, followed by the same scene being repeated at the next house of an Arab, followed by yet another and another. After taking control of Stone Town on the first day, the revolutionaries continued to fight the Manga for control of the countryside for least two days afterwards with whole families of Arabs being massacred after their homes had been stormed.|$|E

5|$|San Martín {{moved the}} {{regiment}} from Retiro to Rosario, nearing {{the river at}} San Pedro and San Nicolás. He was following the Spanish ships and moved at night to avoid detection. San Martín had one hundred and twenty men for this action, reinforced at Rosario by a militia of seventy men {{under the command of}} Celedonio Escalada. Those reinforcements included twenty two rifleman, thirty cavalry, a small cannon and men armed <b>with</b> <b>knives.</b> Escalada had made other actions against the royalists before this battle. San Martín discovered that the royalists intended to pillage the San Carlos Convent and pressed the march to arrive there first. A hundred royalists landed on San Lorenzo, but the only food available to them was some chickens and watermelons. Aware of the risk of pillage, the population had removed the cattle from the area before the royalists arrived. Escalada arrived in San Lorenzo before the bulk of the patriot army, but the dust trail from the path to Rosario revealed their presence. Escalada attacked them but their ship had a longer range than his cannon, keeping him at bay. He was forced to retire when he found a Paraguayan prisoner who had escaped from the ship. The Paraguayan disclosed the size of the royalist army and their plan of attacking the convent with a larger force, suspecting that the local money was kept in it. They did not attack the convent right away, requiring time to prepare the two field cannons. Escalada returned with San Martin and relayed the news. The march from Retiro to the convent took only five days, thanks to the cadet Ángel Pacheco. Pacheco moved ahead of the regiment and prepared horses in advance at the relay positions. The whole army arrived on scene during the night of 2 February and hid inside the convent. They entered through the rear door and were not allowed to light fires or speak during the night. San Martín studied the enemy and the battlefield from the convent's tower, using a monocular.|$|E
