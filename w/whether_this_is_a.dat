In exceptional circumstances involving an attempt to abolish judicial review or the ordinary role of the courts, the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords or a new Supreme Court may have to consider <b>whether</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> constitutional fundamental which even a sovereign Parliament acting {{at the behest of}} a complaisant House of Commons cannot abolish.|$|E
5|$|Morchella importuna is {{a species}} of fungus in the family Morchellaceae {{described}} from North America in 2012. It occurs in gardens, woodchip beds, and other urban settings of northern California and the Pacific Northwest region of the United States and Canada. The fungus has also been reported from Turkey, Spain, France, Switzerland, Canada and China, although it is unknown <b>whether</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> result of accidental introductions. It is considered a choice edible mushroom. The fruit bodies develop a distinctive ladder-like pattern of pits and ridges {{on the surface of}} their conical caps.|$|E
5|$|Mimesis or cryptic {{aggressive}} mimicry {{is where}} the predator mimics an organism that its prey is indifferent to. Unlike in all cases above, the predator is ignored by the prey, allowing it to avoid detection until the prey are close enough for the predator to strike. This is effectively a form of camouflage. The zone-tailed hawk (Buteo albonotatus), which resembles the turkey vulture (Cathartes aura), may provide one such example. It flies amongst them, suddenly breaking from the formation and ambushing its prey. Here the hawk's presence is of no evident significance to the vultures, affecting them neither negatively or positively. There is some controversy over <b>whether</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> true case of mimicry.|$|E

5|$|In their {{original}} description, Krause and colleagues suggested that Lavanify was most {{closely related to}} the then-unnamed Indian sudamericid. They based this proposed relationship on the shared presence of prominent, continuous bands of IPM. The teams who named the Indian gondwanathere in 2007 both agreed with this proposed relationship. In their description of Dakshina, Wilson and colleagues added the presence of an infundibulum and of perikymata to the evidence for the relationship between the two. These three characters are synapomorphies (shared derived traits) for the Bharattherium-Lavanify clade. They also share the presence of furrows on the lingual side of the teeth only, but <b>whether</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> derived feature is uncertain. Wilson and colleagues list two autapomorphies (unique derived traits) of Lavanify: presence of a V-shaped dentine island and absence of enamel {{on one side of the}} crown. Prasad and colleagues who named Bharattherium, noted the absence of enamel on part of the crown of a Bharattherium tooth and interpreted this trait as a synapomorphy of Bharattherium and Lavanify. They also mentioned the presence of a furrow and infundibulum as shared traits.|$|E

25|$|Nowadays, most {{developed}} countries have systems to provide pensions on retirement in old age, {{which may be}} sponsored by employers or the state. In many poorer countries, support for the old is still mainly provided through the family.

25|$|The form crocodrillus is attested in Medieval Latin. It is {{not clear}} <b>whether</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> medieval {{corruption}} or derives from alternative Greco-Latin forms (late Greek corcodrillos and corcodrillion are attested). A (further) corrupted form cocodrille is found in Old French and was borrowed into Middle English as cocodril(le). The Modern English form crocodile was adapted directly from the Classical Latin crocodīlus in the 16th century, replacing the earlier form. The use of -y- in the scientific name Crocodylus (and forms derived from it) is a corruption introduced by Laurenti (1768).|$|E
25|$|Other {{risk factors}} that {{influence}} the development of alcohol abuse or alcoholism include social and genetic factors. Several {{researchers have found that}} starting drinking before the age of 15 is associated with a fourfold increased risk for developing alcoholism compared to people that delay drinking until age 20 or later. It has been estimated by some that if the age at which people started drinking could be delayed to age 20, there would be a 50 percent {{reduction in the number of}} cases of alcohol use disorder. However, it is unclear <b>whether</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> causal relationship, or a function of confounding familial (and other) factors associated with both age at first drink and propensity for alcoholism.|$|E

25|$|Bronze Age rock carvings {{may contain}} {{some of the}} {{earliest}} depictions of well-known gods from the later Norse mythology. A common figure in these rock carvings is that of a male figure carrying what appears to be an axe or hammer. This may have been an early representation of Thor. Other male figures are shown holding a spear. <b>Whether</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> representation of Odin or Týr is not known. It is possible the figure may have been a representation of Tyr, as one example of a Bronze Age rock carving appears to show a figure missing a hand. A figure holding a bow may be an early representation of Ullr. Or it is possible that these figures were not gods at all, but men brandishing the weapons of their culture.|$|E
25|$|Nephila display large sexual size {{dimorphism}} with females being greatly {{larger than}} males, sometimes {{up to ten}} times the size. There is debate as to <b>whether</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> result of male dwarfism or female gigantism. Smaller males may be selected for due {{to the presence of}} competition for mating. Smaller males are quicker and more nimble, allowing {{them to be able to}} catch the females more easily as well as escape when threatened. Larger males may have to wait for the female to come close due to their slower speed. Larger females may have been selected for as a result of males using mating plugs upon copulation. Larger individuals reduce the success of these plugs, allowing for multiple mating and reducing the risk of genital mutilation. Gigantism in females is also associated with fecundity, larger individuals can produce more eggs and therefore increase reproductive success.|$|E
25|$|Readers of the Historia Francorum {{must decide}} <b>whether</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> royal history and whether Gregory was writing to please his patrons. It {{is likely that}} one royal Frankish house is more generously treated than others. Gregory was also a Catholic bishop, and his writing reveals views typical of someone in his position. His views on {{perceived}} dangers of Arianism (still strong among the Visigoths) led him to preface the Historia with a detailed expression of his orthodoxy {{on the nature of}} Christ. In addition, his ridiculing of pagans and Jews reflected how his works were used to spread the Christian faith. For example, in book 2, chapters 28-31, he describes the pagans as incestuous and weak and then describes the process by which newly converted King Clovis leads a much better life than that of a pagan and is healed of all the conundrums he experienced as a pagan.|$|E
