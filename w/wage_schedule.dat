30|$|Proposition 4 {{offers an}} {{implication}} for wage rigidity. Future <b>wages</b> <b>scheduled</b> {{to be paid}} in the next period during which layoffs do not occur will not affect the current efforts of workers in Period 1. This is because the workers will necessarily receive the wages without being laid off in the next period, regardless of their effort levels in Period 1. Thus, the firm cannot control workers’ efforts in Period 1 by their future <b>wages</b> <b>scheduled</b> to be paid in booms, which results in lower, or at least less downwardly rigid, regular pay during booms.|$|R

50|$|The {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with a risk-neutral employer. The offered wage is the expected marginal product. Signals may be acquired by sustaining signalling costs (monetary and not). If everyone invests in the signal in the exactly the same way, then the signal can't used as discriminatory, therefore a critical assumption is made: the costs of signalling are negatively correlated with productivity. This situation as described is a feedback loop: the employer updates his beliefs upon new market information and updates the <b>wage</b> <b>schedule,</b> applicants react by signalling and recruitment takes place.|$|E

30|$|In contrast, the {{contingent}} wages {{of workers in}} Period 2, in which layoffs do not occur (i.e., wages with γ (p)[*]=[*] 0), do not affect the efforts of workers in Period 1. This is because workers in Period 1 will necessarily receive the wages without being laid off, regardless of their current levels of effort. Thus, when γ (p)[*]=[*] 0, only the current piece rate can affect the incentives of workers in Period 1. For example, if layoffs occur only in a recession, <b>wages</b> <b>scheduled</b> to be paid during a recession will affect the levels of effort in Period 1, while <b>wages</b> <b>scheduled</b> to be paid during booms will not.|$|R
50|$|OPM prescribes basic {{policies}} and procedures to ensure uniform pay-setting. OPM specifies procedures for agencies to design and conduct wage surveys, to construct <b>wage</b> <b>schedules,</b> to grade levels of work, and to administer basic and premium pay for employees.|$|R
30|$|In contrast, future <b>wages</b> <b>scheduled</b> {{to be paid}} in {{the next}} period during which layoffs occur affect efforts of workers in Period 1, since the workers will receive the wages only when they work hard in Period 1 and avoid being laid off. Thus, the higher the <b>wages</b> <b>scheduled</b> to be paid in regressions, the harder the workers will work. This gives the firm an {{incentive}} to pay high regular pay in periods during which layoffs occur. As a result, the regular pay of workers in Period 2 has a lower-bound, equal to the layoff costs when the output price is low enough that layoffs occur, while the regular pay can be below the layoff costs when the output price is high enough that layoffs do not occur. In this way, the downward wage rigidity in this model during recessions occurs through a channel wherein a low output price increases the probability of (performance-based) layoffs.|$|R

Moreover, in case of piece-rate pay scheme, social welfare under RTM exceeds that under EB, if the union is very strong. It also shows that, under EB, in case of piece-rate <b>wage</b> <b>schedule</b> output, union’s payoff, profit, and social welfare are higher, but employment is lower than fixed wage pay scheme.

40|$|This paper {{estimates}} the causal e¤ect of unionization {{on the distribution}} of employee earnings using a regression discontinuity design based on union certi…cation elections. The results suggest unions raise {{the lower end of the}} distribution by around 25 percent, with a much smaller, even negative e¤ect on the upper tail, and little e¤ect on average earnings. Results on worker retention suggest unions decrease turnover among lower-productivity workers, but increase it among higher-productivity workers. The empirical results are consistent with a model of the political economy of union wage setting in which unions pursue a <b>wage</b> <b>schedule</b> to maximize the probability of winning a certi…cation election, subject to a minimum pro…t constraint for the employer. The optimal union <b>wage</b> <b>schedule</b> pays low-skilled workers above marginal product but reduces the return to skill. The estimates suggest that around 13. 5 percent of the increase in the variance of log earnings from 1979 to 2009 can be accounted for by falling U. S. private sector unionization rates...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{provides}} a formal analysis of how managerial investment incentives {{are affected by}} alternative allocation rules when managerial compensation is based on accounting measure of income which include allocations for investment expenditures. The major result is that a unique allocation rule exists, called the relative marginal benefits (RAB) rule, which always induces the manager to choose the efficient investment, {{no matter how the}} manager values his own personal cash flows from wage compensation over time and no matter what <b>wage</b> <b>schedule</b> is in place (so long as wages are weakly increeasing each period's income). That is, the same allocation rule works for every possible managerial utility function over wage payments and every monotone wage function over accounting incomes. Thus the firm can choose an allocation rule which induces efficient investment choices without knowing the manager's preferences. Furthermore, since the same rule works for every monotone <b>wage</b> <b>schedule,</b> the firm is left a "degree of freedom" to choose the <b>wage</b> <b>schedule</b> to solve some other incentive problem. In addition to demonstrating the optimality of the RMB rule and describing its properties, the paper considers how currently used allocation rules qualitatively affect managers' investment incentives. It is shown that the practice of expensing intangible assets (i. e., allocating 100 percent of the cost to the current perios) causes mangers to underinvest relative to the efficient level. The case of tangible assets is more complicated. It appears that current practices may cause either underinvestment or overinvestment, depending on various factor described in more detail in the text. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{examining}} {{the history of}} Australian apprentices, the paper finds that the term ‘Australian apprentices’ can encompass employees {{in a wide variety}} of occupations and training with differing qualifications. It finds however, that from a wage-setting perspective, wage arrangements still distinguish between what are ‘traditional trades’ employees (apprentices) from non traditional trades employees (trainees). The report thus distinguishes between these two groups. In relation to apprentices, the paper finds that take up rates of apprenticeships have tended to increase over ten years to 2009, although attrition occurrences were higher than completions in the same time frame. In {{examining the}} 122 modern awards in the national system the paper finds that 46 contain rates of pay and provisions for apprentices, typically expressed as a percentage of the tradespersons rate. Provisions for competency-based wage and training progression for apprentices were also examined and it was found that competency-based training progression is facilitated by wage arrangements in some select modern awards in the national system. Findings from qualitative research into competency-based wage progression for apprentices indicated that its operation varied according to the level of cooperation and communication between the employer, apprentice and the registered training organisation. The application of competency-based wage progression arrangements differed among employer participants according to a range of factors, with the research indicating that accelerated progression through training and wage levels was greatly influenced by the employer participant’s assessment of performance in the workplace. In respect of trainees the report finds that commencements in traineeships either increased or remained steady over the ten years to 2009. Completions overtook attrition occurrences in 2004 and the gap widened in the years to 2009. Trainees in the national system typically rely on the National Training <b>Wage</b> <b>schedule</b> for their wage rates which is attached to 100 of the 122 modern awards. The paper finds some modern awards set wages for trainees which are separate from the National Training <b>Wage</b> <b>schedule</b> and  some trainees who are trained under state developed qualifications may not have coverage under the National Training <b>Wage</b> <b>schedule.</b> The report also identifies an issue concerning changing relativities in the National Training <b>Wage</b> <b>schedule</b> due to the application of a historical adjustment method over time.

At the beginning of the employment relationship, the worker encounters opportunities to enhance his or her specific human capital.
