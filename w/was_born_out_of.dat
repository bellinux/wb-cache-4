5|$|It is {{also from}} the Neolithic, in about 3000 BC, that we glimpse the first known {{illustrations}} of plants and read descriptions of impressive gardens in Egypt. However protobotany, the first pre-scientific written record of plants, did not begin with food; it <b>was</b> <b>born</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the medicinal literature of Egypt, China, Mesopotamia and India. Botanical historian Alan Morton notes that agriculture was the occupation {{of the poor and}} uneducated, while medicine was the realm of socially influential shamans, priests, apothecaries, magicians and physicians, who were more likely to record their knowledge for posterity.|$|E
5|$|Lincoln's mother, Nancy, {{is widely}} {{assumed to have}} been the {{daughter}} of Lucy Hanks, although no record of Nancy Hanks' birth has ever been found. According to William Ensign Lincoln's book The Ancestry of Abraham Lincoln, Nancy was the daughter of Joseph Hanks; however, the debate continues over whether she <b>was</b> <b>born</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> wedlock. Still another researcher, Adin Baber, claims that Nancy Hanks was the daughter of Abraham Hanks and Sarah Harper of Virginia.|$|E

5|$|The Komnenian era <b>was</b> <b>born</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> {{a period}} of great {{difficulty}} and strife for the Byzantine Empire. Following {{a period of}} relative success and expansion under the Macedonian dynasty (c. 867–c. 1054), Byzantium experienced several decades of stagnation and decline, which culminated in a vast deterioration in the military, territorial, economic and political situation of the Byzantine Empire by the accession of Alexios I Komnenos in 1081.|$|E
5|$|The Quatermass Memoirs is a British radio drama-documentary, {{originally}} {{broadcast in}} 5 episodes on BBC Radio 3 in March 1996. Written by Nigel Kneale, it <b>was</b> <b>born</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> his Quatermass series of films and television serials, which had first been broadcast in the 1950s. The {{idea for the}} show appeared as BBC radio intended to create a season of programming {{looking back at the}} 1950s, and it was the final piece of writing Kneale completed relating to the character.|$|E
5|$|Although Tsukudani kept a {{notebook}} with story ideas, she admitted that {{on many occasions}} the theme of a chapter <b>was</b> <b>born</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> her own daydreams. Once she decided on a theme, she had the characters move around in her head and then worked out the plot and storyboard. Since she had a solid grasp on who the characters were, she noted that they moved around for her on their own. Conversely, if the characters were stiff with a given theme, Tsukudani could not develop an interesting story {{and moved on to}} another idea. The theme developed for the manga serialized in Febri had to do with bonus aspects to the story that she was unable to draw in the main serialization, as well as events that occurred between chapters in the main story.|$|E

5|$|Another {{idea was}} the use of split screens, which <b>was</b> <b>born</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the number of phone calls there were, and because of the element of real time, was used to trace {{parallel}} adventures of different characters, and aid in the connecting of characters. It was used by producers to point the audience to where to pay attention, as secondary stories often take place outside of the main plot. The idea of using boxes came later, which made shooting more flexible, as the shot could be cropped and reshaped inside the box. It was from here that the idea of using split screens as an artistic element came into the series.|$|E
5|$|Chelsea manager José Mourinho {{was delighted}} with his team's win and {{credited}} his opponent's performance. He felt the brawl in stoppage time <b>was</b> <b>born</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Arsenal's frustration after going {{behind in the}} match; {{he did not want}} either team to be punished. Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger apologised for his players' conduct and said he had no regrets over his team selection. Both finalists were fined £100,000 each by The Football Association for their inability to control their players. Emmanuel Eboué was retrospectively banned for three matches as his punch on Wayne Bridge was missed by Howard Webb. Wenger was later found guilty of improper conduct and charged £2,500 for his comments about the linesman.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton <b>was</b> <b>born</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> wedlock in Charlestown, Nevis. His Scottish-born father, James A. Hamilton, was {{the fourth}} son of Alexander Hamilton, laird of Grange, Ayrshire. His mother, born Rachel Faucette, was half-British and half-French Huguenot. Orphaned as a child by his mother's death and his father's abandonment, Hamilton was taken in by an older cousin and later by a prosperous {{merchant}} family. He was recognized for his intelligence and talent, and sponsored {{by a group of}} wealthy local men to travel to New York City to pursue his education. Hamilton attended King's College (now Columbia University), choosing to stay in the Thirteen Colonies to seek his fortune.|$|E

5|$|The largest {{religion}} in Wales is Christianity, with 57.6% {{of the population}} describing themselves as Christian in the 2011 census. The Church in Wales with 56,000 adherents has the largest attendance of the denominations. It is a province of the Anglican Communion, and {{was part of the}} Church of England until disestablishment in 1920 under the Welsh Church Act 1914. The first Independent Church in Wales was founded at Llanvaches in 1638 by William Wroth. The Presbyterian Church of Wales <b>was</b> <b>born</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the Welsh Methodist revival in the 18th century and seceded from the Church of England in 1811.|$|E
5|$|Welles's alleged {{biological}} son Michael Lindsay-Hogg, who <b>was</b> <b>born</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> wedlock to Welles {{and actress}} Geraldine Fitzgerald, first met Welles {{when he was}} 15 and later worked on the 1960 stage play Chimes at Midnight. This was the only {{significant amount of time}} that the two spent together and afterwards Lindsay-Hogg only saw Welles sporadically. Like Welles, Lindsay-Hogg had two surrogate fathers in addition to his biological father. In the late 1950s when she was 16, Welles's eldest daughter Christopher Welles Feder cut off all ties with Welles under pressure from her mother, who disapproved of Welles's influence on her. Welles and Feder later reconnected but their relationship never fully recovered. Welles's youngest daughter Beatrice, who resembled her father as a young boy, appears in the film version of Chimes at Midnight.|$|E

5|$|By this time, Ranjang Pande, the {{youngest}} son of Damodar Pande, was stationed as a {{captain in the}} army in Kathmandu. He {{was aware of the}} disunity between Samrajya Laxmi and Bhimsen; and thus he had secretly expressed his loyalty to Samrajya Laxmi and had vowed to help her in bringing Bhimsen down for all the wrongs he had committed against his family. Factions in the Nepalese court had also started to develop around the rivalry between the two queens, with the Senior Queen supporting the Pandes, while the Junior Queen supporting the Thapas. About a month after Mathabar's return to Kathmandu, a child <b>was</b> <b>born</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> an adulterous relationship between him and his widowed sister-in-law. This news was spread all over the country by the Pandes, and the resulting public disgrace forced Mathabar to leave Kathmandu and reside in his ancestral home in Pipal Thok, Borlang, Gorkha. To save face, Bhimsen gave Mathabar the governorship of Gorkha.|$|E
5|$|Castro <b>was</b> <b>born</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> wedlock at his father's farm on August 13, 1926. His father, Ángel Castro y Argiz, was {{a migrant}} to Cuba from Galicia, Northwest Spain. He had become financially {{successful}} by growing sugar cane at Las Manacas farm in Birán, Oriente Province {{and after the}} collapse of his first marriage he took his household servant, Lina Ruz González – of Canarian origin – as his mistress and later second wife; together they had seven children, among them Fidel. Aged six, Castro was sent to live with his teacher in Santiago de Cuba, before being baptized into the Roman Catholic Church at the age of eight. Being baptized enabled Castro to attend the La Salle boarding school in Santiago, where he regularly misbehaved, so he was sent to the privately funded, Jesuit-run Dolores School in Santiago. In 1945, Castro transferred to the more prestigious Jesuit-run El Colegio de Belén in Havana. Although Castro took an interest in history, geography and debating at Belén, he did not excel academically, instead devoting much of his time to playing sports.|$|E
5|$|The Lockheed Have Blue <b>was</b> <b>born</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> a {{requirement}} to evade radar detection. During the Vietnam War, radar-guided surface-to-air missiles (SAM) and anti-aircraft artillery (AAA) posed a significant threat to US aircraft. As such, strike aircraft {{during the war}} often required support aircraft to perform combat air patrols and suppression of enemy air defenses (SEAD). The 1973 Yom Kippur War again highlighted the vulnerability of aircraft to SAMs – the Israeli Air Force lost 109 aircraft in 18 days. During the Cold War, the Soviet Union developed an integrated defense network, central to which were medium- to long-range surveillance radars. SAMs and AAAs would be set up around key locations to defend them from incoming enemy aircraft. If the loss ratio of Israel during the Yom Kippur War was experienced by NATO forces during a military confrontation with the Warsaw Pact, NATO aircraft numbers would be depleted within two weeks.|$|E

5|$|The {{scenario}} {{was based}} around {{the concept of}} five different races, and the interaction with a human character. The story premise of a human character becoming {{a member of one}} of the five playable races <b>was</b> <b>born</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> a compromise about who and what the player character should be. The concept of a non-human character was introduced by Horii as he saw an inherent contradiction in the idea of a human saving the other tribes. This raised some contention among the staff including Fujisawa due to the Dragon Quest series' established convention of a human as the main protagonist, but Fujisawa and Horii decided to have the player character be a human first and later become one of the five tribes. Part of the story's initial drama came from the player character growing accustomed to their new form. Once the basic scenario concept had been finalized, the team commissioned the various character designs from Toriyama. In contrast to the greater majority of MMORPGs, which did not seem to have a solid ending, the team wanted to create a definitive ending with a final boss as featured in normal RPGs.|$|E
