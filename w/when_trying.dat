5|$|Historically, people repored that Fragile Allegiance did {{not work}} {{properly}} on Windows XP and later Windows platforms, as the game was designed for MS-DOS and ported to Windows 95. The most common issues being reported are no audio, the game failing to start, and the game crashing <b>when</b> <b>trying</b> to rename anything, including saved games. As no patch was ever released for the game, people have had to use emulators such as VDMSound or DOSBox {{in order to get}} the game to function properly but it may still crash <b>when</b> <b>trying</b> to rename a saved game.|$|E

5|$|Arranging a sleep {{environment}} that is quiet, very dark, and cool is recommended. Noises, light, and uncomfortable temperatures {{have been shown to}} disrupt continuous sleep. Other recommendations that are frequently made, though less studied, include selecting comfortable mattresses, bedding, and pillows, and eliminating a visible bedroom clock, to prevent focusing on time passing <b>when</b> <b>trying</b> to fall asleep.|$|E
5|$|In South Korea, Jeju Island {{reported}} 100mm (4inches) of rain by September 16, {{well before}} the typhoon hit, while Busan had reported 60mm (2inches). Shanshan knocked out electricity to nearly 4,000 homes in southeastern South Korea. A ship off Ulleungdo sank, but no casualties were reported from that incident. A sailor died <b>when</b> <b>trying</b> to dock boats on Jeju-do.|$|E
5|$|The Prosaurolophus-Saurolophus clade {{has been}} a {{problematic}} grouping <b>when</b> <b>trying</b> to place among hadrosaurines. Many skull features are similar to Edmontosaurus, while other are closer to Gryposaurus, so the group has been classified as close to both. However, the clade might be closer to Edmontosaurus, as the features are more numerous uniting them.|$|E

5|$|Damage was {{minor in}} {{southeast}} North Carolina. Moderate winds inflicted isolated shingle and siding damage along barrier islands. The winds downed several trees, some onto cars and houses. Brief power outages were also reported. Beach erosion damaged a bridge in Bald Head Island, as well. In Chowan County, a business {{parking lot was}} under several feet of water due to flash flooding. One person was indirectly killed in Carteret County <b>when</b> <b>trying</b> to restore electricity.|$|E

Overall, more than 11,000people were evacuated from their homes due to flooding. At least 135people were injured. Total damage from Odile amounted to approximately MX$16.6billion (US$1.22billion), with most of the damage coming from the infrastructural and agricultural sectors of the economy.|$|E
5|$|Red wattlebirds utter {{two types}} of alarm calls, {{alternating}} between them while mobbing other animals. One is a harsh call over a wide frequency (1.3 to 5.9kHz) that is louder at lower frequencies. The other a lower-pitched staccato call with a frequency of 1.1–2.2kHz. They give a harsh call <b>when</b> <b>trying</b> to distract intruders from {{the vicinity of the}} nest or when picked up, often trying to flap or peck the handler.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} {{idea for the}} short was a magician who incorporated a rabbit into his act who suffered from stage fright. This {{was considered to be}} too long and complicated, and the idea was reworked. To design the theater featured in Presto, the filmmakers visited several opera houses and theaters for set design ideas. Problems arose <b>when</b> <b>trying</b> to animate the theater's audience of 2,500 patrons; this was deemed too expensive, and was solved by showing the back of the audience.|$|E
5|$|<b>When</b> <b>trying</b> {{to explain}} past phenomena, paleontologists and other {{historical}} scientists often construct {{a set of}} hypotheses about the causes and then look for a smoking gun, a {{piece of evidence that}} indicates that one hypothesis is a better explanation than others. Sometimes the smoking gun is discovered by a fortunate accident during other research. For example, the discovery by Luis Alvarez and Walter Alvarez of an iridium-rich layer at the Cretaceous–Tertiary boundary made asteroid impact and volcanism the most favored explanations for the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event.|$|E
5|$|A further {{tour of the}} US {{was planned}} for December 1976, {{but it had to}} be {{cancelled}} when, on 23 November, Brian Robertson suffered a hand injury <b>when</b> <b>trying</b> to protect fellow Glaswegian, singer and friend Frankie Miller in a fracas at the Speakeasy Club in London. Miller had been jamming onstage with the reggae band Gonzalez, but had been drunk, offending Gonzalez guitarist Gordon Hunte. Hunte attacked Miller with a bottle in the dressing room, and Robertson intervened, suffering artery and nerve damage to his hand. Robertson subsequently broke Hunte's leg, broke the collarbone of another man, and headbutted another, before being hit on the head with a bottle, rendering him unconscious.|$|E

5|$|Apart {{from the}} six crew members, {{a total of}} 160 {{passengers}} were on board {{at the time of}} the crash. Although there were 169 names on the original passenger list, nine did not board the flight. All the bodies were recovered from the wreckage. Karnataka Home Minister V. S. Acharya said eight people were initially reported to have survived, although one person died of his injuries—this was however refuted by an Air India spokesman who confirmed that all initial survivors were alive. This confusion arose after fire fighters rescued a little girl who died on the way to hospital. The airport manager at Mangalore, Peter Abraham confirmed that there were difficulties <b>when</b> <b>trying</b> to reach the plane.|$|E
5|$|In Hong Kong, 50,000 {{people lost}} power. About 200 houses were destroyed. More than 2,000 people were left {{homeless}}; 1,600 {{of the homeless}} sought emergency shelter. Flights to the Kai Tak Airport were cancelled as the airport was closed for 12 hours. Large areas of farmland were damaged. Throughout the city, eight people perished, including a girl that was crushed by a falling cabinet. Two sisters were killed via a landslide while a fireman died <b>when</b> <b>trying</b> to rescue someone. Additionally, 339 people were injured, including 120 seriously. Forty-five people were injured due to flying glass and failing objects. Typhoon Ellen also spawned the second tornado ever recorded in Hong Kong, and the first ever recorded during {{the passage of a}} typhoon. According to the HKO, Ellen was Hong Kong's worst typhoon since Typhoon Hope of 1979.|$|E
5|$|On 19 September, Croatian forces {{managed to}} interdict radio {{communications}} between the 32nd Mechanised Brigade artillery and its artillery observers, {{and set up}} their own transmitter to direct JNA artillery fire against the Jalkovečke žrtve barracks. This deception was designed to deceive Davidović into thinking that the ZNG had much greater firepower than it did. The plan worked and when ZNG troops entered the barracks compound that day, the 32nd Mixed Artillery Regiment (four officers and 196 soldiers) surrendered. Late in the evening of 19 September, Croatian police and elements of the 3rd Battalion of the 104th Brigade secured the Varaždinbreg weapons storage facility located in the village of Banjšćina near Varaždin, after its JNA commander surrendered the facility and its garrison of 60 without resistance. The capture of JNA weapons greatly improved the Croatian position in negotiations <b>when</b> <b>trying</b> to convince JNA commanding officers of the 32nd Corps to surrender.|$|E

5|$|Research {{focused on}} four {{individual}} days that accumulated more than 5.9 inches (15cm) of hail in 30 {{minutes on the}} Colorado front range has shown that these events share similar patterns in observed synoptic weather, radar, and lightning characteristics, suggesting the possibility of predicting these events prior to their occurrence. A fundamental problem in continuing {{research in this area}} is that, unlike hail diameter, hail depth is not commonly reported. The lack of data leaves researchers and forecasters in the dark <b>when</b> <b>trying</b> to verify operational methods. A cooperative effort between the University of Colorado and the National Weather Service is in progress. The joint project's goal is to enlist the help of the general public to develop a database of hail accumulation depths.|$|E
5|$|The NTFS {{file system}} used by recent {{versions}} of Windows stores the file with a UTC time stamp, but displays it corrected to local—or seasonal—time. However, the FAT filesystem commonly used on removable devices stores only the local time. Consequently, when a file is copied {{from the hard}} disk onto separate media, its time will be set to the current local time. If the time adjustment is changed, the timestamps of the original file and the copy will be different. The same effect can be observed when compressing and uncompressing files with some file archivers. It is the NTFS file that changes seen time. This effect {{should be kept in}} mind <b>when</b> <b>trying</b> to determine if a file is a duplicate of another, although there are other methods of comparing files for equality (such as using a checksum algorithm).|$|E
5|$|The patent {{illustrates}} a non-powered flying machine—namely, the 1902 glider. The patent's importance {{lies in its}} claim {{of a new and}} useful method of controlling a flying machine, powered or not. The technique of wing-warping is described, but the patent explicitly states that other methods instead of wing-warping could be used for adjusting the outer portions of a machine's wings to different angles on the right and left sides to achieve lateral (roll) control. The concept of varying the angle presented to the air near the wingtips, by any suitable method, is central to the patent. The patent also describes the steerable rear vertical rudder and its innovative use in combination with wing-warping, enabling the airplane to make a coordinated turn, a technique that prevents hazardous adverse yaw, the problem Wilbur had <b>when</b> <b>trying</b> to turn the 1901 glider. Finally, the patent describes the forward elevator, used for ascending and descending.|$|E
