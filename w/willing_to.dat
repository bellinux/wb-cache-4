5000|$|In {{contemporary}} Nietzschean scholarship, some interpreters {{have emphasized}} the <b>will</b> <b>to</b> power as a psychological principle because Nietzsche applies it most frequently to human behavior. However, in Nietzsche's unpublished notes (later published by his sister as [...] "The <b>Will</b> <b>to</b> Power"), Nietzsche sometimes seemed <b>to</b> view the <b>will</b> <b>to</b> power as a more (metaphysical) general force underlying all reality, not just human behavior—thus making it more directly analogous <b>to</b> Schopenhauer's <b>will</b> <b>to</b> live. For example, Nietzsche claims the [...] "world is the <b>will</b> <b>to</b> power—and nothing besides!". Nevertheless, {{in relation to the}} entire body of Nietzsche's published works, many scholars have insisted that Nietzsche's principle of the <b>will</b> <b>to</b> power is less metaphysical and more pragmatic than Schopenhauer's <b>will</b> <b>to</b> live: while Schopenhauer thought the <b>will</b> <b>to</b> live was what was most real in the universe, Nietzsche can be understood as claiming only that the <b>will</b> <b>to</b> power is a particularly useful principle for his purposes.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>will</b> <b>to</b> live is {{considered}} to be a very basic drive in humans; but not necessarily the main driving force. In psychotherapy, Sigmund Freud termed the pleasure principle, which is the seeking of pleasure and avoiding of pain. Viktor Frankl, after spending time in a German concentration camp, developed psychotherapy called logotherapy, or the <b>will</b> <b>to</b> meaning. Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs highlights the innate appetite that people possess for love and belonging but before all this there is the very basic and powerful <b>will</b> <b>to</b> live.Psychologists have established that human beings are a goal-oriented species. In assessing the <b>will</b> <b>to</b> live, it should be borne in mind that it could be augmented or diminished by the relative strength of other simultaneously existent drives. Psychologists generally agree that there is the <b>will</b> <b>to</b> live, the <b>will</b> <b>to</b> pleasure, the <b>will</b> <b>to</b> superiority and the <b>will</b> <b>to</b> connection. There are also usually varying degrees of curiosity with regard to what may be termed the <b>will</b> <b>to</b> identity or establishing meaningful personal responses. The <b>will</b> <b>to</b> live is a platform without which it would not be possible to satisfy the other drives. However, this overlooks the possibility that there is a commonality among all creatures that drives all others urges. And that is the need to reproduce and ensure the preservation of the species.|$|R

5|$|Consequently, and at {{the urging}} of Shufeldt, Heilmann devoted much of the next few years {{attempting}} to find an English–language publisher <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> undertake a translation of his work. None of the larger publishers he approached were <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> do so unless Heilmann himself was prepared to finance it, which he was unable to do. In the meantime, Heilmann took the opportunity to revise and improve his manuscript, which included information he acquired from examining the Berlin specimen of Archaeopteryx {{for the first time in}} 1923 at the invitation of Josef Felix Pompeckj, a professor at the Natural History Museum in Berlin. Examining this important specimen in person allowed Heilmann to add some additional details and revisions to his understanding of the hip, the skull, and the flight feathers. With the help of the English paleontologist Arthur Smith Woodward of the British Museum, he finally met success in finding a small London publisher <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> produce an English version of his manuscript in 1926.|$|E
5000|$|Schopenhauer's [...] "Will to life" [...] thus {{became a}} {{subsidiary}} <b>to</b> the <b>will</b> <b>to</b> power, {{which is the}} stronger will. Nietzsche thinks his notion of the <b>will</b> <b>to</b> power is far more useful than Schopenhauer's <b>will</b> <b>to</b> live for explaining various events, especially human behavior—for example, Nietzsche uses the <b>will</b> <b>to</b> power to explain both ascetic, life-denying impulses and strong, life-affirming impulses in the European tradition, as well as both master and slave morality. He also finds the <b>will</b> <b>to</b> power to offer much richer explanations than utilitarianism's notion that all people {{really want to be}} happy, or the Platonist's notion that people want to be unified with the Good.|$|R
50|$|The <b>will</b> <b>to</b> {{power is}} the {{fundamental}} component of the human identity. Everything we do {{is an expression of}} the <b>will</b> <b>to</b> power.

5|$|However, a new wrinkle {{appeared}} {{when the}} City of Denver refused {{to transfer the}} parcel of land on which Pepsi Center stood unless Sturm promised to keep the Avalanche and Nuggets in Denver for at least 25 years.

While Sturm was <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> make a long-term commitment to the city, he wasn't <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> be held responsible if he died or sold the teams. After negotiations fell apart, Liberty bought all of Ascent, but kept the Nuggets and Avalanche on the market.|$|E
50|$|Many {{studies have}} been {{conducted}} on the theory of the <b>will</b> <b>to</b> live. Among these studies are subject to the difference in gender and the elderly and also in the terminally ill. One study focused on a simple question that asked about rating one’s <b>will</b> <b>to</b> live and presented the findings that elderly participants reporting a stronger <b>will</b> <b>to</b> live and strengthened or stable <b>will</b> <b>to</b> live survived longer in comparison to those with a weak <b>will</b> <b>to</b> live. This study found that women were able to cope with life-threatening situations, but suggested that the participants could not have been stable and requires future replication.The second study presented the idea of the <b>will</b> <b>to</b> live in the terminally ill specifically cancer patients termed as older. In this study researchers were able to suggest that patients who had tested as having a low sustained <b>will</b> <b>to</b> live died soonest, as opposed to having a moderate level of the <b>will</b> <b>to</b> live, lived the longest while high <b>will</b> <b>to</b> live could affect individuals in any direction. This study needs future replication that can show the effects of <b>will</b> <b>to</b> live in the terminally ill from different diseases and age categories.Other accounts of the <b>will</b> <b>to</b> live exist in many extreme medical cases, where patients have overcome extraordinary odds to survive. The Holocaust has provided many instances of this phenomenon, and {{is a good example of}} this as well. A proposed mechanism for the <b>will</b> <b>to</b> live is the idea that positive mental thinking tends to lower one’s risk for disease and health complications. One study showed that women who thought positively were more likely to carry more antibodies against certain strains of the flu, thus having a stronger immune system than those who were told to think negative thoughts.Powerful examples of humans having a <b>will</b> <b>to</b> live can be seen in death records throughout history showing that people were more likely to die right after a major holiday, such as Christmas and Thanksgiving, and even birthdays, not actually on or before them, but passing shortly after.|$|R
