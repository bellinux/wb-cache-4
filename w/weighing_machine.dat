Harris related that the story always told about Eugene was that if he stepped on a <b>weighing</b> <b>machine</b> the hands would go on until they could no farther as he topped the maximum 20 stone mark on the dial. Not surprisingly, according to Harris, Eugene was fond of his food and wine,) although he was also a keen sportsman listing his recreations in Who’s Who in his younger days as football, shooting, rowing, and fishing although in later life these pursuits turned into reading, bridge, backgammon, and the card game picquet.|$|E
500|$|For {{the first}} time in the history of the event, an {{official}} weigh-in was held, organised by The Sunday Times and <b>weighing</b> <b>machine</b> manufacturers W & T Avery Ltd. [...] Oxford's crew was the heaviest of all time, at an average of just under 14st 1lb (89.0kg) per rower, [...] more than their opposition, and {{the first time}} in the race history, a crew weighed more than an average of 14st (88.7kg). [...] The Dark Blue crew also included Steve Plunkett who, at 16st 5lb (103.6kg) was the heaviest rower in the history of the race. [...] The Cambridge crew were inexperienced, their only Blue being the Cambridge University Boat Club president Henry Clay who had rowed in the 1975 race. [...] In contrast, Oxford welcomed back five of their 1975 crew including cox Ashton Calvert, and also included two from the victorious 1975 Isis crew. [...] Two non-British rowers participated, Americans Dick Cashin (of Harvard) for Cambridge and Ken Brown (of Cornell) for Oxford.|$|E

In the same year, a Sleaford trader attempted to get {{the navigation}} extended to its authorised terminus at Castle Causeway, but the company stated {{that at the time}} of construction, only £700 had been left for the final [...] to the causeway, and as that would not have been enough, they had provided a suitable wharf at the present terminus. While none of these extensions were pursued, plans for the installation of a <b>weighing</b> <b>machine</b> on the wharf in 1837 escalated, and resulted in a residence for the clerk of the canal and a weighing office being built.

500|$|Snake Rattle 'n' Roll {{features}} two snakes – Rattle and Roll – as {{they make}} their way through 11 [...] isometric levels. The object in each level is to eat enough [...] "Nibbley Pibbleys" [...] – small round creatures found throughout each level – to gain enough weight to ring a bell on top of a <b>weighing</b> <b>machine</b> located {{at the end of the}} level; this causes a door for the next level to open. Players maneuver their snakes throughout the level with the control pad and are able to pick up Nibbley Pibbleys by pressing the B button on the controller. The snakes' lengths increase when they eat; players' snake length grows more quickly when they eat Nibbley Pibbleys of their own color, and they grow the most when they eat yellow ones. Located in each level are dispensers which randomly spew out Nibbley Pibbleys; however, they also spew out bombs which can damage the snakes. When a snake reaches a long enough length, the tail begins to flash, which means the snake is heavy enough to exit that level. [...] At that point, they must find and jump on the scale in order to ring the bell and open the exit door.|$|E

2500|$|Weight2: Weight {{can also}} be {{interpreted}} as that quantity which is measured when one uses scales. What is being measured there is the force exerted by the body on the scales. In a standard weighing operation, the body being weighed {{is in a state}} of equilibrium as a result of a force exerted on it by the <b>weighing</b> <b>machine</b> cancelling the gravitational field. By Newton's 3rd law, there is an equal and opposite force exerted by the body on the machine. This force is called weight2. The force is not gravitational. Typically, it is a contact force and not uniform across the mass of the body. [...] If the body is placed on the scales in a lift (an elevator) in free fall in pure uniform gravity, the scale would read zero, and the body said to be weightless i.e. its weight2 = 0. This describes the condition in which the body is stress free and undeformed. This is the weightlessness in free fall in a uniform gravitational field. (The situation is more complicated when the gravitational field is not uniform, or, when a body is subject to multiple forces which may, for instance, cancel each other and produce a state of stress albeit weight2 being zero. See below.) ...|$|E

The small, galvanized iron building shook with the throb of engines and rattle of machinery, and now and then a shower of cinders pattered upon the roof; for the big mill that ground up the concrete was working across the road. The lattice shutters were closed, for the sake of privacy, and kept out the glare, though they could not keep out the heat, which soaked through the thin, iron walls, and Dick's face was wet with perspiration as he arranged a number of small concrete blocks. Some of these were broken, and some partly crushed. Delicate scales and glass measures occupied a neighboring shelf, and a big steel apparatus that looked rather like a lever <b>weighing</b> <b>machine</b> stood in the shadow.|$|E

Except for a line or two, and three or four grey hairs in his little dark moustache, had he aged any more than Irene? The prime of life--he and she in the very prime of life!

He had looked forward to them, because his gifts had meant a semblance of gratitude, a certain attempt at warmth. Except, indeed, that last birthday--which had tempted him to be too religious! And he shied away in thought. Memory heaps dead leaves on corpse-like deeds, from under which they do but vaguely offend the sense. And then he thought suddenly: 'I could send her a present for her birthday. After all, we're Christians! Couldn't!--couldn't we join up again!' And he uttered a deep sigh sitting there. Annette!
