5|$|In {{some ways}} the run-up to Plataea resembled that at the Battle of Marathon; there was a {{prolonged}} stalemate in which neither side risked attacking the other. The reasons for this stalemate were primarily tactical, and similar to the situation at Marathon; the Greek hoplites did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>risk</b> being outflanked by the Persian cavalry and the lightly armed Persian infantry could not hope to assault well-defended positions.|$|E
5|$|Barkley's party loyalty in the governor's race {{made him}} a {{formidable}} candidate to challenge Stanley, who by 1924 had angered members of both party factions, but Barkley {{had spent most of}} his funds in his campaign against Cantrill, and he did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>risk</b> his reputation as a party unifier by challenging a Democrat. Instead, he decided to rebuild his war chest to unseat Kentucky's incumbent Republican senator, Richard P. Ernst, in 1926. In the meantime, he refrained from using his influence in state races to avoid losing any goodwill with Kentucky voters.|$|E

Vogue and other major women's and fashion magazines have avoided reviewing or even mentioning the book in their pages.

5|$|Despite {{the best}} interdiction efforts of Rolling Thunder, however, the NLF and PAVN {{launched}} their largest offensive thus {{far in the}} war on 30 January 1968, striking throughout South Vietnam during the lunar new year holiday. The Tet Offensive concluded as a military disaster for North Vietnam and its NLF allies, but it also adversely affected U.S. public opinion, which in turn affected the will of Washington. Fortunately for North Vietnam, many U.S. bombing advocates (including Air Force Chief of Staff McConnell) did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>risk</b> the one aircraft capable of delivering a lot of bombs in bad weather – the B-52. Without them, there was little that could be done over the north in response to Tet, since bad weather minimized fighter operations until the beginning of April.|$|E
5|$|During this time, the Flames {{found it}} {{increasingly}} difficult to retain their best players as salaries escalated while the Canadian dollar lost value against the American dollar. Calgary has always been one of the smallest markets in the league (it is currently third-smallest, behind only Edmonton and Winnipeg) and the NHL's small-market Canadian teams found {{it increasingly difficult}} to compete in the new environment. In 1999, for example, the Flames traded Fleury to the Colorado Avalanche midway through the season. The trade came shortly after Fleury became the franchise's all-time leading scorer. Fleury was due to become an unrestricted free agent {{at the end of the}} season, and the Flames did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>risk</b> losing him without getting anything in return.|$|E
5|$|Robinson {{made his}} {{professional}} debut on October 4, 1940, winning via second-round stoppage over Joe Echevarria. Robinson fought five more times in 1940, winning each time, with four wins coming {{by way of}} knockout. In 1941, he defeated world champion Sammy Angott, future champion Marty Servo and former champion Fritzie Zivic. The Robinson-Angott fight was held above the lightweight limit, since Angott did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>risk</b> losing his lightweight title. Robinson defeated Zivic in front of 20,551 at Madison Square Garden—one of the largest crowds in the arena to that date. Robinson won the first five rounds according to The New York Times Joseph C. Nichols, before Zivic came back to land several punches to Robinson's head in the sixth and seventh rounds. Robinson controlled the next two rounds, and had Zivic in the ninth. After a close tenth round, Robinson was announced as the winner on all three scorecards.|$|E

5|$|Brezhnev's {{personality}} cult {{was growing}} outrageously {{at a time}} when his health was in rapid decline. His physical condition was deteriorating; he was a lifelong heavy smoker, he had become addicted to sleeping pills, and had begun drinking to excess. Over the years he had become overweight. From 1973 until his death, Brezhnev's central nervous system underwent chronic deterioration and he had several minor strokes as well as insomnia. In 1975 he suffered his first heart attack. When receiving the Order of Lenin, Brezhnev walked shakily and fumbled his words. According to one American intelligence expert, United States officials knew for several years that Brezhnev had suffered from severe arteriosclerosis and believed he had suffered from other unspecified ailments as well. In 1977 American intelligence officials publicly suggested that Brezhnev had also been suffering from gout, leukemia and emphysema. He was reported to have been fitted with a pacemaker to control his heart rhythm abnormalities. Yevgeniy Chazov, the Chief of the Fourth Directorate of the Ministry of Health, had to keep doctors by Brezhnev's side at all times, and Brezhnev was brought back from near-death on several occasions. At this time, most senior officers of the CPSU wanted to keep Brezhnev alive, even if such men as Mikhail Suslov, Dmitriy Ustinov and Andrei Gromyko, among others, were growing increasingly frustrated with his policies. They did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>risk</b> a new period of domestic turmoil that might be caused by his death. At about this time First World commentators started guessing Brezhnev's heirs apparent. The most notable candidates were Suslov and Andrei Kirilenko, who were both older than Brezhnev, and Fyodor Kulakov and Konstantin Chernenko, who were younger; Kulakov died of natural causes in 1978.|$|E
5|$|De la Rúa's first Minister of Economy was the progressivist José Luis Machinea, who was {{proposed}} by Alfonsín and Álvarez. Menem {{had left a}} deficit of 5 Gross Domestic Product (GDP) points that Machinea tried to compensate with higher taxes to people with the highest incomes, and a reduction of the highest retirement pensions. The deficit was reduced but the crisis continued. The scandal over the labor law and the resignation of Álvarez increased the country risk, and made Argentina's access to international credit more difficult. The government negotiated a US$38 billion International Monetary Fund (IMF) line of credit to prevent a default and allow the economy to grow again. Machinea also proposed to appoint the former minister Cavallo as {{the new president of}} the Central Bank of Argentina. However, Machinea was unable to achieve the levels of austerity negotiated with the IMF and resigned a few days later. The Minister of Defense Ricardo López Murphy became the new Minister of Economy. During the election camapain, De la Rúa had promised not to appoint him to that ministry, but with the ongoing crisis he did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>risk</b> problems caused by a temporary lack of minister. López Murphy announced a stricter austerity plan, with reduction to the health and education budgets. His plan was rejected by street demonstrations and the Frepaso, so De la Rúa declined it. Murphy resigned after being minister for 16 days.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese {{government}} began {{negotiations with the}} Allies about the terms of surrender on 10August. During this period B-29 attacks on Japan were limited to a raid by the 315thBombardment Wing against an oil target {{on the night of}} 9/10August and a daytime precision bombing attack on a factory in Tokyo on 10August. The next day, President Truman ordered a halt to the bombing due to the possibility that it would be interpreted as a sign that the peace negotiations had failed. On 11August, Spaatz issued a new targeting directive for any renewed attacks that reduced the emphasis on bombing cities in favor of intensified attacks on transport infrastructure. On 13August, B-29s dropped copies of the Japanese government's conditional offer to surrender over Japanese cities. Negotiations appeared to be stalled, and on 14August Spaatz received orders to resume the bombing campaign. Arnold requested the largest attack possible, and hoped that USASTAF could dispatch 1,000 aircraft against the Tokyo region and other locations in Japan. In fact, 828 B-29s escorted by 186 fighters (for a total of 1,014 aircraft) were dispatched; during the day precision raids were made against targets at Iwakuni, Osaka and Tokoyama and at night the cities of Kumagaya and Isesaki were firebombed. While the Eighth Air Force units at Okinawa had not yet conducted any missions against Japan, General Doolittle decided not to contribute aircraft to this operation as he did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>risk</b> the lives of the men under his command when the war was effectively over. These were the last attacks conducted against Japan by heavy bombers, as at noon on 15August Hirohito made a radio broadcast announcing his country's intention to surrender.|$|E

5|$|Upon Carroll's {{return to}} Maryland, Hart was incensed {{both at the}} threat to his own power {{and the idea of}} a Catholic officeholder in the colony. Hart demanded that Carroll take the oath of allegiance, which he was willing to do, and the oath of abjuration {{confirming}} the Protestant succession to the English throne, which Carroll was not willing to do. Carroll began to act in the capacity authorized by the proprietor's commission, and Hart turned to the upper house of the colonial legislature for relief. Rejecting Carroll's arguments in support of his right to hold government offices, the assembly resisted his attempts to exercise the commission and, near the end of 1716, passed a series of laws confirming and restricting the oath requirements for officeholders, which were anti-Catholic by intent. Carroll's case may have been undermined {{when he came to the}} defense of his nephew, who had raised a toast to the Catholic James Stuart. Stuart had tried to take the British throne during a rebellion in 1715 and was extremely unpopular with Protestants in the colony. The proprietor, whose position had been so recently restored and who did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>risk</b> the loss of the colony, confirmed the decision of the assembly. Carroll's commission was formally revoked on 20 February 1717. According to a later account Hart gave to the assembly, Carroll began a campaign to undermine the Governor. There is no evidence that Hart was accurate, but the assembly passed stricter anti-Catholic laws in 1718, including disfranchisement, stripping Catholic males of the right to vote.|$|E

25|$|At {{the end of}} the season, the 76ers dealt Chamberlain to the Los Angeles Lakers for Archie Clark, Darrall Imhoff and Jerry Chambers.

Chamberlain was making noises about jumping to the American Basketball Association, and GM Jack Ramsay didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>risk</b> letting Chamberlain walk away for nothing. Nonetheless, the Sixers didn't get nearly enough in return. The man who was in position to take over as the center, Lucious Jackson, suffered a severe injury in 1969 and was never the same player after that. The Chamberlain trade sent the Sixers into a freefall, which Ramsay accelerated by subsequent divestiture of All Star forward Chet Walker to the Chicago Bulls.|$|E

Ibn al-Ahmar tried to send supplies to the important city, but these efforts were thwarted by the besiegers. Due to the difficulty Ibn al-Ahmar encountered in his attempts to defend and relieve Jaén, he agreed to terms with Ferdinand. In exchange for a twenty-year peace, Ibn al-Ahmar surrendered the city and agreed to pay Ferdinand an annual tribute of 150,000 maravedies. This agreement was made in March 1246, seven month into the siege of Jaén. The Castilians then entered the city and expelled its Muslim inhabitants.|$|E
