5|$|As {{the final}} game of the 1995 college {{football}} season for Texas and Virginia Tech, the 1995 Sugar Bowl provided a final opportunity for players to demonstrate their skills on the field prior to the next NFL Draft. Several players from both teams announced their intention to enter the draft and attempt to play in the National Football League. Star Virginia Tech defender Cornell Brown <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> these players. Prior to the draft, he announced his intention to remain at Tech for his senior year.|$|E
5|$|Belize {{received}} a universality invitation from the Tripartite Commission {{to send a}} judoka competing in the men's middleweight category (90kg) to the Olympics. This was Renick James's Olympic debut. He participated in the men's 90 kilograms event. Only six judokas participated in the round of 64, and James <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> them. He lost 100-000 in the round of 32 against Ovini Uera of Nauru. Uera went on to lose his next bout against Varlam Liparteliani of Georgia. Liparteliani also {{went on to win}} a silver medal.|$|E
5|$|Discovered in 1834 by Johann Friedrich Engelhardt and {{described}} {{three years later}} by Hermann von Meyer, Plateosaurus was the fifth named dinosaur genus that is still considered valid. Although it had been described before Richard Owen formally named Dinosauria in 1842, it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the three genera used by Owen to define the group, because at the time, it was poorly known and difficult to identify as a dinosaur. It is now among the dinosaurs best known to science: over 100 skeletons have been found, some of them nearly complete. The abundance of its fossils in Swabia, Germany, {{has led to the}} nickname Schwäbischer Lindwurm (Swabian lindworm).|$|E

5|$|For her {{performance}} as Alice Howland, Julianne Moore won an Academy Award, BAFTA Award, Golden Globe Award, Screen Actors Guild Award, and Critics' Choice Movie Award. Still Alice marked her first Academy Award win after four previous nominations. Although she was widely considered the Best Actress frontrunner {{in anticipation of}} the Academy Awards ceremony, some critics felt that Still Alice <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> Moore's strongest performances and did not deserve to win. Moore dedicated her Academy Award win to Glatzer, who died from ALS several weeks later on March 10, 2015.|$|E
5|$|He {{had little}} impact on {{the running of the}} navy, but he was {{interested}} enough in navigation and welfare at sea to sponsor the publication of John Flamsteed's Observations in 1704. He <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the most colourful political characters of his day—he was content to spend his time building model ships—but he was a loyal and supportive husband to Queen Anne. Their marriage was a devoted, loving and faithful one, though beset by personal tragedy.|$|E
5|$|Since then, Jackson {{has further}} {{clarified}} {{the origins and}} the nature of the bad blood between the two. According to Jackson, the rivalry exists because he was one of the few fighters in Japan who was not afraid of Silva outside of the ring. Jackson stated that fighters were afraid to eat or be in an elevator with Silva, but he <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> them. He added that the bad blood is only coming from Silva's end. Silva, on the other hand, cited Jackson's apparent insults towards him on the internet to account for the bad blood in an interview prior to the UFC 92 fight.|$|E

5|$|The actor John Payne {{attempted}} {{to take up}} the option on the film rights to the book in 1955, but nothing came of the attempt. The Rank Organisation also came to an agreement to make a film, but this likewise fell through. The novel <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> Fleming's stories acquired by Eon Productions in 1961; in 1969 the company acquired the rights and commissioned Gerry Anderson to produce and co-write a screenplay. Anderson and Tony Barwick prepared a 70-page treatment that was never filmed, but some elements were similar to the final screenplay of The Spy Who Loved Me.|$|E
5|$|The borough <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> those {{reformed}} by the Municipal Corporations Act of 1835, {{and continued}} to exist {{under the control of}} the Lord of the Manor and the Court Leet until its final abolition in 1886. The Public Health Act of 1848 led to the creation of Altrincham's Local Board of Health in 1851 to address the unsanitary conditions created by the town's growing population– the first such board in Trafford.|$|E
5|$|The campaigns {{agreed to}} hold four debates. The first debate {{took place on}} March 2, between Tedisco and Murphy. The second debate, {{sponsored}} by WMHT and the Times Union, took place on March 19 between Murphy and Libertarian candidate Eric Sundwall. Jim Tedisco held {{a town hall meeting}} rather than attend, claiming the debate <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the four originally agreed upon. The third debate took place on March 23 and the final debate was on March 26.|$|E

Abelson and other scientists at the United States Naval Research Laboratory. This was primarily due to doubts about the process's technical feasibility, but inter-service rivalry between the United States Army and United States Navy also played a part.|$|E
5|$|The {{value of}} the {{captured}} goods from Colombo alone amounted to more than £300,000. More importantly for the British, Ceylon <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the colonies returned to the Batavian Republic following the Treaty of Amiens which brought the war to a brief close in 1802. Britain retained Ceylon {{as part of the}} British Empire until independence was granted in 1948.|$|E

5|$|With the Age of Discovery, rivalry {{developed}} between European colonies {{and the importance}} of cannon in naval warfare increased. Many merchant vessels were armed with cannon and the aggressive activities of English privateers, who engaged the galleons of the Spanish treasure fleets, helped provoke the first Anglo-Spanish War, though it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the main factors. A fleet review on Elizabeth I's accession in 1559 showed the navy to consist of 39 ships and in 1588, Philip II of Spain launched the Spanish Armada against England. In a running battle lasting over a week, the Armada was scattered and defeated by the English navy.|$|E
5|$|A {{bipartisan}} {{group of}} MPs formed a Conciliation Committee in early 1910 and proposed a Conciliation Bill {{that would have}} brought the vote to a million women, {{so long as they}} owned property. While the bill was being discussed, the WSPU put in a temporary truce on activity. The bill failed that November when Asquith's Liberal government reneged on a promise to allow parliamentary time to debate the bill. A WSPU delegation of around 300 women tried to present him with a petition, but were prevented from doing so by an aggressive police response; the suffragettes, who called the day Black Friday, complained of assault, much of which was sexual in nature. Davison <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the 122 people arrested, but was incensed by the treatment of the delegation; the following day she broke several windows in the Crown Office in parliament. She was arrested and sentenced to a month in prison. She went on hunger strike again and was force-fed for eight days before being released.|$|E
5|$|In the 2000s, Cloverleaf {{tried to}} sell Rosecroft {{multiple}} times. In mid-2002, several buyers {{became interested in the}} track, but Cloverleaf was involved in lawsuits, so the track could not be sold. One bidder was Peter Angelos, the owner of the Baltimore Orioles, but he withdrew in 2005. All the lawsuits were resolved in 2006, and only one remaining bidder was left—Penn National Gaming. Maryland passed a casino bill in 2007, but Rosecroft <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the locations sanctioned for expanded gambling by the law. As a result, Penn National lost its interest in Rosecroft and decided not to purchase the track. From the gambling revenue, 7 percent goes to the horse-racing industry.|$|E

5|$|On September 7, 2010, United States women's {{national}} team head coach Pia Sundhage named a 30-player roster for two matches against China in October. The roster {{would then be}} narrowed down to the 20-player roster for the 2010 CONCACAF Women's World Cup Qualifying tournament. The players would {{take part in a}} training camp before the two matches starting on September 20. Although Harris <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the four goalkeepers on this preliminary roster, she was called into camp on September 23 to replace Hope Solo, who was recovering from a shoulder surgery. She was then named to the 24-player roster for the team's second match against China on October 6 in Philadelphia, although she did not dress for the match. She was not named to the 20-player roster for the 2010 CONCACAF Women's World Cup Qualifying tournament, but she did travel with the team to train.|$|E
5|$|Parmelly {{is blamed}} for the murders. The agents start to leave Florida, but Mulder soon pulls over. He remains frustrated, since Parmelly was on-duty during only one murder, and <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the three men who knew Perry Simon's {{confidential}} identity. He also points out inconsistencies in the actions of Parmelly and Roque, who was also assumed {{to be part of}} the plot. Mulder believes that Parmelly was not responsible for the deaths, and that Neech had indeed been reincarnated to exact his revenge. However, Scully convinces Mulder that the case is over, and that they should return home. Just then, Brodeur passes them in his car. Looking in his rear view mirror, he sees Neech, who attacks Brodeur and causes his car to crash into a tree, claiming his last victim.|$|E
5|$|Seven {{days after}} the Double Tenth, Bishop John Wilson of St Andrew's Cathedral {{was taken to the}} YMCA, and placed in the cell next to Elizabeth.

One night Elizabeth saw Rob Scott, by then badly disfigured {{as a result of the}} beatings and water tortures that he had been subjected to. At the end of one session Scott was told that he had been sentenced to death, and was forced to write a farewell letter to his wife. He was later sentenced to six years' imprisonment in Outram Road Prison instead, the site where convicted sepoy mutineers had been detained and executed by the British Army in 1915.|$|E
