30|$|A current {{update on}} the status of {{groundwater}} quality and the geochemical characters of the hard rock aquifers of central parts of Telangana State, India, is presented. Suitability of the groundwater for domestic and irrigation purposes was evaluated from the measured hydrochemical parameters in accordance with guideline values prescribed by WHO (2011) and BIS (2012). The overall water quality is assessed using WQI, which indicates that more number of samples have better quality during post-monsoon compared to pre-monsoon. F− and NO 3 − were found to be the main inorganic contaminants in groundwater, while high HCO 3 − concentration renders the water quality poor by increasing the total hardness. Seasonal variation of the hydrochemical data clearly suggests that dissolution of salts in the unsaturated zone by infiltrating rainwater adds to major ions into the groundwater, while F− and NO 3 − show a reduction in concentration due to rainwater dilution. All the indicators and diagrams depicting the irrigation suitability suggest that post-monsoon samples are more suitable for irrigation than pre-monsoon samples. The geochemical characteristics of groundwater determined by Piper’s diagram and Chadha’s plot show that post-monsoon groundwater has significant contribution from rain and the chemistry is governed by salt dissolution in unsaturated zone. During pre-monsoon, <b>water</b> <b>rock</b> <b>interaction</b> and ion-exchange processes were found to be more dominating. The study area (Nalgonda District) being a known fluoride contaminated region, implementing rainwater harvesting by constructing suitable artificial structures and desilting the natural tanks available in this area can help increase the groundwater availability and also limit the fluorosis incidences among local population.|$|E
30|$|Water {{quality is}} {{controlled}} by many factors including climate, soil topography, and <b>water</b> <b>rock</b> <b>interaction</b> (Farnham et al. 2003; Love et al. 2004; Li et al. 2016 a, b). These factors lead to a variation in hydrogeochemical process of groundwater using statistical techniques. Detailed hydrochemical {{research is needed to}} evaluate the different processes and mechanisms involved in polluting water (Helena et al. 1999). Earlier studies have been focused in hydrogeochemical process of groundwater using statistical analysis (Ashley and Llyod 1978; Reghunath et al. 2002; Liu et al 2003; Monjerezi et al. 2008; Nagaraju et al. 2014 a, b; Wu et al. 2014; Li et al. 2016 a, b). These techniques constitute a useful tool for groundwater quality characterization for identification of the regional groundwater flow pattern and investigation of groundwater contamination like trace elements (Voudouris et al. 1997; Cloutier et al. 2008; Belkhiri et al. 2010; Kumar et al. 2013). The multivariate statistical analysis methods have the advantage of explaining complex water quality monitoring data. Earlier workers have been successfully applied to a number of hydrogeochemical studies (Singh et al. 2005; Kowalkowskia et al. 2006; Boyacioglu 2008; Wu et al. 2014; Nagaraju et al. 2016 a, b). Further, these studies have shown that multivariate statistical analysis can help to interpret the complex datasets, and it is useful in verifying temporal and spatial variations caused by natural and anthropogenic factors. Surface water, groundwater quality assessment, and environmental research employing multi-component techniques are well described in the literature (Praus 2005). Multivariate statistical approaches allow deriving hidden information from the dataset about the possible influences of the environment on water quality (Spanos et al. 2003).|$|E
30|$|A {{major portion}} {{of the study area}} shows {{contamination}} by NO 3 − and F− (Table  2). NO 3 − concentration in the area varies between 3.3 and 236  mg/L with an average of 48.9  mg/L in pre-monsoon and between 6.4 and 302  mg/L with an average of 48.9  mg/L (Table  1; Fig.  3 i). Nitrate in groundwater is derived mainly from poultry farms, animal wastages and septic tank leakages, agricultural activities, and decaying of organic domestic wastes (Jalali 2005; Lee et al. 2003; Narsimha and Sudarshan 2017). High NO 3 − in drinking water causes methemoglobinemia (blue baby syndrome) in infants (WHO 1997). F− Concentration in the area varies between 0.18 and 3.4  mg/L with an average of 1.12  mg/L for pre-monsoon samples and between 0 and 2.6  mg/L with an average of 0.72  mg/L for post-monsoon samples (Table  1; Fig.  3 g). Granites/gneisses are the major rock types in this study area which have the highest fluoride containing minerals viz. fluorite (0 – 3.3 %), biotite (0.1 – 1.7 %), and hornblende (0.1 – 1.1 %). So, the major reason for elevated level of fluoride concentration in the groundwater in this region could be due to <b>water</b> <b>rock</b> <b>interaction</b> and weathering of F− rich minerals. Anthropogenic activities such as, application of fertilisers and industrial activities like brick kilning also add to fluoride levels in the aquifers (Brindha and Elango 2011; Datta et al. 1996; Hem 1986; Pickering 1985).

40|$|Isotopes of {{dissolved}} {{inorganic carbon}} (DIC) are used to indicate both transit times and biogeochemical evolution of groundwaters. These signals can be complicated in carbonate aquifers, as both abiotic (i. e. carbonate equilibria) and biotic factors influence δ 13 C and 14 C of DIC. We applied a novel graphical method for tracking changes in δ 13 C and 14 C of DIC in two distinct aquifer complexes identified in the Hainich Critical Zone Exploratory (CZE), a platform to study how water 20 transport links surface and shallow groundwaters in limestone and marlstone rocks in central Germany. For more quantitative estimates of contributions of different biotic and abiotic carbon sources to the DIC pool, we used the geochemical modelling program NETPATH, which accounts for changes in dissolved ions in addition to C isotopes. Although water residence times in the Hainich CZE aquifers based on hydrogeology are relatively short (years or less), DIC isotopes in the shallow, mostly anoxic, aquifer assemblage (HTU) were depleted in 14 C compared to a deeper, oxic, aquifer 25 complex (HTL). Carbon isotopes and chemical changes in the deeper HTL wells {{could be explained by}} interaction of recharge waters equilibrated with post-bomb 14 C sources with carbonates. However, oxygen depletion and δ 13 C and 14 C values of DIC below those expected from the processes of carbonate equilibrium alone indicate dramatically different biogeochemical evolution of waters in the upper aquifer assemblage (HTU wells).

40|$|International audienceMajor {{environmental}} stressors of boreal and sub-arctic rivers are hydrological {{changes and}} global warming and both factors will significantly influence the future evolution of the river chemistry in high latitudes. We tested the hypothesis whether lower concentrations of dissolved constituents observed in regulated rivers come along with lower weathering rates, though specific discharge as a major force for physical erosion and weathering is often higher in regulated river systems. In this study the river chemistry, weathering rates and related carbon dioxide consumption in two large watersheds in the sub arctic region of Sweden, one regulated river (Lule River) and one unregulated river (Kalix River), was investigated. Weathering rates of silicates in the two watersheds are shown to be different; the silicate weathering rate in Kalix River catchment is almost 30 % {{higher than in the}} Lule River catchment. This is most likely a result of constructing large reservoirs in the former river valleys inundating the alluvial deposits and thus decreasing soil/water contact resulting in lower weathering rates. Furthermore, the difference observed in weathering rates between lowland regions and headwaters suggests that weathering in sub arctic boreal climates is controlled by the residence time for soil <b>water</b> <b>rock</b> <b>interactions</b> followed by lithology. The chemistry in the two rivers shows weathering of silicates as the origin for 68 % of the inorganic carbon in the Lule River and 74 % for Kalix River. The study clearly shows that river regulation significantly decreases alkalinity export to the sea because lower weathering rates gives less carbon dioxide ending up as DIC. By considering sources for inorganic carbon we here report that the inorganic carbon load that originates from respiration of organic matter in soils makes up of 30 % and 35 % of the total C export for the watersheds of the Kalix River and Lule River, respectively. Therefore, both the inorganic (i. e. the origin of carbon in DIC) and organic carbon load carbon must be considered when studying climate changes on the organic carbon load since effects from increased degradation of organic matter may lead to more weathering (higher production of DIC) ...|$|R

Mixing processes in the water column at Inkwell and Church blue holes are inferred from changes in the concentration of chloride. The degree of variation is a mixed signal resulting from changes of the precipitation/evaporation balance and tidal driven water-rock interaction. Inkwell is strongly influenced by tidal pumping, which causes ample value fluctuations, most notably salinity (1. 01 to 21. 8 ‰), chloride (Cl-) from 300 to 9591. 8 mg/L, and total hardness (9 to 293 mg/L) within the mixing zone. This location is the only site that may have a true halocline. Watlings’s geochemical parameters have the smallest range (i. e., salinity 30. 19 - 34. 30 ‰) {{due to a lack of}} mixing that suggests that this site has a direct conduit connection to the ocean. The furthest inland blue hole (Church) lacks significant geochemical fluctuations with the exception of Cl-, which changes from 19600 mg/L to 1800 mg/L between the depths of 1 and 2 m. The abrupt modification of Cl- values between surface and - 2 m suggests mixing is occurring. The lack of other parameter variations within the water column suggests restricted flow via narrow conduits or more likely matrix flow. Salinity values decrease from the surface (21. 47 ‰) to - 1 m (17. 78 ‰) whereas, sulfate (SO 42 -) concentration at the same depth reach its maximum value (4009 mg/L). The high sulfate values throughout the column (2634 to 4009 mg/L) are characteristic of seawater (> 2700 mg/L), thus indicating seawater seepage into the blue hole. We assume the elevated salinity values at the surface and - 1 m are pointing towards evaporative processes. ...|$|R
40|$|Groundwater {{pollution}} from anthropogenic sources {{is a serious}} concern affecting several coastal aquifers worldwide. Increasing groundwater exploitation, coupled with point and non-point pollution sources, are the main anthropogenic impacts on coastal environments and are responsible for severe health and food security issues. Adequate management strategies to protect groundwater from contamination and overexploitation are of paramount importance, especially in arid prone regions, where coastal aquifers often represent the main freshwater resource to sustain human needs. The Bou-Areg Aquifer (Morocco) {{is a perfect example}} of a coastal aquifer constantly exposed to all the negative externalities associated with groundwater use for agricultural purposes, which lead to a general increase in aquifer salinization. In this study data on 61 water samples, collected in June and November 2010, were used to: (i) track groundwater composition changes related to the use of irrigation water from different sources, (ii) highlight seasonal variations to assess aquifer vulnerability, and (iii) present a reproducible example of multi-tracer approach for groundwater management in rural coastal areas. Hydrogeochemical results show that Bou-Areg groundwater is characterized by - high salinity, associated with a remarkable increase in bicarbonate content in the crop growing season, due to more intense biological activity in irrigated soils. The coupled multi-tracer and statistical analysis confirms the strong dependency on irrigation activities as well as a clear identification of the processes governing the aquifer's hydrochemistry in the different seasons. <b>Water</b> <b>Rock</b> <b>Interaction</b> (WRI) dominates the composition of most of groundwater samples in the Low Irrigation season (L-IR) and Agricultural Return Flow (ARF) mainly affects groundwater salinization in the High Irrigation season (H-IR) in the same areas naturally affected by WRI. In the central part of the plain River Recharge (RR) from the Selouane River is responsible for the high groundwater salinity whilst Mixing Processes (MIX) occur in absence of irrigation activities...|$|E
40|$|The western {{flank of}} the Great Bahama Bank, drilled during ODP Leg 166 at seven sites, {{represents}} a prograding carbonate sequence from late Oligocene to Holocene [Eberli et al., Proc. ODP Init. Reports 166 (1997) ]. The signatures of the detrital input and of diagenetic alteration are evident in clay enriched intervals from the most distal Sites 1006 and 1007 in the Straits of Florida. Mineralogical and chemical investigations (XRD, TEM, SEM, ICP-MS) run on bulk rocks and on the clay fractions enable the origin and evolution of silicate parageneses to be characterized. Plio-Pleistocene silt and clay interbeds contain detrital clay assemblages comprising chlorite, illite, interstratified illite smectite, smectite, kaolinite and palygorskite. The greater smectite input within late Pliocene units than in Pleistocene oozes may relate either varying source areas or change in paleoclimatic conditions and weathering intensity. The clay intervals from Miocene-upper Oligocene wackestone sections are fairly different, with prevalent smectite in the fine fraction, whose high crystallinity and Mg contents that point towards an authigenic origin. The lower Miocene section, below 1104 mbsf, at depths where compaction features are well developed, is particularly characterized by abundant authigenic Na-K-clinoptilolite filling foraminifer tests. The authigenic smectite and clinoptilolite paragenesis is recorded by the chemical trends, both of the sediment and the interstitial fluid. This diagenetic evolution implies Si- and Mg rich fluids circulating in deeper and older sequences. For lack of any local volcaniclastic input, the genesis of zeolite and the terms of <b>water</b> <b>rock</b> <b>interaction</b> are discussed. The location of the diagenetic front correlates {{with that of the}} seismic sequence boundary P 2 dated as 23. 2 Ma. This correspondence may allow the chronostratigraphic significance of some specific seismic reflections to be reassessed...|$|E
30|$|Assessment of the hydrochemical {{characteristics}} {{of water and}} aquifer hydraulic properties is important for groundwater planning and management in the study area. Generally, the motion of groundwater along its flow paths below the ground surface increases the concentration of the chemical species (Domenico and Schwartz 1990; Freeze and Cherry 1979; Kortasi 2007). Groundwater is the purest form of water sourced from natural resources and is usually clear, colorless and remains relatively at constant temperature. Therefore, it is normally superior to surface water in terms of sanitary consideration. But groundwater has higher salt contents than surface water because slowly moving water remains in contact with sub-strata for longer periods. Hence, the groundwater chemistry could reveal important information on the geological history of the aquifers {{as well as the}} suitability of groundwater for domestic and agricultural purposes. Quality of groundwater is equally important to its quantity owing to the suitability of water for various purposes (Schiavo et al. 2006; Subramani et al. 2005). Hydrochemical evaluation of groundwater systems is usually based on the availability of a large amount of information concerning groundwater chemistry (Aghazadeh and Mogaddam 2010; Hossein 2004). Groundwater chemistry, in turn, depends on a number of factors, such as general geology, degree of chemical weathering of the various rock types, quality of recharge water and inputs from sources other than <b>water</b> <b>rock</b> <b>interaction.</b> Such factors and their interactions result in a complex groundwater quality (Domenico and Schwartz 1990; Guler and Thyne 2004; Sunne et al. 2005). Various studies on the hydrogeological and hydrochemical properties of the aquifers underlying the country are currently being pursued. Recent studies have been focused on the quality of groundwater from specific hydrogeologic terrains in the country. Researchers (e.g. Kortatsi et al. 2008; Yidana et al. 2008 a, b, c, d; Yidana 2008; Banoeng-Yakubo et al. 2009; Nag and Ray 2015; Nag 2014; Nag and Ghosh 2013) have applied different methodologies to understand the sources of variation in the quality of surface and groundwater basins in India.|$|E
40|$|Geochemistry of {{formation}} {{waters in}} the Shiwu depression of the Songliao basin, northeast China, shows a distinct variation in different pressured systems. The study area is composed of terrigeneous clastics in fluvial [...] lacustrine environments, which contain formation water with salinity ranging from less than 1000 to 12, 000 mg/l. Water composition varies with depth and hydrochemical regions. In the underpressured strata deposited during the rifting period, formation water is characterized by water type of CaCl 2 with higher salinity. NaHCO 3 -dominanted water with lower salinity occurs in the normally pressured strata deposited during the post-rifting period. In the transition area between the normally pressured and underpressured zones, total dissolved solid (TDS) content ranges from 1000 to 7600 mg/l and increases with depth. In this halite-free basin, brackish water {{may be attributed to}} the evaporation of formation water and <b>water</b> [...] <b>rock</b> <b>interaction.</b> In the deep buried underpressured water, a predominated diagenesis reaction resulting in Ca and Cl enrichment and reduction of Na may be related to albitization of plagioclase following the basinal fluid line (BFL). The results {{of this study indicate that}} salinity variation of formation water and diagenesis reaction is closely related to hydrochemical environments within different pressured systems...|$|R
30|$|The {{accumulation}} of Trace metals in groundwater has direct consequences to both {{man and the}} ecosystem. There are two main sources of heavy metals in groundwater (i) natural (ii) anthropogenic sources. The natural sources include the release of metals from rock weathering and their final leaching into groundwater by <b>rock</b> <b>water</b> <b>interaction.</b> The anthropogenic sources include discharge of heavy metals into the atmosphere by burning of fossil fuels/industrial activities and, thereby, to the streams by rain and also through discharge of industrial effluents and sewage water into streams and surface water bodies (Antony Ravindran and Selvam 2014; Dutka and Bell 1973; Handa 1981; Leung and Jiao 2006; Selvam and Sivasubramanian 2012 a; Singaraja et al. 2015).|$|R
40|$|The gabbronoritic cumulates drilled at DSDP Site 334 (Mid-Atlantic Ridge off the FAMOUS area) {{are neither}} {{crystallization}} {{products of the}} associated basalts, nor from any MORB composition documented along ocean ridges. Their parent melts are richer in SiO 2 than MORB at a given MgO content, as attested by the crystallization sequence starting with an olivine + calcic and sub-calcic pyroxene assemblages. These melts are issued from a source highly depleted in incompatible elements, likely residual peridotite left after MORB extraction. To understand the role {{of water in the}} genesis of these lithologies whose occurrence in a mid-ocean ridge setting is rather puzzling, we performed a geochemical study on clinopyroxene separates following an analytical protocol able to remove the effects of <b>water</b> <b>rock</b> <b>interactions</b> post-dating their crystallization. Accordingly, the measured isotopic signatures can be used to trace magma sources. We find that Site 334 clinopyroxenes depart from the global mantle correlation: normal MORB values for the 143 Nd / 144 Nd ratio (0. 51307 – 0. 51315) are associated to highly radiogenic 87 Sr / 86 Sr (0. 7034 – 0. 7067) ratios. This indicates that the parent melts of Site 334 cumulates are issued from a MORB source but that seawater contamination occurred at some stage of their genesis. The extent of contamination, traced by the Sr isotopic signature, is variable within all cumulates but more developed for gabbronorites sensus stricto, suggesting that seawater introduction was a continuous process during all the magmatic evolution of the system, from partial melting to fractional crystallization. Simple masse balance calculations are consistent with a contaminating agent having the characters of a highly hydrated (possibly water saturated) silica-rich melt depleted in almost all incompatible major, minor and trace elements relative to MORB. Mixing in various proportions of contaminated melts similar to the parent melts of Site 334 cumulates with MORB can account for part of the variability in the Sr isotopic signature of oceanic basalts, among other to the short wavelength isotopic “noise” superimposed on regional trends. We conclude that seawater introduction into residual peridotite at shallow depth beneath mid-ocean ridges can lead mantle rocks and their melts to follow complex P–T–fH 2 O paths that mimic petrogenetic contexts classically attributed to subduction zone environments, like the production of boninitic–andesitic magmas...|$|R
