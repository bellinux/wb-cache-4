5|$|A Bulldog Drummond {{radio series}} {{ran on the}} Mutual Broadcasting System from 13 April 1941 to 12 January 1949. An attempt <b>was</b> <b>made</b> <b>at</b> a revival between 3 January and 28 March 1954. Drummond was {{initially}} portrayed by George Coulouris, before being taken over by Santos Ortega and Ned Wever after 1942; Cedric Hardwicke took over in 1954.|$|E

5|$|The Embraer, on {{the other}} hand, started calling Brasilia Center, also unsuccessfully, from 16:48 and {{continued}} with twelve more unsuccessful attempts until 16:53. Some limited contact <b>was</b> <b>made</b> <b>at</b> that point, but the Embraer was unable to copy the Amazonic Center frequencies. The Embraer then continued its attempts to reach Brasilia Center, seven more times until the collision.|$|E
5|$|A heliacal rising of Sothis was {{recorded}} in the reign of Thutmose's predecessor, Amenhotep I, which has been dated to 1517 BC, assuming the observation <b>was</b> <b>made</b> <b>at</b> Thebes. The year of Amenhotep's death and Thutmose's subsequent coronation can be accordingly derived, and is dated to 1506 BC by most modern scholars. However, if the observation were made at either Heliopolis or Memphis, as a minority of scholars promote, Thutmose would have been crowned in 1526 BC.|$|E

5|$|According to Plutarch, one {{tradition}} had it {{that the}} Persian king (who at the time would still have been Xerxes) agreed a humiliating peace treaty {{in the aftermath of}} the Eurymedon. However, as Plutarch admits, other authors denied that such a peace <b>was</b> <b>made</b> <b>at</b> this time, and the more logical date for any peace treaty would have been after the Cyprus campaign of 450 BC. The alternative suggested by Plutarch is that the Persian king acted as if he had made a humiliating peace with the Greeks, because he was so fearful of engaging in battle with them again. It is generally considered unlikely by modern historians that a peace treaty was made in the aftermath of Eurymedon.|$|E
5|$|In 1823, Anning {{discovered}} a second, much more complete plesiosaur skeleton, specimen BMNH 22656. When Conybeare presented {{his analysis of}} plesiosaur anatomy to {{a meeting of the}} Geological Society in 1824, he again failed to mention Anning by name, even though she had possibly collected both skeletons and she had made the sketch of the second skeleton he used in his presentation. Conybeare's presentation <b>was</b> <b>made</b> <b>at</b> the same meeting at which William Buckland described the dinosaur Megalosaurus and the combination created a sensation in scientific circles. The second fossil was named and described as Plesiosaurus dolichodeirus and is the type specimen (holotype) of this species, which itself is the type species of the genus.|$|E
5|$|Lambert {{proved to}} be unable to mix the track, and a fresh attempt at {{recording}} <b>was</b> <b>made</b> <b>at</b> the start of April at Mick Jagger's house, Stargroves, using the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio. Glyn Johns was invited to help with production, {{and he decided to}} re-use the synthesized organ track from Townshend's original demo, as the re-recording of the part in New York was felt to be inferior to the original. Keith Moon had to carefully synchronise his drum playing with the synthesizer, while Townshend and Entwistle played electric guitar and bass.|$|E
25|$|The {{motion of}} the defense for {{production}} should <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>at</b> {{the close of the}} testimony of the witnesses from whom the documents are sought.

5|$|Meanwhile, Israeli Southern Command {{attempted}} {{to pinpoint the}} main Egyptian effort to launch a counterattack with Dan Shomron's reserve armored brigade, when, in fact, there was no main effort. As a result, Southern Command wasted several critical hours without taking decisive action. Tactical errors also showcased themselves when Reshef moved his tank brigade forward; Israeli commanders neglected to conduct reconnaissance beforehand, causing their units to fall into Egyptian ambushes. In the confusion ensuing the surprise assault, no attempt <b>was</b> <b>made</b> <b>at</b> evacuating the Bar Lev garrison.|$|E
5|$|Mujaddid Ijaz {{was born}} on June 12, 1937 in Baddomalhi, British Indian Empire. His father was a medical student who died in his mid-20s of brain cancer. His mother, a homemaker, remarried. He was the third of ten {{children}} in his family. Ijaz's early education <b>was</b> <b>made</b> <b>at</b> rural village schools near Baddomalhi. He attended Islamia High School in Lahore. His early interest in science and physics was attributed to his step-father's work in the local meteorology department.|$|E
5|$|On 1 September 1922, A Farman F.60 Goliath on {{a flight}} from Croydon Airport to Paris, {{suffered}} a severely damaged propeller after flying through torrential rain whilst crossing the English Channel.

5|$|On 8 September 2011, Azad Azerbaijan TV (ATV) {{reported}} that Baku Crystal Hall {{would be the}} venue of the contest, but no formal confirmation <b>was</b> <b>made</b> <b>at</b> the time by the EBU.

On 25 January 2012, it was confirmed that the Baku Crystal Hall would be the venue of the contest. Even though the venue had an extended capacity of 23,000 people, only 16,000 people were able to attend each show. Tickets for the contest became available online for purchase on 28 February 2012.|$|E

5|$|The Russians avoided Napoleon's {{objective}} of a decisive engagement and instead retreated deeper into Russia. A brief attempt at resistance <b>was</b> <b>made</b> <b>at</b> Smolensk in August; the Russians were defeated {{in a series}} of battles, and Napoleon resumed his advance. The Russians again avoided battle, although in a few cases this was only achieved because Napoleon uncharacteristically hesitated to attack when the opportunity arose. Owing to the Russian army's scorched earth tactics, the French found it increasingly difficult to forage food for themselves and their horses.|$|E
5|$|The cavalry practised {{reconnaissance}} {{and fighting}} dismounted more regularly, and in January 1910, the decision <b>was</b> <b>made</b> <b>at</b> the General Staff Conference that dismounted cavalry {{should be taught}} infantry tactics in attack and defence. They were the only cavalry from a major European power trained for both the mounted cavalry charge and dismounted action, and equipped with the same rifles as the infantry, rather than short-range carbines. The cavalry were also issued with entrenching tools prior to the outbreak of war, {{as a result of}} experience gained during the Second Boer War.|$|E
5|$|The finds were {{purchased}} by the museum in April 2009 and underwent conservation by specialists at Durham University and York Archaeological Trust. Using tools of the Anglo-Saxon period, {{a replica of the}} bed was created for the exhibition by Richard Darrah, an expert in early woodwork, and blacksmith Hector Cole, a crafter of medieval-style ironwork. A short film about the princess <b>was</b> <b>made</b> <b>at</b> the Anglo-Saxon museum at Bede's World in Jarrow with a narration by Stephen Tompkinson. Prior to the opening of the exhibition at Kirkleatham, the finds were put on display for five days in May 2011 at Loftus Town Hall, where they attracted nearly 1,700 visitors.|$|E
