40|$|Intellectual {{property}} {{occupies a}} central {{position in the}} biotechnology innovation system, the expected source of new medicines, foods and bio-energy. An international and interdisciplinary research team has convened {{for the last seven}} years in an attempt to better understand the mechanisms of intellectual property in biotechnology innovation, and to suggest improvements to the role of intellectual property in that system. This report represents the research team?s core finding and recommendations. The core finding is that policy-makers and business leaders must give shape to a new era of intellectual property to stimulate innovation and broaden access to discoveries. The current system, ?Old IP,? rests on the belief that if some intellectual property (IP) is good, more must be better. But such thinking has proved counterproductive to industry, which in health fields has seen declining levels of innovation despite increasing stakes in intellectual property. The <b>era</b> of Old <b>IP</b> has also proved counterproductive to the world?s poor who await advances in health and agriculture long available to the global elite. The International Expert Group concluded that a ?New <b>IP?</b> <b>era</b> that focuses on cooperation and collaboration is slowly emerging. Intellectual property is meant to assist in this process by encouraging cooperation among various brokers and stakeholders. The best innovative activity occurs when everyone ? researchers, companies, government and NGOs ? works together to ensure that new ideas reach the public, but are appropriately regulated and efficiently delivered to those who need them...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Today's {{turbulent}} business environment, {{which is}} characterised by uncertainty and inability {{to predict the}} future, is extremely challenging. Mobile and Internet Protocol (IP) convergence, which brings together technologies and services from the mobile and Internet domains, {{has been identified as}} a discontinuity in the mobile telecommunications business. Additionally, new disruptive technologies are introduced together with new, complex products. This research addresses the approach that, along with introducing disruptive technologies in the mobile and <b>IP</b> convergence <b>era,</b> a new operational mode is needed in the new product development (NPD) process. This study approaches the operational mode from five perspectives: business environment, competence development, process renewal, running technology pilots, and product reliability. The research on the business environment area proposes two frameworks: one for building and describing and another for evaluating business models. The study on competence development arrives at the conclusion to propose a project management competence development framework. The third research perspective suggests that, when the business environment is changing, and disruptive technologies and continuous innovations create new kinds of products, it is likely that processes need renewal. Running technology pilots to involve customers early enough in new product development is proposed in the fourth research area. Finally, the fifth research topic proposes that it is essential for companies to be able to estimate the reliability of their products during the product development phase. It is concluded that the new operational mode when introducing disruptive technologies requires reconsidering business models, special attention to competence development, process renewal, customer involvement in new product development, and requires a means to guarantee software reliability...|$|R
40|$|Grounded in the {{business}} model literature, this paper examines business models in the Creative Industries (CI), and the of role intellectual property (IP) following the UK’s 2011 Hargreaves Review of Intellectual Property. It does so via a meta-analysis of 20 research projects, including 80 case studies, on business models in the CI, {{with a focus on}} television, film, computer games and publishing. This paper probes the research to identify CI business models, and the interaction of IP and business models. The paper makes three contributions to the literature: one, it brings together the literature on business models in the CI with IP policy against a backdrop of technological change, two, it applies the Baden-Fuller (2016) business model taxonomy to the CI, and three, it performs the first meta-analysis of business models. The analysis suggests business models in digital era have remained remarkably stable, and the CI have actively lobbied to support existing models. Methodology: Business Models and a Meta-Analysis The paper presents two methodological advances in the study of business models and the CI. First, it is the first CI study to adopt the Baden-Fuller (2016), four elemental business model taxonomy: product, solution, multi-sided triadic and matchmaker models. This framework focuses on the relationship between firms and customers, and is technology and process agnostic. This is supplemented by the Osterwalder & Pigneur (2010) Business Model Canvas, to provide a more granular understanding of changes in pricing mechanisms and value propositions. Studies of business models are dominated by qualitative, small sample studies, which suggests a systematic approach will lead to wider insights. The second contribution of this paper is applying {{the business}} model framework to qualitative meta-analysis. The scope of this analysis is limited to the studies in the Centre for Copyright and New Business Models in the Creative Economy (CREATe) at Glasgow University. This choice addresses challenges typically associated with qualitative meta-analyses by reducing variation in: chronology, definitions, populations, and the purpose of studies. The choice of studies, in which the author has been involved, also counters the common critique that researchers are unfamiliar with the studies (Stern and Harris, 1985). Following the reading of all abstracts, the population of 58 CREATe projects plus commissioned works was narrowed to 20 studies, resulting in 80 case studies. The paper also probes the Hargreaves <b>era</b> <b>IP</b> policy debates for the role of business models, industry and policy approaches to business models, and subsequent developments in copyright policy. Findings The paper demonstrates that evidence that, in the years since policy discussions on business models intensified in the UK, the CI in the sample have chosen to lobby to secure a competitive advantage, but business models have remained stable. The vast majority of business models are categorised as product models, as they have been historically. Commissioned work, common in television production companies and independent games development studios, is the second most popular category of solution based business models. Commissioning is a ‘heritage’ business model in television, and has been adopted by the nascent computer games industry. Likewise, just as newspapers have traditionally operated with a multi-sided market, where users are readers and customers are advertisers, so do platforms (e. g. YouTube) and free-to-play games. This again suggests stability in business models. Finally, matchmaking models are found only in the retail side of the industry. There is, however, an important caveat to this finding in that end-user subscription services such as Spotify, represent the introduction of a solutions model to the consumer and account for an increasing proportion of revenues. However, the overall conclusion remains business models in the CI are relatively stable. However, changes are observed in pricing mechanisms and value propositions. In pricing, firms experiment with pay-as-you-go, freemium (free basic product, paid-for “premium” product), and others. Similarly, pricing mechanisms, combined with value propositions, have shifted towards more subscription models (e. g. streaming), as opposed to product sales. The business model framework adopted in this paper does not identify these changes as new business models; however a more colloquial definition of business models might. Outside the CREATe sample, subscription services like Spotify have combined new value propositions and delivery channels to launch new service models. Yet these changes are found in a minority of cases. Change and IP The evidence for IP infringement as an impetus for business model change is scant. Both DoyleCR (2016) and Searle (2011, 2016 CR) argue IP and copying concerns do not lead to changes in business models. Creators rely on alternative, non business-model strategies to protect against any negative impact of copyright infringement. The paper establishes lobbying as a preferred business strategy in the choice between business model and copyright changes.
