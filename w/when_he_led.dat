5|$|Born in Dallas, Texas, to Noel and Freida Bosh, Chris Bosh {{grew up in}} Hutchins, Texas. A family-oriented person, Bosh often played {{basketball}} {{in the house with}} his younger brother, Joel. By four years of age, he began learning how to dribble a basketball in the gym, where his dad played pick-up games.

Apart from basketball, Bosh also played baseball up until high school, preferring to play as a first baseman. Growing up, Bosh names his parents as the biggest influences on his personality and considered NBA superstar Kevin Garnett as his favorite athlete, modeling his play after him. Academically, Bosh always did well in school, but he began to garner significant attention from college recruiters <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>led</b> Lincoln High School in Dallas to the number one ranking in the country and the USA Today National Championship with a perfect 40–0 season.|$|E
5|$|He {{enjoyed a}} {{successful}} post-war career {{working for the}} U.S. government as a diplomat, civil servant, and administrator. His conversion to the Republican Party and his cooperation with his old friend, President Ulysses S.

His reputation in the South further suffered <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>led</b> African-American militia against the anti-Reconstruction White League at the Battle of Liberty Place in 1874. Authors of the Lost Cause movement focused on Longstreet's actions at Gettysburg as a primary reason for the Confederacy's loss of the war. Since the late 20th century, his reputation has undergone a slow reassessment. Many Civil War historians now consider him among the war's most gifted tactical commanders.|$|E
