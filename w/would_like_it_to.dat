500|$|According to author Amy Dempsey, {{during the}} Cold War, Rockwell's images affirmed {{traditional}} American values, depicting Americans as prosperous and free. Rockwell's work {{came to be}} categorized within art movements and styles such as Regionalism and American scene painting. Rockwell's work sometimes displays an idealized vision of America's rural and agricultural past. Rockwell summed up his own idealism: [...] "I paint life as I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be." ...|$|E

[...] During a Q session in January 2009, Chabon added that he was writing a [...] "naturalistic" [...] novel about two families in Berkeley. In a March 2010 {{interview with}} the Guardian newspaper, Chabon added that [...] "So far there's no overtly genre content: it's set in the present day and has no alternate reality or anything like that." ...|$|E

5000|$|After its release, Cale {{expressed}} {{disappointment in}} the album's mix: [...] "The trouble {{is is that}} we had an opportunity here with the live album to really show what the band sounded <b>like</b> and <b>it</b> really doesn't give <b>it</b> <b>to</b> you. Some of the bootlegs {{that came out of}} the tour are almost a truer vision of what the band sounded like than the well recorded one, because the well recorded one really didn't take advantage of the ambiance of the room in the mix of the music. And that's what we were always pushing at. We wanted to fill the room up with this noise. Unfortunately it wasn't quite as present in the mix as I <b>would</b> have <b>liked</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be or others <b>would</b> have <b>liked</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be either." ...|$|R
500|$|The Four Freedoms {{are perhaps}} Rockwell's most famous work. Some {{have said that}} Rockwell's Four Freedoms lack artistic maturity. [...] Others have pointed to the {{universality}} of the Freedom of Religion as disconcerting to practitioners of particular faiths. [...] Others complained that he idealized American life because by depicting wholesome, healthy, and happy sentiments, Rockwell depicted the good that was remembered or wished for, but by avoiding misery, poverty, and social unrest, he failed to demonstrate command of {{the bad and the}} ugly parts of American life. Rockwell's response to this criticism was, [...] "I paint life as I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be." [...] Rockwell made it known that he hoped these would be his masterpieces, but was disappointed. Nonetheless, he was satisfied with the public acceptance of the series and that the series was able to serve such a patriotic purpose. Laura Claridge feels he might have achieved his ambition if he had pursued the [...] "quiet small scenes" [...] he later became known for.|$|E
500|$|Just {{days before}} the episodes were set to {{transmit}} Channel 4 {{announced that it was}} axing the storyline, due in part to Fergus's reaction to the storyline. Whilst Walton had previously claimed the storyline was about three twelve-year-old girls, Channel 4 admitted the similarities between the story and the Bulger case. [...] "This particular storyline was not based on any real life case and was not intended to recreate actual events. However, after conversations with Denise Fergus we have agreed to amend certain aspects of the storyline." [...] Amber Hodgkiss, who was cast to play Chrissy, expressed her disappointment over the decision to axe the plot all together saying, [...] "The storyline has been completely cut. I am not so happy about it. I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> go ahead, but I don't have that decision. It wasn't based on Jamie Bulger, but people portrayed it that way. It was quite a big storyline that could affect people, but it happens." [...] Fergus said she was grateful that the plot was axed saying, [...] "I'm grateful that they are respecting my wishes. I made it clear that I did not want those scenes broadcast and I'm pleased to say they clearly understood my feelings." ...|$|E

2500|$|Fans {{often use}} portmanteaux {{to refer to}} their {{favorite}} couples on online message boards, a significant aspect of the [...] "shipping fandom". The [...] "shipping fandom" [...] scene, whose name {{is derived from the}} word [...] "relationship", is a general term for fans' emotional or intellectual involvement with the ongoing development of romance in a work of fiction. Though technically applicable to any such involvement, it refers chiefly to various related social dynamics observable on the Internet, and is seldom used outside of that context. [...] "Shipping" [...] can involve virtually any kind of relationship—from the well-known and established, to the ambiguous or those undergoing development, and even to the highly improbable and the blatantly impossible. People involved in shipping (or shippers) assert that the relationship does exist, will exist, or simply that they <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> exist.|$|E

Philip French, in his review for The Observer, wrote, [...] "But is the joyless universe he (Anderson) presents any more convincing than the Pollyanna optimism of traditional sitcoms? These lives are somehow too stunted and pathetic to achieve the level of tragedy". Time magazine's Richard Schickel wrote, [...] "The result is a hard-striving, convoluted movie, which never quite becomes the smoothly reciprocating engine Anderson (who did Boogie Nights) <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be".|$|E

I think there are gestures being made that have definitely advanced from where we were a year ago." [...] In response to complaints about {{the pace of the}} development, he said, [...] "There are a lot of fans {{who would like to see}} that story advance much faster than we're doing it, but I firmly believe a little goes a long way and there are ways to tease it and to flirt that are just as significant and just as meaningful." [...] He maintained, [...] "We made huge strides. Their relationship has evolved, has changed. They're a little more open with each other and a little more emotionally connected, certainly more than where we were at the beginning of the season. [...] may not be the big leap that a lot of people <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be, but I also feel like we're enjoying the pace at which this is happening. That's not to say we're not headed in the direction everyone would like to go, but I think we’re getting there. It's very complicated when two agents who are working together get into a relationship, and that's something that [...] would be very conscious of. So I think they would tread lightly, which is why, in theory, we're treading lightly and being very careful about the steps that we take." ...|$|E
2500|$|By the 83rd Minnesota Legislative Session Lindner {{had already}} faced an ethics {{complaint}} before. This {{was a result}} of his reaction to the request of Rep. Paymar. His first complaint stemmed from a May 2000 incident after the Republican Party took control of the House and some members felt that the prayers opening the session were becoming too sectarian. [...] "For many, things went too far when House leaders recently brought in a choir to open the day's session with a musical rendition of the Apostles' Creed." [...] In light of this Rep. Michael Paymar (DFL-St. Paul) who is Jewish said [...] "I would like {{to be part of that}} moment where a religious leader gets up before us and has a prayer. But I would like that to be non-denominational, and I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be respectful of who I am." [...] In response to his and others' concerns a rule was passed [...] "requiring that in the future, prayer be non-denominational." [...] In responding to Paymar, Lindner said [...] "You know, we're told there's one God and one mediator between God and man. That man is Jesus Christ. And most of us here are Christians. And we shouldn't be left not able to pray in the name of our God....And if you don't like it, you may have to like it-Or just don't come. I don't come sometimes for some prayers here....We have that privilege, and you need to exercise it. But don't impose your irreligious left views on me." [...] Rep. Matt Entenza (DFL-St. Paul), called on Lindner [...] "to rethink his comments. When Lindner refused to reply, Entenza put forth a 'protest of dissent' petition asking the House Ethics Committee to reprimand Lindner.
