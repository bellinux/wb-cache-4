Lieutenant Warren Springer and the other three men, Sergeant Peter Gacki, T/4 Willard Wibben, and T/5 Billy Queen joined Bouck's unit on the ridge <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> {{continue}} to observe the enemy movement. Bouck distributed them among the foxholes to help reload magazines and reinforce their position.|$|E
5|$|Influenced by the Völkisch movement, {{the regime}} was against {{cultural}} modernism {{and supported the}} development of an extensive military at the expense of intellectualism. Creativity and art were stifled, except <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> serve as propaganda media. The party used symbols such as the Blood Flag and rituals such as the Nazi Party rallies to foster unity and bolster the regime's popularity.|$|E

5|$|Over time, the game's {{mechanisms}} for contacting players grew more complex. Players were sent messages via email, called on their cell phones, and travelled to arranged meetings between players and characters.

5|$|The Model 1897 {{was used}} by American troops for {{purposes}} in World War I other than a force multiplier. American soldiers who were skilled at trap shooting were armed with these guns and stationed <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> fire at enemy hand grenades in midair. This would deflect the grenades from falling into the American trenches and therefore protect American soldiers.|$|E
5|$|The loyalists {{were unaware}} that Đính's real {{intention}} was to engulf Saigon with his rebel divisions and lock Tung's loyalists in the countryside <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not defend the president.

The riders in the machines poinçonnées category {{had to use the}} same bicycle in the entire race, and to verify this, their bicycles were marked.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the war many of {{the ships}} were placed in reserve or sent to foreign stations, often as the flagship. During the Third Carlist War of 1872–76 Thétis, Reine Blanche and Jeanne d'Arc spent time in Spanish waters <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> protect French {{citizens}} and interests. In 1875, the latter ship rammed and sank the dispatch vessel Forfait. On 3 July 1877 Thétis rammed Reine Blanche who had to be run ashore to prevent her from sinking.|$|E
5|$|Although condoms {{effectively}} {{prevent the}} sexual transmission of HIV, several factors have limited widespread condom distribution and uptake in Malawi. People living in non-urban areas often have difficulty accessing condoms, and condoms are not typically available at bars {{and other social}} locations <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> {{have a significant impact}} on HIV prevention. Many people oppose condoms because they believe that condoms make sex less enjoyable or because they question their ability to prevent the transmission of HIV. However, despite these factors, many unmarried couples have started using condoms more consistently as concern and fear about the HIV/AIDS epidemic have increased.|$|E

5|$|Chadwick dropped all {{his other}} {{responsibilities}} {{to concentrate on}} proving {{the existence of the}} neutron, assisted by Feather and frequently working late at night. He devised a simple apparatus that consisted of a cylinder containing a polonium source and beryllium target. The resulting radiation could then be directed at a material such as paraffin wax; the displaced particles, which were protons, would go into a small ionisation chamber <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> be detected with an oscilloscope.|$|E
5|$|Early Dutch missionaries faced strong {{opposition}} among Torajans, {{especially among the}} elite, because the abolition of their profitable slave trade had angered them. Some Torajans were forcibly relocated to the lowlands by the Dutch, <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> be more easily controlled. Taxes were kept high, undermining {{the wealth of the}} elites. Ultimately, the Dutch influence did not subdue Torajan culture, and only a few Torajans were converted. In 1950, only 10% of the population had converted to Christianity.|$|E
5|$|First Light {{follows the}} {{adventure}} of two protagonists, Peter, who lives {{with his mother and}} father in New York but is in Greenland for his father's research, and Thea, who lives in an underground colony in Greenland called Gracehope. Gracehope was formed hundreds of years ago by a group called the Settlers who used to live in England. They possessed unusual abilities, such as extremely good vision and hearing, leading them to be called 'eye adepts' and 'ear adepts', respectively. These powers were seen as sorcery, prompting Grace, the leader of the Settlers, to bring the Settlers under the ice in Greenland <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> live in peace.|$|E

Bradshaw, whom Krueger had first encountered during the Louisiana maneuvers. The top graduates of the six-week training course were assigned to the Alamo Scouts; the other graduates were returned to their units <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> be used for similar work. By the end of the war, Alamo Scouts teams had conducted 106 missions.|$|E
5|$|Many Indiana {{residents}} {{participated in}} the underground railroad. Two major arteries in the underground railroad traveled through Indiana. Tell City, Evansville, and Jeffersonville were two gateways to the underground railroad. An important stopover was Westfield, where food and hiding places were provided to slaves trying to reach Canada. Other safe houses dotted Indiana, including one in Town Clock Church (pictured). Escaping slaves who entered Indiana would be ferried from safe house to safe house northward, usually into Michigan, <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> cross safely to Windsor, in Ontario, Canada.|$|E
