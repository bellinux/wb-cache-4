5|$|The {{main problem}} remains, as Jona Lendering points out, {{that most of}} the things we know about Aspasia are based on mere hypothesis. Thucydides does not mention her; our only sources are the untrustworthy {{representations}} and speculations recorded by men in literature and philosophy, who did not care at all about Aspasia as a historical character. Therefore, in the figure of Aspasia, <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> range of contradictory portrayals; she is either a good wife like Theano or some combination of courtesan and prostitute like Thargelia. This is the reason modern scholars express their scepticism about the historicity of Aspasia's life.|$|E
5|$|We {{probably}} have more influences than {{we know what}} to do with. We have two main styles that have been influences. For instance, we like Black Flag as much as early Bob Dylan and Dinosaur Jr. as much as Hank Williams... To us, hard-core punk is also folk music. We draw a close parallel between the two. We'll play both in the same set if <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> chance. We don't have any biases as far as music is concerned.|$|E

25|$|By equating the topological and {{analytical}} indices {{we get the}} Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem. In fact <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> generalization of it to all complex manifolds: Hirzebruch's proof only worked for projective complex manifolds X.|$|E
25|$|For n = 2 <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> {{projective}} {{plane of}} order 2, {{also called the}} Fano plane, with v = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7 points and 7 lines. In the Fano plane, each line has n+1 = 3 points and each point belongs to n+1=3 lines.|$|E

25|$|More generally, spinor {{groups and}} pin groups over any field have similar {{representations}} whose exact structure {{depends on the}} structure of the corresponding Clifford algebras: whenever a Clifford algebra has a factor that is a matrix algebra over some division algebra, <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> corresponding representation of the pin and spin groups over that division algebra.|$|E
25|$|One {{reason for}} {{the large number of}} options is that, as noted previously, {{rotations}} in three dimensions (and higher) do not commute. If we reverse a given sequence of rotations, <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> different outcome. This also implies that we cannot compose two rotations by adding their corresponding angles. Thus Euler angles are not vectors, despite a similarity in appearance as a triplet of numbers.|$|E

25|$|The {{real problem}} is what this movie says about us. When those Abu Ghraib {{pictures}} came out years ago, {{at least half of}} America was horrified. The national consensus (albeit by a frighteningly slim margin) was that this wasn't who we, as a people, wanted to be. But now, four years later, Zero Dark Thirty comes out, and it seems that that we've become so blunted to the horror of what we did and/or are doing at Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo and Bagram and other places that we can accept it, provided <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> boffo movie out of it.|$|E
25|$|Frescoes {{painted on}} the barrel vault in the nave were almost destroyed, which {{contained}} standing figures of Prophets from Old Testament. That conclusion became according to the small remains of the frescoes on that place of nave, which for iconographic was quite expected. On the southern half, {{the eastern part of}} that, on frescoes was illustrated few standing figures so when we look how much frescoes are destroyed {{in that part of the}} church, <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> conclusion that at least there have been 10 or more figures on one side of arch, so above 20 in total.|$|E

500|$|Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times gave a {{negative}} review. He disliked {{the characterization of}} Chuck Barris and commented that [...] "with its multiplicity of over-stylized looks and slick gimmicks, Dangerous Mind was doubtless more stimulating to direct than {{it will be for}} audiences to experience." [...] Internet reviewer James Berardinelli wrote a mixed critique. [...] "George Clooney is eager to show how much he has learned {{at the hands of the}} A-list filmmakers he has toiled under. So <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> style that is about 50% Steven Soderbergh and 50% Coen brothers. Sometimes it works, but mostly it comes across as too artsy, with all sorts of bizarre angles and unusual shots." ...|$|E
500|$|Andre Dellamorte of Collider called Item 47 [...] "silly". William Bibbiani of Crave Online said, [...] "The short {{is largely}} a success: [...] Hernandez, [...] Bradford and [...] Caplan are all in fine form although, [...] Welliver seems saddled with a little awkward dialogue, {{particularly}} in regards to Coulson, which doesn’t entirely sell." [...] Spencer Terry of Superhero Hype! said, [...] " [...] is easily the best one they've done, and I think that {{can be attributed to}} its length seeing as it's three times longer than the other One-Shots. With a longer run time, the short film doesn't have to rush to show us everything that it wants to - <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> clear understanding of both the S.H.I.E.L.D. perspective of the events and the robbers' point of view." ...|$|E
500|$|Roger Moore, {{the third}} actor to play Bond in the films, said that Craig was a [...] "damn good Bond {{but the film}} as a whole, {{there was a bit}} too much flash cutting [...] it was just like a {{commercial}} of the action. There didn't seem to be any geography and you were wondering what the hell was going on." [...] Kim Newman of Empire gave it 4/5, remarking it was not [...] "bigger and better than Casino Royale, [...] perhaps a smart move in that there's still a sense at the finish that Bond's mission has barely begun." [...] However, he expressed nostalgia for the more humorous Bond films. The Sunday Times review noted that [...] "following Casino Royale {{was never going to be}} easy, but the director Marc Forster has brought the brand's successful relaunch crashing back to earth – with a yawn"; the screenplay [...] "is at times incomprehensible" [...] and the casting [...] "is a mess." [...] The review concludes that [...] "Bond has been stripped of his iconic status. He no longer represents anything particularly British, or even modern. In place of glamour, <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> spurious grit; instead of style, we get product placement; in place of fantasy, <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> redundant and silly realism." [...] The Guardian gave a more positive review, rating it as 3/5 stars, and was particularly fond of Craig's performance, saying he [...] "made the part his own, every inch the coolly ruthless agent-killer, nursing a broken heart and coldly suppressed rage" [...] and calling the film [...] "a crash-bang Bond, high on action, low on quips, long on location glamour, short on product placement"; it concludes [...] "Quantum of Solace isn't as good as Casino Royale: the smart elegance of Craig's Bond debut has been toned down in favour of conventional action. But the man himself powers this movie; he carries the film: it's an indefinably difficult task for an actor. Craig measures up." ...|$|E

500|$|Criticism was {{directed}} {{at some of the}} character's aspects, and toward the introduction of the character. Jim Johnson-Smith, in American Science Fiction TV, uses an example of Ezri and Worf's concentration on their romantic relationship in the episode [...] "'Til Death Do Us Part" [...] instead of being more concerned with their capture by the Breen. Ezri was described as [...] "an ill-conceived idea that never really took off and has left many DS9 fans angry that a show favourite (Jadzia Dax) isn't around any more" [...] by the website Flickering Myth. The review on DVD Talk also stated [...] "With its large ensemble cast, DS9 could have gone on perfectly well without a replacement for Jadzia. Instead, <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> [...] "replacement Dax" [...] who turns out to be, hands down, the least interesting and most annoying character DS9 has been stuck with." ...|$|E
500|$|Following the {{re-election}} of the Syriza-ANEL coalition, Tsakalotos was tipped {{to resume}} the role of Minister of Finance, however the state media reported that {{he was reluctant to}} do so. Nonetheless, he was reappointed as Minister of Finance on 23 September, as part of the Tsipras' second cabinet. Chouliarakis, the interim Minister of Finance, was retained in the finance ministry as an Alternate Minister of Finance. Later in September, {{in an interview with the}} Financial Times, Tsakalotos said that it was [...] "absolutely critical that we get something on debt relief." [...] He added: [...] "By the second quarter of 2016, if <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> positive review, bank recapitalisation and debt relief, I don’t see any reason why there shouldn’t be a return to growth." [...] He also said that the new government would make serious attempts to crack down on tax evasion: [...] "It will be a central aspect of our policies, which will determine the success of the government, because it’s the only way the Greek people will accept difficult measures that show we’re all in the same boat." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Maz Hallima of Flavour Magazine, [...] "Do Ya Thang" [...] {{has a very}} [...] "teenager-ish vibe" [...] which {{according}} to her works well, however she is aware why Rihanna kept it as a bonus track of the album. Sam Lansky of MTV Buzzworthy wrote that the song [...] "can't be beat for sheer likability". He further noted that Rihanna is stepping back from her [...] "hypersexual persona to sing a more earnest, good-natured tune". Michael Jepson of The Fourth State concluded that [...] "Do Ya Thang", together with [...] "Cockiness (Love It)" [...] and [...] "Roc Me Out", are the top candidates from Talk That Talk that can be labeled as the album's [...] "highlights". According to Jepson, all three songs are [...] "blatantly raunchy" [...] and feel like a follow up to Rihanna's 2011 single [...] "S" [...] (Loud, 2011). Shaun Kitchener of EntertainmentWise concluded that Rihanna [...] "takes a breather for 'Do Ya Thang', and <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> rare glimpse of Sweet Loving Rihanna instead." ...|$|E
