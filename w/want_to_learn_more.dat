25|$|The {{value of}} Riis's {{autobiography}} {{lies in the}} description of his origins as a social reformer. His early experiences in Ribe gave Riis a yardstick with which to measure tenement dwellers’ quality of life. The account of the development of his powers of observation through his experiences as a poor immigrant lent authenticity to his news articles and larger works. Its themes about self-sufficiency, perseverance, and material success are prime examples of an archetype that successful Europeans like Riis used to demonstrate the exceptional opportunities that seem to exist only in the United States. In spite of its triumphalist outlook, The Making of an American remains useful as a source for students of immigration history and sociology who <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>more</b> about the author of How The Other Half Lives and the social reform movement that he helped to define.|$|E
2500|$|The {{time is the}} present. Following {{some time}} {{teaching}} in Winnebago, Wisconsin, Bertram Cope, 24, arrives at the University to spend a year as an instructor in English literature. Living modestly, he cultivates {{the society of the}} well-to-do middle-aged with fine homes. At an afternoon tea, he makes a favorable impression on Mrs. Medora Phillips, the wealthy widow of an art dealer, and Basil Randolph, an [...] "academic manqué," [...] a stockbroker and a collector of books and curiosities. Phillips sees Cope as an interesting addition to her salons. Randolph sees him as a candidate for mentoring. Cope visits Mrs. Phillips at home and she continues a conversational style Cope describes as [...] "pretending to quarrel as a means of entertaining you."(24) Though Cope says little of note and sings several airs without distinction, he is judged favorably. Mrs. Phillips teases him for lacking any interest in the girls she introduces to him. Randolph, who occasionally entertains undergraduates [...] "who readily forgot and quickly dropped you,"(40) researches Cope's background and discusses him with Mrs. Phillips, concluding that Cope has [...] "more than one touch of gentility."(42) Randolph visits Mrs. Phillips' wheelchair-using [...] tenant, Joe Foster, her late husband's half-brother, and learns that she imagines Cope may prove a match for one of the three girls who live in her house, Amy, Hortense, and Carolyn. From his quarters upstairs, Joe heard Cope's singing and was impressed enough to <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>more</b> of Cope. When Mrs. Phillips invites Randolph to a young people's dinner that will include Cope, he feels [...] "a slight stir of elation."(54) ...|$|E
