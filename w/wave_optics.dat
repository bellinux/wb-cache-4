25|$|Classical optics {{is divided}} into two main branches: {{geometrical}} (or ray) optics and physical (or <b>wave)</b> <b>optics.</b> In geometrical optics, light is considered to travel in straight lines, while in physical optics, light is considered as an electromagnetic wave.|$|E
25|$|Newtonian optics was {{generally}} accepted {{until the early}} 19th century when Thomas Young and Augustin-Jean Fresnel conducted experiments on the interference of light that firmly established light's wave nature. Young's famous double slit experiment showed that light followed the law of superposition, which is a wave-like property not predicted by Newton's corpuscle theory. This work led to a theory of diffraction for light and opened an entire area of study in physical optics. <b>Wave</b> <b>optics</b> was successfully unified with electromagnetic theory by James Clerk Maxwell in the 1860s.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{confocal}} cavity a ray, {{which is}} deviated {{from its original}} direction in the middle between the of the cavity, is maximally (compared to other cavities) displaced on the return to the middle. This prevents amplified spontaneous emission and is important for a good beam quality and [...] high power amplifiers. In <b>wave</b> <b>optics</b> this is expressed by the eigenvalue degeneration of the modes. On every turn to the left, the 0,0 mode and the 1,0 mode are 90° out of phase, but on the turn back, they are 180° out of phase [...] Interference of the modes then leads to a displacement.|$|E

2500|$|Optics {{began with}} the {{development}} of lenses by the ancient Egyptians and Mesopotamians, followed by theories on light and vision developed by ancient Greek philosophers, and the development of geometrical optics in the Greco-Roman world. The word optics is derived from the Greek term τα ὀπτικά meaning [...] "appearance, look". Optics was significantly reformed by the developments in the medieval Islamic world, such as the beginnings of physical and physiological optics, and then significantly advanced in early modern Europe, where diffractive optics began. These earlier studies on optics are now known as [...] "classical optics". The term [...] "modern optics" [...] refers to areas of optical research that largely developed in the 20th century, such as <b>wave</b> <b>optics</b> and quantum optics.|$|E

5000|$|Fourier optics is {{somewhat}} different from ordinary ray optics typically {{used in the}} analysis and design of focused imaging systems such as cameras, telescopes and microscopes. Ray optics is the very first type of optics most of us encounter in our lives; it's simple to conceptualize and understand, and works very well in gaining a baseline understanding of common optical devices. Unfortunately, ray optics does not explain the operation of Fourier optical systems, which are in general not focused systems. Ray optics is a subset of <b>wave</b> <b>optics</b> (in the jargon, it is [...] "the asymptotic zero-wavelength limit" [...] of <b>wave</b> <b>optics)</b> and therefore has limited applicability. We have to know when it is valid {{and when it is}} not - {{and this is one of}} those times when it is not. For our current task, we must expand our understanding of optical phenomena to encompass <b>wave</b> <b>optics,</b> in which the optical field is seen as a solution to Maxwell's equations. This more general <b>wave</b> <b>optics</b> accurately explains the operation of Fourier optics devices.|$|E

40|$|Evidence is {{presented}} of universal behavior in modulationally unstable media. An ensemble of nonlinear evolution equations, including three partial differential equations, an integro-differential equation, a nonlocal {{system and a}} differential-difference equation, is studied.

All these models exhibit modulational instability, namely, the property that a constant background is unstable to long-wavelength perturbations. In this work, each of these systems is studied analytically and numerically for a number of different initial perturbations of the constant background, and it is shown that, for all systems and for all initial conditions considered, the dynamics gives rise to a remarkably similar structure comprised of two outer, quiescent sectors separated by a wedge-shaped central region characterized by modulated periodic oscillations. A heuristic criterion that allows one to compute some of the properties of the central oscillation region is also given. Comment: 19 pages, 12 figures; to appear in SIAM Revie...|$|R

Secondly, they are interactive. The user can change the parameters either by typing in the desired values into the appropriate text entry box, or by using the mouse cursor to move the appropriate widget in the scene. Thirdly, the simulations are animated, for those phenomena for which animation is appropriate.
