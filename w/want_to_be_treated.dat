500|$|On 7 May, Quisling ordered police not {{to offer}} armed {{resistance}} to the Allied advance except in self-defence or against overt members of the Norwegian resistance movement. The same day, Germany announced it would surrender unconditionally, making Quisling's position untenable. A realist, Quisling met military leaders of the resistance {{on the following day}} to discuss how he would be arrested. Quisling declared whilst he did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> as a common criminal, he did not want preferential treatment compared to his Nasjonal Samling colleagues. He argued he could have kept his forces fighting until the end, but had chosen not to so as to avoid turning [...] "Norway into a battlefield." [...] Instead he tried to ensure a peaceful transition. In return, the resistance offered full trials for all accused Nasjonal Samling members after the war and its leadership agreed he could be incarcerated in a house rather than a prison complex.|$|E

The parade received substantial police protection, and no anti-gay violence was reported. It was more festive than in previous years, with pop music, balloons and giant rainbow flags. Several European officials attended, including MEPs Michael Cashman, Michel Teychenné and Helene Goudin, the Ambassadors of the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, the Czech Republic and Sweden, {{the directors of the}} Polish Institute and Goethe Institute in Bucharest, and Boris Dittrich, the LGBT rights director at Human Rights Watch.

Letters of support were received from the French Ambassador to Romania, as well as three openly-LGBT officials from the United Kingdom: Angela Eagle, Ben Bradshaw and Chris Bryant.|$|E
2500|$|According to Bergler, {{there are}} several {{different}} types of homosexuality. He identifies twelve types that {{he refers to as}} puberal homosexuality, active and passive roles in full-fledged perversion, homosexuality as an unconscious search for a duplicate of oneself as a boy, homosexuality of the positive magic gesture type, homosexuality of the negative magic gesture type, homosexuality of the protective type, homosexuality of the seeking the older protector type, homosexuality combined with other types of perversions, the bisexual, homosexuality of the criminal institution type, and homosexuality in fantasy. Bergler describes puberal homosexuality as harmless, and denies that it is [...] "indicative of future homosexuality", criticizing Kinsey for including prepuberbal and early puberal sex play among boys in his estimates of homosexual activity among males. Bergler writes that while a relationship between [...] "active" [...] and [...] "passive" [...] homosexuals may appear to be an imitation of the [...] "husband-wife relationship", it actually reenacts the relationship between a mother and her baby. He considers homosexuals who unconsciously search for duplicates of themselves as a boys to be dangerous because of their sexual interest in minors. Homosexuality of the positive magic gesture type involves a conflict between the unconscious ego and the inner conscience, which is expressed by performing a [...] "good dead" [...] toward a person such as a stranger, while that of the negative magic gesture type involves actions intended to show how the homosexual does not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>treated.</b>|$|E

The treatments did relieve some of the symptoms and were very popular with the Hawaiian patients.

6000|$|If anyone, {{impressed}} by my {{view that the}} rights of a child are precisely those of an adult, proceeds to treat a child {{as if it were}} an adult, he (or she) will find that though the plan will work much better at some points than the usual plan, at others it will not work at all; and this discovery may provoke him to turn back from the whole conception of children's rights with a jest at the expense of bachelors' and old maids' children. In dealing with children what is needed is not logic but sense. There is no logical reason why young persons should be allowed greater control of their property the day after they are twenty-one than the day before it. There is no logical reason why I, who strongly object to an adult standing over a boy of ten with a Latin grammar, and saying, [...] "you must learn this, whether you want to or not," [...] should nevertheless be quite prepared to stand over a boy of five with the multiplication table or a copy book or a code of elementary good manners, and practice on his docility to make him learn them. And there is no logical reason why I should do for a child a great many little offices, some of them troublesome and disagreeable, which I should not do for a boy twice its age, or support a boy or girl when I would unhesitatingly throw an adult on his own resources. But there are practical reasons, and sensible reasons, and affectionate reasons for all these illogicalities. Children do not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> altogether as adults: such treatment terrifies them and over-burdens them with responsibility. In truth, very few adults care to be called on for independence and originality: they also are bewildered and terrified in the absence of precedents and precepts and commandments; but modern Democracy allows them a sanctioning and cancelling power if they are capable of using it, which children are not. To treat a child wholly as an adult would be to mock and destroy it. Infantile docility and juvenile dependence are, like death, a product of Natural Selection; and though there is no viler crime than to abuse them, yet there is no greater cruelty than to ignore them. I have complained sufficiently of what I suffered through the process of assault, imprisonment, and compulsory lessons that taught me nothing, which are called my schooling. But I could say a good deal also about the things I was not taught and should have been taught, not to mention the things I was allowed to do which I should not have been allowed to do. I have no recollection of being taught to read or write; so I presume I was born with both faculties; but many people seem to have bitter recollections of being forced reluctantly to acquire them. And though I have the uttermost contempt for a teacher so ill mannered and incompetent as to be unable to make a child learn to read and write without also making it cry, still I am prepared to admit that I had rather have been compelled to learn to read and write with tears by an incompetent and ill mannered person than left in ignorance. Reading, writing, and enough arithmetic to use money honestly and accurately, together with the rudiments of law and order, become necessary conditions of a child's liberty before it can appreciate the importance of its liberty, or foresee that these accomplishments are worth acquiring. Nature has provided for this by evolving the instinct of docility. Children are very docile: they have a sound intuition that they must do what they are told or perish. And adults have an intuition, equally sound, that they must take advantage of this docility to teach children how to live properly or the children will not survive. The difficulty is to know where to stop. To illustrate this, let us consider the main danger of childish docility and parental officiousness.|$|E
