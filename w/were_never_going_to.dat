5|$|We {{all had a}} {{collective}} feeling like we'd had enough {{of this kind of}} shit. It wasn't anything tangible anybody said to anyone else, it was just kind of like everything over the years had come to a head on that one particular night in the one particular place, and it was not an organized demonstration... Everyone in the crowd felt that we <b>were</b> <b>never</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> go back. It was like the last straw. It was time to reclaim something that had always been taken from us.... All kinds of people, all different reasons, but mostly it was total outrage, anger, sorrow, everything combined, and everything just kind of ran its course. It was the police who were doing most of the destruction. We were really trying to get back in and break free. And we felt that we had freedom at last, or freedom to at least show that we demanded freedom. We weren't going to be walking meekly in the night and letting them shove us around—it's like standing your ground {{for the first time and}} in a really strong way, and that's what caught the police by surprise. There was something in the air, freedom a long time overdue, and we're going to fight for it. It took different forms, but the bottom line was, we weren't going to go away. And we didn't.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} Test, England made a tortuous 133 in 115 four-ball overs, with George 'Joey' Palmer taking 7 for 68. By close of {{play on the}} first day, Australia were in the driving seat at 86 for 1. Whilst England {{recovered}} to dismiss them for 197 and then made 232 themselves, they <b>were</b> <b>never</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> stop Australia getting the 169 runs they needed to win. The third Test was even more one-sided. England got 188. Then Australia made 262, with Percy McDonnell making 147, Alec Bannerman 70, and no other batsman scoring more than 7! England again collapsed to 134, and Australia won by 6 wickets.|$|E
500|$|Tim Miller and cinematographer Ken Seng {{wanted the}} film to look [...] "grittier and less clean and glossy" [...] than other superhero films, and decided to shoot with digital cameras but add film grain in {{post-production}} to keep texture in the images. Seng used Super Baltar lenses and Cooke zooms for the origin story timeline, opposed to Panavision primo lenses for the Deadpool scenes which gave them more clarity. Exterior scenes in the film have a consistent overcast look, but location shooting came with [...] "unpredictable" [...] weather. For instance, the production had use of the Georgia Viaduct for two weeks, and [...] "just had to keep shooting, rain or shine, because once our permit expired on the bridge, we <b>were</b> <b>never</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> get it back." [...] Seng used more lighting on cloudy days and less on sunny days to keep the look consistent. Production designer Sean Haworth also worked closely with Miller, who had specific ideas for the sets. The production {{had to be very}} specific about which elements of each set were built physically to conserve the budget for visual effects. For the final scrapyard scene, garbage was built to a certain height to be extended with CGI, and a gimbal was used for a tilting section of the yard that had to interact with a lot of digital elements. That final sequence was filmed in a naval yard, and was dressed with scrap metal. Rubber casts of the metal were made for stunts.|$|E

500|$|The band's break, {{according}} to Mick Pyro, {{came as a}} result of ten days recording time they won in [...] "some competition or something, some fucking battle of the bands". In 2003, Republic of Loose signed to Big Cat Records. The single [...] "Girl I'm Gonna Fuck You Up", released in late 2003, was largely ignored by daytime radio in Ireland, with Mick Pyro commenting in an early Hot Press interview: [...] "We <b>were</b> <b>never</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be the type of band that Larry Gogan or Ian Dempsey would play anyway, regardless of the lyric". The band's debut album, This is the Tomb of the Juice, was partially recorded in the ten days studio time they had won in the aforementioned competition. This is the Tomb of the Juice was recorded in 2003 then released in 2004. 2004 was also the year in which Republic of Loose débuted at Oxegen (on the New Band Stage), a festival at which they have since regularly performed. Singles [...] "Comeback Girl" [...] and [...] "You Know It" [...] were released in July and October 2005 respectively, both achieving significant airplay on Irish radio and entering the top thirty of the Irish Singles Chart. By 2006 the band had toured Ireland, the United Kingdom, where they performed at festivals such as Glastonbury and T in the Park, and France, where they performed at Furia Sound Festival, Nice Jazz Festival and Les Transmusicales. They also performed alongside veteran rock band Lir at Vicar Street in January 2006.|$|E
2500|$|In addition, Dreamgirls was {{the first}} film in Academy Award history to receive {{the highest number of}} {{nominations}} for the year, yet not be nominated for Best Picture. The film's failure to gain a Best Picture or Best Director nod was widely viewed by the entertainment press as a [...] "snub" [...] by the Academy. Some journalists registered shock, others cited a [...] "backlash". On the other hand, director Bill Condon stated that [...] "I think academy members just liked the other movies better" [...] and that he believed that [...] "we <b>were</b> <b>never</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> win even if we were nominated." [...] Reports emerged of significant behind-the-scenes in-fighting between the DreamWorks and Paramount camps, in particular between DreamWorks' David Geffen and Paramount CEO Brad Grey, over decision making and credit-claiming during the Dreamgirls awards campaign.|$|E
2500|$|At Hermione's urging, Harry forms {{a secret}} student {{organisation}} called Dumbledore's Army to teach more meaningful defence {{against the dark}} arts as Professor Umbridge is making them read off a textbook. Their plan is thwarted, however, when a Dumbledore's Army member, Marietta Edgecombe, betrays them and informs Umbridge about the D.A., causing Dumbledore to be ousted as Headmaster. Harry suffers another emotional blow, when his beloved godfather, Sirius, is killed during a duel with Sirius' cousin, the Death Eater Bellatrix Lestrange, at the Department of Mysteries, but Harry ultimately defeats Voldemort's plan to steal an important prophecy. Rowling stated: [...] "And now he [...] will rise from the ashes strengthened." [...] A side plot of Order of the Phoenix involves Harry's romance with Cho Chang, but the relationship quickly unravels. Says Rowling: [...] "They <b>were</b> <b>never</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be happy, it was better that it ended early!" ...|$|E

2500|$|On 16 October, Catalogue was {{published}} by Thames & Hudson, a 336-page hardcover book, written by Philip Hoare and Chris Heath, detailing their entire visual output (photography, {{as well as the}} design of albums, videos, tours, books and fan club magazines) from 1984 to 2004. Neil Tennant comments in the book: [...] "In the beginning we made a decision – and it was in our EMI contract – that that we would have control over how everything worked; that obviously the songs mattered hugely, but the way they were presented was going to matter hugely as well; and that we <b>were</b> <b>never</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> give up on that." [...] Pet Shop Boys supported the publication of the book with signings in London, New York City, Los Angeles and Berlin. To coincide with the publication of Catalogue, a small exhibition of portraits of Pet Shop Boys opened in the Bookshop Gallery of London's National Portrait Gallery, on 30 October 2006 and ran to 28 February 2007.|$|E
2500|$|On February 6, 2012, Bryant passed O'Neal for fifth {{place on}} the all-time scoring list. Bryant {{said it was an}} honor because of their championships together. O'Neal congratulated Bryant, saying [...] "I'm proud of him. I'm happy for him. And, most of all, I want to thank him for being a part of the {{greatest}} 1-2 punch ever created, never to be duplicated." [...] Bryant stated on radio the following day that he and O'Neal <b>were</b> <b>never</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> last as teammates. Bryant recalled: [...] "There was an interview that I heard Shaq do which he kind of threw down the challenge of me not being able to win without him. After I read that, I said, 'Aw, that's it.' Some comparison that he made with me and Penny Hardaway, and once I read that, I said, 'You know what? I can't finish my career with people saying that. There's no way.'" [...] In 2013, Bryant said that the two [...] "have a really, really good relationship now", calling it [...] "a good lesson for all of us." [...] He said the two had [...] "mutual respect" [...] for each other, while O'Neal commented that they had an [...] "athletic dislike" [...] for each other but [...] "never had a real dislike". That year, the Lakers retired O'Neal's No. 34 during a halftime ceremony. [...] Bryant did not attend the ceremony, but called O'Neal [...] "the most gifted physical specimen I've ever seen play this game" [...] in a recorded video during the event. [...] Questioned about his absence, Bryant told the media, [...] "I appreciate you guys trying to start some stuff for old times' sake." [...] Later, it came out that Bryant had missed the ceremony because he had been receiving treatment from the Lakers' training staff.|$|E
