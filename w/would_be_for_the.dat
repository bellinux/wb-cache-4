In May 2005, the municipal council approved {{the plans for}} a new stadium for Start.

5|$|In May 1934, {{following}} {{reports of}} a Japanese spy operating out of Dutch Harbor, the United States Navy dispatched Edwin T. Layton to the Aleutians to investigate the allegations. The result {{of this investigation was}} the arrest of the only Japanese man in the region, as well as the town's only prostitute, a woman accused of conspiring with the Japanese man. During the 1930s, a number of United States governmental committees, boards and reports concluded that air bases in the Aleutians <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> most part impractical due to the region's inclement weather.|$|E
5|$|The Norwegian National Rail Administration has {{proposed}} a number of upgrades to the Bergen Line that would allow total travel time between the termini to reduce to {{four and a half}} hours. The Ringerike Line is seen as the hallmark of this attempt, that was first launched by the director of NSB in 1954; sixty years later travel time remains at six and a half hours. The project is estimated to cost NOK 7 billion, of which NOK 4 billion <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> line.|$|E

5|$|Despite this, Richards {{continued}} to be champion into 2014. Richards was defeated by Luke Hawx in what was billed as a title match at an East Coast Wrestling Association (ECWA) show in Delaware. However, Extreme Rising said the match was not for the title and {{continued to}} recognize Richards as champion. Despite the statement, Hawx continued to proclaim himself champion and was to defend the title against Matt Hardy on July 20, 2014, at Maryland Championship Wrestling (MCW). Extreme Rising owner Steve O'Neill issued a press release denying that they had sanctioned the match. According to Dan McDevitt of MCW, the match <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> MCW Heavyweight Championship, but said {{it was up to}} Hardy or Hawx to bring other titles. Hawx lost to Hardy in the match, who retained the MCW Championship and obtained the Extreme Rising championship belt â€“ but was not officially recognized as champion.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Grace and Jack are {{discussing}} their own problems. Grace uses Jack's promiscuous history with married men {{as a legitimate}} reason to have {{an affair with a}} married man, but Jack tells her to forget about it as both of them are the moral role models to their friends. After being honest with her, Jack confesses that the reason he is wearing an eye patch is not because he got glitter in his eye, as he told his friends. When he refused to stop his singing performance during the debut of his new talk show, Jack Talk, even though the entire set had accidentally been set on fire, his eyebrow was burnt off. Later, Will, Grace, and Jack all decide that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> best to let Karen know the truth about Stan. Will breaks the news to her, but Karen believes he is joking. Rosario tells Karen that Stan is not dead, as she has been giving him reports on Karen. At the admission, Karen fires Rosario and leaves Will's apartment with Malcolm, explaining that Stan may be alive, but that he is still dead to her.|$|E
5|$|On 27 April Model {{met with}} Hitler {{to review and}} express his concern for {{reconnaissance}} information which showed the Red Army constructing very strong positions at {{the shoulders of the}} salient and having withdrawn their mobile forces from the area west of Kursk. He argued that the longer the preparation phase continued, the less the operation could be justified. He recommended completely abandoning Citadel, allowing the army to await and defeat the coming Soviet offensive, or radically revising the plan for Citadel. Though in mid-April Manstein had considered the Citadel offensive profitable, by May he shared Model's misgivings. He asserted that the best course of action <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> German forces to take the strategic defensive, ceding ground to allow the anticipated Soviet forces to extend themselves and allow the German panzer forces to counterattack in the type of fluid mobile battle at which they excelled. Convinced that the Red Army would deliver its main effort against Army Group South, he proposed to keep the left wing of the army group strong while moving the right wing back in stages to the Dnieper River, followed by a counterattack against the flank of the Red Army advance. The counteroffensive would continue until the Sea of Azov was reached and the Soviet forces were cut off. Hitler rejected this idea; {{he did not want to}} give up so much terrain, even temporarily.|$|E

5|$|Peter {{realizes that}} September's message was literal, {{and returns to}} his home, where he is knocked out by Jones' men. He is brought to the same {{facility}} as Olivia and tied up. As they prepare to torture him, Olivia begins to use her powers to activate the lights, {{not only on the}} box but within the facility, creating electrical sparks that kill one of Jones' men. As Jones and Nina retreat, Olivia frees Peter and they give chase, though Olivia suffers from a seizure, following excessive use of her powers. They catch up to Jones and Nina as they are crossing back to the parallel universe, but the two are able to escape. Peter contacts the authorities to bring medical help for Olivia. As they are waiting, Peter admits to Olivia that he fears what he has done to her memories, and has seen his original Olivia through the Observer's mind. He leaves her, believing that staying away from this Olivia <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> best.|$|E
5|$|The main feud {{heading into}} Vengeance was between Batista and Triple H, {{with the two}} battling over the World Heavyweight Championship. After Batista {{defeated}} Triple H at WrestleMania 21, they continued to fight over the World title at the next Raw pay-per-view, Backlash, which saw Batista retain the title. Following Backlash, a series of Gold Rush Tournament matches to determine a number one contender to face Batista for the World title took place with Kane, Shawn Michaels, Edge, and Chris Benoit winning {{in the first round}} of the tournament. In this round, Benoit forced Triple H to submit to the Sharpshooter, Benoit's submission finisher. On the May 23, 2005 episode of Raw, Batista faced Edge, who had beat out Michaels and Kane for an opportunity at the World title. Batista retained the title after he pinned Edge following a Batista Bomb. Following the match, Triple H attacked Batista with a sledgehammer and challenged him to a Hell in a Cell match. After making the challenge, Triple H performed a Pedigree to Batista on the World title. Batista accepted Triple H's challenge, which led to a contract signing for their scheduled match at Vengeance, which <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> World Heavyweight title in a Hell in a Cell match at Vengeance.|$|E
25|$|In April 1957, Macmillan reaffirmed {{his strong}} support for the British nuclear weapons programme. A {{succession}} of prime ministers since the Second World War had been determined to persuade the United States to revive wartime co-operation in the area of nuclear weapons research. Macmillan believed that one way to encourage such co-operation <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> United Kingdom to speed up the development of its own hydrogen bomb, which was successfully tested on 8 November 1957.|$|E

25|$|Forwards do {{not have}} a standard. They may transact only on the {{settlement}} date. More typical <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> parties to agree to true up, for example, every quarter. The fact that forwards are not margined daily means that, due to movements in the price of the underlying asset, a large differential can build up between the forward's delivery price and the settlement price, and in any event, an unrealized gain (loss) can build up.|$|E
25|$|In August 2014, the Cato Institute {{suggested}} that Congressional staffers should spend spare time editing Wikipedia. A panel {{hosted by the}} institute endorsed the idea so that congressional staffers could use their time to write neutral and informative articles about proposed legislation to better educate the public. Experts on the panel considered the two main obstacles to doing this as being skepticism towards Wikipedia {{and the history of}} biased editing from Congressional staffers. The Cato Institute suggested one way to overcome these issues <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> staffers to create user accounts and user profile pages disclosing their connections with Congress.|$|E
25|$|The {{planning}} of the Morton memorial began in early 1906. On February 9, 1906, the Commission met and designs were presented by Franklin Simmons from Rome, Italy; Hugh A. Price from Chicago, Ill.; and Rudolph Schwarz from Indianapolis, Indiana, for bronze figures 12 {{feet high and}} the tablets for $9000. The designs for the pedestals were planned upon contract with John R. Lowe and if accepted, architect fees <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> same. Plans by Lowe were accepted and after legal notice was given in the newspapers, bids for the pedestals were received on April 10, 1906. The Commission accepted bid of Chas. G.

25|$|Another {{characteristic}} {{dimension is}} the airfoil chord. In these tests the jet width {{was sufficient to}} keep the vortex shedding coherent across it. On an airfoil {{there would be a}} correlation length less than the wingspan resulting in a number independent dipoles arrayed laterally. The sound power would be diminished somewhat. Since the dipole model is based on the time rate of change of the force, reduction of sound power might be accomplished by reducing that rate. One possible means <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> opposite sides of the surface to gradually sense each other spatially prior to the trailing edge and thus reduce the rate at the edge. This might be done by a section of graduated porous or flexible materials.|$|E
25|$|Nonetheless, it {{was only}} in 1971 that the Portuguese {{government}} gave priority to the procurement of new fighters and approved a new rearmament plan for the purchase of 64 fighters, 28 of which <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> defense of mainland Portugal and 36 to be deployed overseas. This plan called for an initial order of 30 aircraft (27 single-seat and three twin-seat). At the time Portugal was under a United Nations arms embargo and the United States was against the Portuguese colonial war and Portugal's presence in Africa, having even previously put limitations on the use of Portuguese F-86F Sabre fighters in Africa. Meanwhile, France saw a Portuguese presence in Africa as coinciding with its own interests and had become, between 1964 and 1971, in the largest supplier of weapons to Portugal. As such, the Dassault Mirage was seen as the best option.|$|E
25|$|In February 1955, a new constitution, the Rendel Constitution was implemented.

Moreover, the post of the Chief Minister was added, which would be assumed by {{the leader of the}} majority party in the Assembly, sharing the responsibility with the Governor.

25|$|Lincoln {{appointed}} Edgerton on June 22, 1864, and Edgerton {{found out}} on his arrival at Bannack. Bannack was created the capital of Montana Territory, and the Edgertons were able to keep their same home. Edgerton was not supported by many settlers and miners in the Territory, as the majority were from border states and either supported the Confederacy or were Democrats who abhorred radical Republicans like him. There were even death threats for those who flew an American Flag. Edgerton put together a quick census, so that an election could be held. The elections <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> State Council, State House, and for the Delegate of the Territory of Montana to the House of Representatives. After the elections of 1865, Democrats took power in the House, and took the Delegate seat in the House of Representatives. While the Republicans took the Council. Numerous engagements between the Governor and Democrats occurred, causing troubles for the Montana Legislature. In all, though, the legislature worked with Edgerton to pass numerous bills on roads, public education, irrigation, and mining.|$|E
25|$|Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, â€“ This was {{recognized}} as a critical case even before it reached the Supreme Court. Chief Justice Earl Warren, realizing how controversial the case <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> public, very much wanted to avoid any dissents in the case. But Reed was the lone hold-out. Other members of the Supreme Court worried about Reed's commitment to civil rights, as {{he was a member}} of the (then) all-white Burning Tree Club in Washington, D.C., and his Kentucky home had an all-white restrictive covenant (a covenant which had led Reed to recuse himself from a civil rights case in 1948). Yet, Reed had written the majority decision in Smith v. Allwright and joined the majority in Sweatt v. Painter, , which barred separate but equal racial segregation in law schools. Reed originally planned to write a dissent in Brown, but joined the majority before a decision was issued. Many observers, including Chief Justice Warren, believed a unanimous decision in Brown was necessary to win public acceptance for the decision. Reed was the last holdout and reportedly cried during the reading of the opinion.|$|E
25|$|The Australian {{team that}} contested {{and won the}} 1995 Rugby League World Cup {{consisted}} only of players from clubs that remained loyal to the Australian Rugby League during the Super League war. This meant several players from Super League-aligned clubs that were already well-established internationals were not selected for the World Cup squad. During 1995, the Kangaroos defeated New Zealand 3â€“0 in the Trans-Tasman Test series played in Australia. As they <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> World Cup, only ARL loyal players were selected for Australia which saw a number of players, including Steve Menzies, Mark Coyne, Terry Hill, Gary Larson, Trevor Gillmeister and Jason Smith make their test debuts during the New Zealand series. Despite having what many described as a second string side without players such as Laurie Daley, Allan Langer, Andrew Ettingshausen, Brett Mullins, Glenn Lazarus, Bradley Clyde, Ian Roberts, Ricky Stuart and Steve Walters, Bob Fulton's Kangaroos won their 8th World Cup (and 5th in a row) when they defeated England 16â€“8 in the World Cup Final in front of 66,540 fans at Wembley.
