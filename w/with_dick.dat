5|$|Gugelmin signed <b>with</b> <b>Dick</b> Simon Racing to {{take part}} in the North American Champ Car racing series for the last three races of 1993. Although races at Mid Ohio and Nazareth {{resulted}} in non-finishes, Gugelmin finished 13th at Laguna Seca although this was not high enough to receive any points. Despite this, Gugelmin demonstrated promise. In 1994, Gugelmin signed with Chip Ganassi Racing to partner Michael Andretti who returned to the series after a season in Formula One. Andretti was more successful than Gugelmin, and took two wins, including Reynard's first win in Champ Car at Surfers Paradise. Gugelmin was hindered by a lack of cooperation between his and Andretti's crews, and his first full-time year in the Champ Car World Series resulted in seven points finishes and 16th in the points standings.|$|E

5|$|In August 2012, ABC {{confirmed}} via a {{press release}} that New Year's Rockin' Eve would return for its 2012–13 edition. Ryan Seacrest, Jenny McCarthy and Fergie reprised their roles as host, Times Square reporter and Hollywood host, respectively. Carly Rae Jepsen, Neon Trees, Psy with MC Hammer, and Taylor Swift performed live in Times Square, while the Hollywood segments of the show included performances by Brandy, Flo Rida, Ellie Goulding, Jason Aldean, Justin Bieber, Karmin, OneRepublic, Pitbull and The Wanted. The primetime hour {{of the program was}} preceded by a two-hour tribute special, New Year's Rockin' Eve Celebrates Dick Clark. Clark's legacy was also recognized by the Times Square Alliance, organizers of the ball drop: a triangular Waterford Crystal panel engraved <b>with</b> <b>Dick</b> Clark's name was presented to his widow Kari Wigton, and installed on the ball.|$|E
5|$|On February 7, 2014, ABC {{reached a}} {{long-term}} deal <b>with</b> <b>Dick</b> Clark Productions, seeing both New Year's Rockin Eve and the DCP-produced American Music Awards {{remain on the}} network {{through the end of}} 2023. Taylor Swift and Florida Georgia Line headlined from Times Square for the 2014-15 edition of New Year's Rockin Eve; they were among 38 acts featured in total during the special. Fergie hosted the re-christened Billboard Hollywood Party segments of the special, and also performed. The special featured studio appearances by Bastille, Charli XCX, Idina Menzel, Iggy Azalea, Magic!, Meghan Trainor, One Direction, Pentatonix, Ella Henderson, and Rixton. The special featured live performances by Gavin DeGraw and Lady Antebellum from Nashville's Bash on Broadway, and a performance by Elton John from his New Year's concert at Barclays Center.|$|E
5|$|One {{commonly}} held misconception connected to Dyer {{is that he}} holds the second longest unbeaten record of fights of any boxer in world history, after fellow Welsh fighter Jimmy Wilde. This information was published in Nat Fleischer's The Ring: Record Book And Boxing Encyclopedia, in which it states Dyer fought 94 unbeaten fights between 1908 and 1912. Although {{it could be argued}} that Dyer may have boxed 94 fights between these years, and may have turned professional in 1908, it is widely accepted that his fight <b>with</b> <b>Dick</b> Emden in 1911 in which he dislocated his knee was a loss. This therefore challenges Fleischer's claim.|$|E

5|$|The Beatles {{entered into}} a {{publishing}} agreement <b>with</b> <b>Dick</b> James Music (DJM), so James set up a company called Northern Songs. James and his financial partner and accountant, Charles Silver, would each receive 25 per cent of the shares. Lennon and McCartney received 20 per cent each, with Epstein receiving the remaining 10 per cent. The Beatles' PRS income increased rapidly, so Epstein asked Isherwood to devise a way of avoiding the tax that Lennon and McCartney would owe. Isherwood suggested a stock market flotation for Northern Songs. He also suggested to Epstein that during the flotation Lennon and McCartney should move to houses near Isherwood's own in Esher. Lennon, Harrison and Starr agreed, while Epstein and McCartney remained in London.|$|E
5|$|The {{complications}} {{of a stroke}} suffered by Clark in December 2004 had a major effect on {{his role in the}} special. After having Regis Philbin serve as a guest host for 2005, Clark returned to the special for the 2006 edition: due to speech impediments resulting from his stroke, Clark ceded hosting duties to Ryan Seacrest, but still made limited appearances. The death of Dick Clark on April 18, 2012 left Ryan Seacrest as the sole host of New Year's Rockin' Eve beginning with its 2012–13 edition. Seacrest has most recently been joined by Jenny McCarthy as a correspondent from Times Square, with Fergie of The Black Eyed Peas serving as the presenter of the Hollywood concert segments. Through its deal <b>with</b> <b>Dick</b> Clark Productions, New Year's Rockin' Eve will remain on ABC through at least 2024.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} Who Framed Roger Rabbit rekindled an {{interest}} in the Golden Age of American animation, and sparked the modern animation scene. In 1991, Walt Disney Imagineering began to develop Mickey's Toontown for Disneyland, based on the Toontown that appeared in the film. The attraction also features a ride called Roger Rabbit's Car Toon Spin. Three theatrical animated shorts were also produced; Tummy Trouble played in front of Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, Roller Coaster Rabbit was shown <b>with</b> <b>Dick</b> Tracy and Trail Mix-Up was included with A Far Off Place. The film also inspired a short-lived comic book and video game spin-offs, including two PC games, the Japanese version of The Bugs Bunny Crazy Castle (which features Roger instead of Bugs), a 1989 game released on the Nintendo Entertainment System, and a 1991 game released on the Game Boy.|$|E

Keith meets Liam Fitzpatrick (Rod Rowland), who states that the robberies will not stop. Apollo learns that Veronica was not assigned by the school paper, and Veronica tells him the truth, but he refuses a paternity test. Some people begin to grow dissatisfied with Keith’s handling of the robberies, while Apollo’s father claimant appears in Neptune. Veronica searches for Apollo, learning from his former roommate that Apollo did not actually write the book, and he was never a child soldier.

Veronica and Wallace spend the night investigating students, and Veronica eventually deduces that Wallace ingested {{a small amount of}} an illegal substance, most likely in a gift basket earlier that year. In a flashback, Veronica and Logan make out in the car until the PCH bikers shoot out the car's windows. Veronica asks Keith for help in finding out the names of a company's shareholders. Veronica believes that one of the lab assistants was paid off to forge the results. The previous summer, Logan was involved with an arson crime.

5|$|Mitchell {{resigned}} as manager in February 1950 {{and was replaced}} in April <b>with</b> <b>Dick</b> Duckworth, a former York player. York were forced to apply for re-election to retain {{their place in the}} Football League for the first time, after finishing bottom of the Third Division North in 1949–50. They did not have to enter the ballot because the Football League was to be extended to 92 clubs for 1950–51. Despite York's senior team's troubles, the reserve team scored over 100 goals to finish sixth in the Midland League, and won the North Riding Senior Cup for the first time after beating Middlesbrough 3–0 at Ayresome Park in the final. York's fortunes improved in 1950–51; they ranked 17th in the league and reached the FA Cup third round {{for the first time since}} 1946, when they were beaten 2–0 by First Division team Bolton Wanderers at Burnden Park. York's best post-war season to date came in 1951–52, as they finished in 10th place and set a home record of 16 wins, four draws and three defeats. York chased promotion in 1952–53, and by late January 1953 they were third in the table. They finished in fourth place with 53 points; both new club records in the Football League. During this season, Duckworth was reluctantly released from his contract in October 1952 to take charge at Stockport County. His successor, the former Grimsby Town manager Charlie Spencer, died in February 1953. Sheffield United's assistant manager Jimmy McCormick was appointed in June 1953, and by late December York were bottom of the table. A win in the last match of 1953–54 meant they finished in 22nd place, and avoided having to apply for re-election. Sessions {{resigned as}} chairman in November 1953 and was succeeded by Hugh Kitchin.|$|E
