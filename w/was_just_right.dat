500|$|Determined {{not to use}} any big Hollywood names, King {{looked at}} many European actors before {{settling}} on British actor Rupert Friend. They were aware of him from the 2005 film Pride & Prejudice. Vallée noted, [...] "I had an image of Albert in my mind, before we cast Rupert, and how the actor might play him and when Rupert came on board he <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>right.</b> He {{had a very good}} understanding of the character and he did a lot of research to get him right, with the accent and his deportment. He really looks the part, he looks so romantic!" [...] Co-producer Dennis O'Sullivan called Friend [...] "our Scarlett O'Hara search". They believed the actor had the most chemistry with Blunt after selecting several to play chess with her. Friend's height (6ft 1in) also played a factor in their choice. Friend believed [...] "Albert was a true unsung hero. A great reformer, a doting husband and father, a hard worker and man of real integrity and modesty." [...] The actor also thought their relationship was not [...] "a gooey love story"; rather, their arguments showed it [...] "wasn't an easy road by any means". Friend strove to immerse himself in the role, and learned the prince's particular characteristics, such as the way he rode a horse, walked, and played the piano. He worked with a voice coach and German instructor to perfect his accent, with the intention of [...] "put in as much German as possible, because Victoria and Albert did speak German to each other." ...|$|E

There were a few problems with this work (it was rather over-long in its original form) {{and so it was}} thought that for a week or two, Leopoldo Fregoli could perform (he needed {{little in the way of}} permanent sets, etc.) until Sir Arthur was satisfied his work <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>right.</b> Such was Fregoli's success that it was to be late in May of that year before the Sullivan piece was finally performed.|$|E
2500|$|Cashman {{decided to}} quit the show {{in the early part}} of 1989. While still on the cast of EastEnders, Cashman had founded the {{influential}} gay campaign group Stonewall and has now given up acting to become a Labour MEP. He was elected to the European Parliament in 1999 where he is the Labour spokesperson on human rights. He is also an active campaigner across a wide range of issues. On screen, Colin finally learned he had multiple sclerosis and decided to leave Walford to live with his brother and face a rapid decline in health. In an interview featured in EastEnders Handbook by Hilary Kingsly, Michael Cashman looked back fondly on Albert Square and his character, commenting: [...] "Quite a few gay activists thought Colin too nice, but I thought he <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>right.</b> There was a fuss about his kiss with Barry which was sad — people should be upset by demonstrations of hate, not love".|$|E

60|$|He had rather regular features; a good mouth; light eyes under {{somewhat}} heavy, dark eyebrows; a smooth, square forehead; {{no growth}} on his cheeks; a small, brown moustache, and a well-shaped, round chin.

Gerald and the Russian were both correct and COMME IL FAUT in appearance and manner, Birkin was gaunt and sick, and looked a failure {{in his attempt to}} be a properly dressed man, like Gerald and Maxim.

Now it <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>right,</b> as he had found out the day before by a visit to the place where this particular grass grew.

60|$|We reached {{our hotel}} about noon, pretty tired, for {{we had been}} rushing things, as it was {{necessary}} for father to go home early the next day. On the front steps we found Uncle Chipperton, who had been waiting for us. He particularly wanted to see me. He lunched with us, and then he took me off to the place where he was to have his dinner, at six o'clock that evening. He wanted to consult with me about the arrangements of the table; where each person should sit, and all that sort of thing. I couldn't see the use in this, because it was only a kind of family party, and we should all be sure to get seated, if there were chairs and places enough. But Uncle Chipperton wanted to plan and arrange everything until he was sure it <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>right.</b> That was his way.|$|E
60|$|In the {{afternoon}} R.C. and I went out again {{to try for}} trout. The lake appeared to be getting thicker with that floating muck and we could not raise a fish. Then we tried the outlet again. Here the current was swift. I found a place between two willow banks where trout were breaking on the surface. It took a long cast for me, but about every tenth attempt I would get a fly over the right place and raise a fish. They were small, {{but that did not}} detract from my gratification. The light on the water <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>right</b> for me to see the trout rise, and that was a beautiful sight as well as a distinct advantage. I had caught four when a shout from R.C. called me quickly down stream. I found him {{standing in the middle of}} a swift chute with his rod bent double and a long line out.|$|E

But, no, he let go. Again I threw off the drag and again he came back. He was hungry, but he was cunning, too, and too far back for me to see. I let him run fifty feet, threw on the drag, and struck hard. No go! I missed him. But again I threw off the drag, let out more line back to him, {{and he took the}} bait the fourth time, and harder than ever. I let him run perhaps a hundred feet. All the time, of course, my boat was running. I had out a long line--two hundred yards. Then I threw on the drag and almost cracked the rod. This time I actually felt the hook go in.|$|E

60|$|But {{in the one}} we {{saw last}} night a hard-wood fire was burning merrily, beneath the superincumbent marble,--the kiln being heaped full; and shortly after we came, the man (a dark, black-bearded figure, in shirt-sleeves) opened the iron door, through the chinks of which the fire was gleaming, and thrust in huge logs of wood, and stirred the immense coals with a long pole, and showed us the glowing limestone,--the lower layer of it. The heat of the fire was powerful, at the {{distance}} of several yards from the open door. He talked very sensibly with us, being doubtless glad to have two visitors to vary his solitary night-watch; for it would not do for him to fall asleep, since the fire should be refreshed as often as every twenty minutes. We ascended the hillock {{to the top of}} the kiln, and the marble was red-hot, and burning with a bluish, lambent flame, quivering up, sometimes nearly a yard high, and resembling the flame of anthracite coal, only, the marble being in large fragments, the flame was higher. The kiln was perhaps six or eight feet across. Four hundred bushels of marble were then in a state of combustion. The expense of converting this quantity into lime is about fifty dollars, and it sells for twenty-five cents per bushel at the kiln. We asked the man whether he would run across the top of the intensely burning kiln, barefooted, for a thousand dollars; and he said he would for ten. He told us that the lime had been burning forty-eight hours, and would be finished in thirty-six more. He liked the business of watching it better by night than by day; because the days were often hot, but such a mild and beautiful night as the last <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>right.</b> Here a poet might make verses with moonlight in them, and a gleam of fierce firelight flickering through. It is a shame to use this brilliant, white, almost transparent marble in this way. A man said of it, the other day, that into some pieces of it, when polished, one could see a good distance; and he instanced a certain gravestone.|$|E
60|$|That was Adam's {{state of}} mind in this second autumn of his sorrow. His work, as you know, had {{always been part of}} his religion, and from very early days he saw clearly that good {{carpentry}} was God's will--was that form of God's will that most immediately concerned him. But now there was no margin of dreams for him beyond this daylight reality, no holiday-time in the working-day world, no moment in the distance when duty would take off her iron glove and breast-plate and clasp him gently into rest. He conceived no picture of the future but one made up of hard-working days such as he lived through, with growing contentment and intensity of interest, every fresh week. Love, he thought, could never be anything to him but a living memory--a limb lopped off, but not gone from consciousness. He did not know that the power of loving was all the while gaining new force within him; that the new sensibilities bought by a deep experience were so many new fibres by which it was possible, nay, necessary to him, that his nature should intertwine with another. Yet he was aware that common affection and friendship were more precious to him than they used to be--that he clung more to his mother and Seth, and had an unspeakable satisfaction in the sight or imagination of any small addition to their happiness. The Poysers, too--hardly three or four days passed but he felt the need of seeing them and interchanging words and looks of friendliness with them. He would have felt this, probably, even if Dinah had not been with them, but he had only said the simplest truth in telling Dinah that he put her above all other friends in the world. Could anything be more natural? For in the darkest moments of memory the thought of her always came as the first ray of returning comfort. The early days of gloom at the Hall Farm had been gradually turned into soft moonlight by her presence; and in the cottage, too, for she had come at every spare moment to soothe and cheer poor Lisbeth, who had been stricken with a fear that subdued even her querulousness {{at the sight of her}} darling Adam's grief-worn face. He had become used to watching her light quiet movements, her pretty loving ways to the children, when he went to the Hall Farm; to listen for her voice as for a recurrent music; to think everything she said and did <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>right,</b> and could not have been better. In spite of his wisdom, he could not find fault with her for her overindulgence of the children, who had managed to convert Dinah the preacher, before whom a circle of rough men had often trembled a little, into a convenient household slave--though Dinah herself was rather ashamed of this weakness, and had some inward conflict as to her departure from the precepts of Solomon. Yes, there was one thing that might have been better; she might have loved Seth and consented to marry him. He felt a little vexed, for his brother's sake, and he could not help thinking regretfully how Dinah, as Seth's wife, would have made their home as happy as it could be for them all--how she was the one being that would have soothed their mother's last days into peacefulness and rest.|$|E
60|$|Each of {{us could}} do things that would please and get notice {{if it were not}} for this person, who {{occupied}} all the time and gave others no chance. I had made a poem, taking a whole night to ita poem in which I most happily and delicately celebrated that sweet girl's charms, without mentioning her name, but any one could see who was meant; for the bare title"The Rose of Orleans"would reveal that, as it seemed to me. It pictured this pure and dainty white rose as growing up out of the rude soil of war and looking abroad out of its tender eyes upon the horrid machinery of death, and thennote this conceitit blushes for the sinful nature of man, and turns red in a single night. Becomes a red rose, you seea rose that was white before. The idea was my own, and quite new. Then it sent its sweet perfume out over the embattled city, and when the beleaguering forces smelt it they laid down their arms and wept. This was also my own idea, and new. That closed that part of the poem; then I put her into the similitude of the firmamentnot the whole of it, but only part. That is to say, she was the moon, and all the constellations were following her about, their hearts in flames for love of her, but she would not halt, she would not listen, for 'twas thought she loved another. 'Twas thought she loved a poor unworthy suppliant who was upon the earth, facing danger, death, and possible mutilation in the bloody field, waging relentless war against a heartless foe to save her from an all too early grave, and her city from destruction. And when the sad pursuing constellations came to know and realize the bitter sorrow that was come upon themnote this ideatheir hearts broke and their tears gushed forth, filling the vault of heaven with a fiery splendor, for those tears were falling stars. It was a rash idea, but beautiful; beautiful and pathetic; wonderfully pathetic, the way I had it, with the rhyme and all to help. At the end of each verse there was a two-line refrain pitying the poor earthly lover separated so far, and perhaps forever, from her he loved so well, and growing always paler and weaker and thinner in his agony as he neared the cruel gravethe most touching thingeven the boys themselves could hardly keep back their tears, the way Noel said those lines. There were eight four-line stanzas in the first end of the poemthe end about the rose, the horticultural end, as you may say, if that is not too large a name for such a little poemand eight in the astronomical endsixteen stanzas altogether, and I could have made it a hundred and fifty if I had wanted to, I was so inspired and so all swelled up with beautiful thoughts and fancies; but that would have been too many to sing or recite before a company that way, whereas sixteen <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>right,</b> and could be done over again if desired. The boys were amazed that I could make such a poem as that out of my own head, and so was I, of course, it being as much a surprise to me as it could be to anybody, for I did not know that it was in me. If any had asked me a single day before if it was in me, I should have told them frankly no, it was not.|$|E
