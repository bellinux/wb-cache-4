25|$|Both {{steganography}} {{and digital}} <b>watermarking</b> employ steganographic techniques to embed data covertly in noisy signals. While steganography aims for imperceptibility to human senses, digital <b>watermarking</b> tries {{to control the}} robustness as top priority.|$|E
25|$|The {{message is}} conceptually zero-bit {{long and the}} system is {{designed}} in order to detect the presence or {{the absence of the}} watermark in the marked object. This kind of <b>watermarking</b> scheme is usually referred to as zero-bit or presence <b>watermarking</b> schemes. Sometimes, this type of <b>watermarking</b> scheme is called 1-bit watermark, because a 1 denotes the presence (and a 0 the absence) of a watermark.|$|E
30|$|In a copy attack, {{an adversary}} outputs an invalid <b>watermarked</b> image as in a forgery attack. However, the adversary copies a <b>watermark</b> from one valid <b>watermarked</b> image into another to falsely {{authenticate}} an invalid <b>watermarked</b> image. In principle, an adversary initially tries {{to estimate the}} unwatermarked image from its <b>watermarked</b> version and then estimates the original <b>watermark</b> from the estimated unwatermarked image and the original <b>watermarked</b> image. Finally, the estimated <b>watermark</b> is embedded to a new unwatermarked image to get a forged <b>watermarked</b> copy.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a novel {{multiple}} <b>watermarks</b> embedding scheme. We assume M <b>watermarks</b> have already {{embedded in the}} image using M sets of secret key. With the availability of these M sets secret key, another N <b>watermarks</b> can be embedded using the proposed technique while the energies of the <b>watermarks</b> are minimized. And the <b>watermarks</b> embedded later will {{not interfere with the}} first M <b>watermarks.</b> Experimental results show <b>watermarked</b> images have good visual quality and the <b>watermarks</b> are robustness to JPEG compression and noise attacks...|$|R

25|$|The {{evaluation}} of digital <b>watermarking</b> schemes may provide detailed information for a watermark designer or for end-users, therefore, different evaluation strategies exist. Often {{used by a}} watermark designer is the {{evaluation of}} single properties to show, for example, an improvement. Mostly, end-users {{are not interested in}} detailed information. They want to know if a given digital <b>watermarking</b> algorithm may be used for their application scenario, and if so, which parameter sets seems to be the best.|$|E

40|$|A <b>watermark</b> {{generator}} {{for providing}} a <b>watermark</b> signal as {{a sequence of}} subsequent <b>watermark</b> coefficients based on a stream of subsequent stream values representing discrete valued data comprises a differential encoder. The differential encoder is configured to apply a phase rotation to a current stream value of the stream values representing the discrete valued data or to a current <b>watermark</b> symbol, the current <b>watermark</b> symbol corresponding to a current stream value of the stream values representing the discrete valued data, to obtain a current <b>watermark</b> coefficient of the <b>watermark</b> signal. The differential encoder is configured to derive a phase of a previous spectral coefficient of a <b>watermarked</b> signal which {{is a combination of}} the host signal and the <b>watermark</b> signal. The differential encoder is further configured to provide the <b>watermark</b> signal such that a phase angle of the phase rotation applied to the current stream value or the current <b>watermark</b> symbol is dependent on the phase of the previous spectral coefficient of the <b>watermarked</b> signal...|$|R
40|$|A {{zero-knowledge}} <b>watermark</b> detector allows {{an owner}} {{to prove to}} a verifier that an image in question indeed contains the ownerâ€™s <b>watermark</b> without revealing much information about the actual <b>watermark.</b> In such a scenario, the owner publishes a committed <b>watermark</b> before <b>watermark</b> detection so as to show that she knows the <b>watermark</b> before the detection. However, this {{does not imply that}} the owner can prove that she knows the <b>watermark</b> before the work appeared in the public. One well known counter example is the invertibility/ambiguity attacks where an adversary can create an ambiguous situation by deriving a forged <b>watermark</b> from a published work, and commits the forged <b>watermark.</b> Furthermore, the adversary may derive a <b>watermark</b> from existing non-watermarked images in the public domain and later claim ownership of them. One solution is to enforce certain constraints on the valid <b>watermarks.</b> In this paper we propose a zero-knowledge <b>watermark</b> detector that prevents the owner from cheating by ambiguity attacks. In addition, it allows the owner to publish a large number of works with different <b>watermarks,</b> while committing only one secret...|$|R
25|$|Detection (often called extraction) is an {{algorithm}} {{which is}} applied to the attacked signal to attempt to extract the watermark from it. If the signal was unmodified during transmission, then the watermark still is present and it may be extracted. In robust digital <b>watermarking</b> applications, the extraction algorithm should be able to produce the watermark correctly, even if the modifications were strong. In fragile digital <b>watermarking,</b> the extraction algorithm should fail if any change is made to the signal.|$|E
25|$|Digital <b>watermarking</b> for {{relational}} databases {{has emerged}} as a candidate solution to provide copyright protection, tamper detection, traitor tracing, and maintaining integrity of relational data. Many <b>watermarking</b> techniques have been proposed in the literature to address these purposes. A survey of the current state-of-the-art and a classification of the different techniques according to their intent, the way they express the watermark, the cover type, granularity level, and verifiability was published in 2010 by Halder et al. in the Journal of Universal Computer Science.|$|E
25|$|A digital <b>watermarking</b> {{method is}} {{referred}} to as amplitude modulation if the marked signal is embedded by additive modification which is similar to spread spectrum method, but is particularly embedded in the spatial domain.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{the limits on}} optical detection of noisy <b>watermarks</b> that use a chaotic function, the logistic difference equation, in the <b>watermark</b> generation scheme. By varying the function seed, different chaotic sequences exhibiting lowpass and highpass characteristics, can be obtained for the function, offering an added security advantage over <b>watermarks</b> generated using pseudorandom sequences. <b>Watermark</b> Detection {{is the process of}} determining whether an image is <b>watermarked</b> with a certain <b>watermark.</b> In this paper, we model and investigate an optical correlator suitable for <b>watermark</b> detection for certain classes of high-pass or low-pass <b>watermarks.</b> Once in the public domain a <b>watermarked</b> image may be subjected to noise and other attacks, deliberate and unintentional. Additionally, an optical correlator system will also be subject to shot noise. The effects of shot noise on optically transmitted <b>watermarks</b> are modeled in this paper and we examine how the <b>watermark</b> detection scheme performs in such situations. We quantify the degree of noise that may be present in the <b>watermark</b> detection scheme in order to obtain reliable detection or rejection of a <b>watermark</b> using an optical-correlator...|$|R
30|$|In an {{elimination}} attack, {{an adversary}} tries to output {{an image that}} is perceptually similar to the <b>watermarked</b> image, but will never be detected as containing the <b>watermark.</b> Thus, the attacked <b>watermarked</b> image cannot be considered to contain a <b>watermark</b> at all. It {{is important to consider}} that eliminating the <b>watermark</b> does not necessarily mean reconstructing (or inverting) the <b>watermarked</b> image [42]. Rather, the adversary may output a new image that is perceptually similar to the <b>watermarked</b> image.|$|R

25|$|A digital <b>watermarking</b> {{method is}} said to be of {{quantization}} type if the marked signal is obtained by quantization. Quantization watermarks suffer from low robustness, but have a high information capacity due to rejection of host interference.|$|E
25|$|A digital <b>watermarking</b> {{method is}} {{referred}} to as spread-spectrum if the marked signal is obtained by an additive modification. Spread-spectrum watermarks are known to be modestly robust, but also to have a low information capacity due to host interference.|$|E

40|$|DE 102008014331 A 1 UPAB: 20090923 NOVELTY - The {{embedder}} (100) has a watermark- information-recognition unit (120) {{designed to}} recognize watermark-information {{that is already}} contained in an input-information representation (110). A watermark-adder (130) {{is designed to provide}} the input-information representation with a <b>watermark</b> (132) depending on the <b>watermark</b> information recognized by the watermark-information-recognition unit in order to obtain an information representation (134) provided with the <b>watermark</b> that is to be embedded. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following: (1) a detector for detection of two <b>watermarks</b> in an input-information-representation provided with multiple of <b>watermarks</b> (2) a method for embedding the <b>watermark</b> that is to be embedded in an input- information-representation (3) a method for detecting of two <b>watermarks</b> in the input- information-representation provided with <b>watermarks</b> (4) a computer program for implementing the method for embedding and detecting of two <b>watermarks</b> in the input- information-representation provided with <b>watermarks</b> (5) an information signal, which comprises the <b>watermark</b> information. USE - Embedder for embedding a <b>watermark</b> in an input- information-representation. ADVANTAGE - The embedder is designed such that the <b>watermark</b> is embedded in the input- information-representation in an improved manner, and is detected in an easy manner. The embedder avoids or minimizes disturbing influences between the <b>watermark</b> that already exists in the information-representation and/or the <b>watermark,</b> which can be newly embedded again. The <b>watermark</b> already contained in the information-representation, and the <b>watermark</b> that is added again, can use certain information i. e. synchronization information, together. The design of the embedder prevents multiple embedding of the redundant information into the information-representation, thus reducing negative influence of useful-information contents of the information-representation. The water mark already provided in the information representation, dependent on embedding of a <b>watermark</b> to be added new, enables a purposeful selection of resources e. g. frequency resources, time resources or code resources, used for the <b>watermark</b> embedding, thus avoiding or reducing mutual impairment of multiple embedded <b>watermarks,</b> and hence obtaining systematic resources application such that an efficient proceeding can be achieved, during the extraction and/or detection of <b>watermark...</b>|$|R

25|$|Most {{banknotes}} {{are made}} using the mould made {{process in which}} a watermark and thread is incorporated during the paper forming process. The thread is a simple looking security component found in most banknotes. It is however often rather complex in construction comprising fluorescent, magnetic, metallic and micro print elements. By combining it with <b>watermarking</b> technology the thread {{can be made to}} surface periodically on one side only. This is known as windowed thread and further increases the counterfeit resistance of the banknote paper. This process was invented by Portals, part of the De La Rue group in the UK. Other related methods include <b>watermarking</b> {{to reduce the number of}} corner folds by strengthening this part of the note, coatings to reduce the accumulation of dirt on the note, and plastic windows in the paper that make it very hard to copy.|$|E

30|$|The copy attack {{has been}} used to create the false {{positive}} problem and operated as follow: (1) a <b>watermark</b> is first predicted from <b>watermarked</b> image, (2) the predicted <b>watermark</b> into a target image to create counterfeit <b>watermarked</b> image, (3) from the counterfeit image, a <b>watermark</b> can be detected that wrongly claims rightful ownership.|$|R
30|$|When extracting <b>watermark,</b> {{we decide}} whether <b>watermark</b> is {{embedded}} or {{not based on}} the characteristics of bit streams. If the C 6 bit is 0, the <b>watermark</b> is extracted from the lowest position of bits; if the C 6 bit is 1, there is no <b>watermark</b> in bit stream. If reaching the end of the frame but the extracted <b>watermarks</b> are less than 66 bits, then return to a starting point and extract <b>watermark</b> in the C 6 = 1 position until the <b>watermark</b> bits extracted are up to 66 bits.|$|R
25|$|One {{application}} of digital <b>watermarking</b> is source tracking. A watermark is embedded into a digital signal at each point of distribution. If {{a copy of}} the work is found later, then the watermark may be retrieved from the copy and the source of the distribution is known. This technique reportedly has been used to detect the source of illegally copied movies.|$|E

25|$|The {{information}} to be embedded in a signal is called a digital watermark, although in some contexts the phrase digital watermark means {{the difference between the}} watermarked signal and the cover signal. The signal where the watermark is to be embedded is called the host signal. A <b>watermarking</b> system is usually divided into three distinct steps, embedding, attack, and detection. In embedding, an algorithm accepts the host and the data to be embedded, and produces a watermarked signal.|$|E

In our scheme, we constructed a <b>watermark</b> in a figure format {{rather than in a}} text format; thus, even if the image data is attacked much more, the <b>watermark</b> can still be recognized the figured <b>watermark</b> and can parse the user-related and hardware-related information and then can take the evidence by the figured <b>watermark.</b>|$|R
