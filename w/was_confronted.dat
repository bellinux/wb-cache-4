5|$|During the {{confused}} fighting, French and Russian units moved forward into impenetrable smoke and were smashed by artillery and musketry fire that was horrendous even by Napoleonic standards. Infantry and cavalrymen had difficulty maneuvering over the heaps of corpses and masses of wounded. Murat advanced with his cavalry around the flèches to attack Bagration's infantry, but <b>was</b> <b>confronted</b> by Duka's 2ndCuirassier Division supported by Neverovsky's infantry.|$|E

This rivalry lead to a match between the two at Vengeance, in which the real Kane lost to the Imposter.|$|E

Langtry was still compelled to criticise the extremely heavy, lawless, fishing pressure, {{in the form}} of both uncontrolled small-scale commercial fishing and rampant illegal fishing, with which he <b>was</b> <b>confronted</b> in all reaches of the Murray River he investigated in 1949–1950.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of North Walsham was {{a medieval}} battle fought on 25 or 26 June 1381, {{near the town}} of North Walsham in the English county of Norfolk, in which a large group of rebellious local peasants <b>was</b> <b>confronted</b> by the heavily armed forces of Henry le Despenser, Bishop of Norwich. The battle is {{significant}} for being the last occurrence of any major resistance during the English Peasants' Revolt of 1381.|$|E
5|$|As he {{attempted}} to withdraw with the wounded soldier, Bleak <b>was</b> <b>confronted</b> by two more Chinese. Putting down the wounded soldier, Bleak reportedly surprised the Chinese soldiers by charging them and smashing their heads together {{with such force that}} he may have fractured the skulls of {{one or both of the}} assailants before pushing them out of his way. Eventually, all 20 men of the patrol returned to the UN lines, but a third of them were wounded. Bleak was credited with saving the patrol, both by promptly treating the wounded and by aggressively attacking and killing or neutralizing five Chinese soldiers.|$|E

5|$|Fortune's activities—including her {{leadership}} of the new group {{and a series of}} articles that she wrote for The Occult Review—raised concerns for Alpha et Omega leader Moina Mathers. After Fortune suggested that her own organisation could serve as a feeder group to Mathers's Alpha et Omega, Mathers expelled her from the order, claiming that this was necessitated by Fortune having the wrong signs in her aura. Fortune later claimed that she subsequently came under psychic attack from Mathers, during which she <b>was</b> <b>confronted</b> and assaulted by both real and etheric cats.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after giving}} birth to the younger children, Maria Theresa <b>was</b> <b>confronted</b> {{with the task of}} marrying off the elder ones. She led the {{marriage}} negotiations along with the campaigns of her wars and the duties of state. She treated her children with affection but used them as pawns in dynastic games and sacrificed their happiness {{for the benefit of the}} state. A devoted but self-conscious mother, she wrote to all of her children at least once a week and believed herself entitled to exercise authority over her children regardless of their age and rank.|$|E
5|$|Simultaneously {{with their}} {{appearance}} on the Hamch'ang road at the southern base of the Mun'gyong plateau north of Sangju, the North Koreans approached on the secondary mountain road to the west. On July 22, F Company of the 35th Infantry was also attacked north of Hamch'ang, when it <b>was</b> <b>confronted</b> with a North Korean battalion three times its size. The company fought effectively and inflicted heavy casualties, though the next day rains caused flooding of a river to the unit's rear and cut off its route of supply. Assisted by artillery, {{it was able to}} disengage.|$|E

5|$|Soult divided {{his army}} into two contingents and {{advanced}} into Extremadura via {{the two main}} passes leading from Andalusia into the Guadiana valley, {{with the intention of}} rejoining at Almendralejo. One of the columns, commanded by Gen. Marie Victor Latour-Maubourg, met little resistance on its march; on 3 January 1811 the column <b>was</b> <b>confronted</b> by 2,500 Spanish and Portuguese cavalry near Usagre, but that force was only a screen covering the retreat beyond the Guadiana of a Spanish infantry division commanded by Gen. Mendizabal. Latour-Maubourg was therefore able to take position near Almendralejo and await the arrival of the second French column.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Kopidnadon or Kopidnados {{took place}} in September 788 between the armies of the Abbasid Caliphate and the Byzantine Empire. The Abbasid army {{launched}} an invasion of Byzantine Asia Minor, and <b>was</b> <b>confronted</b> by a Byzantine force at Kopidnadon. The resulting battle was an Abbasid victory. Among the Byzantine losses was a certain Diogenes, who is identified by some scholars with the probable original source for the literary hero Digenes Akritas.|$|E
5|$|The {{effect of}} Rupert's actions, {{even after his}} forces disengaged, was to force another delay in the Parliamentarian retreat; Essex spent much of 19 September looking after wounded {{soldiers}} and, when he finally managed to begin moving again, he <b>was</b> <b>confronted</b> with swampland and bog which further delayed him while the Royalists marched across the relatively open chalk downs above the Kennet. These hardships meant that the Royalists arrived at Newbury before Essex, with both armies settling down for the night outside the town, too exhausted to immediately fight.|$|E

5|$|Two further {{attacks were}} made on Belgrade by the Germans {{on the first day}} of the invasion. The third wave struck at 14:00, {{consisting}} of 94 twin-engined bombers flying from airfields near Vienna, escorted by 60 fighters. This attack <b>was</b> <b>confronted</b> by eighteen fighters of the 6th Fighter Regiment, who claimed four German aircraft shot down. The fourth attack of the day approached Belgrade at 16:00, comprising 97 dive bombers and 60 fighters.|$|E
5|$|With Harun al-Rashid's {{accession}} in 786, {{the raids}} launched {{over the next}} two years were relatively minor affairs; the first great invasion of the new reign occurred in 788, when a large expeditionary force crossed the Cilician Gates into the Anatolic Theme. Although the raid is not mentioned in Arabic sources, its description by the Byzantine chronicler Theophanes the Confessor points to a major invasion, as it <b>was</b> <b>confronted</b> by the forces of the two most powerful Byzantine thematic armies, those of the Anatolic Theme itself and of the Opsician Theme.|$|E
5|$|A {{motif of}} father-against-son {{conflict}} was repeated when Cronus <b>was</b> <b>confronted</b> by his son, Zeus. Because Cronus had betrayed his father, {{he feared that}} his offspring would do the same, and so each time Rhea gave birth, he snatched up the child and ate it. Rhea hated this and tricked him by hiding Zeus and wrapping a stone in a baby's blanket, which Cronus ate. When Zeus was full grown, he fed Cronus a drugged drink which caused him to vomit, throwing up Rhea's other children and the stone, which {{had been sitting in}} Cronus's stomach all along. Zeus then challenged Cronus to war for the kingship of the gods. At last, {{with the help of the}} Cyclopes (whom Zeus freed from Tartarus), Zeus and his siblings were victorious, while Cronus and the Titans were hurled down to imprisonment in Tartarus.|$|E
