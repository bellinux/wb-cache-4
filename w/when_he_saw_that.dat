5|$|A two-part, feature-length {{version of}} Hogfather {{starring}} David Jason {{and the voice}} of Ian Richardson was first aired on Sky One in the United Kingdom in December 2006, and on ION Television in the US in 2007. Pratchett was opposed to live action films about Discworld before because of his negative experience with Hollywood film makers. He changed his opinion <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> the director Vadim Jean and producer Rod Brown were very enthusiastic and cooperative.|$|E
5|$|On 26 October 2010, a {{military}} court convicted {{air traffic controller}} Sgt. Jomarcelo Fernandes dos Santos, sentencing him to 14 months in jail for failing to take action <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> the Embraer's anti-collision system had been turned off. Santos will remain free pending {{the outcome of the}} appeal process. Four other controllers were acquitted for lack of proof. On 17 May 2011, Judge Mendes sentenced air traffic controller Lucivando Tiburcio de Alencar to a term of up to three years and four months but ruled he is eligible to do community service in Brazil instead and acquitted Santos on charges of harming Brazil's air transport safety.|$|E
5|$|Li Shimin's {{plan was}} successful: apart from skirmishes {{between the two}} armies' cavalry, the two armies {{maintained}} their standoff from about 08:00 until noon, when the Xia troops began {{to show signs of}} thirst and weariness. Li Shimin, from a high vantage point, saw this and sent 300 cavalry in a probing attack. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> the demoralized Xia recoiled from this assault, he sent more of his cavalry to turn Dou's left flank from the south. Dou reacted by ordering the withdrawal of his entire army from the river to the better defensive position offered by the eastern escarpment of the Sishui valley, but this manoeuvre created confusion in the Xia lines, breaking their battle order. Awaiting this opportunity, Li Shimin ordered his army to launch a general attack against the withdrawing Xia, himself spearheading the attack at the head of his remaining cavalry. Li Shimin always led from the front—accompanied by an elite force of 1000 black-clad, black-armoured horsemen—as indeed did most of the contemporary Chinese military leaders, who were expected to prove their personal bravery on the battlefield and motivate their men by their example, rather than stay in the rear and co-ordinate their army.|$|E

5|$|Next, a small {{metallic}} dingy, {{known as}} an iron yawl, was carried down to the beach. Tom Fagen and Freed Waterhouse manned the yawl, in another attempt to reach the grounded schooner. Through skilled seamanship, they {{made it to the}} second set of breakers, only a short distance from the vessel. When they tried to reach the float line, a large wave struck them leaving their boat filled with water. The two men abandoned their yawl. Fagen managed to swim ashore and was met by volunteers close to the beach half-drowned. Waterhouse decided against swimming to shore. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> the yawl had flipped, he swam back to it and straddled the hull. The men on the shore began pulling the flipped boat in, but another wave broke on top of it throwing Waterhouse into the water and righting the yawl. Waterhouse climbed back into the boat and began getting pulled in again, only to be capsized shortly thereafter. This time Waterhouse surfaced, appearing dazed and grasping onto an oar. Shaw's rescue boat was put back in the water, but Waterhouse had already gone under and presumably drowned to death a short time later. F Waterhouse's body was never recovered, despite several searches.|$|E

25|$|In 1850, the Venezuelan General Narciso López, {{along with}} some Americans and Cuban exiles, landed here on a {{filibustering}} expedition, and held the town for a few hours, abandoning it <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> the people would not rise to support him {{in his efforts to}} secure Cuban independence.

25|$|When her {{mother-in-law}} died, Frances became {{mistress of the}} household. During a time of flood and famine, she turned part of the family's country estate into a hospital and distributed food and clothing to the poor.

5000|$|He {{had been}} conscripted into the Red Army in August, 1944 {{and was sent}} to the front, where he participated in two battles.

25|$|The {{defect in}} the Prussian {{position}} this respect was subsequently made strikingly manifest {{by the fact that}} the gradual weakening of the Prussian centre for the purpose of reinforcing the right, was closely observed by Napoleon, who took advantage of the insight thus obtained into his opponent's designs, by collecting in rear of the heights of Ligny that force with which, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> the Prussians had no reserve remaining, he so suddenly assailed and broke the centre of their line.|$|E
25|$|The battle {{began with}} {{artillery}} fire and cavalry clashes. About 7 a.m., Markow wanted {{to begin to}} attack but changed his orders <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> Polish formations under Poniatowski had moved onto the battle field. Poniatowski forces included two infantry battalions, a cavalry regiment of front guard from Prince Józef Lubomirski, Brigade National Cavalry under command of Stanisław Mokronowski, a division under command of General Wielhorski, and 12 cannons. Kościuszko with his division {{had to stay in}} the rear in order to prevent an attack from Levanidov and Dunin corps. Poniatowski sent the Mokronowski brigade on right wing. He backed the artillery. The battalion of infantry regiment of Potocki was in reserve. The division of Wielhorski took position within the forest as second throw.|$|E
25|$|Born at Bucaramanga in Santander Department, Arenas {{spent most}} of his life {{involving}} himself in the activities of Marxist revolution in Colombia since the 1960s. During this time, he mostly lived in the mountains, jungles and remote villages. Arenas sometimes had to hide from those who wanted to capture him, including Colombian security forces, the Central Intelligence Agency (which Arenas believed responsible for numerous alleged plots against him) and eventually paramilitary fighters as well. Arenas is thought to have followed the example of Che Guevara, who changed his way of life <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> the people of Latin America were facing hardships during a regionwide motorcycle trip (partially included in the film Diarios de Motocicleta - The Motorcycle Diaries) when he was a senior year medical student. Arenas admired Che Guevara and started his life as a revolutionary due to similar realizations, first through his experiences in the Colombian Communist Party (PCC) and finally in the FARC.|$|E

25|$|On June 3, 1863, Lee's army {{began to}} slip away northwesterly from Fredericksburg, Virginia, leaving A.P. Hill's Corps in fortifications above Fredericksburg to protect the Confederate rear as it withdrew. By June 5, Longstreet's and Ewell's corps were camped in and around Culpeper, and Hooker had caught wind of the Confederate movement. Accordingly, he ordered Sedgwick to conduct a {{reconnaissance}} in force across the Rappahannock River to Hill's line, {{which resulted in a}} skirmish that convinced him Lee still occupied his old line around Fredericksburg. As a precaution, Lee temporarily halted Ewell's Corps, but <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> Hooker would not press the Fredericksburg line to bring on a battle, he ordered Ewell to continue. On June 9, Lee ordered Stuart to cross the Rappahannock and raid Union forward positions, screening the Confederate Army from observation or interference as it moved north. Anticipating this imminent offensive action, Stuart ordered his troopers into bivouac around Brandy Station.|$|E
25|$|In 242, Sun Quan {{designated}} {{his third}} and eldest surviving son, Sun He, {{as the new}} crown prince to replace Sun Deng, {{who died in the}} previous year. In the same year, he also enfeoffed his fourth son, Sun Ba, as the Prince of Lu. At the time, Shi Yi served as a tutor (傅) to Sun Ba. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> Sun Ba received equal treatment as Sun He, he felt that it was highly inappropriate because according to Confucian rules of propriety, Sun He, as the Crown Prince, should be accorded greater honours and privileges as compared to Sun Ba. He wrote memorials to Sun Quan on a number of occasions, recommending the emperor to let Sun Ba assume greater responsibilities and groom him to become an important pillar of the state. As Sun Ba's tutor, he gave proper advice to the prince and performed his role in a professional manner. At the same time, he also carried out his other duties diligently and treated everyone respectfully.|$|E
25|$|Zhong Hui {{had long}} harboured the {{intention}} of rebelling against Wei. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> Deng Ai behaved in an autocratic manner even though his military command was authorised by the Wei imperial court, he secretly reported to the court that Deng was plotting a rebellion. He was skilled in imitating people's handwriting. After getting his hands on a report written by Deng Ai to the Wei imperial court, he edited the report {{to make it sound}} arrogant and demanding. At the same time, he also destroyed a letter from Sima Zhao to Deng Ai to increase Sima's suspicions towards Deng. The Wei government fell for Zhong Hui's ruse and ordered Deng Ai to be arrested and transported back to Luoyang in a prison cart. Sima Zhao was worried that Deng Ai would not submit, so he ordered Zhong Hui and Wei Guan to arrest Deng Ai. With Zhong Hui and his troops following behind, Wei Guan went to Deng Ai's camp in Chengdu and used Sima Zhao's letter of authorisation to order Deng's soldiers to put down their weapons. Deng Ai was arrested and placed in a prison cart.|$|E
60|$|He {{was in the}} spirit, <b>he</b> says, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> it. <b>That</b> is, <b>he</b> did not see it {{with his}} bodily eyes, but with his soul, his heart and mind. Not with his bodily eyes (for no man hath seen God at any time), but with his mind's eye, which God had enlightened by his Holy Spirit.|$|R
60|$|Lifting {{his eyes}} from the floor on which his foot had been tapping nervously, <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> Paula {{standing}} at the other end.

5000|$|The Talmud also {{implies that}} {{unmarried}} {{men did not}} wear a kippah:Rabbi Hisda praised Rabbi Hamnuna before Rabbi Huna as a great man.

25|$|Lü Meng {{rejected}} the coins and gold, but Sun Quan {{insisted that he}} accept. He became ill again before he was enfeoffed as a marquis. Sun Quan was at Gong'an County then so he had Lü Meng brought to his personal residence to stay with him. He also offered 1,000 jin of gold as a reward to any person who could cure Lü Meng. Sun Quan became more worried as Lü Meng's condition deteriorated over time. He wanted to see Lü Meng but {{felt that it was}} too troublesome to keep moving around, so he had a hole drilled in the wall to observe Lü Meng's room. He was happy when he saw Lü Meng having his meals, but could not sleep at night <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> Lü Meng did not eat anything. When Lü Meng's condition improved slightly, he was so happy that he ordered his subjects to visit Lü Meng and wish him well. He even invited Taoist priests to perform rituals to increase Lü Meng's lifespan. Despite Sun Quan's efforts, Lü Meng eventually died in Gong'an County at the age of 42 (by East Asian age reckoning). Sun Quan was extremely grieved by Lü Meng's death. Before Lü Meng died, he had instructed his family to store all their priced possessions – including gifts from Sun Quan – in a vault and return them to his lord after his death. He had also asked for a simple funeral. Sun Quan felt even more sad when found out that Lü Meng had made such arrangements before his death.|$|E

500|$|It was a {{conflict}} with the pagan Mercians under Penda {{that proved to be}} Oswald's undoing. He was killed by the Mercians at the Battle of Maserfield, at a place generally identified with Oswestry (although other candidates for the location of the battle have been suggested) in 642, and his body was dismembered. Bede mentions the story that Oswald [...] "ended his life in prayer": he prayed for the souls of his soldiers <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> he was about to die. Oswald's head and limbs were placed on stakes.|$|E

By degrees, her understanding changed to horror, and <b>when</b> <b>he</b> stopped <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> she had got a cruel shock. Her face was white, her gaze was fixed, and, her eyes were unusually wide open. Still he thought it was through her pride she suffered most. Then she braced herself and looked at him scornfully.|$|R
60|$|On the {{following}} morning he found the old man himself wheeling a huge barrow of manure round from the yard into the kitchen-garden.

He had a man under him who hewed wood, and carried water, and wheeled barrows,--one man always, and often two. The squire knew <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> him <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was sinning, and bade him stop upon his road.|$|R
50|$|He was {{interested}} in science, art and literature, {{as a young man}} he had been an honorary assistant in the Melbourne observatory, and <b>when</b> treasurer <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> it was properly equipped; he collected objects of art, and became a trustee of the public library, museums and national gallery of Victoria in 1872, was elected vice-president in 1880, and president in 1883. He held this position until his death and showed much interest in the various collections.|$|R
