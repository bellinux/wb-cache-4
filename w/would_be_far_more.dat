5|$|Over time, Dmowski {{became more}} {{receptive}} to Russian overtures, particularly neoslavism, warming up {{to the idea that}} Poland and Russia may have a common future, particularly due to Germany being their common enemy. In light of what he regarded as Russian cultural inferiority, Dmowski felt that a strong Russia was more acceptable than a strong Germany. In Dmowski's view, the Russian policy of Russification would not succeed in subjugating the Poles, while the Germans <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> successful with their Germanisation policies. He explained those views in his book Niemcy, Rosja i kwestia Polska (Germany, Russia and the Polish Cause), published in 1908.|$|E
5|$|Roosevelt, both appreciating Willkie's talents, {{and seeking}} to {{divide and conquer}} his opposition, had been mulling over ways his former {{opponent}} might be of use. The president's onetime advisor, Justice Felix Frankfurter, had suggested to Van Doren on New Year's Eve that Willkie should travel across the Atlantic to demonstrate bipartisan support of Britain. Willkie had already been planning a visit in support for Britain. Roosevelt believed that the visit of the nominal head of the opposition party <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> effective in demonstrating American support than sending one of his advisors.|$|E
5|$|For {{financial}} and scripting reasons the last book {{was divided into}} two films, shot back to back, which drew criticism from the series' fanbase. Radcliffe defended the split, stating {{that it would have}} been impossible to properly adapt the final novel into a single film. He added that the last movie was going to be extremely fast-paced with a lot of action, while the first part <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> sedate, focusing on character development; he added that, had they combined them, those things would not have made it to the final cut. Filming lasted for a year, concluding in June 2010 and on the last day of shooting, like most of the cast and crew, Radcliffe openly wept.|$|E

60|$|S. 39. This {{is a most}} admirable passage. Yes,--the {{history of}} a man for the nine months {{preceding}} his birth, <b>would,</b> probably, <b>be</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> interesting, and contain events of greater moment than all the three score and ten years that follow it.|$|R
5|$|The {{continuing}} {{success of}} the OAO program encouraged increasingly strong consensus within the astronomical community that the LST should be a major goal. In 1970, NASA established two committees, one to plan the engineering side of the space telescope project, {{and the other to}} determine the scientific goals of the mission. Once these had been established, the next hurdle for NASA was to obtain funding for the instrument, which <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> costly than any Earth-based telescope. The U.S. Congress questioned many aspects of the proposed budget for the telescope and forced cuts in the budget for the planning stages, which at the time consisted of very detailed studies of potential instruments and hardware for the telescope. In 1974, public spending cuts led to Congress deleting all funding for the telescope project.|$|E
5|$|To the Milanese, Sforza's victory {{now seemed}} certain, {{but he found}} his Venetian allies {{beginning}} to have doubts about their Captain-General. They decided that Milan run by Sforza <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> dangerous and detrimental to their interests than if it were run by a weak Republic. The last of the territory claimed by Venice, namely Crema, was now captured. Venice went behind Sforza's back and signed a peace treaty with the Republic. They conceded conquered land to the Republic in return for peace, and let Sforza keep only Pavia, Cremona, Piacenza, and a narrow strip of land. They ordered him to accept the treaty or find Venice his enemy. The Republic rejoiced, and the citizens were confident {{the war was over}} and their future was secured. But Sforza could not accept the conditions of the treaty, and decided to persevere in the struggle. He was already very powerful, and moreover was close to Milan. The Milanese in their assurance of peace had nearly exhausted their resources to plant crops and return to the old way of life. He was confident that Milan would quickly fall to him. After reinforcing his peace with Savoy with the concession of a few unimportant castles, he defeated the Venetians under his rival Sigismondo Malatesta and continued the siege.|$|E
25|$|Rousseau {{continues}} {{to say that}} though Greek and Roman society functioned well with tragic and violent content in theatres because {{it was part of}} the traditions specific to the time and place, putting these plays in a French context <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> dangerous. However, tragedies are not as dangerous as comedies, because the characters more closely resemble French citizens.|$|E
6000|$|The captain [...] "allowed" [...] this <b>would</b> <b>be</b> safer, although, to <b>be</b> sure, it <b>would</b> also <b>be</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> laborious, for {{everything}} not {{left in the}} boat <b>would</b> have to <b>be</b> carried over the roughest kind of a trail, running some distance away from the stream.|$|R
50|$|A {{proposal}} {{was made to}} move the building to a new site, although this <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> expensive than demolition. Nevertheless, demolition began on South Korea's Liberation Day (Gwangbokjeol), August 15, 1995, with {{the removal of the}} dome. By late 1996, the building was completely removed.|$|R
6000|$|... "We'd {{better make}} a charge on the insects," [...] growled one old soldier.

25|$|Officials with Arlington County and {{the state}} of Virginia long debated whether to build new roads, which <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> {{expensive}} yet a boon to the local economy, or simply connect existing ones. Federal money became available for building approaches in 1933, four years into the Great Depression. The first connection with the bridge opened in October 1938; a second connection opened in 1942 to link it to the Pentagon road network.|$|E
25|$|In this {{particular}} example, the macro {{is no more}} complex than a C-style textual substitution, but because parsing of the macro parameter occurs before the macro operates on the calling code, diagnostic messages <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> informative. However, because {{the body of a}} macro is executed at compile time each time it is used, many techniques of optimization can be employed. It is even possible to entirely eliminate complex computations from resulting programs by performing the work at compile-time.|$|E
25|$|It can {{be argued}} that within this {{backdrop}} of mostly indistinguishable types, exceptions <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> pronounced. Atypical reverses are usually seen during and after periods of war, at which time emperors make various claims of liberation, subjugation, and pacification. Some of these reverse images can clearly be classified as propaganda. An example struck by emperor Philip in 244 features a legend proclaiming the establishment of peace with Persia; in truth, Rome had been forced to pay large sums in tribute to the Persians.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{point the}} Committee makes is {{actually}} {{in agreement with the}} prior report that the Brotherhood should not be designated as a terrorist organization. The Committee states “the evidence so <b>far</b> in Egypt <b>is</b> that if the Muslim Brotherhood supported or condoned violence, then Egypt <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a <b>far</b> <b>more</b> violent place today”.|$|R
50|$|I {{was stunned}} to learn that Australia has not officially {{recognised}} these wonderful PNG nationals who saved the lives of Australian servicemen. They carried stretchers, stores and sometimes wounded diggers directly on their shoulders {{over some of the}} toughest terrain in the world. Without them I think the Kokoda campaign <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> difficult than it was.|$|R
25|$|Most of {{the reports}} in the media tended to be {{critical}} of Patriarch Kirill and laughing at the claims that the dust was harmful, saying that it was just sand and it <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> efficient to just hire a maid to vacuum it up. The Patriarch himself then said he thought it to be inappropriate to forgive Shevchenko.|$|R
25|$|According to Canadian authorities, {{the value}} of the 2004 seal harvest was C$16.5 million, which {{significantly}} contributes to seal manufacturing companies, and for several thousand fishermen and First Nations peoples. For some sealers, they claim, proceeds from the hunt make up a third of their annual income. Critics, however, say this represents {{only a tiny fraction of}} the C$600-million Newfoundland fishing industry. Sealing opponents also say $16.5 million is insignificant, compared to the funding required to regulate and subsidize the hunt. For 1995 and 1996, there are confirmed reports Fisheries and Oceans Canada encouraged maximum utilization of harvested seals through a $0.20 per pound meat subsidy. The level of subsidy totaled $650,000 in 1997, $440,000 in 1998 and $250,000 in 1999. There were no meat subsidies in 2000. Some critics, such as the McCartneys (see below), have suggested promoting that area as an ecotourism site <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> lucrative than the annual harvest.|$|E
25|$|Large British {{offensive}} {{operations in}} Flanders were not possible in 1915, {{due to a}} lack of resources. The Germans conducted their own Flanders offensive at the Second Battle of Ypres (22 April – 15 May 1915), making the Ypres salient more costly to defend. Sir Douglas Haig succeeded Sir John French as Commander-in-Chief of the BEF on 19 December 1915. A week after his appointment, Haig met Vice-Admiral Sir Reginald Bacon, who emphasised the importance of obtaining control of the Belgian coast, to end the threat posed by German U-boats. Haig was sceptical of a coastal operation, believing that a landing from the sea <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> difficult than anticipated and that an advance along the coast would require so much preparation, that the Germans would have ample warning. Haig preferred an advance from Ypres, to bypass the flooded area around the Yser and the coast, before attempting a coastal attack to clear the coast to the Dutch border.|$|E
25|$|Djoser is {{best known}} for his {{innovative}} tomb, which dominates the Saqqara landscape. In this tomb he is referred to by his Horus name Netjeriykhet; Djoser is a name given by New Kingdom visitors thousands of years later. Djoser’s step pyramid is astounding in its departure from previous architecture. It sets several important precedents, perhaps the most important of which is its status as the first monumental structure made of stone. The social implications of such a large and carefully sculpted stone structure are staggering. The process of building such a structure <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> labor-intensive than previous monuments of mud-brick. This suggests that the state, and therefore the royal government had a new level of control of resources, both material and human. Also, from this point on, kings of the Old Kingdom are buried in the North, rather than at Abydos. Furthermore, although the plan of Djoser’s pyramid complex is different than later complexes, many elements persist and the step pyramid sets the stage for later pyramids of the 4th, 5th, and 6th Dynasties, including the great pyramids of Giza. Finally, another intriguing first is the identification of the architect Imhotep, who is credited with the design and construction of the complex.|$|E

5000|$|It {{has been}} remarked by one {{historian}} that Falmouth Parish Church has probably undergone more alterations and additions {{than any other}} church in the United Kingdom. Charles Henderson observed in 1925: [...] "It is interesting for its curious mixture of the Gothic and Classical styles. Its worst feature is a weak west tower in the former manner.

500|$|East Germany {{decided to}} upgrade the fortifications in the late 1960s to {{establish}} a [...] "modern frontier" [...] that <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> difficult to cross. Barbed-wire fences were replaced with harder-to-climb expanded metal barriers; directional anti-personnel mines and anti-vehicle ditches blocked the movement of people and vehicles; tripwires and electric signals helped guards to detect escapees; all-weather patrol roads enabled rapid access to any point along the border; and wooden guard towers were replaced with prefabricated concrete towers and observation bunkers.|$|E
500|$|The Journal {{supported}} {{the retention of}} the Spanish colonies taken during the war, including the Philippines, but Mr. Dooley dissented, anticipating that there <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> advantage for Americans who would exploit the islands than for the Filipinos whose lot imperialists said they were anxious to improve.

500|$|On receipt, the {{sketches}} and letter were forwarded to the Commission of Fine Arts, charged since 1921 with making recommendations on coinage design, {{and then to}} its sculptor member, James Earle Fraser, designer of the Buffalo nickel. Fraser wrote to Rossi on May 18, deprecating the designs, [...] "the bear is entirely too short, {{and the whole thing}} inexperienced and amateurish." [...] He recommended that Chester Beach (credited with the design of the 1923 Monroe Doctrine coin) or Robert I. Aitken (who had created the 1915 Panama-Pacific $50 pieces) be hired, as both were from California and might create [...] "something which <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> interesting and with a bigger sense of what California really is".|$|E

500|$|On September 20, Republican National Committee {{official}} Bob Humphreys first {{suggested that}} Nixon give a televised {{speech to the}} nation to explain his position. RNC chairman and future Postmaster General Arthur Summerfield thought well of the idea, but {{was concerned about the}} expense. That evening, Nixon conferred with his aides, who unanimously urged him not to resign from the ticket. Humphreys called Chotiner at Nixon's hotel in Portland, Oregon that evening, and the campaign manager realized that the broadcast was the best opportunity for the candidate to make his case. Humphreys suggested Nixon appear on Meet the Press, but Chotiner rejected the suggestion, insisting that his candidate must have complete control of the broadcast [...] "without interruption by possibly unfriendly press questions". Humphreys mentioned that Summerfield was concerned about the cost of a television broadcast, but Chotiner noted that the cost of reprinting all campaign materials to reflect a change on the ticket <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> than that of a telecast.|$|E
60|$|During {{all this}} while, the seamen and our gentlemen got much profit and sport from hunting and fishing, adding {{in no small}} degree to our store of food.
