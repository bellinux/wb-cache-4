He got another with the next ball, and by lunch, Zimbabwe were 75 for 6. Taibu, however, recorded his highest innings as captain against anyone except Bangladesh, and his partnership with Blessing Mahwire turned things from total despair to slight hope. Zimbabwe were eventually all out for 231, Daniel Vettori finishing off with the last two wickets after having bowled 27 of 79 overs in the innings.|$|E
25|$|The Novodevichy Convent housed many ladies {{from the}} Russian royal {{families}} and boyar clans {{who had been}} forced to take the veil, such as Feodor I's wife Irina Godunova (in residence 15981603; she <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>with</b> her brother Boris Godunov until he became a ruler himself), Sofia Alekseyevna (Peter the Great's half-sister; in residence 16891704), Eudoxia Lopukhina (Peter the Great's first wife, in residence 17271731), and others. In 16101611 a Polish unit under the command of Aleksander Gosiewski captured the Novodevichy Convent. Once Russian forces had retaken the convent, tsar Michael Fyodorovich supplied it with permanent guards (100Streltsy in 1616, 350soldiers in 1618). By the end of the 17th century, the Novodevichy Convent possessed 36villages (164,215desyatinas of land) in 27uyezds of Russia. In 1744, it owned 14,489peasants.|$|E

25|$|During {{the early}} 160s, Fronto's {{son-in-law}} Victorinus was stationed as a legate in Germany. He <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>with</b> {{his wife and}} children (another child had stayed with Fronto and his wife in Rome). The condition on the northern frontier looked grave. A frontier post had been destroyed, and it looked like all the peoples of central and northern Europe were in turmoil. There was corruption among the officers: Victorinus had to ask for the resignation of a legionary legate who was taking bribes. Experienced governors had been replaced by friends and relatives of the imperial family. Lucius Dasumius Tullius Tuscus, a distant relative of Hadrian, was in Upper Pannonia, succeeding the experienced Marcus Nonius Macrinus. Lower Pannonia was under the obscure Tiberius Haterius Saturnius. Marcus Servilius Fabianus Maximus was shuffled from Lower Moesia to Upper Moesia when Marcus Iallius Bassus had joined Lucius in Antioch. Lower Moesia was filled by Pontius Laelianus' son. The Dacias were still divided in three, governed by a praetorian senator and two procurators. The peace could not hold long; Lower Pannonia did not even have a legion.|$|E

500|$|By late 1637, the {{conclusion}} of the controversy was beginning to take shape.

[...] During {{the second day of the}} trial, when things seemed to be going in her favor, Hutchinson insisted on making a statement, admitting that her knowledge of things had come from a divine inspiration, prophesying her deliverance from the proceedings, and announcing that a curse would befall the colony. [...] This was all that her judges needed to hear, and she was accused of heresy and sentenced to banishment, though she would be held in detention for four months, awaiting a trial by the clergy. [...] While no statements made by Wilson were recorded in either existing transcript of this trial, Wilson did make a speech against Hutchinson at the end of the proceedings, to which Hutchinson responded with anger four months later during her church trial.|$|E
500|$|Kirchherr later {{supplied}} Sutcliffe and {{the other}} Beatles with Preludin, which, when taken with beer, made them feel euphoric and helped to keep them awake until {{the early hours of}} the morning. The Beatles had taken Preludin before, but it was possible at that time to get Preludin only with a doctor's prescription note, so Kirchherr's mother got them from a local chemist, who supplied them without asking questions. After meeting Kirchherr, Lennon filled his letters to Cynthia Powell (his girlfriend at the time) with [...] "Astrid said this, Astrid did that", which made Powell jealous, until she read that Sutcliffe was in a relationship with Kirchherr. When Powell visited Hamburg with Dot Rhone (McCartney's girlfriend at the time) in April 1961, they stayed at Kirchherr's house. In August 1963, Kirchherr met Lennon and Cynthia in Paris while they were both there for a belated honeymoon, as Kirchherr <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>with</b> a girlfriend for a few days' holiday.
