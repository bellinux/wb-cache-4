50|$|The Church of St Barrahane, {{built in}} 1826, overlooks the town. Its main {{architect}} was James Pain. This replaced the original church built in 1761. It is {{noted for its}} stained glass windows; the east window by Harry Clarke, {{was given to the}} church in 1915 in memory of Mr and Mrs Somerville by their grandchildren. The window in the south wall of the chancel and <b>the</b> third <b>window</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> south side are also by Clarke. <b>The</b> eastern <b>window</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> north side, <b>the</b> eastern-most <b>window</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> south side and <b>the</b> second <b>window</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> south side are all by Powell's of London.|$|R

5|$|Designed by William R. Walker & Son and {{constructed}} by S. Mason & H. A. Smith in 1886, the one story red brick Queen Anne style building is basically rectangular with a low-pitched hipped roof. The red bricks are laid in dark red mortar and is contrasted by the granite sill course and brownstone belt course at window sill level. The building has a central closed entry pavilion which projects out {{and has two}} porches oriented to face Mulberry and Cedar Street. The building has three lunette <b>windows</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sides of the main block, each divided into thirds, and a smaller <b>windows</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> pavilion's pedimented end. The rear ell has double hung two-over-two sash windows. At {{the time of the}} nomination, during the renovations to a single family home, the house had its Cedar Street porch closed in with plywood and the smaller lunette windows were boarded in, but the exterior wooden trim was largely extant.|$|E

5|$|The SS {{transfer}} the Jews {{to one of}} two ghettos, each with its own council or Judenrat. Eliezer's house on a corner of Serpent Street was in the larger ghetto in the town centre, so his family was able to stay at home, though the <b>windows</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> non-ghetto side had to be boarded up.|$|E
5|$|The building's western façade has {{a central}} {{entryway}} with double doors, {{topped by a}} six-light transom and flanked by engaged pilasters.

The building's southern elevation has wooden windows with 12-over-12 double-hung sashes on brick window sills. Its basement level has one entrance, flanked by wooden double-hung sash windows and four casement windows. The northeastern elevation has three stained-glass <b>windows</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> main level, with three wooden eight-over-eight double-hung sash windows; a single wooden six-over-six double-hung sash window is in the gable.

5|$|The modern red-brick Grundtvig's Church, {{southeast}} of the town centre, was designed by Ole Nielsen. With its strangely shaped, red-tiled roof, it was completed in 1969. Inside, the large wall surfaces are broken only by 12 narrow <b>windows</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> east side, creating a contrast with the much brighter tower room which opens into the chancel with light entering from a window high {{on the east side}} of the tower.|$|E

5|$|Tunnelling {{began in}} September 1903. Stations were {{provided}} with surface buildings designed by architect Leslie Green in the UERL house-style. This consisted of two-storey steel-framed buildings faced with red glazed terracotta blocks with wide semi-circular <b>windows</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> upper floor. Each station was provided with two or four lifts and an emergency spiral staircase in a separate shaft.|$|E
5|$|Wells Cathedral {{contains}} one of {{the most}} substantial collections of medieval stained glass in England, despite damage by Parliamentary troops in 1642 and 1643. The oldest surviving glass dates from the late 13th century and is in two <b>windows</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> west side of the chapter-house staircase. Two windows in the south choir aisle are from 1310–20.|$|E
5|$|<b>Windows</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> east façade are {{rectangular}} {{with eight}} windows at ground floor and five at first floor, all with gothic frames. On the south façade, {{the ground floor}} windows are taller with a number being two- and three-lighted and stone framed. A chamfered two-storey bay is located slightly {{to the right of}} centre. <b>Windows</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first floor are simpler and less tall. The 1819 works also included the demolition and replacement of the north and west ranges and substantial rebuilding of the south range. The north range is built up in red and grey brick from the stone walls of the demolished range. The west range is surmounted by a 17th-century clock turret relocated from the south range when that was rebuilt. The bell is dated 1647.|$|E

5|$|After {{the land}} had been surveyed, the first buyer was the Education Board, {{securing}} {{land for a}} school in the market square, and a teacher's house on the adjacent section. Both these buildings were also built in concrete and exist to this day. The school was built to a northern hemisphere design and has <b>windows</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> south side only to stop children from becoming distracted, but the windows are {{on the wrong side}} to utilise the sun. Since the school closed in 1938 it has been used for functions and as a hall. The former teacher's house is used as a bach. Both buildings are owned by Ashburton District Council.|$|E
5|$|Located at 800 Southeast 10thAvenue, the {{building}} occupies the west {{half of the}} block between Southeast Belmont and Southeast Morrison streets. The southwest corner entry features a stylized Egyptian temple of cast stone. Italianate Renaissance influence {{is seen in the}} ground floor's large arched windows and tall narrow <b>windows</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> second. The west facade is lined with banks of large windows that helped illuminate and cool the work areas. Other important exterior features include a large garage door along Belmont Street, and a paved parking lot and water-tower pedestal on the Morrison Street side.|$|E
5|$|Many of the {{earliest}} buildings were simple gabled rectangles, a style that continued to be built into the seventeenth century. Examples include Dunnottar Castle in the 1580s, Greenock (1591) and Durness (1619), These new buildings often had <b>windows</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> south wall and none on the north, which became a unique feature of Reformation kirks. There were continuities with pre-Reformation materials, with some churches using rubble, as at Kemback in Fife (1582). Others employed stone and a few added wooden steeples, as at Burntisland (1592). The church of Greyfriars, Edinburgh, built between 1602 and 1620, used a rectangular layout with a largely Gothic form, but that at Dirleton (1612), had a more sophisticated classical style.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, {{the police}} located the embassy {{caretaker}} {{and took him}} to their forward headquarters to brief the SAS and senior police officers. He informed them that the embassy's front door was reinforced by a steel security door, and that the <b>windows</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground floor and first floor were fitted with armoured glass—the result of recommendations made after the SAS had been asked to review security arrangements for the embassy several years earlier. Plans for entering the embassy by battering the front door and ground-floor windows were quickly scrapped and work began on other ideas.|$|E
5|$|On December 19, 2007, Microsoft {{signed a}} five-year, $500 million {{contract}} with Viacom that included content sharing and advertisements. The deal allowed Microsoft to license many shows from Viacom owned cable television and film studios for use on Xbox Live and MSN. The deal also made Viacom a preferred publisher partner for casual game development and distribution through MSN and <b>Windows.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> advertisement side of the deal, Microsoft's Atlas ad-serving division became the exclusive provider of previously unsold advertising inventory on Viacom owned web sites. Microsoft also purchased {{a large amount of}} advertising on Viacom owned broadcasts and online networks, and collaborated on promotions and sponsorships for MTV and BET award shows, two Viacom owned cable networks.|$|E
5|$|On {{a typical}} weekday, a {{combined}} total of 50,000 people {{worked in the}} North and South Towers, with another 200,000 passing through as visitors. The complex was so large that it had its own zip code: 10048. The <b>Windows</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> World restaurant, located {{on top of the}} North Tower, reported revenues of $37 million in 2000, making it the highest-grossing restaurant in the United States. The Twin Towers became known worldwide, appearing in movies, television shows, postcards, and other merchandise.
