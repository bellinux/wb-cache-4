They immediately embrace, still as in love with each other as they <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>ago.</b> She tells him to go to London and wait for her. But after he leaves, German soldiers arrive at the gardens and begin questioning Madeline. She obliges, thinking that the longer the soldiers are with her, the further away Raoul will get from France. Col. Erfurt and Madeline argue and he ends up confiscating Madeline’s passport, leaving her to be a prisoner in France. Madeline and Raoul do not end up together.|$|E

40|$|One view of {{computational}} {{learning theory}} {{is that of a}} learner acquiring the knowledge of a teacher. We introduce a formal model of learning capturing the idea that teachers may have gaps in their knowledge. The goal of the learner is still to acquire the knowledge of the teacher, but now the learner must also identify the gaps. This is the notion of learning from a consistently ignorant teacher. We consider the impact of knowledge gaps on learning, for example, monotone DNF and d-dimensional boxes, and show that learning is still possible. Negatively, we show that knowledge gaps make learning conjunctions of Horn clauses as hard as learning DNF. We also present general results describing when known learning algorithms can be used to obtain learning algorithms using a consistently ignorant teacher. "Consistency requires you to be as ignorant today as you <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>ago.</b> " [...] Bernard Berenson (1865 - 1959) Supported in part by NSF Grant IRI- 9014840, and by NASA grant NAG 1 - 613. y S [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Report {{closed on}} 7 July 2016. [...] Short run {{consequences}} of Brexit for the euro area economy mainly {{depend on the}} effects on confidence in {{the stability of the}} European Union and the currency area in particular. Anti-European (or indeed anti-globalization) movements are certainly encouraged by the British vote. More important, however, might be a reverse effect: {{from the perspective of the}} British turmoil, the euro area might in the near future appear as a zone of relative stability and calm. [...] Against the background of a sluggish world economy, the euro area economy recently performed reasonably well: dynamics have been slowly increasing since 2013, and the rate of expansion in the first quarter of 2016 was one of the highest of the past couple of years. [...] Looking forward, the drivers of the recovery should continue supporting growth in the second half of 2016 and for much of 2017. Our forecast is that euro area GDP will expand by 1. 7 % in 2016 and by 1. 6 % in 2017, with only a minor effect from Brexit. This year, like in 2015, average oil prices will probably be markedly lower than they <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>ago,</b> supporting real incomes of private households and lowering production costs of firms, and monetary policy will still be supportive. Labour markets appear to continue improving slowly. [...] Associated with the improved economic conditions, we expect a slight increase in euro area inflation during 2016, 0. 3 %, with a more marked increase in 2017, 1. 3 %...|$|E
