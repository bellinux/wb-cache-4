500|$|Feige {{revealed}} that Captain Marvel, who {{is scheduled to}} appear in her own MCU film in 2019, appeared in an early draft of the screenplay, but was removed since the character {{had not yet been}} cast, saying, [...] "It didn't feel like the time. We didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>introduce</b> her fully formed flying in a costume before you knew who she was or how she came to be." [...] Whedon {{went so far as to}} shoot visual effects plates for Captain Marvel to fly into Avengers Tower at the end of the film; those shots were reused, however, for Scarlet Witch instead. Feige also {{revealed that}} an early draft of the script had Hulk's Quinjet detected near Saturn at the end of the film, but it was finally decided to keep it Earth-based and leave his fate ambiguous in order to dispel rumors that a film based on the [...] "Planet Hulk" [...] comic storyline was in development, which Marvel Studios had no plans to adapt at the time. Marvel would later decide to adapt [...] "Planet Hulk" [...] for the film , in which the Hulk does end up leaving Earth.|$|E
500|$|In June 1997, Anggun {{released}} her first French-language album, entitled Au nom de la lune. The album {{was a huge}} artistic departure to Anggun's earlier rock style, experimenting with world music and more adult contemporary sounds. Anggun described the album as [...] "a concentration of all the musical influences of my life. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>introduce</b> Indonesia, but in a progressive way, in a lyric, in a sound, and mainly through me." [...] The album's first single, [...] "La neige au Sahara", quickly became a hit in France, peaking at number 1 on the French Airplay Chart and number 16 on the French Singles Chart. It became the most-played single in France of 1997, {{with a total of}} 7,900 radio airplays, and was certified gold for shipment of 250,000 copies. Two more commercial singles, [...] "La rose des vents" [...] and [...] "Au nom de la lune", were released to modest chart success. The album peaked at number 34 on the French Albums Chart and sold over 150,000 copies in France and Belgium. Anggun received a nomination for the La révélation de l'année award (Revelation of the Year/Best New Artist) in Victoires de la musique (a Grammy Award-equivalent in the French music scene).|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} {{recorded}} on August 13, 1990. The voice of Herb {{was provided by}} guest star Danny DeVito, an American actor who was suggested for the role by Simpsons executive producer Sam Simon. Bart's voice actor, Nancy Cartwright, writes in her autobiography My Life as a 10-Year-Old Boy that DeVito had to record his lines quickly because he had another appointment, so the staff focused on recording his scenes only instead of the whole episode at once. Cartwright was a fan of DeVito's and recalls: [...] "This morning, at the table read, I had just filled my plate with assorted fruits when Bonnie said to my backside, 'Nancy, I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>introduce</b> you to...' and I turned and practically knocked over Danny DeVito, all four feet, eleven inches of him. How embarrassing!" [...] While recording the scenes, Cartwright stood directly across the room from DeVito, which she appreciated since she got {{to see him in}} action. She thought DeVito [...] "threw his body and soul" [...] into his performance. While the recording took part, animation director Archer scribbled down some of DeVito's attitudes, gestures, and facial expressions {{on a piece of paper}} as he performed. In one scene of the episode, Herb tells Homer and the rest of the Simpson family to [...] " [...] yourselves at home. We have a tennis court, a swimming pool, a screening room..." [...] Cartwright said of it: ...|$|E

500|$|As {{the studio}} was {{simultaneously}} developing , limitations were set on which mutants {{could be used}} for cameo appearances in X-Men 3 in an attempt to avoid risking character development for Wolverine. Gambit was considered for both the convoy scene being freed by Magneto and the Battle of Alcatraz along with the X-Men, but the writers did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>introduce</b> a fan favorite character and [...] "not be able to do him justice." [...] Kinberg reasoned, [...] "there just wasn't enough space", and considered Gambit would only work with as much screentime as Beast. Alan Cumming had been uncomfortable with the long hours he had to take with the prosthetic makeup as Nightcrawler in X2, but still planned to return for the sequel. The part of Nightcrawler was so minimal, however, that the studio felt it was not worthwhile to go through the long and costly makeup process, and the character was cut. Kinberg felt that [...] "there wasn't much left to do with the character. It also felt like he might tread {{a little bit on the}} terrain of Beast, in terms of similarities in the characters and their political standpoints in terms of dealing with their mutancy." [...] Nightcrawler's absence was later explained in [...] The introdutory scenes tried to emulate the Auschwitz opener for the first film, going with different scenes that resonated later in the plot instead of an action scene like in most blockbusters. Afterwards came a scene in the Danger Room, which was considered for the previous X-Men films but never included for budget and writing concerns. The writers tried to make the simulation not feel extraneous by showcasing some of the character conflicts and abilities in a [...] "Days of Future Past"-inspired battle with a Sentinel. Another repurposed scene was Magneto attacking the convoy to free Mystique, Madrox and Juggernaut, which Penn had previously envisioned for X2.|$|E

2500|$|In theory, Antonescu's {{policies}} had {{at least}} one revolutionary aspect. The leader himself claimed: [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>introduce</b> a patriotic, heroic, military-typed education, because economic education and all the others follow from it." [...] According to Boia, his arrival in power was explicitly meant to [...] "regenerate" [...] Romania, and his popularity hinged on his being perceived as a [...] "totalitarian model" [...] and a [...] "savior" [...] figure, like Corneliu Zelea Codreanu and Carol II before him. The [...] "providential" [...] and [...] "savior" [...] themes are also emphasized by historian Adrian Majuru, who notes that Antonescu both adopted such ideals and criticized Carol for failing to live up to them. Seeing his rule as legitimized by the national interest, the general is also known to have referred to political pluralism as poltronerie ("poltroonishness"). Accordingly, Antonescu formally outlawed all political forces in February 1941, codifying penal labor as punishment for most public forms of political expression. In Deletant's assessment, his regenerative program was more declarative than factual, and contradicted by Antonescu's own decision to allow the informal existence of some opposition forces. At the same time, some historians believe his monopolizing of power {{in the name of a}} German alliance turned Romania into either a [...] "puppet state" [...] of Hitler or one of Germany's [...] "satellite" [...] governments. However, Deletant notes: [...] "Romania retained her sovereignty throughout the period of the alliance [...] [...] Antonescu had, of course, his own country's interests uppermost in his mind, but in following Hitler, he served the Nazi cause." [...] He describes Romania's contribution to the war as that of [...] "a principal ally of Germany", as opposed to a [...] "minor Axis satellite." ...|$|E
