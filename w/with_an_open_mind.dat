The study was based on eight interviews with mothers and/or fathers of twins. Questionnaires were used as preparation before the interviews to get reflective responses during the interviews.

Komoco Motors Pte. Ltd. (2008), was whether the Registrar of Vehicles had acted correctly in relying {{on the open market}} value ("OMV") of vehicles determined by the Singapore Customs to calculate the additional registration fee ("ARF") payable on such vehicles. This practice, referred to as the [...] "administrative convention" [...] in the case, had existed for over 40 years. In the High Court, the judge found that the Registrar had fettered her discretion in relation to the valuation of the cars because, having instituted a policy of adopting the Customs' valuation of the OMV, she had not been prepared to hear out <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>open</b> <b>mind</b> Komoco's case that the ARF was incorrect. The judge dismissed the fact that the Registrar had held meetings with her senior officers and had taken extended periods of time to make a decision, holding that these did not show she had given genuine consideration to Komoco's case as [...] "the passing of time [...] not by itself indicate how the time was used". The judge also found that the absence of the Registrar's comments on Komoco's arguments, especially on some which the judge found credible, strengthened the case that genuine consideration had not been given. Lastly, the judge held the Registrar had indicated that she had dealt with Komoco's representations with a predisposed frame of mind as her reply to Komoco was that [...] "the policy was very clear" [...] and that the ARF had been [...] "computed based on the OMVs as assessed by Customs".|$|E

I think in retrospect we made a mistake in giving their entrance such a fanfare as a New Asian Family. Viewers traditionally {{take a long time to}} adapt to anyone new [...] so it was wrong to emphasise what was different about this family from the start. Even so, we had a terrific first story for them, which was to have culminated in a huge, action storyline to mark the exit of their father. However, the sudden removal of actor Dalip Tahil, for reasons beyond our control, meant that the story had to be abandoned quickly – and 40 scripts rewritten on the spot. The result was the transplant story, which I have to admit did go on for far too long, especially when our biggest story in this period had also to be abandoned because of the pregnancy of Kacey Ainsworth. The writers and production team did their very best under these circumstances but I would be the first to admit the end result was not our finest hour.
