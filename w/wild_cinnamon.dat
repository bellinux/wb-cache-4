60|$|Scarlet-flowered {{rhododendron}} bushes {{cover the}} north side of Chillong,* [These skirt a wood of prickly bamboo, in which occur fig, laurel, Aralia, Boemeria, Smilax, Toddalia, <b>wild</b> <b>cinnamon,</b> and three kinds of oak.] whilst the south is grassy and quite bare; and except some good Orchideae on the trees, there is little to reward the botanist. The rocks appeared to be sandstone at the summit, but micaceous gneiss all around.|$|E
60|$|We passed some immense landslips, {{which had}} swept the forest into the torrent, and exposed white banks of angular {{detritus}} of gneiss and granite: we crossed one 200 yards long, {{by a narrow}} treacherous path, on a slope of 35 degrees: the subjacent gneiss was nearly vertical, striking north-east. We camped at 6,670 feet, amongst a vegetation I little expected to find {{so close to the}} snows of Kinchin; it consisted of oak, maple, birch, laurel, rhododendron, white Daphne, jessamine, Arum, Begonia, Cyrtandraceae, pepper, fig, Menispermum, <b>wild</b> <b>cinnamon,</b> Scitamineae, several epiphytic orchids, vines, and ferns in great abundance.|$|E
50|$|Cinnamomum ovalifoilium, called <b>wild</b> <b>cinnamon</b> or wal kurundu in Sinhala, is an {{evergreen}} tree {{endemic to}} Sri Lanka. It is in brink of extinction due to point distribution.|$|E
50|$|Cinnamon {{specimens}} of many {{species have been}} observed in the <b>wild.</b> A stuffed <b>Cinnamon</b> Light Green budgerigar hen owned by Mrs Ellis of Cottenham, Cambridgeshire, in 1935 and said then {{to be at least}} 50 years old was thought by Cyril Rogers to be wild-caught when he examined it.|$|R
5000|$|Greenhouses (826 m2) - {{tropical}} house (with palm trees, sugar cane, <b>wild</b> rice, coca, <b>cinnamon,</b> {{and a large}} aquarium); orchids from Nicaragua and Vietnam; a cactus house containing about 250 species; and bromeliad {{house with}} about 220 species of bromeliad, as well as banana tree, vanilla, carnivorous plants, and coffee.|$|R
50|$|This {{sanctuary}} is home {{to several}} species of wild relatives of cultivated plants including wild rice, <b>wild</b> ginger, turmeric, <b>cinnamon,</b> solanum, guava, mango and pepper that act as a reserve gene pool for the cultivated plants. In places mixed vegetation types are present. The deciduous trees shed their green leaves during the summer, and adopt a floral garb while {{the arrival of the}} monsoons hails fruits and tender greens.|$|R
50|$|Cinnamomum dubium, called <b>wild</b> <b>cinnamon</b> or wal kurundu in Sinhala, is an {{evergreen}} tree {{originating in}} Sri Lanka. It may {{also found in}} India, but in doubt about distribution.|$|E
5000|$|Khamasom {{village is}} known for its {{richness}} in forest vegetation. The mostly found trees are Pine, Oak, Aldar, <b>Wild</b> <b>Cinnamon</b> and many others. Khamasom is arguably the only village in northeastern India that has a thick virgin forest in the Indo-Burma border stretch.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>wild</b> <b>cinnamon</b> {{that grew}} in the region around Negombo {{was said to be}} [...] "the very best in the {{universe}} as well as the most abundant" [...] and for centuries attracted a succession of foreign traders and colonial powers. The shallow waters of the Negombo Lagoon provided safe shelter for seafaring vessels and became one of the key ports (along with Kalpitiya, Puttalam, Salavata, Kammala, Colombo, Kalutara, Beruwala and Galle) from which the Singhalese kingdoms conducted external trade.|$|E
5000|$|A {{great variety}} of plant species {{are found in the}} {{relatively}} unspoilt northern and eastern sides of the forest. Some common indigenous tree and shrub species are Acronychia pedunculata (Sinhalese: [...] "ankenda"), Artocarpus nobilis ("wal del"), Artocarpus heterophyllus ("kos"), Caryota urens ("kitul"), Aglaia elaeagnoidea ("puwanga"), Bombax ceiba ("katu imbul"), Canarium zeylanicum, Cinnamomum verum ("kurundu", cinnamon), Ficus virens, Filicium decipiens ("pihimbiya"), Aphananthe cuspidata ("wal-munamal"), Goniothalamus gardneri, Haldina cordifolia, Hunteria zeylanica, Mallotus tetracoccus, Mesua ferrea ("na", iron-wood), Michelia champaca ("sapu"), Mangifera zeylanica ("atamba"), Neoclitsea cassia ("dawul kurundu‚Äù, <b>wild</b> <b>cinnamon),</b> Glycosmis pentaphylla (orangeberry, doda-pana), Litsea quinqueflora, Micromelum minitum ("wal karapuncha"), Pavetta blanda, Psychotria nigra, Vitex pinnata ("milla") and Walsura gardneri.|$|E
50|$|The Utaki {{sacred sites}} (often with {{associated}} burial grounds) on Okinawa {{are based on}} Ryukyuan religion, and usually are associated with toun or kami-asagi - regions dedicated to the gods where people are forbidden to go. Sacred groves are often present in such places, as also in Gusukus - fortified areas which contain sacred sites within them. The Seifa-utaki was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site designated in 2003. It consists of a triangular cavern formed by gigantic rocks, and contains a sacred grove with rare, indigenous trees like the Kubanoki (a kind of palm) and the yabunikkei or Cinnamomum japonicum (a form of <b>wild</b> <b>cinnamon).</b> Direct access to the grove is forbidden.|$|E
50|$|While few {{plant species}} are endemic to {{tropical}} hardwood hammocks, hammocks are critical habitat for West Indian species where the northernmost {{portions of their}} ranges extend into South Florida. Plants with their entire United States distribution in South Florida, and which are limited to tropical hardwood hammock habitats include Bahama strongback (Bourreria succulenta), buccaneer palm (Pseudophoenix sargentii), crabwood (Gymnanthes lucida), Florida boxwood (Schaefferia frutescens), Florida oncidium (Oncidium floridanum), ghostplant (Leiphiamos parasitica), green thatch palm (Thrinax radiata), Key's nutrush (Scleria lithosperma), Key's tree cactus (Pilosocereus robinii), Krug's holly (Ilex krugiana), least halberd fern (Tectaria fimbriata), lignum vitae (Guajacum sanctum), mahogany mistletoe (Phoradendron rubrum), manchineel (Hippomane mancinella), milkbark (Drypetes diversifolia), pearlberry (Vallesia antillana), princewood (Exostema caribaea), red stopper (Eugenia rhombea), slender spleenwort (Asplenium dentatum), spicewood (Calyptranthes pallens), West Indian cherry (Prunus myrtifolia), West Indian mahogony (Swietenia mahagoni), <b>wild</b> <b>cinnamon</b> (Canella winterana), wild dilly (Manilkara jaimiqui ssp. emarginata), and wild-tamarind (Lysiloma latisiliquum).|$|E
50|$|Some imperilled {{species are}} {{found only in}} hammocks and have more {{restricted}} ranges. Species of tropical hardwood hammocks which are found only in the Florida Keys and on the Miami Rock Ridge include trees and shrubs such as red stopper (Eugenia rhombea), and spicewood (Calyptranthes pallens), vines such as West Indian cock's comb (Celosia nitida) and yellow nicker (Caesalpinia major), and herbs such as ghost plant (Leiphaimos parasitica), and Key's nutrush (Scleria lithosperma). Trees and shrubs found only in the Florida Keys and along the northern shores of Florida Bay include: manchineel (Hippomane mancinella), mayten (Maytenus phyllanthoides), West Indian mahogony (Swietenia mahagoni), <b>wild</b> <b>cinnamon</b> (Canella winteriana), and wild dilly (Manilkara jaimiqui). Other species have limited but geographically diverse ranges. An example is myrtle-of-the-river (Calyptranthes zuzygium), found in hammocks in the upper Florida Keys, in a few scattered hammocks in the southern portion of the Miami Rock Ridge, {{and in a few}} hammocks near Flamingo in Everglades NP. Other species, such as joewood (Jacquinia keyensis) and inkwood (Hypelate trifoliata), are found primarily in hammocks in the Florida Keys, but are also found outside of that area in other communities (e.g., pine rockland, maritime hammock, and Keys buttonwood wetlands).|$|E
